In this NP-hard problem, each job has an associated processing time, due date and a weight. For each pair of jobs i and j, there may be a setup time before starting to process j in case this job is scheduled immediately after i. The objective is to determine a schedule that minimizes the total weighted tardiness, where the tardiness of a job is equal to its completion time minus its due date, in case the job is completely processed only after its due date, and is equal to zero otherwise. Due to its complexity, this problem is most commonly solved by heuristics. The aim of this work is to develop a simple yet effective limitation strategy that speeds up the local search procedure without a significant loss in the solution quality. Such strategy consists of a filtering mechanism that prevents unpromising moves to be evaluated. The proposed strategy has been embedded in a local search based metaheuristic from the literature and tested in classical benchmark instances. Computational experiments revealed that the limitation strategy enabled the metaheuristic to be extremely competitive when compared to other algorithms from the literature, since it allowed the use of a large number of neighborhood structures without a significant increase in the CPU time and, consequently, high quality solutions could be achieved in a matter of seconds.

      "text" : "This paper deals with the single machine total weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-\ndependent setup times, a well-known problem in the scheduling literature, which can be\ndefined as follows. Given a set of jobs J = {1, . . . , n} to be scheduled on a single ma-\nchine, for each job j ∈ J , let pj be the processing time and dj be the due date with a non-negative weight wj. Also, consider a setup time sij that is required before starting to process job j ∈ J in case this job is scheduled immediately after job i ∈ J . The objective is to determine a schedule that minimizes the total weighted tardiness ∑\nwjTj , where the\ntardiness Tj of a job j ∈ J depends on its associated completion time Cj and is given by max{Cj − dj , 0}. Based on the notation proposed in Graham et al. (1979) we will hereafter denote this problem as 1|sij| ∑ wjTj.\nA special version of problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj arises when setup times are not considered.\nSuch version is usually referred to as 1|| ∑\nwjTj , which is known to be NP-hard in a\nstrong sense Lawler (1977); Lenstra et al. (1977). Therefore, problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj is also NP-hard since it includes problem 1|| ∑\nwjTj as a particular case.\nGiven the complexity of problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj , most methods proposed in the literature are based on (meta)heuristics. In particular, local search based metaheuristics had been\nquite effective in generating high quality solutions for this problem (Kirlik and Oğuz, 2012;\nXu et al., 2013; Subramanian et al., 2014). Nevertheless, one of the main limitations of\nsuch methods is the computational cost of evaluating a move during the local search.\nTypically, the number of possible moves in classical neighborhoods such as insertion and swap is O(n2), whereas the complexity of evaluating each move from these neighborhoods\nis O(n), when performed in a straightforward fashion. Hence, the overall complexity of examining these neighborhoods is O(n3).\nRecently, Liao et al. (2012) presented a sophisticated method that reduces the com-\nplexity of enumerating and evaluating all moves from the aforementioned neighborhoods from O(n3) to O(n2logn). However, in practice, this procedure is only useful for very\nlarge instances. For example, they showed empirically that the advantage of using their\napproach for the neighborhood swap starts to be visibly significant only for instances with\nmore than around 1000 jobs.\nThe aim of this work is to develop a simple yet effective strategy that speeds up the local\nsearch procedure without a significant loss in the solution quality. Such strategy consists of\na filtering mechanism that prevents unpromising moves to be evaluated. The idea behind\nthis approach relies on a measurement that must be computed at runtime. In our case,\nwe use the setup variation, which can be computed in O(1) time to estimate if a move is\npromising or not to be evaluated. Moreover, the bottleneck of traditional implementations\nlimits the number of neighborhoods to be explored in the local search. Our proposed\nstrategy enables the use of a large number of neighborhoods, such as moving blocks of\nconsecutive jobs, which is likely to lead to high quality solutions. In fact, Xu et al. (2013)\nshowed that this type of neighborhood may indeed lead to better solutions for problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj .\nThe proposed local search strategy has been tested in classical benchmark instances\nusing the ILS-RVND metaheuristic (Subramanian, 2012). Computational experiments\nrevealed that the limitation strategy enabled the metaheuristic to be extremely competi-\ntive when compared to other algorithms from the literature, since it allowed the use of a\nlarge number of neighborhood structures without a significant increase in the CPU time\nand, consequently, high quality solutions could be achieved in a matter of seconds. In\naddition, we analyzed the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in two other well-known\nmetaheuristics. Further experiments were also carried out on benchmark instances of problem 1|sij| ∑ Tj .\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the\nalgorithms proposed in the literature for solving the problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj . Section 3 describes the proposed local search methodology, including the neighborhood structures and\nthe new limitation strategy. Section 4 presents the computational experiments. Section\n5 contains the concluding remarks of this work."

      "text" : "One of the first methods proposed for problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj was that of Raman et al. (1989). It consists of a constructive heuristic based on a static dispatching rule. Lee et al.\n(1997) later developed a three-phase method, where the first performs a statistical analysis\non the instance to define the parameters to be used, the second is a constructive heuristic\nthat is based on dynamic dispatching rule called Apparent Tardiness Cost with Setups\n(ATCS), while the third performs a local search by means of insertion and swap moves.\nThe 1|sij| ∑ wjTj literature remained practically unchanged for nearly two decades until Cicirello and Smith (2005) developed five randomized based (meta)heuristic ap-\nproaches, more precisely, Limited Discrepancy Search (LDS); Heuristic-Biased Stochastic\nSampling (HBSS); Value-Biased Stochastic Sampling (VBSS); hill-climbing incorporated\nto VBSS (VBSS-HC) and finally a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. The authors\nalso proposed a set of 120 instances that has become the most used benchmark dataset\nfor the problem. Cicirello (2006) later implemented a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a\nnew operator called Non-Wrapping Order Crossover (NWOX) that maintains not only\nthe relative order of the jobs in a sequence, but also the absolute one.\nThree metaheuristics were implemented by Lin and Ying (2007), more specifically,\nSA, GA and Tabu Search (TS), whereas Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based algo-\nrithms were put forward by Liao and Cheng (2007), Anghinolfi and Paolucci (2008) and\nMandahawi et al. (2011). The latter authors actually developed a variant of ACO, called\nMax-Min Ant System (MMAS), that was capable of generating better solutions when\ncompared to the other two.\nValente and Alves (2008) developed a Beam Search (BS) algorithm, while a Discrete\nParticle Swarm Optimization (DSPO) heuristic was proposed by Anghinolfi and Paolucci\n(2009). Tasgetiren et al. (2009) put forward a Discrete Differential Evolution (DDE) al-\ngorithm that was enhanced by the NEH constructive heuristic of Nawaz et al. (1983)\ncombined with concepts of the metaheuristic Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Pro-\ncedure (GRASP) (Feo and Resende, 1995) and some priority rules such as the Earliest\nWeighted Due Date (EWDD) and ATCS. The authors also implemented destruction and\nconstruction procedures to determine a mutant population. Bożejko (2010) proposed\na parallel Scatter Search (ParSS) algorithm combined with a Path-Relinking scheme.\nChao and Liao (2012) implemented a so-called Discrete Electromagnetism-like Mecha-\nnism (DEM), which is a metaheuristic based on the electromagnetic theory of attraction\nand repulsion.\nKirlik and Oğuz (2012) developed a Generalized Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS)\nalgorithm combined with a Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) procedure for the local\nsearch composed of the following neighborhoods: swap, 2-block insertion and job (1-block)\ninsertion. Xu et al. (2013) suggested an Iterated Local Search (ILS) approach that uses a\nl-block insertion neighborhood structure with l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 18}. The authors empirically\nshowed that this neighborhood was capable of finding better solutions when compared to\njob insertion and 2-block insertion. The perturbation mechanism also applies the same\ntype of move, but with l ∈ {18, 19, . . . , 30}.\nSubramanian et al. (2014) also implemented an ILS algorithm, but combined with a\nRandomized VND procedure (RVND) that uses the neighborhoods insertion, 2-block in-\nsertion, 3-block insertion, swap and block reverse (a.k.a. twist). Diversification moves\nare performed using the double-bridge perturbation (Martin et al., 1991), which was orig-\ninally developed for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). An alternative version of\nthe proposed ILS-RVND algorithm that accepts solutions with same cost during the local\nsearch was suggested. In this latter approach, a tabu list is used to avoid cycling.\nDeng and Gu (2014) put forward an Enhanced Iterated Greedy (EIG) algorithm that\ngenerates an initial solution using the ATCS heuristic, performs local search with swap\nand insertion moves and perturbs a solution by applying successive insertion moves. Some\nelimination rules were also suggested for the swap neighborhood.\nXu et al. (2014) proposed different versions of a Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (HEA)\nby combining two population updating strategies with three crossover operators, including\nthe linear order crossover operator (LOX). The initial population is generated at random\nand a local search is applied using the neighborhood l-block as in Xu et al. (2013). The\nversion that yielded the best results was denoted LOX⊕B. Guo and Tang (2015) suggested\na Scatter Search (SS) based algorithm that combines many ideas from different methods\nsuch as ATCS, VNS and DDE with a new adaptive strategy for updating the reference\nset.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the ILS-RVND heuristic of Subramanian et al. (2014),\nthe ILS of Xu et al. (2013) and the HEA of Xu et al. (2014) are the best algorithms, at least in terms of solution quality, proposed for problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj .\nTanaka and Araki (2013) proposed an exact algorithm, called Successive Sublimation\nDynamic Programming (SSDP), that was capable of solving instances of the benchmark\ndataset of Cicirello and Smith (2005). At first, a column generation or a conjugate subgra-\ndient procedure is applied over the lagrangean relaxation of the original problem, solved\nby dynamic programming. Next, some constraints are added to the relaxation until there\nis no difference between the lower and upper bounds, which increases the number of\nstates in the dynamic programming. Unnecessary states are removed in order to decrease\nthe computational time and the memory used. A branching scheme is integrated to the\nmethod to solve the harder instances. Despite capable of solving all instances to opti-\nmality, the computational time was, on average, rather large, more specifically 32424.55\nseconds, varying from 0.54 seconds to 30 days.\nTable 1 shows a summary of the methods proposed for problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj. For the sake of comparison we also included, when applicable, the neighborhoods used in each\nmethod. It can be observed that most algorithms used the neighborhoods insertion and\nswap. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that almost all population based algorithms\nrely on local search at a given step of the method."

      "heading" : "3.1 Limitation Strategy",
      "text" : "Enumerating and evaluating all moves of a given neighborhood of a 1|sij| ∑ wjTj solution are usually very time consuming, often being the bottleneck of local search based\nalgorithms proposed for this problem. Liao et al. (2012) developed a rather complicated procedure that runs in O(n2logn) time for preprocessing the auxiliary data stuctures nec-\nessary for performing the move evaluation of the neighborhoods swap, insertion and block\nreverse in constant time. Nevertheless, they themselves showed, for example, that for\nthe neighborhood swap, their approach only start to be notably superior for instances\ncontaining more than ≈ 1000 jobs. Therefore, it was thought advisable to use the simple\nand straightforward move evaluation procedures in Section 3.2, even though their resulting overall complexity is O(n3). However, instead of enumerating all possible moves from\neach neighborhood, we decided to evaluate only a subset of them, selected by means of a\nnovel local search limitation strategy.\nOur proposed local search limitation strategy is based on a very simple filtering mech-\nanism that efficiently chooses the neighboring solutions to be evaluated during the search.\nThe criterion used to decide weather a move should be evaluated or not is based on the\nsetup variation of that move, which can be computed in O(1) time. In other words, for\nevery potential move, one computes the setup variation and the move is only considered\nfor evaluation if the variation does not exceed a given threshold value. The motivation\nfor adopting such criterion was based on the empirical observation that the larger the\nincrease on the total setup of a sequence due to a move, the smaller the probability of\nimprovement on the total weighted tardiness.\nIt is worthy of note that, very recently, Guo and Tang (2015) had independently de-\nveloped a similar but not identical approach to disregard unpromising moves based on\nthe total setup time instead of the setup variation. More specifically, moves are not con-\nsidered for evaluation if the total setup time of a solution to be evaluated is greater than\na threshold value that is computed by multiplying the average setup of the instance by\na random number selected from the interval between 0.2 and 0.3. However, they did not\nreport any result of the impact of this strategy on the performance of the local search.\nLet N be the set of neighborhoods used in a local search algorithm. A threshold value\nmax∆sv for the setup variation is assigned for each neighborhood v ∈ N , meaning that a move from a neighborhood v ∈ N will only be evaluated if its associated setup variation\nis smaller than or equal to max∆sv . Since an adequate value for each max∆sv may be highly sensitive to the instance data as well as the neighborhood, we did not impose any\npredetermined value for them. Instead, they are estimated during a learning phase, when\na preliminary local search is performed without any filter.\nThe learning phase occurs during the first iterations of the local search. Initially,\nmax∆sv, ∀v ∈ N , is set to a sufficiently large number M so as to allow the evaluation of any move, i.e., no filter is applied at this stage. Let ∆sv, ∀v ∈ N , be a list composed of the values of the setup variations associated to each improving move of a particular\nneighborhood. This list is updated with the addition of a new value every time an\nimproving move occurs.\nAt the end of the learning phase, the list ∆sv, ∀v ∈ N , is sorted in ascending order. Define θ as an input parameter, where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1. The element from this ordered list\nassociated to the position ⌊θ · |∆sv|⌋ is then chosen as threshold value for the parameter max∆sv, ∀v ∈ N . Note that the larger the θ, the larger the max∆sv and thus more moves are likely to be evaluated, leading to a more conservative limitation policy.\nConsider an example where ∆sswap = [−6,−4,−4,−2, 0, 1, 4, 7, 12, 20]. If θ = 0.95, then ⌊θ · |∆sv|⌋ = ⌊0.95 · 10⌋ = 9. The value of the parameter max∆sswap will thus be the one associated with the position 9 of ∆sswap, that is, max∆sswap = 12.\nNote that one need not necessarily perform an exhaustive local search, i.e. enumerate\nall possibles moves from a neighborhood during the learning phase. What is really relevant\nis the size of the list ∆sv. On one hand, if the size of the sample (|∆sv|) is too small and not really representative, then an inaccurate value for max∆sv will be estimated. On the other hand, storing a large sample may imply in spending a considerable amount\nof iterations in the learning phase, which can dramatically affect the performance of the\nalgorithm in terms of CPU time.\nThe presented limitation strategy can be easily embedded into any local search based\nmetaheuristic. For example, in case of multi-start metaheuristics such as GRASP, one can\nconsider the learning phase (i.e., perform the search without any filters) only for a given\nnumber of preliminary iterations before triggering the limitation scheme. In case of other\nmetaheuristics that systematically alternate between intensification and diversification\nsuch as TS, VNS and ILS, one can choose different stopping criteria for the learning\nphase such as the number of calls to the local search procedure or even a time limit.\nPopulation based metaheuristics that rely on local search for obtaining good solutions\ncan also employ a similar scheme."

      "heading" : "3.2 Neighborhood structures",
      "text" : "In order to better describe the neighborhood structures employed during the local search\nwe use the following block representation. Let π = {π0, π1, π2, . . . , πn} be an arbitrary sequence composed of n jobs, where π0 = 0 is a dummy job that is used for considering the setup s0π1 required for processing the first job of the sequence. A given block B can be defined as a subsequence of consecutive jobs. Figure 1 shows an example of a sequence of\n10 jobs (plus the dummy job) divided into 4 blocks, namely B0 = π0, B1 = {π1, π2, π3, π4}, B2 = {π5, π6, π7} and B3 = {π8, π9, π10}.\nLet a and b be the position of the first and last jobs of a block Bt in the sequence, respectively, and let b′ be the position of the last job of the predecessor block Bt−1 in the sequence with associated completion time C b′. The cost of the block Bt, i.e., its total weighted tardiness, can be computed in O(|Bt|) steps as shown in Alg. 1. Note that if |Bt| = 1, the procedure will not execute the loop from a + 1 to b described in lines 7-12\nbecause in this case a = b which implies in b < a + 1.\nAlgorithm 1 CompCostBlock\n1: Procedure CompCostBlock(b′, a, b, π, C b′) 2: cost ← 0 3: Ctemp ← C b′ + sπ\nb′ πa + pπa ⊲ Global variable that stores a temporary completion time\n4: if Ctemp > dπa then ⊲ dπa is the due date of job πa 5: cost← wπa × (Ctemp− dπa ) ⊲ wπa is the weight of job πa 6: end if 7: for a′ = a + 1 . . . b do 8: Ctemp← Ctemp + sπ\na′−1 π a′ + pπ a′\n9: if Ctemp > dπ a′ then\n10: cost← cost+ wπ a′ × (Ctemp − dπ a′ ) 11: end if 12: end for 13: return cost 14: end CompCostBlock.\nIt is easy to verify that the total cost of a sequence can be obtained by the sum of the\ncosts of the blocks defined for that sequence. In the example given in Fig. 1 the total\ncost of the sequence is equal to the sum of the cost of blocks B0, B1, B2 and B3.\nWhen performing move evaluations it is quite useful to define an auxiliary data struc-\nture that stores the cumulated weighted tardiness up to a certain position of the sequence.\nTherefore, we have decided to define an array g for that purpose. For example, the el-\nement g5 of the array stores the cumulated weighted tardiness up to the 5th position of the sequence.\nWe now proceed to a detailed description of the neighborhood structures used in our\napproach.\n3.2.1 Swap\nThe swap neighborhood structure simply consists of exchanging the position of two jobs in\nthe sequence, as depicted in Figure 2. It is possible to observe that the modified solution\ncan be divided into 6 blocks. Alg. 2 shows how to compute the cost of a solution in\nO(n− i) steps. Note that one can always assume that i < j for every swap move.\nAlgorithm 2 CompCostSwap\n1: Procedure CompCostSwap(π, i, j, g, C) 2: f ← gi−1 ⊲ Variable that stores the cost to be evaluated 3: Ctemp ← Cπi−1 4: f ← f + CompCostBlock(i− 1, j, j, π, Ctemp) ⊲ Cost of block 4 5: f ← f + CompCostBlock(j, i+ 1, j − 1, π, Ctemp) ⊲ Cost of block 3 6: f ← f + CompCostBlock(j − 1, i, i, π, Ctemp) ⊲ Cost of block 2 7: f ← f + CompCostBlock(i, j + 1, n, π,Ctemp) ⊲ Cost of block 5 8: return f 9: end CompCostSwap.\nAlg. 3 presents the pseudocode of the neighborhood swap considering the limitation strategy described in Section 3.1. At first, the best sequence π∗ is considered to be the\nsame as the original one, i.e., π (line 2). Next, for every pair of positions i and j (with\nj > i) of π (lines 3-16), the setup variation is computed in constant time (line 5). If this\nvariation is smaller than or equal to max∆sswap (lines 6-14), then the cost of sequence π′, which is a neighbor of π generated by exchanging the position of customers πi and πj , is computed using Alg. 2 (line 7). In case of improvement (lines 6-13), the best current\nsolution is updated (line 9) and if the learning phase is activated, that is, if max∆sswap = M , list ∆sswap is updated by adding the value associated to the setup variation computed in line 5 (lines 10-12). Finally, the procedure returns the best sequence π∗ found during\nthe search (line 17).\nAlgorithm 3 Swap\n1: Procedure Swap(π, g, C,∆sswap, max∆sswap) 2: π∗ ← π; f∗ ← f(π); 3: for i = 1 . . . n− 1 do 4: for j = i+ 1 . . . n do 5: setupV ariation = −sπi−1πi − sπiπi+1 − sπj−1πj − sπjπj+1\n+sπi−1πj + sπjπi+1 + sπj−1πi + sπiπj+1 6: if setupV ariation ≤ max∆sswap then 7: f(π′) = CompCostSwap(π, i, j, l, g, C) ⊲ π′ is a neighbor of π 8: if f(π′) < f∗ then 9: π∗ ← π′; f∗ ← f(π′) 10: if max∆sswap = M then ⊲ Learning phase activated 11: ∆sswap ← ∆sswap ∪ setupV ariation 12: end if 13: end if 14: end if 15: end for 16: end for 17: return π∗; 18: end Swap.\n3.2.2 l-block insertion\nThe l-block insertion neighborhood consists of moving a block of length l forward (i < j)\nor backward (i > j), as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. In this case the resulting\nsolution in both cases can be represented by 5 blocks. Algs. 4 and 5 describe how to\nevaluate a cost of moving a block forward and backward in O(n− i) and O(n− j) steps,\nrespectively.\nunder evaluation is already worse than the best current cost. If so, the evaluation can\nbe interrupted because it is already known that the solution under evaluation cannot be\nbetter than the current one. In some cases this may help speeding up the move evaluation\nprocess.\nLet L be a set composed of different values for the parameter l. In practice one can\ndefine a single neighborhood considering all values of l ∈ L at once (see Xu et al. (2013)),\nor define multiple neighborhoods where each of them is associated with a given value of\nl ∈ L. In our implementation we decided for the latter option.\nAlg. 6 shows the pseudocode of the neighborhood l-block taking into account the\nlimitation strategy described earlier. This algorithm, which is divided into two parts,\nfollows the same rationale of Alg. 3 in both of them. The main difference is related to\nthe range of the positions i and j, which depends on the value of l. In part one (lines\n3-16) the search is performed forward, whereas in part 2 it is performed backward (lines\n17-30).\nAlgorithm 6 l-blockInsertion\n1: Procedure l-blockInsertion(π, l, g, C,∆sl-block,max∆sl-block) 2: π∗ ← π; f∗ ← f(π); ⊲ Moving the l-block forward 3: for i = 1 . . . n− l do 4: for j = i+ 1 . . . n do 5: setupV ariation = −sπi−1πi − sπi−1+lπi+l − sπjπj+1\n+sπi−1πi+l + sπjπi + sπi−1+lπj+1 6: if setupV ariation ≤ max∆sl-block then 7: f(π′) = CompCostl-blockF(π, i, j, l, g, C) ⊲ π′ is a neighbor of π 8: if f(π′) < f∗ then 9: π∗ ← π′; f∗ ← f(π′) 10: if max∆sl-block = M then ⊲ Learning phase activated 11: ∆sl-block ← ∆sl-block ∪ setupV ariation; 12: end if 13: end if 14: end if 15: end for 16: end for ⊲ Moving the l-block backward 17: for i = 2 . . . n− l + 1 do 18: for j = 1 . . . i− 1 do 19: setupV ariation = −sπj−1πj − sπi−1πi − sπi−1+lπi+1 +sπj−1πi + sπj−1+lπj + sπi−1πi+1 20: if setupV ariation ≤ max∆sl-block then 21: f(π′) = CompCostl-blockB(π, i, j, l, g, C) ⊲ π′ is a neighbor of π 22: if f(π′) < f∗ then 23: π∗ ← π′; f∗ ← f(π′) 24: if max∆sl-block = M then ⊲ Learning phase activated 25: ∆sl-block ← ∆sl-block ∪ setupV ariation 26: end if 27: end if 28: end if 29: end for 30: end for 31: return π∗; 32: end l-blockInsertion."

      "text" : "In this section we explain how we embedded the proposed approach in the ILS-RVND\nmetaheuristic (Subramanian, 2012). The reason for choosing this metaheuristic to test our\nlocal search limitation strategy is that it was found capable of generating highly competitive results not only for problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj (Subramanian et al., 2014), as mentioned in Section 2, but also for other combinatorial optimization problems (Subramanian et al.,\n2010; Subramanian, 2012; Silva et al., 2012; Penna et al., 2013; Subramanian and Battarra,\n2013; Martinelli et al., 2013; Vidal et al., 2015). Moreover, the referred method relies on\nvery few parameters and it can be considered relatively simple, which makes it quite\npractical and also easy to implement.\nAlg. 7 highlights the differences between the original version of ILS-RVND and a\nnew one, called ILS-RVNDFast, that includes the additional steps (line 3 and lines 17- 22) described in Section 3.1 for speeding up the the local search. It can be observed\nthat the learning phase is limited to the first iteration of the algorithm, where the list\n∆sv, ∀v ∈ N , is populated during the local search (line 9). The value of max∆sv, ∀v ∈ N is then estimated after the end of the first iteration. Parameters IR and IILS correspond to the number of restarts of the metaheuristic and the number of consecutive ILS itera-\ntions without improvements, respectively. An exception occurs during the learning phase,\nwhich is more costly, where the number of ILS iterations is IILS/2. In both algorithms the initial solution (line 5) is generated using a simple randomized insertion heuristic,\nwhereas the perturbation (line 14) is performed by a mechanism called double-bridge,\nwhich consists of exchanging two blocks of a sequence at random. The reader is referred\nto Subramanian et al. (2014) for implementation details about these procedures.\nThe local search method of both algorithms is performed by a RVND procedure, which\nconsists of selecting an unexplored neighborhood at random whenever another one fails to\nfind an improved solution. In case of improvement, all neighborhoods are reconsidered to\nbe explored. Note that in both algorithms the set L associated to the l-block neighborhood\nis provided as an input parameter to be tuned (see Section 4.1), as opposed to the ILS-\nRVND presented in Subramanian et al. (2014) where this set was predefined as L =\n{1, 2, 3}, that is, the l-block neighborhoods were limited to 1-, 2- and 3-block insertion.\nIn addition, the neighborhood block reverse was also used in a restricted fashion by the\nauthors, but it was not considered here because it did not seem to be crucial for obtaining\nhigh quality solutions.\nOne last remark is that the algorithm stops when a sequence π with cost f(π) = 0 is\nfound. When this happens it is clear that an optimal solution was obtained and thus there\nis no point in continuing the search. This was not originally considered in the ILS-RVND\npresented in Subramanian et al.

(2014), that is, IILS = 4 × n. However, since each iteration of the algorithm became much faster after implementing the limitation strategy (see Section 4.3)\nwe decided to set IR = 20, instead of IR = 10, as in Subramanian et al. (2014), because it seemed to provide a better compromise between solution quality and computational time.\nA set of 17 challenging instances was selected for tuning the parameters L and θ, namely\ninstances 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8. 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 and 24. The criterion used for\nchoosing these instances was based on the difficulty faced by the ILS-RVND implemented\nin Subramanian et al. (2014) in finding their corresponding optimal solutions.\nLet Best Gap be the gap between the best solution found in 10 runs and the optimal\nsolution; Worst Gap be the gap between the worst solution found in 10 runs and the\noptimal solution; and Avg. Gap be the average gap between the average solution of 10\nruns and the optimal solution. In the tables presented hereafter, Arithm. Mean of Best\nGaps (%) corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the Best Gaps, Geom. Mean of Avg.\nGaps (%) denotes the geometric mean of the Avg. Gaps, Geom. Mean of Worst Gaps (%)\nindicates the geometric mean of the Worst Gaps and Arithm. Mean of Avg. Time (s) is\nthe arithmetic mean of the average times in seconds. Given a set of q positive numbers,\nthe geometric mean can be defined as the qth root of the product of all numbers of the\nset. The reason for using the geometric mean is because it normalizes the different ranges,\nthat is, the possible significant differences among the Gaps. Hence, the geometric mean\nwas adopted in some of the cases as an attempt to perform a fair comparison between the\nsolutions found for each configuration tested. However, we used the arithmetic mean for\nthe Best Gaps because in many cases the best solution found coincided with the optimal\nsolution. In this case, the gap is equal to zero and thus the value is disregarded from the\ncomputation of the geometric mean, which may result in a misleading result when many\nvalues are not considered.\nWe have tested 34 different combination of neighborhoods, more precisely, we consid-\nered L = {1, . . . , 4} to L = {1, . . . , 20} incrementing one l-block neighborhood at a time\nand we tried each possibility with and without swap. Therefore, the goal of this exper-\niment was not only to calibrate the parameter L, but also to investigate the benefits of\nincluding the neighborhood swap. For this testing, we have arbitrarily set θ = 0.90 and we\nran the algorithm 10 times for each instance. Table 3 shows the average results obtained\nfor the 17 instances mentioned above with the different combinations of neighborhoods.\nWe decided to adopt the configuration L = {1, . . . , 13} + swap because it seemed to offer\na good balance between solution quality and computational time.\nFive different values for the parameter θ was tested, in particular, 0,80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95\nand 1.00, and the results can be found in Table 4. As expected, it can be observed that the\naverage computational time is directly proportional to θ since more moves are considered\nfor evaluation as the value of θ increases. Note that θ = 1.00 implies that max∆sv is equal to the largest setup variation associated to an improving move of neighborhood\nv ∈ N that occurred during the learning phase. We decided to adopt θ = 0.90 because\nsolutions of similar quality were obtained when compared to θ = 1.00, but approximately\nfour times faster."

Moreover, it is\npossible to verify that the mean of the average times of ILS-RVNDFast was approximately 13 seconds.\nTable 6 presents a summary of the results found by ILS-RVNDFast compared with those achieved by several heuristics from the literature. A direct comparison with some\nof the algorithms such as ACOAP, DPSO, DDE and GVNS becomes quite hard because the average results were not reported by the authors. With respect to the best solutions,\nour algorithm clearly outperforms these four by a good margin. Even our average and\nworst solutions are, in most cases, better or equal than the best ones of such methods.\nThe average and worst solutions of ILS-RVNDFast are always equal or better than the average solutions of ILSXLC. The same happened to ILS-RVNDSBP and LOX⊕B, except for few cases where the worst solutions of ILS-RVNDFast were not better than the average solution of these two methods. Worst solutions were only reported for ILS-\nRVNDSBP, where all them are either equal or worse than those of ILS-RVNDFast. The results suggest that our algorithm is very competitive in terms of solution quality.\nsolutions found by the algorithms that were chosen for comparison. In this case the\nstopping criterion no longer depends on the number of restarts, but on a target value\nfrom the literature. The algorithm was executed 10 times for each instance and we report\nthe mean (arithmetic), median, minimum and maximum of the average times by group\nrequired to find or improve the target value. We also report the average values considering\nall instances at once (last column of the table).\nOn one hand, it can be observed from Table 7 that ILS-RVNDFast was capable of finding or improving the best solutions of ACOAP, DPSO, DDE, GVNS and ILS-RVNDSBP in\nonly 2.0, 2.8, 4.6, 6.2 and 7.9 seconds, on average, respectively. On the other hand,\nILS-RVNDFast spent, on average, 32.6, 158.3 and 161.2 seconds to find or improve the best solutions of ILSXLC, LOX⊕B and the optimal solutions, respectively. However, if we disregard instance 24, these values significantly decrease to 9.2, 18.0 and 20.9 seconds,\nrespectively.\nMoreover, ILS-RVNDFast found or improved the average solutions of ILSXLC, ILSRVNDSBP and LOX⊕B in only 1.9, 4.1 and 3.0 seconds, respectively, on average. It is worth mentioning that the average solutions of ILSXLC in Xu et al. (2013) and LOX⊕B in Xu et al. (2014) were obtained in 100 seconds on an Intel Core i3 3.10 GHz with 2.0 GB\nof RAM, whereas the average solutions of ILS-RVNDSBP were obtained in 23.4 seconds on an Intel Core i5 3.20 GHz with 4.0 GB of RAM. The hardware configuration of these two\nmachines is slightly inferior than the one used in our experiments (Intel Core i7 with 3.40\nGHz and 16 GB of RAM), and thus does not justify the considerable difference in terms of\nCPU time between ILS-RVNDFast and the three other methods. Therefore, from Tables 5-7, we can conclude that ILS-RVNDFast is, on average, remarkably faster and clearly more efficient than those three heuristic algorithms, which are the best ones available in the literature for problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj ."

      "heading" : "5 Concluding Remarks",
      "text" : "In this paper we proposed a simple but very efficient local search limitation strategy for problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj. This strategy aims at speeding up the local search process by avoiding evaluations of unpromising moves. The setup variation is used to estimate\nwhether or not a move should be evaluated. In particular, a move is only evaluated if\nthe setup variation is smaller than a given threshold value, which in turn depends on the\ncharacteristics of the instance and on the neighborhood structure. Therefore, instead of\ntuning a value for this threshold a priori, we developed a procedure that automatically\nestimates a value for this parameter. Furthermore, we presented a detailed description of\nhow the limitation strategy can be incorporated into the neighborhoods swap and l-block\ninsertion.\nThe proposed approach was embedded in the ILS-RVND algorithm Subramanian\n(2012), which is a simple local search based metaheuristic that was successfully applied to many combinatorial optimization problems, including the 1|sij| ∑ wjTj Subramanian et al. (2014). This enhanced version of the algorithm was denoted as ILS-RVNDFast. Extensive computational experiments were carried out on well-known benchmark instances and the\nresults obtained suggest that ILS-RVNDFast is capable of producing extremely competitive results both in terms of average solutions and CPU time. When analyzing the impact\nof the limitation strategy, it was possible to confirm that the high speedups achieved did\nnot come at the expense of solution quality. As a result, a considerable number of neigh-\nborhoods could be used without significantly increasing the CPU time, which was crucial\nfor the high performance of ILS-RVNDFast.\nWe performed similar experiments with standard and non-tailored implementations of\nother well-known local search based metaheuristics, namely GRASP and VNS, and the\nversions with the limitation strategy were approximately 2 times faster, without significant\nloss in solution quality, than those without the inclusion of such strategy. Finally, we also performed experiments with ILS-RVNDFast on benchmark instances of problem 1|sij| ∑ Tj and the results obtained ratified the effectiveness of the limitation strategy in a related\nproblem."

(2012) presented a sophisticated method that reduces the complexity of enumerating and evaluating all moves from the aforementioned neighborhoods from O(n) to O(nlogn). However, in practice, this procedure is only useful for very large instances. For example, they showed empirically that the advantage of using their approach for the neighborhood swap starts to be visibly significant only for instances with more than around 1000 jobs. The aim of this work is to develop a simple yet effective strategy that speeds up the local search procedure without a significant loss in the solution quality. Such strategy consists of a filtering mechanism that prevents unpromising moves to be evaluated. The idea behind this approach relies on a measurement that must be computed at runtime. In our case, we use the setup variation, which can be computed in O(1) time to estimate if a move is promising or not to be evaluated. Moreover, the bottleneck of traditional implementations limits the number of neighborhoods to be explored in the local search. Our proposed strategy enables the use of a large number of neighborhoods, such as moving blocks of consecutive jobs, which is likely to lead to high quality solutions. In fact, Xu et al. (2013) showed that this type of neighborhood may indeed lead to better solutions for problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj .",

    "abstractText" : "This paper concerns the single machine total weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setup times, usually referred as 1|sij | ∑ wjTj . In this NP-hard problem, each job has an associated processing time, due date and a weight. For each pair of jobs i and j, there may be a setup time before starting to process j in case this job is scheduled immediately after i. The objective is to determine a schedule that minimizes the total weighted tardiness, where the tardiness of a job is equal to its completion time minus its due date, in case the job is completely processed only after its due date, and is equal to zero otherwise. Due to its complexity, this problem is most commonly solved by heuristics. The aim of this work is to develop a simple yet effective limitation strategy that speeds up the local search procedure without a significant loss in the solution quality. Such strategy consists of a filtering mechanism that prevents unpromising moves to be evaluated. The proposed strategy has been embedded in a local search based metaheuristic from the literature and tested in classical benchmark instances. Computational experiments revealed that the limitation strategy enabled the metaheuristic to be extremely competitive when compared to other algorithms from the literature, since it allowed the use of a large number of neighborhood structures without a significant increase in the CPU time and, consequently, high quality solutions could be achieved in a matter of seconds. In addition, we analyzed the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in two other well-known metaheuristics. Further experiments were also carried out on benchmark instances of problem 1|sij | ∑ Tj .",
