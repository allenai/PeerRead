Most of machine learning methods perform inaccurately or produce misleading results when data suffers from lack of quality. Limitation of measuring instruments, human error in the data equation process may lower data quality. In some cases, the value of a feature may be missing. In other cases, the data may be contaminated by external sources and not indicating their real value [2].\nOne of main issues is the context of data quality is the presence of outliers. Outliers are instances which have considerable difference with the majority of instances. Another outlier definition from [1] is: A sample (or subset of samples) which appears to be inconsistent with the rest of that data set. An outlier may also be surprising veridical data, a sample belonging to class ω1 but actually positioned inside class ω2 so the true (veridical) classification of the sample is surprising to the observer (this type of outlier is also called label noise).\nThe presence of outliers may cause potential problems in both supervised and unsupervised learning. The most significant consequence of label noise is degradation of classification performance [12], [13]. For example it is shown that only 5% of outliers can highly deviate the decision boundaries. In [3] SVMs, ridge regression, and logistic regressions are tested is the presence of outliers. The experiments show that the results are highly affected by outliers for all three methods.\nMoreover, outliers may cause over-fitting on training data. The presence of outliers also increases the required number of instances for learning, as well as the complexity of models [11]. In [14] it is shown that the removal of outliers reduces the number of support vectors. Non-robust classifier methods\nproduce models which are skewed when outliers are left in. An example of a data set suffering from outliers is illustrated in Fig. 1. The outliers are indicated by small red circles around.\nThere are various methods for detection of outliers [6]. In this paper we focus on proximity-based techniques including k-NN-based methods. These methods are simple to implement and make no prior assumptions about the data distribution model.\nRamaswamy et al. introduced an optimized k-NN to produce a ranked list of potential outliers [4]. A sample is an outlier if no more than n − 1 other points in the data set have a higher Dm (distance to mth neighbor) where m is a user-specified parameter. Since most of k-NN based approaches are susceptible to the computational growth several techniques were proposed for speeding the k-NN algorithm such as partitioning the data into cells. If any cell and its adjacent cells contains more than k points, then the points in the cell are probably lied in a dense area of the distribution so the points contained are unlikely to be outliers.\nAnother proximity-based variant is the graph connectivity method. Shekhar et al. introduced an approach for traffic monitoring which views the outlier issue from a topologically perspective [5]. Shekhar detects traffic monitoring stations producing sensor values which are inconsistent with stations in the connected neighborhood. A station is an outlier if the\ndifference between its sensor value and the average sensor value of its topological neighbors differs significantly from the mean difference between all nodes and their topological neighbors.\nKnorr and Ng (1998) introduced an efficient type 1 k-NN approach. If m of the k nearest neighbors (where m < k) lie within a specific distance threshold d then the exemplar is deemed to lie in a sufficiently dense region of the data distribution to be classified as normal. However, if there are less than m neighbors inside the distance threshold then the exemplar is an outlier.\nSeveral problems are accompanying with k-NN based approaches. Most of k-NN based approaches only view data locally. This approach may fail when there are batches of outliers in data set. Another approach is to have a global view of samples. In global view, samples with large distance from the distribution of samples are detected as outlier. A potential problem however is the determination of a threshold. An inappropriate threshold may lead to detection of a correct sample as outlier.\nIn this paper a new kNN-based method for dealing with outliers is proposed. The proposed method solves the problems of kNN-based method by combining the local and global views of samples.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents our method for outlier absorbing. In Section 3 the experimental results are investigated and finaly section 4 give the concluding remarks."

Let Ωx,k be the set of all k nearest neighborhoods and xkNNi be the nearest neighbors of instance xi.

In other words\nf(xt|xt−1, xt−2, ...) = f(xt|xt−1) (2)\nThe main notion of Markovian property is that when a state xt−1 explicitly contains the information of other states {xt−2, xt−2, ...}, these states can be ignored. This property holds when the states have a temporal nature. We are looking for a same property when the states have a spatial nature. Similar to Markovian assumption, if a set of samples S1 contains the information of another set S2 it is reasonable to ignore set S2. Fore example, consider two sets Ω −i x,k and xkNNi . Each instance in x kNN i can be represented by its k nearest neighbors in Ω−ix,k thus a Markovian-like property holds for these two sets. Along with our problem formulation, we will use this Markovian-like property."

The recent equation is the representation of an instance based on its k nearest neighbors which means a representation based on a local view to samples.\nLet f(Ωx|Ωx,k) be the PDF of Ωx given the set of all k nearest neighborhoods and suppose that wi(x), the weight of instance xi be defined as:\nwi(x) = f(Ωx|Ωx,k)\nq(Ωx|Ωx,k) (6)\nWe can decompose f(Ωx|Ωx,k) as follow:\nf(Ωx|Ωx,k) = f(xi,Ω\n−i x ,Ω −i x,k ,xkNN i ) f(Ωx,k)\n= f(xkNNi |xi,Ω −i x ,Ω −i x,k)f(xi|Ω −i x ,Ω −i x,k)f(Ω −i x |Ω −i x,k)f(Ω −i x,k)\nf(Ωx,k) (7)\nIf the number of samples are sufficiently large, we can assume f(Ωx,k) ≃ f(Ω −i x,k), thus\nf(Ωx|Ωx,k) ∝ f(x kNN i |xi,Ω −i x ,Ω −i x,k)f(xi|Ω −i x ,Ω −i x,k)f(Ω −i x |Ω −i x,k) (8) and by Markovian-like assumption\nf(Ωx|Ωx,k) ∝ f(x kNN i |Ω −i x )f(xi|Ω −i x )f(Ω −i x |Ω −i x,k) (9)\nUsing a slightly different decomposition for q(Ωx|Ωx,k) we can write:\nq(Ωx|Ωx,k) = q(Ω−ix ,xi,Ωx,k)\nq(Ωx,k)\n= q(xi|Ω\n−i x ,Ωx,k)q(Ω −i x |Ωx,k)q(Ωx,k)\nq(Ωx,k)\n= q(xi|Ω −i x ,Ωx,k)q(Ω −i x |Ωx,k) (10)\nBy Markovian-like assumption:\nq(Ω−ix |Ωx,k) ≃ q(Ω −i x |Ω −i x,k)q(x kNN i |Ω −i x,k) (11)\n(Look at the Appendix for details).

A realization of f(zi|Ω−iz ) could be obtained using GMMs (Gaussian mixture models). The steps of the proposed algorithm for label denoising is presented as follows:\nOutlier absorbibg based on a Bayesian approach • Input: Data matrix X ∈ ℜn×d\n• Initialization: Set the weights of all samples to 1 n , where n is the number of samples. • Step 1: Update the weights using equation 16. • Step 2: For each instance z, estimate ẑ with respect to\nweights of its neighbors using equation 5 and update z with the estimation. • Step 3: If Div(f itn(Ωz |Ωz,k)||f itn−1(Ωz |Ωz,k)) < ǫ or maximum numbers of iterations reached, then terminate, otherwise go to Step 1. • Output: Denoised data set"

These smaples are obtained by adding Gaussian noise to randomly selected samples. The evaluation of the proposed method is performed in the presence of outlier with different percentages including 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%. A demonstration of the case with 10% outliers is shown in Fig. 2.\n2) Non-linear distribution: A challenging case in outlier detection problem is the case of non-liner data. An example of a non-liner distribution is illustrated in Fig. 3. As our experiments show, out proposed method for outlier absorbing is also robust for these types of distributions.

Pen digit data set as of one UCI data sets is choosed for the evaluation [7].\n1) Evaluation metric: The goal of a denoising method is to recover the real distribution of data from the noisy one. Therefore the resulting distribution should close to the real distribution. In order to measure the diffrence between the resulting and real distributions, Divergence is employed. Divergence distance measures the similarity of two probability distributions [15].\nDpq = E{ln p(x)\nq(x) } =\n∫ p(x)ln p(x)\nq(x) dx (17)\nsimilar discussion holds for class ω2\nDqp = E{ln q(x)\np(x) } =\n∫ q(x)ln q(x)\np(x) dx (18)\nThe sum\nd = Dpq +Dqp (19)\nis called divergence and can be used as a discriminatory measure for the distributions p and q.\nAssuming that the density functions are Gaussians N (µp,Σp) and N (µq,Σq), the divergence can be computed as:\ndpq = 1 2 trace{Σ −1 p Σq +Σ −1 q Σp − 2I}\n+ 1\n2 (µp − µq)\nT (Σ−1p +Σ −1 q )(µp − µq) (20)\nBy the above definitions, the Divergence value for the real distribution and denoised distribution should be a minimum as possible for a good denoising method. The values of\nDivergence between the two distributions for different rates of outliers are summarized in Table I. As it can be seen, the proposed method yeilds distribution for which the Diverence value between them and the real distribution of the sample is small.\nIn Fig. 6 an illustration of the performance of the proposed method on Pen digits data set is provided. Fig. 6.a) illustrates the Pen digits data set in 3 dimension. Fig. 6.b) show the data set with 10% outliers and in Fig. 6.c) the data set is shown after outlier absorbing."
