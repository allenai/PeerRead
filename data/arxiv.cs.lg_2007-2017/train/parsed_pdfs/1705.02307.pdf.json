      "text" : "Index Terms—Time-Vertex Signal Processing, Graph Signal Processing, Partial Differential Equations\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWhether examining consensus and rumor spreading over social networks [1]–[3], transportation networks [4] and related epidemic spreading [5], neuronal activation patterns [6] or time-evolving functional network in the brain [7], as well as other datasets collected from a variety of fields, such as physics, engineering, and lifescience, much of the high-dimensional data exhibit complex non-euclidean properties.\nAn emerging way to deal with these issues is to use a graph to capture the structure underlying the data. This has been the driving force behind recent efforts in the signal processing field to extend harmonic analysis to graph signals, i.e., signals supported on the vertices of irregular graphs [8], [9]. In the field of graph signal processing (GSP), the introduction of the graph Fourier transform (GFT) has enabled us to perform harmonic analysis taking into account the structure of the data, and has lead to improvements for tasks such as clustering [10], low-rank extraction [11], spectral\nestimation [12], [13], non-stationary analysis [14], [15] and semi-supervised learning [16], [17].\nNevertheless, though state-of-the-art graph-based methods have been successful for many tasks, so far they predominantly ignore the time-dimension of data, for example by treating successive signals independently or performing a global average [6], [12], [18]. On the contrary, many of the systems to which GSP is applied to are inherently dynamic. Consider for instance a road network, and suppose that we want to infer traffic conditions given flow information over a subset of highways and streets. Approaches that do not take into account the temporal evolution of traffic will be biased by seasonal variations and unable to provide insights about transient phenomena, such as rush hour traffic, bottlenecks caused by blockage, and stop waves.\nRecently, several ideas begin to emerge related to the analysis of time-varying graph signals, such as Joint time-vertex Fourier transform (JFT) [19] and the joint time-vertex filters [20] and filterbanks [21]. While these constitute notable contributions, we argue that the potential of joint harmonic analysis is yet unexplored, both in terms of its foundations, algorithms, and applications.\nIn this work we aim at elevating the notion of joint harmonic analysis to a full-fledged framework, referred to as the Time-Vertex Signal Processing Framework, that links together the time-domain signal processing techniques with the new tools of GSP.\nThis entails the following contributions: 1. Connection to PDEs. We illustrate how joint analysis emerges when analyzing the state evolution of simple Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on graphs (Section III-A). We also provide an example (epidemic spreading) demonstrating that the joint frequency analysis can be meaningful for the study non-linear and stochastic processes leading to a compact and intuitive representation (Section III-B). 2. Accurate fast joint filtering. In Section IV we illustrate the utility of joint filtering time-vertex signals and propose a fast filtering implementation, called Fast Fourier-Chebyshev (FFC) algorithm, which significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art filters both in terms of\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n02 30\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 5\nM ay\n2 01\n7\n2 separable and non-separable filtering objectives. For the latter case especially, our numerical experiments show that FFC can yield up to two orders of magnitude smaller approximation error at a similar complexity to previous joint filters. 3. Overcomplete representations. We study redundant time-vertex dictionaries and exploit them for signal analysis and synthesis. The proposed framework includes a frame condition guaranteeing that no information is lost. Two particular cases are: time-vertex wavelets capturing the different scales of the signal components, and the short time-vertex Fourier transform that is useful in determining the local time frequency content of the signal.\n4. Illustrating the utility of time-vertex analysis. Finally, Section VI provides experimental evidence for the utility of joint harmonic analysis in a number of graph-temporal datasets that were up to now not fully exploited, such as dynamic meshes, video and general dynamics over networks. The range of applications covers the classical signal processing problems of denoising, inpainting and compression, but also extends to feature extraction for classification and source localization problems."

      "text" : "The time-vertex framework is intimately linked with the stochastic analysis of multivariate signals and, therefore, with graphical models (e.g. [22] and references therein). The main difference between graphical models and GSP lies in the assumption about the relation between the signal and graph [23]. Graphical models adopt a purely Bayesian setting, where edges denote conditional dependencies between variables. As such, the graph usually is a proxy for the covariance and is learned from the data. On the other hand, GSP assumes that the graph is given and its relation to the signal can be understood through harmonic analysis.\nIn this context, the idea of time-vertex analysis can be traced back to the study [24] aiming to process multi-modal signals with different graphs associated with each of their modalities (i.e., one can consider a timevertex signal as multi-modal, with time and graph being the two modalities). Collaboration between the graph theory and signal processing communities has led to new tools to process and analyze time-varying graphs and signals on a graph, such as multilayer graphs and tensor products of graphs [25]–[27]. The notion of joint timevertex harmonic analysis was further realized in [19] by one of the authors of this work. Therein, the joint Fourier analysis is presented and its properties analyzed in details, together with examples of joint filters. In this work, we leverage these concepts proposing a framework\nin which the joint Fourier transform is just one of the building blocks.\nVisualization, filtering and stationarity. The idea of analyzing the behavior of graph filters with time-varying signals first appeared in [28], showing that graph filters could be analyzed by applying jointly a GFT and a Ztransform and as such they possess a joint frequency response. Since then, we have seen a number of works dealing with time-varying signals on graphs: Authors in [29] propose a method that relies on graph wavelet theory and product graphs to visualize time-varying data defined on the vertices of a graph in order to identify spatial and/or temporal variations. A step towards the graphical model has been carried out by authors in [30]. In this work, authors assume data time dependencies to be modeled by an auto-regressive (AR) process and they propose several algorithms to estimate the network structure capturing the spatio-temporal dependencies and the coefficients of the AR process expressed as graph polynomial filters. In order to deal with the high computational complexity of the eigendecomposition, different filtering approximation algorithms have been proposed, mainly based on polynomials: centralized and distributed joint filter 2D Chebychev polynomial [19], separable rational [20] implementations, and autoregressive models [31].\nFinally, in parallel with this work, the authors extended the notions of time stationarity and the recent graph stationarity [12] to the joint time-vertex domain [32] providing a framework for the statistical signal processing of time-vertex signals. Authors showed that assuming joint stationarity to regularize learning can yield significant accuracy improvements and reduce computational complexity in both estimation and recovery tasks prediction with respect to purely time or graph methods [33], [34]. Despite the relevance of this work to time-vertex analysis, here we focus on the purely deterministic setting."

      "text" : "The main idea of harmonic analysis is to decompose a signal into oscillating modes thanks to the Fourier transform. For instance, one analyses oscillations along the temporal axis by applying the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) independently to each row of X\nDFT{X} = XŪT , (1)\nwhere UT is the normalized DFT matrix defined as\nU∗T (t, k) = e−jωkt√\nT , with ωk = 2π(k − 1) T , (2)\nwith t, k = 1, 2, . . . , T. Similarly, the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) [8], [14], [36] allows us to analyze oscillations along the graph edges. As each column of X represents a time instant, the GFT of X for all t reads\nGFT{X} = X̃ = U∗GX, (3)\nwhere UG is obtained by the eigendecomposition LG = UGΛGU ∗ G of the graph Laplacian. As UG is orthonormal, the inverse Fourier transform becomes GFT-1{X̃} = X = UGX̃ . This spectral decomposition gives rise to a graph-specific notion of frequency as their squared modulus corresponds the Laplacian eigenvalue ΛG(`, `) = λ`.\nHarmonic time-vertex analysis amounts to analyzing oscillations jointly along both the time and the vertex dimensions. Hence, assuming a non-varying graph in time, the joint time-vertex Fourier transform, or JFT for short, is obtained by applying the GFT on the graph dimension and the DFT along the time dimension [19]\nX̂(`, k) = 1√ T N∑ n=1 T∑ t=1 X(n, t)u∗` (n)e −jωkt.\nThe above expression can be conveniently rewritten in matrix form as\nX̂ = JFT{X} = U∗GXUT .

These will help us (a) to perform calculus on a finite, discrete time and space, and (b) to characterize the properties of the signals, such as smoothness, while taking into account the intrinsic structure of the data domain.\nTime and vertex domains. Before introducing the timevertex operators, we momentarily diverge by presenting the standard definitions in the time and graph domains. The main discrete calculus operator in time is the first order difference operator\nX∇T |t = xt − xt−1,\ntaken here with periodic boundary conditions. Hence, the symmetric time Laplacian matrix LT = ∇∗T∇T is the discrete second order derivative in time with reversed sign\nXLT |t = −xt+1 + 2xt − xt−1 (7)\nwith xt+1 = x1. As a circulant matrix, it has eigendecomposition LT = UTΛTU∗T , where\nΛT (k, k) = 2 (1− cos (ωk)) . (8)\nThe operator corresponding to the time derivative in the vertex is the edge derivative. Given a graph signal x ∈ RN , the edge derivative with respect to edge e = (n,m) at vertex n is given by\n∂X\n∂e ∣∣∣∣ n = √ W (n,m) [xn − xm] . (9)\nTherefore the graph gradient of x at vertex n is ∇Gx|n = { ∂x\n∂e ∣∣∣∣ n } e∈E\n(10)\nand, as before, LG = ∇∗G∇G, where ∇∗G is the divergence operator of the graph.\n4 Joint domain. We define the joint gradient of a timevertex signal X by concatenation of the time and graph gradients:\n∇Jx = vec ([\nX∇ᵀT ∇GX\n]) . (11)\nTherefore ∇J can be rewritten as ∇J = [ ∇T ⊗ IG IT ⊗∇G ] . (12)\nThe Laplacian is classically defined to equal the divergence of the gradient, and also in our case the joint Laplacian is LJ = ∇∗J∇J . Expanding the expression while exploiting the mixed-product property of the Kronecker product, we find\nLJ = (∇T ⊗ IG)∗(∇T ⊗ IG) + (IT ⊗∇G)∗(IT ⊗∇G) = (∇∗T ⊗ IG)(∇T ⊗ IG) + (IT ⊗∇∗G)(IT ⊗∇G) = (∇∗T∇T )⊗ IG + IT ⊗ (∇∗G∇G) = LT ⊗ IG + IT ⊗LG = LT ×LG,\nand therefore LJ is also equivalent to the Cartesian product between the time and graph Laplacians1. Above, and the second equality follows from the mixed-product property of the Kronecker product. Thus, the Laplacian operator LJ applied to the signal x is\nLJx = (LT ×LG)x = vec(LGX +XLT ) .\nThe result of the Cartesian product is a multilayer graph, referred to as the joint graph J , where the original graph G is copied at each time step t = 1, 2, . . . , T . Additionally, each node at layer t is connected to itself at layer t−1 and t+1 with periodic boundary conditions. It is useful to remind that the Kronecker product of the two eigenvectors basis UT and UG diagonalize the joint Laplacian with eigenvalues equal to the sum of all the pairs (ωk, λ`) [37]:\nLJ = LT ⊗ IG + IT ⊗LG = (UTΛTU ∗ T )⊗ IG + IT ⊗ (UGΛGU∗G)\n= (UT ⊗UG)(ΛT ×ΛG)(UT ⊗UG)∗ = UJΛJU∗J\nwhere we have used the mixed-product property of the Kronecker product.\nMeasures of joint variation. The gradient and its various norms are often used as regularizers in regression because they capture the variation of the signal over a domain of interest. The `2- norm of the joint gradient measures the total variation of\n1In this work we consider the Cartesian product for its amenable spectral properties, but in general other graph products could be considered, such as the Kronecker product J = G⊗GT or the strong product J = G GT = G×GT +G⊗GT [24].\ntim e\nRegular 2D Grid Sensor Graph\nFig. 1.

The discrete heat diffusion equation xt − xt−1 = −sLGxt is, arguably, one of the simplest dynamics described by differential equations.

      "text" : "Time-vertex harmonic analysis often provides useful insights on the dynamics of a signal even when the latter is not characterized by a linear PDE. To illustrate this, we will show how the JFT can be used to characterize the evolution of a non-linear, discrete, and non-deterministic model for the spread of an infectious disease.\nIn particular, we focus on the dynamics corresponding to different compartmental models commonly used in epidemiology. We simulated the epidemics spreading over N = 695 cities of Europe according to two different models: the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model and the SEIRS model, where the immunity of recovered individuals is only temporary. The models are parametrized by the contagion probability of infection, the infectious, latent and immunity periods and the population per city. Each node of the graph represents a city with a fixed population of individuals. Connections within the cities are modeled using randomly generated Erdős-Rényi graphs. Inter-cities connection are modeled using two graphs, a terrestrial coordinate-based graph and the graph of airline connections between the major city in Europe.\nWe simulate different realizations of the epidemic breakout, varying the parameters and observing how they influence the joint spectrum of the signals describing the evolution of the number of infected individuals at each node. Figure 3 shows the JFT of those signals. In the first case, the spectrum is characterized by regularly spaced lines along the angular frequency axis, caused by the inherent periodicity of the SEIRS model, where every individual can be infected again after the temporary\n6\nimmunity period ceases. The spacing between the lines is due to both the immunity and latent periods. In the second case the epidemic has a more diffusive behaviour, without evident periodicity. For each one of the models, we simulate scenarios with high and low probabilities of contagion. It can be observed that the high probability case is characterized by a larger bandwidth occupancy with respect to the low probability one, due to a more impulsive behaviour of the epidemic breakout. Therefore, JFT seems to reveal the underlying structure and allows us to differentiate between the different models."

In the context of time-vertex analysis, the importance of fast joint filtering is emphasized by the increase of the problem’s dimensions. Recognizing this need, researchers have recently proposed distributed joint filter 2D Chebychev polynomial [19] and separable rational [20] implementations, appropriate for arbitrary and separable joint response functions, respectively. In the following, we improve upon state of the art by enhancing the filtering approximation at a similar (up to logarithmic factors) complexity.\nThe Fast Fourier Chebyshev (FFC) algorithm. The basic idea of our algorithm is to exploit the small complexity of FFT and perform graph filtering in the time-frequency domain. Concretely, to filter X with response h(λ, ω), we do the following:\n1. Compute the FFT of every row of X , at a total complexity of O(NT log T ). 2. For each ωk, approximate h(λ, ωk) with a Chebyshev polynomial of order MG and use the fast graph Chebyshev recursion [14] to filter the corresponding angular frequency component of X . The complexity of this step is O(MGT |E|). 3. Use the inverse FFT to obtain the filtered timevertex signal, with complexity O(NT log T ).\nOur scheme can approximate both separable or nonseparable joint filters using O(T |E|MG + NT log T ) operations, which up to a logarithmic factor is a linear complexity to the number of edges |E|, nodes N , timesteps T , and filter order MG. Moreover, it can be performed distributedly since both the FFT and the graph Chebychev recursion necessitate only local or few hop information.\nNumerical comparison. To evaluate the approximation properties of the above scheme, we show in Figure 5 numerical experiments for an ideal separable lowpass filter and a non-separable wave filter on a time-vertex graph with size N = 5000, T = 3000. In detail, the approximated filtering functions (low pass and wave) are, respectively,\nhLP(λ`, ωk) = e−(λ`−λcf ) 1 + e−(λ`−λcf ) e−(|ωk|−ωcf ) 1 + e−(|ωk|−ωcf ) (23)\nhwave(λ`, ωk) = e −|π|ωk|−arccos(1−λ`/(2λmax)|2 .

We remark however that, to interpret these results correctly, one has to consider the complexity of each method:\nmethod complexity applicability\nFFC O(T |E|MG +NT log T ) all Cheby2D [19] O(T |E|MT +NTMTMG) all\nARMA2D [20] O(T |E|MG + T |E|MT ) separable\nTherefore, for the same order, the three different methods feature slightly different complexities, implying that a direct comparison of accuracy is not entirely fair. Nevertheless, the unfairness in not in our favor as, in our experiments for all orders larger than 2, the asymptotic complexity of FFC is the smallest (since here MG = MT , log T < MTMG, and log T < |E|MT /N ). We also note that, in practice one often needs MT log T to achieve a good approximation, in which case FFC is the fastest."

(29)\nWe build our dictionary by transforming h(λ, ω) with all zλ, zω ∈ Zλ × Zω , (possibly) normalizing, and jointly localizing the resulting kernels hzλ,zω (λ, ω) at each node m and time τ .

(30)\nWhen Dh is overly redundant, one may choose to consider only a subset of values for m and τ .\nWe next consider two interesting examples of the proposed dictionary construction that are generalizations of the short-time Fourier and wavelet transforms [45], [46]:\nShort Time-Vertex Fourier Transform (STVFT). Set szλ,zω (·, ·) to a shift in the spectral domain\nszλ,zω (λ, ω) = [λ− zλ, ω − zω]. (31)\nThis transform can be considered as a modulation. Nevertheless, we note that it does not correspond to a multiplication by an eigenvector as in [36], [47]. Our construction is more related to [48, Section 3]. Then, given a separable mother kernel h(λ, ω) = hG(λ)hT (ω) and a finite 2D set Zλ×Zω ⊂ R2, the STVFT of signal X is defined as\nSTVFT{X}(m, τ, zλ, zω) ∆ = 〈X, T Jm,τ h(λ− zλ, ω − zω)〉\n= 1√ T ∑ `,k h(λ` − zλ, ωk − zω)X̂(`, k)u`(m)ejωkτ .\nProvided that h(λ, ω) is localized around [0, 0], the amplitude of the coefficient (n, t, zλ, zω) indicates the presence of the spectral mode [zλ, zω] at vertex m and time τ . Moreover, since the mother kernel is separable, the design in the two domains can be performed independently:\nFor the graph domain, we suggest to select the values of zλ to be equally spaced in [0, λmax] [48, Section 3]. The spacing should be selected such that∑ zλ∈Zλ h 2 G(λ` − zλ) ≈ c for every λ`, ensuring good conditioning of the associated frame (see [14, Theorem 5.6]). Because of the graph irregularity, in most of the cases, we need to keep all possible values for m, i.e., m = 1, 2, . . . , N .\n9 For the time domain, we recover a traditional STFT, with the difference that hT (ω) is defined in the spectral domain. Nevertheless, for convenience, the window can still be designed in the time domain. As a rule of thumb |Zω| = lhT , where lhT is the support of hT in the time domain3, and the values of τ should be sampled regularly with a spacing lhTR , where R is the desired redundancy. For a more complete treatment we refer the reader to [45].\nSpectral Time-Vertex Wavelet Tranform (STVWT). Following the idea developed in [14], we set szλ,zω (·, ·) to a generalized graph dilation (or scaling), i.e., a multiplication in the spectral domain\nszλ,zω (λ, ω) = [zλ λ, zω ω]. (32)\nThen, given a kernel h(λ, ω) the STVWT of X reads\nSTVWT{X}(m, τ, zλ, zω) ∆ = 〈X, T Jm,τ h(zλ λ, zω ω)〉\n= 1√ T ∑ `,k h(zλ λ, zω ω)X̂(`, k)u`(m)e jωkτ ,\nwhere zλ, zω are the scale parameters for the vertex and the time dimensions. A usual requirement for h(λ, ω) is that it has a zero DC component, i.e., h(0, 0) = 0. Contrarily to the STVFT, the mother kernel here may not be separable, as illustrated in VI-C. The choice of the discretization lattice [m, τ, zλ, zω] is thus more involved and case dependent: we suggest that m and τ take all possible N and T values respectively, while zλ and zω are carefully selected depending on the application. This choice is justified by the computational complexity detailed in the following."

(b) How can we guarantee that the associated transforms are well conditioned such that they can be successfully inverted? (c) How to efficiently invert them, recovering the original signal? The second point is particularly important since a well conditioned transform allows for more robust representations, for instance when the dictionary is used to solve a synthesis or analysis regression problem with a sparse regularizer.\nEfficient analysis and synthesis. The dictionary atoms can be seen as a filter-bank {hz(λ, ω)}z∈Zλ×Zω , in\n3In practice, the kernel is chosen to have a compact support in the time-domain.\nwhich case the operators going from the signal to the representation domain and back are the analysis operator\nDh{X}(m, τ, z) = 〈X, T Jm,τ hz 〉 = Cz(m, τ),\nand the synthesis operator D∗h{C}(n, t) = ∑ z 〈Cz, T Jn,t hz 〉 = Y (n, t).\nNotice that in general X 6= Y , and equality holds only when the filter-bank is a unitary tight frame.\nInstead of computing the dictionary explicitly (an operation that is costly both in memory and in computations), one may acquire the analysis coefficients for all m, τ by joint filtering X with kernel hzλ,zω taking advantage of the relation Cz = mat(hz(LG,LT )x). Similarly synthesis can be performed by summing filtering operations. Using our FFC filtering algorithm presented in Section IV-B, the total analysis complexity is thus O(|Zλ × Zω|(T |E|MG + NT log T )), where typically MG ≈ 50.\nThe drawback of this technique is that it does not allow us to take advantage of sub-sampling the lattice [n, t], especially in the non-separable case. Indeed, a filtering operation will always provide all coefficients regardless of the desired lattice. While addressing this computational problem is beyond the scope of this contribution, we note that we can still efficiently perform a sub-sampled STVFT by first filtering only in the graph domain and second computing a traditional STFT.\nConditioning and frame bounds. In several applications in signal processing one is interested not only in processing data in another convenient representation, but also to recover the original signal from its alternative representation. Redundant invertible dictionaries are referred to as frames [45], [49]. The following theorem generalizes the classic [45] results regarding the frame bounds, providing a condition for a joint time-vertex dictionary to be a frame, as in the case of graphs [48, Lemma 1], [14, Theorem 5.6].\nTheorem 1. Let {hz(λ, ω)}z∈Zλ×Zω be the kernels of a time-vertex dictionary Dh, and set\nA = min l,k ∑ z |hz(λ`, ωk)|2, B = max l,k ∑ z |hz(λ`, ωk)|2."

Furthermore, the\n10\nratio of the frame bounds A/B is related to the condition number of the frame operator Sh{X} = D∗h{Dh{X}}, hence it is decisive for efficient reconstruction when we want to recover the signal from its representation solving an optimization problem [14, Section 7].\nEfficient inversion. To recover the signal X from the coefficients C, a solution is to use the pseudo-inverse, i.e. X = D†h{C} or to solve the following convex problem arg minX‖Dh{X} − C‖ 2 2. Problematically, these are computationally intractable for large value of N and T . We will instead design a dual set of kernels that allows us to invert the transform by a single synthesis operation. To this end, we search for a set of filters h̃ such that D∗ h̃ {Dh{X}} = X . It is not difficult to see that this equality is satisfied when∑ zλ,zω h̃zλ,zω (λ`, ωk)hzλ,zω (λ`, ωk) = 1, ∀ λ`, ωk. (34) Although redundant joint time-vertex frames admit an infinite number of dual kernel sets satisfying (34), the typical choice is to use the canonical dual, defined as\nh̃zλ,zω (λ`, ωk) = ∑ z′λ,z ′ ω h2z′λ,z′ω (λ`, ωk) −1hzλ,zω (λ`, ωk).

      "text" : "We next examine the utility of joint variation priors for regression problems in two example applications.\nDenoising of dynamic meshes. Whenever a smoothness prior can be assumed, the joint Tikhonov regularization can be used to denoise a time-varying graph signal. The prior can be easily expressed in the time-vertex domain thanks to Eq. (13). Joint denoising is then performed by solving the following optimization problem\narg min X ‖X−Y ‖2F +τ1‖∇GX‖ 2 F +τ2‖X∇T ‖ 2 F , (37)\nwhere the regularization terms require the solution to be smooth in both graph and time domains. This problem has a closed form solution in our framework, which is a joint non-separable lowpass filter\nhTIK(λ`, ωk) = 1\n1 + τ1λ` + 2τ2(1− cos(2πωk)) .\n(38) In order to investigate its performance, we consider the vertices of a mesh of size 2502× 59× 3 representing a walking dog, we add Gaussian noise to the coordinates, we build a k nearest neighbor graph based on the distances between the time average of the coordinates and finally we solve the problem (37) for each coordinate dimension. We averaged the results over 20 realizations of the noise.\nThe meshes in Figure 7 represent, from left to right, the original, the noisy and the recovered one, for one\nrealization of the noise. Remarkably, the normalized error drops from 0.20 to 0.06, respectively before and after denoising, making the dog distinguishable again. As side effect, the dog appears to be thinner, due to the graph regularization. The heat-map in the left corner of the figure shows the role of the regularization parameters. We found (using exhaustive search) that the lowest error is achieved when τ1 = 0.71 and τ2 = 1.78. We compare the performance of the joint Tikhonov regularization with respect to time- and graph-only for the best parameter combinations of all methods. The boxplot on the right shows the minimum achievable error statistics in the three cases over the 20 realizations. It is easy to see that the graph plays a major role in the denoising, since it encodes the structural information of the mesh. Nevertheless, the joint approach performs the best, i.e., 0.062 ± 0.0002, taking advantage of the smoothness in both domains, while graph and time methods achieve 0.067± 0.0003 and 0.095± 0.0002, respectively.\nInpainting of time-lapse video. We consider the problem of time-vertex signal recovery from noisy, corrupted, and incomplete measurements. Depending on the characteristics of the signal, the prior Np,q (x) with\n12\ndifferent values of p and q and different weights can be used. A typical signal recovery problem in signal processing is the image inpainting, i.e., trying to replace corrupted or lost part of the image. Since patch-graphs allow non-local image processing [53], our goal is to extend graph-based non-local processing to video inpainting and recovery. However, since our framework is constrained to static graphs, we focus on the particular case of time-lapse videos, whose structure stays majorly invariant throughout the video. To this end, we corrupted a time-lapse video that shows the skyline of the Kuala Lumpur City Centre, which statistical properties were amenable from a graph perspective, being the skyline static with time-varying colors. The video has size 160× 214× 3× 604 (height × width × colors × frames). We removed 20% of the pixels and 20% of the frames from the original KLCC video, achieving a normalized error of 0.61. The inpainting is performed solving the optimization problem for each color using as regularizer N1,2 (x):\narg min X ‖M ◦X − Y ‖2F + γ1‖∇GX‖1 + γ2‖X∇T ‖ 2 F , (39) where M is the mask of the missing entries. The patch graph G is constructed from the video averaged in time. The rationale is that the l1 over the graph will restore the missing pixels, being each frame approximately piecewise constant, whereas the l2 norm in time recovers the smooth changes of the colors from dawn until dusk.\nFigure 8 shows two frames of the video, their corrupted counterparts and the result of the recovery, along with the respective normalized errors. The recovered video has a normalized error of 0.049, illustrating that the joint inpainting is able to restore the global quality of the video even in case of considerable missing information.\nWe compare the recovery performance with all the joint regularizers Np,q (x) for p, q = {1, 2}, and with\ntwo baseline algorithms, based on 3D-Tikhonov and isotropic 3D-TV regularizations [54]. The last two correspond to using a grid graph with equal weights on the edges. Table I reports the normalized errors averaged over the pixels-only, frames-only and the whole video. The better performance achieved by the joint regularizer N1,2 (x) is due to its capability to restore missing frames, while missing pixels recovery performances are almost the same. Figure 9 illustrates a summary statistics of the errors computed over each frame. Although TV performs the best in the median, in case of occluded frames the error is much larger w.r.t. the joint recovery, leading to a higher average error."

We consider the motion classification of a dynamic mesh representing the dancer, corrupted with additive sparse noise with density 0.1 with normally distributed entries and SNR of −20 dB and −10 dB. Our objective is to determine the phase of the dance (moving arms, stretching legs and bending body) at each frames by performing spectral clustering on some representation of the windowed signal. To obtain the ground-truth, we\n13\nlabeled each frame by hand and verified that, when the noiseless signal (i.e., the actual trajectory of the points in time over each window) was used to define the features, one obtains a classification accuracy of 0.926.\nSince we want to localize spatial-structured phenomena in time, our approach will be to use a STVFT to derive the representation. To capture the geometry of the problem, we used a nearest neighbour graph constructed based on the coordinates of the mesh vertices averaged in time; this graph was fixed for the whole sequence. As explained in Section V-B, the STVFT is separable, meaning that we can handle the vertex and the time dimensions separately. In the time domain we use a rectangular window with support equal to 50 samples in time and spacing such that the overlap is 60%. For the vertex dimension, we use the an Itersine kernel (defined in the GSPBOX [50]) that we uniformly translate at 5 different positions in the graph spectral domain.\nThe STVFT provides features associated to a time instant that we can directly use to classify the dance (see Figure 10 for a visual illustration of the clustering results). Other transforms such as GFT, DFT, and JFT do no have this property. Hence, in order to compare with these other transforms, we use the same rectangular windows (width 50, overlap 20 samples) to extract 27 time sequences from the signal. We then used the transformed data associated with each sequence as a point to be clustered.\nFigure 11 illustrates the clustering accuracy statistics over 20 realizations of sparse noise for features constructed based on the magnitude of five representations:\nthe windowed sequences, as well as their GFT, DFT, JFT, and STVFT representations. Observe how the presence of sparse noise severely hampers classification when the raw signal is used, with the average accuracy dropping from 0.926 for the clean signals to 0.469 and 0.74 for −20 dB and −10 dB, respectively.\nWe can also see that the two representations leading to the highest median accuracy are the JFT and STVFT, suggesting the utility of joint harmonic representations. Nevertheless, the STVFT provides more robust estimates with an average accuracy of 0.869 rather than 0.792 for the JFT at −20 dB.\nSeismic epicenter estimation with STVWT. We analyze seismic events recorded by the GeoNet sensor network whose epicenters were chosen to be randomly distributed in different areas of New Zealand. We extend the results presented in [21] to a greater dataset using the STVWT with mother kernel based on the wave PDE, which allows us to decompose the signal as sum of PDE solutions. As a first approximation, when the waves propagate in a continuous domain or a regular lattice, seismic waveforms can be modeled as oscillating damped waves [55]. Our premise is thus that we can approximate the seismic waveforms using a small set of damped waves propagating on the graph connecting the seismic stations. Thus, we expect the damped wave mother kernel\nh(λ`, ωk) = 1√ T eβ+jωk + λ`/2− 1 2(cosh (β + jωk) + λ`/2− 1) (40)\nto be a good approximation of the seismic waves recorded by the sensors, with the damping factor β chosen to fit the damping present in the seismic signals. To construct the STVWT, we select 10 equally spaced values in [0, 2] for zλ and set zω = 1. To estimate the epicenter of the earthquake we solve\narg min C ‖D∗h{C} −X‖22 + γ‖C‖1, (41)\nwhere γ is the regularization parameter controlling the trade-off between the fidelity term (selected using exhaustive search) and the sparseness assumption and D∗h is the synthesis operator associated with STVWT.\nThe solution provides important pieces of information. Firstly, using the synthesis operator we can obtain a denoised version of the original process. Secondly, the non-zero coefficients of C, describe the origins and amplitudes of the different components. Therefore, we average the coordinates of the vertices corresponding to the sources of the waves with highest energy coefficients. We compare the performance of STVWT with the estimate obtained using only the signal amplitude: for each earthquake we average the coordinates of the stations using as weights energy of the signals. Figure 12 shows on\n14\nthe left the comparison over 40 different seismic events randomly distributed over the New Zealand between the two methods. STVWT based on the damped wave kernel achieves an average error of 48.5 km, providing an almost twofold improvement over the baseline, whose average performance is 88.3 km. On the right, it illustrates the estimate for 3 different seismic events and the respective seismic waveforms. These results show that the proposed method significantly improves the source estimation performance."

The wave equation is a hyperbolic differential equation and several difficulties arise when discretizing it for numerical computation of the solution [56]. Moreover, the graph being an irregular domain, the solution of the above equation is not any more a smooth wave after a few iterations. Nevertheless, we assume as in the case of the heat diffusion Eq.

Since the arccos(x) is defined only for x ∈ [−1, 1], to guarantee stability the parameter s must satisfy s < 4/λmax.

    "abstractText" : "An emerging way to deal with highdimensional non-euclidean data is to assume that the underlying structure can be captured by a graph. Recently, ideas have begun to emerge related to the analysis of time-varying graph signals. This work aims to elevate the notion of joint harmonic analysis to a full-fledged framework denoted as Time-Vertex Signal Processing, that links together the time-domain signal processing techniques with the new tools of graph signal processing. This entails three main contributions: (a) We provide a formal motivation for harmonic time-vertex analysis as an analysis tool for the state evolution of simple Partial Differential Equations on graphs. (b) We improve the accuracy of joint filtering operators by up-to two orders of magnitude. (c) Using our joint filters, we construct time-vertex dictionaries analyzing the different scales and the local time-frequency content of a signal. The utility of our tools is illustrated in numerous applications and datasets, such as dynamic mesh denoising and classification, still-video inpainting, and source localization in seismic events. Our results suggest that joint analysis of time-vertex signals can bring benefits to regression and learning.",
