The idea is to embed textual structures into a semantic space of concepts which captures the main topics of these structures. That so called bag-of-concepts representation suffers from data sparsity causing low similarity scores between similar texts due to low concept overlap. In this paper we propose two neural embedding models in order to learn continuous concept vectors.

Empirical results on a benchmark dataset for measuring entity semantic relatedness show superior performance over other concept embedding models. In addition, by utilizing our efficient aggregation method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the densified vector representation over the typical sparse representations for dataless classification where we can achieve at least same or better accuracy with much less dimensions."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Vector-based semantic mapping models are used to represent textual structures (words, phrases, and documents) as high-dimensional meaning vectors. Typically, these models utilize textual corpora and/or Knowledge Bases (KBs) to acquire world knowledge, which is then used to generate a vector representation for the given text in the semantic space. The goal is thus to accurately place semantically similar structures close to each other in that semantic space. On the other hand, dissimilar structures should be far apart.\nExplicit concept space models are motivated by the idea that high level cognitive tasks such learning and reasoning are supported by the knowledge we acquire from concepts (Song et al., 2015). Therefore, such models utilize concept vectors (a.k.a bag-of-concepts (BOC)) as the underlying semantic representation of a given text through a process called conceptualization, which is mapping the text into relevant concepts capturing its main topics. The concept space typically include concepts obtained from KBs such as Wikipedia, Probase (Wu et al., 2012), and others. Once the concept vectors are generated, similarity between two concept vectors can be computed using a suitable similarity/distance measure such as cosine.\nThe BOC representation has proven efficacy for semantic analysis of textual data especially short texts where contextual information is missing or insufficient. For example, measuring semantic similarity/relatedness (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007; Kim et al., 2013; Shalaby and Zadrozny, 2015), dataless classification (Chang et al., 2008; Song and Roth, 2014, 2015; Li et al., 2016), short text clustering (Song et al., 2015), search and relevancy ranking (Egozi et al., 2011), event detection and coreference resolution (Peng et al., 2016).\nSimilar to the traditional bag-of-words representation, the BOC vector is a high dimensional sparse vector whose dimensionality is the same as the number of concepts in the employed KB (typically millions). Consequently, it suffers from data sparsity causing low similarity scores between similar texts due to low concept overlap. Formally, given a text snippet T = {t1, t2, ..., tn} of n terms where n ≥ 1, and a concept space C = {c1, c2, ..., cN} of size N . The BOC vector v = {w1, w2, ..., ws} ∈ R N of T is a vector of weights of each concept where each wi of concept\nci is calculated as in equation 1:\nwi =\nn ∑\nj=1\nf(ci, tj), 1 ≤ i ≤ N (1)\nHere f(c, t) is a scoring function which indicates the degree of association between term t and concept c. For example, Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007) proposed Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) which uses Wikipedia articles as concepts and the TF-IDF score of the terms in these article as the association score. Another scoring function might be the co-occurrence count or Pearson correlation score between t and c. As we can notice, only very small subset of the concept space would have non-zero scores with the given terms. Moreover, the BOC vector is generated from the topn concepts which have relatively high association scores with the input terms (typically few hundreds). Thus each text snippet is mapped to a very sparse vector of millions of dimensions having only few hundreds non-zero values (Peng et al., 2016).\nTypically, the cosine similarity measure is used compute the similarity between a pair of BOC vectors u and v. Because the concept vectors are very sparse, we can rewrite each vector as a vector of tuples (ci, wi). Suppose that u = {(cn1 , u1), . . . , (cn|u| , u|u|)} and v = {(cm1 , v1), . . . , (cm|v| , v|v|)}, where ui and vj are the corresponding weights of concepts cni and cmj respectively. And ni, mj are the indices of these concepts in the concept space C such that 1≤ ni,mj ≤N . Then, the relatedness score can be written as in equation 2:\nSimcos(u,v) =\n∑|u| i=1 ∑|v| j=1 1(ni=mj)uivj\n√\n∑|u| i=1 u 2 i\n√\n∑|v| j=1 v 2 j\n(2)\nwhere 1 is the indicator function which returns 1 if ni=mj and 0 otherwise. Having such sparse representation and using exact match similarity scoring measure, we can expect that two very similar text snippets might have zero similarity score if they map to different but very related set of concepts (Song and Roth, 2015).\nNeural embedding models have been proposed to overcome the BOC sparsity problem. The basic idea is to learn fixed size continuous vectors for each concept. These vectors can then be used to compute concept-concept similarity and thus overcome the concept mismatch problem.\nIn this paper we propose two neural embedding models in order to learn continuous concept vectors based on the skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013b). Our first model is the Concept Raw Context model (CRC) which utilizes concept mentions in a large scale KB to jointly learn embeddings of both words and concepts. Our second model is the Concept-Concept Context model (3C) which learns the embeddings of concepts from their conceptual contexts (i.e., contexts containing surrounding concepts only). After learning the concept vectors, we propose an efficient concept vector aggregation method to generate fully dense BOC representations. Our efficient aggregation method allows measuring the similarity between pairs of BOC vectors in linear time. This is more efficient than prior methods which require quadratic time or at least log-linear time if optimized (see equation 2).\nWe evaluate our embedding models on two\ntasks:\n1. An intrinsic task of measuring entity seman-\ntic relatedness where our CRC model outperforms other concept embedding models.\n2. An extrinsic task of dataless classifica-\ntion. Experimental results show that we can achieve better accuracy using our efficient BOC densification method compared to the original BOC sparse representation. The contributions of this paper are threefold: First, we propose two low cost concept embedding models which requires few hours rather than days to train. Second, we propose simple and efficient vector aggregation method to obtain fully densified BOC vectors in linear time. Third, we demonstrate through experiments that we can obtain same or better accuracy using the densified BOC representation with much less dimensions (few in most cases), reducing the computational cost of generating the BOC vector significantly."

      "text" : "Concept/Entity Embeddings: neural embedding models have been proposed to learn distributed representations of concepts/entities. Song and Roth (2015) proposed using the popular Word2Vec model (Mikolov et al., 2013a) to obtain the embeddings of each concept by averaging the vectors of the concept’s individual words. For example, the embeddings of Microsoft Office would be obtained by averaging the embeddings of Mi-\ncrosoft and Office obtained from the Word2Vec model. Clearly, this method disregards the fact that the semantics of multi-word concepts is different from the semantics of their individual words.\nMore robust concept embeddings can be learned from the concept’s corresponding article and/or from the structure of the employed KB (e.g., its link graph). Such concept embedding models were proposed by Hu et al. (2015); Li et al. (2016); Yamada et al. (2016) who all utilize the skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013b), but differ in how they define the context of the target concept.\nLi et al. (2016) extended the embedding model proposed by Hu et al. (2015) by jointly learning concept and category embeddings from contexts defined by all other concepts in the target concept’s article as well as its category hierarchy in Wikipedia. This method has the advantage of learning embeddings of both concepts and categories simultaneously. However, defining the concept contexts as pairs of the target concept and all other concepts appearing in its corresponding article might introduce noisy contexts, especially for long articles. For example, the Wikipedia article for United States contains links to Kindergarten, First grade, and Secondary school under the Education section.\nYamada et al. (2016) proposed a method based on the skip-gram model to jointly learn embeddings of words and concepts using contexts generated from surrounding words of the target concept or word. The authors also proposed incorporating the KB link graph by generating contexts from all concepts with outgoing link to the target concept to better model concept-concept relatedness.\nUnlike Li et al. (2016) and Hu et al. (2015) who learn concept embeddings only, our CRC model (described in Section 3), maps both words and concepts into the same semantic space. Therefore we can easily measure word-word, word-concept, and concept-concept semantic similarities. In addition, compared to Yamada et al. (2016) model, we utilize contexts generated from both surrounding words and concepts. Therefore, we can better capture local contextual information of each target word/concept. Moreover, our proposed models are computationally less costly than Hu et al. (2015) and Yamada et al. (2016) models as they require few hours rather than days to train on similar computing resources.\nBOC Densification: distributed concept vectors have been used by BOC densification mechanisms to overcome the BOC sparsity problem. Song and Roth (2015) proposed three different mechanisms for aligning the concepts at different indices given a sparse BOC pair (u,v) in order to increase their similarity score.\nThe many-to-many mechanism works by averaging all pairwise similarities. The many-toone mechanism works by aligning each concept in u with the most similar concept in v (i.e., its best match). Clearly, the complexity of these two mechanisms is quadratic. The third mechanism is the one-to-one. It utilizes the Hungarian method in order to find an optimal alignment on a one-to-one basis (Papadimitriou and Steiglitz, 1982). This mechanism performed the best on dataless classification and was also utilized by Li et al. (2016). However, the Hungarian method is a combinatorial optimization algorithm whose complexity is polynomial. Our proposed densification mechanism is more efficient than these three mechanisms as its complexity is linear with respect to the number of non-zero elements in the BOC vector. Additionally, it is simpler as it does not require tuning a cut off threshold for the minimum similarity between two aligned concepts as in prior work."

      "text" : "A main objective of learning concept embeddings is to overcome the inherent problem of data sparsity associated with the BOC representation. Here we try to learn continuous concept vectors by building upon the skip-gram embedding model (Mikolov et al., 2013b). In the conventional skipgram model, a set of contexts are generated by sliding a context window of predefined size over sentences of a given text corpus. Vector representation of a target word is learned with the objective to maximize the ability of predicting surrounding words of that target word.\nFormally, given a training corpus of V words w1, w2, ..., wV . The skip-gram model aims to maximize the average log probability:\n1\nV\nV ∑\ni=1\n∑\n−s≤j≤s,j 6=0\nlog p(wi+j |wi) (3)\nwhere s is the context window size, wi is the target word, and wi+j is a surrounding context word.\nThe softmax function is used to estimate the probability p(wO|wI) as follows:\np(wO|wI) = exp(v⊺wOuwI )\n∑W w=1 exp(v ⊺ wuwI ) (4)\nwhere uw and vw are the input and output vectors respectively and W is the vocabulary size. Mikolov et al. (2013b) proposed hierarchical softmax and negative sampling as efficient alternatives to approximate the softmax function which becomes computationally intractable whenW becomes huge.\nOur approach genuinely learns distributed concept representations by generating concept contexts from mentions of those concepts in large encyclopedic KBs such as Wikipedia. Utilizing such annotated KBs eliminates the need to manually annotate concept mentions and thus comes at no cost."

After generating all the contexts, we use the skip-gram model to jointly learn words and concepts embeddings. Formally, given a training corpus of V words w1, w2, ..., wV . We iterate over the corpus identifying words and concept mentions and thus generating a sequence of T tokens t1, t2, ...tT where T < V (as multiword concepts will be counted as one token).

In this model, ti is the target token which would be either a word or a concept mention, and ti+j is a surrounding context word or concept mention.\nThis model is different from Yamada et al. (2016) anchor context model in three aspects: 1) while generating target concept contexts, we utilize not only surrounding words but other surrounding concepts as well, 2) our model aims to maximize p(ti+j|ti) where t could be a word or a concept, while Yamada et al. (2016) model\nmaximizes p(wi+j |ei) where ei is the target concept/entity (see Yamada et al.

In order to test this hypothesis, we learn concept embeddings by training a skip-gram model on contexts generated solely from concept mentions. As in the CRC model, we start by identifying all concept mentions in the given corpus. Then, contexts are generated from only surrounding concepts. Formally, given a training corpus of V words w1, w2, ..., wV . We iterate over the corpus identifying concept mentions and thus generating a sequence of C concept tokens c1, c2, ...cC where C < V . Afterwards we train the skip-gram model aiming to maximize:\n1\nC\nC ∑\ni=1\n∑\n−s≤j≤s,j 6=0\nlog p(ci+j |ci) (6)\nwhere s is the context window size, ci is the target concept, and ci+j is a surrounding concept mention within s mentions.\nThis model is different from Li et al. (2016) and Hu et al. (2015) as they define the context of a target concept by all the other concepts which appear in the concept’s corresponding article. Clearly, some of these concepts might be irrelevant especially for very long articles which cite hundreds of other concepts. Our 3C model, alternatively, learns concept semantics from surrounding concepts and not only from those that are cited in its article. We also extend the context window beyond pairs of concepts allowing more influence to other nearby concepts.\nThe main advantage of the 3C model over the CRC model is its computational efficiency where the model vocabulary is limited to the corpus concepts (Wikipedia in our case). One the other hand, the CRC model is advantageous because it jointly learns the embeddings of words and concepts and is therefore expected to generate higher\nquality vectors. In other words, the CRC model can capture more contextual signals such as actions, times, and relationships at the expense of training computational cost."

Eventually, our corpus contained about 5 million articles in total.\nWe preprocess each article replacing all its references to other Wikipedia articles with the their corresponding page IDs. In case any of the references is a title of a redirect page, we use the page ID of the original page to ensure that all concept mentions are normalized.\nFollowing Mikolov et al.

Here, we propose simple and efficient vector aggregation method to obtain fully\n1http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/\ndensified BOC vectors in linear time. Our mechanism works by performing a weighted average of the embedding vectors of all concepts in the given BOC. This operation scales linearly with the number of non-zero dimensions in the BOC vector. In addition, it produces a fully dense vector representing the semantics of the original concepts and considering their weights. Formally, given a sparse BOC vector s= {(c1, w1), . . . , (c|s|, w|s|)} where wi is weight of concept ci. We can obtain the dense representation of s as in equation 8:\nsdense = ∑|s| i=1wi.uci ∑|s|\ni=1 wi (8)\nwhere uci is the embedding vector of concept ci. Once we have this dense BOC vector, we can apply the cosine measure to compute the similarity between a pair of dense BOC vectors.\nAs we can notice, this weighted average is done once and for all for a given BOC vector. Other mechanisms that rely on concept alignment (Song and Roth, 2015), require realignment every time a given BOC vector is compared to another BOC vector. Our approach improves the efficiency especially in the context of dataless classification with large number of classes. Using our densification mechanism, we apply the weighted average for each class vector and for each instance once.\nInterestingly, our densification mechanism allows us to densify the sparse BOC vector using only the top few dimensions. As we will show in the experiments section, we can get (near-)best results using these few dimensions compared to densifying with all the dimensions in the original sparse vector. This property reduces the cost of obtaining a BOC vector with a few hundred dimensions in the first place."

Moreover, near-peak performance is achievable with the top 50 or less dimensions. We can also notice that, as we increase the # of dimensions, both WEmax and WEhung densification methods have the same undesired monotonic pattern like ESA.

Our proposed densification mechanisms besides their low cost, produce fully densified representations allowing good similarities at low dimensions.\nResults of coarse-grained classification are presented in Table 4. Classification at the top level is easier than the fine-grained level. Nevertheless,\nas with fine-grained classification, ESA still peaks with a few hundred dimensions of the sparse BOC vector.

The idea is to embed textual structures into a semantic space of concepts which captures the main topics of these structures. That so called bag-of-concepts representation suffers from data sparsity causing low similarity scores between similar texts due to low concept overlap. In this paper we propose two neural embedding models in order to learn continuous concept vectors. Once learned, we propose an efficient vector aggregation method to generate fully dense bag-of-concepts representations. Empirical results on a benchmark dataset for measuring entity semantic relatedness show superior performance over other concept embedding models. In addition, by utilizing our efficient aggregation method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the densified vector representation over the typical sparse representations for dataless classification where we can achieve at least same or better accuracy with much less dimensions.",
