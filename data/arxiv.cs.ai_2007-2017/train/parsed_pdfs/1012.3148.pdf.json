The results prove that most artificially intelligent machines are as adept if not more than us at under-taking long calculations or even play chess, but their logic brings them nowhere when it comes to carrying out everyday tasks like walking, facial gesture recognition or speech recognition."

      "heading" : "Introduction",
      "text" : "Humans have always been fascinated by machines, so much so that Greek myths also have a mention of them. From the advent of the 20th century,1956 to be more precise, man has been intrigued by the very thought of creating something that can emulate him. Right from the coining of the term “Artificial Intelligence” by John McCarthy to the present day world, artificial intelligence is everywhere around us. Most of the work being done in industries is being done by them. They have become such an important part of our everyday lives that most of it is being controlled by them, and a failure on their part could be disastrous.\nHowever on close examination of the “jobs” that these machines carry out for us, we notice that most of these jobs don’t require much of abstract thought. These are well defined jobs with proper instruction which the machine can follow step by step to obtain the desirable results. So, why is it that these machines are replacing more and more engineers and not the artists, or the musicians from their jobs?\nThe answer lies somewhere in the 1980’s when Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks and Marvin Minsky devised something called the Moravec’s Paradox. This paradox deals with the often mistaken fact that it is the logical problems in the field of Artificial Intelligence that are the hardest to solve, and that simple day to day activities like facial recognition, and hand-eye coordination that are the easiest and can be easily implemented. In fact AI researchers in the 1960’s worked only on the logical aspect, assuming that the “easier” problems will solve themselves once the hard ones can be solved. Contrary to all the above opinions Moravec said that”it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.”\nWhat he meant by the above statement is that day to day activities like speech perception, facial recognition, and motor activities are actually harder to implement in Artificial Machines than making a machine play chess or carry out any other activity that requires logic.\nThe reason Moravec feels lies in the theory of evolution. It has taken us millions of years to evolve from Apes to our present selves. The feat that this million years of evolution has achieved is not trivial. What this million years of evolution has done is to teach us how to survive in the world; our everyday activities which might seem so trivial to carry out are actually the result of millions and millions years of evolution. What evolution has done for us is that by its process it has refined our system design implementations, and preserved every improvement. So, today if we have to carry out a simple task as walking across the room or picking up something, we don’t even have to think about it. It’s like it’s embedded in our conscience, and that is exactly what the machines lack a conscience built up upon a million years of evolution. It is for this simple reason machines can carry out logic tasks like playing checker, managing traffic or air control, but not the other ones like athletics or art.\nAbstract thought that involves logic has only developed over the last few thousand years, and therefore it hasn’t been implemented to such a great deal. Thus, playing chess seems difficult to us and we might brand someone who is able to play it as intelligent. It is for this very reason that implementing something which has evolved only for the past few thousand years is easier than encoding a million years of evolution into a machine."

(2004) \"Theories of Emotion.\"\nPsychology: Seventh Edition, New York, NY: Worth Publishers, p. 500. Emotion is associated with mood, personality and disposition, and motivation.

This is based on the Latin emovere, where e- (variant of ex- ) means 'out' and movere means 'move'.[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/emotion.htm Emotional Competency discussion of emotion] The related term \"motivation\" is also derived from the word movere.\nKush says:\nCan you walk across the room?\nAlice says:\nMostly it does.\nKush says:\nDo you remember what I asked you, last time?\nAlice says:\nToday, it is Tuesday the 31 of August 2010.

However when it comes to abstractions from the usual directive of the bots/machines, giving any form of sensible output becomes hard. Hence we conclude that as Moravec rightly said that it is the conscientious actions that are harder to implement in Artificial Intelligence, than the ones that require logic.\nCitations/References\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Brooks\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec's_paradox\nhttp://highered.blogspot.com/2009/04/more-thoughts-on-moravecs-paradox.html\nhttp://highered.blogspot.com/2009/03/learning-paradox.html\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/88cfh/moravecs_paradox/\nhttp://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~yyao/PAPERS/ieee_grc_08.pdf\nhttp://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1998/SimConEx.98.html\nhttp://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2000/Cerebrum.html\nhttp://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/2000/puddle.html\nhttp://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/robot.papers/1999/SciAm.scan.html\nhttp://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1993/Robot93.html\nhttp://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm\nhttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=rise-of-the-robots"
