      "text" : "Word embeddings aim to represent words as low-dimensional dense vectors. In comparison to distributional count vectors, word embeddings address the problematic sparsity of word vectors and achieved impressive results in many NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis (e.g., Kim (2014)), word similarity (e.g., Pennington et al. (2014)), and parsing (e.g., Lazaridou et al. (2013)). Moreover, word embeddings are attractive because they can be learned in an unsupervised fashion from unlabeled raw corpora. There are two main approaches to create word embeddings. The first approach makes use of neural-based techniques to learn word embeddings, such as the Skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013). The second approach is based on matrix factorization (Pennington et al., 2014), building word embeddings by factorizing word-context co-occurrence matrices.\nIn recent years, a number of approaches have focused on improving word embeddings, often by integrating lexical resources. For example, Adel and Schütze (2014) applied coreference chains to Skip-gram models in order to create word embeddings for antonym identification. Pham et al. (2015) proposed an extension of a Skip-gram model by integrating synonyms and antonyms from WordNet. Their extended Skip-gram model outperformed a standard Skip-gram model on both general semantic tasks and distinguishing antonyms from synonyms. In a similar spirit, Nguyen et al. (2016) integrated distributional lexical contrast into every single context of a target word in a Skip-gram model for training word embeddings. The resulting word embeddings were used in similarity tasks, and to distinguish between antonyms and synonyms. Faruqui et al. (2015) improved word embeddings without relying on lexical resources, by applying ideas from sparse coding to transform dense word embeddings into sparse word embeddings. The dense vectors in their models can be transformed into sparse overcomplete vectors or sparse binary overcomplete vectors. They showed that the resulting vector representations were more similar to interpretable features in NLP and outperformed the original vector representations on several benchmark tasks.\nIn this paper, we aim to improve word embeddings by reducing their noise. The hypothesis behind our approaches is that word embeddings contain unnecessary information, i.e. noise. We start out with the idea of learning word embeddings as suggested by Mikolov et al. (2013), relying on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954) that words with similar distributions have related meanings. We address those distributions in embedded vectors of words that decrease the value of such vector representations. For instance, consider the sentence the quick brown fox gazing at the cloud jumped over the lazy dog. The\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n01 87\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 6\nO ct\n2 01\n6\ncontext jumped can be used to predict the words fox, cloud and dog in a window size of 5 words; however, a cloud cannot jump. The context jumped is therefore considered as noise in the embedded vector of cloud. We propose two novel models to smooth word embeddings by filtering noise: We strengthen salient contexts and weaken unnecessary contexts.\nThe first proposed model is referred to as complete word denoising embeddings model (CompEmb). Given a set of original word embeddings, we use a filter to learn a denoising matrix, and then project the set of original word embeddings into this denoising matrix to produce a set of complete word denoising embeddings. The second proposed model is referred to as overcomplete word denoising embeddings model (OverCompEmb). We make use of a sparse coding method to transform an input set of original word embeddings into a set of overcomplete word embeddings, which is considered as the “overcomplete process”. We then apply a filter to train a denoising matrix, and thereafter project the set of original word embeddings into the denoising matrix to generate a set of overcomplete word denoising embeddings. The key idea in our models is to use a filter for learning the denoising matrix. The architecture of the filter is a feed-forward, non-linear and parameterized neural network with a fixed depth that can be used to learn the denoising matrices and reduce noise in word embeddings. Using state-of-the-art word embeddings as input vectors, we show that the resulting word denoising embeddings outperform the original word embeddings on several benchmark tasks such as word similarity and word relatedness tasks, synonymy detection and noun phrase classification. Furthermore, the implementation of our models is made publicly available1.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the two proposed models, the loss function, and the sparse coding technique for overcomplete vectors. In Section 3, we demonstrate the experiments on evaluating the effects of our word denoising embeddings, tuning hyperparameters, and we analyze the effects of filter depth. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper."

      "text" : "In this section, we present the two contributions of this paper. Figure 1 illustrates our two models to learn denoising for word embeddings. The first model on the top, the complete word denoising embeddings model “CompEmb” (Section 2.1), filters noise from word embeddings X to produce complete word denoising embeddings X∗, in which the vector length of X∗ in comparison to X is unchanged after denoising (called complete). The second model at the bottom of the figure, the overcomplete word denoising embeddings model “OverCompEmb” (Section 2.2), filters noise from word embeddings X to yield overcomplete word denoising embeddings Z∗, in which the vector length of Z∗ tends to be greater than the vector length of X (called overcomplete).\nFor the notations, let X ∈ RV×L is an input set of word embeddings in which V is the vocabulary size, andL is the vector length of X. Furthermore, Z ∈ RV×K is the overcomplete word embeddings in which K is the vector length of Z (K > L); finally, D ∈ RL×L is the pre-trained dictionary (Section 2.4)."

      "text" : "In this subsection, we aim to reduce noise in the given input word embeddings X by learning a denoising matrix Qc. The complete word denoising embeddings X∗ are then generated by projecting X into Qc. More specifically, given an input X ∈ RV×L, we seek to optimize the following objective function:\nargmin X,Qc,S V∑ i=1 ‖xi − f(xi,Qc,S)‖+ α‖S‖1 (1)\nwhere f is a filter; S is a lateral inhibition matrix; and α is a regularization hyperparameter. Inspired by studies on sparse modeling, the matrix S is chosen to be symmetric and has zero on the diagonal. The goal of this matrix is to implement excitatory interaction between neurons, and to increase the convergence speed of the neural network (Szlam et al., 2011). More concretely, the matrices Qc and S\n1https://github.com/nguyenkh/NeuralDenoising\nare initialized with I and E, which are identity matrices, and the Lipschitz constant:\nQc = 1 ED; S = I− 1EDTD E > the largest eigenvalue of DTD D ∈ RL×L be pre-trained dictionary\nThe underlying idea for reducing noise is to make use of a filter f to learn a denoising matrix Qc; hence, we design the filter f as a non-linear, parameterized, feed-forward architecture with a fixed depth that can be trained to approximate f(X,Qc,S) to X as in Figure 2a. As a result, noise from word embeddings will be filtered by layers of the filter f . The filter f is encoded as a recursive function by iterating over the number of fixed depth T , as the following recursive Equation 2 shows:\nY = f(X,Qc,S) Y(0) = G(XQc) Y(k + 1) = G(XQc + Y(k)S) 0 ≤ k < T\n(2)\nG is a non-linear activation function. The matrices Qc and S are learned to produce the lowest possible error in a given number of iterations. Matrix S, in the architecture of filter f , acts as a controllable matrix to filter unnecessary information on embedded vectors, and to impose restrictions on further reducing the computational burden (e.g., solving low-rank approximation problem or keeping the number of terms at zero (Gregor and LeCun, 2010)). Moreover, the initialization of the matrices Qc, S and E enhances a\nhighly efficient minimization of the objective function in Equation 1, due to the pre-trained dictionary D that carries the information of reconstructing X.\nThe architecture of the filter f is a recursive feed-forward neural network with the fixed depth T , so the number of T plays a significant role in controlling the approximation of X∗. The effects of T will be discussed later in Section 3.4. When Qc is trained, the complete word denoising embeddings X∗ are yielded by projecting X into Qc, as shown by the following Equation 3:\nX∗ = G(XQc) (3)"

      "heading" : "2.4 Sparse Coding",
      "text" : "Sparse coding is a method to represent vector representations as a sparse linear combination of elementary atoms of a given dictionary. The underlying assumption of sparse coding is that the input vectors can be reconstructed accurately as a linear combination of some basis vectors and a few number of non-zero coefficients (Olshausen and Field, 1996).\nThe goal is to approximate a dense vector in RL by a sparse linear combination of a few columns of a matrix D ∈ RL×K in which K is a new vector length and the matrix D be called a dictionary. Concretely, given V input vectors of L dimensions X = [x1, x2, ..., xV ], the dictionary and sparse vectors can be formulated as the following minimization problem:\nmin D∈C,Z∈RK×V V∑ i=1 ‖xi −Dzi‖22 + λ‖zi‖1 (7)\nZ = [z1, ..., zV ] carries the decomposition coefficients of X = [x1, x2, ..., xV ]; and λ represents a scalar to control the sparsity level of Z. The dictionary D is typically learned by minimizing Equation 7 over input vectors X. In the case of overcomplete representations Z, the vector length K is typically implied as K = γL (γ > 0).\nIn the method of overcomplete word denoising embeddings (Section 2.2), our approach makes use of overcomplete word embeddings Z as the intermediate word embeddings reconstructed by applying a sparse coding method to word embeddings X. The overcomplete word embeddings Z are then utilized to optimize Equation 4. To obtain overcomplete word embeddings Z and dictionaries, we use the SPAMS package2 to implement sparse coding for word embeddings X and to train the dictionaries D."

The results show that the vectors X∗ and Z∗ outperform the original vectors X,A and B, except for the NP task, in which the vectors B based on the 300-dimensional GloVe vectors are best. The effect of the vectors Z∗ is slightly less impressive, when compared to the overcomplete vectors X∗. The overcomplete word embeddings Z strongly differ from the word embeddings X; hence, the denoising is affected. However, the performance of the vectors Z∗ still outperforms the original vectors X,A and B after the denoising process."

The word denoising embeddings are obtained by strengthening salient information and weakening noise in the original word embeddings, based on a deep feed-forward neural network filter. Results from benchmark tasks show that the filtered word denoising embeddings outperform the original word embeddings.",
