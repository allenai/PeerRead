    "abstractText" : "In this paper we present a method of comput­ ing the posterior probability of conditional independence of two or more continuous vari­ ables from data, examined at several reso­ lutions. Our approach is motivated by the observation that the appearance of continu­ ous data varies widely at various resolutions, producing very different independence esti­ mates between the variables involved. There­ fore, it is difficult to ascertain independence without examining discretized data at sev­ eral carefully selected resolutions. In our paper, we accomplish this using the exact computation of the posterior probability of independence, calculated analytically given a resolution. At each examined resolution and boundary placement, we assume a multi­ nomial distribution with Dirichlet priors for the discretized table parameters, and com­ pute the posterior using Bayesian integra­ tion. Across resolutions, we use a search pro­ cedure to approximate the Bayesian integral of probability over an exponential number of possible boundary placements. Our method generalizes to an arbitrary number variables in a straightforward manner. The test is suitable for Bayesian network learning algo­ rithms that use independence tests to infer the network structure, in domains that con­ tain any mix of continuous, ordinal discrete, and categorical variables.",
