      "text" : "Generating human-level conversations by machine has been a long-term goal of AI since the Turing Test (Turing, 1950). However, as argued by (Vinyals and Le, 2015), the current conversation generation models are still unable to deliver realistic conversations to pass the Test. Amongst the many limitations, the lack of a coherent personality is one of the most challenging difficulties. Though personality is a well-defined concept in psychology (Norman, 1963; Gosling et al., 2003), while in this paper, the personality of a chatbot refers to the character that the bot plays or performs during conversational interactions. In this scenario, personality can be viewed as a composite of the identity (the background and profile) that\na chatbot is endowed with, linguistic style that an agent exhibits during interactions (Walker et al., 1997), and many more explicit and implicit cues that may portray character. Though personality is a more abstract and broad concept, we use personality, profile, and identity interchangeably in this paper.\nEndowing a chatbot with personality is well motivated by the simple example as shown in Table 1. We can clearly see that a general sequenceto-sequence (Seq2Seq) model cannot exhibit coherent personality/identity while our model is more coherent to a given identity. The motivation is also verified by (Yu et al., 2016) which reports that users ask for much personal information of a chatbot in human-machine interaction. It is\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n02 86\n1v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n1 Ju\nn 20\n17\nevident that personal information of a chatbot is much attended by users during conversation, particularly at the early stage of interaction.\nThe recent work dealing with personality in large-scale conversation generation can be seen in (Li et al., 2016) where speaker-specific conversation style is learned by user embedding. Another work which models user personalization can be seen in (Al-Rfou et al., 2016), with a similar technique of user embedding. Both studies require dialogue data from each user to model her/his personality.\nThe major departure to the previous works lies in: First, we address the problem of endowing a chatbot with a given identity. Such a task requires chatbots to generate not only consistent responses, but also responses that are coherent to its prespecified identity/personality. Second, the previous works on personality modeling require conversation data from each user, however, it’s impractical here since dialogue data from the chatbot are unavailable before the release of the chatbot. Instead of just learning personality from dialogue data, our work can assign a desired identity to a chatbot by making use of general conversation data from social media. Our contributions lie in two folds:\n• We investigate the problem of endowing a chatbot with a given identity and enabling a chatbot to generate responses that are coherent to its given identity. Instead of learning personality from dialogue data, our work can assign a desired identity to a chatbot.\n• To address the problem, we propose a model consisting of a profile detector, a position detector, and a bidirectional decoder. Post-level and session-level evaluation shows that when giving an agent profile, our model can generate more coherent responses with more language variety."

      "text" : "There has been a large amount of work for dialogue/conversation generation. These works can be categorized into task-oriented (Young et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2016; Bordes and Weston, 2016) or chat-based. Recently, researchers found that social data such as Twitter/Weibo posts and replies (Ritter et al., 2011; Shang et al., 2015), and\nmovie dialogues can be used to learn and generate spoken language.\nLarge-scale conversation generation with social media data was firstly proposed in (Ritter et al., 2011) and has been greatly advanced by applying sequence-to-sequence models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Sordoni et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2015; Serban et al., 2015, 2016). Many studies are focusing on improving the generation quality. These works include: dealing with unknown words (Gu et al., 2016; Gulcehre et al., 2016), avoiding universal responses (Jiwei Li, 2016), generating more diverse and meaningful responses (Xing et al., 2017; Mou et al., 2016), and many more.\nAs argued by (Vinyals and Le, 2015), it’s still quite impossible for current chatbots to pass the Turing Test, while one of the reasons is the lack of a coherent personality. Though personality has been well defined in psychology (Norman, 1963), it is implicit, subtle, and challenging to formally define in statistical language generation. Linguistic style can be an indicator of personality (Mairesse and Walker, 2006; Mairesse et al., 2007), and conversation can be clues for personality recognition (Walker et al., 1997, 2012). In reverse, spoken language can be generated in accordance to particular personality (Mairesse and Walker, 2007).\nA first attempt to model persona can be seen in (Li et al., 2016) where the authors proposed to learn speaker-specific conversation style by user embedding. Our work differs from this work significantly: our task is to endow the chatbot with a fixed personality while (Li et al., 2016) learns personalized conversational styles. In other words, our task requires to generate not only consistent responses, but also responses that are coherent to the chatbot’s prespecified identity. Further, (Li et al., 2016) requires many dialogue data from each user while our work has no such requirement.\nAnother related work is generative question answering (GenQA) (Yin et al., 2015) which generates a response containing an answer extracted from a knowledge base (KB). However, endowing a chatbot with personality is more than just question answering over KB, where there arise challenging problems such as semantic reasoning and conversation style modeling. Further, GenQA requires that the answer from KB must appear in the response to provide sufficient supervision while\nour work avoids the limitation by applying a position detector during training."

The generation process can be briefly stated as below:\nP (y|x, {< ki, vi >}) =P (z = 0|x) · P fr(y|x) +P (z = 1|x) · P bi(y|x, {< ki, vi >})\n(1)\nwhere P (z|x) is the probability of using the agent profile given post x, which is computed by the Profile Detector; P fr(y|x) =∏m\nt=1P fr(yt|y<t,x) is given by a general forward decoder, the same as (Sutskever et al., 2014), and P bi(y|x, {< ki, vi >}) is given by a Bidirectional Decoder which will be described later.\nNote that the post/response pairs < x,y > are collected from social media, and the agent profile value may not occur in the response y. This leads to the discrepancy between training and test, which will be addressed in the Position Detector section."

If not, a general seq2seq decoder will be used to generate the response; otherwise, the profile detector will further select an appropriate profile key and\nits value. Starting from the selected profile value, a response will be generated forward and backward by the bidirectional decoder. To better train the bidirectional decoder (see Figure 2), the position detector addresses the discrepancy issue between training and test, by predicting a word position from which decoding should start given the selected profile value. Note that the position detector will not participate in generation during test."

Given a post x = x1x2 · · ·xn, the hidden states of the post h = (h1, h2, · · ·, hn) are obtained by a gated recurrent unit (GRU) (Chung et al., 2014), as follows:\nht = GRU(ht−1, xt) (2)\nwhere xt is the embedding of the t-th word."

      "heading" : "3.4 Profile Detector",
      "text" : "The profile detector has two roles: first to detect whether the post should be responded with the agent profile, and second to select a specific profile < key, value > to be addressed in the decoder. The first role of the profile detector is defined by the probability P (z|x) (z ∈ {0, 1}) where z = 1 means the agent profile should be used. For instance, if the post is “how old is your father”, P (z = 1|x) ≈ 0, while if the post is “how old are you”, P (z = 1|x) ≈ 1. P (z|x) is a binary classifier trained on supervised data. More formally, the probability is computed as follows:\nP (z|x) = P (z|h̃) = σ(Wph̃) (3)\nwhere Wp is the parameter of the classifier and h̃ = ∑ j hj , simply the sum of all hidden states, but other elaborated methods such as attentionbased models are also applicable.\nThe second role of the profile detector is to decide which profile value should be addressed in a generated response. This is implemented as follows:\nβi = MLP([h̃, ki, vi])\n= f(W · [h̃; ki; vi]) (4)\nwhereW is the weight and ki/vi is the embedding of a profile key/value respectively, they are all parameters of our model. h̃ = ∑ j hj is the representation of the post. f is a nonlinear activation\nfunction, in this equation f is a softmax function over all βi. The above equation can be viewed as a multi-class classifier that produces a probability distribution over profile keys.\nThe optimal profile value is selected with the maximal probability: ṽ = vj where j = argmaxi(βi). As long as a profile value ṽ is obtained, the decoding process will be determined by the bidirectional decoder, as follows:\nP bi(y|x, {< ki, vi >}) = P bi(y|x, ṽ) (5)"

      "heading" : "3.5 The Bidirectional Decoder",
      "text" : "This decoder aims to generate a response in which a profile value will be mentioned. Inspired by (Mou et al., 2016), we design a bidirectional decoder which consists of a backward decoder and forward decoder, but with a key difference that a position detector is employed to predict a start decoding position.\nSuppose a generated response is y = (yb, ṽ,yf ) = (yb1, · · · , ybt−1, ṽ, y f t+1, · · · , y f m) where ṽ is a selected profile value. The bidirectional decoder will generate yb in a backward direction and yf forward. The backward decoder (P b) generates yb from the given profile value ṽ to the start of the response. The forward decoder (P f )1 generates yf from ṽ to the end of the response, but takes as input the already generated first half, yb. The process is defined formally as follows:\nP bi(y|x, ṽ) = P b(yb|x, ṽ) ∗ P f (yf |yb,x, ṽ)) P b(yb|x, ṽ) = 1∏\nj=t−1 P b(ybj |yb>j ,x, ṽ)\nP f (yf |yb,x, ṽ) = m∏\nj=t+1\nP f (yfj |y f <j ,y b,x, ṽ)\n(6)\nIn order to encode more contexts in the forward decoder, the first half of generated response (yb), along with the profile value (ṽ), serves as initial input to the forward decoder. The probability P b and P f is calculated via\nP b(ybj |yb>j ,x, ṽ) ∝MLP([sbj ; ybj+1; cbj ]) P f (yfj |y f <j ,y b,x, ṽ) ∝MLP([sfj ; y f j−1; c f j ])\n(7)\nwhere s(∗)j is the state of the corresponding decoder, c(∗)j is the context vector, and ∗ ∈ {b, f} 1Note that this decoder is different from P fr(yt|y<t,x).\nwhere b indicates the backward decoder and f the forward. The vectors are updated as follows:\ns (∗) j = GRU(s (∗) j+l, [y (∗) j+l; c (∗) j ])\nc (∗) j = n∑ t=1 α (∗) j,t ht\n(8)\nwhere α(∗)j,t ∝ MLP([s (∗) j+l, ht]) can be viewed as the similarity between decoder state s(∗)j+l and encoder hidden state ht, l = 1 when ∗ = b (backward), and l = −1 when ∗ = f (forward). And these MLPs have the same form as Eq.4, but with different parameters."

      "heading" : "3.6 Position Detector",
      "text" : "The position detector is designed to provide more supervision to the bidirectional decoder, which is only used during training. As mentioned, the bidirectional decoder starts from a profile value to generate the entire sequence at the test stage. However, in our training dataset, the profile values may be rarely mentioned in the responses. For instance, given the profile key value pair <爱 好, 冰球> (< hobby, hockey >), the value 冰 球(hockey) rarely occurs in the training corpus. In other words, even though we have a training instance (x,y, < k, v >), the value (v) may not occur in y at all. Hence, the bidirectional decoder is not aware from which word decoding should start. This leads to the discrepancy between training and test: during training, the decoder is unaware of the start decoding position but during test, the start decoding word is given.\nThis issue makes our work differ substantially from previous approaches where supervision is directly observable either between post and response (Gu et al., 2016) or between response and knowledge base (Yin et al., 2015). Experiments also show that the position detector contributes much to the performance improvement than a random position picking strategy (Mou et al., 2016).\nThe position detector is designed to provide a start decoding position to the decoder during training. For instance, given a post x =“你-1 有-2 什么-3 特长-4 ？-5 (what’s your speciality?)2” and a response y =“我-1非常-2擅长-3小提琴4(I am good at playing violin)”, and a profile key value pair “<特长,钢琴> (< hobby, piano >)”, the position detector will predict that “小提琴-4 (violin)” in the response can be replaced by the profile value “钢琴(piano)” to ensure grammaticality. The predicted position “小提琴-4 (violin)” is then passed to the decoder (see Eq. 6) to signal the start decoding position.\nIn order to find an appropriate position at which the profile value can be replaced, we need to estimate the probability: P (j|y1y2 · · · ym, < k, v > )), 1 ≤ j ≤ m which indicates how likely the word yj can be replaced by the profile value v.\nWe apply a simple technique to approximate the probability: a word can be replaced by a given profile value if the word has maximal similarity.\nP (j|y, < k, v >)) ∝ cos(yj , v) (9)\nwhere cos(yj , v) denotes the cosine similarity between a word in a response and a profile value. More elaborated techniques, for instance, language models, will be studied as future work."

      "heading" : "3.7 Loss Function and Training",
      "text" : "Two loss functions are defined: one on the generation probability and the other on the profile detector. The first loss is defined as below:\nL1(θ,D(c), D(x,y)) =− ∑\n(x,y)∈D(c)∪D(pr) logP (y|x, {< ki, vi >})\n=− ∑\n(x,y)∈D(c) logP fr(y|x)\n− ∑\n(x,y)∈D(pr) logP bi(y|x, ṽ)\n(10)\n2The number indicates the position of each word.\nThe first term is the negative log likelihood of observing D(c) and the second term for D(pr). ṽ is a word in y whose position is predicted by the position detector during training. D(pr) consists of pairs where a post is related to a profile key and its response gives a meaningful reaction to the post, and D(c) has only general post-response pairs.\nThe two decoders (P fr andP bi) have no shared parameters. Since the number of instances in D(c) is much larger than that of D(pr), we apply a twostage training strategy: D(c) will be used to train P bi at the early stage for several epoches, where ṽ is a randomly chosen word in a response, and then D(pr) for further training at the later stage.\nThe above formulation generally adopts the hard form of P (z|x) (see Eq. 3): P (z = 1|x) = 1 for profile-related pairs and P (z = 1|x) = 0 for others. In order to better supervise the learning of the profile detector, we define the second loss and add it to the first one with a weight α as the overall loss (i.e., L = L1 + αL2):\nL2(θ,D(pb), D(pr)) =− ∑\n(x,y,z)∈D(pb) logP (z|x)\n− ∑\n(x,y,k̂)∈D(pr)\nK∑ j=1 β̂jlogβj\n(11)\nwhere the first term is for binary prediction of using profile or not, and the second for profile key selection. k̂ is the profile key whose value should be addressed, K is the total number of keys, β is the predicted distribution over profile keys as defined by Eq. 4, and β̂ is one-hot representation of the gold distribution over keys. < x,y, z > is obtained by manual annotation while (x,y, k̂) is obtained by matching the keywords and synonyms in the profile with the post, which is noisy. This works well in practice and reduces manual labors largely."

At the session level, we evaluate the models from the aspects of consistency and variety to justify the performance in the real conversational setting.\nWe name our model Identity-Coherent Conversation Machine (ICCM) and compare it with several baselines: Seq2Seq: a general sequence to sequence model (Sutskever et al., 2014). Seq2Seq + Profile Value (+PV): if the profile detector decides that a profile value should be used (P (z|x) > 0.5), the response is simply the value of the key decided by the profile detector (see Eq. 4); otherwise, a general seq2seq decoder will be used. Seq2Seq + Profile Value Decoding (+PVD): the response is generated by a general seq2seq de-\ncoder which starts decoding forwardly from the value of the selected key.

Each post is input to all the models to get the corresponding responses. Thus, each post has 5 responses and these responses are randomly shuffled and then presented to two curators. Post-response pairs are annotated according to the following metrics, based on a 1/0 scoring schema: Naturalness (Nat.) measures the fluency and grammaticality of a response. Too short responses will be judged as lack of naturalness. Logic measures whether the response is a logical reaction to a post. For instance, for post “how old are you”, a logical response could be “I am 3 years old” or “I do not know”. Correctness (Cor.) measures whether the response provides a correct answer to a post given the profile. For instance, for post “how old are you”, if the profile has a key value pair like < age, 3 >, responses like “I am 18” will be judged as wrong.\nEach response is judged by two curators. The Cohen’s Kappa statistics are 0.46, 0.75 and 0.82 for naturalness, logic, and correctness respectively. Naturalness has a rather lower Kapp because it is more difficult to judge.\nResults in Table 4 support the following statements: First, our model is better than all other baselines in all metrics, indicating that our model can generate more natural, logical, and correct responses; Second, in comparison to simply responding with a profile value (Seq2Seq+PV) where the responses are generally too short, our model can generate more natural responses; Third, the position detection contributes to better generation, in comparison to a random position (ICCM vs. ICCM-Pos).

Score 1 indicates that all the three responses are consistent to the profile, and score 0 otherwise. Variety measures the language variety of the three responses in a session. Score 1 indicates that the linguistic patterns and wordings are different between any two of them, and score 0 otherwise.\nResults are shown in Table 6 and we show some session examples in Table 5.\nWe can clearly see the following observations: 1) Our model is remarkably better than all the baselines w.r.t both metrics. Results of our model against Seq2Seq+PVD indicate that the bidirectional decoder can generate responses of much richer language variety.

There are many future directions: Conversation style: we have demonstrated that general conversation data can be used to generate profile-coherent responses. Can conversation style that is coherent to a chatbot’s personality be modeled without stylistic dialogue data? Learning conversation styles such as talking like young girls or old adults, and introverts or extroverts, will be an interesting direction. Semantic reasoning: Endowing a chatbot with personality/identity arises the issue of semantic reasoning.

In this paper, we address the issue of generating responses that are coherent to a pre-specified agent profile. We design a model consisting of three modules: a profile detector to decide whether a post should be responded using the profile and which key should be addressed, a bidirectional decoder to generate responses forward and backward starting from a selected profile value, and a position detector that predicts a word position from which decoding should start given a selected profile value. We show that general conversation data from social media can be used to generate profile-coherent responses. Manual and automatic evaluation shows that our model can deliver more coherent, natural, and diversified responses.",
