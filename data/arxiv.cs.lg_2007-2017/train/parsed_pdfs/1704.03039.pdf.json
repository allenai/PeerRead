      "text" : "Significant advances in object recognition have been recently achieved with the introduction of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The main limitation of this approach is the effort required to 1) collect and annotate millions of images necessary to train these models, and 2) the complexity of training a CNN from scratch. In fact, most recent computer vision papers use or adapt a small set of popular models, such as AlexNet [28], GoogLeNet [54], and VGG [51], learned from the Imagenet dataset [13]. Hence, there is an interest in techniques for transfer learning, where\nThis work was funded by graduate fellowship SFRH/BD/109135/2015 from the Portuguese Ministry of Sciences and Education and NRI Grants IIS-1208522 and IIS-1637941 from the National Science Foundation.\na model learned on a dataset is used to recognize object classes that are not represented in it. Ideally, transfer learning methods would replicate the human ability to recognize objects from a few example images or even from a description in terms of concepts in some semantic vocabulary.\nThis has motivated the introduction of semantic representations for object recognition [34, 44, 45, 55, 56], which rely on a predefined vocabulary of visual concepts to define a semantic space S and a set of classifiers to map each image into that space. The scores of these classifiers can then be used as semantic features for object classification. Furthermore, because simple rules of thumb can be designed, a priori, to describe new object classes in terms of these semantics, the image mapping into S can be exploited to recognize previously unseen objects. This is known as zeroshot learning (ZSL) [2, 4, 14, 31, 48, 49].\nThe fundamental difficulty of ZSL is that training cannot be guided by the end goal of the classifier. While the recognizer is learned from a set of training classes, it must provide accurate predictions for image classification into a non-overlapping set of unseen or zero-shot (ZS) classes. Historically, early efforts were devoted to the identification of good semantics for ZSL. This motivated the collection of datasets containing images annotated with respect to semantics such as visual attributes [14,31]. Subsequent works addressed the design of the semantic space S, using one of two strategies previously proposed in the semantic representation literature. The first, recognition using independent semantics (RIS), consists of learning an independent classifier per semantic [34, 55, 56]. Due to its simplicity, RIS became widely popular in the attribute recognition literature [14,31,42,48,53,58]. Notwithstanding efforts in discriminant attribute discovery [9, 14, 30, 42, 46] or modeling of uncertainty [25,31,58], learning semantics independently proved too weak to guarantee reliable ZS predictions.\nThis motivated a shift to the second strategy, which ties the design of S to the goal of recognition, by learning a single multi-class classifier that optimally discriminates between all training classes [44, 45]. The difficulty of extending this approach to ZSL is that the semantics of interest\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n03 03\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n0 A\npr 2\n01 7\nare not the classes themselves. [2] proposed an effective solution to this problem by noting that there is a fixed linear transformation, or embedding, between the semantics of interest and the class labels, which can be specified by hand, even for ZS classes. This was accomplished using a label embedding function φ, to map each class y into a vector φ(y) in the space of attributes. Recently, various works have proposed variations on this approach [1,4,35,43,47,49]. We refer to this class of methods as recognition using semantic embeddings (RULE). By learning all semantics simultaneously, RULE is able to leverage dependencies between concepts, thus addressing the main limitation of RIS.\nIn this work, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches for implementations based on deep learning and CNNs. We show that, in this context, the two methods reduce to a set of constraints on the CNN architecture: RIS learns a bank of independent CNNs, and RULE uses a single CNN with fixed weights in the final layer. It follows that the performance of the two approaches is constrained by the form in which supervision is provided on the space A of image attributes. While RIS provides supervision along each dimension independently, RULE does so along the subspace spanned by the label embedding directions φ(y). Because the number of attributes is usually larger than classes, this exposes the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. On one hand, RIS supervises all attributes but cannot model their dependencies. On the other, RULE models dependencies but leaves a large number of dimensions of A unconstrained.\nTo exploit this complementarity, we propose a new framework denoted Semantically COnsistent REgularization (SCoRe) that leverages the advantages of both RIS and RULE. This is achieved by recognizing that the two methods exploit semantics as constraints for recognition. While RIS enforces first-order constraints (single semantics), RULE focuses second-order (linear combinations). However, both are suboptimal for ZSL. RIS ignores the recognition of training classes, sacrificing the modeling of semantic dependencies, and RULE ignores a large subspace of A and fixes network weights. SCoRe addresses these problems by exploiting the view of a CNN as an optimal classifier with respect to a multidimensional classification code, implemented at the top CNN layer. It interprets this code as a mapping between semantics (layer before last) and classes (last layer). It then enforces both first and secondorder regularization constraints through a combination of 1) an RIS like loss-based regularizer that constraints semantic predictions, and 2) a codeword regularizer that favors classification codes consistent with RULE embeddings."

      "text" : "Semantics Semantics are visual descriptions that convey meaning about an image x ∈ X , and may include any\nmeasurable visual property: discrete or continuous, numerical or categorical. Given a semantic vocabulary V = {v1, . . . , vQ}, a semantic feature space S is defined as the Cartesian product of the vector spaces Sk associated with each semantic vk, S = S1 × · · · × SQ. A classifier is denoted semantic if it operates on S. As an example, for animal recognition, a semantic vocabulary containing visual attributes, e.g. V ∈ {furry, has legs, is brown, etc.}, is usually defined along with their corresponding vector spaces. In this case, since all semantics are binary, Sk = R where large positive values indicate the attribute presence, and large negative values, its absence.\nEarly approaches to semantic recognition [45] used the set of image classes to be recognized as the semantic vocabulary. The rationale is to create a feature space with a high-level abstraction, where operations such as image search [44] or classification [34, 45] can be performed more robustly. More recently, there has been substantial interest in semantic feature spaces for transfer learning, which use an auxiliary semantic vocabulary, defined by mid-level visual concepts. Three main categories of concepts have been explored, including visual attributes, hierarchies and word vector representations. Attributes were introduced in [14, 31] and quickly adopted in many other works [2,8,21,23–25,27,48,53,58,60]. Semantic concepts extracted from hierarchies/taxonomies were later explored in [2,4,48,60], and vector representations for words/entities in [4, 8, 16, 18, 20, 41, 43, 47, 60].\nZero-shot learning Most current solutions to ZSL fall under two main categories: RIS and RULE. Early approaches adopted the RIS strategy. One of the most popular among these is the direct attribute prediction (DAP) method [31], which learns attributes independently using SVMs and infers ZS predictions by a maximum a posteriori rule that assumes attribute independence. Several enhancements have been proposed to account for attribute correlations a posteriori, e.g. by using CRFs to model attribute/class correlations [10], directed Bayesian networks to merge attribute predictions into class scores [58], or random forests learned so as to mitigate the effect of unreliable attributes [25]. More recently, [37] proposed a multiplicative framework that enables class-specific attribute classifiers, and [5] learns independent attributes which were previously discovered from Word2Vec representations.\nRULE is an alternative strategy that exploits the one-toone relationship between semantics and object classes. The central idea is to define an embedding φ(·) that maps each class y into a Q-dimensional vector of attribute states φ(y) that identifies it. A bilinear compatibility function\nh(x, y;T) = φ(y)TTT θ(x) (1)\nof parameters T ∈ Rd×Q is then defined between the feature vector θ(x) ∈ Rd of image x and the encoding of its\nclass y. In the first implementation of RULE for ZSL [2], T is learned by a variant of the structured SVM. Several variants have been proposed, such as the addition of different regularization terms [43,49], the use of least-squares losses for faster training [49], or improved semantic representations of objects learned from multiple text sources [1, 47]."

      "text" : "Both Deep-RIS and Deep-RULE have advantages and disadvantages, which can be observed by comparing the risks of (3) and (6). Since the attributes ak(x) are the quantities of interest for ZSL, it is useful to understand how the two methods provide supervision to the space A of attributes. From (3), Deep-RIS provides supervision to the individual attributes ak(x). Since ak(·) = 1Tk a(·), where 1k is the kth vector in the canonical basis (1 in the kth position and 0 elsewhere), the supervision is along the canonical directions of A. On the other hand, (5)-(6) only depend on the projections φ(y)Ta(x) of a(·) along the vector encodings φ(·) of all training classes. Hence, RULE only provides supervision to the the column space C(Φ) of Φ.\nIn practice, we are often on the regime of Figure 1, where the number of attributes Q is larger than the number of training classes C. It follows that C(Φ) can be fairly low dimensional (dimension C) and the left null space N (ΦT ) fairly high dimensional (dimension Q − C). Hence, while RIS constraints all attributes, RULE leaves Q− C attribute dimensions unconstrained. In this case, ZS classes with semantic codes φZS misaligned with C(Φ) cannot be expected to be accurately predicted. In the limit, RULE is completely inadequate to discriminate ZS classes when φZS is perpendicular to C(Φ), such as φZS(1) in Figure 1. This suggests the superiority of RIS over RULE. However, because RIS supervises attributes independently, it has no ability to learn attribute dependencies, e.g. that the attributes “has wings” and “lives in the water” have a strong negative correlation. These dependencies can be thought of as constraints that reduce the effective dimensionality of the attribute space. They imply that the attribute vectors a(x) of natural images do not spanA, but only an effective attribute subspaceA′ of dimension Q′ < Q. By learning only on C(Φ) ⊂ A′, DeepRULE provides supervision explicitly in this space. This suggests that Deep-RULE should outperform Deep-RIS.\nOverall, the relative performance of the two approaches depends on the overlap between the subspaces of A′ covered by the training and ZS classes, denoted A′T and A′ZS respectively. If A′T contains all the directions φZS that defineA′ZS , Deep-RULE will outperform Deep-RIS. If the ZS classes are defined by directions φZS not contained in A′T , Deep-RIS will likely outperform Deep-RULE."

In an ideal scenario, A′T = A′ and so φZS(c) ∈ A′T for any ZS class c. However, this is unlikely to happen for datasets of tractable size, and the subsets A′T and A′ZS are most likely not aligned.\nUnder this scenario, Deep-RIS and Deep-RULE compliment each other. While Deep-RIS enforces first-order constraints on the statistics of single attributes, Deep-RULE enforces second-order constraints, by constraining the statistics of linear attribute combinations. If the two strategies are combined, Deep-RULE can explain attribute dependencies that appear on both training and ZS classes, leaving to Deep-RIS the task of constraining the attribute distribution on the remainder of the space. It is, thus, natural to combine the two strategies. We accomplish this by mapping them into regularization constraints."

Common usages of Ω[·] include shrinkage [22], sparse representations [11] or weight decay [29]. Since all these approaches simply favor solutions of low complexity, they are a form of task-insensitive regularization. For ZSL, this type of regularization has indeed been used to control the variance of 1) semantic scores or 2) backward projections of object embeddings into the feature space [49], as well as to suppress noisy semantics [43].\nIn this work, rather than a generic penalty on the complexity of h(.), we propose a task-sensitive form of regularization, which favors score functions h(·) with the added functionality of attribute prediction.

We denote wc as the classification code of class c. For example, in binary classification, algorithms such as boosting [15] or SVM [12] simply choose 1/ − 1 as the codewords of the positive/negative class.Similarly, for C-ary classification, neural networks [33] or multi-class SVMs [59] rely on one-hot encodings that lead to the typical decision rule y∗ = arg maxj∈{1,...,C} fj(x). There is, however, no reason to be limited by these classical sets.\nBy comparing the score functions of (5) and (9), DeepRULE can be interpreted as learning the optimal predictor a(x) for a classification code given by (4), i.e. wc = φ(c). Hence, Deep-RULE can be seen as a form of very strict CNN regularization, where the final fully-connected layer is set to these semantic codes. In general, fixing network weights is undesirable, as better results are usually obtained by learning them from data. We avoid this by using the semantic codes φ(c) as loose regularization constraints, under the framework of (8). Similarly to Deep-RULE, we learn the predictor f using cross-entropy as the empirical risk RE , and score functions of the form\nh(x;W,T,Θ) = WT f(x) = WTTT θ(x; Θ) (10)\nwhere the columns of W contain the weight vectors wc of the last CNN layer.

When λ = β = 0, all the regularization constraints are disregarded and the classifier is a standard recognizer for the training classes. Increasing λ and β improves its transfer ability. On one hand, regardless of β, increasing λ makes SCoRe more like Deep-RIS. In the limit of λ → ∞, the first summation plays no role in the optimization, Ω is trivially minimized by wc = φ(c), and (13) is reduced to the Deep-RIS optimization problem of (3). On the other hand, maintaining λ = 0 while increasing β makes SCoRe similar Deep-RULE. For large values of β, the learning algorithm emphasizes the similarity between classification and semantic codes, trading off classification performance for semantic alignment.

Then, the semantic code φ(y) of class y is built by concatenating φk(y) for all k, as in (14).

These could be used to reflect further semantic information. In the tree of Figure 2, V(1) could encode a set of attributes that distinguish aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial animals, such as “has fins,” “has legs” or “has wings”. In this work, since no semantic information is available beyond the taxonomy itself, we rely on the maximally separated codeword sets of [50]. Under this procedure, aQ-ways decision is mapped into the set of codewords defined as the vertices of aQ-sided regular polygon in Q− 1 dimensions centered at the origin.\nWord2Vec Word2Vec is a procedure to generate word embeddings. A word w is mapped into a high-dimensional vector ξ(w) ∈ χ by a neural network trained from large text corpora to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. For semantic annotation, this mapping is used as the semantic code, i.e. each class y is encoded by the vector φ(y) = ξ(y).\nIn this work, we use the skip-gram architecture proposed by Mikolov et al. [39]. Its embeddings are determined by two parameters: size of the encoding layer and the window size that defines a context for each word. Rather than relying on a single model, we learn Q Word2Vec embeddings ξk(y), k ∈ {1, . . . , Q}, using Q different combinations of the two parameters. This createsQ codeword sets V(k). The semantic code then represents class c by a string of the resulting vectors φk(y) = ξk(y), using (14)."

A separate set of validation classes (10/50/6 for the AwA/CUB/IFCB datasets, respectively) was also drawn randomly to tune SCoRe parameters.\nImage representation: Images were resized to 256×256 pixels, with the exception of IFCB, where aspect ratios differ widely and resizing introduces considerable distortion. Instead, each image was first resized along the longest axis and the shortest axis then padded with the average pixel value, to preserve the aspect ratio. Typical data augmentation techniques were used for training (random cropping and mirroring), and the center crop was used for testing. Three CNN architectures were used to implement θ(x): AlexNet [28] (layer fc7), GoogLeNet [54] (layer pool5) and VGG19 [51] (layer fc7).\nSemantics: Three sources of semantics were evaluated. Visual attributes: Continuous attributes have been shown to be superior to their binary counterparts and were used on AwA and CUB. On IFCB, where no attributes were defined previously, a list of 35 visual attributes was assembled and annotated by an expert with binary labels, using several sources from the oceanographic community [7, 38].\nTaxonomies were created by pruning the WordNet tree [40] for the training and ZS classes, and eliminating dummy nodes containing a single child. In the rare situations where WordNet was not fine-grained enough to distinguish between a set of classes, the taxonomy was expanded by simply assigning each object into its own leaf.\nWord2Vec models were trained on a Wikipedia archive, dated June 1st, 2016. Three different window sizes (3, 5 and 10) and vector dimensions (50, 100 and 500) were used, leading to a total of 9 Word2Vec codeword sets."

      "text" : "Gains of regularization: We started by evaluating codeword and loss-based regularization. The importance of the two regularizers was assessed separately on all datasets using visual attributes and GoogLeNet. In both cases, we measured the gains over Deep-RULE, in which classification codewords are set to wc = φ(c) and λ = 0. The gains of loss-based regularization were evaluated by increasing λ while keeping β = 0. Under this setting, the classifier converges to Deep-RIS in the limit of λ → ∞. Conversely, the gains of codeword regularization were measured by increasing β while keeping λ = 0. In this case, the classifier converges to an unrestricted object recognizer when β = 0 and to Deep-RULE when β →∞. Figure 4 presents the absolute improvement in ZS mean class accuracy (ZS-MCA) over Deep-RULE, as a function of the Lagrange multipliers.\nBoth regularizers produced gains over Deep-RULE with absolute gains as high as 3 ZS-MCA points. This demonstrates the importance of learning the classification codewords, rather than fixing them. Note that, for codeword regularization, best results were obtained for intermediate values of β, which encourage consistency between the se-\nmantic and classification codes, but leave enough flexibility to learn a classification code superior to its semantic counterpart. In all cases, the MCA of SCoRe was much superior to that of RIS, confirming the importance of modeling attribute dependencies through the first term of (13). Finally, SCoRe performance was also superior to that of the unrestricted CNN. This demonstrates the benefits of regularization. Interestingly, this was not the case of RIS, which always underperformed the unrestricted CNN, or RULE that only achieved on par results in CUB and IFCB1.\nIn Section 3.3, we hypothesized that loss-based regularization becomes more important as the alignment between the subspaces of A′ spanned by training and ZS classes decreases. To test this hypothesis, we measured this alignment by computing the average orthogonal distance between the semantic codeword φ(c) of each ZS class and the subspace spanned by the codewords of training classes. The average distances were 0.1244 for CUB, 0.3063 for AwA, and 0.4181 for IFCB, indicating that the transfer is easiest for CUB and hardest for IFC. This is consistent with the plots of Figure 4, which show largest gains of loss-based regularization on IFCB followed by AwA and then CUB.\nComparisons to state-of-the-art methods: A comparison to the literature is not trivial since methods differ in 1) CNN implementation, 2) train/ZS class partitioning, and 3) semantic space representation. To mitigate these differences, we focused on attribute semantics which have most available results. Methods that use alternative semantics [1, 19, 43, 47] or that use unlabeled images from ZS classes for training [17,18,27,36] were disregarded for this comparison. Deep-SCoRe hyper-parameters λ and β were tuned on a subset of the training classes.\nTable 3 compares our ZS-MCA to previous approaches\n1The unrestricted CNN is initialized with semantic codes. If random initialization was used, ZSL would not be possible.\nusing three CNN architectures: AlexNet, GoogLeNet and VGG19. Although results vary drastically with CNN, it is clear that Deep-SCoRe outperforms all previous approaches on all datasets, achieving impressive gains over the stateof-the-art for every architecture: 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.5% on AwA and 7.9%, 3.7% and 10.5% on CUB with AlexNet, GoogLeNet and VGG19, respectively.\nMultiple semantics: We finally studied the performance of Deep-SCoRe with attributes, taxonomies, and Word2Vec embeddings. Figure 5 compares Deep-SCoRe and its variants to popular RIS and RULE approaches in the literature: DAP [31] (RIS), SJE [4] and ES-ZSL [49] (RULE). All approaches were implemented with the semantic codes of Section 5. The best results, which were all obtained with Deep-SCoRe, are also shown. Figure 5 supports two main conclusions. First, as shown in [3, 8, 60], attributes enable by far the most effective transfer. This is not surprising since attributes tend to be discriminant properties of the various object classes. Taxonomies or Word2Vec are most informative of grouping or contextual information. Second, while all approaches rely on regularization, the nature of this regularization matters. The task-sensitive regularization of Deep-SCoRe always outperformed the taskinsensitive regularization of ES-ZSL, and the combination of loss-based and codeword regularization (Deep-SCoRe) always outperformed a fixed semantic code (Deep-RULE and SJE) or loss-based regularization (Deep-RIS and DAP)."

The complementarity found between class and semantic supervision lead to the introduction of a new ZSL procedure, denoted SCoRe, where a CNN is learned together with a semantic codeword set and two forms of semantic constraints: loss-based and codeword regularization. State-of-the-art zero-shot performance was achieved in various datasets."

    "abstractText" : "The role of semantics in zero-shot learning is considered. The effectiveness of previous approaches is analyzed according to the form of supervision provided. While some learn semantics independently, others only supervise the semantic subspace explained by training classes. Thus, the former is able to constrain the whole space but lacks the ability to model semantic correlations. The latter addresses this issue but leaves part of the semantic space unsupervised. This complementarity is exploited in a new convolutional neural network (CNN) framework, which proposes the use of semantics as constraints for recognition.Although a CNN trained for classification has no transfer ability, this can be encouraged by learning an hidden semantic layer together with a semantic code for classification. Two forms of semantic constraints are then introduced. The first is a loss-based regularizer that introduces a generalization constraint on each semantic predictor. The second is a codeword regularizer that favors semantic-to-class mappings consistent with prior semantic knowledge while allowing these to be learned from data. Significant improvements over the state-of-the-art are achieved on several datasets.",
