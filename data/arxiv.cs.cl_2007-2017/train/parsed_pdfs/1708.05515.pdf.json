      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit dynamic temporal behavior which makes them ideal architectures to model sequential data. In recent times, RNNs have shown state of the art performance on tasks of language modeling (RNN-LM), beating the statistical modeling techniques by a huge margin (Mikolov et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016; Miyamoto and Cho, 2016). RNN-LMs model the probability distribution over the words in vocabulary conditioned on a given input context. The sizes of these networks are primarily dependent on their vocabulary size.\nSince agglutinative languages, such as Korean, Japanese, and Turkish, have a huge number of words in the vocabulary, it is considerably hard to train word-level RNN-LM. Korean is agglutinative in its morphology; words mainly contain different morphemes to determine the meaning of the word hence increasing the vocabulary size for language model training. A given word in Korean\n∗ Equal contribution\ncould have similar meaning with more than 10 variations in the suffix as shown in Table 1.\nVarious language modeling methods that rely on character or morpheme like segmentation of words have been developed (Ciloglu et al., 2004; Cui et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2016; Mikolov et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2013; Ling et al., 2015). (Chen et al., 2015b) explored the idea of joint training for character and word embedding. Morpheme based segmentation has been explored in both Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) tasks for Egyptian Arabic (Mousa et al., 2013) and German newspaper corpus (Cotterell and Schütze, 2015). (Sennrich et al., 2015) used subword units to perform machine translation for rare words.\nMorpheme distribution has a relatively smaller frequency tail as compared to the word distribution from vocabulary, hence avoids over-fitting for tail units. However, even with morpheme segmentation the percentage of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words is significantly high in Korean. Character embedding in Korean is unfeasible as the context of the word is not sufficiently captured by the long sequence which composes the word. We select as features syllable-level embedding which has shorter sequence length and morpheme-level embedding to capture the semantics of the word.\nWe deploy our model for input word prediction on mobile devices. To achieve desirable performance we are required to create a model that has as small as possible memory and CPU footprint without compromising its performance. We use differentiated softmax (Chen et al., 2015a) for the output layer. This method uses more parameters for the words that are frequent and less for the ones that occur rarely. We achieve better performance than existing approaches in terms of Key Stroke Savings (KSS) (Fowler et al., 2015) and our approach has been commercialized."

In Section 2.1 we discuss the basic architecture of the model as detailed in Figure 1, followed by Section 2.2 that describes our embeddings. In Section 2.3 we propose an adaptation of differentiated softmax to reduce the number of model parameters and improve computation speed."

      "heading" : "2.1 Language Model",
      "text" : "Overall architecture of our language model consists of a) embedding layer, b) hidden layer, c) softmax layer. Embedding comprises of syllablelevel and morpheme-level embedding as described in Section 2.2. We combine both embedding features and pass them through a highway network (Srivastava et al., 2015) which act as an input to the hidden layers. We use a single layer of LSTM as hidden units with architecture similar to the non-regularized LSTM model by (Zaremba et al., 2014). The hidden state of the LSTM unit is affinetransformed by the softmax function, which is a probability distribution over all the words in the output vocabulary."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.2 Syllable & Morphological Embedding",
      "text" : "We propose syllable-level embedding that attenuates OOV problem. (Santos and Zadrozny, 2014; Kim et al., 2016) proposed character aware neural networks using convolution filters to create character embedding for words. We use convolution neural network (CNN) based embedding method to get syllable-level embedding for words. We use 150 filters that consider uni, bi, tri and quad syllable-grams to create a feature representation for the word. This is followed by max-pooling to concatenate the features from each class of filters resulting in a syllable embedding representation\nfor the word. Figure 2 in the left half shows an example sentence embedded using the syllable-level embedding.\nFigure 3 highlights the difference between various embedding and the features they capture. The syllable embedding is used along with a morphological embedding to provide richer features for the word. The majority of words (95%) in Korean has at most three morphological units. Each word can be broken into start, middle, and end unit. We embed each morphological unit by concatenating to create a joint embedding for the word. Advantage of morphological embedding over syllable is all the sub-units have an abstract value in the language and this creates representation for words relying on the usage of these morphemes. Both morphological and syllable embeddings are concatenated and fed through a highway network (Srivastava et al., 2015) to get a refined representation for the word as shown in the embedding layer for Figure 1."

      "heading" : "2.3 Differentiated Softmax",
      "text" : "The output layer models a probability distribution over words in vocabulary conditioned on the given context. There is a trade-off between required memory and computational cost which determines the level of prediction. To generate a complete word, using morpheme-level predictions requires beam search which is expensive as compared to word-level predictions. Using beam search to predict the word greedily does not adhere to the com-\nputational requirements set forth for mobile devices. Thus, we have to choose word-level outputs although it requires having a vocabulary of over 0.2M words to cover 95% of the functional word forms. Computing a probability distribution function for 0.2M classes is computational intensive and overshoots the required run-time and the allocated memory to store the model parameters.\nTherefore, the softmax weight matrix, Wsoftmax, needs to be compressed as it is contributing to huge model parameters. We initially propose to choose an appropriate rank for the Wsoftmax in the following approximation problem; Wsoftmax = WA ×WB , whereWA and WB have ranks less than r. We extend the idea of low rank matrix factorization in (Sainath et al., 2013) by further clustering words into groups and allowing a different low rank r′ for each cluster. The words with high frequency are given a rank, r1, such that r1 ≥ r2 where r2 is the low rank for the words with low frequency. The core idea being, words with higher frequency have much richer representation in higher dimensional space, whereas words with low frequency cannot utilize the higher dimensional space well.\nWe observe that 87% of the words appear in the tail of the distribution by the frequency of occurrence. We provide a higher rank to the top 2.5% words and much lower rank to the bottom 87%. This different treatment reduces the number of pa-\nrameters and leads to better modeling."

We empirically test our model and its input vocabulary size is around 20K morphemes and 3K syllables. The embedding size for morpheme is 52 and that for syllable is 15. We use one highway layer to combine the embeddings from syllable and morpheme. Our hidden layer consists of 500 LSTM units. The differentiated softmax outputs the model’s distribution over the 0.2M words in the output vocabulary with top 5K (by frequency) getting a representation dimension (low rank in Wsoftmax) of 152, next 20K use a representation dimension of 52 and the rest 175K get a representation dimension of 12. All the compared models have word level outputs and use differentiated softmax."

The word-level embedding has the highest number of parameters but has the worst performance. As expected breaking words into their subforms improves the language model. However, our experiment reaches its peak performance when we use syllable level embeddings. To improve the performance even further we propose using syllable\nand morpheme which outperforms all the other approaches in terms of perplexity."

KSS is a percentage of key strokes not pressed compared to a vanilla keyboard which does not have any prediction or completion capabilities. Every user typed characters using the predictions of the language model counts as key stroke saving. The dataset1 used to evaluate KSS was manually curated to mimic user keyboard usage patterns.\nThe results in Table 3 for other commercialized solutions are manually evaluated due to lack of access to their language model. We use three evaluators from inspection group to cross-validate the results and remove human errors. Each evaluator performed the test independently for all the other solutions to reach a consensus. We try to minimize user personalization in predictions by creating a new user profile while evaluating KSS.\nThe proposed method shows 37.62% in terms of KSS and outperforms compared solutions. We have achieved more than 13% improvement over the best score among existing solutions which is 33.20% in KSS. If the user inputs a word with our solution, we require on an average 62.38% of the word prefix to recommend the intended word, while other solutions need 66.80% of the same. Figure 4 shows an example of word prediction across different solutions. In this example, the predictions from other solutions are same irrespective of the context, while the proposed method treats\n1The dataset consists of 67 sentences (825 words, 7,531 characters) which are collection of formal and informal utterances from various sources.

      "text" : "We have proposed a practical method for modeling agglutinative languages, in this case Korean. We use syllable and morpheme embeddings to tackle large portion of OOV problem owing to practical limit of vocabulary size and word-level prediction with differentiated softmax to compress size of model to a form factor making it amenable to running smoothly on mobile device. Our model has 9.50M parameters and achieves better perplexity than character-level embedding by 16.87. Our proposed method outperforms the existing commercialized keyboards in terms of key stroke savings and has been commercialized. Our commercialized solution combines above model with n-gram statistics to model user behavior thus supporting personalization."

Our model outperforms character-level embedding in perplexity by 16.87 with 9.50M parameters. Proposed method achieves state of the art performance over existing input prediction methods in terms of Key Stroke Saving and has been commercialized.",
