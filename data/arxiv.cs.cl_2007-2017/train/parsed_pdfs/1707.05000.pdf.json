      "text" : "Transition-based constituent parsing employs sequences of local transition actions to construct constituent trees over sentences. There are two popular transition-based constituent parsing systems, namely bottom-up parsing (Sagae and Lavie, 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2009; Zhu et al., 2013; Watanabe\nand Sumita, 2015) and top-down parsing (Dyer et al., 2016; Kuncoro et al., 2017). The parsing strategies differ in terms of the order in which they recognize productions in the derivation tree.\nThe process of bottom-up parsing can be regarded as post-order traversal over a constituent tree. For example, given the sentence in Figure 1, a bottom-up shift-reduce parser takes the action sequence in Table 2(a)1 to build the output, where the word sequence “The little boy” is first read, and then an NP recognized for the word sequence. After the system reads the verb “likes” and an its subsequent NP, a VP is recognized. The full order of recognition for the tree nodes is 3©→ 4©→ 5©→ 2©→ 7©→ 9©→ 10©→ 8©→ 6©→ 11©→ 1©. When making local decisions, rich information is available from readily built partial trees (Zhu et al., 2013; Watanabe and Sumita, 2015; Cross and Huang, 2016), which contributes to local disambiguation. However, there is lack of top-down guidance from lookahead information, which can be useful (Johnson, 1998; Roark and Johnson, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Liu and Zhang, 2017). In addition, binarization must be applied to trees, as shown in Figure 1(b), to ensure a constant number of actions (Sagae and Lavie, 2005), and to take advantage of lexical head information (Collins, 2003). However, such binarization requires a set of language-specific rules, which hampers adaptation of parsing to other languages.\nOn the other hand, the process of top-down parsing can be regarded as pre-order traversal over a tree. Given the sentence in Figure 1, a top-down\n1The action sequence is taken on unbinarized trees.\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n05 00\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n7 Ju\nl 2 01\nshift-reduce parser takes the action sequence in Table 2(b) to build the output, where an S is first made and then an NP is generated. After that, the system makes decision to read the word sequence “The little boy” to complete the NP. The full order of recognition for the tree nodes is 1©→ 2©→ 3©→ 4©→ 5©→ 6©→ 7©→ 8©→ 9©→ 10©→ 11©. The top-down lookahead guidance contributes to non-local disambiguation. However, it is difficult to generate a constituent before its sub constituents have been realized, since no explicit features can be extracted from their subtree structures. Thanks to the use of recurrent neural networks, which makes it possible to represent a sentence globally before syntactic tree construction, seminal work of neural top-down parsing directly generates bracketed constituent trees using sequence-to-sequence models (Vinyals et al., 2015). Dyer et al. (2016) design set of top-down transition actions for standard\ntransition-based parsing. In this paper, we propose a novel transition system for constituent parsing, mitigating issues of both bottom-up and top-down systems by finding a compromise between bottom-up constituent information and top-down lookahead information. The process of the proposed constituent parsing can be regarded as in-order traversal over a tree. Given the sentence in Figure 1, the system takes the action sequence in Table 2(c) to build the output. The system reads the word “The” and then projects an NP, which is based on bottom-up evidence. After this, based on the projected NP, the system reads the word sequence “little boy”, with top-down guidance from NP. Similarly, based on the completed constituent “(NP The little boy)”, the system projects an S, with the bottom-up evidence.\nWith the S and the word “likes”, the system projects an VP, which can serve as top-down guidance. The full order of recognition for the tree nodes is 3©→ 2©→ 4©→ 5©→ 1©→ 7©→ 6©→ 9©→ 8©→ 10©→ 11©. Compared to post-order traversal, in-order traversal can potentially resolve non-local ambiguity better by top-down guidance. Compared to pre-order traversal, in-order traversal can potentially resolve local ambiguity better by bottom-up evidence.\nFurthermore, in-order traversal is psycholinguistically motivated (Roark et al., 2009; Steedman, 2000). Empirically, a human reader comprehends sentences by giving lookahead guesses for constituents. For example, when reading a word “likes”, a human reader could guess that it could be a start of a constituent VP, instead of waiting to read the object “red tomatoes”, which is the procedure of a bottom-up system.\nWe compare our system with the two baseline systems (i.e. a top-down system and a bottomup system) under the same neural transition-based framework of Dyer et al. (2016). Our final models outperform both of the bottom-up and top-down transition-based constituent parsing by achieving a 91.8 F1 in English and a 86.1 F1 in Chinese for greedy fully-supervised parsing, respectively. Furthermore, our final model obtains a 93.6 F1 with supervised reranking (Choe and Charniak, 2016) and a 94.2 F1 with semi-supervised reranking, achieving the state-of-the-art results on constituent parsing on English benchmark. By converting to Stanford dependencies, our final model achieves the state-ofthe-art results on dependency parsing by obtaining a 96.2% UAS and a 95.2% LAS. To our knowledge, we are the first to systematically compare top-down and bottom-up constituent parsing under the same neural framework. We release our code at https://github.com/LeonCrashCode/ InOrderParser."

For example, given the tree “(S a b c d)”, the traversal is “a S b c d” if k = 1 while the traversal is “a b S c d” if k = 2. We name each variant with a certain k value as k-in-order systems. In this paper, we only investigate the in-order system with k = 1, the 1-inorder system. Note that the top-down parser can be regarded as a special case of a generalized version of the in-order parser with k = 0, and the bottom-up parser can be regarded as a special case with k =∞."

This is likely because the bottom-up parser takes advantages of rich local features from partially-built trees, which are useful for parsing short sentences. But these local structures are can be insufficient for parsing long sentences due to error propagation. On the other hand, the top-down parser obtain better results on long sentences with the length falling in the range [40-50]. This is because, as the length of sentences increase, lookahead features become rich and they could be correctly represented by the LSTM, which is beneficial for parsing non-local structures.

In other words, bottom-up information is necessary for us to know if the span can be a noun phrase (NP) or sentence (S) for example. On the other hand, the top-down parser has better performance on WHNP, which can be due to the reason that a WHNP starts with a certain question word, which makes the prediction is easy without bottom-up information.

For example, given the sentence #2006, the bottom-up and the in-order parsers give both correct results. However, the top-down parser makes an incorrect decision to generate an S, which leads subsequent incorrect decisions on VP to complete S. Sentence pattern ambiguaty allows top-down guidance to over-parsing the sentence by recognizing the word “Plans” as a verb, while more bottom-up information is useful for the local disambiguation.\nGiven the sentence #308, the bottom-up parser prefers construction of local constituents such as “once producers and customers”, ignoring the possible clause SBAR, however, which is captured by the in-order parser, because the parser projects a constituent SBAR from the word “stick” and continues to complete the clause, showing that top-down lookahead information is necessary for non-local disambiguation. The in-order parser gives the correct output for the sentence #2066 and the sentence #308, showing that it can benefit from bottom-up\nand top-down information. In the sentence #1715, there are coordinated objects such as “investors uneasy” and “the corporations more vulnerable”. All of the three parsers can recognize coordination. However, the top-down and the bottom-up parsers incorrectly recognize the “This has both made investors uneasy” as a complete sentence. The top-down parser incorrectly generates S, marked in red, at a early stage, leaving no choice but to follow this incorrect non-terminal. The bottom-up parser without lookahead information makes incorrect local decisions. In contrast, the in-order parser reads the word “and” and projects a non-terminal S for coordination after completing “(S investors uneasy)”. On the other hand, the in-order parser is confused to project for the word “made” or the word “both” into a VP, which we think could be addressed by using a in-order system variant with k=2 described in section 3."

The parsing strategies differ in terms of the order in which they recognize productions in the derivation tree, where bottom-up strategies and top-down strategies take post-order and pre-order traversal over trees, respectively. Bottom-up parsers benefit from rich features from readily built partial parses, but lack lookahead guidance in the parsing process; top-down parsers benefit from non-local guidance for local decisions, but rely on a strong encoder over the input to predict a constituent hierarchy before its construction. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel parsing system based on in-order traversal over syntactic trees, designing a set of transition actions to find a compromise between bottom-up constituent information and top-down lookahead information. Based on stack-LSTM, our psycholinguistically motivated constituent parsing system achieves 91.8 F1 on WSJ benchmark. Furthermore, the system achieves 93.6 F1 with supervised reranking and 94.2 F1 with semi-supervised reranking, which are the best results on the WSJ benchmark.",
