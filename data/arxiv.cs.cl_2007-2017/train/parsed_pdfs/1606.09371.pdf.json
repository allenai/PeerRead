Such methods are further limited by the scope of these features or in other words, their ability to cover the contexts or word dependencies within a sentence. In this work, we focus on reducing such dependencies and propose a domain-invariant framework for the disease name recognition task. In particular, we propose various end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) models for the tasks of disease name recognition and their classification into four pre-defined categories. We also utilize convolution neural network (CNN) in cascade of RNN to get character-based embedded features and employ it with word-embedded features in our model. We compare our models with the state-of-the-art results for the two tasks on NCBI disease dataset. Our results for the disease mention recognition task indicate that state-of-the-art performance can be obtained without relying on feature engineering. Further the proposed models obtained improved performance on the classification task of disease names."

      "text" : "Automatic recognition of disease names in biomedical and clinical texts is of utmost importance for development of more sophisticated NLP systems such as information extraction, question answering, text summarization and so on (Rosario and Hearst, 2004). Complicate and inconsistent terminologies, ambiguities caused by use of ab-\nbreviations and acronyms, new disease names, multiple names (possibly of varying number of words) for the same disease, complicated syntactic structure referring to multiple related names or entities are some of the major reasons for making automatic identification of the task difficult and challenging (Leaman et al., 2009). State-ofthe-art disease name recognition systems (Mahbub Chowdhury and Lavelli, 2010; Doğan and Lu, 2012; Dogan et al., 2014) depends on user defined features which in turn try to capture context keeping in mind above mentioned challenges. Feature engineering not only requires linguistic as well as domain insight but also is time consuming and is corpus dependent.\nRecently window based neural network approach of (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Collobert et al., 2011) got lot of attention in different sequence tagging tasks in NLP. It gave state-of-art results in many sequence labeling problems without using many hand designed or manually engineered features. One major drawback of this approach is its inability to capture features from outside window. Consider a sentence “Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations” (taken verbatim from PMID: 10192393), words such as signs and originate appearing both sides of the word “pilomatricomas”, play important role in deciding it is a disease. Any model relying on features defined based on words occurring within a fixed window of neighboring words will fail to capture information of influential words occurring outside this window.\nOur motivation can be summarized in the following question: can we identify disease name and categorize them without relying on feature en-\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n09 37\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\n0 Ju\nn 20\n16\ngineering, domain-knowledge or task specific resources? In other words, we can say this work is motivated towards mitigating the two issues: first, feature engineering relying on linguistic and domain-specific knowledge; and second, bring flexibility in capturing influential words affecting model decisions irrespective of their occurrence anywhere within the sentence. For the first, we used character-based embedding (likely to capture orthographic and morphological features) as well as word embedding (likely to capture lexicosemantic features) as features of the neural network models.\nFor the second issue, we explore various recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures for their ability to capture long distance contexts. We experiment with bidirectional RNN (Bi-RNN), bidirectional long short term memory network (BiLSTM) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). In each of these models we used sentence level log likelihood approach at the top layer of the neural architecture. The main contributions of the work can be summarized as follows\n• Domain invariant features with various RNN architectures for the disease name recognition and classification tasks,\n• Comparative study on the use of character based embedded features, word embedding features and combined features in the RNN models.\n• Failure analysis to check where exactly our models are failed in the considered tasks.\nAlthough there are some related works (discussed in sec 6), this is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, which comprehensively uses various RNN architectures without resorting to feature engineering for disease name recognition and classification tasks.\nOur results show near state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the disease name recognition task. More significantly, the proposed models obtain significantly improved performance on the disease name classification task."

Each word has to be labeled with one of the defined tags. We choose BIO model of tagging, where B stands for beginning, I for intermediate and O for outsider or other. This way we have two possible tags for all entities of interest, i.e., for all disease mentions, and one tag for other entities.\nGeneric neural architecture is shown in the figure 1. In the very first step, each word is mapped to its embedded features.\nWe call this layer as embedding layer. This layer acts as input to hidden layers of RNN model. We study the three different RNN models, and have described them briefly in the section 2.3. Output of the hidden layers is then fed to the output layer to compute the scores for all tags of interest (Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2015). In output layer we are using sentence level log likelihood, to make inference. Table 1 briefly describes all notations used in the paper."

We can get this vector by taking product of matrix Mwe and one hot vector of vi.\nw(i) =Mwe h(i) (1)\nHere h(i) is the one hot vector representation of ith word in V.

However, for the disease entity recognition task, such information can play an important role. For instance, letter -o- in the word gastroenteritis is used to combine various body parts gastro for stomach, enter for intestines, and itis indicates inflammation. Hence taken together it implies inflammation of stomach and intestines, where -itis play significant role in determining it is actually a disease name.\nCharacter level word embedding was first introduced by (dos Santos and Zadrozny, 2014) with the motivation to capture word shape and morphological features in word embedding. Character level word embedding also automatically mitigate the problem of out of vocabulary words as we can embed any word by its characters through character level embedding. In this case, a vector is initialized for every character in the corpus. Then we learn vector representation for any word by applying CNN on each vector of character sequence of that word as shown in figure 2. These character vectors will get update while training RNN in supervised manner only. Since number of characters in the dataset is not high we assume that every character vectors will get sufficient updation while training RNN itself.\nLet {p1, c1, c2...cM , p2} is sequence of characters for a word with padding at beginning and ending of word and let {al, a1, a2...aM , ar} is its sequence of character vector, which we obtain by multiplying M cw with one hot vector of corresponding character. To obtain character level word embedding we need to feed this in convolution neural network (CNN) with max pooling layer (dos Santos and Zadrozny, 2014). Let W c ∈\nRdceX(dchrXk) is a filter and bc bias of CNN, then\n[y(i)]j = max 1<m<M [W cq(m) + bc]j (2)\nHere k is window size, q(m) is obtained by concatenating the vector of (k− 1)/2 character left to (k−1)/2 character right of cm. Same filter will be used for all window of characters and max pooling operation is performed on results of all. We learn 100 dimensional character embedding for all characters in a given dataset (avoiding case sensitivity) and 25 dimensional character level word embedding from character sequence of words."

Such models are likely to fail where we need longer contexts to do the job. These issues were the main motivation behind the LSTM model (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). LSTM layer is just another way to compute a hidden state which introduces a new structure called a memory cell (ct) and three gates called as input (it), output (ot) and forget (ft) gates.\nThese gates are composed of sigmoid activation function and responsible for regulating information in memory cell. The input gate by allowing incoming signal to alter the state of the memory cell, regulates proportion of history information memory cell will keep. On the other hand, the output gate regulates what proportion of stored information in the memory cell will influence other neurons. Finally, the forget gate can modulate the memory cells and allowing the cell to remember or forget its previous state. Computation of memory cell (c(t)) is done through previous memory cell and candidate hidden state (g(t)) which we compute through current input and the previous hidden state. The final output of hidden state would be calculated based on memory cell and forget gate.\nIn our experiment we used model discussed in (Graves, 2013; Huang et al., 2015).

A word is annotated as specific disease, if it indicates a particular disease. Disease class category indicates a word describing a family of many specific diseases, such as autoimmune disorder. A string signifying two or more different disease mentions is annotated with composite mention. Modifier category indicates disease mention has been used as modifiers for other concepts. This dataset is a extension of the AZDC dataset (Leaman et al., 2009) which was annotated with disease mentions only and not with their categories.

      "text" : "Evaluation of different models using CE\nWe first evaluate the performance of different RNNs using only character embedding features. We compare the results of RNN models with window based neural network (Collobert et al., 2011) using sentence level log likelihood approach (NN + CE). For the window based neural network, we considered window size 5 (two words from both left and right, and one central word) and same settings of character embedding were used as features. The same set of parameters are used in all experiments unless we mention specifically otherwise. We used exact matching scheme to evaluate performance of all models.\nTable 3 shows the results obtained by different RNN models with only character level word embedding features. For the task A (Disease name recognition) Bi-LSTM and NN models gave competitive performance on the test set, while Bi-RNN and Bi-GRU did not perform so well. On the other hand for the task B, there is 2.08% − 3.8% improved performance (F1-score) shown by RNN models over the NN model again on the test set. Bi-LSTM model obtained F1-score of 59.78% while NN model gave 57.56%. As discussed earlier, task B is difficult than task A as disease category is more likely to be influenced by the words falling outside the context window considered in\nwindow based methods. This could be reason for RNN models to perform well over the NN model. This hypothesis will be stronger if we observe similar pattern in our other experiments.\nEvaluation of different models with WE and WE+CE\nNext we investigated the results obtained by the various models using only 50 dim word embedding features. The first part of table 4 shows the results obtained by different RNNs and the window based neural network (NN). In this case RNN models are giving better results than the NN model for both the tasks. In particular performance of Bi-LSTM models are best than others in both the tasks. We observe that for the task A, RNN models obtained 1.2% to 3% improvement in F1-score than the baseline NN performance. Similarly 2.55% to 4% improvement in F1-score are observed for the task B, with Bi-LSTM model obtaining more than 4% improvement.\nIn second part of this table we compare the results obtained by various models using the features set obtained by combining the two feature sets. If we look at performance of individual model using three different set of features, model using only word embedding features seems to give consistently best performance. Among all models, BiLSTM using word embedding features obtained best F1-scores of 79.13% and 63.16% for the tasks A and B respectively.\nImportance of tuning pre-trained word vectors\nWe further empirically evaluate the importance of updating of word vectors while training. For this, we performed another set of experiments, where pre-trained word vectors are not updated while\ntraining. Results obtained on the validation dataset of the Task A are shown in the Table 5. One can observe that performance of all models have deteriorated. Next, instead of using pre-trained word vectors, we initialized each word with zero vector but kept updating them while training. Although performance (Table 6) deteriorated (compare to Table 4) but not as much as in table 5. This observation highlights the importance of tuning word vectors for a specific task during training."

Li (2012) used linear soft margin support vector (SVM) machine with a number of hand designed features including dictionary based features.

Examples of few such cases are “CD”, “HNPCC”,“SCA1”. We observe that this error is occurring because we do not have exact word embedding for these words. Most of the acronyms in the disease corpus were mapped to rare-word embedding1. Another major proportion of errors in our results were due to difficulty in recognizing nested forms of disease names. For example, in all of the following cases: “hereditary forms of ’ovarian cancer’” , “inherited ‘breast cancer’”, “male and female ‘breast cancer’”, part of phrase such as ovarian cancer in hereditary forms of ovarian cancer, breast cancer in inherited breast cancer and male and female breast cancer are disease names and our models are detecting this very well. However, according to annotation scheme if any disease is part of nested disease name, annotators considered whole phrase as a single disease. So even our model is able to detect part of the disease accurately but due to the exact matching scheme, this will be false positive for us."

In this work, they exploit the power of CNN to get morphological and shape features of words in character level word embedding, and used it as feature with concatenation of word embedding. Their results indicate that CNN are able to preserve morphological and shape features through character level word embedding. Our models are quite similar to this model but we used different variety of RNN in place of window based neural network.\nLabeau et al. (2015) used Bi-RNN with character level word embedding only as a feature for PoS tagging in German text. Their results also show that with only character level word embedding we can get state-of-art results in PoS tagging in German text. Our model used word embedding as well as character level word embedding together as features and also we have tried more sophisticated RNN models such as LSTM and GRU in bi-directional structure. More recent work of Huang et al. (2015) used LSTM and CRF in variety of combination such as only LSTM, LSTM with CRF and Bi-LSTM with CRF for PoS tagging, chunking and NER tasks in general texts. Their results shows that Bi-LSTM with CRF gave best results in all these tasks.

All our results were obtained without putting any effort on feature engineering or requiring domain-specific knowledge.

Such methods are further limited by the scope of these features or in other words, their ability to cover the contexts or word dependencies within a sentence. In this work, we focus on reducing such dependencies and propose a domain-invariant framework for the disease name recognition task. In particular, we propose various end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) models for the tasks of disease name recognition and their classification into four pre-defined categories. We also utilize convolution neural network (CNN) in cascade of RNN to get character-based embedded features and employ it with word-embedded features in our model. We compare our models with the state-of-the-art results for the two tasks on NCBI disease dataset. Our results for the disease mention recognition task indicate that state-of-the-art performance can be obtained without relying on feature engineering. Further the proposed models obtained improved performance on the classification task of disease names.",
