In general, side information refers to knowledge beyond instances themselves that can help inferring the underlying instance-to-cluster assignments. One common and useful type of side information has been represented in the form of instance-level constraints that expose instance-level relationships.\nPrevious work has primarily focused on the use of pairwise constraints (e.g., [1]–[11]), where a pair of instances is indicated to belong to the same cluster by a Must-Link (ML) constraint or to different clusters by a Cannot-Link (CL) constraint. More recently, various studies [12]–[17] have suggested that domain knowledge can also be incorporated in the form of relative comparisons or relative constraints, where each constraint specifies whether instance xi is more similar to xj than to xk .\nWe were motivated to focus on relative constraints for a couple of reasons. First, the labeling (proper identification) of relative constraints by humans appears to be more reliable than that of pairwise constraints. Research in psychology has revealed that people are often inaccurate in making absolute judgments (required for pairwise constraints), but they are more trustworthy when judging comparatively [18]. Consider\none of our applications, where we would like to form clusters of bird song syllables based on spectrogram segments from recorded sounds. Figure 1(a) and 1(b) shows examples of the two types of constraints/questions considered. In the examples, syllable 1 in both figures and syllable 3 in 1(b) are from the same singing pattern and syllable 2 in both figures belongs to a different one. From the figures, it is apparent that making an absolute judgment for the pairwise constraint in 1(a) is more difficult. In contrast, the comparative question for labeling relative constraint in 1(b) is much easier to answer. Second, since each relative constraint includes information about three instances, they tend to be more informative than pairwise constraints (even when several pairwise constraints are considered). This is formally characterized in Section II-A.\nIn the area of learning from relative constraints, most work uses metric learning approaches [12]–[16]. Such approaches assume that there is an underlying metric that determines the outcome of the similarity comparisons, and the goal is to learn such a metric. The learned metric is often later used for clustering (e.g., via Kmeans or related approaches). In practice, however, we may not have access to an oracle metric. Often the constraints are provided in a way that instances from the same class are considered more similar than those from different classes. This paper explicitly considers such scenarios where constraints are provided based on the underlying class concept. Unlike the metric-based approaches, we aim to directly infer an optimal clustering of the data using the provided relative comparisons, without requiring explicit metric learning.\nFormally, we regard each constraint (xi, xj , xk) as being obtained by asking: is xi more similar to xj than to xk , and the answer is provided by a user/oracle based on the underlying instance clusters. In particular, a yes answer is given if xi and xj are believed to belong to the same cluster while xk is believed to be from a different one. Similarly, the answer will be no if it is believed that xi and xk are in the same cluster which is different from the one containing xj . Note that for some triplets, it may not be possible to provide a yes or no answer. For example, if the three instances belong to the same cluster, as shown in figure 1(c); or if each of them belongs to a different cluster, as shown in figure 1(d). Such cases have been largely ignored by prior studies. Here, we allow the user to provide a don’t know answer (dnk) when yes/no can not be determined. Such dnk’s not only allow for improved labeling flexibility, but also provide useful information about instance clusters that can help improve clustering, as will be demonstrated in Section II-A and the experiments.\nIn this work, we introduce a discriminative clustering method, DCRC, that learns from relative constraints with yes,\nno, or dnk labels (Section III). DCRC uses a probabilistic model that naturally connects the instances, their underlying cluster memberships, and the observed constraints. Based on this model, we present a maximum-likelihood objective with additional terms enforcing cluster separation and cluster balance. Variational EM is used to find approximate solutions (Section IV). In the experiments (Section V), we first evaluate our method on both UCI and additional real-world datasets with simulated noise-free constraints generated from groundtruth class labels. The results demonstrate the usefulness of relative constraints including don’t know answers, and the performance advantage of our method over current state-ofthe-art methods for both relative and pairwise constraints. We also evaluate our method with human-labeled noisy constraints collected from a user study, and results show the superiority of our method over existing methods in terms of robustness to the noisy constraints."

      "text" : "In this section, we first compare the cluster label information obtained by querying different types of constraints, analyzing the usefulness of relative constraints. Then we formally state the problem.\nA. Information from Constraints\nHere we provide a qualitative analysis with a simplified but illustrative example. Suppose we have N i.i.d instances {xi} N i=1 sampled from K clusters with even prior 1/K . Consider a triplet (xt1 , xt2 , xt3) and a pair (xb1 , xb2). Let Yt = [yt1 , yt2 , yt3 ] T and Yb = [yb1 , yb2 ] T be their corresponding cluster labels. Let lt ∈ {yes, no, dnk} and l′b ∈ {ML,CL} be the label for the relative and pairwise constraint respectively. In this example they are determined by\nlt =\n\n\n yes, if yt1 = yt2 , yt1 6= yt3 no, if yt1 = yt3 , yt1 6= yt2 dnk, o.w.\n(1)\nl′b =\n{\nML, if yb1 = yb2 CL, if yb1 6= yb2 .\n(2)\nWe can derive the mutual information between a relative constraint and the associated instance cluster labels as (see Appendix for the derivation)\nI(Yt; lt) = 2 logK − (1− Pdnk) log(K − 1)\n−Pdnk log[K 2 − 2(K − 1)],\n(3)\nand that for a pairwise constraint as\nI(Yb; l ′ b) = logK − PCL log(K − 1), (4)\nwhere Pdnk = 1− 2(K − 1)/K2, and PCL = 1− 1/K . Figure 2 plots the values of (3) and (4) as a function of the number of clusters K . Comparing the values of one relative const and one pairwise const, we see that, in the absence of other information, a relative constraint provides more information. One might argue that labeling a triplet requires inspecting more instances than labeling a pair, making this comparison unfair. To address this bias, we compare the information gain from the two types of constraints with the same number of instances, namely, comparing the values of two relative constraints with that of three pairwise constraints, both involving six instances. In Figure 2 we see again that relative constraints are more informative.\nAnother aspect worth evaluating is the motivation behind explicitly using dnk constraints. In prior work on learning from relative constraints, the constraints are typically generated by randomly selecting triplets and producing constraints based their class labels. If a triplet can not be definitely labeled with yes or no, the resulting constraint is not employed by the learning algorithm (it is ignored). Such methods are by construction not using the information provided by dnk answers. However, it is possible to show that in general dnk’s can provide information about instance labels. If dnk’s are ignored, the mutual information can be computed by replacing H(Yt|lt = dnk) with H(Yt), meaning that the dnk’s are not informative about the instance labels. In this case, we have\nI ′(Yt; lt) = 2(1− Pdnk) logK − (1 − Pdnk) log(K − 1). (5)\nComparing the values of one relative YN const (which ignores\n3\ndnk) with that of one relative const in Figure 2, we see a clear gap between using and not using dnk constraints, implying the informativeness of dnk constraints. Additionally, the amount of dnk constraints is usually large, especially when the number of clusters is large. Consider randomly selecting triplets from clusters with equal sizes. There is a 50% chance of acquiring dnk constraints in two-cluster problems, and the chance increases to 78% in eight-cluster problems. The information provided by such large amount of dnk constraints is substantial. Hence, we believe it will be beneficial to explicitly employ and model dnk constraints."

Let Y = [y1, . . . , yN ]T be the hidden cluster label vector, where yi is the label of xi. With slight abuse of notation, we use {(t1, t2, t3)}Mt=1 to denote the index set of M triplets, representing M relative constraints. Each (t1, t2, t3) contains the indices for the three instances in the t-th constraint. Let L = [l1, . . . , lM ]T be the constraint label vector, where lt ∈ {yes, no, dnk} is the label of (xt1 , xt2 , xt3). Each lt specifies the answer to the question: is xt1 more similar to xt2 than to xt3? Our goal is to partition the data into K clusters such that similar instances are assigned to the same cluster, while respecting the given constraints. In this paper, we assume that K is pre-specified.\nIn the following, we will use It = {t1, t2, t3} to denote the set of indices in the t-th triplet, use I to index all the distinct instances involved in the constraints, i.e., I = {\n1 ≤ i ≤ N : i ∈ ∪Mt=1It }\n, and use U to index the instances that are not in any constraints."

      "text" : "We propose a Discriminative Clustering model for Relative Constraints (DCRC). Figure 3 shows the proposed probabilistic model defining the dependencies between the input instances (xt1 , xt2 , xt3), their cluster labels (yt1 , yt2 , yt3), and the constraint label lt for only one relative constraint. For\na collection of constraints, it is possible to have y variables connected to more than one (or none) constraint label l if some instances appear in multiple constraints (or do not appear in any given constraint).\nWe use a multi-class logistic classifier to model the conditional probability of y’s given the observed x’s. For simplicity, in the following we will use the same notation x to represent the (d + 1)-dimensional augmented vector [xT , 1]T . Let W = [w1, . . . , wK ]\nT be a weight matrix in RK×(d+1), where each wk contains weights on the d-dimensional feature space and an additional bias term. Then the conditional probability is represented as\nP (y = k|x;W ) = exp (wTk x) ∑\nk′ exp (w T k′x)\n. (6)\nIn our model, the observed constraint labels only depend on the cluster labels of the associated instances. In an ideal scenario, the conditional distribution of lt given the cluster labels would be deterministic, as described by Eq. (1). However, in practice users can make mistakes and be inconsistent during the annotation process. We address this by relaxing the deterministic relationship to the distribution P (lt|Yt) described in Table I. The relaxation is parameterized by ǫ ∈ [0, 1), indicating the probability of an error when answering the query. Here we let the two erroneous answers have equal probability ǫ/2. Namely, the ideal label of lt (e.g., lt = yes if yt1 = yt2 , yt1 6= yt3) is given with probability 1 − ǫ, and any other labels (no and dnk in this case) are given with equal probability ǫ/2. In practice, lower values of ǫ are expected when constraints have fewer noise. Alternatively, we can view this relaxation as allowing the constraints to be soft as needed, balancing the trade-off between finding large separation margins among clusters and satisfying all the constraints."

      "heading" : "B. Objective",
      "text" : "The first part of our objective is to maximize the likelihood of the observed constraints given the instances, i.e.,\nmax W\nΦ(L|XI ;W ) = 1 M logP (L|XI ;W )\n= 1M log ∑\nYI\nP (L, YI |XI ;W ) , (7)\nwhere I indexes the constrained instances as defined in Section II-B, and 1M is a normalization constant.\nTo reduce overfitting, we add the standard L-2 regularization for the logistic model, namely,\nR(W ) = ∑\nk\nw̃Tk w̃k ,\n4\nwhere each w̃k is a vector obtained by replacing the bias term in wk with 0.\nIn addition to satisfying the constraints, we also expect the clustering solution to separate the clusters with large margins. This objective can be captured by minimizing the conditional entropy of instance cluster labels given the observed features [19]. Since the cluster information about constrained instances is captured by Eq. (7), we only impose such entropy minimization on the unconstrained instances, i.e.,\nH(YU |XU ;W ) = 1\n|U |\n∑\ni∈U\nH [P (yi|xi;W )] .\nAdding the above terms together, our objective is\nmax W Φ(L|XI ;W )− τH(YU |XU ;W )− λR(W ) . (8)\nIn some cases, we may also wish to maintain a balanced distribution across different clusters. This can be achieved by maximizing the entropy of the estimated marginal distribution of cluster labels [20], i.e.,\nH(ŷ|X ;W ) = − ∑K\nk=1 p̂k log p̂k ,\nwhere we denote the estimated marginal probability as p̂k = P̂ (y = k|X ;W ) = 1N ∑N i=1 pik and pik = P (yi = k|xi;W ).\nIn cases where balanced clusters are desired, our objective is formulated as\nmax W Φ(L|XI ;W )− λR(W )\n+ τ [H(ŷ|X ;W )−H(YU |XU ;W )] , (9)\nwhere we use the same coefficient τ to control the enforcement of the cluster separation and cluster balance terms, since they are roughly at the same scale.\nThe two objectives (8) and (9) are non-concave, and optimization generally can only be guaranteed to reach a local optimum. In the next section, we present a variational EM solution and discuss an effective initialization strategy."

      "heading" : "IV. OPTIMIZATION",
      "text" : "Here we consider optimizing the objective in Eq. (9), which enforces cluster balance. The objective (8) is simpler and can be optimized following the same procedure by simply removing the corresponding terms employed for cluster balance.\nComputing the log-likelihood Eq. (7) requires marginalizing over hidden variables YI . Exact inference may be feasible when the constraints are highly separated or the number of constraints is small, as this may produce a graphical model with low tree-width. As more y’s are related to each other via constraints, marginalization becomes more expensive to compute, and it is in general intractable. For this reason, we use the variational EM algorithm for optimization.\nApplying Jensen’s inequality, we obtain the lower bound of the objective as follows\nLB = 1MEQ(YI )\n[ log(P (YI ,L|XI ;W )Q(YI ) ) ] − λR(W )\n+ τ [H(ŷ|X ;W )−H(YU |XU ;W )] , (10)\nwhere Q(YI) is a variational distribution. In variational EM, such lower bound is maximized alternately in the E-step and M-step respectively [21]. In each E-step, we aim to find a tractable distribution Q(YI) such that the KullbackLeibler divergence between Q(YI) and the posterior distribution P (YI |L,XI ;W ) is minimized. Given the current Q(YI), each M-step finds the new W that maximizes the LB. Note that in the objective (and the LB), only the likelihood term is relevant to the E-step. The other terms are only used in solving for W in the M-steps.\nA. Variational E-Step\nWe use mean field inference [22], [23] to approximate the posterior distribution in part due to its ease of implementation and convergence properties [24]. Mean field restricts the variational distribution Q(YI) to the tractable fully-factorized family Q(YI) = ∏\ni∈I q(yi), and finds the Q(YI) that minimizes the KL-divergence KL[Q(YI)||P (YI |L,XI ;W )]. The optimal Q(YI) is obtained by iteratively updating each q(yi) until Q(YI) converges. The update equation is\nq(yi) = 1\nZ exp{EQ(YI\\i)[logP (XI , YI , L)]} , (11)\nwhere Q(YI\\i) = ∏\nj∈I,j 6=i q(yj), and Z is a normalization factor to ensure ∑\nyi q(yi) = 1. In the following, we derive a\nclosed-form update for this optimization problem. Applying the model independence assumptions, the expectation term in Eq. (11) is simplified to\nEQ(YI\\i)[ M ∑\nt=1 logP (lt|Yt) +\n∑\nj∈I\nlogP (yj |xj ;W ) + logP (XI)]\n= ∑\nt:i∈It\nEQ(YIt\\i)[logP (lt|Yt)] + logP (yi|xi;W ) + const,\n(12) where It\\i is the set of indices in It except for i, and const absorbs all the terms that are constant with respect to yi. The first term in (12) sums over the expected log-likelihood of observing each lt given the fixed yi. To compute the expectation, we first let Q̃(lt|yi) be the probability that the observed lt is consistent with the Yt given a fixed yi. That is, Q̃(lt|yi) is the probability for all possible assignments of Yt given a fixed yi, such that P (lt|Yt) = 1− ǫ according to Table I. The Q̃(lt|yi) can be computed straightforwardly as in Table II. Then each of the expectations in (12) is computed as\nE[logP (lt|yi)] = [1− Q̃(lt|yi)] log ǫ\n2 + Q̃(lt|yi) log(1− ǫ).\n5 From the above, the update Eq. (11) is derived as\nq(yi) = αF (yi)P (yi|xi;W ) ∑\nyi αF (yi)P (yi|xi;W )\n, with α = 2(1− ǫ)\nǫ ,\n(13) where F (yi) = ∑\nt:i∈It Q̃(lt|yi).\nThe term F (yi) can be interpreted as measuring the compatibility of each assignment of yi with respect to the constraints and the other y’s. In Eq. (13), α is controlled by the parameter ǫ. When ǫ ∈ (0, 23 ), α > 1 and the update allows more compatible assignments of yi, i.e., the ones with higher F (yi), to have larger q(yi). When ǫ = 23 , the constraint labels are regarded as uniformly distributed regardless of the instance cluster labels, as can be seen from Table I. In this case, α = 1 and each q(yi) is directly set to the conditional probability P (yi|xi;W ). This naturally reduces our method to learning without constraints. Clearly, when ǫ is smaller, the constraints are harder and the updates will push q(yi) to more extreme distributions. Note that the values of ǫ ∈ (23 , 1) cause α < 1, which will lead to results that contradict the constraints, and are generally not desired.\nSpecial Case: Hard Constraints. In the special case where ǫ = 0 and α = ∞, P (lt|Yt) essentially reduces to the deterministic model described in Eq. (1), allowing our model to incorporate hard constraints. The update equation of this case can also be addressed similarly to Eq. (13). In this case, q(yi) is non-zero only when the value of F (yi) is the maximum among all possible assignments of yi. Thus, the update equation is reduced to a max model. More formally, we define the maxcompatible label set for each instance xi as\nYi = {1 ≤ k ≤ K : F (yi = k) ≥ F (yi = k ′), ∀ k′ 6= k}.\nNamely, each Yi contains the most compatible assignments for yi with respect to the constraints. Then the update equation becomes\nq(yi) =\n\n\n\nP (yi|xi;W ) ∑\ny′ i ∈Yi\nP (y′i|xi;W ) , if yi ∈ Yi ,\n0, o.w. (14)"

In practice, we can run mean-field update up to a fixed number of iterations (e.g., 100). We empirically observe that the approximation still converges very fast in later EM iterations. Similarly, we observe in the M-step that the LBFGS optimization usually converges with very few iterations in the later EM runs, and a completion of a fixed number of iterations for L-BFGS is also sufficient in the first few M-steps.\nThe EM algorithm is generally sensitive to the initial parameter values.

Table III summarizes the dataset information. In our experiments, all features are standardized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation.\n2) Experimental Setup: For each dataset, we vary the number of constraints from 0.05N to 0.3N with a 0.05N increment, where N is the total number of instances. For each size, triplets are randomly generated and constraint labels are assigned according to Eq. (1). We evaluated our method in two settings, one with all constraints as input (shown as DCRC), and the other with only yes/no constraints (shown as DCRCYN). The baseline methods for relative constraints are designed for yes/no constraints only and cannot be easily extended to incorporate dnk constraints, so we drop the dnk constraints for these methods. To form the corresponding pairwise constraints, we infer one ML and one CL constraints from each relative constraint with yes/no labels (note that no pairwise constraints could be directly inferred from dnk relative constraints). Thus, all the baselines use the same information as DCRC-YN, since no dnk constraints are employed by them.\nWe use five-fold cross-validation to tune parameters for all methods. The same training and validation folds are used across all the methods (removing dnk constraints, or converting to pairwise constraints when necessary).

For our method, we search for the optimal τ ∈ {0.5, 1, 1.5} and λ ∈ {2−10, 2−8, 2−6, 2−4, 2−2}. We empirically observed that our method is very robust to the choice of ǫ when it is within the range [0.05, 0.15]. Here we set ǫ = 0.05 for this set experiments with the simulated noise-free constraints. Experiments are repeated using 20 randomized runs, each with independently sampled constraints.\n3) Overall Performance: Figure 4 shows the performance of all methods with different number of constraints. The sparseLP does not scale to the high-dimensional Stonefly9 dataset and hence is not reported on this particular data.\nFrom the results we see that DCRC consistently outperforms all baselines on all datasets as the constraints increase, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.\nComparing DCRC with DCRC-YN, we observe that the additional dnk constraints provide substantial benefits, especially for datasets with large number of clusters (e.g., MSRCv2, Birdsong). This is consistent with our expectation because the portion of dnk constraints increases significantly when K is large, leading to more information to be utilized by DCRC.\nComparing DCRC-YN with the baselines, we observe that DCRC-YN achieves comparable or better performance even compared with the best baseline ITML. This suggests that, with noise-free constraints, our model is competitive with the stateof-the-art methods even without considering the additional information provided by dnk constraints.\n4) Soft Constraints vs. Hard Constraints: In this set of experiments, we explore the impact on our model when soft constraints (ǫ = 0.05) and hard constraints (ǫ = 0) are used respectively.

Performance of DCRC using soft constraints vs. hard constraints.\n(and thus easily separable) in the other. For each dataset, we randomly generated 500 relative constraints using points near the decision boundaries. Figure 5 shows the prediction entropy and prediction accuracy on instances cluster labels for both datasets achieved by our model, using soft and hard constraints respectively. We can see that when clusters are easily separable, both soft and hard constraints produce reasonable decision boundaries and perfect prediction accuracy. However, when cluster boundaries are fuzzy, the results of using soft constraints appear preferable. This indicates that by softening the constraints, our method could search for more reasonable decision to avoid overfitting to the constrained instances.\nWe then compare the performances of using soft (ǫ = 0.05) versus hard (ǫ = 0) constraints on real datasets with the same setting utilized in Section V-B3. Due to space limit, here we only show results on four representative datasets in Figure 6. The behavior of other datasets are similar. We can see that using soft constraints generally leads to better performance than using hard constraints. In particular, on the MSRCv2 dataset, using hard constraints produces a large “dip” at the beginning of the curve while this issue is not severe for soft constraints. This suggests that using soft constraints makes our model less susceptible to overfitting to small sets of constraints.\n5) Effect of Cluster Balance Enforcement: This set of experiments test the effect of the cluster balance enforcement on the performance of DCRC for the unbalanced Birdsong and the balanced Letters-IJLT datasets. Figure 7 reports the performance of DCRC (soft constraints, ǫ = 0.05) with and without such enforcement with varied number of constraints. We see that when there is no constraint, it is generally beneficial to enforce the cluster balance. The reason is, when cluster balance is not enforced, the entropy that enforces cluster separation can be trivially reduced by removing cluster boundaries, causing degenerate solutions. However, as the constraint increases, enforcing cluster balance on the unbalanced Birdsong hurts\nthe performance. Conceivably, such enforcement would cause DCRC to prefer solutions with balanced cluster distributions, which is undesirable for datasets with uneven classes. On the other hand, appropriate enforcement on the balanced LettersIJLT dataset provides further improvement. In practice, one could determine whether to enforce cluster balance based on prior knowledge of the application domain.\n6) Computational Time: We record the runtime of learning with 1500 constraints on the Birdsong dataset, on a standard desktop computer with 3.4 GHz CPU and 11.6 GB of memory. On average it takes less than 2 minutes to train the model using an un-optimized Matlab implementation. This is reasonable for most applications with similar scale."

      "text" : "We now present a case study where we investigate the impact of human-labeled constraints on the proposed method and its competitors.\n1) Dataset and Setup: This case study is situated in one of our applications where the goal is to find bird singing patterns by clustering. The birdsong dataset used in Section V-B contains spectrogram segments labeled with bird species. In reality, birds of the same species may vocalize in different patterns, which we hope to identify as different clusters. Toward this goal, we created another birdsong dataset consisting of clusters that contains relatively pure singing patterns. We briefly describe the data generation process as follows.\nWe first manually selected a collection of representative examples of the singing patterns, and then use them as templates to extract segments from birdsong spectrograms by applying template matching. Each of the extracted segments is assigned to the cluster represented by the corresponding template. We then manually inspected and edited the clusters to ensure the quality of the clusters. As a result, each cluster contains relatively pure segments that are actually from the same bird species and represent the same vocalization pattern. See Figure 1 for examples of several different vocalization patterns, which we refer to as syllables. We extract features for each segment using the same method as described in [27]. This process results in a new Birdsong dataset containing 2601 instances and 14 ground-truth clusters.\nAfter obtaining informed consents according to the protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution, we tested six human subjects’ behaviors on labeling constraints. None of the users has any prior experience/knowledge\n9\non the data. They were first given a short tutorial on the data and the concepts of clustering and constraints. Then each user is asked to label randomly selected 150 triplets, and 225 pairs, using a graphical interface that displays the spectrogram segments. To neutralize the potential bias introduced by the task ordering (triplets vs. pairs), we randomly split the users into two groups with each group using a different ordering.\n2) Results and Discussion: Table IV lists the average confusion matrix of the human-labeled constraints versus the labels produced based on the ground-truth cluster labels. From Table IV(a), we see that the dnk constraints make up more than half of the relative constraints, which is consistent with our analysis in Section II-A that the number of dnk constraints can be dominantly large. The users rarely confuse between the yes and no labels but they do tend to provide more erroneous dnk labels. This phenomenon is not surprising because when in doubt, we are often more comfortable to abstain from giving an definite yes/no answer and resort to the dnk option.\nFor pairwise constraints, the CL constraints are the majority, and the confusions for both CL and ML are similar. We note that the confusion between the yes/no constraints is much smaller than that of ML/CL constraints. This shows that the increased flexibility introduced by dnk label allows the users to more accurately differentiate yes/no labels. The overall labeling accuracy of pairwise constraints is slightly higher than that of relative constraints. We suspect that this is due to the presence of the large amount of dnk constraints.\nWe evaluated all the methods using these human-labeled constraints. To account for the labeling noise in the constraints, we set ǫ = 0.15 for DCRC and DCRC-YN2. The averaged results for all methods are listed in Table V. We observe that while most of the competing methods’ performance degrade\n2For these noisy constraints, our method remains robust to the choice of ǫ. Using different values of ǫ ranging from 0.05 to 0.2 only introduces minor fluctuations (within 0.01 difference) to the F-measure.\nwith added constraints compared with unsupervised Kmeans, our method still shows significant performance improvement even with the noisy constraints. We want to point out that the performance difference we observe is not due to the use of the multi-class logistic classifier. In particular, as shown in Table V(a), without considering any constraints, the logistic model achieves significantly lower performance than Kmeans. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in utilizing the side information provided by noisy constraints to improve clustering.\nRecall that ITML is competitive with DCRC-YN previously considering noise-free constraints. Here with noisy constraints, DCRC-YN achieves far better accuracy than ITML, suggesting that our method is much more robust to labeling noise. It is also worth noting that although the dnk constraints tend to be quite noisy, they do not seem to degrade the performance of DCRC compared with DCRC-YN.\nOur case study also points to possible ways to further improve our model. As revealed by Table IV, the noise on the labels for relative constraints is not uniform as assumed by our model. An interesting future direction is to introduce a non-uniform noise process to more realistically model the users’ labeling behaviors."

      "heading" : "VI. RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Clustering with Constraints: Various techniques have been proposed for clustering with pairwise constraints [4]–[8], [10]. Our work is aligned with most of these methods in the sense that we assume the guidance for labeling constraints is the underlying instance clusters.\nFewer work has been done on clustering with relative constraints. The work in [12]–[16] propose metric learning approaches that use d(xi, xj) < d(xi, xk) to encode that xi is more similar to xj than to xk , where d(·) is the distance function. The work [15] studies learning from relative comparisons between two pairs of instances, which can be viewed as the same type of constraints when only three distinct examples are involved. By construction, these methods only consider constraints with yes/no labels. Practically, such answers might not always be provided, causing limitation of their applications. In contrast, our method is more flexible by allowing users to provide dnk constraints,\nThere also exist studies that encode the instance relative similarities in the form of hieratical ordering and attempt hierarchical algorithms that directly find clustering solutions satisfying the constraints [17], [29]. Different with those studies, our work builds on a natural probabilistic model that has not been considered for learning with relative constraints.\nSemi-supervised Learning: Related work also exists in a much broader area of semi-supervised learning, involving studies on both clustering and classification problems. The work [19] proposes that to enforce the formed clusters with large separation margins, we could minimize the entropy on the unlabeled data, in addition to learning from the labeled ones. The study [20] suggests to also maximize the entropy of the cluster label distribution in order to find balanced clustering solution. Our final formulation draws inspiration from the above work.\n10"

      "heading" : "VII. CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "In this paper, we studied clustering with relative constraints, where each constraint is generated by posing a query: is xi more similar to xj than to xk . Unlike existing methods that only consider yes/no responses to such queries, we studied the case where the answer could also be dnk (don’t know). We developed a probabilistic method DCRC that learns to cluster the instances based on the responses acquired by such queries. We empirically evaluated the proposed method using both simulated (noise-free) constraints and human-labeled (noisy) constraints. The results demonstrated the usefulness of dnk constraints, the significantly improved performance of DCRC over existing methods, and the superiority of our method in terms of the robustness to noisy constraints."

    "abstractText" : "We study the problem of clustering with relative constraints, where each constraint specifies relative similarities among instances. In particular, each constraint (xi, xj , xk) is acquired by posing a query: is instance xi more similar to xj than to xk? We consider the scenario where answers to such queries are based on an underlying (but unknown) class concept, which we aim to discover via clustering. Different from most existing methods that only consider constraints derived from yes and no answers, we also incorporate don’t know responses. We introduce a Discriminative Clustering method with Relative Constraints (DCRC) which assumes a natural probabilistic relationship between instances, their underlying cluster memberships, and the observed constraints. The objective is to maximize the model likelihood given the constraints, and in the meantime enforce cluster separation and cluster balance by also making use of the unlabeled instances. We evaluated the proposed method using constraints generated from ground-truth class labels, and from (noisy) human judgments from a user study. Experimental results demonstrate: 1) the usefulness of relative constraints, in particular when don’t know answers are considered; 2) the improved performance of the proposed method over state-of-theart methods that utilize either relative or pairwise constraints; and 3) the robustness of our method in the presence of noisy constraints, such as those provided by human judgement.",
