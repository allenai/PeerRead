The re­ moval of a small number of links may re­ duce the computational complexity dramat­ ically, since several fill-ins and moral links may be rendered superfluous by the removal. The method is described in terms of im­ pact on the independence graph, the junc­ tion tree, and the potential functions associ­ ated with these. An empirical evaluation of the method using large real-world networks demonstrates the applicability of the method. Further, the method, which has been imple­ mented in Hugin, complements the approxi­ mation method suggested by Jensen & An­ dersen (1990).",
