      "text" : "In 1880 Lucius Sherman (Sherman 1923) (DuBay 2004) studied the structure of English language from a statistical point of view, finding that the average number of words in English sentences had diminished from 50, at times before Queen Elizabeth, to 23 at Sherman’s times. A second result showed that writers are consistent in the average number of words per sentence (DuBay 2004). Efforts to construct methods to evaluate text readability have continued since then. During the early twentieth century, teachers evaluated texts relying on the Teacher’s Word Book (Thorndike, A Teacher's Word Book 1921) by Thorndike; a collection of the 10,000 most frequently used words in English published in 1921 and extended to 20,000 words in 1932 (Thorndike, A Teacher's Word Book of 20,000 Words 1932) and 30,000 in 1994 (Thorndike, The Teacher's Word Book of 30,000 Words 1944). These word-frequency lists were mostly used to evaluate the appropriateness of reading material for children at elementary schools.\nThese vocabulary lists became the basis for describing an underlying structure as is the English language word frequency distribution known today as the Zipf’s law (Kirby 1985), due to George Kingsley Zipf’s renowned work, Human Behavior and The Principle of Least Effort (Zipf 1949).\nEvaluation of quality of writing basically consisted in counting the number of different words in a text as a measurement of the author’s size of vocabulary.\nStarting with his PhD thesis (Flesch, Marks of a readable style 1943) in 1943, Rudolf Flesh publish a series of books (Flesch, The art of plain talk 1946, Flesch, The art of readable writing 1949, Flesch, How to test readability 1951, Flesch, The art of clear thinking 1951, 1973, Flesch, How to write, speak and think more effectively 1958) studying English texts. These efforts led to the Reading Ease Score, usually referred to as RES, a formula based on the weighed combination of vocabulary, average word character-length and average sentence word-length, useful to evaluate the ease, or difficulty, to read and understand the content of texts. After Flesch’s original work, other researchers built formulas based on to Flesch’s RES formula. Adaptations for specific uses such as the evaluation of applicants to enter the US navy (Kincaid, et al. 1975) and institutions in charge of assessing reading and comprehension of prospective students of American universities (Kathleen M. Sheehan, Irene Kostin, Yoko Futagi, Michael Flor 2010), as well as for analyzing the suitability of basic school texts appeared and became the theme of much research and\nexperimentation. Within the fields where readability formulas have been a useful tool, health occupies an important place (Barrio Cantalejo 2008, Trauzettel-Klosinski, Susanne; Dietz, Klaus; Group, the IReST Study August 2012, Gröne n.d.), but the field of education resulted best suited for the application of these readability formulas and scaled versions specially made by Chall (Chall 1958), Kincaid and others.\nIn 1959 Fernandez-Huerta (Fernández-Huerta 1959) adjusted the original Flesh’s readability formula and produced the ‘Formula de lecturabilidad de Fernández-Huerta’ (Readability Formula) for Spanish. Another adaptation of Flesch formula presented by Szigriszt (Szigriszt-Pazos 1993) named ‘Formula de Perspicuidad’ (Perpicuity Formula) or SZPF, as we will refer to it, has become the current standard to evaluate Spanish texts readabilities.\nIn recent years a different approach to measure readability as appeared. Relying on today’s computing\ncapacity Tanaka-Ishii K., Tezuka S. and Terada H. (Tanaka-Ishii, Tezuka and Terada 2010), proposed looking at readability as a relative property of texts instead of an absolute assessment. Theirs is a method based on Support Vector Machines and sorting algorithms. Yet, traditional readability formulas are widely accepted, and remain as the most used method to evaluate the appropriateness of texts in accordance with the audience they are intended for.\nThe relationship between readability measures and word frequency profiles is focused during the 1960’s by Klare (Klare 1968). To the Zipf’s ‘Human Behavior and The Principle of Least Effort’, Klare added the mechanisms by which small word’s typical high frequency of appearance in natural language texts, is an underlying ‘learning’ factor which makes the communication process more effective as shorter words are better and more rapidly understood from by both interacting parts, the emitter and the receiver. Highlighting the fact that any communication process is not only less laborious, but also more effective when shorter symbols are used.\nThe possibility of measuring the quality of writing became a need with the emergence of schools and colleges qualifying tests. Writing skills, in spite of being a neat reflex of intellectual capabilities, is an elusive property to measure. On the other hand, complexity measurements of text messages addresses only the evaluation of the quantity of information needed to specify and transmit the message, compressibility and other information aspects, focusing on the mere descriptive process and disregarding the idea content, beauty or any other form of valuable characteristic of the message. As an alternative, we suggest evaluating quality of writing by formulas based on characterizations of texts Zipf’s profiles. We assume that vocabulary, sentence length, word syllabic length and all parameters included in classic and new readability formulas are represented, and actually specify the shape of any textual message. The particular language grammar rules establish restrictions some degrees of freedom of the symbol frequency distribution profile (Febres, Jaffé and Gershenson 2013), but there is still enough space for the profile to be sensitive to some properties of a text as for example: organization, coherence, vocabulary richness, length of sentences and word difficulty, which have influence over readability.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of quality of writing over text messages word diversity, information measures and ranked frequency profiles. Using a library fed with texts written by Nobel laureates in literature and by other public figures, we evaluated differences in diversity and complexity indices that might be related to writing quality. We propose an evaluation scale for English and Spanish that we claim is sensible to the quality or writing."

Combining writers and Nobel laureates for English and Spanish we obtained four groups for our analysis.\nEach text was characterized by its symbol diversity , entropy ℎ and symbol frequency distribution in accordance with the definitions shown below.

(9) Notice that Zipf’s deviation, calculated as Expression (7) indicates, also works expresses a relative deviation.\n2.5 Writing Quality Scale 123 We did not find any computerized method to evaluate quality of writing. Thus, we designed a method for evaluating the quality of writing which results in a value we called Writing Quality Scale (456). Our method is based on evaluations of Equations (7), (8) and (9) for several hundred texts organized in groups as will be explain in Section 2.7.\n2.6 Readability formulas 783 and 9:3; Readability formulas are available for many languages. They do not measure quality of writing but the appropriateness of a text for certain group of readers like, for example, children belonging to a school\ngrade. Thus we used some readability formulas as a reference to compare <ℎ= 456 with them. For English we used the Reading Easy Score (>?6) by Flesch (Flesch, How to test readability 1951):\n>?6 = 206.835 – 84.6 4 – 1.015 6 , (10) where 4 is the average of the word length measured in syllables and 6 the average of the phrase length measured in words. For Spanish we used the adaptation that Szigriszt (Szigriszt-Pazos 1993) made to the >?6 formula, named the Perspicuity Index(HI6&):\nHI6& = 206.835 – 84.6 4 – 6 , (11) where 4 and 6 represent the same as in >?6 formula. Values of 6 were obtained as 6 = J KL⁄ where N is the text length measured in words and KL is the text length measured in phrases. In English as well as in Spanish, a phrase ends every time a period, colons, semicolons, question mark, exclamation sign or ellipsis appears. Thus KL equal the addition of the appearances of the mentioned punctuation signs. The average number of syllables per word 4 is calculated as\n4 = 6O 4⁄ , (12) being PQ is the number of syllables of the whole text. To determine the number of syllables PQ is more difficult than counting words or punctuation signs; since syllables are the textual representation of single sounds, the number of rules and their exceptions to extract syllables from a text is rather large, and thus recognizing them with an automatic process is not a straight forward computation. Strict correspondence between writing and pronunciation, and vice versa, rarely exists for English words. For Spanish, there is correspondence from writing to pronunciation, meaning that starting form a written word, we known its sound; but there may be many ways of writing it when we hear its sounds. This ambiguous correspondence between writing and pronunciation appears in English, Spanish and up to some degree1 in most alphabetic natural languages2. To prevent the writing of software codes to count syllables in English and Spanish texts, we decided to estimate PQ by computing\nPQ = RS TPQ⁄ , (13) where RS is the number of characters not including punctuation signs in the text and TPQ is the average number of characters contained in a syllable. Looking for other researcher’s indicators of the number of characters per syllable, we found three pairs of PQ values for English and Spanish. First: in her PhD thesis (Barrio Cantalejo 2008) Barrio Cantalejo explains how Szigriszt used Eaton’s dictionary (Eaton 1940) to estimate values TPQ = 1.69 and TPQ = 2.67 for English and Spanish respectively. Second: in their study (Trauzettel-Klosinski, Susanne; Dietz, Klaus; Group, the IReST Study August 2012), Trauzettel-Klosinski and Dietz measured the number of words, syllables and characters for 17 languages. They obtained values of TPQ = 3.15 and TPQ = 1.9 for English and Spanish. Third: Gualda Gil (Gualda Gil 2013) compares the density of information conveyed by English and Spanish texts. As part of his analysis, he reports values of TPQ = 3.57 and TPQ = 2.94 for English and Spanish. Observing the lack of coherence among these values, we did our own count of syllables over a sample texts and calculated values of TPQ. Our\n1 Some languages exhibit high coherent in pronunciation and writing. 2 Natural alphabetic languages are those whose writing consists of words build up with syllables represented by characters of an alphabet. Most known alphabets are the Latin, Cyrillic, Greek and Arabic. Natural syllabic languages represent phonograms by a single symbol or morpheme, therefore a set of letters (graphemes) to represent single sounds is not needed. Natural syllabic languages include Chinese and Japanese.\nresults were within a 5% difference from those reported by Gualda Gil and therefore, we used the values he reported into Equation (13)."

The texts were originally written in different languages including English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Arabic, Russian, Chinese and Swedish. Since the analysis was done for English and Spanish, many of the texts used are translations from the original versions. Most texts are from politicians, human rights defenders and literature Nobel Laureates. To complete the library, some novel fragments were also included. Novel fragments correspond to English and Spanish writers and Nobel laureates as well.\nWe created groups of speeches and novel segments for English and Spanish: one group of texts with undoubtedly good language users, those who received Nobel Prizes for literature, and another group by authors for which we have no special reason to assume an out-of-average use of the language. Texts classified as written by a Nobel laureate are all in their original language; thus for example, the Spanish version of a speech by Gabriel García Márquez would be considered as a ‘Nobel text’ while its translation to English would be in the common writers text group.\nTo compute word frequencies, we considered punctuation signs as words. A detailed explanation about especial symbol considerations can be found in (Febres, Jaffé and Gershenson 2013). Text libraries, computations and results registering were performed by MoNet, a complex system analysis software we developed this and previous works (Febres, Jaffé and Gershenson 2013)."

      "text" : "Not being a literature Nobel laureate does not mean poor writing capabilities. But winning a literature Nobel Prize is guaranty of being gifted for excellent writing as well as master knowledge and control over a natural language. Some measurable difference should emerge from classifying writers by those who were recognized with a Nobel Prize and those who did not.\nFigures 1, 2 and 4 present a clear evidence of the tendency of Nobel laureate messages to differ from the average public figure in writing. When comparing Nobel and non-Nobel laureate messages, the average of the former group tends to show higher specific diversity and lower entropy ℎ. This is interesting because the higher specific diversity of Nobel laureate texts should promote a higher entropy due to the larger scale of the language used implied by the larger vocabulary. See Equations (2) and (15) to observe how affects the resulting entropy ℎ. Nonetheless, in spite of the larger vocabulary exhibited by literature Nobel laureates in their texts, the associated entropies ℎ are lower. Thus ℎ -. is a second variable to include in a writing quality evaluation scale. Our data shows that Zipf’s deviation ) , is a third variable to have influence over a writing quality evaluation scale.\nAs some clustering is observed for the Nobel laureate class, we estimated the coordinates of the centers and a direction vector pointing from the non-laureate class center to the Nobel laureate class center.

However, good writing structure and style must include readability as an important characteristic of the resulting text. The measures of entropy explored here add information about more general aspects of writing quality. Other factor influencing the readability indexes is the complexity of the idea being deployed with the text. A complex idea probably cannot be explained with the same high readability index as a simple idea. Thus the question is: How readable can a writer write a text to convey some complex idea? There is no obvious answer, among others reasons because the complexity of the idea is a subjective factor itself. But good writers should tend to produce more readable texts – with higher readability indexes: >?6 for English and HI6& for Spanish– than those less talented for this activity. In fact, Figure 6 shows that for Spanish there is higher density on Nobel texts over the upper readability range, indicating that Spanish Nobel laureates tend to produce texts with high readability. For English, we did not detect any important difference between the readability of the texts produced by Noble and non-Nobel laureates. Focusing on the graphs of Figure 6, they show Nobel texts placed toward high 456 , confirming that 456 captures some of the properties associated quality and style of writing."

      "text" : "Our analysis showed that some properties of texts written in English and Spanish, such as entropy, symbol diversity, and frequency distribution profiles, relate to aspects of what is considered by professionals “good writing” in natural languages. This is encouraging because it suggests the feasibility of using quantitative measures to characterize certain aspects related to the quality of writings. This opens the door to eventually develop tools for automatic text evaluations. The fact that quality was related to less entropy, suggest that skilful writing involves incorporation of order, in addition to that\nincorporated by grammar (Febres, Jaffé and Gershenson 2013), into the text. The precise nature of this additional order is still unknown, but our method serves to detect its presence.\nThe results found so far are to be taken as insights of a preliminary exploration of the complexity of texts. Certainly, further studies applying these methods to a larger set of texts and extending the methods to other writing genres may lead to further refinements that may make WQS a useful tool for evaluation of writing capabilities. We believe, however, that feasibility of automated quantitative evaluation of writing quality is getting closer."

    "abstractText" : "We measured entropy and symbolic diversity for English and Spanish texts including literature Nobel laureates and other famous authors. Entropy, symbol diversity and symbol frequency profiles were compared for these four groups. We also built a scale sensitive to the quality of writing and evaluated its relationship with the Flesch ́s readability index for English and the Szigriszt ́s perspicuity index for Spanish. Results suggest a correlation between entropy and word diversity with quality of writing. Text genre also influences the resulting entropy and diversity of the text. Results suggest the plausibility of automated quality assessment of texts.",
