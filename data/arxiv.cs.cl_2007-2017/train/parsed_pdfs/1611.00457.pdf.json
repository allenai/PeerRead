      "text" : "Though current researches often study the properties of online social relationship from an objective view, we also need to understand individuals’ subjective opinions on their interrelationships in social computing studies. Inspired by the\ntheories from sociolinguistics, the latest work indicates that interactive language can reveal individuals’ asymmetric opinions on their interrelationship. In this work, in order to explain the opinions’ asymmetry on interrelationship with more latent factors,\nwe extend the investigation from single relationship to the structural context in online social network. We analyze the correlation between interactive language features and the structural context of interrelationships. The structural context of\nvertex, edges and triangles in social network are considered. With statistical analysis on Enron email dataset, we find that individuals’ opinions (measured by interactive language features) on their interrelationship are related to some of their important structural\ncontext in social network. This result can help us to understand and measure the individuals’ opinions on their interrelationship with more intrinsic information.\nCCS Concepts\n• Human-centered computing ➝ Collaborative and social\ncomputing ➝ Collaborative and social computing design and\nevaluation methods ➝ Social network analysis .\nKeywords Asymmetric Opinions; Social Interrelationship; Interactive Language; Structural Context; Social network."

      "text" : "It’s an essential problem in social computing to recognize the\nnature of the social interrelationships between individuals. The model of interrelationship is fundamental to many related studies such as community discovery, influence analysis, link predication and recommendation [2]. There are two primary options to\ndetermine the nature of an interrelationship: The first one is to model the interrelationship from an objective view which supposes the properties of interrelationships can be investigated independently of the subjective opinions of participant individuals.\nThe second option supposes the properties of interrelationships are subjective which should be determined by investigating each individual’s opinion on their interrelationships respectively. The interrelationship model based on these two strategies can be quite\ndifferent. For an interrelationship, the objective principle often assign a single value to each property, which is symmetric to both sides of the interrelationship. While the subjective principle naturally leads to an asymmetric measurement of interrelationship’\nproperties because the two individuals may have different opinions on their interrelationship from their own side.\nThe subjective asymmetric model of interrelationship is more informative and sensitive than the objective relationship model. To perform asymmetric measurement of interrelationship’s properties, we need some features which can reflect the subjective\nopinions of individuals. Researches on signed social networks suggest to predicate the properties’ value for each individual according to the network they are embedded in. Linguistic analysis suggests another path forward to leverage textual features\nto predict individual’s opinion.\nIntuitively, to describe the individuals’ opinions on their interrelationship, the features of their interactive language should be more capable than the features of their social relationships.\nHowever, the structural features of their social relationship may still be a latent cause which influence their asymmetric opinions on interrelationship, and can also be helpful to understand and measure individuals’ asymmetric opinions indirectly.\nIn this work, we investigate the relationship between individuals’ opinions on their interrelationship and their structural characteristics in social network. To do this, we try to investigate the correlation between the typical language features of interactive\nlanguage and the typical structural features of social network."

However, current studies do not explore the intrinsic causes of the opinions’ asymmetry on\ninterrelationships sufficiently, and does not make full use of the topology information from the social network to explain the opinions on the interrelationships. In this paper, we focus on the factors that cause individuals’ asymmetric opinions on\ninterrelationships.\nIf individuals’ opinions only depend on their own subjective ideas, then we can only measure their opinions with subjective features e.g., the features of interactive language. Intuitively, an\nindividual’s opinion on one of his social relationships is not only determined by his own ideas, but also affected by other relationships or individuals related to him in the social network. Therefore, in this paper, we try to put a single interrelationship\ninto social network context in order to investigate the correlation between the individuals’ opinions and social network features. As in [14], opinions will be characterized by the features of interactive language. This investigation will tell us whether the\nsocial network characteristics are intrinsic causes of individuals’ opinions on their interrelationship, and shall we introduce topology features into the subjective model of social relationship.\nIn section 2, we introduce how to characterize the asymmetric\nopinions on interrelationship with interactive language features. In section 3, we investigate the correlation between structural factors and asymmetric opinions. Finally we introduce the experiments in section 4 and summarize the conclusions in section 5."

      "text" : "WITH INTERACTIVE LANGUAGE\nFEATURES In current studies, most of the researches aim at investigating the strength or type (e.g., positive & negative) of the social relationship between two individuals from an objective view by measuring the objective features, e.g., the frequency of the\ncommunication between participants and the embeddedness of interrelationship. On this basis, some researches utilize the directed objective features, e.g., the bidirectional communication frequency between two participants. However, it’s still difficult to\ndescribe subjective opinions accurately using directed objective features only. Therefore, it’s a new trend to combine subjective and objective features to model social relationships, especially from subjective view.\nAlong with the researches on subjective features, researchers find\nthat interactive language is a good choice to obtain subjective features of interrelationship, because the interactive language not\nonly related to the properties of interrelationship closely, but also is very capable to describe individuals’ opinions. In this section, we’ll compare the objective and subjective features of the\ninterrelationship and then utilize several typical subjective features of interactive language to measure the asymmetric opinions on interrelationship following the method in [14]."

      "heading" : "2.1 Objective Features of Interrelationship",
      "text" : "The most widely used objective feature of social relationship is the topology features of social network. Among social network\nfeatures, the embeddedness of interrelationships and the communication frequency between the participants are two most popular objective features to measure social relationships.\nThe embeddedness is a feature which can measure the strength of an interrelationship with the coincidence degree of two\nindividuals’ interrelationships, i.e., the count of the common ‘friends’ of the two participants. Embeddedness has been proved to be an effective objective feature which describes the strength of interrelationships, but it is not designed to be directed.\nThe frequency of certain type of communication between the two participants are also used to represent the strength of an\ninterrelationship in many studies. The frequency of phone calls, emails and mutual comments on social media are all widely used frequency features. Exactly speaking, communication frequency is not an absolute objective feature, because it is a behavior of the\nparticipants which is a subjective decision in a sense. The communication frequency can naturally be measured directionally, e.g., we can measure the bidirectional strength of an interrelationship with bidirectional communication frequency. But,\nthe communication frequency cannot measure subjective opinions directly with very limited information. For example, in some cases, though we have similar email frequency with two colleagues, we may have different attitudes towards the interrelationships with the two colleagues respectively.\nThe subjective features e.g., linguistic features of interactive language can be used to recognize the participants’ opinions on their interrelationship more directly. For the same example, though we have similar email frequency with two colleagues, our\ndifferent attitudes on two interrelationships still can be revealed by the content of the emails."

      "text" : "The subjective feature can reveal the participants’ opinions on their interrelationship. Based on it, the theory of communicative action [6] in sociolinguistics proposed to reconstruct the concept\nof relationship with the communicative action instead of the objectivistic information. Thus we can utilize the linguistic structures of communication to understand the social relationships more normatively. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis [11] also supposed\nthat the semantic structure of the language use shapes the ways in which a speaker forms conceptions of the world including social relationships. Individuals’ choices of the words in communication were highly related to their opinions on their interrelationship.\nTherefore we can investigate the asymmetric opinions on social relationships with the interactive language used.\nHow can we describe an individual’s interactive language style in order to describe his opinion on his interrelationship? In sociolinguistics, Holmes [8] proposed four important dimensions to study the language used in social communication:\n1. The solidarity-social distance scale: concentrate on the solidarity of the relationships in social communication.\n2. The social status scale: concentrate on the relative status of the individuals in social relationship.\n3. The formality scale: concentrate on the formality of language that individuals use in different places, topics and relationships.\n4. The referential and affective scale: concentrate on referential\nand affective function of the language that individuals use in social communication.\nAmong these four dimensions, the first two mainly concern about the features of social interrelationship from both subjective and objective views. The last two aim at the features of interactive languages, which are highly related to the social interrelationship.\nInspired by Holmes’ theory, in this work, we use four typical\nfeatures of interactive language to investigate individuals’ opinion on their interrelationships, including frequency, length, fluency and sentiment polarity which indicate quantity, quality and emotion of the interactive language, respectively:\n1. The frequency is the number of times of communications\nwithin a specified period of time, which can partially reflect one’s intentions of the communication on an interrelationship.\n2. The length is the number of the words of the interactive language , which is related to one’s emphasis degree on an interrelationship.\n3. The fluency is a widely used feature in natural language processing which can reflect the formality and quality of\ninteractive language. We can speculate whether an individual treats an interrelationship seriously or not with the quality of his language in communication.\n4. The sentiment polarity can indicate the emotion tendency of the interactive language, which tends to have a positive correlation with the personal evaluation on an interrelationship intuitively."

In this work, we focus on the individual’s language habit and its influence on the\nunderstanding of his interactive language. The meaning of a speaker’s language is intuitively related to his language habit. For example, suppose A is a negative people who talks to every people very negatively. We also know that A talks to another person B\nwith negative sentiment polarity score, but A talks to B most friendly compared with the others. In this case, if we want to measure A’s opinion on his relationship with B correctly with sentiment polarity score, we need to avoid the interference from\nA’s language habit and use the relative score normalized by A’s personal language habit instead of using the original score directly.\nIn this work, for an individual I, to characterize I’s opinion more accurately and avoid the interference from I’s language habit, we normalize I’s each language feature f with I’s language habit value\nHf(I).

In this work, we suppose that embeddedness is also related to the degree of opinions’ asymmetry on an\ninterrelationship. This assumption is based on the similar idea of the strength measurement of social relationship: it is widely believed that more common friends indicate make two persons\nconnected to each other more tightly. In this work, we suppose that more common friends can also make two persons’ opinions on their interrelationship more symmetric.

      "heading" : "3.3.2 Our extension of the balance theory",
      "text" : "The homogeneity based explanation in previous section extend the traditional balance theory from binary s igns to continuous value. Furthermore, this explanation can also extend the traditional balance theory from undirected relationship to directed\nrelaitonship, because it describes the balance with individual’s opinion instead of the objective type. This extension makes it possible to investigate the correlation between triangle balance and opinions’ asymmetry on interrelationship. In this section, we\nintroduce the details of this extension of traditional balance theory.\nFirst of all, let’s analyze the essential idea of the traditional balance theory. The idea is: the polarity of an interrelationship is related to the homogeneity (common friends) of the two\nparticipants. To be exact, the homogeneity here indicates the consistency of the views about the third party (person or thing). With this assumption, the traditional balance theory can only predict the binary polarity of an interrelationship between two\npersons A and B with the binary polarity of their interrelationship with a third person C. It’s obvious that in traditional balance theory, we cannot determine the balance of a triadic closure with the individuals’ directed opinions instead of the undirected binary\nsigns on interrelationships.\nTo solve this problem, we extend the traditional balance theory to a directed version keeping the essential principle of homogeneity. In the extension, an individual A’s opinion on his interrelationship\nwith another individual B, is presented as a continuous value on a directed edge (A, B).When we want to investigate the bidirectional opinions’ asymmetry between A and B, we build an extended triadic closure with four directed edges include (A, B), (B, A), (A,\nC) and (B, C) as shown in Figure 2. Instead of the binary sign, we label each directed edge with a real-value in [0, 1] to indicate the opinion of the individual on the start point, e.g., |AB| indicates the value of A’s opinion on his relationship with B.\nIn this extended triadic closure, we measure the balance of the triadic closure comparing two differences: when the difference between |AC| and |BC| is smaller than a threshold, we recognize the sign of the opinions’ difference on the third party as ‘-’, which\nmeans A and B has similar opinions on their interrelationships with C. Otherwise we recognize the sign of the opinions’ difference on the third party as ‘+’, which means A and B have different opinions on their interrelationships with C.\nIn the same way, when the difference between |AB| and |BA| is smaller than the same threshold, we recognize the sign of the opinions’ difference on interrelationship as ‘-’ which means A and B have similar opinions on the ir interrelationship. Otherwise we\nrecognize the sign of the opinions’ difference on interrelationship as ‘+’ which means A and B have different opinions on the ir interrelationship. The threshold here is the average of all bidirectional differences on every interrelationship in the given\nsocial network. If the opinions’ difference on the third party and the opinions’ difference on interrelationship has the same sign, we identify the directed triadic closure as balanced, otherwise, it is unbalanced."

In the experiment of vertexes’ degree, the asymmetry degree of ‘length’ and ‘sentiment’ score relatively have higher negative correlation with the degree of vertexes, and the other two features have no significant correlation. This\nindicates that a more sociable person, i.e., a person with more friends, may be more active to cater to the partners’ opinions in social interrelationships, i.e., have less asymmetry degree on interrelationships, especially reflected on the intension (length)\nand sentiment tendency (sentiment score).\nThough ‘length’ and ‘sentiment’ score also have relative higher correlation in the experiment of clustering coefficient, the absolute values are too small, therefore we don’t think that there is\ncorrelation between the clustering coefficient and the average asymmetry degree of vertexes on any language feature in this case.\nFurthermore, the correlation of frequency is the lowest. One possible explanation is that the send/replay relationships between\nthe emails can always lead to similar bidirectional email sending frequency between two individuals. This bidirectional correlation is independent with the opinions or social structure of the individuals.\nIn general, in this set of experiments, we find that the degree (number of friends) of the individuals in social network may have latent influence on the individuals’ opinions and language behaviors on their each interrelationships."

The results are shown in Table 2. Figure 5 illustrates the correlation curves of four language features, where the abscissa is the common friends’\nnumber (embeddedness) of edges, and the ordinate is the average asymmetry degree.\nAs shown in the results, we can find that the embeddedness of interrelationship have a high negative correlation with the average asymmetry degree on all four language features. This indicates that if two individuals have more common friends, the asymmetry\nof their opinions on their interrelationship is weaker, i.e., they have more similar opinions on their interrelationship.\nThis result can also be an important extension to the traditional triadic closure theory of social relationship. The traditional triadic\nclosure theory states that the strength of a social interrelationship has a positive correlation with the number of common friends. For any two individuals, our results extend the theory to the positive correlation among the number of their common friends, the\nstrength of their interrelationship and the symmetry of their opinions on their interrelationship."

      "text" : "In the last set of experiments, we firstly verified the balance assumption in traditional balance theory introduced in section\n3.3.1 on Enron email data. The balance assumption in tradition balance theory is that in any social network, the signed triadic closures tend to be balanced in general. Since the traditional balance theory is based on undirected edge, we merge every two\nbidirectional edge pairs between two vertexes into a new undirected edge whose opinion value is the sum of two opinion values on bidirectional edges. Then we set a tunable threshold. The merged undirected edge whose opinion value is bigger than\nthe threshold was labeled ‘+’, otherwise was labeled ‘-’.\nIn a given social network, in order to verify the traditional balance assumption, we should firstly determine a random baseline for the triadic closures distribution. In other word, in a social network,\ngiven a prior proportion of the positive (signed by '+’) edges noted as p+, and the proportion of negative (signed by '-’) edges noted as 1- p+, the random baseline for the triadic closures distribution is the proportion of balanced triadic closures when all the positive\nand negative edges are randomly distributed. Assuming that the\nproportion of the positive edges labeled ‘+’ is p+ (0≤p+≤1). According to the traditional balance theory in traduced in section\n3.3.31, we can calculate the proportion of balanced triadic closures Pbalance_traditional in random distribution using Formula (9), where \uD835\uDC5D+ 3 is the probability of balanced tringles labeled ‘+++’, and 3\uD835\uDC5D(1 − \uD835\uDC5D+) 2 is the probability of balanced tringles labeled ‘+--’, ‘-+-’, and ‘--+’\n\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC52_\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59 = \uD835\uDC5D+ 3 + 3\uD835\uDC5D(1 − \uD835\uDC5D+) 2 (9)\nIn Figure 6, we illustrate the proportion of balanced triangles with\ndifferent proportion of positive edges. In the experiments, we change the proportion of positive edges by tuning the threshold of ‘+/-’ labeling. In Figure 6, the abscissa is the proportion of positive edges, the ordinate is the proportion of balanced triangles.\nThe red curve is the baseline of random distribution. The other four curve are results on four language features, respectively.\nIn Figure 6, we have two observations. First, we can intuitively find that the balanced triangles proportion and the proportion of\npositive edges are positively correlated. This is consistent with the fact that in traditional balance theory, two balanced tringles have more positive edges than two unbalanced triangles. Second, we can find that the proportions of balanced triangles on all four\nfeatures increase faster than the random baseline with the increase of positive edges proportion. When the positive edges proportion\nis bigger than 0.5, the proportions of balanced triangles is greater than random baseline on all features.\nFrom a dynamic point of view, the observations indicate that\nwhen more interrelationship turn to be positive in a social network, the social interrelationship triangles will turn to be balanced at a faster rate. From a static point of view, the balanced triangles may not always have advantages than unbalanced triangles. Its\nadvantage is more significant in the social network where positive relationship accounted for the majority."

      "text" : "Based on the extension of traditional balance theory in section\n3.3.2， in this experiment, we investigate whether the balance assumption is still correct in the extended balance theory.\nIn the extended balance theory, a triadic closure is balanced when\nthe opinions’ difference on the third party and the opinions’ difference on the interrelationship has the same sign. Given a threshold, we turn the above two differences into ‘+/-’ signs. The difference greater than the threshold is signed ‘+’, and vice versa.\nWe suppose the proportion of positive difference (signed by ‘+’) is p’+. In extended balance theory the tringles with ‘++’ and ‘--’ signs are balanced. Therefore, we calculate the proportion of balanced triadic closures Pbalance_extended in random distribution using Formula (10).\n\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC52_\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59 = \uD835\uDC5D+ 2 + (1 − \uD835\uDC5D+) 2 (10)\nAs in section 4.5.1, we can adjust the proportion of interrelationship with positive difference (i.e., difference bigger than threshold) with different threshold values. Then, we can investigate whether the balance assumption is still correct by\ninvestigating whether the balanced tringles are still dominant in extended balance theory.\nThe result curves are shown in Figure 7. The abscissa is the proportion of interrelationship pairs having positive differences,\nthe ordinate is the proportion of balanced triadic closures. There are five curves in the diagram among which the red one represents the random baseline according to Formula (7), the red curve is the baseline of random distribution. The other four curve are results\non four language features, respectively.\nIn Figure 7, we have two observations. First, we can find that when the proportion of the positive difference interrelationship pairs is around 0.5, the proportion of balanced triadic closures\nreaches the lowest point. The reason for this phenomenon is that when the proportion of positive difference pairs is equal to that of\nnegative difference pairs, there is the maximum probability to form triadic closures with ‘+-’ signs which is unbalanced.\nSecond, we also find that the proportion of the balanced triadic\nclosure is higher than the random baseline with the increase of the proportion of negative difference relation pairs (move to the left side on X-axis). This result gives a new interpretation to the balance theory based on the asymmetric opinions measurement.\nThe homogeneity assumption of the traditional balance theory is that in a social triadic closure, the more the two individuals’ opinions on the common friends is consistent, the more positive the interrelationship between them is, and vice versa. Based on the\nresults of this experiment, we can extend this assumption. The new assumption can be stated as: in a social triadic closure, the more the two individuals’ opinions on the common friends is consistent (more negative difference on third party) , the more\nsimilar the two participants’ opinions on their interrelationship are, i.e., less asymmetric on bidirectional opinions (more negative difference on interrelationship)."

The thickness\nof the edges illustrates the language feature value on each direction of interrelationships. Therefore, the asymmetry of the opinions can be illustrated by the difference of the two edges’ thickness between each nodes pair. Furthermore, the balanced\ntriangles is colored red in both figures.

      "text" : "In this work, we investigated whether the structural context features in online social network are latent factors of individuals’\nasymmetric opinions on their interrelationship. We characterize individuals’ bidirectional opinions on interrelationships with their interactive language features following the existing method. As a case study, on Enron email dataset, we analyzed the correlations\nbetween multiple structural context features and the degree of opinions’ asymmetry. The investigated structural features includes the degree and clustering coefficient of vertexes, the embeddedness of the edges and the balance of the triadic closures.\nDuring the investigation, an extension is also made to traditional balance theory to meet the form of asymmetric opinions.\nWith the investigation on Enron email, we find that in this case, some of the structural context features in social network can be\nlatent factors influence the individuals’ asymmetric opinions on their interrelationship. First, a more sociable person, i.e., a person with more friends, tend to be more active to cater to the partners’ opinions in social interrelationships. Second, two individuals\nsharing more common friends tend to have more similar opinions on their interrelationship, which can be an extension of the traditional theory of social triadic closure. Third, in a social triadic closure, the two individuals’ having more similar opinions on\ntheir relationship with the third person also tend to have more similar opinions on their interrelationship, which can be an extension of the traditional social balance theory. Fourth, by extending the traditional balance theory to directed social triangle,\nwe show that directed social triangle also tend to be balanced in Enron email dataset.\nThese results reveal that the subjective features on a social interrelationship is not only related to individuals’ own opinions\nbut also related to their structural context in social network. This work also encourage us to further study the interaction between the topology and content in social network, and measure the social relationship synthetizing the objective and subjective features in\nfuture work."

Inspired by the theories from sociolinguistics, the latest work indicates that interactive language can reveal individuals’ asymmetric opinions on their interrelationship. In this work, in order to explain the opinions’ asymmetry on interrelationship with more latent factors, we extend the investigation from single relationship to the structural context in online social network. We analyze the correlation between interactive language features and the structural context of interrelationships. The structural context of vertex, edges and triangles in social network are considered. With statistical analysis on Enron email dataset, we find that individuals’ opinions (measured by interactive language features) on their interrelationship are related to some of their important structural context in social network.
