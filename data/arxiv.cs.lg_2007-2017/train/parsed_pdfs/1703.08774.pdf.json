      "text" : "Over the last few years, deep convolutional neural networks have led to rapid improvements in the ability of computers to classify objects in images and they are now comparable with human performance in several domains. As computers get faster and researchers develop even be er techniques, neural networks will continue to improve, especially for tasks where it is possible to get a very large number of accurately labeled training examples. In the near future, we can expect neural networks to start serving as alternatives to human experts. We would, in fact, like the neural networks to perform much be er than the human experts used to provide the training labels because these training labels are o en unreliable as indicated by the poor agreement between di erent experts (55.4% for the datasets we consider) or even between an expert and the same expert looking at the same image some time later (70.7%).1 Intuitively, we would expect the quality of the training labels to\n∗Work done as a member of the Google Brain Residency program (g.co/brainresidency). 1Inter-grader variability is a well-known issue in many se ings in which human interpretation is used as a proxy for ground truth, such as radiology [7] or pathology [6].\nprovide an upper bound on the performance of the trained net. In the rst part of the paper we show that this intuition is incorrect.\ne main contribution of the paper is to show that there are signi cantly be er ways to use the opinions of multiple experts than simply treating the consensus of the experts as the correct label or using the experts to de ne a probability distribution over labels."

      "text" : "To demonstrate that a trained neural net can perform far be er than its teacher we use the well-known MNIST benchmark for which the true labels are known and we create unreliable training labels by corrupting the true labels. is corruption is performed just once per experiment, before training starts, so the noise introduced by the corruption cannot be averaged away by training on the same example several times. MNIST has 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of isolated, normalized, hand-wri en digits and the task is to classify the image into one of ten classes. Each image has 28×28 pixels. For the purposes of this demonstration, we used a very simple neural net containing two hidden convolutional layers each with 1,024 recti ed linear units and 64 patches followed by a fully connected hidden layer of 32 recti ed linear units followed by a 10-way so max layer. We trained the net on 50,000 examples using stochastic gradient descent on mini-batches of size 200 with the Adam optimizer [14] and we used the remaining 10,000 training images as a validation set to select good values for the learning rate and the magnitude of the initial random weights. On the test data, the net that performed best on the validation set had an test error rate of 1.01% when the training labels were all correct.2 If the labels are corrupted by changing each label to one of the other nine classes with a probability of 0.5, the test error rate only rises to 2.29%. Even if each training label is changed to an incorrect label with probability 0.8 so that the teacher is wrong 80% of the time, the trained net only gets 8.23% test error. If the teacher is even less reliable there comes a point at which the neural net fails to “get the point” and its error rate rises catastrophically, but this does not happen until the teacher is extremely unreliable as is shown in Figure 1.\n2We did hyperparameter tuning for data where each training label was changed to an incorrect label with probability 0.8. If we had tuned for data where all labels were correct, the corresponding error rate would have been lower.\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n08 77\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n6 M\nar 2\n01 7\nis demonstration shows that the performance of a neural net is not limited by the accuracy of its teacher, provided the teacher’s errors are random. One obvious question is how many noisily labeled training examples are worth a correctly labeled training example. In Appendix B we show that this question can be answered, at least approximately, by computing the mutual information between the label and the truth."

      "text" : "We are interested in datasets of medical images where many different doctors have provided labels but each image has only been labeled by a few doctors and most of the doctors have only labeled a fairly small fraction of the images. We expect that some doctors will be more reliable than others and we would like to give more weight to their opinions. We also expect that the doctors will have received di erent training and may have experienced di erent distributions of images so that the relative reliability of two doctors may depend on both the class of the image and on properties of the image such as the type of camera it was taken with. In this paper we focus on datasets of images used for screening diabetic retinopathy because neural networks have recently achieved human-level performance on such images [10] and if we can produce even a relatively small improvement in the state-of-the-art system it will be of great value.\nere is more information in the particular labels produced by particular doctors than is captured by simply averaging the opinions of all the doctors who have labeled a particular image and treating this distribution as the correct answer. e amount of constraint that a training case imposes on the weights of a neural network depends on the amount of information required to specify the desired output. So if we force the network to predict what each particular doctor would say for each particular training case we should be able to get be er generalization to test data, provided this does not introduce too many extra parameters. For a K-way classi cation task, we can replace the single so max [9] that is\nnormally used by as many di erent K-way so maxes as we have doctors. Of course, there will be many doctors who have not labeled a particular training image, but this is easily handled by simply not backpropagating any error from the so maxes that are used to model those doctors. At test time we can compute the predictions of all of the modeled doctors and average them. Our belief is that forcing a neural network to model the individual doctors and then averaging at test time should give be er generalization than simply training a neural network to model the average of the doctors.\nWe should also be able to do be er than just averaging the opinions of the modeled doctors. A er we have nished learning how to model all of the individual doctors we can learn how much to weight each modeled doctor’s opinion in the averaging. is allows us to downweight the unreliable doctor models."

      "text" : "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the fastest growing cause of blindness worldwide, with nearly 415 million diabetics at risk [8]. Early detection and treatment of DR can reduce the risk of blindness by 95% [12]. One of the most common ways to detect diabetic eye disease is to have a specialist examine pictures of the back of the eye called fundus images and rate them on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy scale [16], de ned based on the type and extent of lesions (e.g. microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates) present in the image. e image is classi ed into one of 5 categories consisting of (1) No DR, (2) Mild NPDR (non-proliferative DR), (3) Moderate NPDR, (4) Severe NPDR, and (5) Proliferative DR (Figure 2). Another important clinical diagnosis that can be made from the fundus image is the presence of diabetic macular edema (DME). While this work focuses only on the 5 point grading of DR, the ndings should be applicable to DME diagnosis as well.\nMost of the prior work on diabetic retinopathy classi cation focuses on obtaining a single ground truth diagnosis for each image, and then using that for training and evaluation. Deep learning has recently been used within this se ing by Gulshan et al. [10] who show a high sensitivity (97.5%) and speci city (93.4%) in the detection of referable DR (moderate or more severe DR).3\nIn this work we explore whether, in the context of data in which every example is labeled by multiple experts, a be er model can be trained by predicting the opinions of the individual experts as opposed to collapsing the many opinions into a single one. is allows us to keep the information contained in the assignment of experts to opinions, which should be valuable because experts labelling data di er from each other in skill and area of expertise (as is the case with our opthalmologists, see Figure 3). Note that we still need a single opinion on the test set to be able to evaluate the models. To that end, we use a rigorous adjudicated reference standard for evaluation, where a commi ee of three retinal specialists resolved disagreements by discussion until a single consensus is achieved.\n3In a recent Kaggle machine-learning competition [11] for DR, all the winning models also used deep learning. ere have been non-deep-learning a empts as well. On the Messidor-2 dataset [4], Abràmo et al. [2] report a sensitivity of 96.8% at a speci city of 59.4% for detecting referable DR while Solanki et al. [22] report a sensitivity of 93.8% at a speci city of 72.2%."

      "heading" : "3.1 Model Architecture",
      "text" : "We considered a sequence of models of increasing complexity for training the diabetic retinopathy classi er (Figure 5). e neural network base used in this work is the Inception-v3 architecture proposed by Szegedy et al. [23].\n• Baseline Net (BN): Inception-v3 trained on average opinions of doctors; a TensorFlow reimplementation of the model used in Gulshan et al. [10] (see Section 4.3 for differences). • Doctor Net (DN): BN extended to model the opinions of each of the doctors (31 in total, see Section 4.2). • Weighted Doctor Net (WDN): Fixed DN with averaging weights for combining the predictions of the doctor models learned on top, one weight per doctor model. • Image-speci c WDN (IWDN): WDN with averaging weights that are learned as a function of the image. • Bo lenecked IWDN (BIWDN): IWDN with a small bo leneck layer for learning the averaging weights.\nFor BN, the outputs of the last hidden layer of Inception were used to compute the logits used in the 5-way so max output layer. For DN, the opinions of each doctor were modeled using a separate so max for each doctor, while Inception weights were shared. For evaluation, the predictions from the so max “doctor models” were arithmetically averaged to give a single 5-class prediction. For subsequent nets, the parameters and predictions of the DN model were frozen and only the averaging weights for the doctor models were learned. For WDN, one averaging weight per doctor was trained, used across all images. For IWDN, these averaging weights were made image-dependent by le ing them be a function of the last hidden layer of Inception. For BIWDN, a linear bo leneck layer of size 3 was added between the last hidden layer of Inception (which has dimension 2048) and the 31-way so max of IWDN as a precautionary measure against model under ing; a bo leneck layer of this size reduced the number of trainable parameters about 10 times.\nRather than directly learning the averaging weight for each doctor model (B)(I)WDN, we learned averaging logits for each model that we could then pass through a so max to produce averaging weights that are guaranteed to be positive. To train the averaging logits, we used the opinions of the doctors who actually labeled a training image to de ne the target output distribution for that image (Appendix C.2 discusses an alternative target). We then combined the predictions of the models of all the other doctors using the weights de ned by their current averaging logits. Finally we updated our parameters by backpropagating with the cross entropy loss between the target distribution and the weighted average prediction. is way all of the training cases that a doctor did not label can be used to learn the averaging logit for that doctor, and no extra data were needed beyond those used to learn the weights of DN. Moreover, if a doctor model has similar performance to other doctor models but makes very di erent errors it will tend to be upweighted because it will be more useful in the averaging. is upweighting of diverse doctor models would not occur if we had computed the reliabilities of the doctors separately.\nFor a single image, let I be the set of indices of the doctors who actually graded that image. Let the label of doctor i ∈ I be li . For every doctor j ∈ {1, 2, . . ., 31}, denote the prediction of its model pj . Let p∅ be the prediction of the model of the average doctor in BN. For WDN, IWDN, and BIWDN, let w j be the averaging weight for the jth modeled doctor, where ∑ j w j = 1. Note that pj is a 5-dimensional vector and w j is a scalar. e explicit inputs of the cross entropy loss being minimized during training of each model are shown in Table 1 and post-Inception computations are shown schematically in Figure 5. In the case of DN, the cross entropy losses of the individual doctor models were summed to get the total loss for each training example."

[21], who integrate the opinions of many experts to infer ground truth, there has a large body of work using EM approaches to estimate accurate labels for datasets annotated by multiple experts [18, 19, 25]. Representatively, Welinder and Perona [24] use an online EM algorithm to estimate abilities of multiple noisy annotators and to determine the most likely value of the labels. We calculated updated labels by executing Welinder and Perona [24]’s method on our human doctors and used these updated labels to train BN, as a competing algorithm for our DN method. Welinder and Perona [24] also actively select which images to label and how many labels to request based on the uncertainty of their estimated ground truth values and the desired level of con dence, and they select and prioritize which annotators to use when requesting labels. We do not use these other aspects of their algorithm because labels for all images in our dataset have already been collected."

To handle this label noise, Mnih and Hinton [15] propose a robust loss function that models asymmetric omission noise.\ney assume that a true, unobserved label m is rst generated from a wm × wm image patch s according to some distribution p(m|s), and the corrupted, observed label m̃ is then generated from m according to a noise distribution p(m̃|m). e authors assume an asymmetric binary noise distribution p(m̃i |mi ) that is the same for all pixels i . ey assume that conditioned on m, all components of m̃ are independent and that each m̃i is independent of allmj,i . e observed label distribution is then modeled as:\np(m̃|s) = w2m∏ i=1 ∑ mi p(m̃i |mi )p(mi |s)\nWe used a multi-class extension of their method on DN, modeling the noise distribution prior for all doctors d with the parameters:\nθl l ′ = p(m̃d = l ′ |md = l) where l , l ′ ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. We estimated θl l ′ using the 5×5 confusion matrix between individual and average doctor opinions on training images. Treating the average doctor opinion as the true label, we converted each doctor’s individual count matrix into proportions and then averaged these proportions across all doctors. We trained this model by minimizing the negative log posterior, −loд(p(m̃|s)). Our variant of Mnih and Hinton [15] is an alternative way to improve upon DN to our proposed approach of learning averaging weights."

We trained using TensorFlow with 32 replicas and 17 parameter servers, with 1 Tesla K80 GPU per replica. To speed up the training, we used batch normalization [13], pre-initialization of our Inception network using weights from the network trained to classify objects in the ImageNet dataset [20], and the following trick: we set the learning rate on the weight matrix producing prediction logits to one-tenth of the learning rate for\nthe other weights. We prevented over ing using a combination of L1 and L2 penalties, dropout, and a con dence penalty [17], which penalizes a model for having an output distribution with low entropy. At the end of training, we used an exponentially decaying average of the recent parameters in the nal model.\nWe tuned hyperparameters and picked model checkpoints for early stopping on the validation dataset, using 5-class classi cation error rate as the evaluation metric. e optimal values for these hyperparameters are displayed in Table 2 and the hyperparameter search spaces are listed in Appendix D. When evaluating on the test set we averaged the predictions for the horizontally and vertically ipped versions (4 in total) of every image.\nWe also trained a version of BN where the output prediction is binary instead of multi-class, as was done in Gulshan et al. [10]. e binary output was obtained by thresholding the 5-class output at the Moderate NPDR or above level, a commonly used threshold in clinics to de ne a referable eye condition. For this BN-binary network, the area under the ROC curve was used as the evaluation metric on the validation set.\nTo deal with di erences in class distribution between the datasets (Table 3), we used log prior correction during evaluation. is entails adding to the prediction logits, for each class, the log of the ratio of the proportion of labels in that class in the evaluation dataset to the proportion of labels in that class in the training set. Our assumed test class distribution for computing the log prior correction was the mean distribution of all known images (those of the training and validation sets).4 So for each image under evaluation we update the prediction logit for class c by adding:\nloд ( qvalid (c) qtrain (c) ) for the validation dataset, and\nloд\n( qvalid∪train (c)\nqtrain (c)\n) for the test dataset,\nwhere q(c) is the proportion of labels in that class.

We evaluate our method on the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy severity on the 5-point scale from images of the retina. Compared to our baseline model of training on the average doctor opinion, a strategy that yielded state-of-the-art results on automated diagnosis of DR, our method can lower 5-class classi cation test error from 23.83% to 20.58%, a relative reduction of 13.6%. We also found that, on binary metrics, training with a 5-class loss signi cantly beats training with a binary loss, as was done in the published baseline. We compared our method to competing algorithms by Welinder and Perona and by Mnih and Hinton and we showed that corresponding parts of our method give superior performance to both.

In our case, using mean class balancing lowered performance, possibly because it made too many assumptions on the hidden test distribution, and was not employed.\nC.2 Alternative target distribution for training averaging logits\nTo train the averaging logits, we took each training case and use the opinions of the doctors who actually labeled that case to de ne the target output distribution. Alternatively, the target distribution can be de ned as the equally weighted average of the predictions of the doctor models corresponding to the doctors who labeled that case.

We assumed a symmetric noise distribution that is determined by a single prior parameter. is assumes that if a label is wrong, it has equal probability of belonging to any of the other classes.

When experts disagree, the standard approaches are to treat the majority opinion as the correct label or to model the correct label as a distribution. ese approaches, however, do not make any use of potentially valuable information about which expert produced which label. To make use of this extra information, we propose modeling the experts individually and then learning averaging weights for combining them, possibly in sample-specic ways. is allows us to give more weight to more reliable experts and take advantage of the unique strengths of individual experts at classifying certain types of data. Here we show that our approach leads to improvements in computer-aided diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. We also show that our method performs beer than competing algorithms by Welinder and Perona, and by Mnih and Hinton. Our work oers an innovative approach for dealing with the myriad real-world seings that use expert opinions to dene labels for training.",
