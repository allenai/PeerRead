      "text" : "Neural machine translation (NMT; (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014)), creation of translation models using neural networks, has quickly achieved state-of-the-art results on a number of translation tasks (Luong and Manning, 2015; Sennrich et al., 2016a). In this paper, we describe NMT systems for the Japanese-English scientific paper translation task of the Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT) 2016 (Nakazawa et al., 2016a).\nThe systems are built using attentional neural networks (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015), with a number of improvements (§2). In particular we focus on two. First, we follow the recent work of Arthur et al. (2016) in incorporating discrete translation lexicons to improve the probability estimates of the neural translation model (§3). Second, we incorporate minimum-risk training (Shen et al., 2016) to optimize the parameters of the model to improve translation accuracy (§4).\nIn experiments (§5), we examine the effect of each of these improvements, and find that they both contribute to overall translation accuracy, leading to state-of-the-art results on the Japanese-English translation task."

      "heading" : "2.1 Model Structure",
      "text" : "Our model creates a model of target sentence E = e|E| 1 given source sentence F = f |F | 1\n. These words belong to the source vocabulary Vf , and the target vocabulary Ve respectively. NMT performs this translation by calculating the conditional probability pm(ei|F, e i−1 1\n) of the ith target word ei based on the source F and the preceding target words ei−1\n1 . This is done by encoding the context 〈F, ei−1 1 〉 as a\nfixed-width vector ηi, and calculating the probability as follows:\npm(ei|F, e i−1 1 ) = softmax(Wsηi + bs), (1)\nwhere Ws and bs are respectively weight matrix and bias vector parameters. The exact variety of the NMT model depends on how we calculate ηi used as input, and as mentioned above, in this case we use an attentional model.\nFirst, an encoder converts the source sentence F into a matrix R where each column represents a single word in the input sentence as a continuous vector. This representation is generated using a bidirectional encoder\n−→r j = enc(embed(fj), −→r j−1) ←−r j = enc(embed(fj), ←−r j+1).\nHere the embed(·) function maps the words into a representation (Bengio et al., 2006), and enc(·) is long short term memory (LSTM) neural network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) with forget gates set to one minus the value of the input gate (Greff et al., 2015). For the final word in the sentence, we add a sentence-end symbol to the final state of both of these decoders\n−→r |F |+1 = enc(embed(〈s〉), −→r |F |)\n←−r |F |+1 = enc(embed(〈s〉), ←−r 1).\nFinally we concatenate the two vectors −→r j and ←−r j into a bidirectional representation rj\nrj = [ ←−r j ; −→r j ].\nThese vectors are further concatenated into the matrix R where the jth column corresponds to rj . Next, we generate the output one word at a time while referencing this encoded input sentence and tracking progress with a decoder LSTM. The decoder’s hidden state hi is a fixed-length continuous vector representing the previous target words ei−1\n1 , initialized as h0 = r|F |+1. This is used to calculate\na context vector ci that is used to summarize the source attentional context used in choosing target word ei, and initialized as c0 = 0.\nFirst, we update the hidden state to hi based on the word representation and context vectors from the previous target time step\nhi = enc([embed(ei−1); ci−1],hi−1). (2)\nBased on this hi, we calculate a similarity vector αi, with each element equal to\nαi,j = sim(hi, rj). (3)\nsim(·) can be an arbitrary similarity function. In our systems, we test two similarity functions, the dot product (Luong et al., 2015)\nsim(hi, rj) := h ⊺ i rj (4)\nand the multi-layered perceptron (Bahdanau et al., 2015)\nsim(hi, rj) := w ⊺ a2tanh(Wa1[hi; rj ]), (5)\nwhere Wa1 and wa2 are the weight matrix and vector of the first and second layers of the MLP respectively.\nWe then normalize this into an attention vector, which weights the amount of focus that we put on each word in the source sentence\nai = softmax(αi). (6)\nThis attention vector is then used to weight the encoded representation R to create a context vector ci for the current time step\nci = Rai.\nFinally, we create ηi by concatenating the previous hidden state with the context vector, and performing an affine transform\nηi = Wη[hi; ci] + bη,\nOnce we have this representation of the current state, we can calculate pm(ei|F, e i−1 1\n) according to Equation (1). The next word ei is chosen according to this probability."

      "text" : "If we define all the parameters in this model as θ, we can then train the model by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the training data\nθ̂ = argmin θ\n∑\n〈F, E〉\n∑\ni\n− log(pm(ei|F, e i−1 1 ; θ)).\nSpecifically, we use the ADAM optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014), with an initial learning rate of 0.001. Minibatches of 2048 words are created by sorting sentences in descending order of length and grouping sentences sequentially, adding sentences to the minibatch until the next sentence would cause the minibatch size to exceed 2048 words.1 Gradients are clipped so their norm does not exceed 5.\nTraining is allowed to run, checking the likelihood of the development set periodically (every 250k sentences processed), and the model that achieves the best likelihood on the development set is saved. Once no improvements on the development set have been observed for 2M training sentences, training is stopped, and re-started using the previously saved model with a halved learning rate 0.0005. Once training converges for a learning rate of 0.0005, the same procedure is performed with a learning rate of 0.00025, resulting in the final model."

      "heading" : "2.3 Search",
      "text" : "At test time, to find the best-scoring translation, we perform beam search with a beam size of 5. At each step of beam search, the best-scoring hypothesis remaining in the beam that ends with the sentence-end symbol is saved. At the point where the highest-scoring hypothesis in the beam has a probability less than or equal to the best sentence-ending hypothesis, search is terminated and the best sentence-ending hypothesis is output as the translation.\nIn addition, because NMT models often tend to be biased towards shorter sentences, we add an optional “word penalty” λ, where each hypothesis’s probability is multiplied by eλ|E\n′| for comparison with other hypotheses of different lengths. This is equivalent to adding an exponential prior probability on the length of output sentences, and if λ > 0, then this will encourage the decoder to find longer hypotheses."

      "heading" : "3 Incorporating Discrete Lexicons",
      "text" : "The first modification that we make to the base model is incorporating discrete lexicons to improve translation probabilities, according to the method of Arthur et al. (2016). The motivation behind this method is twofold:\nHandling low-frequency words: Neural machine translation systems tend to have trouble translating low-frequency words (Sutskever et al., 2014), so incorporating translation lexicons with good coverage of content words could improve translation accuracy of these words.\nTraining speed: Training the alignments needed for discrete lexicons can be done efficiently (Dyer et al., 2013), and by seeding the neural MT system with these efficiently trained alignments it is easier to learn models that achieve good results more quickly.\nThe model starts with lexical translation probabilities pl(e|f) for individual words, which have been obtained through traditional word alignment methods. These probabilities must first be converted to a form that can be used together with pm(ei|e i−1 1\n, F ). Given input sentence F , we can construct a matrix in which each column corresponds to a word in the input sentence, each row corresponds to a word in the VE , and the entry corresponds to the appropriate lexical probability:\nLF =\n\n  pl(e = 1|f1) · · · pl(e = 1|f|F |) ... . . . ...\npl(e = |Ve||f1) · · · pl(e = |Ve||f|F |)\n\n  .\n1It should be noted that it is more common to create minibatches with a fixed number of sentences. We use words here because the amount of memory used in processing a minibatch is more closely related to the number of words in the minibatch than the number of sentences, and thus fixing the size of the minibatch based on the number of words leads to more stable memory usage between minibatches.\nThis matrix can be precomputed during the encoding stage because it only requires information about the source sentence F .\nNext we convert this matrix into a predictive probability over the next word: pl(ei|F, e i−1 1\n). To do so we use the alignment probability a from Equation (6) to weight each column of the LF matrix:\npl(ei|F, e i−1 1 ) = LFai =\n\n  pl(e = 1|f1) · · · plex(e = 1|f|F |) ... . . . ...\npl(e = Ve|f1) · · · plex(e = Ve|f|F |)\n\n \n\n  ai,1 ...\nai,|F |\n\n  .\nThis calculation is similar to the way how attentional models calculate the context vector ci, but over a vector representing the probabilities of the target vocabulary, instead of the distributed representations of the source words.\nAfter calculating the lexicon predictive probability pl(ei|e i−1 1\n, F ), next we need to integrate this probability with the NMT model probability pm(ei|e i−1 1\n, F ). Specifically, we use pl(·) to bias the probability distribution calculated by the vanilla NMT model by adding a small constant ǫ to pl(·), taking the logarithm, and adding this adjusted log probability to the input of the softmax as follows:\npb(ei|F, e i−1 1 ) = softmax(Wsηi + bs + log(pl(ei|F, e i−1 1 ) + ǫ)).\nWe take the logarithm of pl(·) so that the values will still be in the probability domain after the softmax is calculated, and add the hyper-parameter ǫ to prevent zero probabilities from becoming −∞ after taking the log. We test various values including ǫ = {10−4, 10−5, 10−6} in experiments."

      "heading" : "4 Minimum Risk Training",
      "text" : "The second improvement that we make to our model is the use of minimum risk training. As mentioned in Section 2.2 our baseline model optimizes the model parameters according to maximize the likelihood of the training data. However, there is a disconnect between the evaluation of our systems using translation accuracy (such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)) and this maximum likelihood objective.\nTo remove this disconnect, we use the method of Shen et al. (2016) to optimize our systems directly using BLEU score. Specifically, we define the following loss function over the model parameters θ for a single training sentence pair 〈F,E〉\nLF,E(θ) = ∑\nE′\nerr(E,E′)P (E′|F ; θ),\nwhich is summed over all potential translations E′ in the target language. Here err(·) can be an arbitrary error function, which we define as 1 − SBLEU(E,E′), where SBLEU(·) is the smoothed BLEU score (BLEU+1) proposed by Lin and Och (2004). As the number of target-language translations E′ is infinite, the sum above is intractable, so we approximate the sum by randomly sampling a subset of translations S according to P (E|F ; θ), then enumerating over this sample:2\nLF,E(θ) = ∑\nE′∈S\nerr(E,E′) P (E′|F ; θ)∑\nE′′∈S P (E ′′|F ; θ)\n.\nThis objective function is then modified by introducing a scaling factor α, which makes it possible to adjust the smoothness of the distribution being optimized, which in turn results in adjusting the strength with which the model will try to push good translations to have high probabilities.\nLF,E(θ) = ∑\nE′∈S\nerr(E,E′) P (E′|F ; θ)α∑\nE′′∈S P (E ′′|F ; θ)α\n.\nIn this work, we set α = 0.005 following the original paper, and set the number of samples to be 20.\n2The actual procedure for obtaining a sample consists of calculating the probability of the first word P (e1|F ), sampling the first word from this multinomial, and then repeating for each following word until the end of sentence symbol is sampled."

In addition, we can see that after minimum risk, the model produces hypotheses that are more-or-less appropriate length without using a word penalty, an additional benefit.\nEnsemble: As widely reported in previous work, ensembling together multiple models greatly improved performance."

This system achieved a manual evaluation score of 47.50, which was slightly higher than other systems participating in the task. In addition, while the full results of the minimum-risk-based ensemble were not ready in time for the manual evaluation stage, a preliminary system ensembling the minimum-risktrained versions of the first four systems (1)-(4) in Table 1 was also evaluated (its BLEU/RIBES scores were comparable to the fully ensembled ML-trained system), and received a score of 48.25, the best in the task, albeit by a small margin."

As a result, our system achieved the highest translation evaluation scores for the task.",
