Timeline generation [3, 10, 38, 40] gives an ideal solution to this problem by providing readers with a faster and better access to understand news.\nTimeline generation for an evolving topic cares for not only the salience, but also the novelty and evolutionary process of the events. In this paper, we focus on extractive approach for timeline generation, which tries to select desired sentences from news corpus. There are two main challenges for long-term timeline generation. First, for extractive methods, we want to select the sentences that can best generalize topics at each time, so how to model information hidden within the news corpus becomes important. As for long-term event, one main topic is usually described from various specific aspects and each aspect has its own evolutionary pattern. For example, the news about “Greek Debtgovernment Crisis“ may involve different sub-events such as “the cause of debt crisis“, “Greek public protests“, “Rescue packages“ while each of them contains different stages. Detecting such hierarchical structure is important for later sentence selection. Second, it is very common that the themes of a corpus evolve over time, and thus topics of adjacent time epochs usually exhibit strong correlations. How to incorporate time dependency into the hierarchical structure is also a hard problem.\nThe problem of timelime generation was firstly proposed by Allan et al.[27] by extracting clusters of noun phases and name entities. Later they built up a system to provide timelines which consist of one sentence per date by considering usefulness and novelty[3]. Chieu et al.[10] built a similar system in unit of sentences with interest and burstiness. However, these methods seldom explored the evolutionary characteristics of news. Recently, Yan et al.[38] extended the graph based sentence ranking algorithm used in traditional multi-document summarization (MDS) to timeline generation by projecting sentences from different times into one plane. They further explored the timeline task from the optimization of a function by considering the combination of different respects such as relevance, coverage, coherence and diversity[40]. Time dependency is considered in Yan et al’s work[38, 40]. However, their approaches treat timeline generation as a sentence ranking or optimization problem and seldom explore the topic information lied within the corpus or the structure of news information.\nTopic detection or mining is not a new task and many algorithms have been proposed in TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) task[11, 13], or summarization task[32, 18]. Among existing approaches, topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)[6] or Hierarchical Dirichlet Pro-\nar X\niv :1\n31 2.\n22 44\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n8 D\nec 2\n01 3\ncesses (HDP) have their advantages [29] in capturing latent topics within document collection due its clear probabilistic interpretions.\nAs we get back to the two challenges previously discussed, we find that topic models show promising properties to to handle them: First, Blei et al. [15] introduced a hLDA model which organizes topics into a tree structure with depth L. Topics located close to each other in the tree tend to share a similar topic-word distribution and the children of a certain node tend to be treated as subtopics talking about minor aspects. Such tree structure can well help model the hierarchical topic structure in the long term event. One major problem hLDA is that LDA based models require users to specify a cluster number at each time epoch for each corpus, which is awkward in real case. In addition, the timedependent nature of new corpus data can not be addressed in hLDA model. Second, to deal with time-correlated data, many approaches have been proposed based on topic approaches, aiming to discover the evolving patterns in the corpus as well as the snapshot topics at each time epoch [1, 2, 5, 9, 24, 25, 28, 33, 42].\nIn this paper, we develop a novel topic approach denoted as time-dependent Hierarchical Dirichlet Model (HDM) for timeline generation. Our HDM model can be viewed as an extended combination of hLDA and multi-level timecorrelated Dirichlet Process (DP) and tries to model the topic distribution in a hierarchical tree structure. Such structure is famed as a time-correlated Dirichlet process in both horizontal (how many children does a node have) and vertical (how deep is the tree) direction. We approach HDM by specifying a generative probabilistic model for hierarchical structure and taking a Bayesian perspective on the problem of learning the tree structure automatically from the data. The non-parametric nature of DP means that we do not have to know a priori the number of topics or depth as they will readily accommodates growing data collections. From that structure, we can clearly identify the evolution pattern of different aspects involved in the event by locating the topic position in the tree and further, based on that, we construct a timeline ranking framework by considering the relevance, coherence and coverage of each sentence. We build an experimental system on 8 real long-term events that public concern. The effectiveness of model is verified through ROUGE matrix.\nThe rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes related work. Section 3 briefly illustrates Dirichlet Process (DP) and Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP). The details of HDM is shown in Section 4. We present experimental results in Section 5 and conclude this paper in Section 6."

      "text" : "Timeline Generation. The task of timeline generation is firstly proposed by Swan and Allan[27] by using named entities for sentence selection in different time epochs. Since then, researchers tried to generate timeline by considering different respects such as usefulness and novelty[3] or interest and burstiness[10]. Yan et al.[39] extended the graph based sentence ranking algorithm in multi-document summarization (MDS) to timeline generation by projecting sentences from different temporal corpus into one plane. Another work from Yan et al.[38] transforms\nthis task to an optimization problem by considering the relevance, coverage and coherence of the sentences. Existing approaches seldom explore the topic information lied in the corpus or the structure of news information. Li et al [17] exploited topic model to capture the dynamic evolution of topics in timeline generation.\nTopic Models. Recently, bayesian topic models such as LDA[6] or HDP[29] have shown the power text mining for its clear probabilistic interpretation. In topic model, each document is denoted as a mixture of different topics and each topic is presented as a distribution over words. hLDA [15] extends LDA model to a multi-level tree structure where each node is associated with a topic distribution over words. It can be inferred from a nested Chinese restaurant process based one MCMC strategy. HDP can be used as an LDA-based topic model where the number of clusters can be automatically inferred from data. Therefore, HDP is more practical when users have little knowledge about the content to be analyzed.\nLearning from time-correlated corpus. Learning evolutionary topics from a time-correlated corpus aims to preserve the smoothness of clustering results over time, while fitting the data of each epoch [1, 8, 9, 19, 36, 37]. Among exsting works, the approaches in [1, 37, 36] utilized time-dependent DP for topic modeling, while others focused on extending LDA to dynamic topic models [5, 31, 33] . In fact, incorporating time dependencies into DP mixture models is a hot topic in the research of Bayesian nonparametric [7, 22, 24, 34, 42]. For instance, Wang et al. [34] focused on detecting the simultaneous busting of some topics in multiple text streams. Zhang et al. [35] further extended [34] where they adjusted the timestamps of all documents to synchronize multiple streams and then learned a common topic model. Wang et al. [42] introduced an approach based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Process [29] to discover interesting cluster evolutionary pattern from correlated time-varying text corpora."

      "text" : "Dirichlet Process(DP) can be considered as a distribution over distributions[12]. A DP denoted by DP (α,G0) is parameterized by a base measure G0 and a concentration parameter. We write G ∼ DP (α,G0) for a draw of distribution G from the Dirichlet process. G itself is a distribution over a given parameter space θ, therefore we can draw parameters θ1:N from G following a Polya urn distribution [4] also known as a Chinese Restaurant process [29] or through a stick breaking construction [26]. Under the framework of Gibbes sampling, we have:\nθi|θ1:i−1, G0, α ∼ ∑ k mk i− 1 + αδ(φk) +\nα\ni− 1 + αG0 (1)\nwhere φ1:k denotes the distinct values among parameter θ and mk is the number of parameters θ having value φk.\nAs for HDP, we model each document as a DP and each word w in document d will be associated with a topic sampled from the random Gd, where Gd ∼ DP (α,G0). The random measure Gd represents the document-specific mixing vector over infinite number of topics. In HDP, the document specific measures Gd are tied together by modeling the\nbase measure G0 itself as a random measure sampled from DP (γ,H).\nHDP model can be more easily explained from the Chinese Restaurant Process metaphor. where each document is referred to a restaurant and words are compared to customers. Customers in the restaurant sit around different tables and each table b is associated with a dish (topic) φb according to the dish menu. To associate a topic with customer w, we proceed as follows: In restaurant d, the customer can sit on table bdb that has ndb with probability ndb u−1+α and shares the dish φdb or picks a new table b new with probability α i−1+α . If he chooses a new table, he has to order a dish for that table from the global menu. A dish φk that is served at mk across all the restaurants is ordered from the global menu with probability mk∑\nk′ mk′+γ , or a new dish knew\nthat has never been served in any restaurant with probability γ∑\nk′ mk′+γ and φnew ∼ H.

      "heading" : "4.2 HDM",
      "text" : "HDM can be viewed as an extension of Hierarchical LDA model [15] where we wish to discover common usage patterns (or topics) given a collection of documents and try to organize these topics into a hierarchy. However, HDM is different from hLDA for its non-parametric nature and capability of modeling time-correlated data.\nHDM can be better explained from a Chinese restaurant perspective. There are a series of restaurants in the city and each restaurant is associated with a restaurant-specific dish menu. Such menu is drawn from a global dish menu shared across all restaurants in the whole city. In each restaurant, there are infinite number of tables. When a customer comes\ninto the restaurant, he would choose a table and a dish according the local restaurant dish menu. An demonstration of restaurant menu is illustrated in Figure 3. From Figure 3, we observe that the Chinese restaurant interpretation for HDM is different from other topic models such as LDA, HDP and sLDA in that the dishes in the menu are organized as a hierarchical tree structure. The intuitive idea for the construction of such menu is that it can be used to represent the hierarchical topic structure in the corpus. For instance, the route of meat → pork→ tenderloin → grilled tenderloin can be compared to the hierarchical structure of topic → subtopic → three-level topic → forth-level topic described in Section 1, say Greek crisis → Greek public protests → Indignant Citizens Movement → people get killed.\nThere is a pool of dishes H, from which the everyday city dish menu Gt is drawn, where t denotes the index of the day. It is worth noting that the global dish menu changes each day in that residents in the city are fed up with having the same dishes every day. Another thing to mention is residents in the town would preserve part of dishes they already had yesterday on today’s menu since some of them are so delicious and they want to have them again. So Gt, which denotes the city dish menu for day t is drawn from the combination of base menu H and yesterday’s menu Gt−1 as follows:\nGt ∼ DP (α, F (∆)Gt−1 + (1− F (∆))H) (4)\nwhere F (∆) = exp(−∆/λ), and it controls the influence of neighboring data. λ is the decay factor of the time-decaying kernel. Such theme has been introduced in a couple of previous works which try to address time dependency in timecorrelated data [1, 2, 24, 42].\nEach restaurant has its own specific menu, which is drawn from that day’s global menu Gt with G i t ∼ DP (γ,Gt). For each day, the customer would enter a restaurant and choose a dish according to the restaurant dish menu Git, where i denotes the index of the restaurant. First, he would decide the table he would sit at according to the dish served at that table. Since the customer is indecisive, he can not specifically figure out what he wants to eat immediately, but can tell the category of food he wants, say meat or fish (See Figure 3). So he first chooses from pizza, meat or fish according to HDP model, shown in Section 2. If he decides to have meat today, he would further decide what kind of meat he would like to have, turkey, chicken or pork, also according to HDP algorithm. Such process goes on and on until he finally get to the end of menu. It is worth noting that, the costumer\nis a bit critical since he may not feel like having any type of dish (or sub-dishes) appeared on the restaurant menu. If that is the case, the servant would give him the city menu Gt, letting him choose and then again base menu H if he is still not satisfied. The problem is, sometimes the customer is so critical that even the global menu H can not satisfy him. In that case, the cook in the restaurant would invent a new kind of meat (if he already decided to have meat) or a new cooking method for tenderloin (if he already decided to have tenderloin) and then add this newly invented dish to the menu list.\nGetting back to our data, each sentence is compared to customer in the Chinese Restaurant metaphor1, document to restaurant and document collection at each time to restaurants at that day. For each sentence s, it is linked with a vector of dish (topic) θ1, θ2, ..., θs. θl l ∈ [1, s] is drawn successively from Git given θl−1. In Chinese restaurant metaphor, θ1 can be compared to meat, θ2 to pork, θ3 to tenderloin and so on. The plate diagram and generative story for our model are given in Figure 4 and Figure 5."

Besides stemming and stop-word removal, we also extract text snippets with the toolkit provided by Yan et al.[39]. Then we compress the corpus by discarding non-events texts. Timeline for each day is truncated to the same length of 30 words.\nPost-precessing: Since timeline candidates are extracted directly from original news corpus, sentences tend to contain less meaningful information and are sometimes redundant for readers to read.

Our model aptly combines Dirichlet Tree with Dirichlet Processes and can automatically learns the structure of trees across corpus. Different levels of Markovian time dependency and background information are considered for tree structure construction. We build an experimental system on 8 real long-term events that public concern. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed model."

    "abstractText" : "Timeline Generation aims at summarizing news from different epochs and telling readers how an event evolves. It is a new challenge that combines salience ranking with novelty detection. For long-term public events, the main topic usually includes various aspects across different epochs and each aspect has its own evolving pattern. Existing approaches neglect such hierarchical topic structure involved in the news corpus in timeline generation. In this paper, we develop a novel time-dependent Hierarchical Dirichlet Model (HDM) for timeline generation. Our model can aptly detect different levels of topic information across corpus and such structure is further used for sentence selection. Based on the topic mined fro HDM, sentences are selected by considering different aspects such as relevance, coherence and coverage. We develop experimental systems to evaluate 8 long-term events that public concern. Performance comparison between different systems demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in terms of ROUGE metrics.",
