      "text" : "The sentiment of the word soft varies drastically between an online community dedicated to sports and one dedicated to toy animals (Figure 1). Terrific once had a highly negative connotation; now it is essentially synonomous with good (Figure 2).\nInducing domain-specific sentiment lexicons is crucial to computational social science (CSS) research. Sentiment lexicons allow researchers to an-\nalyze key subjective properties of texts, such as user opinions and emotional attitudes (Taboada et al., 2011). However, without domain-specific lexicons, analyses can be misled by sentiment assignments that are biased towards domain-general contexts and that fail to take into account community-specific vernacular or demographic variations in language use (Hovy, 2015; Yang and Eisenstein, 2015).\nExperts or crowdsourced annotators can be used to construct sentiment lexicons for a specific domain, but these efforts are expensive and timeconsuming (Mohammad and Turney, 2010; Fast et al., 2016). Crowdsourcing is especially problematic when the domain involves very non-standard language (e.g., historical documents or obscure social media forums), since in these cases annotators must understand the sociolinguistic context of the data.\nRecent work has shown that web-scale sentiment lexicons can be automatically induced for large socially-diffuse domains, such as the internet-atlarge (Velikovich et al., 2010) or all of Twitter (Tang\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n02 82\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nJ un\n2 01\net al., 2014). However, in cases where researchers want to analyze the sentiment of domain-specific language—such as in financial documents, historical texts, or tight-knit social media forums—it is not enough to simply use generic crowdsourced or webscale lexicons. Generic lexicons will not only be inaccurate in specific domains, they may mislead research by introducing harmful biases (Loughran and McDonald, 2011)1. Researchers need a principled and accurate framework for inducing lexicons that are specific to their domain of study.\nTo meet this need, we introduce SENTPROP, a framework to learn accurate sentiment lexicons from small sets of seed words and domain-specific corpora. Unlike previous approaches, SENTPROP is designed to maintain accurate performance when using modestly-sized domain-specific corpora (∼107 tokens), and it provides confidence scores along with the learned lexicons, which allows researchers to quantify uncertainty in a principled manner.\nThe key contributions of this work are:\n1. A state-of-the-art sentiment induction algorithm, combining high-quality word vector embeddings with an intuitive label propagation approach.\n2. A novel bootstrap-sampling framework for inferring confidence scores with the sentiment values.\n3. Two large-scale studies that reveal how sentiment depends on both social and historical context. (a) We induce community-specific sentiment lexicons for the largest 250 “subreddit” communities on the social-media forum Reddit, revealing substantial variation in word sentiment between communities. (b) We induce historical sentiment lexicons for 150 years of English, revealing that >5% of words switched polarity during this time.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze the domain-dependency of sentiment at a large-scale, across hundreds of years and hundreds of user-defined online communities.\nAll of the inferred lexicons along with code for SENTPROP and all methods evaluated are made available in the SOCIALSENT package released with this paper.2\n1 http://brandsavant.com/brandsavant/\nthe-hidden-bias-of-social-media-sentiment-analysis 2http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/socialsent"

      "text" : "Our work builds upon a wealth of previous research on inducing sentiment lexicons, along two threads:\nCorpus-based approaches use seed words and patterns in unlabeled corpora to induce domainspecific lexicons. These patterns may rely on syntactic structures (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Jijkoun et al., 2010; Rooth et al., 1999), which can be domain-specific and brittle (e.g., in social media lacking usual grammatical structures). Other models rely on general cooccurrence (Turney and Littman, 2003; Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Igo and Riloff, 2009). Often corpus-based methods exploit distant-supervision signals (e.g., review scores, emoticons) specific to certain domains (Asghar et al., 2015; BlairGoldensohn et al., 2008; Bravo-Marquez et al., 2015; Choi and Cardie, 2009; Severyn and Moschitti, 2015; Speriosu et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2014). An effective corpus-based approach that does not require distant-supervision—which we adapt here—is to construct lexical graphs using word cooccurrences and then to perform some form of label propagation over these graphs (Huang et al., 2014; Velikovich et al., 2010). Recent work has also learned transformations of word-vector representations in order to induce sentiment lexicons (Rothe et al., 2016). Fast et al. (2016) combine word vectors with crowdsourcing to produce domain-general topic lexicons.\nDictionary-based approaches use hand-curated lexical resources—usually WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)—in order to propagate sentiment from seed labels (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kamps et al., 2004; Rao and Ravichandran,\n2009; San Vicente et al., 2014; Takamura et al., 2005; Tai and Kao, 2013). There is an implicit consensus that dictionary-based approaches will generate higher-quality lexicons, due to their use of these clean, hand-curated resources; however, they are not applicable in domains lacking such a resource (e.g., most historical texts).\nMost previous work seeks to enrich or enlarge existing lexicons (San Vicente et al., 2014; Velikovich et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2009), emphasizing recall over precision. This recall-oriented approach is motivated by the need for massive polarity lexicons in tasks like web-advertising (Velikovich et al., 2010). In contrast to these previous efforts, the goal of this work is to induce high-quality lexicons that are accurate to a specific social context.\nAlgorithmically, our approach is inspired by Velikovich et al. (2010). We extend this work by incorporating high-quality word vector embeddings, a new graph construction approach, an alternative label propagation algorithm, and a bootstrapping method to obtain confidences. Together these improvements, especially the high-quality word vectors, allow our corpus-based method to even outperform the state-of-the-art dictionary-based approach."

Interpretable: Uses small seed sets of\n“paradigm” words to maintain interpretability and avoid ambiguity in sentiment values. 3. Robust: Bootstrap-sampled standard deviations provide a measure of confidence. 4. Out-of-the-box: Does not rely on signals that are specific to only certain domains.\nSENTPROP involves two steps: constructing a lexical graph from unlabeled corpora and propagating sentiment labels over this graph."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.1 Constructing a lexical graph",
      "text" : "Lexical graphs are constructed from distributional word embeddings learned on unlabeled corpora.\nDistributional word embeddings The first step in our approach is building highquality semantic representations for words using a vector space model (VSM). We embed each word wi ∈ V as a vector wi that captures information about its co-occurrence statistics with other words (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Turney and Pantel, 2010). This VSM approach has a long history in NLP and has been highly successful in recent applications (see Levy et al., 2015 for a survey).\nWhen recreating known lexicons, we used a number of publicly available embeddings (Section 4).\nIn the cases where we learned embeddings ourselves, we employed an SVD-based method to construct the word-vectors. First, we construct a matrix MPPMI ∈ R|V|×|V| with entries given by\nMPPMIi,j = max\n{ log ( p̂(wi, wj)\np̂(w)p̂(wj)\n) , 0 } , (1)\nwhere p̂ denotes smoothed empirical probabilities of word (co-)occurrences within fixed-size sliding windows of text.3 MPPMIi,j is equal to a smoothed variant of the positive pointwise mutual information between words wi and wj (Levy et al., 2015). Next, we compute MPPMI = UΣV>, the truncated singular value decomposition of MPPMI . The vector embedding for word wi is then given by\nwSVDi = (U)i . (2) 3We use contexts of size four on each side and context-\ndistribution smoothing with c = 0.75 (Levy et al., 2015).\nExcluding the singular value weights, Σ, has been shown known to dramatically improve embedding qualities (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Bullinaria and Levy, 2012). Following standard practices, we learn embeddings of dimension 300.\nWe found that this SVD method significantly outperformed word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) on the domainspecific datasets we examined. Our results echo the findings of Levy et al. (2015) that the SVD approach performs best on rare word similarity tasks.\nDefining the graph edges Given a set of word embeddings, a weighted lexical graph is constructed by connecting each word with its nearest k neighbors within the semantic space (according to cosine-similarity). The weights of the edges are set as\nEi,j = arccos\n( − wi\n>wj ‖wi‖‖wj‖\n) . (3)"
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.2 Propagating polarities from a seed set",
      "text" : "Once a weighted lexical graph is constructed, we propagate sentiment labels over this graph using a random walk method (Zhou et al., 2004). A word’s polarity score for a seed set is proportional to the probability of a random walk from the seed set hitting that word.\nLet p ∈ R|V| be a vector of word-sentiment scores constructed using seed set S (e.g., ten negative words); p is initialized to have 1|V| in all entries. And let E be the matrix of edge weights given by equation (3). First, we construct a symmetric transition matrix from E by computing T = D 1 2 ED 1 2 , where D is a matrix with the column sums of E on the diagonal. Next, using T we iteratively update p until numerical convergence:\np(t+1) = βTp(t) + (1− β)s, (4)\nwhere s is a vector with values set to 1|S| in the entries corresponding to the seed set S and zeros elsewhere. The β term controls the extent to which the algorithm favors local consistency (similar labels for neighbors) vs. global consistency (correct labels on seed words), with lower βs emphasizing the latter.\nTo obtain a final polarity score for a word wi, we run the walk using both positive and negative\nseed sets, obtaining positive (pP (wi)) and negative (pN (wi)) label scores. We then combine these values into a positive-polarity score as p̄P (wi) =\npP (wi) pP (wi)+pN (wi)\nand standardize the final scores to have zero mean and unit variance (within a corpus).\nMany variants of this random walk approach and related label propagation techniques exist in the literature (Zhou et al., 2004; Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Zhu et al., 2003; Velikovich et al., 2010; San Vicente et al., 2014). We experimented with a number of these approaches and found little difference between their performance, so we present only this random walk approach here. The SOCIALSENT package contains a full suite of these methods."

      "text" : "Propagated sentiment scores are inevitably influenced by the seed set, and it is important for researchers to know the extent to which polarity values are simply the result of corpus artifacts that are correlated with these seeds words. We address this issue by using a bootstrap-sampling approach to obtain confidence regions over our sentiment scores. We bootstrap by running our propagation over B random equally-sized subsets of the positive and negative seed sets. Computing the standard deviation of the bootstrap-sampled polarity scores provides a measure of confidence and allows the researcher to evaluate the robustness of the assigned polarities. We set B = 50 and used 7 words per random subset (full seed sets are size 10; see Table 1)."

Table 1 lists the seed words used in each domain.\nStandard English: To facilitate comparison with previous work, we focus on the well-known General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966). We also use the continuous valence (i.e., polarity) scores collected by Warriner et al. (2013) in order to evaluate the fine-grained performance of our framework. We test our framework’s performance using two different embeddings: off-the-shelf Google news embeddings constructed from 1011 tokens4 and embeddings we\n4https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/\nconstructed from the 2000s decade of the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), which contains ∼2 × 107 words in each decade, from 1850 to 2000 (Davies, 2010). The COHA corpus allows us to test how the algorithms deal with this smaller historical corpus, which is important since we will use the COHA corpus to infer historical sentiment lexicons (Section 6).\nFinance: Previous work found that general purpose sentiment lexicons performed very poorly on financial text (Loughran and McDonald, 2011), so a finance-specific sentiment lexicon (containing binary labels) was hand-constructed for this domain (ibid.). To test against this lexicon, we constructed embeddings using a dataset of∼2×107 tokens from financial 8K documents (Lee et al., 2014).\nTwitter: Numerous works attempt to induce Twitter-specific sentiment lexicons using supervised approaches and features unique to that domain (e.g., follower graphs; Speriosu et al., 2011). Here, we emphasize that we can induce an accurate lexicon using a simple domain-independent and resourcelight approach, with the implication that lexicons can easily be induced for related social media domains without resorting to complex supervised frameworks. We evaluate our approach using the test set from the 2015 SemEval task 10E competition (Rosenthal et al., 2015), and we use the embeddings constructed by Rothe et al. (2016).5"

It is well known that there is substantial sociolinguistic variation between different communities, whether these communities are defined geographically (Trudgill, 1974) or via underlying sociocultural differences (Labov, 2006). However, no previous work has systematically investigated community-specific variation in word sentiment at a large scale. Yang and Eisenstein (2015) exploit social network structures in Twitter to infer a small number (1-10) of communities and analyzed sentiment variation via a supervised framework. Our analysis extends this line of work by analyzing the sentiment across hundreds of user-defined commu-\nnities using only unlabeled corpora and a small set of “paradigm” seed words (the Twitter seed words outlined in Table 1).\nIn our study, we induced sentiment lexicons for the top-250 (by comment-count) subreddits from the social media forum Reddit.7 We used all the 2014 comment data to induce the lexicons, with words lower cased and comments from bots and deleted users removed.8 Sentiment was induced for the top5000 non-stop words in each subreddit (again, by comment-frequency)."

We see that the distribution is noticeably skewed, with many community pairs having highly uncorrelated sentiment values. The 1000 random pairs were selected such that each member of the pair overlapped in at least half of their top-5000 word vocabulary. We then computed the correlation between the sentiments in these community-pairs. Since sentiment is noisy and relatively uninteresting for neutral words, we compute τ25%, the Kendall-τ correlation over the top25% most sentiment bearing words shared between the two communities.\nAnalysis of individual pairs reveals some interesting insights about sentiment and inter-community dynamics. For example, we found that the sentiment correlation between r/TwoX and r/TheRedPill\n(τ25% = 0.58), two communities that hold conflicting views and often attack each other9, was actually higher than the sentiment correlation between r/TwoX and r/sports (τ25% = 0.41), two communities that are entirely unrelated.

Such lexicons are crucial to the growing body of work on NLP analyses of historical text (Piotrowski, 2012) which are informing diachronic linguistics (Hamilton et al., 2016), the digital humanities (Muralidharan and Hearst, 2012), and history (Hendrickx et al., 2011).\nThe only previous work on automatically inducing historical sentiment lexicons is Cook and Stevenson (2010); they use the PMI method and\n9This conflict is well-known on Reddit; for example, both communities mention each others’ names along with fuck-based profanity in the same comment far more than one would expect by chance (χ21 > 6.8, p < 0.01 for both). r/TheRedPill is dedicated to male empowerment.\na full modern sentiment lexicon as their seed set, which problematically assumes that all these words have not changed in sentiment.

Figure 5b shows an example pejoration, where pathetic, which used to be more synonymous with passionate, gained stronger negative associations with the concepts of “weakness” and “inadequacy” (Simpson et al., 1989).

However, we believe that these user-constructed, domain-specific lexicons, which quantify uncertainty, provide a more principled foundation for CSS research compared to domain-general sentiment lexicons that contain unknown biases. In the future our method could also be integrated with supervised domain-adaption (e.g.,Yang and Eisenstein, 2015) to further improve these domain-specific results."
