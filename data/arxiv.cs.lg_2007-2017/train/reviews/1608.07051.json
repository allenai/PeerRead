Suggested solutions include various approaches of points-of-interest (POI) recommendation and route planning. We consider the task of recommending a sequence of POIs, that simultaneously uses information about POIs and routes. Our approach unifies the treatment of various sources of information by representing them as features in machine learning algorithms, enabling us to learn from past behaviour. Information about POIs are used to learn a POI ranking model that accounts for the start and end points of tours. Data about previous trajectories are used for learning transition patterns between POIs that enable us to recommend probable routes. In addition, a probabilistic model is proposed to combine the results of POI ranking and the POI to POI transitions. We propose a new F$_1$ score on pairs of POIs that capture the order of visits. Empirical results show that our approach improves on recent methods, and demonstrate that combining points and routes enables better trajectory recommendations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 08:39:47 GMT  (599kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07051v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["dawei chen", "cheng soon ong", "lexing xie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.07051"}
