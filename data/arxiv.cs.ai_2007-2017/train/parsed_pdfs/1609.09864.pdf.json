      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, structured sparse methods have attracted much attention in many domains such as bioinformatics, medical imaging, social networks, and astronomy [2], [4], [14], [16], [17]. Structured sparse methods have been shown effective to identify latent patterns in high-dimensional data via the integration of prior knowledge about the structure of the patterns of interest, and at the same time remain a mathematically tractable concept. A number of structured sparsity models have been well explored, such as the sparsity models defined through trees [14], groups [17], clusters [16], and paths [2]. The generic optimization problem based on a structured sparsity model has the form\nmin x∈Rn\nf(x) s.t. supp(x) ∈M (1)\nwhere f : Rn → R is a differentiable cost function, the sparsity model M is defined as a family of structured supports: M = {S1, S2, · · · , SL}, where Si ⊆ [n] satisfies a certain structure property (e.g., trees, groups, clusters), [n] =\n{1, 2, · · · , n}, and the support set supp(x) refers to the set of indexes of non-zero entries in x. For example, the popular k-sparsity model is defined as M = {S ⊆ [n] | |S| ≤ k}.\nExisting structured sparse methods fall into two main categories: 1) Sparsity-inducing norms based. The methods in this category explore structured sparsity models (e.g., trees, groups, clusters, and paths) [4] that can be encoded as structured sparsity-inducing norms, and reformulate Problem (1) as a convex (or non-convex) optimization problem\nminx∈Rn f(x) + λ · Ω(x) (2) where Ω(x) is a structured sparsity-inducing norm of M that is typically non-smooth and non-Euclidean and λ is a trade-off parameter. 2) Model-projection based. The methods in this category rely on a projection oracle of M:\nP(b) = arg minx∈Rn ‖b− x‖22 s.t. supp(x) ∈M, (3) and decompose the problem into two sub-problems, including unconstrained minimization of f(x) and the projection problem P(b). Most of the methods in this category assume that the projection problem P(b) can be solved exactly, including the forward-backward algorithm [42], the gradient descent algorithm [38], the gradient hard-thresholding algorithms [6], [18], [40], the projected iterative hard thresholding [5], [7], and the Newton greedy pursuit algorithm [41]. However, when an exact solver of P(b) is unavailable and we have to apply approximate projections, the theoretical guarantees of these methods do not hold any more. We note that there is one recent approach named as GRAPH-COSAMP that admits inexact projections by assuming “head” and “tail” oracles for the projections, but is only applicable to compressive sensing or linear regression problems [15].\nWe consider an underlying graph G = (V,E) defined on the coefficients of the unknown vector x, where V = [n] and E ⊆ V × V. We focus on the sparsity model of connected subgraphs that is defined as\nM(G, k) = {S ⊆ V | |S| ≤ k, S is connected}, (4) where k refers to the allowed maximum subgraph size. There are a wide array of applications that involve the search of interesting or anomalous connected subgraphs in networks. The connectivity constraint ensures that subgraphs reflect changes due to localized in-network processes. We describe\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n09 86\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n3 0\nSe p\n20 16\na few applications below.\n• Detection in sensor networks, e.g., detection of traffic bottlenecks in road networks or airway networks [1]; crime hot spots in geographic networks [22]; and pollutions in water distribution networks [27]. • Detection in digital signals and images, e.g., detection of objects in images [15]. • Disease outbreak detection, e.g., early detection of disease outbreaks from information networks incorporating data from hospital emergency visits, ambulance dispatch calls and pharmacy sales of over-the-counter drugs [36]. • Virus detection in a computer network, e.g., detection of viruses or worms spreading from host to host in a computer network [24]. • Detection in genome-scale interaction network, e.g., detection of significantly mutated subnetworks [21]. • Detection in social media networks, e.g., detection and forecasting of societal events [8], [9].\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no existing approach to Problem (1) for M(G, k) that is computationally tractable and provides performance bound. First, there is no known structured sparsity-inducing norm for M(G, k). The most relevant norm is fused lasso norm [39]: Ω(x) = ∑ (i,j)∈E |xi−xj |, where xi is the i-th entry in x. This norm is able to enforce the smoothness between neighboring entries in x, but has limited capability to recover all the possible connected subsets as described by M(G, k) (See further discussions in Section V Experiments). Second, there is no exact solver for the projection oracle of M(G, k):\nP(x) = arg min x∈Rn ‖b− x‖22 s.t. supp(x) ∈M(G, k), (5) as this projection problem is NP-hard due to a reduction from classical Steiner tree problem [19]. As most existing modelprojection based methods require an exact solution to the projection oracle P(x), these methods are inapplicable to the problem studied here. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one recent approach named as GRAPH-COSAMP that admits inexact projections for M(G, k) by assuming “head” and “tail” oracles for the projections, but is only applicable to compression sensing and linear regression problems [15]. The main contributions of our study are summarized as follows:\n• Design of efficient approximation algorithms. Two new algorithms, namely, GRAPH-IHT and GRAPH-GHTP, are developed to approximately solve Problem (1) that has a differentiable cost function and a sparsity model of connected subgraphs M(G, k). GRAPH-GHTP is required to minimize f(x) over a projected subspace as an intermediate step, which could be too costly in some applications and GRAPH-IHT could be considered as a fast variant of GRAPH-GHTP. • Theoretical guarantees and connections. The convergence rate and accuracy of our proposed algorithms are analyzed under a smoothness condition of f(x) that is more general than popular conditions such as Restricted Strong Convexity/Smoothness (RSC/RSS) and Stable\nMode Restricted Hessian (SMRH). We prove that under mild conditions our proposed GRAPH-IHT and GRAPHGHTP enjoy rigorous theoretical guarantees. • Compressive experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed techniques. Both GRAPH-IHT and GRAPH-GHTP are applied to optimize a variety of graph scan statistic models for the connected subgraph detection task. Extensive experiments on a number of benchmark datasets demonstrate that GRAPHIHT and GRAPH-GHTP perform superior to state-of-theart methods that are designed specifically for this task in terms of subgraph quality and running time.\nReproducibility: The implementation of our algorithms and the data sets is open-sourced via the link [11].\nThe remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows. Sections II introduces the sparsity model of connected subgraphs and statement of the problem. Sections III presents two efficient algorithms and their theoretical analysis. Section IV discusses applications of our proposed algorithms to graph scan statistic models. Experiments on several real world benchmark datasets are presented in Section V. Section VI discusses related work and Section VII concludes the paper and describes future work."

The sparsity model of connected subgraphs in G is defined in (4), and its projection oracle P(x) is defined in (5). As this projection oracle is NP-hard to solve, we first introduce efficient approximation algorithms for P(x) and then present statement of the problem that will be studied in the paper.\nA. Approximation algorithms for the projection oracle P(x)\nThere are two nearly-linear time approximation algorithms [15] for P(x) that have the following properties: • Tail approximation (T(x)): Find a S ⊆ V such that\n‖x− xS‖2 ≤ cT · min S′∈M(G,kT ) ‖x− xS′‖2, (6)\nwhere cT = √\n7, kT = 5k, and xS is the restriction of x to indices in S: we have (xS)i = xi for i ∈ S and (xS)i = 0 otherwise.\n• Head approximation (H(x)): Find a S ⊆ V such that ‖xS‖2 ≥ cH · max\nS′∈M(G,kH) ‖xS′‖2, (7) where cH = √\n1/14 and kH = 2k. It can be readily proved that, if cT = cH = 1, then T(x) = H(x) = P(x), which indicates that these two approximations (T(x) and H(x)) stem from the fact that cT > 1 and cH < 1."

(8)\nProblem (8) is difficult to solve as it involves decision variables from a nonconvex set that is composed of many disjoint subsets. In this paper, we will develop nearly-linear time algorithms to approximately solve Problem (8). The key idea is decompose this problem to sub-problems that are easier to solve. These sub-problems include an optimization sub-problem of f(x) that is independent on M(G, k) and projection approximations for M(G, k), including T(x) and H(x). We will design efficient algorithms to couple these subproblems to obtain global solutions to Problem (8) with good trade-off on running time and accuracy."

      "text" : "This section first presents two efficient algorithms, namely, GRAPH-IHT and GRAPH-GHTP, and then analyzes their time complexities and performance bounds.\nA. Algorithm GRAPH-IHT\nThe proposed GRAPH-IHT algorithm generalizes the traditional algorithm named as projected gradient descent [5], [7] that requires a exact solver of the projection oracle P(x). The high-level summary of GRAPH-IHT is shown in Algorithm 1 and illustrated in Figure 1 (b). The procedure generates a sequence of intermediate vectors x0, x1, · · · from an initial approximation x0. At the i-th iteration, the first step (Line 5) first calculates the gradient “∇f(xi)”, and then identifies a subset of nodes via head approximation that returns a support set with the head value at least a constant factor of the optimal head value: “Ω ← H(∇f(xi))”. The support set Ω can be interpreted as the subspace where the nonconvex set “{x | supp(x) ∈M(G, k)}” is located, and the projected gradient in this subspace is: “∇Ωf(xi)”. The second step (Line 6) calculates the projected gradient descent at the point xi with step-size η: “b← xi− η ·∇Ωf(xi)”. The third step (Line 7)\nidentifies a subset of nodes via tail approximation that returns a support set with tail value at most a constant times larger than the optimal tail value: “Si+1 ← T(b)”. The last step (Line 8) calculates the intermediate solution xi+1: xi+1 = bSi+1 . The previous two steps can be interpreted as the projection of b to the nonconvex set “{x | supp(x) ∈ M(G, k)}” using the tail approximation.\nAlgorithm 1 GRAPH-IHT 1: Input: Input graph G, maximum subgraph size k, and step\nsize η (1 by default). 2: Output: The estimated vector x̂ and the corresponding\nconnected subgraph S. 3: i← 0, xi ← 0; Si ← ∅; 4: repeat 5: Ω← H(∇f(xi)); 6: b← xi − η · ∇Ωf(xi); 7: Si+1 ← T(b); 8: xi+1 ← bSi+1 ; 9: i← i+ 1;\n10: until halting condition holds 11: return x̂ = xi and S = GSi ;\nB. Algorithm GRAPH-GHTP\nThe proposed GRAPH-GHTP algorithm generalizes the traditional algorithm named as Gradient Hard Threshold Pursuit (GHTP) that is designed specifically for the k-sparsity model: M = {S ⊆ [n] | |S| ≤ k} [40]. The high-level summary of GRAPH-GHTP is shown in Algorithm 2 and illustrated in Figure 1 (c). The first two steps (Line 5 and Line 6) in each iteration is the same as the first two steps (Line 5 and Line 6) of GRAPH-IHT, except that we return the support of the projected gradient descent: “Ψ ← supp(xi − η · ∇Ωf(xi))”, in which pursuing the minimization will be most effective. Over the support set S, the function f is minimized to produce an intermediate estimate at the third step (Line 7):\nAlgorithm 2 GRAPH-GHTP 1: Input: Input graph G, maximum subgraph size k, and step\nsize η (1 by default). 2: Output: The estimated vector x̂ and the corresponding\nconnected subgraph S. 3: i← 0, xi ← 0; Si ← ∅; 4: repeat 5: Ω← H(∇f(xi)) 6: Ψ← supp(xi − η · ∇Ωf(xi)); 7: b← arg minx∈Rn f(x) s.t. supp(x) ⊆ Ψ; 8: Si+1 ← T(b); 9: xi+1 ← bSi+1 ;\n10: i← i+ 1; 11: until halting condition holds 12: return x̂ = xi and S = GSi ;\n“b← arg minx∈Rn f(x) s.t. supp(x) ⊆ Ω”. The fourth and fifth steps (Line 8 and Line 9) are the same as the last two steps (Line 7 and Line 8) of GRAPH-IHT in each iteration.\nC. Relations between GRAPH-IHT and GRAPH-GHTP\nThese two algorithms are both variants of gradient descent. In overall, GRAPH-GHTP converges faster than GRAPH-IHT as it identifies a better intermediate solution in each iteration by minimizing f(x) over a projected subspace {x | supp(x) ⊆ Ω}. If the cost function f(x) is linear or has some special structure, this intermediate step can be conducted in nearlylinear time. However, when this step is too costly in some applications, GRAPH-IHT is preferred.\nD. Theoretical Analysis of GRAPH-IHT\nIn order to demonstrate the accuracy of estimates using Algorithm 1, we require that the cost function f(x) satisfies the Weak Restricted Strong Convexity (WRSC) condition as follows:\nDefinition III.1 (Weak Restricted Strong Convexity Property (WRSC)). A function f(x) has the (ξ, δ, M)-model-WRSC if ∀x,y ∈ Rn and ∀S ∈M with supp(x) ∪ supp(y) ⊆ S, the following inequality holds for some ξ > 0 and 0 < δ < 1:\n‖x− y − ξ∇Sf(x) + ξ∇Sf(y)‖2 ≤ δ‖x− y‖2. (9)\nThe WRSC is weaker than the popular Restricted Strong Convexity/Smoothness (RSC/RSS) conditions that are used in theoretical analysis of convex optimization algorithms [40]. The RSC condition basically characterizes cost functions that have quadratic bounds on the derivative of the objective function when restricted to model-sparse vectors. The RSC/RSS conditions imply condition WRSC, which indicates that WRSC is no stronger than RSC/RSS [40]. In the special case where f(x) = ‖y−Ax‖22 and ξ = 1, the condition (ξ, δ, M)-model-WRSC reduces to the well known Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) condition in compressive sensing.\nTheorem III.1. Consider the sparsity model of connected subgraphs M(G, k) for some k ∈ N and a cost function f : Rn → R that satisfies the (ξ, δ,M(G, 5k))-model-WRSC\ncondition. If η = cH(1 − δ) − δ then for any x ∈ Rn such that supp(x) ∈M(G, k), with η > 0 the iterates of Algorithm 2 obey\n‖xi+1 − x‖2 ≤ α‖xi − x‖2 + β‖∇If(x)‖2 (10) where\nα0 = cH(1− δ)− δ, β0 = δ(1 + cH),\nα =\n√ 2(1 + cT )\n1− δ\n(√ 1− α20 + ( (2− η\nξ )δ + 1− η ξ\n)) ,\nβ = 1 + cT 1− δ\n( (1 + 2 √ 2)ξ + (2− 2 √ 2)η +\n√ 2β0 α0 + √ 2α0β0√ 1− α20\n) ,\nand I = argmaxS∈M(G,8k) ‖∇Sf(x)‖2\nBefore we prove this result, we give the following two lemmas III.2 and III.3.\nLemma III.2. [40] Assume that f is a differentiable function. If f satisfies condition (ξ, δ,M)-WRSC, then ∀x,y ∈ Rn with supp(x) ∪ supp(y) ⊂ S ∈ M, the following two inequalities hold 1− δ ξ ‖x− y‖2 ≤ ‖∇Sf(x)−∇Sf(y)‖2 ≤ 1 + δ ξ ‖x− y‖2\nf(x) ≤ f(y) + 〈∇f(y),x− y〉+ 1 + δ 2ξ ‖x− y‖22\nLemma III.3. Let α0 = cH(1 − δ) − δ, β0 = ξ(1 + cH), ri = xi − x, and Ω = H(∇f(xi)). Then\n‖riΓc‖2 ≤ √ 1− α20‖r i‖2 + [ β0 α0 + α0β0√ 1− α20 ] ‖∇If(x)‖2\nwhere I = argmaxS∈M(G,8k) ‖∇Sf(x)‖2. We assume that cH and δ are such that α0 > 0.\nProof: Denote Φ = supp(x) ∈ M(G,k),Ω = H(∇f(xi)) ∈ M(G, 2k), ri = xi − x, and Λ = supp(ri) ∈ M(G, 6k). The component ‖∇Γf(xi)‖2 can be lower bounded as ‖∇Γf(xi)‖2 ≥ cH‖∇Φf(xi)‖2\n≥ cH(‖∇Φf(xi)−∇Φf(x)‖2 − ‖∇Φf(x)‖2 ≥ cH(1− δ) ξ ‖ri‖2 − cH‖∇If(x)‖2,\nwhere the first inequality follows from the definition of head approximation and the last inequality follows from Lemma III.2 of our paper. The component ‖∇Γf(xi)‖2 can also be upper bounded as ‖∇Γf(xi)‖2 ≤ 1\nξ ‖ξ∇Γf(xi)− ξ∇Γf(x)‖2 + ‖∇Γf(x)‖2\n≤ 1 ξ ‖ξ∇Γf(xi)− ξ∇Γf(x)− riΓ + riΓ‖2 +\n‖∇Γf(x)‖2\n≤ 1 ξ ‖ξ∇Γ∪Ωf(xi)− ξ∇Γ∪Ωf(x)− riΓ∪Ω‖2 +\n‖riΓ‖2 + ‖∇Γf(x)‖2\n≤ δ ξ · ‖ri‖2 + 1 ξ ‖riΓ‖2 + ‖∇If(x)‖2,\nwhere the fourth inequality follows from condition (ξ, δ,M(G, 8k))-WRSC and the fact that riΓ∪Ω = ri. Combining the two bounds and grouping terms, we obtain\nthe inequality:\n‖riΓ‖ ≥ α0‖ri‖2 − ξ(1 + cH)‖∇If(x)‖2. We have ‖riΓ‖ ≥ α0‖ri‖2−β0‖∇If(x)‖2. After a number of algebraic manipulations, we obtain the inequality\n‖riΓc‖2 ≤ √ 1− α20‖r i‖2 + [ β0 α0 + α0β0√ 1− α20 ] ‖∇If(x)‖2, which proves the lemma. We give the formal proof of III.1.\nProof: From the traingle inequality, we have\n‖ri+1‖2 = ‖xi+1 − x‖2 = ‖bΨ − x‖2 ≤ ‖b− x‖2 + ‖b− bΨ‖2 ≤ (1 + cT )‖b− x‖2 = (1 + cT )‖xi − η∇Ωf(xi)− xi‖2 = (1 + cT )‖ri − η∇Ωf(xi)‖2,\nwhere ∇Ωf(xi) is the projeceted vector of f(xi) in which the entries outoside Ω are set to zero and the entries in Ω are unchanged. ‖ri − η∇Ωf(xi)‖2 has the inequalities\n‖ri − η∇Ωf(xi)‖2 = ‖riΩc + riΩ − η∇Ωf(xi)‖ ≤ ‖riΩc‖2 + ‖riΩ − η∇Ωf(xi) + η∇Ωf(x)− η∇Ωf(x)‖ ≤ ‖riΩc‖2 + ‖riΩ − η∇Ωf(xi) + η∇Ωf(x)‖+ ‖η∇Ωf(x)‖ ≤ ‖riΩc‖2 + ‖riΩ − ξ∇Ωf(xi) + ξ∇Ωf(x)‖+\n(ξ − η)‖∇Ωf(xi)−∇Ωf(x)‖2‖+ ‖η∇Ωf(x)‖2 ≤ ‖riΩc‖2 + (1− η/ξ + (2− η/ξ)δ)‖ri‖2 + η‖∇If(x)‖2\nwhere the last inequality follows from condition (ξ, δ,M)WRSC and Lemma III.2. From Lemma III.3, we have\n‖riΓc‖2 ≤ √ 1− α20‖ri‖2 + [β0 α0 + α0β0√ 1− α20 ] ‖∇If(x)‖2 Combining the above inequalities, we prove the theorem. Our proposed GRAPH-IHT generalizes several existing sparsity-constrained optimization algorithms: 1) Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) [30]. If we redefine H(b) = supp(b) and T(b) = supp(P(b)), where P(b) is the projection oracle defined in Equation (5), then GRAPH-IHT reduces to the PGD method; 2) Approximated Model-IHT(AMIHT) [13]. If the cost function f(x) is defined as the least square cost function f(x) = ‖y −Ax‖22, then ∇f(x) has the specific form −AT(y −A) and GRAPH-IHT reduces to the AM-IHT algorithm, the state-of-the-art variant of IHT for compressive sensing and linear regression problems. In particular, let e = y −Ax. The component ‖∇f(xi)‖2 = ‖ATe‖2 is upper bound by bounded by √ 1 + δ‖e‖2 [13], Assume that ξ = 1 and η = 1. Condition (ξ, η,M)-WRSC then reduces to the RIP condition in compressive sensing. The convergence inequality (10) then reduces to\n‖xi+1 − x‖2 ≤ α′‖xi − x‖2 + β′‖e‖2, (11) where α′ = (1 + cT ) [ δ + √ 1− α20 ] and\nβ′ = (1 + cT ) [ (α0 + β0)√1 + δ\nα0 + α0β0(\n√ 1 + δ)√\n1− α20\n] .\nSurprisingly, the above convergence inequality is identical to the convergence inequality of AM-IHT derived in [13] based on the RIP condition, which indicates that GRAPH-IHT has the same convergence rate and approximation error as AM-IHT, although we did not make any attempt to explore the special properties of the RIP condition. We note that the convergence properties of GRAPH-IHT hold in fairly general setups beyond compressive sensing and linear regression. As we consider GRAPH-IHT as a fast variant of GRAPH-GHTP, due to space limit we ignore the discussions about the convergence condition of GRAPH-IHT. The theoretical analysis of GRAPH-GHTP to be discussed in the next subsection can be readily adapted to the theoretical analysis of GRAPH-IHT.\nE. Theoretical Analysis of GRAPH-GHTP\nTheorem III.4. Consider the sparsity model of connected subgraphs M(G, k) for some k ∈ N and a cost function f : Rn → R that satisfies the (ξ, δ,M(G, 5k))-model-WRSC condition. If η = cH(1 − δ) − δ then for any x ∈ Rn such that supp(x) ∈M(G, k), with η > 0 the iterates of Algorithm 2 obey\n‖xi+1 − x‖2 ≤ α‖xi − x‖2 + β‖∇If(x)‖2 (12) where\nα0 = cH(1− δ)− δ, β0 = δ(1 + cH),\nα =\n√ 2(1 + cT )\n1− δ\n(√ 1− α20 + ( (2− η\nξ )δ + 1− η ξ\n)) ,\nβ = 1 + cT 1− δ\n( (1 + 2 √ 2)ξ + (2− 2 √ 2)η +\n√ 2β0 α0 + √ 2α0β0√ 1− α20\n) ,\nand I = argmaxS∈M(G,8k) ‖∇Sf(x)‖2\nProof: Denote Ω = H(∇f(xi)) and Ψ = supp(xi − η · ∇Ωf(xi)). Let ri+1 = xi+1 − x. ‖ri+1‖2 is bounded as\n‖ri+1‖2 = ‖xi+1 − x‖2 ≤ ‖xi+1 − b‖2 + ‖x− b‖2 ≤ cT ‖x− b‖2 + ‖x− b‖2 ≤ (1 + cT )‖x− b‖2, (13)\nwhere the second inequality follows from the definition of tail approximation. The component ‖(x− b)Ψ‖22 is bounded as\n‖(x− b)Ψ‖22 = 〈b− x, (b− x)Ψ〉 = 〈b− x− ξ∇Ψf(b) + ξ∇Ψf(x), (b− x)Ψ〉 −\n〈ξ∇Ψf(x), (b− x)Ψ〉 ≤ δ‖b− x‖2‖(b− x)Ψ‖2 + ξ‖∇Ψf(x)‖2‖(b− x)Ψ‖2,\nwhere the second equality follows from the fact that ∇Sf(b) = 0 since b is the solution to the problem in the third Step (Line 7) of GRAPH-GHTP, and the last inequality can be derived from condition (ξ, δ,M(G, 8k))-WRSC. After simplification, we have\n‖(x− b)Ψ‖2 ≤ δ‖b− x‖2 + ξ‖∇Ψf(x)‖2. It follows that‖x− b‖2 ≤ ‖(x− b)Ψ‖2 + ‖(x− b)Ψc‖2\n≤ δ‖b− x‖2 + ξ‖∇Ψf(x)‖2 + ‖(x− b)Ψc‖2.\nAfter rearrangement we obtain\n‖b− x‖2 ≤ ‖(b− x)Ψc‖2 1− δ + ξ‖∇Ψf(x)‖2 1− δ , (14)\nwhere this equality follows from the fact that supp(b) ⊆ S. Let Φ = supp(x) ∈M(G, k).\n‖(xi − η∇Ωf(xi))Φ‖2 ≤ ‖(xi − η∇Ωf(xi))Ψ‖2,\nas Ψ = supp(xi−η·∇Ωf(xi)). By eliminating the contribution on Φ ∩Ψ, we derive ‖(xi − η∇Ωf(xi))Φ\\Ψ‖2 ≤ ‖(xi − η∇Ωf(xi))Ψ\\Φ‖2\nFor the right-hand side, we have ‖(xi − η∇Ωf(xi))Ψ\\Φ‖2 ≤ ‖(xi − x− η∇Ωf(xi) + η∇Ωf(x))Ψ\\Φ‖2 + η‖∇Ω∪Ψf(x)‖2,\nwhere the inequality falls from the fact that Φ = supp(x). From the left-hand side, we have\n‖(xi − η∇Ωf(xi))Φ\\Ψ‖2 ≤ −η‖∇Ω∪Φf(x)‖2 + ‖(xi − x− η∇Ωf(xi) + η∇Ωf(x))Φ\\Ψ + (x− b)Ψc‖2\nwhere the inequality follows from the fact that bΨc = 0, xΦ\\Ψ = xΨc , and −xΦ\\Ψ + (x − b)Ψc = 0.

From Lemma III.3, we have\n‖riΩc‖2 ≤ √ 1− η2‖ri‖2 +\n[ ξ(1 + cH)\nη + ξη(1 + cH)√\n1− η2\n] ‖∇If(x)‖2\nCombining (14) and above inequalities, we prove the theorem.\nTheorem III.4 shows the estimator error of GRAPH-GHTP is determined by the multiple of ‖∇Sf(x)‖2, and the convergence rate is geometric. Specifically, if x is an uncontrained minimizer of f(x), then ∇f(x) = 0. It means GRAPH-GHTP is guaranteed to obtain the true x to arbitrary precision. The estimation error is negligible when x is sufficiently close to an unconstrained minimizer of f(x) as ‖∇Sf(x)‖2 is a small value. The parameter\nα =\n√ 2(1 + cT )\n1− δ\n(√ 1− α20 + ( (2− η\nξ )δ + 1− η ξ\n)) < 1,\ncontrols the convergence rate of GRAPH-GHTP. Our algorithm allows an exact recovery if α < 1. As δ is an arbitrary\nconstant parameter, it can be an arbitrary small positive value. Let η be ξ and δ be an arbitrary small positive value, the parameters cH and cT satisfy the following inequality\nc2H > 1− 1/(1 + cT )2. (15) It is noted that the head and tail approximation algorithms described in [15] do not meet the inequality (15). Nonetheless, the approximation factor cH of any given head approximation algorithm can be boosted to any arbitrary constant c′H < 1, which leads to the satisfaction of the above condition as shown in [15]. Boosting the head-approximation algorithm, though strongly suggested by [13], is not empirically necessary.\nOur proposed GRAPH-GHTP has strong connections to the recently proposed algorithm named as Gradient Hard Thresholding Pursuit (GHTP) [40] that is designed specifically for the k-sparsity model: M = {S ⊆ [n] | |S| ≤ k}. In particular, if we redefine H(b) = supp(b) and T(b) = supp(P(b)), where P(b) is the projection oracle defined in Equation (5), and assume that there is an algorithm that solves the projection oracle exactly, in which the sparsity model does not require to be the k-sparsity model. It then follows that the upper bound of ‖riΩc‖2 stated in Lemma III.2 in Appendix is updated as ‖riΩc‖2 ≤ 0, since supp(ri) = Ω and riΩc = 0. In addition, the multiplier (1 + cT ) is replaced as 1 as the first inequality (13) in the proof of Theorem III.4 in Appendix is updated as ‖ri+1‖2 ≤ ‖x−b‖2, instead of the original version ‖ri+1‖2 ≤ (1 + cT )‖x − b‖2. After these two changes, the shrinkage rate α is updated as\nα =\n√ 2\n1− δ\n( (2− η\nξ )δ + 1− η ξ\n) , (16)\nwhich is the same as the shrinkage rate of GRAPH-GHTP as derived in [40] specifically for the k-sparsity model. The above shrinkage rate α (16) should satisfy the condition α < 1 to ensure the geometric convergence of GRAPH-GHTP, which implies that\nη > ((2 √ 2 + 1)δ + √ 2− 1)ξ/( √ 2 + √ 2δ). (17)\nIt follows that if δ < 1/( √\n2 + 1), a step-size η < ξ can always be found to satisfy the above inequality. This constant condition of δ is analogous to the constant condition of stateof-the-art compressive sensing methods that consider noisy measurements [23] under the assumption of the RIP condition. We derive the analogous constant using the WRSC condition that weaker than the RIP condition.\nAs discussed above, our proposed GRAPH-GHTP has connections to GHTP on the shrinkage rate of geometric convergence. We note that the shrinkage rate of our proposed GRAPH-GHTP stated in Theorem III.4 is derived based on head and tail approximations of the sparsity model of connected subgraphs M(G, k), instead of the k-sparsity model that has an exact projection oracle solver. Our convergence properties hold in fairly general setups beyond k-sparsity model, as a number of popular structured sparsity models such as the “standard” k-sparsity, block sparsity, cluster sparsity, and tree sparsity can be encoded as special cases of M(G, k).\nTheorem III.5. Let x ∈ Rn such that supp(x) ∈ M(G, k), and f : Rn → R be cost function that satisfies condition (ξ, δ,M(8k, g))-WRSC. Assuming that α < 1, GRAPH-GHTP (or GRAPH-IHT) returns a x̂ such that, supp(x̂) ∈ M(5k, g) and ‖x− x̂‖2 ≤ c‖∇If(x)‖2, where c = (1 + β1−α ) is a fixed constant. Moreover, GRAPH-GHTP runs in time\nO ( (T + |E| log3 n) log(‖x‖2/‖∇If(x)‖2) ) , (18)\nwhere T is the time complexity of one execution of the subproblem in Step 6 in GRAPH-GHTP (or Step 5 in GRAPHIHT). In particular, if T scales linearly with n, then GRAPHGHTP (or GRAPH-IHT) scales nearly linearly with n.\nProof: The i-th iterate of GRAPH-GHTP (or GRAPHIHT) satisfies\n‖x− xi‖2 ≤ αi‖x‖2 + β\n1− α‖∇If(x)‖2. (19) After t = ⌈ log (\n‖x‖2 ‖∇If(x)‖2 ) / log 1α ⌉ iterations, GRAPH-\nGHTP (or GRAPH-IHT) returns an estimate x̂ satisfying ‖x− x̂‖2 ≤ (1 + β1−α )‖∇If(x)‖2. The time complexities of both head approximation and tail approximation are O(|E| log3 n). The time complexity of one iteration in GRAPH-GHTP (or GRAPH-IHT) is (T + |E| log3 n), and the total number of iterations is ⌈ log (\n‖x‖2 ‖∇If(x)‖2 ) / log 1α ⌉ , and the overall time\nfollows. GRAPH-GHTP and GRAPH-IHT are only different in the definition of α and β in this Theorem.\nAs shown in Theorem 18, the time complexity of GRAPHGHTP is dependent on the total number of iterations and the time cost (T ) to solve the subproblem in Step 6. In comparison, the time complexity of GRAPH-IHT is dependent on the total number of iterations and the time cost T to calculate the gradient ∇f(xi) in Step 5. It implies that, although GRAPHGHTP converges faster than GRAPH-IHT, the time cost to solve the subproblem in Step 6 is often much higher than the time cost to calculate a gradient ∇f(xi), and hence GRAPHIHT runs faster than GRAPH-GHTP in practice."

      "heading" : "IV. APPLICATIONS ON GRAPH SCAN STATISTICS",
      "text" : "In this section, we specialize GRAPH-IHT and GRAPHGHTP to optimize a number of well-known graph scan statistics for the task of connected subgraph detection, including elevated mean scan (EMS) statistic [29], Kulldorff’s scan statistic [25], and expectation-based Poisson (EBP) scan statistic [26]. Each graph scan statistic is defined as the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) statistic of a specific hypothesis testing about the distributions of features of normal and abnormal nodes. The EMS statistic corresponds to the following GLRT test: Given a graph G = (V,E), where V = [n] and E ⊆ V × V, each node i is associated with a random variable xi:\nxi = µ · 1(i ∈ S) + i, i ∈ V, (20) where |µ| represents the signal strength and i ∈ N (0, 1). S is some unknown anomalous cluster that forms as a connected subgraph. The task is to decide between the null hypothesis (H0): ci ∈ N (0, 1),∀i ∈ V and the alternative (H1(S)): ci ∈ N (µ, 1),∀i ∈ S and ci ∈ N (0, 1),∀i /∈ S. The EMS statistic\nis defined as the GLRT function under this hypothesis testing:\nF (S) = Prob(Data|H1(S))\nProb(Data|H0) = 1√ |S| ∑ i∈S ci. (21)\nThe problem of connected subgraph detection based on the EMS statistic is then formulated as\nmin S⊆V − 1 |S| ( ∑ i∈S ci) 2 s.t. S ∈M(G, k), (22)\nwhere the square of the EMS scan statistic is considered to make the function smooth, and this transformation does not infect the optimum solution. Let the {0, 1}-vectors form of S be x ∈ {0, 1}n, such that supp(x) = S. Problem (22) can be reformulated as\nmin x∈{0,1}n\n−(cTx)2/(1Tx) s.t. supp(x) ∈M(G, k), (23)\nwhere c = [c1, · · · , cn]T. To apply our proposed algorithms, we relax the input domain of x and maximize the strongly convex function [3]:\nmin x∈Rn −(cTx)2/(1Tx) + 1 2 xTx s.t. supp(x) ∈M(G, k). (24) The connected subset of nodes can be found as the subset of indexes of positive entries in x̂, where x̂ refers to the solution of the Problem (24). Assume that c is normalized and ci ≤ 1, ∀i. Let ĉ = max{c1, · · · , cn}. The Hessian matrix of the above objective function satisfies the following conditions\n(1− ĉ2) · I I− (c− c Tx 1Tx 1)(c− c Tx 1Tx 1)T 1 · I. (25) According to Lemma 1 (b) in [40]), the objective function f(x) satisfies condition (ξ, δ,M(G, 8k))-WRSC that\nδ = √\n1− 2ξ(1− ĉ2) + ξ2, for any ξ such that ξ < 2(1− ĉ2). The geometric convergence of GRAPH-GTHP as shown in Theorem III.4 is guaranteed.\nDifferent from the EMS statistic that is defined for numerical features based on Gaussian distribution, the Kulldorff’s scan statistic and Expectation Based Poisson statistic (EBP) are defined for count features based on Poisson distribution. In particular, each node i is associated with a feature ci, the count of events (e.g., crimes, flu infections) observed at the current time, and a feature bi, the expected count (or ‘baseline’) of events by using historical data. Let c = [c1, · · · , cn]T and b = [b1, · · · , bn]T. The Kulldorff’s scan statistic and EBP scan statistics are described Table I. We note that these two scan statistics do not satisfy the WRSC condition, but as demonstrated in our experiments, our proposed algorithms perform empirically well for all the three scan statistics, and in particular, our proposed GRAPH-GHTP converged in less than 10 iterations in all the settings."

      "text" : "Datasets: 1) BWSN Dataset. A real-world water network is offered in the Battle of the Water Sensor Networks (BWSN) [28]. That has 12,527 nodes and 14,323 edges. In order to simulate a contaminant sub-area, 4 nodes with chemical contaminant plumes, which were distributed in this sub-area, were generated. We use the water network simulator EPANET [31] that was employed in BWSN for a period of 3 hours to simulate the spreads for contaminant plumes on this graph. If a node is polluted by the chemical, then its sensor reports 1, otherwise, 0, in each hour. To test the tolerance of noise of our methods, K ∈ {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} percent vertices were selected randomly, and their sensor reports were set to 0 if their original reports were 1 and vice versa. Each hour has a graph snapshot. The snapshots corresponding to the 3 hours that have 0% noise are considered for training, and the snapshots that have 2%, · · · , 10% noise reports for testing. The goal is to detect a connected subgraph that is corresponding to the contaminant sub-area. 2) CitHepPh Dataset. We downloaded the high energy physics phenomenology citation data (CitHepPh) from Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP) [20]. This citation graph contains 11,897 papers corresponding to graph vertices and 75,873 edges. An undirected edge between two vertices (papers) exists , if one paper is cited by another. The period of these papers published is from January 1992 to April 2002. Each vertex has two attributes for each specific year (t = 1992, · · · , t = 2002). We denote the number of citations of each specific year as the first attribute and the average citations of all papers in that year as the second attribute. The goal is to detect a connected subgraph where the number of citations of vertices (papers) in this subgraph are abnormally high compared with the citations of vertices that are not in this subgraph. This connected subgraph is considered as a potential emerging research area. Since the training data is required for some baseline methods, the data before 1999 is considered as the training data, and the rest from 1999 to 2002 as the testing data. 3) Traffic Dataset. Road traffic speed data from June 1, 2013 to Mar. 31, 2014 in the arterial road network of the Washington D.C. region is collected from the INRIX database (http://inrix.com/publicsector.asp), with 1,723 nodes and 5,301 edges. The database provides traffic speed for each link at a 15-minute rate. For each 15-minute interval, each method identities a connected subgraph as the most congested region. 4) ChicagoCrime Dataset. We collected crime data from City of Chicago [https://data.cityofchicago.org/PublicSafety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2] from Jan. 2001 to Dec. 2015. There are 46,357 nodes (census blocks) and 168,020 edges (Two census blocks are connected with each other if they are neighbours). Specifically, we collected all records of burglaries from 2001 to 2015. The data covers burglaries in the period from Jan. 2001 to Dec. 2015. Each vertex has an attribute denoting the number of burglaries in sepcific year and average number of burglaries over 10 years. We aim to detect connected census areas which has anomaly high burglaries accidents. The data before 2010 is considered as training data, and the data from 2011 to 2015 is considered as testing data. Graph Scan Statistics: As shown in Table I, three graph scan statistics were considered as the scoring functions of connected subgraphs, including Kulldorff’s scan statistic [25], expectation-based Poisson (EBP) scan statistic [26], and elevated mean scan (EMS) statistic [29]. The first two statistic functions require that each vertex v has a count cv representing the count of events observed at that vertex, and an expected count (‘baseline‘) bv . For EMS statistic, only cv is used. We need to normalize cv for EMS as it is defined based on the assumptions of standard normal distribution for normal values and shifted-mean normal distribution for abnormal values.\nTable II provides details about the calculations of cv and bv for each data set.\nComparison Methods: We compared our proposed methods with four state-of-the-art baseline methods that are designed specifically for connected subgraph detection, namely, GraphLaplacian [33], EventTree [32], DepthFirstGraphScan [36] and NPHGS [8]. DepthFirstGraphScan is an exact search algorithm based on depth-first search and takes weeks to run on graphs that have more than 1000 nodes. We imposed a maximum limit on the depth of the search to 10 to reduce its time complexity.\nThe basic ideas of these baseline methods are summarized as follows: NPHGS starts from random seeds (nodes) as initial candidate clusters and gradually expends each candidate cluster by including its neighboring nodes that could help improve its BJ statistic score until no new nodes can be added. The candidate cluster with the largest BJ statistic score is returned. DepthFirstGraphScan adopts a similar strategy to NPHGS but expands the initial clusters based on depth-first search. GraphLaplacian uses a graph Laplacian penalty function to replace the connectivity constraint and converts the problem to a convex optimization problem. EventTree reformulates the connected subgraph detection problem as a prize-collecting steiner tree (PCST) problem [19] and apply the Goemans-Williamson (G-W) algorithm for PCST [19] to detect anomalous subgraphs. We also implemented the generalized fused lasso model (GenFusedLasso) for graph scan statistics using the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). GenFusedLasso method solves the following minimization problem\nmin x∈Rn\n−f(x) + λ ∑\n(i,j)∈E |xi − xj |, (26)\nwhere f(x) is a predefined graph scan statistic and the trade-off parameter λ controls the degree of smoothness of neighboring entries in x. We applied the heuristic rounding step proposed in [29] to x to generate connected subgraphs.\nParameter Tunning: We strictly followed strategies recommended by authors in their original papers to tune the related model parameters. Specifically, for EventTree, we tested the set of λ values: {0.02, 0.04, · · · , 2.0, 3.0, · · · , 20}. For Graph-Laplacian, we tested the set of λ values: {0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1} and returned the best result. For GenFusedLasso, we tested the set of λ values: {0.02, 0.04, · · · , 2.0, 3.0, · · · , 20}. For NPHGS, we set the suggested parameters by the authors: αmax = 0.15 and K = 5. Our proposed methods GRAPH-IHT and GRAPH-GHTP have a single parameter k, an upper bound of the subgraph size. We tested the set of k values: {50, 100, · · · , 1000}. As the BWSN dataset has the ground truth about the contaminated nodes, we identified the best parameter for each method that has the largest F-measure in the training data. For the other data sets, as we do not have ground truth about the true subgraphs, for each specific scan statistic, we identified the best parameter for each method that was able to identify the connected subgraph with the largest statistic score.\nPerformance Metrics: 1) Optimization Power. The over-\nall scores of the three graph scan statistic functions of the connected subgraphs returned by the comparison methods are compared and analyzed. The objective is to identify methods that could find the connected subgraphs with the largest graph scan statistic scores. 2) Precision, Recall, and F-Measure. For the BWSN dataset, as the true anomalous subgraphs are known,we use F-measure that combines precision and recall to evaluate the quality of detected subgraphs by different methods. 3) Run Time. The running times of different methods are compared."

As the setting of the parameter λ will influence the quality of the detected connected subgraph, the results under different λ values are also shown in Figure 2. The results indicate that our method GRAPH-GHTP converges in less than 10 iterations, and GRAPH-IHT converges in more steps.

Although a number of structured sparsity models have been explored, such as trees, groups, clusters, and paths, connected subgraphs have been rarely explored in the current literature. One of the main technical challenges is that there is no structured sparsity-inducing norm that can directly model the space of connected subgraphs, and there is no exact implementation of a projection oracle for connected subgraphs due to its NP-hardness. In this paper, we explore efficient approximate projection oracles for connected subgraphs, and propose two new efficient algorithms, namely, GRAPH-IHT and GRAPH-GHTP, to optimize a generic nonlinear objective function subject to connectivity constraint on the support of the variables. Our proposed algorithms enjoy strong guarantees analogous to several current methods for sparsity-constrained optimization, such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Approximate Model Iterative Hard Thresholding (AM-IHT), and Gradient Hard Thresholding Pursuit (GHTP) with respect to convergence rate and approximation accuracy. We apply our proposed algorithms to optimize several well-known graph scan statistics in several applications of connected subgraph detection as a case study, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods.",
