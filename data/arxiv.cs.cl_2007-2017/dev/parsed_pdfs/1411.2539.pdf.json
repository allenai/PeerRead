      "text" : "Generating descriptions for images has long been regarded as a challenging perception task integrating vision, learning and language understanding. One not only needs to correctly recognize what appears in images but also incorporate knowledge of spatial relationships and interactions between objects. Even with this information, one then needs to generate a description that is relevant and grammatically correct. With the recent advances made in deep neural networks, tasks such as object recognition and detection have made significant breakthroughs in only a short time. The task of describing images is one that now appears tractable and ripe for advancement. Being able to append large image databases with accurate descriptions for each image would significantly improve the capabilities of content-based image retrieval systems. Moreover, systems that can describe images well, could in principle, be fine-tuned to answer questions about images also.\nThis paper describes a new approach to the problem of image caption generation, casted into the framework of encoder-decoder models. For the encoder, we learn a joint image-sentence embedding where sentences are encoded using long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks [1]. Image features from a deep convolutional network are projected into the embedding space of the LSTM hidden states. A pairwise ranking loss is minimized in order to learn to rank images and their descriptions. For decoding, we introduce a new neural language model called the structure-content neural language model (SC-NLM). The SC-NLM differs from existing models in that it disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on distributed representations produced by the encoder. We show that sampling from an SC-NLM allows us to generate realistic image captions, significantly improving over the generated captions produced by [2]. Furthermore, we argue that this combination of approaches naturally fits into the experimentation framework of [3], that is, a good encoder can be used to rank images and captions while a good decoder can be used to generate new captions from scratch. Our approach effectively unifies image-text embedding models (encoder\nar X\niv :1\n41 1.\n25 39\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 0\nN ov\nphase) [4, 5, 6] with multimodal neural language models (decoder phase) [2] [7]. Furthermore, our method builds on analogous approaches being used in machine translation [8, 9, 10, 11].\nWhile the application focus of our work is on image description generation and ranking, we also qualitatively analyse properties of multimodal vector spaces learned using images and sentences. We show that using a linear sentence encoder, linguistic regularities [12] also carry over to multimodal vector spaces. For example, *image of a blue car* - \"blue\" + \"red\" results in a vector that is near images of red cars. We qualitatively examine several types of analogies and structures with PCA projections. Consequently, even with a global image-sentence training objective the encoder can still be used to retrieve locally (e.g. individual words). This is analogous to pairwise ranking methods used in machine translation [13, 14]."

      "text" : "A large body of work has been done on learning multimodal representations of images and text. Popular approaches include learning joint image-word embeddings [4, 5] as well as embedding images and sentences into a common space [6, 15]. Our proposed pipeline makes direct use of these ideas. Other approaches to multimodal learning include the use of deep Boltzmann machines [16], log-bilinear neural language models [2], autoencoders [17], recurrent neural networks [7] and topic-models [18]. Several bi-directional approaches to ranking images and captions have also been proposed, based off of kernel CCA [3], normalized CCA [19] and dependency tree recursive networks [6]. From an architectural standpoint, our encoder-decoder model is most similar to [20], who proposed a two-step embedding and generation procedure for semantic parsing."

      "text" : "We group together approaches to generation into three types of methods, each described here in more detail:\nTemplate-based methods. Template-based methods involve filling in sentence templates, such as triplets, based on the results of object detections and spatial relationships [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. While\nthese approaches can produce accurate descriptions, they are often more ‘robotic’ in nature and do not generalize to the fluidity and naturalness of captions written by humans.\nComposition-based methods. These approaches aim to harness existing image-caption databases by extracting components of related captions and composing them together to generate novel descriptions [26, 27]. The advantage of these approaches are that they allow for a much broader and more expressive class of captions that are more fluent and human-like then template-based approaches.\nNeural network methods. These approaches aim to generate descriptions by sampling from conditional neural language models. The initial work in this area, based off of multimodal neural language models [2], generated captions by conditioning on feature vectors from the output of a deep convolutional network. These ideas were recently extended to multimodal recurrent networks with significant improvements [7]. The methods described in this paper produce descriptions that at least qualitatively on par with current state-of-the-art composition-based methods [27].\nDescription generation systems have been plagued with issues of evaluation. While Bleu and Rouge have been used in the past, [3] has argued that such automated evaluation methods are unreliable and do not match human judgements. These authors instead proposed that the problem of ranking images and captions can be used as a proxy for generation. Since any generation system requires a scoring function to access how well a caption and image match, optimizing this task should naturally carry over to an improvement in generation. Many recent methods have since used this approach for evaluation. None the less, the question on how to transfer improvements on ranking to generating new descriptions remained. We argue that encoder-decoder methods naturally fit into this experimentation framework. That is, the encoder gives us a way to rank images and captions and develop good scoring functions, while the decoder can use the representations learned to optimize the scoring functions as a way of generating and scoring new descriptions."

      "text" : "Our proposed pipeline, while new to caption generation, has already experienced several successes in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The goal of NMT is to develop an end-to-end translation system with a large neural network, as opposed to using a neural network as an additional feature function to an existing phrase-based system. NMT methods are based on the encoder-decoder principle. That is, an encoder is used to map an English sentence to a distributed vector. A decoder is then conditioned on this vector to generate a French translation from the source text. Current methods include using a convolutional encoder and RNN decoder [8], RNN encoder and RNN decoder [9, 10] and LSTM encoder with LSTM decoder [11]. While still a young research area, these methods have already achieved performance on par with strong phrase-based systems and have improved on the start-of-the-art when used for rescoring.\nWe argue that it is natural to think of image caption generation as a translation problem. That is, our goal is to translate an image into a description. This point of view has also been used by [28] and allows us to make use of existing ideas in the machine translation literature. Furthermore, there is a natural correspondence between the concept of scoring functions (how well does a caption and image match) and alignments (which parts of a description correspond to which parts of an image) that can naturally be exploited for generating descriptions."

      "heading" : "2.4 Multiplicative neural language models",
      "text" : "Suppose now we are given a vector u ∈ RK from the multimodal vector space, which has an association with a word sequence S = {w1, . . . , wN}. For example, u may be the embedded representation of an image whose description is given by S. A multiplicative neural language model [30] models the distributionP (wn = i|w1:n−1,u) of a new wordwn given context from the previous words and the vector u. A multiplicative model has the additional property that the word embedding matrix is instead replaced with a tensor T ∈ RV×K×G where G is the number of slices. Given u, we can compute a word representation matrix as a function of u as T u = ∑G i=1 uiT\n(i) i.e. word representations with respect to u are computed as a linear combination of slices weighted by each component ui of u. Here, the number of slices G is equal to K, the dimensionality of u.\nIt is often unnecessary to use a fully unfactored tensor. As in e.g. [38, 39], we re-represent T in terms of three matrices Wfk ∈ RF×K , Wfd ∈ RF×G and Wfv ∈ RF×V , such that\nT u = (Wfv)> · diag(Wfdu) ·Wfk (9) where diag(·) denotes the matrix with its argument on the diagonal. These matrices are parametrized by a pre-chosen number of factors F . In [30], the conditioning vector u is referred to as an attribute and using a third-order model of words allows one to model conditional similarity: how meanings of words change as a function of the attributes they’re conditioned on.\nLet E = (Wfk)>Wfv denote a ‘folded’ K × V matrix of word embeddings. Given the context w1, . . . , wn−1, the predicted next word representation r̂ is given by:\nr̂ = n−1∑ i=1 C(i)E(:, wi), (10)\nwhere E(:, wi) denotes the column of E for the word representation of wi and C(i), i = 1, . . . , n−1 are K × K context matrices. Given a predicted next word representation r̂, the factor outputs are f = (Wfkr̂) • (Wfdu), where • is a component-wise product. The conditional probability P (wn = i|w1:n−1,u) of wn given w1, . . . , wn−1 and u can be written as\nP (wn = i|w1:n−1,u) = exp ( (Wfv(:, i))>f + bi )∑V j=1 exp ( (Wfv(:, j))>f + bj\n) , where Wfv(:, i) denotes the column of Wfv corresponding to word i. In contrast to the log-bilinear model, the matrix of word representations R from before is replaced with the factored tensor T that we have derived. We compared the multiplicative model against an additive variant [2] and found on large datasets, such as the SBU Captioned Photo dataset [40], the multiplicative variant significantly outperforms its additive counterpart. Thus, the SC-NLM is derived from the multiplicative variant.\n4Note that this is a different matrix then that used by the encoder. We use the same vocabulary throughout both models."

      "text" : "We now describe the structure-content neural language model. Suppose that, along with a description S = {w1, . . . , wN}, we are also given a sequence of word-specific structure variables T = {t1, . . . , tN}. Throughout our experiments, each ti corresponds to the part-of-speech for word wi, although other possibilities can be used instead. Given an embedding u (the content vector), our goal is to model the distribution P (wn = i|w1:n−1, tn:n+k,u) from previous word context w1:n−1 and forward structure context tn:n+k, where k is the forward context size. Figure 3 gives an illustration of the model and prediction problem. Intuitively, the structure variables help guide the model during the generation phrase and can be thought of as a soft template to help avoid the model from generating grammatical nonsense. Note that this model shares a resemblance with the NNJM of [41] for machine translation, where the previous word context are predicted words in the target language, and the forward context are words in the source language.\nOur model can be interpreted as a multiplicative neural language model but where the attribute vector is no longer u but instead an additive function of u and the structure variables T . Let {tn, . . . , tn+k}, ti ∈ RK , i = n, . . . , n + k be embedding vectors for the structure variables T . These are obtained from a learned lookup table in the same way as words are. We introduce a sequence of G×G structure context matrices T(i), i = n, . . . , n+ k which play the same role as the word context matrices C(i). Let Tu denote a G × K context matrix for the multimodal vector u. The attribute vector û of combined structure and content information is computed as\nû = [( n+k∑ i=n T(i)ti ) +T(u)u+ b ] +\n(11)\nwhere [·]+ = max{·, 0} is a ReLU non-linearity and b is a bias vector. The vector û now plays the same role as the vector u for the multiplicative model previously described and the remainder of the model remains unchanged. Our experiments use G = K = 300 and factors F = 100.\nThe SC-NLM is trained on a large collection of image descriptions (e.g. Flickr30K). There are several choices available for representing the conditioning vectors u. One choice would be to use the embedding of the corresponding image. An alternative choice, which is the approach we take, is to condition on the embedding vector for the description S computed with the LSTM. The advantage of this approach is that the SC-NLM can be trained purely on text alone. This allows us to make use of large amounts of monolingual text (e.g. non image captions) to improve the quality of the language model. Since the embedding vectors of S share a joint space with the image embeddings, we can also condition the SC-NLM on image embeddings (e.g. at test time, when no description is available) after the model has been trained. This is a significant advantage over a conditional language model that explicitly requires image-caption pairs for training and highlights the strength of a multimodal encoding space.\nDue to space limitations, we leave the full details of our caption generation procedure to the supplementary material."

We perform the same experimental procedure as done by [15] on the Flickr8K [3] and Flickr30K [42] datasets. These datasets come with 8,000 and 30,000 images respectively with each image annotated using 5 sentences by independent annotators. As with [15], we did not do any explicit text preprocessing. We used two convolutional network architectures for extracting 4096 dimensional image features: the Toronto ConvNet 5 as well as the 19-layer OxfordNet [43] which finished 2nd place in the ILSVRC 2014 classification competition. Following the protocol of [15], 1000 images are used for validation, 1000 for testing and the rest are used for training. Evaluation is performed using Recall@K, namely the mean number of images for which the correct caption is ranked within the top-K retrieved results (and vice-versa for sentences). We also report the median rank of the closest ground truth result from the ranked list. We compare our results to each of the following methods:\nDeViSE. The deep visual semantic embedding model [5] was proposed as a way of performing zeroshot object recognition and was used as a baseline by [15]. In this model, sentences are represented as the mean of their word embeddings and the objective function optimized matches ours.\nSDT-RNN. The semantic dependency tree recursive neural network [6] is used to learn sentence representations for embedding into a joint image-sentence space. The same objective is used.\nDeFrag. Deep fragment embeddings [15] were proposed as an alternative to embedding full-frame image features and take advantage of object detections from the R-CNN [44] detector. Descriptions are represented as a bag of dependency parses. Their objective incorporates both a global and fragment objectives, for which their global objective matches ours.\nm-RNN. The multimodal recurrent neural network [7] is a recently proposed method that uses perplexity as a bridge between modalities, as first introduced by [2]. Unlike all other methods, the m-RNN does not use a ranking loss and instead optimizes the log-likelihood of predicting the next word in a sequence conditioned on an image.\nOur LSTMs use 1 layer with 300 units and weights initialized uniformly from [-0.08, 0.08]. The margin α was set to α = 0.2, which we found performed well on both datasets. Training is done using stochastic gradient descent with an initial learning rate of 1 and was exponentially decreased.

Methods that\n5https://github.com/TorontoDeepLearning/convnet\nlearn explicit embedding spaces have a significant speed advantage over perplexity-based retrieval methods, since retrieval is easily done with a single matrix multiply of stored embedding vectors from the dataset with the query vector. Thus explicit embedding methods are much better suited for scaling to large datasets.\nPerhaps more interestingly is the fact that both our method and the m-RNN outperform existing models that integrate object detections. This is contradictory to [6], where recurrent networks are the worst performing models. This highlights the effectiveness of LSTM cells for encoding dependencies across descriptions and learning meaningful distributed sentence representations. Integrating object detections into our framework should almost surely improve performance as well as allow for interpretable retrievals, as in the case of DeFrag.\nUsing image features from the OxfordNet model results in a significant performance boost across all metrics, giving new state-of-the-art numbers on these evaluation tasks."

Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* \"blue\" + \"red\" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison.",
