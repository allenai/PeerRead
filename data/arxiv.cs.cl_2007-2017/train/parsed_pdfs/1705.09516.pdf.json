      "text" : "Biomedical events describe complex interactions between various biomedical entities. Event trigger is a word or a phrase which typically signifies the occurrence of an event. Event trigger identification is an important first step in all event extraction methods. However many of the current approaches either rely on complex handcrafted features or consider features only within a window. In this paper we propose a method that takes the advantage of recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract higher level features present across the sentence. Thus hidden state representation of RNN along with word and entity type embedding as features avoid relying on the complex hand-crafted features generated using various NLP toolkits. Our experiments have shown to achieve state-ofart F1-score on Multi Level Event Extraction (MLEE) corpus. We have also performed category-wise analysis of the result and discussed the importance of various features in trigger identification task."

      "text" : "Biomedical events play an important role in improving biomedical research in many ways. Some of its applications include pathway curation (Ohta et al., 2013) and development of domain specific semantic search engine (Ananiadou et al., 2015). So as to gain attraction among researchers many challenges such as BioNLP’09 (Kim et al., 2009), BioNLP’11 (Kim et al., 2011), BioNLP’13 (Nédellec et al., 2013) have been organized and many novel methods have also been proposed addressing these tasks.\nAn event can be defined as a combination of a trigger word and arbitrary number of arguments. Figure 1 shows two events with trigger words as “Inhibition” and “Angiogenesis” of trigger types “Negative Regulation” and “Blood Vessel Development” respectively. Pipelined based approaches for biomedical event extraction include event trigger identification followed by event argument identification. Analysis in multiple studies (Wang et al., 2016b; Zhou et al., 2014) reveal that more than 60% of event extraction errors are caused due to incorrect trigger identification.\nExisting event trigger identification models can be broadly categorized in two ways: rule based approaches and machine learning based approaches. Rule based approaches use various strategies including pattern matching and regular expression to define rules (Vlachos et al., 2009). However, defining these rules are very difficult, time consuming and requires domain knowledge. The overall performance of the task depends on the quality of rules defined. These approaches often fail to generalize for new datasets when compared with machine learning based approaches. Machine learning based approaches treat the trigger identification problem as a word level classification problem, where many features from the data are extracted using various NLP toolkits (Pyysalo et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2014) or learned automatically (Wang et al., 2016a,b).\nIn this paper, we propose an approach using RNN to learn higher level features without the requirement of complex feature engineering. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed approach on\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n09 51\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n6 M\nay 2\n01 7\nMLEE corpus. We also have performed categorywise analysis and investigate the importance of different features in trigger identification task."

      "text" : "Many approaches have been proposed to address the problem of event trigger identification. Pyysalo et al. (2012) proposed a model where various hand-crafted features are extracted from the processed data and fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform final classification. Zhou et al. (2014) proposed a novel framework for trigger identification where embedding features of the word combined with hand-crafted features are fed to SVM for final classification using multiple kernel learning. Wei et al. (2015) proposed a pipeline method on BioNLP’13 corpus based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support vector machine (SVM) where the CRF is used to tag valid triggers and SVM is finally used to identify the trigger type. The above methods rely on various NLP toolkits to extract the hand-crafted features which leads to error propagation thus affecting the classifier’s performance. These methods often need to tailor different features for different tasks, thus not making them generalizable. Most of the hand-crafted features are also traditionally sparse one-hot features vector which fail to capture the semantic information.\nWang et al. (2016b) proposed a neural network model where dependency based word embeddings (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) within a window around the word are fed into a feed forward neural network (FFNN) (Collobert et al., 2011) to perform final classification. Wang et al. (2016a) proposed another model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) where word and entity mention features of words within a window around the word are fed to a CNN to perform final classification. Although both of the methods have achieved good performance they fail to capture features outside the window."

Apart from the proposed models we also compare our results with two more baseline methods FFNN and CNNψ which are our implementations. Here FFNN is a window based feed forward neural network where embedding features of words within the window are used to predict the trigger label (Collobert et al., 2011). We chose window size as 3 (one word from left\nand one word from right) after tuning it in validation set. CNNψ is our implementation of window based CNN classifier proposed by Wang et al. (2016a) due to unavailability of their code in public domain. Our proposed model have shown slight improvement in F1-score when compared with baseline models. The proposed model’s ability to capture the context of the whole sentence is likely to be one of the reasons of improvement in performance.\nWe perform one-side t-test over 5 runs of F1Scores to verify our proposed model’s performance when compared with FFNN and CNNΨ. The p value of the proposed model (GRU) when compared with FFNN and CNNψ are 8.57×10−07 and 1.178 × 10−10 respectively. This indicates statistically superior performance of the proposed model."

It can be observed that\nmodel’s performance in anatomical and molecular categories are better than general and planned categories.

For example, Ew + Ee and g means using both word and entity type embedding as the input feature for the model and g means only using the global feature (hidden state of RNN) for final prediction.\nExamples in Table 6 illustrate importance of features used in best performing models. In phrase 1 the word “knockdown”, is a part of an entity namely “round about knockdown endothelial\ncells” of type “Cell” and in phrase 2 it is trigger word of type “Planned Process”, methods 1 and 2 failed to differentiate both of them because of no knowledge about the entity type. In phrase 3 “impaired” is a trigger word of type “Negative Regulation” methods 1 and 3 failed to correctly identify but when reinforced with word-level feature the model succeeded in identification. So, we can say that Ee feature and l+ g model variant help in improving the model’s performance."

Event trigger identification is an important first step in all event extraction methods. However many of the current approaches either rely on complex handcrafted features or consider features only within a window. In this paper we propose a method that takes the advantage of recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract higher level features present across the sentence. Thus hidden state representation of RNN along with word and entity type embedding as features avoid relying on the complex hand-crafted features generated using various NLP toolkits. Our experiments have shown to achieve state-ofart F1-score on Multi Level Event Extraction (MLEE) corpus. We have also performed category-wise analysis of the result and discussed the importance of various features in trigger identification task.",
