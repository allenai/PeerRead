      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Motivation: One of the crucial problems in music discovery is to deliver the summary of music without playing it. One common method is to add descriptions of a music item or playlist, e.g. Getting emotional with the undisputed King of Pop 1 , Just the right blend of chilled-out acoustic songs to work, relax, think, and dream to 2 . These examples show that they are more than simple descriptions and even add value to the curated playlist as a product.\nThere have been attempts to automate the generation of these descriptions. In [8], Eck et al. proposed to use social tags to describe each music item. Fields proposed a similar idea for playlist using social tag and topic model [9] using Latent Dirichlet Allocation [1]. Besides text, Bogdanov introduced music avatars, whose outlook - hair style, clothes, and accessories - describes the recommended music [2].\nBackground: • RNNs: RNNs are neural networks that have a unit with a recurrent connection, whose output is connect to the input of the unit (Figure 1, left). They currently show state-of-the-art performances in tasks that involve sequence modelling. Two types of RNN unit are widely used: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) unit [10] and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [3].\n1 Michael Jackson: Love songs and ballads by Apple Music 2 Your Coffee Break by Spotify\nc© Keunwoo Choi, György Fazekas, Mark Sandler, Brian McFee, Kyunghyun Cho.

Seq2seq models can be used to machine translation, where a phrase in a language is summarised by an encoder RNN, which is followed by a decoder RNN to generate a phrase in another language [4]. • Word2vec: Word embeddings are distributed vector representations of words that aim to preserve the semantic relationships among words. One successful example is word2vec algorithm, which is usually trained with large corpora in an unsupervised manner [13]. •ConvNets: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been extensively adopted in nearly every computer vision task and algorithm since the record-breaking performance of AlexNet [12]. ConvNets also show state-ofthe-art results in many music information retrieval tasks including auto-tagging [5]."

      "heading" : "2. PROBLEM DEFINITION",
      "text" : "The problem of music captioning can be defined as generating a description for a set of music items using on their audio content and text data. When the set includes more than one item, it can be also called as music playlist captioning."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3. THE PROPOSED METHOD",
      "text" : "Both of the approaches use sequence-to-sequence model, as illustrated in Figure 2. In the sequence-to-sequence model, the encoder consists of two-layer RNN with GRU and encodes the track features into a vector, i.e., the encoded vector summarises the information of the input. This vector is also called context vector because it provides context\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n04 86\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.M M\n] 1\n7 A\nug 2\n01 6\ninformation to the decoder. The decoder consists of twolayer RNN with GRU and decodes the context vector to a sequence of word or word embeddings. The models are written in Keras and uploaded online 3 [6]."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.1 Pre-training approach",
      "text" : "This approach takes advantage of a pre-trained word embedding model 4 and a pre-trained auto-tagger 5 . Therefore, the number of parameters to learn is reduced while leveraging additional data to train word-embedding and auto-tagger. Each data sample consists of a sequence of N track features as input and an output word sequence length of M , which is an album feature.\nInput/Output 6 : A n-th track feature, tn ∈ R350, represents one track and is created by concatenating the audio feature, tna ∈ R50, and the word feature, tnw ∈ R300, i.e. t = [ta;tw]. For computing ta, a convolutional neural network that is trained to predict tags is used to output 50-dim vector for each track [5]. tw is computed by ∑ k wk/K, where wk refers to the embedding of k-th word in the metadata 7 . The word embedding were trained by word2vec algorithms and Google news dataset [13].\nAn playlist feature is a sequence of word embeddings of the playlist description, i.e. p = [wm]m=0,1,..m−1.\n3 http://github.com/keunwoochoi/ ismir2016-ldb-audio-captioning-model-keras\n4 https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ word2vec.html\n5 https://github.com/keunwoochoi/music-auto_ tagging-keras, [5]\n6 The dimensions can vary, we describe in details for better understanding.\n7 Because these word embeddings are distributed representations in a semantic vector space, average of the words can summarise a bag of words and was used as a baseline in sentence and paragraph representation [7]."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.2 Fully-training approach",
      "text" : "The model in this approach includes the training of a ConvNet for audio summarisation and an RNN for text summarisation of each track. The structure of ConvNet can be similar to the pre-trained one. The RNN module is trained to summarise the text of each track and outputs a sentence vector. These networks can be provided with additional labels (notated as y in the figure 2) to help the training, e.g., genres or tags. In that case, the objective of the whole structure consists of two different tasks and therefore the training can be more regulated and stable.\nSince the audio and text summarisation modules are trainable, they can be more relevant to the captioning task. However, this flexibility requires more training data."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4. EXPERIMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "We tested the pre-training approach with a private production music dataset. The dataset has 374 albums and 17,354 tracks with descriptions of tracks, albums, audio signal and metadata. The learning rate is controlled by ADAM [11] with an objective function of 1-cosine proximity. The model was trained to predict the album descriptions.\nThe model currently overfits and fails to generate correct sentences. One example of generated word sequence is dramatic motivating the intense epic action adventure soaring soaring soaring gloriously Roger Deakins cinematography Maryse Alberti. This is expected since there are only 374 output sequences in the dataset – if we use early stopping, the model underfits, otherwise it overfits.\nIn the future, we plan to solve the current problem – lack of data. The sentence generation can be partly trained by (music) corpora. A word2vec model that is trained with music corpora can be used to reduce the embedding dimension [14]. The model can also be modified in the sense that the audio feature is optional and it mainly relies on metadata. In that case, acquisition of training data becomes more feasible."
