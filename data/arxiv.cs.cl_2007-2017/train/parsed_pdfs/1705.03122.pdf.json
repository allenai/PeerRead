      "text" : "Sequence to sequence learning has been successful in many tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition (Sutskever et al., 2014; Chorowski et al., 2015) and text summarization (Rush et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016) amongst others. The dominant approach to date encodes the input sequence with a series of bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNN) and generates a variable length output with another set of decoder RNNs, both of which interface via a soft-attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015). In machine translation, this architecture has been demonstrated to outperform traditional phrase-based models by large margins (Sennrich et al., 2016b; Zhou et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; §2).\n1The source code and models are available at https:// github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq.\nConvolutional neural networks are less common for sequence modeling, despite several advantages (Waibel et al., 1989; LeCun & Bengio, 1995). Compared to recurrent layers, convolutions create representations for fixed size contexts, however, the effective context size of the network can easily be made larger by stacking several layers on top of each other. This allows to precisely control the maximum length of dependencies to be modeled. Convolutional networks do not depend on the computations of the previous time step and therefore allow parallelization over every element in a sequence. This contrasts with RNNs which maintain a hidden state of the entire past that prevents parallel computation within a sequence.\nMulti-layer convolutional neural networks create hierarchical representations over the input sequence in which nearby input elements interact at lower layers while distant elements interact at higher layers. Hierarchical structure provides a shorter path to capture long-range dependencies compared to the chain structure modeled by recurrent networks, e.g. we can obtain a feature representation capturing relationships within a window of n words by applying only O(nk ) convolutional operations for a kernel of width k, compared to a linear number O(n) for recurrent neural networks. Inputs to a convolutional network are fed through a constant number of kernels and non-linearities, whereas recurrent networks apply up to n operations and non-linearities to the first word and only a single set of operations to the last word. Fixing the number of nonlinearities applied to the inputs also eases learning.\nRecent work has applied convolutional neural networks to sequence modeling such as Bradbury et al. (2016) who introduce recurrent pooling between a succession of convolutional layers or Kalchbrenner et al. (2016) who tackle neural translation without attention. However, none of these approaches has been demonstrated improvements over state of the art results on large benchmark datasets. Gated convolutions have been previously explored for machine translation by Meng et al. (2015) but their evaluation was restricted to a small dataset and the model was used in tandem with a traditional count-based model. Architec-\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n03 12\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nM ay\n2 01\ntures which are partially convolutional have shown strong performance on larger tasks but their decoder is still recurrent (Gehring et al., 2016).\nIn this paper we propose an architecture for sequence to sequence modeling that is entirely convolutional. Our model is equipped with gated linear units (Dauphin et al., 2016) and residual connections (He et al., 2015a). We also use attention in every decoder layer and demonstrate that each attention layer only adds a negligible amount of overhead. The combination of these choices enables us to tackle large scale problems (§3).\nWe evaluate our approach on several large datasets for machine translation as well as summarization and compare to the current best architectures reported in the literature. On WMT’16 English-Romanian translation we achieve a new state of the art, outperforming the previous best result by 1.8 BLEU. On WMT’14 English-German we outperform the strong LSTM setup of Wu et al. (2016) by 0.5 BLEU and on WMT’14 English-French we outperform the likelihood trained system of Wu et al. (2016) by 1.5 BLEU. Furthermore, our model can translate unseen sentences at an order of magnitude faster speed than Wu et al. (2016) on GPU and CPU hardware (§4, §5)."

      "heading" : "2. Recurrent Sequence to Sequence Learning",
      "text" : "Sequence to sequence modeling has been synonymous with recurrent neural network based encoder-decoder architectures (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014). The encoder RNN processes an input sequence x = (x1, . . . , xm) of m elements and returns state representations z = (z1. . . . , zm). The decoder RNN takes z and generates the output sequence y = (y1, . . . , yn) left to right, one element at a time. To generate output yi+1, the decoder computes a new hidden state hi+1 based on the previous state hi, an embedding gi of the previous target language word yi, as well as a conditional input ci derived from the encoder output z. Based on this generic formulation, various encoder-decoder architectures have been proposed, which differ mainly in the conditional input and the type of RNN.\nModels without attention consider only the final encoder state zm by setting ci = zm for all i (Cho et al., 2014), or simply initialize the first decoder state with zm (Sutskever et al., 2014), in which case ci is not used. Architectures with attention (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015) compute ci as a weighted sum of (z1. . . . , zm) at each time step. The weights of the sum are referred to as attention scores and allow the network to focus on different parts of the input sequence as it generates the output sequences. Attention scores are computed by essentially comparing each encoder state zj to a combination of the previous decoder\nstate hi and the last prediction yi; the result is normalized to be a distribution over input elements.\nPopular choices for recurrent networks in encoder-decoder models are long short term memory networks (LSTM; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and gated recurrent units (GRU; Cho et al., 2014). Both extend Elman RNNs (Elman, 1990) with a gating mechanism that allows the memorization of information from previous time steps in order to model long-term dependencies. Most recent approaches also rely on bi-directional encoders to build representations of both past and future contexts (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016). Models with many layers often rely on shortcut or residual connections (He et al., 2015a; Zhou et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016)."

We also equip our model with a sense of order by embedding the absolute position of input elements p = (p1, . . . , pm) where pj ∈ Rf . Both are combined to obtain input element representations e = (w1 + p1, . . . , wm + pm). We proceed similarly for output elements that were already generated by the decoder network to yield output element representations that are being fed back into the decoder network g = (g1, . . . , gn). Position embeddings are useful in our architecture since they give our model a sense of which portion of the sequence in the input or output it is currently dealing with (§5.3)."

      "heading" : "3.2. Convolutional Block Structure",
      "text" : "Both encoder and decoder networks share a simple block structure that computes intermediate states based on a fixed number of input elements. We denote the output of the lth block as hl = (hl1, . . . , h l n) for the decoder network, and zl = (zl1, . . . , z l m) for the encoder network; we refer to blocks and layers interchangeably. Each block contains a one dimensional convolution followed by a non-linearity. For a decoder network with a single block and kernel width k, each resulting state h1i contains information over k input elements. Stacking several blocks on top of each other increases the number of input elements represented in a state. For instance, stacking 6 blocks with k = 5 results in an input field of 25 elements, i.e. each output depends on 25\ninputs. Non-linearities allow the networks to exploit the full input field, or to focus on fewer elements if needed.\nEach convolution kernel is parameterized as W ∈ R2d×kd, bw ∈ R2d and takes as input X ∈ Rk×d which is a concatenation of k input elements embedded in d dimensions and maps them to a single output element Y ∈ R2d that has twice the dimensionality of the input elements; subsequent layers operate over the k output elements of the previous layer. We choose gated linear units (GLU; Dauphin et al., 2016) as non-linearity which implement a simple gating mechanism over the output of the convolution Y = [A B] ∈ R2d:\nv([A B]) = A⊗ σ(B)\nwhere A,B ∈ Rd are the inputs to the non-linearity, ⊗ is the point-wise multiplication and the output v([A B]) ∈ Rd is half the size of Y . The gates σ(B) control which inputs A of the current context are relevant. A similar nonlinearity has been introduced in Oord et al. (2016b) who apply tanh toA but Dauphin et al. (2016) shows that GLUs perform better in the context of language modelling.\nTo enable deep convolutional networks, we add residual connections from the input of each convolution to the output of the block (He et al., 2015a).\nhli = v(W l[hl−1i−k/2, . . . , h l−1 i+k/2] + b l w) + h l−1 i\nFor encoder networks we ensure that the output of the convolutional layers matches the input length by padding the input at each layer. However, for decoder networks we have to take care that no future information is available to the decoder (Oord et al., 2016a). Specifically, we pad the input by k − 1 elements on both the left and right side by zero vectors, and then remove k elements from the end of the convolution output.\nWe also add linear mappings to project between the embedding size f and the convolution outputs that are of size 2d. We apply such a transform to w when feeding embeddings to the encoder network, to the encoder output zuj , to the final layer of the decoder just before the softmax hL, and to all decoder layers hl before computing attention scores in (1).\nFinally, we compute a distribution over the T possible next target elements yi+1 by transforming the top decoder output hLi via a linear layer with weights Wo and bias bo:\np(yi+1|y1, . . . , yi,x) = softmax(WohLi + bo) ∈ RT"

To compute the attention, we combine the current decoder state hli with an embedding of the previous\ntarget element gi:\ndli = W l dh l i + b l d + gi (1)\nFor decoder layer l the attention alij of state i and source element j is computed as a dot-product between the decoder state summary dli and each output z u j of the last encoder block u:\nalij = exp\n( dli · zuj )∑m t=1 exp ( dli · zut\n) The conditional input cli for the current decoder layer is a weighted sum of the encoder outputs as well as the input element embeddings ej (Figure 1, center right).\ncli = m∑ j=1 alij(z u j + ej) (2)\nThis is slightly different to recurrent approaches which compute both the attention and the weighted sum over zuj\nonly. We found adding ej to be beneficial and it resembles key-value memory networks where the keys are the zuj and the values are the zuj + ej (Miller et al., 2016). Encoder outputs zuj represent potentially large input contexts and ej provides point information about a specific input element that is useful when making a prediction.\nOnce cli has been computed, it is simply added to the output of the corresponding decoder layer hli. This can be seen as attention with multiple ’hops’ (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) compared to single step attention (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016). In particular, the attention of the first layer determines a useful source context which is then fed to the second layer that takes this information into account when computing attention etc. The decoder also has immediate access to the attention history of the k − 1 previous time steps because the conditional inputs cl−1i−k, . . . , c l−1 i are part of hl−1i−k, . . . , h l−1 i which are input to h l i. This makes it easier for the model to take into account which previous inputs have been attended to already compared to recurrent nets where this information is in the recurrent state and needs to survive several non-linearities. Overall, our attention mechanism considers which words we previously attended to (Yang et al., 2016) and performs multiple attention ’hops’ per time step. In Appendix §C, we plot attention scores for a deep decoder and show that at different layers, significantly different portions of the source sentence encoding are attended to.\nOur convolutional architecture also allows to batch the attention computation across all elements of a sequence compared to RNNs (Figure 1, middle). For multi-hop attention we batch the computations of each decoder layer individually."

      "text" : "We stabilize learning through careful weight initialization (§3.5) and by scaling parts of the network to ensure that the variance throughout the network does not change dramatically. In particular, we scale the output of residual blocks as well as the attention to preserve the variance of activations. We multiply the sum of the input and output of a residual block by √ 0.5 to halve the variance of the sum. This assumes that both summands have the same variance which is not always true but effective in practice.\nThe conditional input cli generated by the attention is a weighted sum of m vectors (2) and we counteract a change in variance through scaling by m √ 1/m; we multiply by m to scale up the inputs to their original size, assuming the attention scores are uniformly distributed. This is generally not the case but we found this strategy to work well in practice.\nFor convolutional decoders with multiple attention, we scale the gradients for the encoder layers by the number of attention mechanisms we use; we exclude source word embeddings. We found this to stabilize learning since the encoder received too much gradient otherwise."

      "heading" : "3.5. Initialization",
      "text" : "Normalizing activations when adding the output of different layers, e.g. residual connections, requires careful weight initialization. The motivation for our initialization is the same as for the normalization: maintain the variance of activations throughout the forward and backward passes. All embeddings are initialized from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.1. For layers whose output is not directly fed to a gated linear unit, we initialize weights from N (0, √ 1/nl) where nl is the number of input connections for each neuron. This ensures that the variance of a normally distributed input is retained.\nFor layers which are followed by a GLU activation, we propose a weight initialization scheme by adapting the derivations in (He et al., 2015b; Glorot & Bengio, 2010; Appendix A). If the GLU inputs are distributed with mean 0 and have sufficiently small variance, then we can approximate the output variance with 1/4 of the input variance (Appendix A.1). Hence, we initialize the weights so that the input to the GLU activations have 4 times the variance of the layer input. This is achieved by drawing their initial values fromN (0, √ 4/nl). Biases are uniformly set to zero when the network is constructed.\nWe apply dropout to the input of some layers so that inputs are retained with a probability of p. This can be seen as multiplication with a Bernoulli random variable taking value 1/p with probability p and 0 otherwise (Srivastava et al., 2014). The application of dropout will then cause the variance to be scaled by 1/p. We aim to restore the incoming variance by initializing the respective layers with larger weights. Specifically, we useN (0, √ 4p/nl) for lay-\ners whose output is subject to a GLU and N (0, √ p/nl) otherwise (Appendix A.3)."

CPU timings are measured on one host with 48 hyperthreaded cores (Intel Xeon E5-2680 @ 2.50GHz) with 40 workers.

We use a target vocabulary of 160K words as well as vocabulary selection (Mi et al., 2016; L’Hostis et al., 2016) to decrease the size of the output layer which speeds up training and testing. The average vocabulary size for each training batch is about 20K target words. All figures are averaged over three runs (§4) and BLEU is reported on newstest2014 before unknown word replacement.\nWe start with an experiment that removes the position embeddings from the encoder and decoder (§3.1). These embeddings allow our model to identify which portion of the source and target sequence it is dealing with but also impose a restriction on the maximum sentence length. Table 3 shows that position embeddings are helpful but that our model still performs well without them. Removing the source position embeddings results in a larger accuracy decrease than target position embeddings. However, removing both source and target positions decreases accuracy only by 0.5 BLEU. We had assumed that the model would not be able to calibrate the length of the output sequences very well without explicit position information, however, the output lengths of models without position embeddings closely matches models with position information. This indicates that the models can learn relative position information within the contexts visible to the encoder and decoder networks which can observe up to 27 and 25 words respectively.\nRecurrent models typically do not use explicit position embeddings since they can learn where they are in the sequence through the recurrent hidden state computation. In our setting, the use of position embeddings requires only a\nAttn Layers PPL BLEU"

The computation also takes into account contexts computed for preceding decoder layers of the current time step as well as previous time steps that are within the receptive field of the decoder. How does multiple attention compare to attention in fewer layers or even only in a single layer as is usual? Table 4 shows that attention in all decoder layers achieves the best validation perplexity (PPL). Furthermore, removing more and more attention layers decreases accuracy, both in terms of BLEU as well as PPL.\nThe computational overhead for attention is very small compared to the rest of the network. Training with attention in all five decoder layers processes 3624 target words per second on average on a single GPU, compared to 3772 words per second for attention in a single layer. This is only a 4% slow down when adding 4 attention modules. Most neural machine translation systems only use a single module. This demonstrates that attention is not the bottleneck in neural machine translation, even though it is quadratic in the sequence length (cf. Kalchbrenner et al., 2016). Part of the reason for the low impact on speed is that we batch the computation of an attention module over all target words, similar to Kalchbrenner et al. (2016). However, for RNNs batching of the attention may be less effective because of the dependence on the previous time step."

Decoder setups with two layers already perform well whereas for the encoder accuracy keeps increasing steadily with more layers until up to 9 layers when accuracy starts to plateau.\nAside from increasing the depth of the networks, we can also change the kernel width. Table 6 shows that encoders with narrow kernels and many layers perform better than wider kernels. These networks can also be faster since the amount of work to compute a kernel operating over 3 input elements is less than half compared to kernels over 7 elements. We see a similar picture for decoder networks with large kernel sizes (Table 7). Dauphin et al.

      "heading" : "A. Weight Initialization",
      "text" : "We derive a weight initialization scheme tailored to the GLU activation function similar to Glorot & Bengio (2010); He et al. (2015b) by focusing on the variance of activations within the network for both forward and backward passes. We also detail how we modify the weight initialization for dropout.\nA.1. Forward Pass\nAssuming that the inputs xl of a convolutional layer l and its weights Wl are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the variance of its output, computed as yl = Wlxl+ bl, is\nV ar [ yl ] = nlV ar [ wlxl ] (3)\nwhere nl is the number inputs to the layer. For onedimensional convolutional layers with kernel width k and input dimension c, this is kc. We adopt the notation in (He et al., 2015b), i.e. yl, wl and xl represent the random variables in yl, Wl and xl. With wl and xl independent from each other and normally distributed with zero mean, this amounts to\nV ar [ yl ] = nlV ar [ wl ] V ar [ xl ] . (4)\nxl is the result of the GLU activation function yal−1 σ(y b l−1) with yl−1 = (y a l−1,y b l−1), and y a l−1,y b l−1 i.i.d. Next, we formulate upper and lower bounds in order to approximate V ar[xl]. If yl−1 follows a symmetric distribution with mean 0, then\nV ar [ xl ] = V ar [ yal−1 σ(y b l−1) ] (5)\n= E [( yal−1 σ(y b l−1) )2]− E2[yal−1 σ(ybl−1)] (6)\n= V ar[yal−1]E [ σ(ybl−1) 2 ] . (7)\nA lower bound is given by (1/4)V ar[yal−1] when expanding (6) with E2[σ(ybl−1)] = 1/4:\nV ar [ xl ] = V ar [ yal−1 σ(y b l−1) ] (8)\n= V ar [ yal−1 ] E2 [ σ(ybl−1) ] +\nV ar [ yal−1 ] V ar [ σ(ybl−1) ] (9) = 1\n4 V ar\n[ yal−1 ] + V ar [ yal−1 ] V ar [ σ(ybl−1) ] (10)\nand V ar[yal−1]V ar[σ(y b l−1)] > 0. We utilize the relation σ(x)2 ≤ (1/16)x2 − 1/4 + σ(x) (Appendix B) to provide an upper bound on E[σ(x)2]:\nE[σ(x)2] ≤ E [ 1 16 x2 − 1 4 + σ(x) ] (11)\n= 1 16 E[x2]− 1 4 + E[σ(x)] (12)\nWith x ∼ N (0, std(x)), this yields\nE [ σ(x)2 ] ≤ 1 16 E [ x2 ] − 1 4 + 1 2 (13)\n= 1\n16 V ar\n[ x ] + 1\n4 . (14)\nWith (7) and V ar[yal−1] = V ar[y b l−1] = V ar[yl−1], this results in\nV ar [ xl ] ≤ 1\n16 V ar\n[ yl−1 ]2 + 1\n4 V ar\n[ yl−1 ] . (15)\nWe initialize the embedding matrices in our network with small variances (around 0.01), which allows us to dismiss the quadratic term and approximate the GLU output variance with\nV ar[xl] ≈ 1\n4 V ar[yl−1]. (16)\nIf L network layers of equal size and with GLU activations are combined, the variance of the final output yL is given by\nV ar[yL] ≈ V ar[y1]  L∏ l=2 1 4 nlV ar[wl]  . (17) Following (He et al., 2015b), we aim to satisfy the condition\n1 4 nlV ar\n[ wl ] = 1,∀l (18)\nso that the activations in a network are neither exponentially magnified nor reduced. This is achieved by initializing Wl from N (0, √ 4/nl).\nA.2. Backward Pass\nThe gradient of a convolutional layer is computed via backpropagation as ∆xl = Ŵlyl. Considering separate gradients ∆yal and ∆y b l for GLU, the gradient of x is given by\n∆xl = Ŵ a l ∆y a l + Ŵ b l ∆y b l . (19)\nŴ corresponds to W with re-arranged weights to enable back-propagation. Analogously to the forward pass, ∆xl, ŵl and ∆yl represent the random variables for the values in ∆xl, Ŵl and ∆yl, respectively. Note that W and Ŵ contain the same values, i.e. ŵ = w. Similar to (3), the variance of ∆xl is\nV ar[∆xl] = n̂l ( V ar[wal ]V ar[∆y a l ] + V ar[w b l ]V ar[∆y b l ] ) . (20) Here, n̂l is the number of inputs to layer l+1. The gradients for the GLU inputs are:\n∆yal = ∆xl+1 σ(y b l ) and (21) ∆ybl = ∆xl+1y a l σ ′(ybl ). (22)\nThe approximation for the forward pass can be used for V ar[∆yal ], and for estimating V ar[∆y b l ] we assume an upper bound on E[σ′(ybl ) 2] of 1/16 since σ′(ybl ) ∈ [0, 14 ]. Hence,\nV ar[∆yal ]− 1\n4 V ar[∆xl+1] ≤\n1\n16 V ar[∆xl+1]V ar[y\nb l )]\n(23)\nV ar[∆ybl ] ≤ 1\n16 ∆V ar[∆xl+1]V ar[y\na l ] (24)\nWe observe relatively small gradients in our network, typically around 0.001 at the start of training. Therefore, we approximate by discarding the quadratic terms above, i.e.\nV ar[∆yal ] ≈ 1\n4 V ar[∆xl+1] (25)\nV ar[∆ybl ] ≈ 0 (26)\nV ar[∆xl] ≈ 1\n4 n̂lV ar[w\na l ]V ar[∆xl+1] (27)\nAs for the forward pass, the above result can be generalized to backpropagation through many successive layers, resulting in\nV ar[∆x2] ≈ V ar[∆xL+1]  L∏ l=2 1 4 n̂lV ar[w a l ]  (28) and a similar condition, i.e. (1/4)n̂lV ar[wal ] = 1. In the networks we consider, successions of convolutional layers usually operate on the same number of inputs so that most cases nl = n̂l. Note that W bl is discarded in the approximation; however, for the sake of consistency we use the same initialization for W al and W b l .\nFor arbitrarily large variances of network inputs and activations, our approximations are invalid; in that case, the initial values for W al and W b l would have to be balanced for the input distribution to be retained. Alternatively, methods that explicitly control the variance in the network, e.g. batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) or layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) could be employed.\nA.3. Dropout\nDropout retains activations in a neural network with a probability p and sets them to zero otherwise (Srivastava et al., 2014). It is common practice to scale the retained activations by 1/p during training so that the weights of the network do not have to be modified at test time when p is set to 1. In this case, dropout amounts to multiplying activations x by a Bernoulli random variable r where Pr[r = 1/p] = p and Pr[r = 0] = 1 − p (Srivastava et al., 2014). It holds that E[r] = 1 and V ar[r] = (1− p)/p. If x is independent\nof r and E[x] = 0, the variance after dropout is\nV ar[xr] = E[r]2V ar[x] + V ar[r]V ar[x] (29)\n= ( 1 +\n1− p p\n) V ar[x] (30)\n= 1\np V ar[x] (31)\nAssuming that a the input of a convolutional layer has been subject to dropout with a retain probability p, the variations of the forward and backward activations from §A.1 and §A.2 can now be approximated with\nV ar[xl+1] ≈ 1\n4p nlV ar[wl]V ar[xl] and (32)\nV ar[∆xl] ≈ 1\n4p nlV ar[w\na l ]V ar[∆xl+1]. (33)\nThis amounts to a modified initialization of Wl from a normal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation of√\n4p/n. For layers without a succeeding GLU activation function, we initialize weights from N (0, √ p/n) to calibrate for any immediately preceding dropout application."

The attention passes in different decoder layers capture different portions of the source sentence. Layer 1, 3\nand 6 exhibit a linear alignment. The first layer shows the clearest alignment, although it is slightly off and frequently attends to the corresponding source word of the previously generated target word. Layer 2 and 8 lack a clear structure and are presumably collecting information about the whole source sentence. The fourth layer shows high alignment scores on nouns such as “festival”, “way” and “work” for both the generated target nouns as well as their preceding words. Note that in German, those preceding words depend on gender and object relationship of the respective noun. Finally, the attention scores in layer 5 and 7 focus on “built”, which is reordered in the German translation and is moved from the beginning to the very end of the sentence. One interpretation for this is that as generation progresses, the model repeatedly tries to perform the re-ordering. “aufgebaut” can be generated after a noun or pronoun only, which is reflected in the higher scores at positions 2, 5, 8, 11 and 13."

We introduce an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks.1 Compared to recurrent models, computations over all elements can be fully parallelized during training and optimization is easier since the number of non-linearities is fixed and independent of the input length. Our use of gated linear units eases gradient propagation and we equip each decoder layer with a separate attention module. We outperform the accuracy of the deep LSTM setup of Wu et al. (2016) on both WMT’14 EnglishGerman and WMT’14 English-French translation at an order of magnitude faster speed, both on GPU and CPU.",
