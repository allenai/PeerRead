      "text" : "Machine translation is one of the important and traditional NLP tasks which aims to translate one source-language sentence into the corresponding\n*Wei Chen is the corresponding author of this paper\ntarget-language sentence automatically. Recently, with the rapid development of deep neural network, the neural machine translation (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Ranzato et al., 2015) which leverages a single neural network directly to transform the source sentence into the target sentence, has obtained state-of-the-art performance for several language pairs (Wu et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Bradbury and Socher, 2016). This end-toend NMT typically consists of two recurrent neural networks. The encoder network reads and encodes the source sentence into the context vector representation; and a decoder network generates the target sentence word by word based on the context vector. To dynamically generate a context vector for a target word being generated, the attention mechanism is usually deployed. Optimization for this NMT model is to directly maximize the likelihood of the training data. Specifically, at each decoding step, the NMT model is optimized to maximize the likelihood of the ground word at the current step. (Ranzato et al., 2015) indicates that loss function of the maximum likelihood estimation is only defined at the word level instead of sentence level. Hence the NMT model may generate the best candidate word for the current time step but a bad component of the whole sentence in the long run. (Shen et al., 2015) gives a solution by introducing the minimum risk training from the statistical machine translation (SMT). They incorporate the sentence-level BLEU (Chen and Cherry, 2014) into the loss function. Hence the NMT model is optimized to generate sentence which has higher BLEU point. As ar X iv :1 70 3. 04 88 7v 1 [ cs .C L ] 1 5 M\nar 2\nthe BLEU point is computed as the geometric mean of the modified n-gram precisions (Papineni et al., 2002), we conclude that almost all of the prior NMT models are trained to cover more n-grams with the ground target sentence (MLE can be viewed as training the NMT to cover more 1-gram with the target sentence).\nHowever, it is widely acknowledged that high n-gram precisions don’t ensure a better sentence (Callison-Burch and Osborne, 2006; Chatterjee et al., 2007). Additionally, the manually defined loss function is unable to cover all crucial aspects and the NMT model may be trained to deviate from the data distribution and generate suboptimal sentences. Intuitively, The model should be trained to directly generate a human-like sentence instead of covering the human designed approximation features. From the Turing test perspective, we should enlighten the model to be aware of what is the human-generated sentence like and to generate the sentence indistinguishable form the human-generated one. Based on the analysis above, we propose that a good training objective for NMT includes: 1) The loss function should be defined on the sentence level instead of the word level; 2) No manually defined approximation feature is used to guide the NMT model; 3) The NMT model should be directly exposed to the true data distribution. Specifically, the model should be trained to directly generate the human-generated sentence and if one poor sentence is generated, the model should be penalized with how far the poor sentence is from the human-generated one.\nBorrowing the idea of generative adversarial training in computer vision (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Denton et al., 2015), we build a conditional sequence generative adversarial nets (CSGAN) which implements the training objective mentioned above. In the proposed CSGAN-NMT, we jointly train two models, a generator (implemented as the traditional NMT model) which generates the target-language sentence based on the input source-language sentence, and a discriminator which conditioned on the source-language sentence, predicts the probability of the target-language sentence being a humangenerated one. During the training process, the generator tries to fool the discriminator into believing that its output is a human-generated sentence, and the discriminator makes effort not to be fooled\nby improving its ability to distinguish the machinegenerated sentence from the human-generated one. This kind of adversarial training achieves a winwin situation when the generator and discriminator reaches a Nash Equilibrium (Zhao et al., 2016).\nIn summary, we mainly make the following contributions:\n• To directly train the NMT model to output the human-generated sentences, we firstly, to the best of our knowledge, introduce the generative adversarial training into NMT. We build a conditional generative adversarial nets which can be applied to any end-to-end NMT systems. We do not assume the specific architectures of NMT.\n• The extensive experiments on Chinese-toEnglish translation tasks show that the proposed CSGAN-NMT significantly outperforms the strong attention-based NMT model. We present detailed, quantitative results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CSGAN-NMT. This indicates the feasibility of applying the GANs into NLP tasks.\n• We successfully leverage the discriminator to clean the training data.\n• We test different architectures for the discriminator, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based and the recurrent neural network (RNN based one. We found that the RNNs are not applicable in the discriminator.\n• We report our specific training strategies for the proposed CSGAN-NMT. This provides a new reliable route for applying generative adversarial nets into the NLP tasks."

The conditional generative adversarial nets apply an extension of generative adversarial network to a conditional setting, which enables the networks to condition on some arbitrary external data.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, this idea has not been applied in traditional NLP tasks with\ncomparable success and few quantitative experimental result has been reported. Some recent work has begun to apply the generative adversarial training into the NLP area: (Chen et al., 2016) apply the idea of generative adversarial training to sentiment analysis and (Zhang et al., 2017) use the idea to domain adaptation tasks.For sequence generation problem, (Yu et al., 2016) leverage policy gradient reinforcement learning to back-propagate the reward from the discriminator, showing presentable results for poem generation, speech language generation and music generation. Similarly, (Zhang et al., 2016) generate the text from random noise via adversarial training. A striking difference from works mentioned above, our work is in the conditional settings where the target-language sentence are generated conditioned on the source-language one.\nIn parallel to our work, (Li et al., 2017) propose a similar conditional sequence generative adversarial training for dialogue generation. They use a hierarchical LSTM architecture for the discriminator. In contrast to their approach, we apply the CNNbased discriminator for the machine translation task. Furthermore, we present detailed training strategies for the proposed model and extensive quantitative results are reported."

      "text" : "Recently, the deep discriminative models such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) have shown a high performance in complicated sequence classification tasks. To test the efficacy of the discriminator, we propose two different architectures for the discriminator: the CNN-based and RNN-based one.\nCNN-based Since the generated sentence has a variable length, the CNN padding is used to transform the sentence to a sequence with the fixed length T , which is the maximum length for the input sequence set by the user beforehand. Given the sourcelanguage sequence x1, . . . , xT and target-language sequence y1, . . . , yT , we build the source matrix X1:T and target matrix Y1:T respectively as:\nX1:T = x1;x2; . . . ;xT (7)\nand Y1:T = y1; y2; . . . ; yT (8)\nwhere xt, yt ∈ Rk is the k-dimensional word embedding and the semicolon is the concatenation operator. For the source matrix X1:T , a kernel wj ∈ Rl×k applies a convolutional operation to a window size of l words to produce a series of feature maps:\ncji = ρ(BN(wj ⊗Xi:i+l−1 + b)) (9)\nwhere ⊗ operator is the summation of element-wise production and b is a bias term. ρ is a non-linear activation function which is implemented as ReLU in this paper. Note that the batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), which accelerates the training significantly, is applied to the input of the activation function (BN in equation 9). To get the final feature with respect to kernel wj , a max-over-time pooling operation is leveraged over the feature maps:\nc̃j = max{cj1, . . . , cjT−l+1} (10)\nWe use various numbers of kernels with different window sizes to extract different features, which are\n*https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-tutorial\nfinally concatenated to form the vector representation for the source-language sentence cx. Identically, the target-language sentence representation cy can be extracted from the target matrix Y1:T . Finally, given the source-language sentence, the probability that the target-language sentence is being real can be computed as:\np = σ(V [cx; cy]) (11)\nwhere V is the transform matrix which transforms the concatenation of cx and cy into a 2-dimension embedding and σ is the logistic function. The CNNbased discriminator is depicted as figure 1\nRNN-based Recurrent neural network has several different formations, such as the long shortterm memory network (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU) and the simple recurrent neural network (simple-RNN). This paper takes the LSTM as a instance. Given the source-language sequence x1, . . . , xs, a LSTM is used to map the sequence into a sequence of hidden states h1, . . . , hs by leveraging the update function of LSTM cells recursively:\nht = lstm(ht−1, xt) (12)\nThe vector representation for the source-language sentence cx is computed as the average of the hidden states. The sentence vector for the target sentence cy is computed by the same way. Finally, the probability that the target-language sentence is being real is computed as equation 11. We also take the bidirectional LSTM as an alternative for LSTM. The graphical illustration of the BiLSTM-based discriminator is depicted as figure 2."

      "text" : "Following (Yu et al., 2016), the objective of the generator G is defined as to generate a sequence from the start state to maximize its expected end reward. Formally, the objective function is computed as:\nJ(θ) = ∑ yt Gθ(yt|y1:t−1, x) ·RGθD ((y1:t−1, x), yt) (13)\nwhere RGθD is the action-value function of a targetlanguage sentence given the source sentence, i.e. the expected accumulative reward starting from the state\n(y1:t−1, x), taking action yt, and following the policy Gθ. To estimate the action-value function, we consider the estimated probability of being real by the discriminator D as the reward:\nRGθD ((y1:T−1, x), yT ) = D(x, y1:T )− b(x, y1:T ) (14)\nwhere b(x,y) denotes the baseline value to reduce the variance of the reward. Practically, we take b(x,y) as a constant, 0.5 for simplicity. The question is that, given the source sequence, the discriminator D only provides a reward value for a finished target sequence. If y1:T is not a finished target sequence, the value of D(x, y1:T ) makes no sense. Therefore, we can’t get the action-value for an intermediate state directly. To evaluate the action-value for an intermediate state, the Monte Carlo search under the policy of G is applied to sample the unknown tokens. Each search ends when the end of sentence token is sampled or the sampled sentence meets the maximum length. To obtain more stable reward and reduce the variance, we represent an N-time Monte Carlo search as:\n{y11:L1 , . . . , y N 1:LN } =MCGθ((y1:t, x), N) (15)\nwhere Li represents the length of the sentence sampled by the i’th Monte Carlo search. (y1:t, x) = (y1, . . . , yt, x) is the current state and yNt+1:LN is sampled based on the policy G. The discriminator provides N rewards for the N sampled sentences respectively. The final reward for the intermediate state is calculated as the average of the N rewards.\nHence, for the target sentence with the length L, we get:\nRGθD ((y1:t−1, x), yt) = (16){ 1 N N∑ n=1 D(x, yn1:Ln)− b(x, y n 1:Ln ), yn1:Ln ∈MC Gθ ((y1:t, x), N) for t < L\nD(x, y1:t)− b(x, y1:t) for t = L\nUsing the discriminator as a reward function can further improve the generator iteratively by dynamically updating discriminator. Once we get more realistic generated sequences, we re-train the discriminator as:\nmin−Ex,y∈pdata [logD(x, y)]− Ex,y∈G[log(1−D(x, y))] (17)\nAfter updating the discriminator, we are ready to retrain the generator. Following (Yu et al., 2016), the gradient of the objective function J(θ) w.r.t the generator’s parameter θ is calculated as:\n∇J(θ) = ∑ yt RGθD (y1:t−1, x) · ∇θ log(Gθ(yt|y1:t−1, x))\n= ∑ yt RGθD (y1:t−1, x) · ∇θ log p(yt|y1:t−1, x) (18)"

      "text" : "It is hard to train the generative adversarial networks since the generator and discriminator need to be carefully synchronized. To make this work easier to reproduce, this paper gives detailed strategies for training the CSGAN-NMT model.\nFirstly, we use the maximum likelihood estimation to pre-train the generator on the parallel training set s until the best translation performance (measured by BLEU metric) is achieved.\nThen, generate the machine-generated sentences by using the generator to decode the training data. We simply use the greedy sampling method instead of the beam search method for decoding. Hence, it is very fast to decode all of the training set.\nNext, pre-train the discriminator on the combination of the true parallel data and the machinegenerated data until the classification accuracy achieves at f .\nFinally, we jointly train the generator and discriminator. The generator is trained with the policy gradient training method. We randomly sample a batch of source sentence from s as the training examples for the generator and the batch size is βg. Note that the target sentences are useless when the the generator is undergoing the policy gradient training. However, in our practice, we find that updating the generator only with the simple policy gradient training leads to unstable training. The translation performance goes down sharply after a few updating. We conjecture that this is because the generator can only indirectly access to the golden target sentence through the reward passed back from the discriminator, and this reward is used only to promote or discourage the machine-generated sentences. To alleviate this issue, we adopt the professor forcing approach which is similar to (Lamb et al., 2016). We directly make the discriminator to automatically assign a reward of 1 to the golden target-language sentence and the generator uses this reward to update itself on the true parallel examples. We run the professor forcing training for one time once the generator is updated by the policy gradient training. After the generator gets updated, we use the new stronger generator to generate η more realistic sentences, which are then used to train the discriminator. The batch size for training the discriminator is referred as βd. Following (Arjovsky et al., 2017), we clamp the weights of the discriminator to a fixed box ( [− , ] ) after each gradient update. We perform one optimization step for the discriminator for each step of the generator.\nIn our practice, we set f as 0.82, βg as 100, βd as 64, η as 5000, as 1 and the N for Monte\nCarlo search as 20. We use the Adam optimization method, with the initial learning rate 0.001, for the pre-training of the generator and discriminator. However, when generative adversarial training, we use the RMSProp optimization method, with the initial learning rate 0.0001, for the generator and discriminator."

Even more striking, the performance of the discriminator which based on the BiLSTM collapse sharply after several time\nsteps. The training for the RNN-based discriminator is not stable. On the contrary, the CNN-based discriminator performs very well. Empirically, with a few times of updating, the classification accuracy of RNN-based discriminators can easily achieves as high as 0.9, which is too strong for the generator. The sentences generated by the generator can be easily detected by the strong discriminator and the generator is discouraged all the time.

Compared to the baseline model, the proposed CSGAN-NMT model leads to improvement up to +1.6 BLEU points on average (see (1) and (3) in table 1).

To dispel this doubt and verify the efficacy of the proposed model, we use stochastic gradient descend optimization method (with the learning rate of 0.0001 which is used in CSGAN-\nNMT) to finetune the baseline model and we only get +0.7 BLEU points improvement (see (2) in table 1). There is a gap as large as 1.0 BLEU points on average (0.71 vs 1.62) between the finetuned baseline model and the CSGAN-NMT model (see (2) and (3) in table 1). Additionally, we get another +0.4 BLEU points improvement when running the CSGAN-NMT on the basis of the finetuned baseline model (see (2) and (4) in table 1).

Two traditional NMT models are trained on the data set s1 and s2 respectively. The results are reported in table 3.

In this work, we build a conditional sequence generative adversarial net which comprises of two adversarial sub models, a generative model (generator) which translates the source sentence into the target sentence as the traditional NMT models do and a discriminative model (discriminator) which discriminates the machinetranslated target sentence from the humantranslated sentence. From the perspective of Turing test, the proposed model is to generate the translation which is indistinguishable from the human-translated one. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements than the traditional NMT model. In Chinese-English translation tasks, we obtain up to +2.0 BLEU points improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the quantitative results about the application of GANs in the traditional NLP task is reported. Meanwhile, we present detailed strategies for GAN training. In addition, We find that the discriminator of the proposed model shows great capability in data cleaning.",
