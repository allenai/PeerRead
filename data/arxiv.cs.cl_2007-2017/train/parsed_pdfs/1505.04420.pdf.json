      "text" : "This thesis presents a study about the integration of information about Multiword\nExpressions (MWEs) into parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). We build on previous work by Nivre and Nilsson (2004) and by Korkontzelos and Manandhar (2010) who have shown the benefit of adding information about MWEs to syntactic parsing by implementing a similar pipeline with CCG parsing. More specifically, we collapse MWEs to one token in training and test data in CCGbank, a corpus automatically created by Hockenmaier (2003) which contains sentences annotated with CCG derivations. Our collapsing algorithm however can only deal with MWEs when they form a constituent in the data which is one of the limitations of our approach.\nWe study the effect of collapsing training and test data. A parsing effect can\nbe obtained if collapsed data help the parser in its decisions and a training effect can be obtained if training on the collapsed data improves results. We also collapse the gold standard and show that our model significantly outperforms the baseline model on our gold standard, which indicates that there is a training effect. We show that the baseline model performs significantly better on our gold standard when the data are collapsed before parsing than when the data are collapsed after parsing which indicates that there is a parsing effect. We show that these results can lead to improved performance on the non-collapsed standard benchmark although we fail to show that it does so significantly. We conclude that despite the limited settings, there are noticeable improvements from using MWEs in parsing. We discuss ways in which the incorporation of MWEs into parsing can be improved and hypothesize that this will lead to more substantial results.\nWe finally show that turning the MWE recognition part of the pipeline into an\nexperimental part is a useful thing to do as we obtain different results with different recognizers.\ni"

      "text" : "Syntactic parsing is the task of analysing the relationships between words in a\nsentence and thereby giving a compositional account of sentences. Syntactic parsing is considered a central task in Natural Language Processing (henceforth, NLP) and is used in many applications. It is a central but difficult task partly because it requires a lot of annotated data. Ground-breaking research in the 1990s have shown impressive results on this task but the major efforts have been directed to parsing on a specific domain (news) and a specific language (Enlglish) and the problem is far from being solved.\nMultiword Expressions (henceforth MWE(s)) are increasingly receiving atten-\ntion in NLP. They represent a wide variety of phenomena with different properties but are generally agreed to be a group of multiple lexemes which have some level of idiomaticity or irregularity (Sag et al., 2001). They represent varied phenomena but they are all generally considered a problem for NLP tasks and they are often a problem for syntactic parsing.\nRecent research is showing that information about MWEs help the syntactic pars-\ning task (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004; Korkontzelos and Manandhar, 2010) and inversely, information about syntactic analysis helps MWE identification (Green et al., 2013; Weller and Heid, 2010; Martens and Vandeghinste, 2010). Working on either of the task by using information from the other has thus been proven to be a useful thing to do in improving either of the other task and adding MWE information to the syntactic parsing task has proven useful in that it has helped increasing parsing accuracy. Work on adding MWE information to syntactic parsing so far has been restricted to certain\n1\nChapter 1. Introduction 2\ntypes of MWEs and hence leaves a lot of room for improvement.\nCombinatory Categorial Grammar (henceforth CCG) is a strongly lexicalized\nformalism that is increasingly being used for parsing in NLP applications because of its computational and linguistic properties and because it performs almost state-of-theart on the relatively accurate parses we have available for it.\nFor these reasons, CCG parsing is an ideal framework to carry on the work on the\ninteraction between syntactic parsing and Multiword Expressions and because CCG is a lexicalized formalism and thus encodes a lot of information in the lexicon, it would be useful to work on it by providing it with information about MWEs."

      "text" : "No work so far has tried to use MWE information to improve CCG parsing which\nis what we intend to do in this thesis. Different approaches to using MWE information for improving syntactic parsing have been conducted so far with different syntactic models and we will be conducting one of them which will argued to be far from ideal but a necessary first step useful to build a sound baseline. The approach we will be conducting consists in altering training and test data, i.e. collapsing MWEs to one lexical item in them. By collapsing we mean grouping MWEs together so that they form one token, and hence retokenize the sentence. We will be using this term in the remainder of the thesis. A change in the approach we will propose is to make MWE recognition an experimental part of the pipeline so that we can find out whether or not conducting this type of approach on different types of MWEs lead to different results.\nThe two research questions we will therefore try to answer are first whether or\nnot we can improve CCG parsing with MWEs and second whether or not applying the same collapsing approach to different types of MWEs lead to different results."

      "heading" : "2.2 Syntactic Parsing",
      "text" : "As said in the introduction, syntactic parsing is the task of analysing the rela-\ntionships between words in a sentence and thereby giving a compositional account of sentences. It is considered by many (e.g. Clark (2010)) to be a central task in NLP, it is used in many applications such as Tree-based Machine Translation, Question Answering etc. and is a first step towards semantic analysis. This compositional account can take the form of a Phrase Structure Tree or a Dependency Graph.\nA syntactic parser has two essential components: a grammar which determines\nthe set of possible sentences in a language and an algorithm that determines the grammar rules that are applied for each word in the sentence. Early research (Church and Patil, 1982) has shown that existing grammars are highly ambiguous and has called for the need for two more components: a probability model for scoring the different\n3\nChapter 2. Related Work 4\npossible parses and an algorithm for choosing the best scoring parse. Most parsing models include these 4 components.\nMost work on syntactic parsing is based on a manually annotated corpus, the\nPenn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) which has been used to infer a probabilistic model together with a Context Free Grammar (henceforth CFG) or a PCFG . There is ongoing work which is an exception to that tendency: work on parsing with precision grammars, i.e. hand-crafted grammars which are written so as to distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences, such as Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (henceforth HPSG). The CKY algorithm, a chart-based algorithm has been widely used to determine the possible parse trees by building them bottom-up, i.e. from the leaf nodes to the sentence node. Ground-breaking research on the PTB was made in the late 90s for example by Collins (Collins, 1996, 1997, 2003). In his seminal work, Collins formally defined the parsing problem as in Equation 2.1, in which Tbest is the best scoring parse tree among all the parse trees T for the sentence S. This is called a generative model: it models the sentence and the tree in a joint way and heavily relies on independence assumptions: it decomposes the probability of the tree into probabilities of rule application.\nT best = argmax T P(T,S) (2.1)\nSyntactic parsing has traditionally been evaluated by computing parsing accu-\nracy and parsing accuracy has traditionally been measured with the PARSEVAL metric (Black et al., 1991). This parsing accuracy measure is obtained by comparing output parse trees with the treebank gold standard: labelled precision and recall of nodes in the trees are computed as well as their F-measure. Collins reported parsing accuracy results of over 90% which were then slightly improved by Charniak and Johnson (2005). Since these early results however, a lot has been tried but not a lot of improvement has been made which highlights the difficulty of the task at hand. However, as pointed out by Clark (2010), research has shifted the focus away from building complex generative models to discriminative models, which estimate the probability of a parse tree for a sentence directly instead of estimating parse tree and sentence together, and which avoid independence assumptions. Research has also drawn attention to building grammars based on expressive formalisms such as Tree Adjoining Grammar (henceforth TAG), Lexical Functional Grammar (henceforth LFG), HPSG and CCG which offer more linguistically accurate representations of language. According to Nivre (2010), the tendency of using supervised methods for parsing is moving towards unsupervised methods such as in Spitkovsky et al. (2009). Some authors have given up on improv-\nChapter 2. Related Work 5\ning parsing accuracy directly but have tried working on it indirectly by working on it as a joint task together with another task such such as Burkett and Klein (2008) who show the benefit of combining Machine Translation and Syntactic Parsing as well as the work which has tried to improve Multiword Expression identification together with syntactic parsing, described in Section 2.5.\nIn any case, although the percentages obtained by the seminal works on genera-\ntive models may seem very high, syntactic parsing is far from being a solved problem, as argued by Clark (2010), because these percentages are inflated by recurring derivations and cannot deal with many important constructions. In addition, most work is focused on one domain and one language and need adaptation to other domains and languages which the lack of data make a problem hard to solve. Tremendous work is therefore still needed for syntactic parsing and the different shifts in research focus mentioned may still have a lot to offer."

      "heading" : "2.3 Multiword Expressions",
      "text" : "Multiword Expressions is an umbrella term that has been used to characterize\na wide variety of phenomena. The most commonly acknowledged definition of this term since Sag et al. (2001) is that it is a group of multiple lexemes which have some level of idiomaticity or irregularity. The multiple lexemes in a MWE will be called MWE units in the remainder of this thesis for convenience. This idiomaticity may be lexico-syntactic such as in the unusual coordination of a preposition and an adjective in ‘by and large’. It may be semantic such as in the idiom ‘kick the bucket’ in which the meaning of the whole is not dividable into the meaning of the parts. It may be pragmatic such as in ”good morning” which has a meaning attached to the situation in which it is said. Finally, it may be statistical such as the collocation ‘strong coffee’ in which both units occur more frequently than expected.\nMWEs are generally also agreed to display different properties. They vary\nin flexibility: words may appear between the units of a flexible collocation (strong home-made coffee for example) but not between the units of a lexically fixed figurative expression such as ‘it’s raining cats and dogs’. They also vary in compositionality: ‘Strong coffee’ is fully compositional whereas ‘kick the bucket’ is not and ‘spill the beans’ is semantically decomposable, i.e. the meaning of the whole is not predictable from the meaning of the parts but can be decomposed into its parts: if ‘spill’ is interpreted as ‘reveal’ and ‘the beans’ as ‘the secret’ (Nunberg, Geoffrey et al., 1994).\nChapter 2. Related Work 6\nDespite these varied properties they are all generally agreed to be a pain in the neck for NLP applications and the importance of dealing with them properly has been increasing over the past decade. As described at length in Kim’s (2008) thesis, ‘dealing with’ MWEs consists in developing systems and models for various kinds of tasks. For syntactic analysis, it is important to identify them in text and extract them to a dictionary. For semantic understanding, it is important to measure their compositionality, classify them and interpret them."

      "heading" : "2.4 Combinatory Categorial Grammar",
      "text" : "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 2000) is a strongly lexicalized\ngrammar formalism which is currently gaining popularity in the NLP community. It was built with the intent of being linguistically aware as well as computationally tractable partly as a reaction to transformationalist ideas which were predominant in formal grammars at the time. It differs mainly from these in having one component including syntactic and semantic information instead of having separate modules for each in the grammar. Similarly, instead of having a large amount of rules and a lexicon as is the case in traditional grammars, it has a small set of universal rules and a lexicon which encodes most syntactic information. For the sentence ‘John buys shares’, a traditional grammar has information in the lexicon: that John is an NP, that buys is a verb, that shares is an NP, and in the grammar: that a V and an NP form a VP and that an NP and a VP form a sentence S, as in Figure 2.1. By contrast, for the same sentence, CCG has information in its lexicon that John is an NP, that shares is an NP and that buys first takes an NP to its right then an NP to its left to form a sentence S, as in Figure 2.2.\nS\nVP\nNP\nshares\nV\nbuys\nNP\nJohn\nFigure 2.1: Traditional tree\nI will not go into details on how this exactly works but lexical categories\nChapter 2. Related Work 7\nwork either as functor or as argument and a set of combinatory rules allow them to combine. For example, the category (S\\NP)/NP works as a functor that takes an NP to the right (indicated by the forward slash followed by an NP). The category of ‘buys’ therefore can combine with the category of ‘shares’ to result in the category S\\NP which in turns takes an NP argument to the left (indicated by the backslash followed by an NP), which it finds in the category of ‘John’ to form a sentence S.\nThis grammar architecture allows CCG to deal elegantly with long-range depen-\ndencies. Instead of adding a level of representation in the form of a trace as in Figure 2.3, the grammar has universal rules which allow the combination of lexical items, as shown in Figure 2.4. This has computational advantages and linguistic plausibility: Linguistics is increasingly adopting a view of grammar where syntax and the lexicon are intertwined. It is a tenet of the recently emerging framework of Construction Grammar (Hoffmann and Trousdale, 2013). These linguistic and computational properties have made it a widely used framework across NLP research.\nChapter 2.

The question of how to deal with MWEs for syntactic parsing has been raised by many. It has been approached in different ways. Researchers working with precision grammars such as HPSG for example have accommodated the lexical entries for MWEs in the lexicon so that MWEs are not a problem for parsing. Researchers on data-induced grammars have accommodated the testing and/or training data before parsing. Recent research has proposed to both change the lexicon and the parsing algorithm. I will briefly describe each of these approaches in turn. Because I will be using the second approach for reasons explained in 3.2.1, I will describe it in a more detailed manner than the other two."

Constant et al.

They POS-tagged the two versions of the corpus before parsing each. They consequently analyzed the differences in output. In order to do so, they randomly selected a sample of output from both parsed corpora and built a taxonomy of changes they observed from one to the other. For each class in the taxonomy, they determined whether the change in output led to increased accuracy, decreased accuracy or did not change the accuracy. They automatically classified the rest of the output data and observed an overall increase in accuracy. Their work not only confirmed the results obtained from previous work but also provided an insightful qualitative analysis of changes obtained with their method. They believe the improvement in accuracy is partly due to the fact that the parsing model backs off to POS-tags for rare and unseen words.

Research on HPSG seems to have found the most sophisticated methods of dealing with MWEs but parsing with precision grammars is known to be much less robust (Zhang and Kordoni, 2008) (i.e. it fails to parse many more sentences) than parsing with data-induced grammars which make it a not ideal solution for practical parsing. As far as other solutions are concerned, they are often very much limited by the type of MWEs that have been dealt with. All other solutions presented as a matter of fact concentrate on a few types of MWEs. However, as argued by Kim (2008), because of the different but interrelated properties of MWEs, it is neither appropriate to try and generalize from MWEs and find a single representation which works for all types, nor is it appropriate to deal with each MWE type at a time. An approach for improving syntactic parsing on all MWE types is still lacking and previous approaches leave the question of whether the results can be reproduced with different types of MWEs unanswered. No approach so far has tried to determine if dealing with different types of MWEs in the same way can lead to different results. A lot of work is therefore still needed if we want to take advantage of the full potential that MWE information has to bring to syntactic parsing."

The wish to build efficient parsers with this formalism therefore grew naturally. Recent research has developed efficient tools for parsing with CCG and CCG parsing is increasingly used in NLP applications. It is, to name just a couple of examples, used for question parsing (Clark et al., 2004) and semantic parsing.\nThe first efficient statistical model was the generative model built by Hocken-\nmaier and Steedman (2002) and extended by Clark and Curran (2007) to a discriminative model. The first step made by Hockenmaier (2003) was to translate the PTB into a Treebank with CCG derivations, called CCGbank. Both models perform close to state-of-the-art although with simpler statistical models which is argued by the authors to be the result of having a more expressive grammar than the PCFGs used by state-of-the-art parsers.\nChapter 2. Related Work 12\nThe traditional parsing accuracy metric PARSEVAL has been argued (for exam-\nple by Clark and Hockenmaier (2002)) to be too harsh on CCG derivation trees because they are always binary, as opposed to PTB-style trees which can have flat constructions with more than one branching node. This binary nature of CCG trees make them prone to having more errors. Consequently evaluation of dependencies has generally been preferred for CCG parsing. For this type of evaluation, labelled and/or unlabelled precision and recall as well as F-measure are computed by comparing dependencies extracted from the output parse trees with dependencies extracted from gold standard trees. As further argued by Clark and Hockenmaier (2002), it also makes sense to use dependencies to evaluate CCG parsing since one of the advantages of CCG over other formalisms is precisely its treatment of long-range dependencies."

Trying to improve syntactic parsing with MWE information therefore looks like a promising avenue of research. In Section 2.2, advantages of working with a lexicalized grammar formalism for syntactic parsing have been put forward and in Section 2.6, it was said that parsing with the strongly lexicalized grammar formalism CCG performs almost state-of-the-art. CCG parsing therefore looks like an ideal framework for improving the current approaches to improving syntactic parsing with MWE information. In turn, parsing with a strongly lexicalized grammar formalism is likely to benefit from the addition of lexical information.\nVery little attention has however been given to MWEs in CCG parsing. Con-\nstable and Curran (2009) modified CCGbank to have a better representation of verb particle constructions but did not report any parsing accuracy improvement. No work has tried to establish whether CCG parsing accuracy could be improved by adding information about MWEs which is what we intend to do in this thesis.

This left questions unanswered: whether or not the approach can work with automatic recognition and whether or not the approach can work with different types of MWEs. As also said, Constant et al. (2012) have shown that with an automatic recognizer, the parsing accuracy improvement is not as dramatic as predicted by Nivre and Nilsson (2004) using gold standard MWE recognition. We will be conducting the type of approach described by Nivre and Nilsson (2004) using an automatic recognizer to answer the first of these questions in the context of CCG parsing. We will also experiment with the recognizer by using different versions of it to answer the second of these two questions. This approach is especially interesting in that, as has been shown in Schneider et al. (2014) who attempted a comprehensive annotation of MWEs in a corpus, even manual annotation of MWEs is a difficult task and making automatic MWE recognition an experimental part of the pipeline could lead to interesting results.\nThis approach therefore involves changing both training and test data. Changing\nthe training data can help the parsing model learn more sensible representations of language. For example in the tree for part of speech, ‘of speech’ is considered a modifier of ‘part’ as in Figure 3.1 which does not make much sense. Instead, grouping the three lexical items as in Figure 3.2 gives a better representation of this group of words.\nChapter 3. Methodology 16\nNP\nNP\\NP\nNP\nspeech\n(NP\\NP)/NP\nof\nNP\nPart\nChanging the test data by for example collapsing the three lexical items\n‘part’, ‘of’ and ‘speech’ to one token ‘part+of+speech’ can help the parser making sensible decisions locally by telling it to consider the three words as one. For example, if this token is followed by a coordinator, the parser knows that coordinating one of the units is not a possibility. In the partial sentence ‘it gives part+of+speech and lemma information’, the parser cannot coordinate ‘speech’ with ‘lemma’ which would be a possibility otherwise. Collapsing MWEs in training and test data lead to two different effects of adding MWE information to the syntactic parsing pipeline and it would be best if we could differentiate both in the experiments. The first type of effect will be called the training effect and the second the parsing effect for convenience.\nThe qualitative analysis of output proposed by Korkontzelos and Manandhar\n(2010) would add a lot of insight to this thesis but will not be conducted for reasons of time and space. As a matter of fact, Korkontzelos and Manandhar (2010) built a taxonomy of output differences and used it to quantify each change in the output data but their taxonomy is not readily usable for another syntactic model. In addition, they make extensive use of the information of whether or not a word is given an analysis in their taxonomy. The information that a word is parsed or not is specific to shallow parsing. When using deep parsing, if a word is not parsed, the sentence parse fails. We therefore do not have this type of information. Building a new taxonomy would take us too far afield but we defer it to future work.\nChapter 3. Methodology 17"

The expansion of the parser by Deoskar et al. (2014) is particularly well suited to our purposes: it was extended so that it works better on unknown lexical items. Collapsing lexical items will increase the sparsity of data and being able to deal with unknown data is therefore a concern for our approach. More particularly, the model proposed by Christodoulopoulos (2008) and Deoskar et al. (2014) is based on one of Hockenmaier (2003)’s models called LexCat and which conditions probabilities on lexical categories. Deoskar et al. (2014) make use of this LexCat model instead of the fully lexicalized model which conditions it on words precisely so that the parser is better equipped to deal with unseen lexical items. They introduce a smoothed lexicon to deal with these. They POS-tag the test data in a pre-processing stage and use POS-information to determine the lexical categories of words by using probabilities of lexical categories that appear with each POS-tag of unseen word in the seen data. Because, as mentioned in Section 2.5.2.2, Korkontzelos and Manandhar (2010) have shown that POS-tags assigned automatically to MWEs were useful when parsing, the LexCat model therefore looks ideal for our purposes.

There is a detector to find Proper Nouns, one to find all types of MWEs, one that just finds stop words, etc. These simple detectors can also be combined to form a complex detector. There are filters which filter the results of detectors. One for example only accepts MWEs that are continuous, one throws out MWEs which have a score under a certain threshold, one only keeps MWEs under a certain length. The last tool we need is called a ‘resolver’ and it resolves conflicts when lexical items are assigned to more than one MWE. Different resolvers resolve conflicts in different ways: one picks the leftmost MWE, another picks the longest matching MWE.\nAn example of resolver receives for example the following sentence as input:\n• Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; Newsweek ’s ad pages totaled 1,620 , a drop of 3.2 %\nfrom last year , according to Publishers Information Bureau .\nAnd gives the following output:\n• mr. spoon, shore up, according to, publishers information bureau\nWe will need resolvers and will always need to work with a filter that only\nkeeps continuous MWEs but we can experiment with the different resolver types, we can add filters and can experiment with the different types of detectors.

These will be called internal edges for convenience. The algorithm deletes them as shown in Figure 3.8. There are edges between a MWE unit and another word in the sentence such as the edge between ‘vinken’ and ‘is’. This type of edge will be called a mediating edge for convenience.

Again then we can use model combination and combine information from output from modelA with information from output from modelB . We compare this combined model output against gold standardA and compare the results when combining modelA with different versions of modelB . We discuss how this can be achieved in Section 3.7.2.3."

We can also test modelA on data collapsed before parsing.\nChapter 3. Methodology 27\nparsing effect Testing whether there is a parsing effect can be done by testing whether or not modelA can perform better on test data collapsed before parsing than on test data collapsed after parsing. We can therefore test modelA on the collapsed test data and see if it improves on modelA tested on unchanged data. We conducted this evaluation. In this evaluation however, the caveat mentioned in Section 3.6 that we are using information from the gold standard in the test data, i.e. we know which MWEs are siblings in the test data is problematic. This introduces an artefact which makes the results somewhat difficult to interpret: the collapsing before parsing method has sibling information which the collapsing after parsing method does not. There can be parsing and sibling effects and the two cannot be decoupled. A way to circumvent this problem is to collapse MWEs regardless of their sibling status (i.e. treat all detected MWEs as if they were siblings) and compare the model when we collapse before parsing with the model when we collapse after parsing. Collapsing all MWEs in unlabeled test data is straightforward. It was however mentioned in Section 3.5.2.1 that we do not have an algorithm to collapse trees so we cannot collapse the output parse trees. However, since we are working only with dependencies for evaluation, it is possible to collapse all MWEs in all the dependencies of the sentence. The problem with this evaluation is that the output cannot perform well on gold standardB because it is not tokenized in the same way and we treat dependencies wrongly tokenized as errors. Both collapsing before and collapsing after parsing however suffer from the same problem and the comparison between the two is fair so we will be using this evaluation to test whether or not there can be a parsing effect.\ntraining effect Testing whether there is a training effect consists in comparing the results of modelA on collapsed data with the results of modelB on collapsed data. In this evaluation, the caveat that we are using information from the gold standard in the test data can also be considered problematic because model B was trained on data with information about siblings which modelA was not and is possibly better suited to deal with unseen data with sibling information. We therefore both tested both models on data where only siblings are collapsed (called ‘gold test’ for convenience) and on data where all MWEs are collapsed (called ‘fully collapsed test’ for convenience). Again, the problem with this evaluation is that the output cannot perform well on gold standardB because it is not tokenized in the same way. Again however both models suffer from the same problem and the comparison between the two is fair so this evaluation can be used to test whether or not there is a training effect.\nChapter 3.

Our findings support the claim that automatic recognition of MWEs can improve CCG parsing. These results however led us to want to check whether or not modelB can and improve the score on the standard evaluation benchmark, i.e. on gold standard A. This evaluation scheme will be called Eval vs GoldA for convenience. This involves ‘decollapsing’ the output from modelB and splitting MWEs back into their units. However, by collapsing the data, we have lost information about some dependencies in the sentence. We have no internal edges (edges between MWE units of the same MWE) and when there is a mediating edge (edges between MWE units of any MWE and other words in the sentence) we do not know which MWE unit of the MWE it should go to or come from. In Figure 3.8 reproduced in Figure 3.11 for convenience, we do not know whether the label between is and ‘mr. vinken’ should come from ‘mr’ or ‘vinken’.\nExternal edges can be taken directly from modelB. Internal edges do not ex-\nist in modelB. Hence we propose to take them from modelA and implement a ‘model combination’ algorithm which combines dependencies from modelA with dependencies from modelB. For mediating edges, there are different possibilities. Either we can take them from modelA and therefore only test whether or not modelB performs better than modelA on external edges. This was implemented as one of the evaluation schemes which will be called Eval vs GoldB ‘medFromA’ for convenience. If we want to test modelB on mediating edges however, the model combining algorithm will have to choose the node it comes from or goes to: in our example, it should either be ‘mr.’ or ‘vinken’. The following two other evaluation schemes were implemented, one in which the rightmost node is chosen as incoming or outcoming node for mediating edges from modelB, which I will henceforth call the ‘rightmostMed’ Eval vs GoldB\nChapter 3. Methodology 29\nscheme, one in which the leftmost node is chosen which I will henceforth call the ‘leftmostMed’ scheme. In order for the model combining algorithm to work, we need to recover information about MWEs so that we know for each word in the dependency whether or not we are dealing with a unit of a MWE and hence to know if we are dealing with an internal, external or mediating edge. This can easily be done because MWE units are marked as such in the unlabeled data2.\nWhen these models are combined in these three different ways, we have a new\ncombined model that we can compare with modelA on gold standardA. In this case again however using ‘gold test’ data is problematic. As a matter of fact, if we use outputB as obtained after parsing ‘gold test’ data, we are using information obtained during the conversion of the gold standard and we are using a parsing pipeline which is not fully automatic. In order to make sure that we can beat modelA in a fully automatic way, we can use parses of modelB tested on the test data which were collapsed as though all MWEs were siblings as described in Section 3.7.2.1, which will henceforth be called the ‘fully collapsed test’ data, and combine them in the same three ways as described above."

In this Chapter, we have proposed a methodology for testing this. We have refined the first research questions: what we want to find out is whether or not automatic recognition of MWEs can improve CCG parsing. Additionally, we have separated it into two further research questions: whether we can observe a parsing effect (the parser is helped in its decisions by collapsed data) and/or whether we can observe a training effect (the parser learns something useful). We have proposed to use different MWE recognizers to answer the second question. When defining an algorithm for collapsing the Treebank however, we could not find a straightforward algorithm to collapse MWEs that are not siblings in the tree and decided to settle for an algorithm that only collapses siblings. This led to further complications in the evaluation schemes because it makes it harder to give a fair evaluation of our models. We however found ways to circumvent the problems by implementing different evaluation schemes together with cross-validations. We have tested our methodology using different recognizers and we present the results in the next Chapter.\nChapter 4\nExperiments and results"

In more practical terms, the first question is, can we create a model which has MWE information which modelA does not have and which performs better than modelA? In Chapter 3, this question was also decomposed into two sub-questions: whether or not there is a training effect from collapsing the data, i.e. the parser learns something useful and whether or not there is a parsing effect, i.e. the parser is helped in its decisions by collapsed data. The second research question is less precise: do we observe differences in results when using different MWE recognizers? What would this tell us about MWE recognition and its interaction with syntactic parsing? In this chapter, I will deal with each of these two questions in turn: first dealing with the general effect of adding MWE information to CCG parsing and second I will deal with observations that can be made when using different recognizers. Before I deal with these questions, I will introduce the different MWE recognizers that we used.\nSignificance tests We used a one-tailed Randomized Shuffling test with 10,000 iterations to asses statistical significance of our best results. This test is particularly suited to our purposes, it was created for research in Computational Linguistics which assesses precision, recall and F-scores and has the advantage over most other statistical tests that it does not make independence assumptions between the models compared\n32\nChapter 4.

Detectors which detect MWEs in text, filters which filter through the results of one or more detectors and resolvers which resolve conflicts between MWEs when one word is assigned to more than one MWEs by the detector. We built 5 different MWE recognizers with these three tools. This means that the study is by no means exhaustive, we just tried combinations that were comparable with each other and that intuitively made sense. Building all possible combinations was beyond the scope of the thesis.\nWe used two different resolvers: one which always picks the longest matching\nMWE (which will be called ‘Longest’), one which picks the leftmost MWE (which will be called ‘Leftmost’, i.e. the one that started earliest in the sentence). We used 3 different detectors: one which finds all MWEs (which will be called ‘Exhaustive’, one which finds only Proper Nouns (which will be called ‘ProperNoun’) and one which finds only stop words (which will be called ‘StopWords’. We always used the filter that only keeps continuous MWEs. We used a filter that only keeps an MWE if its units appear more often in the MWE than as a single token which will be called MoreFrequentAsMWE. We used a filter which constrains the length of MWEs to two which will be called ‘ConstrainLength’. We summarize the recognizers used as well as information collected during the collapsing algorithm in Table 4.1.

Then we check whether we can use modelB to improve modelA on gold standardA by using model combination with modelA and modelB. I will deal with each of these in turn. We tested all evaluation schemes on all of our versions of modelB. Results fluctuate according to the recognizers as will be discussed in Section 4.4.

Experiments and results 36\nthe ‘collapsing before parsing’ method has gold standard information about siblings which the ‘collapsing after parsing’ method does not. It is interesting despite of this caveat but as we also said in that Section, we have a way of verifying whether or not MWE information is partly responsible for this result. For this verification, we collapse all MWEs both before and after parsing and compare the results. In this case, modelA when data are collapsed before parsing outperforms modelA when data are collapsed after parsing only in one of the 5 cases which undermines a little the previous argument about the parsing effects showing that there can also be undesirable effects to collapsing test data. It could however be partly due to the fact that we collapsed non-siblings, which may have triggered errors during parsing. In any case, our best results still show a significant improvement with the ‘collapsing before parsing’ method over the ‘collapsing after parsing’ method . These results are obtained when using recogniser3 and are given in Table 4.5. ModelA collapsed before parsing significantly beats modelA collapsed after parsing by 0.20% (p=.008). This indicates that there is a parsing effect.\n4.3.2 Can we improve the parsing model on the original gold stan-\ndard?\nAs was said in Section 3.7.2.2, because we observed improvements in accuracy\nfrom modelA to modelB on gold standardB which showed that modelB seemed to be better than modelA, we decided to test whether or not modelB can improve modelA on gold standardA. This means testing whether or not modelB improves on modelA on external edges and/or on mediating edges. As a reminder, we decided to test this with three different evaluations testing three different combinations of modelA and modelB . Internal edges are always taken from modelA and external edges are always taken from modelB. Mediating edges are taken from A in the ‘medFromA’ evaluation and from B in the 2 other cases. In the ‘rightmostMed’ evaluation, the rightmost MWE unit is always chosen as incoming or outcoming node and in the ‘leftmostMed’ evaluation, it is the leftmost MWE unit that is always taken as incoming or outcoming node. Our best\nChapter 4. Experiments and results 37\nresults are given in 4.6 in which modelB only outperforms modelA in the ‘medFromA’ case by 0.13% which is not significant (p>.05). This seems to show that modelB may perform better than modelA on external edges but as far as mediating edges are concerned, the picture is unclear. If we take the mediating edge from B, it seems clearly better to choose the rightmost MWE unit as incoming or outcoming node (which is not surprising since heads of compound nouns are almost always rightbranching) but doing so does not seem to be a big help in parsing accuracy. ModelB might perform better than modelA on mediating edges if we had a better mechanism to recover the head word but with our simple method we cannot say whether or not it is the case.\nAs said in Section 3.7.2.2, in the evaluation presented here, modelB is again\nhelped in the parsing decisions by being told which MWEs are siblings and the resulting parsing pipeline is therefore not fully automatic. In order to test whether or not we could improve on modelA in a fully automatic manner, we tested modelB on the ‘fully collapsed test’ data which is a version of the test data obtained automatically, i.e. by collapsing all MWEs in the text instead of only the siblings. All MWEs are then parsed as a unit. When we combine the models, we have more MWEs than we should have and consequently, more edges are considered to be mediating and internal edges and less edges are considered to be external edges. Hence, we are led to choose edges from modelA where modelA is not expected to perform better than modelB . When combining both models with the ‘medFromA’ method however, we still outperform modelA by 0.04% when using recognizer3 showing that modelB may have learnt something useful although there is no significant evidence for it at this point.\nOverall then it seems that modelB can outperform modelA on different evaluation\nschemes and we can conclude that modelB can be better than modelA at least on some dependencies. It seems that we can improve CCG parsing with automatic MWE recognition although the improvements we have seen are not dramatic and we have failed to\nChapter 4.

Looking at the different models, it is interesting to note that there is a much lower percentage of MWEs that are siblings in the tree and hence a much lower amount of changes made in the treebank. It is interesting to note that the best model is based on a detector that only detects Proper Nouns.

It only changes the probability distributions of the lexical categories of the nodes involved, i.e. children and parent. It does not modify the rest of the tree. One of the limitations that has been mentioned is the fact that we only collapsed MWEs when they are siblings in the data. An algorithm that would collapse non-siblings and return trees as described in Section 3.5.2.1 would make more radical changes to the tree and probably affect the probability model much more. In Chapter 3, an example of MWE for which units are not siblings in the Tree was given together with its ideal collapsed tree. Both Figures are reproduced in Figure 5.1 and 5.2 respectively for convenience. In this example, not only does the category of the leaf node ‘to’ disappear (as is always the case in sibling collapsing) but its parent node ‘PP’ also disappears (as never happens with sibling collapsing).

The importance of working on this task for NLP applications was emphasized together with the difficulty of improving it. Arguments for working with a lexicalized grammar such as CCG were put forward, the most important of which being their linguistic plausibility and the fact that they are increasingly successfully used for the syntactic parsing task. Working on the lexicon by adding MWE information to it was singled out as a useful direction because it has proven useful in the past and because it seemed an interesting approach to attempt within the framework of a lexicalized grammar. We built on previous work which had shown the benefits of giving information about MWEs to a syntactic parser. It had been shown to work for deterministic dependency parsing, shallow parsing and deterministic constituency parsing but not for statistical constituency parsing. We implemented an existing pipeline which consists in collapsing MWEs in training and test\n44\nChapter 6. Conclusion 45\ndata and adapted it to our purposes. We gave further evidence supporting these studies and showed that statistical constituency parsing with a lexicalized grammar too can benefit from MWE information. Our study provided further empirical support to the hypothesis that MWE information can improve syntactic parsing by showing that we can improve CCG parsing with information about MWEs.\nMWE identification was also identified as a notoriously difficult task although\nimportant for many applications because MWEs violate usual compositional rules and can be the source of many errors if not handled properly. We have shown that using an existing automatic recognizer as a source of MWE information was useful which had so far been left a bit unclear in the literature.\nOur results have shown small but significant improvements on previous models\nwhich is very encouraging given the difficult task at hand and given the restricted settings we have worked with. We have as a matter of fact hypothesized that the results were very much limited by the methodology used and have suggested ways of improving the current approach. Our biggest contributions however are not in the results we obtained but in the techniques we proposed. The study has proposed novel techniques to improve on previous pipelines. We have proposed an algorithm to automatically collapse MWEs in a treebank which can be used with other formalisms although this algorithm is limited to collapsing MWEs which form a constituent in the tree. More importantly, we have proposed ways of experimenting with our models in a way that we can distinguish parsing (the parser is helped in its decisions by collapsed data) from training effects (the parser learns something useful) in the evaluation and have shown evidence for both. In addition, we have proposed to turn the MWE recognition part of the pipeline into an experimental part and have shown that doing so leads to differences in results. This is especially interesting in that it is never quite clear in the literature what counts as an MWE. It is therefore interesting to discover what types of MWE our technique is best suited to and our method could be used to discover interesting properties of MWEs.\nFuture work We propose the following for future work:\n• Extending the collapsing algorithm to the non-sibling case\n• Testing more MWE recognition methods\n• Using more and/or different data for MWE recognition\nChapter 6. Conclusion 46\n• Further integrating MWE recognition and syntactic parsing\n• Integrating MWE recognition and our collapsing algorithm\n• Conducting qualitative evaluation\nA lot more interesting research can still be done on the interaction between MWE\nidentification and syntactic parsing. Theoretical research has emphasized the need to give different syntactic representations for different types of MWEs but a lot of empirical work is still needed if we want to automatically assign sensible syntactic representations to MWEs. In the meantime, we believe to have opened new perspectives in the study of the integration between syntactic parsing and MWE identification especially in relation to CCG parsing. We have given encouraging results on a difficult task and suggested ways of improving them. We have given further evidence that the integration of MWE identification with syntactic parsing is a promising and exciting research direction and we have shown that it is a research direction that still has a lot to offer."

    "abstractText" : "This thesis presents a study about the integration of information about Multiword Expressions (MWEs) into parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). We build on previous work by Nivre and Nilsson (2004) and by Korkontzelos and Manandhar (2010) who have shown the benefit of adding information about MWEs to syntactic parsing by implementing a similar pipeline with CCG parsing. More specifically, we collapse MWEs to one token in training and test data in CCGbank, a corpus automatically created by Hockenmaier (2003) which contains sentences annotated with CCG derivations. Our collapsing algorithm however can only deal with MWEs when they form a constituent in the data which is one of the limitations of our approach. We study the effect of collapsing training and test data. A parsing effect can be obtained if collapsed data help the parser in its decisions and a training effect can be obtained if training on the collapsed data improves results. We also collapse the gold standard and show that our model significantly outperforms the baseline model on our gold standard, which indicates that there is a training effect. We show that the baseline model performs significantly better on our gold standard when the data are collapsed before parsing than when the data are collapsed after parsing which indicates that there is a parsing effect. We show that these results can lead to improved performance on the non-collapsed standard benchmark although we fail to show that it does so significantly. We conclude that despite the limited settings, there are noticeable improvements from using MWEs in parsing. We discuss ways in which the incorporation of MWEs into parsing can be improved and hypothesize that this will lead to more substantial results. We finally show that turning the MWE recognition part of the pipeline into an experimental part is a useful thing to do as we obtain different results with different recognizers.",
