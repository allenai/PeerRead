The speaker-specific information in the excitation of voiced speech is captured using statistical approaches such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The decrease in the error during training and recognizing speakers during testing phase close to 100% accuracy demonstrates that the excitation component of speech contains speaker-specific information and is indeed being effectively captured by continuous Ergodic HMM than GMM. The performance of the speaker recognition system is evaluated on GMM and 2-state ergodic HMM with different mixture components and test speech duration.

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Within the past decade, technological advances such as telebanking and remote collaborative data processing over large computer networks have increased the demand for improved methods of information security. For personal information including medical records, bank accounts and credit history, the ability to verify the identity of individuals attempting to access such data is critical. To date, low-cost methods such as passwords, personal identification numbers and magnetic cards have been widely used. More advanced security measures have also been developed (e.g., face recognizers, retinal scanners, as well as automatic finger print analyzers). The uses of these procedures have been limited by both cost and ease of use. In recent years, speaker recognition (recognizing a person from his/her voice by a machine) and verification algorithms have received considerable attention. There are several reasons for this interest. In particular, speech provides a convenient and natural form of input, conveys a significant amount of speaker dependent information.\nSpeech is a composite signal which carries information about the message, the speaker identity and the language identity [1], [2]. It is difficult to isolate the speaker specific features alone from the signal. The speaker characteristics present in the signal can be attributed to the anatomical and the behavioural aspects of the speech production mechanism. The representation of the behavioural characteristics is a difficult task, and usually requires large amount of data.\nAutomatic speaker recognition systems rely mainly on features derived from the physiological characteristics of the speaker.\nSpeech is produced as sequence of sounds. Hence the state of the vocal folds, shape and size of various articulators, change over time to reflect the sound being produced. To produce a particular sound the articulators have to be positioned in a particular way. When different speakers try to produce same\nsound, though their vocal tracts are positioned in a similar manner, the actual vocal tract shapes will be different due to differences in the anatomical structure of the vocal tract. System features represent the structure of vocal tract. The movements of vocal folds vary from one speaker to another, the manner and speed in which the vocal folds close also varies across speakers. As a result different voices are produced by different speakers. The variations in the vibrations of the vocal folds represent the source features.\nThe theory of Linear Prediction (LP) is closely linked to modelling of the vocal tract system, and relies upon the fact that a particular speech sample may be predicted by a linear combination of previous samples. The number of previous samples used for prediction is known as the order of the prediction. The weights applied to each of the previous speech samples are known as Linear Prediction Coefficients (LPC). They are calculated so as to minimize the prediction error [4].\nA study into the use of LPC for speaker recognition was carried out by [3]. These coefficients are highly correlated, and the use of all prediction coefficients may not be necessary for speaker recognition task [6] [7] used a method called orthogonal linear prediction. It is shown that only a small subset of the resulting orthogonal coefficients exhibits significant variation over the duration of an utterance. It is also shown that reflection coefficients are as good as the other feature sets. [8] Used principal spectral components derived from linear prediction coefficients for speaker verification task. Hence a detailed exploration to know the speaker- specific excitation information present in the residual of speech is needed and hence the motivation for the present work.\nIt has been shown that humans can recognize people by listening to the LP residual signal [9]. This may be attributed to the speaker-specific excitation information present at the segmental (10–30 ms) and suprasegmental levels (1–3 s). The\npresence of speaker-specific information at the segmental and suprasegmental levels can be established by generating signals that retain specific features at these levels. For instance, speakerspecific suprasegmental information like intonation and duration can be perceived in the signal which has impulses of appropriate strength at each pitch epoch in the voiced region, and at random instances in the unvoiced regions. Instants of significant excitation correspond to pitch epochs in case of voiced speech and some random excitation instants like onset of burst events in case of unvoiced speech. The LP residual has the additional information of the glottal pulse characteristics in the samples between two pitch epochs. Perceptually the signals will be different if these samples (related to the glottal pulse characteristics) are replaced by synthetic model signals [10] [11] [12], [13] or by random noise. It appears that significant speaker specific excitation information is present in the segmental and suprasegmental features of the residual. The present work focuses on extracting speaker-specific excitation information present at the segmental level of the residual.\nAt the segmental level, each short segment of the LP residual can be considered to belong to one of the five broad categories. They are voiced, unvoiced, plosive, silence and mixed excitation. The voiced excitation is the dominant mode of excitation during speech production. Further, if voiced excitation is replaced by random noise excitation, it is difficult to perceive the speaker’s identity [13]. In this paper we demonstrate that the speaker specific characteristics are indeed present at the segmental level of the LP residual, and they can be reliably extracted using hidden Markov models.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we examine the speaker specific characteristics of the LP residual, and demonstrate the approach to extract the speakerspecific information from the residual signal. Finally we discuss feature extraction using Melceptral coefficients to capture the speaker specific information from the residual. Section 3 describes parametric approaches such as GMM and HMM based implementation for speaker recognition. Section 4 describes the database used in the study and the performance of speaker recognition systems based on the speaker specific features from the LP residual. The proposed speaker recognition system, based on the LP residual, may not require large amounts of data. Summary and conclusions of this study is presented at the end of the paper."

      "text" : "Speech signals, as any other real world signals, are produced by exciting a system with source. A simple block diagram representation of the speech production mechanism is shown in the Figure 1. Vibrations of the vocal folds, powered by air coming from the lungs during exhalation, are the sound source for speech. As shown in the Figure 1, the glottal excitation forms the source, and the vocal tract forms the system. The philosophy of linear prediction is intimately related to the basic speech production model. The Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) analysis performs spectral analysis on short segments of speech with an all-pole modelling constraint [14]. Since speech\ncan be modelled as the output of linear, time-varying system excited by a source, LPC analysis captures the vocal tract system information in terms of coefficients of the filter representing the vocal tract mechanism. Hence, analysis of speech signal by linear prediction results in two components, namely the synthesis filter on one hand and the residual on the other hand. In brief, the LP residual signal is generated as a by product of the LPC analysis, and the computation of the residual signal is given below.\nIf the input signal is represented by ( )nu and the output signal by ( )ns , then the transfer function of the system can be expressed as,\n( ) ( ) ( )zU zSzH = (1)\nWhere ( )zS and ( )zU are z-transforms of ( )ns and ( )nu respectively.\nConsider the case where we have the output signal and the system and have to compute the input signal.

The MFCC technique makes use of two types of filters namely, linearly spaced filters and logarithmically spaced filters. To capture the phonetically important characteristics of speech, signal is expressed in the Mel frequency scale. This scale has a linear frequency spacing below 1000 Hz and a logarithmic spacing above 1000 Hz. Normal speech waveform may vary from time to time depending on the physical condition of speaker’s vocal cords. MFFCs are less susceptible to the said variations [15]."

The main objective of the ML estimation is to derive the optimum model parameters that can maximize the likelihood of GMM. Unfortunately direct maximization using ML estimation is not possible and therefore a special case of ML estimation known as Expectation-\nMaximization (EM) [19] algorithm is used to extract the model parameters. The GMM likelihood of a sequence of T training vectors { }T1 x,...xX = can be given as [17]\n)|x(p)|X(p t T\n1t λλ ∏ = = .

Linear prediction (LP) residual is used as a representation of excitation information in speech. The speaker-specific information in the excitation of voiced speech is captured using statistical approaches such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The decrease in the error during training and recognizing speakers during testing phase close to 100% accuracy demonstrates that the excitation component of speech contains speaker-specific information and is indeed being effectively captured by continuous Ergodic HMM than GMM. The performance of the speaker recognition system is evaluated on GMM and 2-state ergodic HMM with different mixture components and test speech duration. We demonstrate the speaker recognition studies on TIMIT database for both GMM and Ergodic HMM.",
