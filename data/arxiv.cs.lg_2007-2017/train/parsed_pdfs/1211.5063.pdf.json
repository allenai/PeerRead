      "text" : "Training Recurrent Neural Networks is more troublesome than feedforward ones because of the vanishing and exploding gradient problems detailed in Bengio et al. (1994). In this paper we attempt to understand the fundamental issues underlying the exploding gradient problem by exploring it from an analytical, a geometric and a dynamical system perspective. Our analysis is used to justify the simple yet effective solution of norm clipping the exploded gradient. In the experimental section, the comparison between this heuristic solution and standard SGD provides empirical evidence towards our hypothesis as well as it shows that such a heuristic is required to reach state of the art results on a character prediction task and a polyphonic music prediction one."

      "text" : "A recurrent neural network (RNN), see Figure 1, is a neural network model proposed in the 80’s (Rumelhart et al., 1986; Elman, 1990; Werbos, 1988) for modeling time series. The structure of the network is similar to that of a standard multilayer perceptron, with the distinction that we allow connections among hidden units associated with a time delay. Through these connections the model can retain information about the past inputs, enabling it to discover temporal correlations between events that are possibly far away from each other in the data (a crucial property for proper learning of time series).\nWhile in principle the recurrent network is a simple and powerful model, in practice, it is unfortunately hard to train properly. A plethora of training algorithms have been proposed in the literature, like Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) (Rumelhart et al., 1986; Werbos, 1988), Real Time Recurrent Learning (Williams and Zipser, 1989), AtiyaParlos learning rule (Atiya and Parlos, 2000), etc. Most of these are gradient based, though alternative approaches are also available (for example see Lukoševičius and Jaeger (2009)), and as shown in Atiya and Parlos (2000) most gradient-based methods behave qualitatively the same, providing little success in properly addressing complex tasks. Among the main reasons why this model is so unwieldy are the vanishing gradient and exploding gradient problems described in Bengio et al. (1994).\nIn this paper we will only address the exploding gradient problem and provide an understanding of the issues stochastic gradient descent (SGD) faces when training a recurrent network. We should note\nar X\niv :1\n21 1.\n50 63\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 1\nthat there are a few solutions proposed for this problem in the literature, amongst which the HessianFree learning (Sutskever et al., 2011), a second order method that seems promising, though more needs to be done to analyze its success, especially compared to other second order methods that seem to do less well in general. Long Short Term Memory networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) is another approach, relying on a change in the structure of the model, and designed to help with the vanishing gradient problem. The extend to which this alteration limits the modeling power of the model is not clear, nor does the approach address the exploding gradient problem. We do not intend to directly compete with these solutions, but rather improve the limited understanding of why such approaches are required. To validate some of our hypotheses we devise a simple alteration of SGD which, given its simplicity, can be seen as a reliable alternative to SGD learning.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In subsection 1.1 we briefly formalise the concept of training recurrent networks. In section 2 we introduce and analyze the exploding gradient problem, while in section 3 we describe our proposed solution. Section 4 provides empirical experimentation on different datasets and finally in section 5 we have some final remarks."

A cost E measures the performance of the network on some given task and it can be broken apart into individual costs for each step E = ∑1≤t≤T Et, where Et = L(xt).\nOne approach that can be used to compute the necessary gradients for learning is to represent the recurrent model as a deep multi-layer one (with an unbounded number of layers) and apply backpropagation on the unrolled model (see Figure 2).\nWe will diverge from the classical BPTT equations at this point and re-write the gradients (see equations (3), (4) and (5)) in order to better highlight the exploding gradient problem.\n∂E ∂θ\n= ∑\n1≤t≤T\n∂Et ∂θ\n(3)\n∂Et ∂θ\n= ∑\n1≤k≤t\n( ∂Et ∂xt ∂xt ∂xk ∂+xk ∂θ ) (4)\n∂xt ∂xk = ∏ t≥i>k ∂xi ∂xi−1 = ∏ t≥i>k WTrecdiag(σ ′(xi−1))\n(5) where ∂+ represents the partial derivative of the state at some point in time with respect to some parameter as a direct argument, i.e., without considering the recurrent path (i.e. when computing the derivative of xk with respect to θ we ignore the fact that xk is a function of xk−1 which in turn is a function of θ). Equation (5) also provides the form of ∂xt∂xk for the\nspecific parametrization given in equation (2), where diag converts a vector into a diagonal matrix, and σ′ computes the derivative of σ in an element-wise fashion.\nNote that each term ∂Et∂θ from equation (3) has the same form and the behaviour of these individual terms determine the behaviour of the sum. Henceforth we will focus on one such generic term, calling it simply the gradient when there is no confusion.\nAny gradient component ∂Et∂θ is also a sum (see equation (4)), whose terms we refer to as temporal contributions or temporal components. One can see that each such temporal contribution ∂Et∂xt ∂xt ∂xk ∂+xk ∂θ measures how θ at step k affects the cost at step t. The factors ∂xt∂xk (equation (5)) transport the error “in time“ from step k to step t. We would further loosely distinguish between long term and short term contributions, where long term refers to components for which k t and short term to everything else."

Because the gradient is just a sum of these components, it follows that it should also grow exponentially fast following the long term component with k = 0 (for which l = t).

If |λj | > 1, it follows that ∂xt∂xk grows exponentially fast with l, and it does so along the direction qj .\nThe proof assumes Wrec is diagonalizable for simplicity, though using the Jordan normal form of Wrec one can extend this proof by considering not just the eigenvector of largest eigenvalue but the whole subspace spanned by the the eigenvectors sharing the same (largest) eigenvalue.\nThis result provides a necessary condition for gradients to grow, namely that the spectral radius (the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue) of Wrec must be larger than 1.\nIf qj is not in the null space of ∂+xk ∂θ the entire temporal component grows exponentially with l. This approach extends easily to the entire gradient. If we re-write it in terms of the eigen-decomposition of W, we get:\n∂Et ∂θ = n∑ j=1 ( t∑ i=k cjλ t−k j q T j ∂+xk ∂θ ) (8)\nWe can now pick j and k such that cjq T j ∂+xk ∂θ does not have 0 norm, while maximizing |λj |.

      "text" : "To generalize this proof to the nonlinear case, we define the concept of expanding and non-expanding matrices for some direction v. We say that the Jacobian matrix ∂xi∂xi−1 expands along a vector v by α > 1 if equation (9) holds.\n∀u, ∣∣∣∣uT ∂xi∂xi−1v ∣∣∣∣ > α|uTv| (9) Intuitively, to achieve exponential growth, it is sufficient that most of the Jacobians ∂xi∂xi−1 are expanding, such that their product expands exponentially with their number and also that there is no Jacobian matrix that kills off these exponentially large increases.\nWe formalize this by constructing the set P of matrices that are non-expanding, and considering a lower bound β > 0 on how much these matrices shrink a vector in the direction v (see equation (10)).\n∀u, ∣∣∣∣uT ∂xi∂xi−1v ∣∣∣∣ > β|uTv|, if ∂xi∂xi−1 ∈ P (10) This means that if α is the least amount by which any matrix ∂xi∂xi−1 6∈ P expands, ∂xt ∂xk should expand roughly by β|P |αt−|P |. If the cardinality of P is bounded as t grows, it means this product grows exponentially fast with t− |P |.\nIt is worth mentioning that α is bounded by the spectral radius of each matrix ∂xi∂xi−1 (which is easy to\nsee as ∥∥∥ ∂xi∂xi−1v∥∥∥ ≤ ∥∥∥ ∂xi∂xi−1 ∥∥∥ ‖v‖). If we consider the parametrization in equation (2), this spectral radius is in its turn bounded by the product of the spectral radii ρWrec of Wrec and ρσ′ of diag(σ\n′(xi−1)). We know that ρσ′ < 1 for tanh and ρσ′ <\n1/4 for sigmoid, and hence we recover the necessary condition for the gradients to explode, namely that ρWrec > 1 (with the tighter version for the sigmoid, ρWrec > 4).\nWe also need for equations (11) and (12) to hold, where the first equation implies that our chosen direction v is not in the null space of ∂ +xk ∂θ , while the second equation writes the vector ∂Et∂xt in a orthonormal vector basis v1, ..,vN , where v1 = v and c (loss) i ∈ R.\n∀u ∈ RN , |uT ∂ +xk ∂θ v| ≥ γk|uTv|, γk > 0 (11)\n∂Et ∂xt = N∑ j=1 c (loss) j v T j , c (loss) 1 6= 0 (12)\nUsing these relations we can find a lower bound for |gTk v|, where gk is the temporal component corresponding to time step k. Equation (13) shows a few steps of this derivation, where without loss of generality we assigned the first element to P , but not the second one.\n|gTk v1| ≥ ∣∣∣( ∂Et∂xt ∂xt∂xk) ∂+xk∂θ v1∣∣∣\n≥ γk ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ ( ∂Et ∂xt ∂xt ∂xk+1 ) ∈P︷ ︸︸ ︷∂xk+1 ∂xk v1 ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≥ γkβ\n∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ ( ∂Et ∂xt ∂xt ∂xk+2 ) 6∈P︷ ︸︸ ︷∂xk+2 ∂xk+1 v1 ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≥ γkβα\n∣∣∣( ∂Et∂xt ∂xt∂xk+3) ∂xk+3∂xk+2v1∣∣∣ ..\n≥ γkβ|P |αl−|P | ∣∣∣ ∂Et∂xtv1∣∣∣ ≥ γkβ|P |αl−|P ||c(loss)1 | ≥ Ckαl−|P |\n(13) Equation (13) ensures that long term components explode along v as long as the coefficient Ck (where Ck = γkβ |P ||c(loss)1 |) does not go exponentially fast to 0. This is mostly a constraint on γk (since |P | is bounded from our initial assumption), which is determined by ∂ +xk ∂θ . For a classical parametrization of the model the norm of the partial derivative ∂ +xk ∂θ is determined by the norm of the state and input at time k, where the constraint on the state roughly\ntranslates into not having the state going towards its saturated state faster than αl−|P | (which can be satisfied for tanh and sigmoid).\nWe summarize this derivation by saying that what we achieve is to provide a lower bound of the gradient when it explodes, bound that grows exponentially with t. Further more, if we consider v such that we maximize α, given that |P | is fixed, in the limit of t→∞ the bound becomes tight and we can approximate the gradient by Ckα t−|P |v."

Note that for simplicity we assume no input.\nxt = wσ(xt−1) + b (14)\nFigure 3 shows the error surface E50 = (σ(x50) − 0.7)2, where we use the initial state x0 = .5.\nSection 2.1 shows that when the gradient explodes, it is bounded by Cαkv (see equation (13)). If we\nassume that this bound is tight, we can derive that when gradients explode so does the curvature along v, leading to a wall in the error surface as the one seen in 3.\nThis provides us with a hypothesis, which if it holds, gives us a simple solution to the exploding gradient problem depicted in 3.\nIf both the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the curvature are aligned with the exploding direction v, it follows that the error surface has a steep wall perpendicular to v (and consequently to the gradient). This means that when SGD reaches the wall and does a gradient descent step, it will be forced to jump across the valley moving perpendicular to the steep walls, possibly leaving the valley and disrupting the learning process.\nThe dashed arrows in Figure 3 correspond to ignoring the norm of this large step, ensuring that the model stays close to the wall. The key insight is that all the steps taken when the gradient explodes are aligned with v and ignore other descent direction (i.e. the model moves perpendicular to the wall). At the wall, small-norm step in the direction of the gradient therefore only pushes us back inside the smoother low-curvature region besides the wall. In that region, SGD is free to explore other descent directions.\nThe important addition in this scenario to the classical high curvature valley, is that we assume that the valley is wide, as we have a large region around the wall where if we land we can rely on first order methods to move towards the local minima. This justifies why just clipping the gradient might be sufficient and we are not necessarily constraint to use a second order method.\nOur hypothesis could also help to understand the recent success of the Hessian-Free approach compared to other second order methods. There are two key differences between Hessian-Free and most other second-order algorithms. First, it uses the full Hessian matrix and hence can deal with exploding directions that are not necessarily axis aligned. Second, it computes a new estimate of the Hessian matrix before each update step, which can take into account abrupt changes in curvature (such as the ones suggested by our hypothesis) while most other approaches rely on a smoothness assumption, averaging 2nd order signals\nover many steps."

      "heading" : "2.5 Drawing similarities with Dynamical Systems",
      "text" : "One can consider yet another perspective, namely that of dynamical systems. Recurrent networks are universal approximators of dynamical systems (see for e.g. Siegelmann and Sontag (1995)) and as such it is sometimes useful to analyze them using dynamical systems tools which allow for better abstractions that we can use for reasoning about the behaviour of the model. Looking at dynamical systems theory for explaining the exploding gradient problem has been done before in Doya (1993); Bengio et al. (1993). In this paper we will extend and improve these previous observations.\nFor any parameter assignment θ, depending on the initial state x0, the xt of an autonomous dynamical system converges, under the repeated application of the map F , to one of several possible different attractor states (e.g. point attractors). They describe the asymptotic behaviour of the model. The state space is divided into basins of attraction, one for each attractor. If the model is started in one basin of attraction it will converge to the corresponding attractor.\nThe next step is to consider how θ affects the asymptotic behaviour. Dynamical systems theory tells us that as θ changes slowly, the asymptotic behaviour changes smoothly almost everywhere except for certain crucial points where drastic changes occur (the new asymptotic behaviour is no more topologically equivalent with the old one). These points are called bifurcation boundaries and are caused by attractors that appear, disappear or change shape.\nSpecifically, if we re-consider the simple model defined by equation (14) from section 2.4, where we fix w to 5.0 and allow b to change we get its bifurcation diagram (with respect to b) of Figure 4. Such diagrams convey an abstract but complete picture of how the system can behave.\nThe x-axis covers the parameter b and the y-axis the asymptotic state x∞. The bold line follows the movement of the final point attractor, x∞, as b changes. At b1 we have a bifurcation boundary where a new attractor emerges (when b decreases from ∞),\nwhile at b2 we have another that results in the disappearance of one of the two attractors. In the interval (b1, b2) we are in a rich regime, where there are two attractors and the change in position of boundary between them, as we change b, is traced out by a dashed line. The vector field (gray dashed arrows) describe the evolution of the state x if the network is initialized in that region.\nWe show that there are two types of events that could lead to a large change in xt, with t→∞. One is crossing a boundary between basin of attraction (depicted with a unfilled circles), while the other is crossing a bifurcation boundary (filled circles). For large t, the ∆xt resulting from a change in b will be large even for very small changes in b (as the system is attracted towards different attractors) which leads to a large gradient. In practice it is sufficient to be close to such a boundary for the gradient to be quite large (as F is smooth and hence it needs to gradually change direction, with the norm ||F ′|| of the Jacobian of F being 0 on the boundary).\nUsing these notions we can define a necessary and sufficient condition for the gradients to explode. The condition is for a boundary between basins of attraction to be crossed either by a change in x0 or a change in θ. Not that we take the non-conventional approach of considering a change in θ to cause switching between basins of attraction by changing the position of the border. When crossing a bifurcation bound-\nary that leads to large change in xt, by an abuse of language, we say a boundary between basins of attractions was also crossed implicitly (as for e.g. the boundary between the old attractor and the emerging one), allowing us to unify the two different scenarios.\nIn Doya (1993) only crossing bifurcation boundaries are considered ignoring changes in the state or the position of the state relative a borders between basin of attraction. We argue that this is an incomplete view. Crossing a bifurcation implies a global change, but locally things could stay the same (i.e., after the bifurcation we can find ourselves in the same basin of attraction). Also a change in θ means a change in the position of the boundary between basins of attractions which could lead to crossing such a boundary, a scenario that is not considered by analyzing only bifurcations. Therefore we consider our proposed view more lucrative.\nAnother limitation of previous analysis is that they only consider autonomous systems. We propose to extend our analysis to input driven model by folding the input into the map. We consider the family of maps Ft, where we apply a different Ft at each step. Intuitively, for the gradients to explode we require the same behaviour as before, where (at least in some direction) the maps F1, .., Ft agree and change direction, for a small change in θ or x0 (even for the same input sequence). Figure 5 describes this behaviour.\nFor the specific parametrization provided by equation (2) we can take the analogy on step further by decomposing the maps Ft into a fixed map F̃ and\na time-varying one Ut. F (x) = Wrecσ(x) + b corresponds to an input-less recurrent network, while Ut(x) = x + Winut describes the effect of the input. This is depicted in in Figure 6. Since Ut changes with time, it can not be analyzed using standard dynamical systems tools, but F̃ can. This means that when a boundary between basins of attractions is crossed for F̃ , the state will move towards a different attractor, which for large t can lead to a large discrepancy in xt. If Ut is bounded, that it can interfere with this behaviour only when the state is close to the boundary, but not far away. Therefore studying the asymptotic behaviour of F̃ can provide some information about where such events are likely to happen.\nThese derivations (specifically figure 6) provide an intuitive way of understanding equation 13, and the surrounding constraints (the set P for e.g. regards the behaviour of the maps Ui which could move against the exploding direction ensuring that gradients do not explodes). Another interesting connection is with our geometrical interpretation. If there is indeed such a boundary, that means not only that when crossed the norm of the gradient grows considerably, but it can do so quickly, i.e. the curvature has to be high as well. This speaks towards our hypothesis that both gradients and curvature tend to explode together."

      "text" : "One approach to avoid exploding gradients is to use L1 or L2 penalty on the recurrent weights. Given that the model is initialized with small numbers, the spectral radius of Wrec is probably smaller than 1, from which it follows that the gradient can not explode (see necessary condition found in section 2.1). The regularization term can ensure that during training the spectral radius never exceeds 1.\nThis approach limits the model to a simple regime (with a single point attractor at the origin), where any information inserted in the model has to die out exponentially fast in time. In such a regime we can not train a generator network, nor can we exhibit long term memory traces.\nThis suggest that solutions that exploit changes in the architecture to avoid vanishing gradients, such as LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) can deal with the exploding gradient by operating the recurrent model in a damping regime and relying exclusively on the highly specialized LSTM units to exhibit memory, thus justifying why the exploding gradient does not seem to be an issue in practice.\nDoya (1993) proposes to pre-program the model (to initialize the model in the right regime) or to use teacher forcing. The first proposal assumes that if the model exhibits from the beginning the same kind of asymptotic behaviour as the one required by the target, then there is no need to cross a bifurcation boundary. The downside is that one can not always know the required asymptotic behaviour, and, even if such information is known, it is not trivial to initialize a model in this specific regime. We should also note that such initialization does not prevent crossing the boundary between basins of attraction, which, as showed, could happen even though no bifurcation boundary is crossed.\nTeacher forcing is a more interesting and not very well understood solution. It can be seen as a way of initializing the model in the right regime and the right region of space. It has been showed that in practice it can reduce the chance that gradients explode, and even allow training generator models or models that\nwork with unbounded amounts of memory(Pascanu and Jaeger, 2011; Doya and Yoshizawa, 1991). One important downside is that it requires a target to be defined at every time step. It also requires expertise, as models trained with it have a tendency to be unstable.\nAnother approach was proposed by Tomas Mikolov recently described in his PhD thesis (Mikolov, 2012) involves clipping the gradient element-wise if the value exceeds in absolute value a fix threshold. This approach has been showed to do well in practice and it forms the backbone of our approach, which tries to justify this implementation trick."

For the ‘text8‘ experiment, our model is much smaller than the one used for state of the art results (for computational reasons) and hence the numbers are higher."

We use mini-batch gradient descent with 1000 examples per batch. The task is considered solved if for 1000 consecutive inputs the model returns the correct answer. Figure 7 shows the success rate of standard BPTT and gradient rescaling for 50 different runs. Note that for sequences longer than 20 the vanishing gradient problem ensures that neither BPTT nor our algorithm can solve the task.\nThis task provides empirical evidence that the exploding gradient is linked with tasks that require long memory traces. We know that initially the model operates in the one-attractor regime (i.e. ρWrec < 1), in which the amount of memory is controlled by ρWrec . More memory means larger spectral radius, and, when this value crosses a certain threshold the model enters rich regimes where gradients are likely to explode. We see in Figure 7 that as long as the vanishing gradient problem does not become an issue, addressing the exploding gradient ensures a much larger success rate."

      "text" : "The exploding gradient problem is just one facet of the difficulty of training recurrent networks. We provided different perspectives through which one can gain more insight into this issue, though these descriptions can easily be useful for also understanding the vanishing gradient problem. We propose a\nsolution that involves clipping the norm of the exploded gradients when it is too large. The algorithm is motivated by the assumption that when gradients explode, the curvature explodes as well, and we are faced with a specific pattern in the error surface, namely a valley with a single steep wall. In practice we show that this approach improves performance on all of the 6 tested tasks."
