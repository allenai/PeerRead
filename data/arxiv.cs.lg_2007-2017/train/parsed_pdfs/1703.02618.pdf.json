      "text" : "Recently, non-linear methods such as node embeddings and graph convolutional networks (GCN) demonstrated a large gain in quality for SSL tasks. ese methods introduce multiple components and greatly vary on how the graph structure, seed label information, and other features are used.\nWe aim here to study the contribution of non-linearity, as an isolated ingredient, to the performance gain. To do so, we place classic linear graph di usions in a self-training framework. Surprisingly, we observe that SSL using the resulting bootstrapped di usions not only signi cantly improves over the respective non-bootstrapped baselines but also outperform state-of-the-art non-linear SSL methods. Moreover, since the self-training wrapper retains the scalability of the base method, we obtain both higher quality and be er scalability."

      "text" : "Graph data is prevalent and models entities (nodes) and the strong interactions between them (edges). e source of these graphs can naturally come with the provided interactions (social networks, views, likes, purchases, messages, links) or can be derived from metric data (embedded entities) by retaining only edges that correspond to closest neighbors.\nA fundamental task arises when label information is available only for a small set of seed entities (x j ,y j ) j ≤ n` and we are interested in learning labels for all other entities xi for i ∈ (n` ,n` + nu ]. See e.g. the surveys [8, 38]. e learning uses some smoothness assumption that similarity derived from the graph structure implies similarity of labels. O en the graph structure is combined with other features by the learning algorithms.\nClassic methods for semi-supervised learning and many other related fundamental graph tasks (clustering, centrality, in uence) are based on some underlying di usion process that propagates from a node or set of nodes through the edges of the graph. e di usion de nes dense ne a nity relations between nodes using\nthe provided sparse set of strong interactions. With SSL, the a nity relation guides the label learning, for example, by a weighted aggregation of seed labels to obtain so labels.\nMost popular SSL methods can be interpreted through underlying spectral di usions [9], utilizing the graph Laplacian, graph cuts [5, 6], and random walks. ey include label propagation [44], label propagation using the normalized graph Laplacian [25, 42], and many variations. e methods are highly scalable and implemented using Jacobi iterations that roughly translate into repeated averaging over neighboring nodes. e algorithms are applied successfully to massive graphs with billions of edges [33] using highly distributed platforms [26].\nAnother class of graph di usions, which we refer to here as social, underline classic social and economic models of centrality [3, 4, 14, 18, 30, 34], in uence [13, 17, 19, 23], and similarity [12] of nodes. Social di usion propagate along shortest-paths (distance di usion) or reachability searches (reach di usion). A powerful extension de nes a generative model from a graph by randomizing the presence (with reach di usion) or the length (with distance di usion) of edges [12, 13, 17, 19, 23] and then works with respective expectations. Social di usion, inspired by the independent cascade model of [23] and the continuous time (distance-based) model of [12, 13, 17, 19] was recently adapted to SSL [11]. e proposed algorithms scale very well: For the simpler nearest-seed variant which matches each label to the closest seed node in each simulation of the randomized model we simply use small number of graph (Dijkstra) searches. e use of distance or reachability sketching based on [10] allows for highly scalable label learning also over the sketched a nity matrix.\nBoth spectral and social di usion based SSL models scale well even with a large number of labels, using heavy hi er sketches with label propagation [33] or naturally with social di usion using sketches. We interpret these methods as linear in the sense that the di usion propagates from seeds through edges without amplifying strong signals or suppressing weak ones.\nRecently proposed non-linear learning methods, based on node embeddings and graph convolutional networks, had impressive success in improving the quality of the learned labels. In particular, DeepWalk [32] applied the hugely successful word embedding framework of [27] to embed the graph nodes in a way that preserves the a nity relation de ned by co-occurrence frequencies of pairs in short random walks: A so max applied to inner products of embeddings approximates the frequency of the pair. A supervised learning algorithm is then trained on the embedding vectors and labels of seed nodes. Node2vec [20] re ned the approach using hyperparameters that tune the depth and breadth of the random\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n02 61\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n5 M\nar 2\n01 7\n, , Eliav Buchnik and Edith Cohen\nwalks. Another method, Planetoid, used a multi-layer neural network instead of a single so max layer [40]. With these methods, the lower-dimensional embeddings serve as a “low rank” representation of the a nity matrix and the so max and neural network introduce non-linearities that emphasize larger inner products. Another successful proposal are Graph convolutional networks (GCN) [2, 16, 21, 24], which are neural networks with layers that follow the graph adjacency structure. Each layer applies a non-linear activation function, most o en a sigmoid or ReLU, to the aggregate over neighbors.\nis abundance of recent work introduced many new components and o en at the same time: Low-rank embeddings, non-linear propagations, learning of weights of hidden layers (GCNs), learning of node weights [29]. ese recent methods, however, while demonstrating improved labeling quality, do not scale as well as label propagation and methods based on social graph di usions.\nOur aim here is to isolate the main contributor(s) to the quality gain of the recent non-linear approaches and to seek methods that combine the scalability advantage of the simpler di usion models with state of the art labeling quality.\nWe explore placing these “linear” di usions in a self-training (bootstrapping) framework. Self-training is arguably the earliest approach to SSL, dating back ve decades to Scudder [35], and extensively studied by the NLP community [1, 39, 41]. e self-training framework can be viewed as a wrapper around a base learning algorithm. e base algorithm takes as input a set of labeled examples and makes predictions with associated margins or con dence scores for other examples. e wrapper applies the base algorithm in steps, where at the end of each step, the highest-con dence predictions are converted to become new labeled examples.\nOur bootstrapped di usions retain the high scalability of the base di usions while introducing non-linearity that allows us to work with a richer class of models. In particular, with our base algorithms, “seed” examples have a special role that is not ampli ed by implied high-con dence predictions. Bootstrapping provides such ampli cation by promoting high-margin predictions to “seed” roles.\nWe perform experiments using linear di usion models and their bootstrapped versions. We use classic Label propagation [44], Label propagation using the normalized Laplacian [42], and nearest-seed, which is the simplest distance di usion model [11]. We apply a very basic bootstrapping wrapper that works with a xed fraction of highest-margin predictions in each step. We focus on a multi-class se ing, where each node is a member of one class, even though most of the method can be extended to the multi-label se ing.\nWe apply the di erent methods to benchmark data and seed sets used and made available by previous work [24, 40]. In particular, we use social, citation, and knowledge graph data sets. We compare the quality of the learned labels to state of the art baselines, including DeepWalk [32], node2vec [20], Planetoid [40], and GCNs [24]. We also perform more elaborate experiments on additional data and seed sets and on the well-studied planted partition (stochastic block) model [15] which is o en used to understand the performance of clustering and community detection algorithms.\nOur main focus is the quality of learning from the graph structure alone using di used seed node labels. We observe that bootstrapped di usions consistently improved the quality, by 1% to 12%, over\nthe base di usion, both for spectral and social and across types of graphs. e most surprising outcome was that prediction quality on benchmark data exceeded that of all recent non-linear methods.\ne use of additional available node (or edge) features can signi cantly increase labeling quality but there are multiple ways to integrate them in the learning algorithm. We consider the use of the raw provided node features or smoothing them through a graph di usion. A simple supervised learning algorithm is then trained on the (raw or di used) feature vectors and class labels of seed nodes. We applied this method with and without bootstrapping. We observed that both di usion and bootstrapping signi cantly enhanced performance. Furthermore, our results dominated those reported (with the use of node features) by the state of the art baselines Planetoid [40] and GCNs [24]. In particular, GCNs lend themselves to a direct comparison as they can be viewed as a feature di usion with non-linearities applied a er each set of edge traverasals and node/layer weight tuned through back propagations. It is interesting that we obtained comparable or be er results using bootstrapped linear models and without backprop training.\ne paper is organized as follows. e linear base di usion we use and the bootstrapping wrapper are discussed in Section 2. Our data sets and our experimental methodology are laid out in Section 3. e results on the benchmark data are reported and discussed in Section 4. Additional experimental results using additional data and seed sets are discussed in Section 5. Detailed parameter study of the bootstrapping wrapper is provided in Section 6. Section 7 presents the experiments with feature vectors di usions. We conclude in Section 8."

      "text" : "To facilitate comparison, we use the benchmark dataset and seed set combinations used in prior work [40]. In our detailed experiments, we use additional data sets, multiple seed sets, and synthetic data sets.\nWe limited our evaluation to data sets that are multi-class but not multi-label, meaning that each node is a member of exactly one class. We note that the base and bootstrapped algorithms we use can naturally be extended to a multi-label se ing but there are di erent mechanisms to do so [11, 20] that may or may not assume that the number of classes of each node is provided. Moreover, some of the algorithms we compare with [24] do not have multi-label variants. We therefore opted to remove this variability by only considering multi-class.\nTable 1 summarizes the statistics of the datasets we used. For each dataset we report the number of nodes, edges and classes. We also list the labeling rate, which is the fraction of the nodes we used as seed labels. e data sets include three citation networks: Cora, Pubmed, and Citeseer from [36], one Knowledge graph (entity classi cation) dataset (NELL) preprocessed by [40] from [7], and the YouTube group membership data set from [28]. We preprocessed the YouTube data by removing groups with less than 500 members and not using for training or testing the users that were members of more than one group. is le us with 14355 labeled nodes to use as seed/validations/test sets.\nOur seed set selection followed [40]. For the citation networks, the seed sets contain 20 nodes randomly selected from each class. For the NELL data, with 210 classes, the seeds selection was proportional to class size with labeling rates 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001. For the YouTube data we used 50 seeds from each of the 14 classes.\ne citation and knowledge graph datasets have associated bagof-words node features which can be used to enhance prediction quality. We report experiments that use these node features in Section 7.\nWe also use synthetic data generated using the planted partition (stochastic block) random graph model [15]. ese random graphs are speci ed by a number L of equal-size classes, the total number of nodes, and two parameters q < p ∈ [0, 1]. e graph is generated by instantiating each intra-class edge independently with probability p and each inter-class edge independently with probability q. e sets of parameters we used to generate graphs are listed in Table 2. Our seed sets had an equal number of randomly selected nodes from each class.\nWe used our own Python implementation of the three base linear di usions discussed in Section 3: Label propagation (LP) [43] (Algorithm 1) Normalized Laplacian LP [42] (Algorithm 2)\nBootstrapped Graph Di usions: Exposing the Power of Nonlinearity , ,\nand Nearest Seed [11] (Algorithm 3) and also the bootstrapping wrapper (Algorithm 4).\nOur experimental study has multiple aims. e rst is to understand the a ainable precision by the di erent algorithms, base and bootstrapped, and compared it to baseline methods. For this purpose we used a wide range of hyperparameters with a validation set to prevent over ing. e second is to perform a parameter study of the bootstrapped methods. e third focuses on scalability and considers results within a speci ed computation budget.\nWe applied the following hyper/parameters. We run all bootstrapped algorithms with r ∈ {0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3} as the fraction of nodes selected as seeds in each step (see Algorithm 4). For bootstrapped LP and bootstrapped normalized Laplacian LP we used {10, 20, 40, 100} iterations of the base LP algorithm in each step. For the nearest-seed we used {25, 75, 100, 400} iterations in each step. For the normalized Laplacian we used return probabilities {0.0001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5} and for the nearestseed we used∆ ∈ {1, 10, 50, 100}. In retrospect, all our o set choices for nearest-seed had similar performance results. e normalized Laplacian LP consistently performed best with return probabilities in the range {0.1, 0.2}.

For LP we used a validation set to select the iteration to use (as discussed in Section 2) whereas with the normalized Laplacian LP and nearest-seed we took the last iteration."

Our evaluation in this section is intended to study the a ainable quality by the di erent methods and we therefore use a generous range of hyperparameters. An important issue was that a separate validation set was not available with the benchmark data and moreover, because of unknown mappings, we could not produce one from the original raw data without overlapping with the provided seed and test sets. To facilitate a fair comparison that provides learned labels for all test set nodes without over ing (for all methods with hyperparameters), we did the following: We randomly partitioned each provided test set to two equal parts A,B and performed two sets of executions: In one set A was used as a validation set for hyperparameter selection and B for testing and vice versa.\ne results are reported in Table 3 for the three linear di usion methods, their bootstrapped variants, and the following baseline methods:\n• node2vec [20]: We used the published Python code of [20] (which builds on [27, 32]) to compute an embedding. We then applied logistic regression trained on the embeddings\nand labels of the seed to learn labels for other nodes. e method uses two hyperparameters (p,q) to tradeo the depth and breadth components of the random walks. We used all combinations of the values {0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0} forp,q and set other hyperparameters (10 epochs, 10 walks, walk length 80, embedding dimension 128) as in [20] . We use the same validation/test splits to prevent over ing. • DeepWalk [32]: e parameter se ing p = q = 1.0 with node2vec implements DeepWalk. We list the results we obtained in this implementation. For reference, we also list the results as reported in [40] using a di erent implementation. • Planetoid-G [40]. Planetoid uses embeddings obtained using a multi-layer neural network, building on the graph relations captured by DeepWalk. Planetoid-G is the (transductive) variant that does not use the node features. We report the results as listed in [40]. • Transductive support vector machines (TSVM) [22], for which we list the results reported in [40] when available – due to scalability issues. • Graph convolutional networks (GCN): Kipf and Welling [24] used the benchmark data and seed sets of [40] but only reported results with the use of node features. We only list their results on the NELL dataset, where node features did not enhance performance according to [40].\nWe can see that the bootstrapped variants consistently improve over the base methods. We also observe that (except in one case), the best result over all methods, including the baselines, is obtained by a bootstrapped di usion method. We can also observe that the base linear methods, the classic spectral and the recent social, perform competitively to state of the art and the bootstrapping elevates performance to above it. We note that the results for LP reported in [40] used a di erent implementation (Junto with a xed number of 100 iterations)."

In this set of experiments we xed all other parameters of each algorithm as indicated in the legends of the gure and used a xed value r = 0.03 for the fraction of nodes that become new\nseeds in each step. e results are averaged over 10 random splits of the data. e Figure shows di erent pa erns but all are unimodal\n, , Eliav Buchnik and Edith Cohen\nwhich means they allow us to incorporate a stopping criteria for the bootstrapping algorithm."

      "text" : "Optimizing quality is important when labeling is costly. O en, however, on very large graphs, scalability is critical. e computation cost of the methods we considered, social and spectral, bootstrapped or not, depends on the total number of iterations performed.\nWith label propagation, in each iteration for each node we compute an average over its neighbors. e averaging for di erent nodes in the same iteration are independent and can be distributed or parallelized. But the iterations sequentially depend on each other. e computation of each iteration involves a linear number of edge traversals and is highly suitable for Pregel-like [26] distributed graph processing platforms.\nWith distance di usion, each iteration is equivalent to a singlesource shortest-paths computation. e number of edge traversals performed is also linear. e iterations here are independent, and can be performed concurrently, each providing independent samples from a distribution. e shortest-path search performed in each iteration, however, has concurrency that depends on the number of hops in the shortest-paths. is computation can also be performed e ciently on Pregel [26] by essentially performing all iterations (di erent sets of hash-speci ed edge lengths) together. With bootstrapping, the steps must be sequential and in each step we run the base algorithm with multiple iterations.\nIn this set of experiments we study the precision we obtain using a xed total number of iterations, for di erent sets of bootstrapping\nparameters. e plots in Figure 5 show precision as a function of the number of iterations performed in each bootstrapping step. Each graph corresponds to a xed budget of iterations (between 25 and 400 iterations). e number of iterations performed per step varies between 5 and the full budget. When all iterations are performed in one step, that is, when the number of iterations per step is equal to the total budget, we have the precision of the non-bootstrapped base algorithm. When we partition the iterations budget to multiple steps we reduce the e ectiveness of the base algorithm in each step but can leverage the power of bootstrapping.\nRecall that the normalized Laplacian LP and nearest-seed improve with more iterations per step whereas LP may not. We can see that the non-bootstrapped LP algorithm degrades with more iterations (recall that in other experiments we treated the number of iterations with LP it as a hyperparameter). e plot for the Pubmed dataset show that with all budgets, quality picks at 10 iterations per step. With normalized Laplacian LP and nearest-seed (which only improve with iterations), we see that bootstrapped methods with 25 total iterations outperforms the non-bootstrapped algorithms with many more iterations.\nFinally, we consider the parameter r , which determines the fraction of nodes that are instantiated as new seeds in each step. Generally bootstrapping performance improves with smaller values of the parameter r . But with limited iteration budget, and limited number of steps, very low values limit the progress for the bootstrapping. e bo om right plot in Figure 5 shows a sweet spot at r = 0.1.\nBootstrapped Graph Di usions: Exposing the Power of Nonlinearity , ,"

      "text" : "In the previous sections we focused on methods that learn labels using only the graph structure: e provided labels of seed nodes are “di used” along graph edges to obtain so labels for all nodes that are then used for prediction. When we have more information, in the form of node feature vectors f i for all nodes i ≤ n` +nu , we can use it for learning. e simplest method, which does not use the graph structure, is to train a supervised classi er on the features and labels of seed nodes ( f̃ i ,yi ) i ≤ n` . We can instead use the graph structure to obtain di used feature vectors f̃ i . e di used vectors are a smoothed version of the raw vectors that also re ect features of related nodes, where relation is according to the base di usion process. Note that the di used vectors f̃ i do not depend on the set of seed nodes or their labels. A supervised classi erC can then be trained on the di used features and labels of seed nodes: ( f̃ i ,yi ) i ≤ n` . When the classi er provides a prediction margin with each classi cation C( f̃ i ) for i > n` , it can be bootstrapped (see algorithm 4).\nWe evaluated two di usion methods. Feature Propagation (FP), in Algorithm 5, that uses the di usion rule of the label propagation method of [43] (Algorithm 1), and Normalized Laplacian FP, in Algorithm 6, that uses the di usion rule of [42] (Algorithm 2).

      "heading" : "8 CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We studied the application of self-training, which is perhaps the most basic form of introducing non-linearity, to SSL methods based on linear graph di usions. We observed that the resulting bootstrapped di usions ubiquitously improved labeling quality over the respective base methods on a variety of real-world and synthetic data sets. Moreover, we obtain state-of-the-art quality, previously achieved by more complex methods, while retaining the high scalability of the base methods.\nOur results are a proof of concept that uses the simplest base algorithms and bootstrapping wrapper. Some natural extensions include ne tuning of the wrapper together with base algorithms that provide more precise con dence scores and the use of a richer set of base algorithms.\nOn a nal note, we recall that spectral and social graph di usions are an important tool in graph mining: ey are the basis of centrality, in uence, and similarity measures of a node or sets of\nnodes in a network [4, 9, 12–14, 17, 19, 23, 30, 31] and also underline community detection and local clustering algorithms [37]. Our work suggests that substantial gains in quality might be possible by using bootstrapped di usions as an alternative to classic ones in these wider contexts. We hope to pursue this in future work."

    "abstractText" : "Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms predict labels for all nodes based on provided labels of a small set of seed nodes. Classic methods capture the graph structure through some underlying diusion process that propagates through the graph edges. Spectral diusion, which includes personalized page rank and label propagation, propagates through random walks. Social diusion propagates through shortest paths. A common ground to these diusions is their linearity, which does not distinguish between contributions of few “strong” relations and many “weak” relations. Recently, non-linear methods such as node embeddings and graph convolutional networks (GCN) demonstrated a large gain in quality for SSL tasks. ese methods introduce multiple components and greatly vary on how the graph structure, seed label information, and other features are used. We aim here to study the contribution of non-linearity, as an isolated ingredient, to the performance gain. To do so, we place classic linear graph diusions in a self-training framework. Surprisingly, we observe that SSL using the resulting bootstrapped diusions not only signicantly improves over the respective non-bootstrapped baselines but also outperform state-of-the-art non-linear SSL methods. Moreover, since the self-training wrapper retains the scalability of the base method, we obtain both higher quality and beer scalability.",
