The key ideas are that structure priors are defined via a probability tree and that the pro­ posal distribution for the Metropolis-Hastings al­ gorithm is defined using the prior, thereby defin­ ing a cheaply computable acceptance probabil­ ity. We have applied this approach to Bayesian net structure learning using a number of priors and proposal distributions. Our results show that these must be chosen appropriately for this ap­ proach to be successful.",
