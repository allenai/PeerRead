      "text" : "Recommendation systems advise users on which items (movies, musics, books etc.) they are more likely to be interested in. A good recommendation system may dramatically increase the amount of sales of a firm or retain customers. For instance, 80% of movies watched on Netflix come from the recommender system of the company (Gomez-Uribe & Hunt, 2015). One efficient way to design such algorithm is to predict how a user would rate a given item. Two key methods co-exist to tackle this issue: Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering (CF).\nPreliminary work. Under review by the under review by the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML),\nContent-Based Filtering explicitly uses the user/item knowledge to estimate a new rating. For instance, user information can be the age, gender or graph of friends etc. Item information can be the movie genre, a short description or the tags. CF uses the ratings history of users and items. The feedback of one user on some items is combined with the feedback of all other users on all items to predict a new rating. For instance, if someone rated a few books, Collaborative Filtering aims at estimating the ratings he would have given to thousands of other books by using the ratings of all the other readers. CF is often preferred to Content-Based Filtering because it wins the agnostic vs. studied contest: CF only relies on the ratings of the users while Content-Based Filtering requires advanced engineering on items to perform well (Lops et al., 2011).\nThe most successful approach in CF is to retrieve potential latent factors from the sparse matrix of ratings. Book latent factors are likely to encapsulate the book genre (spy novel, fantasy, etc.) or some writing styles. Common latent factor techniques compute a low-rank rating matrix by applying Singular Value Decomposition through gradient descent (Koren et al., 2009) or Regularized Alternative Least Square algorithm (Zhou et al., 2008). However, these methods are linear and cannot catch subtle factors. Newer algorithms were explored to face those constraints such as Non Linear Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (Lawrence & Urtasun, 2009), Factorization Machines (Rendle, 2010) or Local Low Rank Matrix Approximation (Lee et al., 2013).\nAnother limitation of CF is known as the cold start problem: how to recommend an item to a user when no rating exists for neither the user nor the item ? To overcome this issue, one idea is to build a hybrid model mixing CF and Content Based Filtering where side information is integrated into the training process. The goal is to supplant the lack of ratings through side information. A successful approach (Adams & Murray, 2010; Porteous & A. U. Asuncion, 2010) extends the Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization Framework (Salakhutdinov & Mnih, 2008) to in-\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n00 80\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 2\nM ar\n2 01\ntegrate side information. However, recent algorithms outperform them in the general case (Lee et al., 2012).\nIn this paper we introduce a CF approach based on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2010) which tackles both challenges: learning a non-linear representation of users and items, and alleviating the cold start problem by integrating side information. Compared to previous attempts in that direction (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007; Sedhain et al., 2015; Strub & Mary, 2015; Dziugaite & Roy, 2015), our framework integrates the sparse matrix of ratings and side information in a unique Network. This joint model leads to a scalable and robust approach which beats state-of-the-art results in CF. Reusable source code is provided in Lua/Torch to reproduce the results. Last but not least, we show that CF approaches based on Matrix Factorization have a strong link with our approach.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, Sec. 2 summarizes the state-of-the-art in CF and Neural Networks. Then, our model is described in Sec. 3 and 4 and its relation with Matrix Factorization is characterized in Sec. 3.2. Finally, experimental results are given and discussed in Sec. 5 and Sec. 6 discusses algorithmic aspects."

      "text" : "The proposed approach builds upon Autoencoders which are feed-forward Neural Networks popularized by Kramer (1991). They are unsupervised Networks where the output of the Network aims at reconstructing the initial input. The Network is constrained to use narrow hidden layers, forcing a dimensionality reduction on the data. The Network is trained by back-propagating the squared error loss on the reconstruction. Such Networks are divided into two parts:\n• the encoder : f(x) = σ(W1x + b1), • the decoder : g(y) = σ(W2y + b2),\nwith x ∈ RN the input, y ∈ RK the output, K the size of the Autoencoder’s bottleneck (K << N ), W1 ∈ RN×K and W2 ∈ RK×N the weight matrices, b1 ∈ RK and b2 ∈ RN the bias vectors, and σ(.) a non-linear transfer function.\nRecent work in Deep Learning advocates to stack pretrained encoders to initialize Deep Neural Networks (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). This process enables the lowest layers of the Network to find low-dimensional representations. It experimentally increases the quality of the whole Network. Yet, classic Autoencoders often degenerate into identity Networks and they fail to learn the latent relationship between data. (Vincent et al., 2010) tackle this issue by corrupting inputs, pushing the Network to denoise the final outputs. One method is to add Gaussian noise on a random\nfraction ν of the input. Another method is to mask a random fraction ν of the input by replacing them with zero. In this case, the Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE) loss function is modified to emphasize the denoising aspect of the Network. The loss is based on two main hyperparameters α, β. They balance whether the Network would focus on denoising the input (α) or reconstructing the input (β):\nL2,α,β(x, x̃) = α  ∑ j∈C(x̃) [nn(x̃)j − xj ]2 +\nβ  ∑ j 6∈C(x̃) [nn(x̃)j − xj ]2  ,\nwhere x̃ is the corrupted input x ∈ RN , C are the indices of the corrupted elements of x, nn(x)j is the jth output of the Network."

      "text" : "One of the most successful approach of Collaborative Filtering is Matrix Factorization (Koren et al., 2009). This method retrieves latent factors from the ratings of items made by the users. The underlying idea is that key features are hidden in the ratings themselves. Given N users and M items, the rating rij is the rating given by the ith user for the jth item. It entails a sparse matrix of ratings R ∈ RN×M . In Collaborative Filtering, sparsity is originally produced by missing values rather than zero values. The goal of Matrix Factorization is to find a K low rank matrix R̂ ∈ RN×M where R̂ = UVT with U ∈ RN×K and V ∈ RM×K are two matrices of rank K encoding a dense representation of the users/items with\narg min U,V ∑ (i,j)∈K(R) (rij−ūTi v̄j)2 +λ(‖ūi‖2Fro+‖v̄j‖2Fro),\nwhere K(R) is the set of indices of known ratings, ūi, v̄j are the corresponding line vectors of U ,V and ‖ūi‖Fro is the Frobenius norm."

In a preliminary work, (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007) tackled the Netflix challenge using Restricted Boltzmann Machines but little published work had follow (Truyen et al., 2009). While Deep Learning has tremendous success in image and speech recognition (LeCun et al., 2015), sparse data has received less attention and remains a challenging problem for Neural Networks.\nNevertheless, Neural Networks are able to discover nonlinear latent variables with heterogeneous data (LeCun et al., 2015) which makes them a promising tool for CF.\n(Sedhain et al., 2015; Strub & Mary, 2015; Dziugaite & Roy, 2015) directly train Autoencoders to provide the best predicted ratings. Those methods report excellent results in the general case. However, the cold start initialization problem is ignored. For instance, AutoRec (Sedhain et al., 2015) replaces unpredictable ratings by an arbitrary selected score. In our case, we apply a training loss designed for sparse rating inputs and we integrate side information to lessen the cold start effect.\nOther contributions deal with this cold start problem by using Neural Networks properties for Content-Based Filtering: Neural Networks are first trained to learn a feature representation from the item which is then processed obtain a CF approach such as Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (Mnih & Salakhutdinov, 2007) to provide the final rating. For instance, (Glorot et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014a) respectively auto-encode bag-of-words from restaurant reviews and movie plots, (Li et al., 2015) auto-encode heterogeneous side information from users and items. Finally, (den Oord et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014b) use Convolutional Networks on music samples. In our case, side information and ratings are used together without any unsupervised pretreatment."

The Collaborative Filtering objective can be formulated as: turn the sparse vectors ui/vj , into dense vectors ûi/v̂j .\nWe propose to perform this conversion with Autoencoders. To do so, we need to define two types of Autoencoders:\n• U-CFN is defined as nn(ui) = ûi, • V-CFN is defined as nn(vj) = v̂j .\nThe encoding part of these Autoencoder aims at building a low-rank dense representation of the sparse input of ratings. The decoding part aims at predicting a dense vector of ratings from the low-rank dense representation of the encoder. This new approach differs from classic Autoencoders which only aim at reconstructing/denoising the input. As we will see later, the training loss will then differ from the evaluation one."

      "heading" : "3.1. Sparse Inputs",
      "text" : "There is no standard approach for using sparse vectors as inputs of Neural Networks. Most of the papers dealing with sparse inputs get around by pre-computing an estimate of the missing values (Tresp et al., 1994; Bishop, 1995). In our case, we want the Autoencoder to handle this prediction issue by itself. Such problems have already been studied in industry (Miranda et al., 2012) where 5% of the values are missing. However in Collaborative Filtering we often face datasets with more than 95% missing values. Furthermore, missing values are not known during training in Collaborative Filtering which makes the task even more difficult.\nOur approach includes three ingredients to handle the training of sparse Autoencoders:\n• inhibit the edges of the input layers by zeroing out values in the input,\n• inhibit the edges of the output layers by zeroing out back-propagated values,\n• use a denoising loss to emphasize rating prediction over rating reconstruction.\nOne way to inhibit the input edges is to turn missing values to zero. To keep the Autoencoder from always returning zero, we also use an empirical loss that disregards the loss of unknown values. No error is back-propagated for missing values. Therefore, the error is back-propagated for actual zero values while it is discarded for missing values. In other words, missing values do not bring information to the Network. This operation is equivalent to removing the neurons with missing values described in (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007; Sedhain et al., 2015). However, Our method has important computational advantages because only one Neural Networks is trained whereas other techniques has to share the weights among thousands of Networks.\nFinally, we take advantage of the masking noise from the Denoising AutoEncoders (DAE) empirical loss. By simulating missing values in the training process, Autoencoders are trained to predict them. In Collaborative Filtering, this prediction aspect is actually the final target. Thus, emphasizing the prediction criterion turns the classic unsupervised training of Autoencoders into a simulated supervised learning. By mixing both the reconstruction and prediction criteria, the training can be thought as a pseudo-semisupervised learning. This makes the DAE loss a promising objective function. After regularization, the final training loss is:\nL2,α,β(x, x̃) = α  ∑ j∈C(x̃)∩K(x) [nn(x̃)j − xj ]2 +\nβ  ∑ j 6∈C(x̃)∩K(x) [nn(x̃)j − xj ]2 + λ|W|2Fro,\nwhere K(x) are the indices of known values of x, W is the flatten vector of weights and λ is the regularization hyperparameter. The full forward/backward process is explained in Figure 1. Importantly, Autoencoders with sparse inputs differs from sparse-Autoencoders (Lee et al., 2006) or Dropout regularization (Srivastava et al., 2014) in the sense that Sparse Autoencoders and Droupout inhibit the hidden neurons while inputs/outputs are actually known."

For an Autoencoder with only one hidden layer\nand no output transfer function, the response of the network can be written as\nnn(x) = W2 σ(W1x + b1) + b2,\nwhere W1,W2 are the weights matrices and b1,b2 the bias terms. Up to the bias term b2, if we replace x by the representation ui of the user i, we recover a predicted vector ûi of the form Vūi:\nûi = nn(ui) = W2︸︷︷︸ V σ(W1ui + b1)︸ ︷︷ ︸ ūi +b2.\nSymmetrically, v̂j has the form Uv̄j:\nv̂j = nn(vj) = W ′ 2︸︷︷︸\nU\nσ(W′1vj + b ′ 1)︸ ︷︷ ︸\nv̄j\n+b′2.\nFor the Matrix Factorization by ALS ; R̂ is iteratively built by solving for each row i of U (resp. column j of VT) a penalized least square regression using the known values of the ith row of R (resp. jth column of R) as observations of a scalar product in dimension k of ūi and a column of VT (resp v̄i and a row of U). An Autoencoder replaces the regularization introduced by the alternate scheme by a projection in dimension k composed with the non linearity σ. This process corresponds to a non linear matrix factorization.\nNote that CFN breaks the symmetry between U and V. For example, while Matrix Factorization approaches learn both U and V, U-CFN learns V and only indirectly learns U: U-CFN targets the function to build ūi whatever the row ui. A direct benefit is that the learned Autoencoder is able to fill in every vector ui, even if that vector was not in the training data.\nFinally, both non-linear decompositions on rows and columns are done independently, which means that the matrix V learned by U-CFN from rows can differ from the concatenation of vectors v̄j predicted by V-CFN from columns."

      "heading" : "4. Integrating side information",
      "text" : "Collaborative Filtering only relies on the feedback of users regarding a set of items. When additional information is available for the users and the items, this can sound restrictive. One would think that adding more information can help in several ways: increasing the prediction accuracy, speeding up the training, increasing the robustness of the model, etc. Furthermore, pure Collaborative Filtering suffers from the cold start problem: when very little information is available on an item, Collaborative Filtering will have difficulties recommending it. When bad recommendation are provided, the probability to receive valuable feedback is lowered leading to a vicious circle for new items.\nA common way to tackle this problem is to add some side information to ensure a better initialization of the system. This is known in the recommendation community as hybridization.\nThe simplest approach to integrate side information is to append additional user/item bias to the rating prediction (Koren et al., 2009):\nr̂ij = ū T i v̄j + bu,i + bu,j + b ′,\nwhere bu,i, bu,j , b′ are respectively the user, item, and global bias of the Matrix Factorization. Computing these bias can be done through hand-crafted engineering or Collaborative Filtering technique. For instance, one method is to extend the dense feature vectors by directly appending side information on them (Porteous & A. U. Asuncion, 2010). Therefore, the estimated rating is computed by:\nr̂ij = {ūi,xi} ⊗ {v̄j ,yj} def = ūT[1:k],iv̄[1:k],j + ū\nT [k+1:k+p],iyj︸ ︷︷ ︸\nbv,j\n+ v̄T[k+1:k+p],jxi︸ ︷︷ ︸ bu,i ,\nwhere xi ∈ RP and yj ∈ RQ are respectively a vector representation of side information for the user and the item. If we decompose the previous scalar product, ūT[1:k],iv̄[1:k],j is the classic Matrix Factorization term, ūT[k+1:k+p],iyj is the linear regression of the dense user representation and the item side information, v̄T[k+1:k+p],jxj is the linear regression of the dense item representation and the user side information. For users, they can encode the genre, the age, job, circle of friends and so on. For items, they can be tags, a bag of words etc.\nUnfortunately, those methods cannot be directly applied to Neural Networks because Autoencoders optimize U and V independently. New strategies must be designed to incorporate side information. One notable example for bitext word alignment was recently made by (Ammar et al., 2014).\nIn our case, the first idea would be to append the side information to the sparse input vector. For simplicity purpose, the next equations will only focus on shallow U-Autoencoders with no output transfer functions. Yet, this can be extended to more complex Networks and VAutoencoders. Therefore, we would get:\nnn({ui,xi}) = V σ(W′1{ui,xi}+ b1) + b2 = ûi,\nwhere W′1 ∈ Rk×(n+p) is a weight matrix . When no previous rating exist, it enables the Neural Networks to have at an input to predict new ratings. With this scenario, side information is assimilated to pseudo-ratings that will always\nexist for every items. However, when the dimension of the Neural Network input is far greater than the dimension of the side information, the Autoencoder may have difficulties to use it efficiently.\nYet, common Matrix Factorization would append side information to dense feature representations {ūi,xi} rather than sparse feature representation as we just proposed {ui,xi}. Thus, one way to reproduce this idea is to inject the side information to every layer inputs of the Network.\nnn({ui,xi}) = V′ { ū′︷ ︸︸ ︷ σ(W′1{ui,xi}+ b1),xi}+ b2\n= V′ {ū′i,xi}+ b2 = V′[1:k]ū ′ i + V\n′ [k+1:k+p]xi︸ ︷︷ ︸\nbu,i\n+b2,\nwhere V′ ∈ R(n×k+p) is a weight matrix, V′[1:k] ∈ Rn×k,V′[k+1:k+p] ∈ R\nn×p are respectively the submatrices of V′ that contain the columns from 1 to k and k+ 1 to k + p.\nBy injecting the side information in every layer, the dynamic Autoencoders representation is forced to integrate this new data. In addition, the output layer computes a linear regression of the side information. However, we do not want the side information to overstep the dense rating representation. Thus, we enforced the following constraint. The dimension of the sparse input must be greater than the dimension of the Autoencoder bottleneck which must be greater than the dimension of the side information 1:"

It is competitive compared to the state-of-the-art Collaborative Filtering algorithms and clearly outperforms them for MovieLens-10M.

The confidence interval of CFN is also low on large datasets which make him a robust algorithm for Collaborative Filtering.\nIn the experiments, V-CFN outperforms U-CFN. It suggests that the structure on the items is stronger than the one on users i.e. it is easier to guess tastes based on movies you liked than to find some users similar to you. Of course, the behavior could be different on some other data .\nAt first sight, the use of side information has a limited impact on the RMSE. This statement has to be mitigated: as the repartition of known entries in the dataset is not uniform, the estimates are biased towards users and items with a lot of ratings. For theses users and movies, the dataset already contains a lot of information, thus having some extra information will have a marginal effect. Users and items with few ratings should benefit more from some side information but the estimation biais hides them.\nIn order to exhibit the utility of side information, we report in Table 3 the RMSE conditionally to the number of missing values for items. As expected, the fewer number of ratings for an item, the more important the side information. A more careful analysis of the RMSE improvement in this setting shows that the improvement is uniformly distributed over the users whatever their number of ratings. This corresponds to the fact that the available side information is only about items. This is very desirable for a real system: the ef-\nfective use of side information to the new items is crucial to deal with the flow of new products.\nIn the end, we trained V-CFN on MovieLens-10M with either the movie genre or the matrix of tags. Both side information increase the global RMSE by 0.1% and concatenating them increase the final score by a small margin of 0.15%. Therefore, V-CFN could handle the heterogeneity of side information.

In our case, we tackle the issue by selectively densifying the inputs just before sending them to the GPUs cores without modification of the result of the computation. It introduces an overhead on the computational complexity but this implementation\n5https://github.com/*******\nallows the GPUs to work at their full strength. In practice, vectorial operations overtake the extra cost. Such approach is an efficient strategy to handle sparse data which achieves a balance between memory footprint and computational time. We are able to train Large Neural Networks within a few minutes as shown in Table 4. At the time of writing, alternative strategies to train networks with sparse inputs on GPUs are under development."

      "text" : "Implicit feedback may greatly enhance the quality of Collaborative Filtering algorithms (Koren et al., 2009; Rendle, 2010). For instance, Implicit feedback would be incorporated to CFN by feeding the Network with an additional binary input. By doing so, (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007) enhance the quality of prediction for Restricted Boltzmann Machine on the Netflix Dataset. Additionally, Content Based Technique with Deep learning such as (den Oord et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014b) would be plugged to CFN. The idea would be to train a joint Network that would directly link the raw item features to the ratings such as music, pictures or word representations. As a different topic, V-CFN and U-CFN does not always report the same type of errors. This is more likely to happen when they are fed with side information. One interesting work would be to combine a suitable Network that mix them both. Finally, other metrics exist to estimate the quality of Collaborative Filtering to fit other real-world constraints. Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (Järvelin & Kekäläinen, 2002) or F-score are often sometimes preferred to RMSE/MAE and should be benchmarked."

      "text" : "In this paper, we have introduced a Neural Network architecture, aka CFN, to perform Collaborative Filtering with side information. Contrary to other attempts with Neural Networks, this joint Network integrate side information and learn a non-linear representation of users or items into a unique Neural Network. This approach manages to both beats state of the art results in CF and ease the cold start problem on the MovieLens and Douban datasets. CFN is also scalable and robust to deal with large size dataset. We made several claims that Autoencoders are closely linked\nto low-rank Matrix Factorization in Collaborative Filtering. Finally, a reusable source code is provided in Torch and hyperparameters are provided to reproduce the results."

    "abstractText" : "Collaborative Filtering aims at exploiting the feedback of users to provide personalised recommendations. Such algorithms look for latent variables in a large sparse matrix of ratings. They can be enhanced by adding side information to tackle the well-known cold start problem. While Neural Networks have tremendous success in image and speech recognition, they have received less attention in Collaborative Filtering. This is all the more surprising that Neural Networks are able to discover latent variables in large and heterogeneous datasets. In this paper, we introduce a Collaborative Filtering Neural network architecture aka CFN which computes a non-linear Matrix Factorization from sparse rating inputs and side information. We show experimentally on the MovieLens and Douban dataset that CFN outperforms the state of the art and benefits from side information. We provide an implementation of the algorithm as a reusable plugin for Torch, a popular Neural Network framework.",
