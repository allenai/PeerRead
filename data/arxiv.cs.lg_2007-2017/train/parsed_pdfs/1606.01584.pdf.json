      "text" : "Nowadays machine learning is used in a number of diverse applications. In the security domain, the use of machine learning techniques has become very important due to the emergence of big data. Machine learning techniques are widely used in areas such as biometric authentication [14], speaker identification [12], malware detection in mobile platforms [17] etc.\nIn the security domain, the learning components are not static - they are continuously trained with new incoming data. This allows the classifier to adapt to changes in the system. For example, consider a biometric authentication system that uses machine learning to classify users as invalid or valid. The behavior of both the invalid and valid users will change over time. So the machine learning components need to be continuously updated to keep up with the new valid users. However, from a security perspective this opens up a new attack surface.\nIn such applications, the environment that the system operates in is not completely under the control of the learner. There might be adversary1 that actively\n1 In this paper, the terms attacker and adversary are used interchangeably, and they refer to the same thing.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 58\n4v 2\n[ cs\n.C R\n] 7\nJ un\n2 01\n6\ntries to manipulate the classifier [10]. This creates a possible vulnerability in the security system because most of the machine learning algorithms were not originally developed to operate in such adversarial environments.\nMost machine learning algorithms assume that the training and test data have the same distribution [10,7]. In the presence of an adversary, this assumption is no longer valid. The adversary can manipulate some of the training data to achieve some malicious goal - for example, to increase the false positive rate. In the case of the authentication system, this means that more invalid users will be classified as valid users.\nBarreno et al. [3] explored the poisoning attacks and broadly categorized them through two aspects. In terms of the influence that an attacker has over the training data, they classified the attack as causative and exploratory. In causative attacks, the attacker has knowledge of the classifier and some influence over the training data. In explorative attacks, the attacker can only probe the learner for information. In an online learning environment, the learner is susceptible to causative attacks.\nIn terms of the type of security violation, Barreno et al. classified the attacks as integrity attack and availability attack. In an integrity attack, the goal of the attacker is to increase the false positive rate. For example in an authentication system, an integrity attack would be an attempt to increase the rate of invalid users being classified as valid user.\nOver the years, various attack strategies have been developed against different learning algorithms. In this paper, we examine causative integrity attacks against a Support Vector Machine learner proposed by Biggio et al. [6] and Xiao et al. [18]. This is an important research topic because machine learning is used in a variety of environments where an adversary might be present, and SVM is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms.\nThe main contribution of this paper is a method, which we refer to as Curie2, to protect an SVM classifier against poisoned data injected by an adversary. Curie works by identifying the poisoned data points and filtering them out. To do this it relies on clustering the data in feature space, and then detecting the distances of the data points from other points in the same cluster in the (feature + label) space (Section 3.2). Experimental results (Section 5) show that our proposed method can successfully identify most of the poisoned data. The method we propose is very light weight and can be easily integrated into any existing system.\nIn the next section, we explore some background and related works. We provide a brief description of poisoning attacks against machine learning in Section 2.1. In Section 2.2, we examine the poisoning attack against SVM proposed by Baggio et al. [6] and Xiao et al. [18]. In the next section (Section 2.3), we examine some proposed solutions and their shortcomings. In Section 3, we describe the threat model and our proposed solution. We describe the experimental setup and\n2 We called our method Curie from the word cure, since the method is supposed to ”cure” the classifier from the poisone data.

Finally, we present some concluding remarks and potential future works in Section 6."

      "text" : "In many applications of machine learning in the security domain, the data is nonstationary, that is, the distribution of the data shifts over time. For example, in case, of a biometric authentication system, the features, such as walking pattern etc., for a valid user might change over time for a variety of reasons.\nThere are two ways to handle this non-stationary distribution - incremental algorithm or periodic retraining (Figure 1). In the first case, the model is updated incrementally as new data comes in, and in the second case, the data is buffered and the model is retrained periodically using the buffered data.\nIn the model with periodic retraining (Figure 1b), the inputs are stored in a buffer. The model is retrained after a fixed interval of time has passed or if the classifier performance falls below a pre-defined threshold. In our paper, this is the type of model that we are considering.\nRetraining the system opens up an attack surface [3,2]. The data for retraining is collected from an adversarial environment. This opens up the possibility that an attacker could inject specially crafted data in the new training data\nwith the goal of increasing the false positive rate. In the case of authentication system, this would mean that the retrained system will not be able to detect some invalid users.\nIn the next sub-section, we will discuss some proposed poison attack mechanisms against SVM classifier."

      "heading" : "2.2 Poisoning Attack against SVM",
      "text" : "In SVM, the fundamental idea is to find a decision surface in the feature space that separates the training data based on the class labels [9]. To perform a poisoning attack against SVM, the attacker inserts some data in the training data with the labels flipped [6,18].\nIn all the attack scenario described, the ability of the attacker is over-estimated. It is assumed that the attacker has complete knowledge of the classification system, and has the capability to insert some data into the retraining data.\nThe naive way to perform the attack is to randomly flip the labels of the data to be used for retraining. This is equivalent to adding noise to the training data [18]. Another way is to select the points that are near the support vectors and flip their labels. A third way is to select points that are farthest from the support vectors and flip the labels.\nAnother method [5] is to select a combination of points that maximizes the classification error (or false positive rate). The problem with this approach, however, is that selection of the optimal set of such points is unfeasible for many real world data due to data size.\nMore intelligent methods of selecting the data points to flip have been proposed. These methods [18,6] works by selecting points that maximizes the loss function of the SVM classifier. In the work by Xiao et al. [18], a set of points is selected based on the loss maximization framework and their labels are flipped. In the work by Baggio et al.[6], some data points are selected and they are moved to other points in the feature space such that the loss is maximized. According to the results presented, both methods work very well in deteriorating the classification accuracy. In this paper, this is the type of attack we are addressing.\nIn the next sub-section, we will describe some proposed solutions to protect a classsifier from poisoning attack."

      "heading" : "2.3 Previous Methods to protect against Poisoning Attack",
      "text" : "There are a few methods proposed for protection against poisoning attack. The first approach is to develop secure classifiers that are resistant to the attack. Most of the works [8,7] on secure classifier algorithms uses a game theory model - the problem is modeled as a game between the adversary and the learner. The problem with this approach is that it is difficult to integrate with existing systems. Since our goal is to protect a system that uses SVM, this method is not of interest.\nAnother method is to use multiple classifiers [4]. In the approach proposed, the poisoned data are treated as outliers and an ensemble of classifiers is used.\nHowever, a shortcoming of this method that they use from 3 to 50 base classifiers. The use of this many multiple classifiers is very resource intensive for learner. In addition, in the experiments performed in that work, they did not use the more intelligent methods [6,18] of generating the poison data.\nA third approach is to hide information about the classifier from the adversary. However, as mentioned in Section 2.2, we are considering the worst case scenario where he attacker has complete knowledge of the classifier. So, we will not consider this approach.\nIn this paper, we consider the poisoning attack with gradient ascent proposed by Biggio and Xiao [6,18]. As far as we know, there has been no work done the SVM classifier against such attacks. In the next section, we will describe the threat model and our methodology to protect SVM against such attack."

We propose a method to protect an SVM classifier from this type of poison attack. Our goal is to develop a method that can identify the attack points added by the adversary, and filter them out before the data is used for retraining.\nIn this section we will discuss the threat model first.

In the real world, the adversary is not likely to possess complete knowledge about the classifier. So, the adversary would perform exploratory attacks first. In our case, we make the assumption that the adversary has complete knowledge of the classifier for simplicity 3.\nAssume that there is a classifier that uses SVM. For simplicity, assume that we are dealing with a two class classification - positive and negative classes. In the attack scenario considered in this paper, the attacker has the capability to inject some data into the training data. In the experiments presented is Section 4, we consider different cases according to the amount of data that the attacker has added.\nThe attacker injects as few specially crafted data points as possible so that the false positive rate is increased. So, the objective of the attack is to increase the number of negative class misclassified as positive, without significantly changing\n3 By complete knowledge we mean that the adversary knows everything about the classifier - from the training data to the hyper-parameters used.\nthe number of positive class misclassified as negative. The attack points are generated using the method proposed by Biggio et al. [6]. The attack method proposed by Xioa et al. [18] is very similar. So, we consider only one attack method in this paper."

      "heading" : "3.2 Curie - Poison Points Filter",
      "text" : "The core idea of our proposed method, Curie, lies in the identification of the data points that the attacker has added. We will refer to this data as poison points. Once these poison points are identified, they can be filtered out before the data is used for retraining the classifier. Figure 2 shows how our method fits in with the existing periodic retraining model.\nIn the model with periodic retraining (Figure 1b) described in Section 2.1, the attacker injects the poison points in the buffer. So, in our method, we add a filter between the buffer and the retrain module as shown in Figure 2.\nAs mentioned in Section 2.2, the attack works by selecting a set of points in the feature space that maximizes the loss function, and then flipping their labels. An additional constrain for the attacker is that these points should be well hidden within the rest of the valid points.\nFigure 3a shows the clusters in the feature space after the poison points have been injected. It can be observed that there are some outliers but experiments (Section 4) shows that these are not the poison points.\nHowever, we can make use of the label flipping to distinguish the poison points from the normal points. Because of the fact that labels of the poison points have been flipped, the poison points will be very similar to the normal points in the feature space.\nIn our approach, we extend the feature space to an additional dimension which maps the class labebls to some values. We will refer to this additional dimension as the label dimnension and the new feature space will be refered to as (feature + label) space.\nIn the (feature + label) space, the poison points will be well seperated from the rest of the cluster in feature space if the mapping of the label dimension is done properly as shown in 3b. (We will talk about how to do the mapping in the later part of this section.)\nFrom these observations, we develop the attack points identification method as described in Algorithm 1.\nThe first step in our method is to cluster the data in the feature space. In our algorithm, the clustering algorithm used is DBSCAN [11]. In our algorithm, DBSCAN is used because it can find clusters of arbitrary shape and we do not need to specify the number of clusters.\nAs mentioned earlier, we are dealing with a two class classification. Assume that the two classes are {0, 1}. It does not matter which class is 0 or 1. Let class(x) be the class label of x. The mapping in the label dimension is done such that of class(x) is mapped to ω · class(x).\nThen a point x in the (feature + label) space is given by,\nF (x) = {x1, x2, . . . , ω · class(x)}\nLet us assume that the cluster to which x belongs to is given by cluster(x). Let S represent the entire set of data points. Let S′(x) represent the set of points that belongs to the same cluster as x.\nS′(x) = {y|y ∈ S ∧ Cluster(x) = Cluster(y)}\nCompute the average squared Euclidean distance for each point in S′(x) from x. Let us call this the distance score for x and denote it by d(x).\nd(x) = 1 |S′(x)| · ∑\ny∈S′(x)\ndist(x, y)\nwhere, dist(x, y) is the squared Euclidean distance between x and y. Let D be the set of distance score for all points in the dataset.\nD = {d(y)|y ∈ S}\nAssume µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of D. Let Z(x) represent the z-score of a data point x.\nZ(x) = x− µ σ\nTransform every point in D to its z-score. Let D denote this new set.\nD = {Z(x)|∀x ∈ D}\nFilter out the points with confidence less than conf(θ),\nS∗ = {y|y ∈ S ∧D(y) ≤ θ}\nThe set S∗ is the training data from which the poisoned data has been removed, and it is the output of Curie which will be used for future retaining of the SVM classifier.\nIn the algorithm described, there are two hyperparameters - ω and θ. In Appendix A we show that,\nω2 ≥ θ 2 − 1\n(1− ρ) · icdmax\nwhere icdmax is the maximum intra-cluster distance and ρ is the expected probability that a data point will be a poison point.\nIn the next subsection, we will describe an extension of Curie to take in account multi-class classification."

      "text" : "In the previous sections, we considered only two-class classification. This is valid for authentication systems as they only need to classify users as valid or invalid. However, there are security systems in which the classifier has to handle multiple classes. In this section, we present an extension to Curie for multi-class classification.\nConsider a multi-class classifier with NC number of classes. From the perspective of the attacker, this is not different from the two-class classification.\nAlgorithm 1: Curie: Algorithm to filter the poison points\nData: Data = (F,C) such that F is a set of feature vectors and C is a set of class labels Result: M vectors after removal of attack points /* Reduce the number of dimensions */ PcaData← PCA(Data.F ) ; /* Cluster the data thorough DBSCAN */ Clusters← DBSCAN(PcaData); foreach point ∈ Data do\n/* Append the weighted class as feature */ point.F ← Append(point.F, point.C × ω); /* Calculate the average distance to 10 randomly selected points\nin the same cluster */\ncls← GetCluster(point, Clusters); sample← Sample(cls, count); foreach s ∈ sample do\ns.F ← Append(s.F, s.C × weight); d← EucledianDistance(point.F, s.F ) ; Dist.point← Dist.point+ d ;\nend Dist.point← Dist.point/Size(cls);\nend /* Perform Z-score standarization and select only points with more\nthan conf(θ) confidence */ Dist← ZScore(Dist); foreach point ∈ Data do\nif Dist.point ≤ θ then Result← Append(Result, point); end\nend\nIf the class of interest to the attacker is CA, the attack can be performed by considering the classifier as binary classifier with classes - CA and the rest.\nSince Curie is an unsupervised algorithm, it can be easily extended to apply to such cases of multi-class classification. The defender does not know the class that the attacker is targeting. So, we consider every possible one-vs-rest pairs. This means that instead of adding one label dimension in the (feature + label) space like in Section 3.2, (NC − 1) additional dimensions are added in this case. The rest of the algorithm remains the same. To differentiate this from the twoclass version, we will refer to this as MultiClass-Curie. As shown in Appendix B, the equation for ω given by 13 will apply for MultiClass-Curie as well.\nIn the next section, we will describe the dataset used for experiments, and experimental setups."

Each item of the vector has a value in the range [0, 255].\nAs described in Section 4.2, we need two datasets - one with 2 classes and one with 3 classes.\nTo create the 2 class dataset, we randomly sample 1250 points without replacement from classes 0 and 1 in the original dataset.

The third experiment is to determine the effectiveness of MultiClass-Curie.\nAs mentioned in Section 2.3, we are not aware of any method to protect SVM classifiers against the attacks proposed in [6,18].

We then compare the change in the classifier performance. We are not aware of any other works on preventing poisoning attacks in multi-class SVM classifier.

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "The use of machine learning for security applications is becoming very widespread. So, an investigation of the behavior of machine learning algorithms in an adversarial environment is important. Poisoning attacks present a very real threat to security systems (Section 2) that employ machine learning techniques. Researches [6,18] have shown that SVM, a very widely used machine learning algorithm, is very susceptible to poisoning attacks.\nIn this paper, we examined the poisoning attack against SVM, and propose a method, which we refer to as Curie, to protect a system that uses SVM classifier from such attacks. Curie works as a filter before the buffered data are used to retrain the SVM classifier.\nCurie works by exploiting the fact that the poison data looks like a normal point in the feature space, but has their labels flipped. The data are clustered in the feature space, and the average distance of each point from the other points in the same cluster is calculated with the class label considered as a feature with proper weight. The data points with confidence less than 95% confidence are removed from the training data.\nWe tested our algorithm on the MNSIT dataset (Section 4.1), and evaluated with the case in which the training data is used directly for retraining. The results obtained (Section 5) show that when Curie is used, the accuracy and false\npositive rate of the classifier does not change significantly when the amount of poison points in the training data is changed. This indicates that Curie successfully filtered out most of the poison data. We also showed that Curie is not very sensitive to ω. So the estimation of ρ for an unknown dataset need not be very accurate. We also demonstrated experimentally that we can extend Curie to make it work in a multi-class classification system.\nIn addition to the performance benifits, Curie can be easily integrated into any system that uses periodic retraining (Figure 2).\nSince Curie is an unsupervised method, an attacker would have to use evasion attacks to pass through Curie. This means that the attacker would have to inject data that works both for evasion attack and poison attack. (The injected data point has to pass thorough Curie undetected, and then poison the classifier.) We are not aware of any works on attacks that does both both evasion and poisoning simultaneously. An interesting research area would be to explore if this is possible.\nAlthough we tested Curie with only SVM classifier, it should be possible to extend the work to protect other classifiers, such as perceptron, against poisoning attack. Like in the case of SVM, perceptron also works by creating a decision boundary. So the poisoning attack against perceptron would also work through some form of label flipping. As we demonstrated in Section 3.2, label flipping creates poison points that are similar to normal points in feature space but different in the (feature + label) space. This is what Curie exploits to filter out the poison points."

So, the average intra-cluster distance of cluster C can be approximated by,\nicd(C) ≈ 1 (n− 1) ∑ x∈Sc−p l∑ i=1 (xi − pi)2 (10)\nThen Equation 9 can be written as,\nω2c ≥ θ − 1\n(1− ρ) · icd(C) (11)\nIf there are m clusters, let us use C to represent the set of all clusters. Then from Equation 3,\nω ≥ max({ωi|i ∈ C}) (12)\nThe value θ and ρ is defined over the entire dataset. Let us use icdmax to denote the maximum value of intra cluster distance over all the clusters in C.\nicdmax = max({icd(i)|i ∈ C})\nThen the overall value of ω for the entire dataset is,\nω2 ≥ θ − 1 (1− ρ) · icdmax (13)"

So, the difference xj − pj will be 0 in all cases except the one that corresponds to CA vs the rest. That is,\nNC−1∑ j=0 (xj − pj)2 = (xm − pm)2\nSo, Equation 14 can be written as,\ndistf+l(p) = 1 n− 1 ∑\nx∈Sc−p\n( (xm − pm)2 +\nl∑ i=1\n(xi − pi)2 )\n(15)\nEquation 15 is identical to 5 and the number of classes does not come up anywhere else in the proof in Appendix A.

In the context of the biometric authentication, this means that more intruders will be classified as valid user, and in case of speaker identification system, user A will be classified user B. In this paper, we examine poisoning attack against SVM and introduce Curie a method to protect the SVM classifier from the poisoning attack. The basic idea of our method is to identify the poisoned data points injected by the adversary and filter them out. Our method is light weight and can be easily integrated into existing systems. Experimental results show that it works very well in filtering out the poisoned data.",
