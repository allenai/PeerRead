It employs the dual relation and the bilateral information between the samples and features. In many realworld applications, data usually reside on a submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space, but it is nontrivial to estimate the intrinsic manifold of the data space in a principled way. In this study, we focus on improving the co-clustering performance via manifold ensemble learning, which is able to maximally approximate the intrinsic manifolds of both the sample and feature spaces. To achieve this, we develop a novel co-clustering algorithm called Relational Multi-manifold Co-clustering (RMC) based on symmetric nonnegative matrix tri-factorization, which decomposes the relational data matrix into three submatrices. This method considers the intertype relationship revealed by the relational data matrix, and also the intra-type information reflected by the affinity matrices encoded on the sample and feature data distributions. Specifically, we assume the intrinsic manifold of the sample or feature space lies in a convex hull of some pre-defined candidate manifolds. We want to learn a convex combination of them to maximally approach the desired intrinsic manifold. To optimize the objective function, the multiplicative rules are utilized to update the submatrices alternatively. Besides, both the entropic mirror descent algorithm and the coordinate descent algorithm are exploited to learn the manifold coefficient vector.

INTRODUCTION\nTHE last dozen years have witnessed the profoundchanges in human lifestyle with the rapid development of modern digital technologies. A huge amount of multitype relational data emerge every moment in a broad range of real-world applications [12], [29], e.g., numerous documents in online offices, various images or videos in the social networks, and gene expression data for medical diagnosis. Clustering has established itself as a very useful tool to handle a vast number of data with successful applications in knowledge management, information retrieval and bioinformatics, etc. As an unsupervised learning mechanism, clustering seeks the appropriate partitioning\nManuscript received August 7, 2012; revised November 25, 2012; accepted December 10, 2012.\nP.

In general, traditional clustering belongs to the unilateral learning, namely it only emphasizes clustering along the sample or feature dimension. Recent works have shown that clustering samples and features simultaneously, i.e., co-clustering, is beneficial to further improving the clustering performance, in the sense that co-clustering fully makes use of the dual interdependence between samples and features to discover certain hidden clustering structures in data [17], [18], [34].\nActually, a great many of important applications require to co-cluster both the samples and features, which are often stacked in columns and rows of a dyadic data matrix, such as co-occurrence matrix, rating matrix and proximity matrix [30]. For instance, in the text and webpage analysis, the relations between words and documents can be reflected by a contingency table [16], [31]. In a recommendation system, users and ratings on items (e.g., movies, music) can be coclustered via collaborative filtering [11]. In the biological domain (e.g., cancer diagnosis, mircoarray analysis), we can cluster the genes and experimental conditions simultaneously [24]. To this end, many co-clustering algorithms have emerged, such as graph partitioning based model [17], [33], [42], pattern based model [41], information theory based model [18], [35], and matrix factorization based model [14], [19], [40].\nIn this work, we focus on matrix factorization based co-clustering, which models the sample-feature relationship from the data reconstruction perspective. A heuristic method is to use singular value decomposition (SVD), whose low rank singular vectors constitute a compact representation. However, its factorized matrices contain negative values, which lacks a nice interpretation for co-clustering on documents or facial images. Therefore, we take advantage of a popularized tool, namely nonnegative matrix tri-factorization [19], as the foundation of our approach. This method imposes the nonnegative constraints on the decomposed matrices, which leads to a parts-based representation [26]. On the other hand, previous studies have shown human generated data (e.g., documents) are usually drawn from a probability distribution that has support on or near to a submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space [6], [7], [9], and manifold learning has favorable applications in wide areas [3]. As a result, some researchers strive to consider manifold geometrical structure in co-clustering by dual graph regularization [23], [38], [43]. However, it is a nontrivial and challenging task to seek the intrinsic manifolds of different types of data objects (e.g., samples and features) for graph based co-clustering. To address this issue, inspired from the work in [21], we propose\nto approximate the optimal manifold by using a convex combination of some pre-given candidate manifolds, thus developing a novel method called Relational Multimanifold Co-clustering (RMC) to improve the clustering performance via manifold ensemble learning.\nOur approach employs the symmetric nonnegative matrix tri-factorization to decompose the relational data matrix into three matrices for co-clustering. We consider the inter-type relation through the relational data matrix and the intra-type information through the affinity matrices constructed on both the sample and feature spaces [38], [39]. In manifold ensemble learning, we assume that the intrinsic manifold of the sample or feature space lies in a convex hull of a group of pre-defined candidate manifolds [21]. It is strongly desirable to approximate the intrinsic manifolds of both the sample and feature spaces as much as possible, i.e., to learn an appropriate convex combination of a set of available manifolds. To optimize the objective function, the multiplicative update rules are adopted for the factorized matrices in an alternating manner. In this work, we exploit the entropic mirror descent algorithm and the coordinate descent algorithm to automatically learn the appropriate convex combination of candidate manifolds. To explore the performance of our method, we conducted extensive experiments on documents (e.g., webpages), images (e.g., handwritten digits and faces) and gene expression data. Experimental results suggest the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we briefly review the related works. Section III introduces our approach as well as two manifold coefficients optimization algorithms. Experimental results on several data sets from different domains are reported in Section IV involving parameter selection and results analysis. Finally, we provide some concluding remarks in Section V."

      "heading" : "II. RELATED WORKS",
      "text" : "In this section, we primarily review some related works to our co-clustering method. In the last decade, coclustering has become a hotspot topic and received lots of attention from the multidisciplinary communities because of its promising applications to many practical problems, e.g., collaborative filtering [11], [22], microarray data analysis [15], [24].\nFrom the viewpoint of graph partitioning, two bipartite spectral graph partition methods were proposed in [17], [42] to co-cluster documents and words by finding minimum cut vertex partitions in a bipartite graph. More recently, authors in [33] put forward the isoperimetric co-clustering algorithm to partition the document-word bipartite graph, which minimizes the ratio of the perimeter of the bipartite graph partition and the partition area under a welldefined graph-theoretic area. For the information theory based co-clustering, samples and features are regarded as the instances of two random variables [43], e.g., an information bottleneck method was implemented in [35]\nto cluster documents by using word clusters. Besides, an information-theoretic co-clustering algorithm specially designed for contingency table was introduced in [18] and a more general co-clustering framework based on Bregman divergence was given in [1].\nMatrix factorization based co-clustering techniques have been widely studied. At the very beginning, nonnegative matrix factorization was proposed to learn a partsbased representation, and it approximates the original data matrix by the product of two decomposed nonnegative matrices [26], [44]. NMF has the intuitive interpretation for its results, but it focuses on the unilateral clustering and neglects the duality between rows and columns of a matrix. Motivated by this, the block value decomposition (BVD) was presented for co-clustering dyadic data [30]. It factorizes the data matrix into three components, i.e., the row and column coefficient matrices and the block value matrix. As an extension of NMF, orthogonal nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (ONMTF) was studied in [19], which emphasizes the role of bi-orthogonality in three-factor NMF. Thanks to the successful applications of manifold learning in recent years [3], [8], [10], some researchers consider the local geometrical structure in matrix factorization based co-clustering. For example, a dual regularized co-clustering (DRCC) method based on semi-nonnegative matrix tri-factorization was proposed in [23], which explores the geometrical structure of both data manifold and feature manifold. To reduce the computational complexity of DRCC, a fast nonnegative matrix trifactorization approach was shown in [40], which constrains two factorized nonnegative matrices to be cluster indicator matrices. Moreover, a symmetric nonnegative matrix trifactorization (SNMTF) framework was developed to cluster multi-type relational data [38], which incorporates the intratype information through manifold regularization. Based on this work, the authors further presented a fast nonnegative matrix tri-factorization approach to deal with large-scale data [39].\nHowever, these graph regularized methods have a common shortcoming that the manifold used for co-clustering might not be the true intrinsic manifold, and it will even deviates far from the desired in an adverse situation. It is a nontrivial task to seek the intrinsic manifold in reality. To alleviate this difficulty, in light of [21], we assume the intrinsic manifold of the sample or feature distribution lies in a convex hull of some candidate manifolds, and hope to maximally approximate the true intrinsic manifold using the convex combination of them. This way, the local geometrical structure can be better preserved in both the sample and feature spaces for co-clustering."

      "heading" : "A. Problem Formulation",
      "text" : "The general problem setting is to co-cluster multitype relational data. Given a K-type relational data set X = {X1,X2, ...,XK}, where each Xk represents the data objects of the k-th type, we define an inter-type relational matrix R with the sub-matrix Rij ∈ Rni×nj , i 6= j, which reflects the inter-type relationship between the i-th type and the j-th type data objects. To model the intra-type structure information for each data type, we define an intra-type relational matrix W consisting of a set of affinity matrices Wk ∈ R\nnk×nk encoded on the data, which indicates the intra-type relation of components within the k-th type data. Both of the inter-type and intra-type relationship among the different data objects are to be fully used for co-clustering.\nHowever, two-type relational data are omnipresent and frequently used in many real-world applications, e.g., simultaneously clustering documents and words, collaborative filtering in a recommendation system, gene expression data analysis under different experimental conditions. Hence, in this study we focus on the case K = 2, i.e., we employ both the sample type and the feature type data objects for co-clustering. The concerned matrices can be respectively formulated as\nR =\n[\n0 n1×n1 Rn1×n212 Rn2×n121 0 n2×n2\n]\n,\nW =\n[\nW n1×n11 0 n1×n2\n0 n2×n1 W n2×n22\n]\n,\nwhere 0 is a matrix with all zero entries of different sizes, the superscripts denote the matrix sizes. Here, R12 and R21 represent the feature and sample matrix respectively, they satisfy the condition R12 = RT21. Each column of R21 or R12 denotes a feature or sample vector."

      "text" : "Symmetric nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (SNMTF) employs both the inter-type relationship and the intra-type information of multi-type relational data [38]. Similar to the previous works, i.e., Long’s BVD [30], Ding’s ONMTF [19] and Gu’s DRCC [23], SNMTF shares an important property that they all decompose the data matrix into three low-rank matrices, i.e., (K = 2)\nR12 ≈ G1S12G T 2 , (1)\nwhere G1 ∈ Rn1×c1 and G2 ∈ Rn2×c2 are the cluster indicator matrices for X1 and X2, respectively, c1 ≪ n1, c2 ≪ n2. The middle matrix S12 ∈ Rc1×c2 can be treated as a compact representation of R12 [30], which absorbs the different scales of other matrices [19].\nNote that BVD and ONMTF impose nonnegative constraints on all three matrices G1, G2, S, while DRCC and SNMTF both relax the nonnegative constraint on the matrix S, thereby allowing negative entries. Different\nfrom BVD, ONMTF emphasizes the bi-orthogonality on G1, G2. Compared to ONMTF, both DRCC and SNMTF consider the local geometrical structure by incorporating the Laplacian regularization into the objective. Based on DRCC, SNMTF employs the symmetric matrix by virtue of the idea in [29], [37] to simultaneously cluster multi-type relational data, and its objective can be shown by\nmin G,S\n‖R−GSGT ‖2F + 2λTr(G TLG), s.t.

However, it is a nontrivial task to discover an appropriate intrinsic manifold in reality. Therefore, automatic and data-driven manifold approximation is said to be invaluable for manifold regularization based co-clustering. In this work, we adopt a novel learning paradigm named manifold ensemble learning to maximally approximate the true intrinsic manifold. This idea is inspired from the work in [21], which combines the automatic intrinsic manifold approximation and semi-supervised classification.\nOur assumption is that a series of initial guesses of graph Laplacian are available and the intrinsic manifold of the sample or feature space lies in the convex hull of these pregiven candidate manifolds. In some sense, this assumption constrains the search space of possible manifolds, since the optimal graph Laplacian is an discrete approximation to the intrinsic manifold [21], i.e.,\nL =\nq ∑\ni=1\nµiL̃i, s.t.\nq ∑\ni=1\nµi = 1, µi ≥ 0, (3)\nwhere a set of candidate graph Laplacians C = {L1, . . . ,Lq} is defined and the convex hull of this set is denoted by\nconvC = { q ∑\ni\nµixi| ∑\ni\nµi = 1, xi ∈ C, xi ≥ 0}.\nHere we use L̃i of the i-th candidate manifold to discriminate it from Lk of the k-th type data.

Similar to [23], we do l2 normalization on columns of G and compensate its norm to S.

      "heading" : "E. Optimization",
      "text" : "In this section, we explore how to optimize the objective in Eq. (4). It can be readily found that the objective function is non-convex in G,S,µ jointly, but it is convex in them respectively. So it is unrealistic to find the global minimum since no closed-form solution can be obtained. We present an alternating scheme to optimize the objective as most of the previous works do [6], [23], [30], [38]. However, different from the existing schemes, it is more challenging to optimize our objective since it has a critical manifold coefficient vector to be solved. Details are shown below.\n1) Computation of S: When fixing G and µ, the objective becomes minimizing JS = ‖R − GSGT ‖2F . Taking its derivative to S, i.e.,\n∂JS ∂S = −2GTRG + 2GTGSGTG,\nand setting it to 0, then we have the update rule\nS = (GTG)−1GTRG(GTG)−1. (5)\n2) Computation of G: When fixing S and µ, the objective with respect to G reduces to minimizing\nJG = ‖R−GSG T ‖2F + αTr(G TLG), s.t. G 0.\nTo solve this constrained optimization problem, we introduce the Lagrangian multiplier matrix Λ and its Lagrangian function is formulated as\nL(G) = ‖R−GSGT‖2F +αTr(G TLG)+Tr(ΛGT ). (6)\nRequiring its derivative to G be 0, we obtain\nΛ = 4αLG− 4A+ 4GB,\nwhere A = RGST , B = STGTGS. Since the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) complementary condition [4] for the nonnegativity of Gij gives ΛijGij = 0, we have\n(αLG−A+GB)ijGij = 0. (7)\nSimilar to [20], we define L = L+−L−, A = A+−A−, B = B+ −B−, where\nL+ij = (|Lij |+Lij)\n2 , L−ij =\n(|Lij | −Lij)\n2 .\nWe substitute the decomposed positive and negative parts into Eq. (7), which leads to the update rule\nGij ← Gij\n[\n(αL−G+A+ +GB−)ij (αL+G+A− +GB+)ij\n] 1 2\n. (8)\n3) Computation of µ: When fixing G and S, the objective is simplified to\nmin µ f(µ) =\nq ∑\ni=1\nµisi + β‖µ‖ 2 2,\ns.t.\nq ∑\ni=1\nµi = 1,µ 0,\n(9)\nwhere si = Tr(GT L̃iG). It is easy to see that if β = 0, then the trivial solution will be\nµi =\n{\n1, if si = mink=1,...,n sk, 0, otherwise.\nThis is extremely sparse and undesirable to learn a composite manifold. On the other hand, if β → ∞, all the candidate manifolds will receive identical weights, which is also unexpected. Therefore, it is essential to assign a reasonable value for the parameter β.\nTo optimize this problem, there are generally three possible ways. First, it can be solved by the generic Quadratic Programming (QP) method (e.g, CVX) [4], but this solver is often time-consuming for larger size problem and shows slow convergence. Second, it is actually an exactly well-defined problem, i.e., the convex minimization over the unit simplex, which can be elegantly solved by the Entropic Mirror Descent Algorithm (EMDA) with a global efficiency estimate proven to be mildly dependent on the problem size [2], as shown in Algorithm 1. Third, we can adopt the Coordinate Descent Algorithm (CDA) just like using sequential minimal optimization for support vector machines [32], which selects two variables to update in each iteration while keeping the others fixed, as shown in Algorithm 2. In this work, we put emphasis on EMDA and CDA, which are employed to learn appropriate manifold coefficients. The brief descriptions about them are given below.\nEntropic Mirror Descent Algorithm.

In consequence,\n6http://www.gems-system.org/datasets/\nwe follow [23] and use the similar update rule for the matrix G in SNMTF and OSNTF, so that the nonnegativity can be well guaranteed and the objective strictly reduces. For both SNMTF and OSNTF, the cluster membership of each sample is determined by the corresponding row vector of the cluster indicator matrix G. For the remaining methods except KM, we perform clustering using k-means in the derived low-dimensional data space. In the experiments, we ran k-means 20 times with different randomly generated starting points and the result in terms of the minimized objective function was recorded. For all the evaluated approaches, we repeat the clustering twenty times and the average results over 20 test runs are reported."

      "heading" : "C. Evaluation Criteria",
      "text" : "We adopt two popular criteria to measure the clustering performance [5], [23], i.e., the accuracy (AC) and the normalized mutual information (NMI).\nAC denotes the percentage of correct labels estimated by the clustering algorithm. Given a data point xi, let ai and gi be the estimated and true label respectively, then we have\nAC =\n∑n i=1 δ(gi,map(ai))\nn , (10)\nwhere n is the total number of samples, δ(·, ·) is an indicator function that equals one if the two entries are the same and equals zero otherwise. The permutation mapping function map(ai) maps each cluster label ai to the equivalent label of the data set.\nNMI evaluates how closely the clustering algorithm is able to reconstruct the underlying label distribution in the data corpus. Let C and C′ be the cluster sets from the ground truth and the clustering method respectively, then\nNMI between them is defined as\nNMI(C,C′) =\n∑\nci∈C,c ′ j ∈C′ p(ci, c\n′ j) · log2 p(ci,c\n′ j)\np(ci)·p(c′j)\nmax(H(C), H(C′)) ,\n(11) where the probabilities p(ci), p(c′j) indicate to what extent a sample belongs to the clusters ci and c′j respectively. p(ci, c ′\nj) is the joint probability that the selected sample belongs to ci and c′j simultaneously. H(C) and H(C\n′) are the entropies of C and C′. NMI(C,C′) takes values between zero and one. The larger the NMI value is, the better clustering performance the algorithm will achieve."

      "heading" : "D. Parameter Settings",
      "text" : "There are several parameters to be tuned in the evaluated algorithms. To ensure the fairness, we run them under different parameter settings, and report the best results.\nFor all methods except KM, the number of sample or feature clusters is set to the actual number of classes in all the collected data sets. Note that there is no parameter selection for KM, NMF and ONMTF, once the number of clusters is given. For the graphbased methods GNMF, DRCC, SNMTF, OSNTF and RMC, the number of the nearest neighbor is fixed to a small number 5 to ensure the locality preserving property. The regularization parameters are all searched from the grid {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 500, 1500}. As for the coclustering methods, the regularization parameters for the sample graph and the feature graph are set to the same. Except RMC, the other graph-based methods construct the graph Laplacian matrix using the binary weighting scheme as suggested in [6], [23].\nFor our RMC approach, the ensemble dual regularization parameter α is in proportion to the over-fitting tolerance parameter β, which is empirically set to β = 0.1α [21]. To generate a group of diverse manifolds, we utilized three kinds of weighting schemes to construct the sample and\nfeature graphs, i.e., the binary weighting, the Gaussian kernel, and the cosine similarity. In particular, for the Gaussian kernel, we varied the bandwidth t in a broad range of area, i.e., t = { τ100 , τ 60 , τ 30 , τ 10 , τ, 10τ, 30τ, 60τ, 100τ}. Here, τ is empirically set as the inverse of the mean square of Euclidean distances between all sample or feature pairs in the selected data [21], i.e., τ = (\n1 n2\n∑n i,j=1 ‖xi−xj‖ 2 )−1\n. In total, eleven manifolds containing nine Gaussian graphs, one binary graph and one cosine similarity graph were employed in manifold ensemble learning for the sample and feature spaces."

      "heading" : "E. Results",
      "text" : "The averaged results of different algorithms are tabulated in Table III and IV in terms of AC and NMI, respectively. The best results on each data set are highlighted in boldface. Besides, the asterisk symbol ”*” aside our results indicates\nRMC is statistically and significantly better than the other well-established methods at a significance level of 0.01.\nFrom these experiments, several interesting points can be revealed below.\n• The clustering performances of RMC are systematically and consistently better than the compared algorithms, which verifies that the manifold ensemble learning is advantageous to the graph-based symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization methods for coclustering. • Except the gene expression data, RMC-E generally outperforms RMC-C on the remaining data sets. We attribute this to the fact that they respectively employ two different optimization methods to learn the manifold coefficients. Specifically, EMDA has a global efficiency estimate mildly dependent on the number of manifolds for the convex optimization over the unit simplex, and is provably very efficient for large scale\nproblems [2]. On the contrary, in each iteration of CDA, only two variables are selected to update while the others are fixed, which is a pairwise alternating optimization, leading to sub-optimal solutions. • Generally, both RMC-E and RMC-C perform more or less on the gene expression data, which might be due to the reason that their sample sizes are much smaller than those of text and image data sets, i.e., small sample size (SSS) problem. Thus, both EMDA and CDA are very likely to converge at a value around the optimal solution of the convex optimization problem, thereby achieving similar co-clustering results. • The graph regularization based methods, e.g., GNMF, DRCC, SNMTF, OSNTF and RMC, almost perform better than KM, NMF and OSNMTF. This is mainly for the reason that the graph-based approaches have considered the local geometrical structure, which is\nconducive to preserve the locality property in the lowdimensional data space. • The dual regularization based methods, e.g., DRCC and RMC, generally outperform the one-side graph regularization based method GNMF. This demonstrates that the geometric structures in both the sample and feature spaces are beneficial to further improve the clustering performance."

      "heading" : "F. Parameter Selection",
      "text" : "There are three important parameters in our RMC method, i.e., the manifold regularization parameter α, the over-fitting tolerance parameter β and the number of nearest neighbor p. Since the number of nearest neighbor has been fixed to 5 for all the graph-based approaches and no bias will occur during the comparison, it makes sense that here we neglect the model selection on the param-\neter p. As mentioned earlier in parameter settings, the over-fitting tolerance parameter β was empirically set as β = 0.1α [21] to reduce the degree of the parameter freedom in the objective function of RMC. Hence, it is only desirable to explore the influence of the parameter α on the clustering performance of our method. To do this, we varied the parameter α in a broad real value range, i.e., {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 500, 1500}.\nFigure 1 and 2 respectively show the plots of accuracy and normalized mutual information versus the parameter α for RMC using EMDA. Similar tendencies can be also observed for RMC using CDA. As vividly depicted in these figures, we can see that our approach enjoys the satisfactory performance when the parameter α takes a higher value, e.g., around 500 or 1000. This indicates that the ensemble manifold regularization term should be imposed larger weights, such that it can make much more positive contributions to the objective function of the proposed approach."

      "heading" : "G. Study on Manifold Coefficients",
      "text" : "Since manifold ensemble learning plays an essential role in the proposed RMC method, it is worthwhile to examine the manifold coefficients learned by two different optimization algorithms, i.e., EMDA and CDA. We use the histogram to draw the distribution of manifold coefficients derived from RMC under the best parameter settings. Figure 3 and 4 respectively illustrate the histogram of manifold coefficients for RMC-E and RMC-C on all data sets.\nFrom these bars, it is easy to find that CDA only choose two or three manifolds on most data sets, which suggests that there might be some important information loss, resulting that the improvement of the clustering performance seems not inspiring as shown in Table III and IV. In contrast, EMDA assigns each manifold a nonzero coefficient or weight, and the convex combination of all the candidate manifolds jointly contributes to approximate the true intrinsic manifolds of the sample and feature spaces as much as possible, thus achieving greater performance improvements. Comparing the corresponding figures in RMC-E and RMCC, we discover that the manifolds selected by RMC-C are the manifolds with the top two or three weights in RMC-E, which indicates that the two optimization methods almost select the similar manifolds as their main components. However, when it comes to RMC-C, in each iteration only two elements are selected for updating when fixing others, thereby resulting that some important manifolds like binary graph and cosine similarity graph are neglected by RMCC during the optimization process. Different from RMC-C, RMC-E updates each element in a global view and has a global efficiency estimate for the convex minimization problem on the standard simplex."

      "heading" : "V. CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "This paper presents a novel co-clustering approach named Relational Multi-manifold Co-clustering (RMC),\nwhich is based on the symmetric nonnegative matrix trifactorization.\nOur approach takes into account the inter-type relation and the intra-type information of both the sample and feature data simultaneously. The basic idea is to make use of manifold ensemble learning to enhance the performance of co-clustering. To achieve this, we attempt to learn a sensible convex combination of candidate manifolds so that it can maximally approximate the true intrinsic manifolds of both the sample and feature spaces. In order to optimize the objective function, we adopt the popular alternating optimization method to update the factorized matrices. However, different from the existing matrix factorization based co-clustering methods, there exists a manifold coefficient vector to be optimized in our approach, which poses a challenging task. In this work, we utilize two optimization methods with totally different mechanisms to optimize this coefficient vector, i.e., the entropic mirror descent algorithm and the coordinate descent algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a number of interesting experiments on data collections from diverse domains, i.e., text processing, image analysis and bioinformatics."
