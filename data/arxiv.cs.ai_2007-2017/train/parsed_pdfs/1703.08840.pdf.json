      "text" : "A key limitation of reinforcement learning (RL) is that it involves the optimization of a predefined reward function or reinforcement signal (Levine & Koltun, 2013; Schulman et al., 2015a; Lillicrap et al., 2015; Schulman et al., 2015b; Silver et al., 2016; Tamar et al., 2016). Defining a reward function is straightforward in some cases, e.g., in games such as Go or chess. However, designing an appropriate reward function can be difficult in more complex and less well-specified environments, e.g., for autonomous driving where there is a need to balance safety and efficiency.\nImitation learning methods have the potential to close this gap by learning how to perform tasks directly from expert demonstrations, and has succeeded in a wide range of\n1Peking University, Beijing, China 2Stanford University, California, USA.

Among them, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL, Ho & Ermon (2016)) is a modelfree imitation learning method that is highly effective and scales to relatively high dimensional models. The training process of GAIL can be thought of as building a generative model, a stochastic policy that reacts to a fixed simulation environment, to produce behavior that matches the expert demonstrations. To determine a reasonable distance metric, a discriminator is jointly trained to distinguish expert trajectories from ones produced by the policy.\nIn imitation learning, example demonstrations are typically provided by human experts. These demonstrations can show significant variability. For example, they might be collected from multiple experts, each employing a different policy. External latent factors of variation that are not explicitly captured by the simulation environment can also significantly affect the observed behavior. For example, expert driving demonstrations might be collected from users with different skills and habits. The goal of this paper is to develop an imitation learning framework that is able to automatically discover and disentangle the latent factors of variation underlying human decision-making. Analogous to the goal of uncovering style, shape, and color in generative modeling of images (Chen et al., 2016), we aim to automatically learn concepts such as driver aggressiveness from human demonstrations.\nWe propose a new method for learning a latent variable generative model of trajectories in a dynamic environment that not only accurately reproduce expert behavior, but also learns a latent space that is semantically meaningful. Our approach is an extension of GAIL, where the objective is augmented with a mutual information term between the latent variables and the observed state-action pairs. We demonstrate an application in autonomous driving, where we learn to imitate complex driving behaviors while learning semantically meaningful structure, without any supervision beyond the expert trajectories. Remarkably, our method performs directly on raw visual inputs, using raw pixels as the only source of perceptual information.\nIn particular, the contributions of this paper are threefold:\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n08 84\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n6 M\nar 2\n01 7\n1. We introduce a component which maximizes the mutual information between latent structure and trajectories, similar to InfoGAN (Chen et al., 2016) , resulting in a policy where low-level actions can be controlled through high-level latent variables.\n2. We extend GAIL to use raw pixels as input and produce human-like behaviors in complex highdimensional environments.\n3. We demonstrate an application to autonomous highway driving using the TORCS driving simulator (Wymann et al., 2000). We first demonstrate that the learned policy is able to navigate traffic without collisions. Then, we show that by specifying high-level latent variables, our model learns to reproduce different styles of human-like driving behavior."

Typically, there are two approaches to imitation learning: 1) behavior cloning (BC), which learns a policy through supervised learning over the state-action pairs from the expert trajectories; and 2) apprenticeship learning (AL), which assumes the expert policy is optimal under some unknown reward and learns a policy by recovering the reward and solving the corresponding planning problem. BC tends to have poor generalization properties due to compounding errors and covariate shift (Ross & Bagnell, 2010; Ross et al., 2011). AL, on the other hand, has the advantage of learning a reward function that can be used to score entire trajectories (Abbeel & Ng, 2004; Syed et al., 2008; Ho et al., 2016), but is typically expensive to run because it requires solving a reinforcement learning (RL) problem inside a learning loop."

      "heading" : "2.3. Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning",
      "text" : "Recent work on AL has adopted a different approach by learning a policy without learning the reward function. In particular, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL, Ho & Ermon (2016) ) is a recent AL method inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN, Goodfellow et al. (2014)). In the GAIL framework, the agent imitates the behavior of an expert policy πE by matching the generated state-action distribution with the expert distribution, where the optimum is achieved when these two distributions match perfectly. However, measuring the similarity between high-dimensional distributions is complicated, so GAIL introduces a neural network to approximately minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Intuitively, the neural network is a discriminator that tries to differentiate the two distributions. The formal GAIL objective is denoted as minθ maxω V (θ, ω), where V (θ, ω) is\nEπθ [logDω(s, a)] + EπE [log(1−Dω(s, a))]− λH(πθ) (1)\nand πθ (usually a neural network parameterized by θ) is the policy that we wish to imitate πE with, Dω is a discriminator network which tries to distinguish state-action pairs from the trajectories of πθ and πE , Eπ[f(s, a)] denotes the expectation of f over the state-action pairs generated by π, and H(πθ) , Eπθ [− log πθ(a|s)] is the γ-discounted causal entropy of the policy πθ (Bloem & Bambos, 2014). We assume that our policies are Gaussian distributions with fixed standard deviations, thusH(πθ) is constant in our settings.\nInstead of directly learning a reward function, GAIL relies on the discriminator to guide πθ into imitating the expert policy. Optimization over the GAIL objective is performed by alternating between an Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) gradient step on ω to increase V (θ, ω) with respect toD, and a Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO, Schulman et al. (2015a)) step on θ to decrease V (θ, ω) with respect to π. GAIL is model-free: it requires a simulator to provide rollouts, but it does not need to construct a model for the environment."

      "text" : "Expert demonstrations are typically collected from human experts. The resulting trajectories can show significant variability among different individuals due to internal latent factors of variation, such as social values, character, or mood. In this section, we propose an approach that 1) can discover and disentangle salient latent factors underlying human decision-making without supervision, 2) learns policies that produce trajectories which correspond to these latent factors, and 3) uses visual inputs as the only external perceptual information.\nFormally, we assume that the expert policy is a mixture of experts, and we define the generative process of the expert trajectory τE as: s0 ∼ ρ0, c ∼ p(c), π ∼ p(π|c), at ∼ π(at|st), st+1 ∼ P (st+1|at, st) where c is a latent variable that selects a specific policy π from the mixture of expert policies through p(π|c), and p(c) is the prior distribution of c. Similar to the settings in GAIL, we consider the apprenticeship learning problem as a dual of an occupancy measure matching problem, and treat the trajectory τ as a set of state-action pairs. The objective is to recover π(a|s, c) from the state-action pairs given the prior p(c)."

      "text" : "We model our parametrized policy as πθ(a|s, c). To draw a connection between latent codes c and the behavior of πθ, we utilize the information-theoretic regularization that there should be high mutual information between c and the state-action pairs in the generated trajectory. This concept is introduced by InfoGAN (Chen et al., 2016), where latent codes are utilized to discover the salient structured semantic features of the data distribution and guide the generating process. In particular, the regularization seeks to maximize the mutual information between latent codes and state-action pairs, denoted as I(c; s, a), which is hard to maximize directly as it requires access to the posterior. Hence we introduce a variational lower bound, LI(πθ, Q), of the mutual information I(c; s, a)1:\nLI(πθ, Q) = Ec∼p(c),a∼πθ(·|s,c)[logQ(c|s, a)] +H(c) ≤ I(c; s, a) (2)\nwhere Q(c|s, a) is an approximation of P (c|s, a) parameterized with weights ψ. The objective under this regularization, which we call Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (InfoGAIL), then becomes:\nmin θ,ψ max ω V (θ, ω)− λ1LI(πθ, Qψ) (3)\nwhere λ1 > 0 is the hyperparameter for information maximization regularization.\nBy introducing the latent code, InfoGAIL is able to identify the salient factors in the expert trajectories through mutual information maximization, and imitate the corresponding expert policy through generative adversarial training. This allows us to disentangle trajectories that may arise from a mixture of experts, such as different individuals performing the same task. We note that LI(πθ, Qψ) can be optimized through stochastic gradient methods, with πθ updated by TRPO, and Qψ updated by Adam.\n1Chen et al. (2016) presents a proof for the lower bound."

      "heading" : "3.2. Utilizing Raw Visual Inputs via Transfer Learning",
      "text" : "In many real world applications, the state s is related to visual inputs, such as an image or a sequence of images; indeed, visual data is often inexpensive to obtain, highly informative, and heavily relied upon by people when performing tasks. Although our approach is general, we will focus on scenarios where the states s are represented by images. Despite recent successes in visual perception, this is a very challenging scenario as raw visual inputs are typically very high-dimensional. As a result, learning a policy mapping high-dimensional raw visual inputs to actions is particularly difficult. Intuitively, the policy will have to simultaneously learn how to identify meaningful visual features, and how to leverage them to achieve desired behavior.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to dramatic improvements across many computer vision tasks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Unfortunately, they require very large amounts of training data; therefore, using the trajectories to directly train the policy and image recognition will be expensive. Hence, methods to mitigate the high sample complexity problem are crucial to the success of InfoGAIL on raw visual inputs.\nHere, we take a transfer learning approach. Features extracted using a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet contain highlevel information about the input images, which can be adapted to new vision tasks via transfer learning (Yosinski et al., 2014). However, it is not yet clear whether these relatively high-level features can be directly applied to tasks where perception and action are tightly interconnected.\nWe show that it is indeed possible. We perform transfer learning by exploiting features from a pre-trained neural network that effectively convert raw images into relatively high-level information (Sharif Razavian et al., 2014). In particular, we use a Deep Residual Network (He et al., 2016) pre-trained on the ImageNet classification task (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to obtain the visual features used as inputs for the policy network."

In order to effectively learn a policy that relies solely on visual input, we make the following improvements over the original GAIL framework."

      "heading" : "4.1. Reward Augmentation",
      "text" : "In complex and less well-specified environments, imitation learning methods have the potential to perform better than reinforcement learning methods since they do not require manual specification of an appropriate reward function. Assuming the expert is following an optimal policy under some unknown reward, and that the expert is optimal, the reward function learned from the expert trajectories should match the desired reinforcement signal. However, if the expert is performing sub-optimally, then reward functions recovered from the expert will be imperfect. Therefore, any policy trained under these learned rewards will be also suboptimal; in other words, the imitation learning agent’s potential is bounded by the capabilities of the expert.\nIn many cases, it is very difficult to fully specify a suitable reward function for a given task, yet, it is relatively straightforward to come up with constraints that we would like to enforce over the policy. For example, even if we cannot design an appropriate reward function capturing the subtleties of autonomous driving, we know that an autonomous vehicle should avoid colliding with other objects.\nThis motivates the introduction of reward augmentation, a general framework to incorporate prior knowledge in imitation learning by providing additional incentives to the agent without interfering with the imitation learning process. We achieve this by specifying a surrogate state-based reward η(πθ) = Es∼πθ [r(s)] that reflects our biases over the desired agent’s behavior:\nmin θ max ω\nV (θ, ω)− λ0η(πθ) (4)\nwhere λ0 > 0 is a hyper-parameter. This approach can be seen as a hybrid between imitation and reinforcement learning, where part of the reinforcement signal for the policy optimization is coming from the surrogate reward and part from the discriminator, i.e., from mimicking the expert. The surrogate reward can also be thought of as side information provided to the generator. For example, in our autonomous driving experiment below we show that by providing the agent with a penalty if it collides with other cars, we are able to significantly reduce the collision rate of the policy.\nComputationally, this does not interfere with discriminator training, and for the policy gradient algorithm the surrogate reward is simply an additional gradient term for the TRPO update (Schulman et al., 2015a)."

Unlike its traditional GAN counterpart, the discriminator network in WGAN solves a regression problem instead\nof a classification problem by assigning scores to its inputs, and tries to maximize the score of real data while minimizing that of generated data. We extend the use of WGAN to the generative adversarial imitation learning framework, defining a new objective W (θ, ω):\nEπθ [Dω(s, a)]− EπE [Dω(s, a)] (5)\nExtending the analysis of (Arjovsky et al., 2017), it can be shown that if D is K-Lipschitz, the objective approximately minimizes the Earth-Mover (EM) distance between the distribution of trajectories from πθ and πE . This objective function suffers less from the vanishing gradient and mode collapse problems compared to traditional GANs. This is especially important in our setting, where we want to model complex distributions over trajectories that can potentially have a large number of modes. In Arjovsky et al. (2017), the K-Lipschitz property is satisfied by clipping weights in Dω to between [−0.01, 0.01], and using momentum-free optimization methods such as RMSProp (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012)."

      "text" : "In this experiment, we consider two subsets of human driving behaviors: turn, where the agent takes a turn using either the inside lane or the outside lane; and pass, where the agent passes another vehicle from either the left or the right. In both cases, the expert policy has two significant modes. Our goal is to have InfoGAIL capture the two modes from expert demonstrations.\nWe consider using a discrete latent code, which is a one-hot encoded vector with two possible states. For both settings, there are 80 expert trajectories in total, with 100 frames in each trajectory. The performance of a learned policy is quantified with two metrics: the average distance is determined by the distance traveled by the agent before a collision (and is bounded by the length of the simulation horizon), and accuracy is defined as the classification accuracy of the expert state-action pairs according to the latent code inferred with Qψ .\nThe average distance and sampled trajectories at different stages of training are shown in Figures 3 and 4 for turn and pass respectively. During the initial stages of training, the model does not distinguish the two modes and has a high chance of colliding, due to the limitations of behavior\ncloning (which we used to initialize the policy). As training progresses, trajectories provided by the learned policy begin to diverge. Towards the end of training, the two types of trajectories are clearly distinguishable, with only a few exceptions. In turn, [0, 1] corresponds to using the inside lane, while [1, 0] corresponds to the outside lane. In pass, the two kinds of latent codes are corresponding to passing from right and left separately. Meanwhile, the average distance of the rollouts steadily increases with more training.\nIn Figure 5, we show the visual input for the policy at certain time steps, during which the agent observes itself passing a corner or surpassing another vehicle from the side determined by the latent code. This behavior is visually similar to the corresponding expert behavior.\nLearning the two modes separately requires accurate inference of the latent code. To examine the accuracy of posterior inference, we select state-action pairs from the expert trajectories and obtain the corresponding latent code through Qψ(c|s, a). See Table 1, although we did not explicitly provide labeling, our model is able to correctly distinguish over 81% of the state-action pairs in pass (and almost all the pairs in turn, which can be seen in Figure 3).\nFor comparison, we also visualize the trajectories of pass for the original GAIL objective in Figure 4, where there is no maximum mutual information regularization. GAIL learns the expert trajectories as a whole, and cannot distinguish the two modes in the expert policy.\nInterestingly, instead of learning two separate trajectories, GAIL tries to fit the left trajectory by swinging the car suddenly to the left after it has surpassed the other car from the right. We believe this reflects a limitation in the discriminators. Since Dω(s, a) only requires state-action pairs as input, the policy is only required to match most of the stateaction pairs; matching each rollout with a particular expert trajectory is not necessary. InfoGAIL with discrete latent codes can alleviate this problem by forcing the model to learn separate trajectories."

Reward augmentation is performed by adding a reward that encourages the car to drive faster to the imitation learning objective. The performance of the policy is determined by the average distance. Therefore, a longer average rollout distance indicates a better policy.\nIn our ablation experiments, we remove parts of the\nimproved optimization methods in Section 4.

      "text" : "There are two major paradigms for vision-based driving systems (Chen et al., 2015). Mediated perception is a two-step approach that first obtains scene information and then makes a driving decision (Aly, 2008; Lenz et al., 2011); behavior reflex, on the other hand, adopts a direct approach by mapping visual inputs to driving actions (Pomerleau, 1989; 1991). Many of the current autonomous\ndriving methods rely on the two-step approach, which requires hand-crafting features such as the detection of lane markings and cars (Geiger et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015). Our approach, on the other hand, attempts to learn these features through end-to-end training. While mediated perception approaches are currently more prevalent, we believe that end-to-end learning methods are more scalable and may lead to better performance in the long run.\nBojarski et al. (2016) introduce an end-to-end imitation learning framework that learns to drive entirely from visual information, and test their approach on real-world scenarios. However, their method uses behavior cloning by performing supervised learning over the state-action pairs, which is well-known to generalize poorly to more sophisticated tasks, such as changing lanes or passing vehicles. With the use of GAIL, our method can learn to perform these sophisticated operations easily.\nMost imitation learning methods for end-to-end driving rely heavily on LIDAR-like inputs to obtain precise distance measurements (Ho et al., 2016; Kuefler et al., 2017). These inputs are not usually available to humans during driving. In particular, Kuefler et al. (2017) applies GAIL to the task of modeling human driving behavior on highways. Their policy is modeled using a recurrent neural network, which is supposed to maintain sufficient statistics of the past observations. In contrast, our policy requires only raw visual information as external input, which in practice is all the information humans need in order to drive.\nSermanet et al. (2016) have also introduced a pre-trained deep neural network to achieve better performance in imitation learning with relatively few demonstrations. Specifically, they introduce a pre-trained model to learn dense, incremental reward functions that are suitable for performing downstream reinforcement learning tasks, such as realworld robotic experiments. This is different from our approach, in that transfer learning is performed over the critic instead of the policy. Since pre-trained neural networks have displayed the potential to learn more sophisticated reward functions, it would be interesting to combine that reward with our approach through reward augmentation."

      "text" : "In this paper, we present a method to imitate complex behaviors and at the same time identify salient latent factors of variation in human decision-making. Discovering these latent factors does not require direct supervision beyond expert demonstrations, and the whole process can be trained end-to-end with standard policy optimization algorithms. We also introduce several techniques to successfully perform end-to-end imitation learning using visual inputs, including transfer learning and reward augmentation. Our experimental results in the TORCS simulator clearly show that our methods can automatically distinguish certain behaviors in human driving, while learning a policy that can imitate and even outperform the expert behavior, with visual information as the sole external input. We hope\nthat our work can further inspire end-to-end learning approaches to autonomous driving under more realistic scenarios.\nAnother compelling direction for future work is to explore how current mediated perception approaches could be combined with direct imitation learning through reward augmentation. Scene information could provide us with more powerful reinforcement signals, which are crucial to training machines that are better at driving than humans."

    "abstractText" : "The goal of imitation learning is to match example expert behavior, without access to a reinforcement signal. Expert demonstrations provided by humans, however, often show significant variability due to latent factors that are not explicitly modeled. We introduce an extension to the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning method that can infer the latent structure of human decision-making in an unsupervised way. Our method can not only imitate complex behaviors, but also learn interpretable and meaningful representations. We demonstrate that the approach is applicable to high-dimensional environments including raw visual inputs. In the highway driving domain, we show that a model learned from demonstrations is able to both produce different styles of human-like driving behaviors and accurately anticipate human actions. Our method surpasses various baselines in terms of performance and functionality.",
