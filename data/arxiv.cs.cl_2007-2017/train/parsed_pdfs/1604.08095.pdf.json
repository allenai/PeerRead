      "text" : "Improving speech recognition for accented speakers is becoming increasingly more important as businesses become more international. However, handling calls with accents is still a major challenge for companies specializing in speech recognition support services. It requires an accurate and efficient accent classification algorithm, which can identify the accent of the call during a short amount of time, after which, an accent-adapted speech recognition engine can be employed to better recognize accented speech.\nAccent classification recently gains more interests, probably due to the increasing demands for better speaker recognition with accented speech. Recently, Choueiter et al. achieved 32% classification rate on 23-way classification of accented English [2], using methods such as Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) training and Gaussian tokenization. Omar et al. used Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier integrated with Universal Background Model (UBM) and claimed they outperformed the results in [2] by 75.3% relatively [14]. Another work in [12] reported classification rates of 73% and 58.9% for German vs. Spanish classification using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and naive Bayes classification respectively. In addition, classification rates of 36.2%, 17.7% and 13.2% were reported for 4-, 13- and 23-way classification using naive Bayes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the only three works, which used the same dataset as we used in this work.\nIn this paper, a baseline accent classifier is created using GMMs with purely acoustic features, such as Perceptual Linear Predictive (PLP), which were then discriminatively optimized by Heteroscedastic Linear Discriminant Analysis (HLDA). Based on the fact that most of accents are presented from the pronunciation of vowels rather than consonants, for each type of accents, various GMMs are computed using the same PLP-HLDA features for the vowels extracted from speech. Then, these GMMs are combined to form a single GMM. With the partial transcription of the database for 7 major types of accents, which is absent in [2] and [12], the vowels are extracted and with these phonetic information, the classification rate of 7-way classification is improved from 46% to 51%, compared with the baseline.\nThis work was initiated during the first author’s internship at Interactive Intelligence [4]. The algorithm and experiment was later refined for better accuracy and efficiency. The following sections are organized as follows: Sec. 2 introduces the database and features used here; the main concept of creating accent-adapted features based on vowel representation is illustrated in Sec. 3; in Sec. 4 and 5, the implementation and results for the baseline GMM-HLDA classier and the improved accent classifier with vowel extraction and representation are described in details, followed by the summary and future work in Sec. 6."

      "text" : "The database used here for developing accent classifiers is Foreign Accented English (FAE) corpus. It was originally collected by the Center of Speech & Language Understanding (CSLU) at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). It contains 4925 sentences about 20 seconds long each, from speakers with 23 types of accents.\nWe group them into 7 regional accents and one type of accents in each group was selected for developing a 7- way accent classifier, including Arabic (AR), Brazilian Portuguese (BR), French (FR), German (GE), Hindi (HI), Mandarin (MA) and Russian (RU). Tab. 1 provides a summary of these accents with the number of utterances in each type and their proportion of the entire FAE corpus. In order to perform phoneme alignment which is necessary to extract features with phonetic information, we also transcribed the\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n08 09\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.S D\n] 2\n4 Fe\nb 20\n16\nTab. 1: Summary of selected accents in FAE corpus Accents No. of Proportion Total Total Comp.

Given the audio samples si(n), n ∈ [1, N ] in the ith frame, its short-time energy rate, denoted as ei, can be formulated as\nei = 1\nN N∑ n=1 |si(n)|2, (1)\nwhere N is the number of samples in one frame. The spectral centroid can be defined as\nci = K∑ k=1 (k + 1)Si(k)/ K∑ k=1 Si(k), (2)\nwhere Si(k), k ∈ [1,K] is the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) coefficients of si. The short-time energy rate is the most useful feature to discriminate silence with environmental noise from speech, and the spectral centroids can be used to remove non-speech noise, such as coughing, due to its lower energy concentration in the spectrum, ralative to that of regular human speech. Fig. 1 demonstrates the silence removal using both measurements on file FAR00042.wav in FAE corpus with Arabic accents. The portion of speech is considered to be silence when either the smoothed short-time energy rate and the smoothed spectral centroids are below certain thresholds. Tab. 1 shows the\nComparison of 5 vowels locations in  standard and accented language\ntotal durations before and after silence removal and their corresponding compression rate.\nThe silence-removed data of the selected accents were then converted to 39-dimensional PLP features [3]. Feature Mean and Variance Normalization (MVN) were applied afterwards. They were randomly divided into training, development and testing with ratio 70 : 15 : 15."

      "text" : "Inspired by the work from Minematsu et al. [13] and Suzuki et al. [15], where they measured the overall structure of the speaker’s phonetic space, one type of accent-adapted features can be obtained by extracting vowels from speech and use them to identify accents. For each type of accented version of a target language, such as English, as well as the standard one, it is assumed that the features of the five fundamental vowels are located relatively constantly in the feature space. In Fig. 2, the first two feature dimensions are taken to illustrate the position of five vowels in accented and non-accented (standard) languages [13]. The center in each pentagon is the weighted average of five vowels based on their positions in feature space and frequency of appearance in the corpus. By matching the center of the pentagon of the standard and the accented language into the overlapped pentagon in the bottom of Fig. 2, the Bhattacharyya distances [1] between each pair of corresponding vowels and their angles can be computed and stored in a vector. This vector Vi represents the difference from the accented language Li to the standard one L. To classify the test speech into one of the accent categories L1, L2, . . . , LN , where N is the number of accents, the difference from Vj to Vi, i ∈ [1, N ] and V (category of the standard language) are computed and classified to the nearest category of accent."

      "text" : "Motivated by the method of modeling attributes of speakers using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) in [6], here we use GMMs to model the attributes of accents. Gaussian mixture density models the feature distribution of each accent as a weighted sum of multiple Gaussian distributions. Given row feature vector x in M ×K feature matrix X , where M is feature dimension and K is the number of feature vectors, in the probability of x can be formulated as\np(x|λ) = N∑ i=1 wibi(x), (3)\nwhere N is the number of mixture components, and\nbi(x) = 1 (2π)M/2|Σi|1/2 exp{−1 2 (x−µi)TΣ−1i (x−µi)}. (4) bi(x), i = 1, . . . , N , are the component densities, wi are the mixture weight for ith mixture, and λ = {wi, µi,Σi} is the collective representation of the parameters.\nGiven feature matrix X of accent type s, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is used to maximize the GMM likelihood, which can be written as\nλ∗ = arg max λ p(X|λ) = arg max λ K∏ k=1 p(xk|λ). (5)\nSince this expression is non-linear and direct maximization is difficult, the parameter set λ = {w, µ,Σ} is iteratively estimated using a special case of the ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm and is summarized below:\nw̄i = 1\nK K∑ k=1 p(i|xk, λ);\nµ̄i = ∑K k=1 p(i|xk, λ)xk∑K k=1 p(i|xk, λ) ; (6)\nσ̄2i = ∑K k=1 p(i|xk, λ)x2k∑K k=1 p(i|xk, λ) − µ̄2i ,\nwhere w̄i, µ̄i, σ̄2i , i = 1, ..., N are the mixture weights, means, and variances for the ith component; p(i|xk, λ) is the a posteriori probability for the i-th component given by\np(i|xk, λ) = wibi(xk)∑N j=1 wjbj(xk) . (7)\nThese estimates are based on the assumption of independence among feature dimension, so for each accent type s, the non-zero values of the covariance matrix are only on the diagonals. This algorithm guarantees a monotonic increase of the model’s likelihood on each EM iteration.\nAfter obtaining the GMM parameter set λs for accent class s ∈ [1, S], the GMM-based classifier, which maximize a posteriori probability for feature matrix X is:\nŜ = arg max s∈[1,S] p(λs|X) = arg max s∈[1,S] p(X|λs)p(λs) p(X)\n∝ arg max s∈[1,S] p(X|λs)\n∝ arg max s∈[1,S] K∑ k=1 logp(xk|λs). (8)\nThe first equation is due to Bayes’ rule. The first proportion is assuming p(λs) = 1/S and p(X) is the same for all accent models. The second proportion uses logarithm and independence between input samples xk, k ∈ [1,K]."

      "text" : "Compared with Principle Component Analysis (PCA), which transforms data into eigenspace and preserves the data dimensions with larger variation [5], Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) reduces dimensions by mapping data into a subspace while maximizing the discriminative information. Assume there are K = ∑S s=1Ks number of M - dimensional data vectors xk in S classes, where Ks is the number of vectors in class s ∈ [1, S]. Let the global mean Φ over all classes be Φ = 1K ∑K k xk and the local mean\nΦs for each class s be Φs = 1Ks ∑\nxk∈s xk respectively. Then, we define between-class scatter SB and within-class scatter SW by\nSB = 1\nK K∑ k=1 (xk −Φ)(xk −Φ)T , (9)\nSW = 1\nS S∑ s=1 ∑ xk∈s (xk −Φs)(xk −Φs)T . (10)\nIf we choose w from the underlying space W , then wTSBw and wTSWw are the projections of SB and SW onto the direction w. Searching the directions w for the best class discrimination is equivalent to maximizing the ratio of (wTSBw)/(w\nTSWw) subject to wTSWw = 1. The latter is called the Fisher Discriminant Function and can be converted to by Lagrange multipliers and solved by eigendecomposition of S−1W SB . By selecting eigenvectors associated with the most significant m eigenvalues of S−1W SB , one can map the original M -dimensional data into a mdimensional subspace for discriminative feature reduction.\nLDA is derived with the assumption that features in various dimensions have the same variance, which may not be the case in the real problem. For example, consider two classes of data with the Gaussian distributions shown in\nwww.inin.com ©2012 Interactive Intelligence Group Inc.\nFig. 3. They have the same variance and slightly different means in one direction, while same mean and significantly different variances in the other distribution. LDA will project the data to the first direction, since it maximizes the ratio of between-class scatter SB and within-class scatter SW . However, the other direction will lead to the best discriminant information in this case. This work uses Kumar’s method [10] to generalize LDA to HLDA using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on Gaussian distributions."

However, it requires recognizing these vowels in the front end. During training and development, the phoneme alignment is performed to extract vowels, while during testing, a subset of the recognized vowels with certain level of confidence are selected after phoneme recognition.

There are at least several areas that can be addressed for further improvement. First, more sophisticated classifiers such as deep neural network classifier [9, 7] may also be used for accent classification. Second, since the data for each accent is very limited, a universal classifier based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), instead of traditional GMMs for each accents can be explore [11]. RBM is trained using data of all accents, with capability to deviate with different accents. Third, accent clustering based on certain distance measurements, such as Bhattacharyya distance [1] can also be used to pre-classify accents into several clusters, which may potentially help narrow down the search scope and improve the classification accuracy. Forth, in the triphone phoneme alignment and recognition, currently all triphones with the same mid-phone are treated the same. However, the accent patterns may stay in the transition of phonemes, which can be investigated later."

With input about 20-second accented speech, this system achieves classification rate of 51% on a 7-way classification system focusing on the major types of accents in English, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art results in this field.",
