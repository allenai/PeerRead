      "text" : "Argumentation consists in reasoning with conflicting information based on the exchange and evaluation of interacting arguments. The most popular way to represent argumentation process was proposed by Dung (1995) with argumentation frameworks modelized by binary graphs, where the nodes represent the arguments, and the edges represent the attacks between them. From these argumentation frameworks, several semantics indicating which sets of arguments, called extensions, are mutually compatible were proposed (see (Baroni, Caminada, and Giacomin 2011) for an overview). However, for applications with a big number of arguments, it can be problematic to have only two levels of evaluations (arguments are either accepted or rejected). For instance, such a limitation can be questionable when using argumentation for debate platforms on the web (see (Leite and Martins 2011) for such a discussion).\nIn order to fix these problems, a solution consists in using semantics that distinguish arguments not with the classical accepted/rejected evaluations, but with a large number of levels of acceptability. A lot of these semantics, called ranking-based semantics, were proposed in recent years (Amgoud and Ben-Naim 2013; Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2005; Leite and Martins 2011; Matt and Toni 2008; Gabbay 2012) with, for each semantics, different behaviour and logical properties. However, all these semantics have never been compared between them.\nCopyright c© 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nThis is what we propose in this work. We study the existing ranking-based semantics in the literature (focusing on the semantics that return a unique ranking between arguments) in the light of the proposed properties. That allows us to underline the differences of behavior between those semantics, and to propose a better reading of the different choices one has on this matter.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The following section gives the relevant background regarding abstract argumentation and ranking-based semantics. The next section presents the different properties that have been introduced in the literature, whereas the next one formally introduces the existing ranking-based semantics. Note that due to space constraints, we can not recall all the details and justifications of semantics and properties of the literature, but the reader can find them in the corresponding papers. In the next section we discuss the different properties and compare the semantics, and the final section concludes."

      "heading" : "Preliminaries",
      "text" : "In this section, we start by briefly recalling what is a Dung’s abstract argumentation framework (Dung 1995).\nDefinition 1. An argumentation framework (AF) is a pair F = 〈A,R〉 with A a set of arguments and R a binary relation on A, i.e. R ⊆ A × A, called the attack relation. A set of arguments S ⊆ A attacks an argument b ∈ A, if there exists a ∈ S, such that (a, b) ∈ R. We note Arg(F ) = A.\nLet AF be the set of all argumentation frameworks. For two AFs F = 〈A,R〉 and G = 〈A′, R′〉, we define the union F ∪G = 〈A ∪A′, R ∪R′〉.\nWe can now introduce some useful notions in order to formalize properties of argumentation frameworks.\nDefinition 2. Let F = 〈A,R〉 be an AF and a, b ∈ A. A path P from b to a, noted P (b, a), is a sequence s = 〈a0, . . . , an〉 of arguments such that a0 = a, an = b and ∀i < n, (ai+1, ai) ∈ R. We denote by lP = n the length of P. A defender (resp. attacker) of a is an argument situated at the beginning of an even-length (resp. oddlength) path. We denote the multiset of defenders and attackers of a by R+n (a) = {b | ∃P (b, a) with lP ∈ 2N} and R−n (a) = {b | ∃P (b, a)with lP ∈ 2N+1} respectively. The direct attackers of a are arguments in R−1 (a). An argument a is defended if R+2 (a) 6= ∅.\nA defense root (resp. attack root) is a non-attacked defender (resp. attacker). We denote the multiset of defense roots and attack roots of a by BR+n (a) = {b ∈ R+n (a) | |R − 1 (b)| = 0} and BR −\nn (a) = {b ∈ R−n (a) | |R −\n1 (b)| = 0} respectively. A path from b to a is a defense branch (resp. attack branch) if b is a defense (resp. attack) root of a. Let us note BR+(a) = ⋃\nn BR + n (a)\nand BR−(a) = ⋃\nn BR − n (a).\nThe connected components of an AF are the set of largest subgraphs of AF, denoted by cc(AF ), where two arguments are in the same component of AF if and only if there is some path (ignoring the direction of the edges) between them.\nIn Dung’s framework (Dung 1995), the acceptability of an argument depends on its membership to some sets, called extensions. Another way to select a set of acceptable arguments is to rank arguments from the most to the least acceptable ones. Ranking-based semantics aim at determining such a ranking between arguments.\nDefinition 3. A ranking-based semantics σ associates to any argumentation framework AF = 〈A,R〉 a ranking σAF on A, where σAF is a preorder (a reflexive and transitive relation) on A. a σAF b means that a is at least as acceptable as b (a ≃σAF b is a shortcut for a σ AF b and b σ AF a, and a ≻σAF b is a shortcut for a σ AF b and b σ AF a).\nWhen there is no ambiguity about the argumentation framework in question, we will use σ instead of σAF .\nFinally, we need to introduce the notion of lexicographical order in order to define some ranking-based semantics.\nDefinition 4. A lexicographical order between two vectors of real number V = 〈V1, . . . , Vn〉 and V ′ = 〈V ′1 , . . . , V ′\nn〉, is defined as V lex V ′ iff ∃i ≤ n s.t. Vi ≥ V ′i and ∀j < i, Vj = V ′ j ."

      "heading" : "Properties",
      "text" : "Let us recall the logical properties proposed in the literature for ranking-based semantics. Please note that all the properties are not mandatory (we will see later that some of them are incompatible), but we want to give all of them for completeness and since we will check them for the existing ranking-based semantics. Unless stated explicitly, all the properties are defined for a ranking-based semantics σ, ∀AF ∈ AF and ∀a, b ∈ Arg(AF ).\nDefinition 5. An isomorphism γ between two argumentation frameworks AF = 〈A,R〉 and AF’ = 〈A′, R′〉 is a bijective function γ : A → A′ such that ∀x, y ∈ A, (x, y) ∈ R iff (γ(x), γ(y)) ∈ R′. With a slight abuse of notation, we will note AF ′ = γ(AF ).\nAbstraction. The ranking on A should be defined only on the basis of the attacks between arguments. (Abs) Let AF,AF ′ ∈ AF. For any isomorphism γ s.t. AF ′ = γ(AF ), we have a σAF b iff γ(a) σ AF ′ γ(b)\nIndependence. The ranking between two arguments a and b should be independent of any argument that is neither connected to a nor to b. (In) ∀AF ′ ∈ cc(AF ), ∀a, b ∈ Arg(AF ′),\na σAF ′ b⇒ a σ AF b\nWe may have expectations regarding the best and worst arguments that we may find in an AF: Void Precedence. A non-attacked argument is ranked strictly higher than any attacked argument. (VP) R−1 (a) = ∅ and R − 1 (b) 6= ∅ ⇒ a ≻ σ b\nSelf-Contradiction. A self-attacking argument is ranked lower than any non self-attacking argument. (SC) (a, a) /∈ R and (b, b) ∈ R ⇒ a ≻σ b\nThe following local properties are concerned with the direct attackers, or defenders, of arguments: Cardinality Precedence. The greater the number of direct attackers for an argument, the weaker the level of acceptability of this argument. (CP) |R−1 (a)| < |R − 1 (b)| ⇒ a ≻ σ b\nQuality Precedence. The greater the acceptability of one direct attacker for an argument, the weaker the level of acceptability of this argument. (QP) ∃c ∈ R−1 (b) s.t. ∀d ∈ R − 1 (a), c ≻ σ d ⇒ a ≻σ b\nBefore defining the next properties, we need to introduce a relation that compares sets of arguments on the basis of their rankings (Amgoud and Ben-Naim 2013):\nDefinition 6. Let ≥S be a ranking on a set of arguments A. For any S1, S2 ⊆ A, S1 ≥S S2 is a group comparison iff there exists an injective mapping f from S2 to S1 such that ∀a ∈ S2, f(a) a. And S1 >S S2 is a strict group comparison iff S1 ≥S S2 and (|S2| < |S1| or ∃a ∈ S2, f(a) ≻ a).\nCounter-Transitivity. If the direct attackers of b are at least as numerous and acceptable as those of a, then a is at least as acceptable as b. (CT) R−1 (b) ≥S R − 1 (a) ⇒ a σ b\nStrict Counter-Transitivity. If CT is satisfied and either the direct attackers of b are strictly more numerous or acceptable than those of a, then a is strictly more acceptable than b. (SCT) R−1 (b) >S R − 1 (a) ⇒ a ≻ σ b\nDefense Precedence. For two arguments with the same number of direct attackers, a defended argument is ranked higher than a non-defended argument. (DP) |R−1 (a)| = |R − 1 (b)|, R + 2 (a) 6= ∅ and R + 2 (b) = ∅\n⇒ a ≻σ b\nDefinition 7. Let AF = 〈A,R〉 and a ∈ A. The defense of a is simple iff every defender of a attacks exactly one direct attacker of a. The defense of a is distributed iff every direct attacker of a is attacked by at most one argument.\nDistributed-Defense Precedence. The best defense is when each defender attacks a distinct attacker. (DDP) |R−1 (a)| = |R − 1 (b)| and |R + 2 (a)| = |R + 2 (b)|, if the defense of a is simple and distributed and the defense of b\nis simple but not distributed, then a ≻σ b\nThe following properties check if some change in an AF can improve or degrade the ranking of one argument. These properties have been proposed informally by Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex (2005), in the context of their semantics. We propose a formalization that generalize them for any argumentation frameworks. We first define the addition of a defense/attack branch to an argument.\nDefinition 8. Let AF = 〈A,R〉, a ∈ A. The defense branch added to a is P+(a) = 〈A′, R′〉, with A′ = {x0, . . . , xn}, n ∈ 2N, x0 = a, A ∩ A′ = {a}, and R′ = {(xi, xi−1) | i ≤ n}. The attack branch added to a, denoted P−(a) is defined similarly except that the sequence is of odd length (i.e. n ∈ 2N+ 1).\nThe following properties are defined ∀AF,AF γ ∈ AF such that exists an isomorphism γ with AF γ = γ(AF ), and ∀a ∈ Arg(AF ). We use AF γ as a clone of AF . Strict addition of Defense Branch. Adding a defense branch to any argument improves its ranking. (⊕DB) If AF ⋆ = AF∪AF γ∪P+(γ(a)), then γ(a) ≻σAF⋆ a\nAddition of Defense Branch. It could make sense to treat differently non-attacked arguments. So in (Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2005), this property is defined in a more specific way: adding a defense branch to any attacked argument improves its ranking. (+DB) If AF ⋆ = AF ∪AF γ ∪P+(γ(a)) and |R −\n1 (a)| 6= 0, then γ(a) ≻σAF⋆ a\nIncrease of Attack branch. Increasing the length of an attack branch of an argument improves its ranking. (↑AB) If b ∈ BR−(a), b /∈ BR+(a) and AF ⋆ = AF ∪AF γ ∪ P+(γ(b)), then γ(a) ≻σAF⋆ a\nAddition of Attack Branch. Adding an attack branch to any argument degrades its ranking. (+AB) If AF ⋆ = AF∪AF γ∪P−(γ(a)), then a ≻σAF⋆ γ(a)\nIncrease of Defense branch. Increasing the length of a defense branch of an argument degrades its ranking. (↑DB) If b ∈ BR+(a), b /∈ BR−(a) and AF ⋆ = AF ∪AF γ ∪ P+(γ(b)), then a ≻σAF⋆ γ(a)\nOne can find the properties Abs, In, VP, DP, CT, SCT, CP, QP and DDP in (Amgoud and Ben-Naim 2013), the properties In, VP and SC in (Matt and Toni 2008) and the property VP in (Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2005).\nTo this set of properties from the literature we want to add some other important properties. Total. All pairs of arguments can be compared. (Tot) a σ b or b σ a\nThe next property states that all the non-attacked arguments should have the same ranking. Non-attacked Equivalence. All the non-attacked argument have the same rank. (NaE) R−1 (a) = ∅ and R − 1 (b) = ∅ ⇒ a ≃ σ b\nThe last property describes the behavior adopted by a semantics concerning the notion of defense, and can be viewed as some kind of compatibility with usual Dung’s semantics. The idea is that a defended argument is always better than an attacked argument. Attack vs Full Defense. An argument without any attack branch is ranked higher than an argument only attacked by one non-attacked argument. (AvsFD) AF is acyclic, |BR−(a)| = 0, |R−1 (b)| = 1 and |R+2 (b)| = 0 ⇒ a ≻ σ b\nLet us now check the incompatibilities/dependencies between properties. Proposition 1. For every ranking-based semantics, the following pairs of properties are not compatible : • CP and QP (Amgoud and Ben-Naim 2013) • CP and AvsFD • CP and +DB • VP and ⊕DB The following properties are not independent : • SCT implies VP (Amgoud and Ben-Naim 2013) • CT and SCT imply DP (Amgoud and Ben-Naim 2013) • SCT implies CT • CT implies NaE • ⊕DB implies +DB"

They also propose a family of semantics where a model is a solution to the equation system2 with one equation for each argument, based on its social support and its direct attackers. In order to compare SAFs with the existing ranking-based semantics, we chose to ignore the social support of arguments by giving them the same value.\nDefinition 11. Let F = 〈A,R〉 be an AF and S = 〈L, τ,f,g,¬〉 be a (well-behaved) SAF semantic. The total mapping MS : A → L is a social model of F under semantics S such that ∀a ∈ A:\nMS(a) = τ(a)f ¬g {M(ai) : ai ∈ R − 1 (a)}, where\n• L is a totally ordered set with top ⊤ and bottom ⊥ elements, containing all possible valuations of an argument;\n• τ : A → L is an attenuation factor. τ is monotonic w.r.t. the first argument and antimonotonic w.r.t the second argument;\n• f : L×L → L combines the initial score with the score of direct attackers. f is continuous, commutative, associative, monotonic w.r.t. both arguments and ⊤ is its identity element;\n• g : L×L → L aggregates the score of direct attackers. g is continuous, commutative, associative, monotonic w.r.t. both arguments and ⊥ is its identity element;\n• ¬ : L → L restricts the value of the attacked argument. ¬ is antimonotonic, continuous, ¬⊥ = ⊤, ¬⊤ = ⊥ and ¬¬a = a.\nOne possible (well-behaved) SAF semantic proposed in (Leite and Martins 2011) is the simple product semantic SPǫ = 〈[0, 1], τǫ,f,g,¬〉 where τǫ = 11+ǫ (with ǫ > 0, to ensure the uniqueness of the semantics), x1 f x2 = x1 × x2 (Product T-Norm), x1gx2 = x1+x2−x1×x2 (Probabilistic Sum T-CoNorm) and ¬x1 = 1− x1.\nDefinition 12. The ranking-based semantics SAF associates to any AF = 〈A,R〉 a ranking SAFAF on A such that ∀a, b ∈ A, a SAFAF b iff MS(a) ≥ MS(b).\n1The properties Abs, In, VP, DP, CT, SCT have already been checked by Pu et al. (2014).\n2An equational approach was also proposed by Gabbay (2012). This method returns multiple solutions, and thus several rankings for one AF. This is why we do not consider this method in this paper.\nExample 1 (cont.). With ǫ = 0.1, we obtain MSPǫ(a) ≈ 0.07 , MSPǫ(b) ≈ 0.91 , MSPǫ(c) ≈ 0.08, MSPǫ(d) ≈ 0.20 and MSPǫ(e) ≈ 0.78. We obtain the ranking: b ≻ SAF e ≻SAF d ≻SAF c ≻SAF a.\nAs for the Categoriser semantics, the strength of attackers is more important than their numbers, and thus e is preferred to c.

Concerning the property Independence (In), no justification could explain the fact that an argument can influence others arguments without an existing link between them. Finally, the non-attacked arguments are obviously the best arguments in an AF, it is why VP is necessary. NaE is also satisfied by all semantics. This is also a very basic requirement for a ranking semantics, it mainly says that the non-attacked arguments are all equivalent. This is a kind of compatibility principle with usual Dung’s semantics, and it says that only your attackers should impact your ranking, not the arguments you attack.4 Another property that we consider as a requirement is the Tot property, which is in line with the idea of “ranking” semantics. It would be necessary if one wants to use these semantics in real applications. This is a drawback of Tuples∗. An interesting question is to know if it is possible to refine Tuples∗, i.e. to define a semantics close to Tuples∗, but that is easily computable for argumentation frameworks with cycles, and that satisfies Tot. A last property satisfied by all semantics is +AB, which states that adding an attack branch towards an argument degrades its ranking. This also seems to be a perfectly natural requirement for ranking semantics: the more you are attacked, the worse you are.\nOverall, this gives us a set of 6 properties that should be satisfied by any ranking semantics: Abs, In, VP, NaE, Tot and +AB. One can note that Abs, In, NaE and Tot are satisfied by the grounded semantics, so they are compatible with usual Dung’s semantics. VP and +AB are not satisfied by the grounded semantics, because it only has two levels of evaluation (accepted/rejected), and these two properties really introduce graduality in the evaluation. • Some axioms are very discriminatory and provide a rough classification of semantics. As a general comment, one can check in the table that SAF, Cat, Dbs and Bds share a lot of properties. Tuples∗ and M&T seem to belong to another class of semantics: they are the only ones that satisfy AvsFD. The property AvsFD, illustrated in Figure 2, which states that an argument that is (only) attacked once by a nonattacked argument (it is the case of b only attacked by b1) is worse than an argument that have any number of attacks that all belong to defense branches (it is the case of a which have four defense branches and no attack branch), is a very discriminating property. So this property can be seen as a kind of boundary between two sub-classes of ranking properties.\n4Note that it could make sense to make a distinction between arguments that attack a lot of arguments and the ones that do not — so to violate NaE, in particular. This could be considered as some kind of power index. But this is not the aim of ranking semantics.\nThe ones that satisfy it take care of the whole branches of attack/defense. Whereas for the properties that do not satisfy it, a defense branch (that still ends by an attack towards the argument) always penalizes it. • More specific properties. As mentioned already, axioms operate at different levels. We observe that ‘local’ axioms (CP, QP, DP, (S)CT), just looking at direct attackers (or defenders), make choice which can be justified in some situations, but which seem hardly general (and sometimes impossible to reconcile with some more global properties, as our Prop. 1 shows). Properties related to ‘change’ (⊕DB, +DB, ↑AB, ↑DB, +AB) are very appealing. One of our contribution is to have systematically generalized them. • Defining axiomatically the worst arguments is not obvious. Interestingly, while all semantics agree axiomatically on which arguments should be the best in a system (VP), there is no consensus regarding the worst arguments. SC is very interesting in that respect. It makes the observation that a self-contradicting argument is intrinsically flawed, without even requiring other arguments to defeat it. But as can be observed none of the semantics comply with it, except the one of Matt and Toni. It is because all semantics consider that an argument that attacks itself is a path like the other ones. So an argument which attacks itself (and by no other argument) is better than an argument which is attacked several times. • The interplay of axioms is often instructive. We have identified a number of incompatibilities between axioms. There is an additional remark that we can make in that respect, that is related to the incompatibility between VP and ⊕DB. One can easily remark that ⊕DB is more general than +DB, and in a sense more natural: the property is stated for any cases, it does not treat some arguments (the non-attacked arguments here) differently. But it contradicts VP in this case. +DB is a less “systematic” property (it was the original one proposed in (Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2005)) but is compatible with VP : if one accepts that non-attacked arguments should be the best (VP), it cannot be the case that adding a defense branch always improve the situation of a given argument. • This set of axioms is yet to be augmented. This can be observed by the fact that SAF and Cat satisfy the same set of properties, whereas they have quite different definitions and behavior. This mean that at least one property is lacking in order to discriminate these two operators."

      "text" : "In this work we proposed a comparative study of existing ranking-based semantics. It turns out that the existing ranking-based semantics exhibit quite different behaviors and satisfy different properties. We propose to take as basic properties for ranking-based semantics Abs, In, VP, NaE, Tot and +AB. We also put forward AvsFD that discriminates two subclasses of semantics.\nThere is still work needed on the topic. First to propose other ranking-based semantics. But it is also important to find other logical properties, and to try to characterize classes of semantics with respect to these properties. An ambitious research agenda would be to identify situations where controversial axioms are justified or not."
