      "text" : "There are around 30,000 human-distinguishable basic object classes [1] and many more subordinate ones. A major barrier to progress in visual recognition is thus collecting training data for many classes. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) strategies have therefore gained increasing interest as a route to side-step this prohibitive cost, as well as enabling potential new categories emerging over time to be represented and recognised. To classify instances from a class with no examples, ZSL exploits knowledge transferred from a set of seen (auxiliary) classes to unseen (test) classes, typically via an intermediate semantic representation such as attributes. This has recently been explored at large scale on ImageNet [7, 28].\nPrior zero-shot learning methods have assumed that class labels on each instance are mutually exclusive, i.e., multi-class single label classification. Nevertheless many real-world data are intrinsically multi-label. For example, an image on Flickr often contains multiple objects with cluttered background, thus requiring more than one label to describe its content.\nc© 2012.

It may be distributed unchanged freely in print or electronic forms.\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n07 79\n0v 1\n[ cs\nThere is an even more acute need for zero-shot learning in the case of multi-label classification. This is because different labels are often correlated (e.g. cows often appear on grass). In order to better predict these labels given an image, the label correlation must be modelled. However, for n labels, there are 2n possible multi-label combinations and to collect sufficient training samples for each combination to learn the correlations of labels is infeasible. It is thus surprising to note that there is little if any existing work on multi-label zero-shot learning. Is it because there is a trivial extension of existing single label ZSL approaches to this new problem? By assuming each label is independent from one another, it is indeed possible to decompose a multi-label ZSL problem into multiple single label ZSL problems and solve them using existing single label ZSL methods. However this does not exploit label correlation, and we demonstrate in this work that this naive extension leads to very poor label prediction for unseen classes. Any attempt to model this correlation, in particular for the unseen classes with zero-shot, is extremely challenging.\nIn this paper, a novel framework for multi-label zero-shot learning is proposed. Our framework is based on transfer learning – given a training/auxiliary dataset containing labelled images, and a test/target dataset with a set of unseen labels/classes (i.e. none of the labels appear in the training set), we aim to learn a multi-label classification model from the training set and generalise/transfer it to the test set with unseen labels. This knowledge transfer is achieved using an intermediate semantic representation in the form of the skip-gram word vectors [22, 23] learned from linguistic knowledge bases. This representation is shared between the training and test classes, thus making the transfer possible.\nMore specifically, our framework has two main components: multi-output deep regression (Mul-DR) and zero-shot multi-label prediction (ZS-MLP). Mul-DR is a 9 layer neural network that exploits the widely used convolutional neural network (CNN) layers [27], and includes two multi-output regression layers as the final layers. It learns from auxiliary data the explicit and direct mapping from raw image pixels to a linguistic representation defined by the skip-gram language model [22, 23]. With Mul-DR, each test image is now projected into the semantic word space where the unseen labels and their combinations can be represented as data points without the need to collect any visual data. ZS-MLP aims to address the multi-label ZSL problem in this semantic word space. Specifically, we note that in this space any label combination can be synthesised. We thus exhaustively synthesise the power set of all possible prototypes (i.e., combinations of multi-labels) to be treated as if they were a set of labelled instances in the space. With this synthetic dataset, we are able to extend conventional multi-label algorithms [13, 17, 32, 34], to propose two new multi-label algorithms – direct multi-label zero-shot prediction (DMP) and transductive multi-label zero-shot prediction (TraMP). However, since Mul-DR is learned using the auxiliary classes/labels, it may not generalise well to the unseen classes/labels. To overcome this problem, we further exploit self-training to adapt the Mul-DR to the test classes to improve its generalisation capability."

      "text" : "Multi-label classification Multi-label classification has been widely studied – for a review of the field please see [32, 34]. Most previous studies assume plenty of training data. Recently efforts have been made to relax this assumption. Kong et al. [17] studied transductive multi-label learning with a small set of training instances. Hariharan et al. [13] explored the label correlations of auxiliary data via a multi-label max-margin formulation and bet-\nter incorporated such label correlations as prior for multi-class zero-shot learning problem. However, none of them addresses the multi-label zero-shot learning problem tackled in this work. Zero-shot learning Multi-class single label zero-shot learning has now been widely studied using attribute-based intermediate semantic layers [3, 6, 10, 11, 19, 25] or data-driven [8, 9, 21, 30] representations. However attribute-based strategies have limited ability to scale to many classes because the attribute ontology has to be manually defined. To address this limitation, Socher et al. [31] first employed a linguistic model [15] as the intermediate semantic representation. However, this does not model the syntactic and semantic regularities in language [23] which allows vector-oriented reasoning. Such a reasoning is critical for our ZS-MLP to synthesise label combination prototypes in the semantic word space. For example, Vec(“Moscow”) should be much closer to Vec(“Russia”) +Vec(“capital”) than Vec(“Russia”) or Vec(“capital”) only. For this purpose, we employ the skip-gram language model to learn the word space, which has shown to be able to capture such syntactic regularities [22, 23]. Frome et al. [7] also used the skip-gram language model. They learned a visual-semantic embedding model – DeViSE model for single label zero-shot learning by projecting both visual and semantic information of auxiliary data into a common space. However there are a number of fundamental differences between their work and ours: (1) Comparing the DeViSE model with our Mul-DR, the learning of the mapping between images and the semantic word space by Mul-DR is more explicit and direct. We show in our experiments that this leads to better projections and thus better classification performance. (2) Our Mul-DR can generalise better to the unseen test classes thanks to our self-training based transductive learning strategy. (3) Most critically, we address the multi-label ZSL problem whilst they only focused on the single label ZSL problem. Additionally, zero-shot learning can be taken as the generalisation of class-incremental learning (C-IL) [4, 35] or life-long learning [26]. Our Contributions Overall, we make following contributions: (1) As far as we know this is the first work that addresses the multi-label zero-shot learning problem. (2) Our multioutput deep regression framework exploits correlations across dimensions while learning the direct mapping from images to intermediate skip-gram linguistic word space. (3) Within the linguistic space, two algorithms are proposed for multi-label ZSL. (4) We propose a simple self-training strategy to make the deep regression model generalise better to the unseen test classes. (5) Experimental results on benchmark multi-label datasets show the efficacy of our framework for multi-label ZSL over a variety of baselines."

The semantic word vector space is learned by using the state-of-the-art skip-gram language model [22, 23] on all English Wikipedia articles1. The space V represents almost all available English vocabulary and thus is potentially much more effective than human annotators to measure subtle similarities and differences between any two textual labels. Furthermore, V encodes the syntactic and semantic regularities in language [23] which allows vector-oriented reasoning by its ‘compositionality’ property. This property enables the critical capability of synthesising the exhaustive set of test label combinations P (WT ). Note that cosine distance is used in the space V because of its robustness against noise [22, 23]. We use v :W → V to represent the skip-gram projection from textual concepts (words) in W to vectors in V . Such a semantic space thus captures the correlations between labels without any need to collect visual examples – the meaning of multiple labels for one instance can be inferred by the sum of the word vector projections of its individual labels.

The Mul-DR model is a neural network composed of nine layers: Layer 1− 5 are convolutional layers; Layer 6− 8 are fully connected layers; Layer 9 is the linear mapping layer with 100 least square regressors.\nTwo key components contribute to the effectiveness of Mul-DR.

The second component (layers 8-9) provides the multi-output neural network (NN) regressors. Different from [18, 29], where the 8-th layer is an output layer for classification, the 8-th layer in our model is a fully connected layer of 1024 neurons with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) activation functions. This soft-thresholding non-linearity has better properties for generalisation than the widely used tanh activation units. Such a fully connected layer helps explore correlations among the different dimensions in the semantic word space. The final (9-th) layer of least square regressors provide an estimation of the 100 dimensional semantic representation in the space V .\nTo apply this neural network, we resize all images XS and XT to 231× 231 pixels. The parameters of the first components are pre-trained using ImageNet [29] while the parameters of the second component are trained by gradient descendent with auxiliary data XS and YS.

      "text" : "Given the estimated semantic representation ŶT , we need to infer the labels L̂T of the test set. A straightforward solution is to decompose the multi-label classification problem into multiple independent binary classification problems which is equivalent [14] to directly solving Eq (1) by:\nL̂T = [ [v(WT )]T v(WT ) ]† [v(WT )]T · ŶT (2)\nwhere † is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse. Eq (2) directly predicts the labels of each instance by a linear transformation of the intermediate representation ŶT . In a way, this can be considered as an extension of the ‘Direct Attribute Prediction (DAP)’ [19] to the case of multi-label and continuous representation. We thus term this method exDAP. However, this does not exploit the multi-label correlations and thus has very limited expressive power [5, 33]. Hence we propose two more principled multi-label zero-shot algorithms – Direct Multi-label zero-shot Prediction (DMP) and Transductive Multi-label zero-shot Prediction(TraMP). Direct Multi-label zero-shot Prediction (DMP) Thanks to the compositionality property of V , label-correlation can be explored by synthesising the representation of every possible multi-label annotations in V: that is the power set of label vector matrix P = v(P (WT )) where P = [p1, · · · ,p2mT ]. Thus Eq (2) is replaced by a nearest neighbour (NN) classifier using all the synthesised instances as training data. The label set li of instance i ∈ U with representation ŷi = f (xi) is then assigned as pa ∈ v(P(WT )), where a is the index computed by\na = argmin j ‖ ŷi−p j ‖ (3)\nwhere ‖ · ‖ refers to the cosine distance. Transductive Multi-label zero-shot Prediction (TraMP) DMP can explore label correlations but only insofar as encoded by the compositionality of the prototypes in V . It would be more desirable if the manifold structure of ŶT given test instances XT could be used to improve multi-label zero-shot learning, i.e. via transductive learning. We therefore propose TramMP, which can be viewed as an extension the TRAM model in [17] for zero-shot learning, or a semi-supervised generalisation of Eq (3). The key idea is to use the power set of prototypes P as a known label set and to perform transductive label propagation from P\nto the inferred semantic representations ŶT . We denote the index of the power set prototypes as L = {nS +nT +1, · · · ,nS +nT +2mT } and its corresponding class label set as LP. Specifically, we define a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) graph among the test instances ŶT and prototypes P. For any two instances i and z, where i,z ∈ {U ,L},\nωiz =\n{ 1 Zi exp ( − ‖ŷi−ŷz‖ 2 2σ2 ) , i f z ∈ NNk ( ŷi, [ ŶT ,P ]) 0 otherwise\n(4)\nwhere σ ≈ median i,z=1,··· ,|{U ,L}|\n‖ ŷi− ŷz ‖2.

      "text" : "As described above, our framework consists of two key steps: applying the multi-output deep regression (Mul-DR) model to obtain the estimated semantic representation ŶT , and followed by applying either DMP or TraMP to predict LT . There is however an unsolved issue, that is, our Mul-DR is learned from the auxiliary data with a different set of labels from the target/test data. This projection model is thus not guaranteed to accurately project a test image to be near its ground truth label vector in the semantic word space. For example, if our Mul-DR is learned to project images of cat and dog to the word vector representation of “cat\" and “dog\" (v(“cat”) and v(“dog”)), it may not accurately project an image with a person and a chair to its word vector representation of v(“person”) + v(“chair”) when both labels were not available for learning the Mul-DR model. Any regression model will have such a generalisation problem especially when the test data are distributed differently from the auxiliary data. To make the Mul-DR model generalise better to the target domain, we transductively exploit the predicted semantic representation ŶT to update the power set of label vector matrix P. In this way the target data would be better aligned with the synthesised label combination vectors in the semantic word space, thus helping generalise the Mul-DR to the target domain. This can be viewed as a semi-supervised learning (SSL) method starting from one instance for each label combination if the synthesised prototypes themselves are treated as instances.

For multi-label zero-shot learning on Natural Scene, we use a multi-class single label dataset – Scene dataset [24] (totally 2688 images) as the auxiliary dataset which have been labelled with a non-overlapping set of labels such as street, coast and highway. IAPRTC-12 consists of 20000 images and a total of 275 different labels. The labels are hierarchically organised into 6 main branches: humans, animals, food, landscape-nature, man-made and other. Our experiments consider the subset of landscape-nature branch (around 9500 images) and use the top 8 most frequent labels from this branch with over 30% of multi-label test images.

These four criteria evaluate very different aspects of multi-label classification performance. Usually very few algorithms can achieve the best performance on all metrics. High values are preferred for MicroF1 and AP and vice-versa for Ranking and Hamming loss. For ease of interpretation we present 1−MicroF1 and 1−AP; so smaller values for all metrics are preferred. Competitors Our full framework includes two main novel components: Mul-DR and DMP/TraMP. To evaluate the effectiveness of these two components, we define several competitors by replacing each component with possible alternatives. (1) SVR+exDAP: Support Vector Regression (SVR)4 [2] is used to learn f :X →V and infer the representation of each test instance. Using exDAP (Eq (2)) is a straightforward generalisation of [19, 20] to multilabel zero-shot learning. (2) SVR+DMP: SVR replaces Mul-DR and we further use DMP (Eq (3)) for classification; thus it serves as a reference to compare DMP with exDAP. (3) DeViSE+DMP: We use DeViSE [7] to learn the visual-semantic embedding into which the power set P is projected. And we use Eq (3) for final labelling in the embedding space, i.e., DMP. Thus it corresponds to the extension of [7] to multi-label zero-shot learning problems. (4) Mul-DR+exDAP: Our Mul-DR is used to learn the visual-semantic embedding, with exDAP for multi-label classification; thus it can be used to compare Multi-DR with SVR. (5) Mul-DR+DMP/TraMP: Our method with either of the two proposed ZSL algorithms used. For fair comparison, all results use self-training strategy in Eq (6) to update the prototypes."

It is evident that our Mul-DR significantly improve the results on conventional SVR [19, 20] regression model (Mul-DR+DMP>SVR+DMP, Mul-DR+exDAP>SVR+exDAP). This is because that SVR treats each of the 100 semantic word space dimensions independently, whilst our multi-output regression model, as well as the DeViSE model [7] capture the correlations between different dimensions. Comparing to the DeViSE model [7] (MulDR+DMP vs. DeViSE+DMP), our regression model is also clearly better using three of the four evaluation metrics, suggesting that direct and explicit mapping between the image space and the semantic word space is a better strategy. The only case where a better result is obtained by DeViSE+DMP is on the IAPCTC-12 dataset with Hamming Loss. But this result is worth further discussion. In particular, we note that Hamming Loss treats the false alarm and missing prediction errors equally. However, for multi-label classification problem, the distribution of labels is very unbalanced and each image usually has only a small portion of labels compared to the whole label set. This is particularly the case for IAPCTC-12. The good result of DeViSE on IAPCTC-12 with better Hamming loss but worse MicroF1 and Ranking Loss is an indication that it is mostly predicting no label, and biased against making any predictions. This explains the qualitative results of DeViSE shown in Table 1. Our DMP/TraMP vs. exDAP Given the same regression model, we compared our DAP against the alternative exDAP. The results (SVR+DMP>SVR+exDAP, Mul-DR+DMP>MulDR+exDAP) show that our algorithm, which is based on synthesising the label combinations in order to encode the multi-label correlations, is superior to exDAP which treats each label independently and decomposes the multi-label classification problem as multiple single label classification problems. Comparing the two proposed algorithms – DMP and TraMP, the main difference is that TraMP transductively exploits the manifold structure of the test data for label prediction. Figure 1 shows that this tranductive label prediction algorithm is better overall. Specifically, TraMP has much better Micro-F1, Ranking Loss and AP than DMP. The NN classifier (Eq (3)) used in DMP is directly minimising the Hamming Loss. This explains why TraMP is slightly worse than DMP on IAPCTC-12 on Hamming Loss.

      "text" : "We have for the first time generalised zero-shot learning from the single label to the multilabel setting. It is somewhat surprising that it turns out to be possible to exploit label correlation at test time in the zero shot case – since there is no dataset of examples to learn cooccurance statistics in the conventional way. We achieve this via introducing novel strategies to exploit the compositionality of the semantic word space, and by transductively exploiting the unlabelled test data.\nBesides the proposed tailor-made multi-label algorithms – DMP and TraMP, our strategy could potentially help other existing multi-label algorithms to generalise to the multi-label zero-shot learning problem. Finally, we note that many prototypes of the power set P actually have an extremely low chance to occur in the test dataset. They should not be considered in the same way as the other more likely prototypes. Thus another line of ongoing research is to investigate how to prune low-probability prototypes from the power set P."

    "abstractText" : "Zero-shot learning has received increasing interest as a means to alleviate the often prohibitive expense of annotating training data for large scale recognition problems. These methods have achieved great success via learning intermediate semantic representations in the form of attributes and more recently, semantic word vectors. However, they have thus far been constrained to the single-label case, in contrast to the growing popularity and importance of more realistic multi-label data. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate and formalise a general framework for multi-label zero-shot learning, addressing the unique challenge therein: how to exploit multi-label correlation at test time with no training data for those classes? In particular, we propose (1) a multi-output deep regression model to project an image into a semantic word space, which explicitly exploits the correlations in the intermediate semantic layer of word vectors; (2) a novel zero-shot learning algorithm for multi-label data that exploits the unique compositionality property of semantic word vector representations; and (3) a transductive learning strategy to enable the regression model learned from seen classes to generalise well to unseen classes. Our zero-shot learning experiments on a number of standard multi-label datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms a variety of baselines.",
