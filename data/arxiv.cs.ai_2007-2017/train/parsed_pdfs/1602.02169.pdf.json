      "text" : "There are two different approaches to develop multimedia interaction systems (e.g., machine improvisation).\nOne may think that in order to implement real-time capable systems, those systems should be written directly in C++ for efficiency. In contrast, one may argue that multimedia interaction systems –inherently concurrent– should not be written directly in C or C++ because there is not a formalism to reason about concurrency in C++. We argue that those systems should be modeled using a process calculus with formal semantics and verification procedures, and execute those models on a realtime capable interpreter. That will be our definition for real-time in the rest of this document.\nGaravel explains in [13] that models based on process calculi are not widespread because there are many calculi and many variants for each calculus, being difficult to choose the most appropriate. In addition, it is difficult to express an explicit notion of time and real-time requirements in process calculi. Finally, he argues that existing tools for process calculi are not user-friendly."

      "text" : "Defending the calculi approach, Rueda et al. [38],[40] explain that using the semantics and logic underlying the Non-deterministic Timed Concurrent Constraint (ntcc) [24] calculus, it is possible to prove properties of the ntcc models before executing them and execute the models on a ntcc interpreter. We define soft real-\n1\ntime multimedia interaction means that the system reacts fast enough to interact with human players without letting them notice delays.\nOne may disagree with Rueda et al., arguing that although there are several interpreters for ntcc such as Lman [22] and Rueda’s Interpreter [40], there is not a generic interpreter to run ntcc models in real-time.\nWe agree with Rueda et al. about the way to develop those systems, but we also argue that currently there are no ntcc interpreters capable of real-time. We argue, in agreement with Rueda et al.’s argument, that models based on ntcc such as “A Concurrent Constraints Factor Oracle model for Music Improvisation” (Ccfomi) [40] are a good alternative to model multimedia interaction because synchronization is presented declaratively by means of variable sharing among concurrent agents reasoning about information contained in a global store. However, due to nondeterministic choices, improvisation in Ccfomi can be repetitive (i.e., it produces loops without control). In addition, since Ccfomi does not change the intensity of the learned notes, Ccfomi may produce a sharp difference in the relative loudness between what a musician plays and what the improviser plays.\nProcess calculi has been applied to the modeling of interactive music systems [3, 58, 54, 26, 52, 49, 51, 53, 4, 57, 50, 55, 56, 48] and ecological systems [30, 60, 31, 59].\nOur main objective is extending Ccfomi to model probabilistic choice of musical sequences. We also want to show that a ntcc model can interact with a human player in soft real-time using a ntcc interpreter. For that reason, we developed Ntccrt, a generic real-time interpreter for ntcc.\nThe rest of this introduction is organized as follows. First section, gives a definition of music improvisation. Second section, explains machine improvisation. Third section, gives a brief introduction to ntcc and presents systems modeled with ntcc. After explaining the intuitions about music improvisation, machine improvisation, and ntcc we explain our solution to extend Ccfomi in Section fourth section. Fifth section explains the contributions of this thesis work. Finally, sixth section explains the organization of the following chapters."

To use a linguistic analogy, improvisation is like speaking or having a conversation as opposed to reciting a written text. Among jazz musicians there is an adage, improvisation is composition speeded up, and vice versa, composition is improvisation slowed down.”[23]\nImprovisation exists in almost all music generel. However, improvisation is most frequently associated with melodic improvisation as it is found in jazz. However, spontaneous real-time variation in performance of tempo and dynamics within a classical performance may also be considered as improvisation [23]\nThe reader may see an example of music improvisation in [35], where musician Alberto Riascos improvised in the Colombian music genre Guabina1 and explained us how he did it."

This process builds a representation of music, either by explicit coding of rules or applying machine learning methods. For real-time machine improvisation it is necessary to perform two phases concurrently: Stylistic learning and Stylistic\n1 Guabina is a Colombian traditional music very common in the regions of Antioquia, Santander, Boyacá, Cundinamarca, Tolima, and Huila.\nsimulation. In addition, to perform both phases concurrently, the system must be able to interact in real-time with human players [40].\nRueda et al. define Stylistic learning as the process of applying such methods to musical sequences in order to capture important musical features and organize these features into a model, and the Stylistic simulation as the process producing musical sequences stylistically consistent with the learned style [40]. An example of a system running concurrently both phases is Ccfomi, a system using the Factor Oracle (FO) to store the information of the learned sequences and the ntcc calculus to synchronize both phases of the improvisation.\n1.4 Introduction to ntcc The ntcc calculus is a mathematic formalism used to represent reactive systems with synchronous, asynchronous and/or non-deterministic behavior. This formalism and its extensions have been used to model systems such as: musical improvisation systems [40], [29], [45], an audio processing framework [42], and interactive scores [2], [45].\nNtcc is not only useful for multimedia semantic interaction, it has also been used in other fields such as modeling molecular biology [41], analyzing biological systems [16], and security protocols [20] because these fields also include the study of complex interactions where we want to observe certain properties showing up and to model the answer of the system to them. Modeling of molecular biology, security protocols, and multimedia semantic interaction using process calculi are the base of the project Robust Theories for Emerging Applications in Concurrency Theory (REACT2).\nThe novelty of this approach is the specification of the synchronization in a declarative way, opposed to programming languages such as C++, where the programmer has to specify multiple steps to guarantee a correct synchronization and safe access to shared resources. Further explanation about ntcc and how to model musical processes in ntcc is presented in Chapter 1."

      "heading" : "1.5 Our solution",
      "text" : "To avoid a repetitive improvisation, we extend Ccfomi with the Probabilistic Nondeterministic Timed Concurrent Constraint (pntcc) calculus [29] to decrease the probability of choosing a sequence previously improvised. This idea is based on the Probabilistic Ccfomi model [29] developed by Pérez and Rueda. That model, chooses the improvised sequences probabilistically, based on a probability distribution. Unfortunately, Probabilistic Ccfomi does not give information about how that probability distribution can be built nor how it can change through time according to the user and the computer interaction. Our model is the first pntcc model, as far as we know, where probability distributions change from a time-unit to another.\nFor instance, consider that our system can play in a certain moment the pitches (i.e., the frecuency of the notes) a,b and c with an equal probability. Then it outputs the sequence “aaba”. After that, it is going to choose another pitch. When choosing this pitch, c has a greater probability to be chosen than b, and b has a greater probability to be chosen than a because a was played three times and b once in the last sequence. Using this probabilistic extension, we avoid multiple cycles in the improvisation which can happen without control in Ccfomi.\nOn the other hand, to be coherent with the relative loudness on which the user is currently playing, we change the intensity of the improvised notes. This idea is based on interviews with musicians Riascos [35] and Juan Manuel Collazos [7], where they\n2 This thesis is partially funded by the REACT project, sponsored by Colciencias.\n3\nargue that this is a technique they use when improvising and improves the “quality” of the improvisation, when two or more persons improvise at the same time.\nFor instance, if the computer plays five notes with intensities (measured from 0 to 127) 54, 65, 30, 58, 91 and the user plays, at the same time, four notes with intensities 10, 21, 32, 5; they are incoherence results because the user is playing low and the computer is playing loud. For that reason, our system multiplies its intensities by a factor of 0.29 (the relation of the average of both sequences) changing the intensities of the computer output to 16, 19, 9, 17, 26."

      "heading" : "2.1 Concurrent Constraint Programming (CCP)",
      "text" : "Concurrent Constraint Programming (CCP [44]) is a model for concurrent systems. In CCP, a concurrent system is modeled in terms of constraints over the system variables and in terms of agents interacting with partial information obtained from those variables. A constraint is a formula representing partial information about the values of some of the system variables. Programming languages based on the CCP model, provide a propagator for each user-defined constraint.\nPropagators can be seen as operators reducing the set of possible values for some variables. For instance, in a system with variables and taking Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) values, the constraint specifies possible values for and (where is at least one tone higher than ). In MIDI notation, each MIDI pitch unit represents a semi-tone.\nThe CCP model includes a set of constraints and a relation to know when a constraint can be deduced from others (named entailment relation ). This relation⊧\ngives a way of deducing a constraint from the information supplied by other constraints.\n“The idea of the CCP model is to accumulate information in a store. The information on the store can increase but it cannot decrease. Concurrent processes interact with the store by either adding more information or by asking if some constraint can be deduced from the current store. If the constraint cannot be deduced, this process blocks until there is enough information to deduce the constraint” [40].\nConsider for instance four agents interacting concurrently (fig. 1). The processes tell and tell add new information to the store. The processes ask do P and ask do Q launch process P and Q (P and Q can be any process) respectively, when their condition can be entailed from the store. After the execution of the tell processes, process ask do P launches process P, but the process ask do Q will be suspended until its condition can be entailed from the store.\nFormally, the CCP model is based on the idea of a constraint system. “A constraint system is a structure <D, ,⊢ Var> where D is a (countable) set of primitive constraints (or tokens), ⊢∈D×D is an inference relation (logical entailment) that relates tokens to tokens and Var is an infinite set of variables” [44]. A (non primitive) constraint can be composed out of primitive constraints.\nThe formal definition of CCP does not specify which types of constraints can be used. Thus, a constraint system can be adapted to a particular need depending on the\n5\nset D. For instance, finite domain (FD) constraint system provides primitive constraints (also called basic constraints) such as x∈R, where R is a set of ranges of integers. On the other hand, finite set (FS) constraint system provides primitive constraints such as y∈S, where S is a set of FD variables and y is an FD variable. Constraints systems may also include expressions over trees, graphs, and sets.\nValencia and Rueda argue in [43] that the CCP model posses difficulties for modeling reactive systems where information on a given variable changes depending on the interactions of a system with its environment. The problem arises because information can only be added to the store, not deleted nor changed."

      "text" : "Constraint (ntcc) Ntcc introduces the notion of discrete time as a sequence of time-units. Each timeunit starts with a store (possibly empty) supplied by the environment, then ntcc executes all processes scheduled for that time-unit. In contrast to CCP, in ntcc variables, changing values along time can be modeled. In ntcc we can have a variable x taking different values along time-units. To model that in CCP, we would have to create a new variable each time we change the value of x.\nFollowing, we give some examples of how the computational agents of ntcc can be used. The operational semantic of all ntcc agents can be found in Appendix 9.5 and a summary can be found in table 1. Using the tell agent with a FD constraint system, it is possible to add constraints such as (meaning the must be equal to 60) or (meaning that is an integer between 60 and 100).\nThe when agent can be used to describe how the system reacts to different events, for instance when do tell(CMayor=true) is a process reacting as soon as the pitch sequence C, E, G (represented as 48, 52, 55 in MIDI notation) has been played, adding the constraint CMayor=true to the store in the current time-unit.\nParallel composition allows us to represent concurrent processes, for instance tell | when do tell (Instrument=1) is a process telling the store that is 62 and concurrently reacts when is in the octave -1, assigning instrument to 1 (fig. 2). The number one represents the acoustic piano in MIDI notation.\nThe next agent is useful when we want to model variables changing through time, for instance when do next tell , means that if is equal to 60 in the current time-unit, it will be different from 60 in the next time-unit.\nThe unless agent is useful to model systems reacting when a condition is not satisfied or it cannot be deduced from the store. For instance, unless next tell (lastpitch<>60), reacts when is false or when cannot be deduced from the store (i.e., was not played in the current time-unit), telling the store in the next time-unit that lastpitch is not 60 ( fig. 3).\n7\nThe * agent may be used in music to delay the end of a music process indefinitely, but not forever (i.e., we know that the process will be executed, but we do not know when). For instance, *tell (End=true). The ! agent executes a certain process in every time-unit after its execution. For instance, !tell (PlaySong=true). The agent is used to model non-deterministic choices. For instance, ! when true do tell (pitch=i) models a system where each time-unit, a note is chosen from the C major chord (represented by the MIDI numbers 48,52 and 55) to be played (fig. 43).\nThe agents presented in table 2 are derived from the basic operators. The agent A + B non-deterministically chooses to execute either A or B. The persistent assignation process changes the value of x to the current value of t in the following time-units. In a similar way, the agents in table 3 are used to model cells. Cells are variables which value can be re-assigned in terms of its previous value. x: (z) creates a new cell x with initial value z, changes the value of a cell (this is different from which changes the value of x only once), and exchanges the value of cell x and z.\n3 ! when true do tell (pitch=i) can be expressed as !(tell (pitch=48) + tell (pitch=52) + tell (pitch=55))\nFinally, a basic recursion can be defined in ntcc with the form , where q is the process name and is restricted to call q at most once and such call must be within the scope of a “next”. The reason of using “next” is that we do not want an infinite\n9\nrecursion within a time-unit. Recursion is used to model iteration and recursive definitions. For instance, using this basic recursion, it is possible to write a function to compute the factorial function. Further information about recursion in ntcc can be found at [24]."

      "text" : "Gecode is a constraint solving library written in C++. Gecode is based on Constraints as Propagation agents (CPA) according to [39]. A CPA system provides multiple propagators to transform a (non-primitive) constraint into primitive constraints supplying the same information. In a finite domain constraint system, primitive constraints have the form x∈[a..b]. For instance, in a store containing , , a propagator would add constraints and .\nThe reader may notice that there is a similarity between CPA and ntcc. Both of them are based on concurrent agents working over a constraint store. In chapter 6, we explain how we can encode ntcc agents as propagators.\nGecode works on different operating systems and is currently being used as the constraint library for Alice[36] and soon it will be used in Mozart-Oz, therefore it will be maintained for a long time. Furthermore, it provides an extensible API, allowing us to create new propagators. Finally, we conjecture that Gecode’s performance is better than the constraints solving tool-kits used in Sicstus Prolog and Mozart-Oz based on Gecode’s benchmarks4.\n2.4 Factor Oracle (FO) The Factor Oracle (FO)[1] is a finite automaton that can be built in linear time and space, in an incremental fashion. The FO recognizes at least all the sub-sequences (factors) of a given a sequence (it recognizes other sequences that are not factors). All the states of the FO are considered as accepting states. A sequence of symbols s = is learned by such automaton, which states are 0,1,2...n. There is always a transition arrow (called factor link) from the state i−1 to the state i and there are some transition arrows directed “backwards”, going from state i to j (where i>j), called suffix links. Suffix links, opposed to factor links, are not labeled. For instance, a FO automaton for s = ab is presented in Figure 5, where black headed arrows represent the factor links and white headed arrows represent the suffix links.\n0.6\n4 Benchmarks presented in http://www.gecode.org\nFigure 5: A FO automaton for s=ab\nThe FO is built on-line and their authors proved that its algorithm has a linear complexity in time and space[1]. For each new entering symbol σ, a new state i is added and an arrow from i−1 to i is created with label . Starting from i−1, the suffix links are iteratively followed backward, until a state is reached where a factor link with label going to some state j, or until there are no more suffix links to follow. For each state met during this iteration, a new factor link labeled by is added from this state to i. Finally, a suffix link is added from i to state j or to state 0 depending on which condition terminated the iteration. Further formal definitions and the proof of FO complexity can be found in [1]. The on-line construction algorithm is presented with detail in Appendix 9.1\nSince the FO has a linear complexity in time and space, it was found in [14] that it is appropriate for machine improvisation. In addition, all attribute values for a music event can be kept in an object attached to the corresponding node, since the actual information structure is given by the configuration of arrows (factor and suffix links). Therefore a tuple with pitch (the frecuency of the note), duration (the amount of time that the note is played), and intensity (the volume on which is the note is played) can be related to each arrow according to [14]."

      "text" : "Concurrent Constraint Factor Oracle Model for Music Improvisation (Ccfomi) is defined in [40]. Following, we present a briefly explanation of the model taken from [40]. Ccfomi has three kinds of variables to represent the partially built FO automaton: Variables are the set of labels of all currently existing factor links going forward from k. Variables are the suffix links from each state i, and variable give the state reached from k by following a factor link labeled . For instance, the FO in figure 5 is represented by ,, , , , .\nAlthough it is not stated explicitly in Ccfomi, the variables and are modeled as infinite rational trees [34] with unary branching, allowing us to add elements to them, each time-unit. Infinite rational trees have infinite size. However, they only contain a finite number of distinct sub-trees. For that reason, they have been subjects of multiple axiomatizations to construct a constraint system based on them. For instance, posting the constraints cons(c,nil,B), cons(b,B,C), cons(a,C,D) we can model a list of three elements [a,b,c].\nCcfomi is divided in three subsystems: learning (ADD), improvisation (CHOICE) and playing (PLAYER) running concurrently. In addition, there is a synchronization process (SYNC) that takes care of synchronization.\nThe ADD process is in charge of building the FO (this process models the learning phase) by creating the factor links and suffix links.

In order to achieve that, it is required that the simulation phase only takes place once the sub-graph is completely built. The process is in charge of doing the synchronization between the simulation and the learning phase to preserve that property.\nSynchronizing both phases is greatly simplified by the used of constraints. When a variable has no value, the when processes depending on it are blocked. Therefore, the process is “waiting” until go is greater or equal than one. It means that the process has played the note i and the process can add a new symbol to the FO.

Even if counting with partial information is extremely valuable, we find that properly taking into account certain phenomena remains to be difficult, which severely affects both modeling and verification. Particularly challenging is the case of uncertain behavior. Indeed, the uncertainty underlying concurrent interactions in areas such as computer music goes way beyond of what can be modeled using partial information only.” [29].\nThe first attempt to extend ntcc to work with probabilities was the Stochastic Non-deterministic Timed Concurrent Constraint (sntcc [25]) calculus. Sntcc\nprovides an operator to decide whether to execute or not a process with a certain probability . Using ϱ sntcc, Ccfomi models the action of choosing between a suffix link or a factor link with a probability . However, when using ϱ sntcc, it is not possible to use a probability distribution to choose among all the factor links following a state in the FO. The probability distribution describes the range of possible values that a random variable can take.\nPntcc overcomes that problem, it provides a new agent to the calculus for probabilistic choice ⨁. The probabilistic choice ⨁ operator has the following syntax: when do (), where I is a finite set of indexes, and for every we have . “The intuition of this operator is as follows. Each associated to represents its probability of being selected for execution. Hence, the collection of all represents a probability distribution. The guards that can be entailed from the current store determine a subset of enabled processes, which are used to determine an eventual normalization of the ’s. In the current time interval, the summation probabilistically chooses one of the enabled process according to the distribution defined by the (possibly normalized) 's. The chosen alternative, if any, precludes the others. If no choice is possible then the summation is precluded.” [29].\nUsing the probabilistic choice we can model a process choosing a factor link from the FO with a probability distribution . ϱ when do (tell(output=σ),) The operational semantic of the ⨁ agent and other formal definitions about pntcc can be found in Appendix 9.5."

      "heading" : "3 Probabilistic Choice of Musical Sequences",
      "text" : "When modeling machine improvisation, we want to choose a certain music sequence, based on the history of user and computer interaction. For instance, when traversing the Factor Oracle (FO) in the simulation phase, we want some information to choose among the factor links and the suffix link following a certain state. To achieve that, we propose to assign integers to the links in the FO. Using those integers, we can calculate probabilities to choose a link based on a probability distribution. We recall from the introduction that our main objective is extending Ccfomi to model probabilistic choice of musical sequences.\nIn the beginning of this thesis work, we developed a probabilistic model which changes the complexity in time for building the FO to quadratic (see Appendix 9.2.1). The idea behind it was changing the probabilities of all the factor links coming from state i when modifying a factor link leaving from that state. This idea was discarded for not being compatible with soft real-time (consider soft real-time as defined in the introduction).\nThe probabilistic model we chose is based on a simple, yet powerful concept. Using the system parameters, the probability of choosing a factor link in the simulation phase will decrease each time a factor link is chosen. Additionally, we calculate the length of the common suffix (context) associated to each suffix link. Using the context, we reward the suffix links. Further information about the context can be found at [19].\nWe represent the system with four kind of variables used to represent: the FO states and transitions; the musical information attached to the FO; the probabilistic information; and the information to change musical attributes in the notes, based on the user style.\nIn addition to the variables described before, the system has some information parametrized by the user: α,β,γ,τ and n. The constant α is the recombination factor,\n13\nrepresenting the proportion of new sequences desired. β represents the factor for decreasing the importance of a factor link when it is chosen in the simulation phase. γ represents the importance of a new factor link in relation with the other factor links coming from the same state. τ (described in Chapter 4) is a parameter for changing musical attributes in the notes. Finally, n is a parameter representing the number of notes that must be learned before starting the simulation phase. In Chapter 5 we describe how can we use n to synchronize the improvisation phases.\nWe label each factor link by the pitch. Moreover, outside the FO definition, we create a tuple of three integers for each factor link: pitch, duration, and intensity. These three characteristics are represented by integers. The pitch and the intensity are represented by integers from 0 to 127 and the duration is represented by milliseconds5. That way we can build a pitch FO (i.e., a FO where the symbols are pitches) associating to it other musical information.\nAt the same time we build a FO, we also create three integer arrays: , ϱ C and sum. There is an integer for every factor link, for every suffix link, and for every state i. Note that would represent the probability of choosing a factor link if suffix links were not considered, and is the context.\nNext, we show the learning and simulation phases for the probabilistic extension. We present some simple examples explaining how the probabilities are calculated in the learning phase and how they are used in the simulation phase. Finally, we present some concluding remarks and other improvisation models related to our model."

Factor links chosen in this phase, will decrease the importance proportionally to β. In addition, the probability of choosing secondary factor links is proportional to γ . We consider primary factor links those going from\nthe state i to i+1, and all the others as secondary . On the other hand, the suffix links are rewarded by the context, calculated on-line in the learning phase.\nIf there were not suffix links, we would choose a factor link leaving from the state i with a probability distribution (ϕ i,σ) such that . Later on, we will explain how we can extend this concept to work with the suffix links, rewarded by their context. However, the concept of decreasing the probability of a factor link when it is chosen remains invariant.\nWhen the system chooses a certain factor link leaving from i and labeled by , the value of is decremented, multiplying it by β. Subsequently, we update the new value of by subtracting (fig. 8). That way, we preserve the property for each state i. Note that we are only adding constant time operations, making our model compatible with soft real-time.\nFollowing only the factor links we obtain all the factor (subsequences) of the original sequence. This causes two problems: first, if we always follow the factor links, soon we will get to the last state of the automaton; second, we only improvise over the subsequences of the information learned from the user, without sequence variation. This would make the improvisation repetitive. Following the suffix link we achieve sequence variation because we can combine different suffixes and prefixes of the sequences learned. For instance, in Omax [6] –a model for music improvisation processing in real-time audio and video– this is called recombination and it is parametrized by a recombination factor.\nRueda et al approaches this problem in Ccfomi by creating a probability distribution parameterized by a value α. The probability of choosing a factor link is given by α and the probability of choosing a suffix link is given by 1−α. There is a drawback in this approach. Since it does not reward the suffix links with the context (the length of the common suffix), this system may choose multiple times in a row suffix links going back one or two states, creating repetitive sequences.\nOur approach is based on rewarding the suffix links by their context. The intuition is choosing between the factor links leaving a state i and the factor links leaving the state reached by following the current state’s suffix link. Rewarding the last ones by the product of the recombination factor α and the context . Consider S(i) a function\n19\nreturning the state where a suffix link leads from a state i. If we only consider the factor links, we would have two probability distributions and and no way to relate them. Using the context , we create a probability distribution Φ(i,σ) ranking the factor links leaving from the state S(i) with the product C(i).\n[Sorry. Ignored \\begin{cases} ... \\end{cases}] Using Φ(i,σ), the system is able to choose a symbol at any state of the FO. The advantage of this probability distribution over the one presented in Ccfomi, is that it takes into account the context, as well as the recombination factor α.\nTo exemplify how to build this probability distribution, consider the FO with the probabilistic information in figure 9. That example correspond to the FO for s=ab and random values for the integer arrays described in this chapter. Table 4 shows how to build a probability distribution Φ(i,σ) for the FO in figure 9.\nNote that for the states zero and two in the table, the probabilities calculated are the same. This happens because the first state does not have a suffix link to go backwards and the last state does not have factor links to go forward. On the other hand, the probabilities calculated for the state one combine the probability of choosing a factor link following state 1 or choosing the suffix link and then choosing a factor link from state zero."

      "text" : "According to Conklin [8], music-generation systems aim to create music based on some predefined rules and a corpus (i.e., a collection of musical pieces in a certain music style) learned previously. Those systems can create new musical material based on the style of the corpus learned. Unfortunately, they use algorithms with high complexity in time and space, making them inappropriate for music interaction according to [14]. On the other hand, interactive systems for music improvisation (e.g., Ccfomi) are usually based on the recombination of sequences learned from the user.\nAlthough recombination creates new sequences based on the user style, it does not create new notes. In fact, it does not even change a single characteristic of a note. To solve that problem, one of the objectives of this thesis work is changing at least one musical attribute of the notes generated during the style simulation.\nIn the beginning of this work, we tried to develop an algorithm for creating new notes, based on the learned style. The idea was calculating the probability of being on a certain music scale. Based on that probability, we choose a random pitch from that scale. A music scale is an ascending or descending series of notes or pitches. We also developed an algorithm to calculate the duration of those new notes (see Appendix 9.2.5).\nWe did not include those ideas in this thesis work. First, because choosing a pitch based on a supposition of the scale cannot be generalized to music which is not based on scales. In addition, because the procedure for calculating the probability of being on a certain scale was not very accurate, as we found out during some tests. Finally, because the algorithm to generate new durations is not compatible with soft real-time.\nThe approach we chose to change a musical attribute is again based on simple, but powerful concept. We store the average intensity (the other musical attributes are not changed in our model for the reasons mentioned above) of the notes currently being played (current dynamics) by the computer. We also store the current dynamics of the user. Then, we compare them and change the current dynamics of the computer (if necessary), making it similar to the user current dynamics. The idea behind this intensity variation was originally proposed by musicians Riascos [35] and Collazos [7]. It is based on a concept that they usually apply when improvising with other musicians.\n21\nIn order to formalize that concept, we calculate, in the learning phase, the current dynamics of the last τ (a system parameter) notes played by both, the user and the computer, separately. Concurrently, in the simulation phase, we compare the two current dynamics. If they are not equal, we multiply the intensity of the current note being played by the computer by a factor proportional to relation of the user and computer current dynamics. As follows, we explain in detail how we can calculate the current dynamics in the learning phase and how to change the intensity of notes generated in simulation phase."

When analyzing the intensity of a single note in a sequence, we reason about that intensity as a musical accent meaning the importance of certain notes or defining rhythms. On the other hand, we reason about the average intensity of a sequence of notes as the dynamics of that sequence of notes. The accents may be written explicitly in the score with a symbol bellow the note and the dynamics for relative loudness may be written explicitly in the score as piano (p), forte (f), fortissimo (ff), etc.\nTo capture these two concepts, in the learning phase we store the intensity in a tuple <pitch,duration,intensity>. In addition, we store the current dynamics for the last τ notes played by the user and the computer .\nTo calculate the current dynamic we propose the Calculate-Current-Dynamics algorithm. The idea of this algorithm is storing the last τ intensities in a queue . This algorithm receives a sequence of intensities I, the value for τ, a reference to the queue , and the current dynamic .

The current dynamics for that fragment is 98. Now, suppose the computer current dynamics is 30. This poses a problem, because the user is expecting the computer to improvise in the same dynamics that he is, according to the interviews with Riascos and Collazos.\nThe solution we propose is multiplying by a factor the intensity of every note generated by the computer.

      "text" : "To solve this problem of creating new notes and changing the attributes of the notes during the improvisation, the Omax model has a parameter called innovation rate, indicating the amount of new material desired [6]. Furthermore, Omax calculates a rhythmic quality function to compare the density (the number of events for overall duration) between the current state and the place where a link is leading.\nUsing that rhythmic quality function, the improvisation does not “jump” abruptly between different rhythmic patterns. Therefore, Omax improvisation is rhythmically coherent within itself. However, generating new rhythms coherent with the user style on machine improvisation is still an open problem.\nThe anticipatory model developed by Cont et al [10] presents some results where the sequences produced in the improvisation have different pitches, compared to the original sequence. To achieve this, they improvise on a pitch intervals FO (a FO learning the intervals of the pitches played by the user), allowing them to calculate new pitches, when using the pitch intervals attribute to improvise.\nNeither Ccfomi nor its probabilistic extension provides a way to change musical attributes of the notes nor creating new material based on the user style.\n5 Modeling the system in pntcc Ntcc has been used in a large variety of situations for synchronizing musical processes. From the introduction chapter, we recall the models for interactive scores, audio processing, formalizing musical processes, and music improvisation. In those models, the synchronization is made declaratively. It means that ntcc hides the details on how the processes are synchronized and how the shared resources (in the store) are accessed. One objective of this work is modeling our improvisation system with ntcc. So far, we presented the modifications for the improvisation phases allowing probabilistic choice of musical sequences and changing the musical attributes in the simulation phase. Since we are choosing the sequences probabilistically, we use pntcc (the probabilistic extension of ntcc) for modeling our improvisation system.\nIn order to synchronize the improvisation phases, the learning phase must take place from the beginning. However, the simulation phase is launched once the learning phase has learned n notes. After that, both phases run concurrently. Synchronization must be provided because the improvisation phase must not work in partially built graphs, it can only improvise in the fragment of the graph that represents a FO. Additionally, the simulation phase can only work in state k once the value for the current dynamics, the context, and the probabilistic distribution has been calculated up to state k.\nOur approach to synchronize the improvisation phases is similar to the one used in Ccfomi. Remember that Ccfomi synchronizes the improvisation phases using a\n23\nvariable go and the variables . The PLAYER process can post constraints over those variables and the processes for building the FO (ADD and LOOP) are activated when they can deduce certain information from those variables. We extend that concept using some of the new variables introduced in this model.\nIn addition to the variables , , and used in Ccfomi, our model has a few more variables: , , , and represent the probabilistic choice of musical sequences; and represent the musical attributes associated to each pitch σ; and , and represent the intensity variation. The variables , , , , and are represented with rational trees of FD variables because they do not change their value from a time-unit to another. The other variables are represented with cells (cells are defined in chapter 2).\nIn this chapter, we explain how we can write a sequential algorithm for the learning phase combining the algorithm for building on-line the FO, calculating the context, calculating the probabilistic distribution and the current dynamics. After that, we show how both phases can be modeled in pntcc. Finally, we give some concluding remarks and we present related work."

Ntcc interpreters (including our interpreter) are designed to simulate a finite ntcc model. It means that they only simulate a finite number of time-units.\nDuring the last decade, three interpreters for ntcc have been developed. Lman [22] by Hurtado and Muñoz in 2003, NtccSim (http://avispa.puj.edu.co) by the Avispa research group in 2006, and Rueda’s sim in 2006. They were intended to simulate ntcc models, but they were not made for real-time interaction. Recall from the introduction that soft real-time interaction means that the user does not experience noticeable delays in the interaction.\nWhen designing a ntcc interpreter, we need a constraint solving library or programming language allowing us to check stability (i.e., know when a time-unit is over), check entailment (i.e., know if a constraint can be deduced from the store), post constraints, and synchronize the concurrent access to the store. These tasks must be performed efficiently to achieve a good performance.\nThe authors of the ntcc model for interactive scores proposed to use Gecode as a constraint solving library for future ntcc interpreters, and create an interface for Gecode to OpenMusic to specify multimedia interaction applications. Furthermore, they proposed to extend Lman to work under Mac OS X using Gecode.\nOne objective of this thesis is to develop a prototype for a ntcc interpreter realtime capable. We followed the advise from the authors of the interactive scores model and we tried out several alternatives to develop an interpreter using Gecode.\nOur first attempt was using a thread to represent each ntcc process in the simulation. However, we found out that using threads adds an overhead in the performance of the interpreter because of the context-switch among threads, even\n29\nwhen using lightweight (lw) threads. Then, we tried using event-driven programming. Performance was better compared with threaded implementations. However, each time a when process asks if a condition can be entailed, we need to check for stability, thus adding an unnecessary overhead. The reader may find more information about our previous attempts in Appendix 9.3 and performance results in chapter 7.\nOur implementation, Ntccrt, is once again based on a simple but powerful concept. The when and processes are encoded as propagators in Gecode. That way Gecode manages all the concurrency required for the interpreter. Gecode calls the continuation of a process when a process condition is assigned to true.\nOn the other hand, tell processes are trivially codified to existing Gecode propagators and timed agents (i.e. *, !, unless, and next) are managed providing different process queues for each time-unit in the simulation.\nOur interpreter works in two modes, the developing mode and the interaction mode. In the developing mode, the users may specify the ntcc system that they want to simulate in the interpreter. In the interaction mode, the users execute the models and interact with them.\nThis chapter is about the design and implementation of Ntccrt. We explain how to encode all the ntcc processes. We also explain the execution model of the interpreter. After that, we show how to run Ccfomi in the interpreter.\nIn addition, we describe how we made an interface to OpenMusic and how we can generate binary plugins for data-flow programming languages: Pure Data (Pd) [32] or Max/Msp [33] where MIDI, audio, or video inputs/outputs can interact with a Ntccrt binary. Finally, we give some conclusions, future work, and a short description of the other existing interpreters. A detailed description of Ntccrt, the generation of binary plugins, Pure Data, Max/Msp, and the previous Ntccrt prototypes can be found in a previous publication [48].\n6.1 Design of Ntccrt Our first version of Ntccrt allowed us to specify ntcc models in C++ and execute them as stand-alone programs. Current version offers the possibility to specify a ntcc model on either Lisp, Openmusic or C++.

Lisp macros extend Lisp syntax to give special meaning to characters reserved for users for this purpose. Executing those macros automatically compile a ntcc program.\nAfter the success with Lisp macros, we created OpenMusic methods to represent ntcc processes. Openmusic methods are a graphical representation using the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS). Those graphical objects are placed on a graphical “patch”.

All of them are classes inheriting from AskBody. AskBody is a class, defining an Execute method, which can be called by another object when it is nested on it.\nTo represent the tell agent, we defined a super class Tell. For this prototype, we provide three subclasses to represent these processes: tell (a=b), tell (a∈B), and tell\n(a>b). Other kind of tell agents can be easily defined by inheriting from the Tell superclass and declaring an Execute method.\nFor the when agent, we made a When propagator and a When class for calling the propagator. A process when C do P is represented by two propagators: (a reified propagator for the constraint C) and if b then P else skip (the When propagator). The When propagator checks the value of b. If the value of b is true, it calls the Execute method of P. Otherwise, it does not take any action.

It means such that . Then, its work is over. If all the variables are assigned to false, its work is over too.\nThe When propagator is based on the idea of the Parallel conditional combinator proposed by Schulte [46]. A curious reader might ask how we obtain a nondeterministic behavior. In order to make a non-deterministic choice, we pass the parameters to the propagator in a random order. That way, the propagator always chooses the first process which condition is true, but since the processes (and conditions) are given in a random order, it will simulate a non-deterministic choice. Figure 14 shows how to encode the process when do tell () using the parallel conditional propagator. This process is explained in Appendix 9.4.\nLocal variables are easily represented by an instruction allowing the user to create a new variable at the beginning of a procedure. Then, that new variable persists during the following time-units being simulated. This implementation of local variables is useful when there is a process !P and P contains local variables. The other variables are declared at the beginning of the simulation.\nTimed agents are represented by the TimedProcess class. TimedProcess is an abstract class providing a pointer for the current time-unit, for a queue used for the unless processes, for a queue used for the persistent assignation processes, for a queue used for the other processes, and for the continuation process. Each subclass defines a different Execute method. For instance, the Execute method for the Star\n35\nclass randomly chooses the time-unit to place the continuation (an AskBody object) in its corresponding process queue.\nThe Unless class and the Persistent assignation class are different. The Execute method of the Unless objects and the the Persistent assignation objects are called after calculating a fixpoint common to all the processes in the process queue. Formally, a propagator can be seen as a function , receiving a store and returning a store. A fixpoint for a propagator is a store x such that F(x)=x. When Gecode calculates a store, which is a fixpoint for all propagators, we said that the store is stable.\nAfter calculating a fixpoint, if the condition for the Unless cannot be deduced from the stable store, its continuation is executed in the next time-unit. On the other hand, the Persistent assignation copies the domain D of the variable assigned, when the store is stable. Then, it assigns D to that variable in following time-units (creating a tell object for each following time-unit).\nWe also have a Procedure class used to model both, ntcc simple definitions (e.g., A tell(a=2)) and ntcc recursive definitions (e.g., B(i) B(i+1)), which are invocated using the Call class. For ntcc recursive definitions, we create local variables simulating call-by-value (as it is specified in the formalism). Recursion in ntcc is restricted. Parameters have to be variables in the store and we can only make a recursive call in a recursive procedure. However, Ntccrt does not check these conditions (they are left to the user) and implements general recursion."

      "text" : "In order to execute a simulation, the users write a ntcc mdel in Ntccrt, compile it, and then they call the compiled program with the number of units to be simulated and the parameters (if any) of the main ntcc definition. For each time-unit i, the interpreter executes the following steps: First, it creates a new store and new variables in the store. Then, it processes the input (e.g., MIDI data coming from PD or Max). If it is simulating the first time-unit, it calls the main ntcc definition with the arguments given by the user.\nAfter that, it moves the unless processes to the unless queue, moves the persistent assignation processes to the persistent assignation queue, and executes all the remaining processes in the process queue. Then, it calculates a fixpoint. Note how we only calculate one fixpoint each time-unit, opposed to the previous prototypes.\nAfter calculating a fixpoint, it executes the unless processes in the unless queue and executes the persistent assignations in the persistent assignation queue. Then, it calls the output processing method (e.g., sending some variable values to the standard output or through a MIDI port). Finally, it deletes the current store. Figure 15 illustrates the execution model.\n0.5\n37\nFigure 15: Execution model of the ntcc interpreter\n6.3 Implementation of Ccfomi Rueda et al ran Ccfomi on their interpreter. They wrote Lisp macros to extend Lisp syntax for the definition of ntcc processes. We provide a similar interface to write ntcc processes in Lisp. Furthermore, we can write Ccfomi definitions in Ntccrt in an intuitive way using OpenMusic. For instance, the process (presented in chapter 2), in charge of the synchronization between the and the processes, is represented with a few boxes: one for parallel processes, one for the ≤ condition, one for the = condition, and one for when and unless processes (fig. 16)\n39\nWe successfully ran Ccfomi as an stand-alone program using Midishare. We present the results of our tests with the stand-alone program in Chapter Error: Reference source not found. We also ran it as a Pd plugin generated by Ntccrt. The plugin is connected to the midi-input, midi-output, and a clock (used for changing from a time-unit to the other). For simplicity, we generate a clock pulse for each note played by the user (fig. 17). In the same way, we could connect a Metronome object. Metronome is an object that creates a clock pulse with a fixed interval of time."

      "heading" : "6.4 Summary",
      "text" : "Further than just developing an interpreter, we developed an interface for OpenMusic to write ntcc models for Ntccrt. Although the OpenMusic interface generates code for Ntccrt, it is not able to embed Lisp code in the interpreter. In addition, the current version of the interpreter does not support probabilistic choice nor cells, required to run our model. This is acceptable because our objective was just to develop a ntcc interpreter prototype. For that reason, we still do not support pntcc nor cells (which are not basic operators on ntcc). In the following, we will describe the possibilities and limitations of the interpreter and possible solutions for future work.\nAdditionally, since we encoded the When processes as a Gecode propagators, we are able to use search in ntcc models without using the agent. This is not possible when encoding the when processes as lightweight threads or OS threads because threads cannot be managed inside Gecode search engines. Models using nondeterministic choices are incompatible with the recomputation used in the search engines.\nNtccrt cannot simulate processes leading the Store to false. For instance,\nwhen false do next tell (fail=true) |tell (a=2)|tell (a=3) Since the when agent is represented as a propagator, once the propagation achieves a fail state no more propagators will be called in that time-unit, causing inconsistencies in the rest of the simulation. Fortunately, processes reasoning about a false Store can be rewritten in a different way, avoiding this kind of situations. For instance, the process above can be rewritten as:\nwhen state=false do next tell (fail=true) |tell (a=2)|tell (a=3)|tell (state=false) Although in many applications we do not want to continue after the store fails in a time-unit because a failed store is like an exception in a programming language (e.g., division by zero).\nIn addition, Ntccrt restricts the domains for the different constraint systems. The domain for FD variables is and each set or tree in the FS and the rational trees variables cannot have more than elements6. This limitation is due to Gecode, which uses the C++ integer data type for representing its variables.\nAnother problem arises when we want to call Lisp functions in the interpreter. This will be usefull to make computer music programs (written in Lisp) to interact with Ntccrt. Currently, we are only using Lisp to generate C++ code. However, it is not possible to embed Lisp code in the interpreter (e.g., calling a Lisp function as the continuation of a when process). To fix that inconvenient, we propose using Gelisp for writing a new interpreter, taking advantage of the call-back functions provided by the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to call Lisp functions from C++. That way a propagator will be able to call a Lisp function. Although, this could have a negative impact on performance and in the correctness of the system (e.g., when the Lisp function does not end).\nThe implementation of cells is still experimental and it is not yet usable. The idea for a real-time capable implementation of cells is extending the implementation of persistent assignation. Cells, in the same way than persistent assignation, require to pass the domain of a variable from the current time-unit to a future time-unit. However, persistent assignation usually involves simple equality relations. On the other hand, the cells assignation may involve any mathematical function g(x) (e.g ).\nProbabilistic choice is not yet possible neither. For achieving it, we propose extending the idea used for non-deterministic choice agent . To model , it was enough by determining the first condition than can be deduced and then activate the process associated to it. For probabilistic choice, we need to check the conditions after calculating a fixpoint, because we need to know all the conditions that can be entailed before calculating the probabilistic distribution. When multiple probabilistic choice ⨁ operators are nested, we need to calculate a fixpoint for each nested level.\nBy implementing cells and probabilistic choice it would be easy to implement the model proposed for this work. Valencia proposed in [61] to develop model checking tools for ntcc. In the future, we propose using model checking tools for verifying properties of complex systems, such as ours.\n6 It is not because one bit is used for the sign.\n41\nIn addition, Pérez and Rueda proposed in [29] exploring the automatic generation of models for probabilistic model checker such as Prism [18]. The reader should be aware that Prism has been used successfully to check properties of real-time systems. We believe that this approach can be used to verify properties in our system.\nFinally, we found out that the time-units in Ntccrt do not represent uniform timeunits, because in the stand-alone simulation they have different durations. This is a problem when synchronizing a ntcc program with other programs. To fix it, we made the duration of each time-unit take a fixed time. We did that easily by using the clock provided by Pd or Max and providing a clock input in Ntccrt plugins. That way we only start simulating a new time-unit once we receive a clock pulse.\nOn the other hand, fixing the duration of a time-unit has two problems. First, if the fixed time is less than the time required to compute all the processes in a time-unit, this makes the simulation incoherent. Second, it makes the simulation last longer because the fixed time has to be an upper limit for the time-unit duration."

We borrowed from this interpreter the idea of having several queues for storing ntcc’s processes, instead of using threads. Regrettably, since Lman only supports finite domain constraints.\nNtccSim was used to simulate biological models [16]. It was developed in MozartOz [37]. It is able to work with finite domains (FD) and a constraint system to reason about real numbers. We conjecture (it has not been proved) that using Mozart-Oz for writing a ntcc interpreter it is not as efficient as using Gecode, based on the results obtained in the benchmarks of Gecode, where Gecode performs better than MozartOz in constraint solving.\nRueda’s sim was developed as a framework to simulate multimedia semantic interaction applications. This interpreter was the first one representing rational trees, finite domain , and finite domain sets constraint systems. One drawback of this interpreter is the use of Screamer [47] to represent the constraint systems. Screamer is a framework for constraint logic programming written in Common Lisp. Unfortunately, Screamer is not designed for high performance. This makes the execution of the ntcc models in Rueda’s sim not suitable for real-time interaction."

Lman was a great success in the history of ntcc interpreters because by using Lman it was possible to program Lego Robots, and formally predict the behavior of the robots. A few years later, Rueda’s sim was capable to model multimedia interaction systems.\nAlthough, it is beyond the scope of this research to evaluate whether those interpreters are faster than Ntccrt or whether they are able to interact in real-time with a human player, we conjecture that they are not appropriate for real-time interaction for simulating hundreds of time-units in complex models such as Ccfomi, based on the results presented by their authors.\nIn this chapter we want evaluate the performance of our ntcc interpreter prototypes and also to evaluate the behavior of Ntccrt. In order to achieve these goals, we performed different tests to Ntccrt and to our previous implementations of ntcc.\nFirst, we tried to develop a generic implementation of lightweight threads that could be used in Lispworks. The purpose was to use threads to manage concurrency in ntcc interpreters. We compared Lisp processes (medium-weight threads), our\nimplementation of threads based on continuations, and our implementation of threads based on event-driven programming.\nWe found out that continuations are not efficient in Lispworks. We also found out that the event-driven implementation of threads is faster than using Lisp processes or continuations. However, it is very difficult to express instructions such as go-to jumps, exceptions and local variable definition on event-driven programming.\nThen, we tried using both Lisp processes and the event-driven threads to implement ntcc interpreters (explained in Appendix 9.3). We found out that contextswitch of threads and the fact that it checks for stability constantly adds an overhead in the performance on the ntcc interpreter. For those reasons, we discarded using threads for the ntcc interpreter. We also found out that encoding ntcc processes as Gecode propagators outperforms the threaded implementations of the interpreter.\nEach test presented in this chapter was taken with a sample of 100 essays. Time was measured using the time command provided by Mac OS X and the time macro provided by Common Lisp. All tests were performed under Mac OS X 10.5.2 using an Imac Intel Core 2 duo 2.8 Ghz and Lispworks Professional 5.02.\nIn the graph bars, we present the average of those samples. The vertical axe is measure in seconds in all graphs. We do not present standard deviation nor other statistical information because the differences of performances between one implementation and another were considerable high to reason about the performance of the implementations. Sometimes, we do not present all the bars in a graph because they do not fit the scale of the graph.\n7.1 Testing Ntccrt performance In order to test Ntccrt performance, we made two tests. First, we compared a ntcc specification to find paths in a graph with other three implementations. Second, we tested Ccfomi using Ntccrt. Recall from the beginning of this chapter that each test was taken with a sample of 100 essays. Time was measured using the time command provided by Mac OS X and the time macro provided by Common Lisp. All tests were performed under Mac OS X 10.5.2 using an Imac Intel Core 2 duo 2.8 Ghz and Lispworks Professional 5.02.\n7.2 Test: Comparing implementations of ntcc interpreters We compared the execution times of simulating the specification presented to find paths in graph concurrently (explained in detail in Appendix 9.4) running on the event-driven Lisp interpreter and Ntccrt. We also compared them with a concurrent constraint implementation on Mozart/OZ and a recursive implementation in Lisp (fig. 18).\n43\n7.3 Test: Executing Ccfomi Ccfomi is able to receive up to one note each time-unit. A reasonable measure of performance is the average duration of a ntcc time-unit during the simulation. We ran Ccfomi in Ntccrt with a player interpretating at most the first 300 notes of J.S Bach’s two-part Invention No. 5, as studied in [9]. The player chooses (nondeterministically) to play a note or postpone the decision for the next time-unit. It took an average of 20 milliseconds per time-unit, scheduling around 880 processes per time-unit, and simulating 300 time-units. We simulated these experiment 100 times. Detailed results can be found at Appendix 9.6. We do not present musical results, since it is out of the scope of this work to conclude whether Ccfomi produces or not an improvisation “appealing to the ear”. We are only interested on performance tests.\nPachet argues in [28] that an improvisation system able to learn and produce sequences in less than 30ms is appropriate for real-time interaction. Since Ccfomi has a response time of 20ms in average for a 300 time-units simulation, we conclude that it is capable of real-time interaction according to Pachet’s research."

Although this idea is very simple, the probabilities are computed in constant time and space when the FO is built. We managed to preserve the linear complexity in time and space of the FO on-line construction algorithm.\n• Calculating the probability of being on a certain scale makes the model more appropriate for certain music genres, but it requires to calculate multiple constants, which vary according to the genre of tonal music where the user is improvising. For that reason, it is discarded.\n• We explained how we can change the intensity of the notes generated in the improvisation. This kind of variation in the intensity is something new for machine improvisation systems as far as we know. We believe that this kind of approach, where simple variations can be made while preserving the style learned from the user and being compatible with real-time implementations, should be a topic of investigation in future work.\n• We used cells to represent the variables changing from a time-unit to another. Using cells we modeled a probabilistic distribution that changes according to the user and computer interaction. As far as we know, this is the first pntcc model where probabilistic distributions change between time-units. Unfortunately, current version of Ntccrt does not support cells nor probabilistic choice.\n• We ran Ccfomi in Ntccrt taking an average of 20 milliseconds per time-unit (see Chapter 7).

      "heading" : "8.2 Concluding remarks",
      "text" : "We show how we can make a probabilistic extension of Ccfomi using the Factor Oracle. This extension has three main features. First, it preserves the linear time and space complexity of the on-line Factor Oracle algorithm. The Factor Oracle was chosen as the data structure to capture the user style in Ccfomi because of its linear complexity. Our extension would not be worth if we had changed the complexity fo the Factor Oracle on-line construction algorithm in order to add probabilistic information to the model, making it incompatible with real-time.\nSecond, we are using pntcc (a probabilistic extension of ntcc) for our model. The advantage of pntcc is that we do not need to to model all the processes in a new calculus to extend Ccfomi, instead we use pntcc where we have all the agents defined in ntcc (except the * agent, which is not used in this work) and a new agent for probabilistic choice. Adding probabilistic choice to Ccofmi, we avoid loops without control during the improvisation that may happen without control in Ccfomi due to its non-deterministic nature. In addition, changing the probability distribution, we could favor repetitions in the improvisation, if desired.\nThird, the variation in the intensity during the improvisation. This is, as far as we know, the first model considering this kind of variation. Generating variations in the intensity during improvisation, we avoid sharp differences between the user and computer intensity, making the improvisation appealing to the ear (according the musicians we interviewed). Variations in the musical attributes are well-known for decades in Computer Assisted Composition, but in interactive systems (such as machine improvisation) variations are still an open subject, in part, due to the realtime requirements of the interactive systems.\nIf the reader does not consider relevant using process calculi (such as pntcc) to model, verify and execute a real-time music improvisation system, we pose the reader the following questions. Has the reader developed a real-time improvisation system on a programming language mixing non-deterministic and probabilistic choices? Try verifying the system formally! Is it an easy task? Would the reader be able to write such system in 50 lines of code? Using pntcc, we did it.\nIf we can model such systems using pntcc and process calculi have been wellknown in theory of concurrency for the past two decades, why they have not been used in real-life applications? Garavel argues that models based on process calculi are not widespread because there are many calculi and many variants for each calculus, being difficult to choose the most appropriate. In addition, it is difficult to express an explicit notion of time and real-time requirements in process calculi. Finally, he argues that existing tools for process calculi are not user-friendly.\nWe want to make process calculi widespread for real-life applications. We left the task of representing real-time in process calculi and choosing the appropriate variant of each calculus for each application to senior researchers. This work focuses on developing a real-life application with pntcc and showing that our interpreter Ntccrt is a user-friendly tool, providing a graphical interface to describe ntcc processes easily and compile models such as Ccfomi to efficient C++ programs capable of realtime user interaction. We also showed that our approach to design Ntccrt offers better\nperformance than using threads or event-driven programming to represent the processes.\nThe reader may argue that although we can synchronize Ntccrt with an external clock provided by Max or Pd, this does not solve the problem of simulating models when the clock step is smaller than the time necessary to compute a time-unit. In addition, the reader may argue that we encourage formal verification of ntcc and pntcc models, but there is not an existing tool to verify these models automatically, not even semi-automatically.\nThe reader is right! For that reason, currently the Avispa research group (sponsored by Pontificia Universidad Javeriana de Cali) is developing an interpreter for an extension of ntcc capable of modeling time-units with fixed duration. In addition, Avispa is proposing to Colciencias a project called Robust theories for Emerging Applications in Concurrency Theory: Processes and Logic Used in Emergent Systems (REACT-PLUS). REACT-PLUS will focus on developing verification tools for ntcc, pntcc and other process calculi. In addition, the project will continue developing faster and easier to use interpreters for them.\nWe invite the reader to read the following section to know about the future work thoughts that we propose. In addition, the reader may find more information about the REACT-PLUS proposal at http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/comete/pp.html."

However, it is not possible to embed Lisp code in the interpreter. To work around that, we propose using Gelisp for writing a new interpreter, taking advantage of the call-back functions provided by the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to call Lisp functions from C++.

Cells, in the same way than persistent assignation, require to pass the domain of a variable from the current time-unit to a future time-unit.\n47\n8.8 Developing an interpreter for pntcc Pérez and Rueda already propose an interpreter for pntcc. To achieve probabilistic choice in Ntccrt, we propose extending the idea used for non-deterministic choice agent .

For that reason, we propose developing an interpreter for the Real Time Concurrent Constraint (rtcc) [45] calculus.\nRtcc is an extension of ntcc capable of dealing with strong time-outs. Strong time-outs allow the execution of a process to be interrupted in the exact instant in which internal transitions cause a constraint to be inferred from the store. Rtcc is also capable of delays inside a single time unit. Delays inside a single time unit allows to express things like “this process must start 3 seconds after another starts”. Sarria proposed in [45] developing an interpreter for rtcc. We believe that we can extend Ntccrt to simulate rtcc models.\n8.10 Adding other graphical interfaces for Ntccrt For this work, we conducted all the tests under Mac OS X using Pd and stand-alone programs. Since we are using Gecode and Flext to generate the externals, they could be easily compiled to other platforms and for Max. We used Openmusic to define an iconic representation of ntcc models. In the future, we also propose exploring a way of making graphical specifications for ntcc similar to the graphical representation of data structures in Pd.\n8.11 Developing model checking tools for Ntccrt Valencia proposed using model checking tools for verifying properties in complex ntcc models. In addition, Pérez and Rueda proposed developing model checking tools for pntcc. For instance, they propose exploring the automatic generation of models for Prism based on a pntcc model. We propose generating models to existing model checkers automatically to prove properties of the systems before simulating them on Ntccrt."

For each of those, there are 12 scales corresponding to C,C#,D,D#,E,F,F#,G,G#,A,A#,B. Therefore, we are considering 60 different scales. The goal is to find out on which of those 60 scales the user is playing.\nFor instance, the fragment of the Happy Birthday (fig. 7) was analyzed in the 60 possible scales. We found out that multiple scales have the same result as it is show in table 5 . How can we differentiate, between C Major, C Major Harmonic and A Minor? We tried ranking each degree of the scale, multiplying each degree of the scale by a factor. This partially solves the problem to differentiate among scales, but how can the value of such factors calculated? This would required additional training\nand it will be specific for some music genres. For that reason, we discarded the development of this extension.\nIn addition, this idea is not compatible music genres that are not based on the music scales we proposed."

Since OpenMusic is written on Common Lisp. First, we redesigned the Gecol library to work with Gecode 2.2.0 (current version of Gecode). Gecol is an Opensource interface for Gecode 1.3.2 originally developed by Killian Sprote. Unfortunately, Gecol 2 is still a low-level API as Gecol. For that reason, using it requires deep knowledge of Gecode and it has a difficult syntax.\nTo fix that inconvenient, we decided to upgrade the Gelisp [39] library (originally developed by Rueda for Gecode 1.3.2) to Gecode 2.2.2. We successfully used this library to solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) in the computer music domain in [48]. This library is easy to use and could be the foundation of a new version of Ntccrt."

In a similar way, we made another interpreter using C++, Gecode, and Pthreads (for concurrency control).\n59\nIn both threaded prototypes, the tell agents are modeled as threads adding a constraint to the store, which access is controlled by a lock. On the other hand, the when processes are threads waiting until the store is free and asking if their condition can be deduced from the store. If they can deduce its condition they execute their continuation, else they keep asking (fig. 22). The conditions for the when processes are represented by boolean variables linked to reified propagators. Fortunately, Gecode provides reified propagators for most constraints used in multimedia interaction (e.g. equality and boolean constraints).\nSince Gecode is not thread-safe, we protect the access to the store with a lock, synchronizing the access to Gecode. A library is thread-safe when it supports the concurrent access to its variables and functions. However, we still have a problem. Each time we want to ask if a condition can be deduced from the store, we calculate a fixpoint, because propagators in Gecode are “lazy”(they only act by demand).\nThe drawback of both threaded implementations (in C++ and Lispworks) is the overhead of calculating a fixpoint each time they want to query if the “when” condition can be deduced. Making extensive use of fixpoints would be inefficient even if we use an efficient lightweight threads library such as Boost (http://www.boost.org) for C++ ."

      "text" : "After discarding the threading model, we found a concurrency model giving us better performance. We chose event-driven programming for the implementation of the next prototype. This model is good for a ntcc interpreter because we do not use\nsynchronous I/O operations and all the synchronization is made by the ask processes (when, , and Unless) using constraint entailment. The reader may see a comparison between the event-driven prototype and the threaded prototype in chapter 7.\nThis prototype works on a very simple way. There is an event queue for the ntcc processes, the processes are represented by events, and there is a dispatcher handling the events. The handler for the When events checks if the boolean variable b, representing their waiting condition, is assigned. If it is not assigned, it adds the same When event to the queue, else it checks the value of b. If b is true, it adds the continuation of the When events to the event queue, otherwise no actions are taken. On the other hand, the handler for tell events add a constraint to the store. Finally, the handler for the Parallel events adds all its sub-processes to the event queue (fig. 23).\nUsing event-driven programming led us to a faster and easier implementation of ntcc than the approaches presented before. However, we realized that instead of creating handlers for tell, ask, and parallel; and a dispatcher for processing the events, we could improve the interpreter’s performance taking advantage of the dispatcher and event queues provided by Gecode for scheduling its propagators, encoding ntcc processes as Gecode propagators.\n9.4 Other applications ran in Ntccrt In this section, we present other applications that we ran in Ntccrt besides Ccfomi. These applications were specified using the graphical interface provided in OpenMusic and they were tested in Pure Data, using an external generated by Ntccrt.

      "text" : "Synchronization of multiple operations is not an easy task. For instance, consider the problem of the dining philosophers proposed by Edsger Dijkstra. It consists of n philosophers sitting on a circular table and n chopsticks located between each of them. Each philosopher, is thinking until it gets hungry. Once he gets hungry, he has to take control of the chopsticks to his immediate left and right to eat. When he is done eating, he restarts thinking.\nThe dining philosophers problem mentioned before, has a few constraints. The philosophers cannot talk between them and they require both chopsticks to eat. Furthermore, a solution to this problem must not allow deadlocks, which could happen when all the philosophers take a chopstick and wait forever until the other chopstick is released. Additionally, it must not allow starvation, which could happen if one or more philosophers are never able to eat.\nWe propose a solution to this problem for n philosophers, using the Ntcc formalism. All the synchronization is made by reasoning about information that can be entailed (i.e., deduced) from the store or information that cannot be deduced (using the unless agent). This way, we can have a very simple model of this problem on which the synchronization is made declarative. The recursive definition Philosopher(i,n) represents a philosopher living forever. The philosopher can be in three different states: thinking, hungry or eating. When the philosopher is on the thinking or eating state, it will choose non- deterministically to change to the next state or remain on the same state in the next time-unit. It means it can choose to go from thinking to hungry or from eating to thinking.\nOn the other hand, when the philosopher is on the hungry state, it will wait until he can control the first (F) chopstick (left for even numbered and right for odd numbered). As soon as he controls the first chopstick, it will wait until he can control the second (S) chopstick. Once he controls both chopsticks, it will change to the eating state in next time unit."

In that work, Valencia and Rueda showed how this modeling formalism gives a compact and precise definition of audio stream systems. They argued that it is possible to model an audio system and prove temporal properties using the temporal logic associated to ntcc. They proposed that each time-unit can be associated to processing the current sample of a sequential stream. Unfortunately in practice this is not possible since it will require to execute 44000 time units per second to process a 44Khz audio stream. Additionally, it poses problems to find a constraint system appropriate for processing signals.\n63\nAnother approach to give formal semantics to audio processing is the visual audio processing language Faust [27]. Faust semantics are based on an algebra of block diagrams. This gives a formal and precise meaning to the operation programmed there. Faust has also been interfaced with Pd [15].\nOur approach is different since we use a ntcc program as an external for Pd or Max to synchronize the graphical objects in charge of audio, video or MIDI processing in Pd. For instance, the ntcc external decides when triggering a graphical object in charge of applying a delay filter to an audio stream and it will not allow other graphical objects to apply a filter on that audio stream, until the delay filter finishes its work.\nTo illustrate this idea, consider a system composed by a collection of n processes (graphical objects applying filters) and m objects (midi, audio or video streams). When a process is working on an object , another process cannot work on until is done. A process is activated when a condition over its input is true.\nThe system variables are: represents the identifier of the process working on the object j. represents when the object j has finished its work. Values for are updated each time unit with information from the environment. represents the conditions necessary to launch process i, based on information received from the environment. Finally, represents the set of processes waiting to work on the object j.\nObjects are represented by the IdleObject(j) and BusyObject(j) definitions.

This semantics is called this way because is dynamic, that is, it sees a system as a sequence of operations. Each occurrence of an operation is called a transition. A transition system is a structure (Γ,⟶), where Γ is a set of configurations γ , and ⟶⊆Γ×Γ is a transition relation. Notation γ⟶γ' defines the transition from configuration γ to configuration γ'. The transitions are often divided in internal and external, depending on the system’s behavior. Normally, external transitions are denoted by ⟹” [45].\n9.5.1 Operational semantics for ntcc Following, we present the description given in [24]. “Rule OBS says that an observable transition from P labeled by (c,d is obtained by performing a sequence of internal transitions from the initial configuration (P,c) to a final configuration (Q,d) in which no further internal evolution is possible. The residual process R to be executed in the next time interval is equivalent to F(Q) (the “future” of Q). The process F(Q), defined below, is obtained by removing from Q summations that did not trigger activity within the current time interval and any local information which has been stored in Q, and by “unfolding” the sub-terms within “next” and “unless” expressions. This “unfolding” specifies the evolution across time intervals of processes of the form next R and unless c next R.”\nFollowing, we present the internal reduction, presented by and the observable reduction represented by ⇒. “The relations are the smallest, which obey the form A rule states that whenever the given conditions have been obtained in the course of some derivation, the specified conclusion may be taken for granted as well. ”[45] TELL\nSUM\nPAR\nUNL\nLOC\n69\nSTAR\nREP\nSTR and\nOBS The future function (F).

Since Ccfomi improvises non-deterministically, there is no control on choices and therefore little control over the sequence variation during the improvisation. To avoid this, we extended Ccfomi using the Probabilistic Non-deterministic Timed Concurrent Constraint calculus. Our extension to Ccfomi does not change the time and space complexity of building the FO, thus making our extension compatible with RT. However, there was not a ntcc interpreter capable of RT to execute Ccfomi. We developed Ntccrt –a RT capable interpreter for ntcc– and we executed Ccfomi on Ntccrt.
