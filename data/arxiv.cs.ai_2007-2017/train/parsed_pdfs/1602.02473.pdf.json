      "text" : "DOI:10.5121/ijfcst.2014.4401 1\nTrilateration-based localization (TBL) and Multilateration-based localization (MBL) techniques are among the well-known and most used methods for localization. In this study, the various performance aspects of the TBL algorithm are examined through the application of single and multi-objective variants of particle swarm optimization (PSO). We implemented three version of PSO in this study to allow nodes to vary the transmission power level when broadcasting messages during localization. Trade-offs between multiple objectives — the number of transmitted messages, number of localized nodes, power consumption and the time needed to localize as many nodes as possible — are studied. However, for the sake of demonstrating the applicability of our methods, ranging and location estimations were both assumed as being correctly calculated with minimal errors, which means that this study do not really discuss the localization accuracy or signal noises. Instead, the methods of this study try to allow WSNs to reduce the overall power consumption of the localization process without affecting the localization time or localizability (i.e. the number of localized nodes). So the meta-heuristic methods implemented in this paper allow one to find optimal and balanced solutions in terms of energy consumption by minimizing the number of messages sent and localization time while trying not to negatively affect the localizability. The paper present the results of three implemented versions of the particle swarm optimization and clearly show the performance of them while trying to optimize the WSN work. Additionally, it provides a complete parameter study that was formulated to enhance the performance of the multi-objective PSO (MOPSO). The key novelty of this paper is the optimization of the power consumption of the whole network without the need to cluster or build any small sensor islands such as in [9] or in [5]. This study takes advantage of the functionalities of toady’s WSNs nodes to enhance the performance of the whole network, the ZigBee technology of transceivers in wireless nodes made that possible by allowing us to use multiple transmission power levels, where the different variants of PSO were used to programmically change the transmission level after the evaluation of the designed fitness functions. The next 4 sections contain the necessary background regarding WSNs, localization, power consumption, and PSO algorithm. Additionally, a complete parameter study and set of evaluations are also provided to examine the designed methods."

      "text" : "Wireless sensor nodes often use solar cells to extend the batteries life in order to allow nodes to run for longer times. Other methods of extending battery life are the intelligent slowing of power consumption through a reduction in listening time [10], increasing the sleep time [11], or modifying sampling rates [12]. Another method of accomplishing power reduction is the use of multiple transmission ranges as is seen in the well-known CC2420 ZigBee RF transceiver [13, 14]. CC2420 allow nodes to transmit messages using eight discrete output power levels, as discussed in section 28 of the transceiver data sheet [15].\nPrevious studies took the advantage of such functionalities and tried to optimize the power consumption by varying the output power as in [16], where the output power of nodes were varied based on the distance between the communicated nodes after sharing the information using RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send) mechanism. Additionally, in [17] a localization protocol was proposed to optimize the power consumption after clustering nodes based on the used power levels. In most of the simulations and studies done in literature, they tried to change the power level sequentially while observing the effect of using different power levels, or assign power levels to nodes randomly. The two excellent previous references inspired us to use computational intelligence to vary the output power levels in order to find more stable and balanced solutions while actually being able to optimize the power consumption of WSNs.\nTable 6.1 of the CC2420 data sheet list the five different modes in which the transceiver consumes different amount of power, the five modes are: Voltage regulator off (OFF); Power Down mode (PD); Idle mode (IDLE); Receive mode; and finally, the Transmit mode. In this study, however, we try to minimize the transmit power through minimizing the number of transmitted messages and minimize the average output power levels used by nodes. Depending on the localization protocol, all of the other modes including the transmit mode will be affected by the steps and behaviour of the localization procedure. For example, longer localization time means more power consumption due to the power consumed while in the idle mode. In order to make our methods as much protocol independent as we can and allow the methods to be used with any localization protocol, the methods will only optimized the Transmit mode of transceivers.\nThe Atmel AT86RF230 transceiver, as the CC2420, allow varying the output power not only between 8 levels, but between 16 discrete levels ranging from 3 dBm to 17.2 dBm [18]. Having more output power levels allow us to have minimum length of intervals than what the CC2420 can provide. In order to observe the effect of having multi output power levels, we designed three different PSO versions. The first two of them are binary PSO, single and multi-objective, where they were designed to vary the output power between three discrete levels only. On the other hand, the continuous multi-objective version was implemented to show the extreme case where we have infinite power levels; even though it is not possible by modern transceivers, in order to show how much optimization can actually be achieved having more power levels in hand. Next, we will discuss how we calculated the power consumption while nodes are in Transmit mode and using the discrete or the continuous output power levels."

      "heading" : "2.2. WSNs and Localization",
      "text" : "A typical WSN consists of sensor nodes scattered among a field of meters. Each node has a transmission range of and may or may not be equipped with various sensors such as temperature or humidity sensors, or radios such as GPS. Each node also holds a state of being localized, i.e. aware of its own position in the global or local positioning system, or unlocalized, i.e. not aware of its own position in space. Each node in the WSN can eventually be localized with the help of three already localized neighbor nodes that a node can communicate with over 1- hop connections (thoroughly discussed and proved in [19]). Two nodes are said to have a 1-hop connection if the distance between them is less than or equal to the transmission range, . The localization procedure is the step that precedes actual network transmissions which, in the long run, will help in data forwarding and routing procedures between nodes in the network [20]. RSSI is widely used in localization protocols for ranging and position estimation, therefore, a study by Chen and Terzis [21] was made to calibrate the raw RSSI values from transceivers in order to allow better distance estimations when using RSSI values of the received messages. The study took advantage of the multiple discrete output power levels of the transceivers to send messages between nodes which put the applicability of using multiple power levels and the RSSI under the test. On the other hand, according to a study by [10], the increase of the output power do not necessarily increase the distance a message can reach. But, a recent study conducted by [22] showed stability in the RSSI values and reliable range measurements while using external antennas on Z1 motes. In this study, the TBL method is used to allow the unlocalized nodes (known as: blind nodes) to localize themselves based on the difference in distance between them and the already localized\nneighbor nodes [23]. As an example of this process, Fig. 1 shows two steps of a simple localization process. The process starts by flooding information from the already localized nodes,\nin this case , and where all nodes transmit using 132 meters transmission range which consumes 3.14 per message sent, as calculated using (3) and (4). Step 1 of this localization process ends after flooding from the three nodes, where each of them broadcast one message that includes its global position within the plane. The distance between all nodes can then be calculated from the RSS of the received messages. In this process and as a kind of relaxation to the problem, the events of broadcasting from senders and receiving by receivers were assumed to cost one unit of time, ignoring, for example, the possibility of collisions or retransmissions. Instead, each unit of time represent a step in the localization procedure where the units of time can later be mapped to actual localization scenarios using different protocols. The Transmit mode power consumption of the three nodes after step-1 is: , the complete details are listed in Table 1. By the end of Step-1, the broadcast messages are able to reach the three non-localized nodes, but only two of them was be able to localized themselves after receiving three messages. Nodes and are now considered localized after estimating their positions and, as all localized nodes, will contribute in step-2 of the localization process to help the other blind nodes. Meanwhile, node will keep waiting to receive two other messages to be able to localize itself.\nIn Step-2 of this localization process, nodes and broadcast, but none of their messages reach node which terminates the localization process since no new blind nodes were able to localize themselves. Nodes , and are now finished participating in the localization process and will not broadcast again. The process will terminate after two time steps where, in this case, the nodes consumed 9.42 in Step-1 and 6.28 in Step-2 ( nodes = ), leading to a cumulative power consumption of 15.7 . It is clear that node is very close to both and , which are the only blind nodes it can reach using the maximum transmission range, meaning that these nodes can minimize their power consumption by using a different, yet smaller, output power levels. The second method shown in Fig. 2 will allow each node to broadcast using a different power range, allowing each node to\nvary the reach distance of their messages. As listed in Tables 3 and 4, of the two steps of the localization, nodes and transmit using 132, 63.2, 91 and 83.4 meter transmission ranges respectively. Here, the transmission ranges were chosen randomly for the sake of demonstrating the multi-power level method, later, PSO will be the one choosing the different power levels leading to different transmission ranges. The localization process, in this case, was not able to finish after two units of time as the previous example. Instead, it needs an extra one unit of time after to allow the new localized node in Step2 ( ) to broadcast. Assuming that node broadcasts using the maximum power range, the overall power consumption would be: Step-1 power consumption (3.14 + 0.5 + 1.24) ; Step 2 power consumption (1 ); and Step 3 power consumption (3.14 ), which is equal to 9.02 . Thus, the main distinction between the outcomes of the two methods is the localization time and the power consumption. The second method was able to minimize the power consumption by 6.68 while extending the localization time by adding an additional one unit of time or an extra step.\nFrom the two examples it can be clearly seen that there is a trade-off between consuming more power while minimizing localization time and consuming less power but maximizing the localization time. This demonstrates the need to find better solutions by balancing the competing goals of maximizing the number of localized nodes (i.e. increase localizability), minimizing the overall power consumption (i.e. minimizing the output power levels and number of broadcast messages), and minimizing the localization time (i.e. minimizing localization steps). Consequently, the three PSO methods were designed to solve such problem and intelligently find better solutions."

      "text" : "PSO is a population-based search algorithm inspired by bird flocking and fish schooling, where each particle learns from its neighbors and itself during the time it travels in space. The original\nsingle objective PSO (SOPSO) was first introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995 and operates over a continuous space [24]. Later, in 1997 a discrete, binary version of the algorithm was presented also by Kennedy and Eberhart to operate on discrete binary variables [25]. PSO was extended by Moore et al., as the first recorded attempt, to use PSO in a multi-objective problem (MOP) [26]. Later in 2002 multi-objective PSO (MOPSO) was introduced by [27] as an effective algorithm to solve MOPs. All versions of PSO algorithm start by creating a number of particles to form a swarm that travels in the problem space searching for an optimum solution. An objective function should be defined to examine every solution found by each particle throughout the traveling time. A particle in this method is considered as a position in D-dimensional space, where each element can take a continuous value between a fixed upper and lower bounds. Additionally, each particle has a Ddimensional velocity, where each element also can take a bounded continuous value. Alternately, the elements of the positions matrix of the binary PSO can take the binary value of 0 or 1, where the value of each element of the velocity matrix is in the range [0, 1]. The individuals in PSO are a group of particles that move through a search space with a given velocity. At each iteration the velocity and position of each particle is stochastically updated by combining the particle’s current solution, the particle’s personal best solution or , and the global best solution or over all particles (in MOPSO the procedure of choosing the best global is different, see the differences between SOPSO and MOPSO in the next pages). The required mathematics operating over a continuous space is listed in (5) to (9) where is the inertial constant, and represent cognitive and social constants that are usually , and and are random numbers. and are the minimum and maximum transmission ranges respectively, and is a random number between 0 and . (5) to (7) are used to update the velocity of the component of particle , where (8) and (9) are used to update the position of that same component.\nPrevious equations indicate that the velocity of neighbors and the current velocity of the particle itself will contribute in deciding the next position of the particle. In order for a particle to keep up with the other particles during the search of a solution, each particle adapts to the velocity of the swarm as a whole by learning from itself and its neighbor particles. Additionally, to improve the\nperformance of the SOPSO, the inertia weight ( ) in (5) can be modified dynamically (instead of a constant value) using mechanisms such as the simulated annealing to increase the probability of finding a near-optimal solution in fewer iterations and computing time. Multi-objective Problems (MOPs) are known to have many contradictory objectives where enhancing the result of one objective will have a negative impact on the other objectives involved. MOPSO attempts to effectively find a solution or a set of solutions that ensure a balance between all the involved objectives as is thoroughly discussed in [28-36]. The main differences between the SOPSO and the MOPSO algorithms are:\n1. MOPSO does not have a single global best solution, the of the SOPSO in (5), that all particles learn from when they update their velocities in each iteration. Instead, MOPSO will have an archive of particles called leaders, where each leader is a potential solution of the problem. So instead of having only one global best solution the MOPSO will keep track of different solutions and use them randomly to lead other particles to update their velocities in each iteration using (5); 2. Dominance comparators are also implemented inside the MOPSO to help in finding a set of optimal solutions [37]; 3. To avoid filling up the leaders archive, a crowding distance based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is used to decide which particles must remain in the archive [38, 39]; and 4. A mutation operator is applied to a portion of the swarm to improve the exploration and search ability and to avoid premature convergence [34, 35, 37]. Using the mutation method allowed us to give up using a simulated annealing method used to enhance the SOPSO performance by dynamically varying the inertia weight value."

Accordingly, a representation consisting of N dimensions is used in order to represent each sensor that is deployed in the field. Furthermore, the objective functions for messages sent, time required for localization, power consumption, and number of nodes localized are calculated as follows:\n1. Messages sent: Depending on the localization procedure and communication mechanism between nodes, the number of messages sent back and forth between nodes will vary. However, in this study we assume that each already localized node will broadcast once in order to help other non-localized nodes achieve localization. Thus, the number of sent messages depends on the number of localized nodes. 2. Time required: In the proposed method, one unit of time is equivalent to one step in which sender nodes broadcast their locations and receivers receive the information. The step ends by running the location estimation using TBL method for each blind node that receives at least three messages from three different localized nodes. The localization procedure is going to terminate when no any new blind node was able to localize itself by the end of each step. 3. Power consumption: The variance in this objective mainly comes from the use of discrete and continuous transmission ranges, leading to various levels of power consumption. The power consumption is measured based on the power level or the transmission range each node uses to broadcast its message. Accordingly, the power consumption is the sum of each node’s power consumption as chosen by PSO.\n4. Number of nodes: Choosing which power range a node will use to transmit messages or the transmission range of each node plays a significant role in the number of localized nodes. Through use of this objective, the proposed method maximizes the number of nodes capable of localizing using the least amount of consumed power, which means the least average transmission ranges of all nodes."

Algorithm 1 shows the pseudo-code of the two implemented MOPSO versions. The algorithm starts by initializing the swarm, in Line 2, where the positions and velocities matrices are initialized and the fitness values are calculated for all particles. In Line 3, the leaders archive is initialized from the swarm particles, but a series of checks must take place before adding a solution to the archive. A modified version of the implemented dominance and equality comparators of SMPSO [38] and OMOPSO [39] in JMetal [40] are used to make sure that no dominated solution is added to the archive. However, to calculate the crowding distances of leaders (Line 4), the exact JMetal method is used. The swarm begins traveling in the problem space to find optimal solutions between Line 5 and Line 18. In Line 8, two leaders are chosen from the archive randomly and the crowding distance comparator compares the two leaders where the higher crowding distance will be chosen to assure diversity. Line 9 and 11 update the velocities and positions of each particle using (5) and (8), respectively. In Line 12, a boundary mutation is implemented to mutate a portion of the swarm population. The flooding procedure and the localization process starts in Line 13 to measure the fitness of each particle’s solution. In Line 14, the memory of the particle is updated to set the best fitness of the particle as the current fitness if it was considered as a better position by the comparators. Line 15 adds new particles to the leaders archive in the case that quality solutions are found. Finally, Line 16 does the same job as Line 4.

The networks created using these initial configurations are shown in Fig. 3 where anchor nodes are the red dots, normal nodes are the black dots, and the lines between nodes represents the 1-hop connection based on the chosen communication range. As is listed in Table 7, the first run used only minimum power ranges for all the 240 nodes (Fig. 3-a) which allowed each node to transmit to a distance up to 63.28 meters. The localization procedure consumed 20.55 mW, which is the cost of transmitting 41 messages from the 40 anchors and the only one localized node by the anchors over 480 units of time. The second run used only medium range transmission (Fig. 3-b) which allowed each node to transmit to a distance up to 91.47 meters. After flooding, 96 nodes were localized with the help of the 40 anchor nodes and the localized nodes during 1,200 units of time through 136 messages which consumed 171.21 mW. In the last run (Fig. 3-c) all 200 nodes were localized where all nodes used the maximum power range during 960 units of time. The localization procedure consumed 758.95 mW of power when using the maximum power range where each node was able to transmit to a distance up to 132.22 meters.\nFrom these baseline scenarios, it is clearly shown that using only one kind of power range may cause a large reduction in the number of localized nodes or consume excess energy to localize more nodes. The solution found by using the maximum allowed transmission is considered as the best solution in terms of the localization time and number of localized nodes. Yet, for power consumption, the solution using maximum transmission range is considered to be very poor.

In this scenario, the number of non-localized nodes ranged from 0 to 10 nodes, which means that the worst solution PSO was able to find was 5% worse in terms of the number of localized nodes. However, the power consumption was also reduced in addition to increasing the number of nodes localized. Yet, since the main focus of the trials was to maximize the number of localized nodes, the total time required for localization was worse, by 50% to 225%.\nAn obvious conclusion would be that whenever the larger power ranges are used, the overall power consumption will increase. Additionally, increasing the power ranges may increase the number of localized nodes. Fig. 5 suggests that a tremendous decrease in the number of lower power ranges used will aid in decreasing the localization time, representing a clear trade-off between these two objectives."

The continuous MOPSO method tried to optimize the three other objectives by only making one of the objectives worse by as minimum as 0.72% which is reasonable in multiobjective problems. The best solutions found by the two methods were when localizing all the nodes in less time and less power consumption. The best binary method solution consumed 600.97 mW to localize all the nodes in the shortest time, while the continuous method was able to minimize that by around 14% when the best solution was able to localized all the nodes with the same time by consuming only 517.73 mW.

Below is a list of the parameters with the results of each experiment:\n1. Number of Particles and PSO iterations: As shown in Fig. 9, seven different combinations of the number of particles and iterations were used with the values varied from 5 to 200. Normally, we expect more improvement when increasing the value of the two parameters, and worse solutions when decreasing them. After comparing the average values of the solutions, it was found that using a swarm larger than 100 particles and running the PSO for more than 100 iterations will not improve the quality of the solutions. Additionally, using smaller swarms with lesser number of iterations negatively affected the quality of the solutions.\nThe values of the two parameters were set to 50 iterations and 50 particles due to\nthe fact that when using this combination, a better stability than the other combinations was achieved, with standard deviation measured as up to 60% better than the (5,5) experiment, for example. Also, localizability was given the priority when measuring the quality of the solution, so the greatest average of localized nodes was chosen, but without affecting the other objectives. So, for example, (50, 50) was chosen over (20, 20) for the fact that in (50, 50) more nodes were localized in the same units, but with slightly more power — a reasonable result.\n2. Minimum and Maximum transmission ranges: Transmission ranges are the most\nimportant parameter in this study as the focus was to minimize the average transmission ranges used by all nodes. ZigBee was designed to transmit data on no lower than -3 dBm which means the shortest transmission range of ZigBee is 62.68 meters and, thus, 64 was chosen as the lowest transmission power. For the maximum transmission ranges, it was found that using greater transmission ranges was able to maximize localizability, and if all nodes are localizable the algorithm is able to localize all of them a majority of the time. On the other hand, using smaller transmission ranges consume less power but gives poor results. Where In some cases the algorithm was not able to localize any node, as shown in Fig. 10.\nUsing large or small transmission ranges play a significant role in finding quality results. Generally, PSO will pick the values of the transmission ranges of each node from a continuous interval where the upper and lower bounds are the maximum and minimum ranges. We varied the upper bound from 64 to 132 meters while maintaining the same lower bound as 64 meters. Using maximum power ranges as 119-132 increased the average number of localized nodes from 412% to 418% more, i.e from 0 to as maximum as 233.9 of the 240 nodes. Obviously the time and energy consumption increased due to the fact we were able to localized more nodes. For range, values of 132 and 125 meters were found to be the best values, but 132 was chosen as the maximum transmission range because priority was given to the number of localized nodes which slightly increased the power consumption but was able to decrease the localization time and increase the number of localized nodes.\n3. Mutation operator: The boundary mutation is used to avoid premature convergence by improving the search ability of the swarm. This method was adjusted by changing the mutation percentage in addition to the value of mutation. The mutation percentage was first varied from 0 to 30% during 7 experiments as shown in Fig. 11, then the mutation value was swapped between the chosen minimum and maximum transmission as shown in Fig. 12.\npercentage the power consumption was found to be less without really affecting the number of localized nodes. However, reducing the power consumption when using the minimum transmission range increased the localization time but reduced the power consumption around 13%. We chose the minimum transmission range as the mutation value to prevent the MOPSO of using larger transmission ranges in order to minimize the power consumption as much as we can.\n4. PSO local weight ( ) and global weight ( ): The two parameters are used in (5) in updating the velocity matrix to optimize the behavior of particles. Based on a study by Eberhart and Shi [42] that compared inertia weights and constriction factors in particle swarm optimization, the values of the acceleration coefficients, and in (5), were set to 1.49445. This was found to have better influence on the performance of PSO and was thus used.\n5. Inertia weight ( ): It is one of the most important adjustable parameters in PSO. value can impact the overall performance of the algorithm in finding a potential optimal solution in less computing time. In the proposed method a fixed inertia weight (FIW) value of is used as stated in (5). It is a fixed constant that is defined before running the algorithm. The value of it was varied from 0.1 to 1 as shown in Fig. 15 and used in many studies [41-45]. was set to 0.1, instead of the other relatively good choice 0.5. The value of 0.1 was chosen for the fact that it showed more stable results (up to 21.5% less standard deviation than the 0.5 level). Additionally, a value of 0.1 localized 0.7% more nodes than the 0.5, but increased the power and time by 2.3% and 0.75% respectively."

      "text" : "This paper has presented single-objective and multi-objective PSO-based solutions for the power consumption of WSN during trilateration-based localization. The overall performance of the TBL algorithm was evaluated and improved through the simultaneous optimization of various objective functions. Results clearly show that the use of SOPSO and MOPSO to optimize the TBL algorithm in terms of power consumption is effective, providing improvements up to 32% only on the Transmit mode of transceivers. Also, as shown by the study, using single global output power is less stable in localizing nodes than using multiple levels and using the maximum possible output level is not cost effective solution to the stability of localization, therefore, PSO was found to solve the problem without negatively affect the TBL work in terms of localizability in particular. However, our study can be mapped to real test beds using techniques such as the component based localization, nodes clustering, and RTS/CTS methods, in addition to many others, as suggest by [7, 8, 17].\nThe work conducted in this study will be used in future implementations of different localization protocols using Contiki-OS and real world motes such as the Z1 mote. The results of such more realistic simulations and implementations will allow us to verify the performance and quality of solutions achieved by this study."
