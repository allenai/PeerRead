      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Social media provides a public lens into the daily lives and personal emotions of its users. Since people sometimes post about suicidal or self-harm-related thoughts, social media such as Facebook have established suicide reporting and prevention mechanisms via specific links and buttons to let users report when they or their friends encounter direct life threats. Though this is a big step in the right direction, it alone does little to advance our scientific understanding of suicide, or how to predict its likelihood.\nResearchers are increasingly using machine learning techniques to observe and study a wide range of mental health problems from social media activities. Most existing approaches rely heavily on data that are increasingly annotated by crowdsourced workers. Obtaining labels for issues this way for topics as subjective as mental health is challenging, as both crowdsourcing workers and domain experts often have different interpretations of the texts they read and label. Thus having multiple annotators look at and annotation each data item is absolutely.\nWhen aggregating these multiple annotations into intelligent models for prevention purposes, how the training corpora is constructed—more specifically, what final ground truth labels researchers determine to apply into the supervised algorithms—will make significant differences to the final performance of output models. But to our best knowledge, there are few studies that have investigated how this kind of social media data were annotated and used differently in supervised learning settings.\nIn this paper, we study approaches for annotation and la-\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n08 79\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\nbel aggregation to train a classifier to detect suicide-related tweets gathered from Twitter using keyword- and locationbased queries. Crowdsourced workers perform the first round of annotations, and then experts (the authors) annotated those tweets on which the crowdsourced workers disagreed. Our underlying assumption is that crowdsourced annotations with high inter-annotator agreement can provide us reliable usable corpora in supervised modeling of automatic classifiers. We experimented with different ways for aggregating multiple annotations into gold-standard labels and compared the effects of each. Our main contributions are:\n• We perform multiple rounds of annotations, involving both crowdsourcing workers and experts, to provide a diverse set of judgements about suicide-related discourse on social media data.\n• We propose a variety of strategies for selecting the data to annotate and for determining ground truth labels in the succeeding training phase.\n• We conduct experiments to compare—in terms of how each method affects machine learning performance— sets of training data labeled by different method.\n• We demonstrate that a labeling method based only on unanimously labeled data from both crowdsourced workers and experts is the best way to train supervised models, especially when the problem domain is subjective."

      "text" : "Kumar et al. [4] presented their research on the prevalence of Werther effect (copycat suicides following a celebrity’s suicide) in social media. They examined posting activities and contents after public figures’ suicide, and observed a virtual analog of sorts of the Werther effect: that people post more frequently with expressions of suicidal tendencies, and the linguistic measures change towards negative and biased direction.\n“The Durkheim Project” [8] further analyzed an opt-in database of veterans‘ social media and mobile phone data to seek real-time assessments and predictive analytics for psychological suicide risk factors. They developed text-based prediction models from single keywords and multi-word phrases, achieved about 65% accuracy in identifying statistically significant signals of suicidality, and suggested the usefulness of computerized textual analytics of social media data to estimate the risk of suicide. But the group did not give details about the data – how they determined the labels for training data to build the system.\nIn [2], Burnap et al. focused on building a multi-class machine classifier with competitive accuracy when assigning tweets to particular class of suicidal communications and provided more details about their experiments. They requested at least four annotations per tweet from a crowdsourcing platform in order to limit the amount of subjectivity in the process of labeling suicidal tweets and kept tweets with high agreement (> 75% – at least three out of four annotators agreed on the dominant class of each tweet) to train classification models. Their empirical findings suggest that it is feasible for crowdsouring workers who are unknown to each other and without being influenced by each other‘s judgement to reach agreement on the disclosure of\nsuicidal ideation. Also based on the experiments and conclusions from [10], non-expert contributors could produce comparable quality of annotations when evaluating against those gold standard annotations from experts. And it is similarly effective to use the labeled tweets with high interannotator agreement among multiple non-expert annotators from crowdsourcing platforms to build robust models as doing so on expert-labeled data."

This initial rule-based filter acts as our first classification model (C0) that extracts suicide-related posts. C0 searches for a wide range of expressions which include: suicidal / depression / cutting / bad / sad / these ... thoughts / feelings, want / wanted / wanting to die, end / ending it all, end my life, can’t take (it) anymore, can’t / don’t want to live any more, don’t want to be alive, can’t go on, call / ask for help, offer of help, stop bullying, kill / killing / hate myself, fuck / fucking, boyfriend / girlfriend, just ... like, talk / speak to someone / somebody, web / blog / health / advice, miss / missing you / her / him, took / taken (my / your / his / her) own life, hanged / hanging / overdose, etc.\nWe ran C0 on our pooled dataset and randomly selected 2,000 matched tweets (1,200 tweets from source 1 and 800 from source 2 ) for manual annotations and validations. In particular, we anonymized the data to minimize the disclosure of personal information (@names) or URLs that may reveal cues about users’ online identities."

      "text" : "We first published this combination of 2,000 tweets on\n1http://datasift.com/\nCrowdFlower2, five tweets per page, to invite workers to finish the labeling tasks as instructed. For each tweet, five annotators were paid fairly to choose only one label to best describe the category from four given choices (with one sentence in following parentheses to provide more descriptions):\n• A. Suicidal thoughts (The author or the author’s friend is at risk of suicide/distress.)\n• B. Supportive messages or helpful information (The author is providing supportive messages/helpful information related to suicide/distress.)\n• C. Reaction to suicide news/movie/music (The author is spreading/reacting/commenting to suicide news/ movie/music.)\n• D. Other (The author is using suicide/distress words to describe something else.)\nThe rationale behind the design of multiple choice questions is: our data collection method (source 1 especially) inevitably introduced tweets covering topics such as category B or C among four choices, which are not necessarily our focus on the personal suicidal disclosures detection in this case study. At the same time, this setting is useful to manually reduce the complexities of automatic classification: Annotators intuitively differentiate the contents so that form some explicit boundaries between the target class (suicidal) and noises before passing data into the supervised learning algorithms in the following classifier modeling phase.\n4.2.1 System Aggregated Labels (R1S) CrowdFlower by default automatically aggregated five re-\nsponses into a summarized result for each tweet based on the majority vote of the trusted workers.\n4.2.2 Unanimous Voted Labels (R1U) There are 415 tweets labeled with unanimous agreement\namong five workers, i.e. five workers gave the same label to one tweet. The remaining 1,585 tweets were not labeled unanimously which have lower inter-annotator agreement.\n4.2.3 Observation The percentage of tweets with unanimous labels in this an-\nnotation round (20.75%) is much smaller than that of some published experiments using the similar annotation strategy but for different social issues: Liu et al. asked crowdsourcing workers to differentiate job-themed tweets from the rest topics in [5], and harvested more than half of their published tweets with full agreement among five annotators per tweet (64.85%). This observation and comparison intuitively suggests that non-expert crowdsourcing workers working on suicide-related annotation tasks have diverse types of understanding about this topic because of its sensitivity and ambiguity. We examined this part of data which were interpreted differently among five annotators per message in the subsequent section.\n2https://www.crowdflower.com/: This is an Amazon Mechanical Turk type crowdsourcing platform.

Among them, 47 tweets belong to“A. suicidal thoughts”, 130 “B. supportive messages or helpful information”, 270 “C. reaction to suicide news/movie/music”and 424“D. other” (see the comparisons between R1S and R2U in Figure 1).\nIn Figure 2 we further compared the annotations between two experts in Round2. We assessed their inter-annotator agreement on multiple choice labeling tasks using Cohen’s kappa [3] as κ = 0.523.\nIn Table 2, we presented several samples from two rounds of annotations with their labels contributed by crowdsourcing workers (R1) and experts (R2).\nThis table exemplifies the complexity of labeling suiciderelated tweets among multiple annotators. For example, tweets like “According to a British law passed in 1845, attempting to commit suicide was a capital offence. Offenders could be hanged for trying.” declares that suicide was criminalized in the past.

Giving another example, some tweets are talking about what depression feels like without any explicit phrases about depression or suicide prevention. Some annotators classified such messages as “Supportive messages or helpful information” while they may actually worsen another person’s existing negative feelings. Tweets mentioning suicide bombing/attack is an additional category about which annotator have diverse understandings. Such ambiguities make annotators, even experts, label such kind of tweets differently."

Even at the point of the maximum number of training samples used, the training score is greater than the cross-validation score.

Among them, C4 reaches the highest cross-validation score. C4 also has the least variance errors according to our experiments, suggesting it has good stability over others. The cross-validation scores in C2 increase and converge to the training score very quickly using the least small number of training samples among five models, but the fluctuations of cross-validation scores during the C2 training process are significant, showing that its performance is not comparably stable."

This series of self-oriented linguistic characters match the definition of suicide that it is an act of intentionally taking one’s own life and cause one’s own death, and are consistent with previous research findings [4, 9]. The primary root-word commit shows up in both classes of each model, but in distinct verb tenses: people in suicidal class write committing suicide, committing frequently which are in present tense and describing their ongoing actions, while commits, committed, commits suicide are used as common vocabularies (simple present tense) or past suicide tragedies (past tense). Thought and tried (to) are another set of commonly used words for users in suicidal class which implies that people expressed their thoughts or even attempts to end their own lives.

      "text" : "We raised a very foundational research question about determining the ground truth label for social media data before proceeding to building supervised classifiers, especially when the topic is sensitive, subjective and ambiguous. We controlled the settings of experiments (supervised learning algorithm and dimensions of features), and altered the input training data obtained from different labeling sources (crowdsourcing workers and experts) and strategies (majority votes and unanimous votes). We presented preliminary\nfindings on the outcome of learning from multiple annotators on suicide-related annotation tasks. Our results show that it is helpful to use unanimous labels from crowdsourcing workers and experts as training data to build models. Though domain knowledge and experience are necessary in labeling the suicide-related data, our results provide some evidence that multiple crowdsourcing workers, when they reach high inter-annotator agreement, can provide reliable quality of annotations.\nThere are several interesting directions to future work. We did not investigate that how often the multiple workers unanimously agreed on the wrong outcome though it would be very uncommon. Examination of the annotated data without unanimous labels among multiple crowdsourcing workers will help understand where the disagreement is\nTable 6: Top 20 features for both classes of C3.\nSuicidal weights Others weights\nmyself 0.422 people -0.119 suicide 0.385 by -0.113\nme 0.342 with -0.103 kill 0.341 be -0.100 kill myself 0.292 one -0.085 my 0.230 after -0.083 day 0.228 please -0.078 depression 0.200 you -0.076 feel 0.168 we -0.074 so 0.156 their -0.067 my depression 0.153 of -0.067 alive 0.152 year -0.066\nrather 0.150 girl -0.065 im 0.148 need -0.061\ncommit 0.148 williams -0.061 tried to 0.146 committed -0.060 almost 0.136 today -0.058 tried 0.130 always -0.058 suicide is 0.129 he -0.058 cutting 0.128 get -0.057\nTable 7: Top 20 features for both classes of C4.\nSuicidal weights Others weights\nmyself 0.440 with -0.149 suicide 0.436 people -0.139\nme 0.339 by -0.111 kill 0.314 out -0.104 kill myself 0.300 after -0.098 depression 0.251 you -0.083\nday 0.233 get -0.077 tried 0.221 we -0.073 im 0.212 need -0.072\nalive 0.194 your -0.071 tried to 0.191 he -0.070\nfeel 0.187 be -0.068 my 0.185 girl -0.068 commit 0.185 boyfriend -0.068 last 0.168 bitch -0.066 so 0.167 always -0.065\nrather 0.165 soldier -0.065 my depression 0.161 are -0.061\nagain 0.156 need to -0.061 everything 0.148 williams -0.060\nand propose solutions to improve public awareness and understanding of suicide so that we could rely more on crowdsourcing platforms to reduce the overall annotation costs.

Due in large part to the fuzzy nature of what constitutes suicidal risks, most supervised approaches for learning to automatically detect suicide-related activity in social media require a great deal of human labor to train. However, humans themselves have diverse or conflicting views on what constitutes suicidal thoughts. So how to obtain reliable gold standard labels is fundamentally challenging and, we hypothesize, depends largely on what is asked of the annotators and what slice of the data they label. We conducted multiple rounds of data labeling and collected annotations from crowdsourcing workers and domain experts. We aggregated the resulting labels in various ways to train a series of supervised models. Our preliminary evaluations show that using unanimously agreed labels from multiple annotators is helpful to achieve robust machine models.",
