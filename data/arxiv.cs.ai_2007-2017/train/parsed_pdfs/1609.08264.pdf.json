      "text" : "Recommender systems have become increasingly indispensable in many applications [1]. Collaborative filtering (CF) based methods are a fundamental building block in many recommender systems. CF based recommender systems predict the ratings of items to be given by a user based on the ratings of the items previously rated by other users who are most similar to the target user.\nCF based methods can be classified into memory-based methods [21] and model-based methods [14, 15]. The former includes two popular methods, user-oriented [9] and item-oriented, e.g., ItemKNN [6], depending on whether the\nACM ISBN 978-1-4503-2138-9.\nDOI: 10.1145/1235\nneighborhood information is derived from similar users or items. First they compute similarities between the active item and other items, or between the active user and other users. Then they predict the unknown rating by combining the known rating of top k neighbors. Due to the simplicity of memory-based CF, it has been successfully applied in industry. However, it suffers from several problems, including data sparsity, cold start and data correlation [3], as users typically rate only a small portion of the available items, and they also tend to rate similar items closely. Therefore, the similarities between users or items cannot be accurately obtained with the existing similarity measures such as cosine and Pearson correlation, which in turn compromises the recommendation accuracy.\nTo alleviate the problems of memory-based methods, many model-based methods have been proposed, which use observed ratings to learn a predictive model. Among them, matrix factorization (MF) based models, e.g., PureSVD [5] and weighted regularized MF (WRMF) [10], are very popular due to their capability of capturing the implicit relationships among items and their outstanding performance. Nevertheless, it introduces high computational complexity and also faces the problem of uninterpretable recommendations. Because the rating matrix is sparse, the factorization of the user-item matrix may lead to inferior solutions [7]. By learning an aggregation coefficient matrix [13], recently, sparse linear method (SLIM) [17] has been proposed and shown to be effective. However, it just captures relations between items that have been co-purchased/co-rated by at least one user [12]. Moreover, it only explores the linear relations between items. Another class of methods use Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) criterion to measure the difference between the rankings of user-purchased items and the remaining items. For instance, BPRMF and BPRKNN [19] have been demonstrated to be effective for implicit feedback datasets.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Top-N recommendation model based on graphs. This method not only takes into account the neighborhood information, which is encoded by our user graph and item graph, but also reveals hidden structure in the data by deploying graph regularization. In the real world, data often reside on low-dimensional manifolds embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. Like the Netflix Prize problem, where the size of the user-item matrix can be huge, there exist relationships between users (such as their age, hobbies, education, etc.) and movies (such as their genre, release year, actors, origin country, etc.). Moreover, people sharing the same tastes for a class of movies\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n08 26\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 2\n7 Se\np 20\n16\nare likely to rate them similarly. As a result, the rows and columns of the user-item matrix possess important structural information, which should be taken advantage of in actual applications.\nTo preserve local geometric and discriminating structures embedded in a high-dimensional space, numerous manifold learning methods, such as locally linear embedding (LLE) [20], locality preserving projection (LPP) [18], have been proposed. In recent years, graph regularization based nonnegative matrix factorization [4] of data representation has been developed to remedy the failure in representing geometric structures in data. Inspired by this observation, to comprehensively consider the associations between the users and items and the local manifold structures of the user-item data space, we propose to apply both user and item graph regularizations. Unlike many existing recommendation algorithms, we first establish a new representation which is infused with the above information. It turns out that this new representation is not sparse anymore. Therefore, we perform recommendation task with this novel representation."

      "text" : "User-item rating matrix is an overfit representation of user tastes and item descriptions. This leads to problems of synonymy, computational complexity, and potentially poorer results. Therefore, a more compact representation of user tastes and item descriptions is preferred. Graph regularization is effective in preserving local geometric and discriminating structures embedded in a high-dimensional space. It is based on the well known manifold assumption [18]: If two data points such as xi and xj are close in the geodesic distance on the data manifold, then their corresponding representations yi and yj are also close to each other. In practice, it is difficult to accurately estimate the global manifold structure of the data due to the insufficient number of samples and the high dimensionality of the ambient space. Therefore, many methods resort to local manifold structures. Much effort on manifold learning [18] has shown that local geometric structures of the data manifold can be effectively modeled through a nearest neighbor graph on sampled data points.\nWe adopt graph regularization to incorporate user and item proximities. In this paper, we construct two graphs: the user graph and the item graph. We assume that users having similar tastes for items form communities in the user graph, while items having similar appeals to users form com-\nmunities in the item graph. Since “birds of a feather flock together”, this assumption is plausible and turns out to indeed benefit recommender systems substantially in our experiment results. As an example for movie recommendation, the users are the vertices of a“social graph”whose edges represent relations induced by similar tastes.\nMore formally, we construct an undirected weighted graph Gc = (Vc, Ec;Sc) on items, called the item graph. The vertex set Vc corresponds to items {t1, · · · , tn} with each node ti corresponding to a data point xi which is the i-th column ofX. Symmetric adjacency matrix Sc encodes the inter-item information, in which sij is the weight of the edge joining vertices ti and tj and represents how strong the relationship or similarity items ti and tj have. Ec = {eij} is the edge set with each edge eij between nodes ti and tj associated with a weight sij . The graph regularization on the item graph is formulated as\n1\n2 n∑ i,j=1 ‖yi − yj‖22sij = n∑ i=1 y T i yidii − n∑ i,j=1 y T i yjsij\n=Tr(Y DcY T )− Tr(Y ScY T ) = Tr(Y LcY T ),\n(1)\nwhereDc is a diagonal matrix with dii = ∑n\nj=1 sij , and Lc = Dc − Sc is the graph Laplacian. To preserve the structural information of the manifold, we want (1) to be as small as possible. It is apparent that minimizing (1) imposes the smoothness of the representation coefficients; i.e., if items ti and tj are similar (with a relatively bigger sij), their lowdimensional representations yi and yj are also close to each other. Therefore, optimizing (1) is an attempt to ensure the manifold assumption.\nThe crucial part of graph regularization is the definition of the adjacency matrix Sc. There exist a number of different similarity metrics in the literature [21], e.g., cosine similarity, Pearson correlation coefficient, and adjusted cosine similarity. For simplicity, in our experiment, we use cosine similarity for explicit rating datasets and Jaccard coefficient for implicit feedback datesets. For binary variables, the Jaccard coefficient is a more appropriate similarity metric than cosine because it is insensitive to the amplitudes of ratings. It measures the fraction of users who have interactions with both items over the number of users who have interacted either of them. Formally, according to cosine definition, the similarity sij between two items ti and tj is defined as sij =\nxi·xj ‖xi‖2‖xj‖2\n, where ‘·’ denotes the vector dot-product operation. For Jaccard coefficient, sij = |xi∩xj | |xi∪xj |\n, where ∩ and ∪ represent intersection and union operations, respectively. Likewise, by defining the user graph Gr = (Vr, Er;Sr) whose vertex set Vr corresponds to users {u1, · · · , um}, we get a corresponding expression Tr(Y TLrY ). Here Lr denotes the Laplacian of Gr, which is similarly obtained from the data points corresponding to the users, that is, the rows of X."

(2)\nThe first term of (2) penalizes large deviations of the predictions from the given ratings. The last two terms measure the smoothness of the predicted ratings on the graph structures and encourage the ratings of nodes with affinity to be similar. They can alleviate the data sparsity issue to some extent. When the item neighborhood information is not\navailable, user neighborhood information might exist, vice versa. The parameters α and β adjust the balance between the reconstruction error and graph regularizations.\nBy setting the derivative of the objective function of (2) with respect to Y to zero, we have\n(βLr + I)Y + αY Lc = X. (3)\nEquation (3) is the well known Sylvester equation, which costs O(m3) or O(n3) with a general solver. But in our situation, X is usually extremely sparse, and Lr and Lc can also be sparse, especially for large m and n, so the cost can be O(m2) or O(n2), or sometimes even as low as O(m) or O(n) [2]. Many packages or programs are available to solve (3).\nTo use the reconstructed matrix Y to make recommendations for user ui, we just sort ui’s non-purchased/non-rated items based on their scores in non-increasing order and recommend the top N items."

      "text" : "To the best of our knowledge, there are very few studies on graph Laplacian in the context of recommendation task. Graph regularized weighted nonnegative matrix factorization (GWNMF) [7] was proposed to incorporate the neighborhood information in a MF approach. It solves the following problem\nmin U,V ‖M (X − UV T )‖2F + αTr(U T LrU) + βTr(V T LcV ) s.t. U ≥ 0, V ≥ 0, (4)\nwhere M is an indicator matrix. U and V T are in latent spaces, whose dimensionality is usually specified with an additional parameter. The latent factors are generally not obvious and might not necessarily be interpretable or intuitively understandable. Here (4) has to learn both user and item representations in the latent spaces. In our approach, we just need to learn one representation and thus the learning process is simplified. On the other hand, U and V T are supposed to be of low dimensionality, and thus useful information can be lost during the low-rank approximation of X from U and V T . The encoding of graph Laplacian on U and V T might be not accurate any more. On the contrary, our method can better preserve the information in X, so it can potentially give better recommendations than GWNMF. Moreover, it is well known that several drawbacks exist in the MF approach, e.g., low convergence rate, many local optimums of U and V T due to the non-convexity of (4). In contrast, our model (2) is strongly convex, admitting a unique, globally optimal solution."

      "text" : "For fair comparison, we follow the dataset preparation approach used by SLIM [17] and adopt the 5-fold cross validation. For each fold, a dataset is split into training and test sets by randomly selecting one non-zero entry for each user and putting it in the test set, while using the rest of the data for training. Then a ranked list of size-N items for each user is produced. We subsequently evaluate the method by comparing the ranked list of recommended items with the item in the test set. In the following results presented in this paper, N is equal to 10 by default.\nFor Top-N recommendation, the most direct and meaningful metrics are hit-rate (HR) and the average reciprocal hit-rank (ARHR) [6], since the users only care if a short recommendation list contains the items of interest or not rather than a very long recommendation list. HR is defined as HR = #hits\n#users , where #hits is the number of users\nwhose item in the testing set is contained (i.e., hit) in the size-N recommendation list, and #users is the total number of users. ARHR is defined as: ARHR = 1\n#users ∑#hits i=1 1 pi ,\nwhere pi is the position of the i-th hit in the ranked Top-N list. In this metric, hits that occur earlier in the ranked list are weighted higher than those occur later, and thus ARHR indicates how strongly an item is recommended."

As can be seen from all figures, our algorithm performs well over a wide range of α and β values. HR and ARHR share the same trend with varying α and β. Specifically, when α is small, HR and ARHR both increase with α. After a certain point, they begin to decrease. For FilmTrust, the performance with β = 0.01 is very stable with respect to α.

For those 1.14% non-zero entries in X, X̂SLIM recovers 99.69% of them and their mean value is 1.686. In contrast, the reconstructed matrix by our proposed algorithm has a density of 91.7%. For those 1.14% non-zero entries in X, our method recovers all of them with a mean of 2.975. These facts suggest that our method better recovers X than SLIM. In other words, SLIM loses too much information. This appears to explain the superior performance of our method.\nIn fact, above analysis is equivalent to the two widely used prediction accuracy metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Since our method can recover the original ratings much better than SLIM, our algorithm gives lower MAE and RMSE. This conclusion is consistent with our HR and ARHR evaluation.\nTable 4: Results by using different graphs\nUser Graph Item Graph User-Item Graph FilmTrust 0.638 0.625 0.651\nYahoo 0.303 0.379 0.379"

In many recommendation algorithms, the similarity computation is crucial to the recommendation quality [8]. To demonstrate the importance of similarity metric, we use the cosine measure rather than the Jaccard coefficient to measure the similarity in binary datasets. We compare the results in Table 3. As demonstrated, for lastfm dataset, HR and ARHR increase after we adopt the cosine similarity. However, for Delicious and BX dataset, the Jaccard coefficient works better. Therefore, the difference of final results can be big for certain datasets with different similarity measures. We expect that the experimental results in Table 2 can be further enhanced if one performs a more careful analysis of Lr and Lc. For example, it has been reported that normalizing the similarity scores can improve the performance [6]. Also, a number of new similarity metrics have recently been proposed, e.g., [16], which may be also exploited.\nAnother important parameter is the neighborhood size k, which cannot be known a priori [11]. For some small datasets, setting a small k may not include all useful neighbors and would infer incomplete relationships. In practice, a large number of ratings from similar users or similar items are not available, due to the sparsity inherent to rating data. We just use the fully connected graph in our experiments. To demonstrate this, we test the effects of neighborhood size k with values {10, 50, 200, 500, 800} on FilmTrust data. As can be seen from Figure 3, the neighborhood size indeed influences the performance of our proposed recommendation method. Specifically, the performance keeps increasing as k increases when k is small compared to the size of dataset, then the performance keeps almost the same as the final accuracy obtained in Table 2 as k it becomes larger. This conforms that a small neighborhood size can not capture all similarity information."

We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments and compare our method with other state-of-the-art Top-N recommendation algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm works effectively. Due to the simplicity of our model, there is much room to improve. For instance, our model can be easily extended to include side information (e.g., user demographic information, item’s genre, social trust network) by utilizing the graph representation. In some cases, external information is more informative than the neighborhood information."

Collaborative filtering algorithms that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a simple recommendation algorithm that fully exploits the similarity information among users and items and intrinsic structural information of the user-item matrix. The proposed method constructs a new representation which preserves affinity and structure information in the user-item rating matrix and then performs recommendation task. To capture proximity information about users and items, two graphs are constructed. Manifold learning idea is used to constrain the new representation to be smooth on these graphs, so as to enforce users and item proximities. Our model is formulated as a convex optimization problem, for which we need to solve the well known Sylvester equation only. We carry out extensive empirical evaluations on six benchmark datasets to show the effectiveness of this approach.",
