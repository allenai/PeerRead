{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "End-to-End Answer Chunk Extraction and Ranking for Reading Comprehension", "abstract": "This paper proposes dynamic chunk reader (DCR), an end-to-end neural reading comprehension (RC) model that is able to extract and rank a set of answer candidates from a given document to answer questions. DCR is able to predict answers of variable lengths, whereas previous neural RC models primarily focused on predicting single tokens or entities. DCR encodes a document and an input question with recurrent neural networks, and then applies a word-by-word attention mechanism to acquire question-aware representations for the document, followed by the generation of chunk representations and a ranking module to propose the top-ranked chunk as the answer. Experimental results show that DCR could achieve a 66.3% Exact match and 74.7% F1 score on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "SYNOPSIS: The paper proposes a new neural network-based model for reading comprehension (reading a passage of text and answering questions based on the passage). It is similar in spirit to several other recent models, with the main exception that it is able to predict answers of different lengths, as opposed to single words/tokens/entities. The authors compare their model on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), and show improvements over the baselines, while apparently lagging quite far behind the current state of the art reported on the SQuAD leaderboard.\n\nTHOUGHTS: The main novelty of the method is to be able to identify phrases of different lengths as possible answers to the question. However, both approaches considered -- using a POS pattern trie tree to filter out word sequences with POS tags matching those of answers in the training set, and brute-force enumeration of all phrases up to length N -- seem somewhat orthogonal to the idea of \"learning end-to-end \" an answer chunk extraction model. Furthermore, as other reviews have pointed out, it seems that the linguistic features actually contribute a lot to the final accuracy (Table 3). One could argue that these are easy to obtain using standard taggers, but it takes away even more from the idea of an \"end-to-end trained\" system.\n\nThe paper is generally well written, but there are several crucial sections in parts describing the model where it was really hard for me to follow the descriptions. In particular, the attention mechanism seems fairly standard to me in a seq2seq sense (i.e. there is nothing architecturally novel about it, as is for instance the case with the Gated Attentive Reader). I may be missing something, but even after the clarification round I still don't understand how it is novel compared to standard attention used in for instance seq2seq models.\n\nFinally, although the method is shown to outperform the baseline method reported in the original paper introducing the SQuAD dataset, it currently seems to be 12th (out of 15 systems) on the leaderboard (", "IS_META_REVIEW": true}, {"TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 pcs", "comments": "The program committee appreciates the authors' response to the clarification questions and one review.

Compared to earlier systems, the proposed model is able to extract and rank a set of answer candidates from a given document.\n\nThere are many recent models focusing on building good question answering systems by extracting phrases from a given article. It seems that there are two different aspects that are unique in this work:\n\n1.\tThe use of convolution model, and\n2.\tDynamic chunking\n\nConvolution network is often only used for modeling character-based word embeddings so I am curious about its effectiveness on representing phrases. Therefore, I wish there could be more analysis on how effective it is, as the authors do not compare the convolution framework to other alternative approaches such as LSTM. The comparisons are important, as the authors uses uni-gram, bi-gram and tri-gram information in the convolution network, and it is not clear to me that if tri-gram information is still needed for LSTM models.\n\nThe dynamic chunking is a good idea, and a very similar idea is proposed in some of the recent papers such as [Kenton et al, 16], which also targets at the same dataset. However, I would like to see more analysis on the dynamic chunking. Why this approach is a good approach for representing answer chunks? Given the representation of the chunk is constructed by the first and the end word representations generated by a convolution network, I am not sure about the ability of this representation to capture the long answer phrases.\n\nThe authors do not use character base embedding but use some of the previous trained NLP models. It would be interesting if the authors could show what are the advantages and disadvantages of using linguistic features compared to character embeddings.\n\nIn short, there are several good ideas proposed in the paper, but the lack of proper analysis make it difficult to judge how important the proposed techniques are.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 5, "DATE": "16 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 3}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "No Title", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "SUMMARY.\nThe paper propose a reading-comprehension question answering system for the recent QA task where answers of a question can be either single tokens or spans in the given text passage.\nThe model first encodes the passage and the query using a recurrent neural network.\nWith an attention mechanism the model calculates the importance of each word on the passage with respect to each word in the question.\nThe encoded words in the passage are concatenated with the attention; the resulting vector is re-encoded with a further RNN.\nThree convolutional neural networks with different filter size (1,2,3-gram) are used to further capture local features.\nCandidate answers are selected either matching POS patterns of answers in the training set or choosing all possible text span until a certain length.\nEach candidate answer has three representations, one for each n-gram representation. The compatibility of these representation with the question representation is then calculated.\nThe scores are combined linearly and used for calculating the probability of the candidate answer being the right answer for the question.\n\nThe method is tested on the SQUAD dataset and outperforms the proposed baselines.\n\n----------\n\nOVERALL JUDGMENT\nThe method presented in this paper is interesting but not very motivated in some points.\nFor example, it is not explained why in the attention mechanism it is beneficial to concatenate the original passage encoding with the attention-weighted ones.\nThe contributions of the paper are moderately novel proposing mainly the attention mechanism and the convolutional re-encoding.\nIn fact, combining questions and passages and score their compatibility has became a fairly standard procedure in all QA models.\n\n----------\n\nDETAILED COMMENTS\n\nEquation (13) i should be s, not s^l.\n\nI still do not understand the sentence \" the best function is to concatenate the hidden stat of the fist word in a chunk in forward RNN and that of the last word in backward RNN\".
