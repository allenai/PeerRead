      "text" : "Early work on probabilistic theories of pairwise choice yielded simple and widely adopted models such as Thurstone’s Case V model [28] and the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model [8]. Both of these models make strong assumptions, the most obvious being that they both assume strict stochastic transitivity between alternatives: if pxy is the probability of choosing x over y among pairs {x, y} in a universe U , then pab ≥ 0.5 and pbc ≥ 0.5 imply pac ≥ max(pab, pbc). Strict stochastic transitivity thus implies a total ordering on U , a strong statement about choice preferences.\nThe most storied assumption in choice theory, however, is arguably Luce’s choice axiom [17], popularly known as the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). The axiom consists of two statements: (i) if a, b ∈ S and pab = 0, then it follows that Pr(a chosen from S) = 0 for all S containing b, and (ii) the probability that a is chosen from U conditioned on the chosen item lying in S ⊆ U is precisely the probability that a is chosen from S [18]. The Bradley-Terry-Luce model for pairwise choice, where pij = γi/(γi + γj) for latent quality parameters γi ≥ 0, became popular after the introduction of the choice axiom: it satisfies the axiom, while Thurstone’s Case V model does not [1] even though it is transitive.\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n02 74\n0v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n8 M\nar 2\nGeneralizing discrete choice from pairs to larger sets, the Bradley-Terry-Luce model was soon extended; the pairwise binomial logit in the model was generalized to a multinomial logit [4]. The resulting Multinomal Logit (MNL) model again has quality parameters γi ≥ 0 for each i ∈ U , and defines piS , the probability of choosing i from S ⊆ U , as piS ∝ γi for all i ∈ S. The MNL model, sometimes also called the Plackett-Luce model, continues to satisfy Luce’s choice axiom.\nLuce and others have noted that the choice axiom and stochastic transitivity are strong assumptions that do not hold for empirical choice data [10, 13, 26, 14, 29]. Meanwhile, the success of the MNL model of discrete choice under the choice axiom can be understood as a shining example of Box’s mantra “all models are wrong but some are useful” [6]. A proliferation of discrete choice models striving to escape the confines of the choice axiom have emerged over the years. The most popular of these models have been the Elimination by Aspects [30], mixed MNL [7], and nested MNL models [22]. All of these models, however, exhibit some shortcoming in their rigidity or inferential tractability: Elimination by aspects and mixed MNL both exhibit the property of regularity, defined below, while inference is difficult in all three cases [23, 16].\nWith this proliferation of models came an important categorization, the random utility model (RUM) framework [4, 20]. A model is a RUM if there exist real-valued random variables Xa, for all a ∈ U , such that Pr(a chosen from S) = Pr(Xa ≥ Xb,∀b ∈ S), for all S ⊆ U . A model is an independent RUM if there exist Xa that are all independent. RUMs in general assume regularity but do not necessarily assume the choice axiom or assume stochastic transitivity (consider distributions such as those for non-transitive dice [25, 27]). Thurstone’s Case V model and the BTL model are both independent RUMs, the mixed MNL model and the Elimination by Aspects model are both RUMs, while the nested MNL model is not a RUM. A major result by McFadden and Train showed that for any RUM there exists a mixed MNL model that can approximate the choice probabilities of that RUM to within an arbitrary error [23], a strong result about the generality of mixed MNL models.\nWhen considering models circumventing the choice axiom, a weaker property called regularity often holds: for any choice setsA,C whereA ⊆ C, Pr(x chosen from A) ≥ Pr(x chosen from C). For example, all RUMs exhibit regularity, even if they don’t exhibit the choice axiom. Regularity, though intuitively pleasing, has its drawbacks empirically: it does not describe contexts that features framing effects [13] such as asymmetric dominance. Framing effects and other observations from modern behavior economics motivate us to contribute a new model of discrete choice that escapes historically common assumptions while still furnishing enough structure to be inferentially tractable.\nThe present work. In this work we introduce a simple, inferentially tractable model of discrete choice that we call the Pairwise Choice Markov Chain (PCMC) model. The PCMC model is based on an underlying continuous time Markov chain over a universe U that transitions between alternatives with rates that are determined by pairwise choice probabilities. The model views a selection probability piS as the probability mass on alternative i ∈ S of the stationary distribution of a continuous time Markov\nchain on the set of alternatives S with transition rates parameterized by a matrix P. We show in this work that the parameter matrix P is interpretable as the matrix of pairwise selection probabilities, and as such the PCMC model can be thought of as defining set-wise selection probabilities strictly in terms of pairwise selection probabilities. One of the strengths of the PCMC model is that this matrix can be parameterized further by arbitrary models of pairwise choice. Indeed, we show that when the matrix P is parameterized as the pairwise selection probabilities of a BTL pairwise model, the PCMC model reduces to an MNL model. We also study a parameterization in terms of the recently introduced Blade-Chest models of intransitive pairwise choices [9]. The Blade-Chest models parameterize arbitrary non-transitive pairwise choice probabilities in terms of “blades” and “chests,” motivated by a sword dueling metaphor. By parameterizing P in terms of the Blade-Chest model parameters, we achieve a reduction from( n 2 ) parameters to 2dn parameters, where d is the dimension of the blade and chest embeddings. The PCMC model can be thought of as building upon the observation underlying the recently introduced Iterative Luce Spectral Ranking (I-LSR) procedure for efficiently finding the maximum likelihood estimate for parameters of MNL models [21]. The analysis of I-LSR is precisely analyzing a PCMC model in the special case where the matrix P has been parameterized by BTL. In that case the stationary distribution of the chain is found to match the stationary conditions of the MNL likelihood function, establishing a deep connection between MNL models and Markov chains. The PCMC model generalizes that connection.\nThe analysis of I-LSR is one of several recent works to realize connections between the MNL model and Markov chains. Other recent connections have been made by the work on RankCentrality [24], which employs a discrete time Markov chain for inference in the place of I-LSR’s continuous time chain. Separate work by Blanchet et al., also based on discrete time Markov chains, contributes a Markov chain-based choice model that is capable of approximating any RUM [3].\nThe PCMC model is not a RUM, and in general does not exhibit stochastic transitivity, regularity, or obey the choice axiom. We find that the PCMC model does, however, obey the lesser known but fundamental axiom of uniform expansion. The axiom of uniform expansion was proposed by Yellott as a weakened version of Luce’s choice axiom that implies the choice axiom within the context of independent RUMs [31]. In this work we define a convenient structural property termed contractibility, for which uniform expansion is a special case, and we show that the PCMC model exhibits contractibility. Of the above mentioned models, Elimination by Aspects is the only other model that is not an independent RUM but obeys uniform expansion. Meanwhile, recall that Elimination by Aspects obeys regularity, which the PCMC model does not: as such, the PCMC model we introduce is uniquely positioned in the literature of axiomatic models of discrete choice, minimally satisfying uniform expansion without the other aforementioned axioms.\nLastly, after presenting the model and its properties, in Section 4 we evaluate our inference performance on several synthetic datasets, under several parameterizations of the pairwise matrix P ."

The transition rates of the chain are given as a simple function of a parameter matrix P that is interpretable as a matrix of pairwise selection probabilities.\nFormally, given S ⊆ U we construct rate matrix QS = {qij}i,j∈S as follows:\nqij = pji, i 6= j, qii = − ∑ j 6=i qij .\nLet πS be the stationary distribution of the corresponding CTMC on S. We define piS := πS(i), and also occasionally abuse notation to write πS(A) = ∑ x∈A πS(x) when the intention is clear. In a final additional abuse of notation, when |S| = 2 we write pij instead of piS or pi{i,j}. This abuse is motivated in the next section, where we show that the matrix of parameters P are indeed the selection probabilities for pair sets under the PCMC model as defined above.\nWe now show that the PCMC model is well defined.\nClaim 1. The choice probabilities piS are well defined for all i in any subset S ⊆ U of a finite U .\nProof. We will show that there exists a single closed communicating class which implies a unique stationary distribution. A closed communicating class C is a subset of S such that the chain will never leave C once entering it, and each state in C is reachable from every other state in C.\nBecause S is finite, there must be at least one closed communicating class. Suppose the chain had more than one closed communicating class and that i ∈ S and j ∈ S were in different closed communicating classes. But pij + pji = 1, so at least one of qji and qij is strictly positive. But then the chain can switch communicating classes through the positive edge, a contradiction.\nNote that the support of πS is the closed communicating class, but S may have transient states corresponding to alternatives with a selection probability of zero.\nIn the subsections that follow, we show that pairwise choice probabilities under the PCMC model are precisely the entries of the parameter matrix P . We also show and that a PCMC model does not exhibit regularity in general, nor is it a random utility model. We then show that a PCMC model with pairwise probabilities originating from a Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) pairwise model is equivalent to a Multinomial Logit (MNL) set-wise model, and that the PCMC model can be used as a wrapper around more flexible models of pairwise choice, such as non-transitive Blade-Chest models."

When pij ∈ (0, 1), then the unique stationary distribution πS satisfying πSQS = 0 subject to ||πS ||1 = 1 will have\nπS(j)qji = πS(i)qij ,\nπS(i) + πS(j) = 1.\nThese equations yield πS(i) = pij , πS(j) = pji. The corner cases where pij = 0 or 1 have the dominating state as absorbing, also yielding agreement with π.\nWe conclude that the PCMC model is consistent with input pairwise probabilities when asked to output probabilities on sets of size two. For sets of size greater than two, we can think of the PCMC model as parameterizing choice probabilities on a set S entirely in terms of the pairwise probabilities between pairs of alternatives within S."

Formally, paS′ ≥ paS for S′ ⊆ S. We will now show that the PCMC model is not constrained to exhibit regularity, nor is it a random utility model (RUM) in general.\nConsider U = {r, p, s} corresponding to a rock-paper-scissors-like game, in the sense that\nP =  0 1− α αα 0 1− α 1− α α 0  for some α ∈ [0, 1], where the rows of P are indexed by r, p, and s respectively. For any pair set we have pij = α if i beats j in rock paper scissors. Meanwhile, the choices on the full triplet U gives π = ( 13 , 1 3 , 1 3 ), regardless of α. Thus, regularity does not hold for α ∈ [0, 13 ) or α ∈ ( 2 3 , 1].\nThis example further illustrates why the PCMC model is not a RUM. By setting α = 1, there can not exist real-valued random variablesX1,X2,X3 such that Pr(X1 > X2) = 1, Pr(X2 > X3) = 1, and Pr(X3 > X1) > 0.\nBy a theorem describing non-transitive dice [27], it is also clear that many more PCMC models can not be independent RUMs: the Steinhaus-Trybula theorem says that for any real-valued independent random variables X1, X2, X3, it must be the case that mini,j Pr(Xi > Xj) ≤ 23 . As a result, a necessary condition for a rock-paper-scissors instance to be an independent RUM is that α ∈ [ 13 , 2 3 ], agreeing with the condition above for regularity. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions on P for a PCMC model to be a RUM, analogous to known characterization theorems for RUMs [11] and known sufficient\nconditions for nested MNL models to be RUMs [5], is an interesting open research challenge.\nThe PCMC model’s lack of regularity is a positive trait in the sense that empirical choice phenomena such as framing effects and asymmetric dominance violate regularity [13], and the PCMC model is rare in its ability to model such choices."

If the pairwise probabilities P are generated from a BTL model with parameters γ, then for each S ⊆ U , the PCMC probabilities piS are consistent with an MNL model on S with parameters γ.\nProof. Let the PCMC rate matrix QS be constructed from a matrix of pairwise probabilities P generated from a BTL model with parameters γ. We aim to show that πS =\nγ ||γ||1 is a stationary distribution of the PCMC chain: π T SQS = 0.

Thus πS is always the stationary distribution of the chain, and we know by Claim 1 that it is unique. It follows that piS ∝ γi for all i ∈ S, as desired.\nThe observation in this subsection also explains why the recently introduced Iterative Luce Spectral Ranking (I-LSR) procedure succeeds in inferring the parameters of an MNL model from the stationary distribution of an appropriately constructed continuous-time Markov chain. If the choice data being subjected to inference is pairwise, the chain that the I-LSR procedure constructs is precisely a PCMC chain with P parameterized by iteratively inferred BTL pairwise choice probabilities."

The Blade-Chest model comes in two variations: the Blade-Chest distance model, where\npij(b, c, γ) = S(||bi − cj ||22 − ||bj − ci||22 + γi − γj),\nwhere S(x) = (1+exp(−x))−1 is the sigmoid/logistic function, and the Blade-Chest inner product model, where\npij(b, c, γ) = S(bi · cj − bj · ci + γi − γj).\nThe quality parameters γi serve to connect the models to the BTL model, but do not meaningfully increase their expressiveness, so we disregard them in our use of the Blade-Chest distance model in this work. Thus, these two Blade-Chest models provide useful parameterizations of non-transitive pairwise probability matrices, P (Θ), with Θ = {b, c} consisting of the 2dn parameters of the blade and chest embeddings.\nAnother technique for parametrizing P involves representing pij as a function of features of i and j, i.e. pij = f(Xi, Xj ; Θ) where Xi gives the salient features of i, and Θ represents parameters that, for instance, give weights to these features. We can also formulate such analysis as a factoring P = WTF whereW is a weight matrix and F a feature matrix. We do not explore such parameterizations in this work, but merely highlight the potential to employ latent features of objects, an approach closely related to conjoint analysis [12], in a straight-forward manner."

      "text" : "Yellott [31] introduced uniform expansion as a weaker condition than Luce’s choice axiom, but one that implies the choice axiom in the context of any independent random utility model. Consider a choice between n elements in a set S, and another choice from a set containing k identical copies of each of the n elements. The axiom of invariance with uniform expansion states that the probability of choosing each object from the set S are the same as the probability of choosing some copy of each object type from the uniformly expanded set.\nYellott demonstrated that for any independent random utility model, the doubleexponential distribution family is the only family of independent distributions that exhibit uniform expansion, and that Thurstone’s model in particular does not exhibit uniform expansion. We now also give a formal definition.\nDefinition 1. For x, y in S ⊆ U , we say that x and y are copies if for all z ∈ S−x−y, pxz = pyz\nDefinition 2. Consider X ⊆ U and Sk = {k · x}x∈X containing k copies of each element of X , where for each xi we denote x1i , . . . , x k i as the copies. We say that a model satisfies uniform expansion if for all X and all k ≥ 1:\npxiX = k∑ j=1 pxjiSk ,\nso that the probability of choosing a copy of x from S is the same as the probability of choosing x from X .\nTo build intuition: consider offering a person 100 identical coffees, 100 identical teas, and 100 identical glasses of milk. Uniform expansion contends that the proportional selection probabilities of each type of drink should be the same as if they were offered just one drink of each type.\nWhile the axiom feels natural as a model for discrete choice, it should be regarded with some skepticism in applications that model competitions. For example, in sports matches or races, the winner of the competition can be modeled as the competitor with highest skill on that day; competitions are often modeled using random utility models. If we have a competitor with a skill distribution whose wins come from occasional “good days” — their skill distribution has a heavy upper tail — then uniform expansion should not hold, and is not a desirable axiom. This example relates to recent work on team performance and selection [15], where non-invariance under uniform expansion plays a key role.\nWe now show that the PCMC model exhibits uniform expansion.\nClaim 3. The PCMC model exhibits uniform expansion for all matrices P .\nProof. Let πX be the stationary distribution corresponding to the PCMC model on X . Then we can index the matrix QS so that it is a k × k grid of copies of QX :\nQS =  QX QX . . . QX QX QX . . . QX ... ... ... ...\nQX QX . . . QX  . For πS similarly indexed with k copies of πX , i.e.:\nπTS = [π T X π T X . . . π T X ],\nwe have that πS is the stationary distribution of QS . Because πX is the stationary distribution of QX :\n(πTSQS)i = k∑ j=1 πTXQX = 0.\nIt follows that πS||πS || = πS k gives pxjiS = 1 kpxiX for each xi, for all j. Summing over j gives the desired result for any xi ∈ X .\nTversky’s Elimination by Aspects model [30] is typically defined for choice sets consisting of distinct elements, but can easily be modified to handle copies of elements. it is clear to see that any reasonable way to handle copies in Tversky’s model would satisfy uniform expansion. Thus the PCMC model is not unique in being a nonindependent RUM that satisfies uniform expansion, although Elimination by Aspects comes with the added structure of regularity."

We will call these options B1, B2, and D respectively. When compared to D, Debreau argues that B1 and B2 are indistinguishable in the sense that pDB1 = pDB2 . However, an agent can reasonably prefer B1 over B2 in the sense that pB1B2 > 0.5.\nDebreu’s thought experiment appeared in the context of a book review of Luce’s first monograph on the choice axiom, and the thought experiment is intended to show a weakness of the BTL model: pDB1 = pDB2 implies that γB1 = γB2 , in turn implying that pB1B2 = 0.5, so the above choice can not be encoded by any model that employs Luce’s axiom. Debreu’s construction is also closely related to the “Paris and Rome” thought experiment we dissect in Section 3.3.\nWe introduce a notion of contractable partitions that addresses a generalization of the above thought experiments involving choices between near-copies.\nDefinition 3. A partition A1, . . . , Ak of U is a contractible partition if |Ai| ≥ 1,∀i and paiaj = λij for all ai ∈ Ai, aj ∈ Aj for some Λ = {λij} for i, j ∈ {1, . . . , k}.\nWe will now show that when a PCMC model contains a contractible partition, the relative probabilities of selecting from those partitions, π(Ai), are indifferent to the pairwise probabilities within any partition, and depend only on the inter-partition probabilities Λ. Thus, our contractable partition definition can be viewed as akin to (but distinct from) nests in nested MNL models [22].\nClaim 4. For a given Λ, letA1, . . . , Ak on U be a contractible partition for two PCMC models represented by P, P ′ with stationary distributions π, π′. Then for any Ai:∑\nj∈Ai pjU = ∑ j∈Ai p′jU , (1)\nor equivalently, π(Ai) = π′(Ai).\nProof. SupposeP has contractible partitionA1, . . . , Ak with respect to Λ. Then πTQU = 0 gives for x ∈ A1 WLOG,\nπ(x)  ∑ y∈A1\\x qxy + k∑ i=2 ∑ ai∈Ai qxai  = ∑ y∈A1\\x π(y)qyx + k∑ i=2 ∑ ai∈Ai π(ai)qaix.

Ak) with transition rates γij = |Aj |λji. Since the partition contains no empty sets, we can use λij + λji = 1 to show that the induced chain has a unique closed communicating class (as in the proof of Claim 1). We conclude that {π(Ai)} are all fixed if A1, ..., Ak is a contractible partition, regardless of any differences between P and P ′ on matrix elements within partitions.\nWe say that a choice model exhibits contractibility if, for any two sets of pairwise choice probabilities P and P ′ such that A1, . . . , Ak is a contractible partition with respect to the same Λ for both P and P ′, then equation (1) holds.\nNote that every PCMC model on n elements contains a trivial contractible partition A1 = {x1}, ..., An = {xn}, but it is an interesting open question wether one could parameterize P directly in terms of contractible partitions. Note that the fact that any PCMC model exhibits uniform expansion is a simple corollary of contractibility."

The idea is that the choice between Paris and Paris* should clearly be Paris*, but Paris and Paris* should individually compare to Rome the same.

This analysis holds regardless of the probabilities with which Paris beats Paris*, Rome beats Rome*, or Paris beats Rome, and clearly generalizes to similar constructions with more variants and for more cities.\nFor α = 0.5, the corresponding PCMC choice probabilities are π = ( 18 , 3 8 , 1 8 , 3 8 ). These probabilities indeed capture the dominance of Paris* and Rome* over their counterparts, but do not preclude Paris or Rome from selection. However, as α ↘ 0, π → (0, 0, 0, 1) and as α ↗ 1, π → (0, 1, 0, 0), so complete dominance is captured in the extreme choices of α.\nThe flexibility here also illustrates the PCMC model’s ability to exhibit an important empirical phenomena known as asymmetric dominance [13].

When P is parameterized according to BTL we have just n parameters, and when it is parameterized according to a Blade-Chest distance model in d dimensions, we have 2dn parameters.\nWe evaluate each parameterization (arbitrary, MNL, Blade-Chest distance) for each synthetic regime. We employ the Iterative Luce Spectral Ranking (I-LSR) algorithm to learn the model under the BTL parameterization of P , where the PCMC model is equivalent to an MNL model. When the data is generated by MNL, we expect ILSR (learning the BTL parameterization) to outperform inference under the general parameterization. When the data is generated by a non-MNL PCMC model, we expect I-LSR to exhibit restricted performance compared to a general parameterization, since the data is not generated by a model that I-LSR can learn.\nTraining data Ctrain and evaluation data Ceval are generated according to each of the three PCMC models, and then learned for each of the three parameterizations. For each model we draw a stream of triplets S uniformly at random from U . We then infer each model, and examine the evaluation data using the error metric\nError(Ceval) = ∑ S∈Ceval ∑ i∈S (p̂iS − p̃iS)2,\nwhere p̃iS is the estimation according to the model, and p̂iS is the empirical probability in the evaluation data.\nFigure 1 shows our error performance as the data grows, averaged across 20 instances, for each data generating process and each inference parameterization. First each model is trained on an “episode” of 100 samples, and error is measured on predictions for the next episode of 100 samples. These new samples are then added to the training data, and error is again measured on a new episode of 100 samples, for each inference scheme.\nThe inference is applied to a set U with n = 20 objects, meaning that MNL has 20 parameters, the PCMC model with arbitrary P has ( 20 2 ) = 190 parameters, and the PCMC model with the Blade-Chest distance parameterization uses 2dn = 80 parameters. Although these models seem modest in size, we examine 9 data–model pairs, trained sequentially in 20 episodes, averaged across 20 instances. As a result, the figure represents 3600 trained models. Training a PCMC model with an arbitrary P matrix on n = 20 objects with 190 parameters takes us roughly 10 seconds using python in a single thread.\nWhile I-LSR does an excellent job with the MNL data, we see that the more general inference of an arbitrary PCMC model shows better predictive power in both regimes that do not assume the choice axiom. As a consequence, we expect PCMC to have better predictive power in empirical contexts exhibiting violations of the choice axiom, which are abundant [13]."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this work, we introduced a Pairwise Choice Markov Chain (PCMC) model of discrete choice, a novel model for extending pairwise probabilities to larger sets. PCMC uses the stationary distribution of a continuous time Markov chain on the candidate choices to define selection probabilities, where the transition rates come from the pairwise selection probabilities.\nThe PCMC model is well defined for any pairwise probabilities, is not a random utility model for general pairwise probabilities, and maintains maximum flexibility by eschewing the implications of Luce’s choice axiom, transitivity, and regularity. Despite\nthis flexibility, we demonstrate that the PCMC model exhibits desirable structure by fulfilling uniform expansion, a property previously found only in the rigid Multinomial Logit (MNL) model and inferentially intractable Elimination by Aspects model.\nWe also introduced the notion of contractibility, a nuanced property underlying important thought experiments instrumental in moving choice theory beyond the choice axiom, and showed that the PCMC model exhibits contractibility.\nAfter examining how the PCMC model deftly handles these thought experiments, we showed that the PCMC model offers straightforward inference through maximum likelihood estimation that competes well with the I-LSR algorithm on MNL data, yet demonstrates that it can also learn models which lie outside the realm of the choice axiom, where I-LSR fails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this inference extends intuitively to parameterizations of the pairwise probabilities, allowing us to wrap our inference around modern models designed to capture intransitivity such as the BladeChest distance model.\nGiven the flexibility and tractability of the PCMC model, it opens up many compelling research directions. First, we wonder what conditions on the matrix P guarantee that a PCMC model is a RUM. Next, the efficacy of the PCMC model suggests exploring other effective parameterizations for P , including developing algorithms for inferring contractible partitions. There are also computational questions, such as streamlining the likelihood maximization using gradients of the implicit definitions. Very recently, learning results for nested MNL models have shown favorable query complexity under an oracle model, while also demonstrating good performance from greedy inference heuristics [2], and a comparison of our PCMC model with these approaches to learning nested MNL models should be considered important future work. Lastly, a key next step will be evaluating the performance of the PCMC model when applying our inferences and predictions to empirical choice data.\nAcknowledgements.

In this work we introduce a Pairwise Choice Markov Chain (PCMC) model of discrete choice that is free of all those assumptions while still satisfying the attractive foundational axiom of uniform expansion. Uniform expansion is known to imply Luce’s choice axiom in the context of independent random utility models (RUMs), but the PCMC model is not a RUM (let alone an independent RUM). Inference for the PCMC model is straight-forward, and we thus introduce it as the first inferentially tractable model of discrete choice known to satisfy uniform expansion without the choice axiom, regularity, or strict stochastic transitivity. It is thus more flexible than even Tversky’s Elimination By Aspects model, which assumes regularity and is also known to be inferentially intractable. We show that our model learns and predicts synthetic non-transitive data well. Our analysis also synthesizes several recent observations connecting the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model and Markov chains; the PCMC model retains the Multinomial Logit model as a special case.",
