      "text" : "In many naturally occurring optimization problems one needs to ensure that the definition of the optimization problem lends itself to solutions that are tractable to compute. In cases where exact solutions cannot be computed tractably, it is beneficial to have strong guarantees on the tractable approximate solutions. In order operate under these criterion most optimization problems are cast under the umbrella of convexity or submodularity. In this report we will study design and optimization over a common class of functions called submodular functions.\nSet functions, and specifically submodular set functions, characterize a wide variety of naturally occurring optimization problems, and the property of submodularity of set functions has deep theoretical consequences with wide ranging applications. Informally, the property of submodularity of set functions concerns the intuitive principle of diminishing returns. This property states that adding an element to a smaller set has more value than adding it to a larger set. Common examples of submodular monotone functions are entropies, concave functions of cardinality, and matroid rank functions; non-monotone examples include graph cuts, network flows, and mutual information.\nIn this paper we will review the formal definition of submodularity; the optimization of submodular functions, both maximization and minimization; and finally discuss some applications in relation to learning and reasoning using submodular functions."

In a machine learning context f could be a function that evaluates information of a given set, i.e entropy.

Hence φ(x) is the state of x under the realization φ. Now consider a random realization characterized by the random variable Φ. Then we can assume a prior probability distribution over realizations as p(φ) := P[Φ = φ]. In cases where we observe only one realization Φ(x) at a time, as we pick an item x ∈ V at a time; we can represent our observations so far with a partial realization χ, i.e a function of a subset of V and its observed states.

When a partial realization χ is equal everywhere with φ in the dom(χ), they are consistent φ ∼ χ. This implies that all the items observed with specific states in χ have also been observed with the same states in φ. Now we extend this notion to subsets by saying if χ and χ′ are consistent with φ and dom(χ) ⊆ dom(χ′), then χ is a subrealization of χ′.

Finally the cut δ(S) = δ+ ∪ δ−, this for an undirected graph would be the set of edges with exactly one end in S.

Similarly submodularity can be proved for f+ and f−.\nNow in order to formalize our notion of Maximum a posteriori estimation as a submodular function minimization problem, we introduce the following notation. Consider the function E : {0, 1}n → R defined over binary variables X = {x1, ..., xn}. Such functions are called regular functions [11]. We can define an equivalent set function Ê\nÊ(S) = E(x) where xi = 1 if and only if i ∈ S\nWe define the class F2 to be functions that can be written as a sum of functions of up to two binary variables at a time. E(x1, ....xn) = ∑ i Ei(xi) + ∑ i<j Ei,j(xi, xj)\nThe regularity of the binary function from F2 translates to submodularity of the equivalent set function. Given an input set of nodes P in a graph G and a set of labels L, the labeling l (which is a mapping from P to L) can be deduced by minimizing some energy function. In graph based energy minimization problems in computer vision and machine learning, the standard form of the energy function used is as follows\nE(l) = ∑ p∈P Dp(lp) + ∑ p,q∈N Vp,q(lp, lq)\nwhere N ⊂ P × P is a neighbourhood set of nodes. Dp is a cost function derived from assigning label lp to node p. Vp,q is the cost of assigning labels lp, lq to adjacent nodes p, q. If V is a non-convex function of ‖lp − lq‖ which accounts for border labeling, the energy function E(l) is called a discontinuity preserving energy function. This label assignment problem is similar to the graph cut problem, as the labeling function is submodular in the context of the regular functions defined earlier. Minimizing this energy function E is equivalent to finding the minimum cut of the graph G. However one should note that the solution depends on the exact form of the function V and it cannot be convex as it leads to oversmoothing of borders. In the case when V (lp, lq) = T [lp 6= lq], where T is the indicator function. This smoothness term is called the Potts Model. The solution shown above can readilyb e extended to more than two labels, or beyond the binary problem. We use the binary problem to motivate the result shown above. This result is widely used in computer vision in the domains of image segmentation, stereo correspondence and multicamera image reconstruction. Another widely used application of this approach is to find the Maximum a posteriori estimate of a Markov Random Field [12].\nConsider a set of random variables X = {X1, ...., Xn} defined on a set S such that the variable Xi can take the value xi from the set L = {l1, ...ln}. Then X can be defined as a Markov Random field with respect to the neighbourhood set N = {Ni | i ∈ S} iff, the positivity property P (x) > 0 and the Markovian property P (xi | xS\\i) = P (xi | xNi) ∀i ∈ S. Here P (x) = P (X = x), P (xi) = P (Xi = xi) and finally P (X1 = x1, ..., Xn = xn) = (X = x) where x = {xi | i ∈ S} is a realization of the field. Given these definitions the MAP estimate of the MRF can be formulated as an energy minimization problem, where energy corresponding to a realization of x (configuration of the field) is given by the negative log likelihood of the joint posterior probability of the MRF φ(x) = −logP (x | D) Hence the corresponding energy function for the Potts model becomes\nE(x) = ∑ i∈S φ(D|xi) + ∑ j∈Ni ψ(xi, xj)  where φ(D|xi) = −logP (i ∈ S) and\nψ(xi, xj) = { Kij if xi 6= xj 0 if xi = xj\nHere Kij is some penalty cost which makes ψ(xi, xj) non convex.\nFinally we can conclude that the energy minimization problem solved by min-cut, max flow which yields the minimum energy solution is equivalent to finding the maximium a posteriori solution of a Markov Random Field."

      "text" : "In classic supervised machine learning, the learning algorithm (or learner) is given the task of finding a response function f : X 7→ Y that predicts as accurately as possible the output response Y ∈ Y for a given input observation X ∈ X [13]. Responses take a variety of forms. In classification, this may be a label from a discrete set of choices Y = {1, 2, . . . }, while in regression it may be continuous. One of the most common tasks\nis binary classification, in which Y = ±1. We have some unknown underlying distribution D over the space of observations and responses X × Y , so that observation-response pairs are sampled according to (X,Y ) ∼ D. The learner chooses from candidate functions or hypotheses in a hypothesis space H with the goal of minimizing the expected error or risk D(h) = E(X,Y )∼D[err(h(X), Y )]. In other words, the learner’s goal is to find h∗ that minimizes the risk: h∗ = arg maxh∈H D(h). For standard classification tasks, the error function is simply the indicator function of a mistake 1{h(X) 6= Y }, and so the risk is simply the probability of a mistake (h) = E(X,Y )∼D[1{h(X) 6= Y }] = Pr{h(X) 6= Y }. For continuous response functions and multiclass classification where order matters, there are a wide choice of more complex error functions.\nOf course, in practice D is unknown and so it is impossible to directly minimize the risk. Instead, the learner is provided with “supervision” in the form of a finite sample of observation-response pairs, i.e., a labeled training data set S = {Xi, Yi}i=1,...,n where |S| = n. The learner can then approximate D using S and minimize the empirical error over S:\n̂S(h) = E(X,Y )∈S [err(h(X), Y )] = 1\nn n∑ i=1 err(h(Xi), Yi)\nNote that this definition of empirical risk assumes that samples (X,Y ) are identically independently distributed (IID), a fairly common assumption in supervised machine learning. In the empirical risk minimization (ERM) paradigm, the learner assumes that the sample S is sufficiently representative of D such that choosing ĥ = arg maxh∈H ̂S will yield a hypothesis ĥ that will also have a relatively low risk D(ĥ) [14]. A well known theoretical result for classification that comes from Vapnik tells us if we want to learn a “good” classifier from a hypothesis class H, then we need roughly |S| = Õ ( d/ε2 log(1/δ) ) points in our training sample [15]. Here ε is the maximum deviation that\nwe will tolerate between the true risks of ĥ and optimal h∗ and δ is the probability with which we are willing to let this happen (i.e., we want | (ĥ)− (h∗)| ≤ ε to hold with probability 1− δ). Informally, d represents the “size” of our hypothesis class; formally, it is the VC dimension. A useful rule of thumb is that for most useful hypothesis classes, the VC dimension scales linearly with the number of parameters and so the number of training samples needed scales linearly with “complexity” of the model.\nIt is important to distinguish two cases of supervised learning, based on realizability. When the problem is realizable, then there exists some hypothesis h ∈ H that can perfectly predict the response for every point (i.e., err(h∗) = 0); in binary classification, this corresponds to the problem being “separable” by a hypothesis in H. When err(h) > 0, the problem is not realizable [16]. The presence of label noise, where the same point may receive different responses, further complicates this picture. If a training sample S contains noisy labels (perhaps due to error), this may mislead the ERM. If the true data distribution allows points to have different labels (i.e., our true labeling function is stochastic), then at best we may only be able to model P (Y |X), rather than make perfect predictions."

      "text" : "Imagine the following problem, which we will call the selective sampling on a budget problem: given a large, fully labeled finite sample S, we will “purchase” a subset L ⊆ S (where |L| |S| because our “cost” scales with |L|) and train h̄ = arg maxh∈H ̂L(h) with the goal of minimizing D(h̄). We are given full access to S until we make our purchase decision, at which point we can use only L to choose our final hypothesis (i.e., we must “forget” everything we know about S\\L). This can be thought of as choosing the smallest possible representative subsampleL. Intuitively, it is similar to a set cover problem: we want to pose queries that “cover” (i.e., eliminate) as many false hypotheses (inconsistent with our labeled data set) as possible. This problem clearly has submodular structure.\nLemma 4.3 The selective sampling on a budget problem is submodular and monotone decreasing.\nProof 4.4 We provide a non-rigorous justification. First, for labeled subsample A, define a hypothesis set HA ⊆ H that contains all hypotheses fromH that are consistent with the labeled points inA: HA = {h : ̂A(h) = 0∧h ∈ H}. Now define a function f(A) = 1− |HA|/|H|, i.e., maps A to the value of 1 minus probability mass (under a uniform prior) of its consistent hypothesis set. Now consider labeled subsamples B and B′ such that B ⊆ B′ ⊆ S and arbitrary point X 6∈ B, 6∈ B′. The key insight here is that as we add labeled points to our subsamples, we can only remove hypotheses from our current hypothesis space; once a hypothesis has been removed, it cannot be re-added.\nf is monotone increasing: Suppose that hypothesis h ∈ HB′ . This means that it is consistent with every labeled point in B′. Because B ⊆ B′, h must also be consistent with every point in B and so h ∈ HB. Therefore,HB′ ⊆ HB and so\n|HB′ | ≤ |HB| |HB′ |/|H| ≤ |HB|/|H|\n1− |HB′ |/|H| ≥ 1− |HB|/|H| f(B′) ≥ f(B)\nwhenever B ⊆ B′. f is submodular: Now suppose that adding point X to B′ removes h from HB′ , i.e., h ∈ HB′ \\ HB′∪{X}. Because HB′ ⊆ HB whenever B ⊆ B′, it must also be the case that HB′∪{X} ⊆ HB∪{X} and so h ∈ HB \\ HB∪{X}. Thus, if adding X to B′ removes m hypotheses fromHB′ , then adding X to B must remove n ≥ m hypotheses fromHB:\nm ≤ n |HB′ | − |HB′ |+m ≤ |HB| − |HB|+ n\n|HB′ |/|H| − (|HB′ | −m)/|H| ≤ |HB|/|H| − (|HB| − n)/|H| −1 + |HB′ |/|H|+ 1− (|HB′ | −m)/|H| ≤ −1 + |HB|/|H|+ 1− (|HB| − n)/|H| 1− (|HB′ | −m)/|H| − (1− |HB′ |/|H|) ≤ 1− (|HB| − n)/|H| − (1− |HB|/|H|)\nf(B′ ∪ {X})− f(B′) ≤ f(B ∪ {X})− f(B)\nwhenever B ⊆ B′.\nThis is intuitive. IfH′ ⊆ H contains all hypotheses inH that are inconsistent with X’s label, then clearlyHB′ ⊆ HB implies thatHB′ \\ C ⊆ HB \\ C. This result may not seem terribly exciting, but what it does suggest is that we can solve the selective sampling on a budget problem using a greedy approach: on the tth iteration, choose the X that eliminates the largest number of inconsistent hypotheses from our currentHB:\n(X,Y )t = arg max (X,Y )∈S\\Bt ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∑\nh∈HBt\n1{h(X) 6= Y } ∣∣∣∣∣∣"

      "text" : "Now imagine a variation of the above selective sampling problem where we do not have access to the label of X ∈ S until we “purchase” it. Here we might use active learning. Active learning is a variation of the supervised learning paradigm where the learner does not receive access to a fully labeled data sample S upfront. Rather it has access to an unlabeled data sample U = {(X, ?)}, as well as an oracle that the learner can query for the response (or label) of an observation, Y = or(X) [16]. The active learner is given agency to choose which individual samples to label, but each query has a cost c and the learner has only a limited budget to spend on labeling data. Similar to the selective sampling scenario described above, the active learner has dual goals: to choose simultaneously a labeled subset of observations L ⊆ U and a hypothesis h̄ = arg minh∈H ̂L(h) (i.e., h̄ is the ERM for L) that will yield the best possible predictive performance (i.e., lowest risk D(h̄)).\nWhen evaluating active learning algorithms, we are concerned primarily with two performance properties: the quality (in terms of risk) of the hypotheses they produce and their query efficiency. Intuitively, a good active learner will use a very small number of label queries to produce a hypothesis with very small predictive error. More formally, we are interested in (1) how the error of the hypothesis produced by an active learner that chooses labeled subsample L compares with that of the hypothesis that we could learn from a fully labeled sample S where L ⊆ S; and (2) how many label queries must be made to achieve a certain level of performance, which we call label complexity and express in Big-Oh notation. An ideal active learner will compete with fully supervised learning with |L| |S|. More realistically, we hope to at least place an upper bound on the error of active learning that is within a constant (multiplicative or additive) factor of the error of fully labeled supervised learning.\nIt is not hard to design greedy approaches to active learning, but two questions arise: first, are there greedy active learning algorithms that have sound theoretical guarantees about error and label complexity; and second, can we show that such algorithms are in fact specific cases of more general approaches based on submodularity? The answer to\nboth of these questions is, in fact, yes [17]. Let Lt be the set of labeled data points after t queries (and recall that HLt is the set of hypotheses fromH consistent with the labeled data in Lt). For the next (t+ 1) label query, we want to choose the unlabeled point that provokes the greatest disagreement between hypotheses in HLt .The maximum disagreement occurs when half of the hypotheses predict one label and the rest the other. Equivalently, this minimizes the absolute value of the sum of all predicted labels: |∑h∈HLt h(x)| (when using ±1 labels). Following this query policy, we hope to cut the tth hypothesis space roughly in half with query t+ 1 and achieve a label complexity that is roughly O(log(d/ε)) for d the size (e.g., VC dimension) of the hypothesis space and deviation bound ε. [17] shows that in the worst case, this strategy may have to query every single label; indeed, for certain pathological cases, even the optimal query strategy will need to query every label. However, the average case analysis is much more promising. On average, the greedy strategy’s label complexity is at most Õ(log d) times larger that that of the optimal policy, as we show below in Theorem 4.5, which rephrases Claim 4 and Theorem 3 from [17]:\nTheorem 4.5 (Dasgupta [17]) Suppose the optimal query policy requiresM labels in expectation for target hypotheses chosen uniformly from hypothesis class H of (VC) dimension d ≥ ee ≈ 16. Then the expected number of labels queried by the greedy strategy is at least M log dlog log d and at most 4M log d.\nAs [17] points out, the lower bound is a bit depressing, but we derive some comfort from the fact that the upper bound matches the lower bound within a multiplicative factor. We can extend this analysis to a Bayesian framework where we have a nonuniform prior distribution over hypotheses π(h). In this setting, we seek a label query that will divide the probability mass over hypotheses (rather than the hypothesis space itself) in half. We do this by minimizing the absolute value of the sum of predictions weighted by the prior probabilities of the hypotheses making them: |∑h∈Ht π(x)h(x)|. In this case, the d term in the lower and upper bounds is replaced with minh∈H π(h). In [8], the authors show that the hypothesis space reduction problem is adaptive submodular, specifically an example of an adaptive stochastic coverage problem. Here our ground set is the set of all points V = {x : x ∈ U}, and each point has an unobserved stateO = {y : y ∈ Y} = {±1} where Φ(x) = y for the pair (x, y) and for a given hypothesis h ∈ H, Φh(x) = h(x). The set of labeled points Lt forms a consistent partial realization χt at iteration t. Then we can define a function that takes as input an element subset V ′ and a realization function Φ′ and maps it to a real number in the interval [0, 1]:\nf(V ′,Φ′) = f̂(H = {h : h(x) = Φ′(x) for all x ∈ V ′}) = 1− ∑ h∈H π(h)\nSo for a labeled subset Lt, f(Vt,Φt) = f̂(Lt), where Vt = {x : (x, y) ∈ Lt} and Φt(x) = Ψt(x) = y for (x, y) ∈ Lt. This function is adaptively submodular, as shown in Lemma 4.6, adapted from [8]:\nLemma 4.6 (Golovin and Krause [8]) The hypothesis space reduction problem is adaptive submodular and adaptive monotone.\nThe proof of monotonicity follows along lines similar to the one used in Theorem 4.3: basically, querying a label can only remove hypotheses, and hypothesis probabilities are nonzero, so removing one can only reduce the value of f . The proof of submodularity is more subtle, though it rests on the same intuition as that of monotonicity and involves comparing the conditional expected marginal benefits, as described in. Interestingly, this angle yields a slightly more optimistic average case analysis than that given in Theorem 4.5 above, removing the constant multiplier from the upper bound. We give it below in Theorem 4.7, adapted from [8]:\nTheorem 4.7 (Golovin and Krause [8]) Suppose the optimal query policy requires M labels in expectation for target hypotheses chosen using distribution π from hypothesis class H. Then the expected number of labels queried by the greedy strategy is at most M ( log (\n1 minh∈H π(h)\n) + 1 ) ."

Working on submodularity and adaptive submodularity, computer scientists were able to rediscover and generalize previously published results from machine learning, improving an upper bound along the way. More\nimportant, they provided new and useful insights into the problem, relating it to other problems (which we did not discuss in this section) and paving the way to new discoveries. Recently, there has been an explosion of similar work, much of it published in 2013. [18] describe a framework for performing distributed submodular maximization in a shared-nothing (MapReduce) storage setting and using it to choose a representative subsample of a massive data set for learning (similar to our selective sampling on a budget problem). [19] describe a greedy batch-mode active learning algorithm that queries labels in batches of size k > 1 and show that this approach is competitive not only with optimal batch-more active learning but also with more traditional greedy active learning. There are a variety of other papers pushing the boundary in this area [20] [21] [22] [23].\nThere are two lines of work that seem conspicuously absent (at least, based on our admittedly myopic literature review): (1) applications of submodularity to streaming active learning; and (2) “aggressive” active learning in the nonrealizable case. The former involves active learning when we do not have access to the entirety of U at the start of the learning process. Rather, we receive one data point at a time in an online fashion and must make a query decision for point Xt based only on the samples Ut that we’ve seen so far. The above greedy algorithm and analysis require that we be able to choose a point Xt = arg minX∈U\\Lt\n∣∣∣∑h∈HLt π(h)h(X)∣∣∣. We cannot, of course, do this in the streaming setting. Nonetheless, intuition suggests that we may be able to extend the adaptive submodularity framework (or some related idea) to this setting.\nAggressive active learning in the non-realizable case is a wide open problem, at least as of [16]. Informally, aggressive active learners, which include greedy active learners, are those that attempt to make the “most informative” label query at each step. In the realizable case, it is possible to develop aggressive algorithms that are statistically consistent (will discover the optimal hypothesis with enough queries) and have sound theoretical guarantees for label complexity. However, these guarantees go out the window with realizability. Perhaps some form of submodularity may help here, but at first blush, it looks as though the nonrealizable case will not satisfy the assumptions necessary for adaptive submodularity. We do have a variety of mellow active learners, which seek any informative label query, that are label efficient and statistically consistent [24] [16]. It would be interesting to develop a new analysis of these algorithms in terms of submodularity and then to see if this analysis perhaps provides a bridge between mellow and aggressive active learning."

Various extensions to the basic framework of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) [25] have been introduced to incorporate and reason about such “soft” constraints.

A WCSP is an optimization version of a CSP in which the constraints are no longer “hard,” but are extended by associating (non-negative) costs with the tuples. The goal is to find an assignment of values to all variables from their respective domains such that the total cost is minimized.\nFor simplicity, we restrict ourselves to Boolean WCSPs. Note that this class can be used to model important combinatorial problems such as representing and reasoning about user preferences [26], over-subscription planning with goal preferences [27], combinatorial auctions [28], and bioinformatics [29], energy minimization problems in probabilistic settings, computer vision, Markov Random Fields [30], etc. In addition, many real-world domains exhibit submodularity in the cost structure that is worth exploiting for computational benefits.

      "text" : "Constraint Composite Graphs (CCGs) are combinatorial structures associated with optimization problems posed as WCSPs. They provide a unifying framework for exploiting both the graphical structure of the variable interactions as well as the numerical structure of the weighted constraints [32]. We reformulate WCSPs as minimum weighted vertex cover problems to construct simple bipartite graph representations for important classes of submodular constraints, thereby translating them into max-flow problems on bipartite graphs.\nThe concept of the minimum weighted VC1 on a given undirected graph G = 〈V,E〉 can be extended to the notion of projecting minimum weighted VCs onto a given IS2 U ⊆ V . The input to such a projection is the graph G as well as an identified IS U = {u1, u2 . . . uk}. The output is a table of 2k numbers. Each entry in this table corresponds to a k-bit vector. We say that a k-bit vector imposes the following restrictions: if the ith bit is 0 (1), the node ui is necessarily excluded (included) from the minimum weighted VC. The value of an entry is the weight of the minimum weighted VC conditioned on the restrictions imposed by it. Figure 1 presents a simple example.\nThe aformentioned table can be viewed as a weighted constraint over |U | Boolean variables. Conversely, given a (Boolean) weighted constraint, we can think about designing a “lifted” representation for it so as to be able to view it as the projection of a minimum weighted VC problem in some node-weighted undirected graph. This idea was first discussed in [33]. The benefit of constructing these graphical representations for individual constraints lies in the fact that the “lifted” graphical representation for the entire WCSP can be obtained simply by “merging3” them. This “merged” graph is referred to as the CCG associated with the WCSP. Computing the minimum weighted VC for the CCG yields a solution for the WCSP; namely, if Xi is in the minimum weighted VC, then it is assigned the value 1 in the WCSP, else it is assigned the value 0 in the WCSP. Figure 1 shows an example WCSP and its CCG.\nAny given weighted constraint on Boolean variables can be represented graphically using a tripartite graph, which can be constructed in polynomial time [32]. In many cases, the lifted graphical representations even turn out to be only bipartite. Since the resulting CCG is also bipartite if each of the individual graphical representations are bipartite, the tractability of the language LBooleanbipartite - the language of all Boolean weighted constraints with a bipartite graphical representation - is readily established. This is because solving minimum weighted VC problems on bipartite graphs is reducible to max-flow problems, and can therefore be solved efficiently in polynomial time.\n1A vertex cover (VC) is a set of nodes S such that every edge has at least one end point in S. 2U is an independent set (IS) of a graph if and only if no two nodes in U are connected by an edge. 3nodes that represent the same variable are simply “merged” - along with their edges - and every “composite” node is given a\nweight equal to the sum of the individual weights of the merged nodes.\n(w1 − w2)Xi −w(XiXj) −w(XiXjXk) −w(1−Xi)(1−Xj)(1−Xk)w(XiXjXk)\nFinally, Boolean weighted constraints can be represented as multivariate polynomials on the variables participating in that constraint [31, 32]. The coefficients of the polynomial can be computed with a standard Gaussian Elimination procedure for solving systems of linear equations. The linear equations themselves arise from substituting different combinations of values to the variables, and equating them to the corresponding entries in the weighted constraint. One way to build the CCG of a given weighted constraint is: (a) build the graphical representations for each of the individual terms in the multivariate polynomial; and (b) “merge” these graphical representations [32]."

The company has a limited budget to give free samples of their new product to the users in the social network. A natural question to ask is to which set of users should the company give the free sample products, such that the overall adoption of the new product can be maximized. The question is exactly the influence maximization problem, namely selecting a small set of seed nodes in a social network such that its overall influence coverage is maximized under a certain diffusion model.\nAmong the many diffusion models, the Independent Cascade (IC) model and Linear Threshold (LT) are used widely in the study of influence maximization [36]. Both IC and LT models are stochastic models characterizing how influence propagates throughout the network, starting from the initial seed notes.\nFor influence maximization, the objective function σ(S), where S is the initial seed set, is the expected number of activated nodes under the diffusion model. The problem is simply to maximize σ(S) subject to the cardinality constraint |S| ≤ k. It has been shown that the influence maximization problem under both IC model and LT model is NP-hard [36]. However, by the following theorems the problem allows efficient approximation algorithm.\nTheorem 5.1 (Kempe et al. [36]) The objective function of influence maximization problem under both IC and LT model is non-negative, monotone and submodular.\nBy the classic greedy algorithm for monotone submodular function maximization, a 1− 1/e approximation guarantee can be achieved. The proof of the theorem is by the fact that conic combination of submodular functions is also submodular. The objective function is a expectation and can be written as\nσ(S) = ∑\noutcomeX\nProb[X]σ(S|X),\nwhere X is any realization of the stochastic diffusion process. A reachability argument for both IC model and LT model can be used to show that σ(S|X) is submodular under any X . Though the greedy algorithm can solve the problem approximately in polynomial time, its key step, i.e., evaluation of the marginal gain σ(S ∪ {u}) − σ(S), can take a long time for large networks. Many papers have been published on how to improve the efficiency of the algorithm [43, 44, 45, 46, 47], such as by lazy evaluation [44, 45], or by approximate evaluation of the marginal gain [43, 46, 47] .\nA more general result on Generalized Linear Threshold models has been proved generalizing the results for the IC and LT models in [48]. The proof uses a sophisticated stage-wise coupling argument to show that submodularity applies. The idea of the proof is to add the initial seeds and propagate the influence stage by stage. The key component in the proof is the anti-sense coupling used in the last stage.\nA extension to influence maximization that draws much attention recently is to solve this problem under the competitive influence. Competitive influence implies that two or multiple competitive products, or ideas are propagating simultaneously in the social network. The influence maximization problem naturally extends to maximizing one’s own influence [38, 39, 40] or minimizing the influence of the competitors [41, 42] given the choices of the initial seeds of the competitors. For example, on the maximization side, [49] study the influence maximization when a user can dislike the product and propagate bad news about it. On the minimization side, [50] study the idea of influence blocking maximization, which focuses on selecting seeds to block the propagation of rumors. Both approaches solve the optimization problem by showing the objective function is monotone and submodular. The proof technique is similar to that in [36]. However, their arguments are much more complicated due to the interaction of competitive diffusion."

      "text" : "The influence maximization problem takes as its input a social network structure with the strength of influence on each edge. However, in most cases, the underlying network that enables the diffusion is hidden (e.g., networks on who influenced whom). The most common observations of information diffusion are only the activation time for individual in social network (e.g., the time stamps of when a person posted a blog containing certain information or retweeted another user’s tweet, when a user bought a certain product in viral marketing applications, etc.). The network inference problem focuses on discovering the diffusion network from the observed cascades occurring among the individuals in a social network. Existing approaches to this problem solve a maximum likelihood estimation problem with respect to the network structure under certain diffusion models [35, 37, 51, 52]. It turns out that the likelihood function of this problem can be approximated with a submodular function. Thus, submodular function maximization can be used to solve this problem [35, 37].\nThe extended IC model is used as the diffusion model in [35, 37]. In the extended IC model, each edge is associated with an activation probability. Moreover, each activation has time delay. For example, if node v is activated at time tv and the activation attempt to v’s neighbour u succeeds. Then u with become activated at time tu + ∆t, where ∆t is the time delay. In the model, the delay time satisfies exponential distribution or power law distribution, namely\nPd(∆t) ∝ e− ∆t α or Pd(∆t) ∝\n1\n∆tα\nThen according to the model, if v which is activated at time tv and v succeeds in activating node u which becomes activated at time tu. Then the probability this activation occurs is:\nPc(v, u) = Pd(tu − tv)pvu Also the model assumes that influence can only propagate forward in time, which means Pc(v, u) = 0 if tv > tu. Then if the pattern of cascade c forms a tree T , the probability that the cascade is observed given the tree is\nP (c|T ) = ∏\n(i,j)∈T\nPc(i, j)\nIn addition, if we assume the who-infect-who relation forms a tree pattern (one is only activated by one person). Then given a certain G, the probability we observe the cascade c would be\nP (c|G) = ∑\nT∈T (G)\nP (c|T )P (T |G) ∝ ∑\nT∈T (G) ∏ (i,j)∈T Pc(i, j)\nwhere T (G) is all directed spanning tree on G. Therefore, if we have observed a set of cascades C = {c1, c2, . . .}, The probability of observing all these cascades is\nP (C|G) = ∏ c∈C P (c|G).\nUnder this configuration, the network inference problem is to find an graph Ĝ = (V, Ê) with less than k edges such that\nĜ = arg max |E|≤k\nP (C|G)\nIn the objective function, we sum over all spanning trees of the graph G, which is super-exponential. In order to make this computation feasible, we instead solve an approximation in which only the spanning tree with the maximal likelihood is considered, namely\nP (C|G) = ∏ c∈C max T∈T (G) P (c|T ) = ∏ c∈C max T∈T (G) ∏ (i,j)∈T Pc(i, j)\nThen we define Fc(G) as the difference between the log likelihood of cascade c over graph G and empty graph K̄.\nFc(G) = max T∈T (G) logP (c|T )− max T∈T (K̄) logP (c|T )\nand take sum over all the cascades, we have\nFC(G) = ∑ c∈C Fc(G)\nK̄ is a graph with all the nodes in G and also a extra node m. The only edges in K̄ are the edges from m to every other nodes with activation probability ε and delay 0. The extra node represents the external influence. Then the optimization problem can be rewritten as\nG∗ = arg max |E|≤k FC(G) (3)\n[35] proved that this objective function is monotone and submodular. Therefore, a greedy algorithm can achieve 1− 1e approximation for solving it. This approach was later improved by by the MultiTree algorithm in [37], where the the matrix tree theorem is used to calculated the exact summation over all possible spanning trees, rather than using the maximum spanning tree approximation.\nIn a on-going project by Xinran He with Prof. Yan Liu, we are experimenting with using Maximum a Posteriori inference to solve the network inference problem. The previous approaches assume no prior knowledge about the structure of the inferred graph. However, it has been shown repeatedly that social networks have many unique properties, including heavy-tail degree distribution, small diameter, community structure, and so on. We propose a social network generative model over the diffusion network as a prior to incorporate the prior knowledge about network structure. Our current choice is the Kronecker graphs model [53, 54]. The Kronecker graphs model is a parametric model which can provide a probability for the existence of each edge in the social network. The existence of each edge is considered independent under this model. Using this model as a prior, we can change the objective function FC(G) in Equation 3 to\nF ′C(G) = FC(G) + ∑ e∈E (logProb[e exists]− logProb[e not exists]).\nAfter adding a modular function to a submodular function, the resulted F ′C(G) is still submodular, however it may not necessary be monotone any more. As a result, the simple greedy algorithm can not be used to solve this problem. Instead, we can use the algorithm proposed in [55] with a 1/2 + o(1) approximation guarantee."
