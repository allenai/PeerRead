      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Machine reading comprehension (Nguyen et al., 2016), which attempts to enable machines to answer questions after reading a passage or a set of passages, attracts great attentions from both research and industry communities in recent years. The release of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and the Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset (MS-MARCO) provides the large-scale manually created datasets for model training and testing of machine learning (esp. deep learning) algorithms for this task. There are two settings in existing machine reading comprehension datasets. The SQuAD dataset constrains the answer to be an exact sub-span in the passage, while the words in the answer are not necessary in the passages as in the MS-MARCO dataset.\nExisting methods for machine reading comprehension usually follow the extraction based approach. It formulates the task as predicting the start and end positions of the answer in the passage. The work on the SQuAD dataset mostly follows this direction according to the task definition. However, as defined in the MS-MARCO dataset, the answer may come from multiple spans, and the system needs to elaborate the answer using words in the passages or not, which is more natural as it is how human answers questions after reading a passage.\nTable 1 shows the examples from the MS-MARCO dataset organized in different synthetic categories, in which the answer needs to be synthesized or generated from the question and passage. The answer may consist of the answer text spans (hereafter evidence snippets) from the passage and words from the question or even words that are not found in the passages or question. In the first example, the final answer is further refined from the evidence snippet in the passage. In the second example, the answer is composed through combining the evidence snippets and words in the question. In the third and fourth examples, the answers are from multiple evidence in the same passage or in different passages. In the last example, one should infer the answer as the words in it do not exist in the passage and question.\n∗ Contribution during internship at Microsoft Research.\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n04 81\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n5 Ju\nn 20\nIn this paper, we present an extraction-then-generation framework for machine reading comprehension, in which the answer is generated from the extraction results. We build the answer extraction model to predict the most important sub-spans from the passage as evidence, and then develop the answer generation model which takes the evidence as additional features along with the question and passage to further elaborate the final answers.\nSpecifically, the extraction model is based on the R-Net (Wang et al., 2017). We use the bidirectional recurrent networks (RNN) for word-level representation, and then apply the attention mechanism to incorporate matching information from question to passage. Next, we predict start and end positions of the evidence snippet by the Pointer Networks (Vinyals et al., 2015a). Then, we apply the sequence-to-sequence model to synthesize the final answer by extracted evidence. The question and passage are encoded by a bi-directional RNN. The start and end positions of extracted snippet are\nlabeled as features. Lastly, we combine the question and passage information as the input to feed the decoder, and use an attention-equipped decoder to generate the final answer.\nWe conduct experiments on the MS-MARCO dataset. The results show our extraction-thengeneration framework outperforms our baselines and all other existing methods in terms of ROUGEL and BLEU-1."

      "heading" : "2 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Benchmark datasets play an important role in recent progress in reading comprehension and question answering research. Richardson et al. (2013) release MCTest whose goal is to select the best answer from four options given the question and the passage. CNN/Daily-Mail(Hermann et al., 2015) and CBT(Hill et al., 2016) are the cloze-style datasets in which the goal is to predict the missing word (often a named entity) in a passage. Different from above datasets, the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) whose answer can be much longer phrase is more challenging. The answer in SQuAD is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage. Similar to the SQuAD, MS-MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) is the reading comprehension dataset which aims to answer the question given a set of passages. The answer in MS-MARCO is generated by human after reading all related passages and not necessarily sub-spans of the passages.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the existing works on MS-MARCO dataset follow their methods on SQuAD. Wang & Jiang (2016b) combine match-LSTM and pointer networks to produce the boundary of the answer. Xiong et al. (2016) and Seo et al. (2016) employ variant co-attention mechanism to match the question and passage mutually. Xiong et al. (2016) propose a dynamic pointer network to iteratively infer the answer. Wang et al. (2017) apply an additional gate to the attention-based recurrent networks and propose a self-matching mechanism for aggregating evidence from the whole passage, which achieves the state-of-the-art result on SQuAD dataset. Other works which only focus on the SQuAD dataset can also be applied on the MS-MARCO dataset. Yu et al. (2016) and Lee et al. (2016) solve SQuAD by ranking continuous text spans within passage. Yang et al. (2016) present a fine-grained gating mechanism to dynamically combine word-level and character-level representation and model the interaction between questions and passages.\nThe sequence-to-sequence model is widely-used in many tasks such as machine translation (Luong et al., 2015), parsing (Vinyals et al., 2015b), summarization generation (Zhou et al., 2017) and response generation (Gu et al., 2016). In this work, we use it to generate the synthetic answer based on a encoder incorporated with evidence features and an attention-based decoder."

      "text" : "Following the flowchart in Figure 1, our approach consists of two parts as evidence extraction1 and answer generation. The evidence extraction part aims to extract evidence snippets related to the question and passage. We use the gated attention recurrent neural network to match the question and passage, and then use pointer networks to predict the boundary of evidence snippets. The answer generation part is to generate the final answer based on the evidence snippets using a sequence-tosequence model. We annotate the boundary of extracted evidence snippets as the additional feature in the encoding part and apply an attention-equipped decoder for the final answer."

      "text" : "Consider a question Q = {wQt }mt=1 and a passage P = {wPt }nt=1, we first convert the words to their respective word-level embeddings and character-level embeddings. The character-level embeddings are generated by taking the final hidden states of a bi-directional GRU applied to embeddings of characters in the token. We then use a bi-directional GRU to produce new representation uQ1 , . . . , u Q m and uP1 , . . . , u P n of all words in the question and passage respectively:\nuQt = BiGRUQ(u Q t−1, [e Q t , c Q t ])\nuPt = BiGRUP (u P t−1, [e P t , c P t ]) (2)\nGiven question and passage representation {uQt }mt=1 and {uPt }nt=1, Rocktäschel et al. (2015) propose generating sentence-pair representation {vPt }nt=1 via soft-alignment of words in the question and passage as follows:\nvPt = GRU(v P t−1, ct) (3)\nwhere ct = att(uQ, [uPt , v P t−1]) is an attention-pooling vector of the whole question (u Q):\nstj = v Ttanh(WQu u Q j +W P u u P t +W P v v P t−1)\nati = exp(s t i)/Σ m j=1exp(s t j)\nct = Σ m i=1a t iu Q i (4)\nEach passage representation vPt dynamically incorporates aggregated matching information from the whole question.\nWang & Jiang (2016a) introduce match-LSTM, which takes uPj as an additional input into the recurrent network. Wang et al. (2017) add another gate to the input ([uPt , ct]) of RNN to determine the importance of passage parts.\ngt = sigmoid(Wg[u P t , ct]) [uPt , ct] ∗ = gt [uPt , ct]\nvPt = GRU(v P t−1, [u P t , ct]) (5)\nWe follow the mainstream approaches that answer the question by predicting the start and end positions in the passage using pointer networks (Vinyals et al., 2015a). Given the passage representation {vPt }nt=1, the attention mechanism is utilized as a pointer to select the start position (p1) and end position (p2) from the passage, which can be formulated as follows:\nstj = v Ttanh(WPh v P j +W a h h a t−1)\nati = exp(s t i)/Σ n j=1exp(s t j)\npt = argmax(at1, . . . , a t n) (6)\nHere hat−1 represents the last hidden state of the answer recurrent network (pointer network). The input of the answer recurrent network is the attention-pooling vector based on current predicted probability at:\nct = Σ n i=1a t iv P i\nhat = GRU(h a t−1, ct) (7)\nWhen predicting the start position, hat−1 represents the initial hidden state of the answer recurrent network. We utilize the question vector rQ as the initial state of the answer recurrent network. rQ = att(uQ, V Qr ) is an attention-pooling vector of the question based on the parameter V Q r :\nsj = v Ttanh(WQu u Q j +W Q v V Q r )\nai = exp(si)/Σ m j=1exp(sj)\nrQ = Σmi=1aiu Q i (8)\nFor this part, the objective function is to minimize the following cross entropy:\nLAP = −Σ2t=1ΣNi=1[yti log ati + (1− yti) log(1− ati)] (9) where yti ∈ {0, 1} denotes a label. yti = 1 means i is a correct position, otherwise yti = 0."

      "heading" : "3.3 ANSWER GENERATION",
      "text" : "We first produce the representation hPt and h Q t of all words in the passage and question respectively. When producing the answer representation, we combine the basic word embedding with an additional feature to indicate the start and end positions of the evidence snippet predicted by evidence extraction model.\nhPt = BiGRU(h P t−1, [e p t , f p t ])\nhQt = BiGRU(h Q t−1, e Q t ) (10)\nOn top of the encoder, we use GRU with attention as the decoder to produce the answer. At each decoding time step t, the GRU reads the previous word embeddingwt−1 and previous context vector ct−1 as inputs to compute the new hidden state dt. To initialize the GRU hidden state, we use a linear layer with the last backward encoder hidden state ~h P 1 and ~h Q 1 as input:\ndt = GRU(wt−1, ct−1, dt−1)\nd0 = tanh(Wd[ ~h P 1 , ~h Q 1 ] + b) (11)\nwhere Wd is the weight matrix and b is the bias vector.\nThe context vector ct for current time step t is computed through the concatenate attention mechanism (Luong et al., 2015), which matches the current decoder state dt with each encoder hidden state\nht to get an importance score. Here hi consists of the answer representation hPt and the question representation hPt . The importance scores are then normalized to get the current context vector by weighted sum:\nstj = v T a tanh(Wadt−1 + Uahj)\nati = exp(s t i)/Σ n j=1exp(s t j)\nct = Σ n i=1a t ihi (12)\nWe then combine the previous word embedding wt−1, the current context vector ct, and the decoder state dt to construct the readout state rt. The readout state is then passed through a maxout hidden layer (Goodfellow et al., 2013) to predict the next word with a softmax layer over the decoder vocabulary.\nrt = Wrwt−1 + Urct + Vrdt\nmt = [max{rt,2j−1, rt,2j}]T\np(yt|y1, . . . , yt−1) = softmax(Womt) (13)\nwhere Wa, Ua, Wr, Ur, Vr and Wo are parameters to be learned. Readout state rt is a 2ddimensional vector, and the maxout layer (Equation 13) picks the max value for every two numbers in rt and produces a d-dimensional vector mt.\nOur goal is to maximize the output probability given the input sentence. Therefore, we optimize the negative log-likelihood loss function:\nLAG = − 1\n|D| Σ(x,y)∈D log p(y|x) (14)\nwhere D denotes the gold answer."

      "heading" : "4.5 DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "We compare the result of answer extraction and answer generation in different synthetic categories in Table 4 with several examples in Table 5. For the questions whose answers can be exactly matched in the passage, our answer generation model performs slightly worse because the sequence-to-sequence model makes some deviation when copying extracted evidence. However, in other categories, our generation model achieves more or less improvement. We can observe that the largest category in the rest questions is to refine the extracted evidence. In the first example in Table 5, our generation model adds “it” to the extracted snippet to synthesize the answer, which makes the syntax of the sentence complete. In the next two examples, we find that the generation model is good at controlling the boundary of the answer. In the fourth example, the generation model refines the extracted answer by considering words in the question. The last example focuses on the inference question. The extraction model cannot answer the question because there is no “yes” in the passage even though it successfully detects the related snippets. Our generation model can easily solve this problem and give the correct answer through the extracted evidence. We do not handle the questions that contain multiple evidence and leave it to the future work.\nMoreover, we observe that our method only achieves significant improvement in terms of ROUGE-L compared with our baseline. In the official evaluation tool, the ROUGE-L is calculated by averaging the scores per question, however, the BLEU is normalized with all questions. We argue that the answer should be evaluated case-by-case in the scenario of question answering. By analyzing our answer generation model, we well solve the questions in the category of inference. However, in these questions the answers are too short to influence the final score in the official evaluation in terms of BLEU."

      "heading" : "5 CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "In this paper, we introduce S-Net, an extraction-then-generation framework for machine reading comprehension. The extraction model aims to match the question and passage to predict most important sub-spans in the passage related to the question as evidence. Then, the generation model synthesizes the final answer from the question information and the evidence snippet. We use gated attention recurrent neural networks and pointer networks for evidence extraction, and use the sequence-tosequence model for answer generation. We conduct experiments on the MS-MARCO dataset. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms pure answer extraction model and other existing methods. This work can be advanced from different perspectives. Specifically, we are working on models to improve the other synthetic categories with the special focus on the category of refining evidence snippets.\nQ: what term is tranquility P : tranquillity (also spelled tranquility) is the quality or state of being tranquil; meaning calmness, serenity, and worry-free. maps have been produced for the whole of england that show the tranquillity score of ordnance survey grid derived 500m x 500m squares.

We build the answer extraction model with state-of-the-art neural networks for reading comprehension, and the answer generation model with sequence-to-sequence neural networks.
