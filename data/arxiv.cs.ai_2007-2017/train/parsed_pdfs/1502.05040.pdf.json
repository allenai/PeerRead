      "text" : "Information fusion is an advanced research area which can assist decision makers in\nenhancing their decisions. This paper aims at designing a new multi-layer framework that can support the process of performing decisions from the obtained beliefs using information fusion. Since it is not an easy task to cross the gap between computed beliefs of certain hypothesis and decisions, the proposed framework consists of the following layers in order to provide a suitable architecture (ordered bottom up):\n1. A layer for combination of basic belief assignments using an information fusion approach. Such approach exploits Dezert-Smarandache Theory,\nDSmT, and proportional conflict redistribution to provide more realistic final beliefs.\n2. A layer for computation of pignistic probability of the underlying propositions from the corresponding final beliefs.\n3. A layer for performing probabilistic reasoning using a Bayesian network that can obtain the probable reason of a proposition from its pignistic\nprobability.\n4. Ranking the system decisions is ultimately used to support decision making.\nA case study has been accomplished at various operational conditions in order to\nprove the concept, in addition it pointed out that:\n1. The use of DSmT for information fusion yields not only more realistic beliefs but also reliable pignistic probabilities for the underlying\npropositions.\n2. Exploiting the pignistic probability for the integration of the information fusion with the Bayesian network provides probabilistic inference and\nenable decision making on the basis of both belief based probabilities for the underlying propositions and Bayesian based probabilities for the corresponding reasons.\nA comparative study of the proposed framework with respect to other information fusion systems confirms its superiority to support decision making.\nKeywords\nInformation Fusion, Bayesian networks, Belief combination, Pignistic Probability, Decision Making."

      "text" : "The fusion of information arises in many fields of applications nowadays\n(especially in defense, medicine, finance, geo-science, economy, etc). To deal with the challenges of such applications an Information Fusion and Probabilistic Decision Making Framework has been designed to cross the large gap between beliefs and decision making. At the bottom layer of such framework we use DSmT for information fusion that yields not only more realistic beliefs but also reliable pignistic probabilities for the underlying propositions. The second layer performs the pignistic probability, BetP{.}, computation. Such BetP{.} is used for the integration of the information fusion with the Bayesian network that occupies the third layer. Such architecture provides probabilistic inference and enables decision making on the basis of both belief based probabilities for the underlying propositions and Bayesian based probabilities for the corresponding reasons Figure (1).\nActually the proposed framework builds up smoothly a probability structure that\ncan be passed to the higher layer. The event (observation) of highest probability is passed to the higher layer where a Bayesian network can provide probabilistic reasoning [Weise et al., 1993]. For convenience, this approach is used to perform reasoning rather than using descriptive logic or a truth maintenance technique. Finally the decisions at the human computer interface are ranked rather than being expressed flat in order to support the decision maker.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the related work to the\nproposed framework, while section 3 presents the problem statement. Setion 4 expresses the architecture of the proposed framework. Section 5 presents the pignistic probability transformation. Section 6 discusses the probabilistic reasoning using Bayesian network. Section 7 discusses the results of an experimental case study. Finally, section 8 comprises the conclusion."

      "text" : "Information fusion (IF) is defined as the combination of data from disparate sources\nto produce an outcome that is superior to any provided by an individual source. An outcome typically includes an improvement in accuracy, higher confidence through complementary information, or improved performance in the presence of countermeasures [Blasch et al., 2002]. IF can occur on multiple levels [Klein, 2004]. Sensor-level fusion is the level at which relevant data is extracted from the source signal. Feature-level fusion is the combination of data to produce a composite feature vector that characterizes the object under test. Decision-level fusion is the layer that provides a projection of a future state of the object based on the feature vector provided, and the information presented to an operator to facilitate a human decision."

It is the expectation of the authors that the appropriate synergy of these two approaches may bring satisfactory results when fusing diverse types of information originated from miscellaneous sensors. For this reason a concept of the combination of these two approaches has been presented and a comparison of hard-decision fusion, DSmT fusion and a combination of DSmT and ontology fusion algorithms has been established.\nThe authors of [Sumari et al., 2008] have designed and implemented a hierarchical\nmulti-agent based information fusion system for decision making. The information fusion is implemented by applying a maximum score of the total sum of joint probabilities and is done by a collection of Information Fusion Agents (IFA) that forms a multiagent system. Information fusion products are displayed in graphical forms to provide comprehensive information regarding the military operation. By observing the graphics resulted from the information fusion, the commandant will have situational awareness and knowledge in order to make the most accurate strategic decision as fast as possible."

The combination of priority vectors corresponding to bba’s related to each sub-criterion is performed using the Proportional Conflict Redistribution, PCR, which has been proposed in [Dezert et al., 2011] forplausible and paradoxical reasoning. The method presented, called DSmT-AHP, is illustrated on simple examples.\nThe multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem concerns the elucidation of\nthe level of preferences of decision alternatives through judgments made over a number of criteria [Beynon, 2005]. At the Decision-maker (DM) level, a useful method for solving MCDM problem must take into account opinions made under uncertainty and based on distinct criteria with different importance. Among the interesting solutions of MCDM problem there is the work made by [Beynon, 2005]. This work includes a method called DS/AHP which extended the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method of Saaty [Saaty, 1990] with Dempster- Shafer Theory (DST) of belief functions so that it can take into account uncertainty and to manage the conflicts between expert’s opinions within a hierarchical model approach.\nThe authors of [Smarandache et al., 2009] have investigated the possibility to use\n(DSmT) of plausible and paradoxical reasoning for overcoming DST limitations. Their approach is referred to as DSmT-AHP method. In this case, DSmT allows managing efficiently the fusion of quantitative (or qualitative) uncertain and possibly highly conflicting sources of evidences and proposes new methods for belief computation."

Nowadays, there is a possibility to access an increasing amount of information and in some cases to make use of all that information to be able to make an informed and successful decision.

This generalized pignistic transformation (GPT) is defined by equation (2):\n∀A ∈ DΘ, BetP{A} = m(X)\nWhere CM(X) denotes the DSm cardinal of proposition X for the DSm model M of\nthe problem under consideration. The decision about the solution of the problem is usually taken by the maximum of pignistic probability function BetP{.}.\nIt has been proven in that BetP{A} is a subjective probability measure satisfying\nthe following axioms of the probability theory:\n• Axiom 1 (nonnegative): The (generalized pignistic) probability of any event A is\nbounded by 0 and 1, i.e. 0 ≦ P{A} ≦ 1\n• Axiom 2 (unity): Any sure event (the sample space) has unity (generalized pignistic) probability, i.e. P{S} = 1\n• Axiom 3 (additively over mutually exclusive events): If A, B are disjoint (i.e.\nA∩B = ) then P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B)\n5.1The DSm cardinality\nOne important notion involved in the definition of the generalized pignistic\ntransformation (GPT) is the DSm cardinality [Dezert, 2003]. The DSm cardinality of any element A ∈ DΘ, denoted , corresponds to the number of parts of A in the Venn diagram of the problem (model M) taking into account the set of integrity constraints (if any), i.e. all the possible intersections due to the nature of the elements θi. This intrinsic cardinality depends on the model M (free, hybrid or Shafer’s model). M is the model that\n∈\nFigure (2) Process model of the proposed framework\ncontains A, which depends both on the dimension n = |Θ| and on the number of parts of non-empty intersections present in its associated Venn diagram.

Actually is easy to compute by programming from the algorithm of generation of D Θ [Dezert, 2003]. If one imposes a constraint that a set B from D Θ is empty (i.e. we choose a hybrid model), then one suppresses the columns corresponding to the parts which compose B in the matrix Dn and the row of B and the rows of all elements of D Θ which are subsets of B, getting a new matrix Dʹn which represents a new hybrid model M ʹ."

However, in many situations such probability is not sufficient for the application user. For instance, if the application is medical it will represent the probability of a ‘symptom’, as advised by multiple experts but we still have the question: what is the probability of the ‘disease’, which caused such symptom?\nThe question is answered in the proposed framework model by making use of a\nBayesian Network, BN, to represent the dependencies among variables in order to provide a concise specification of any joint probability distribution. The underlying BN takes the pignistic probability of an event as input and computes a corresponding expectation probability depending on both its topology and the conditional probability tables.\nA BN as a directed graph, in which each node is annotated with quantitative\nprobability information could perform the reasoning process. The full specification of BN is as follows:\n1- A set of random variables makes up the nodes of the network. Variables may be discrete or continuous.\n2- A set of directed links or arrows connects pairs of nodes. If there is an arrow from node X to node Y, X is said to be a parent of Y.\n3- Each node X, has a conditional probability distribution P(X | Parents(X)) that quantities the effect of the parents on the node.\n4- The graph has no directed cycles and hence is a directed, acyclic graph, or DAG).\nThe topology of the network specifies the conditional independence relationships\nthat hold in the domain. The intuitive meaning of an arrow in a properly constructed network is usually that X has a direct influence on Y. It is usually easy for a domain expert to decide what direct influences exist in the domain- much easier, in fact, than actually specifying the probabilities themselves.\nOnce the topology of the Bayesian network is laid out, we need only to specify a\nconditional probability distribution for each variable, given its parents. Here the combination of the topology and the conditional distributions suffices to specify the full joint distribution for all the variables. Eventually, the output of BN is passed to the user interface in prder to support his current decisions."

Since the data has the constraint hat both E and F are related and could cooperate with each otheras well as E and R are similarly related (intersected) then the DSm hybrid model, is applicable rather than Shafer’s model. By considering the two information sources, S1 and S2 and applying the semantic network module on both of them, we could construct:\nTable (2) Basic belief assignment (bba’s) for stage 1\nE F G\nm(S1) 0.51 0.49 0.0\nm(S2) 0.52 0.0 0.48\nWhere m (Si), i=1, 2 represents the basic belief assignment (bba’s), of the underlying information source.\n Application of the hybrid model: The choice of the DSm hybrid model allows some propositional intersections, while others are empty. Here E∩F≠ , while E ∩ G = E ∩ U = F ∩ G = R ∩ U = , as well as all unions are not included. Then we performed the classic DSm rule in order to obtain the classic beliefs and , Table (3).

The BN consists of the probable mediator as an input node, the ability to take the decision to be a mediator as intermediate nodes and the motivating cause as the\n∈\noutput node as shown in Figure (5). That figure indicates that, at the beginning both the political and the military motivations have equal probabilities (0.5) for both true and false causes. However, when mediator E is introduced with its highest pignistic probability value, the corresponding causes are changed to be political motivation with true and false values (0.973, 0.027) while the military motivation is decayed to (0.08, 0.92) respectively."

Such framework consistes of the following layers:\n1. A layer that contains a belief computation agent for estimating the basic belief assignments.\n2. A layer for combination of basic belief assignments using an information fusion approach. Such approach exploits Dezert-Smarandache Theory, DSmT, and\nproportional conflict redistribution to provide more realistic final beliefs.\n3. A layer for computation of pignistic probability of the underlying propositions from the corresponding final beliefs.\n4. A layer for performing probabilistic reasoning using a Bayesian network that can obtain the probable reason of a proposition from its pignistic probability.\n5. A layer for ranking the system decisions is ultimately used to support decision making.\nA case study is investigated in details. It has proved the concept of the proposed\nframework and indicated the following:\n1. The use of DSmT for information fusion yields not only more realistic beliefs but also reliable pignistic probabilities for the underlying propositions.\n2. Making use of pignistic probabilities to integrate information fusion and the Bayesian network. By this way we could provide probabilistic inference and\nenable decision making that exploits both belief based probabilities for the underlying propositions and conditional probabilities of BN for finding out the corresponding reasons.\n3. A divide and conquer approach can considerably reduce the problem size. Such approach can transfer a problem with impractical large size due to large number\nof focal elements to a set of familiar 3D subproblems that can be easily tackled with reasonable time and space costs.\nA comparative study with respect to other information fusion systems has pointed\nout the significance of the proposed framework which makes it able to outperform similar decision making systems.\nReferences\n[Beynon, 2005] M.

    "abstractText" : "Information fusion is an advanced research area which can assist decision makers in enhancing their decisions. This paper aims at designing a new multi-layer framework that can support the process of performing decisions from the obtained beliefs using information fusion. Since it is not an easy task to cross the gap between computed beliefs of certain hypothesis and decisions, the proposed framework consists of the following layers in order to provide a suitable architecture (ordered bottom up): 1. A layer for combination of basic belief assignments using an information fusion approach. Such approach exploits Dezert-Smarandache Theory, DSmT, and proportional conflict redistribution to provide more realistic final beliefs. 2. A layer for computation of pignistic probability of the underlying propositions from the corresponding final beliefs. 3. A layer for performing probabilistic reasoning using a Bayesian network that can obtain the probable reason of a proposition from its pignistic probability. 4. Ranking the system decisions is ultimately used to support decision making. A case study has been accomplished at various operational conditions in order to prove the concept, in addition it pointed out that: 1. The use of DSmT for information fusion yields not only more realistic beliefs but also reliable pignistic probabilities for the underlying propositions. 2. Exploiting the pignistic probability for the integration of the information fusion with the Bayesian network provides probabilistic inference and enable decision making on the basis of both belief based probabilities for the underlying propositions and Bayesian based probabilities for the corresponding reasons.
