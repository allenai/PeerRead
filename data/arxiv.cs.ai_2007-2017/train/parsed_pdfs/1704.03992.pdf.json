      "text" : "As a contrast, in this paper, we treat the data-fitting problem over the network as a stochastic programming problem with many constraints. By adapting the results in a recent paper [18], we design a fully distributed and asynchronized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. We show that our algorithm can achieve global optimality and consensus asymptotically by only local computations and communications. Additionally, we provide a sharp lower bound for the convergence speed in the regular graph case. This result fits the intuition and provides guidance to design a ‘good’ network topology to speed up the convergence. Also, the merit of our design is validated by experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\nI. INTRODUCTION As one of the most important optimization algorithms, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and many of its variants have been proposed to solve different optimization problems, and are gaining their popularity in this ‘big-data’ era [4]. Popular examples include SVM, Logistic Regression for the convex cases [5], and deep neural networks for the non-convex cases [8]. It can be shown that, for the basic version of SGD, the asymptotic convergence rate is O(1/ √ T ) for the general convex problems and O(1/T ) for the strict convex problems, where T is the number of iterations.\nNowadays, data is generated and collected at a higher speed due to the wide use of Internet, mobile devices, sensor networks, etc. The basic version\nThe author is with Department of Information Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nof SGD suffers from its nature of sequentially processing the data and is still too slow. To handle this issue, distributed versions of SGD have been tried by many practioneer [8], [16] and analyzed by theoretical researchers [11], [13], [17].\nIn most of the current literature, the ‘distributed’ SGD is usually performed by a ’one-Server multiple-Worker’ mode, as shown in Fig. 1(a), where the workers access the data distributedly and the server acts as a coordinator among all workers. In practice, the ‘server’ and the workers can be many computers, connected by a computer network, like the design of the ‘parameter-server’ [12]; also, the ‘server’ can be the shared memory of one computer and the workers can be different threads, like the design of ’Hogwild!’ [17]. To optimized the variable (training process), in each iteration, each worker will take some data samples to update their local variable and upload the information to the server; after receiving the new local variables from all workers, the server will perform a update, according to some requirements like budget limitation, and then broadcast the new variable to all workers. Intuitively speaking, the server exists so that all workers will be aware of the global information and the local variables of different workers will not deviate from each other too much.\nHowever, the performance of the ‘server-worker’ structure is inevitably limited by at least two factors. Firstly, due to the existence of ‘central controller’, the system is actually semi-distributed. It is uneasy to scale up to too many workers. For example, it may need complicated design and advanced systems to handle tens of thousands of workers. Also, this kind of system is not so robust. For example, if the server breaks down, the entire system also fails to work. Secondly, synchronization among all workers is needed in the process. However, synchronization is difficult to achieve considering the heterogeneous and time-varying performances of different workers, especially when the number of workers is large. In\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n03 99\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n3 A\npr 2\n01 7\n2 practice, the late workers are simply ignored, which is equivalent to introducing noise and performance is thus degraded. In a recent work [13], the authors show that, for the ‘server-worker’ structure, an asynchronized dual-based algorithm can achieve O(1/ √ T ) convergence rate.\nIn this paper, we propose a SGD scheme for a general networked system, in which many nodes are connected by a general undirected graph, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In this system, each node can represent a computing unit, like one computer of a cluster, one user of online social network, or one sensor of wireless sensor network. We assume that each node can access the data and do some local computation, but communications can only happens between directly connected nodes (the node and its neighbors). We design an update method without relying on any controller to achieve global optimality and consensus. More specifically, the local variables stored by each node will asymptotically converge to the same value, which is the optimal value to minimize the total expected loss of all nodes.\nIn particular, we make the following contributions. • We reformulate the single-variable data-fitting\nproblem of a networked system as a multiplevariable problem with multiple constraints, which ensure global consensus. • By apply the result of the recent paper on stochastic optimization problem with many constraints [18], we design an algorithm for the reformulated optimization problem. The algorithm is essentially distributed and asynchronized. Both the global consensus and optimality can be asymptotically achieved. • We analyze the convergence speed of algorithm for a special structure: the regular graph. Our analysis indicates a not so surprising result: the algorithm will converge faster for a graph with better connectivity. • By simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the merit of our design and test the impact of different system settings."

      "text" : "We consider a scenario in which N computing nodes are connected as a graph. We have one optimization variable β as a vector, and the loss of Node i by β is denoted as f̄i(β). One example is\nthat Node i has many training data samples, and f̄i(β) =\n1 Ki ∑ k li(β, vk) is the averaged loss of\neach sample vk. We assume that f̄i(·) is a convex function. With one data sample being vk = (xk, yk), such a model can capture many popular examples as special cases, like • Logistic Regression:\nf̄i(β) = 1\nKi Ki∑ k=1\n[ yk\n1\n1 + e−βT xk + (1− yk)\ne−β T xk\n1 + e−βT xk\n] .\n• Support Vector Machine:\nf̄i(β) = 1\nKi Ki∑ k=1 max{0, 1− ykβTxk}+ λβ2.\n• Lasso:\nf̄i(β) = 1\n2Ki Ki∑ k=1 (yk − βTxk)2 + λ‖β‖.\nOur interest is to find one optimal solution to minimize the total loss of all nodes, i.e., solving\nmin 1\nN N∑ i=1 f̄i(β). (1)\nIn this paper, instead of using the empirical loss, we consider minimizing a expected loss function fi(β) = E [li(β, Vi)], where the expectation is taken according to the distribution of Vi 1. Vi is the random variable to generate a data sample in Node i. So our optimization problem is further casted as as a stochastic programming in the following form,\nmin F (β) = 1\nN ∑ i fi(β). (2)\nRemarks: (1) f̄i(β) can be viewed as an empirical replacement of fi(β). By law of large numbers, the difference between two functions will converge to 0 if the number of data samples in Node i goes to infinity. (2) Suppose we have one random variable V to generate all data samples. We can have another perspective to interpret the objective function F (β) of Problem. (2): V has probability 1\nN to take the\ndistribution of that of Vi, and at the same time, the loss function will take the form of li(·, ·).\nTo summarize, we have an optimization problem with a single variable β to minimize the expected\n1Note that we can assume that Vi and Vj can follow different distributions if i 6= j.\n3 (a) Server-Worker Structure (b) Networked Structure (discussed in this paper)\nFig. 1.

The stochastic programming problem with convex objective functions has been extensively studied in the literature, and many off-the-shelf algorithm can be used, see [18] and the reference therein. However, most of works consider centralized design and are not applicable to the networked system. The results in [3], [14], [15] also consider to minimize an objective function over a networked system, but the algorithms require all nodes to perform update in each slot and synchronization is needed for realworld implementation, which, however, is difficult to achieve. In the next section, we will present our design to tackle this issue."

X ∈ X1 ∩ X2 ∩ · · · ∩ XM ,\nand proposed several algorithms based on randomly sampling and projection. We recall one of them below,\nAlgorithm 1 An algorithm to solve GenPro Require: An oracle to generate data sample, k = 1, X0, stepsize αt, t = 1, 2, · · · ,∞ Ensure: An optimal solution X∗ to GenPro\n1: while not converge do 2: Generate one data sample vk and compute the\nsubgradient g(Xk, vk) with current variable Xk and data sample vk.\n3: Update current variable Xk+1 = Xk − αkg(Xk, vk). 4: Randomly pick one constraint Xm, and make the projection Xk+1 = ΠXm(Xk+1). 5: k = k + 1 6: end while 7: X∗ = Xk 8: return X∗.\nIn Alg. 1, ΠXm(·) is a projection operator and ΠXm(x) = arg miny∈Xm ‖y − x‖F . Even though only simple gradient descent and projection are performed in each iteration, it can be proved that the algorithm will converge to a optimal solution, i.e., the objective value will converge to the optimal\n4 value and the distance from the variable to the feasible region will converge to 0.\nWe denote the optimization variable β as a concentration of original local variables, i.e.,\nβ = [β1, β2, · · · , βN ]\nand Bn = {β|βn = βk,∀k ∈ Nn} as one convex set. The optimization problem we are interested in can be written in a more compact fact as\nOurPro min β\n1\nN N∑ i=1 fi(βi)\ns.t. β ∈ B1 ∩ B2 ∩ · · · ∩ BN .(5)\nNow our problem are put into a form that is suitable for Alg. 1, so we can directly apply the algorithm. Now we will examine the gradient descent and projection steps in details. a) Gradient Descent: To randomly generate a data sample, we can firstly randomly select a node i and generate a sample vki according to the distribution of Vi. Note that under the condition node i is selected, the loss of other nodes with vki is zero. So the sampled subgradient of the objective function is nonzero only for βi and can be written as 1\nN ∂fi(βi)/∂βi. Thus the gradient descent can be\nperformed by{ βk+1i = β k i − αk 1N ∂li(β k i , v k i )/∂β k i ,\nβk+1n = β k n, for n 6= i.\n(6)\nWe can see that if a data sample is generated locally in Node i, only local update is needed to perform gradient descent. b) Projection: If one convex set, say Bm, is randomly selected, we would need to project the current variable [ βk+11 , β k+1 2 , · · · , βk+1N ] onto it. Bm requires that the local variables stored in node m and its neighbors are equal. To find a new point satisfy this condition and minimize the distance between the new point and original point, the values of the variables stored in node m and its neighbors should take the averaged value among them and the values of other variables should stay the same. Thus the projection can be performed by{ βk+1i = 1 1+|Nm| ∑ l∈{m}∪Nm β k l , ∀i ∈ {m} ∪ Nm,\nβk+1j = β k j , for other node j. (7) We can also see that the projection process only involves one node and its neighbors. Specifically,\none node collects the local information from its neighbors, calculates the average and then makes a broadcast to its neighbors.\nWe summarize the above procedure to solve OurPro in Alg. 2 to end this part.\nAlgorithm 2 An algorithm to solve OurPro Require: An oracle to generate data sample, k = 1, β0, stepsize αt, t = 1, 2, · · · ,∞ Ensure: An optimal solution X∗ to OurPro\n1: while not converge do 2: Randomly select a node i, and then generate a random variable r from 0 to 1. 3: if r ≤ 0.5 then 4: Generate one data sample vkm and up-\ndate the local variable by βk+1m = β k m − αk 1 N ∂lm(β k m, v k m)/∂β k m.\n5: else 6: Collect information from its neighbors\nand make a broadcast so that βk+1i = 1 1+|Nm| ∑ l∈{m}∪Nm β k l , ∀i ∈ {m} ∪ Nm\n7: end if 8: k = k + 1 9: end while\n10: β∗ = βk 11: return β∗."

Unless otherwise mentioned, we will assume that the objective function satisfies Assumption 1 in [18] and stepsizes are set properly. For a concise presentation, we use DF (βk) as the distance from the current optimization variable to the feasible region B1 ∩ B2 ∩ · · · ∩ BN 2 and DO(βk) as the distance from the current optimization variable to the optimal region.\nTheorem 1: (Feasibility and Optimality) [18] Both DF (βk) and DO(βk) will converge to zero almost surely.\nWe also provide the asymptotic convergence speed in the following theorem.\n2It should be noted that this region is a polyhedron and can be characterized by linear constraints.\n5 Theorem 2: (Convergence Speed) [18] We can have\nE[DF (βk+1)] ≤ (1− C 4 )DF (βk) + σ(5 + 4 C )α2k,\n(8)\nand\nE[DO(βk+1)]\n≤DO(βk) + σ(5 + 2 C )α2k − 2αk(F (Π(βk)− F ∗), (9)\nwhere σ is a constant determined by the objective function, αk is the stepsize, and C = ηN (η is the value for the linear regularity condition for the feasible region (5). 3).\nWe omit the proofs of Theorem 1 and 2 since they are established directly from the results in [18] (on Page 9 and Page 10), but we want to provide some results specifically related to our problem. Note from Theorem 2 that a larger value of C will lead to faster convergence. On the one hand, C will be larger if this network contains less nodes (N is smaller), which is intuitive. On the other hand, a larger value η will also help the algorithm to converge faster. We provide some results for more insights below.\nFirstly, for a general graph, we define a matrix for local averaging A = [ai,j] where ai,j = 11+|Ni| . The meaning of A can be explained as it computes the new value for one node as the average of the original value of itself and its neighbors.\nLemma 1: For a system connected by a kregular graph, a lower bound for the value of η in Theorem. 2 is given by\n(1− σ22) k + 1\nN ,\nwhere σ2 is a second largest eigenvalue of its averaging matrix A.\nThe proof is deferred in Appendix. B and we provide some remarks to end this part.\nRemarks: (a) Both a larger value of k and a smaller value of N will increase the value of η and thus increase the convergence speed. This phenomenon can be intuitively understood because the algorithm will converge faster for a betterconnected and smaller-scale system. (b) If σ2 is\n3The definition of ‘linear regularity condition’ is provided in the appendix.\nsmaller, the algorithm will also converge faster. Essentially, the second largest singular value of A is another metric to evaluate the ‘connectivity’ of the system. Remember that the mixing rate of the Markov chain is also affected by the second largest eigenvalue of the transition probability matrix. The readers can refer to [6] for more information."

One trivial way to do this is to generate a random integer form 1 to N , and evoke the corresponding node according to this results. However, this method cannot be realized without a central controller. A distributed alternative would be that, we let each node generate a random variable according to a geometric distribution and then count backwards. It will be ‘selected’ when it counts to 0. We can even carefully design the parameter of geometric distributions for different nodes so that the probability for different nodes to be selected is preferred.

However, if two nodes are connected, such updates will introduce some conflicts, say, one node plans to do gradient descent but its neighbor tells him to update according to average. One proper way to handle this issue is that, if one node is ‘selected’, it sends a message to its neighbors for locking up.

Also, the advantage of a better connected system is more clear for a larger system (the number of nodes is larger). The rationale behind this phenomenon can be explained as follows.

This kind of problem can find many real-world applications and has been studied extensively in the literature. However, existing solutions either need a central controller for information sharing or requires slot synchronization among different nodes, which increases the difficulty of practical implementations, especially for a very large and heterogeneous system. As a contrast, in this paper, we treat the data-fitting problem over the network as a stochastic programming problem with many constraints. By adapting the results in a recent paper [18], we design a fully distributed and asynchronized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. We show that our algorithm can achieve global optimality and consensus asymptotically by only local computations and communications. Additionally, we provide a sharp lower bound for the convergence speed in the regular graph case. This result fits the intuition and provides guidance to design a ‘good’ network topology to speed up the convergence. Also, the merit of our design is validated by experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",
