      "text" : "develop a Fuzzy Expert System based on a speech therapy guide. This guide, write in natural language, was formalized using fuzzy logic paradigm. In this manner we obtain a knowledge base with over 150 rules and 19 linguistic variables. All these researches, including expert system validation, are part of TERAPERS project (financed by the National Agency for Scientific Research, Romania).\nIndex Terms — speech therapy, personalized therapy, fuzzy\nexpert system, FCL language, fuzzy logic\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe main objectives of speech therapy expert system\ndevelop by our team are [1]:\n- personalized therapy (the therapy must be in\naccording with child’s problems level, context and possibilities); - speech therapist assistant (the expert system offer\nsome suggestion regarding what exercises are better for a specific moment and from a specific child); - (self) teaching (when system’s conclusion is different\nthat speech therapist’s conclusion the last one must have the knowledge base change possibility).\nII. EXPERT SYSTEM ROLE IN ASSISTED THERAPY\nA full computer based speech therapy system must\ncontain at least following items [2]:\n- monitor program (installed on speech therapist\ncomputer, helps on children data management);\n- expert system (based on children related\ninformation’s obtain a personalized therapy path);\n- exercises set (for cabinet and home use); - home training possibility (exercises on personal\ncomputer or mobile device).\nArchitecture of our developed speech therapy system is\npresented in figure 1.\nMobile device receives exercises (created on speech therapist computer). The role of this device is to create a virtual-operative interface between teacher and child (speech therapy work at home):\n- play exercises in a game manner; - offer real time feedback for child; - realize statistics related at current state of the subject; - implement specific communication protocols. Expert system receives information from monitor program (children personal data and pronunciation scores) and from speech therapist (recalibration of knowledge database). It offers specific information referring to optimum next therapeutically steps (number of training sessions, number of homework, collaboration with specialized doctor, etc).\nIn figure 2 are presented therapeutically steps and\nnecessary distributed knowledge bases [3].\n9 th International Conference on DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION SYSTEMS, Suceava, Romania, May 22-24, 2008\nIn according with [4], speech therapy software can help speech problems diagnostic, can offer a real-time, audiovisual feedback, can improve analyze of child progress and can extend speech therapy at child home. Specific therapy information can be found in:\n- dyslalia therapeutically guides; - speech therapy centers experience; - dyslalia exercises sets; - historical therapy data.\nIII. EXPERT SYSTEM – FUZZY APPROACH\nWith fuzzy approach we can create a better model for speech therapist decisions. Fuzzy logic has ability to create accurate models of reality. It’s not an “imprecise logic”. It’s a logic that can manipulate imprecise aspects of reality. In the latest years, many fuzzy expert systems were developed [5], [6], [7].\nIn the next set of pictures, we present an example of fuzzy inference. There are three input linguistic variables (speech problems level – figure 3, family implication – figure 4 and children age – figure 5) and one output linguistic variable (weekly session number – figure 6). We consider five fuzzy rules and, base on these rules, we illustrate specific fuzzy result (figure 7). If system user wants a crisp value, deffuzification is a good solution (figure 8).\nTo express a number in words, we need a way to translate input numbers into confidences in a fuzzy set of word descriptors, the process of fuzzification. In fuzzy math, that is done by membership functions [8].\nDefuzzification is the reverse process of fuzzification. We have confidences in a fuzzy set of word descriptors, and we wish to convert these into a real number.\nFirst three variables have following representation: speech_problems_level (1.62)\n= {“low”/0.37,”normal”/0.62,”high”/0.0}\nfamily_implication (2.00)\n= {“reduce”/0.0,”moderate”/1.0,”high”/0.0}\nchildren_age (4.50)\n= {“small”/0.25,”medium”/0.5,”big”/0.0}\nWe consider five rules for illustrate the inference steps:\n9 th International Conference on DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION SYSTEMS, Suceava, Romania, May 22-24, 2008\n- IF (speech_problems_level is high) and\n(child_age is medium) and (family_implication is reduce) THEN weekly_session_number is high;\nmin (0.00, 0.50, 0.00) = 0.00 for linguistic term high - IF (speech_problems_level is low) and\n(child_age is small) and (family_implication is moderate) THEN weekly_session_number is low;\nmin (0.37, 0.25, 1.00) = 0.25 for linguistic term low - IF (speech_problems_level is low) and\n(child_age is medium) and (family_implication is moderate) THEN weekly_session_number is low;\nmin (0.37, 0.50, 1.00) = 0.37 for linguistic term low - IF (speech_problems_level is normal) and\n(child_age is small) and (family_implication is moterate)THEN weekly_session_number is normal\nmin (0.62, 0.25, 1.00) = 0.25 for linguistic term normal - IF (speech_problems_level is normal) and\n(child_age is medium) and (family_implication is moderate)THEN weekly_session_number is normal\nmin (0.62, 0.5, 1.00) = 0.50 for linguistic term normal\nFinal confidence coefficients levels are obtained using\nmax function:\n- high = max (0.00) = 0.00 - low = max (0.25, 0.37) = 0.37 - normal = max (0.25, 0.50) = 0.50\nEach linguistic term of output variable has another representation and in this manner is obtained final graphical representation of weekly_session_number variable. If system user wants to get a single output value, then area center of gravity is calculated. In our case (value 1.62), child must participate at one to two session (but two is preferred).\nFor knowledge base representation, we use standard Fuzzy Control Language (FCL). In this approach, variables presented above, has following code representation.\nVAR_INPUT\nspeech_problems_level : REAL; child_age : REAL; family_implication : REAL;\nEND_VAR\nVAR_OUTPUT\nweekly_session_number : REAL;\nEND_VAR\nFUZZIFY speech_problems_level\nTERM low := (0.5, 1) (1, 1) (2,0) ; TERM normal := (1,0) (2, 1) (3,0); TERM high := (2, 0) (3,1) (3.5,1);\nEND_FUZZIFY\nFUZZIFY family_implication\nTERM reduce := 1; TERM moderate := 2; TERM high := 3;\nEND_FUZZIFY\nFUZZIFY child_age\nTERM small := (3,1) (5,0); TERM medium := (4,0) (5,1) (6,0); TERM big := (5.5,0) (7,1) (8,1);\nEND_FUZZIFY\nDEFUZZIFY weekly_session_number\nTERM low := (0.5,1) (1,1) (2,0); TERM normal := (1,0) (2,1) (3,0); TERM high := (2,0) (4,1); ACCU : MAX; METHOD : COG; DEFAULT := 0;\nEND_DEFUZZIFY\nMember functions are represented by specific sets of point (polygonal representation). Following defuzzification methods are available:\n- COG - Centre Of Gravity; - COGS - Centre Of Gravity for Singletons; - COA - Centre Of Area; - LM - Left Most Maximum; - RM - Right Most Maximum.\nOR and AND operators, has different possible formula,\nspecified in FCL file (table I).\n9 th International Conference on DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION SYSTEMS, Suceava, Romania, May 22-24, 2008\nA more detailed view of figure 9 (italic marked class) can\nbe found in table II.\nTABLE II.

We implement over 150 fuzzy rules for control various aspects of personalized therapy (19 variables presented in figure 11). These rules are currently validated by speech therapists and can be modified in a distributed manner.\nFigure 11 – Fuzzy variables used for expert system\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn order to help speech therapist activity, we implement a knowledge database with over 150 rules for 19 variables. Fuzzy approach was elected and a validation interface was implemented.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe must specify that these researches are part of TERAPERS project financed by the National Agency for Scientific Research, Romania, INFOSOC program (contract number: 56-CEEX-II-03/27.07.2006).\nREFERENCES\n[1] Stefan-Gheorghe PENTIUC, Ovidiu SCHIPOR, Mirela DANUBIANU, Doina SCHIPOR, Therapy of Dyslalia Affecting PreScholars.
