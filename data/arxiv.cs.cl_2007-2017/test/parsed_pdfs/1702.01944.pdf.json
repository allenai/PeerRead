Our aim is to develop a modular platform which allows to easily conduct experiments by replacing the modules or adding new features. We obtain the best result in the Opinion Target Extraction (OTE) task (slot 2) using an off-the-shelf sequence labeler. The target polarity classification (slot 3) is addressed by means of a multiclass SVM algorithm which includes lexical based features such as the polarity values obtained from domain and open polarity lexicons. The system obtains accuracies of 0.70 and 0.73 for the restaurant and laptop domain respectively, and performs second best in the out-of-domain hotel, achieving an accuracy of 0.80."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Nowadays Sentiment Analysis is proving very useful for tasks such as decision making and market analysis. The ever increasing interest is also shown in the number of related shared tasks organized: TASS (Villena-Román et al., 2012; Villena-Román et al., 2014), SemEval (Nakov et al., 2013; Pontiki et al., 2014; Rosenthal et al., 2014), or the SemSA Challenge at ESWC20141. Research has also been evolving towards specific opinion elements such as entities or properties of a certain opinion target, which is also known as ABSA. The Semeval\n1http://challenges.2014.eswcconferences.org/index.php/SemSA\n2015 ABSA shared task aims at covering the most common problems in an ABSA task: detecting the specific topics an opinion refers to (slot1); extracting the opinion targets (slot2), combining the topic and target identification (slot1&2) and, finally, computing the polarity of the identified word/targets (slot3). Participants were allowed to send one constrained (no external resources allowed) and one unconstrained run for each subtask. We participated in the slot2 and slot3 subtasks.\nOur main is to develop an ABSA system to be used in the future for further experimentation. Thus, rather than focusing on tuning the different modules our goal is to develop a platform to facilitate future experimentation. The EliXa system consists of three independent supervised modules based on the IXA pipes tools (Agerri et al., 2014) and Weka (Hall et al., 2009). Next section describes the external resources used in the unconstrained systems. Sections 3 and 4 describe the systems developed for each subtask and briefly discuss the obtained results."

Following (Kiritchenko et al., 2014), we manually filtered\n2http://www.yelp.com/dataset challenge\nout categories not corresponding to food related businesses (173 out of 720 were finally selected). A total of 997,721 reviews (117.1M tokens) comprise what we henceforth call the Yelp food corpus (CY elp).\nFor the laptop domain we leveraged a corpus composed of Amazon reviews of electronic devices (Jo and Oh, 2011). Although only 17,53% of the reviews belong to laptop products, early experiments showed the advantage of using the full corpus for both slot 2 and slot 3 subtasks. The Amazon electronics corpus (CAmazon) consists of 24,259 reviews (4.4M tokens). Finally, the English Wikipedia was also used to induce word clusters using word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013)."

      "heading" : "2.2 Polarity Lexicons",
      "text" : "We generated two types of polarity lexicons to represent polarity in the slot3 subtasks: general purpose and domain specific polarity lexicons.\nA general purpose polarity lexicon Lgen was built by combining four well known polarity lexicons: SentiWordnet SWN (Baccianella et al., 2010), General Inquirer GI (Stone et al., 1966), Opinion Finder OF (Wilson et al., 2005) and Liu’s sentiment lexicon Liu (Hu and Liu, 2004). When a lemma occurs in several lexicons, its polarity is solved according to the following priority order: Liu > OF > GI > SWN . The order was set based on the results of (San Vicente et al., 2014). All polarity weights were normalized to a [−1, 1] interval. Polarity categories were mapped to weights for GI (neg+→−0.8; neg→-0.6; neg−→-0.2; pos−→0.2; pos→0.6; pos+→0.8), Liu and OF (neg→-0.7; pos→0.7 for both). In addition, a restricted lexicon Lgenres including only the strongest polarity words was derived from Lgen by applying a threshold of ±0.6.\nDomain specific polarity lexicons LY elp and\nLAmazon were automatically extracted from CY elp and CAmazon reviews corpora. Reviews are rated in a [1..5] interval, being 1 the most negative and 5 the most positive. Using the Log-likelihood ratio (LLR) (Dunning, 1993) we obtained the ranking of the words which occur more with negative and positive reviews respectively. We considered reviews with 1 and 2 rating as negative and those with 4 and 5 ratings as positive. LLR scores were normalized to a [−1, 1] interval and included in LY elp and LAmazon lexicons as polarity weights."

      "text" : "The Opinion Target Extraction task (OTE) is addressed as a sequence labeling problem. We use the ixa-pipe-nerc Named Entity Recognition system3 (Agerri et al., 2014) off-the-shelf to train our OTE models; the system learns supervised models via the Perceptron algorithm as described by (Collins, 2002). ixa-pipe-nerc uses the Apache OpenNLP project implementation of the Perceptron algorithm4 customized with its own features. Specifically, ixa-pipe-nerc implements basic nonlinguistic local features and on top of those a combination of word class representation features partially inspired by (Turian et al., 2010). The word representation features use large amounts of unlabeled data. The result is a quite simple but competitive system which obtains the best constrained and unconstrained results and the first and third best overall results.\nThe local features implemented are: current token and token shape (digits, lowercase, punctuation, etc.) in a 2 range window, previous prediction, beginning of sentence, 4 characters in prefix and suffix, bigrams and trigrams (token and shape). On top of them we induce three types of word representations:\n• Brown (Brown et al., 1992) clusters, taking the 4th, 8th, 12th and 20th node in the path. We induced 1000 clusters on the Yelp reviews dataset described in section 2.1 using the tool implemented by Liang5.\n3https://github.com/ixa-ehu/ixa-pipe-nerc 4http://opennlp.apache.org/ 5https://github.com/percyliang/brown-cluster\n• Clark (Clark, 2003) clusters, using the standard configuration to induce 200 clusters on the Yelp reviews dataset and 100 clusters on the food portion of the Yelp reviews dataset.\n• Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) clusters, based on K-means applied over the extracted word vectors using the skip-gram algorithm6; 400 clusters were induced using the Wikipedia.\nThe implementation of the clustering features looks for the cluster class of the incoming token in one or more of the clustering lexicons induced following the three methods listed above. If found, then we add the class as a feature. The Brown clusters only apply to the token related features, which are duplicated. We chose the best combination of features using 5-fold cross validation, obtaining 73.03 F1 score with local features (e.g. constrained mode) and 77.12 adding the word clustering features, namely, in unconstrained mode. These two configurations were used to process the test set in this task. Table 2 lists the official results for the first 4 systems in the task.\nThe results show that leveraging unlabeled text is helpful in the OTE task, obtaining an increase of 7 points in recall. It is also worth mentioning that our constrained system (using non-linguistic local features) performs very closely to the second best overall system by the NLANGP team (unconstrained). Finally, we would like to point out to the overall low results in this task (for example, compared to the 2014 edition), due to the very small and difficult training set (e.g., containing many short samples such as “Tasty Dog!”) which made it extremely hard to learn good models for this task. The OTE models will be made freely available in the ixa-pipe-nerc website in time for SemEval 2015.\n6https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/"

Although for both restaurant and laptops domains we obtain results over the baseline both performance are modest.\nIn contrast, for the out of domain track, which was evaluated on hotel reviews our system obtains the third highest score. Because of the similarity of the domains, we straightforwardly applied our restaurant domain models. The good results of the con-\nstrained system could mean that the feature combination used may be robust across domains. With respect to the unconstrained system, we suspect that such a good performance is achieved due to the fact that word cluster information was very adequate for the hotel domain, because Cyelp contains a 10.55% of hotel reviews."

Our aim is to develop a modular platform which allows to easily conduct experiments by replacing the modules or adding new features. We obtain the best result in the Opinion Target Extraction (OTE) task (slot 2) using an off-the-shelf sequence labeler. The target polarity classification (slot 3) is addressed by means of a multiclass SVM algorithm which includes lexical based features such as the polarity values obtained from domain and open polarity lexicons. The system obtains accuracies of 0.70 and 0.73 for the restaurant and laptop domain respectively, and performs second best in the out-of-domain hotel, achieving an accuracy of 0.80.",
