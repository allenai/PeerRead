It can be a powerful tool for the preservation of ecological diversity. We investigate probabilistic models to analyse signals issued from real-world bioacoustic sound scenes. We study a Bayesian non-parametric sequential models based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). The model is able to infer hidden states, that are referred here as song units. However, using such a model raise one main issue: defining the number of hidden states the model has to learn. In bioacoustic problems we often do not know the number of song units (unlike in human speech recognition). Hence, we work with the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)-HMM, which is a Bayesian non-parametric (BNP) model that offers a way to tackle this challenging problem. We focus our work on unsupervised learning from bioacoustic data. It consists in simultaneously finding the structure of hidden song units and automatically infer the unknown number of the hidden states to represent the data. Two real bioacoustic sound scene applications are investigated in this work: on whale and multi-species birds segmentation. The learning of these models is proceeded by using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of audio signals. The results show an interesting song unit segmentation of the bioacoustic signals and open new insights for unsupervised analysis of such signals. This paper illustrates the potential of chunking non-human animal signals into structured parts. This can yield to a new species representation and help experts to better understand the behaviour of such species as Kershenbaum et al. (2014) wanted.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The paper is a novel application for the sticky HDP-HMM, focused on correctly identifying the number of components in bird and whale song across a variety of datasets. It's nice to see the model applied to an interesting dataset. My main issues with the paper have to do with structure and the choice of representation used in the model. Namely:\n\nThe organization of the paper could be significantly improved. There is a lot of repetitive introduction that adds little to the paper. The first and last two sentences of the abstract could be cut. Many other parts of the abstract basically repeat the introduction. The second paragraph of section 2.3 also repeats your introduction - by now we know what you're doing. I think most people reading this will have no idea what Kershenbaum (2014) is. The description of the data should go in the experiments section. \"Different hypotheses for the songs were emitted\" in the introduction is odd phrasing. Figure 4 should be the first figure and go in the introduction. Figure 5 should be in the methods section. A summary of Table 1 should be in the experiments section. Generally the writing could be tightened quite a bit, which would make space for these figures. The description of the HDP-HMM, which mostly follows the existing literature, is well done.\n\nSome general questions about the methods used:\n\nIf you're interested in scalable inference, why use Gibbs sampling? Why not the beam sampler (van Gael 2008), which at least recently was the state of the art for MCMC inference in the HDP-HMM? More generally, why use MCMC at all? For very large datasets, most of the Bayesian ML community has converged on stochastic variational inference as the most practical method (eg Wang, Paisley and Blei 2011).\n\nIf your interest is mainly in the number of clusters, how would you address the fact that DP mixture models are known not to be consistent for estimating the true number of clusters (Miller and Harrison 2013)?\n\nMFCC features are calibrated to the human auditory system, not bird or whale auditory systems. In your data, do you calibrate the MFCC scale to be closer to the auditory systems of the animals that generated the song?\n\nAnd a final suggestion for future work, which could use the results presented here as a baseline:\n\nGiven the success of LSTMs in speech recognition in recent years, it may be the case that deep learned representations are superior to linear features (like the means of each cluster in an HDP-HMM) for animal song as well.

My concern for this paper is that it does not have fair comparison of the other simple methods including BIC and AIC, and it is better to provide such comparisons.

The authors applied an existing approach (Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Models) to their task. The originality of their work is the investigation of this approach on a new task, which they argue is more difficult, namely bioacoustic segmentation. They provide evidence that this is a difficult task by explaining that there doesn't exist a consensus among human experts on how this should be done. However, they do not provide convincing results that their approach is successful, as it fails in many cases to replicate the correct segmentations as defined by their baseline: human experts.
