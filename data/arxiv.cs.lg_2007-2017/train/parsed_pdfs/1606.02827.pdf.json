      "text" : "Feature selection is one of the fundamental problems in machine learning research [1, 2]. Many problems include a large number of features that are either irrelevant or redundant for the task at hand. In these cases, it is often advantageous to pick a smaller subset of features to avoid over-fitting, to speed up computation, or simply to improve the interpretability of the results.\nFeature selection approaches are usually categorized into three groups: wrapper, embedded and filter [3, 4, 5]. The first two methods, wrapper and embedded, are considered classifier-dependent, i.e., the selection of features somehow depends on the classifier being used. Filter methods, on the other hand, are classifier-independent and define a scoring function between features and labels in the selection process.\nBecause filter methods may be employed in conjunction with a wide variety of classifiers, it is important that the scoring function of these methods is as general as possible. Since mutual information (MI) is a general measure of dependence with several unique properties [6], many MI-based scoring functions have been proposed as filter methods [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; see [5] for an exhaustive list.\nOwing to the difficulty of estimating mutual information in high dimensions, most existing MI-based feature selection methods are based on various low-order approximations for mutual information. While those approximations have been successful in certain applications, they are heuristic in nature and lack theoretical guarantees. In fact, as we demonstrate below (Sec. 2.2), a large family of approximate methods are based on two assumptions that are mutually inconsistent.\nTo address the above shortcomings, in this paper we introduce a novel feature selection method based on variational lower bound on mutual information; a similar bound was previously studied within the Infomax learning framework [13]. We show that instead of maximizing the mutual information, which is intractable in high dimensions (hence the introduction of many heuristics), we can maximize a lower bound on the MI with the proper choice of tractable variational distributions. We use this lower bound to define an objective function and derive a forward feature selection algorithm.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n02 82\n7v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n9 J\nun 2\n01 6\nWe provide a rigorous proof that the forward feature selection is optimal under tree graphical models by choosing an appropriate variational distribution. This is in contrast with previous informationtheoretic feature selection methods, which lack any performance guarantees. We also conduct empirical validation on various datasets and demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms stateof-the-art information-theoretic feature selection methods.\nIn Sec. 2 we introduce general MI-based feature selection methods and discuss their limitations. Sec. 3 introduces the variational lower bound on mutual information and proposes two specific variational distributions. In Sec. 4, we report results from our experiments, and compare the proposed approach with existing methods."

      "text" : "Consider a supervised learning scenario where x = {x1,x2, ...,xD} is a D-dimensional input feature vector, and y is the output label. In filter methods, the mutual information-based feature selection task is to select T features xS∗ = {xf1 ,xf2 , ...,xfT } such that the mutual information between xS∗ and y is maximized. Formally,\nS∗ = argmax S I (xS : y) s.t. |S| = T (1)\nwhere I(·) denotes the mutual information [6]. Forward Sequential Feature Selection Maximizing the objective function in Eq. 1 is generally NP-hard. Many MI-based feature selection methods adopt a greedy method, where features are selected incrementally, one feature at a time. Let St−1 = {xf1 ,xf2 , ...,xft−1} be the selected feature set after time step t − 1. According to the greedy method, the next feature ft at step t is selected such that\nft = argmax i/∈St−1 I (xSt−1∪i : y) (2)\nwhere xSt−1∪i denotes x’s projection into the feature space St−1 ∪ i. As shown in [5], the mutual information term in Eq. 2 can be decomposed as:\nI (xSt−1∪i : y) = I (xSt−1 : y) + I (xi : y|xSt−1) = I (xSt−1 : y) + I (xi : y)− I (xi : xSt−1) + I (xi : xSt−1 |y) = I (xSt−1 : y) + I (xi : y)\n− (H (xSt−1)−H (xSt−1 |xi)) + (H (xSt−1 |y)−H (xSt−1 |xi,y))\n(3)\nwhere H(·) denotes the entropy [6]. Omitting the terms that do not depend on xi in Eq. 3, we can rewrite Eq. 2 as follows:\nft = argmax i/∈St−1 I (xi : y) +H (xSt−1 |xi)−H (xSt−1 |xi,y) (4)\nThe greedy learning algorithm has been analyzed in [14]."

      "heading" : "2.2 Limitations of Previous MI-Based Feature Selection Methods",
      "text" : "Estimating high-dimensional information-theoretic quantities is a difficult task. Therefore most MI-based feature selection methods propose low-order approximation to H (xSt−1 |xi) and H (xSt−1 |xi,y) in Eq. 4. A general family of methods rely on the following approximations [5]:\nH (xSt−1 |xi) ≈ t−1∑ k=1 H (xfk |xi)\nH (xSt−1 |xi,y) ≈ t−1∑ k=1 H (xfk |xi,y)\n(5)\nThe approximations in Eq. 5 become exact under the following two assumptions [5]:\nAssumption 1. (Feature Independence Assumption) p (xSt−1 |xi) = t−1∏ k=1 p (xfk |xi)\nAssumption 2. (Class-Conditioned Independence Assumption) p (xSt−1 |xi,y) = t−1∏ k=1 p (xfk |xi,y) Assumption 1 and Assumption 2 mean that the selected features are independent and classconditionally independent, respectively, given the unselected feature xi under consideration.\nWe now demonstrate that the two assumptions cannot be valid simultaneously unless the data has a very specific (and unrealistic) structure. Indeed, consider the graphical models consistent with either assumption, as illustrated in Fig. 1. If Assumption 1 holds true, then xi is the only common cause of the previously selected features St−1 = {xf1 ,xf2 , ...,xft−1}, so that those features become independent when conditioned on xi. On the other hand, if Assumption 2 holds, then the features depend both on xi and class label y; therefore, generally speaking, distribution over those features does not factorize by solely conditioning on xi—there will be remnant dependencies due to y. Thus, if Assumption 2 is true, then Assumption 1 cannot be true in general, unless the data is generated according to a very specific model shown in the rightmost model in Fig. 1. Note, however, that in this case, xi becomes the most important feature because I(xi : y) > I(xSt−1 : y); then we should have selected xi at the very first step, contradicting the feature selection process.\nAs we mentioned above, most existing methods implicitly or explicitly adopt both assumptions or their stronger versions as shown in [5], including mutual information maximization (MIM) [15], joint mutual information (JMI) [8], conditional mutual information maximization (CMIM) [9], maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) [10], conditional infomax feature extraction (CIFE) [16], etc. Approaches based on global optimization of mutual information, such as quadratic programming feature selection (QPFS) [11] and state-of-the-art conditional mutual informationbased spectral method (SPECCMI) [12], are derived from the previous greedy methods and therefore also implicitly rely on those two assumptions.\nIn the next section we address these issues by introducing a novel information-theoretic framework for feature selection. Instead of estimating mutual information and making mutually inconsistent assumptions, our framework formulates a tractable variational lower bound on mutual information, which allows a more flexible and general class of assumptions via appropriate choices of variational distributions."

We need to choose q(y|xS) to be as general as possible while still keeping the term 〈ln q (y|xS)〉p(xS ,y) tractable in Eq. 9.\nAs a result, we set q(y|xS) as\nq (y|xS) = q (xS ,y)\nq (xS) = q (xS |y) p (y)∑ y′ q (xS |y′) p (y′) (10)\nWe can verify that Eq. 10 is normalized even if q(xS |y) is not normalized.

Now that q(y|xS) is defined, all we need to do is model q(xS |y) under Eq. 10, and q(xS) is easy to compute based on q(xS |y). Here we decompose q(xS |y) as an auto-regressive distribution assuming T features in S:\nq (xS |y) = q (xf1 |y) T∏\nt=2\nq (xft |xf<t ,y) (13)\nwhere xf<t denotes {xf1 ,xf2 , ...,xft−1}. The graphical model in Fig. 2 demonstrates this decom-\nposition. The main advantage of this model is that it is well-suited for the forward feature selection procedure where one feature is selected at a time (which we will explain in Sec. 3.2.3). And if q (xft |xf<t ,y) is tractable, then so is the whole distribution q(xS |y). Therefore, we would find tractable Q-Distributions over q (xft |xf<t ,y). Below we illustrate two such Q-distributions. Naive Bayes Q-distribution. An natural idea would be to assume xt is independent of other variables given y, i.e.,\nq (xft |xf<t ,y) = p (xft |y) (14)\nThen the variational distribution q(y|xS) can be written based on Eqs. 10 and 14 as follows:\nq (y|xS) = p (y)\n∏ j∈S\np (xj |y)∑ y′ p (y′) ∏ j∈S p (xj |y′) (15)\nAnd we also have the following theorem:\nTheorem 3.1 (Exact Naive Bayes). Under Eq. 15, the lower bound in Eq. 8 becomes exact if and only if data is generated by a Naive Bayes model, i.e., p (x,y) = p (y) ∏ i p (xi|y).\nThe proof for Theorem 3.1 becomes obvious by using the mutual information definition. Note that the most-cited MI-based feature selection method mRMR [10] also assumes conditional independence given the class label y as shown in [5, 18, 19], but they make additional stronger independence assumptions among only feature variables.\nPairwise Q-distribution. We now consider an alternative approach that is more general than the Naive Bayes distribution:\nq (xft |xf<t ,y) = ( t−1∏ i=1 p (xft |xfi ,y) ) 1 t−1\n(16)\nIn Eq. 16, we assume q (xft |xf<t ,y) to be the geometric mean of conditional distributions q(xft |xfi ,y). This assumption is tractable as well as reasonable because if the data is generated by a Naive Bayes model, the lower bound in Eq. 8 also becomes exact using Eq. 16 due to p (xft |xfi ,y) ≡ p (xft |y) in that case."

Recall that St−1 is the set of selected features after step t − 1, then the feature ft will be selected at step t such that\nft = argmax i/∈St−1 ÎLB (xSt−1∪i : y) (18)\nwhere ÎLB (xSt−1∪i : y) can be obtained from ÎLB (xSt−1 : y) recursively by auto-regressive decomposition q (xSt−1∪i|y) = q (xSt−1 |y) q (xi|xSt−1 ,y) where q (xSt−1 |y) is stored at step t− 1. This forward feature selection can be done under auto-regressive decomposition in Eqs. 10 and 13 for any Q-distribution. However, calculating q(xi|xSt ,y) may vary according to different Qdistributions. We can verify that it is easy to get q(xi|xSt ,y) recursively from q(xi|xSt−1 ,y) under Naive Bayes or Pairwise Q-distribution. We call our algorithm under these two Q-distributions VMInaive and VMIpairwise respectively. It is worthwhile noting that the lower bound does not always increase at each step. A decrease in lower bound at step t indicates that the Q-distribution would approximate the underlying distribution worse than it did at previous step t − 1. In this case, the algorithm would re-maximize the lower bound from zero with only the remaining unselected features. We summarize the concrete implementation of our algorithms in supplementary Sec. A.\nTime Complexity. Although our algorithm needs to calculate the distributions at each step, we only need to calculate the probability value at each sample point. For both VMInaive and VMIpairwise, the total computational complexity is O(NDT ) assuming N as number of samples, D as total number of features, T as number of final selected features. The detailed time analysis is left for the supplementary Sec. A. As shown in Table 1, our methods VMInaive and VMIpairwise have the same time complexity as mRMR [10], while state-of-the-art global optimization method SPECCMI [12] is required to precompute the pairwise mutual information matrix, which gives an time complexity of O(ND2).\nOptimality Under Tree Graphical Models. Although our method VMInaive assumes a Naive Bayes model, we can prove that this method is still optimal if the data is generated according to tree graphical models.

Such combinations representing low-order approximations of mutual information are derived from two assumptions, and it has proved unrealistic to expect both assumptions to be true. Inspired by group testing [21], more scalable feature selection methods have been developed, but this method also requires the calculation of high-dimensional mutual information as a basic scoring function.\nEstimating mutual information from data requires an large number of observations—especially when the dimensionality is high. The proposed variational lower bound can be viewed as a way of estimating mutual information between a high-dimensional continuous variable and a discrete variable.

Despite the clarity of mutual information, estimating it can be difficult. While a large number of information-theoretic methods exist, they are rather limited and rely on mutually inconsistent assumptions about underlying data distributions. We introduced a unifying variational mutual information lower bound to address these issues. We showed that by auto-regressive decomposition, feature selection can be done in a forward manner by progressively maximizing the lower bound. We also presented two concrete methods using Naive Bayes and Pairwise Q-distributions, which strongly outperform the existing methods. VMInaive only assumes a Naive Bayes model, but even this simple model outperforms the existing information-theoretic methods, indicating the effectiveness of our variational information maximization framework. We hope that our framework will inspire new mathematically rigorous algorithms for information-theoretic feature selection, such as optimizing the variational lower bound globally and developing more powerful variational approaches for capturing complex dependencies."

If data is generated according to tree graphical models, where the class label y is the root node, denote the child nodes set in the first layer as L1 = {x1,x2, ...,xL1}, as shown in Fig. B.1. Then there must exist a step T > 0 such that the following three conditions hold by using VMInaive or VMIpairwise:\nCondition I: The selected feature set ST ⊂ L1. Condition II: ILB(xSt : y) = I(xSt : y) for 1 ≤ t ≤ T . Condition III: ILB(xST : y) = I(x : y).\nProof. We prove this theorem by induction. For tree graphical model when selecting the first layer features, VMInaive and VMIpairwise are mathematically equal, therefore we only prove VMInaive case and VMIpairwise follows the same proof.\n1) At step t = 1, for each feature i, we have,\nILB (xi : y) =\n〈 ln ( q (xi|y) q (xi) )〉 p(x,y)\n= 〈 ln  p (xi|y)∑ y′ p (y′) p (xi|y′) 〉 p(x,y)\n= 〈 ln ( p (xi|y) p (xi) )〉 p(x,y) = I (xi : y)\n(24)\nThus, we are choosing a feature that has the maximum mutual information with y at the very first step. Based on the data processing inequality, we have I(xi : y) ≥ I(desc(xi) : y) for any xi in layer 1 where desc(xi) represents any descendant of xi. Thus, we always select features among the nodes of the first layer at step t = 1 without loss of generality. If node xj that is not in the first layer is selected at step t = 1, denote ances(xj) as xj’s ancestor in layer 1, then I(xj : y) = I(ances(xj) : y) which means that the information is not lost from ances(xj)→ xj . In this case, one can always switch ances(xj) with xj and let xj be in the first layer, which does not conflict with the model assumption.\nTherefore, condition I and II are satisfied in step t = 1.\n2) Assuming condition I and II are satisfied in step t, then we have the following argument in step t+ 1:\nWe discuss the candidate nodes in three classes, and argue that nodes in Remaining-Layer 1 Class are always being selected.\nRedundant Class For any descendant desc(St) of selected feature set St, we have, I ( xSt∪desc(St) : y ) = I (xSt : y) = ILB (xSt : y) (25)\nEq. 25 comes from the fact that the desc(St) carries no additional information about y other than St. The second equality is by induction.\nBased on Eq. 12 and 25, we have, ILB ( xSt∪desc(St) : y ) < I ( xSt∪desc(St) : y ) = I (xSt : y)\n(26)\nWe assume here that the LHS is strictly less than RHS in Eq. 26 without loss of generality. This is because if the equality holds, we have p (xSt |y) p (desc (St) |y) = p (xt, desc (St) |y) due to Theorem 3.1. In this case, we can always rearrange desc(St) to the first layer, which does not conflict with the model assumption.\nNote that by combining Eqs. 25 and 26, we can also get ILB ( xSt∪desc(St) : y ) < ILB (xSt : y) (27)\nEq. 27 means that adding a feature in Redundant Class will actually decrease the value of lower bound ILB .\nRemaining-Layer1 Class For any other unselected node j of the first layer, i.e., j ∈ L1\\St, we have I (xSt : y) ≤ I (xSt∪j : y) = ILB (xSt∪j : y) (28)\nThe inequality in Eq. 28 is obvious which comes from the data processing inequality [6]. And the equality in Eq. 28 comes directly from Theorem 3.1.\nDescendants-of-Remaining-Layer1 Class For any node desc(j) that is the descendant of j where j ∈ L1\\St, we have,\nILB ( xSt∪desc(j) : y ) ≤ I ( xSt∪desc(j) : y ) I ( xSt∪desc(j) : y ) ≤ I (xSt∪j : y)\n(29)\nThe second inequality of Ineq. 29 also comes from data processing inequality.\nCombining Eqs. 26 and 28, we get, ILB ( xSt∪desc(St) : y ) < ILB (xSt∪j : y) (30)\nCombining Eqs. 28 and 29, we get, ILB ( xSt∪desc(j) : y ) ≤ ILB (xSt∪j : y) (31)\nIneq. 30 essentially tells us the forward feature selection will always choose Remaining-Layer1 Class other than Redundant Class.\nIneq. 31 is saying we are choosing Remaining-Layer1 Class other than Descendants-of-RemainingLayer1 Class without loss of generality (for the equality concern, we can have the same argument in step t = 1).\nConsidering Ineqs. 30 and 31, in step t + 1, the algorithm chooses node j in Remaining-Layer1 Class, i.e., j ∈ L1\\St. Therefore, condition I and II hold at step t+ 1.\nAt step t + 1, if ILB (xSt∪j : y) = ILB (xSt : y) for any j ∈ L1\\St, that means I (xSt∪j : y) = I (xSt : y). Then we have,\nI (xSt : y) = I (xL1 : y) = I (x : y) (32)\nThe first equality in Eq. 32 holds because adding any j in L1\\St will not increase the mutual information. The second equality is due to the data processing inequality under tree graphical model assumption.\nTherefore, if ILB (xSt∪j : y) = ILB (xSt : y) for any j ∈ L1\\St, we set T = t. Thus by combining condition II and Eq. 32, we have,\nILB (xST : y) = I (xST : y) = I (x : y) (33)\nThen condition III holds."

An extensive body of work on information-theoretic feature selection exists which is based on maximizing mutual information between subsets of features and class labels. Practical methods are forced to rely on approximations due to the difficulty of estimating mutual information. We demonstrate that approximations made by existing methods are based on unrealistic assumptions. We formulate a more flexible and general class of assumptions based on variational distributions and use them to tractably generate lower bounds for mutual information. These bounds define a novel information-theoretic framework for feature selection, which we prove to be optimal under tree graphical models with proper choice of variational distributions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method strongly outperforms existing information-theoretic feature selection approaches.",
