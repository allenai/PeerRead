Therefore, the progressively integration and simulation of the decision maker is a main concern in an application. We contribute in this direction by proposing an interactive method based on a reference point-based guided local search to the bi-objective Inventory Routing Problem. A local search metaheuristic, working on the delivery intervals, and the Clarke &amp; Wright savings heuristic is employed for the subsequently obtained Vehicle Routing Problem. To elicit preferences, the decision maker selects a reference point to guide the search in interesting subregions. Additionally, the reference point is used as a reservation point to discard solutions outside the cone, introduced as a convergence criterion. Computational results of the reference point-based guided local search are reported and analyzed on benchmark data in order to show the applicability of the approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 May 2014 07:23:38 GMT  (1597kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5643v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sandra huber", "martin josef geiger", "marc sevaux"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5643"}
