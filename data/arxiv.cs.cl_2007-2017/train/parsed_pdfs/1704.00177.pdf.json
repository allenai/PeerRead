      "text" : "The evolution of scientific ideas happens when old ideas are replaced by new ones. Researchers usually conduct scientific experiments based on the previous publications. They either take use of others work as a solution to solve their specific problem, or they improve the results documented in the previous publications by introducing new solutions. I refer to the former as positive citation and the later negative citation. Citation sentence examples 1 with different sentiment polarity are shown in Table 1.\nSentiment analysis of citations plays an important role in plotting scientific idea flow. I can see from Table 1, one of the ideas introduced in\n1 Randomly selected from : http://cl.awaisathar.com\n/citation-sentiment-corpus/\npaper A0 is Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which has been referenced positively in paper A1. In paper A2, however, a better approach was brought up making the idea (HMM based POS ) in paper A0 negative. This citation sentiment analysis could lead to future-works in such a way that new approaches (mentioned in paper A2) are recommended to other papers which cited A0 positively 2. Analyzing citation sentences during literature review is time consuming. Recently, researchers developed algorithms to automatically analyze citation sentiment. For example, [1] extracted several features for citation purpose and polarity classification, such as reference count, contrary expression and dependency relations. Jochim et al. tried to improve the result by using unigram and bigram features [2]. [3] used word level features, contextual polarity features, and sentence structure based features to detect sentiment citations. Although they generated good results using the combination of features, it required a lot of engineering work and big amount of annotated data to obtain the features. Further more, capturing accurate features relies on other NLP techniques, such as part-of-speech tagging (POS) and sentence parsing. Therefore, it is necessary to explore other techniques that are free from hand-crafted features. With the development of neural networks and deep learning, it is possible to learn the representations of concepts from unlabeled text corpus automatically. These representations can be treated as concept features for classification. An important advance in this area is the development of the word2vec technique [4], which has proved to be an effective approach in Twitter sentiment classification [5].\n2 Restriction: the citations share the similar topics. In this case: HMM based POS tagging\nIn this work, the word2vec technique on sentiment analysis of citations was explored. Word embeddings trained from different corpora were compared."

      "text" : "Mikolov et al. introduced word2vec technique [4] that can obtain word vectors by training text corpus. The idea of word2vec (word embeddings) originated from the concept of distributed representation of words [6]. The common method to derive the vectors is using neural probabilistic language model [7]. Word embeddings proved to be effective representations in the tasks of sentiment analysis [5, 8, 9] and text classification [10]. Sadeghian and Sharafat [11] extended word embeddings to sentence embeddings by averaging the word vectors in a sentiment review statement. Their results showed that word embeddings outperformed the bagof-words model in sentiment classification. In this work, I are aiming at evaluating word embeddings for sentiment analysis of citations. The research questions are:\n1. How well does word2vec work on classifying positive and negative citations?\n2. Can sentiment-specific word embeddings improve the classification result?\n3. How well does word2vec work on classifying implicit citations?\n4. In general, how well does word2vec work on classifying positive, negative and objective citations in comparison with hand-crafted features?"

There are several types of averaging performed on the data: Micro-F calculates metrics globally by counting the total true positives, false negatives and false positives. Macro-F calculates metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean. Macro-F does not take label imbalance into account. Weighted-F calculates metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label).

The result of classifying positive and negative citations was shown in Table 4. To compare with the outcomes in the work of [3] 11, I selected two records from their results: the best one (based on features n-gram + dependencies + negation) and the baseline (based on 1-3 grams). From Table 2 I can see that the features extracted by [3] performed far better than word embeddings, in terms of macro-F (their best macro-F is 0.90, the one in this work is 0.33). However, the higher micro-F score (The highest micro-F in this work is 0.88, theirs is 0.78) and the weighted-F scores indicated that this method may achieve better performances if the evaluations are conducted on a balanced dataset. Among the embeddings, ACL-Embeddings performed better than Brown corpus in terms of macroF and weighted-F measurements 12. To compare the dimensionality of word embeddings, ACL300 gave a higher micro-F score than ACL100, but there is no difference between 300 and 100 dimensional ACL-embeddings when look at the macro-F and weighted-F scores.\nTable 3 showed the sent2vec performance on classifying implicit citations with four categories: objective, negative, positive and excluded. The method in this experiment had a poor performance on detecting positive citations, but it was comparable with both the baseline and sentence structure method [13] for the category of objective citations. With respect to classifying negative citations, this method was not as good as sentence structure features but it outperformed the baseline. The results of classifying category X from the rest showed that the performances of this method and the sentence structure method are fairly equal.\n11 The test dataset is slightly larger than [3]’s test dataset. 12 I did not perform significant test for the comparison.\nTable 4 showed the results of classifying positive and negative citations using different word embeddings. The macro-F score 0.85 and the weighted-F score 0.86 proved that word2vec is effective on classifying positive and negative citations. However, unlike the outcomes in the paper of [5], where they concluded that sentiment specific word embeddings performed best, integrating polarity information did not improve the result in this experiment."

The binary classification results in Table 4 showed that word2vec is a promising tool for distinguishing positive and negative citations. From Table 4 I can see that there are no big differences among the scores generated by ACL100 and Brown100, despite they have different vocabulary sizes (ACL100 has 14,325 words, Brown100 has 56,057 words). The polarity specific word embeddings did not show its strength in the task of binary classification. For the task of classifying implicit citations (Table 3), in general, sent2vec (macro-F 0.44) was comparable with the baseline (macro-F 0.47) and it was effective for detecting objective sentences (F-score 0.84) as well as separating X sentences from the rest (F-score 0.997), but it did not work well on distinguishing positive citations from the rest. For the overall classification (Table 2), however,\nthis method was not as good as hand-crafted features, such as n-grams and sentence structure features. I may conclude from this experiment that word2vec technique has the potential to capture sentiment information in the citations, but hand-crafted features have better performance."
