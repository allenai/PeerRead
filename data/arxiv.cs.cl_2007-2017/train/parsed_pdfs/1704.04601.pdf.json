      "text" : "Recently, deep learning methodologies have dominated several research areas in natural language processing (NLP), such as machine translation, language understanding, and dialogue systems. However, most of applications usually utilize word-level embeddings to obtain semantics. Considering that natural language is highly ambiguous, the standard word embeddings may suffer from polysemy issues. Neelakantan et al. (2014) pointed out that, due to triangle inequality in vector space, if one word has two different senses but is restricted to one embedding, the sum of the distances between the word and its synonym\nin each sense would upper-bound the distance between the respective synonyms, which may be mutually irrelevant, in embedding space1. Due to the theoretical inability to account for polysemy using a single embedding representation per word, multi-sense word representations are proposed to address the ambiguity issue using multiple embedding representations for different senses in a word (Reisinger and Mooney, 2010; Huang et al., 2012).\nThis paper focuses on unsupervised learning from an unannotated corpus. There are two key mechanisms for a multi-sense word representation system in such scenario: 1) a sense selection (decoding) mechanism infers the most probable sense for a word given its context and 2) a sense representation mechanism learns to embed word senses in a continuous space.\nUnder this framework, prior work focused on designing a single model to deliver both mechanisms (Neelakantan et al., 2014; Li and Jurafsky, 2015; Qiu et al., 2016). However, the previously proposed models introduce side-effects: 1) mixing word-level and sense-level tokens achieves efficient sense selection but introduces ambiguous word-level tokens during the representation learning process (Neelakantan et al., 2014; Li and Jurafsky, 2015), and 2) pure sense-level tokens prevent ambiguity from word-level tokens but require exponential time complexity when decoding a sense sequence (Qiu et al., 2016).\nUnlike the prior work, this paper proposes MUSE2—a novel modularization framework incorporating sense selection and representation learning models, which implements flexible modules to optimize distinct mechanisms. Specifically, MUSE enables linear time sense identity decoding\n1d(rock, stone) + d(rock, shake) ≥ d(stone, shake) 2The trained models and code will be released after the\npaper gets accepted.\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n04 60\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n5 A\npr 2\n01 7\nwith a sense selection module and purely senselevel representation learning with a sense representation module. With the modular design, we propose a novel joint learning algorithm on the modules by connecting to a reinforcement learning scenario. We further employ a word sense exploration mechanism to improve robustness in the learning algorithm. Our contributions are fourfold: • MUSE is the first system that maintains\npurely sense-level representation learning with linear-time sense decoding. • We are among the first to propose a joint\nlearning algorithm for modularized unsupervised sense embedding learning. • We introduce a sense exploration mechanism\nfor the sense selection module to achieve better flexibility and robustness. • Our experimental results show the state-of-\nthe-art performance for synonym selection and contextual word similarities in terms of MaxSimC."

      "text" : "There are three dominant types of approaches for learning multi-sense word representations in the literature: 1) clustering methods, 2) probabilistic modeling methods, and 3) lexical ontology based methods. Our reinforcement learning based approach can be loosely connected to clustering methods and probabilistic modeling methods.\nReisinger and Mooney (2010) first proposed multi-sense word representations on the vector space based on clustering techniques. With the power of deep learning, some work exploited neural networks to learn embeddings with sense selection based on clustering (Huang et al., 2012; Neelakantan et al., 2014). Chen et al. (2014) replaced the clustering procedure with a word sense disambiguation model using WordNet (Miller, 1995). Kågebäck et al. (2015) and Vu and Parker (2016) further leveraged a weighting mechanism and interactive process in the clustering procedure. Moreover, Guo et al. (2014) leveraged bilingual resources for clustering. However, most of the above approaches separated the clustering procedure and the representation learning procedure without a joint objective, which may suffer from the error propagation issue. Instead, the proposed approach, MUSE, enables joint training on sense selection and representation learning.\nInstead of clustering, probabilistic modeling methods have been applied for learning multisense embeddings in order to make the sense selection more flexible, where Tian et al. (2014) and Jauhar et al. (2015) conducted probabilistic modeling with EM training. Li and Jurafsky (2015) exploited Chinese Restaurant Process to infer the sense identity. Furthermore, Bartunov et al. (2016) developed a non-parametric Bayesian extension on the skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013b). Despite reasonable modeling on sense selection, all above methods mixed wordlevel and sense-level tokens during representation learning—unable to conduct representation learning in the pure sense level due to the complicated computation in their EM algorithms.\nRecently, Qiu et al. (2016) proposed an EM algorithm to learn purely sense-level representations, where the computational cost is high when decoding the sense identity sequence, because it takes exponential time to search all sense combination within a context window. Our modular design addresses such drawback, where the sense selection module decodes a sense sequence with linear-time complexity, while the sense representation module remains representation learning in the pure sense level.\nUnlike a lot of relevant work that requires additional resources such as the lexical ontology (Pilehvar and Collier, 2016; Rothe and Schütze, 2015; Jauhar et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Iacobacci et al., 2015) or bilingual data (Guo et al., 2014; Ettinger et al., 2016; Šuster et al., 2016), which may be unavailable in some language, our model can be trained using only an unlabeled corpus. Also, some prior work proposed to learn topical embeddings and word embeddings jointly in order to consider the contexts (Liu et al., 2015a,b), whereas this paper focuses on learning multi-sense word embeddings."

      "text" : "This work proposes a framework to modularize two key mechanisms for multi-sense word representations: a sense selection module and a sense representation module. The sense selection module decides which sense to use given a text context, whereas the sense representation module learns meaningful representations based on its statistical characteristics. Unlike prior work that must compromise between efficient sense selection and\npurely sense-level representation learning, the proposed modularized framework is capable of performing efficient sense selection and learning sense-level representations simultaneously.\nTo learn sense-level representations, a sense selection model should be first established for sense identity decoding. On the other hand, the sense embeddings should guide the sense selection model when decoding a sense identity sequence. Therefore, these two modules should be tangled. This indicates that a naive two-stage algorithm or two separate learning algorithms proposed by prior work are not optimal.\nBy connecting the proposed formulation with reinforcement learning literature, we design a novel joint training algorithm. Besides, taking advantage of the form of reinforcement learning, we are among the first to investigate various exploration techniques in sense selection for unsupervised sense embedding learning."

      "text" : "Formally speaking, given a corpus C, vocabulary V , and the t-th word wi = Ct ∈ V , we would like to find the most probable sense zik ∈ Zi, where Zi is the set of senses in word wi. Assuming that a word sense is determined by the local context, we exploit a local context C̄t = {Ct−m, · · · , Ct+m} for sense selection according to the Markov assumption, where m is the size of a context window. Then we can either formulate a probabilistic\npolicy π(zik | C̄t) about sense selection or estimate the individual fitness q(zik | C̄t) for each sense identity.\nTo ensure efficiency, here we exploit a linear neural architecture that takes word-level input tokens and outputs sense-level identities. The architecture is similar to continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) (Mikolov et al., 2013a). Specifically, given a word embedding matrix P , the local context can be modeled as the summation of word embeddings from its context C̄t. The output can be formulated with a 3-mode tensorQ, whose dimensions denote words, senses, and latent variables. Then we can model π(zik | C̄t) or q(zik | C̄t) correspondingly. Here we model π(·) as a categorical distribution using a softmax layer:\nπ(zik | C̄t) = exp(QTik ∑ j∈C̄t Pj)∑\nk′∈Zi exp(Q T ik′ ∑ j∈C̄t Pj) .\n(1) On the other hand, the likelihood of selecting distinct sense identities, q(zik | C̄t), is modeled as a Bernoulli distribution with a sigmoid function σ(·):\nq(zik | C̄t) = σ(QTik ∑ j∈C̄t Pj). (2)\nDifferent modeling approaches require different learning methods, especially for the unsupervised setting. We leave the corresponding learning algorithms in § 3.2. Finally, with a built sense selection module, we can apply any selection algorithm such as a greedy selection strategy to infer the sense identity zik given a word wi with its context Ct.\nWe note that modularized model allows sense selection to enjoy efficiency by leveraging wordlevel tokens, while remaining purely sense-level tokens in the representation module. Specifically, if n denotes maxk |Zk|, decoding L words takes O(nL) senses to be searched due to independent sense selection. The prior work using a single model with purely sense-level tokens (Qiu et al., 2016) requires exponential time to calculate the collocation energy for every possible combination of sense identities within a context window, O(n2m), for a single target sense. Further, Qiu et al. (2016) took an additional sequence decoding step with quadratic time complexity O(n4mL), based on an exponential number n2m in the base unit. It demonstrates the achievement about sense inference efficiency in our proposed model."

      "text" : "The semantic representation learning is typically formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem for collocation likelihood. In this paper, we use the skip-gram formulation (Mikolov et al., 2013b) considering that it requires less training time, where only two sense identities are required for stochastic training. Other popular candidates, like GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) and CBOW (Mikolov et al., 2013a), require more sense identities to be selected as input and thus not suitable for our scenario. For example, GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) takes computationally expensive collocation counting statistics for each token in a corpus as input, which requires sense selection for every occurrence of the target word across the whole corpus for a single optimization step.\nTo learn the representations, we first create input sense representation matrix U and collocation estimation matrix V as the learning targets. Given a target word wi and collocated word wj with corresponding local contexts, we map them to their sense identities as zik and zjl by the sense selection module, and maximize the sense collocation log likelihood logL(·). A natural choice of the likelihood function is formulated as a categorical distribution over all possible collocated senses given the target sense zik:\nlogL(zjl | zik) = log exp(UTzikVzjl)∑ zuv exp(UTzikVzuv) . (3)\nInstead of enumerating all possible collocated senses which is computationally expensive, we\nuse the skip-gram objective (4) (Mikolov et al., 2013b) to approximate (3) as shown in the green block of Figure 1.\nlog L̄(zjl |zik) = log σ(UTzikVzjl) (4)\n+ M∑ v=1 Ezuv∼pneg(z)[log σ(−U T zik Vzuv)],\nwhere pneg(z) is the distribution over all senses for negative samples. In our experiment with |Zi| senses for word wi, we use (1/|Zi|) word-level unigram as sense-level unigram for efficiency and the 3/4-th power trick in Mikolov et al. (2013b).\nWe note that our modular framework can easily maintain purely sense-level tokens with an arbitrary representation learning model. In contrast, most related work using probabilistic modeling (Tian et al., 2014; Jauhar et al., 2015; Li and Jurafsky, 2015; Bartunov et al., 2016) binded sense representations with the sense selection mechanism, so efficient sense selection by leveraging wordlevel tokens can be achieved only at the cost of mixing word-level and sense-level tokens in their representation learning process."

On one hand, forwarding the prediction of the sense selection module to the representation module is trivial. On the other hand, we cast the estimated collocation likelihood as a reward signal for the selected sense for effective learning. Based on different modeling methods ((1) or (2)) in the sense selection module, we connect the model to respective learning algorithms.\nThe learning algorithm can be viewed as a reinforcement learning algorithm solving a onestep Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Sutton and Barto, 1998), where the state, action, and reward correspond to context C̄t, sense zik, and collocation log likelihood log L̄(·) respectively. Note that we focus on stochastic optimization for a practical learning setting.

In addition, as the skip-gram formulation in (4) is unidirectional (L̄(zik | zjl) 6= L̄(zjl | zik)), we perform one-side optimization for the target sense zik to stabilize model training3. That is, for the target word wi and the collocated word wj given respective contexts C̄t and C̄t′ (0 < |t− t′| ≤ m), we first draw a sense zjl for wj from the policy π(· | C̄t′) and optimize the expected collocation likelihood for the target sense zik as follows,\nmaxEzik∼π(·|C̄t)[log L̄(zjl | zik)]. (5)\nThe objective is differentiable and supports stochastic optimization (Lei et al., 2016), which uses a stochastic sample zik for optimization.\nHowever, there are two possible disadvantages in this formulation. First, because the policy assumes the probability distribution in (1), optimizing the selected sense must affect the estimation of the other senses. Second, if applying stochastic gradient ascent to optimizing (5), it would always lower the probability estimation for the selected sense zik even if the model accurately selects the right sense. The detailed proof is in Appendix A."

      "text" : "To address the above issues, we apply the Qlearning algorithm (Mnih et al., 2013). Instead of maintaining a probabilistic policy for sense selection, Q-learning estimates the Q-value (resulting collocation log likelihood) for each sense candidate directly and independently. Thus, the estimation of unselected senses may not be influenced by the selected one. Note that in one-step MDP, the reward is equivalent to the Q-value, so we will use reward and Q-value interchangeably, hereinafter, based on the context.\nWe further follow the convention of recent neural reinforcement learning by reducing the reward range to aid model training (Mnih et al., 2013). Specifically, we replace the log likelihood log L̄(·) ∈ (− inf, 0] with the likelihood L̄(·) ∈ [0, 1] as the reward function. Due to the monotonous operation in log(), the relative ordering of the reward remains the same.\nIn addition, we exploit the probabilistic nature of likelihood for Q-learning. To elaborate, as Q-learning is used to approximate the Q-value for each action in typical reinforcement learning,\n3We observe about 4% performance drop by optimizing input selection zik and output selection zjl simultaneously.\nmost literature adopted square loss to characterize the discrepancy between the target and estimated Q-values (Mnih et al., 2013). In our setting where the Q-value/reward is a likelihood function, our model exploits cross-entropy loss to better capture the characteristics of probability distribution.\nFurthermore, given that the collocation likelihood in (4) is an approximation to the original categorical distribution with a softmax function shown in (3) (Mikolov et al., 2013b), we revise the formulation by omitting the negative sampling term. The resulting formulation L̂(·) is a Bernoulli distribution indicating whether zjl collocates or not given zik:\nL̂(zjl | zik) = σ(UTzikVzjl). (6)\nThere are three advantages about using L̂(·) instead of approximated L̄(·) and original L(·). First, regarding the variance of estimation, L̂(·) better captures L(·) than L̄(·) because L̄(·) involves sampling:\nV ar(L̄(·)) ≥ V ar(L̂(·)) = V ar(L(·)) = 0.\nSecond, regarding the relative ordering of estimation, for any two collocated senses zjl and zjl′ with a target sense zik, the following equivalence holds:\nL(zjl | zik) < L(zjl′ | zik) ⇔ L̄(zjl | zik) < L̄(zjl′ | zik) ⇔ L̂(zjl | zik) < L̂(zjl′ | zik)\nThird, for collocation computation, L(·) requires all sense identities and L̄(·) requires (M+1) sense identities, whereas L̂(·) only requires 1 sense identity. In sum, the proposed L̂(·) approximates L(·) with no variance, no “bias” (in terms of relative ordering), and significantly less computation.\nFinally, because both target distribution L̂(·) and estimated distribution q(·) are Bernoulli distributions, we follow the last section to conduct one-side optimization by fixing a collocated sense zjl and optimize the selected sense zik with cross entropy as\nmin H(L̂(zik, zjl), q(zik, C̄t)) (7) = min −L̂(zik, zjl) log q(zik, C̄t) − (1− L̂(zik, zjl)) log(1− q(zik, C̄t))."

However, there are two incentives to conduct exploration. First, in the early training stage when the fitness is not well estimated, it is desirable to explore underestimated senses. Second, due to high ambiguity in natural language, sometimes multiple senses in a word would fit in the same context. The dilemma between exploring sub-optimal choices and exploiting the optimal choice is called exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998).\nWe introduce exploration mechanisms for sense selection for both policy gradient and Q-learning. For policy gradient, we sample the policy distribution to approximate the expectation in (5). Because of the flexible formulation of Q-learning, the following classic exploration mechanisms are applied to sense selection: • Greedy: selects the sense with the largest Q-\nvalue (no exploration). • -Greedy: selects a random sense with\nprobability, and adopts the greedy strategy\notherwise (Mnih et al., 2013). • Boltzmann: samples the sense based on the\nBoltzmann distribution modeled by Q-value. We directly use (1) as the Boltzmann distribution for simplicity.\nWe note that Q-learning with Boltzmann sampling yields the same sampling process as policy gradient but different optimization objective. To our best knowledge, we are among the first to explore several exploration strategies for unsupervised sense embedding learning.\nIn the following sections, MUSE-Policy denotes the proposed MUSE model with policy learning and MUSE-Greedy denotes the model using corresponding sense selection strategy for Qlearning."

Specifically, given a list of word pairs with corresponding contexts, S = {(wi, C̄t, wj , C̄t′)}, we calculate the Spearman’s rank correlation ρ between human-judged similarity and model similarity estimations. Two major contextual similarity estimations are introduced by Reisinger and Mooney (2010): AvgSimC and MaxSimC. AvgSimC is a\nsoft measurement that addresses the contextual information with a probability estimation:\nAvgSimC(wi, C̄t, wj , C̄t′) = |Zi|∑ k=1 |Zj |∑ l=1 π(zik|C̄t)π(zjl|C̄t′)d(zik, zjl),\nwhere d(zik, zjl) refers to the cosine similarity between Uzik and Uzjl .

Hence, we argue that MaxSimC better characterize practical usage of a sense representation system than AvgSimC.\nAmong various learning methods for MUSE, policy gradient performs worst, echoing our argument in § 3.2.1. On the other hand, the superior performance of Boltzmann sampling and - Greedy over Greedy selection demonstrates the effectiveness of exploration.\nFinally, replacing L̄(·) with L̂(·) as the reward signal yields 2.3 times speedup for MUSE-Greedy and 1.3 times speedup for MUSEBoltzmann to reach 67.0 in MaxSimC, which demonstrates the efficacy of proposed approximation L̂(·) over typical L̄(·) in terms of convergence."

We initialize Q and V as zeros, and P and U from uniform distribution [− √ 1/100, √ 1/100] such that each embedding has unit length in expectation (Lei et al., 2015). Our model uses 25 negative senses for negative sampling in (4). We use = 5% for -Greedy sense selection strategy\nIn optimization, we conduct mini-batch training with 2048 batch size using the following procedure: 1) select senses in the batch; 2) optimize U, V using stochastic training within the batch for efficiency; 3) optimize P,Q using mini-batch training for robustness."

However, most of the above approaches separated the clustering procedure and the representation learning procedure without a joint objective, which may suffer from the error propagation issue. Instead, the proposed approach, MUSE, enables joint training on sense selection and representation learning. Instead of clustering, probabilistic modeling methods have been applied for learning multisense embeddings in order to make the sense selection more flexible, where Tian et al.

    "abstractText" : "This paper proposes to address the word sense ambiguity issue in an unsupervised manner, where word sense representations are learned along a word sense selection mechanism given contexts. Prior work about learning multi-sense embeddings suffered from either ambiguity of different-level embeddings or inefficient sense selection. The proposed modular framework, MUSE, implements flexible modules to optimize distinct mechanisms, achieving the first purely sense-level representation learning system with lineartime sense selection. We leverage reinforcement learning to enable joint training on the proposed modules, and introduce various exploration techniques on sense selection for better robustness. The experiments on benchmark data show that the proposed approach achieves the state-ofthe-art performance on synonym selection as well as on contextual word similarities in terms of MaxSimC.",
