      "text" : "A mathematical tool that has existed since 1989 [1–3], but is less well known in the machine-learning community, is the Random Neural Network (RNN), which is a stochastic integer-state “integrate and fire” system and developed to mimic the behaviour of biological neurons in the brain. In an RNN, an arbitrarily large set of neurons interact with each other via excitatory and inhibitory spikes which modify each neuron’s action potential in continuous time. The power of the RNN lays on the fact that, in steady state, the stochastic spiking behaviors of the network have a remarkable property called “product form” and that the state probability distribution is given by an easily solvable system of non-linear equations. The RNN has been used for numerous applications [4–15] that exploit its recurrent structure.\nDeep learning has achieved great success in machine learning [16,17]. Many computational models in deep learning exploit a feed-forward neural-network architecture that is composed of multi-processing layers, which allows the model to extract high-level representations from raw data. The feed-forward fully-connected multi-layer neural network could be difficult to train [18]. Pre-training the network layer by layer is a great advance [16, 19] and useful due to its wide adaptability, though recent literature shows that utilizing the rectified linear unit (ReLU) could train a deep neural network without pre-training [20]. The typical training procedure called stochastic gradient descent (SGD) provides a practical choice for handling large datasets [21].\nNonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is also a popular topic in machine learning [22–26], which learns part-based representations of raw data. Lee [22] suggested that the perception of the whole in the brain may be based on these part-based representations (based on the physiological evidence [27]) and proposed simple yet effective update rules. Hoyer [24] combined sparse coding and NMF that allows control over sparseness. Ding investigated the equivalence between the NMF and K-means\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n08 15\n1v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n9 Se\np 20\nclustering in [26, 28] and presented simple update rules for orthogonal NMF. Wang [25] provided a comprehensive review on recent processes in the NMF area.\nThis paper first exploits the structure of the RNN equations as a quasi-linear structure. Using it in the feed-forward case, an RNN-based shallow nonnegative autoencoder is constructed. Then, this shallow autoencoder is stacked into a multi-layer feed-forward autoencoder following the network architecture in the deep learning area [16, 17, 19]. Since connecting weights in the RNN are products of firing rates and transition probabilities, they are subject to the constraints of nonnegativity and that the sum of probabilities is no larger than 1, which are called the RNN constraints in this paper. In view of that, the conventional gradient descent is not applicable for training such an autoencoder. By adapting the update rules from nonnegative graph embedding that can be seemed as a variant of NMF, applicable update rules are developed for the autoencoder that satisfy the first RNN constraint of nonnegativity. For the second RNN constraint, we impose a check-and-adjust procedure into the iterative learning process of the learning algorithms. The training procedure of SGD is also adapted into the algorithms. The efficacy of the nonnegative autoencoders equipped with the learning algorithms is well verified via numerical experiments on both typical image datasets including the MNIST [29], Yale face [30] and CIFAR-10 [31] datesets and 16 real-world datasets in different areas from the UCI machine learning repository [32]. Then, we simulate the spiking behaviors of the RNNbased autoencoder, where simulation results conform well with the corresponding numerical results, therefore demonstrating that this nonnegative autoencoder can be implemented in a highly-distributed and parallel manner."

      "text" : "An arbitrary neuron in the RNN can receive excitatory or inhibitory spikes from external sources, in which case they arrive according to independent Poisson processes. Excitatory or inhibitory spikes can also arrive from other neurons to a given neuron, in which case they arrive when the sending neuron fires, which happens only if that neuron’s input state is positive (i.e. the neuron is excited) and inter-firing intervals from the same neuron v are exponentially distributed random variables with rate rv ≥ 0. Since the firing times depend on the internal state of the sensing neuron, the arrival process of neurons from other cells is not in general Poisson. From the preceding assumptions it was proved in [3] that for an arbitrary N neuron RNN, which may or may not be recurrent (i.e. containing feedback loops), the probability in steady-state that any cell h, located anywhere in the network, is excited is given by the expression:\nqh = min( λ+h +\n∑N v=1 qvrvp + vh\nrh + λ − h + ∑N v=1 qvrvp − vh , 1), (1)\nfor h = 1, ... , N , where p+vh, p − vh are the probabilities that cell v may send excitatory or inhibitory spikes to cell h, and λ+h , λ − h are the external arrival rates of excitatory and inhibitory spikes to neuron h. Note that min(a, b) is a element-wise operation whose output is the smaller one between a and b. In [3], it was shown that the system of N non-linear equations (1) have a solution which is unique.\nBefore adapting the RNN as a non-negative autoencoder (Section 3), we will simplify the recurrent RNN model into the feed-forward structure shown in Figure 1. The simplified RNN has an input layer and a hidden layer. The V input neurons receive excitatory spikes from the outside world, and they fire excitatory spikes to the H hidden neurons.\nLet us denote by q̂v the probability that the vth input neuron (v = 1, · · · , V ) is excited and qh the probability that the hth hidden neuron (h = 1, · · · , H) is excited. According to [1] and (1), they are given by q̂v = min(Λ̂+v /r̂v, 1), and qh = min(Λ + h /rh, 1), where the quantities Λ̂ + v and Λ + h represent the total average arrival rates of excitatory spikes, r̂v and rh represent the firing rates of the neurons. Neurons in this model interact with each other in the following manner, where h = 1, · · · , H and v = 1, · · · , V . When the vth input neuron fires, it sends excitatory spikes to the hth hidden neuron with probability p+v,h ≥ 0. Clearly, ∑H h=1 p + v,h ≤ 1. • The vth input neuron receives excitatory spikes from the outside world with rate xv ≥ 0. •When the hth hidden neuron fires, it sends excitatory spikes outside the network. Let us denote wv,h = p+v,hr̂v. For simplicity, let us set the firing rates of all neurons to r̂v = rh = 1\nor that ∑H\nh=1 wv,h ≤ 1. Then, Λ̂+v = xv , r̂v = 1, Λ + h = ∑V v=1 wv,hq̂v , and using the fact that qh, qv\nare probabilities, we can write:\nq̂v = min(xv, 1), qh = min( V∑ v=1 wv,hq̂v, 1), (2)\nsubject to ∑H\nh=1 wv,h ≤ 1. We can see from (2) that this simplified RNN is quasi linear. For the network shown in Figure 1, we call it a quasi-linear RNN (LRNN)."

We use structures of 784 → 100 (for simplicity, we use the encoding part to represent an autoencoder) and 784→ 50 and the MNIST dataset for experiments. The whole training dataset of 60,000 images is used for training. Figure 2(a) shows the curves of training error (mean square error) versus the number of iterations, where, in each iteration, a minibatch of size 100 is handled. Then, we use a multi-layer non-negative LRNN autoencoder with structure 784 → 1000 → 500 → 250 → 50, and the corresponding curve of training error versus iterations is also given in Figure 2(a). It can be seen from Figure 2(a) that reconstruction errors using the LRNN autoencoders equipped with the developed algorithms converge well for different structures. In addition, the lowest errors using the shallow and multi–layer autoencoders are respectively 0.0204 and 0.0190. The results show that, for the same encoding dimension, the performances of the shallow and multi-layer structures are similar for this dataset.\nResults of Yale face: Attribute values are normalized into [0, 1] (by dividing by 255). The structures for the shallow and multi-layer LRNN autoencoders are respectively 1024→ 50 and 1024→ 500→ 100→ 50. The size of a minibatch is 5. Curves of reconstruction errors versus iterations are given in Figure 2(b). For this dataset, the shallow autoencoder seems more stable than the multi-layer one.\nResults of CIFAR-10: Attribute values of the dataset are also divided by 255 for normalization in range [0, 1]. The structures used are 3072 → 150 and 3072 → 1000 → 500 → 150. Both the training and testing dataset (total 60,000 images) are used for training the autoencoders. The size of minibatch is chosen as 100. The results are given in Figure 2(c). We can see that reconstruction errors for both structures converge as the number of iterations increases. In addition, the lowest reconstruction errors in using the shallow and multi-layer autoencoders are the same (0.0082). These results together with those with the MNIST and Yale face datasets (Figures 2(a) to 2(c)) verify the good convergence and reconstruction performance of both the shallow and multi-layer LRNN autoencoders for handling image datsets.\nResults of UCI real-world datasets: Let N denote the attribute number in a dataset. The structures of the LRNN autoencoders used are N → round(N/2), where the operation round(·) produces\nthe nearest integer number of the element. The attribute values are linear normalized in range [0, 1]. The size of mini-batches is set as 50 for all datasets. Curves of reconstruction errors versus iterations are given in Figure 3.

      "heading" : "6 Simulating the spiking random neural network",
      "text" : "The advantage of a spiking model, such as the LRNN autoencoder, lays on its highly-distributed nature. In this section, rather than numerical calculation, we simulate the stochastic spiking behaviors of the LRNN autoencoder. The simulation in this section is based on the numerical experiment of Subsection 5.2. Specifically, in Subsection 5.2, we construct a LRNN autoencoder of structure 784→ 100 (with appropriate weights found), which has three layers: the visual layer (784 neurons), hidden layer (100 neurons) and output layer (784 neurons). First, an image with 28 × 28 = 784 attributes is taken from the MNIST dataset. Each visual neuron receives excitatory spikes from outside the network in a Poisson stream with the rate being the corresponding attribute value in the image. When activated, the visual neurons fire excitatory spikes to the hidden neurons according to the Poisson process with rate 1 (meaning wv,h = p+v,h). When the vth visual neuron fires to the hidden layer, the spike goes to the hth hidden neuron with probability p+v,h or it goes outside the\nnetwork with probability 1 − ∑H\nh=1 p + v,h. The hidden neurons fire excitatory spikes to the output\nlayer in a similar manner subjecting to wh,o. The firing rate of output neurons is 1 and the spikes go outside the network with probability 1.\nIn the simulation, we call it an event whenever a spike gets in from outside the network or a neuron fires. During the simulation, we observe the potential (the level of activation) of each neuron once every 1,000 events. Let ki,b represent the bth observation of the ith neuron. We estimate the average potential of the ith neuron, denoted by k̄i, simply by averaging observations, i.e., k̄i ≈ ( ∑B b=1 ki,b)/B. Let qi denote the probability that the ith neuron is activated. The relation between qi and k̄i is known as k̄i = qi/(1− qi). Then, the value of qi can be estimated during the simulation as:\nqi = k̄i\n1 + k̄i ≈\n( ∑B\nb=1 ki,b)/B 1 + ( ∑B b=1 ki,b)/B . (12)\nIn Figure 4, we visualize the estimated values of qi for all neurons in different layers after 10,000, 100,000 and 1,000,000 events during the simulation. For comparison, numerical results from Subsection 5.2 are also given in Figure 4. At the beginning, simulation results of only the visual layer are close to its numerical results. As time evolves, the simulation results of the hidden and output layers and their corresponding numerical results become more and more similar. These results demonstrate that the LRNN autoencoders have the potential to be implemented in a highly distributed and parallel manner."

The shallow autoencoder is a simplified RNN model, which is then stacked into a multi-layer architecture. The learning algorithm is based on the weight update rules in NMF, subject to the nonnegative probability constraints of the RNN. The autoencoders equipped with this learning algorithm are tested on typical image datasets including the MNIST, Yale face and CIFAR-10 datasets, and also using 16 real-world datasets from different areas. The results obtained through these tests yield the desired high learning and recognition accuracy. Also, numerical simulations of the stochastic spiking behavior of this RNN auto encoder, show that it can be implemented in a highly-distributed manner.",
