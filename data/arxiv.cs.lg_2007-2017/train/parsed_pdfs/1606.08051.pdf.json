      "text" : "recognition, gesture recognition, and handwriting recognition are concerned with simultaneous segmentation and labeling of sequence data. Latent-dynamic conditional random field (LDCRF) is a well-known discriminative method that has been successfully used for this task. However, LDCRF can only be trained with pre-segmented data sequences in which the label of each frame is available. In the realm of neural networks, the invention of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) made it possible to train Recurrent Neural Networks on unsegmented sequences with great success. In this paper, we use CTC to train LDCRF model on unsegmented sequences. Experimental results on gesture recognition tasks show that our proposed method can outperform LDCRF, Hidden Markov Models, and Conditional Random Fields.\nKeywords: Latent-dynamic conditional random field; Connectionist Temporal Classification; unsegmented sequences;\nI. INTRODUCTION Labeling and segmenting of data sequences is a common problem in sequence classification tasks [1]. It arises in many real-world applications such as gesture recognition, speech recognition, and handwriting recognition.\nProbabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) are the type of probabilistic models which are commonly used in machine learning problems [2]. They offer a powerful framework in which relations between two or more stochastic variables is expressed by representing graph for them. PGMs are divided into two categories: undirected graphical models or Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and directed graphical models or Bayesian Networks (BNs). Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Figure 1.(a)) [3] is a variant of MRFs, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [4] is a variant of BNs, are two well-known models which are widely used in sequence classification problems.\nHMM is generative classifier which models the joint distribution of input sequences and their corresponding labels, but, CRF is discriminative classifier which models a conditional distribution label given input sequence.\nLatent-dynamic conditional random field (LDCRF) [5] is a type of CRF which used for structured prediction problems. It\nwas proposed to use in the special case of sequence classification problems which labels must be assigned to each frame of unsegmented sequences. Learning procedure for these models is discriminative and carried out on a set of frame wise labeled training sets.\nLDCRF model can be described as a generalized form of chain-structured CRF model in which hidden variables are incorporated into the CRF to learn Various structures of class labels. Similar to the Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRFs) [6], LDCRF uses hidden variables to learn both extrinsic and intrinsic relations for various structures of labels. It is a proper model for human-computer interaction (HCI) problems, mostly applied in sign language spotting and human action recognition [7-10].\nDespite the LDCRF can be used for segmenting and tagging of unsegmented sequences, it requires to train on the set of presegmented sequences. However, for many real-world data sets in sequence classification tasks, the segmented sequence of labels does not available and only unsegmented sequences, so LDCRF model can’t directly train on them.\nA. Graves and et al. introduced a method called “Connectionist Temporal Classification” (CTC) [11, 12] which can be joint with RNNs and provides a framework that is able to train, directly on unsegmented sequences. They used CTC as a layer on top of recurrent neural networks such as LSTM and its variant, then applied it to the sequence classification problems such as online/offline unconstrained handwriting recognition. Experimented results showed that their proposed method got a significant improvement in classification performance over earlier methods for dealing with those problems [13-16].\nIn this paper, we present a method for training LDCRF model directly on unsegmented sequences. We used the CTC method to remove the needs of pre-segmented sequences for training LDCRF.\nThe next section reviews the pre-required methods and definitions of our proposed method. Section (III), describes the motivation and the idea of the proposed method, mathematical formulation, and its training algorithm. Section (IV), explains the datasets used in our experiments for sequence classification. Section (V), discusses the experimented results of our CTC-\nLDCRF method and compare it with standard LDCRF, CRF, and HMM models. Section (VI) gives a direction for future works and concludes this paper.\nII. PRELIMINARIES In this section, we first briefly explain the temporal classification tasks, and then review two LDCRF and CTC methods. We used same notations for these three subsections and next sections."

EXPERIMENTS In this section, we describe the datasets and the methodology which were used in our experiments to evaluate our model performance.\nAvatar-Eye Dataset:\nThis dataset consisted of eye gaze gesture roughly calculated from 6 human contributors interacting with an avatar [17]. The aim is to recognize eye gaze aversion gestures versus all other types of eye gestures from unsegmented video sequences.\nThe input features for each video sequence is 2-dimensional eye gaze obtained using the view-based appearance model. Each frame of a video sequence in the dataset was tagged either as “eye gaze aversion” or “other eye gestures”.\nArmGesture-Continuous Dataset: The ArmGesture dataset includes six arm gestures (Figure 3). It was collected from 13 contributors with an average of 120 samples per class where each sample is a sequence of the 20- dimensional feature vector. This dataset is containing unsegmented sequences of gestures based on the original ArmGesture dataset.

This training set contained the same number of frames as the one used for training the CRF and LDCRF models excluding frames were grouped into subsequences according to their tag.

Within training, we differ the number of hidden states per label for the LDCRF from 2 to 6 and window size from 0 to 2.\nFor all of this three configuration, we adding one additional class label to model as “non-gesture” or “blank” in order to use in computation of CTC layer."

A single group used for testing while all other sequences were used for training and validation. This process was repeated K times, and a mean of the K result reported for accuracy. We use K = 5 for the ArmGesture-Continues and K = 2 for the Avatar-Eye dataset. The measure for the models performance is number of the correct predicted labels for each frame of every test sequence:\n= ∑ #\n∑ # × 100 (9)\nV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We compare the result of the three configurations of our LDCRF-CTC learning algorithm on ArmGesture-Continues and Avatar-Eye Datasets with standard LDCRF, Linear CRF, and HMM Models in our experiments. We use (9) to compare experiment results. the ROC curve for the experiment on AvatarEye dataset (Figure 4) shows that the CTC-LDCRF which was trained with unsegmented sequence outperforms the other models. This can be explained because of data sequences framewise tagged manually by a human agent and it may not exactly correct especially on boundaries where label changed in sequence. Since we use unsegmented training sequence and don’t use frame wised labels our method achieves better performance compared with other methods, also because of Avatar-Eye is a small dataset with 3-Dimentional feature vector and only 2 class label, the CTC-LDCRF method achieves good performance without needs to pre-trained.\nTable I. shows the experimental results on ArmGestureContinues dataset. The third configuration of Our CTC-LDCRF training methods has higher accuracy compare to others experimented methods.\nVI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we develop a framework for training LDCRF model directly on the unsegmented sequence. We employed CTC approach in our framework to make the LDCRF model able to trains directly with unsegmented sequences. We did experiments on two gesture recognition datasets and showed that our model achieves better performance over other experimented models, even though it is trained on unsegmented data sequence and gets less information than other models.\nFor the future works we plan to extend our framework and use a neural network such as LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a feature extractor and make it possible to apply our framework on more complex and raw real-world data sets [18, 19]."

    "abstractText" : "Many machine learning problems such as speech recognition, gesture recognition, and handwriting recognition are concerned with simultaneous segmentation and labeling of sequence data. Latent-dynamic conditional random field (LDCRF) is a well-known discriminative method that has been successfully used for this task. However, LDCRF can only be trained with pre-segmented data sequences in which the label of each frame is available. In the realm of neural networks, the invention of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) made it possible to train Recurrent Neural Networks on unsegmented sequences with great success. In this paper, we use CTC to train LDCRF model on unsegmented sequences. Experimental results on gesture recognition tasks show that our proposed method can outperform LDCRF, Hidden Markov Models, and Conditional Random Fields.",
