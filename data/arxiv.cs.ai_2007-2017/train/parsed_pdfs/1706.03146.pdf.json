      "text" : "We are interested in learning distributed sentence representation in an unsupervised fashion. Previously, the skip-thought model was introduced by Kiros et al. (2015), which learns to explore the semantic continuity within adjacent sentences (Harris, 1954) as supervision for learning a generic sentence encoder. The skip-thought model encodes the current sentence and then decodes the previous sentence and the next one, instead of itself. Two independent decoders were applied, since intuitively, the previous sentence and the next sentence should be drawn from 2 different conditional distributions, respectively.\nBy posing a hypothesis that the adjacent sentences provide the same neighborhood informa-\ntion for learning sentence representation, we first drop one of the 2 decoders, and use only one decoder to reconstruct the surrounding 2 sentences at the same time. The empirical results show that our skip-thought neighbor model performs as well as the skip-thought model on 7 evaluation tasks. Then, inspired by Hill et al. (2016), as they tested the effect of incorporating an autoencoder branch in their proposed FastSent model, we also conduct experiments to explore reconstructing the input sentence itself as well in both our skip-thought neighbor model and the skip-thought model. From the results, we can tell that our model didn’t benefit from the autoencoder path, while reconstructing the input sentence hurts the performance of the skip-thought model. Furthermore, we conduct an interesting experiment on only decoding the next sentence without the previous sentence, and it gave us the best results among all the models. Model details will be discussed in Section 3."

      "text" : "Distributional sentence representation learning involves learning word representations and the compositionality of the words within the given sentence. Previously, Mikolov et al. (2013b) proposed a method for distributed representation learning for words by predicting surrounding words, and empirically showed that the additive composition of the learned word representations successfully captures contextual information of phrases and sentences. Similarly, Le and Mikolov (2014) proposed a method that learns a fixed-dimension vector for each sentence, by predicting the words within the given sentence. However, after training, the representation for a new sentence is hard to derive, since it requires optimizing the sentence representation towards an objective.\nUsing an RNN-based autoencoder for language\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n03 14\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nJ un\n2 01\n7\nrepresentation learning was proposed by Dai and Le (2015). The model combines an LSTM encoder, and an LSTM decoder to learn language representation in an unsupervised fashion on the supervised evaluation datasets, and then finetunes the LSTM encoder for supervised tasks on the same datasets. They successfully show that learning the word representation and the compositionality of words could be done at the same time in an end-to-end machine learning system.\nSince the RNN-based encoder processes an input sentence in the word order, it is obvious that the dependency of the representation on the starting words will decrease as the encoder processes more and more words. Tai et al. (2015) modified the plain LSTM network to a tree-structured LSTM network, which helps the model to address the long-term dependency problem. Other than modifying the network structure, additional supervision could also help. Bowman et al. (2016) proposed a model that learns to parse the sentence at the same time as the RNN is processing the input sentence. In the proposed model, the supervision comes from the objective function for the supervised tasks, and the parsed sentences, which means all training sentences need to be parsed prior to training. These two methods require additional preprocessing on the training data, which could be slow if we need to deal with a large corpus.\nInstead of learning to compose a sentence representation from the word representations, the skip-thought model Kiros et al. (2015) utilizes the structure and relationship of the adjacent sentences in the large unlabelled corpus. Inspired by the skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013a), and the sentence-level distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954), the skip-thought model encodes the current sentence as a fixed-dimension vector, and instead of predicting the input sentence itself, the decoders predict the previous sentence and the next sentence independently. The skip-thought model provides an alternative way for unsupervised sentence representation learning, and has shown great success. The learned sentence representation encoder outperforms previous unsupervised pretrained models on 8 evaluation tasks with no finetuning, and the results are comparable to supervised trained models. In Triantafillou et al. (2016), they finetuned the skip-thought models on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)\ncorpus (Bowman et al., 2015), which shows that the skip-thought pretraining scheme is generalizable to other specific NLP tasks.\nIn Hill et al. (2016), the proposed FastSent model takes summation of the word representations to compose a sentence representation, and predicts the words in both the previous sentence and the next sentence. The results on this semantic related task is comparable with the RNN-based skip-thought model, while the skip-thought model still outperforms the FastSent model on the other six classification tasks. Later, Siamese CBOW (Kenter et al., 2016) aimed to learn the word representations to make the cosine similarity of adjacent sentences in the representation space larger than that of sentences which are not adjacent.\nFollowing the skip-thought model, we designed our skip-thought neighbor model by a simple modification. Section 3 presents the details."

Then, conditioned on the representation zi, two separate decoders are applied to reconstruct the previous sentence si−1, and the next sentence si+1, respectively. We call them previous decoder p(si−1|zi; θp) and next decoder p(si+1|zi; θn), where θ· denotes the set of parameters in each decoder.\nSince the two conditional distributions learned from the decoders are parameterized independently, they implicitly utilize the sentence order information within the sentence tuple. Intuitively, given the current sentence si, inferring the previous sentence si−1 is considered to be different from inferring the next sentence si+1."

(2015). Since the comparison among different recurrent units is not our main focus, we decided to use GRU, which is a fast and stable recurrent unit. In addition, Chung et al. (2014) shows that, on language modeling tasks, GRU performs as well as the long short-term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).\nSuppose sentence si contains N words, which are w1i , w 2 i , ..., w N i . At an arbitrary time step t, the encoder produces a hidden state hti, and we regard it as the representation for the previous subsequence through time t. At time N , the hidden state hNi represents the given sentence si, which is zi. The computation flow of the GRU in our experiments is shown below (omitting the subscript i) :\n[ mt\nrt\n] = σ ( Whh t−1 +Wxx t )\n(1)\nĥt = tanh ( Wxt +U ( rt ht−1 )) (2)\nht = (1−mt) ht−1 +mt ĥt (3)\nwhere xt is the embedding for the word wti , W· and U are the parameter matrices, and is the element-wise product."

To modify the skipthought model, given si, we assume that inferring si−1 is the same as inferring si+1. If we define {si−1, si+1} as the two neighbors of si, then the inferring process can be denoted as sj ∼ p(s|zi; θd), for any j in the neighborhood of si. The conditional distribution learned from the decoder is parameterized by θd.\nIn experiments, we directly drop one of the two decoders, and use only one decoder to reconstruct the previous sentence si−1 and next sentence si+1 at the same time, given the representation zi of si. Our skip-thought neighbor model can be considered as sharing the parameters between the previous decoder and the next decoder in the original skip-thought model. An illustration is shown in Figure 1.\nThe objective at each time step is defined as the log-likelihood of the predicted word given the previous words, which is\n`ti,j(θe, θd) = log p(w t j |w<tj , zi; θe, θd) (4)\nmax θe,θd ∑ i ∑ j∈{i−1,i+1} ∑ t `ti,j(θe, θd) (5)\nwhere θe is the set of parameters in the encoder, and θd is the set of parameters in the decoder.

In other words, for a given sentence pair {si, si+1}, the inference process includes si → si+1 and si+1 → si.\nIn our hypothesis, the model doesn’t distinguish between the sentences in a neighborhood.

After unsupervised training on the BookCorpus dataset, we fix the parameters in the encoder, and apply it as a sentence representation extractor on the 7 tasks.\nFor semantic relatedness, we use the SICK dataset (Marelli et al., 2014), and we adopt the feature engineering idea proposed by Tai et al. (2015). For a given sentence pair, the encoder computes a pair of representations, denoted as u and v, and the concatenation of the component-wise product u ·v and the absolute difference |u − v| is regarded as the feature for the given sentence pair. Then we train a logistic regression on top of the feature to predict the semantic relatedness score. The evaluation metrics are Pearsons r, Spearmans ρ, and mean squared error MSE.\nThe dataset we use for the paraphrase detection is the Microsoft Paraphrase Detection Corpus (Dolan et al., 2004). We follow the same feature engineering idea from Tai et al. (2015) to compute a single feature for each sentence pair. Then we train a logistic regression, and 10-fold cross validation is applied to find the optimal hyperparameter settings.\nThe 5 classification tasks are question-type classification (TREC) (Li and Roth, 2002), movie review sentiment (MR) (Pang and Lee, 2005), customer product reviews (CR) (Hu and Liu, 2004), subjectivity/objectivity classification\n2https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch\n(SUBJ) (Pang and Lee, 2004), and opinion polarity (MPQA) (Wiebe et al., 2005).\nIn order to deal with more words besides the words used for training, the same word expansion method, which was introduced by Kiros et al. (2015), is applied after training on the BookCorpus dataset.\nThe results are shown in Table 1, where the model name is given by encoder type - model type - model size. We tried with three different types of the encoder, denoted as uni-, bi-, and combinein Table 1. The first one is a uni-directional GRU, which computes a 1200-dimension vector as the sentence representation. The second one is a bi-directional GRU, which computes a 600- dimension vector for each direction, and then the two vectors are concatenated to serve as the sentence representation. Third, after training the unidirectional model and the bi-directional model, the representation from both models are concatenated together to represent the sentence, denoted as combine-.\nIn Table 1, -N- refers to our skip-thought neighbor model, -N-next- refers to our skip-thought neighbor with only predicting the next sentence, and -skip- refers to the original skip-thought model."

For the skipthought model, since the implicit hypothesis in the model is that different decoders learn different conditional distributions, we add another decoder in the skip-thought model to reconstruct the sentence si. The results are also shown in Table 1.\nAs we can see, our skip-thought neighbor+AE models outperform skip-thought+AE models significantly. Specifically, in skip-thought model, adding an autoencoder branch hurts the performance on SICK, MR, CR, SUBJ and MPQA\ndataset. We find that the reconstruction error on the autoencoder branch decreases drastically during training, while the sum of the reconstruction errors on the previous decoder and next decoder fluctuates widely, and is larger than that in the model without the autoencoder branch. It seems that, the autoencoder branch hurt the skip-thought model to capture sentential contextual information from the surrounding sentences. One could vary the weights on the three independent branches to get better results, but it is not our main focus in this paper.\nIn our skip-thought neighbor model, the inclusion of the autoencoder constraint did not have the same problem. With the autoencoder branch, the model gets lower errors on reconstructing all three sentences. However, it doesn’t help the model to perform better on the evaluation tasks."

In this case, the decoder is required to reconstruct 4 sentences at the same time. We ran experiments with our model, and we evaluated the trained encoder on 7 tasks.\nThere is no significant performance gain or loss on our model trained with 4 neighbors; it seems that, increasing the number of neighbors doesn’t improve the performance, but it also doesn’t hurt the performance.

Generally, the normalization step slightly hurts the performance on the semantic relatedness SICK task, while it improves the performance across all the other classification tasks.

Table 4 presents the generated sentences. Several interesting observations worth mentioning here.\nThe decoder in our skip-thought neighbor model aims to minimize the distance of the gen-\nerated sentence to two targets, which lead us to doubt if the decoder is able to generate at least grammatically-correct English sentences. But, the results shows that the generated sentences are both grammatically-correct and generally meaningful.\nWe also observe that, the generated sentences tend to have similar starting words, and usually have negative expression, such as i was n’t, i ’m not, i do n’t, etc. After investigating the training corpus, we noticed that this observation is caused by the dataset bias. A majority of training sentences start with i and i ’m and i was , and there is a high chance that the negation comes after was and ’m. In addition, the generated sentences rarely are the sentential contextual extension of their associated input sentences, which is same for the skipthought models.
