      "text" : "Neural network approaches have taken the field of natural language processing (NLP) by storm. In particular, variants of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) have produced impressive results on some of the classic NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging (Ling et al., 2015), syntactic parsing (Vinyals et al., 2015) and semantic role labeling (Zhou and Xu, 2015). One might speculate that it is the recurrent nature of these models that enables these results.\nIn this work we demonstrate that simple feed-forward networks without any recurrence can achieve comparable or better accuracies than LSTMs, as long as they are globally normalized. Our model, described in detail in Section 2, uses a transition system (Nivre, 2006) and feature embeddings as introduced by Chen and Manning (2014). We do not use any recurrence, but perform beam search for maintaining multiple hypotheses and intro-\nduce global normalization with a conditional random field (CRF) objective (Bottou et al., 1997; Le Cun et al., 1998; Lafferty et al., 2001) to overcome the label bias problem that locally normalized models suffer from. Since we use beam inference, we approximate the partition function by summing over the elements in the beam, and use early updates (Collins and Roark, 2004; Zhou et al., 2015). We compute gradients based on this approximate global normalization and perform full backpropagation training of all neural network parameters based on the CRF loss.\nWe revisit the label bias problem in Section 3 and provide a novel proof that globally normalized models are strictly more expressive than locally normalized models. Lookahead features can partially mitigate this discrepancy, but cannot fully compensate for it—a point to which we return later. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of global normalization, we evaluate our model on part-of-speech tagging, syntactic dependency parsing and sentence compression (Section 4). Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all of these tasks, matching or outperforming LSTMs while being significantly faster. In particular for dependency parsing on the Wall Street Journal we achieve the best-ever published unlabeled attachment score of 94.41%.\nAs discussed in more detail in Section 5, we also outperform previous structured training approaches used for neural network transitionbased parsing. Our ablation experiments show that we outperform Weiss et al. (2015) and Alberti et al. (2015) because we do global backpropagation training of all model parameters, while they fix the neural network parameters when training the global part of their model. We also outperform Zhou et al. (2015) despite using a smaller beam. To shed additional light on the label bias problem in practice, we provide a sentence\ncompression example where the local model completely fails. We then demonstrate that a globally normalized parsing model without any lookahead features is almost as accurate as our best model, while a locally normalized model loses more than 10% absolute in accuracy because it cannot effectively incorporate evidence as it becomes available."

We will use a function ρ(s, d; θ) to compute the score of decision d in state s. The vector θ contains the model parameters and we assume that ρ(s, d; θ) is differentiable with respect to θ.\nThroughout this work we will use transition systems in which all complete structures for the same input x have the same number of decisions n(x) (or n for brevity). In dependency parsing for example, this is true for both the arc-standard and arc-eager transition systems (Nivre, 2006), where for a sentence x of length m, the number of decisions for any complete parse is n(x) = 2 × m.1 A complete structure is then a sequence of decision/state pairs (s1, d1) . . . (sn, dn) such that s1 = s†, di ∈ S(si) for i = 1 . . . n, and si+1 = t(si, di). We use the notation d1:j to refer to a decision sequence d1 . . . dj .\nWe assume that there is a one-to-one mapping between decision sequences d1:j and states sj : that is, we essentially assume that a state encodes the entire history of decisions. Thus, each state can be reached by a unique decision sequence from s†.2 We will use decision sequences d1:j and states interchangeably: in a slight abuse of notation, we\n1Note that this is not true for the swap transition system defined in Nivre (2009).\n2It is straightforward to extend the approach to make use of dynamic programming in the case where the same state can be reached by multiple decision sequences.\ndefine ρ(d1:j , d; θ) to be equal to ρ(s, d; θ) where s is the state reached by decisions d1:j .\nThe scoring function ρ(s, d; θ) can be defined in a number of ways. In this work, following Chen and Manning (2014), Weiss et al. (2015), and Zhou et al. (2015), we define it via a feedforward neural network as\nρ(s, d; θ) = φ(s; θ(l)) · θ(d).\nHere θ(l) are the parameters of the neural network, excluding the parameters at the final layer. θ(d) are the final layer parameters for decision d. φ(s; θ(l)) is the representation for state s computed by the neural network under parameters θ(l). Note that the score is linear in the parameters θ(d). We next describe how softmax-style normalization can be performed at the local or global level."

      "heading" : "3 The Label Bias Problem",
      "text" : "Intuitively, we would like the model to be able to revise an earlier decision made during search, when later evidence becomes available that rules out the earlier decision as incorrect. At first glance, it might appear that a locally normalized model used in conjunction with beam search or exact search is able to revise earlier decisions. However the label bias problem (see Lafferty et al. (2001), Bottou (1991), Bottou and LeCun (2005)) means that locally normalized models often have a very weak ability to revise earlier decisions.\nThis section gives a more formal perspective on the label bias problem than in previous work, through a proof that globally normalized models are strictly more expressive than locally normalized models. The proof makes use of an example that gives an illustration of the label bias problem.\nGlobal Models can be Strictly More Expressive than Local Models Consider a tagging problem where the task is to map an input sequence x1:n to a decision sequence d1:n. First, consider a locally normalized model where we restrict the scoring function to access only the first i input symbols x1:i when scoring decision di. We will return to this restriction soon. The scoring function ρ can be an otherwise arbitrary function of the tuple 〈d1:i−1, di, x1:i〉:\npL(d1:n|x1:n) =\nn∏\ni=1\npL(di|d1:i−1, x1:i)\n= exp ∑n i=1 ρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:i)∏n\ni=1 ZL(d1:i−1, x1:i) .\nSecond, consider a globally normalized model\npG(d1:n|x1:n) = exp\n∑n i=1 ρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:i)\nZG(x1:n) .\nThis model again makes use of a scoring function ρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:i) restricted to the first i input symbols when scoring decision di.\nDefine PL to be the set of all possible distributions pL(d1:n|x1:n) under the local model obtained as the scores ρ vary. Similarly, define PG to be the set of all possible distributions pG(d1:n|x1:n) under the global model. Here a “distribution” is a function from a pair (x1:n, d1:n) to a probability p(d1:n|x1:n). Our main result is the following:\nTheorem 3.1 PL is a strict subset of PG, that is PL ( PG.\nTo prove this we will first prove that PL ⊆ PG. This step is straightforward. We then show that PG * PL; that is, there are distributions in PG that are not in PL. The proof that PG * PL gives a clear illustration of the label bias problem.\nProof that PL ⊆ PG: We need to show that for any locally normalized distribution pL, we can construct a globally normalized model pG such that pG = pL. Consider a locally normalized model with scores ρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:i). Define a global model pG with scores\nρ′(d1:i−1, di, x1:i) = log pL(di|d1:i−1, x1:i).\nThen it is easily verified that\npG(d1:n|x1:n) = pL(d1:n|x1:n)\nfor all x1:n, d1:n. In proving PG * PL we will use a simple problem where every example seen in training or test data is one of the following two tagged sentences:\nx1x2x3 = a b c, d1d2d3 = A B C\nx1x2x3 = a b e, d1d2d3 = A D E (7)\nNote that the input x2 = b is ambiguous: it can take tags B or D. This ambiguity is resolved when the next input symbol, c or e, is observed.\nNow consider a globally normalized model, where the scores ρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:i) are defined as follows. Define T as the set {(A,B), (B,C), (A,D), (D,E)} of bigram tag transitions seen in the data. Similarly, define E as the set {(a,A), (b,B), (c, C), (b,D), (e,E)} of (word, tag) pairs seen in the data. We define\nρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:i) (8)\n= α× J(di−1, di) ∈ T K + α× J(xi, di) ∈ EK\nwhere α is the single scalar parameter of the model, and JπK = 1 if π is true, 0 otherwise.\nProof that PG * PL: We will construct a globally normalized model pG such that there is no locally normalized model such that pL = pG.\nUnder the definition in (8), it is straightforward to show that\nlim α→∞ pG(A B C|a b c) = lim α→∞ pG(A D E|a b e) = 1.\nIn contrast, under any definition for ρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:i), we must have\npL(A B C|a b c) + pL(A D E|a b e) ≤ 1 (9)\nThis follows because pL(A B C|a b c) = pL(A|a) × pL(B|A, a b) × pL(C|A B, a b c) and pL(A D E|a b e) = pL(A|a) × pL(D|A, a b) × pL(E|A D, a b e). The inequality pL(B|A, a b) + pL(D|A, a b) ≤ 1 then immediately implies (9).\nIt follows that for sufficiently large values of α, we have pG(A B C|a b c)+ pG(A D E|a b e) > 1, and given (9) it is impossible to define a locally normalized model with pL(A B C|a b c) = pG(A B C|a b c) and pL(A D E|a b e) = pG(A D E|a b e).\nUnder the restriction that scores ρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:i) depend only on the first i input symbols, the globally normalized model is still able to model the data in (7), while the locally normalized model fails (see Eq. 9). The ambiguity at input symbol b is naturally resolved when the next symbol (c or e) is observed, but the locally normalized model is not able to revise its prediction.\nIt is easy to fix the locally normalized model for the example in (7) by allowing scores ρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:i+1) that take into account the input symbol xi+1. Such lookahead is common in practice, but insufficient in general. For every amount of lookahead k, we can construct examples that cannot be modeled with a locally normalized model by duplicating the middle input b in (7) k + 1 times. Only a local model with scores ρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:n) that considers the entire input can capture any distribution p(d1:n|x1:n): in this case the decomposition pL(d1:n|x1:n) =∏n\ni=1 pL(di|d1:i−1, x1:n) makes no independence assumptions.\nHowever, increasing the amount of context used as input comes at a cost, requiring more powerful learning algorithms, and potentially more training data. For a detailed analysis of the tradeoffs between structural features in CRFs and more powerful local classifiers without structural constraints, see Liang et al. (2008); in these experiments local classifiers are unable to reach the performance of CRFs on problems such as parsing and named entity recognition where structural constraints are important. Note that there is nothing to preclude an approach that makes use of both global normalization and more powerful scoring functions ρ(d1:i−1, di, x1:n), obtaining the best of both worlds. The experiments that follow make use of both."

We pretrain all layers except the softmax layer in this way. We purposefully abstain from complicated hand engineering of input features, which might improve performance further (Durrett and Klein, 2015)."

We conducted experiments on a number of different datasets: (1) English Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) with standard POS tagging splits; (2) English “Treebank Union” multi-domain corpus containing data from the OntoNotes corpus version 5 (Hovy et al., 2006), the English Web Treebank (Petrov and McDonald, 2012), and the updated and corrected Question Treebank (Judge et al., 2006) with identical setup to Weiss et al. (2015); and (3) CoNLL ’09 multilingual shared task (Hajič et al., 2009).\nModel Configuration. Inspired by the integrated POS tagging and parsing transition system of Bohnet and Nivre (2012), we employ a simple transition system that uses only a SHIFT action and predicts the POS tag of the current word on the buffer as it gets shifted to the stack. We extract the\nfollowing features on a window ±3 tokens centered at the current focus token: word, cluster, character n-gram up to length 3. We also extract the tag predicted for the previous 4 tokens. The network in these experiments has a single hidden layer with 256 units on WSJ and Treebank Union and 64 on CoNLL’09.\nResults. In Table 1 we compare our model to a linear CRF and to the compositional characterto-word LSTM model of Ling et al. (2015). The CRF is a first-order linear model with exact inference and the same emission features as our model. It additionally also has transition features of the word, cluster and character n-gram up to length 3 on both endpoints of the transition. The results for Ling et al. (2015) were solicited from the authors.\nOur local model already compares favorably against these methods on average. Using beam search with a locally normalized model does not help, but with global normalization it leads to a 7% reduction in relative error, empirically demonstrating the effect of label bias. It is also interesting to note that the set of character ngrams feature is very important, increasing average accuracy on the CoNLL’09 datasets by about 0.5% absolute. This shows that character-level modeling can also be done with a simple feed-forward netowork without recurrence."

Although using beam search with the local model outperforms greedy inference on average, beam search leads the local model to occasionally produce empty compressions (Table 6). It is important to note that these are not search errors: the empty compression has higher probability under pL than the prediction from greedy inference. However, the more expressive globally normalized model does not suffer from this limitation, and correctly gives the empty compression almost zero probability.\nWe also present some empirical evidence that the label bias problem is severe in parsing. We trained models where the scoring functions in parsing at position i in the sentence are limited to considering only tokens x1:i; hence unlike the full parsing model, there is no ability to look ahead in the sentence when making a decision.3 The result for a greedy model under this constraint is 76.96% UAS; for a locally normalized model with beam search is 81.35%; and for a globally normalized model is 93.60%.

In our final experiments with full lookahead, the globally normalized model achieves 94.01% accuracy, compared to 93.07% accuracy for a local model with beam search. Thus adding lookahead allows the local model to close the gap in performance to the global model; however there is still a significant difference in accuracy, which may in large part be due to the label bias problem.\nA number of authors have considered modified training procedures for greedy models, or for locally normalized models. Daumé III et al. (2009) introduce Searn, an algorithm that allows a classifier making greedy decisions to become more robust to errors made in previous decisions. Goldberg and Nivre (2013) describe improvements to a greedy parsing approach that makes use of methods from imitation learning (Ross et al., 2011) to augment the training set. Note that these methods are focused on greedy models: they are unlikely to solve the label bias problem when used in conjunction with beam search, given that the problem is one of expressivity of the underlying model. More recent work (Yazdani and Henderson, 2015; Vaswani and Sagae, 2016) has augmented locally normalized models with correctness probabilities or error states, effectively adding a step after every decision where the probability of correctness of the resulting structure is evaluated. This gives considerable gains over a locally normalized model, although performance is lower than our full globally normalized approach."

      "text" : "We presented a simple and yet powerful model architecture that produces state-of-the-art results for POS tagging, dependency parsing and sentence compression. Our model combines the flexibility of transition-based algorithms and the modeling power of neural networks. Our results demon-\nstrate that feed-forward network without recurrence can outperform recurrent models such as LSTMs when they are trained with global normalization. We further support our empirical findings with a proof showing that global normalization helps the model overcome the label bias problem from which locally normalized models suffer."
