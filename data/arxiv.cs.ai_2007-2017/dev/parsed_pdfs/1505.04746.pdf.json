INTRODUCTION\nFor many decision-making tasks, huge amounts of spatial and location-related data need to be analyzed. The relationships between geographical areas are modeled using topological relationship models. The Region Connection Calculus (RCC) is well-known and widely used model for topological relations [1]. RCC is widely used for reasoning about available topological information. One of the main characteristics of this calculus that distinguishes it from related approaches is the generality of RCC. Using an arbitrary universal set U of regions, topological relations with an arbitrary reflective and symmetric relation C in U have been defined which is called connection. The visual form of a set of RCC relations is shown in Fig. 1. In particular, note that the EC (externally connected) relation models adjacency, which can also be used to infer TPP (tangential proper part), NTPP (non-tangential proper part) and EQ (equal) relations. In different applications, geographic regions can be modeled with\ndifferent methods, and connection between them can be defined based on the specific method.\nWhen using the RCC in spatial decision-making and analytics, it is usually assumed that regions are well-defined entities, i.e. they are defined by exact boundaries. On the other hand, many geographical regions are inherently ill-defined. For example, although political areas, such as countries, states and counties, have officially defined -and thus exact- boundaries, in many domains where people refer to them in everyday communication (e.g., native and local locations), regions have no exact boundaries. The basic RCC model fails to model such real-world objects, but extending it with the fuzzy topological relations can be a good solution for dealing with this imprecision. Fuzzy topological relations are applicable in many fields including path tracking algorithm based on fuzzy relations [2], medical diagnosis of patient records, extracting topological relations from the web, image interpretation [3], robot control and navigation [4], brain MRI segmentation [5] and soil science [6] among many others applications domains.\nNoticeable research efforts is performed on fuzzy spatial topological relations and progress has been made. Various methods for modeling fuzzy spatial features and fuzzy relations between them have been proposed and evaluated. Most definitions of fuzzy topological relations have been developed based on either fuzzy region connection calculus (RCC), fourintersection or nine-intersection matrix. However, applying the fuzzy RCC model to real-world spatial databases is a challenging task. Implementation of fuzzy RCC relations in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) will help to improve the user interface compared to most of today's GIS systems [7].\nFor practical application of the fuzzy RCC relations, one of the most powerful, open source database management systems (DBMS) used to work with spatial data is PostGIS. It can be installed on PostgreSQL database and gives the user a rich set of features. Many software products can use PostGIS for their database management needs. While crisp (non-fuzzy) RCC relations in some spatial databases such as PostGIS have already been implemented but fuzzy RCC relations have not been implemented yet.\nIn this paper fuzzy RCC relations in PostGIS spatial database is implemented for the first time. With implementation of fuzzy RCC, it can be used in many applications. One of its important applications can be finding the spatial relations of diseases.\nAs another application, this calculus can be used to fuzzify skyline operator. So far, approaches to making database systems more flexible to support the needs of users have been proposed [8]. One of the most useful approaches is the skyline operator [9]. This operator takes a database D of tuples or n-dimensional points and returns a set of tuples or non-dominated points in D. A tuple u is said to dominate another tuple u' if u is at least as good as u' in all dimensions, and superior in at least one dimension. With spatial skyline users can find nearest points or regions to their intended points or regions. In this paper, the proposed fuzzy RCC method is also exploited for the fuzzy skyline problem. Issues such as spatial analysis of diseases with use of this operator can be solved better than existing methods.\nIt should be noted that the one of the most important class of diseases is malignant diseases. Nowadays, malignant diseases are of major issues in healthcare that require further investigation and consideration. The frequency of malignant diseases in Iran has also been increasing and been the focus of health authorities’ attention. There are different reasons for increasing frequency of malignant diseases including new eating habits, increased tobacco consumption, population increase, and the increasing age of demographic structure. Although environmental pollution is the most important cause of certain malignant diseases, is still requires more consideration and analysis. For example, approximately one million ton of lead is added annually to the soil all over the world that great part of which is produced by atmospheric dusts, scattering of ashes, chemical fertilizers used in agriculture, industrial activities, and urban waste. As environmental factors, industrial plants also play an effective role in increasing pollution and, consequently, spreading diseases. Due to its many industrial workshops, Isfahan Province is prone to industrial pollutants. This province is also an important agricultural region where using chemical fertilizers has led to increasing levels of lead in the soil. Lead absorption from contaminated land via agricultural produce is one way this element can enter the food chain. Deposition of lead in human body causes numerous diseases and disorders including certain malignant diseases.\nThrough providing lead dispersion maps and spatial distribution of malignant diseases in Isfahan Province using fuzzy region connection calculus (RCC) and fuzzy skyline, we can establish the relationship between lead and occurrence of malignant diseases [10].\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Part II is an overview of the existing related work. Section III presents the proposed approach for implementing the fuzzy region connection calculus. In section IV of the experiment results using the real data sets is presented and compared with the nonfuzzy RCC relationships of PostGIS. Section V concludes the paper and points to some future works.\nII. RELATED WORK\nOur proposed fuzzy RCC method is to be exploited for the spatial analysis of a serious, real-world problem in healthcare.\nEssential elements of descriptive epidemiology include three factors: “person”, “place”, and “time”. However, in the past decades, epidemiology has mainly focused on time and person, largely ignoring the role of place [11]. Providing various maps from geographical patterns of diseases has been devised and practiced for more than 100 years. Development and improvement of geographical systems in the past forty years have led to more advanced possibilities for studying geographical patterns [12]. This has in turn led to increased debates on the application of geographical information systems in studies related to public health and epidemiology.\nApplication of geographical information systems is important due to the fact that today, epidemiology studies have shifted their focus from the group to the individual. Also, the need for suitable technologies to study epidemiologic data has increased the application of these systems. For example, a general view of health problems can be provided via geographic information systems (GIS) [13]."

      "text" : "GIS applications in human health studies can be divided into two groups. First, those epidemiologic applications which mostly involve study of geographical changes to find the extent the disease has spread as well as the possible causes of such change [14]. These systems can also be used for monitoring and controlling various diseases, and can be used for monitoring diseases transmitted by carriers [15]. The Second group are those application related to designing health-care systems, particularly those which can be readily accessed [14]. GIS can also be used for finding the most suitable place for establishing health care centers such as hospitals, and even evaluating such projects as population-based treatment of tuberculosis [13]."

      "text" : "Although RCC provides an attractive framework for modeling topologic relations, it has distorted applications in the real-world situations where spatial features are affected by vagueness. In one study, a generalization of RCC is proposed which provides the possibility of defining spatial relations between the vague regions [16]. For this purpose, the spatial relations were modeled as fuzzy relations. To support such a spatial argument based on these relations, certain important properties as well as a transmissibility table were presented. Also, it was shown in this approach how vague spatial information can be modeled when vague regions are shown as fuzzy sets. Upon completion of this study, standard RCC models were introduced by Schockaert et al. (2008) [17]. In another study, an RCC generalization was introduced based on the fuzzy set theory and it was indicated how argumentation tasks such as satisfying and checking the implication could bring to an end difficulties encountered in linear programming [18].\nNon-fuzzy RCC relations have been previously implemented in certain spatial data bases. However, fuzzy RCC relations have not been implemented in PostGIS yet. In this dissertation, the fuzzy relations in the PostGIS spatial data bases\nwere implemented. By implementing these relations in the spatial PostGIS data bases, we can use them in different\napplications such as skyline.\nTo make skyline more flexible, the fuzzy skylines were introduced (e.g., [19,20]). Different types of fuzzy skyline were examined in [21], as well as their characteristics for dealing with uncertainty. For the disease analysis field, making skyline more flexible and using larger scales are the two applicable motives chosen from among the five suggested motives. By making skyline more flexible, we can obtain skylines large enough to meet the user’s requirements. Thus, the user can study the obtained tuples and conduct the required research. Larger scales can help to diversify the tuples obtained from skyline and make skyline more comprehensible.\nIII. THE PROPOSED METHOD"

      "text" : "Defining topological relations can start with a fuzzy relation C in an universe U of regions. In other words, for u and v in U, C(u,v) is a degree between [0,1] that u and v are connected to each other with it.\nIn comparison with the RCC, C is a fuzzy reflective and symmetric relation. For generalization a fuzzy connection, a tnorm being used that is a mapping [0,1]2-[0,1] have the symmetric, associative and increasing properties. Also the boundary condition T(a,1) = a for all a in [0,1] is established. This can be shown that such a mapping behaves as a connection operator directly. At the following Łukasiewicz tnorm being used:\nTW(a, b) = max(0,a+b−1) (1)\nOther popular t-norms are the minimum TM and product TP that defining by TM(a,b) = min(a,b) and TP(a,b) = a·b for all a and b in [0,1].\nThere are several methods to obtain connection of fuzzy spatial features. A commentary that is especially noticeable is\nbased on nearness. Consider fuzzy relation R(α,β) in ℝn defined for each p and q in ℝn (α,β ≥ 0). R , p, q = 1, if d p, q ≤ α0 if d p, q > α + β , otherwise β ≠ 0 (2)\nWhere d is the euclidean distance in ℝn. For two points p and q in ℝn, by considering appropriate values for the parameters α and β, R , p, q shows the degree which p is near to q. Note that if d p, q ≤ α then p and q are considered to be quite near, while if d p, q > α + β then p and q are considered not near. There are linear gradual transition between these values; for example, if d p, q = α + $ then p and q are close to 0.5 degree. Using this notion of closeness of points, connection can be interpreted based on the closeness between vague regions. In particular, consider A and B be normalised fuzzy sets in ℝ% with a bounded support. The grade C , A, B indicates amount of connection between A to B is defined as follows: C , A, B = sup ∈ℝ+ T A p , sup ∈ℝ+ T R , p, q , B q (3) This shows amount of closeness between some points of A to some points of B. According to the above definition of connection and by considering regions as fuzzy regions, fuzzy RCC relations are definable by connection [18]."

      "text" : "The process of implementing fuzzy RCC relations is shown in Fig. 3. Implementing fuzzy RCC requires implementing the fuzzy connection. After that, using the fuzzy connection, other fuzzy RCC relations can be implemented. For implementing fuzzy connection, regions should be defined as fuzzy so the connection between these fuzzy regions can be examined.\nThe following code fragment performs this operation:\nCREATE TYPE FuzzyRegion AS ( core geometry , supportRadius float );\nThe code defines a type in PostGIS that for each fuzzy region relates a geometry and a number. The geometry is core of fuzzy region and the number indicates support radius of the fuzzy region, as can be seen in Fig. 2.\nThereby, the intended fuzzy region can be accessed and used in relations. For obtaining membership of each point in this fuzzy region if the point is in the supportRadius area, the following formula can be applied:\nMembership = 1 − 12345%67 892%4,:9;7 <= 9;4 >5 2=3 (4) Otherwise, if it is outside of the zero area and if it is in the core, a value of one is assigned as the membership of the point in the fuzzy region.

By comparing this rate and amount of diseases for each city, it can be observed that the results are closely related and similar but more details in comparison with the [10] is obtained. The study stated that the distribution of lead in the city of Isfahan directly related to the amount of diseases but they did not obtain the amount of this association. The implementation of fuzzy RCC on the data obtained and the amount is confirmed this association. This study uses the overlap relation and the degree of overlap between any city and distribution of lead were obtained.

In this implementation, by assigning different minimums for connectivity, those regions satisfying the minimums have been added.\nAt first stage the blue region with gid=124 satisfied the minimum connectivity requirement. At the next stage the yellow and the blue regions satisfied the minimum connectivity requirement. At the third phase the red areas are added to these areas. At the forth stage, the green regions satisfied the requirement and finally the pink one has been added to the other regions.\nD. Implementation of the proposed skyline on the Isfahan urban areas dataset\nSuppose we want to investigate the impact of factories on people or weather of the urban areas are closer to oil refinery and Isfahan steel company. An example can be analyzing amount of each type of diseases in these areas and to investigate the association between the diseases and its proximity to refineries. To obtain these areas, the basic skyline operator was applied on the Isfahan urban areas dataset and returns one area that was closer to the oil refinery and Isfahan steel company in 93ms but when the offered fuzzy skyline being applied on this dataset, we can obtain the further arbitrary amount of areas to be used in the study.\nThe TABLE II shows the results of implementation of the second phase. In all results of this table except the two last rows, number one for the support radius is being considered. This amount is 0.5 and 0.01, respectively, for the two last rows. The rows with bold letters just the R value has been applied but R and C are applied in the next rows. Runtime numbers in this table\nare in millisecond.

Although the lower number of division slightly reduces algorithm's accuracy but can increase execution speed very much.\nIn this paper, to use the potential of fuzzy region connection calculus in PostGIS, we proposed a method for implementing it in PostGIS to tackle real-world spatial analysis tasks. With fuzzy RCC we can calculate fuzzy spatial relations between fuzzy features. It has been shown that fuzzy RCC has a great potential for many targets. Afterward, we evaluated this method and used it on a dataset in comparison with distance function. We also used it for study about diseases spatial distribution and spatial effects relations. Fuzzy RCC helped in obtaining the measures of the relations that other method can't show it. As another application for fuzzy RCC it was used to fuzzification skyline operator base on users’ interests. The benefits of this model are flexibility, user-friendliness, resonable speed and usable results. With this implementation we also can obtain skyline for fuzzy regions. This fuzzy skyline model used in the healthcare and diseases research field. These methods provide many benefits\nbut have possibility for improving yet.

    "abstractText" : "Analyzing huge amounts of spatial data plays an important role in many emerging analysis and decision-making domains such as healthcare, urban planning, agriculture and so on. For extracting meaningful knowledge from geographical data, the relationships between spatial data objects need to be analyzed. An important class of such relationships are topological relations like the connectedness or overlap between regions. While realworld geographical regions such as lakes or forests do not have exact boundaries and are fuzzy, most of the existing analysis methods neglect this inherent feature of topological relations. In this paper, we propose a method for handling the topological relations in spatial databases based on fuzzy region connection calculus (RCC). The proposed method is implemented in PostGIS spatial database and evaluated in analyzing the relationship of diseases as an important application domain. We also used our fuzzy RCC implementation for fuzzification of the skyline operator in spatial databases. The results of the evaluation show that our method provides a more realistic view of spatial relationships and gives more flexibility to the data analyst to extract meaningful and accurate results in comparison with the existing methods.
