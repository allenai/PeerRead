      "text" : "In this paper, we present our SMT experiments from Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu and English to Hindi. From the set of languages involved, Bengali, Hindi and Marathi belong to the Indo-Aryan family and Tamil and Telugu are from Dravidian language family. All languages except English, have the same flexibility towards word order, canonically following the Subject-ObjectVerb (SOV) structure.\nWith reference to morphology Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu are more agglutinative compared to Hindi. It is known that SMT produces unknown words resulting in bad translation quality if morphological divergence between source and target languages is high. Koehn and Knight (2003), Popovic and Ney (2004), nd Popović et al. (2006) have demonstrated\nways to handle this issue with morphological segmentation of words in the source sentences before training the SMT system. To handle this morphological difference we have used suffix separation and compound word splitting developed by Pimpale et al. (2014) and Patel et al. (2014).\nFor English-Hindi SMT, we achieve better alignment using preordering (Patel et al., 2013) and stem as an alignment factor (Koehn and Hoang, 2007).\nAll machine translation (MT) systems suffer from Out of Vocabulary (OOV) words. These OOV words are mostly named entities, technical terms and foreign words which can be translated using transliteration system. We used Durrani et al. (2014), which is a fully unsupervised approach for developing a transliteration system using parallel corpus meant for the SMT training.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we discuss dataset and experimental setup. Section 3 discusses experiments and results. Submitted systems to the shared task are described in section 4 followed by the conclusion and future work in section 5."

The language model was trained using KenLM (Heafield, 2011) toolkit with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996). For factored SMT training source and target side stem were used as an alignment factor. Stemming was done using a lightweight stemmer for Hindi (Ramanathan and Rao, 2003). For English, we used porter stemmer (Minnen et al., 2001)."

Training LM with the huge amount of monolingual data like Bojar et al. (2014) (approx. 10GB ) required good computing resources (60GB RAM and 200GB storage space in the working dir). Also, Bojar et al. (2014) corpus contains unwanted symbols (<s>) for KenLM which we need to remove prior training."

Detailed evaluation scores for unconstrained systems, that is, systems using language model built on external data, are in Table 3. Significant improvement can be observed from the table when additional data was used for language modeling."

Adding more complex features for factored models and formulating preprocessing with better way could be the next step."
