      "text" : "Constraint satisfaction is often formalized as a homomorphism problem that takes as input two finite relational structures A (modeling variables and scopes of the constraints) and B (modeling the relations associated with constraints), and asks whether there is a homomorphism from A to B. Since the general problem is NP-hard, many restrictions have been considered in the literature, where the given structures have to satisfy additional conditions. In this paper, we are interested in restrictions imposed on the (usually said) left-hand structure, i.e., A must be taken from some suitably defined class A of structures, while B is any arbitrary structure from the class “−” of all finite structures.1 Thus, we face the so-called uniform constraint satisfaction problem, shortly denoted as CSP(A,−), where both structures are part of the input (nothing is fixed).\nThe decision problem CSP(A,−) has intensively been studied in the literature, and various classes of structures over which it can be solved in polynomial time have already been singled out (see [6, 9, 16, 1], and the references therein). These approaches, called decomposition methods, are based on properties of the hypergraph HA associated with each structure A ∈ A. In fact, it is well-known that, for the class Aa of all structures whose associated hypergraphs are acyclic, CSP(Aa,−) is efficiently solvable by just enforcing generalized arc consistency (GAC)—roughly, by filtering constraint relations until every pair of constraints having some variables X̄ in common agree on X̄ (that is, they have precisely the same set of allowed tuples of values on these variables X̄).\nLarger “islands of tractability” are then identified by generalizing hypergraph acyclicity. To this end, every decomposition method DM associates with any hypergraphHA some measure w of its cyclicity, called the DM-width of HA. The tractable classes A of instances (according to DM) are those (with\n1 Note that the finite property is a feature of this framework, and not a simplifying assumption. E.g., on structures with possibly infinite domains, the open question in [8] (just recently answered by [13] on finite structures) would have been solved in 1993 [21].\nhypergraphs) having bounded width, that is, whose degree of cyclicity is below some fixed threshold. For every instance A in such a class A and every structure B, the instance (A,B) can be solved in polynomial-time by exploiting the solutions of a set of suitable subproblems, that we call views, each one solvable in polynomial-time (in fact, exponential in the—fixed—width, for all known methods). In particular, the idea is to arrange some of these views in a tree, called decomposition, in order to exploit the known algorithms for acyclic instances. In fact, whenever such a tree exists, instances can be solved by just enforcing GAC on the available views, even without computing explicitly any decomposition. This very general approach traces back to the seminal database paper [8], and it is based on the graph-theoretic notion of tree-projection of the pair of hypergraphs (HA,HV), associated with the input structure A and with the structure V of the available views, respectively (tree projections are formally defined in Section 2).\nFor instance, assume that the fixed threshold on the width is k: in the generalized hypertree-width method [11], the available views are all subproblems involving at most k constraints from the given CSP instance; in the case of treewidth [19], the views are all subproblems involving at most k variables; for fractional hypertree-width, the views are all subproblems having fractional cover-width at most k (in fact, if we require that they are computable in polynomial-time, we may instead use those subproblems defined in [17] to compute a O(k3) approximation of this notion).\nNote that, for the special case of generalized hypertree-width, the fact that enforcing GAC on all clusters of k constraints is sufficient to solve the given instance, without computing a decomposition, has been re-derived in [5] (with proof techniques different from those in [8]). Moreover, [5] actually provided a stronger result, as it is proved that this property holds even if there is some homomorphically equivalent subproblem having generalized hypertree-width at most k. However, the corresponding only if result is missing in that paper, and characterizing the precise power of this GAC procedure for the views obtained from all clusters of k constraints (short: k-GAC) remained an open question. For any class A of instances having bounded arity (i.e., with a fixed maximum number of variables in any constraint scope of every instance of the class), the question has been answered in [2]: ∀A ∈ A, k-GAC is correct for every right-hand structure B if, and only if, the core of A has tree width at most k (recall that treewidth and generalized hypertree-width identify the same set of bounded-arity tractable classes). In its full version, the question has been answered recently in [13]: ∀A ∈ A, k-GAC is correct for every right-hand structure B if, and only if, for the core A′ of A, the pair (HA,HV) has a tree projection, where HV is the hypergraph associated with the views considered by the generalized hypertree-width method with the bound k.\nIn fact, for any recursively enumerable class of bounded-arity structures A, it is known that this method is essentially optimal: CSP(A,−) is solvable in polynomial time if, and only if, the cores of the structures in A have bounded treewidth (under standard complexity theoretic assumptions) [15]. Note that the latter condition may be equivalently as follows: for every A ∈ A there is some A′ homomorphically equivalent to A and such that its treewidth is below the required fixed threshold. For short, we say that such a class has bounded treewidth modulo homomorphic equivalence.\nThings with unbounded-arity classes are not that clear. Generalized hypertree-width does not characterize all classes of (arbitrary) structures where CSP(A,−) is solvable in polynomial time [16]. It seems that a useful characterization may be obtained by relaxing the typical requirement that views are computable in polynomial time, and by requiring instead that such tasks are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) [7]. In fact, towards establishing such characterization, it was recently shown in [18] that (under some reasonable technical assumptions) the problem CSP(H), i.e., CSP(A,−) restricted to the instances whose associated hypergraphs belong to the class H, is FPT if, and only if, hypergraphs in H have bounded submodular width—a new hypergraph measure more general than fractional hypertreewidth and, hence, than generalized hypertree-width.\nIt is worthwhile noting that the above mentioned tractability results for classes of instances defined modulo homomorphically equivalence are actually tractability results for the promise version of the\nproblem. In fact, unless P = NP, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that may check whether a given instance A actually belongs to such a class A. In particular, it has been observed by different authors [22, 4] that there are classes of instances having bounded treewidth modulo homomorphically equivalence for which answers computable in polynomial time cannot be trusted. That is, unless P = NP, there is no efficient way to distinguish whether a “yes” answer means that there is some solution of the problem, or that A 6∈ A.\nIn this paper, besides promise problems, we also consider the so-called no-promise problems, which seems more appealing for practical applications. In this case, either certified solutions are computed, or the promise A ∈ A is correctly disproved. For instance, the algorithm in [5] solves the no-promise search-problem of computing a homomorphism for a given CSP instance (A,B). This algorithm either computes such a homomorphism or concludes that HA has generalized hypertree-width greater than k."

      "text" : "While the structural tractability of deciding whether CSP instances admit solutions has been deeply studied in the literature, the structural tractability of the corresponding computation problem received considerably less attention so far [4], though this is certainly a more appealing problem for practical applications.\nIn this paper, we embark on this study, by focusing on the problem ECSP of enumerating (possibly projected) solutions. Since even easy instances may have an exponential number of solutions, tractability means here having algorithms that compute solutions with polynomial delay (WPD): An algorithm M solves WPD a computation problem P if there is a polynomial p(·) such that, for every instance of P of size n, M discovers if there are no solutions in time O(p(n)); otherwise, it outputs all solutions in such a way that a new solution is computed within O(p(n)) time from the previous one.\nBefore stating our contribution, it is worthwhile noting that there are different facets of the enumeration problem, and thus different research directions to be explored:\n(Which Decomposition Methods?) We considered the more general framework of the tree projections, where subproblems (views) may be completely arbitrary, so that our results are smoothly inherited by all (known) decomposition methods. We remark that this choice posed interesting technical challenges to our analysis, and called for solution approaches that were not explored in the earlier literature on traditional methods, such as treewidth. For instance, in this general context, we cannot speak anymore of “the core” of a structure, because different isomorphic cores may have different structural properties with respect to the available views.\n(Only full solutions or possibly projected solutions?) In this paper, an ECSP instance is a triple (A,B, O), for which we have to compute all solutions (homomorphisms) projected over a set of desired output variables O, denoted by AB[O]. We believe this is the more natural approach. Indeed, modeling real-world applications through CSP instances typically requires the use of “auxiliary” variables, whose precise values in the solutions are not relevant for the user, and that are (usually) filtered-out from the output. In these cases, computing all combinations of their values occurring in solutions means wasting time, possibly exponential time. Of course, this aspect is irrelevant for the problem of computing just one solution, but is crucial for the enumeration problem.\n(Should classes of structures be aware of output variables?) This is an important technical question. We are interested in identifying classes of tractable instances based on properties of their left-hand structures, while right-hand structures have no restrictions. What about output variables? In principle, structural properties may or may not consider the possible output variables, and in fact both approaches have been explored in the literature (see, e.g., [15]), and both approaches are dealt with in this paper. In the former output-aware case, possible output variables are suitably described in the instance structure. Unlike previous approaches that considered additional “virtual” constraints covering together all possible output variables [15], in this paper possible output variables are described as those variables\nX having a domain constraint dom(X), that is, a distinguished unary constraint specifying the domain of this variable. Such variables are said domain restricted. In fact, this choice reflects the classical approach in constraint satisfaction systems, where variables are typically associated with domains, which are heavily exploited by constraint propagation algorithms. Note that this approach does not limit the number of solutions, while in the tractable classes considered in [15] only instances with a polynomial number of (projected) solutions may be dealt with. As far as the latter case of arbitrary sets of output variables is considered, observe that in general stronger conditions are expected to be needed for tractability. Intuitively, since we may focus on any desired substructure, no strange situations may occur, and the full instance should be really tractable."

This algorithm generalizes to the tree projection framework the enumeration algorithm of projected solutions recently proposed for the special case of treewidth [4]. (2) Finally, we give some evidence that, for bounded arity classes of instances, we cannot do better than this. In particular, having bounded width tree-decompositions of the full structure seems a necessary condition for enumerating WPD. We speak of “evidence,” instead of saying that our result completely answers the open question in [15, 4], because our dichotomy theorem focuses on classes of structures satisfying the technical property of being closed under taking minors (in fact, the same property assumed in the first dichotomy result on the complexity of the decision problem on classes of graphs [14])."

The set of all possible homomorphisms from A to B is denoted by AB, while AB[X ] denotes the set of their restrictions to X .\nAn instance of the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a pair (A,B) where A is called a lefthand structure (short: ℓ-structure) and B is called a right-hand structure (short: r-structure). In the classical decision problem, we have to decide whether there is a homomorphism from A to B, i.e., whether AB 6= ∅. In an instance of the corresponding enumeration problem (denoted by ECSP) we are additionally given a set of output elements O ⊆ A; thus, an instance has the form (A,B, O). The goal is to compute the restrictions to O of all possible homomorphisms from A to B, i.e., AB[O]. If O = ∅, the computation problem degenerates to the decision one. Formally, let hφ : ∅ 7→ true denote (the constant mapping to) the Boolean value true; then, define AB[∅] = {hφ} (resp., AB[∅] = ∅) if there is some (resp., there is no) homomorphism from A to B.\nIn the constraint satisfaction jargon, the elements of A (the domain of the ℓ-structure A) are the variables, and there is a constraint C = (〈a1 . . . , ar〉, RB) for every tuple 〈a1 . . . , ar〉 ∈ RA and every relation symbol R ∈ τ . The tuple of variables is usually called the scope of C, while RB is called the relation of C. Any homomorphism from A to B is thus a mapping from the variables in A to the elements in B (often called domain values) that satisfies all constraints, and it is also called a solution (or a projected solution, if it is restricted to a subset of the variables).\nTwo relational structures A and A′ are homomorphically equivalent if there is a homomorphisms from A to A′ and vice-versa. A structure A′ is a substructure of A if A′ ⊆ A and RA ′\n⊆ RA, for each symbol R ∈ τ .

To this end, we associate with any ℓ-structure A a hypergraph HA = (A,H), whose set of nodes is equal to the set of variables A and where, for each constraint scope in RA, the set H of hyperedges contains a hyperedge including all its variables (no further hyperedge is in H). In particular, the v-structure AV = ℓ-DM(A) is associated with a hypergraph HAV = (A,H), whose set of nodes is the set of variables A and where, for each view R ∈ τV , the set H contains the hyperedge var(RAV ). In the following, for any hypergraph H, we denote its nodes and edges by nodes(H) and edges(H), respectively.\nExample 1. Consider the ℓ-structure A whose vocabulary just contains the binary relation symbol R, and such that RA = {〈F,E〉, 〈A,E〉, 〈A,C〉, 〈A,B〉, 〈B,C〉, 〈D,B〉, 〈D,C〉}. Such a simple onebinary-relation structure may be easily represented by the directed graph in the left part of Figure 1,\n2 A natural extension of this notion we may be to consider FPT decomposition methods, where functions ℓ-DM and r-DM are computable in fixed-parameter polynomial-time. For the sake of presentation and of space, we do not consider FPT decomposition methods in this paper, but our results can be extended to them rather easily.\nwhere edge orientation reflects the position of the variables in R. In this example, the associated hypergraph HA is just the undirected version of this graph. Let DM be a method that, on input A, builds the v-structure AV = ℓ-DM(A) consisting of the seven base views of the form Rt, for each tuple t ∈ RA, plus the three relations R1, R2, and R3 such that R AV 1 = {〈A,E, F 〉}, R AV 2 = {〈A,B,C, F 〉}, and RAV3 = {〈C,D, F 〉}. Figure 1 also reports HAV . ⊳\nA hypergraph H is acyclic iff it has a join tree [3], i.e., a tree JT (H), whose vertices are the hyperedges of H, such that if a node X occurs in two hyperedges h1 and h2 of H, then h1 and h2 are connected in JT (H), and X occurs in each vertex on the unique path linking h1 and h2 in JT (H).\nFor two hypergraphs H1 and H2, we write H1 ≤ H2 iff each hyperedge of H1 is contained in at least one hyperedge of H2. Let H1 ≤ H2. Then, a tree projection of H1 with respect to H2 is an acyclic hypergraph Ha such that H1 ≤ Ha ≤ H2. Whenever such a hypergraphHa exists, we say that the pair (H1,H2) has a tree projection (also, we say that H1 has a tree projection w.r.t. H2). The problem of deciding whether a pair of hypergraphs has a tree projection is called the tree projection problem, and it has recently been proven to be NP-complete [12].\nExample 2. Consider again the setting of Example 1. It is immediate to check that the pair of hypergraphs (HA,HAV ) does not have any tree projection. Consider instead the (hyper)graph HA′ reported on the right of Figure 1. The acyclic hypergraphHa is a tree projection of HA′ w.r.t. HAV . In particular, note that the hyperedge {A,B,C} ∈ edges(Ha) “absorbs” the cycle in HA′ , and that {A,B,C} is in its turn contained in the hyperedge {A,B,C, F} ∈ edges(HAV ). ⊳\nNote that all the (known) structural decomposition methods can be recast as special cases of tree projections, since they just differ in how they define the set of views to be built for evaluating the CSP instance. For instance, a hypergraph HA has generalized hypertree width (resp., treewidth) at most k if and only if there is a tree projection of HA w.r.t. Hℓ-hwk (A) (resp., w.r.t. Hℓ-twk (A)).\nHowever, the setting of tree projections is more general than such traditional decomposition approaches, as it allows us to consider arbitrary sets of views, which often require more care and different techniques. As an example, we shall illustrate below that in the setting of tree projections it does not make sense to talk about “the” core of an ℓ-structure, because different isomorphic cores may differently behave with respect to the available views. This phenomenon does not occur, e.g., for generalized hypertree decompositions, where all combinations of k constraints are available as views.\nExample 3. Consider the structure A illustrated in Example 1, and the structures A′ and A′′ over the same vocabulary as A, and such that RA ′ = {〈A,C〉, 〈A,B〉, 〈B,C〉} and RA ′′\n= {〈B,C〉, 〈D,B〉, 〈D,C〉}. The hypergraphsHA′ and HA′′ are reported in Figure 1. Note that A′ and A′′ are two (isomorphic) cores of A, but they have completely different structural properties.

In words, the result states that just enforcing generalized arc consistency on the available views is a sound and complete procedure to solve ECSP instances if, and only if, we are interested in (projected) solutions over output variables that are tp-covered and occur together in some available view. Thus, in these cases, all solutions can be computed in polynomial time. The more general case where output variables are arbitrary (i.e., not necessarily included in some available view) is explored in the rest of this paper.\nWe now leave the section by specializing Theorem 2 to the case of generalized hypertree decomposition and tree decomposition methods.\nTheorem 2-bis.

Preliminarily, it is easy to see that (2) in Theorem 2 may be equivalently stated as follows:\n(2’) For every r-structure B, for every r-structure BV that is legal w.r.t. AV and (A,B) and such that BV = GAC(AV ,BV), and for every relation R ∈ τV with O ⊆ var (RAV ), RBV [O] = AB[O].\nThe fact that (1) ⇒ (2) trivially follows from Theorem 2. We have to show that (2) ⇒ (1) holds as well. To this end, observe that if O is not tp-covered in ℓ-DM(A), by Theorem 2 (actually, (1) ⇒ (2′)), we can conclude the existence of: (1) an r-structure B, (2) an r-structure BV that is legal w.r.t. AV and (A,B) and such that BV = GAC(AV ,BV), and (3) a relation R ∈ τV with O ⊆ var(RAV ) such that RBV [O] 6= AB[O] (of course, RBV [O] ⊃ AB[O] by the legality of BV ). Consider now the r-structure B ′ V = r -hwk (A,B). Recall that each view in B ′ V contains all the solutions of the subproblem encoded by the constraints over which it is defined. Since BV = GAC(AV ,BV), it can be shown that each view in BV contains only solutions of the subproblem encoded by the constraints over which it is defined. Thus, for each relation R ∈ τV , RB ′ V ⊇ RBV holds, which implies RB ′\nV [O] ⊃ AB[O]. The same line of reasoning applies to the tree decomposition method. ⊳\nNote that if we consider decision problem instances (O = ∅) and the treewidth method (AV = ℓ-twk (A)), from Theorem 2-bis, we (re-)obtain the nice characterization of [2] about the relationship between k-local consistency and treewidth modulo homomorphic equivalence. If we consider generalized hypertree-width (AV = ℓ-hwk (A)), we get the answer to the corresponding open question for the unbounded arity case, that is, the precise power of the procedure enforcing k-union (of constraints) consistency (i.e., the power of the algorithm for the decision problem described in [5])."

This procedure backtracks over the output variables {X1, . . . , Xm}: At each step i, it tries to assign a value to Xi from its domain view,4 and defines this value as the unique one available in that domain, in order to “propagate” such an assignment over all other views. This is accomplished by enforcing generalized arc-consistency each time the procedure is invoked. Eventually, whenever an assignment is computed for all the variables in O, this solution is returned in output, and the algorithm proceeds by backtracking again trying different values.\n4 With an abuse of notation, in the algorithm we denote by dom(X) the base view in τV associated with the input constraint dom(A) ∈ τ (in fact, no confusion may arise because the algorithm only works on views).\n4.1 Tight Characterizations for the Correctness of ComputeAllSolutionsDM\nTo characterize the correctness of ComputeAllSolutionsDM, we need to define a structural property that is related to the one stated in Definition 1. Below, differently from Definition 1 where the set of output variables O is treated as a whole, each variable in O has to be tp-covered as a singleton set.\nDefinition 3. Let (A,B, O) be an ECSP instance. We say that (A, O) is tp-covered through DM if there is a core A′ of A ⊎ ⊎\nX∈O S{X} such that (HA′ ,Hℓ-DM(A)) has a tree projection.\nNote that the above definition is purely structural, because (the right-hand structure) B plays no role there. In fact, we next show that this definition captures classes of instances where ComputeAllSolutionsDM is correct.\nTheorem 3. Let DM be a decomposition method, let A be an ℓ-structure, and let O ⊆ A be a set of variables. Assume that (A, O) is tp-covered through DM. Then, for every r-structure B, ComputeAllSolutionsDM computes the set A B[O].\nProof (Sketch). Let Bin be any r-structure. Preliminarily observe that if the original input instance, say Iin = (Ain,Bin, O), is tp-covered through DM, the same property is enjoyed by its equivalent domainrestricted version, say I0 = (A,B0, O), computed in the starting phase of the algorithm. Thus, there is a core A′ of A ⊎ ⊎\nX∈O S{X} such that (HA′ ,HAV ) has a tree projection, where AV = ℓ-DM(A). This entails that, ∀X ∈ O, {X} is tp-covered in HAV . It is sufficient to show that, if A B 0 6= ∅, at the generic call of Propagate with i as its first argument, activeValues is initialized at Step 2 with a non-empty set that contains all those values that Xi ∈ O may take, in any solution of (A,B0) extending the current partial solution 〈a1, ..., ai−1〉; otherwise (AB0 = ∅), activeValues = ∅, and the algorithm correctly terminates with an empty output without ever entering the for cycle. For the sake of presentation, we just prove what happens in the first call.The generalization to the generic case is then straightforward.\nLet i = 1 and assume that B′V := GAC(AV ,BV) has been computed. From the tp-covered property of variables in O and Theorem 2, it follows that ∀X ∈ O, its domain view dom(X) is such that dom(X)B ′\nV = AB0 [{X}]. Thus, all values in the domain views associated with output variables occur in some solutions. This holds in particular for dom(X1) that is empty if, and only if, AB0 = ∅, in which case the cycle is skipped and the algorithm immediately halts with an empty output. Assume now that this is not the case, so that activeValues = AB0 [{X1}] 6= ∅, and let a1 be the chosen value at Step 3. Consider a new instance I1 = (A,B1, O) where the domain constraint for X1 contains the one value a1. From the above discussion it follows that AB1 6= ∅, and clearly the solutions of I1 are all and only those of I0 that extend the partial solution 〈a1〉. Moreover, it is easy to check that the r-structure B′V obtained after the execution of Step 7 is legal w.r.t. (A,B1), and recall that nothing is changed in the pair (A, O), which is (still) tp-covered through DM. Therefore, when we call recursively Propagate at Step 8 with i = 2, we are in the same situation as in the first call, but going to enumerate the solutions of I1. At the end of this call, we just repeat this procedure with the next available value for X1, say a2, until all elements in activeValues = AB0 [{X1}] have been considered (and propagated). ⊳\nBelow, we complete the picture by showing that Definition 3 also delineates the necessary conditions for the correctness of ComputeAllSolutionsDM, in the case where DM is a decomposition method in {twk, hwk}.\nTheorem 4. Let DM be a decomposition method in {twk, hwk}, let A be an ℓ-structure, and let O ⊆ A be a set of variables. Assume that, for every r-structure B, ComputeAllSolutionsDM computes A\nB[O]. Then, (A, O) is tp-covered through DM.\nProof (Sketch). Assume that (A, O) is not tp-covered through DM, and let O′ ⊆ O be a maximal set of output variables such that (A, O′) is tp-covered throughDM. In the case whereO′ = ∅, there is no coreA′ of A such that (HA′ ,Hℓ-DM(A)) has a tree projection. Thus, we can apply Theorem 2-bis and conclude that there are an r-structure B, and a relation R ∈ τV such that AB has a solution while RGAC(ℓ-DM(A),BV ) is empty, withBV = r-DM(A,B). It follows that ComputeAllSolutionsDM will not produce any output. Consider now the case where O′ 6= ∅, and where any X ∈ O \\O′ is a variable such that (A, O′ ∪ {X}) is not tp-covered through DM. Let Ā be the relational structure A ⊎ ⊎\nY ∈O′ S{Y }, which is such that (HĀ,Hℓ-DM(A)) has a tree projection. Then, {X} is not tp-covered in ℓ-DM(Ā). By Theorem 2-bis, there are an r-structure B, and a relation R ∈ τV with {X} ⊆ var (RĀV ) such that RGAC(ĀV ,BV)[{X}] ⊃ Ā\nB[{X}], where BV = r-DM(Ā,B). In fact, we can show that such a “counterexample” structure B can be chosen in such a way that there are (full) solutions h for the problem having the following property: some values in RGAC(ĀV ,BV)[{X}] \\ ĀB[{X}] belongs to the generalized arc consistent structure B′ where variables in O′ are fixed according to h[O′]. Thus while enumerating such a solution h[O′], ComputeAllSolutionsDM generates wrong extensions of this solution to the variable X . ⊳"

      "text" : "We next analyze the complexity of ComputeAllSolutionsDM.\nTheorem 5. Let A be an ℓ-structure, and O ⊆ A be a set of variables. If (A, O) is tp-covered through DM, then ComputeAllSolutionsDM runs WPD.\nProof. Assume that (A, O) is tp-covered through DM. By Theorem 3, we know that ComputeAllSolutionsDM computes the set A\nB[O]. Thus, if the algorithm does not output any tuple, we can immediately conclude that the ECSP instance does not have solutions. Concerning the running time, we preliminary notice that the initialization steps are feasible in polynomial time. In particular, computing AV and BV is feasible in polynomial time, by the properties of the decomposition method DM (see Section 3). To characterize the complexity of the recursive invocations of Propagate, we have to consider instead two cases.\nIn the case where there is no solution, we claim that the r-structure B′V obtained by enforcing generalized arc consistency in the first invocation of Propagate (i.e., for i = 1) is empty. Indeed, since (A, O) is tp-covered through DM, then {X1} is tp-covered in AV—just compare Definition 1 and Definition 3. It follows that we can apply Theorem 2 on the set {X1} in order to conclude that, for every relation R ∈ τV with X1 ∈ var(RAV ), RGAC(AV ,BV)[{X1}] = AB[{X1}]. Since, AB[O] is empty, the above implies that GAC(AV ,BV) is empty too. Thus, ComputeAllSolutionsDM invokes just once Propagate, where the only operation carried out is to enforce generalized arc consistency, which is feasible in polynomial time.\nConsider now the case where AB[O] is not empty. Then, the first solution is computed after m recursive calls of the procedure Propagate, where the dominant operation is to enforce generalized arc consistency on the current pair (AV ,BV). In particular, by the arguments in the proof of Theorem 3, it follows that Propagate does not have to backtrack to find this solution: after enforcing generalized arc consistency at step i, any active value for Xi is guaranteed to occur in a solution with the current fixed values for the previous variables Xj , 1 ≤ j < i. Since GAC can be enforced in polynomial time, this solution can be computed in polynomial time as well.\nTo complete the proof, observe now that any solution is provided in output when Propagate is invoked for i = m. After returning a tuple of values 〈a1, ..., am〉, Propagate may need to backtrack to a certain index i′ ≥ 1 having some further (different) value ai′ to be processed, fix Xi′ with this value, propagate this assignment, and continue by processing variable Xi′+1. Thus, at most m invocations of Propagate are needed to compute the next solution, and no backtracking step may occur before we found it. Therefore, ComputeAllSolutionsDM runs WPD. ⊳\nBy the above theorem and the definition of domain restricted variables, the following can easily be established.\nCorollary 1. Let A be any class of ℓ-structures such that, for each A ∈ A, (A, drv (A)) is tp-covered through DM. Then, for every r-structure B, and for every set of variables O ⊆ drv(A), the ECSP instance (A,B, O) is solvable WPD.\nIn the case of bounded arity structures and if the (hyper)tree width is the chosen decomposition method, it is not hard to see that the result in Corollary 1 is essentially tight. Indeed, the implication (2) ⇒ (1) in the theorem below easily follows from the well-known dichotomy for the decision version [15], which is obtained in the special case of ECSP instances without output variables (O = ∅).\nTheorem 6. Assume FPT 6= W [1]. Let A be any class of ℓ-structures of bounded arity. Then, the following are equivalent:\n(1) A has bounded treewdith modulo homomorphic equivalence; (2) For every A ∈ A, for every r-structure B, and for every set of variables O ⊆ drv(A), the ECSP\ninstance (A,B, O) is solvable WPD.\nActually, from an application perspective of this result, we observe that there is no efficient solution for the no-promise problem for such classes, by actually proving a slightly stronger statement. We say that a pair (h, c) is a certified projected solution of an instance (A,B, O) if, by using the certificate c, one may check in polynomial-time (w.r.t. the size of (A,B, O)) whether h ∈ AB[O]. For instance, any full solution extending h is clearly such a certificate. If O = ∅, h is also empty, and c is intended to be a certificate that (A,B) is a “Yes” instance of the decision CSP. Finally, we assume that the empty output is always a certified answer, in that it entails that the input is a “No” instance, without the need for an explicit certificate of this property.\nProposition 1. The following problem is NP-hard: Given any ECSP instance (A,B, O), compute a certified solution in AB[O], whenever (A, O) is tp-covered through DM; otherwise, there are no requirements and any output is acceptable. Hardness holds even if DM is the treewidth method with k = 2, the vocabulary contains just one binary relation symbol, and O = ∅.\nProof. We show a polynomial-time Turing reduction from the NP-hard 3-colorability problem. Let M be a Turing transducer that solves the problem, that is, whenever (A, O) is tp-covered through DM, at the end of a computation on a given input (A,B, O) its output tape contains a certified solution in AB[O], otherwise, everything is acceptable. In particular, we do not pretend that M recognizes whether the above condition is fulfilled.\nThen, we use M as an oracle procedure within a polynomial time algorithm that solves the 3- colorability problem. Let G = (N,E) be any given graph, and assume w.l.o.g. that it contains a triangle {n1, n2}, {n2, n3}, and {n3, n1}. (Otherwise, select any arbitrary vertex n1 of G and connect it to two fresh vertices n2 and n3, also connected to each other. It is easy to check that this new graph is 3-colorable if, and only if, the original graph G is 3-colorable, as the two fresh vertices have no connections with the rest of the graph.) Build the (classical) binary CSP (AG,B3c) where the vocabulary contains one relation symbol RE , and the set of variables is AG = N . Moreover, R AG E = {〈ni, nj〉 | {ni, nj} ∈ E}, and R B3c E = {〈c, c ′〉 | c 6= c′, {c, c′} ⊆ {1, 2, 3}}. Consider the treewidth method for k = 2, and compute in polynomial time the pair (AV ,BV ) where AV = ℓ-tw2 (AG) and BV = r -tw2 (B3c). In particular, observe that the hypergraphHAV contains a hyperedge {ni, nj, nl} for every triple of vertices of G.\nIt is well-known and easy to see that G is 3-colorable if, and only if, AB3cG 6= ∅, that is, if there is a homomorphism from AG to a triangle (indeed, B3c is a triangle). Therefore, if G is 3-colorable, the\ntriangle substructure A′ such that RA ′\nE = {〈ni, nj〉 | {i, j} ⊂ {1, 2, 3} | i 6= j} is homomorphically equivalent to AG. Moreover, in this case the hypergraph consisting of the single hyperedge {n1, n2, n3} is a tree projection of HA′ w.r.t. HAV , or, equivalently, the treewidth of A\n′ is 2. Now, run M on input (AG,B3c, ∅) and consider its first output certificate c—say, for the sake of presentation, a full solution for the problem. Then check in polynomial time whether c is a legal certificate—in our exemplification, whether it encodes a solution of the given instance. If this is the case, we know that G is 3-colorable; otherwise, we conclude that G is not 3-colorable. Indeed, M must be correct on 3-colorable graphs, because there exists a tree projection of HA′ (and thus of any core of AG—note that O = ∅ and thus there is no further requirement) w.r.t. HAV . Since all these steps are feasible in polynomial-time, we are done. ⊳"

      "text" : "In this section we consider structural properties that are independent of output variables, so that tractability must hold for any desired sets of output variables. For this case, we are able to provide certified solutions WPD, which seems the more interesting notion of tractability for actual applications.\nFigure 3 shows the ComputeCertifiedSolutionsDM algorithm computing all solutions of an ECSP instance, with a certificate for each of them. The algorithm is parametric w.r.t. any chosen decomposition method DM, and resembles in its structure the ComputeAllSolutionsDM algorithm. The main difference is that, after having found an assignment 〈a1, ..., am〉 for the variables in O, ComputeCertifiedSolutionsDM still iterates over the remaining variables in order to find a certificate for that projected solution. Of course, ComputeCertifiedSolutionsDM does not backtrack over the possible values to be assigned to the variables in {Xm+1, ..., Xn}, since just one extension suffices to certify that this partial solution can be extended to a full one. Thus, we break the cycle after an element 〈ai〉 is picked from its domain and correctly propagated, for each i > m, so that in these cases we eventually backtrack directly to i = m (to look for a new projected solution).\nNote that ComputeCertifiedSolutionsDM incrementally outputs various solutions, but it halts the computation if the current r-structure B′V becomes empty. As an important property of the algorithm, even when this abnormal exit condition occurs, we are guaranteed that all the elements provided as output until this event are indeed solutions. Moreover, if no abnormal termination occurs, then we are guaranteed that all solutions will actually be computed. Correctness follows easily from the same arguments used for ComputeAllSolutionsDM, by observing that, whenever (HA,Hℓ-DM(A)) has a tree projection, the full set of variables A is tp-covered through DM.\nTheorem 7. Let A be an ℓ-structure, and O ⊆ A be a set of variables. Then, for every r-structure B, ComputeCertifiedSolutionsDM computes WPD a subset of the solutions in A\nB[O], with a certificate for each of them. Moreover,\n– If ComputeCertifiedSolutionsDM outputs “DM failure”, then (HA,Hℓ-DM(A)) does not have a tree projection; – otherwise, ComputeCertifiedSolutionsDM computes WPD A B[O].\nMoreover, we next give some evidence that, for bounded arity classes of instances, we cannot do better than this. In particular, having bounded width tree-decompositions of the full structure seems a necessary condition for the tractability of the enumeration problem WPD w.r.t. arbitrary sets of output variables (and for every r-structure).\nThe main gadget of the proof that tree-decompositions are necessary for tractability is based on a nice feature of grids. Figure 4 shows the basic idea for the simplest case of a relational structure Au with only one relation symbol Ru such that RAuu is (the edge set of) an undirected grid. Then, any substructure A1 of Au where RA1u contains just one tuple is a core of Au. However, if we consider the variant of Au where there is a domain constraint dom(X) for every corner X of the grid (depicted with the circles in the figure), then the unique core is the whole structure. In fact, we next prove that this property holds for any relational structure whose Gaifman graph is a grid.\nLemma 1. Let A be an ℓ-structure whose Gaifman graph is a grid G. Moreover, let O ⊆ A be the set of its four corners, and assume they are domain restricted, i.e., O ⊆ drv(A). Then, A is a core.\nProof (Sketch). Let G be such a k1 × k2 grid, and consider any homomorphism h that maps A to any of its substructures A′. Since the four corners v1,1, v1,k2 , vk1,1, vk1,k2 are domain restricted, h(X) = X must hold for each of them (as 〈X〉 is the one tuple of its domain constraint dom(X)A). We say that such elements are fixed.\nConsider the first row r1 = (v1,1, v1,2, . . . , v1,k2) of G. We have seen that its endpoints, which are grid-corners, are fixed. It is easy to check that h cannot map the path r1 to any path that is longer than r1. However, r1 is the shortest path connecting the fixed endpoints v1,1 and v1,k2 , and hence it must be mapped to itself. That is, h(X) = X for every element X occurring in r1, and thus, by the same reasoning, for every element X occurring in the last row, and in the first and the last columns of the grid. It follows that the endpoints v2,1 and v2,k2 of the second row r2 are fixed as well, and we may apply the same argument to show that all elements occurring in r2 are fixed, too. Eventually, row after row, we get that all elements of A are fixed, and thus the identity mapping is the only possible endomorphism for A, which entails that A is a core. ⊳\nWe also exploit the grid-based construction from [15], whose properties relevant to this paper may be summarized as follows.\nProposition 2 ([15]). Let k ≥ 2 and K = ( k 2 )\n, and let A be any τ -structure such that the (k × K)grid is a minor of the Gaifman graph of a core of A. For any given graph G, one can compute in polynomial time (w.r.t. ‖G‖) a τ -structure BA,G such that G contains a k-clique if, and only if, there is a homomorphism from A to BA,G.\nWe can now prove the necessity of bounded treewidth for tractability WPD.\nTheorem 8. Assume FPT 6= W[1]. Let A be any bounded-arity recursively-enumerable class of ℓstructures closed under taking minors. Then, the following are equivalent:\n(1) A has bounded treewdith; (2) For every A ∈ A, for every r-structure B, and for every set of variables O ⊆ A, the ECSP instance\n(A,B, O) is solvable WPD.\nProof. The fact that (1) ⇒ (2) holds follows by specializing Theorem 7 to the tree decomposition method. We next focus on showing that (2) ⇒ (1) also holds.\nLet A be such a bounded-arity class of ℓ-structures closed under taking minors, and having unbounded treewidth. From this latter property, by the Excluded Grid Theorem [20] it follows that every grid is a minor of the Gaifman graph of some ℓ-structure in A. Moreover, because this class is closed under taking minors, every grid is actually the Gaifman graph of some ℓ-structure in A.\nAssume there is a deterministic Turing machine M that is able to solve with polynomial delay any ECSP instance (A,B, O) such that A ∈ A. We show that this entails the existence of an FPT algorithm to solve the W[1]-hard problem p-CLIQUE, which of course implies FPT = W[1].\nLet G be a graph instance of the p-CLIQUE problem, with the fixed parameter k ≥ 2. We have to decide whether G has a clique of cardinality k. We enumerate the recursively enumerable class A until we eventually find an ℓ-structure A whose Gaifman graph is the (k × K)-grid. Let τ be its vocabulary. Note that searching for this structure A depends on the fixed parameter k only (in particular, it is independent of G).\nLet O ⊆ A be the variables at the four corners of this grid, and let A′ be the extension of A such that, for every variable X ∈ O, the vocabulary τ ′ of A′ contains the domain relation-symbol dom(X). Thus, the Gaifman graph of A′ is the same (k×K)-grid as for A, but its four corners are domain-restricted in A\n′ (O ⊆ drv (A′)). From Lemma 1, A′ is a core. Recall now the grid-based construction in Proposition 2: We can build in polynomial time (w.r.t.\n‖G‖) a structure B′ A′,G such that there is a homomorphism from A ′ to B′ A′,G if, and only if, G has a clique of cardinality k. Consider the ECSP instance (A,B, O) where A ∈ A by construction, and B is the restriction of B ′ A′,G to the vocabulary τ . Thus, compared with B ′ A′,G, the r-structureB may miss the domain constraint dom(X) for some output variable X ∈ O. It is easy to see that h is a homomorphism from A′ to B′ A′,G if, and only if, h is a homomorphism from A to B such that, for every X ∈ O, h(X) ∈ dom(X)B ′\nA′,G . Therefore, to decide whether such a homomorphism exists (and hence to solve the clique problem), we can just enumerate WPD the set of solutions AB[O] and check whether the four domain constraints on the corners of A′ are satisfied by any of these solutions. Now, recall that B′\nA′,G is built in polynomial time from G, and thus every variable may take only a polynomial number of values, and of course all combinations of four values from dom(X)B ′\nA′,G , X ∈ O, are polynomially many. It follows that M actually takes polynomial time for computing AB[O], and one may then check in polynomial time whether the additional domain constraints in A′ are satisfied or not by some solution in AB[O].\nBy combining the above ingredients, we got an FPT algorithm to decide whether G has a clique of cardinality k. ⊳"

However, constraint satisfaction comes in practice as a computation problem where the focus is either on finding one solution, or on enumerating all solutions, possibly projected over some given set of output variables. The paper investigates the structural tractability of the problem of enumerating (possibly projected) solutions, where tractability means here computable with polynomial delay (WPD), since in general exponentially many solutions may be computed. A general framework based on the notion of tree projection of hypergraphs is considered, which generalizes all known decomposition methods. Tractability results have been obtained both for classes of structures where output variables are part of their specification, and for classes of structures where computability WPD must be ensured for any possible set of output variables. These results are shown to be tight, by exhibiting dichotomies for classes of structures having bounded arity and where the tree decomposition method is considered.",
