      "text" : "In recent years, neural machine transaiton (NMT) (Cho et al. 2014b; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014; Cho et al. 2014a) has achived great success in some language pairs, over the state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) (Koehn, Hoang, and Birch 2007). The encoder-decoder architecture is widely used for NMT, the principle behind which is that: encoding the meaning of the input into a concept space and performing translation based on this encoding. This ‘meaning encoding’ principle leads to a deeper understanding and learning of the translation rules, and hence a better translation than conventional statistic machine translation (SMT) that considers only surface forms, i.e., words and phrases.\nHowever, even attention-based NMT uses bi-directional RNN to encode the source sentence in two directions, the representation contains only the sequential relationship among the words in the source sentence, and, as the length of the source sentence increases, the encoded vector may forget the information in the words fay away from it, bidirectional encoder may solve this problem in some degree; However, sentences in natural language are regarded as relational, which means it may have grammatical relation (such\nCopyright © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

We validate our proposed model on NIST Chinese-English translation task. Experiment results show that, after incorporated with RN , the attentionbased NMT model can generate a entangled sequential representation of source sentence by recognizing relations between words, then build higher quality dynamic alignment according to these relations, finally, produce more accurate performance for machine translation further."

We start this section by describing the attention-based NMT model."

By concatenating the convolutional representation of some word w with those of all other ones, the word w is related to a set of vectors; Then, through another Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layer, the word w will be represented by another set of vectors, which might contains the information of relations with all other words in the sentence except this source word; At last, we sum these vectors together to generate the output for word w (see Figure 3)\nMLPDEC: The last module of the relation layer called MLP decoder changes the representation dimension for each source word and get the final representation of each source word which contains the relations information from all other words, we call it as entangled sequential representation. Accordingly, for convenient distinction, we name the initial representation generated by NMT encoder as recurrent sequential representation.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the entangled sequential representations together with recurrent sequential representations of all source words are feed into the attention layer of NMT decoder, we update the Formula ( 5) here\ng(sj−1,hi) = v T a tanh(Wast−1 +Uahi + ri) (9)\nwhere ri is the entangled sequential representation of each source word xi created by relation layer. ri is calculated by taking the i-th vector of matrix r\nr = MLPDEC(GPL(CENC(h))) (10)\nAs noted in Formula ( 10), the recurrent sequential representations are encoded by the convolutional layer to be fixed-dimension vectors, then GPL is adopted to collect information propogated between each vectors pair and feed new vectors hi to the MLP decoder layer to recover vector\ndimension back. hi is the sum of the i-th column vectors produced by GPL layer as shown in Formula ( 11), MLPDEC is actually a multi-layer fully connected network.\nhi = ∑\nj\nGPL(hi,hj) (11)\nResidual connections is adopted from recurrent sequential representation to entangled sequential representation by addition, multiplication or concatenation operation to generate final output."

      "heading" : "Linguistic Analysis",
      "text" : "To explore the reason why translation performance becomes better, we analyse from three following aspects:\nTranslation results Table 3 shows several translation samples produced by the NMT strong baseline model and the proposed model. By comparison, from the boldfaced section of our translation result, we could conclude that the NMT baseline model often miss some information of the source sentence (we call under-translation), such as the baseline translation of the first example do not produce the information about when i arrive at the intersection, RNNSEARCH? model loses the information about haircut when generating the target text for the second sample; It similarly happens that, for the sixth one, baseline model fails to capture the latter clause with adversative relation and so on; Besides, another phenomenon we can get is that the longer the source sentence is, it is easier to ignore important imformations for the baseline model; While our model could capture all the information source sentence contains successfully.\nSpecifically, Whether RNN in the encoder and decoder of baseline model or the CNN are both weak to capture the long dependency information, RNNs are skilled in modeling the order imformation of the sequence, while CNNs mainly focus on local features around some specific word. However, facts prove that proposed relation layer integrates several CNN layers into Bidirectional RNN or based on Bi-RNN, which alleviates the both disadvantages effectively.\nWord Alignment Along with the translation results, we also produce the word alignment matrix based on each target word’s attention probability distribution over the whole source sentence for each decoding step. We randomly sample two source sentences from the testing data set, and output both of their alignment matrics on the baseline model RNNSEARCH? and the proposed model RNNSEARCH?+RN.\nAs shown in Figure 5, for the first example, from the view of source side, the source chinese word yi is contributed to generate three english words the, is and for, which obviously do not make sense, knowledges in the grammar level show that the word yi is only aligned to the english word for, just like the result of our model; Beside, on the target’s ground,\none single word in the english phrase should be aligned to specific source word together with other words in the phrase, such as english new and is; For the second sentence, unlike the baseline model, our model produce the correct translation jazz music for jueshi yinyue and the right alignment, the together with origin is aligned to the source word, while baseline model mistakenly aligns the to two source words amost equably.\nThe baseline RNNSEARCH? model only use RNN to model the representation of the source sentence and the generation of the target words. Thus, it may ignore the long-distance information; More importantly, because bidirectional RNN models the source sentence sequentially, so, each encoded source word contains the information of all words before it and after it, the generation of one specific\ntarget word may be misled by some irrelative or translated source words and target words (Tu et al. ). While our relation network make more explicit guidance for the generation of each decoding step, thereby producing more unambiguous word alignment.\nRelationship of Translation with Source Length the performance of the conventional RNN Encoder–Decoder (Cho et al. 2014b) dramatically drops as the length of the sentences increases, and the RNNsearch model are already more robust to the length of the sentences; However, our proposed model behaves stronger for the long source sentences than RNNsearch model (shown in Figure 4).\nIn the figure, we compare our model with RNNSEARCH? and TRANSFORMER to observe which one have an advan-\ntage over translating long source sentences; For short sentence, three models all get close BLEU, our model only performs slightly better than two others; the performance of three models drops together when the length of the source sentences beyonds 50, textscTransformer model has striking decline, RNNSEARCH? generates better results comparing to Google’s model, our model outperforms two others and gets best translations on the long sentences including more than 50 words, which proves that proposed model acts more robust capability to translate long sentence."

Concretely, for 1http://www.statmt.org/moses/ 2https://github.com/kpu/kenlm 3https://github.com/moses-smt/giza-pp 4http://pytorch.org\nall NMT baseline systems, we employ a little bit different settings with (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014): we filter the training sentence-pairs whose source sentence or target sentence contains more than 50 tokens, the dimension of source and target word embedding is 512, dimensions of all hidden units in both encoder and decoder RNN are all 512, the vocabulary sizes of the source and target side are both 30K. We initialize all weight matrices or vectors by using uniform distribution, all parameters are updated once for each mini-batch by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the batch size option is 80, in addition, the learning rate is adjusted by optimizer AdaDelta (Zeiler 2012) with the coefficient ρ = 0.9 used for computing a running average of squared gradients, and the term = 10e-06 added to the denominator to improve numerical stability. Dropout rate 0.5 is applied in the training process, without dropout and with beam size 10 in decoding. At last, best model on validation set is used to generate translations of testing data.\n• RNNSEARCH∗: The decoder of the standard RNNsearch model is changed into the improved one, with all other configurations and training details the same with the GROUNDHOG system above. For leaky ReLU activation function, we use the coefficient 0.1 to control the angle of the negative slope.\n• TRANSFORMER: We evaluate this model on a open source platform sockeye5 developed by amazon which is a sequence-to-sequence framework with a focus on NMT based on Apache MXNet, configuration is set by default with both the source and target vocabulary sizes the same as those of above NMT systems. We set layers number to be 4 for both encoder and decoder with no dropout, model hidden size and attention head number are 512 and 8 respectively. During training, smoothed cross entropy loss is adopted and weight tying is used to regularize weight parameters in classification layer.\n5https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye"

Similarly, convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced into NMT for speeding recently, however, CNN focus on capturing the local feature of the sequence; To relieve this issue, we incorporate a relation network into the standard encoder-decoder framework to enhance information-propogation in neural network, ensuring that the information of the source sentence can flow into the decoder adequately. Experiments show that proposed framework outperforms the statistical MT model and the state-ofart NMT model significantly on two data sets with different scales.",
