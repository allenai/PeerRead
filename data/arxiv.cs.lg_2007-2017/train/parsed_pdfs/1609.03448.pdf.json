      "text" : "Graphs offer a way to describe and explain relationships in complex datasets, a central entity of modern data analysis, where data deluge is prominent [1–3]. In particular, the nodes of the graph denote the entities and the edges encode the pairwise relationship between these entities. Such entities are referred to as graph signals. Examples of such complex-structured data beyond traditional time-series include data residing on brain networks, gene networks, social networks, recommendation systems, transportation networks, and so on.\nHaving a good quality graph is central to any graph signal processing or machine learning task. In this paper, we are interested in the problem of learning the hidden graph topology behind the data. Due to the sheer quantity of data, we are motivated to select the simplest graphical models that adequately explain the data. In particular, we are interested in learning a sparse graph, i.e., a graph with a limited number of edges that adequately explains the input (or training) data. To realize this, we make a simple, but widely used assumption [1,4] that the data is smooth with respect to the discovered graph.\nThe contributions in this paper are threefold. First, we model the graph learning problem as an edge selection problem, where we parameterize the graph through a sparse edge sampling vector. In particular, the proposed model provides an elegant handle to control the number of edges, thus the graph sparsity. Second, for the case\nThis work is supported in part by the KAUST-MIT-TUD consortium under grant OSR-2015-Sensors-2700 and the US Army Research Office under grant W911NF-15-1-0479.\nwhen the true smooth graph signals are given, the graph learning problem can be solved optimally, and the solution is based on simple rank ordering. Finally, given the noisy graph signals, i.e., for the joint sparse graph learning and denoising problem, we provide a onestep solution based on convex optimization as well as an algorithm based on alternating minimization.\nThe problem of learning the graph Laplacian or the weighted adjacency matrix from smooth graph signals has been considered before [4,5]. Learning sparse graphs from the true graph signals, which is the problem we consider in Section 3, has been studied in [5]. There the graph learning problem is posed as a constrained optimization problem with the constraint set being the set of valid adjacency matrices, and the optimization problem is solved using an iterative primal-dual algorithm. In contrast, our modelling greatly simplifies the solution to simple rank ordering. Such a modelling is inspired from [6], where the problem to design edge weights that maximize the algebraic connectivity of the graph has been addressed. In [4], the joint graph learning and denoising problem has been addressed, i.e., the problem that we study in Section 4. An alternating minimization algorithm is proposed, alternating between graph learning and denoising, where the graph learning optimization problem involves a search over the space of all valid graph Laplacians. On the contrary, we show that this problem can be solved in one-step and it boils down to the design of a sparse edge sampling function.\nGraph topology identification is also investigated in [7] under the assumption that the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian are known, which is a much stronger assumption. Although the eigenvectors can be computed from graph data (or the sample covariance matrix) when it is stationary with respect to the graph [8, 9], the graph signals need not always be vertex stationary. In any case, the estimated eigenvectors are not error free due to limited data records. In most of the existing approaches [4,5,7], graph sparsification is (or can be) achieved by penalizing the ℓ1-norm of the graph Laplacian matrix, adjacency matrix or the shift operator, however, there is no explicit handle to control the number of edges, unlike the proposed approach. In a related line of research, [10, 11] investigate computing sparse graphs that approximate a given graph spectrally, which means that their Laplacian matrices have similar quadratic forms."

      "text" : "Consider a dataset with N real valued elements, which are defined on the vertices of an undirected graph G = (V, E), where the vertex set V = {v1, · · · , vN} denotes the set of nodes, and the edge set E reveals the connection between the nodes. We refer to such datasets as graph signals. We assume that the length of the graph signals (thus the number of nodes), i.e., N is known. However, the edge set is not known. Therefore, we assume a complete graph G(V, E)\nas a candidate graph in which each node is connected to every other node with the number of edges |E| = M = N(N−1)/2, and aim to determine a subgraph of G by choosing a subset of edges, Es, from the edge set E of this candidate graph.\nAny undirected graph topology is basically determined by its graph Laplacian matrix, which essentially reveals the connectivity of the graph. Let us denote the graph Laplacian matrix (i.e., a symmetric matrix) of the complete graph by L ∈ SN , where [L]i,j is nonzero, say equal to 1, only if i = j or (i, j) ∈ E . The symmetric matrixL can be expressed in terms of the so-called incidence matrix, A = [a1, · · · ,aM ] ∈ R N×M as\nL = AAT =\nM∑\nm=1\nama T m,\nwhere the m-th column of A, i.e., am denotes a length-N edge vector with entries [am]i = 1, [am]j = −1, and it has zeros elsewhere, for an edge m connecting nodes i with j (more generally, am is determined only up to a sign).\nLet us now denote the subgraph Gs(V, Es) with the edge set Es ⊂ E such that |Es| = K ≪ M . We will refer to such a subgraph with K edges as a K-sparse graph. We connect such a K-sparse graph Gs to L through a sparse edge selection vector w = [w1, w2, · · · , wM ]\nT ∈ {0, 1}M , where wm = 1 if an edge belongs to the edge subset Es, and wm = 0 otherwise. In terms of w, |Es| = K means ‖w‖0 = K. (The notation ‖w‖0 counts the number of non-zero entries in w.) Finally, we can write the Laplacian matrix of the K-sparse graph, Ls, as a function of w as\nLs(w) =\nM∑\nm=1\nwmama T m. (1)\nIn what follows, we will optimally design the edge sampling function w to recover the graph that sufficiently explains the data."

The smoothness and the spectral content of the signal both depend on the underlying graph topology.

(4)\nThe above Boolean linear programming problem admits an explicit solution and computing the optimal solution is straightforward. It is solved by sorting the entries of c in an ascending ordering. More specifically, the solution w will have entries equal to 1 at indices corresponding to the K smallest entries of c, and others are set to zero (ties may be broken arbitrarily). Computationally, the sorting algorithm costs O(K logK), and with a parallel implementation (e.g., on different processors), the computational complexity will be as low as O(K) [12, 13]. We give another interpretation of this result through the following remark.\nRemark 1. Let us suppose the graph signal is stochastic with covariance matrix Rx = E{xxT } ∈ RN×N . Then, the solution to (4) would select K edges between those nodes having the highest crosscorrelation, i.e., it will add an edge between the ith and the jth node if the variables xi and xj are strongly correlated. To see this, we express the cost function in (2) as\nL−1tr{XTLs(w)X} = tr { Ls(w)R̂x }\n= M∑\nm=1\nwm(am T R̂xam)\nwhere R̂x = 1LXX T ∈ RN×N is the sample data covariance matrix. Recalling the definition of am, it is easy to see that the term am\nT R̂xam = [R̂x]i,i + [R̂x]j,j − 2[R̂x]i,j is small if the ith and jth nodes are highly correlated and we have sufficient samples to compute the sample covariance matrix.\nBy modelling the graph topology through an edge selection vector, the graph learning problem can be solved optimally using a simple and elegant solution with a controlled sparsity level, whereas optimizing directly the graph Laplacian [4] or the adjacency matrix [5] leads to a more complicated suboptimal solution with no explicit handle to control the graph sparsity."

This formulation is different from [4], as [4] solves an optimization problem over the space of all possible graph Laplacians (instead of parameterizing the graph with w ∈ W) without sparsifying the graph. It can nevertheless be done through an extra ℓ1-norm penalty term.\nThe above problem (7) is noncovex due to the Boolean and cardinality constraints on w and the coupling between the optimization variables in the second term of (7).

That is, given w, the problem in (7) reduces to a linear system in the unknown X, which admits a closed form solution; while given {xk}Lk=1, it reduces to a Boolean linear programming problem, which admits an analytical solution with respect to w based on rank ordering. These observations suggest an iterative alternating minimization algorithm yielding successive estimates of {xk}Lk=1 with fixed w, and alternately of w with fixed {xk}Lk=1. Specifically, with the iterate of w given per iteration i ≥ 0, i.e., w[i], we solve for X[i] using a matrix inversion as\nX [i] = Xmin(w[i])\nwith\nXmin(w) = argmin X\n‖Y −X‖2F + γ tr{X T Ls(w)X}\n= [I + γLs(w)] −1 Y , (8)\nwhere Y = [y1,y2, · · · ,yL] is the data matrix of size N × L.

The iterations are initialized at i = 0 by randomly generating w[i+1] from a uniform distribution over W . The above alternating minimization method is computationally very attractive, and consists of two simple known solutions per iteration. However, the algorithm converges only to a stationary point of (7), and it suffers from the choice of the initial estimate.\nThe algorithm proposed in [4] is also along the lines of alternating minimization, except that the graph learning step involves a complicated optimization over the space of all possible valid Laplacian matrices."

      "text" : "We use temperature measurements collected across 32 weather stations in the French region of Brittany and the aim is to learn the graph that explains the observed data; see Fig. 1. There are 744 observations per weather station available, out of which we use L = 50 snapshots as the training set and the remaining ones as the evaluation set. One such observation (i.e., a graph signal) on a graph with N = 32 nodes is shown in Fig. 1, where the colored dots indicate different temperature readings. The convex optimization problems are solved using the CVX toolbox, which internally calls\nSDPT3 [14]. The candidate graph with N = 32 will have M = 496 edges, from which we aim to learn a subgraph with K = 110 edges.\nTo begin with, we consider the noiseless case, where the true graph signal is assumed to be known, and graph learning in this case amounts to solving a sorting problem. As shown in Fig. 1a, we can see that in the learnt graph with K = 110 edges, edges are present between nodes that share similar values. Although the proposed approach doesn’t always (e.g., for low values of K) ensure a well-connected graph, it clusters entities (or correlated nodes) with similar values. Fig. 2a shows that the cost (i.e., smoothness) of the proposed closed-form sorting solution, which is optimal, is lower than the existing iterative solution [5].\nNext, we consider the noisy setting with the same training data as before, where we perform joint graph learning and denoising. In Fig. 1b, we show the learnt graph with K = 110 edges based on the convex relaxation approach explained in Sec. 4.3. In Fig. 2b, we evaluate the denoising performance based on the learnt graph using the evaluation set. In particular, we show the mean squared error for different values of the noise level, where the mean squared error is computed from 1000 independent Monte Carlo experiments. The one-step solution based on convex optimization (cf. Sec. 4.3) leads to a lower error as compared to the alternating minimization approaches, which in general converge only to a stationary point. This also holds for our method developed in Sec. 4.2, however, we stress the fact that the proposed alternating minimization (cf. Sec. 4.2) is computationally much less expensive (involving two simple known solutions per iteration) as compared to the iterative solution in [4]. The graph learnt under the noiseless setting does not perform well for denoising. Nevertheless, due its simple solution, it can be used to generate a base graph, which can be further refined for specific graph inference problems."

Solving this basic problem is essential to carry out any graph signal processing or machine learning task. To realize this, we assume that the data is smooth with respect to the graph topology, and we parameterize the graph topology using an edge sampling function. That is, the graph Laplacian is expressed in terms of a sparse edge selection vector, which provides an explicit handle to control the sparsity level of the graph. We solve the sparse graph learning problem given some training data in both the noiseless and noisy settings. Given the true smooth data, the posed sparse graph learning problem can be solved optimally and is based on simple rank ordering. Given the noisy data, we show that the joint sparse graph learning and denoising problem can be simplified to designing only the sparse edge selection vector, which can be solved using convex optimization.",
