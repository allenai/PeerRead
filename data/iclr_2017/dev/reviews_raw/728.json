{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Spatio-Temporal Abstractions in Reinforcement Learning Through Neural Encoding", "abstract": "Recent progress in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled to tackle bigger and more challenging tasks. However, the increasing complexity of the problems, as well as the use of more sophisticated models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), impedes the understanding of artificial agents behavior. In this work, we present the Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP) model. The purpose of the SAMDP modeling is to describe and allow a better understanding of complex behaviors by identifying temporal and spatial abstractions. In contrast to other modeling approaches, SAMDP is built in a transformed state-space that encodes the dynamics of the problem. We show that working with the \\emph{right} state representation mitigates the problem of finding spatial and temporal abstractions. We describe the process of building the SAMDP model from observed trajectories and give examples for using it in a toy problem and complicated DQN policies. Finally, we show how using the SAMDP we can monitor the policy at hand and make it more robust.", "reviews": [{"TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 pcs", "comments": "The paper combines semi-Markov models with state aggregation models to define a Semi-Aggregated Markov Decision Process (SAMDP). As per the reviews, the need for spatio-temporal representations is recognized as an important problem. Where the work currently falls short is the loose description of framework, which should be formalized for clarity and analysis, and in terms of its contributions and benefits with respect to the broader literature on hierarchical RL methods.\n The anonymous reviewers (and the additional public review/comment) provide a number of clear directions to pursue for the next iteration of this work; indeed, there is strong general enthusiasm for the greater goals (as shared by the relevant body of work in the research community), but the work is seen as requiring further clarity in formalization and presentation.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"TITLE": "Comments and Suggestions", "OTHER_KEYS": "Aravind Lakshminarayanan", "comments": "This work is interesting and one of the few papers out there to address the problem of autonomous skill acquisition in Deep RL. The importance of this problem cannot be overstated since Hierarchical RL is not only about using a meta-controller to appropriately use a specific skill from a repertoire of previously learned subgoals, but also about devising a set of subgoals through experience. Subgoals are inherently tied to the topology of the underlying problem and hence clustering approaches make sense. \n\nI would like to point out that a very similar attempt has been done in one of the past works in this area - ", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "27 Jan 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Great goal, but the PAPER NEEDS MAJOR WORK", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper starts by pointing out the need for methods that perform both state and temporal representation learning for RL and which allow gaining insight into what is being learned (perhaps in order to allow a human operator to intervene if necessary). This is a very important goal from a practical point of view, and it is great to see research in this direction. For this reason, I would like to encourage the authors to pursue this further. However, I am not at all convinced that the current incarnation of this work is the right answer. Part of the issues are more related to presentation, part may require rethinking.\nIn order to get the \"interpretability\", the authors opt for some fairly specific ways of performing abstraction. For example, their skills always start In a single skill initiation state, and likewise end in one state. This seems unnecessarily restrictive, and it is not clear why this restriction is needed (other than convenience). Similarly, clustering is the basis for forming the higher level states, and there is a specific kind of clustering used here. Again, it is not clear why this has to be done via clustering as opposed to other methods. Ensuring temporal coherence in the particular form employed also seems restrictive. There is a reference to supplementary material where some of these choices are explained, but I could not find this in the posted version of the paper. The authors should either explain clearly why these specific choices are necessary, or (even better) try to think if they can be relaxed while still keeping interpretability. \nFrom a presentation point of view, the paper would benefit from formal definitions of AMDP and SAMDP, as well as from formal descriptions of the algorithms employed in constructing these representations (eg Bellman equations for the models, and update rules for the algorithms learning them). While intuitions are given, the math is not precisely stated. The overhead of constructing an SAMDP (computation time and space) should be clarified as well.\nThe experiments are well carried out and it is nice to have both gridworld experiments, where visualization are easy to perform and understand, as well as Atari games (gridworld still have their place despite what other reviewers might say). The results are positive, but because the proposed approach has many moving parts which rely on specific choices, significance and general ease of use are unclear at this point. Perhaps having the complete supplementary would have helped in this respect.\nSmall comment: The two lines after Eq 2 contain typos in the notation and a wrong sign in the equation.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "28 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 5}, {"TITLE": "No questions", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "comments": "", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "27 Dec 2016", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Variant of an SMDP model for skill learning ", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The framework of semi-Markov decision processes (SDMPs) has been long used to model skill learning and temporal abstraction in reinforcement learning.

The approach is quasi heuristic and explained through examples rather than clear definition. The work also lacks sufficient theoretical rigor. \n\nSimple experiments are proposed using 2D grid worlds to demonstrate skills. Grid worlds have served their purpose long enough in reinforcement learning, and it is time to retire them.

Paper", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper presents a method for visualization and analysis of policies from observed trajectories that the policies produce. The method infers higher level skills and clusters states. The result is a simplified, discrete higher-order state and action transition matrix. This model can be used for analysis, modeling, and interpretation. To construct semi-aggregated MDP the authors propose combining ideas for creating semi-MPDs and agregrated-MDPs. The method consists of choosing features, state clustering, skill inference, reward and skill length inference, and model selection. The method was demonstrated on a small grid-world problem, and DQN-trained agent for playing Atari games.\n\nThe authors correctly identify that tools and means for interpretibility of RL methods are important for analysis, and deployment of such methods for real-world applications. This is particularly true in robotics and high-consequence systems.\n\nThe end-result of the presented method is a high-level transition matrix. There is a big body of literature looking into hierarchical RL methods where lower level skills are combined with higher level policies. The presented method has the similar result, but the advantage of the presented method is that it comes up with a structure and analyzes already trained agent, which is very interesting. The paper would benefit from emphasizing this difference, and contrasting with the broader body of literature.\n\nTo build the model, the authors propose combining the ideas from two existing ideas, semi-MPDs and agregrated-MDPs with using modified k-means for state clustering. It appears that the novelty of the presented method is limited. The paper would have been stronger if the authors explicitly stated the contributions over combining existing methods, and better highlighted the practical utility of the method. \n\nThe evaluation section would be made stronger with more analytical results and precise evaluation, showing full strength of the method.\n\nThe paper is difficult to read. To improve readability:\n- The Semi-Aggregated MDP section should include more precise description of the methods. The narrative that builds intuition is welcome. In addition to the existing narrative, algorithms and formulas where applicable should be included as well. \n- The paper should be self-contained. For example, more background on Occams Razor principle should be included.\n- Reduce the number of acronyms, in particular similarly sounding acronyms. Define acronyms before using. \n- Be more clear on the contributions, contrast with relevant literature, and the specific benefits of the presented method.\n- Fix typos, formatting mistakes etc., as they can be distracting for reading. \n\nThe approach of reverse engineering the hierarchy, and learning high-level transition matrix is very interesting and promising. Perhaps the method can be used to outperform single network approach by using the model as an input to more specialized hierarchical trainers and learn complex behaviors more optimally then possible with one large network approach.
