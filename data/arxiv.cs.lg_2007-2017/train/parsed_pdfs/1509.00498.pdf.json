It also allows us to deal with missing metadata. One important aspect of normalization is to differentiate sensors by the type of phenomena being observed. In this paper, we propose a general, simple, yet effective classification scheme to differentiate sensors in buildings by type. We perform ensemble learning on data collected from over 2000 sensor streams in two buildings. Our approach is able to achieve more than 92% accuracy for classification within buildings and more than 82% accuracy for across buildings. We also introduce a method for identifying potential misclassified streams. This is important because it allows us to identify opportunities to attain more input from experts – input that could help improve classification accuracy when ground truth is unavailable. We show that by adjusting a threshold value we are able to identify at least 30% of the misclassified instances.\nCategories and Subject Descriptors C.3 [Special-Purpose And Application-Based Systems]: Real-time and embedded systems\nGeneral Terms Performance, Experimentation, Verification\nKeywords Sensor Type, Random Forest, Classification"

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Commercial buildings are sites of large sensor/meter deployments used to monitor and optimize their performance. With the recent interest in reducing building energy consumption and increasing their efficiency, it is important to consider ways to quickly bootstrap a set of building data streams into an analytical pipeline, such as overall building efficiency or comfort-assessment analytics and control. However, because sensor metadata is inconsistent across buildings, software-based solutions are tightly coupled to the sensor metadata conventions (i.e. schemas and naming) for each building. Running the same software across buildings requires significant integration effort.\nCurrent ‘point’ naming conventions and unsystematic recording of metadata form a bottleneck in deployment scalability for analytics jobs. A ‘point’ refers to a physical location where a sensor is taking measurements. Each building vendor uses their own naming scheme and unique variants of each scheme are implemented from building to building; variations exist even across buildings that have contracted the same vendor. In addition, expanded descriptive information about the point is sometimes unavailable – so determining their meaning is painfully slow or impossible. Because these are conventions carried out by humans, they are inconsistent within and across building data sets. This makes the integration process laborious for building experts and a non-starter for non experts. The process is fundamentally unscalable.\nConsider a simple analysis program, which has the ability to identify anomalous readings from a specific kind of sensor. To execute this job, the process organizes each sensor by type and location, generates the distribution of readings across them, and identifies broken sensors where some fraction of their readings are above some threshold value on the distribution. The identification step in the process is the most challenging because of the problems described. Ideally, the program would search for points the way you search for web pages in a search engine – using semantically meaningful terminology.\nPoint names contain set of codes that are semantically meaningful to the building manager of a specific building. For example, the point BLDA1R435__ART is constructed as a concatenation of such codes. The name of the building (first 4 characters), the air handling unit identifier (the fifth character), the room number (R435), and the type ART (area\nroom temperature) – which indicates that this are measurement is produced by a temperature sensor. In addition to point names, there may be some descriptive metadata. The description for this point (if it exists) could describe that this is a “temperature sensor in room 435”. However, since point names do not follow the exact same structure within and across buildings (and certainly do not follow the same convention across vendors) no single approach could solve the normalization problem. A suite of approaches is necessary.\nMetadata normalization is critical for scaling the software deployment process. It allows us to decouple building-specific conventions from the code written for building applications. Normalization allows us to boost existing metadata, correct incorrect metadata, or generate common metadata when it is missing altogether. One such component in the normalization suite should differentiate sensor feeds by type. For example, we should be able to differentiate between sensors measuring temperature from sensors measuring pressure. In addition, we should be able to use what we learn from one building and apply it to another. This is especially useful in cases where similar stream types are labeled differently, labeled incorrectly, or not labeled at all.\nNormalization would allow us to quickly run jobs across many sites by enabling wide searchability of points across many buildings at once. In order to meaningfully deal with disparate building streams in a scalable fashion the streams should be searchable across various properties, such as building name, room location, and type. Moreover, we assert that wide searchability is necessary for achieving scalability. By providing a tool for searching across building streams, we minimize the deployment time for applications; allowing them to be used in all buildings, not just a single one.\nOne of the important aspect of the sensor meta/data that we can leverage are the actual patterns in the readings themselves. Deep inspection of features in the data can yield meaningful results about the type of data that it is and can help us with the label normalization problem. This paper examines this path using standard machine learning approaches. We observe that statistical features over small time windows can be used to identify the stream type. Moreover, we show that the classification of stream-type can be achieved using an ensemble of classifiers which is known to outperform a single classifier.\nWe conduct a comprehensive study on the data collected from over 2000 sensors in two separate buildings on two campuses. Our main contributions are:\n• We propose a simple, general yet effective feature extraction scheme to achieve sensor type classification in the context of commercial buildings.\n• We formulate an approach to identifying potential misclassified sensor streams (in terms of the type classes) when no ground truth labels are available.\n• We evaluate our classification technique using data from over 2000 sensor series of 6 types in two buildings on two campuses, and our technique is able to achieve\naround 92% and 98% accuracy when doing classification within each building, and around 82% accuracy when inferring type information across buildings.\n• We also evaluate our solution to misclassification identification and the results demonstrate that we are able to identify at least 30% percent of the target population by choosing an optimal threshold for decision.\nWe believe this is an important study given the recent trends in the penetration of the internet of things into our homes and environments. Studies show that normalization is an especially pernicious and widely ubiquitous problem in embedded systems, with only 7% of data tagged and only 1% analyzed [15]. Our technique can be used to unify that data across many deployment and enable broad search and exploration of new applications. For example, sensing device names for the internet of things are likely to follow similar conventions with very little context. We argue that unification through boosting will be necessary in this broader domain."

      "text" : "Raw sensor time series1 usually contain millions of readings which are too general to be useful for type classification. We need to distill the information embedded in the reading patterns. A signal in the time domain trends the amplitude of a sensor reading and different types of sensor generally occupy distinct amplitude bins, as demonstrated in Figure 1. We can characterize the amplitude distribution of a signal in the time domain by using the percentiles of the value distribution.To identify outliers in the distribution, we pick the 50th percentile value (also known as the median) as a discriminator, which is more robust to outliers skew than the average.\nNaturally, sensor reading value-ranges may overlap. For example, during a rainy season, the humidity in an office can reach the range of 60-70 (percent) which is the same as typical temperature sensor readings (Fahrenheit). If you do not consider measurement units, the distributions for each of the two types look similar. Simply relying on percentiles is not sufficient for differentiating sensor types. Figure 2 demonstrates this point. To capture their difference we need to include the variance of the signal in our feature-vector.\nWhen we extract features from a raw sensor readings, the original trace can span hours, days, or weeks, and the trend can vary significantly, even from hour to hour. Extracting certain features, such as percentiles, and variances over\n1In this paper, we use the term“trace”, “readings” and“time series” interchangeably.\nthe entire sensor trace might miss short term dynamics thus missing discriminating characteristics. In contrast, computing features over short time windows can produce too much noise. Too many feature variables typically degrades classifier performance. To succinctly summarize the dynamics of sensor traces, we apply feature extraction to every time window of fixed length on the original trace and compute the statistics of the accumulated features from windowed slices as the final feature set.\nUpon close inspection of the traces, we notice that the shortterm dynamics of the phenomena being measured, could be used to differentiate them. Therefore, the distribution of short-term summary statistics can be used discriminate traces by type. We construct our feature vector as follows: first, each single sensor signal is segmented into N non-overlapping 45-minute long windows (we will discuss the decision of window length in later section). Second, within each time window, we compute the median and variance of the signal, producing a vector of medians and a vector of variances after the window slides over an entire trace:\nMED = {median1, median2, ..., medianN}\nV AR = {variance1, variance2, ..., varianceN}\nWhere N is the number of time windows. The vector MED and V AR reflect short term changes but not all the intermediate values are useful for classification. Finally, we compute\na statistical summary of the two vectors. For each vector we compute the minimum, maximum, median and variance, resulting in a feature vector with eight variables:\nF = {min(MED), max(MED),median(MED), var(MED),\nmin(V AR),max(V AR),median(V AR), var(V AR)}\nAnd F is the feature vector for each sensor trace used in our classification process."

      "heading" : "2.2 Classification",
      "text" : "In general, ensemble learning methods obtain better predictive performance than any of the constituent learning methods as discussed in [19, 22], if the following assumptions hold [8]: 1) the probability of a correct classification by each individual classifier is greater than 0.5 and 2) the errors in predictions of the base-level classifiers are independent. Random forests [4] have been widely used and outperform a single tree classifier. They are also faster [29] in training and testing compared to traditional classifiers such as SVM. The notion of randomized trees was first introduced in [2] and further well developed in [4].\nRandom forests construct a multiple of classification trees. To classify an unlabeled object, we construct the feature vector and “feed” the vector down each of the trees in the forest. Each tree gives a classification and we use it as a “vote” for that class. The forest chooses the class having the most votes over all the trees in the forest. The process proceeds as follows:\n1. Sample N instances at random with replacement2, from the original data set. These samples will be the training set for growing this particular tree.\n2. Specify M feature variables at random out of the total feature vector when growing each node of a tree. And the best split (measured by the information gain) on\n2An element may appear multiple times in the sample set.\nthese M is used to split the node. The value of M is constant during the forest growing.\n3. Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible without pruning.\nThe randomness of this ensemble learning method occurs in the first two steps. We set N equal the number of instances in the original training set, M equal the square root of the number of original feature variables, and the number of the trees in the forest be 50. Usually these parameters are optimized through cross-validation and we refer interested readers to [4] for further deduction and proof of random forest.\nAll the instances in our data set are labeled with ground truth class. To train a random forest, we split the original set into two subsets, one for building a forest and one for testing the accuracy of the classifier. After the forest is built from training set, we learn the posterior probabilities of each class c at each leaf node l for each tree t: suppose that T is the set of all trees, C is the set of all classes and L is the set of all leaves for a given tree t ∈ T . In the training stage the posterior probabilities Pt,l(Y (i) = c)) for each class c ∈ C at each leaf l ∈ L, are learned for each tree t ∈ T . These probabilities are calculated as the ratio of the number of instance i of class c that reach l to the total number of instances that reach l. Y (i) is the class label for instance i. To classify an instance in the testing stage, the feature vector of an instance is passed down each tree until reaching a leaf node, which gives a probability distribution. All the posterior probabilities accumulated from each tree are then averaged and the argmax is taken as the class of the instance. Note that instead of letting each tree vote for on class as described in the original paper [4], we combine the results from classifiers for an instance by averaging their probabilistic predictions, in order to facilitate our technique used to help identify potential misclassified instances as described in the following section."

      "text" : "Being able to measure the confidence of prediction results and to identify potential misclassifications, is vital to a learning process. It is trivial to identify misclassification when ground truth is available, but in many real-world cases ground truth is unavailable. Quantifying classification uncertainty can help identify potential misclassified instances and presents an opportunity to solicit the user for feedback that we can use to improve our results. To quantify the uncertainty of classifications in our learning process, we use the posterior probabilities learned in the random forest.\nWith the learned posterior probabilities for each class, at each leaf in each tree, we can compute the average probabilities for each class as follows:\nP̄ (Y (i) = c) =\n∑ t Pt,l(Y (i) = c)\n|T ′ | , t ∈ T\n′\nWhere T ′\nis the collection of trees in the forest where Pt,l(Y (i) = c) 6= 0, and | · | denotes the cardinality of a set. Given these averaged probabilities for each class, the forest produces a vector of class probabilities for each new instance as:\nPr = {P̄ (Y (i) = c)}, c ∈ C\nSuppose we have a probability vector Pr1 = {0.9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.1} for instance i1 and another vector Pr2 = {0.3, 0.25, 0.1, 0, 0.15, 0.2} for instance i2. Both i1 and i2 will be assigned to the same class according to the class probability distribution, but the assignment of i2 is less confident compared to that of i1 because its predicted class probability has a less“concentrated” distribution. To measure the degree of “uncertainty” in classification of one instance, we compute the entropy of its class probability yielded by the forest. We rank the classification results and filter out the instances for further manual inspection whose entropy are above a threshold. Inspection can help eliminate misclassifications."

In the intra-building case, the data from a single building is split into training and testing sets, where the results illustrate how accurately the type information can be inferred using local within-building information. For interbuilding case, the experiment performs training and testing across buildings, i.e, train the classifier on the data from building A and test it on building B. This set of experiments tests how well we can apply the classification boundaries from one building and apply it to another.\nFor identifying potential misclassifications, we choose the true-positive rate (TPR, also known as recall), false-positive rate (FPR, also known as fall-out) and positive predictive value (PPV, also known as precision) as metrics to evaluate the performance of our entropy-based approach when making different choice of threshold.

The accuracy for the baseline is also shown in the table (in parentheses). The only type we have difficulty differentiating is “other temp”, which includes temperature measurements for air and water in the ventilation system, and particularly, the return air temperature measurements (as illustrated in Figure 3) are almost identical to the ones measuring air temperature in rooms because what the return duct exhausts is mostly the air from a room.\n3.4.2 Inter Building Performance This set of experiments illustrates how accurately we can learn the type information of one building based on the knowledge from another building. The overall classification accuracy achieved for the two buildings by training on the entire data set (train on SDH for Rice and train on Rice for SDH) is around 82%, as seen from the last columns in Table 4 and 5. Particularly, we see that the accuracy for “other temperature” in Rice is abnormal compared to the rest of the results. The issue with classifying “other temperature” in Rice is that there are many sensing points measuring the temperature of supply and return cold/hot water utilized in the ventilation system, which are absent in the Berkeley building as a training set. Therefore the feature of these traces cannot be learned from SDH and causes problems in classifying these traces."

For the intra-building case, the classification is not sensitive to different window sizes as seen in the figure: basically, accuracy stays almost the same for both buildings because within the same building, as long as we can capture the short term characteristics\nof sensor dynamics in the windowed time slots, the size of the time window doesn’t make too much difference. However, for the inter-building case, the time window size matters in the way that usually the local micro-climate in one building can be quite different from another, we need to “tune” this common short term window to capture the dynamics that can be used to learn type-related information across buildings. Therefore, in order to achieve decent type classification accuracy across buildings, (i.e, use information from one building to help classify the traces in another building), we still need to optimize the size of time window, which is 45 minutes in our case. This “tuning” is significant for the learning process across buildings and is straightforward to perform."

      "heading" : "3.7 Identifying Potential Misclassifications",
      "text" : "As we discussed in early section, being able to quantify the confidence in classifications and identify misclassified instances in our sensor type classification is vital to improving the overall accuracy considering that in many cases our technique is used there will be the absence of ground truth. As an intermediate step to identify potentially misclassified instances, we propose to quantify the “uncertainty” of classification with an entropy-based approach described in Section 3.3. Figure 5 shows the CDF of class probability entropy of classification in the intra- and inter- building scenarios. We see that the collection of correct classifications (in solid lines) has a distinct distribution from the collection of misclassification (in dotted lines). Based on such distinction in the distribution, we can choose a certain entropy value as a threshold and filter out all the classified instances whose class probability entropy are greater than the threshold outputted by the forest. Figure 6 gives a summary of the performance of our entropy-based approach to identifying potential misclassification. Here are some definitions needed to understand the statistics:\nS1: the set of instance whose class probability entropy is greater than the threshold.\nS2: the set of instance falling in S1 that is misclassified in the classification process.\nS3: the set of instance falling in S1 that is correctly classified in the classification process.\nS4: the set of instance that is misclassified in the classification process.\nS5: the set of instance that is correctly classified in the classification process.\nAnd the TPR, FPR and PPV are defined as:\nTPR = |S2|\n|S4| , FPR =\n|S3| |S5| , PPV = |S2| |S1| ,\nWhere | · | is the cardinality of a set. We see that as the threshold value increases, both of the TPR (recall) and FPR (fall-out) decrease while the PPV (precision) keeps increasing.\nIn our case, a smaller threshold essentially leads to a larger population of instances being filtered out as potential misclassification “candidates”, which helps identify more real misclassified instances. However, the more candidates we filter our, the more instances we need to manually inspect, which inevitably leads to a lower precision of the identification process. So we want to strike a balance between achieving a high recall rate as well as maintaining a high precision. As a result, based on the observation from Figure 6, we suggest picking a threshold value somewhere between 0.4 and 0.45 is appropriate. To note, we have 50 and 13 misclassified instances for Rice and SDH respectively for the intra-building testing case. In the intra-building case, such a threshold (0.4-0.45) helps identify ∼30% of the misclassified instances for Rice and ∼50% for SDH while resulting in that ∼70% and ∼50% of the instances being manual inspected are actually correct classifications, for Rice and SDH respectively. As for the inter-building case, our approach is able to identify ∼75% of the misclassified instances for both Rice and SDH with an overhead of ∼40% and ∼70% in the candidate inspection, for Rice and SDH respectively."

We describe the closest, related work in different problem domains and describe work that uses the random forest as a tool.\nThere has been much research work on type classification in the context of audio [14, 18], music [10, 16], video [7, 17], web query [11, 9] and human activity [21, 27]. The goal of [14] is to classify audios into categories such as speech, music, background sound and silence using support vector machines, and the work in [18] addresses the same problem with a HMM-based statistical model. Examples of music genre (i.e, jazz, pop and so forth) classification are [10, 16], which use GMM with EM algorithm and logistic regression respectively. And commonly used features for these audio-related classification work are MFCC, zero crossing rate, energy/power and spectral/temporal statistics. For video type classification, texture and color-based features are used to classify videos into classes including cartoon, commercial, news and so on with decision tree [7] and neural network [17]. Query categorization has also been researched, [11] exploits a rule-based classifier while [9] uses a Markov random walk model. There is also work on human activity classification in general cases [21] (i.e, running, walking and sitting) and home setting [27] (i.e, sleeping, toiletting and showering) using accelerometer data with voting-based classifier and HMM with conditional random fields respectively. In contrast, our work is focused on sensor type classification using ensemble learning technique.\nRandom forests have been applied in many different areas [6, 26, 13, 20]. [6] uses a gene as a feature to classify microarray data. [26] uses the intensity of hundreds of measured metabolites from medical subjects as features, to classify the subjects into groups of normal, diseased and diseased with drug treatment. Random forests have also been used in [13] to classify objects in images with image-relevant features. In the area of remote sensing, [20] utilizes user-defined parameters as features to classify land cover types. In our work, we use simple and general statistical feature-set for type classification.\nThere is work leveraging percentile-based features in time series data for different classification purposes. Tarzia [24] et. al use a certain percentile in the audio spectrum to classify the current room location. Wang [28] et. al utilize percentile-based features in audio to characterize occupancy and noise levels. For comparison, we use percentile statistics\nin sensor time series as part of our feature-set to differentiate between different sensor types in commercial buildings."

      "heading" : "6. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We describe a general, simple yet effective feature extraction design in support of sensor type classification with time series data. By experimenting with over 2000 streams from two buildings on two campuses, our technique, which leverages an ensemble learning method, is able to achieve an accuracy more than 92% and 82% for testing within building and across buildings, respectively. We also discuss that how to choose the window size applied to a slice of the original time series and how the number of training instances affects classification accuracy. In general, around 100 instances are enough to bootstrap the learning process in the case of 6 types of sensors. Another important contribution of our paper is a probability-based solution for identifying potentially misclassified instances. With the use of probabilities produced by the random forest, in both of the intraand inter- building learning cases, we are able to identify at least 30% of the misclassifications.\nOur technique can act as a tool for metadata construction for building sensors. For cases where type information of sensors is missing, our technique can help infer and generate the type metadata. In cases where metadata is available in an inconsistent manner within/across buildings, our solution can be used to verify type information and unify the naming schema across platforms in different buildings. Questions remain about how broadly we can expand our taxonomy and further study the scalability of our technique."

    "abstractText" : "Many sensors/meters are deployed in commercial buildings to monitor and optimize their performance. However, because sensor metadata is inconsistent across buildings, softwarebased solutions are tightly coupled to the sensor metadata conventions (i.e. schemas and naming) for each building. Running the same software across buildings requires significant integration effort. Metadata normalization is critical for scaling the deployment process and allows us to decouple building-specific conventions from the code written for building applications. It also allows us to deal with missing metadata. One important aspect of normalization is to differentiate sensors by the type of phenomena being observed. In this paper, we propose a general, simple, yet effective classification scheme to differentiate sensors in buildings by type. We perform ensemble learning on data collected from over 2000 sensor streams in two buildings. Our approach is able to achieve more than 92% accuracy for classification within buildings and more than 82% accuracy for across buildings. We also introduce a method for identifying potential misclassified streams. This is important because it allows us to identify opportunities to attain more input from experts – input that could help improve classification accuracy when ground truth is unavailable. We show that by adjusting a threshold value we are able to identify at least 30% of the misclassified instances.",
