      "text" : "Semantic textual similarity (STS) measures the degree of equivalence between the meanings of two text sequences (Agirre et al., 2016). The similarity of the text pair can be represented as discrete or continuous values ranging from irrelevance (1) to exact semantic equivalence (5). It is widely applicable to many NLP tasks including summarization (Wong et al., 2008; Nenkova et al., 2011), generation and question answering (Vo et al., 2015), paraphrase detection (Fernando and Stevenson, 2008), and machine translation (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005).\nIn this paper, we describe a system that is able to learn context-sensitive features within the sentences. Further, we encode the sequential information with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and perform attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) on RNN outputs for both sentences. Attention mechanism was performed to increase sensitivity of the system to words of similarity significance. We also optimize directly on the Pearson correlation score as part of our neural-based approach. Moreover, we include a pair feature\n∗The author is currently serving in his Alternative Military Service of Education.\nadapter module that could be used to include more features to further improve performance. However, for this competition we include merely the TakeLab features (Šarić et al., 2012). 1"

      "text" : "Most proposed approaches in the past adopted a hybrid of varying text unit sizes ranging from character-based, token-based, to knowledge-based similarity measure (Gomaa and Fahmy, 2013). The linguistic depths of these measures often vary between lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels.\nMost solutions include an ensemble of modules that employs features coming from different unit sizes and depths. More recent approaches generally include the word embedding-based similarity (Liebeck et al., 2016; Brychcı́n and Svoboda, 2016) as a component of the final ensemble. Top performing team in 2016 (Rychalska et al., 2016) uses an ensemble of multiple modules including recursive autoencoders with WordNet and monolingual aligner (Sultan et al., 2016). UMD-TTICUW (He et al., 2016) proposes the MPCNN model that requires no feature engineering and managed to perform competitively at 6th place. MPCNN is able to extract the hidden information using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and added an attention layer to extract the vital similarity information."

We use both PathLen similarity (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998) and Lin similarity (Lin et al., 1998) to compute similarity between pairs of words w1i and w 2 j in I1 and I2, re-\nspectively. We employed the suggested preprocessing step (Šarić et al., 2012), and added both WordNet and corpus-based information\n2 We also explored Longer Short-Term Memory (LSTM), but find it more overfitting than GRU.\nto ngram overlap scores, which was obtained with the harmonic mean of the degree of overlap between the sentences.\n•Semantic Sentence Similarity: We also computed token-based alignment overlap and vector space sentence similarity (Šarić et al., 2012). Semantic alignment similarity was computed greedily between all pairs of tokens using both the knowledge-based and corpus-based similarity. Scores are further enhanced with the aligned pair information. We obtained the weighted form of latent semantic analysis vectors (Turney and Pantel, 2010) for each word w, before computing the cosine similarity. As such, sentence similarity scores are enhanced with corpus-based information for tokens. The features are concatenated into a vector, denoted as m.\nScoring Let S be a descret random variable over {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} describing the similarity of the given sentence pair {I1, I2}. The representation of the given pair is the concatenation of u1, u2, and m, which is fed into an MLP with one hidden layer to calculate the estimated distribution of S.\np =  P (S = 0) P (S = 1)\n... P (S = 5)\n = softmax(V tanh(U  u1u2 m )) (3)\nTherefore, the score y is the expected value of S:\ny = E[S] = 5∑\ni=0\niP (S = i) = vT p (4)\n, where v = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]T .

      "text" : "Let pn, yn be the predicted probability density and expected score and ŷn be the annotated gold score of the n-th sample. Most of the previous learningbased models are trained to minimize the following objectives on a batch of N samples:\n• Negative Log-likelihood (NLL) of p and p̂ (Aker et al., 2016). The task is viewed as a classification problem for 6 classes.\nLNLL = N∑ n=1 − log pntn\n, where tn is ŷn rounded to the nearest integer.\n• Mean square error (MSE) between yn and ŷn (Brychcı́n and Svoboda, 2016).\nLMSE = 1\nN N∑ n=1 (yn − ŷn)2\n• Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) of pn and gold distribution p̂n estimated by ŷn:\nLKLD = N∑ n=1\n( 6∑\ni=1\np̂ni log p̂ni pni\n)\nwhere\np̂ni =  ŷn − bŷnc, if i = bŷnc+ 1 bŷnc+ 1− ŷn, if i = bŷnc 0, otherwise\n(Li and Huang, 2016; Tai et al., 2015). For each n, there exists some k such that p̂nk = 1 and ∀h 6= k, p̂nh = 0, KLD is identical to NLL.\nHowever, the evaluation metric of this task is Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), which is invariant to changes in location and scale of yn but none of the above objectives can reflect it. Here we use an example to illustrate that MSE and KLD can even report an inverse tendency. In Table 1,\ngroup A has lower MSE and KLD loss than group B, but its PCC is also lower.\nTo solve this problem, we train the model to maximize PCC directly. Hence, the loss function is given by:\nLPCC = − ∑N\nn=1(y n − ȳ)(ŷn − ¯̂y)√∑N\nn=1(y n − ȳ)2 √∑N n=1(ŷ\nn − ¯̂y)2 (5)\nwhere ȳ = 1N ∑N n=1 y n and ¯̂y = 1N ∑N n=1 ŷ\nn. Since N is fixed for every batch, LPCC is differentiable with respect to yn, which means we can apply back propagation to train the network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first team to adopt this training objective."
