      "text" : "Decision makers need to understand and evaluate complex decision problems with considerable uncertainties. Those uncertainties are integrated into decision models as forecasts in the form of probability distributions, and the analysis is often quite sensitive to the distributions used. Statistical analysis can support this process when there is sufficient relevant historical data. However, in many cases, decision makers must rely instead on the judgment of experts to obtain useful probabilistic forecasts.\nIn many applications of decision analysis, multiple individual judgments are engaged. Even when the decision maker has her own belief about the uncertainties, she can benefit by integrating the judgments of others. Incorporating diverse views from heterogeneous disciplines has been shown to improve assement accuracy (Clemen 1989, Hoffmann et al. 2007). Several approaches have been developed in the literature to find\noptimal combinations of multiple individuals’ judgements (Clemen and Winkler 1999, Stone 1961, Morris 1977).\nA strictly proper scoring rule measures the quality of a probabilistic forecast based on the observed outcome (Winkler 1996). It can be used, ex post, to evaluate the quality of forecasters (Brier 1950), or, ex ante, to encourage forecasters to articulate their best possible report (Savage 1971). In either case, a scoring rule captures the accuracy, calibration, knowledge, and expertise in assessment, encouraging a forecaster to be careful and honest.\nA decision maker who needs more knowledge about a particular uncertainty can retain a panel of experts. Each expert reports his forecast to her, and his payment can depend on the observed state, his report, and the other reports, too. Although her contract with the experts can provide a risk-free subsidy, it can also have incentives for superior forecasts (Clemen 2002).\nIn recent years, prediction markets have been created and several market designs have been developed (Pennock 2004, Peters et al. 2006, Agrawal et al. 2009). Prediction markets can elicit forecasts by aggregating the reports from many anonymous players integrating their combined information (Berg and Rietz 2003). Some prominent prediction markets are Iowa Electronic Markets, which focuses on political election, Hollywood Stock Exchange, which focuses on movies, NewsFutures.com, which covers politics, finance, sports and current international events. It has been shown that forecasts from public prediction markets strongly correlate with observed outcomes (Pennock et al. 2001, Servan-Schreiber et al. 2004).\nThe most popular type of contract in prediction markets is winner-take-all, where a player is paid if and only if a specific event occurs (Wolfers and Zitzewitz 2004). A winner-take-all market does not induce truthful individual reports. Depending on the assumptions made, the equilibrium price of a prediction market is\neither a particular quantile of the budget-weighted distribution of players’ beliefs (Manski 2006) or the mean of those beliefs (Wolfers and Zitzewitz 2005).\nStrictly proper scoring rules have also been applied to groups of forecasters, where the payment depends on the forecaster’s score relative to others. Hanson (2003) introduced market scoring rules where the market subsidizes the process. Kilgour and Gerchak (2004) developed competitive scoring rules which are self-financing regardless of the number of players, their forecasts, or the outcome. Johnstone (2007) elaborated the relationship between the Kilgour-Gerchak logarithmic scoring rules and the rewards from Kelly betting competition. Lambert et al. (2008) proposed weightedscore mechanisms, a modified form of Kilgour-Gerchak competitive scoring rules, which ensure budget balance and non-negative payments.\nIn this paper we explore payments for probabilistic forecasts, either from a panel of experts or in a prediction market. We consider strictly proper mechanisms, both traditional and competitive scoring rules, which have been shown to encourage forecasters to report their true beliefs when acting independently. We show that when forecasters with different beliefs are able to cooperate and form a coalition, these mechanisms admit arbitrage. A similar result for concave traditional scoring rules was suggested by French (1985). These mechanisms actually discourage the coalition members from reporting their true beliefs because they are guaranteed to receive more when they coordinate their reports. If the coalition were created by an intermediary, such as a web portal, without the knowledge of the players, the intermediary would be guaranteed a profit.\nIt should not be surprising that mechanisms that encourage individuals acting alone to report honestly, do otherwise when players can cooperate. This is similar to results with auctions. Although second-price auctions are incentive-compatible for individuals, cooperation among bidders is a dominant strategy that affects the reserve price for the auction (Graham and Marshall 1987). Auctions with intermediaries are similary influenced by cooperative behavior (Feldman et al. 2010). Such cooperation is difficult to detect and ambiguous to prove (McAfee and McMillan 1992).\nIn section 2 of this paper, we present the fundamental notation and earlier results for traditional and competitive scoring rules. We build on them to show how strictly proper mechanisms admit arbitrage under cooperation for traditional and competitive scoring rules, in sections 3 and 4, respectively. Finally, we conclude and present some future research in section 5."

      "text" : "A decision maker is concerned about a random variable E with m mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive states given by Ω = {E1, E2, ..., Em}. There are n forecasters or players, indexed by N = {1, 2, ..., n}, who report probabilistic forecasts for E. The players are assumed to be risk neutral and their forecasts are in the simplex, denoted by ∆m =  r ∈ R m : m\nj=1\nrj = 1, rj ≥ 0\n  . We assume that each\nplayer i ∈ N believes that the event will occur according with probability pi = (pi1, ..., pim) ∈ ∆m but reports ri ∈ ∆m to the decision maker, where ri is not necessarily equal to pi. We say that the players in C ⊆ N agree if p1 = pi for all i ∈ C, and that otherwise they disagree. The decision maker pays the players according to a contract function, denoted by Π : (∆m)n × Ω → Rn based on the reports of all players and the observed state, so player i receives Πi(r1, ..., rn, Ej).\nA traditional scoring rule, S : ∆m × Ω → R, assigns a real-valued score based solely on the player’s report and the observed state. If the decision maker pays player i\nΠi(r1, ..., rn, Ej) = wiS (ri, Ej),\nwhen Ej ∈ Ω is observed, where weight wi > 0, Π is said to be a contract function for scoring rule S. A scoring rule S is said to be strictly proper for player i if\nm\nj=1\npijS (pi, Ej) > m\nj=1\npijS (ri, Ej)\nwhenever pi = ri, for all pi, ri ∈ ∆m. The contract function Π is strictly proper if m\nj=1\npijΠi(r1, ...,pi, ..., rn, Ej) > m\nj=1\npijΠi(r1, ..., rn, Ej)\nwhenever pi = ri, for all i and all pi, r1, ..., rn ∈ ∆m. Thus, under a a strictly proper mechanism, a risk neutral player should report his true belief in order to maximize his expected score. Savage (1971) showed that scoring rule S is strictly proper if and only if\nS (ri, Ej) = G(ri)−∇G(ri)ri +∇jG(ri) (1)\nfor j = 1, ...,m, where G : ∆m → R is a continuously differentiable strictly convex function.\nThe three strictly proper scoring rules most commonly used in the literature are the quadratic (or Brier), logarithmic, and spherical rules: (Winkler 1996, Jose 2008):\nQuadratic: S (ri, Ej) = aj + b(2rij − ri2),\nLogarithmic: S (ri, Ej) = aj + b log rij , and\nSpherical: S (ri, Ej) = aj + brij ri ,\nfor any aj and any b > 0, where ri =  r2ij 1/2, the 2-norm of the vector ri.\nOf the three most common scoring rules, the quadratic and spherical are bounded, but the logarithmic has no lower bound, which makes it less attractive as a contract payment. Therefore we propose a new strictly proper scoring rule, a generalized logarithmic score given by\nGeneralized Logarithmic:\nS (ri, Ej) = aj + b log(rij + l) + bl m\nk=1\nlog(rik + l),\n(2)\nwhich is equal to the logarithmic score when l = 0 and bounded when l > 0 for any aj and any b > 0.\nKilgour and Gerchak (2004) construct a self-financing competitive scoring rule, where the total of the contract functions for all players is zero. Their contract function assigns a score based on the relative quality of each forecast compared to the other forecasts. If Ej ∈ Ω is observed, player i receives Πi(r1, ..., rn, Ej) determined by\nΠi(r1, ..., rn, Ej) = S (ri, Ej)− 1 n\n k∈N S (rk, Ej) (3)\nLambert et al. (2008) propose a similar weighted-score mechanism, denoted by\nΠi(r1, ..., rn, Ej) = wiS (ri, Ej)− wi wN\n k∈N wkS (rk, Ej)\n(4) where weight wi > 0 can now be interpreted as the wager chosen by player i and wC =  k∈C wk for any C ⊆ N . They require that scoring rule S be bounded, mapping into [0, 1], to ensure that player i never loses more than his wager wi. If a scoring rule S is strictly proper, then so are the corresponding Kilgour-Gerchak rule and weighted-score mechanisms (Kilgour and Gerchak, 2004; Lambert et al. 2008).\nHanson’s market scoring rule (2003) is also strictly proper. Player i reports his forecast and is paid based on that report and the report from the player who preceded him, i − 1, according to the following contract rule:\nΠi(r1, ..., rn, Ej) = S (ri, Ej)− S (ri−1, Ej). (5)\nAlthough these mechanisms are all strictly proper in the sense that each player, acting independently, should report his true beliefs in order to maximize his expected score, we will show that is not the case when he can cooperate with other players."

Suppose that two or more players form a coalition, C ⊆ N of size c = |C| ≥ 2. We show that in a variety of circumstances, even under a strictly proper mechanism, coalition members who disagree about the forecasts will all be better off coordinating their reports than reporting truthfully.\nWe say that contract Π admits arbitrage for coalition C if, for any pi ∈ ∆m for all i ∈ C where the players in C disagree, there are ri ∈ ∆m for all i ∈ C such that\n i∈C Πi(p1, ...,pn, Ej) <  i∈C Πi(r1, ..., rn, Ej)\nfor all j and all pk = rk ∈ ∆m for all k /∈ C.

A traditional strictly proper score S for a binary event can be generally represented by\nS (ri, E1) = G(ri) + (1− ri)G(ri), S (ri, E2) = G(ri)− riG(ri),\nwhere ri is the reported probability report for E1 and G is a continuously differentiable strictly convex function (Savage 1971). Theorem 1 (Arbitrage with Binary E). Given binary E, any contract function for a strictly proper scoring\nrule admits arbitrage with identical reports. Whenever coalition members maximizing their payments disagree about E they should not report their true beliefs.\nProof. We will show that the contract function Πi(r1, ..., rn, Ej) = S(ri, Ej) admits arbitrage with identical reports q for any coalition C with c ≥ 2, where q satisfies\nG(q) = \ni∈C\nwi wC G(pi).

Therefore, by the intermediate-value-theorem there exists a unique such q, mini∈C pi < q < maxi∈C pi.\nGiven such a q, there is the same surplus from cooperation no matter which state of E is observed, and because G is strictly convex, the surplus is strictly positive when the coalition members disagree, \ni∈C wiS (q, E1)\n= \ni∈C wi (G(q) + (1− q)G(q))\n= \ni∈C wi (G(q) + (1− q)G(pi))\n> \ni∈C wi (G(pi) + (q − pi)G(pi) + (1− q)G(pi))\n= \ni∈C wi (G(pi) + (1− pi)G(pi))\n= \ni∈C wiS (pi, E1),\nand \ni∈C wiS (q, E2)−\n i∈C wiS (pi, E2)\n= \ni∈C wi (G(q)− qG(q)) − \ni∈C wi (G(pi)− piG(pi))\n= \ni∈C wiS (q, E1)−\n i∈C wiS (pi, E1) > 0."

      "heading" : "3.3 Examples of Traditonal Strictly Proper Scoring Rules",
      "text" : "The three most commonly used strictly proper scoring rules are the quadratic, logarithmic and spherical rules. The contract function for these scoring rules admits arbitrage with identical reports for any coalitions. Under all three, when players are able to cooperate they can be discouraged from reporting their true beliefs. The results of this section are summarized in Table 1. Example 1 (Quadratic Scoring Rule). The quadratic scoring rule for event E is S (ri, Ej) = aj + b(2rij − ri2). It is strictly concave with respect to ri, so it admits arbitrage with identical reports\nq = \ni∈C\nwi wC pi ∈ ∆m.\nIn this case, the surplus from cooperation is the same for all outcome states Ej ,\n i∈C wiS (q, Ej)−  i∈C wiS (pi, Ej)\n= b  i∈C wi  pi 2 − q2  = b \ni∈C wi pi − q\n2 .\nThis surplus comes from the total variation among the coalition members’ probabilities, a second moment analogous to variance. It is positive unless they agree on E and it increases when there is more disagreement among the coalition members. For example, if\nthere were two members who disagreed about a binary event, believing probabilities 0.2 and 0.8 for E1, their surplus from cooperating and reporting 0.5 instead of their true beliefs would be nine times the surplus they would receive if they had believed 0.4 and 0.6 and reported 0.5. Their disagreement is three times larger and the surplus is therefore 32 larger. Example 2 (Generalized Logarithmic Scoring Rule). The generalized logarithmic scoring rule for event E is S (ri, Ej) = aj + b log(rij + l) + bl m k=1 log(rik + l), where l = 0 corresponds to the traditional logarithmic scoring rule. Because it is concave, by Theorem 2 it admits arbitrage with identical reports, equal to the weighted arithmetic mean of the coalition members’ forecasts, for any coalition. However, it is more instructive to consider identical reports equal to the normalized weighted geometric mean,\nqj = (1 + ml)\n i∈C (pij + l) wi/wC\nm k=1  i∈C (pik + l) wi/wC − l. (7)\nWith this q the surplus from cooperation is\nbwC (1 + ml) log  1 + mlm\nj=1  i∈C (pij + l)wi/wC\n (8)\nregardless of the observed outcome, and is strictly positive whenever they disagree. By Jensen’s inequality,  i∈C (pij + l) wi/wC < \ni∈C wi wC (pij + l), un-\nless pij are the same for all i ∈ C. Summing up each component, m j=1(  i∈C (pij + l))\nwi/wC < m\nj=1  i∈C wi wC (pij + l) = 1 + ml, thus the equation (8) is strictly positive. Example 3 (Spherical Scoring Rule). The spherical scoring rule for event E, S (ri, Ej) = aj + brij/ri, also admits arbitrage with identical reports for any coalition. However, a spherical score is not a concave function, and the arithmetic mean does not always lead to arbitrage. For example, if there were two members who disagreed about a binary event, believing probabilities 0.1 and 0.4 for E1, although they would always be better off both reporting 0.275 than reporting their true beliefs, they are not always better off reporting the arithmetic mean 0.25. Theorem 3 (Arbitrage with Spherical Scoring Rule). Any contract function for a spherical scoring rule admits arbitrage with identical reports. Whenever coalition members maximizing their payments disagree about E they should not report their true beliefs.\nThe proof is given in the Appendix. It shows that there is an identical report q ∈ ∆m with components\nqj = 1 m + Yj − Y\nm(1− m k=1(Yk − Y )2) (9)\nwhere Yj = \ni∈C\nwipij wC pi and Y = 1 m\nm\nj=1\nYj .\nThe surplus from cooperation is\nbwC\n\n\n 1− m j=1(Yj − Y )2\nm − Y\n\n (10)\nregardless of the observed outcome, and is strictly positive whenever they disagree."

This mechanism is self-financing, with contract functions summing to zero in all outcome states. It generalizes both the KilgourGerchak and Lambert mechanisms for the purposes of this paper. If all of the wagers are equal, wi = w1 for all i ∈ N , this is the Kilgour-Gerchak competitive scoring rule. If the range of the scoring rule is restricted to [0, 1], then it is the Lambert weighted-score mechanism, and each player i never loses more than his wager, Πi > −wi. Theorem 4 (Arbitrage with Self-Financed Competitive Mechanism). Given that the contract function for a strictly proper scoring rule admits arbitrage, any selffinanced competitive mechanism using the same scoring rule admits arbitrage for any coalition including at least two but not all of the players. Whenever coalition members maximizing their payments disagree about E they should not report their true beliefs.\nProof. Suppose that the contract function admits arbitrage for coalition C with each player i ∈ C believing pi and reporting ri, while each player k /∈ C reports rk\nand we will let pk = rk. The surplus from cooperation when Ej is observed is \ni∈C Πi(r1, ..., rn, Ej)−\n i∈C Πi(p1, ...,pn, Ej)\n= \ni∈C wiS (ri, Ej)− wC wN\n k∈C wkS (rk, Ej)\n− \ni∈C wiS (pi, Ej) + wC wN\n k∈C wkS (pk, Ej)\n= \n1− wC wN\n\ni∈C wi [S (ri, Ej)− S (pi, Ej)] .\nThus the competitive mechanism admits arbitrage for the coalition provided wC < wN .\nWe have shown that there is surplus from cooperation for both the Kilgour-Gerchak competitive scoring rule and the Lambert weighted-score mechanism. In prediction markets, it would be difficult to prevent players from cooperating, and they could in fact do so without even knowing it. An intermediary, such as a web portal, can create a coalition among players, and exploit the surplus from cooperation that comes from bringing together forecasters who disagree. Such an intermediary can provide a convenient service for players who want to enter their forecasts into the prediction market, reimbursing them as if their forecasts were actually entered into the market. However, if the intermediary instead submits identical reports for each of them, or one large wager with that report, he would be guaranteed a profit if any of the players disagree, even if he\nhad no knowledge about the uncertainty. The players might be unaware they had participated in a coalition.\nNext we consider how large a coalition should be to maximize the expected surplus.\nTheorem 5 (Optimal Coalition Size). Given that a large number of players n are participating with equal wagers, their forecasts are believed to be exchangeable, and the contract admits arbitrage with identical reports, the ideal size for a coalition C in order to maximize the expected surplus from cooperation includes all players under a contract for a strictly proper scoring rule, and half of the wagers, wC = 12wN , under a self-financed competitive mechanism.\nProof. For a large enough population, the identical report for members of the coalition q would not depend on the size of the coalition. Therefore, the expected surplus from cooperation under a contract for a scoring rule when Ej is observed is\n i∈C wi\n S(q, Ej)− \npi∈∆m S(pi, Ej)dF (pi)\n\n= wC  S(q, Ej)− \np∈∆m S(p, Ej)dF (p)\n ,\nwhich is proportional to wC and it is maximized by including all players. If players are paid by a self financed competitive mechnism, the expected surplus from co-\noperation when Ej is observed is\n 1− wC\nwN\n\ni∈C wi\n S(q, Ej)− \npi\nS(pi, Ej)dF (pi)\n\n= \n1− wC wN\n wC  S(q, Ej)− \np S(p, Ej)dF (p)\n .\nThis is proportional to wC (wN − wC). Therefore, it is maximized when wC = 12wN .\nIn a contract for a scoring rule, the surplus from cooperation is proportional to the size of the coalition, and the surplus is largest with all players cooperating. However, under a competitive mechanism the surplus comes from the players outside the coalition and from the variation among the players within it, and therefore the surplus is largest when half of the wagers are from members, wC = 12wN . Note that if our objective were to maximize the surplus per member, i.e. the total surplus from cooperation divided by the size of the coalition, we would prefer a smaller coalition."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusions",
      "text" : "We have shown that many of the strictly proper mechanisms that have been shown to encourage forecasters to report their true beliefs fail to do so when the forecasters are able to cooperate. When players form a coalition they always receive more by coordinating their reports because the mechanisms admit arbitrage. We have shown this happens with contracts for traditional strictly proper scoring rules, including the quadratic, logarithmic, and spherical scoring rules. We have also shown this arbitrage for competitive mechanisms based on strictly proper scoring rules, such as those proposed by Hanson (2003), Kilgour and Gerchak (2004) and Lambert et al. (2008).\nWe had been hoping to use these results to develop a mechanism resistant to cooperation. It is still an open question whether there is any strictly proper mechanism that does not admit arbitrage, but it seems unlikely. In prediction markets, it would be difficult to prevent players from cooperating, or to prevent an intermediary, such as a web portal, from exploiting the surplus from cooperation that comes from bringing together forecasters who disagree. Such an intermediary would be guaranteed a profit even if she had no knowledge about the uncertainty.\nFor a decision maker subsidizing a prediction market to observe players’ true forecasts, these results raise questions. They suggest that coalitions obtain their surplus from cooperation by reducing the variation among the reports from members, falsely appearing to reach consensus. Thus, decision makers would lose valuable information about the diversity of opinion among forecasters, and might lose the benefit of their heterogeneous information sources.\nAnother issue with cooperation is that the surplus from cooperation can increase the cost to the decision maker for the contract for traditional scoring rules while distorting the information she obtains. Although there is no increase in the cost for self-financing competitive mechanisms, in that case the surplus comes from the players who are not cooperating, reducing their incentive to participate.\nIn situations where a decision maker can identify a particular forecaster in order to weight his report based on his reputation or other characteristics, his report can be misleading when he is acting as a coalition member rather than stating his true beliefs. One significant\nexception, when the information is not distorted by cooperation, is when the decision maker will use only the weighted average of the forecasts and the scoring rule is quadratic, encouraging coalitions to report their weighted average forecast.\nIn performing our analysis of cooperating players, we have focused on arbitrage rather than maximal expected payment. For example, if the coalition is managed by an intermediary maximizing her expected payment, she should make an identical report for all of the coalition’s wagers using her personal forecast. We consider it more prudent to demonstrate how she can make a guaranteed profit without taking any risk or possessing any expertise.\nFinally, while we have examined the surplus from cooperation for a coalition, we have not discussed how coalition members should behave inside a coalition. Three related issues are what coalition members will report to each other, what they will report to the decision maker, and how they will share the surplus from cooperation. We have studied this problem assuming that players can act strategically within the coalition, seeking to maximize their expected payments in the context of the coalition’s decision process (Chun 2011). We assume that\n• players will be paid according to a quadratic scoring rule;\n• coalition members report to the decision maker the weighted average of the reports they shared within the coalition;\n• coalition members distribute the surplus from cooperation proportional to their weights; and\n• each coalition member believes that the expectation of the average of the other members’ true probabilities is the same as his own probability,\nEpi\n \nk∈C\nwk wC pk\n = pi, for all i ∈ C.\nThese are reasonable for players who accept the “wisdom of crowds.” Under these assumptions, because each coalition member wants to report truthfully within the coalition assuming that the others do so, it is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium for every coalition member to report truthfully within the coalition."
