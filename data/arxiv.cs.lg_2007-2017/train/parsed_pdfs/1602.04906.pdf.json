      "text" : "The latest video object cutout systems [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] comprise three major steps: (1) Keyframe segmentattion. performing keyframe image segmentation and refinement; (2) Foreground-background classification. performing classification on other frames given the keyframe segmentation; (3) Segmentation refinement. converting the classifier outputs to final cutout results on non-keyframes. Steps 2 and 3 are usually iteratively applied to subsequent frames until the user creates a new keyframe due to occurrence of visible errors.\nThe keyframe segmentation step can be done using interactive single image segmentation techniques. In foregroundbackground classification, with the help of motion estimation, foreground classifiers at different scales are constructed/trained from the segmented object in the current frame, and then applied to other frames. The classifiers generate a soft foreground probability map, which is incorporated into a segmentation model in the segmentation refinement step to generate the final object mask on the nonkeyframes.\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n04 90\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n6 Fe\nb 20\n16\n2\nFig. 2: An overview of our approach.\nThe Foreground-background classification and segmentation refinement are often considered as a single module called segmentation propagation, and most previous works focus only on designing new foreground-background classifiers, while little attention has been paid to the optimal estimation of the segmentation given the classifier output. In Video Snapcut [5], Bai et al. applied the conventional Markov random field (MRF) to the classification output to refine the result. More recently, Zhong et. al [6] applied matting directly after classification. The matting step behaves like random walk segmentation [10] and the latter is closely related to the MRF model [11]. We observe that when the errors from the classifiers tend to bias toward either the false positive or false negative error, the common MRF or matting, which treat the two types of errors equally, would fail to remove the errors satisfactorily. As an example, Figure 1 shows that common method could over shrink the spurious foreground regions produced by the classifier.\nMore recently, Fan et al. [9] proposed a novel method for propagating segmentation to non-successive frames in order to handle large object displacement. The propagated segmentation mask was refined using geodesic active contour (GAC) model [12] and the level set method [13], rather than MRF with graph cuts. Similar to the MRF based frameworks, GAC with level set method has also not been used to handle the possibly asymmetrically distributed FP and FN. Besides, other video cutout frameworks have been proposed [14], [15], [16]. Our contribution is parallel to these directions towards accurate and user-friendly video cutout."

The significance of this subproblem in the context of video cutout is first identified to the best of our knowledge.\nOur contribution is twofold. First, we propose a novel bilayer MRF in which the data term can treat the false positive and false negative errors from any given classifier differently using separate weights. Second, we propose a novel one-class structured support vector machine (OSSVM) model to learn the weights, as a computationally more favorable alternative to the conventional two-class structured SVM (2CSSVM) frameworks [17], [18]. We further establish the conditional equivalence between the OSSVM and the conventional (2CSSVM). This theoretical justification of OSSVM is also new in the context of structured learning. Figure 2 illustrates the flowchart of our method.\nOur proposed method for segmentation rectification adapts to different classifiers and achieves significant improvement on error reduction over previous methods [5], [6] in segmentation propagation in the experiments. Note that the confidence map adopted in [6] can be used to eliminate unreliable/ambiguous results from classifier output. However, it does not tell where the classifier is overconfident. Our method can remove the error in the classification regardless of the confidence of the classification."

      "text" : "In conventional video cutout systems [5], [6], the classifier output is refined by using the MRF-based segmentation model. The MRF model can be written as:\nmin f ∑ p∈P Up(fp) + ∑ {p,q}∈N Vpq(fp, fq), (1)\nwhere p refers to a pixel, P is the set of all pixels, fp is the pixel label and N is a neighbourhood system. Up and Vpq are the conventional unary and pairwise terms. The unary term can be used to represent the hard constraint given by the user, such as the seeds of foreground and\n3\nbackground regions, or it can be a region model or a shape prior. The pairwise potential is often used to model the object boundaries, and it has also been used to represent advanced priors in segmentation [19].\nThe unary term for incorporating foregroundbackground model can be written in the following form:\nUp(fp) = ∑ p∈P (fp − hp)2\n= ∑ p∈P fp + hp − 2fphp\n= ∑ p∈P hp(1− fp) + fp(1− hp)\n= ∑ p∈P fphp + fphp.\n(2)\nwhere hp is the classifier output (or probability map that gives the classifier output), hp and fp are both binary, fp = 1− fp and hp = 1− hp. The unary term is a pixelwise shape distance between the label f and the classifier output h. The above equation also provides a decomposition of the unary term, which implies that the unary term above can be naturally related to the two types of errors in segmentation, i.e., the false positives (FP) (background that wrongly considered as foreground) fphp, and the false negatives (FN) (missing foreground) fphp, as illustrated in Figure 3. FPR is defined as\nFPR = # of wrongly classified foreground pixels\ntotal # of pixels (3)\nand FNR is defined as\nFNR = # of wrongly classified background pixels\ntotal # of pixels . (4)"

      "text" : "Our segmentation rectification method is inspired by the shape-prior based MRF segmentation model [20], [21] in which shape distance is used in the segmentation model for handling occlusion and background clutter. In this work, we view the data term as shape distance and we show why and how we could reformulate this shape distance for segmentation rectification.\nFrom Eq. (2), we observe that the common shape distance used in the data term of the MRF uniquely breaks down into FP and FN with equal weights. To handle the possibly asymmetrically distributed FP and FN errors, we propose the following generic shape distance function to model the relationship between the classifier output and the true segmentation:\nSw(f, h) = ∑\n{p,q}∈Nfh\nwoutsidepq fphq + w inside pq fphq, (5)\nwhere Nfh denotes the neighborhood system across f and h. In this formulation, woutsidepq and w inside pq are two unknown data-dependent balancing weights. The neighborhood system across f and h yields a novel graph as visualized in Figure 6. The graph is in a bilayer structure: one layer is defined on the image to represent the unknown segmentation label f t at frame t, and the other layer is used to represent the propagated label ht. We have the following observation for different configurations of weights when p = q:\nweights effect woutsidepq = w inside pq Penalize FP and FN equally woutsidepq > w inside pq Penalize more FP than FN woutsidepq < w inside pq Penalize more FN than FP\nThis means the FP and FN can be treated differently with proper weights. Besides, by considering all the qs in Nfh in\n4\nthe formulation, the noise in the classification result can also be reduced, and the resultant Sw can be viewed as the local average distance."

      "text" : "Based on the previous observations, it becomes crucial to determine the optimal parameters in the proposed MRF model. One popular method for this task is known as structured learning [17], [18], [23], [24]. The basic idea is to consider the MRF parameter learning problem as a classification problem where good segmentations form one class and bad segmentations are the other class. This idea is illustrated in Figure 7. However, this framework requires searching\n5 for negative label samples fk, or the worst case [17], [18], [23], [24], which can be time-consuming. To remove the need for negative samples, we propose to apply the oneclass SVM, instead of the conventional two-class formulation [17], to the structured learning problem. The one-class SVM only requires samples from one class, e.g. positive class, for training [25], [26], [27]. Thus, the resultant oneclass structured SVM (OSSVM) will also only require the\npositive samples which are the images paired with ground truth segmentations."

      "heading" : "3.1 The two-class structured SVM",
      "text" : "Before we present our model, we briefly describe the conventional two-class structured SSVM (2CSSVM). We begin with the generic compact form of MRF. The MRF energy for one image can be written as an inner product form w.r.t. the weights w:\nE(f |w,x) = w ·Ψ(x, f) (13)\nwhere w is defined in Eq. (11), and x = {ht, wepp′}, f = f t to be consistent with Eq. (11). Note that this general notations adopted in this subsection allows us to easily extend our approach to other MRF models.\nWe expect the MRF energy to be as small as possible for the ground truth f∗ and we expect it to be as large as possible for other non-ideal f . This principle can be used for learning the weight vector w from data [17], [18], and it can be expressed as:\nmin w,b,~ξ\n1 2 ‖w‖2 + C N N∑ k=1 ξk\ns.t.: 2w ·Ψ(xk, fk)− b ≥ +1− ξk 2w ·Ψ(xk, f∗k )− b ≤ −1 + ξk k = 1, 2, 3, ..., N,\n(14)\nwhere C is a constant, k is the sample id, N is the number of samples, the constants b is a bias in conventional decision function and it’s unnecessary in segmentation, and ξk is a lack variable that tolerates errors in the training data. In the above model, the margin that separates the positive and negative samples are maximized by minimizing ‖w‖2.\nSince the positive and negative samples are paired, the respective constraints for each pair of samples can be combined to yield the following constraint:\nw ·Ψ(xk, fk)−w ·Ψ(xk, f∗k ) ≥ ∆(fk, f∗k )− ξk (15)\nDirectly combining the constraints in Eq. (14) gives ∆ = 1. For segmentation problem, ∆ is a specialized cost and is often set as ∆ = mean(|fk − f∗k |2) [28]. With the additional requirements of positiveness and boundedness of w, the above yields the conventional SSVM of the following form [17], [18], [23], [24].\nmin w,~ξ\n1 2 ‖w‖2 + C N N∑ k=1 ξk\ns.t.: ∀k, w · (Ψ(xk, fk)−Ψ(xk, f∗k )) ≥ ∆k − ξk,∑ i wi = 1,w ≥ 0.

We call this model one-class structured support vector machine (OSSVM), since it does not reply on fk. This optimization problem is well-known as one class support vector machine, and it has been thoroughly studied previously in the classification literature [25]. Here we further establish the rationale of the OSSVM in the context of structured learning.\nWe observe that the OSSVM, requiring only groundtruth masks, is conditionally equivalent to the conventional two-class SSVM model in which both of non-ideal segmentations and ground-truth segmentations are used. The formal statement is as follows. Theorem 3.1. The OSSVM model in Eq. (17) is identical to the\ntwo class SSVM model in Eq. (16) if both of the following conditions are true: (I) ∆(fk, f∗k ) = 1; (II) ∀k,Ψ(xk, fk) = bk, where bk is an arbitrary constant\nvector with equal elements. Its total sum is denoted by Bk.\nThere are obviously infinitely many such non-ideal segmentations for many common potentials and the condition allows bk to vary for different k. We defer its proof to the Appendix.\nIn a nutshell, this OSSVM model tries to maximize the “margin” from the energy corresponding to all groundtruth samples to the smallest energy produced by the same sample set, such that the margin between the energy of the positive samples and the potential energy of unknown negative samples is also maximized to some extent. We visualize this idea in Figure 8. Edge prior. A price of removing the negative samples is the accuracy of the model. Without negative sample, the training data may not be sufficient to yield satisfactory MRF model. We thus propose to impose a prior during the OSSVM learning. This can be crucial to even two-class SSVM when the ground-truth data itself contains errors.

Thus, the weight wedge in Eq. (9), which is actually w1, has to be large.

      "text" : "We first apply our framework to the global Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier for segmentation rectification. Generally, a global classifier like GMM is not suitable to video cutout [5], we conduct the experiment to validate the generality of our framework.\nIn the segmentation propagation, we train a GMM classifier using the ground truth segmentation on frame t, and apply it on frame t+ 1 as the propagated segmentation, and then apply our rectification approach with different weights, e.g., learned with or without prior as shown in Table 1, for further refinement. The average boundary deviation are summarized in Figure 9. Some typical results are shown in Figure 10. The results suggest that our rectification approach with learned weights can significantly improve the segmentation results generated by the GMM classifier.\nDue to the well-known non-local behavior of GMM based classifier, it’s not surprising to see that 2CSSVM and OSSVM with prior significantly outperform all other cases. The experimental results shown in this subsection also imply that the errors from GMM for image cutout can be more effectively removed by using our method, compared with the conventional methods based on graph cuts and matting [31], [32], and the 2CSSVM outperforms the rest in this case while the OSSVM is the best alternative when computational efficiency in learning is a concern. Note that as shown in the visual results in Figure 10, significant errors can still be observed in the refined output, and this reasserts that global classifier such as GMM alone is not suitable for video cutout.\nIt is also interesting to note that global classifiers, such as GMM, are commonly adopted in image cutout [31], [32]. Hence, these results suggests that our method may be applied to image cutout as well."

After 10 frames of propagation, matting and graph cut generates 4 times and 2 times more error than our method respectively. We also present the visual results for a “Car” sequence in the Test set in Figure 12, and a “Bear” sequence from the Training set in Figure 11.\nWe also compare our method with Video SnapCut (Rotobrush) [5] and [6] on additional video sequences. Some of the typical results are shown in Figures 13 and 14. We can observe that the Rotobrush could suffer from the temporal discontinuity while segmentation error could easily accumulate in other methods based on Zhong et al.’s classifier."

Since our OSSVM framework can be easily extended to handling the extra depth dimension, we also apply our method to RGB-D data for evaluation. The segmentation rectification model for RGB-D data is the same as Eq. (11), except that the potential is defined as\nΨRGBD =  ∑ pp′ w eRGB pp′ ∣∣f tp − f tp′ ∣∣, {p, p′} ∈ N∑ pp′ w eD pp′\n∣∣f tp − f tp′ ∣∣, {p, p′} ∈ N∑ pq(1− htq)f tp, {p, q} ∈ Nfh∑ pq h t q(1− f tp), {p, q} ∈ Nfh\n , (19)\n9 FB C la ss ifi er [6 ]+ M at ti ng\nFB C\nla ss\nifi er\n+ U\nW G C A do be R ot ob ru\nsh O ur m et ho d (2 C SS V M\n) O ur m et ho d (O SS V M )\nFig. 13: Results of fully automatic segmentation propagation for the “Catwalk” sequence on frames 1 (left), 6 (middle) and 19 (right), given keyframe segmentation.

Since a number of sequences in the original dataset contain very dark or motion-blurred objects, we select a subset containing 22 sequences with identifiable object boundaries in RGB domain for this experiment. Note that visually identifiable boundaries are required in the context of video cutout and for ground truth delineation. There are a total of 835 frames in the selected subset. Besides, the original dataset only provides the keyframe segmentations. Therefore, we manually cutout each frame.\n10\nThe visual comparison of results from the related methods are shown in Figure 16. From the visual results, we can observe that the results are comparable and our OSSVM on RGB-D outperforms others in general. The quantitative results are shown in Figure 17 and Table 3, which further validated our observation. The first impression is that the overall errors are only around 3 pixels small for many of the methods up to 10 subsequent frames. Besides, we see that our OSSVM on RGB-D and 2CSSVM on RGB-D are very comparable and OSSVM is still better than the other methods.\nThe comparable performance is due to that the object/background motion in the videos in this dataset are often either very small or abrupt, and the method may perform equally good or bad on most of them. The RGB-D\nvideo cutout system would further benefit from a dedicated RGB-D object classifier which is beyound the scope of this paper."

From our experiment, we observe that this prior is crucial to the performance. To select the optimal weights, we perform 10-fold cross validation with 7 possible prior weights on a uniform grid {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3}, for both of the RGB and RGB-D datasets used in our experiments.

When the prior on the edge weight is too high, the weights on the data term may be too small to produce semantically meaningful results."

      "heading" : "5.6 Limitations",
      "text" : "Although experiments show that our rectification approach can effectively improve the performance of existing video cutout systems, it may fail in challenging cases. A typical failure case is imperfect edge extraction. State-of-the art edge detection techniques are often reliable, but their results may still contain errors. Such errors may impair the segmentation rectification. See Figure 19 for such an example. The edge map shows that there is a clear strong edge caused by the shadow in-between the legs, causing segmentation rectification to be less effective in this region.\nAnother common problem for segmentation propagation is having abrupt changes on the object itself, especially the abrupt emergence of object parts. Figure 20 shows a typical example. Apart from more user interactions, we believe this problem can be solved by using a more sophisticated propagation model, such as a long-term shape prior."

      "heading" : "6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK",
      "text" : "We propose a novel generic approach to automatically rectify the propagated segmentation in video cutout systems. The core idea of our work is to incorporate a generic shape distance measure in a bilayer MRF framework learned from data to remove the intrinsic bias of the classifier in the segmentation propagation step. This work is motivated by our observation that different classifiers bias toward FP and FN differently, but they were treated equally in the previous video cutout systems. We found that FP and FN can be\n12\ntreated differently in our bilayer MRF, and the optimal form of the MRF can be learned from the data. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach can significantly improve the state-of-the-art video cutout systems in segmentation accuracy.\nThere are several vision tasks related to the interactive video cutout problem, such as [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. In computer vision, those problems can be thought of as shape tracking problem, and errors are generally tolerable. Convenient user interaction is also not a concern to them. In contrast, the interactive video cutout problem does not tolerate visible errors in the segmentation and user-friendly interaction is a crucial concern. It has been proven that the state-of-the-art video cutout frameworks are particularly suitable for the video cutout problem. In most of the works in vision, global optimization frameworks for whole sequences are often adopted. It has been noted in [5] that localized optimization allows user to have better control of the video cutout process. Our method is proposed dedicatedly for video cutout. Its extension for generic video segmentation tasks has yet to be explored.\nAPPENDIX Proof of Theorem 3.1 We first substitute the two conditions stated in the theorem into the constraint in Eq. (16) and we obtain\nw · (Ψ(xk, fk)−Ψ(xk, f∗k )) ≥ ∆k − ξk ⇔w · (bk −Ψ(xk, f∗k )) ≥ 1− ξk ⇔w ·Ψ(xk, f∗k ) ≤ −1 + ξ̂k\n(22)\nwhere have applied the normalization constraint ∑ i wi = 1\nand we set ξ̂k = Bk + ξk, Bk = ∑ j [bk]j . The above gives us the constraint in the OSSVM formulation in Eq. (17). The objective function in Eq. (16) can accordingly be rewritten as\n1 2 ‖w‖2 + C N N∑ k=1 (ξ̂k −Bk)\n= 1 2 ‖w‖2 + C N N∑ k=1 ξ̂k − C N N∑ k=1 Bk\n(23)\nwhere the last term is a constant. By omitting the constant we obtain the objective function in OSSVM Eq. (17).\nLastly, due to the one-to-one correspondence between ξ̂k and ξk for any k, we know that optimizing over w and {ξk} is equivalent to optimizing over w and {ξ̂k}, which completes the proof."

    "abstractText" : "Recent works on interactive video object cutout mainly focus on designing dynamic foreground-background (FB) classifiers for segmentation propagation. However, the research on optimally removing errors from the FB classification is sparse, and the errors often accumulate rapidly, causing significant errors in the propagated frames. In this work, we take the initial steps to addressing this problem, and we call this new task segmentation rectification. Our key observation is that the possibly asymmetrically distributed false positive and false negative errors were handled equally in the conventional methods. We, alternatively, propose to optimally remove these two types of errors. To this effect, we propose a novel bilayer Markov Random Field (MRF) model for this new task. We also adopt the well-established structured learning framework to learn the optimal model from data. Additionally, we propose a novel one-class structured SVM (OSSVM) which greatly speeds up the structured learning process. Our method naturally extends to RGB-D videos as well. Comprehensive experiments on both RGB and RGB-D data demonstrate that our simple and effective method significantly outperforms the segmentation propagation methods adopted in the state-of-the-art video cutout systems, and the results also suggest the potential usefulness of our method in image cutout system. Fig. 0: Given a keyframe segmentation provided by the user (left), our approach generates accurate object cutout results in subsequent frames fully automatically (middle), which can be used for creating a novel compositing (right).",
