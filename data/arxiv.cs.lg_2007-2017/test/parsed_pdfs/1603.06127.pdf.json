We discuss the problem of evaluating randomized models, propose a statistically grounded methodology, and attempt to improve comparisons by releasing new datasets that are much harder than some of the currently used well explored benchmarks.\nTo address the current research fragmentation in a future-proof way, we introduce a unified open source software framework with easily pluggable models, allowing easy evaluation on a wide range of semantic natural language tasks. This allows us to outline a path towards a universal machine learned semantic model for machine reading tasks. We support this plan by experiments that demonstrate reusability of models trained on different tasks, even across corpora of very different nature."

      "text" : "A typical NLP machine learning task involves classifying a sequence of tokens such as a sen-\ntence or a document, i.e. approximating a function f1(s) ∈ [0, 1] (where f1 may determine a domain, sentiment, etc.). But there is a large class of problems that involve classifying a pair of sentences, f2(s0, s1) ∈ R (where s0, s1 are sequences of tokens, typically sentences).\nTypically, the function f2 represents some sort of semantic similarity, that is whether (or how much) the two sequences are semantically related. This formulation allows f2 to be a measure for tasks as wide as topic relatedness, paraphrasing, degree of entailment, a pointwise ranking task for answer-bearing sentences or next utterance classification.\nIn this work, we adopt the working assumption that there exist certain universal f2 type measures that may be successfuly applied to a wide variety of semantic similarity tasks — in the case of fully differentiable models, both architecture-wise and weight-wise, trained to represent universal semantic comprehension of sentences and adapted to the given task by just fine-tuning or adapting the final dense layer. Our argument for preferring f2 to f1 in this pursuit is the fact that the other sentence in the pair is essentially a very complex label when training the sequence model, which can therefore discern semantically rich structures and dependencies.\nDetermining and demonstrating such universal semantic comprehension models across multiple tasks remains a few steps ahead, since the research landscape is fragmented in this regard, with model research typically reported within the context of just a single f2-type task, each dataset requiring sometimes substantial engineering work before measurements are possible, and results reported in ways that make meaningful model comparisons problematic. The primary purpose of this work is to unify research within a single framework that employs task-independent mod-\nels, task-specific adaptation modules and unified statistically appropriate methodology for reportings. To demonstrate the feasibility of pursuing universal, task-independent f2 models, we show that even simple neural models learn universal semantic comprehension as we improve their performance (even on relatively large datasets) by employing cross-task transfer learning.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2, we outline possible specific f2 tasks and available datasets; in Sec. 3, we survey the popular basic baselines and the simpler currently employed neural models on these tasks; finally, in Sec. 4, we present model-task performances within a unified framework to establish the watermark for future research as well as gain insight into the suitability of models across a variety of tasks. In Sec. 5, we demonstrate that transfer learning across tasks is helpful to powerfully seed models. We conclude with Sec. 6, summarizing our findings and outlining several future research directions."

      "text" : "Given a question and a set of candidate answerbearing sentences, the task here is to rank higher sentences that are more likely to contain the answer to the question. As it is fundamentally an Information Retrival task in nature, the model performance is commonly evaluated in terms of Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean Reciprocial Rank (MRR).\nThis task is popular in the NLP research community thanks to the dataset introduced in (Wang et al., 2007) which we refer to as wang, with six papers published between February 2015 and 2016 alone and neural models substantially improving over classical approaches based primarily on parse tree edits.1 We can certainly call it the main research testbed for f2-style task models.\n1 http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php? title=Question_Answering_(State_of_the_ art)\nThis task has also immediate applications e.g. in Question Answering systems.\nIn the context of practical applications, the sofar standard wang dataset has several downsides we observed when tuning and evaluating our models, illustrated numerically in Fig. 1 — the set of candidate sentences is often very small and quite uneven (which also makes rank-based measures unstable) and the total number of questions as well as individual sentence pairs is relatively small. Furthermore, the validation and test set are very small which makes for noisy performance measurements; the splits also seem quite different in the nature of questions since we see minimum correlation between performance on the validation and set tests, which calls the parameter tuning procedures and epoch selection for early stopping into question.\nAlternative datasets WikiQA (Yang et al., 2015) and InsuranceQA (Tan et al., 2015) were proposed, but are encumbered by licence restrictions. Furthermore, we speculate that they may suffer from many of the problems above2 (even if they are somewhat larger) and they did not gain much traction in the research community.\nTo alleviate the problems listed above, we are introducing a new dataset yodaqa/curatedv2 based on the curatedv2 question dataset (introduced in (Baudiš and Šedivý, 2015), further denoisified by Mechanical Turkers) with candidate sentences as retrieved by the YodaQA question answering system (Baudiš, 2015) from English Wikipedia. For models that can make substantial use of more data, we also include an even larger dataset yodaqa/large2470 (though it has seen less gold standard denoisification), with its splits as supersets of the smaller splits.3\nFig. 1 compares the critical characteristics of the datasets. Furthermore, as apparent below, the baseline performances on the newly proposed datasets are much lower, which suggests that future improvements will be more apparent in evaluation.\n2For example, InsuranceQA is effectively a classification task rather than a ranking task, which we do not find as appealing in the context of practical applications.\n3Note that the wang and yodaqa datasets however share a common ancestry regarding the set of questions and there may be some overlaps, even across train and test splits. Therefore, mixing training and evaluation on wang and yodaqa datasets within a single model instance is not advisable."

The technical formulation of the task is the same as for Answer Sentence Selection, but semantically, choosing the best followup involves different concerns than choosing an answer-bearing sentence.\nThe newly proposed Ubuntu Dialogue dataset is based on IRC chat logs of the Ubuntu community technical support channels and contains casually typed interactions regarding computer-related problems.4 While the training set consists of individual labelled pairs of token sequences, evaluation is done by ranking 10 followups to given message(s) that are potentially relatively long (even more than 200 tokens).\nOur primary motivation for using this dataset is its size.

Contrary to Answer Sentence Selection, state-of-art methods are based on parse tree alignments (Sultan et al., 2015) and weren’t beaten by neural models yet.\nWe also report results for this task on another dataset from the SemEval conferences, SICK2014 (Marelli et al., 2014). In contrast to the STS track, it is geared at specifically benchmarking semantic compositional methods, aiming to capture only similarities on purely language and common knowledge level, without relying on domain knowledge, and there are no named entities or multi-word idioms.

Unless noted otherwise, a Siamese architecture is used that shares weights among both sentenes.\nA scorer module that compares the E0, E1 sentence embeddings to produce a scalar result is connected to the model; for specific task-model configurations, we use either the dot-product module E0 · ET1 (representing non-normalized vector angle, as in e.g. (Yu et al., 2014) or (Weston et al., 2014)) or the MLP module that takes elementwise product and sum of the embeddings and feeds them to a two-layer perceptron with hidden layer of width 2N (as in e.g. (Tai et al., 2015)).8 For the STS task, we follow this by score regression using class interpolation as in (Tai et al., 2015).\nWhen training for a ranking task (Answer Sentence Selection), we use the bipartite ranking version of Ranknet (Burges et al., 2005) as the objective; when training for STS task, we use Pearson’s r formula as the objective; for binary classification tasks, we use the binary crossentropy objective."

IDF is determined on the training set.\nThe avg metric represents the baseline method when using word embeddings that proved successful e.g. in (Yu et al., 2014) or (Weston et al., 2014), simply taking the mean vector of the word embedding sequence and training an U weight matrix N×2N that projects both embeddings to the same vector space, Ei = tanh(U · ēi), where the MLP scorer compares them. During training, p = 1/3 standard (elementwise) dropout is applied on the input embeddings.\nA simple extension of the above are the DAN Deep Averaging Networks (Iyyer et al., 2015), which were shown to adequately replace much more complex models in some tasks. Two dense perceptron layers are stacked between the mean and projection, relu is used instead of tanh as the non-linearity, and word-level dropout is used instead of elementwise dropout."

There are many ways to model attention, as the initial proof of concept we adopt the (Tan et al., 2015) model attn1511 which is conceptually simple and easy to implement. It asymmetrically extends the RNN-CNN model by extra links from s0 CNN output to the post-recurrent representation of each s1 token, determining an attention level for each token by weighed sum of the token vectors, and focusing on the relevant s1 segment by transforming the attention levels using softmax and multiplying the token representations by the attention levels before they are fed to the convolutional network.\nConvolutional network weights are not shared between the two sentences and the convolutional network output is not projected before applying the MLP scorer.

As a workaround, ensemble of world overlap count and neural model score is typically used to produce the final score. We try to adopt a more flexible approach, extending the embedding of each input token by several extra dimensions carrying boolean flags — bigram overlap, unigram overlap (except stopwords and interpunction), and whether the token starts with a capital letter or is a number.\nParticular hyperparameters are tuned primarily on the yodaqa/curatedv2 dataset unless noted otherwise in the respective results table caption. We apply 10−4 L2 regularization and use Adam optimization with standard parameters (Kingma and Ba, 2014). In the answer selection tasks, we train on 1/4 of the dataset in each epoch.

Developing adapters, models and benchmarks for the task of Recognizing Textual Entailment remains the major next step, as well as for the problem of Hypothesis Evidencing where we would like to study the task of producing a binary classification of a hypothesis sentence s0 based on a number of memory sentences s1. We are in the process of developing realistic, hard datasets\nbased on real-world event yes/no questions and newspaper snippets, as well as solving school test exams based on textbook and encyclopedia snippets.\nWe also did not include several major classes of models in our initial evaluation. Most notably, this includes serial RNNs with attention as used e.g. for the RTE task (Rocktäschel et al., 2015), and the skip-thoughts method of sentence embedding. (Kiros et al., 2015)\nWe believe that the Ubuntu Dialogue Dataset results demonstrate that the time is ripe to push the research models further towards the real world by allowing for wider sentence variability and less explicit supervision. But in particular, we believe that new models should be developed and tested on tasks with long sentences and wide vocabulary. Pushing the models to their limits will allow better differentiation regarding how much semantic text comprehension they are able to exhibit, which in turn should improve reusability, but datasets with low baseline performance will also better emphasize relative performance difference of individual models and make statistical significance more attainable.\nIn terms of models, recent work in many NLP domains (dos Santos et al., 2016) (Cheng et al., 2016) (Kumar et al., 2015) clearly points towards\nvarious forms of attention modelling to remove the bottleneck of having to compress the full spectrum of semantics into a single vector of fixed dimensionality. Another promising approach might be giving the network more flexibility regarding the final representation, for example by allowing it to remember a set of “facts” derived from each sentence; related work has been done on end-to-end differentiable shift-reduce parsers with LSTM as stack cells (Dyer et al., 2015).\nIn this paper, we have shown the benefit of training a model on a single dataset and then applying it on another dataset. One open question is whether we could jointly train a model on multiple tasks simultaneously (even if they do not share some output layers), for example by task-by-task batch interleaving during training. Another way to\nimprove training would be to include extra supervision similar to the token overlap features that we already employ; for example, in the new Answer Sentence Selection task datasets, we can explicitly mark the actual tokens representing the answer."

We argue that such tasks are similar from the model perspective (especially in the context of high-capacity deep neural models) and propose new baselines by comparing the performance of popular convolutional, recurrent and attentionbased neural models across many Sentence Pair Scoring tasks and datasets. We discuss the problem of evaluating randomized models, propose a statistically grounded methodology, and attempt to improve comparisons by releasing new datasets that are much harder than some of the currently used well explored benchmarks. To address the current research fragmentation in a future-proof way, we introduce a unified open source software framework with easily pluggable models, allowing easy evaluation on a wide range of semantic natural language tasks. This allows us to outline a path towards a universal machine learned semantic model for machine reading tasks. We support this plan by experiments that demonstrate reusability of models trained on different tasks, even across corpora of very different nature.",
