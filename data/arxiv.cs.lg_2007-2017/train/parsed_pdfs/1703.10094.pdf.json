      "text" : "The paper of Deep convolutional generative adversarial nets [10] shows the great potential in the mapping between image space X and latent space Z. This relation can be used in the fields of image processing and searching. Finding the inverse mapping of generator can also provide us useful insights to the generator and we may use this to improve the performance of generator. However, the mapping from Z-space to image space X isn’t a bijection. It brings a great challenge for finding the inverse mapping of generator.\nDumoulin [4] and Donahue [3] proposed a way of learning encoder network\n∗\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n10 09\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\nalongside the generator and discriminator. This approach successfully avoid the problem of directly training the inverse model. However, this approach has a shortcoming that sample images and and corresponding reconstructions don’t have a very good correlation. The main reason can be that the discriminator only focus on the difference between data sets instead of the difference between two images. So the encoder part can’t catch the unique features of one signal image. In addition it needs to train a third network with the generative net, which means that inversion cannot be learned from a pre-trained generative network. Creswell and Bharath [2] proposed a different idea that can get a good correlation between samples and reconstructions. The main idea is to minimize the difference between generated image G(z) and sample image x by change the value of z. This approach takes the desired output z as optimization goal. To get a corresponding z we have to use the gradient descent. It’ very simple and easy. But it is not very practical because it doesn’t provide a real inverse function. We have to calculate the z by using multiple gradient descents every time. In the invertible conditional GANs(ICGAN) proposed by Perarnau et al. [9], the inverse model are trained by directly minimizing the difference between Encode(x) and (z, y). Encoder(x) has two outputs. The first is z and the second is label information vector y. The label information limits the freedom of z space. And the conditional vector y is helpful for training the inverse model. But this approach requires abundant label information and such data sets are very rare.\nHence we propose a new approach of learning the inverse mapping by AntoEncoder based on GANs(AEGAN) as a complement of their works. We use the idea of training the AutoEncoder to train a inverse model of a pre-trained generator. And this approach doesn’t have the shortcomings mentioned above. The experiments show that AEGAN successfully learns the inverse mapping of original generator of GAN. And the corresponding vectors of images contains rich semantic information."

So we require z′ can generate the same images as z instead of being same as z.

Because our approach is based on unsupervised learning. We don’t give out any additional information for this task. So it’s fair to make our approach compete with them. We compare AEGAN with three general image searching algorithms: dHash, pHash and color histogram. In addition, we use Euclidean Distance of corresponding z vectors of images to get the similarity. If the distance is smaller we think two pictures are more similar.\nWe take a image from the original data set celebA and add some other factors to form the 3 test images. Then we implement 4 different algorithms to find the closest images in the\nrst 20,000 images of celebA.The Figure 4 proves that AEGAN is very suitable for this task.\n11\nTo evaluate the comprehensive performance, the second experiment is aiming at finding the similar images. We only compare our algorithm with dHash, since it has a very good performance in the first experiment. We take the first 20,000 images of celebA as the test set. And take 64 images from the other part of the celebA as base images.\nAs we can see from Figure 5, AEGAN approach is much better than dHash. AEGAN catches the important features of face images such as the face angle, face similarity, hair style and expression. AEGAN may be not as good as specialized face recognition algorithms. But we have to emphasize again that this approach is unsupervised and universal. In other words, this idea can easily be implemented in other fields. We don’t have to artificially find the best features for the task. This algorithm can automatically find the best features for the task and it only requires unlabeled data."

      "text" : "AEGAN uses the idea of Auotoencoder to overcome the difficulty in training a inverse model of generator. And the experiments show that the inverse mapping of generator has a very similar function compared with Word Embedding [6]. This ability can be very helpful in fields of image and video processing. It’s possible to get a universal vector representation of image if we train the AEGAN at large image data sets. And it’s worth trying to apply this approach in video processing by first transforming the each frame of video to the corresponding image vector. In addition, we can use AEGAN to reform the Image-to-Image\nTranslation approach based on GAN [7]. With AEGAN, the training of generator part can be done in unsupervised condition and we only need to train the encoder part in conditional situation. In other words, it’s possible to train a Image-to-Image GAN net in semi-supervised condition if we use the structure of AEGAN. However, one disadvantage of AEGAN is that the performance of AEGAN is limited by the power of generator. To get a good inverse mapping we need to train a good generator at first."
