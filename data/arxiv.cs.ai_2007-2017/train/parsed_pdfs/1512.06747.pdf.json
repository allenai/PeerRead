      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nWearable sensors have widespread applications in academic, industrial and medical fields. Examples of some current uses are fall detection in medical or home settings [1], and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) for smart health-monitoring systems [2].\nA substantial amount of research has been done with professional on-body wearable sensors. However, these devices are usually large, impractical or inconvenient for general commercial purposes. One viable alternative is smartphone sensors. Smartphones are equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes, which provide rich motion data on their users. Although these sensors are less accurate than professional ones, the prevalence and convenience of smartphones suggests their potential for far-reaching applications. Possible benefits include a decreased need for human supervision in medical settings, more complex human-machine interaction, and complex activity recognition on smartphone applications.\nOur objective is an offline implementation of smartphone motion data classification that has comparable classification accuracy and computational efficiency with current techniques, and does not require domain knowledge of HAR.\nIn this paper, we propose a method based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). DTW has recently been widely used and integrated with other methods such as decision trees [3] in machine learning. Although DTW suffers from high computational costs and Dynamic Time Warping Distance (DTWD) is not a distance metric because it lacks the triangle inequality, DTW still has the potential to be a feasible answer to the above task by providing a flexible, easily interpretable time\n* All authors contributed equally in this work.\nseries similarity measure. By modifying DTW to improve on computational efficiency and similarity measure accuracy, we proceed to use it for motion data clustering, activity template construction and classification for our problem. Each template is the time series average representing a cluster. It has the benefit of providing visual representations of a human activity and does not require HAR knowledge for construction.\nAs such, the primary contributions of this paper are:\n1) Modification of DTW as a similarity measure for time series, 2) Procedure for template extraction in place of feature extraction.\nOur implementation enhances the quality of prediction, avoids high dimensionality, and is robust to noise. For demonstration, we use real human activity data, as well as synthetic data constructed from human activity data.\nIn Section II, we proceed by discussing existing methods for classifying human activities using feature extraction, hierarchical divide-and-conquer strategies, and multi-modalsequence classification. Section III formally defines Dynamic Time Warping and Section IV describes our proposed modifications to increase prediction accuracy. Section V discusses our template selection and classification approach which utilizes the modified DTW. In Sections VI and VII, we apply our algorithm to both real world data and synthetic data. Finally, in Section VIII and onwards, we compare the results of our algorithm with existing algorithms, and conclude."

      "text" : "Considerable work has been done on classifying human activities. We consolidate works on both professional on-body sensors and smartphone sensors, while taking note that data from the latter may need different pre-processing steps due to higher noise tendencies. Furthermore, on-body sensors can be placed at more assigned locations on the body such as arms and ankles, and may include more components such as magnetometer [1].\nAn essential step in many papers is feature extraction. Popular features for such tasks include mean, standard deviation, maximum, peak-to-peak, root-mean-square, and correlation978-1-4799-7560-0/15/$31 c©2015 IEEE\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n06 74\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 1\nD ec\nbetween values of modality axes [4]. Another suggested option is using autoregressive modeling to form augmented-feature vectors [5].\nFollowing feature extraction, algorithms used for classification include Hidden Markov Models [2], Support Vector Machines [4], Multi-layer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network, Decision Table, Best-First Tree, and K-star [6]. Although the strategy can increase classification accuracy, it requires manual grouping of the activities into meaningful categories. Comparative study across these algorithms has also been done [7].\nWhile feature extraction is quite popular in HAR for achieving high accuracy rates, there are a few problems with feature extraction. First, it is dependent on domain expertise as achieving high accuracy through feature extraction is only possible with the correct features. Second, feature extraction is prone to high dimensionality as a large number of features are needed. Finally computing some of these features such as autoregression coefficients can be computationally intensive.\nCurrent DTW methods on HAR involve aligning human behavior in video data [8]. These methods use a generalized time warping mechanism to extend DTW to aligning multimodal sequences [9]. While our proposed method discussed in Section IV uses DTW, we recognize that we cannot translate these methods directly for our approach since the data modality is different, and sequences extracted from video data may have different properties from raw sensor readings."

This version of DTW is called FastDTW [11]. Algorithm 1 denotes the procedure to compute DTWD(Xi, Xj ; bw). A small bandwidth should be employed if the two time series demonstrate the same shape and frequency, since a smaller bandwidth brings the computational time closer to O(m).\nData: time series Xi, Xj , bandwidth bw Result: DTWD(Xi, Xj ; bw) Initialize distance matrix D = 0m×m D[1, 1] = |Xi(1)−Xj(1)| for s ∈ {2, . . . ,m} do\nD[s, 1] = D[1, s] =∞ end for s ∈ {2, . . . ,m} do\nfor t ∈ {max(2, s− bw),min(m, s+ bw)} do cost=min (D[s− 1, t], D[s, t− 1], D[s− 1, t− 1])\nD[s, t] = |Xi (s)−Xj (t)|+ cost\nend end return D[m,m]\nAlgorithm 1: Fast DTW\nOne time series Xj can be aligned to another Xi by using the optimal path defined in Definition 3.3. The basic concept of DTW alignment is illustrated in Figure 1. DTW first creates a matrix D of pointwise distances depicted as a black and white grid in the image on the right. The algorithm then runs through D from the first index (bottom left) to the last index (top right), enumerates all paths w, and finds an optimal warping path w∗ as specified in Definition 3.3. The optimal warping path is shown as the darkened line in the image on the right, and the\nalignment between the two series is shown in the image on the left. The algorithm also returns the sum of the pointwise distances along the optimal path [12].\nAlgorithm 2 is used to align two time series.

      "text" : "An apparent drawback of DTWD is the overstatement of the dissimilarity between two copies of a time series when one copy is horizontally displaced. DTW cannot match the ends of the two copies without incurring a cost. For instance, a sine curve and cosine curve can be obtained from the same sinusoidal function due to sampling from a long series, but DTWD returns a positive value. This limits the functionality of DTWD as a similarity measure.\nTo alleviate this, we propose a modification to DTW based on subsequence matching [13]. We relax the boundary condition that the optimal path must start at the bottom left\nD[1, 1] and end at the top right D[m,m] of the distance matrix D.\nComputing all possible paths is computational expensive. To induce computational savings, we introduce a displacement window parameter dw, which is the maximum horizontal displacement of the samples. We restrict our search to paths that start and end within the window defined by dw. This parameter can be empirically estimated through the distribution of a common landmark in the data. For periodic data, the natural displacement window is the period.\nWe view similar time series as those having similar shape and frequency. Therefore, at each displacement k, we truncate both input series, Xi and Xj , to the same length. To obtain a distance with respect to the original length, for the truncated series, Xki and X k j , the resulting DTWD ( Xki , X k j ) is weighed proportionately to their length by\nDTWDk (Xi, Xj) = m\nm− k + 1 DTWD\n( Xki , X k j ) DTWsubseq, displayed below in Algorithm 3, is further\noptimized by imposing a bandwidth as in Fast DTW.\nData: time series Xi, Xj , displacement window dw, bandwidth bw Result: DTWsubseqD(Xi, Xj ; dw, bw) Initialize optD =∞ for k ∈ {1, . . . , dw} do\nXki = Xi[k : m] Xkj = Xj [1 : m− k + 1] Dk = DTWD\nk (Xi, Xj ; bw) if Dk < optD then\noptD = Dk end\nend return optD\nAlgorithm 3: Fast DTWsubseq"

We propose a method based on DTWsubseq and hierarchical clustering, which avoids intensive feature extraction, and can alleviate many of the problems with feature extraction discussed in Section II.\nOur approach to classification is to use the training data to build time series templates representing each activity, and subsequently classify the test data according to their similarity to these templates using DTWsubseqD. This type of templatebased method is robust to speed and style variations of the subjects’ motions, and potentially requires less training data than feature-based methods [8].\nBefore giving details of how to construct templates, we present a general diagram of the full classification procedure illustrated in Figure 2."

The results for classification on both synthetic data and the UCI dataset are shown in Table III.\nBefore comparing accuracy, we comment on a few advantages our method has over feature extraction. First, our methods have the natural advantage that no domain knowledge is required, compared to the importance of extracting the correct features. In order to achieve high accuracy using feature extraction, a large number of features need to be extracted (over 500). To achieve comparable accuracy, using DTW-DBA with cut = 0.25 our method builds around 220 templates, less than half the number of features. Second, some features such as autocorrelation increase with the length of the time series, and almost all features increase with p, the dimension of each point. The dimensionality of our method is only influenced by the number of templates, which can be fixed through the cut parameter. Third, our method has reduced computational complexity compared to feature extraction.

      "text" : "Figure 6 shows that our clustering scheme performs reasonably well in grouping differently-shaped curves. Both template methods are able to capture the shape of the data. In fact, the DPA and DBA templates appear very similar to one another.\nJudging from the classification accuracy results in Table I, for both cut = 0.5 and 0.25, DTW performs better with DBA, achieving 0.797 over 0.781 and 0.860 over 0.841 respectively. When cut = 0.25, DTWsubseq also does better with DBA, with accuracy 0.855 over 0.838. But when cut = 0.5, DTWsubseq performs better with DPA, achieving 0.789 over 0.777.\nOne possible reason why DBA did not consistently work better is that the starting average sequence in DPA is initialized using the same similarity measure (DTWD, DTWsubseqD) as is used for clustering. The starting average sequence in DBA is initialized with a random candidate in the cluster, as suggested in the original paper [14].\nIt’s possible that with a few modifications, such as picking the right initializing series for DBA, DTWsubseq-DBA with cut = 0.5 could achieve higher accuracy as it performs well in distinguishing between static and dynamic activities. It makes only 22 classification errors between static and dynamic activities, comparable to DTWsubseq-DPA, and has comparable accuracy when considering 4 activities as shown in parentheses in Table I.\nThe effects of lowering the cut threshold are clear-cut. As expected, lowering the threshold (and increasing the number of clusters) increased accuracy . With original DTW we see an increase in accuracy from 0.781 to 0.841 with DPA, and subsequently up to 0.86 with DBA. Using DTWsubseq, we see an increase with DBA, and a smaller increase with DPA. This may primarily be due to overfitting. Decreasing cut from 0.5 to 0.25 increase the number of templates from around 50 to over 500.\nThe highest accuracy our method achieved was 0.860 using DTW-DBA with cut = 0.25, which is comparable to the feature extraction method which had a test accuracy of 0.890. One possibility is that the flat curves in static activities have not been sufficiently removed. The static activity curves usually have a spike, then remain flat. As some flat portions still remain in our training and test sets, all 3 static activities contain flat templates and hence induce high classification error within themselves. This is evidenced by the confusion matrix for DTW-DBA shown in Table IV where there are lots of misclassifications between activities 3-5, especially for activity 5.\nHowever, we find that our methods are capable of performing better than feature extraction when we circumvent the issue of the flat templates. Looking at the values in parenthesis in Table I where we perform a 4-category classification of walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs and static activities, all our methods with cut = 0.25 outperforms feature extraction’s 0.965 accuracy. DTW-DBA and DTWsubseq-DBA perform the best with 0.977.\nSummarizing the results of our method on the UCI HAR dataset, compared with benchmark feature extraction method, we see that our accuracy rates are similar for six activities and better for four activities. Within our template-based methods, we see that there is no clear improvement using DPA versus DBA, and there is a slight overall improvement using DTWsubseq over DTW. Finally, we see that in all cases decreasing the cut parameter increases accuracy."

The samples in Figure 7 are created from a single time series and modified by adding noise at a small region of the curve. DBA successfully accounts for this, as its template is identical to all curves at points other than the noisy region, and its shape matches the noisy region fairly well. On the other hand, DPA fails to capture the identical shape of the curve as it underestimates the magnitudes of the peaks and troughs.\nHowever, because the test data is constructed from a different template (simulating a different person), DBA overfits to the training data. All methods with DPA perform similarly or better than with DBA. With DPA instead of DBA, DTWsubseq achieves 0.650 over 0.640 with cut = 0.5, and 0.700 over 0.655 with cut = 0.25. DTW performs similarly with DPA and DBA with 0.615 and 0.620 respectively, and better with DPA for cut = 0.25 obtaining 0.615 over 0.580.\nThe cut threshold follows similar trends as in the UCI dataset, except that cut = 0.25 for DTW-DBA achieves lower accuracy than cut = 0.5. This is likely due to overfitting as the number of templates created was around 400.\nOur method achieves the highest accuracy using DTWsubseq-DPA with cut = 0.25 (0.700), 3% higher than that of feature extraction (0.67). This gives good indication that our method is potentially suitable for realworld applications, since it is more robust to noise than feature extraction, and is better at generalizing to data from new test subjects.\nSummarizing the results of our method on the synthetic dataset, we see our method achieves higher accuracy than\nbenchmark feature extraction.

As compared to feature extraction on real data, our approach has comparable overall test accuracy, and better accuracy within activities in the dynamic category. For the synthetic data, it achieved higher accuracy, indicating robustness to noise and the ability to classify data from new test subjects. This is an especially useful feature for real-life implementations of such classification algorithms, for instance on a smartphone app.\nFurthermore, the application of our approach extends beyond HAR, as long as the data set satisfies our definition of multi-dimensional time series.
