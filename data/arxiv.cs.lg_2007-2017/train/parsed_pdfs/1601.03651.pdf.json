      "text" : "Classifying relations between two entities in a given context is an important task in natural language processing (NLP). Take the following sentence as an example: “Jewelry and other smaller [valuables]e1 were locked in a [safe]e2 or a closet with a deadbolt.” The marked entities valuables and safe are of relation Content-Container(e1, e2). Relation classification plays a key role in various NLP applications, and has become a hot research topic in recent years.\nNowadays, neural network-based approaches have made significant improvement in relation clas-\n∗Equal contribution.\nsification, compared with traditional methods based on either human-designed features (Kambhatla, 2004; Hendrickx et al., 2009) or kernels (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Plank and Moschitti, 2013). Zeng et al. (2014) and Xu et al. (2015a), for example, utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for relation classification. Xu et al. (2015b) apply long short term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs) along the shortest dependency path. Nguyen and Grishman (2015) build model ensembles with gated recurrent unit (GRU)based RNNs and CNNs.\nWe have noticed that these neural models are all designed in shallow architectures, e.g., one layer of CNN or RNN, whereas evidence in the deep learning community suggests that deep architectures are more capable of information integration and abstraction (Graves et al., 2013; Hermans and Schrauwen, 2013; Irsoy and Cardie, 2014). A natural question is then whether such deep architectures are beneficial to the relation classification task.\nIn this paper, we propose deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) to classify relations. The deep RNN can explore the representation space in different levels of abstraction and granularity. By visualizing how RNN units are related to the ultimate classification, we demonstrate that different layers indeed learn different representations, and that high level layers are more capable of information integration. Following Xu et al. (2015b), we use the shortest dependency path (SDP) as the backbone of our deep RNNs (Figure 1a).\nWe further observe that the relationship between two entities are directed. Two sub-\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n03 65\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n4 Ja\nn 20\npaths, separated by entities’ common ancestor, can be mapped to subject-predicate and object-predicate components of a relation. By changing the order of these two sub-paths, we obtain a new data sample with the inversed relationship (Figure 1b). Such data augmentation technique further improves the performance without the need of leveraging additional data resources as in Xu et al. (2015a).\nWe evaluate our proposed method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task, and achieve a state-of-the-art F1-score of 85.81%.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work; Section 3 describes our DRNN model in detail. Section 4 presents experimental results. Finally, we have our conclusion in Section 5."

      "text" : "Traditional methods for relation classification mainly fall into two groups: feature-based or kernelbased. The former approaches extract different types of features and feed them into a classifier. Kambhatla (2004) uses a maximum entropy model for feature combination. Hendrickx et al. (2009) collect various features, including lexical, syntactic as well as semantic features. By contrast, kernel-based methods do not have explicit feature representations,\nbut require predefined similarity measure of two data samples. Bunescu and Mooney (2005) design a kernel along the shortest dependency path (SDP) between two entities by observing that the relation strongly relies on SDPs. Plank and Moschitti (2013) combine structural information and semantic information in a tree kernel.\nNowadays, neural networks are playing an important role in this task. Socher et al. (2011) design a recursive neural network along the constituency parse tree. Hashimoto et al. (2013), on the basis of recursive networks, emphasize more on important phrases to improve performance. Ebrahimi and Dou (2015) also use recursive networks, but their model is restricted to the SDP. Xu et al. (2015b) first introduce gated recurrent networks, in particular LSTM, to this task. Zeng et al. (2014), on the other hand, apply CNNs to relation classification. Along this line, dos Santos et al. (2015) replace the common softmax loss function with a ranking loss in their CNN model. Xu et al. (2015a) design a negative sampling method based on CNNs. From the viewpoint of model ensembling, Liu et al. (2015) combine CNNs and recursive networks along the SDP, while Nguyen and Grishman (2015) incorporate CNNs with RNNs."

Also, we take advantage of four information channels, namely, word embeddings, POS\n1We use the Stanford parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006).\nembeddings, grammatical relation embeddings, and WordNet embeddings.\nDifferent from Xu et al. (2015b), we design deep RNNs with up to four hidden layers. These layers are stacked in a hierarchical way so as to capture information in different levels of abstraction. For each RNN layer, max pooling gathers information from different recurrent nodes. Notice that the four channels (with eight sub-paths) are processed in a similar way. Then all pooling layers are concatenated and fed into a hidden layer for information integration. Finally, we have a softmax output layer for classification."

      "heading" : "3.2 Recurrent Neural Networks on Shortest Dependency Path",
      "text" : "In this subsection, we introduce a single layer of RNN based on SDP, serving as a building block of our deep architecture.\nCompared with a raw word sequence or a whole parse tree, the shortest dependency path (SDP) between two entities has two main advantages. First, it reduces irrelevant information; second, grammatical relations between words focus on the action and agents in a sentence, which is naturally suitable for\nrelation classification. Existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of SDP (Ebrahimi and Dou, 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015b; Xu et al., 2015a); details are not repeated here.\nConcentrated on the SDP, an RNN keeps a hidden state vector h, changing with the input word at each step accordingly. Conrectely, the hidden state ht, for the t-th word in the sub-path, depends on its previous state ht−1 and the current word’s embedding xt. For the simplicity and without loss of generality, we use vanilla recurrent networks with preceptron-like interaction, that is, the input is linearly transformed by a weight matrix and non-linearly squashed by an activation function, i.e.,\nht = f(Winxt +Wrecht−1 + bh) (1)\nwhere Win and Wrec are weight matrices for the input and recurrent connections, respectively. bh is a bias term, and f is a non-linear activation function (ReLU in our experiment)."

      "text" : "Although an RNN, as described above, is suitable for picking information along a sequence (a subpath\nin our task) by its iterative nature, the machine learning community suggests that deep architectures may be more capable of information integration, and can capture different levels of abstraction.\nA single-layer RNN can be viewed that it is deep along time steps. When unfolded, however, the RNN has only one hidden layer to capture the current input, as well as to retain the information in its previous step. In this sense, single-layer RNNs are actually shallow in information processing (Hermans and Schrauwen, 2013; Irsoy and Cardie, 2014).\nIn the relation classification task, words along SDPs provide information from difference perspectives. On the one hand, the marked entities themselves are informative. On the other hand, the entities’ common ancestor (typically verbs) tells how the two entities are related to each other. Such heterogeneous information might necessitate more complexity machinery than a single RNN layer.\nFollowing such intuition, we investigate deep RNNs by stacking multiple hidden layers on top of one another, that is, every layer of the deep RNNs treats its previous layer as input, and computes its activation similar to Equation 1. Formally, we have\nh (i) t = f(W (i−1) in h (i−1) t +W (i) rech (i) t−1\n+W (i−1) cross h (i−1) t−1 + b (i)) (2)\nwhere the subscripts refer to time steps, and superscripts indicate the number of layers. Note that, to enhance information propagation, we add a “cross” connection for hidden layers (i ≥ 2) from the lower layer in the previous time step, given by W (i−1) cross h (i−1) t−1 in Equation 2.

The SemEval-2010 relation classification dataset, we use, comprises only several thousand samples, which may not fully sustain the training of deep RNNs.\nTo mitigate this problem, we propose a data augmentation technique for relation classification by making use of the directionality of relationships.\nThe two sub-paths\n[valuables]e1 → jewelry→ locked\nlocked← in← closet← [safe]e2\nin Figure 1, for example, can be mapped to the subject-predicate and objectpredicate components in the relation Content-Container(e1, e2).

In this way, we can augment the dataset without using additional resources."

For a single data sample i, we apply the standard cross-entropy loss, denoted as J(slefti , s right i , ri).

The hidden layers in each channel had the same number of units as their embeddings (either 200 or 50); the penultimate hidden layer was 100-dimensional.

      "text" : "As mentioned in Section 4.1, the SemEval-2010 task 8 dataset contains an undirected class Other in addition to 9 directed relations (18 classes). For data augmentation, it is natural that the inversed Other relation is also in the Other class itself. However, if we augment all the relations, we observe a performance degradation of 0.4% (Table 2). We deem that the Other class contains mainly noise, and is inimical to our model. Then we conducted another experiment where we only augmented the Other class. The result verifies our conjecture as we obtained an even larger degradation of 0.8% in this setting.\nThe pilot experiments suggest that we should take into consideration unfavorable noise when performing data augmentation. In this experiment, if we reverse the directed relations only and leave the Other class intact, the performance is improved by a large margin of 1.7%. This shows that our proposed data augmentation technique does help to mitigate the problem of data sparseness, if we carefully rule out the impact of noise.\nDuring validation and testing, we shall decode the target label of an unseen data sample (with two entities e1 and e2). Through data augmentation, we are equipped with the probability of r−1(e2, e1) in addition to r(e1, e2). In our experiment, we tried several settings and chose to use r−1(e2, e1) only, because it yields the highest the validation result. We think this is probably because the Other class brings more noise to r than r−1, as the Other class is not augmented (and hence asymmetric).\nWe would like to point out that our data augmentation method is a general technique for relation classification, which is not ad hoc to a specific dataset; that the methodology for dealing with noise is also potentially applicable to other datasets."

      "heading" : "4.4 RNNs v.s. CNNs",
      "text" : "As both RNNs and CNNs are prevailing neural models for NLP, we are curious whether deep architecture is also beneficial to CNNs. We tried a CNN with a sliding window of size 3 like Xu et al. (2015a); other settings were as our DRNNs.\nThe result is shown in Table 3. We observe that a single layer of CNN is also effective, yielding an F1-score slightly worse than our RNN. But the deep architecture hurts the performance of CNNs in this task. We provide a plausible explanation as follows. When convolution is performed, the beginning and end of a sentence are typically padded with a special symbol or simply zero. However, the shortest dependency path between two entities is usually not very long (∼4 on average). Hence, sentence boundaries may play a large role in convolution, which makes CNNs vulnerable.\nOn the contrary, RNNs can deal with sentence boundaries smoothly, and the performance continues to increase with up to 4 hidden layers. Detailed analysis is deferred to Section 4.6."

Hendrickx et al.\n(2009) feed a variety of handcrafted features to the SVM classifier and achieve an F1-score of 82.2%.\nRecent performance improvements on this dataset are mostly achieved with the help of neural networks. Socher et al. (2012) build a recursive neural network on the constituency tree and achieve a comparable performance with Hendrickx et al. (2009). Further, they extend their recursive network with matrix-vector interaction and elevate the F1score to 82.4%. Ebrahimi and Dou (2015) restrict the network to SDP, which is slight better than a sentence-wide recursive network. Xu et al. (2015b) first introduce a type of gated recurrent neural network (LSTM) into this task and raise the F1-score to 83.7%.\nFrom the perspective of convolution, Zeng et al. (2014) construct a CNN on the word sequence; they also integrate word position embeddings, which help a lot on the CNN architecture. dos Santos et al. (2015) propose a similar CNN model, named CRCNN, by replacing the common softmax cost function with a ranking-based cost function. By diminishing the impact of the Other class, they have achieved an F1-score of 84.1%. Along the line of CNNs, Xu et al. (2015a) design a straighward negative sampling method, which introduces additional samples from other corpora like the NYT dataset. Doing so greatly improves the performance to a high F1-score of 85.6%. Besides, two representative hybrid models of neural networks are designed by Liu et al. (2015) and Nguyen and Grishman (2015).\nWithout the use of neural networks, Yu et al. (2014) propose a Feature-rich Compositional Embedding Model (FCM), which combines unlexicalized linguistic contexts and word embeddings. They achieve an F1-score of 83.0%.\nOur DRNNs model, along with data augmentation, achieves an F1-score of 85.8%. Without using additional data resources (Xu et al., 2015a), or ensembling methods (Nguyen and Grishman, 2015), we outperform previous state-of-the-art results. Even if we do not apply data augmentation, our DRNNs model yields 83.9% F1-score, which is also the highest score achieved by a single model trained on the dataset per se without dataset-specific denoising. The above results show the effectiveness of DRNNs, especially trained with a large (augmented) dataset."

      "heading" : "4.6 Analysis of DRNNs’ Depth",
      "text" : "In this subsection, we analyze the effect of depth in our DRNNs model. We have tested the depth from the set {1, 2, · · · , 5}, and plot the result in Figure 3. As we see, the performance is increasing from depth 2 to depth 4, and reaches the highest point on depth 4. The performance on depth 5 has a little degradation, but is still at a relatively close level. Considering efficiency and model complexity, we did not try deeper models (e.g. ≥ 6), and chose 4 in our experiment.\nBesides, we investigate how RNN units’ in different layers are related to the ultimate task of interest. This is accomplished by tracing back information from pooling layers. Noticing that the pooling layer takes maximum value in each dimension, we can compute how much a hidden layer’s units are gathered by pooling for further processing. In this way, we are able to demonstrate the information flow in RNN hidden units. We plot three examples in Figure 4. Here, rectangles refer to RNN hidden layers, unfolded along time. (Rounded rectangles are word embeddings.) The shade of color reflects the ratio of the pooling proportion. • Sample 1: “Until 1864 [vessels]e1 in the service\nof certain UK public offices defaced the Red Ensign with the [badge]e2 of their office” with label Instrument-Agency(e2, e1). Its two sub-paths of SDP are\n[vessels]e1 → until→ defaced defaced← with← [badge]e2\nFrom Figure 4a, we can see that entities like\nvessels and badge are darker than the verb phrase defaced with on the embedding layer. When information is propagating horizontally and vertically, these entities are getting lighter, while the verb phrase becomes darker gradually. Intuitively, we think that, considering relation Instrument-Agency(e2, e1), it is hard to make judgements only by two entities vessels and badge. When adding the semantic of verb phrase defaced with, we are more aware of the target relation. • Sample 2: “Most of the [verses]e1 of the planta-\ntion songs had some reference to [freedom]e2” with label Message-Topic(e1, e2). Its two sub-paths of SDP are\n[verses]e1 → of→ most→ had had← reference← to← [freedom]e2\nSimilar to Sample 1, we can see from Figure 4b that the color of the “pivot” verb had is getting darker vertically, and becomes the darkest in the fourth RNN layer, indicating the highest pooling portion. This is probably because had links two ends of the relation, Message and Topic. • Sample 3: “A more spare, less robust\nuse of classical [motifs]e1 is evident in a [ewer]e2 of 1784-85” with label Component-Whole(e1, e2). Its two sub-paths of SDP are\n[motifs]e1 → of→ use→ evident evident← in← [ewer]e2\nDifferent from Figures 4a and 4b, higher layers pay more attention on entities rather than their ancestors. Considering the ComponentWhole relation in this sample, we observe that the entities, motifs and ewer, are more infor-\nmative than the other words like use, in, and evident, which contain mostly irrelevant information. Therefore, the pooling proportion of entities (motifs, ewer) is increasing, while other words’ proportion is decreasing, as expected.\nWe summarize our findings as follows. (1) Pooled information typically peaks at one or a few words in the embedding layer. This makes sense because there is no information flow in this layer. (2) Information scatters over a wider range in hidden layers, showing that the recurrent propagation does mix information. (3) For a higher level layer, the network pays more attention on those words that are more relevant to the relation, either entities or the verb phrase, depending on the specific sentence."

The DRNNs model, consisting of several RNN layers, explores the representation space of different abstraction levels. By visualizing the DRNNs’ units, we demonstrated that high level layers are more capable of integrating information relevant to target relations. In addition, we have designed a data augmentation strategy by leveraging the directionality of relations.\nWhen evaluated on the SemEval dataset, our DRNNs model results in substantial performance boost. The F1-score generally improves as the depth increases, and reaches the highest point when the depth is 4. Our result also suggests potential future directions of neural network-based relation classification: building deep architectures as well as enriching datasets."

    "abstractText" : "Nowadays, neural networks play an important role in the task of relation classification. By designing different neural architectures, researchers have improved the performance to a large extent, compared with traditional methods. However, existing neural networks for relation classification are usually of shallow architectures (e.g., one-layer convolution neural networks or recurrent networks). They may fail to explore the potential representation space in different abstraction levels. In this paper, we propose deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) to tackle this challenge. Further, we propose a data augmentation method by leveraging the directionality of relations. We evaluate our DRNNs on the SemEval-2010 Task 8, and achieve an F1score of 85.81%, outperforming state-of-theart recorded results.",
