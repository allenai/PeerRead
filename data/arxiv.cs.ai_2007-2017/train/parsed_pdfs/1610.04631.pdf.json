INTRODUCTION\nResearchers and engineers nowadays have larger and larger data with very high dimension to be processed everyday [1]. For example, in image classification, a small image of size 100 × 100 will have 10, 000 dimension. In biology science, high-dimensional gene expression data is used to predict tumor [2]. However, there is always an underlying low-dimensional structure which can capture the underlying main attributes of high-dimensional data. What’s more, high-dimensional data costs a lot of computing resources. Dimensionality reduction algorithms have been proposed to extract important features from high-dimensional data.\nDimensionality reduction is important in many applications of statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning. Many methods have been proposed for dimensionality reduction, such as principal component analysis (PCA) [3] and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [4]. LDA is a popular supervised dimensionality reduction. To be specific, let X ∈ ℜp×n be the data matrix, and X = (x1, · · · ,xn),\nwhere p is data dimension, n is number of data points. Let G ∈ ℜp×k be the transformation matrix to a k-dimensional subspace. The between-class scatter matrix Sb, within-class scatter matrix Sw and total scatter matrix St is defined as:\nSb =\nK∑\nk=1\nnk(mk −m)(mk −m) T , (1)\nSw =\nK∑\nk=1\n∑\nxi∈k\n(xi −mk)(xi −mk) T , (2)\nSt = Sb + Sw, (3)\nwhere K is total class number, nk is number of points in class k, mk = ∑ xi∈k\nxi/nk is the mean of class k, m =∑n i=1 xi/n is the mean of entire data set. Sb, Sw and St are semi-positive definite matrices. Classical LDA finds a transformation matrix G by solving the problem:\nmax G\nTr GTSbG\nGTSwG . (4)\nWhen GTSwG = 0, i.e., there exist null space of Sw, the above formulation has some difficulty. In null space based LDA (NLDA) [5], the between-class distance is maximized in the null space of within-class scatter matrix Sw,\nmax G\nTr(GTSbG), s.t. G TSwG = 0, G TG = I (5)\nwhich is based on the idea that the null space of Sw contains sufficient discriminant information. The dimension of the null space of Sw is at least p−(n−K). When p ≤ (n−K), the null space of Sw may not exist. In the era of big data, we usually have sufficient amount of training data, so p is usually less than (n − K). Thus, NLDA is not applicable to many problems. What’s more, NLDA gives equal consideration to all between-class distances, which makes larger between-class distances could dominate the objective function and thus limits the performance of NLDA.\nIn this paper, we propose a harmonic mean based Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multi-Class Discriminant Analysis (MCDA), to overcome the limitations of NLDA. MCDA minimizes within-class distance and maximizes weighted pairwise between-class distance. More importantly, MCDA\ngives higher priority to maximize small pairwise betweenclass distance."

      "heading" : "II. LIMITATIONS OF NLDA",
      "text" : "NLDA has some limitations. Firstly, null space of withinclass scatter matrix Sw ∈ ℜp×p may not exist for many data sets, where p is data dimension. Rank of Sw is at most n−K , where n is sample number, K is class number. Thus the null space dimension of Sw is at least p−(n−K). When p ≤ (n−K), the null space of Sw may not exist.\nSecondly, NLDA gives equal consideration to all betweenclass distances, which makes larger between-class distances could dominate the objective function and thus limits the performance of NLDA. NLDA solves the problem of Eq.(5), which maximizes the distance between mk (the center of class k) and m (the center of all data). However, it gives equal consideration to all between-class distances. Figure 1 shows two solutions on a toy data. This toy data has 3 classes and each class contains 10 points. Figure 1a shows the NLDA solution, where GTSwG = 0, ensures the solution is in the null space of within-class scatter matrix Sw. Data points of the same class overlap with each other. The maximized sum of squared between-class distance Tr(GTSbG) = 0.6401. However, as we can see from the figure, even though the sum of squared between-class distance is maximized, class 1 and class 3 are not discriminated. Figure 1b gives a better solution, where all the 3 classes are separated evenly. Solution of Figure 1b is also in the null space of within-class scatter matrix Sw, but the sum of squared between-class distance Tr(GTSbG) = 0.4445, which is not maximized from the view of NLDA."

      "heading" : "III. A HARMONIC MEAN BETWEEN-CLASS DISTANCE OBJECTIVE",
      "text" : "As we can see from the demonstration in Figure 1, pairwise between-class distance plays an important role in the result. Figure 1b is a better solution than Figure 1a, because all 3 classes in the solution are clearly separated and no two classes are too close to each other. In order to achieve this goal, we introduce the use of pair-wise between-class\ndistance. To incorporate pairwise between-class distance into our objective, we define pairwise between-class scatter matrix Bk1k2 for class k1 and k2 as:\nBk1k2 = (mk1 −mk2)(mk1 −mk2) T . (6)\nWe wish to maximize the between class distances. Instead of the traditional approach of maxTr(GTSbG) in Eq.(5), we maximize all pairs of the pairwise between-class distance:\nmax G\nK−1∑\nk1=1\nK∑\nk2=k1+1\nnk1nk2Tr(G TBk1k2G), s.t. G TG = I\n(7)\nwhere nk1 is the number of points in class k1, nk2 is the number of points in class k2. The key point of this new approach is that Sb is a global summation, insensitive to individual class variations, but Bk1k2 is more sensitive to individual class variations.\nThe weight nk1nk2 controls the relative importance of between class distance between class k1 and k2. The reason why we use nk1nk2 is because the importance of separating two classes is based on the number of points in these two classes respectively.\nIn above approach, although Bk1k2 is more sensitive than Sb, the addition of all pairs, or the arithmetic mean of pairwise between-class distance, is not robust: one large between-class distances could dominate the objective function.\nIt is well-known that the harmonic mean is more robust than arithmetic mean. Thus, we propose to minimize the inverse of harmonic mean of pairwise between-class distance:\nmin G\nK−1∑\nk1=1\nK∑\nk2=k1+1\nnk1nk2 Tr(GTBk1k2G) s.t. GTG = I. (8)\nClearly, the difficult case is when two classes are close in feature space; In this case, their between-class distances is small. The objective of Eq.(8) gives higher weight to this pair of classes, therefore correctly emphasize is critical part of the discrimination task. In contrast, the objective of Eq.(7) gives small weight to this difficult pair, thus incorrectly deemphasize the critical part of the discrimination task. This is the key reason we propose the harmonic mean objective."

(11)\nIn order to enforce the constraint requirement GTG = I , we use SVD decomposition to make G orthonormal every few iterations. If we apply SVD in every iteration, it will be computational expensive. Thus, we can apply SVD every few iterations, which is on projection matrix G (subspace dimension is very small), and is very fast. Algorithm 1 summarizes the steps to solve Eq.(10). The objective is optimized in an iterative fashion. There is no need to do Eigen decomposition or matrix inverse for scatter matrices.\nWhen initializing matrix G, if subspace dimension k <= K−1, we can use classical LDA Eq.(4) solution to initialize G; when k > K − 1, we can use trace ratio LDA Eq.(12) solution to initialize G. This ensures that our approach can find a better solution than other LDA formulations (see experiments part for comparison).\nVI. ILLUSTRATION\nTo show the effectiveness of proposed MCDA, Figure 2 visualizes two real data sets, Caltech and MSRC, in 2-D subspace using PCA, LDA, null space LDA (NLDA) and MCDA. In this example, we take 4 classes from Caltech101 and MSRC, 30 data points in each class. We extract 432- dimensional HOG feature. Figure 2a and 2e show the Caltech and MSRC data projected in 2-D PCA subspace. As we can see, data points from 4 classes are mixed together. Figure 2b and 2f show the data projected in 2-D LDA subspace. Figure 2c and 2g shows the Caltech and MSRC data projected in 2-D NLDA subspace. Data points have been projected on 4 different data points, each of which includes 30 overlapped points, which is because the withinclass distance in this subspace is 0 now. However, class 1 and class 4 in both Figure 2c and 2g are still very close. This is due to the limitations of NLDA we discussed in Figure 1. By using MCDA proposed in Eq.(10), there are no two classes becoming too close in Figure 2d and 2h. MCDA takes weighted harmonic mean of pairwise betweenclass distance into account and gives higher priority to small between-class distances."

Using St = Sb + Sw, Eq.(12) is equivalent to maxG\nTr(GTSbG) Tr(GTSbG)+Tr(GTSwG) =\nmaxG 1\n1+Tr(GTSwG)/Tr(GTSbG) . Since Sb, Sw and St are\nall semi-positive definite, the maximum objective value can be achieved when Tr(GTSwG) = 0.

      "text" : "In image and video annotation, each image is usually associated with several different conceptual classes. Let’s take two sample images from MSRC data in Figure 4 as an example. Figure 4a is annotated using 3 words: sky, plane and grass; Figure 4b is annotated using 3 words: car, building, road. In machine learning, such problem that requires each data point to be assigned to multiple different classes\nis called multi-label classification problem. In contrast, in\ntraditional single-label classification, which is also called single-label multi-class classification, each data point is only classified into one category. Multi-label multi-class problem is more generalized than single-label multi-class problem.\nAn important difference between single-label classification and multi-label classification is that class memberships in single-label classification are mutually exclusive, while class memberships in multi-label classification are overlapped with 2 or more classes. Class memberships can be inferred from label correlations, which can be used to improve classification. It has stimulated many multi-label learning algorithms [9] [10] [11] [12].\nHowever, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) by nature is derived for single-label classification. Wang proposed a multi-label formulation of scatter matrices for multi-label data in [12]. Multi-label class indicator matrix Y ∈ ℜn×K is defined as\nYik =\n{ 1, if point i is in class k.\n0, otherwise. (13)\nFor data point i, ∑\nk Yik > 1, which means that data i belongs to more than 1 class. Multi-label between-class scatter matrix S̃b and within-class scatter matrix S̃w are\ndefined as follows [12]:\nS̃b =\nK∑\nk=1\n(\nn∑\ni=1\nYik)(mk −m)(mk −m) T , (14)\nS̃w =\nK∑\nk=1\nn∑\ni=1\nYik(xi −mk)(xi −mk) T , (15)\nwhere mk is the mean of class k and m is global mean, defined as follows:\nmk = ∑n i=1 Yikxi∑n i=1 Yik , m = ∑K k=1 ∑n i=1 Yikxi∑K\nk=1 ∑n i=1 Yik . (16)\nEq.(14,15) is also equivalent to Eq.(28, 29, 30) in [13]. Using Eq.(15) and Eq.(16), the objective of Multi-label MCDA is proposed as\nmin G\nγTr(GT S̃wG) + K−1∑\nk1=1\nK∑\nk2=k1+1\nnk1nk2\nTr(GT B̃k1k2G) , (17)\ns.t.

Trace ratio problem has been studied thoroughly in recent years. Many dimension reduction algorithms can be reduced to a trace ratio objective. But trace ratio problem does not have closed-form solution. Thus how to solve trace ratio efficiently becomes an interesting research topic. Wang [6] proposed an efficient iterative algorithm to get an approximate solution. Shen [34] proposed a formulation for solving the trace ratio problem directly. Nie proposed a Trace Ratio criteria for feature selection[35]. Each feature subset has a feature score, which is computed by trace ratio. They propose an iterative algorithm to find the global optimal feature subset. A number of LDA reformulation ideas have be proposed in recent years, such as PCA+LDA [36], regularized LDA(RLDA) [23], null space LDA (NLDA) [5], Orthogonal Centroid Method (OCM) [25], Uncorrelated LDA(ULDA)[24], Orthogonal LDA (OLDA)[24], etc. Ye introduced a unified framework for generalized LDA in [37]. The unified framework consists of four steps:\n1) Compute the eigenvalues {λi}di=1 and eigenvectors {ui} d i=1 of total covariance matrix St, where d is the\ndimension of data. So St = ∑d i=1 λiuiu T i .\n2) Given a transfer function φ: λ̃i = φ(λi).

Construct\nmatrix G using these q eigenvectors. 4) Optional: compute the QR decomposition of G = QR.\nThe final projection is given as G or Q. In RLDA, the transfer function is φ(λi) = λi + µ. In ULDA, φ(λi) = λi and the optional QR decomposition is not applied. In OLDA, φ(λi) = λi +µ and the optional QR decomposition is applied. In OCM, the optimal transformation is the top eigenvectors of Sb and the transfer function is φ(λi) = 1."

    "abstractText" : "Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a widelyused supervised dimensionality reduction method in computer vision and pattern recognition. In null space based LDA (NLDA), a well-known LDA extension, between-class distance is maximized in the null space of the within-class scatter matrix. However, there are some limitations in NLDA. Firstly, for many data sets, null space of within-class scatter matrix does not exist, thus NLDA is not applicable to those datasets. Secondly, NLDA uses arithmetic mean of between-class distances and gives equal consideration to all between-class distances, which makes larger between-class distances can dominate the result and thus limits the performance of NLDA. In this paper, we propose a harmonic mean based Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multi-Class Discriminant Analysis (MCDA), for image classification, which minimizes the reciprocal of weighted harmonic mean of pairwise between-class distance. More importantly, MCDA gives higher priority to maximize small between-class distances. MCDA can be extended to multi-label dimension reduction. Results on 7 single-label data sets and 4 multi-label data sets show that MCDA has consistently better performance than 10 other single-label approaches and 4 other multi-label approaches in terms of classification accuracy, macro and micro average F1 score.
