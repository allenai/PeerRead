      "text" : "Knowledge Bases (KBs) provide structured information about real world facts and have been used as crucial resources for various natural language processing (NLP) applications including Web search and question answering. Typical KBs such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) and YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) usually describe knowledge as multi-relational data and represent them as triple facts. As the real-world facts are increasing infinitely, existing KBs are far from complete. Recently, petabytes of natural-language\n∗Corresponding author: Z. Liu (liuzy@tsinghua.edu.cn).\ntext containing rich knowledge are readily available, which are important resources for automatically finding novel relational facts. Hence, relation extraction (RE), defined as the task of extracting structured information from plain text, has attracted much interest.\nHowever, supervised RE methods typically suffer from lacking large-scale annotated training data. Manual annotation is time consuming and labor intensive. To address this issue, one of the most promising solutions is distant supervision. (Mintz et al., 2009) automatically generates training data by aligning a KB with plain text. It assumes that, if two target entities have a relation in KB, each sentence that contains these two entities will express that relation, and can be regarded as a positive training instance.\nAlthough existing RE systems have achieved promising results with the help of distant supervision, they still suffer from one major drawback: the models can solely learn from those direct sentences containing both target entities. In fact, there are many indirect sentences containing one of the target entities, which also provide rich information for relation extraction. The basic idea is to build inference chains between two target entities using these sentences. For example, if we know that “h is the father of e” and “e is the father of t”, it will be easy to infer that h is the grandfather of t, with the help of the intermediate entity e.\nTo better utilize text information for relation extraction, we aim to leverage both direct and indirect sentences. We design a path-based method to combine the relational semantics from both direct sen-\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n07 47\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Se\np 20\ntences and inference chain. We also take advantages of neural models. Recently, neural models have been successfully applied to classify relations based on plain text (Socher et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2014; dos Santos et al., 2015). (Zeng et al., 2015) further proposes neural models with distant supervision for relation extraction, and achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Hence, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we propose a path-based neural relation extraction model: (1) We first employ convolutional neural network (CNN) to encode the relational semantics of each direct sentence. (2) We further build a path encoder to extract the relational semantics from multiple relation paths. (3) We finally integrate the information from both direct sentences and relation paths, and then predict the confidence of each relation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to utilize relation paths for relation extraction from texts.\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n• As compared to existing neural relation extraction models, our model is able to utilize the sentences of those containing both two target entities and only one target entity.\n• Using those sentences containing one of the target entities, our model is more robust and performs well even when the number of noisy instances increases."

      "text" : "Distant supervision for RE is proposed in (Craven et al., 1999). They apply this method in the domain of biology. Afterwards, (Mintz et al., 2009) aligns plain text with Freebase. However, most of these methods heuristically transform distant supervision to traditional supervised learning, simply regarding it as a single-instance single-label problem. To alleviate this issue, (Riedel et al., 2010) regards each sentence as a training instance and allows multiple instances to share the same label but disallows more than one label, namely a multi-instance single-label problem. Further, (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012) adopt multi-instance multi-label learning in relation extraction. The main drawback of these methods is that they obtain most features directly from NLP tools, and hence the errors generated by NLP tools will propagate and limit the performances of these methods.\nRecently, deep learning (Bengio, 2009) has been successfully applied in various areas, including computer vision, speech recognition and so on. Meanwhile, its effectiveness has also been verified in many NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis (dos Santos and Gatti, 2014), parsing (Socher et al., 2013), summarization (Rush et al., 2015) and machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014). With the advances of deep learning, there are growing works that design neural networks for relation extraction. (Socher et al., 2012) uses a recursive neural net-\nwork in relation extraction, and (Zeng et al., 2014; dos Santos et al., 2015) adopt CNNs for relation extraction. Although these methods achieve great successes in relation classification, they still rely on manually annotated training data since they regard relation extraction as a supervised learning problem. Hence, (Zeng et al., 2015) combines at-least-one multi-instance learning with neural network model to extract relations on distant supervision data. Further, (Lin et al., 2016) adopts a sentence-level selective attention mechanism to model distant supervised relation extraction. Although above RE models have achieved promising results, they merely learn from those sentences which contain both two target entities. The important information of the relation paths hidden in text is ignored.\nRelation paths have been taken into consideration for relation inference on large-scale KBs. Path Ranking algorithm (PRA) (Lao and Cohen, 2010) has been adopted for expert finding (Lao and Cohen, 2010) and information retrieval (Lao et al., 2012). PRA has also been used for relation classification based on KB structure (Lao et al., 2011; Gardner et al., 2013). (Neelakantan et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015) further learn recurrent neural networks to represent unseen relation paths based on all involved relations."

In this section, we will introduce our model in three parts: (1) Text Encoder. Given the sentence with two corresponding target entities, we use a CNN to embed the sentence into a semantic space, and measure the probability of relations given this sentence.

For each word wi, we use word embedding to encode its syntactic and semantic meanings, and use position embedding to encode its position information. We then concatenate both word embedding and position embedding to form the input vector of wi for CNN.\nWord Embeddings. Suppose V is the collection of all raw words, and we represent each word by a dw dimensional vector. Thus, the words are encoded by a word embedding matrix WE ∈ Rdw×|V |, where each column of WE is the representation of one word .\nPosition Embeddings. The order of words in a sentence is important for understanding that sentence. For instance, those words closer to the target entities are usually more informative for inferring that relation. We specify the position information via position embeddings, which embed the relative positions from current word to head and tail entities in two dp dimensional vectors respectively.\nIn the example shown in Fig. 2, the dimension\ndw of word embeddings is 4, and dimension dp of position embeddings is 1. After transforming all words into vectors, we obtain a sequence of vectors w = {w1,w2, · · · ,wl}, where l is the length of that sentence and wi ∈ Rd (d = dw + 2× dp)."

      "text" : "When processing a sentence, it is a great challenge that important information could probably appear in all parts of that sentence. In addition, the length l of a sentence could also vary a lot. Therefore, we apply CNN to encode all local features regardless sentence length. We first apply a convolution layer to extract all possible local features, and then select the most important one via max-pooling layer.\nTo extract local features, the convolution layer first concatenates a sequence of word embeddings within a sliding window to be vector qi of dimension k × d:\nqi = wi−k+1:i(1 ≤ i ≤ l + k − 1), (1)\nwhere k is the size of the window, and we also set all out-of-index words to be zero vectors. It then multiplies qi by a convolution matrix W ∈ Rdc×(k×d), where dc is the dimension of sentence embeddings. Hence, the output of convolution layer could be expressed as h = {h1,h2, · · · ,hl+k−1}:\nhi = Wqi + b, (2)\nwhere b is a bias vector. Finally, the max-pooling layer takes a max operation, followed by a hyperbolic tangent activation, over the sequence of hi to select the most important information, namely,\n[s]j = tanh(max i [hi]j). (3)\nIn fact, other neural RE models such as PCNN (Zeng et al., 2015), RNN (Socher et al., 2012), LSTM (Miwa and Bansal, 2016) can also be easily adopted as text encoder. Due to the space limit, in this paper we only explore the effectiveness of CNN."

More specifically, e could be calculated from:\ne = Us+ v, (5)\nwhere U ∈ Rnr×dc is the coefficient matrix of relations and v ∈ Rnr is a bias vector.\nWe use multi-instance learning to alleviate the wrong-labeling issue in distant supervision, choosing one sentence in the set of all direct sentences S = {s1, s2, · · · , sm} which corresponds to the entity pair (h, t). Similar to (Zeng et al., 2015), we define the score function of this entity pair and its corresponding relation r as in max-one setting:\nE(h, r, t|S) = max i p(r|θ, si).

      "heading" : "3.2 Relation Path Encoder",
      "text" : "We use relation path encoder to embed the inference information of relation paths. Relation path encoder measures the probability of relation r given a relation path in the text. This will utilize the inference chain structure to help making predictions. More specifically, we define a path p1 between (h, t) as {(h, e), (e, t)}, and the corresponding relations are rA, rB . Each of (h, e) and (e, t) corresponds to at least one sentence in the text. Our model calculates the probability of relation r conditioned on p1 as follows,\np(r|rA, rB) = exp(or)∑nr i=1 exp(oi) , (8)\nwhere oi measures how well relation r matches with the relation path (rA, rB). Inspired by work on relation path representation learning (Lin et al., 2015), our model first transforms relation r to its distributed\nrepresentation, i.e. vector r ∈ RdR , and builds the path embeddings by composition of relation embeddings. Then, the similarity oi is calculated as follows:\noi = −‖ri − (rA + rB)‖L1 . (9)\nTherefore, if ri gets more similar to (rA+rB), the conditioned predicting probability of ri will become larger. Finally, for this relation path pi : h\nrA−→ e rB−→ t, we define an relation-path score function,\nG(h, r, t|pi) = E(h, rA, e)E(e, rB, t)p(r|rA, rB), (10) whereE(h, rA, e) andE(e, rB, t) measure the probability of relational facts (h, rA, e) and (e, rB, t) from text, and p(r|rA, rB) measures the probability of relation r given relation path (rA, rB).\nHence, the inferring correlation between relation r and several sentence paths P is defined as,\nG(h, r, t|P ) = max i G(h, r, t|pi), (11)\nwhere we use max operation to filter out those noisy paths."

This term serves to depict the relative weight between direct sentences and relation paths, since we don’t need to pay much attention on extra information when CNN has already given a reliable result, namely E(h, r, t|S) is large.\nOne of the advantages of this joint model is to alleviate the issue of error propagation. The uncertainty of information from text encoder and path encoder is characterized by its confidence, and could be integrated and corrected in this joint model step.\nFurthermore, since we treat relation paths in a probabilistic way, our model could fully utilize all relation paths, i.e. those always hold and those likely to hold."

To solve this optimization problem, we use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to maximize our objective function. We first initialize WE with the results from Skip-gram model, and initialize other parameters randomly. Then, we iterate SGD by selecting a mini-batch from the training set, and stop learning when the model’s performance on validation set converges. In the testing mode, we include those relation paths in training set to enrich the path information.\nIn the implementation of CNN, we adopt dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) upon the output layer. For each element of the CNN output, we set it to zero with a pre-defined probability p. This dropout operation is proved to be effective in practice, especially to alleviate overfitting."

We build the dataset by aligning Wikidata1 relations with the\n1https://www.wikidata.org/\nNew York Times Corpus (NYT). Wikidata is a large, growing knowledge base, which contains more than 80 million triple facts and 20 million entities. We first sample a subset S from Wikidata by maintaining a subset of entities which also present in Freebase, and restricting relations according to their frequency. This results in 4,574,665 triplets with 1,045,385 entities and 99 relations.\nWe randomly split the subset of knowledge base into three sets including training, validation and testing sets. And then we connect them with NYT corpus by aligning the raw names of entities with those appear in text and following the assumption of distant supervision. To simulate noises in realworld datasets, we also add sentences corresponding to “No Relation” entity pairs to our dataset. To get those instances with “No Relation”, we first create a fake knowledge base S− by randomly replace the head entity or tail entity of triples, i.e., S− = {(h′, r, t)} ∪ {(h, r, t′)} and then aligning them with NYT corpus. The statistics of the datasets are listed in Table 1.\nFollowing previous work (Mintz et al., 2009), we evaluate our model using held-out evaluation which approximately measures the precision without timeconsuming manual evaluation.

They also enhance recall by 20% without decrease of precision. These results prove the effectiveness of our approach. (2) As the recall increases, our models exhibit larger improvements compared with CNN in terms of percentage. This is due to the fact that sometimes CNNs cannot extract reliable information from direct sentence, while our methods could alleviate this issue by considering more information from inference chains, and thus still maintain\nhigh precision. (3) Both CNN+max and Path+rand are variations of CNN+rand, aiming to alleviate the problem of noisy data. We see that Path+rand outperforms CNN+max over all range, which indicates that considering path information is a better way to solve this issue. Meanwhile, combining paths information and max operation gives the best performance, Path+max. (4) Path+rand shows a larger improvement over CNN+rand, compared with those of Path+max and CNN+max.

These features are sometimes fed to subsequent models to solve other tasks. In this experiment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the extracted features from our model. Since CNN-based models have already succeeded in extracting relations from single sentences, we set our experiment in a new scenario: predicting the relation between entities which have not appeared in the same sentence.\nA natural approach is to build an relation path between this zero-shot pair. We assume that we can make a prediction about (h, t), once we know the information of (h, e) and (e, t). Therefore, we build the training set by extracting all such relation paths and their sentences from training text, and similar for testing set. To test the effectiveness of features, we encode sentences by CNN+rand/max, Path+rand/max respectively, and then feed the concatenation of the sentence vector to a logistic classifier.\nFrom Table 3, we could observe that: (1) The result using CNN+rand features is comparable to the result using CNN+max features. It shows that using max operation to train the features does not greatly improve the features behavior in this task,\neven though it performs well in previous tasks. The reason is that, both CNN+rand and CNN+max only encode the information from a single sentence, and they are unable to capture the correlations between relations. (2) Feature from Path+rand/max shows its effectiveness over those from other methods. It indicates that our method is able to model the correlations between relations, while also keep the syntactic and semantic meaning of a sentence. Therefore, the features extracted from Path+rand/max are useful for a wider range of applications, especially in those tasks which need the information from relations."

However, using path#1 and path#2, we could easily infer that Rebecca and Issac are spouse. In the second example, the test sentence doesn’t show the relation either. But with the help of intermediate entity, Dijibouti, our model predicts that Somalia shares the border with Ethiopia.

To predict the relation between a pair of two target entities, existing methods solely rely on those direct sentences containing both entities. In fact, there are also many sentences containing only one of the target entities, which provide rich and useful information for relation extraction. To address this issue, we build inference chains between two target entities via intermediate entities, and propose a path-based neural relation extraction model to encode the relational semantics from both direct sentences and inference chains. Experimental results on realworld datasets show that, our model can make full use of those sentences containing only one target entity, and achieves significant and consistent improvements on relation extraction as compared with baselines.",
