      "text" : "The credit risk is one of the major risks that a loans institution has to manage. This risk arises when a borrower doesnŠt pay his debt in the fixed due. To face up this kind of risk, banks’ managers have to look for efficient solutions to well distinguish good from bad risk applicant. Credit scoring is one of the most successful financial risk management solutions developed for lending institutions, this solution has been fundamental in consumer credit management since Durand (1941). Authors like Feldman (1997), Thomas et al. (2002) and Saporta (2006) defined the Credit scoring as the process of determining how likely a particular applicant is default with reimbursement. Credit scoring methods are applied in order to classify possible creditors in two classes of risk: good and bad (Giudici, 2003). These methods use explanatory variables obtained from applicant information to estimate his intended performance to pay back loan. A large number ar X iv :1\n21 2.\n61 67\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 6\nof Transfer Learning Using Logistic Regression in Credit Scoring classification methods can be used in the process of identifying borrowersŠ behavior as decision trees (Breiman et al., 1984), neural networks (Mcculloch and Pitts, 1943), discriminant analysis (Fisher, 1936; Mahalanobis, 1936), logistic regression (Cox, 1970; Cox and Snell, 1989) . . .\nBoth these techniques can provide good discrimination but the most common used methods for building scorecard (i.e. credit models) are discriminant analysis and logistic regression. Logistic regression is a more appropriate technique for Credit scoring cases (Henley and Hand, 1996). Fan and Wang (1998) and Sautory et al. (1992) recommend the use of the binary logistic regression in Credit scoring cases, when discriminant analysis application conditions are not obtainable. This choice becomes imperative if qualitative variables get involved in the model (Bardos, 2001).\nAvailable information about credit candidate supplies a fundamental element in his credit request acceptation, information lack in credit risk valorization is suspected to lead to wrong decision making. In this paper, we will focus in Credit scoring evaluation, using logistic regression technique when the population of interest is characterized by a small size.\nBorrower’s behavior is described by a binary target variable denoted Y , value taken by this last one supplies a basic element in credits’ granting decision, Y = 0 when the borrower presents problem and Y = 1 otherwise. Beside this variable, every borrower is also described by a set of description variables (X1, X2, . . . , Xd) informing about the borrower and about his accounts’ functioning.\nThe sample of loans’ applicants results from a heterogeneous population formed by borrowers customers and others who are not. Here we deal with the problem of discrimination in the case of a subpopulations’ mixture, where the two subpopulations are respectively: borrowers’ customers and borrowers’ non customers. More precisely, we will focus in non customers subpopulation credit worthiness evaluation, assuming that sample size of this subpopulation is considered weak.\nBeginning with the hypothesis that population size is one of the most important factors affecting the classification power of the logistic regression technique, we evaluate future customers (i.e non customer) behavior to pay back loan, by looking for efficient solution to the problem of non customers small sample size.\nWe proceed to investigate how using the information on hand of borrowers customers and non customers can be efficient. The first approach, which is generally used by banks, consists in using the borrowers customers predictive model, to predict borrowers non customers behavior. However, it does not take into account, difference between the two subpopulations. Another approach consists in using a learning sample resulting from non customersŠ subpopulation to build their predictive model. However, this second approach needs a learning sample of a suitable size, which is not our case.\nChanging the second approach can bring an efficient solution to the problem of learning from small size sample. This change consists in using a design sample, drown from another population considered slightly different (e.g. customersŠ subpopulation), this sample will be used in models building in place of non customers design sample. The idea of using two slightly populations for estimating one population parameters, has been first proposed by Biernacki et al. (2002). In a multinomial context, Biernacki et al. (2002) proved that two slightly different populations are linked through linear relations. Estimation of nonlabeled sample\nallocation rules was obtained via estimating the linear relationship parameters, using five constraints models on the linear relationships. This approach proved to be efficient in biological context and many extension of this paper was proposed, including Biernacki and Jacques (2007), Bouveyron and Jacques (2009) as well as Beninel and Biernacki (2005, 2007, 2009). Beninel and Biernacki (2009) extended this approach to the multinomial logistic discrimination and proposed an additional links’ model in the case where the two studied subpopulation are two Gaussian ones. The main idea of this previous works is that information related to one of the two subpopulations contains some information related to the other one. The earlier works, have been the exit of the main thoughts of this paper, given previous results in the case of Gaussian mixture model and the six presented models by Beninel and Biernacki (2009), our task is then, to go in deep in the previous results with more testes and simulations, and to add to the former links’ models a seventh one."

Logistic regression model supplies a linear function of descriptors as discrimination tool, this technique is widely used in Credit scoring applications due to its simplicity and explainability. Model form is given by\nlog( pi\n1− pi ) = β0 + β\nTxi, (1)\nwhere – pi is the posteriori probability, defined as the probability that an individual i have the\nmodality 1 for given values taken by descriptors (i.e. P (Yi = 1|xi)). – xi = (x1i ,x 2 i , . . . ,x d i ) is the vector of observed value taking by description variables. – βT = (β1, β2, . . . , βd) is the vector of variables effect. – β0 is the intercept.\nThis technique serves to estimate the posteriori probability pi, which the value allows to assign every borrower to his group membership i.e., {Yi = 1} if pi is greater than a fixed threshold value and {Yi = 0} otherwise."

Our purpose is the prediction of the solvency of borrowers’ non customers using the information on hand of the two subpopulations.\nGiven two learning samples SA = {(xi, Yi) : i = 1, ..., n} and S∗A = {(x∗i , Y ∗i ) : i = 1, ..., n∗}, where the pairs (xi, Yi) and (x∗i , Y ∗i ) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) realizations of the random couples (x, Y ) and (x∗, Y ∗), we consider the logistic model over Ω, as given by\npi = P (Yi = 1|xi, θ) = expβ0+β\nTxi\n1 + expβ0+βTxi , (2)\nand over Ω∗\np∗i = P (Y ∗ i = 1|x∗i , θ∗) =\nexpβ ∗ 0+β ∗Tx∗i\n1 + expβ ∗ 0+β ∗Tx∗i , (3)\nwhere – θ = {(β0||βT ) ∈ Rd+1} and θ∗ = {(β∗0 ||β∗T ) ∈ Rd+1} are the sets of all parameters\nto be estimated respectively over Ω and Ω∗. – (β0||βT ) and (β∗0 ||β∗T ) are the concatenations of the intercept and the vector of vari-\nables effect over Ω and Ω∗. The mixture model allows the resolution of various discrimination problems, in our case we assume that an experienced rule, to predict on the first subpopulation Ω is known and we have a small learning sample from the second subpopulations Ω∗. From available data we want to get a new allocation rule over Ω∗. According to Beninel and Biernacki (2009) links between subpopulations could exist and consequently, information on Ω could provide some information on Ω∗. Existence of a link between variables vector implies a link between the two scores functions given in (2.2) and (2.2). Using acceptable links between the scores functions of the two subpopulations allows to use hidden information of samples S∗L and SL to get the allocations rules over Ω\n∗. We look in what follows for these links basing on results found in Gaussian case."

The use of customer subpopulation Ω data aims to moderate the small size of the subpopulation Ω∗ of non customers, by supposing the existence of hidden links between the distribution of variables over Ω and that over Ω∗. It’s known from Beninel and Biernacki (2007) as well as Bouveyron and Jacques (2009) that existence of particular connections between the variables distributions lead to relations between the parameters of their respective logistic regression models, consequently our task consists in finding these links. In this context a preliminary case study was successfully done in Gaussian multivariate case Beninel and Biernacki (2005). It is a question here of extending the found results in Gaussian case to logistic case, which leads to simple and parsimonious linking models between the parameters of logistic classification rules associated respectively to the two subpopulations Ω and Ω∗."

It is obvious from Table 3, that test error rate decreases proportionally to the learning sample size, this improvement can be\nModels M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 n = 50 0.394 0.321 0.284 0.285 0.291 0.301 0.376 n = 100 0.384 0.301 0.279 0.275 0.281 0.297 0.362 n = 150 0.384 0.281 0.230 0.233 0.253 0.275 0.316 n = 200 0.336 0.271 0.220 0.218 0.250 0.273 0.278\nTAB. 5 – Results summary for predictive credit Type I error with respect to the learning sample size\nsuitable to the estimate of models’ parameters which become more precise with the increase of the training data size. Tables 4 and 5, shows that Type II error and Type I proportionally decrease to the design sample size, these results prove the importance of the population size in classification.\nAs shown in Table 3, the test error rate of the two previous models achieved 0.308 which is the lowest rate of misclassified instances, according to this first criterion these models are the two best classification models. For the remaining models, we remark that models M5 and M6 also achieved good results, followed by model M2, the left behind two models generate the most raised test error rate, specially model M1 which appears the worst one.\nTest error rate, however measured, is only one aspect of performance, this criterion may not be the most precise one, further misclassification rate can be another aspect of performance, so each model is evaluated by assessing Type I and II error rate. We remind that the cut-off threshold used in this case study is 0.5 for this threshold, all the applicants whose estimated probability of non-reliability P (Y = 0) is less than 0.5 are assessed as non-reliable applicants, otherwise they are classified as reliable. In Table 4 model M1 and M7 achieved 0.185 and 0.203 error rate, which are the lowest Type II error rate, in other hand models M5 and M6, followed by M2 have the most raised rate, this kind of error arise when a reliable applicant is predicted as non-reliable. Models M5 and M6 are less efficient in the reliable applicants prediction.\nTable 5 summarize Type I error for the seven models. A Type I error means taking a nonreliable client and predicting him as reliable, this kind of error is more dangerous and more costly than the previous one, the model with the lowest rate of Type I error is considered as the best model. From Table 5 we remark that models M3 and M4 have the lowest rate of Type I error, followed by models M5, M6 and M2, in other hand models M1 and M7 have the most raised Type I error rate, It seems that these two previous models have greater difficulty in predicting non-reliable clients than reliable ones.\nThe previous misclassification rates are obtained when the cut-off is 0.5, however changing this threshold might modify the previous results and can allow decider to catch a greater number of good or bad applicants. Hand Hand (2001) in his work proposed the use of graphical tools as evaluation criterion, in place of scalar criterion. We use in this paper the ROC (i.e. receiver operating characteristic) curve to evaluate our seven models, the ROC curve shows how the errors change when the threshold varies, this kind of curve situate positives instances against the negatives instances which allow finding the middle ground between specificity and sensitivity. Figure 2 shows the ROC curve of our models. The X axis of the curve represents models’\n1 − specificity (i.e. Type II error rate) and the Y axis represents models’ sensitivity (i.e. 1−Type I error rate). According to Liu and Schumann Liu and Schumann (2002) a model with a ROC curve, which follows the 45◦ line would be useless. It would classify the same proportion of not worthy applicants and worthy cases into the not worthy class at each value of the threshold. Figure 2 shows that the seven models are convexes and situated over the first bisector, which lead us to affirm that our models are statistically approved and not useless. In Figure 2 we remark that models M3 and M4 curves appears considerably higher to the other models’ curves which confirms our intuition about their performance, models M1, M7 and M2 has the lowest AUC (i.e. air under curve), from the balance between false positive and false negative point of view these models are bad.\nThe evoked performance measures in this section, served to evaluate the validity and the discriminant power of the studied models. From the previous results, we remark that the most banks’ practiced model M1 seem the least successful model once applied to non customers borrowers’ data, this confirms the difference between the two studied subpopulations. We also remark that models M5 and M6 might be a good classifier. However, models M3 and M4 seems to be the more suitable models for the prediction of non customers behavior to pay back loan. These last one are the best predictive models because their constant is calculated from the non customers learning sample independently of customers sample, what supposes their importance in the reliability prediction of the target variable kredit and confirm the existence of a certain link between the two subpopulation Ω and Ω∗. Model M5 possesses the most raised rate of Type II error, this model is considered as careful but its use can lead to a loss of reliable borrowers.\nTo be sure of our models performance, we compare in what follows the performance of the models M3 and M4 with two successful classification techniques:\n– SVM (Vapnik, 1995) is one of the most outstanding machine learning techniques. The use of SVM in financial application has been previously discussed by several works (Schebesch and Stecking, 2005; Min and Lee, 2005; Huang et al., 2007; Wang, 2008; Bellotti and Crook, 2009). There many raisons for choosing SVM (Burges, 1998), it requires less prior assumptions about the input data and can perform on small or huge data set by doing a nonlinear mapping from an original input space into a high dimensional"

We proposed seven simple logistic submodels combining the classification rule on customers subpopulation and the labeled sample from the non customers subpopulation. A comparison of the seven models performance was done and the models M3 andM4 was selected as the best classification model for the non customers subpopulation, this two models beat the performance of traditional classification model M1. This research would have been able to generate more interesting results if we were able to have a non customers’ sample of bigger size. We envisage as perspective, to apply logistic regression using non-linear links between the two subpopulations. We also can apply a nonparametric approach which can seem efficient once the linear models find their limits."

A Type I error means taking a nonreliable client and predicting him as reliable, this kind of error is more dangerous and more costly than the previous one, the model with the lowest rate of Type I error is considered as the best model. From Table 5 we remark that models M3 and M4 have the lowest rate of Type I error, followed by models M5, M6 and M2, in other hand models M1 and M7 have the most raised Type I error rate, It seems that these two previous models have greater difficulty in predicting non-reliable clients than reliable ones.

    "abstractText" : "The credit scoring risk management is a fast growing field due to consumer’s credit requests. Credit requests, of new and existing customers, are often evaluated by classical discrimination rules based on customers information. However, these kinds of strategies have serious limits and don’t take into account the characteristics difference between current customers and the future ones. The aim of this paper is to measure credit worthiness for non customers borrowers and to model potential risk given a heterogeneous population formed by borrowers customers of the bank and others who are not. We hold on previous works done in generalized gaussian discrimination and transpose them into the logistic model to bring out efficient discrimination rules for non customers’ subpopulation. Therefore we obtain several simple models of connection between parameters of both logistic models associated respectively to the two subpopulations. The German credit data set is selected to experiment and to compare these models. Experimental results show that the use of links between the two subpopulations improve the classification accuracy for the new loan applicants.",
