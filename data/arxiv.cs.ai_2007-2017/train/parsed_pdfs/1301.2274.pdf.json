    "abstractText" : "In previous work [8] we presented a case­ based approach to eliciting and reasoning with preferences. A key issue in this ap­ proach is the definition of similarity between user preferences. We introduced the prob­ abilistic distance as a measure of similarity on user preferences, and provided an algo­ rithm to compute the distance between two partially specified value functions. This is for the case of decision making under certainty. In this paper we address the more challenging issue of computing the probabilistic distance in the case of decision making under uncer­ tainty. We present algorithms to compute the probabilistic distance between two com­ pletely or partially specified utility functions. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm with a medical data set of partially specified patient preferences, where none of the other existing distance measures appear definable. Using this data set, we also demonstrate that the case-based approach to preference elici­ tation is applicable in domains with uncer­ tainty.",
