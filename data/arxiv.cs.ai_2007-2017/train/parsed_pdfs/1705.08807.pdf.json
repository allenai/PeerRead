      "text" : "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will have massive social consequences. Self-driving technology might replace millions of driving jobs over the coming decade. In addition to possible unemployment, the transition will bring new challenges, such as rebuilding infrastructure, protecting vehicle cyber-security, and adapting laws and regulations [5]. New challenges, both for AI developers and policy-makers, will also arise from applications in law enforcement, military technology, and marketing [6]. To prepare for these challenges, accurate forecasting of transformative AI would be invaluable.\nSeveral sources provide objective evidence about future AI advances: trends in computing hardware [7], task performance [8], and the automation of labor [9]. The predictions of AI experts provide crucial additional information. We survey a larger and more representative sample of AI experts than any study to date [10, 11]. Our questions cover the timing of AI advances (including both practical applications of AI and the automation of various human jobs), as well as the social and ethical impacts of AI."

      "text" : "Our survey population was all researchers who published at the 2015 NIPS and ICML conferences (two of the premier venues for peer-reviewed research in machine learning). A total of 352 researchers responded to our survey invitation (21% of the 1634 authors we contacted). Our questions concerned the timing of specific AI capabilities (e.g. folding laundry, language translation), superiority at specific occupations (e.g. truck driver, surgeon), superiority over humans at all tasks, and the social impacts of advanced AI. See Survey Content for details."

      "text" : "AI would have profound social consequences if all tasks were more cost effectively accomplished by machines. Our survey used the following definition:\n“High-level machine intelligence” (HLMI) is achieved when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers.\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n08 80\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 4\nM ay\n2 01\n7\nEach individual respondent estimated the probability of HLMI arriving in future years. Taking the mean over each individual, the aggregate forecast gave a 50% chance of HLMI occurring within 45 years and a 10% chance of it occurring within 9 years. Figure 1 displays the probabilistic predictions for a random subset of individuals, as well as the mean predictions. There is large inter-subject variation: Figure 3 shows that Asian respondents expect HLMI in 30 years, whereas North Americans expect it in 74 years.\nWhile most participants were asked about HLMI, a subset were asked a logically similar question that emphasized consequences for employment. The question defined full automation of labor as:\nwhen all occupations are fully automatable. That is, when for any occupation, machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers.\nForecasts for full automation of labor were much later than for HLMI: the mean of the individual beliefs assigned a 50% probability in 122 years from now and a 10% probability in 20 years.\nRespondents were also asked when 32 “milestones” for AI would become feasible. The full descriptions of the milestone are in Table S5. Each milestone was considered by a random subset of respondents (n≥24). Respondents expected (mean probability of 50%) 20 of the 32 AI milestones to be reached within ten years. Fig. 2 displays timelines for a subset of milestones."

      "text" : "The prospect of advances in AI raises important questions. Will progress in AI become explosively fast once AI research and development itself can be automated? How will high-level machine intelligence (HLMI) affect economic growth? What are the chances this will lead to extreme outcomes (either positive or negative)? What should be done to help ensure AI progress is beneficial? Table\nS4 displays results for questions we asked on these topics. Here are some key findings:\n1. Researchers believe the field of machine learning has accelerated in recent years. We asked researchers whether the rate of progress in machine learning was faster in the first or second half of their career. Sixty-seven percent (67%) said progress was faster in the second half of their career and only 10% said progress was faster in the first half. The median career length among respondents was 6 years.\n2. Explosive progress in AI after HLMI is seen as possible but improbable. Some authors have argued that once HLMI is achieved, AI systems will quickly become vastly superior to humans in all tasks [3, 12]. This acceleration has been called the “intelligence explosion.” We asked respondents for the probability that AI would perform vastly better than humans in all tasks two years after HLMI is achieved. The median probability was 10% (interquartile range: 1-25%). We also asked respondents for the probability of explosive global technological improvement two years after HLMI. Here the median probability was 20% (interquartile range 5-50%).\n3. HLMI is seen as likely to have positive outcomes but catastrophic risks are possible. Respondents were asked whether HLMI would have a positive or negative impact on humanity over the long run. They assigned probabilities to outcomes on a five-point scale. The median probability was 25% for a “good” outcome and 20% for an “extremely good” outcome. By contrast, the probability was 10% for a bad outcome and 5% for an outcome described as “Extremely Bad (e.g., human extinction).”\n4. Society should prioritize research aimed at minimizing the potential risks of AI. Forty-eight percent of respondents think that research on minimizing the risks of AI should be prioritized by society more than the status quo (with only 12% wishing for less).\nAsians expect HLMI 44 years before North Americans Figure 3 shows big differences between individual respondents in when they predict HLMI will arrive. Both citation count and seniority were not predictive of HLMI timelines (see Fig. S1 and the results of a regression in Table S2). However, respondents from different regions had striking differences in HLMI predictions. Fig. 3 shows an aggregate prediction for HLMI of 30 years for Asian respondents and 74 years for North Americans. Fig. S1 displays a similar gap between the two countries with the most respondents in the survey: China (median 28 years) and USA (median 76 years). Similarly, the aggregate year for a 50% probability for automation of each job we asked about (including truck driver and surgeon) was predicted to be earlier by Asians than by North Americans (Table S2). Note that we used respondents’ undergraduate institution as a proxy for country of origin and that many Asian respondents now study or work outside Asia."

      "heading" : "Was our sample representative?",
      "text" : "One concern with any kind of survey is non-response bias; in particular, researchers with strong views may be more likely to fill out a survey. We tried to mitigate this effect by making the survey short (12 minutes) and confidential, and by not mentioning the survey’s content or goals in our invitation email. Our response rate was 21%. To investigate possible non-response bias, we collected demographic data for both our respondents (n=406) and a random sample (n=399) of NIPS/ICML researchers who did not respond. Results are shown in Table S3. Differences between the groups in citation count, seniority, gender, and country of origin are small. While we cannot rule out non-response biases due to unmeasured variables, we can rule out large bias due to the demographic variables we measured. Our demographic data also shows that our respondents included many highly-cited researchers (mostly in machine learning but also in statistics, computer science theory, and neuroscience) and came from 43 countries (vs. a total of 52 for everyone we sampled). A majority work in academia (82%), while 21% work in industry."

      "text" : "Why think AI experts have any ability to foresee AI progress? In the domain of political science, a long-term study found that experts were worse than crude statistical extrapolations at predicting political outcomes [13]. AI progress, which relies on scientific breakthroughs, may appear intrinsically harder to predict. Yet there are reasons for optimism. While individual breakthroughs are unpredictable, longer term progress in R&D for many domains (including computer hardware, genomics, solar energy) has been impressively regular [14]. Such regularity is also displayed by trends [8] in AI performance in SAT problem solving, games-playing, and computer vision and could be exploited by AI experts in their predictions. Finally, it is well established that aggregating individual predictions can lead to big improvements over the predictions of a random individual [15]. Further work could use our data to make optimized forecasts. Moreover, many of the AI milestones (Fig. 2) were forecast to be achieved in the next decade, providing ground-truth evidence about the reliability of individual experts."

      "heading" : "Survey Content",
      "text" : "We developed questions through a series of interviews with Machine Learning researchers. Our survey questions were as follows:\n1. Three sets of questions eliciting HLMI predictions by different framings: asking directly about HLMI, asking about the automatability of all human occupations, and asking about recent progress in AI from which we might extrapolate.\n2. Three questions about the probability of an “intelligence explosion”.\n3. One question about the welfare implications of HLMI.\n4. A set of questions about the effect of different inputs on the rate of AI research (e.g., hardware progress).\n5. Two questions about sources of disagreement about AI timelines and “AI Safety.”\n6. Thirty-two questions about when AI will achieve narrow “milestones”.\n7. Two sets of questions on AI Safety research: one about AI systems with non-aligned goals, and one on the prioritization of Safety research in general.\n8. A set of demographic questions, including ones about how much thought respondents have given to these topics in the past. The questions were asked via an online Qualtrics survey. (The Qualtrics file will be shared to enable replication.) Participants were invited by email and were offered a financial reward for completing the survey. Questions were asked in roughly the order above and respondents received a randomized subset of questions. Surveys were completed between May 3rd 2016 and June 28th 2016.\nOur goal in defining “high-level machine intelligence” (HLMI) was to capture the widely-discussed notions of “human-level AI” or “general AI” (which contrasts with “narrow AI”) [3]. We consulted all previous surveys of AI experts and based our definition on that of an earlier survey [11]. Their definition of HLMI was a machine that “can carry out most human professions at least as well as a typical human.” Our definition is more demanding and requires machines to be better at all tasks than humans (while also being more cost-effective). Since earlier surveys often use less demanding notions of HLMI, they should (all other things being equal) predict earlier arrival for HLMI.\nDemographic Information The demographic information on respondents and non-respondents (Table S3) was collected from public sources, such as academic websites, LinkedIn profiles, and Google Scholar profiles. Citation count and seniority (i.e. numbers of years since the start of PhD) were collected in February 2017."

      "text" : "Many of our questions ask when an event will happen. For prediction tasks, ideal Bayesian agents provide a cumulative distribution function (CDF) from time to the cumulative probability of the event. When eliciting points on respondents’ CDFs, we framed questions in two different ways, which we call “fixed-probability” and “fixed-years”. Fixed-probability questions ask by which year an event has an p% cumulative probability (for p=10%, 50%, 90%). Fixed-year questions ask for the cumulative probability of the event by year y (for y=10, 25, 50). The former framing was used in recent surveys of HLMI timelines; the latter framing is used in the psychological literature on forecasting [16, 17]. With a limited question budget, the two framings will sample different points on the CDF; otherwise, they are logically equivalent. Yet our survey respondents do not treat them as logically equivalent. We observed effects of question framing in all our prediction questions, as well as in pilot studies. Differences in these two framings have previously been documented in the forecasting literature [16, 17] but there is no clear guidance on which framing leads to more accurate predictions. Thus we simply average over the two framings when computing CDF estimates for HLMI and for tasks. HLMI predictions for each framing are shown in Fig. S2."

Reported medians and quantiles were computed on this summary distribution. The confidence intervals were generated by bootstrapping (clustering on respondents with 10,000 draws) and plotting the 95% interval for estimated probabilities at each year. The time-in-field and citations comparisons between respondents and non-respondents (Table S3) were done using two-tailed t-tests. The region and gender proportions were done using twosided proportion tests. The significance test for the effect of region on HLMI date (Table S2) was done using robust linear regression using the R function rlm from the MASS package to do the regression and then the f.robtest function from the sfsmisc package to do a robust F-test significance."

Examples of open ended questions:\n• “What does it mean if my lights dim when I turn on the microwave?”\n• “When does home insurance cover roof replacement?\"\n38 9.8\nAnswer Questions Without Definite Answers Give good answers in natural language to factual questions posed in natural language for which there are no definite correct answers. For example: “What causes the demographic transition?”, “Is the thylacine extinct?”, “How safe is seeing a chiropractor?” 47 10 High School Essay Write an essay for a highschool history class that would receive high grades and pass plagiarism detectors. For example answer a question like “How did the whaling industry affect the industrial revolution?” 42 X 9.6 Generate Top 40 Pop Song Compose a song that is good enough to reach the US Top 40. The system should output the complete song as an audio file. 38 X 11.4 Produce a Song Indistinguishable from One by a Specific Artist\nProduce a song that is indistinguishable from a new song by a particular artist, e.g., a song that experienced listeners can’t distinguish from a new song by Taylor Swift. 41 10.8\nWrite New York Times BestSeller Write a novel or short story good enough to make it to the New York Times best-seller list. 27 X 33 Explain Own Actions in Games\nFor any computer game that can be played well by a machine, explain the machine’s choice of moves in a way that feels concise and complete to a layman. 38 X 10.2\nWorld Series of Poker Play poker well enough to win the World Series of Poker. 37 X 3.6 Output Physical Laws of Virtual World\nAfter spending time in a virtual world, output the differential equations governing that world in symbolic form. For example, the agent is placed in a game engine where Newtonian mechanics holds exactly and the agent is then able to conduct experiments with a ball and output Newton’s laws of motion. 52 14.8"

    "abstractText" : "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will transform modern life by reshaping transportation, health, science, finance, and the military [1, 2, 3]. To adapt public policy, we need to better anticipate these advances [4, 5]. Here we report the results from a large survey of machine learning researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI. Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting these dates much sooner than North Americans. These results will inform discussion amongst researchers and policymakers about anticipating and managing trends in AI.",
