      "text" : "ar X\niv :1\n41 1.\n16 29\nv2 [\ncs .A\nI] 1\nIn this position paper, I argue that standardized tests for elementary science such as SAT or Regents tests are not very good benchmarks for measuring the progress of artificial intelligence systems in understanding basic science. The primary problem is that these tests are designed to test aspects of knowledge and ability that are challenging for people; the aspects that are challenging for AI systems are very different. In particular, standardized tests do not test knowledge that is obvious for people; none of this knowledge can be assumed in AI systems. Individual standardized tests also have specific features that are not necessarily appropriate for an AI benchmark. I analyze the Physics subject SAT in some detail and the New York State Regents Science test more briefly. I also argue that the apparent advantages offered by using standardized tests are mostly either minor or illusory. The one major real advantage is that the significance is easily explained to the public; but I argue that even this is a somewhat mixed blessing. I conclude by arguing that, first, more appropriate collections of exam style problems could be assembled, and second, that there are better kinds of benchmarks than exam-style problems. In an appendix I present a collection of sample exam-style problems that test kinds of knowledge missing from the standardized tests.\nIt has often been proposed that a standardized tests constitute useful goals for AI systems doing automated scientific reasoning and informative benchmarks for progress. For example Brachman et al. (2005) suggest developing a program that can pass the SATs. Clark, Harrison, and Balasubramanian (2013) propose a project of passing the New York State Regents Science Test for 4th graders. Strickland (2013) proposes developing an AI that can pass the entrance exams for the University of Tokyo. Ohlsson et al. (2013) evaluated the performance ConceptNet system (Havasi, Speer, and Alonso 2007) on a preprocessed form of the Wechesler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence test. Barker et al. (2004) describes the construction of a knowledge-based system that (more or less) scored a 3 (passing) on two section of the high school chemistry Advanced Placement test.\nIn this position paper, I want to discuss specifically the project of developing AI programs to pass standardized science tests, as a step toward developing AI programs with powerful abilities to reason about science; and I will argue that focusing narrowly on this goal is not the best way of advancing AI understanding of basic science, and that this benchmark is not the best way of measuring progress.\nThe dangers of focusing on too narrow and idiosyncratic a target are well illustrated by Watson. IBM set itself the goal of winning at Jeopardy, and with huge labors, in an extraordinary tour de force, succeeded. However, it is not at all clear what contribution this has made to AI technology;\nand it seems to have made no contribution whatever to AI theory. Having succeeded on Jeopardy, IBM is making a huge effort to adapt it to other applications; what has been published to date on this effort is not particularly impressive.\n(Since I have been involved in the Winograd Schema Challenge (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2012), let me parenthetically clarify a related point there. The Winograd Schema Challenge is intended as a challenge; eventually, if natural language abilities and the inference mechanisms they require advance sufficiently, some program will pass it. But there is no point in working on the Winograd Schema Challenge. Winograd schemas are not a subject matter; they are not even a natural category. They are a collection of coreference resolution problems, designed to be difficult, that conform to a very specific structure in order to make sure that they are not easily solved by statistical techniques over surface features. The relevant field to work on is natural language understanding generally or disambiguation specifically.)\nCertainly, a standardized science test is a more meaningful and useful goal for AI than Jeopardy. The questions that make up these tests involve much more fundamental knowledge and much deeper forms of reasoning than the trivia about actors, geography, and so on that make up Jeopardy. So I would certainly expect that an effort to pass a standardized science test would be very much more fruitful for AI than Watson, except, of course, in terms of publicity. The problems cannot be solved using statistics over surface features. Solving them will almost certainly require major advances in knowledge representation, reasoning, and diagram interpretation and significant advances in natural language interpretation. Indeed Barker et al. (2004) were able to draw some interesting and fruitful conclusions for knowledge representation and knowledge engineering from their project aimed at passing the chemistry AP test. Nonetheless, I will argue that, if we focus our research too narrowly on passing standardized tests, we will miss critical fundamental issues that will come back to bite us later; and that if we make too much of these tests as benchmarks, it will not be helpful to the field in the long run. I think there are much better ways to formulate goals and benchmarks."

      "heading" : "1 Testing science that any fool knows",
      "text" : "Standardized tests were written as tests for human students, and therefore emphasize aspects of the subject that human students find difficult. In humans, successful mastery of these aspects reasonably reliably indicates mastery of the subject matter. In many case, however, what is difficult for humans is easy for AI systems, and vice versa; so mastery of these subjects by an AI system does not at all indicate mastery of the subject matter.\nIn particular, standardized tests generally omit aspects of the subject that “any [human] fool knows” because these are not worth testing. But of course, the computer does not necessarily know them. Nor can it be assumed that progress in encoding formal science will necessarily bring with it this basic knowledge. One can easily envision an AI program that knows and can manipulate the equations of general relativity and quantum electrodynamics, but has no idea how things work in the ordinary world. The kind of knowledge I have in mind are things like\n• You can’t fit a watermelon into a sandwich bag. Moreover, you can’t make the watermelon fit by folding it. However, you could cut off a piece that will fit in the sandwich bag.\n• You can’t see anything if your eyes are closed. You can’t see anything if there is no light. You can feel things even if there is no light.\n• If it’s warm in your room and cold outside, and you open the window, the room will get colder.\nMany more examples are given in appendix A.1.\nThe importance of having general knowledge that “any fool knows” does not generally diminish as the sophistication of the science involved increases, except in some cases where the entire subject matter become so recondite that there is only a remote connection to anything within the scope of ordinary knowledge. This is particularly true in reasoning about scientific experiments. For example, understanding a chemical experiment with test tubes and beakers requires basic knowledge about containers and liquids — you can pour liquid from the test tube into the beaker, and so on — which is nowhere explicit in the chemistry textbook, and may not be tested even implicitly on the chemistry SATs. Certainly it is unlikely that non-standard variants of these — e.g. if I hold the test tube upside down over the table, the contents will spill out — are tested implicitly on the SATs.\nOne might argue that this kind of knowledge will needed as background in order to answer the questions that arise on the standardized tests; and therefore a project to pass the standardized tests will necessarily address this kind of knowledge. As far as I can judge from my examination of the standardized tests, this is not the case; a program could pass standardized tests with very little of this basic knowledge. On the other hand, for scientific understanding generally, this basic knowledge is critical. In separate unpublished projects I have analyzed some of the commonsense reasoning needed to understand short passages from a biology textbook and from a description of a high-school chemistry experiment; these basic issues arise constantly."

      "heading" : "2 Gaps in specific standardized tests",
      "text" : "The gap discussed in section 1, of questions aimed at very basic knowledge, is presumably common to all standardized tests except possibly tests addressed to cognitive impairment. There is no point in asking questions that all test takers will get right. Beyond that, though, each standardized test has its own gaps, from the point of view of an AI benchmark, reflecting primarily the fact that the test was not written with the objective of serving as an AI benchmark. Here, of course, one has to consider each test individually; different tests have different strengths and weaknesses. In general, if an AI researcher wants to use a particular test as a benchmark, she should examine it carefully to determine which of the aims of her research are met by the test and which are not. I have examined and will discuss below two particular tests: the SAT subject test in Physics, and the New York State Regents’ 4th grade Science test.\nFirst a general caveat: In the world of education, there is a great deal of expertise on these standardized tests, which I do not share; and there is an immense, often rancorous, literature on the strengths, weaknesses, biases and so on of these tests, which I have not read. (Not the least of my reservations about using these tests as benchmarks is the danger that the AI community will be seen as taking one side or another in these debates; or, conversely, that the politics of these debates will distort the analysis in the AI community.) However, all of this literature addresses the question of the merits of these tests in educating humans, not their merits as AI benchmarks. I do not want to touch the question of educating and testing people with a ten-foot pole. None of my analysis below should in any way be viewed as expressing an opinion on the merits of the tests in the educational system, except for the opinion, I hope uncontroversial, that it is best to avoid wrongly-posed questions even in the human setting."

      "heading" : "2.1 The SAT Subject test in Physics",
      "text" : "Since the actual tests are not available (more about this in section 3), I have used as a proxy Sample Test 1 in (Kaplan, 2014 pp. 291-305) on the presumption that the Kaplan people know what they’re doing. I have analyzed the 75 questions on this test along 5 dimensions: Type of problem, mode of mathematical calculation, physical domain, type of geometry involved, and use of real-world\nTypes of problems: Prediction (34). Calculate/compare numeric features (10). Graph reading/manipulation (7). Identify physical law (5). Diagnosis (5). Identify process (4). Planning (2). Taxonomy (2). Terminology (2). Other (4).\nMode of calculation Arithmetic (13). Comparative analysis/Sign calculus (8). Symbolic algebra (5). Qualitative behavior of functions presented graphically (5). Identify geometric feature matching physical law (3). Trivial symbolic algebra (3). Add curves presented graphically (2). Other (8). No calculations involved (28).\nThree of the problems listed above under “Symbolic algebra” can be solved by dimensional analysis and the process of elimination, and one can be solved by qualitative reasoning and the process of elimination.\nPhysical domain: Newtonian mechanics (15). Electromagnetism (10). Wave theory (10). Kinematics (9). Nuclear physics and elementary particles (7). Thermodynamics (6). Circuit analysis (6). Optics (5). Gravity. & EM (3). Radioactivity (2). Tension (1). Celestial mechanics (1).\nGeometric reasoning. 28 problems involved geometric reasoning of various kinds. I did not find a useful way of dividing these into categories.\nReal world knowledge: 8 problems involved the integration of real-world knowledge, as discussed in the text.\nTable 1: Categorization of problems in a sample SAT physics test\nknowledge. A summary is shown in table 1. Details are available on request.\nIn some respects, this meets the objectives of an AI benchmark strikingly well. The range of types of problems is particularly impressive; certainly prediction takes the lion’s share, but there is a good case to be made that that is reasonable. Also noteworthy is the comparatively slight dependence on exact arithmetic, and the large role played by qualitative reasoning of one kind and another.\nStill, it is hardly an ideal test for our purposes. The most important gap is the small number of problems that draw on real world knowledge. I should say that I am setting the bar on “real world knowledge” rather high here. (Also, of course, the term is not actually apt — electrons and so on are certainly part of the real world — but I can’t think of a better one.) I exclude references to real objects that might as well be perfectly abstract; for instance, problem 47 refers to “a car”, but it could just as well be “a mass”. I also exclude uses of the standard denizens of physics problems being used in standard ways: pulleys, blocks, strings, glass as a venue for reflection and refraction, and so on. I likewise exclude electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, batteries, and so on, being used in a standard way. If there were a problem in which the mass of a pulley or a resistor or the thickness of a string were important, that would count as “real world” (there aren’t any).\nThose excluded, there are in fact eight problems that invoke real world knowledge, mostly in very minor ways. The issue is important enough that we illustrate with four examples; of the rest, one\nis very similar to problem 33, and the other three involve real world knowledge only slightly, at the level of problem 9.\nProblem 9: Which of the physical principles below might be used to solve the following problem: A new soft drink bottle is opened, allowing gas to escape into the atmosphere. As the gas escapes, how does its degree of disorder change?\n(A) first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy) (B) second law of thermodynamics (law of entropy) (C) ideal gas law (D) heat of fusion and heat of vaporization equation (E) heat engine efficiency\n[I have slightly rearranged the statement of the question for clarity.]\nThe real world scenario is not actually critical here — one can solve the problem just by pattern matching on the phrase “degree of disorder”, and to some extent one actually does — but the reference to the soft drink is certainly helpful to the human student in grounding what would otherwise be rather obscure. It is not clear that this reference would be of any help to an AI.\nProblem 16: You are sitting on a seat facing forward on an airplane with its wings parallel to the ground. The window shades of the airplane are closed, and the vibration of the plane is negligible. When you place your class ring on the end of a necklace chain and hold the other end in front of you, you notice that the chain and ring hang vertically and point directly to the floor of the airplane. Which of the following could be true of the airplane?\nI. The airplane is at rest. II. The airplane is moving with a constant velocity. III. The airplane is increasing its speed. IV. The airplane is decreasing its speed.\n(A) I only (B) III only (C) I or II, but not III or IV. (D) III or IV, but not I or II. (E) IV only\nThis problem relies on a number of elements of real world knowledge; the test taker has to realize that the floor of an airplane is parallel to the wings and that the ground is perpendicular to the force of gravity. He also has to understand what it means to put a ring on one end of a chain and hold the other end. However, none of the 74 other problems draw on world knowledge in such a rich way, or anywhere close to it.\nProblem 27: [slightly reworded]. If a positively charged rod is brought near the knobs of a neutral electroscope, which of the following statements is true?\n(A) The electroscope can be charged negatively without the positively charged rod touching the knob and using only a grounding wire. (B) The electroscope can be charged positively without the positively charged rod touching the knob and using only a grounding wire. (C) The leaves of the electroscope are negatively charged. (D) The knob of the electroscope is positively charged. (E) The electroscope has a net positive charge.\nAnswering the question requires some understanding of the internal structure of the electroscope and of the geometry involved; it does not suffice to think of the device as a black box.\nProblem 33: [slightly reworded]. A positive charge is moving along a clockwise circle in the plane of the exam paper you are looking at. The direction of the magnetic field in the region shown is (A) out of the page and perpendicular to it. (B) into the page and perpendicular to it. (C) toward the top of the page. (D) toward the top of the page. (E) to the right.\nProblem 75 is of a similar flavor.\nThe need for world knowledge here is in interpreting the phrase “out of the page”. In itself, this would pose an extraordinarily difficult problem of interpretation. (One can imagine the poor AI, mulling over the PDF input, with no ẑ dimension, let alone an outward direction associated with the content, wondering what on earth the phrase could mean.) However, since the phrase is common in this kind of test (and, in fact, apparently associated only with electromagnetic theory on the SAT exam) and since there do not seem to be any other references to the exam page as a physical object, presumably the interpretation of this in terms of three dimensional geometry would be hard-coded.1\nThus, the integration of real-world knowledge is rare and often shallow.2 It seems to me that for an AI benchmark one would wish to see a great deal more such problems, and problems that require deeper levels of integration. I give some examples in appendix A.2.\nAnother category of problem that is underrepresented is problems that require integrating knowledge from multiple physical domains. In this sample exam, there is only one example:3\nQuestion . . . 38 relate[s] to the two masses M1 and M2 which have a charge Q1 and Q2 respectively. The masses are initially separated by a distance r.\nIf the two charged masses are placed in space so that no other forces affect them, and they remain at a distance r apart indefinitely, which of the following must be true? (A) Both charges are positive. (B) Q1 is positive and Q2 is negative. (C) Q1 is negative and Q2 is positive. (D) Q1 = Q2. (E) M1 = M2.\nThis is one of a collection of questions that discuss electric repulsion and gravitational attraction, so it is clear to the student here that the point is that these two forces are exactly balanced in the proposed scenario. The intended answer is thus (A); this is incorrect, since it is equally possible that both charges are negative.\nAgain one would wish to see more problems of this kind; there are quite a few examples in appendix A.2.\n1It would be interesting to know whether human students have any trouble with this. It is certainly a remarkable example of shifting the level of abstraction.\n2There may be good reasons for this, in terms of the human test. Including problems with real-world knowledge can make it harder to be sure that the physical analysis is correct (we will see an example in section 2.2); it can introduce unfair biases (e.g. does problem 16 give an unfair advantage to students who have flown in an airplane?) and so on.\n3There are two other problems that require knowledge of both gravity and electromagnetism. However these do not require integrating this knowledge; they appear in separate answers of the multiple choice."

      "heading" : "2.2 Regents’ fourth-grade science test",
      "text" : "No one could accuse the Regents’ fourth-grade science test of neglecting real world knowledge; practically all the problems on the test involve real world knowledge.\nThe Regents science test ranges over a number of subject but gives particular emphasis to biology. Of the 45 questions on the 2014 exam, 23 were in biology, 13 in physics, 7 in earth sciences, and 2 in astronomy (all these terms being broadly construed). The biology questions do address quite fundamental issues; the gap in “what any fool knows” questions discuss in section 1 is significantly less acute there, though not entirely gone. Appendix A.1 here includes a number of biology questions of various kinds that are more basic than any on the Regent’s test (consider, for example, questions 1.24 through 1.35). The coverage of basic physics, on the other hand, is not adequate for AI purposes, though it may be suitable for the fourth grade curriculum. Few physics problems are included, and those few are rather random (e.g. one problem tests knowledge of the fact that a black object gets hotter in the sun than a white object — hardly a very fundamental fact) and somewhat error-prone (see below).\nClark (2015), who advocates the use of this test as a challenge problem for AI gives three examples of problems that require complex world knowledge. One of these, indeed, seems to me very much the kind of problem we are looking for:\nA student puts two identical plants in the same type and amount of soil. She gives them the same amount of water. She puts one of these plants near a sunny window and the other in a dark room. This experiment tests how the plants respond to (A) light (B) air (C) water (D) soil.\nClark remarks of this that, “a reliable answer requires recognizing a model of experimentation (perform two tasks differing in only one condition), knowing that being near a sunny window will explose the plant to light, and that a dark room has no light in it.” His description seems correct to me.\nHowever the other two problems that Clark cites seem to be problematic in various respects. One is this:\nQuestion 13, 2011 Regents exam\nA student riding a bicycle observes that it moves faster on a smooth road than on a rough road. This happens because the smooth road has A. less gravity B. more gravity C. less friction D. more friction\nThe physics here is wrong. A bicycle can hardly be ridden at all if there is very little friction with the road (on ice, for instance). Once the friction is sufficient that the bicycle does not slip, increasing it further should hardly matter, since the bicycle wheel rolls without sliding along the road. At the contact point, the horizontal velocity of the wheel is zero. The fact that it is hard to ride on a rough surface must have to do with there being too much up and down. Both a student and an AI system would be penalized for knowing too much physics.\nThe third problem is similar.\nFourth graders are planning a roller-skate race. Which surface would be the best for this race? (A) gravel (B) sand (C) blacktop (D) grass\nClark says of this, “[A] ... reliable answer requires knowing that a roller-skate race involves roller skating, that roller skating is on a surface, that skating is best on a smooth surface, and that blacktop is smooth.”\nEven aside from the fact that I personally never heard the term “blacktop” when I was a child (it was always called “asphalt” where I grew up), this question and Clark’s analysis seem problematic to me. The reason that sand is unsuited to roller skating on is not so much that sand is not smooth — sandboarding, for example, is much more popular than asphalt surfing — but that roller skates tend to sink in sand, and that the sand can damage the bearings of the skates. I suspect that children who answer this question are largely basing it on direct experience of roller skating or similar activities on different surfaces, rather than using complex reasoning; and that an AI program would probably do something similar (e.g. compare the frequency of school child roller skate races in the various surfaces that it can find on the web.)\nThe Regents test also occasionally includes problems that are seriously badly formulated. For example, question 32 on the 2014 test read as follows:\nThe data table shows the air temperature at noon for a city in New York State on five Wednesdays during the month of March. The temperature for March 31 has been left blank.\nDate Air Temperature at Noon March 3 42 March 10 45 March 17 48 March 24 51 March 31 ?\nBased on the pattern shown in the data table, predict the air temperature at noon on Wednesday, March 31.\nI must say, I find it appalling that the Regents’ exam would include a question of this kind. It is simply teaching children that what they learn in school bears no relation to the actual world as they know it.4\nThe problem with this from the AI perspective is that it is much easier to write an AI program that gets the intended answer of 54 here than to write one that realizes that the question is nonsense. All the program needs is a rule that, if it sees an arithmetic sequence followed by a blank, it should fill in the next term of the sequence. It does not have to understand anything else about the question. If our benchmarks include a lot of problems of this kind, the strong temptation will be to develop programs that are good test-takers, rather than good physical reasoners. These kinds of test-taking tricks have nothing more to do with physical reasoning than the array of techniques that were programmed into Watson to deal with Jeopardy puns have to do with natural language understanding.\nFinally, this test to a rather surprising extent uses very similar problems from one year to the next. If a training corpus and a test corpus are extracted from a corpus collected over several years, the degree of success is likely to be unrealistically high.\nOverall, taking into account both my own and Clark’s analysis of these tests, my feelings about using the Regent’s test as a challenge test for AI is as follows:\n4Science students of all ages are prone to this misconception. Lambert (2012) tells of one Harvard physics student who, confronted with David Hestenes’ test of basic physics concepts, asked “How should I answer these questions — according to what you taught me, or how I usually think about these things?”\n• Certainly the problems are a challenge to the state of the art in natural language understanding, and are beyond the state of the art in diagram interpretation.\n• As a test for an AI system’s understanding of basic biology, it has some value, though many basic aspects of biological knowledge are not tested either directly or implicitly (e.g. the fact that a cow who has died will never live again; or that a mammal is born where its mother happens to be at the time, but not necessarily where its father happens to be.)\n• As a test for an AI system’s understanding of basic physics, it is entirely inadequate. The questions are few; the facts tested are arbitrary and comparatively unimportant; and the quality control on correctness is poor."

      "heading" : "3 Apparent advantages of standardized tests",
      "text" : "It seems to me that the apparent advantages of using standardized tests as benchmarks instead of creating our own tests for the purpose and using those are mostly either minor or illusory. The advantages that I aware of are the following:\n1. Standardized tests exist, in large number; they do not have to be created. This “argument from laziness” is not entirely to be sneezed at. The experience of the computational linguistics community shows that, if you take evaluation seriously, developing adequate evaluation metrics and test materials requires a very substantial effort. On the other hand, the experience of the computational linguistic community also suggests if you take evaluation seriously, this effort cannot be avoided by using preexisting materials. No one in the computational linguistics community would dream of proposing that NLP programs of any kind should be evaluated in terms of their scores on the English language SATs.\n2. Entrusting the issue of evaluation measures and benchmarks to the same physical reasoning community that is developing the programs to be evaluated is putting the foxes in charge of the chicken coops. The AI researchers will develop problems that fit their own ideas of how the problems should be solved. This is certainly a legitimate concern; but I expect in practice much less distortion will be introduced this way than by taking tests developed for testing people and applying them to AI. Again, the computational linguistic community has not generally been much troubled by this issue. (I have heard it argued that the near universal use of the BLEU measure for machine translation has distorted research in that area.)\n3. The standardized tests have been carefully vetted and the performance of the human population on them is very extensively documented. On the first point, as we have seen, the vetting does not seem to be completely air-tight; a number of questions with bugs have gotten through. On the second point, there is no great value to the AI community in knowing how well humans of different ages, training and so on do on this problem. It hardly matters which questions can be solved by 5 year olds, which by 12 year olds, and which by 17 year olds, since, for the foreseeable future, all AI programs of this kind will be idiot savants (when they are not simply idiots); capable of superhuman calculations at one minute, and subhuman confusions at the next. There is no such thing as the mental age of an AI program; the abilities and disabilities of an AI program do not correspond to those of any human being who has ever existed or could ever exist.\n4. Success on standardized tests is easily accepted by the public (in the broad sense, meaning everyone except researchers in the area), whereas success on metrics we have defined ourselves requires explanation, and will necessarily be suspect. This, it seems to me, is the one serious advantage of using standardized tests. Certainly the public is likely to take more interest in the claim that your program has passed the SAT, or even the fourth-grade Regents test, than in the\nclaim that it has passed a set of questions that you yourself designed and whose most conspicuous feature is that they are spectacularly easy.\nHowever, this is a double-edged sword. The public can easily jump to the conclusion that, since an AI program can pass a test, it has the intelligence of a human that passes the same test. For example, Ohlsson et al. (2013) entitled their paper “Verbal IQ of a Four-Year Old Achieved by an AI System.”5 Unfortunately, this was widely misinterpreted in the text as a claim about verbal intelligence or even general intelligence. Thus, an article in ComputerWorld (Gaudin 2013) had the headline “Top Artificial Intelligence System is as smart as a 4-year-old”; the Independent published an article “AI System found to be as clever as a young child after taking IQ test”; and articles with similar titles were published in many venues. These headlines are of course absurd; a four-year old can make up stories, chat, occasionally follow directions, invent words, learn language at an incredible pace; ConceptNet (the AI system in question) can do none of these.\nFinally, some standardized tests, including the SAT’s, are not published and are available to researchers only under stringent non-disclosure agreements. It seems to me that AI researchers should under no circumstances use such a test with such an agreement. The loss from the inability to discuss the program’s behavior on specific examples far outweighs the gain from using a test with the imprimatur of the official test designer. This applies equally to Haroun and Hestenes’ (1985) well-known basic physics test; in any case, it would seem from the published information that that test focuses on testing understanding of force and energy rather than testing the relation of formal physics to basic world knowledge."

If we want to stick to short answer test formats, which does have advantages, then certainly the standardized tests are a starting point (once we have edited out the bad apples.) However, we should supplement those with many more problems that require real world knowledge; problems that combine knowledge from different theories; and problems that use forms of reasoning and forms of geometric knowledge that are overlooked or underutilized.\nMore importantly, however, we should not confine ourselves to exam-style benchmarks and goals. Rather, we should consider a variety of tasks such as:\n• Understanding texts of various kinds: Textbooks, equipment manuals, text in narrative that draws on physical knowledge (Davis 2013) and so on.\n• Exam questions with essay style answers.\n• Reasoning about variants of physical situations (Davis 1998).\n• Integration with planners in situations that involve complex physical reasoning.\n• Integration with design programs (Klenk et al. 2014).\n• Guidance for robots.\nEach of these tasks will require dealing with new aspects of physical reasoning. The result will be a much richer theory and much more powerful programs than just looking at answering tests. Of\n5They have since changed the title to “Measuring an Artificial Intelligence System’s Performance on a Verbal IQ Test for Young Children”.\ncourse, designing benchmarks and metrics for these tasks is harder and less well defined than for short answer tests.

      "text" : "Standardized tests carry an immense societal burden and must meet a wide variety of very stringent constraints. They are taken by millions of students annually under very plain testing circumstances (no use of calculators, let alone Internet). They must therefore be gradable either automatically or by not very expert human graders. They bear a disproportionate (and at the current date, ever-increasing) role in determining the future of those students. They must be fair across a wide range of students. They must conform to existing curricula. They must maintain a constant level of difficulty, both across the variants offered in any one year, and from one year to the next. They are subject to intense scrutiny by large numbers of critics, many of them unfriendly. These constraints impose serious limitations on what can be asked and how exams can be structured.\nIn developing benchmarks for AI physical reasoning, we are subject to none of these constraints. Why tie our own hands, by confining ourselves to standardized tests? Why not take advantage of our freedom?"

There are no questions about electric circuits because I find them boring; plus they don’t lend themselves to commonsense reasoning.\nGroups of related problems are bracketed with lines of asterisks.\nPlease note: The point of this is to give examples of the kinds of features of problems that I discuss in the main text. It is not intended in itself as a benchmark collection for AI research, and I do not endorse its use as such. Still less do I intend it for use with human students."

A small quantity of potassium chlorate (KClO3) is heated in a test tube, and decomposes into potassium chloride (KCl) and oxygen (O2). The gaseous oxygen expands out of the test tube, goes through the tubing, bubbles up through the water in the beaker, and collects in the inverted beaker over the the water. Once the bubbling has stopped, the experimenter raises or lowers the beaker until the level of the top of water inside and outside the beaker are equal. At this point, the pressure in the beaker is equal to\n6Do not attempt to carry out this experiment based on the description here. Potassium chlorate is explosive, and safety precautions, not described here, must be taken.\natmospheric pressure. Measuring the volume of the gas collected over the water, and correcting for the water vapor which is mixed in with the oxygen, the experimenter can thus measure the amount of oxygen released in the decomposition.\nProblem 2.27: If the right end of the U-shaped tube were outside the beaker rather than inside, how would that change things? A. The chemical decomposition would not occur. B. The oxygen would remain in the test tube. C. The oxygen would bubble up through the water in the basin to the open air and would not be collected in the beaker. D. Nothing would change. The oxygen would still collect in the beaker, as shown.\nProblem 2.28: If the beaker had a hole in the base (on top when inverted as shown), how would that change things? A. The oxygen would bubble up through the beaker and out through the hole. B. Nothing would change. The oxygen would still collect in the beaker, as shown. C. The water would immediately flow out from the inverted beaker into the basin and the beaker would fill with air coming in through the hole.\nProblem 2.29 If the test tube, the beaker, and the U-tube were all made of stainless steel rather than glass, how would that change things? A. The chemical decomposition would not occur. B. The oxygen would seep through the stainless steel beaker. C. Physically it would make no difference, but it would be impossible to see and therefore impossible to measure.\nProblem 2.30 Suppose the stopper in the test tube were removed, but that the U-tube has some other support that keeps it in its current position. How would that change things? A. The oxygen would stay in the test tube. B. All of the oxygen would escape to the outside air. C. Some of the oxygen would escape to the outside air, and some would go through the U-shaped tube and bubble up to the beaker. So the beaker would get some oxygen but not all the oxygen.\nProblem 2.31 The experiment description says, “The experimenter raises or lowers the beaker until the level of the top of water inside and outside the beaker are equal. At this point, the pressure in the beaker is equal to atmospheric pressure.” More specifically: Suppose that after the bubbling has stopped, the level of water in the beaker is higher than the level in the basin (as seems to be shown in the right hand picture). Which of the following is true: A. The pressure in the beaker is lower than atmospheric pressure, and the beaker should be lowered. B. The pressure in the beaker is lower than atmospheric pressure, and the beaker should be raised. C. The pressure in the beaker is higher than atmospheric pressure, and the beaker should be lowered. D. The pressure in the beaker is higher than atmospheric pressure, and the beaker should be raised.\nProblem 2.32 Suppose that instead of using a small amount of potassium chlorate, as shown, you put in enough to nearly fill the test tube. How will that change things? A. The chemical decomposition will not occur. B. You will generate more oxygen than the beaker can hold. C. You will generate so little oxygen that it will be difficult to measure.\nProblem 2.33 In addition to the volume of the gas in the beaker, which of the following are important to measure accurately? A. The initial mass of the potassium chlorate. B. The weight of the beaker.\nC. The diameter of the beaker. D. The number and size of the bubbles. E. The amount of liquid in the beaker.\nProblem 2.34 The illustration shows a graduated beaker. Suppose instead you use an ungraduated glass beaker. How will that change things? A. The oxygen will not collect properly in the beaker. B. The experimenter will not know whether to raise or lower the beaker. C. The experimenter will not be able to measure the volume of gas.\nProblem 2.35 The illustration shows two separate basins and beakers. What is the significance of that? A. These are two separate basins and beakers. B. The left hand picture (a) shows the state of things at the very start of the experiment; the right hand picture (b) shows the state of things at the very end of the experiment. C. The left hand picture (a) shows the state of things toward the beginning of the experiment, after some gas has been evolved and collected; the right hand picture (b) shows the state of things toward the end, after the bubbling has stopped but before the levels have been equalized. D. The right hand picture illustrates safety procedures.\nProblem 2.36 Both pictures (a) and (b) show the mouth of the beaker below the level of the water in the basin. Suppose that instead the mouth of the beaker is above the level of water in the basin. What would happen? A. The water would flow out of the beaker into the basin. B. The water will stay in the beaker, but the oxygen would escape into the open air in the gap between the mouth of the beaker and the surface of water in the basin. C. The oxygen will collect in the beaker, but it will be impossible to carry out the procedure of balancing the pressures by raising and lowering the beaker.\nProblem 2.37 At the start of the experiment, the beaker needs to be full of water, with its mouth in the basin below the surface of the water in the basin. How is this state achieved? A. Fill the beaker with water right side up, turn it upside down, and lower it upside down into the basin. B. Put the beaker rightside up into the basin below the surface of the water; let it fill with water; turn it upside down keeping it underneath the water; and then lift it upward, so that the base is out of the water, but keeping the mouth always below the water. C. Put the beaker upside down into the basin below the surface of the water; and then lift it back upward, so that the base is out of the water, but keeping the mouth always below the water. D. Put the beaker in the proper position, and then splash water upward from the basin into it. E. Put the beaker in its proper position, with the mouth below the level of the water; break a small hole in the base of the beaker; suction the water up from the basin into the beaker using a pipette; then fix the hole\n(What would be really cool here would be to show animations of the five possibilities.)\nProblem 2.38 From the time that you first bring the heat to the test tube to the time that you finish measuring the volume of gas, how much time would you think elapses? A. A fraction of a second. B. Several minutes to an hour. C. Several days. D. A year or more.\n************************************************************\nProblem 2.39 Nearby stars exhibit parallax due to the annual motion of the earth.

The dim time corresponds to the time that the dark twin is partially occluding the bright star, from the point of view of earth.\nIt is further observed that the cycle time is not quite constant; it is slightly shorter in the spring and slightly longer in the fall.\nWhich of the following explanations of this variance in the cycle time is most plausible?\nA. The earth is closer in the spring and further in the fall, so the light take less time to travel in the spring. B. The earth is moving toward the star in the spring and moving away in the fall, so in the spring it is closer at each successive observation. C. The earth is closer in the spring and further in the fall. The earth’s gravity is affecting the star’s revolution, so that it moves faster in the spring and slower in the fall. D. There is a third invisible star that is affecting the dark star’s behavior.\nProblem 2.42: This change in cycle time will be largest if A. The star is in the plane of the earth’s revolution. B. The star is on the line from the earth perpendicular to the plane of the earth’s revolution. C. The position of the star in the sky makes no difference.\nProblem 2.43: Suppose that the star is in the plane of the earth’s revolution and 20 light years away. What is the difference between the cycle time at its shortest and the cycle time at its longest? Note: the earth’s orbital velocity is about 30 km/sec; the speed of light is about 300,000 km/sec.\nProblem 2.44: This effect is analogous to: A. Precesssion of the equinoxes. B. Doppler effect/red shift. C. Motion of a mass on a spring. D. Foucault’s pendulum."

These headlines are of course absurd; a four-year old can make up stories, chat, occasionally follow directions, invent words, learn language at an incredible pace; ConceptNet (the AI system in question) can do none of these. Finally, some standardized tests, including the SAT’s, are not published and are available to researchers only under stringent non-disclosure agreements. It seems to me that AI researchers should under no circumstances use such a test with such an agreement. The loss from the inability to discuss the program’s behavior on specific examples far outweighs the gain from using a test with the imprimatur of the official test designer. This applies equally to Haroun and Hestenes’ (1985) well-known basic physics test; in any case, it would seem from the published information that that test focuses on testing understanding of force and energy rather than testing the relation of formal physics to basic world knowledge.",

    "abstractText" : "In this position paper, I argue that standardized tests for elementary science such as SAT or Regents tests are not very good benchmarks for measuring the progress of artificial intelligence systems in understanding basic science. The primary problem is that these tests are designed to test aspects of knowledge and ability that are challenging for people; the aspects that are challenging for AI systems are very different. In particular, standardized tests do not test knowledge that is obvious for people; none of this knowledge can be assumed in AI systems. Individual standardized tests also have specific features that are not necessarily appropriate for an AI benchmark. I analyze the Physics subject SAT in some detail and the New York State Regents Science test more briefly. I also argue that the apparent advantages offered by using standardized tests are mostly either minor or illusory. The one major real advantage is that the significance is easily explained to the public; but I argue that even this is a somewhat mixed blessing. I conclude by arguing that, first, more appropriate collections of exam style problems could be assembled, and second, that there are better kinds of benchmarks than exam-style problems. In an appendix I present a collection of sample exam-style problems that test kinds of knowledge missing from the standardized tests. It has often been proposed that a standardized tests constitute useful goals for AI systems doing automated scientific reasoning and informative benchmarks for progress. For example Brachman et al. (2005) suggest developing a program that can pass the SATs. Clark, Harrison, and Balasubramanian (2013) propose a project of passing the New York State Regents Science Test for 4th graders. Strickland (2013) proposes developing an AI that can pass the entrance exams for the University of Tokyo. Ohlsson et al. (2013) evaluated the performance ConceptNet system (Havasi, Speer, and Alonso 2007) on a preprocessed form of the Wechesler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence test. Barker et al. (2004) describes the construction of a knowledge-based system that (more or less) scored a 3 (passing) on two section of the high school chemistry Advanced Placement test. In this position paper, I want to discuss specifically the project of developing AI programs to pass standardized science tests, as a step toward developing AI programs with powerful abilities to reason about science; and I will argue that focusing narrowly on this goal is not the best way of advancing AI understanding of basic science, and that this benchmark is not the best way of measuring progress. The dangers of focusing on too narrow and idiosyncratic a target are well illustrated by Watson. IBM set itself the goal of winning at Jeopardy, and with huge labors, in an extraordinary tour de force, succeeded. However, it is not at all clear what contribution this has made to AI technology;",
