      "text" : "We propose a novel deep learning model for joint document-level entity disambiguation, which leverages learned neural representations. Key components are entity embeddings, a neural attention mechanism over local context windows, and a differentiable joint inference stage for disambiguation. Our approach thereby combines benefits of deep learning with more traditional approaches such as graphical models and probabilistic mention-entity maps. Extensive experiments show that we are able to obtain competitive or stateof-the-art accuracy at moderate computational costs."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Entity disambiguation (ED) is an important stage in text understanding which automatically resolves references to entities in a given knowledge base (KB). This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity between surface form mentions such as names and the entities they refer to. This many-to-many ambiguity can often be captured partially by name-entity co-occurrence counts extracted from entity-linked corpora.\nED research has largely focused on two types of contextual information for disambiguation: local information based on words that occur in a context window around an entity mention, and, global information, exploiting document-level coherence of the referenced entities. Many stateof-the-art methods aim to combine the benefits of both, which is also the philosophy we follow in this paper. What is specific to our approach is that we use embeddings of entities as a common representation to assess local as well as global evidence.\nIn recent years, many text and language understanding tasks have been advanced by neural network architectures. However, despite recent work, competitive ED systems still largely employ manually designed features. Such features often rely on domain knowledge and may fail to capture all relevant statistical dependencies and interactions. The explicit goal of our work is to use deep learning in order to learn basic features and their combinations from scratch. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to carry out this program with full rigor."

      "text" : "There is a vast prior research on entity disambiguation, highlighted by (Ji, 2016). We will focus here on a discussion of our main contributions in relation to prior work.\nEntity Embeddings. We have developed a simple, yet effective method to embed entities and words in a common vector space. This follows the popular line of work on word embeddings, e.g. (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014), which was recently extended to entities and ED by (Yamada et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2016; Zwicklbauer et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2015). In contrast to the above methods that require data about entity-entity co-occurrences, we avoid the use of such additional data and rather bootstrap entity embeddings from their canonical entity pages and local context of their hyperlink annotations. This allows for more efficient training and alleviates the need to compile co-linking statistics. Also, we avoid hand-engineered features, multiple disambiguation steps, or the need for additional ad hoc heuristics.\nContext Attention. We present a novel attention mechanism for local ED. Inspired by mem-\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n04 92\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n7 A\npr 2\n01 7\nory networks (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) and insights of (Lazic et al., 2015), our model deploys attention to select words that are informative for the disambiguation decision. A learned combination of the resulting context-based entity scores and a mention–entity prior yields the final local scores. Our local model achieves better accuracy than the local probabilistic model of (Ganea et al., 2016), as well as the feature-engineered local model of (Globerson et al., 2016). As an added benefit, our model also has a smaller memory footprint. There have been other deep learning approaches to define better context models for ED. For instance (Francis-Landau et al., 2016; He et al., 2013) use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and stacked denoising auto-encoders, respectively, to learn representations of textual documents and canonical entity pages. Entities for each mention are locally scored based on cosine similarity with the respective document embedding. In a similar local setting (Sun et al., 2015) embed mentions, their immediate contexts and their candidate entities using word embeddings and CNNs. However, their entity representations are built from entity titles and entity categories only.\nCollective Disambiguation. Third, a novel deep learning architecture for global ED is proposed. Mentions in a document are resolved jointly, using a conditional random field (Lafferty et al., 2001) with parametrized potentials. We suggest to learn the latter by casting loopy belief propagation (LBP) (Murphy et al., 1999) as a rolled-out deep network. This is inspired by similar approaches in computer vision, e.g. (Domke, 2013), and allows us to backpropagate through the (truncated) message passing, thereby optimizing the CRF potentials to work well in conjunction with the inference scheme. Our model is thus trained end-to-end with the exception of the pre-trained word and entity embeddings. Previous work has investigated different approximation techniques, including: random graph walks (Guo and Barbosa, 2016), personalized PageRank (Pershina et al., 2015), intermention voting (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010), graph pruning (Hoffart et al., 2011), integer linear programming (Cheng and Roth, 2013), or ranking SVMs (Ratinov et al., 2011). Mostly connected to our approach is (Ganea et al., 2016) where LBP is used for inference (but not learning) in a probabilistic graphical model and (Globerson et al., 2016) where a single round of message passing\nwith attention is performed. To our knowledge, we are one of the first to investigate differentiable message passing for NLP problems."

      "heading" : "3 Learning Entity Embeddings",
      "text" : "In a first step, we propose to train entity vectors that can be used for the ED task (and potentially for other tasks). These embeddings compress the semantic meaning of entities and drastically reduce the need for manually designed features or co-occurrence statistics.\nEntity embeddings are bootstrapped from word embeddings and are trained independently for each entity. A few arguments motivate this decision: (i) there is no need for entity co-occurrence statistics that suffer from sparsity issues and/or large memory footprints; (ii) vectors of entities in a subset domain of interest can be trained separately, obtaining potentially significant speed-ups and memory savings that would otherwise be prohibitive for large entity KBs;1 (iii) entities can be easily added in an incremental manner, which is important in practice; (iv) the approach extends well into the tail of rare entities with few linked occurrences; (v) empirically, we achieve better quality compared to methods that use entity cooccurrence statistics.\nOur model embeds words and entities in the same low-dimensional vector space in order to exploit geometric similarity between them. We start with a pre-trained word embedding map x :W → Rd that is known to encode semantic meaning of words w ∈ W; specifically we use word2vec pretrained vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013). We extend this map to entities E , i.e. x : E → Rd, as described below.\nSuppose that words that co-occur with the mention of an entity e are governed by a conditional distribution p(w|e). Empirically, we assume that words with high probability p(w|e) appear (i) on canonical KB description pages of the entity, and (ii) within windows of fixed size surrounding mentions of an entity. The above distribution is then approximated from word-entity co-occurrence counts from these two sources: p̂(w|e) ∝ #(w, e). Next, let q(w) be a modified unigram word distribution p̂(w) which we use for sampling ”negative” words, i.e. ones unrelated to a specific entity. As in (Mikolov et al., 2013), we choose a modified unigram distribution\n1Notably useful with (limited memory) GPU hardware.\nq(w) = p̂(w)α for α ∈ (0, 1). We suggest to use a max-margin objective to infer the optimal entity embeddings. Let w+ ∼ p̂(w|e) and w− ∼ q(w), then:\nJ(z; e) = Ew+|e Ew− [ h ( z;w+, w− )] h(z;w, v) = [γ − 〈z,xw − xv〉]+ (1) xe = arg min\nz:‖z‖=1 J(z; e)\nwhere γ > 0 is a margin parameter and [·]+ is the soft-plus function. The above loss is optimized using stochastic gradient descent with projection over sampled pairs (w+, w−).\nWe empirically assess the quality of our entity embeddings on entity similarity and ED tasks as detailed in Section 7.2, Table 1 and Appendix A. The technique described in this section can also be applied, in principle, for computing embeddings of general text documents, but a comparison with such methods is left as future work."

      "heading" : "4 Local Model with Neural Attention",
      "text" : "We now explain our local ED approach that uses embeddings to steer a neural attention mechanism. We build on the insight that only a few context words are informative for resolving an ambiguous mention, something that has been exploited before in (Lazic et al., 2015). Focusing only on those words helps reducing noise and improves disambiguation. (Yamada et al., 2016) observe the same problem and adopt the restrictive strategy of removing all non-nouns. Here, we assume that a context word may be relevant, if it is related to at least one of the entity candidates of a given mention.\nContext Scores. Let us assume that we have a mention–entity prior p̂(e|m) available and that for each mention m, a pruned candidate set of entities Γ(m), |Γ(m)|≤ S has been identified. Our model, depicted in Figure 1, computes a score for each e ∈ Γ(m) based on the local context c = w1, . . . , wK surrounding m as well as the prior. It is a composition of differentiable functions, thus it is smooth from input to output, allowing us to easily compute gradients and backpropagate through it.\nEach word w ∈ c and entity e ∈ Γ(m) is mapped to its embedding via the pre-trained map x (cf. Section 3). We then compute an unnormalized support score for each word in the context as\nfollows:\nu(w) = max e∈Γ(m)\nx>e Axw (2)\nwhere A is a parameterized diagonal matrix. The score is high, if a word is strongly related to at least one candidate entity. We then apply a softmax function, (hard) pruned to the R ≤ K words which receive the highest score2 Denote the reduced context by c̄. Then we get explicitly\nβ(w) =\n{ exp[u(w)]∑ v∈c̄ exp[u(v)]\n. if w ∈ c̄ 0 otherwise.\n(3)\nWe then define a β-weighted context-based entitymention score via\nΨ(e, c) = ∑ w∈c̄ β(w) x>e Bxw (4)\nwhere B is another trainable diagonal matrix. We will later use the same architecture for unary scores of our global ED model.\nLocal Score Combination. We integrate these context scores with the context-independent scores encoded in p̂(e|m). Our final (unnormalized) local model is a combination of both Ψ(e, c) and log p̂(e|m):\nΨ(e,m, c) = f(Ψ(e, c), log p̂(e|m)) (5)\nHere, we found a flexible choice for f to be important and to be superior to any naı̈ve combination model. We therefore used a neural network with two fully connected layers of 100 hidden units and ReLU non-linearities, which we regularized as suggested in (Denton et al., 2015) by constraining the sum of squares of all weights in the linear layer. We use standard projected SGD for training. The same network is also used in Section 5.\nLearning the Local Model. Entity and word embeddings are pre-trained as discussed in Section 3. Thus, the only learnable parameters are the diagonal matrices A and B, plus the parameters of f . Having few parameters helps to avoid overfitting and to be able to train with little annotated data. We assume that a set of known mentionentity pairs {(m, e∗)}with their respective context\n2We implement this using the layers Threshold and TemporalDynamicKMaxPooling from Torch nn package, which allows to compute a subgradient. Without the pruning stage, we get slightly worse results (see Section 7.4).\nwindows have been extracted from a corpus. For model fitting, we then utilize a max-margin loss that ranks ground truth entities higher than other candidate entities. This leads us to the objective:\nθ∗ = arg min θ ∑ m ∑ e∈Γ(m) g(e,m), (6) g(e,m) := [γ −Ψ(e∗,m, c) + Ψ(e,m, c)]+\nwhere γ > 0 is a margin parameter. So we aim to find a Ψ (i.e. parameterized by θ) such that the score of the correct entity e∗ referenced by m is at least γ higher than that of any other candidate entity e. Whenever this is not the case, the margin violation becomes the experienced loss."

      "heading" : "5 Document-Level Deep Model",
      "text" : "Next, we address global ED assuming document coherence among entities. We therefore introduce the notion of a document as consisting of a sequence of mentions m = m1, . . . ,mn, along with their context windows c = c1, . . . cn. Our goal is to define a joint probability distribution over Γ(m1) × . . . × Γ(mn) 3 e. Each such e selects one candidate entity to each mention in the document. Obviously, the state space of e grows exponentially in the number of mentions n.\nCRF Model Our model is a fully-connected pairwise conditional random field, defined on the\nlog scale as\ng(e,m, c)= n∑ i=1 Ψ(ei,mi, ci) + ∑ i<j Φ(ei, ej) (7)\nThe unary factors are the local scores described in Eq. (4). The pairwise factors are bilinear forms of the entity embeddings\nΦ(e, e′) = 2\nn− 1 x>e Cxe′ , (8)\nwhere C is again a diagonal matrix. Similar to (Ganea et al., 2016), the above normalization helps balancing the unary and pairwise terms across documents with different numbers of mentions.\nDifferentiable Inference Training and prediction in binary CRF models as above is NP-hard. Therefore, in learning one usually maximizes a likelihood approximation and during operations (i.e. in prediction) one may use an approximate inference procedure, often based on messagepassing. Among many challenges of these approaches, it is worth pointing out that weaknesses of the approximate inference procedure are generally not captured during learning. Inspired by (Domke, 2011, 2013), we use truncated fitting of LBP to a fixed number of message passing iterations. Our model directly optimizes the marginal\nlikelihoods, using the same networks for learning and prediction. As noted by (Domke, 2013), this method is robust to model mis-specification, avoids inherent difficulties of partition functions and is faster compared to double-loop likelihood training (where, for each stochastic update, inference is run until convergence is achieved).\nOur architecture is shown in Figure 2. A neural network with T layers encodes T message passing iterations of synchronous max-product LBP3 which is designed to find the most likely (MAP) entity assignments. We also use message damping, which is known to speed-up and stabilize convergence of message passing. Formally, in iteration t, mention mi votes for entity candidate e ∈ Γ(mj) of mention mj using the normalized log-message mti→j(e) computed as:\nmt+1i→j(e ′) = max\ne∈Γ(mi)\n{ Ψ(e,mi, ci) + Φ(e, e ′)\n+ ∑ k 6=j mtk→i(e)} . (9)\nHerein the first part just reflects the CRF potential, whereas the second part is defined as\nmti→j(e) = log[δ · softmax(mti→j(e)) (10) + (1− δ) · exp(mt−1i→j(e))]\nwhere δ ∈ (0, 1] is a damping factor. Note that, without loss of generality, we simplified the LBP procedure by dropping the factor nodes.\nAfter T iterations, the beliefs (marginals) are computed as:\nµi(e) = Ψ(e,mi, ci) + ∑ k 6=i mTk→i(e) (11) µi(e) = exp[µi(e)]∑\ne′∈Γ(mi) exp[µi(e ′)]\n(12)\n3Sum-product and mean-field performed worse in our experiments.\nSimilar to the local case, we obtain accuracy improvement when combining the mention-entity prior p̂(e|m) with marginal µi(e) using the nonlinear combination function f described in Section 4. The learned function f for global ED is non-trivial (see Figure 3), showing that the influence of the prior tends to weaken for larger µ(e), whereas it has a dominating influence, whenever the document-level evidence is weak.\nParameters of our global model are the diagonal matrices A,B,C and the weights of the f network. As before we found a margin based objective to be most effective and we suggest to fit parameters by minimizing a ranking loss4 defined over the marginals\nρi(e) := f(µi(e), p̂(e|mi)) (13)\nas follows: L(θ) = ∑ D ∑ mi ∑ e∈Γ(mi) e 6=e∗\ni\nh(mi, e) (14)\nh(mi, e) = [γ − ρi(e∗i ) + ρi(e)]+ (15) 4Optimizing a marginal log-likelihood loss function per-\nformed worse.\nComputing this objective is trivial by running T times the steps described by Eqs. (9), (10), followed in the end by step in Eq. (12). Each step is differentiable and the gradient over model parameters can be computed on the resulting marginals and back-propagated over messages using the chain rule.\nIn operations, prediction is done independently for each mention mi by based on maximizing the ρi(e) score."

It is computed by averaging probabilities from two indexes build from mention entity hyperlink statistics from Wikipedia and a large Web corpus (Spitkovsky and Chang, 2012), plus the YAGO index of (Hoffart et al., 2011) (with uniform prior).\nCandidate selection, i.e. building of Γ(e), is done for each input mention as follows: first, the top 30 candidates are selected based on p̂(e|m). Then, in order to optimize for memory and run time (LBP has complexity quadratic in S), we keep only 7 of these entities based on the following heuristic: (i) the top 4 entities based on p̂(e|m) are selected, (ii) the top 3 entities based on the local context-entity similarity measured as in Eq. 4 are selected.5. We refrain from annotating mentions without any candidate, implying that precision and recall can be different in our case.\nIn a few cases, generic mentions of persons (e.g. ”Peter”) are coreferences of more specific mentions (e.g. Peter Such”) from the same document. We employ a simple heuristic to address this issue: for each mention m, if there exist mentions\n5We have used a simpler context vector here and simply used the average of all its constituent word vectors\nof persons that contain m as a continuous subsequence of words, then we consider the merged candidate set of these specific mentions for the mention m.

Subsequently, Wikipedia hyperlinks of the respective entities are used for learning until validation score (described below) stops improving. In each iteration, 20 positive words, each with 5 negative words, are sampled and used for optimization as explained in Section 3. We use Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) with a learning rate of 0.3. We choose embedding size d = 300, pretrained (fixed) Word2Vec word vectors8, α = 0.6, γ = 0.1 and window size of 20 for the hyperlinks. We remove stop words before training.

The associated task requires ranking of related candidate entities. Following previous work, we use different evaluation metrics: normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) and mean average precision (MAP).

We perform candidate ranking based on cosine similarity of entity pairs.\nLocal and Global Model Training Our local and global ED models are trained on AIDAtrain (multiple epochs), validated on AIDA-A and tested on AIDA-B and other datasets mentioned in Section 7.1. We use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with learning rate of 1e-4 until validation accuracy exceeds 90%, afterwards setting it to 1e5. Variable size mini-batches consisting of all mentions in a document are used during training. We remove stop words. Hyper-parameters of the best validated global model are: γ = 0.01,K = 100, R = 25, S = 7, δ = 0.5, T = 10. Validation accuracy is computed after each 5 epochs. To regularize, we keep the number of parameters low (approx. 1.2K parameters) and use early stopping, i.e. we stop if the validation accuracy does not increase after 500 epochs. Training on a single GPU takes, on average, 2ms per mention, or 16 hours\nfor 1250 epochs over AIDA-train."

Key components are entity embeddings, a neural attention mechanism over local context windows, and a differentiable joint inference stage for disambiguation. Our approach thereby combines benefits of deep learning with more traditional approaches such as graphical models and probabilistic mention-entity maps. Extensive experiments show that we are able to obtain competitive or stateof-the-art accuracy at moderate computational costs.",
