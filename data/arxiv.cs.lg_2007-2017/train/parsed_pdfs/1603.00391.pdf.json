      "text" : "The introduction of the piecewise-linear activation functions such as ReLU and Maxout (Goodfellow et al., 2013) units had a profound effect on deep learning, and was a major catalyst in allowing the training of much deeper networks. It is thanks to ReLU that for the first time a few\nyears ago it was shown (Glorot et al., 2011) that very deep purely supervised networks can be trained, whereas using tanh nonlinearity only allowed to train shallow networks. A plausible hypothesis about the recent surge of interest on these piecewise-linear activation functions (Glorot et al., 2011), is due to the fact that they are easier to optimize with SGD and backpropagation than smooth activation functions, such as sigmoid and tanh. The recent successes of piecewise linear functions is particularly evident in computer vision, where the ReLU has become the default choice in convolutional networks.\nIn this paper, we propose a new technique to train networks with activation functions which strongly saturate when their input is large. This is achieved by adding noise to the activation function in its saturated regime. Using this approach, we have found that it was possible to train neural networks with much wider family of activation functions. Adding noise to the activation function has been considered for ReLU units and was explored in (Bengio et al., 2013; Nair & Hinton, 2010) for feed-forward networks and Boltzmann machines to encourage units to explore more and make the optimization easier.\nMore recently there has been a resurgence of interest in more elaborate “gated” architectures such as LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and GRUs (Cho et al., 2014), but also encompassing neural attention mechanisms that have been used in the NTM (Graves et al., 2014), Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2014), automatic image captioning (Xu et al., 2015) and wide areas of applications (LeCun et al., 2015). A common thread running through these works is the use of soft-saturating non-linearities, such as the sigmoid or softmax, to emulate the hard decisions of digital logic circuits. In spite of its success, there are two key problems with this approach.\n1. Since the non-linearities still saturate there are problems with vanishing gradient information flowing\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n00 39\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\nM ar\nthrough the gates; and\n2. since the non-linearities only softly saturate they do not allow one to take hard decisions.\nAlthough gates often operate in the soft-saturated regime (Karpathy et al., 2015; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Hermann et al., 2015) the architecture prevents them from being fully open or closed. In this paper we take a novel approach to addressing both of these problems. Our method addresses the second problem through the use of hard-saturating nonlinearities, which allow gates to make perfectly on or off decisions when they saturate. Since the gates are able to be completely open or closed, no information is lost through the leakiness of the soft-gating architecture.\nBy introducing hard-saturating nonlinearities we have exacerbated the problem of gradient flow, since gradients in the saturated regime are now precisely zero instead of merely very small. However, by introducing noise into the activation function that grows based on the depth of saturation we encourage random exploration when the units saturate, and normal behavior when they do not.\nAt test time the noise in the activation functions can be removed, and as our experiments show, the resulting deterministic networks clearly outperform their soft-saturating counterparts on a wide variety of tasks, and allow to reach state-of-the-art performance by simple drop-in replacement of the nonlinearities in existing training code.\nThe technique that we propose in this paper, addresses the difficulty of optimization and having hard-activations at the test time for gating units and we propose a way of performing simulated annealing for neural networks."

      "text" : "Definition 2.1. (Activation Function). An activation function is a function h : R → R that is differentiable almost everywhere.\nDefinition 2.2. (Saturation). An activation function h(x) with derivative h′(x) is said to right (resp. left) saturate if its limit as x→∞ (resp. x→ −∞) is zero. An activation function is said to saturate (without qualification) if it both left and right saturates.\nMost common activation functions used in recurrent networks (for example, tanh and sigmoid) are saturating. In particular they are soft saturating, meaning that they achieve saturation only in the limit.\nDefinition 2.3. Hard and Soft Saturation. Let c be a constant such that x > c implies h′(x) = 0 and left hard saturates of x < c implies h′(x) = 0, ∀x. We say that h(·) hard saturates (without qualification) if it both left and right hard\nsaturates. An activation function that saturates but achieves zero gradient only in the limit is said to soft saturate.\nWe can construct hard saturating versions of soft saturating activation functions by taking a first-order Taylor expansion about zero and clipping the results to an appropriate range.\nFor example, expanding tanh and sigmoid around 0, with x ≈ 0, we obtain linearized functions ut and us of tanh and sigmoid respectively:\nsigmoid(x) ≈ us(x) = 0.25x+ 0.5 (1) tanh(x) ≈ ut(x) = x. (2)\nClipping the linear approximations result to,\nhard-sigmoid(x) = max(min(us(x), 1), 0) (3)\nhard-tanh(x) = max(min(ut(x), 1), − 1). (4)\nThe motivation behind this construction is to introduce linear behavior around zero to allow gradients to flow easily when the unit is not saturated, while providing a crisp decision in the saturated regime.\nFor the rest of the document we will refer use h(x) to refer to a generic activation function and use u(x) to denote its linearization based on the first-order Taylor expansion about zero. hard-sigmoid saturates when x 6 −2 or x > 2 and hard-tanh saturates when x 6 −1 or x > 1. We denote xt the threshold, in absolute value, xt = 2 for hard-sigmoid and xt = 1 for the hard-tanh.\nThe ability of the hard-sigmoid and hard-tanh to make crisp decisions comes at the cost of exactly 0 gradients in the saturated regime. This can cause difficulties during training: a small but not infinitesimal change of the pre-activation (before the nonlinearity) may help to reduce the objective function, but this will not be reflected in the gradient.\nRemark. Let us note that both hard-sigmoid(x), sigmoid(x) and tanh(x) are all contractive mapping. hard-tanh(x), becomes a contractive mapping only when its input is greater than the threshold. An important difference among these activation functions is their fixed points. hard-sigmoid(x) has a fixed point at x = 32 . However the fixed-point of sigmoid is x = 0. Any x ∈ R between −1 and 1 can be the fixed-point of hard-tanh(x), but the fixed-point of tanh(x) is 0. tanh(x) and sigmoid(x) have point attractors at their fixed-points. Those mathematical differences among the saturating activation functions can make them behave very differently with RNNs and deep networks.\nThe highly non-smooth gradient descent trajectory may bring the parameters in a state that pushes the activations of a given unit inside the 0 gradient regime for a particular example, from where it becomes difficult to escape.\nWhen units saturate and gradients vanish, an algorithm may require many training examples and a lot of computation to recover."

      "heading" : "3. Annealing with Noisy Activation Functions",
      "text" : "Consider a noisy activation function φ(x, ξ) in which we have injected iid noise ξ, to replace a saturating nonlinearity such as the hard-sigmoid and hard-tanh introduced in the previous section. In the next section we describe the proposed noisy activation function which has been used for our experiments, but here we want to consider a larger family of such noisy activation functions, when we use some variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for training.\nLet ξ have variance σ2 and mean 0. We want to characterize what happens as we gradually anneal the noise, going from large noise levels (σ →∞) to no noise at all (σ → 0).\nFurthermore, we will assume that φ is such that when the noise level becomes large, so does its derivative with respect to x:\nlim |ξ|→∞ |∂φ(x, ξ) ∂x | → ∞. (5)\nIn the 0 noise limit, we recover a deterministic nonlinearity, φ(x, 0), which in our experiments is piecewise linear and allows us to capture the kind of complex function we want to learn. As illustrated in Figure 2, in the large noise limit, very large gradients are obtained because backpropagating through φ gives rise to very large derivatives. Hence, the noise drowns the signal: the example-wise gradient on parameters is much larger than it would have been with σ = 0. SGD therefore just sees noise and can move around anywhere in parameter space without “seeing” any trend.\nAnnealing is also related to the signal to noise ratio where SNR can be defined as the ratio of the variance of noise\nσsignal and σnoise, SNR = σsignal σnoise . If SNR → 0, the model will do pure random exploration. As we anneal SNR will increase, and when σnoise converges to 0, the only source of exploration during the training will come from the noise of Monte Carlo estimates of stochastic gradients.\nThis is precisely what we need for methods such as simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983) and continuation methods (Allgower & Georg, 1980) to be helpful, in the context of the optimization of difficult non-convex objectives. With high noise, SGD is free to explore all parts of space. As the noise level is decreased, it will prefer some regions where the signal is strong enough to be “visible” by SGD: given a finite number of SGD steps, the noise is not averaged out, and the variance continues to dominate. Then, as the noise level is reduced, SGD spends more time in “globally better” regions of parameter space. As it approaches zero, we are fine-tuning the solution and converging near a minimum of the noise-free objective function. A related approach of adding noise to gradients and annealing the noise was investigated in (Neelakantan et al., 2015) as well."

      "heading" : "4. Adding Noise Where the Unit Would Saturate",
      "text" : "A novel idea behind the proposed noisy activation is that the noise added to the nonlinearity is proportional to the magnitude of saturation of the nonlinearity. For hard-sigmoid(x) and hard-tanh(x), due to our parametrization of the noise, that translates into the fact that the noise is only added when the hard-nonlinearity saturates. This is different from previous proposals such as the noisy rectifier from Bengio (2013) where noise is added just before a rectifier (ReLU) unit, independently of whether the input is in the linear regime or in the saturating regime of the nonlinearity.\nThe motivation is to keep the training signal clean when the\nunit is in the non-saturating (typically linear) regime and provide some noisy signal when the unit is in the saturating regime.\nIn this paper, h(x) will refer to hard saturation activation function such as the hard-sigmoid and hard-tanh introduced in Sec. 2, we consider noisy activation functions of the following form:\nφ(x, ξ) = h(x) + s (6)\nwhere xt is the saturation threshold, and s = µ+ σξ. Here ξ is an iid random variable drawn from some generating distribution, and the parameters µ and σ (discussed below) are used to generate a location scale family from ξ.\nIntuitively when the unit saturates we pin its output to the threshold value t and add noise. The exact behavior of the method depends on the type of noise ξ and the choice of µ and σ, which we can pick as functions of x in order to let some gradients be propagated even when we are in the saturating regime.\nA desirable property we would like φ to approximately satisfy is that, in expectation, it is equal to the hard-saturating activation function, i.e.\nEξ∼N (0,1)[φ(x, ξ)] ≈ h(x) (7)\nIf the ξ distribution has zero mean then this property can be satisfied by setting µ = 0, but for biased noise it will be necessary to make other choices for µ. In practice, we used slightly biased φ with good results, though.\nIntuitively we would like to add more noise when x is far into the saturated regime, since a large change in parameters would be required desaturate h. Conversely, when x is close to the saturation threshold a small change in parameters would be sufficient for it to escape. To that end we make use of the difference between the original activation function h and its linearization u\n∆ = h(x)− u(x) (8)\nwhen choosing the scale of the noise. See Eqs.1 for definitions of u for the hard-sigmoid and hard-tanh respectively. The quantity ∆ is zero in the unsaturated regime, and when h saturates it grows proportionally to the distance between |x| and the saturation threshold xt.\nWe experimented with several ways of scaling σ with ∆, and empirically we found that the following formulation gave good results:\nσ(x) = c (g(p∆)− 0.5)2 g(x) = sigmoid(x). (9)\nIn Equation 9 a free scalar parameter p is learned during the course of training. By changing p, the model is able to adjust the magnitude of the noise and that also effects the sign of the gradient as well. The hyper-parameter c changes the scale of the standard deviation of the noise."

      "text" : "In the simplest case of our method we draw ξ from an unbiased distribution, such as a standard normal. In this case we choose µ = 0 to satisfy Equation 7 and therefore we will have,\nφ(x, ξ) = h(x) + σ(x)ξ\nDue to our parameterization of σ(x), when |x| ≤ xt our stochastic activation function behaves exactly as the hardsaturating activation h, leading to familiar territory. Because ∆ will be 0. Let us for the moment restrict our attention to the case when |x| > xt and h saturates. In this case the derivative of h(x) is precisely zero, however, if we condition on the sample ξ we have\nφ′(x, ξ) = ∂\n∂x φ(x, ξ) = σ′(x)ξ (10)\nwhich is non-zero almost surely.\nIn the non-saturated regime, where φ′(x, ξ) = h′(x) the optimization can exploit the linear structure of h near the origin in order to tune its output. In the saturated regime the randomness in ξ drives exploration, and gradients still flow back to x since the scale of the noise still depends on x. To reiterate, we get gradient information at every point in spite of the saturation of h, and the variance of the\ngradient information in the saturated regime depends on the variance of σ′(x)ξ."

      "heading" : "4.2. Pushing Activations Towards Linear Regime",
      "text" : "An unsatisfying aspect of the formulation with unbiased noise is that, depending on the value of ξ occasionally the gradient of φ will point the wrong way. This can cause a backwards message that would push x in a direction that would worsen the objective function, in average over ξ. Intuitively we would prefer these messages to “push back” the saturated unit towards a non-saturated state where the gradient of h(x) can be used safely.\nA simple way to achieve this is to make sure that the noise ξ is always positive, and adjust its sign manually to match the sign of x. In particular we could set\nd(x) =− sgn(x) sgn(1− α) s =µ(x) + d(x)σ(x)|ξ|.\nwhere ξ and σ are as before and sgn is the sign function, such that sgn(x) is 1 if x is greater than or equal to 0 otherwise it is −1. We also use the absolute value of ξ in the reparametrization of the noise, such that the noise is being sampled from a half-Normal distribution. We ignored the sign of ξ, such that the direction that the noise pushes the activations are determined by d(x). Matching the sign of the noise to the sign of x would ensure that we avoid the sign cancellation between the noise and the gradient message from backpropagation. sgn(1−α) is required to push the activations towards h(x) when the bias from α is introduced.\nIn practice we use a hyperparameter α that influences the mean of the added term, such that α near 1 approximately satisfies the above condition, as seen in Fig. 4. We can rewrite the noisy term s in a way that the noise can either be added to the linearized function or h(x). The relationship between ∆, u(x) and h(x) is visualized Figure 4.1 can be expressed as in Eqn 11.\nWe have experimented with different types of noise. Empirically, in terms of performance we found, half-normal and normal noise to be better. In Eqn 11, we provide the formulation for the activation function where = |ξ| if the noise is sampled from half-normal distribution, = ξ if the noise is sampled from normal distribution.\nφ(x, ξ) = u(x) + α∆ + d(x)σ(x) (11)\nBy using Eqn 11, we arrive to the noisy activations, which we used in our experiments.\nφ(x, ξ) = αh(x) + (1− α)u(x) + d(x)σ(x) (12)\nAs can be seen in Eqn 12, there are three paths that gradients can flow through the neural network, the linear path, nonlinear path and the stochastic path. The flow of gradients through these different pathways across different layers makes the optimization of our activation function easier.\nAt test time, we used the expectation of Eqn 12 in order to get deterministic units,\nEξ[φ(x, ξ)] = αh(x)+(1−α)u(x)+d(x)σ(x)Eξ[ ] (13)\nIf = ξ, then Eξ[ ] is 0. Otherwise if = |ξ|, then Eξ[ ] will be √ 2 π .\nAlgorithm 1 Noisy Activations with Half-Normal Noise for Hard-Saturating Functions\n1: ∆← h(x)− u(x) 2: d(x)← − sgn(x) sgn(1− α) 3: σ(x)← c (g(p∆)− 0.5)2 4: ξ ∼ N (0, 1) 5: φ(x, ξ)← αh(x) + (1− α)u(x) + (d(x)σ(x)|ξ|)\nTo illustrate the effect of α and noisy activation of the hard-tanh, We provide plots of our stochastic activation functions in Fig. 4."

      "text" : "Nonlinearities in neural networks are both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because they allow to represent more complicated functions and a curse because that makes the optimization more difficult. For example, we have found in several of our experiments that using a hard version (hence more nonlinear) of the sigmoid and tanh nonlinearities often improved results. In the past, various strategies have been proposed to help deal with the difficult optimization problem involved in training some deep networks, including curriculum learning, which is an approximate form of continuation method. Earlier work also included softened versions of the nonlinearities that would be gradually be made harder during training. Motivated by this prior work, we introduce and formalize the concept of noisy activations as a general framework for injecting noise in nonlinear functions so that large noise allows SGD to be more exploratory. We propose a specific noisy activation unit which only injects noise in the region where the unit would otherwise saturate, and allow gradients to flow even in that case. Even with a fixed noise level, we found the proposed noisy activations to outperform their sigmoid or tanh counterpart on many tasks and datasets, yielding new state-ofthe-art results, for example on PennTreebank. In addition, we found that annealing the noise to obtain a continuation method could further improved performance."

Gating mechanisms that use softly saturating activation functions to emulate the discrete switching of digital logic circuits are good examples of this. We propose to exploit the injection of appropriate noise so that some gradients may sometimes flow, even if the noiseless application of the activation function would yield zero gradient. Large noise will dominate the noise-free gradient and allow stochastic gradient descent to be more exploratory. By adding noise only to the problematic parts of the activation function we allow the optimization procedure to explore the boundary between the degenerate (saturating) and the well-behaved parts of the activation function. We also establish connections to simulated annealing, when the amount of noise is annealed down, making it easier to optimize hard objective functions. We find experimentally that replacing such saturating activation functions by by noisy variants helps training in many contexts, yielding state-of-the-art results on several datasets, especially when training seems to be the most difficult, e.g., when curriculum learning is necessary to obtain good results.",
