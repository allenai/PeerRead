      "text" : "Audio-visual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) is a case of multi-modal analysis in which two modalities (audio and visual) complement each other to recognize speech. Incorporating visual features, such as speaker’s lip movements and facial expressions, into automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems has been shown to improve their performances especially under noisy conditions. To this end several methods have been proposed which traditionally include variants of GMM/HMM models[4][2]. More recently AV-ASR methods based on deep neural networks (DNN) models[12][18][20] have been proposed.\nEnd-to-end speech recognition methods based on RNNs trained with CTC objective function[8][17][9] have come to the fore recently and have been shown to give performances comparable to that of DNN/HMM. The RNN trained with CTC directly learns a mapping between audio feature frames and character/phoneme sequences. This method eliminates the need for intermediate\n1 Version (Aug 2016) accepted in 4th International Workshop on Multimodal pattern recognition of social signals in human computer interaction(MPRSS 2016), a satellite event of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2016)\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n02 87\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 9\nN ov\n2 01\n6\nGMM/HMM training thereby simplifying the training procedure. To our knowledge, so far AV-ASR systems based on RNN trained with CTC have not been explored.\nIn this work, we design and evaluate an audio-visual ASR (AV-ASR) system using deep recurrent neural network (RNN) and CTC objective function. The design of an AV-ASR system includes the tasks of visual feature engineering, and audio-visual information fusion. Figure 1 shows the AV-ASR pipeline at test time. This work mainly deals with the visual feature extraction and processing steps and training protocol for the fusion model. Proper visual features are important especially in the case of RNNs as RNNs are difficult to train. Bottleneck features used in tandem with audio features are known to improve ASR performance [5][10][24]. We employ a similar idea to improve the discriminatory power of video features. We show that this helps the RNN to converge properly when compared with raw features. Finally, we compare the performances of feature fusion and decision fusion methods.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the prior work on AVASR. Bi-directional RNN and its training using CTC objective function are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 describes the feature extraction steps for audio and visual modalities. In section 5 different fusion models are explained. Section 6 explains the training protocols and experimental results. Finally, we summarize our work in 7."

      "text" : "The differences between various AV-ASR systems lie chiefly in the methods employed for visual feature extraction and audio-visual information fusion. Visual feature extraction methods can be of 3 types[21] : 1. Appearance based features where each pixel in the mouth region of the speaker (ROI) is considered to be informative. Usually a transformation such as DCT or PCA is applied to the ROI to reduce the dimensions. Additional feature processing such as mean normalization, intra-frame and inter-frame LDA may be applied [13][21]. 2. Shape based features utilize the geometric features such as height, width and area of the lip region or build a statistical model of the lip contours whose parameters are used as features. 3. Combination of appearance and shape based features.\nFusion methods can be broadly divided into two types[21][14]: 1. Feature fusion 2. Decision fusion. Feature fusion models perform a low level integration of audio and visual features and this involves a single model which is trained on the fused features. Feature fusion may include a simple concatenation of features or feature weighting and is usually followed by a dimensionality reduction transformation like LDA. Decision fusion is applied in cases where the output classes for the two modalities are same. Various decision fusion methods based on variants of HMMs have been proposed[4][2]. In Multistream HMM the emission probability of a state of audio-visual system is obtained by a linear combination of loglikelihoods of individual streams for that state. The parameters of HMMs for individual streams can be estimated separately or jointly. While multistream HMM assumes state level synchrony between the two streams, some methods[1][2] such as coupled HMM[2] allow for asynchrony between two streams. For a detailed survey on HMM based AV-ASR systems we refer the readers to [21][14]\nApplication of deep learning to multi-modal analyses was presented in [19] which describes multi-modal, cross-modal and shared representation learning and their applications to AV-ASR. In [12], Deep Belief Networks(DBN) are explored. In [18] the authors train separate networks for audio and visual inputs and fuse the final layers of two networks, and then build a third DNN with the fused features. In addition, [18] presents a new DNN architecture with a bilinear soft-max layer which further improves the performance. In [20] a deep de-noising auto-encoder is used to learn noise robust speech features. The auto-encoder is trained with MFCC features of noisy speech as input and reconstructs clean features. The outputs of final layer of the auto-encoder are used as audio features. A CNN is trained with images from the mouth region as input and phoneme labels as output. The final layers of the two networks are then combined to train a multi-stream HMM."

      "text" : "RNNs are a class of neural networks used to map sequences to sequences. This is possible because of the feedback connections between hidden nodes. In a bi-\ndirectional RNN, the hidden layer has two components each corresponding to forward(past) and backward(future) connections. For a given input sequence O = (O1, O2, ..., OT ), the output of the network is calculated as follows: forward pass through forward component of the hidden layer at a given instant t is given by\nh f t = g(W f hoOt + W f hhh f t−1 + b f h) (1)\nwhere Wfho is the input-to-hidden weights for forward component, W f hh corresponds to hidden-to-hidden weights between forward components, and b f\nh is the forward component bias. g is a non-linearity depending on the choice of the hidden layer unit. Similarly, forward pass through the backward component of the hidden layer is given by\nh b\nt = g(W b hoOt + W b hhh\nb t−1 + b b h) (2)\nwhere Wbho, W b hh, b\nb h are the corresponding parameters for the backward com-\nponent. The input to next layer is the concatenated vector [hft ,h b t ]. In a deep RNN multiple such bidirectional hidden layers are stacked. RNNs are trained using Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. The training algorithm suffers from vanishing gradients problem which is overcome by using a special unit in hidden layer called the Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)[11][6]."

      "heading" : "3.2 Connectionist Temporal Classification",
      "text" : "DNNs used in ASR systems are frame-level classifiers i.e., each frame of the input sequence is requires a class label in order for the DNN to be trained. The framelevel labels are usually HMM states, obtained by first training a GMM/HMM model and then by forced alignment of input sequences to the HMM states. CTC objective function[7][8] obviates the need for such alignments as it enables the network to learn over all possible alignments.\nLet the input sequence be O = (O1, O2, ..., OT ) and a corresponding label sequence l = (l1, l2, ..., lS) where S ≤ T . The RNN employs a soft-max output layer containing one node for each element in L′ where L′ = L∪{φ}. The number of output units is |L′| = |L| + 1. The additional symbol φ represents a blank label meaning that the network has not produced an output for that input frame. The additional blank label at the output allows us to define an alignment π of length T containing elements of L′. For example, (AφφMφ), (φAφφM) are both alignments of length 5 for the label sequence AM . Accordingly, a many to one map B : L′T 7−→ L≤T can be defined which generates the label sequence from an alignment.\nAssuming that the posterior probabilities obtained at soft-max layer, at each instant are independent we get\nP (π|O) = T∏ t=1 P (kt|Ot) (3)\nwhere k ∈ L′ and\nP (kt|Ot) = exp(ykt )\nΣk′ exp(yk ′ t )\n(4)\nwhere ykt is the input to node k of the soft-max layer at time t The likelihood of the label sequence given an observation sequence can be calculated by summing (3) over all possible alignments.\nP (l|O) = ∑\nπ∈B−1(l)\nP (π|O) (5)\nThe goal is to maximize the log-likelihood logP (l|O) estimation of a label sequence given an observation sequence. Equation 5 is computationally intractable since the number of alignments increases exponentially with the number of labels. For efficient computation of (5), forward-backward algorithm is used."

Each frame is converted to gray scale and face detection is performed using Viola-Jones algorithm. The 64x64 lip region is extracted by detecting 68 landmark points[15] on the speakers face, and cropping the ROI surrounding speakers mouth and chin. 100 dimensional DCT features are extracted from the ROI.\nAfter several experiments of training with DCT features, we found that RNN training either exploded or converged poorly. In order improve the discriminatory power of the visual features, we perform non-linear dimensionality reduction of the features using a deep bottleneck network. Bottleneck features are obtained by training a neural network in which one of the hidden layers has relatively small dimensions. The DNN is trained using cross-entropy cost function with character labels as output. The frame-level character labels required for DNN training are obtained by first training an acoustic model (RNNa) and then obtaining the outputs from the final soft-max layer of RNNa.\nThe DNN configuration is given by dim− 1024− 1024− 40− 1024− opdim where dim = 1100 and is obtained by splicing each 100 dimensional video frame\nwith a context of 10 frames - 5 on each side. opdim = |L′|.

In this work, we adapt the parameter γ for each utterance based on KL-divergence measure between the posterior probability distributions of RNNa and RNNv. The divergence between the posterior probability distributions is expected to vary as the noise in the audio modality increases. The KL-divergence is scaled to a value in [0, 1] using logistic sigmoid.

The dataset in effect consisted of 32692 utterances 90% of the which (containing 29423 utterances) was used for training and cross validation while the remaining (10%) data was used as test set. Both training and test data contain utterances from all of the speakers. Models were trained and tested using Kaldi speech recognition tool kit[22], Kaldi+PDNN[16] and EESEN framework[17].\nRNNa-Acoustic model RNNa contains 2 bi-directional LSTM hidden layers.Input to the network is 120-dimensional vector containing filter-bank coefficients along with ∆ and ∆∆ features. The model parameters are randomly initialized within the range [-0.1,0.1]. The initial learning rate is set to 0.00004. Learning rate adaption is performed as follows: when the improvement in accuracy on the cross-validation set between two successive epochs falls below 0.5%, the learning rate is halved.The halving continues for each subsequent epoch until the training stops when the increase in frame level accuracy is less than 0.1%.\nDeep Bottleneck Network The training protocol similar to [23] was followed to train the bottleneck network. Input video features are mean normalized and spliced. Cross-entropy loss function is minimized using mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The frames are shuffled randomly before each epoch. Batch size is set to 256 and initial learning rate is set to 0.008. Learning rate adaptation similar to acoustic model is employed.\nRNNv-Lip Reader RNNv is trained with bottleneck network features as input. The network architecture and training procedure is same as RNNa. Figure 3 depicts the learning curves when trained with bottleneck features and DCT features. The figure shows that bottleneck features are helpful in proper convergence of the model.\nRNNav The feature fusion model RNNav consists of 3 bi-directional LSTM hidden layers. The input dimension is 240, corresponding to filter-bank coeffi-\ncients of audio modality, bottleneck features of visual modality and their respective ∆ features. The initialization and learning rate adaption are similar to acoustic model training. However, the learning rate adaptation is employed only after a minimum number of(in this case 20) epochs are completed.\nDuring each utterance in an epoch we first present the fused audio-visual fused input sequence followed by the input sequence with audio input set to very low values. This prevents the RNNav from over-fitting to audio only inputs. Thus the effective number of sequences presented to the network in a given epoch is twice the total number of training utterances (AV and V features). After the training with AV and V features we train the network once again with two epochs of audio only utterances obtained by turning off the visual modality."

      "text" : "The audio-visual model is tested with three levels of babble noise 0dB SNR, 10dB SNR and clean audio. Noise was added to test data artificially by mixing babble noise with clean audio .wav files. In order to show the importance of visual modality under noisy environment, the model is tested with either audio or video inputs turned off. A token WFST[17] is used to map the paths to their corresponding label sequences. The token WFST obtains this mapping by removing all the blanks and repeated labels. Character Error Rate(CER) is obtained from the decoded and expected label sequences by calculating the Edit distance between them. The CER results are shown in Table 1.\nWe observe that with clean audio input, audio only RNNa performs significantly better (CER 2.45%) compared to audio-visual RNNav (CER 5.74%). However as audio becomes noisy, the performance of RNNa deteriorates significantly whereas the performance of RNNav remains relatively stable. Under noisy conditions the feature fusion model behaves as if it is not receiving any input from the audio modality.\nTable 1 also gives a comparison between feature fusion model and decision fusion model. We find that feature fusion model performs better than decision fusion model in all cases except under clean audio conditions. The poor CER of RNNa, RNNv model indicates that the frame level predictions between RNNa and RNNv are not synchronous. However, both the fusion models provide significant gains under noisy audio inputs. While there is large difference between RNNa and other models with clean inputs, we believe this difference is due to the nature of dataset and will reduce with larger datasets."

      "text" : "In this work we presented an audio-visual ASR system using deep RNNs trained with CTC objective function. We described a feature processing step for visual features using deep bottleneck layer and showed that it helps in faster convergence of RNN model during training. We presented a training protocol in which either of the modalities is turned off during training in order to avoid dependency on a single modality. Our results indicate that the trained model is robust to noise. In addition, we compared fusion strategies at the feature level and at the decision level.\nWhile the use of bottleneck features for visual modality helps in training, it requires frame level labels which involves an additional step of training audio RNN. Therefore, our system is not yet end-to-end. Our experiments in visual feature engineering with unsupervised methods like multi-modal auto-encoder[19] did not produce remarkable results. In future work we intend to explore other unsupervised methods for visual feature extraction such as canonical correlation analysis."

The frame labels obtained from the acoustic model are then used to perform a non-linear dimensionality reduction of the visual features using a deep bottleneck network. Audio and visual features are fused and used to train a fusion RNN. The use of bottleneck features for visual modality helps the model to converge properly during training. Our system is evaluated on GRID corpus. Our results show that presence of visual modality gives significant improvement in character error rate (CER) at various levels of noise even when the model is trained without noisy data. We also provide a comparison of two fusion methods: feature fusion and decision fusion.",
