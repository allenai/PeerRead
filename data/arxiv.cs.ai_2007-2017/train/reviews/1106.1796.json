Without such transfer, even if two tasks are very similar at some abstract level, an extensive re-learning effort is required. The system achieves much of its power by transferring parts of previously learned solutions rather than a single complete solution. The system exploits strong features in the multi-dimensional function produced by reinforcement learning in solving a particular task. These features are stable and easy to recognize early in the learning process. They generate a partitioning of the state space and thus the function. The partition is represented as a graph. This is used to index and compose functions stored in a case base to form a close approximation to the solution of the new task. Experiments demonstrate that function composition often produces more than an order of magnitude increase in learning rate compared to a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:11:20 GMT  (290kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1796v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["c drummond"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.1796"}
