      "text" : "Short-text classification is an important task in many areas of natural language processing, including sentiment analysis, question answering, or dialog management. Many different approaches have been developed for short-text classification, such as using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with rule-based features (Silva et al., 2011), combining SVMs with naive Bayes (Wang and Manning, 2012), and building dependency trees with Conditional Random Fields (Nakagawa et al., 2010). Several recent studies using ANNs have shown promising results, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Kim, 2014; Blunsom et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2012).\nMost ANN systems classify short texts in isolation, i.e., without considering preceding short texts.\n∗ These authors contributed equally to this work.\nHowever, short texts usually appear in sequence (e.g., sentences in a document or utterances in a dialog), therefore using information from preceding short texts may improve the classification accuracy. Previous works on sequential short-text classification are mostly based on non-ANN approaches, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Reithinger and Klesen, 1997), (Stolcke et al., 2000), maximum entropy (Ang et al., 2005), and naive Bayes (Lendvai and Geertzen, 2007).\nInspired by the performance of ANN-based systems for non-sequential short-text classification, we introduce a model based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and CNNs for sequential short-text classification, and evaluate it on the dialog act classification task. A dialog act characterizes an utterance in a dialog based on a combination of pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic criteria. Its accurate detection is useful for a range of applications, from speech recognition to automatic summarization (Stolcke et al., 2000). Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different datasets."

Table 2 presents our hyperparameter choices.\nWe initialized the word vectors with the 300- dimensional word vectors pretrained with word2vec on Google News (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b) for DSTC 4, and the 200-dimensional\n1All train/validation/test splits can be found at https:// github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/naacl2016\nword vectors pretrained with GloVe on Twitter (Pennington et al., 2014) for MRDA and SwDA, as these choices yielded the best results among all publicly available word2vec, GloVe, SENNA (Collobert, 2011; Collobert et al., 2011) and RNNLM (Mikolov et al., 2011) word vectors.\nThe effects of the history sizes d1 and d2 for the short-text and the class representations, respectively, are presented in Table 3 for both the LSTM and CNN models. In both models, increasing d1 while keeping d2 = 0 improved the performances by 1.3- 4.2 percentage points. Conversely, increasing d2 while keeping d1 = 0 yielded better results, but the performance increase was less pronounced: incorporating sequential information at the short-text representation level was more effective than at the class representation level.\nUsing sequential information at both the shorttext representation level and the class representation level does not help in most cases and may even lower the performances. We hypothesize that shorttext representations contain richer and more general information than class representations due to their larger dimension. Class representations may not convey any additional information over shorttext representations, and are more likely to propagate errors from previous misclassifications.\nTable 4 compares our results with the state-of-theart. Overall, our model shows competitive results, while requiring no human-engineered features. Rigorous comparisons are challenging to draw, as many important details such as text preprocessing and train/valid/test split may vary, and many studies fail\nto perform several runs despite the randomness in some parts of the training process, such as weight initialization."

However, many short texts occur in sequences (e.g., sentences in a document or utterances in a dialog), and most existing ANN-based systems do not leverage the preceding short texts when classifying a subsequent one. In this work, we present a model based on recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks that incorporates the preceding short texts. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different datasets for dialog act prediction.",
