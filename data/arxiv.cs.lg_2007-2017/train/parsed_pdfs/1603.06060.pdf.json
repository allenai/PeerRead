      "text" : "The under-performance of learning based systems during deployment stage can be attributed to dissimilarity in distribution of samples between the source domain on which the system is initially trained and the target domain on which it is deployed. Transfer learning is an active field of research which deals with transfer of knowledge between the source and target domains for addressing this challenge and enhancing performance of learning based systems [6], when it is challenging to train a system exclusively in the target domain due to unavailability of sufficient labeled samples. While domain adaptation (DA) have been primarily developed for simple reasoning and shallow network architectures, there exist few techniques for adapting deep networks\nwith complex reasoning [4]. In this paper we propose a systematic dropout based technique for adapting a stacked autoencoder (SAE) based deep neural network (DNN) [2] for the purpose of vessel segmentation in retinal images [1]. Here the SAE-DNN is initially trained using ample number of samples in the source domain (DRIVE dataset1) to evaluate efficacy of DA during deployment in the target domain (STARE dataset2) where an insufficient number of labeled samples are available for reliable training exclusively in the target domain.\nRelated Work: Autoencoder (AE) is a type of neural network which learns compressed representations inherent in the training samples without labels. Stacked AE (SAE) is created by hierarchically connecting hidden layers to learn hierarchical embedding in compressed representations. An SAE-DNN consists of encoding layers of an SAE followed by a target prediction layer for the purpose of regression or classification. With increase in demand for DA in SAEDNNs different techniques have been proposed including marginalized training [3], via graph regularization [7] and structured dropouts [10], across applications including recognizing speech emotion [4] to fonts [9].\nChallenge: The challenge of DA is to retain nodes common across source and target domains, while adapting the domain specific nodes using fewer number of labeled samples. Earlier methods [3, 7, 10] are primarily challenged by their inability to re-tune nodes specific to the source domain to nodes specific for target domain for achieving desired performance, while they are able to only retain nodes or a thinned network which encode domain invariant hierarchical embeddings.\nApproach: Here we propose a method for DA in SAE (DASA) using systematic dropout. The two stage method adapts a SAE-DNN trained in the source domain following (i) unsupervised weight adaptation using systematic dropouts in mini-batch training with abundant unlabeled samples in target domain, and (ii) supervised fine-tuning with limited number of labeled samples in target domain. The systematic dropout per mini-batch is introduced only\n1http://www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE 2http://www.ces.clemson.edu/ ahoover/stare\n1\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n06 06\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n9 M\nar 2\n01 6\nin the representation encoding (hidden) layers and is guided by a saliency map defined by response of the neurons in the mini-batch under consideration. Error backpropagation and weight updates are however across all nodes and not only restricted to the post dropout activated nodes, contrary to classical randomized dropout approaches [8]. Thus having different dropout nodes across different mini-batches and weight updates across all nodes in the network, ascertains refinement of domain specific hierarchical embeddings while preserving domain invariant ones.\nThe problem statement is formally introduced in Sec. 2. The methodology is explained in Sec. 3. The experiments are detailed in Sec. 4, results are presented and discussed in Sec. 5 with conclusion in Sec. 6."

When the statistics of samples in I is significantly dissimilar from Itrain, the performance of H(·) is severely affected. Generally {I}train is referred to\nas the source domain and I or the set of samples used during deployment belong to the target domain.

When |y| << |{pn}|, this network acts to store compressed representations of the pattern p encoded through the weights W = {w,b,w′,b′}. However the values of elements of these weight matrices are achieved through learning, and without the need of having class labels of the patterns p, it follows unsupervised learning using some optimization algorithm [5], viz. stochastic gradient descent.\n{w,b,w′,b′} = arg min {w,b,w′,b′} (J(W)) (3)\nsuch that J(·) is the cost function used for optimization over all available patterns pn ∈ {p(x),x ∈ I}\nJ(W) = ∑ n ‖pn − p̂n‖+ β|ρ− ρ̂n| (4)\nwhere β regularizes the sparsity penalty, ρ is the imposed sparsity and ρ̂n is the sparsity observed with the nth pattern in the mini-batch.\nThe SAE-DNN consists of L = 2 cascade connected AEs followed by a softmax regression layer known as the target layer with t as its output.

      "text" : "The results comparing performance of the SAE-DNN are reported in terms of logloss and area under ROC curve as presented in Table 1, and DA aspects in Fig. 3.\nHierarchical embedding in representations learned across domains: AEs are typically characteristic of learning hierarchical embedded representations. The first level of embedding represented in terms of w1 in Fig. 3(g) is over-complete in nature, exhibiting substantial similarity between multiple sets of weights which promotes sparsity in the nature of w2 in Fig. 3(h). Some of these weight kernels are domain invariant, and as such remain preserved after DA as observed for w1 in Fig. 3(i) and for w2 in Fig. 3(j). Some of the kernels which are domain specific, exhibit significant dissimilarity in w1 and w2 between source domain in Figs. 3(g) and 3(h) vs. target domain in Figs. 3(i) and 3(j). These are on account of dissimilarity of sample statistics in\nthe domains as illustrated earlier in Fig. 1 and substantiates DASA of being able to retain nodes common across source and target domains, while re-tuning domain specific nodes.\nAccelerated learning with DA: The advantage with DA is the ability to transfer knowledge from source domain to learn with fewer number of labeled samples and ample number of unlabeled samples available in the target domain when directly learning in the target domain does not yield desired performance. Figs. 3(k) and 3(l) compare the learning of w1 and w2 using ample unlabeled data in source and target domain exclusively vs. DA. Fig. 3(m) presents the acceleration of learning with DA in target domain vs. learning exclusively with insufficient number of labeled samples.\nImportance of transfer coefficient: The transfer coefficient τ drives quantum of knowledge transfer from the source to target domains by deciding on the amount of nodes to be dropped while adapting with ample unlabeled samples. This makes it a critical parameter to be set in DASA to avoid over-fitting and negative transfers as illustrated in Table. 2 where optimal τ = 0.1. Generally τ ∈ [0, 1] with τ → 0 being associated with large margin transfer between domains when they are not very dissimilar, and τ → 1 being associated otherwise."

      "text" : "We have presented DASA, a method for knowledge transfer in an SAE-DNN trained with ample labeled samples in source domain for application in target domain with less number of labeled samples insufficient to directly train to solve the task in hand. DASA is based on systematic droupout for adaptation being able to utilize (i) ample unlabeled samples and (ii) limited amount of labeled samples in target domain. We experimentally provide its efficacy to solve the problem of vessel segmentation when trained with DRIVE dataset (source domain) and adapted to deploy on STARE dataset (target domain). It is observed that DASA outperforms the different baselines and also exhibits accelerated learning due to knowledge transfer. While systematic drouput is demonstrated on an SAE-DNN in DASA, it can be extended to other deep architectures as well."
