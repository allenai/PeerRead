The classification is the process of predicting the classes among the huge amount of dataset by using some machine learning algorithms. The classification of different tumor types in gene expression data is of great importance in cancer diagnosis and drug discovery but it is more complex because of its huge size. DNA micro array technologies have made it possible to measure the expression levels of thousand of genes in a single experiment. There are multiple techniques available to analyze a gene expression profiles. A common characteristic of these techniques is selecting a subset of genes which is very informative for classification process and to reduce the dimensionality problem of profiles. In this research work ,Entropy based filtering approach is used for ranking the cancer genes and the top most genes were selected [1].Genes selected are classified by using Fuzzy Soft Sets and this classification approach reduced the complexity and increased the accuracy of classification compared with standard Fuzzy KNN algorithm and KNN. This paper also illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the other popular classification approaches such as K-Nearest Neighbor approach and Fuzzy KNN approach."

      "heading" : "2 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Soft set theory was initiated by Molodstov to solve some uncertainties among data which is not solved by traditional mathematical tools. He has shown several applications of this theory by solving many practical problems in various aspects like engineering, economics, and medical science etc [2]. Maji et al. have further studied the theory of soft sets and used this theory for some decision making problems[3][4]. They have also introduced the concept of fuzzy soft set theory for decision making problems. Aktas and cagman have introduced the notion of soft groups[5]. P.Majumdar et al. [6] have introduced generalized fuzzy soft set and they have studied the similarity\nmeasures of fuzzy soft set for medical diagnosis to detect the pneumonia disease among the ill persons[6]. Recently Milind M.Mushrif,et al have introduced a novel method for classification of natural textures using fuzzy soft set based classifier. Their new approach provides high accuracy for texture classification[7]. Bana Handaga et al. proposed numerical data classification for seven types of medical data and they provided higher accuracy [8]. Saberi et al. proposed gene selection method for cancer classification with less complexity[9]."

      "text" : "The main challenges in gene expression data classifica-\ntion is its huge size and its vagueness.Many researchers are trying to achive the higher accuracy for gene classification by reducing or selecting the informative genes among the thousands of genes. For cancer classification, researchers have used some machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Principle Component Analysis etc., Rough Set Theory and Fuzzy logic are only used for Gene selection. In this paper we use soft set based classification method for cancer classification. In this algorithm genes are selected for dimensionality reduction by entropy filter approach and the genes are fuzzified based on its expression level and fuzzy soft set based classification method is applied for cancer classification."

      "text" : "Classification is the most important technique in microarray technology. This technique is used for prediction of classes among the genes or samples. Prediction plays an important role in biomedical field for disease stage prediction and drug discovery. In this paper, classification technique is applied for predicting the cancer types among the genes in various cancer gene expression datasets such as leukemia cancer gene expression dataset with two classes tumor and non tumor, lung cancer gene expression dataset with two classes tumor and normal and Breast cancer gene expression dataset with two classes benign and malignant.\nIn this work, Fuzzy Soft Set Gene Classification is\nproposed for classification of Gene expression data. The classification accuracy of the proposed approach is compared with the KNN and Fuzzy KNN Algorithm. The experimental analysis illustrates the effectiveness of fuzzy soft set approach over the other two approaches. In future, it can be applied for other data sets also."
