      "text" : "Syntactic analysis is a central problem in language understanding that has received a tremendous amount of attention. Lately, dependency parsing has emerged as a popular approach to this problem due to the availability of dependency treebanks in many languages (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007; McDonald et al., 2013) and the efficiency of dependency parsers.\nTransition-based parsers (Nivre, 2008) have been shown to provide a good balance between efficiency and accuracy. In transition-based parsing, sentences are processed in a linear left to right pass; at each position, the parser needs to choose from a set of possible actions defined by the transition strategy. In greedy models, a classifier is used to independently decide which transition to take based on local features of the current parse configuration. This classifier typically uses hand-engineered features and is trained on individual transitions extracted from the gold transition sequence. While extremely fast, these greedy models typically suffer from search errors due to the inability to recover from incorrect decisions. Zhang and Clark (2008) showed that a beamsearch decoding algorithm utilizing the structured\nperceptron training algorithm can greatly improve accuracy. Nonetheless, significant manual feature engineering was required before transitionbased systems provided competitive accuracy with graph-based parsers (Zhang and Nivre, 2011), and only by incorporating graph-based scoring functions were Bohnet and Kuhn (2012) able to exceed the accuracy of graph-based approaches.\nIn contrast to these carefully hand-tuned approaches, Chen and Manning (2014) recently presented a neural network version of a greedy transition-based parser. In their model, a feedforward neural network with a hidden layer is used to make the transition decisions. The hidden layer has the power to learn arbitrary combinations of the atomic inputs, thereby eliminating the need for hand-engineered features. Furthermore, because the neural network uses a distributed representation, it is able to model lexical, part-of-speech (POS) tag, and arc label similarities in a continuous space. However, although their model outperforms its greedy hand-engineered counterparts, it is not competitive with state-of-the-art dependency parsers that are trained for structured search.\nIn this work, we combine the representational power of neural networks with the superior search enabled by structured training and inference, making our parser one of the most accurate dependency parsers to date. Training and testing on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), our transition-based parser achieves 93.99% unlabeled (UAS) / 92.05% labeled (LAS) attachment accuracy, outperforming the 93.22% UAS / 91.02% LAS of Zhang and McDonald (2014) and 93.27 UAS / 91.19 LAS of Bohnet and Kuhn (2012). In addition, by incorporating unlabeled data into training, we further improve the accuracy of our model to 94.26% UAS / 92.41% LAS (93.46% ar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n06 15\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n9 Ju\nn 20\n15\nUAS / 91.49% LAS for our greedy model).\nIn our approach we start with the basic structure of Chen and Manning (2014), but with a deeper architecture and improvements to the optimization procedure. These modifications (Section 2) increase the performance of the greedy model by as much as 1%. As in prior work, we train the neural network to model the probability of individual parse actions. However, we do not use these probabilities directly for prediction. Instead, we use the activations from all layers of the neural network as the representation in a structured perceptron model that is trained with beam search and early updates (Section 3). On the Penn Treebank, this structured learning approach significantly improves parsing accuracy by 0.8%.\nAn additional contribution of this work is an effective way to leverage unlabeled data. Neural networks are known to perform very well in the presence of large amounts of training data; however, obtaining more expert-annotated parse trees is very expensive. To this end, we generate large quantities of high-confidence parse trees by parsing unlabeled data with two different parsers and selecting only the sentences for which the two parsers produced the same trees (Section 3.3). This approach is known as “tri-training” (Li et al., 2014) and we show that it benefits our neural network parser significantly more than other approaches. By adding 10 million automatically parsed tokens to the training data, we improve the accuracy of our parsers by almost ∼1.0% on web domain data.\nWe provide an extensive exploration of our model in Section 5 through ablative analysis and other retrospective experiments. One of the goals of this work is to provide guidance for future refinements and improvements on the architecture and modeling choices we introduce in this paper.\nFinally, we also note that neural network representations have a long history in syntactic parsing (Henderson, 2004; Titov and Henderson, 2007; Titov and Henderson, 2010); however, like Chen and Manning (2014), our network avoids any recurrent structure so as to keep inference fast and efficient and to allow the use of simple backpropagation to compute gradients. Our work is also not the first to apply structured training to neural networks (see e.g. Peng et al. (2009) and Do and Artires (2010) for Conditional Random Field (CRF) training of neural networks).

We demonstrate empirically that beam search based on the scores from the neural network does not work as well, perhaps because of the label bias problem.\nA second contribution of this work is an effective way to leverage unlabeled data and other parsers. Neural networks are known to perform very well in the presence of large amounts of training data. It is however unlikely that the amount of hand parsed data will increase significantly because of the high cost for syntactic annotations. To this end we generate large quantities of high-confidence parse trees by parsing an unlabeled corpus and selecting only the sentences on which two different parsers produced the same parse trees. This idea comes from tri-training (Li et al., 2014) and while applicable to other parsers as well, we show that it benefits neural network parsers more than models with discrete features. Adding 10 million automatically parsed tokens to the training data improves the accuracy of our parsers further by 0.7%. Our final greedy parser achieves an unlabeled attachment score (UAS) of 93.46% on the Penn Treebank test set, while a model with a beam of size 8 produces an UAS of 94.08% (section 4. To the best of our knowledge, these are some of the very best dependency accuracies on this corpus.\nWe provide an extensive exploration of our\nmodel in section 5. In ablation experiments we\ntease apart our various contributions and modeling\nchoices in order to shed some light on what mat-\nters in practice. Neural network representations\nhave been used in structured models before (Peng\net al., 2009; Do and Artires, 2010), and have also\nbeen used for syntactic parsing (Titov and Henderson, 2007; Titov and Henderson, 2010), alas with fairly complex architectures and constraints. Our work on the other hand introduces a general approach for structured perceptron training with a neural network representation and achieves stateof-the-art parsing results for English.\n2 Neural Network Model\nIn this section, we describe the architecture of our model, which is summarized in figure 2.

Relu layers have been well studied in the neural network literature and have been shown to work well for a wide domain of problems (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Zeiler et al., 2013). Through most of development, we kept Mi = 200, but we found that significantly increasing the number of hidden units improved our results for the final comparison."

      "text" : "Our model is clearly inspired by and based on the work of Chen and Manning (2014). There are a few structural differences: (1) we allow for much smaller embeddings of POS tags and labels, (2) we use Relu units in our hidden layers, and (3) we use a deeper model with two hidden layers. Somewhat to our surprise, we found these changes combined with an SGD training scheme (Section 3.1) during the “pre-training” phase of the model to lead to an almost 1% accuracy gain over Chen and Manning (2014). This trend held despite carefully tuning hyperparameters for each method of training and structure combination.\nOur main contribution from an algorithmic perspective is our training procedure: as described in the next section, we use the structured perceptron for learning the final layer of our model. We thus present a novel way to leverage a neural network representation in a structured prediction setting."

There are two complementary contributions of our approach: (1) incorporating structured learning of the model and (2) utilizing unlabeled data. In both cases, we use the neural network to model the probability of each parsing action y as a soft-max function taking the final hidden layer as its input:\nP(y) ∝ exp{β>y hi + by}, (3)\nwhere βy is a Mi dimensional vector of weights for class y and i is the index of the final hidden layer of the network. At a high level our approach can be summarized as follows:\n• First, we pre-train the network’s hidden representations by learning probabilities of parsing actions. Fixing the hidden representations, we learn an additional final output layer using the structured perceptron that uses the output of the network’s hidden layers. In practice this improves accuracy by ∼0.6% absolute.\n• Next, we show that we can supplement the gold data with a large corpus of high quality\nautomatic parses. We show that incorporating unlabeled data in this way improves accuracy by as much as 1% absolute."

We use backpropagation to minimize the multinomial logistic loss:\nL(Θ) = − ∑\nj\nlog P(y j | c j,Θ) + λ ∑\ni\n||Wi||22, (4)\nwhere λ is a regularization hyper-parameter over the hidden layer parameters (we use λ = 10−4 in all experiments) and j sums over all decisions and configurations {y j, c j} extracted from gold parse trees in the dataset.\nThe specific update rule we apply at iteration t is as follows:\ngt = µgt−1 − ∆L(Θt), (5) Θt+1 = Θt + ηtgt, (6)\nwhere the descent direction gt is computed by a weighted combination of the previous direction gt−1and the current gradient ∆L(Θt). The parameter µ ∈ [0, 1) is the momentum parameter while ηt is the traditional learning rate. In addition, since we did not tune the regularization parameter λ, we apply a simple exponential step-wise decay to ηt; for every γ rounds of updates, we multiply ηt = 0.96ηt−1.\nThe final component of the update is parameter averaging: we maintain averaged parameters Θ̄t = αtΘ̄t−1 + (1 − αt)Θt, where αt is an averaging weight that increases from 0.1 to 0.9999 with 1/t. Combined with averaging, careful tuning of the three hyperparameters µ, η0, and γ using heldout data was crucial in our experiments."

      "heading" : "3.2 Structured Perceptron Training",
      "text" : "Given the hidden representations, we now describe how the perceptron can be trained to utilize these representations. The perceptron algorithm with early updates (Collins and Roark, 2004) requires a feature-vector definition φ that maps a sentence x together with a configuration c to a feature vector φ(x, c) ∈ Rd. There is a one-to-one mapping between configurations c and decision sequences\ny1 . . . y j−1 for any integer j ≥ 1: we will use c and y1 . . . y j−1 interchangeably.\nFor a sentence x, define GEN(x) to be the set of parse trees for x. Each y ∈ GEN(x) is a sequence of decisions y1 . . . ym for some integer m. We use Y to denote the set of possible decisions in the parsing model. For each decision y ∈ Y we assume a parameter vector v(y) ∈ Rd. These parameters will be trained using the perceptron.\nIn decoding with the perceptron-trained model, we will use beam search to attempt to find:\nargmax y∈GEN(x) m∑ j=1 v(y j) · φ(x, y1 . . . y j−1).\nThus each decision y j receives a score:\nv(y j) · φ(x, y1 . . . y j−1).\nIn the perceptron with early updates, the parameters v(y) are trained as follows. On each training example, we run beam search until the goldstandard parse tree falls out of the beam.1 Define j to be the length of the beam at this point. A structured perceptron update is performed using the gold-standard decisions y1 . . . y j as the target, and the highest scoring (incorrect) member of the beam as the negative example.\nA key idea in this paper is to use the neural network to define the representation φ(x, c). Given the sentence x and the configuration c, assuming two hidden layers, the neural network defines values for h1, h2, and P(y) for each decision y. We experimented with various definitions of φ (Section 5.2) and found that φ(x, c) = [h1 h2 P(y)] (the concatenation of the outputs from both hidden layers, as well as the probabilities for all decisions y possible in the current configuration) had the best accuracy on development data.\nNote that it is possible to continue to use backpropagation to learn the representation φ(x, c) during perceptron training; however, we found using ASGD to pre-train the representation always led to faster, more accurate results in preliminary experiments, and we left further investigation for future work."

      "text" : "Given the high capacity, non-linear nature of the deep network we hypothesize that our model can\n1If the gold parse tree stays within the beam until the end of the sentence, conventional perceptron updates are used.\nbe significantly improved by incorporating more data. One way to use unlabeled data is through unsupervised methods such as word clusters (Koo et al., 2008); we follow Chen and Manning (2014) and use pretrained word embeddings to initialize our model. The word embeddings capture similar distributional information as word clusters and give consistent improvements by providing a good initialization and information about words not seen in the treebank data.\nHowever, obtaining more training data is even more important than a good initialization. One potential way to obtain additional training data is by parsing unlabeled data with previously trained models. McClosky et al. (2006) and Huang and Harper (2009) showed that iteratively re-training a single model (“self-training”) can be used to improve parsers in certain settings; Petrov et al. (2010) built on this work and showed that a slow and accurate parser can be used to “up-train” a faster but less accurate parser.\nIn this work, we adopt the “tri-training” approach of Li et al. (2014): Two parsers are used to process the unlabeled corpus and only sentences for which both parsers produced the same parse tree are added to the training data. The intuition behind this idea is that the chance of the parse being correct is much higher when the two parsers agree: there is only one way to be correct, while there are many possible incorrect parses. Of course, this reasoning holds only as long as the parsers suffer from different biases.\nWe show that tri-training is far more effective than vanilla up-training for our neural network model. We use same setup as Li et al. (2014), intersecting the output of the BerkeleyParser (Petrov et al., 2006), and a reimplementation of ZPar (Zhang and Nivre, 2011) as our baseline parsers. The two parsers agree only 36% of the time on the tune set, but their accuracy on those sentences is 97.26% UAS, approaching the inter annotator agreement rate. These sentences are of course easier to parse, having an average length of 15 words, compared to 24 words for the tune set overall. However, because we only use these sentences to extract individual transition decisions, the shorter length does not seem to hurt their utility. We generate 107 tokens worth of new parses and use this data in the backpropagation stage of training."

For the WSJ experiments, we follow standard practice and use sections 2-21 for training, section 22 for development and section 23 as the final test set. Since there are many hyperparameters in our models, we additionally use section 24 for tuning. We convert the constituency trees to Stanford style dependencies (De Marneffe et al., 2006) using version 3.3.0 of the converter. We use a CRF-based POS tagger to generate 5- fold jack-knifed POS tags on the training set and predicted tags on the dev, test and tune sets; our tagger gets comparable accuracy to the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) with 97.44% on the test set. We report unlabeled attachment score (UAS) and labeled attachment score (LAS) excluding punctuation on predicted POS tags, as is standard for English.\nFor the second set of experiments, we follow the same procedure as above, but with a more diverse dataset for training and evaluation. Following Vinyals et al. (2015), we use (in addition to the WSJ), the OntoNotes corpus version 5 (Hovy et al., 2006), the English Web Treebank (Petrov and McDonald, 2012), and the updated and corrected Question Treebank (Judge et al., 2006). We train on the union of each corpora’s training set and test on each domain separately. We refer to this setup as the “Treebank Union” setup.\nIn our semi-supervised experiments, we use the corpus from Chelba et al. (2013) as our source of unlabeled data. We process it with the BerkeleyParser (Petrov et al., 2006), a latent variable constituency parser, and a reimplementation of ZPar (Zhang and Nivre, 2011), a transition-based parser with beam search. Both parsers are included as baselines in our evaluation. We select the first 107 tokens for which the two parsers agree as additional training data. For our tri-training experiments, we re-train the POS tagger using the POS tags assigned on the unlabeled data from the Berkeley constituency parser.

On the WSJ and Web tasks, our parser outperforms all dependency parsers in our comparison by a substantial margin.

Although tritraining did help the baseline on the dev set (Figure 4), test set performance did not improve significantly. In contrast, it is quite exciting to see that after tri-training, even our greedy parser is more accurate than any of the baseline dependency parsers and competitive with the BerkeleyParser used to generate the tri-training data. As expected, tri-training helps most dramatically to increase accuracy on the Treebank Union setup with diverse domains, yielding 0.4-1.0% absolute LAS improvement gains for our most accurate model.\nUnfortunately we are not able to compare to several semi-supervised dependency parsers that achieve some of the highest reported accuracies on the WSJ, in particular Suzuki et al. (2009), Suzuki et al. (2011) and Chen et al. (2013). These parsers use the Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) dependency conversion and the accuracies are therefore not directly comparable. The highest of these is Suzuki et al. (2011), with a reported accuracy of 94.22% UAS. Even though the UAS is not directly comparable, it is typically similar, and this suggests that our model is competitive with some of the highest reported accuries for dependencies on WSJ."

In fact, while the overall UAS scores of the tune set and dev set are strongly correlated (ρ = 0.64, p < 10−10), they are not significantly correlated if pre-trained embeddings are not used (ρ = 0.12, p > 0.3). This suggests that an additional benefit of pre-trained embeddings, aside from allowing learning to reach a more accurate solution, is to push learning towards a solution that generalizes to more data.\nDiminishing returns with increasing embedding dimensions. For these experiments, we fixed one embedding type to a high value and reduced the dimensionality of all others to very small values. The results are plotted in Figure 3, suggesting larger embeddings do not significantly improve results. We also ran tri-training on a very compact model with Dword = 8 and Dtag = Dlabel = 2 (8× fewer parameters than our full model) which resulted in 92.33% UAS accuracy on the dev set. This is comparable to the full model without tri-training, suggesting that more training data can compensate for fewer parameters.\nIncreasing hidden units yields large gains. For these experiments, we fixed the embedding sizes Dword = 64, Dtag = Dlabel = 32 and tried increasing and decreasing the dimensionality of the hidden layers on a logarthmic scale. Improvements in accuracy did not appear to saturate even with increasing the number of hidden units by an order of magnitude, though the network became too slow to train effectively past M = 2048. These results suggest that there are still gains to be made by increasing the efficiency of larger networks, even for greedy shift-reduce parsers."

      "text" : "We now turn our attention to the importance of structured perceptron training as well as the impact of different latent representations.\nBias reduction through structured training. To evaluate the impact of structured training, we\ncompare using the estimates P(y) from the neural network directly for beam search to using the activations from all layers as features in the structured perceptron. Using the probability estimates directly is very similar to Ratnaparkhi (1997), where a maximum-entropy model was used to model the distribution over possible actions at each parser state, and beam search was used to search for the highest probability parse. A known problem with beam search in this setting is the label-bias problem. Table 5 shows the impact of using structured perceptron training over using the softmax function during beam search as a function of the beam size used. For reference, our reimplementation of Zhang and Nivre (2011) is trained equivalently for each setting. We also show the impact on beam size when tri-training is used. Although the beam does marginally improve accuracy for the softmax model, much greater gains are achieved when perceptron training is used.\nUsing all hidden layers crucial for structured perceptron. We also investigated the impact of connecting the final perceptron layer to all prior hidden layers (Table 6). Our results suggest that all intermediate layers of the network are indeed discriminative. Nonetheless, aggregating all of their activations proved to be the most effective representation for the structured perceptron. This suggests that the representations learned by the network collectively contain the information re-\nquired to reduce the bias of the model, but not when filtered through the softmax layer. Finally, we also experimented with connecting both hidden layers to the softmax layer during backpropagation training, but we found this did not significantly affect the performance of the greedy model."

      "text" : "To evaluate the impact of the tri-training approach, we compared to up-training with the BerkelyParser (Petrov et al., 2006) alone. The results are summarized in Figure 4 for the greedy and perceptron neural net models as well as our reimplementated Zhang and Nivre (2011) baseline.\nFor our neural network model, training on the output of the BerkeleyParser yields only modest gains, while training on the data where the two parsers agree produces significantly better results. This was especially pronounced for the greedy models: after tri-training, the greedy neural network model surpasses the BerkeleyParser in accuracy. It is also interesting to note that up-training improved results far more than tri-training for the baseline. We speculate that this is due to the a lack of diversity in the tri-training data for this model, since the same baseline model was intersected with the BerkeleyParser to generate the tritraining data."

We inspected the learned perceptron weights v for the softmax probabilities P(y) (see Appendix) and found that the perceptron reweights the softmax probabilities based on common confusions; e.g. a strong negative weight for the action RIGHT(ccomp) given the softmax model outputs RIGHT(conj). Note\nthat this trend did not hold when φ(x, c) = [P(y)]; without the hidden layer, the perceptron was not able to reweight the softmax probabilities to account for the greedy model’s biases."

We then combined this approach with unlabeled data and tri-training to further push state-of-the-art in semi-supervised dependency parsing. Nonetheless, our ablative analysis suggests that further gains are possible simply by scaling up our system to even larger representations. In future work, we will apply our method to other languages, explore end-to-end training of the system using structured learning, and scale up the method to larger datasets and network structures."

Transition-based parsers (Nivre, 2008) have been shown to provide a good balance between efficiency and accuracy. In transition-based parsing, sentences are processed in a linear left to right pass; at each position, the parser needs to choose from a set of possible actions defined by the transition strategy. In greedy models, a classifier is used to independently decide which transition to take based on local features of the current parse configuration. This classifier typically uses hand-engineered features and is trained on individual transitions extracted from the gold transition sequence. While extremely fast, these greedy models typically suffer from search errors due to the inability to recover from incorrect decisions. Zhang and Clark (2008) showed that a beamsearch decoding algorithm utilizing the structured perceptron training algorithm can greatly improve accuracy.",

We also provide indepth ablative analysis to determine which aspects of our model provide the largest gains in accuracy.",
