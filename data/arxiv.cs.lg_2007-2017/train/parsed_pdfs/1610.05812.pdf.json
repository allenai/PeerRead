XXX, 2017 1\nSmall-footprint Highway Deep Neural Networks for Speech Recognition\nLiang Lu Member, IEEE, Steve Renals Fellow, IEEE\nAbstract—State-of-the-art speech recognition systems typically employ neural network acoustic models. However, compared to Gaussian mixture models, deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic models often have many more model parameters, making it challenging for them to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile devices. In this paper, we study the application of the recently proposed highway deep neural network (HDNN) for training small-footprint acoustic models. HDNNs are a depth-gated feedforward neural network, which include two types of gate functions to facilitate the information flow through different layers. Our study demonstrates that HDNNs are more compact than regular DNNs for acoustic modeling, i.e., they can achieve comparable recognition accuracy with many fewer model parameters. Furthermore, HDNNs are more controllable than DNNs: the gate functions of an HDNN can control the behavior of the whole network using a very small number of model parameters. Finally, we show that HDNNs are more adaptable than DNNs. For example, simply updating the gate functions using adaptation data can result in considerable gains in accuracy. We demonstrate these aspects by experiments using the publicly available AMI corpus, which has around 80 hours of training data.\nIndex Terms—Deep learning, Highway networks, Smallfootprint models, Speech recognition\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDEEP Learning has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in speech recognition over the past few years [1]– [3]. Most speech recognisers now employ the neural network and hidden Markov model (NN/HMM) hybrid architecture, first investigated in the early 1990s [4], [5]. Compared to those models, current neural network acoustic models tend to be larger and deeper, made possible by faster computing such as general-purpose graphic processing units (GPGPUs). Furthermore, more complex neural architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have received intensive research, resulting in a range of flexible and powerful neural network architectures that have been applied to a range of tasks in speech, image and natural language processing.\nDespite their success, neural network models have been criticized as lacking structure, being resistant to interpretation, and possessing limited adaptablity. Furthermore accurate neural network acoustic models reported in the research literature\nManuscript received -; revised - Liang Lu is with Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, and Steve Renals is with The University of Edinburgh, UK; email: llu@ttic.edu, s.renals@ed.ac.uk\nThe research was supported by EPSRC Programme Grant grant EP/I031022/1 Natural Speech Technology (NST) and the European Union under H2020 project SUMMA, grant agreement 688139.\nhave tended to be much larger than conventional Gaussian mixture models, thus making it challenging to deploy them on resource constrained embedded or mobile platforms when cloud computing solutions are not appropriate (due to the unavailability of an internet connection or for privacy reasons). Recently, there has been considerable work to reduce the size of neural network acoustic models while limiting any reduction in recognition accuracy, such as the use of lowrank matrices [6], [7], teacher-student training [8]–[10], and structured linear layers [11]–[13]. Smaller footprint models may also bring advantages in requiring less training data, and in being potentially more adaptable to changing target domains, environments or speakers, owing to having fewer model parameters.\nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive study of smallfootprint acoustic models using highway deep neural networks (HDNNs), building on our previous studies [14]–[16]. HDNNs are multi-layer networks which have shortcut connections between hidden layers [17]. Compared to regular multi-layer networks with skip connections, HDNNs are additionally equipped with two gate functions – transform and carry gates – which control and facilitate the information flow throughout the whole network. In particular, the transform gate scales the output of a hidden layer, and the carry gate is used to pass through a layer input directly after element-wise rescaling. These gate functions are central to training very deep networks [17] and to speeding up convergence [14]. We show that for speech recognition, recognition accuracy can be retained by increasing the depth of the network, while the number of hidden units in each hidden layer can be significantly reduced. As a result, HDNNs are much thinner and deeper with many fewer model parameters. Besides, in contrast to training regular multi-layer networks of the same depth and width, which typically requires careful pretraining, we demonstrate that HDNNs may be trained using standard stochastic gradient descent without any pretraining [14]. To further reduce the number of model parameters, we propose a variant of HDNN architecture by sharing the gate units across all the hidden layers. Furthermore, The authors in [17] only studied the constrained carry gate setting for HDNNs, while in this work we provide detailed comparisons of different gate functions in the context of speech recognition.\nWe also investigate the roles of the two gate functions in HDNNs using both cross-entropy (CE) training and sequence training, and We present a different way to investigate and understand the effect of gate units in neural networks from the point of view of regularization and adaptation. Our key observation is that the gate functions can manipulate the\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n05 81\n2v 4\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n5 A\npr 2\n01 7"

For instance, if we do not update the model parameters in the hidden layers and/or the softmax layer during sequence training, and only update the gate functions, then we are able to retain most of the improvement by sequence training. Moreover, the regularization term in the sequence training objective is not required when only updating the gate functions. Since the size of the gate functions are relatively small, we can achieve a considerable gain by only fine tuning these parameters for unsupervised speaker adaptation, which is a strong advantage of this model. Finally, we investigate teacher-student training, and its combination with sequence training, as well as speaker adaptation to further improve the accuracy of the small-size HDNN acoustic models. Our teacher-student training experiments also provide more results to understand this technique in the sequence training and adaptation setting.\nOverall, a small-footprint HDNN acoustic model with 5 million model parameters achieved slightly better accuracy compared to a DNN system with 30 million parameters, while the HDNN model with 2 million parameters achieved only slightly lower accuracy compared to that DNN system. Finally, the recognition accuracy of a much smaller HDNN model (less than 0.8 million model parameters) can be significantly improved by teacher-student style training, narrowing the gap between this model and the much larger DNN system."

Although recurrent neural networks with long shortterm memory units (LSTM-RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can obtain higher recognition accuracy with fewer model parameters compared to DNNs [18], [19], they are computationally more expensive for applications on resource constrained platforms. Moreover, their accuracy can be transferred to a DNN by teacher-student training [?], [20], [21].\nA multi-layer network with L hidden layers is represented as\nh1 = σ(x, θ1) (1) hl = σ(hl−1, θl), for l = 2, . . . , L (2) y = g(hL, θc) (3)\nwhere: x is an input feature vector; σ(h(l−1)t , θl) denotes the transformation of the input h(l−1)t with the parameter θl followed by a nonlinear activation function σ, e.g., sigmoid; g(·, θc) is the output function that is parameterized by θc in the output layer, which usually uses the softmax to obtain the posterior probability of each class given the input feature. To facilitate our discussion later on, we denote θh={θ1, · · · , θL} as the set of neural network parameters.\nGiven target labels, the network is usually trained by gradient descent to minimize a loss function such as cross-entropy. However, as the number of hidden layers increases, the error surface becomes increasingly non-convex, and it becomes\nmore likely to find a poor local minimum using gradientbased optimization algorithms with random initialization [22]. Furthermore the variance of the back-propagated gradients may become small in the lower layers if the model parameters are not initialized properly [23]."

Highway deep neural networks (HDNNs) [17] were proposed to enable very deep networks to be trained by augmenting the hidden layers with gate functions:\nhl = σ(hl−1, θl) ◦ T (hl−1,WT ) + hl−1 ◦ C(hl−1,Wc) (4)\nwhere: hl denotes the hidden activations of l-th layer; T (·) is the transform gate that scales the original hidden activations; C(·) is the carry gate, which scales the input before passing it directly to the next hidden layer; and ◦ denotes elementwise multiplication. The outputs of T (·) and C(·) are constrained to be within [0, 1], and we use a sigmoid function for each, parameterized by WT and Wc respectively. Following our previous work [14], we tie the parameters in the gate functions across all the hidden layers, which can significantly save model parameters. Untying the gate functions did not result in any gain in our preliminary experiments. In this work, we do not use any bias vector in the two gate functions. Since the parameters in T (·) and C(·) are layer-independent, we denote θg = (WT ,Wc), and we will look into the specific roles of these model parameters in sequence training and model adaptation experiments.\nWithout the transform gate, i.e. T (·) = 1, the highway network is similar to a network with skip connections – the main difference is that the input is firstly scaled by the carry gate. If the carry gate is set to zero, i.e. C(·) = 0, the second term in (4) is dropped,\nhl = σ(hl−1, θl) ◦ T (hl−1,WT ), (5)\nresulting in a model that is similar to dropout regularization [28], which may be written as\nhl = σ(hl−1, θl) ◦ , i ∼ p( i), (6)\nwhere p( i) is a Bernoulli distribution for the i-th element in as originally proposed in [28]; it was shown later that using a continuous distribution with well designed mean and variance works as well or better [29]. From this perspective, the transform gate may work as a regularizer, but with the key difference that T (·) is a deterministic function, while i is drawn stochastically from a predefined distribution in dropout. The network in (5) is also related to LHUC (Learning Hidden Unit Contribution) adaptation for multilayer acoustic models [30], [31], which may be represented as\nhsl = a(r s l ) ◦ σ(hsl−1, θl) (7)\n3 where: rsl is a speaker dependent vector for l-th hidden layer, and hsl is the speaker adapted hidden activations; s is the speaker index; and a(·) is a nonlinear function. The model in (5) can be seen as an extension of LHUC in which rsl is parameterized as WThl−1. We shall investigate the update of WT for speaker adaptation in the experimental section.\nAlthough there are more computational steps for each hidden layer compared to regular DNNs due to the gate functions, the training speed will be improved if the size of the weight matrices are smaller. Furthermore, the matrices can be packed together as\nW̃l = [ W>l ,W > T ,W > c ]> , (8)\nwhere W>l is the weight matrix in the l-th layer, and we then compute W̃lhl−1. This approach, applied at the minibatch level, allows more efficient matrix computation when using GPUs."

However, the gates in LSTMs are designed to control the information flow through time and to model along temporal dependencies; for HDNNs, the gates are used to facilitate the information flow through the depth of the model. Combinations of the two architectures have been explored recently: highway LSTMs [33] employ highway connections to train a stacked LSTM with multiple layers; recurrent highway networks [34] share gate functions to control the information flow in both time and model depth. On the other hand, the residual network (ResNet) [35] was recently proposed to train very deep networks, advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision. ResNets are closely related to highway networks in the sense that they also rely on skip connections for training very deep networks; however, gate functions are not employed in ResNets (which can save some computational cost). Finally, adapting approaches developed for visual object recognition [36], very deep CNN architectures have been investigated for speech recognition [37]."

Minimizing this loss function is equivalent to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the posterior probabilities of each class from the teacher and student models [8]. Here, ỹjt is no longer a one-hot vector; instead, the competing classes will have small but nonzero posterior probabilities for each training example. Hinton et al. [38] suggested that the small posterior probabilities are valuable information that encode correlations among different classes. However, their roles may be very small in the loss function as these probabilities are close to zero due to the softmax function.

This motivates the investigation of the adaptation of highway gates by only fine tuning these model parameters. Although the number of parameters in the gate functions is still large compared to the amount of per-speaker adaptation data, the size of the gate functions may be controlled by reducing the number of hidden units, but maintaining the accuracy by increasing the depth [14].

Table I shows that the HDNNs achieved consistently lower WERs compared to the DNNs; the margin of the gain also increases as the number of hidden units becomes smaller. As the number of hidden units decreases, the accuracy of DNNs degrades rapidly, and the accuracy loss cannot be compensated by increasing the depth of the network. The results also show that sequence training improves the recognition accuracy comparably for both DNN and HDNN systems, and the improvements are consistent for both dev and eval sets.

We can see that using only one of the two gates, the HDNN can still achieve lower WER compared to the regular DNN baseline, but the best results are obtained when both gates are active, indicating that the two gating functions are\n5\ncomplementary. Figure 1 shows the convergence curves of training HDNNs with and without the transform and carry gates. We observe faster convergence when both gates are active, with considerably slower convergence when using only the transform gate. This indicates that the carry gate, which controls the skip connections, is more important to the convergence rate. We also investigated constrained gates, in which C(·) = 1−T (·) [17], which reduces the computational cost since the matrix-vector multiplication for the carry gate is not required. We evaluated this configuration with 10-layer neural networks, and the results are also shown in Table II: this approach does not improve recognition accuracy in our experiments.\nTo look into the relative importance of the gate functions to other type of model parameters in the feature extractor and classification layer, we also performed a set of ablation experiments with sequence training, where we removed the update of different sets of model parameters (after CE training). These results are given in Table III, which shows that only updating the parameters in the gates θg can retain most of the improvement given by sequence training, while updating θg and θc can achieve the accuracies close to the optimum. Although θg only accounts for a small fraction of the total number of parameters (e.g., ∼ 10% for the HDNN-H512L10 system and ∼ 7% for the HDNN-H256L10 system), the results demonstrate that it plays an important role in manipulating the behavior of the neural network feature extractor.\nComplementary to the above experiments, we then investigated the effect of the regularization term for sequence training\nof HDNNs (16). We performed the experiments with and without the CE regularization for two system settings, i.e.: i) update all the model parameters; ii) update only the gate functions. Our motivation was to validate if only updating the gate parameters is more resistant to overfitting. The results are given in Table IV, from which we see that by removing the CE regularization term, we achieved slightly lower WER when updating the gate functions only. However, when updating all model parameters, the regularization term was an important stabilizer for the convergence. Figure 2 shows the convergence curves for the two system settings.

Note that, since the sequence training criterion does not maximize the frame accuracy, training the model with this criterion often reduces the frame accuracy (see Figure 6 of [48]).

Figure 6 shows the convergence curves of using CE and sMBR based teacher models, where we see that the student model achieves much higher frame error rate on the cross validation set when supervised by sMBR-based teacher model, although the loss function (11) is at the frame level.\nWe then investigated whether the accuracy of the student model can be further improved by the sequence level criterion.

We then increased the value of p to enable stronger regularization and reduced the learning rate. Lower WERs were obtained as the table shows; however, the improvement is less significant as the sequence level information has already been integrated into the teacher model."

      "text" : "We then performed similar adaptation experiments to section IV-D for HDNNs trained by the teacher-student approach. We applied the second-pass adaptation approach for the standalone HDNN model, i.e., we decoded the evaluation utterances to obtain the hard labels first, and then used these labels to adapt the model using the CE loss (10). However, when using the teacher-student loss (11) only one-pass decoding is required because the pseudo-labels for adaptation are provided by the teacher, which does not need a word level transcription. This is a particular advantage of the teacherstudent training technique. However, for resource-constrained application scenarios, the student model should be adapted offline, because otherwise the teacher model needs to be accessed to generate the labels. This requires another set of unlabelled speaker-dependent data for adaptation, which is usually not expensive to collect.\nSince the standard AMI corpus does not have an additional set of speaker-dependent data, we only show online adaptation results. We used the teacher-student trained model from row 1 of Table VII as the speaker-independent (SI) model because its pipeline is much simpler. The baseline system used the same network as the SI model, but it was trained independently. During adaptation, we updated the SI model using 5 iterations with a fixed learning rate of 2 × 10−4 per sample following our previous setup [15]. We also compared the CE loss (10) and the teacher-student loss (11) for adaptation (Table VIII). When using the CE loss function for both SI models, slightly better results wer obtained when updating the gates only, while updating all the model parameters gave smaller improvements, possibly due to overfitting. Interestingly, this is not the case for the teacher-student loss, where updating all the model parameters yielded lower WER. These results are also in line with the argument in [38] that the soft targets can work as a regularizer and can prevent the student model from overfitting."

      "text" : "We summarize our key results in Table IX. Overall, the HDNN acoustic model can slightly outperform the sequence trained baseline using around 5 million model parameters after adapting the gate functions; using fewer than 2 million model parameters it performed slightly worse. If fewer than 0.8 million parameters are used, then the gap is much larger\n9\ncompared to the DNN baseline. With adaptation and teacherstudent training, we can close the gap by around 50%, with difference in WER falling from roughly 5% absolute to 2.5% absolute."

      "heading" : "V. CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "Highway deep neural networks are structured, depth-gated feedforward neural networks. In this paper, we studied sequence training and adaptation of these networks for acoustic modeling. In particular, we investigated the roles of the parameters in the hidden layers, gate functions and classification layer in the case of sequence training. We show that the gate functions, which only account for a small fraction of the whole parameter set, are able to control the information flow and adjust the behavior of the neural network feature extractors. We demonstrate this in both sequence training and adaptation experiments, in which considerable improvements were achieved by only updating the gate functions. Using these techniques, we obtained comparable or slightly lower WERs with much smaller acoustic models compared to a strong baseline set by a conventional DNN acoustic model with sequence training. Since the number of model parameters is still relatively large compared to the amount of data typically used for speaker adaptation, this adaptation technique may be more applicable to domain adaptation, where the expected amount of adaptation data is larger.\nFurthermore, we also investigated teacher-student training for small-footprint acoustic models using HDNNs. We observed that the accuracy of the student acoustic model could be improved under the supervision of a high accuracy teacher model, even without additional unsupervised data. In particular, the student model supervised by an sMBRbased teacher model achieved lower WER compared to the model trained independently using the sMBR-based sequence training approach. Unsupervised speaker adaptation further improved the recognition accuracy by around 5% relative for a model with fewer then 0.8 million model parameters. However, we did not obtain improvements either using a hybrid loss function which interpolates the CE and teacher-student loss functions, or using a higher temperature to smooth the pseudolabels. In the future, we shall evaluate this model in low resource conditions where the amount of training data is much smaller."

HDNNs are a depth-gated feedforward neural network, which include two types of gate functions to facilitate the information flow through different layers. Our study demonstrates that HDNNs are more compact than regular DNNs for acoustic modeling, i.e., they can achieve comparable recognition accuracy with many fewer model parameters. Furthermore, HDNNs are more controllable than DNNs: the gate functions of an HDNN can control the behavior of the whole network using a very small number of model parameters. Finally, we show that HDNNs are more adaptable than DNNs. For example, simply updating the gate functions using adaptation data can result in considerable gains in accuracy. We demonstrate these aspects by experiments using the publicly available AMI corpus, which has around 80 hours of training data.",
