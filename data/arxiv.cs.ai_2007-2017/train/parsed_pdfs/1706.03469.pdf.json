      "text" : "Many sequential decision problems, including diabetes treatment (Bastani, 2014), digital marketing (Theocharous et al., 2015), and robot control (Lillicrap et al., 2015), are modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and solved using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. One important problem when applying RL to real problems is policy evaluation. The goal in policy evaluation is to estimate the expected return (sum of rewards) produced by a policy. We refer to this policy as the evaluation policy, πe. The standard policy evaluation approach is to repeatedly deploy πe and average the resulting returns. While this naı̈ve Monte Carlo estimator is unbiased, it may have high variance.\n1The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA 2The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA 3Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

Copyright 2017 by the author(s).\nMethods that evaluate πe while selecting actions according to πe are termed on-policy. Previous work has addressed variance reduction for on-policy returns (Zinkevich et al., 2006; White & Bowling, 2009; Veness et al., 2011). An alternative approach is to estimate the performance of πe while following a different, behavior policy, πb. Methods that evaluate πe with data generated from πb are termed offpolicy. Importance sampling (IS) is one standard approach for using off-policy data in RL. IS reweights returns observed while executing πb such that they are unbiased estimates of the performance of πe.\nPresently, IS is usually used when off-policy data is already available or when executing πe is impractical. If πb is not chosen carefully, IS often has high variance (Thomas et al., 2015). For this reason, an implicit assumption in the RL community has generally been that on-policy evaluation is more accurate when it is feasible. However, IS can also be used for variance reduction when done with an appropriately selected distribution of returns (Hammersley & Handscomb, 1964). While IS-based variance reduction has been explored in RL, this prior work has required knowledge of the environment’s transition probabilities and remains onpolicy (Desai & Glynn, 2001; Frank et al., 2008; Ciosek & Whiteson, 2017). In contrast to this earlier work, we show how careful selection of the behavior policy can lead to lower variance policy evaluation than using the evaluation policy and do not require knowledge of the environment’s transition probabilities.\nIn this paper, we formalize the selection of πb as the behavior policy search problem. We introduce a method for this problem that adapts the policy parameters of πb with gradient descent on the variance of importance-sampling. Empirically we demonstrate behavior policy search with our method lowers the mean squared error of estimates compared to on-policy estimates. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose adapting the behavior policy to obtain better policy evaluation in RL. Furthermore we present the first method to address this problem."

Let ρ(π) := E[g(H)|H ∼ π] be the expected discounted return when the stochastic policy π is used from S0 sampled from the initial state distribution. In this work, we consider parameterized policies, πθ, where the distribution over actions is determined by the vector θ. We assume that the transitions and reward function are unknown and that L is finite.\nWe are given an evaluation policy, πe, for which we would like to estimate ρ(πe). We assume there exists a policy parameter vector θe such that πe = πθe and that this vector is known. We consider an incremental setting where, at iteration i, we sample a single trajectory Hi with a policy πθi and add {Hi,θi} to a set D. We use Di to denote the set at iteration i. Methods that always (i.e., ∀i) choose θi = θe are on-policy; otherwise, the method is off-policy. A policy evaluation method, PE, uses all trajectories in Di to estimate ρ(πe). Our goal is to design a policy evaluation algorithm that produces estimates of ρ(πe) that have low mean squared error (MSE). Formally, the goal of policy evaluation with PE is to minimize (PE(Di)− ρ(πe))2. While other measures of policy evaluation accuracy could be considered, we follow earlier work in using MSE (e.g., (Thomas & Brunskill, 2016; Precup et al., 2000)).\nWe focus on unbiased estimators of ρ(πe). While biased estimators (e.g., bootstrapping methods (Sutton & Barto, 1998), approximate models (Kearns & Singh, 2002), etc.) can sometimes produce lower MSE estimates they are problematic for high risk applications requiring confidence intervals.

In this section we first describe the theoretical potential for variance reduction with an appropriately selected behavior policy. In general this policy will be unknown.

While this fact is generally known for importance-sampling, we show here that this policy exists for any MDP and evaluation policy under two restrictive assumptions: all returns are positive and the domain is deterministic. In the following section we describe how an initial policy can be adapted towards the optimal behavior policy even when these conditions fail to hold.\nLet wπ(H) := ∏L t=0 π(At|St). Consider a behavior policy π?b such that for any trajectory, H:\nρ(πe) = IS(H,π ? b ) = g(H)\nwπe(H) wπ?b (H) .\nRearranging the terms of this expressions yields:\nwπ?b (H) = g(H) wπe(H)\nρ(πe) .\nThus, if we can select π?b such that the probability of observing any H ∼ π?b is g(H) ρ(πe)\ntimes the likelihood of observing H ∼ πe then the IS estimate has zero MSE with only a single sampled trajectory. Regardless of g(H), the importance-sampled return will equal ρ(πe).\nFurthermore, the policy π?b exists within the space of all feasible stochastic policies. Consider that a stochastic policy can be viewed as a mixture policy over time-dependent (i.e., action selection depends on the current time-step) deterministic policies. For example, in an MDP with one state, two actions and a horizon of L there are 2L possible time-dependent deterministic policies, each of which\ndefines a unique sequence of actions. We can express any evaluation policy as a mixture of these deterministic policies. The optimal behavior policy π?b can be expressed similarly and thus the optimal behavior policy exists.\nUnfortunately, the optimal behavior policy depends on the unknown value ρ(πe) as well as the unknown reward function R (via g(H)). Thus, while there exists an optimal behavior policy for IS – which is not πe – in practice we cannot analytically determine π?b . Additionally, π ? b may not be representable by any θ in our policy class."

A BPS problem is defined by the inputs:\n1. An evaluation policy πe with policy parameters θe. 2. An off-policy policy evaluation algorithm,\nOPE(H,θ), that takes a trajectory, H ∼ πθ, or, alternatively, a set of trajectories, and returns an estimate of ρ(πe).\nA BPS solution is a policy, πθb such that off-policy estimates with OPE have lower MSE than on-policy estimates. Methods for this problem are BPS algorithms.\nRecall we have formalized policy evaluation within an incremental setting where one trajectory for policy evaluation is generated each iteration. At the ith iteration, a BPS algorithm selects a behavior policy that will be used to generate a trajectory, Hi. The policy evaluation algorithm, OPE, then estimates ρ(πe) using trajectories in Di. Naturally, the selection of the behavior policy depends on how OPE estimates ρ(πe).\nIn a BPS problem, the ith iteration proceeds as follows. First, given all of the past behavior policies, {θi}i−1i=0, and the resulting trajectories, {Hi}i−1i=0, the BPS algorithm must select θi. The policy πθi is then run for one episode to create the trajectory Hi. Then the BPS algorithm uses OPE to estimate ρ(πe) given the available data, Di := {(θi, Hi)}ii=0. In this paper, we consider the one-step problem of selecting θi and estimating ρ(πe) at iteration i in a way that minimizes MSE. That is, we do not consider how our selection of θi will impact our future ability to select an appropriate θj for j > i and thus to produce more accurate estimates in the future.\nOne natural question is: if we are given a limit on the number of trajectories that can be sampled, is it better to “spend” some of our limited trajectories on BPS instead of using on-policy estimates? Since each OPE(Hi,θi) is an unbiased estimator of ρ(πe), we can use all sampled trajectories to compute OPE(Di). Provided for all itera-\ntions, Var[OPE(H,θi)] ≤ V ar[MC] then, in expectation, a BPS algorithm will always achieve lower MSE than MC, showing that it is, in fact, worthwhile to do so. This claim is supported by our empirical study."

The gradient of the MSE with respect to the policy parameters is given by the following theorem: Theorem 1.\n∂\n∂θ MSE[IS(H,θ)] = E\n[ − IS(H,θ)2\nL∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(At|St)\n]\nwhere the expectation is taken over H ∼ πθ.\nProof.

In our experiments, we sample a batch, Bi, of k trajectories with πθi to lower the variance of the gradient estimate at iteration i. In the BPS setting, sampling a batch of trajectories is equivalent to holding θ fixed for k iterations and then updating θ with the k most recent trajectories used to compute the gradient estimate.\nFull details of BPG are given in Algorithm 1. At iteration i, BPG samples a batch, Bi, of k trajectories and adds {(θi, Hi)ki=0} to a data set D (Lines 4-5). Then BPG updates θ with an empirical estimate of Theorem 1 (Line 6). After n iterations, the BPG estimate of ρ(πe) is IS(Dn) as defined in Section 2.4.\nGiven that the step-size, αi, is consistent with standard gradient descent convergence conditions, BPG will converge to a behavior policy that locally minimizes the variance (Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis, 2000). At best, BPG converges to the globally optimal behavior policy within the parameterization of πe. Since the parameterization of πe determines the class of representable distributions it is possible that the theoretically optimal behavior policy is unrepresentable under this parameterization. Nevertheless, a suboptimal behavior policy still yields better estimates of ρ(πe), provided it decreases variance compared to on-policy returns.\nAlgorithm 1 Behavior Policy Gradient Input: Evaluation policy parameters, θe, batch size k, a step-size for each iteration, αi, and number of iterations n.

This update increases the probability of actions that lead to high return trajectories. BPG can be interpreted as REINFORCE where the return of a trajectory is the square of its importance-sampled return. Thus BPG increases the probability of all actions taken along H as a function of IS(H,θ)2. The magnitude of IS(H,θ)2 depends on two qualities of H:\n1. g(H)2 is large (i.e., a high magnitude event). 2. H is rare relative to its probability under the evalua-\ntion policy (i.e., ∏L t=0 πe(At|St) πθ(At|St) is large).\nThese two qualities demonstrate a balance in how BPG changes trajectory probabilities. Increasing the probability of a trajectory under πθ will decrease IS(H,θ)2 and so BPG increases the probability of a trajectory when g(H)2 is large enough to offset the decrease in IS(H,θ)2 caused by decreasing the importance weight."

Our main point of comparison is the mean squared error (MSE) of both estimates at iteration i over 100 trials. For π1, BPG significantly reduces the MSE of on-policy estimates (Figure 1a). For π2, BPG also reduces MSE, however, it is only a marginal improvement.\nAt the end of each trial we used the final behavior policy to collect 100 more trajectories and estimate ρ(πe). In comparison to a Monte Carlo estimate with 100 trajectories from π1, MSE is 85.48 % lower with this improved behavior policy. For π2, the MSE is 31.02 % lower. This result demonstrates that BPG can find behavior policies that substantially lower MSE.\nTo understand the disparity in performance between these two instances of policy evaluation, we plot the distribution of g(H) under πe (Figures 1c and 1d). These plots show the variance of π1 to be much higher; it sometimes samples returns with twice the magnitude of any sampled by π2. To quantify this difference, we also measure the variance of IS(H,θi) as E [ IS(H)2\n∣∣H ∼ πθi]−E [IS(H)|H ∼ πθi ]2 where the expectations are estimated with 10,000 trajecto-\nries. This evaluation is repeated 5 times per iteration and the reported variance is the mean over these evaluations. The decrease in variance for each policy is shown in Figure 1e. The high initial variance means there is much more room for BPG to improve the behavior policy when θe is the partially optimized policy.\nWe also test the sensitivity of BPG to the learning rate parameter. A critical issue in the use of BPG is selecting the\nstep size parameter α. If α is set too high we risk making too large of an update to θ — potentially stepping to a worse behavior policy. If we are too conservative then it will take many iterations for a noticeable improvement over Monte Carlo estimation. Figure 1f shows variance reduction for a number of different α values in the GridWorld domain. We found BPG in this domain was robust to a variety of step size values. We do not claim this result is representative for all problem domains; stepsize selection in the behavior policy search problem is an important area for future work.\nContinuous Control Figure 2 shows reduction of MSE on the Cartpole Swing-up and Acrobot domains. Again we see that BPG reduces MSE faster than Monte Carlo evaluation. In contrast to the discrete Gridworld experiment, this experiment demonstrates the applicability of BPG to the continuous control setting. While BPG significantly outperforms Monte Carlo evaluation in Cart-pole Swingup, the gap is much smaller in Acrobot. This result also demonstrates BPG (and behavior policy search) when the policy must generalize across different states."

In these experiments we use a 10x10 stochastic gridworld. The added stochasticity increases the difficulty of building an accurate model from trajectories.\nSince these methods require a model we construct this model in one of two ways. The first method uses all trajectories in D to build the model and then uses the same set to estimate ρ(πe) with ASE or DR. The second method uses trajectories from the first 10 iterations to build the model and then fixes the model for the remaining iterations.

This result is interesting since a changing model changes the surface of our variance objective and thus gradient descent on the variance has no theoretical guarantees of convergence.

The intuition for why behavior policy search can lower the variance of on-policy estimates is that a well selected behavior policy can cause rare and high magnitude events to occur. We test this intuition by varying the probability of a rare, high magnitude event and observing how this change affects the performance gap between on- and off-policy evaluation. For this experiment, we use a variant of the deterministic Gridworld where taking the UP action in the initial state (the upper left corner) causes a transition to the terminal state with a reward of +50. We use π1 from our earlier Gridworld experiments but we vary the probability of choosing UP when in the initial state. So with probability p the agent will receive a large reward and end the trajectory. We use a constant learning rate of 10−5 for all values of p and run BPG for 500 iterations. We plot the relative decrease of the variance as a function of p over 100 trials for each value of p. We use relative variance to normalize across problem instances. Note that under this measure, even when p is close to 1, the relative variance is not equal to zero because as p approaches 1 the initial variance also goes to zero.\nThis experiment illustrates that as the initial variance increases, the amount of improvement BPG can achieve increases. As p becomes closer to 1, the initial variance becomes closer to zero and BPG barely improves over the variance of Monte Carlo (in terms of absolute variance there is no improvement). When the πe rarely takes the high rewarding UP action (p close to 0), BPG improves policy evaluation by increasing the probability of this action. This experiment supports our intuition for why off-policy evaluation can outperform on-policy evaluation."

While adaptive importance-sampling has been studied in the estimation literature, we focus here on adaptive importancesampling for MDPs and Markov Reward Processes (i.e., an MDP with a fixed policy). Existing work on adaptive IS in RL has considered changing the transition probabilities to lower the variance of policy evaluation (Desai & Glynn, 2001; Frank et al., 2008) or lower the variance of policy gradient estimates (Ciosek & Whiteson, 2017). Since the transition probabilities are typically unknown in RL, adapting the behavior policy is a more general approach to adaptive IS. Ciosek and Whiteson also adapt the distribution of trajectories with gradient descent on the variance (Ciosek & Whiteson, 2017) with respect to parameters of the transition probabilities. The main focus of this work is increasing\nthe probability of simulated rare events so that policy improvement can learn an appropriate response. In contrast, we address the problem of policy evaluation and differentiate with respect to the (known) policy parameters.\nThe cross-entropy method (CEM) is a general method for adaptive importance-sampling. CEM attempts to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the current sampling distribution and the optimal sampling distribution. As discussed in Section 3.1, this optimal behavior policy only exists under a set of restrictive conditions. In contrast we adapt the behavior policy by minimizing variance.\nOther methods exist for lowering the variance of on-policy estimates. In addition to the control variate technique used by the Advantage Sum estimator (Zinkevich et al., 2006; White & Bowling, 2009), Veness et al. consider using common random numbers and antithetic variates to reduce the variance of roll-outs in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (2011). These techniques require a model of the environment (as is typical for MCTS) and do not appear to be applicable to the general RL policy evaluation problem. BPG could potentially be applied to find a lower variance rollout policy for MCTS.\nIn this work we have focused on unbiased policy evaluation. When the goal is to minimize MSE it is often permissible to use biased methods such as temporal difference learning (van Seijen & Sutton, 2014), model-based policy evaluation (Kearns & Singh, 2002; Strehl et al., 2009), or variants of weighted importance sampling (Precup et al., 2000). It may be possible to use similar ideas to BPG to reduce bias and variance although this appears to be difficult since the bias contribution to the mean squared error is squared and thus any gradient involving bias requires knowledge of the estimator’s bias. We leave behavior policy search with biased off-policy methods to future work."

      "text" : "Our experiments demonstrate that behavior policy search with BPG can lower the variance of policy evaluation. One open question is characterizing the settings where adapting the behavior policy substantially improves over on-policy estimates. Towards answering this question, our Gridworld experiment showed that when πe has little variance, BPG can only offer marginal improvement. BPG increases the probability of observing rare events with a high magnitude. If the evaluation policy never sees such events then there is little benefit to using BPG. However, in expectation and with an appropriately selected step-size, BPG will never lower the data-efficiency of policy evaluation.\nIt is also necessary that the evaluation policy contributes to the variance of the returns. If all variance is due to the environment then it seems unlikely that BPG will offer much\nimprovement. For example, Ciosek and Whiteson (2017) consider a variant of the Mountain Car task where the dynamics can trigger a rare event — independent of the action — in which rewards are multiplied by 1000. No behavior policy adaptation can lower the variance due to this event.\nOne limitation of gradient-based BPS methods is the necessity of good step-size selection. In theory, BPG can never lead to worse policy evaluation compared to on-policy estimates. In practice, a poorly selected step-size may cause a step to a worse behavior policy at step iwhich may increase the variance of the gradient estimate at step i + 1. Future work could consider methods for adaptive step-sizes, second order methods, or natural behavior policy gradients.\nOne interesting direction for future work is incorporating behavior policy search into policy improvement. A similar idea was explored by Ciosek and Whiteson who explored off-environment learning to improve the performance of policy gradient methods (2017). The method presented in that work is limited to simulated environments with differential dynamics. Adapting the behavior policy is a potentially much more general approach."

We present a solution — Behavior Policy Gradient — for this problem which adapts the behavior policy with stochastic gradient descent on the variance of the importance-sampling estimator. Experiments demonstrate BPG lowers the mean squared error of estimates of ρ(πe) compared to on-policy estimates.

      "text" : "In Appendix A, we give the full derivation of our primary theoretical contribution — the importance-sampling (IS) variance gradient. We also present the variance gradient for the doubly-robust (DR) estimator.\nWe first derive an analytic expression for the gradient of the variance of an arbitrary, unbiased off-policy policy evaluation estimator, OPE(H,θ). Importance-sampling is one such off-policy policy evaluation estimator. From our general derivation we derive the gradient of the variance of the IS estimator and then extend to the DR estimator.\nA.1. Variance Gradient of an Unbiased Off-Policy Policy Evaluation Method\nWe first present a lemma from which ∂∂θ MSE[IS(H,θ)] and ∂ ∂θ MSE[DR(H,θ)] can both be derived.\nLemma 1 gives the gradient of the mean squared error (MSE) of an unbiased off-policy policy evaluation method.\nLemma 1.\n∂\n∂θ MSE[OPE(H,θ)] = E\n[ OPE(H,θ)2(\nL∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(At|St)) + ∂ ∂θ OPE(H,θ)2 ∣∣∣∣∣H ∼ πθ ]\nProof. We begin by decomposing Pr(H|π) into two components—one that depends on π and the other that does not. Let\nwπ(H) := L∏ t=0 π(At|St),\nand p(H) := Pr(H|π)/wπ(H),\nfor any π such that H ∈ supp(π) (any such π will result in the same value of p(H)). These two definitions mean that Pr(H|π) = p(H)wπ(H).\nThe MSE of the OPE estimator is given by:\nMSE[OPE(H,θ)] = Var[OPE(H,θ)] + (E[OPE(H,θ)]− ρ(πe))2︸ ︷︷ ︸ bias2 .\nSince the OPE estimator is unbiased, i.e., E[OPE(H,θ)] = ρ(πe), the second term is zero and so:\nMSE(OPE(H,θ)) =Var(OPE(H,θ)) =E [ OPE(H,θ)2 ∣∣H ∼ πθ]−E[OPE(H,θ)|H ∼ πθ]2 =E [ OPE(H,θ)2\n∣∣H ∼ πθ]− ρ(πe)2 To obtain the MSE gradient, we differentiate MSE(OPE(H,θ)) with respect to θ:\n∂\n∂θ MSE[OPE(H,θ)] =\n∂\n∂θ\n[ E [ OPE(H,θ)2 ∣∣H ∼ πθ]− ρ(πe)2] = ∂\n∂θ EH∼πθ\n[ OPE(H,θ)2 ] = ∂\n∂θ ∑ H Pr(H|θ)OPE(H,θ)2\n= ∑ H Pr(H|θ) ∂ ∂θ OPE(H,θ)2 +OPE(H,θ)2 ∂ ∂θ Pr(H|θ)\n= ∑ H Pr(H|θ) ∂ ∂θ OPE(H,θ)2 +OPE(H,θ)2p(H) ∂ ∂θ wπθ (H) (1)\nConsider the last factor of the last term in more detail:\n∂\n∂θ wπθ (H) =\n∂\n∂θ L∏ t=0 πθ(At|St)\n(a) = ( L∏ t=0 πθ(At|St) )( L∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θπθ(At|St) πθ(At|St) )\n=wπθ (H) L∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log (πθ(At|St)) ,\nwhere (a) comes from the multi-factor product rule. Continuing from (1) we have that:\n∂\n∂θ MSE(OPE(H,θ)) =E\n[ OPE(H,θ)2\nL∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log (πθ(At|St)) + ∂ ∂θ OPE(H,θ)2 ∣∣∣∣∣H ∼ πθ ] .\nA.2. Behavior Policy Gradient Theorem\nWe now use Lemma 1 to prove the Behavior Policy Gradient Theorem which is our main theoretical contribution.\nTheorem 2. ∂\n∂θ MSE[IS(H,θ)] = E\n[ − IS(H,θ)2\nL∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(At|St) ∣∣∣∣∣H ∼ πθ ]\nwhere the expectation is taken over H ∼ πθ.\nProof. We first derive ∂∂θ IS(H,θ) 2. Theorem 1 then follows directly from using ∂∂θ IS(H,θ) 2 as ∂∂θ OPE(H,θ) 2 in Lemma 1.\nIS(H,θ)2 = ( wπe wθ g(H) )2 ∂\n∂θ IS(H,θ)2 =\n∂\n∂θ\n( wπe(H)\nwθ(H) g(H) )2 =2 · g(H)wπe(H)\nwθ(H)\n∂\n∂θ\n( g(H) wπe(H)\nwθ(H) ) (a) =− 2 · g(H)wπe(H)\nwθ(H)\n( g(H) wπe(H)\nwθ(H) ) L∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(At|St)\n=− 2 IS(H,θ)2 L∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(At|St)\nwhere (a) comes from the multi-factor product rule and using the likelihood-ratio trick (i.e., ∂ ∂θπθ(A|S) πθ(A|S) = log πθ(A|S))\nSubstituting this expression into Lemma 1 completes the proof:\n∂\n∂θ MSE[IS(H,θ)] = E\n[ − IS(H,θ)2\nL∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(At|St) ∣∣∣∣∣H ∼ πθ ]\nA.3. Doubly Robust Estimator\nOur final theoretical result is a corollary to the Behavior Policy Gradient Theorem: an extension of the IS variance gradient to the Doubly Robust (DR) estimator. Recall that for a single trajectory DR is given as:\nDR(H,θ) := v̂πe(S0) + L∑ t=0 γt wπe,t wθ,t (Rt − q̂πe(St, At) + v̂πe(St+1))\nwhere v̂πe is the state-value function of πe under an approximate model, q̂πe is the action-value function of πe under the model, and wπ,t := ∏t j=0 π(Aj |Sj).\nThe gradient of the mean squared error of the DR estimator is given by the following corollary to the Behavior Policy Gradient Theorem: Corollary 2.\n∂\n∂θ MSE [DR(H,θ)] = E[(DR(H,θ)2 L∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(At|St) − 2DR(H,θ)( L∑ t=0 γtδt wπe,t wθ,t t∑ i=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(Ai|Si))]\nwhere δt = Rt − q̂(St, At) + v̂(St+1) and the expectation is taken over H ∼ πθ.\nProof. As with Theorem 1, we first derive ∂∂θ DR(H,θ) 2. Corollary 1 then follows directly from using ∂∂θ DR(H,θ) 2 as ∂ ∂θ OPE(H,θ) 2 in Lemma 1.\nDR(H,θ)2 = ( v̂πe(S0) +\nL∑ t=0 γt wπe,t wθ,t (Rt − q̂πe(St, At) + v̂πe(St+1))\n)2\n∂\n∂θ DR(H,θ)2 =\n∂\n∂θ\n( v̂πe(S0) +\nL∑ t=0 γt wπe,t wθ,t (Rt − q̂πe(St, At) + v̂πe(St+1))\n)2\n=2DR(H,θ) ∂\n∂θ\n( v̂πe(S0) +\nL∑ t=0 γt wπe,t wθ,t (Rt − q̂πe(St, At) + v̂πe(St+1))\n)\n=− 2DR(H,θ)( L∑ t=0 γt wπe,t wθ,t (Rt − q̂πe(St, At) + v̂πe(St+1)) t∑ i=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(Ai|Si))\nThus the DR(H,θ) gradient is:\n= E [ DR(H,θ)2\nL∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(At|St)− 2DR(H,θ)( L∑ t=0 γt wπe,t wθ,t (Rt − q̂πe(St, At) + v̂πe(St+1)) t∑ i=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(Ai|Si)) ∣∣∣∣∣H ∼ πθ ]\nThe expression for the DR behavior policy gradient is more complex than the expression for the IS behavior policy gradient. Lowering the variance of DR involves accounting for the covariance of the sum of terms. Intuitively, accounting for the covariance increases the complexity of the expression for the gradient."

      "text" : "This appendix proves that BPG’s estimate is an unbiased estimate of ρ(πe). If only trajectories from a single θi were used then clearly IS(·,θi) is an unbiased estimate of ρ(πe). The difficulty is that the BPG’s estimate at iteration n depends on all θi for i = 1 . . . n and each θi is not independent of the others. Nevertheless, we prove here that BPG produces an unbiased\nestimate of ρ(πe) at each iteration. Specifically, we will show that E [IS(Hn,θn)|θ0 = θe)] is an unbiased estimate of ρ(πe), where the IS estimate is conditioned on θ0 = θe. To make the dependence of θi on θi−1 explicit, we will write f(Hi−1) := θi where Hi−1 ∼ πθi−1 . We use Pr(h|θ) as shorthand for Pr(H = h|θ).\nE [IS(Hn,θn)|θ = θe)] = ∑ h0 Pr(h0|θ0) ∑ h1 Pr(h1|f(h0)) · · · ∑ hn\nPr(hn|f(hn−1)) IS(hn)︸ ︷︷ ︸ ρ(πe)\n=ρ(πe) ∑ h0 Pr(h0|θ0) ∑ h1 Pr(h1|f(h0)) · · ·\n=ρ(πe)\nNotice that, even though BPG’s off-policy estimates at each iteration are unbiased, they are not statistically independent. This means that concentration inequalities, like Hoeffding’s inequality, cannot be applied directly. We conjecture that the conditional independence properties of BPG (specifically that Hi is independent of Hi−1 given θi), are sufficient for Hoeffding’s inequality to be applicable."

      "heading" : "C. Supplemental Experiment Description",
      "text" : "This appendix contains experimental details in addition to the details contained in Section 5 of the paper.\nGridworld: This domain is a 4x4 Gridworld with a terminal state with reward 10 at (3, 3), a state with reward −10 at (1, 1), a state with reward 1 at (1, 3), and all other states having reward −1. The action set contains the four cardinal directions and actions move the agent in its intended direction (except when moving into a wall which produces no movement). The agent begins in (0,0), γ = 1, and L = 100. All policies use softmax action selection with temperature 1 where the probability of taking an action a in a state s is given by:\nπ(a|s) = e θsa∑\na′ e θsa′\nWe obtain two evaluation policies by applying REINFORCE to this task, starting from a policy that selects actions uniformly at random. We then select one evaluation policy from the early stages of learning – an improved policy but still far from converged –, π1, and one after learning has converged, π2. We run our set of experiments once with πe := π1 and a second time with πe := π2. The ground truth value of ρ(πe) is computed with value iteration for both πe.\nStochastic Gridworld: The layout of this Gridworld is identical to the deterministic Gridworld except the terminal state is at (9, 9) and the +1 reward state is at (1, 9). When the agent moves, it moves in its intended direction with probability 0.9, otherwise it goes left or right with equal probability. Noise in the environment increases the difficulty of building an accurate model from trajectories.\nContinuous Control: We evaluate BPG on two continuous control tasks: Cart-pole Swing Up and Acrobot. Both tasks are implemented within RLLAB (Duan et al., 2016) (full details of the tasks are given in Appendix 1.1). The single task modification we make is that in Cart-pole Swing Up, when a trajectory terminates due to moving out of bounds we give a penalty of −1000. This modification increases the variance of πe. We use γ = 1 and L = 50. Policies are represented as conditional Gaussians with mean determined by a neural network with two hidden layers of 32 tanh units each and a state-independent diagonal covariance matrix. In Cart-pole Swing Up, πe was learned with 10 iterations of the TRPO algorithm (Schulman et al., 2015) applied to a randomly initialized policy. In Acrobot, πe was learned with 60 iterations. The ground truth value of ρ(πe) in both domains is computed with 1,000,000 Monte Carlo roll-outs.\nDomain Independent Details In all experiments we subtract a constant control variate (or baseline) in the gradient estimate from Theorem 1. The baseline is bi = E [ − IS(H)2 ∣∣H ∼ θi−1] and our new gradient estimate is: E [ (− IS2−bi)\nL∑ t=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(At|St) ∣∣∣∣∣H ∼ πθ ]\nAdding or subtracting a constant does not change the gradient in expectation since bi · E [∑L t=0 ∂ ∂θ log πθ(At|St) ] = 0. BPG with a baseline has lower variance so that the estimated gradient is closer in direction to the true gradient.\nWe use batch sizes of 100 trajectories per iteration for Gridworld experiments and size 500 for the continuous control tasks. The step-size parameter was determined by a sweep over [10−2, 10−6]\nEarly Stopping Criterion In all experiments we run BPG for a fixed number of iterations. In general, BPS can continue for a fixed number of iterations or until the variance of the IS estimator stops decreasing. The true variance is unknown but can be estimated by sampling a set of k trajectories with θi and computing the uncentered variance: 1 k ∑k j=0 OPE(Hj ,θj)\n2. This measure can be used to empirically evaluate the quality of each θ or determine when a BPS algorithm should terminate behavior policy improvement."

The standard unbiased technique for evaluating a policy is to deploy the policy and observe its performance. We show that the data collected from deploying a different policy, commonly called the behavior policy, can be used to produce unbiased estimates with lower mean squared error than this standard technique. We derive an analytic expression for the optimal behavior policy—the behavior policy that minimizes the mean squared error of the resulting estimates. Because this expression depends on terms that are unknown in practice, we propose a novel policy evaluation sub-problem, behavior policy search: searching for a behavior policy that reduces mean squared error. We present a behavior policy search algorithm and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in lowering the mean squared error of policy performance estimates.",
