      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nSeveral methods have been developed to understand how brain processes information. One, in particular, aims to predict or decode the brain state, and/or the type of information associated with cognitive processes, based on distributed patterns of activation in the brain, acquired with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using various machine learning methods [1]–[9]. One of the major motivations of this study is to propose a model for pattern analysis of fMRI data pertaining to different cognitive states using statistical learning theory. This representation involves understanding, manipulating and predicting the behavior of the very complex nature of human brain. Massively coupled dynamic interactions of the brain at many scales cannot be fully understood by only employing the measurements recorded from the individual voxels. Therefore, there has been growing interest in using brain connectivity to reveal interactions between spatially distant regions. Brain connectivity describes neural processes as the outcomes of dynamic coordination among smaller elements [10]. Three main types of brain connectivity are reported in\nthe literature: i) structural connectivity which basically reveals anatomic connections (pathways) of brain, such as physical links between neural elements, ii) functional connectivity is defined as statistical dependence between distributed neural elements or regions across time, e.g. correlation and iii) effective connectivity which analyzes brain connectivity using causal effects between neural elements, resulting in causal activation paths [11], [12].\nConnectivity for decoding is mostly used for model selection and/or defining the neighbourhood of seed neural elements or regions [13]. For instance, in a study by McIntosh et al., partial least squares for activation analysis is performed to construct a cross block covariance matrix using PET data [14]. Correlation based measures such as correlation/partial correlation, Granger causality, independent component analysis (ICA), mutual-information or coherence are used for the selection of different functional interdependence functions [15]–[17]. Ryali et al. measure sparse-partial correlation between multiple regions using elastic net penalty, which combines `1 and `2 norm regularization terms in order to improve the sensitivity of the correlation measure [18]. Patel et al. propose a conditional dependence model which accounts for an imbalance between class conditional and posterior probabilities, to achieve at a measure of connectivity [19]. Unlike correlation measures, Shier et al. train a classifier to decode cognitive states after constructing functional connectivity matrices, analysing increasing connectivity regions by subtracting connectivity matrices for each state [7]. Richardi et al. construct functional connectivity matrices by using pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients and employ graph matching to decode brain states [6].\nIn this study, we introduce an algorithm for modeling cognitive processes, based on the functional and structural connectivity in the brain. Structural connectivity is utilized for anatomic parcellation of the brain regions by clustering the voxel intensity values measured by fMRI. Next, functional connectivity is utilized within the clusters by different correlation measures. Functional connectivity matrices are formed to define functional neighbourhood of a voxel. A local mesh is formed for each voxel (called the seed voxel) by including the functionally closest neighbours (called the surrounding voxels) in the mesh. The relationships between the seed\nar X\niv :1\n40 2.\n56 84\nv2 [\ncs .A\nI] 6\nM ar\n2 01\n4\nvoxel and the surrounding voxels are modeled by estimating the arc weights of the mesh in a linear regression model. The arc weights, called Functional Connectivity-aware Local Relational Features (FC-LRF) represent the relationship of each voxel to its functionally closest neighbours. Finally, the proposed FC-LRF features are used to train a classifier which recognizes type of information and/or cognitive state.\nIn the current study, we particularly focused on classification of the type of information being encoded and retrieved during memory operations. During the experiment, participants studied a list of words selected from one of ten pre-defined semantic categories and made recognition memory judgements while neural activation was recorded using fMRI [20], [21]. Accordingly, we tested whether the proposed machine learning algorithm can successfully identify and differentiate the type of information (i.e. the semantic category to which the word belongs) which is represented in the brain at a given time considering distributed patterns of brain activity associated with, and during memory encoding and retrieval."

      "text" : "(LRF)\nIn this study, blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signals υ(ti, s̄j), are measured at time instants ti, i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N , at voxel coordinates s̄j , j = 1, 2, 3, · · · ,M , where N is the number of time samples, and M is the number of voxels. The data set D = {υ(ti, s̄j) : i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N, j = 1, 2, 3, · · · ,M} consists of the voxels υ(ti, s̄j), which are distributed in brain in three dimensions. Therefore, the position s̄j = (xj , yj , zj) of a voxel υ(ti, s̄j) at a time instant ti is a three dimensional vector. At each time instant ti, the participant is processing (either encoding or retrieving) a word belonging to a cognitive process. Therefore, the samples υ(ti, s̄j) has an object label at each time instance. In Mesh Learning [22], the cognitive states are modelled by local meshes for each individual voxel, called seed voxel υ(ti, s̄j), which is defined in a neighbourhood system ηp (see;Figure 1). In this mesh, a voxel υ(ti, s̄j) is connected\nto p-nearest neighbouring voxels {υ(ti, s̄k)}pk=1 by the arcs with weights {ai,j,k}pk=1. Therefore, the relationship among the BOLD signals measured at each voxel, are represented by the arc weights. p-nearest neighbours, ηp, are defined as the spatially-nearest neighbours to the seed voxel, where the distances between the voxels are computed using Euclidean distances between the spatial coordinates s̄j of the voxels in brain. The arc weights ai,j,k of the mesh are estimated by the following linear regression equation:\nυ(ti, s̄j) = ∑ s̄k∈ηp ai,j,k υ(ti, s̄k) + εi,j , (1)\nwhere εi,j indicates the error of voxel υ(ti, s̄j) at time instant ti, which is minimized for estimating the arc weights ai,j,k. This procedure is conducted by minimizing the expected square error defined as follows,\nE(ε2i,j) = E (( υ(ti, s̄j)− ∑ s̄k∈ηp ai,j,k υ(ti, s̄k) )2) , (2)\nwhere ηp(s̄j) is the set of p-nearest neighbours of the jth voxel at location s̄j .\nMinimizing Equation 2 with respect to ai,j,k is accomplished by employing Levinson-Durbin recursion [23], where E(·) is the expectation operator. The arc weights ai,j,k, which are computed for each seed voxel at each time instant ti, are used to form a mesh arc vector āi,j = [ai,j,1 ai,j,2 · · · ai,j,p]. Furthermore, a mesh arc matrix Aj is constructed by concatenating the mesh arc vectors at each time instant, Aj = [ā1,j ā2,j · · · āN,j ]T . Finally, feature matrix F = [A1 A2 · · · AM ] which represents the Local Relational Features (LRF), is constructed in Equation 3. The feature matrix, which is extracted during both memory encoding and retrieval stages, is further used in training and testing phases in the classification of cognitive processes, respectively. For the details of the mesh learning algorithm see [22], [24], [25].\nArc weights for υ(ti,s̄1)︷ ︸︸ ︷ F = a1,1,1 · · · a1,1,p · · · a1,M,p... . . . ... . . . ... aN,1,1 · · · aN,1,p · · · aN,M,p  (3) The motivation of representing voxels in the brain by local meshes can be validated by analyzing an individual voxel’s intensity change and the change of the sum of squared difference of intensities ds̄j ,ηp(s̄j) = ∑ s̄k∈ηp(s̄j)[υ(ti, s̄j) − υ(ti, s̄k)] 2 in the neighbourhood of that voxel, in time. Individual voxel intensity values, which are measured at each time instant, do not possess any discriminative information as illustrated in Figure 2 with red line. Note that the signal intensity value for a voxel is almost constant at each time instant. Since the measurements along the time axis correspond to separate cognitive processes, in most of the problems, it is\nunlikely to discriminate them by using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods which classify the voxel intensity values by a machine learning algorithm. On the other hand, there is a slight variation of the sum of squared distances of intensity values in differing neighbour sizes. The above observation shows that the relationships among voxels carry more information than individual voxel intensity values, at each time instant."

      "text" : "The estimated LRF vectors, which represent relationships among the voxels in the same neighbourhood system, have a high discriminative power compared to the individual voxel intensity values. As a result, the Mesh Learning algorithm proposed by [22] performs better than the well-known individual voxel based algorithms (see also; Table III). However, employing the Euclidean distance to form the neighbourhood system may not fully represent the activation patterns in the brain, where the spatially distant neurons might exhibit functional connectivity. “Nearest” neighbourhood in the mesh model implies spatial surroundings of the seed voxel when Euclidean distance is used, which may not be the case during cognitive processing. Additionally, it is well known that spatially close voxels are strongly coupled during cognitive processes [26]. Therefore, using Euclidean distance for defining neighbourhoods for voxels may cause redundant meshes and mesh arc weights in a feature matrix. A partial improvement for this\nproblem can be accomplished by the usage of a functional connectivity method. Selecting functional neighbours for each voxel and constructing the meshes based on the functional neighbourhood result in a more discriminative feature matrix improving the classification performance."

The voxels are considered to be functionally connected if they have “similar” functional properties. Therefore, the functional connectivity depends on the similarity measure. The “similarity” can be measured, for example, by estimating the correlation or covariance between pairs of time series. Functional connectivity is expected to capture patterns of deviations between distributed and often spatially distant regions in brain [27], and constructed using an inter-regional analysis."

It has been suggested that correlation based measures are well suited for functional connectivity analysis [28]. Consequently, we use zero-order correlation (crosscorrelation) to measure the functional similarity between timeseries. The zero-order correlation coefficient ρjk between two nodes, voxels ϑj and ϑk in our case, is defined as\nρjk = covjk\n( υ(t, s̄j), υ(t, s̄k) )√ varj ( υ(t, s̄j) ) · vark ( υ(t, s̄k)\n) , (4) where covjk is the covariance of the signals measured at two voxels, and varj is the variance of the signals measured at a voxel υ(t, s̄j) and ρjk ∈ [−1, 1]."

      "heading" : "B. Adaptive Selection of Number of neighbours (FC-LRF order)",
      "text" : "The major distinction between the Mesh Learning and Functionally Connected Mesh Learning algorithms is the definition of p-neighbourhood during the formation of the mesh for each seed voxel. In the Mesh Learning algorithm suggested in [22] p-neighbourhood is defined by Euclidean distance, whereas in Functionally Connected Mesh Learning p-neighbourhood is defined by functional similarity. In both methods, the identification of the order of p is a difficult problem. The major problem of functional similarity matrix is that each class have a distinct functional connectivity matrix. Therefore, p can be adaptively selected by analyzing this distinction in functional connectivity matrices.\nIn order to recognize the functional relationships between the voxels in brain during cognitive processes, we need to compute different within-class functional connectivity matrices for each brain state using Algorithm 3. Since our problem is to discriminate and recognize multiple semantic classes during retrieval, a different functional connectivity matrix is constructed in encoding state for each semantic class. These matrices are then analyzed to compute the most discriminative pairwise voxel relations among all classes.\nIn order to represent the most discriminative pairwise voxel relations, we construct a matrix which represents the unique relations that are representative for all the classes. In the experiments, Ω number of different within-cluster functional connectivity matrices FCωm are constructed for each semantic class and cluster m, where ω = 1, . . . ,Ω, as illustrated in Figure 5a. In addition, for each cluster m, standard deviation and entropy values are computed for each element of Ω\nnumber of functional connectivity matrices FCωm to form discriminative functional relation matrices Stdm and Entm, as illustrated in Figure 5b. During the modelling of the retrieval state with Functionally Connected Mesh Learning, FC-LRF is extracted using Std = {Stdm}Cm=1 and Ent = {Entm}Cm=1, employing Algorithm 3.\nIn Algorithm 3, we compute the standard deviation Stdm(j, k) as follows:\nStdm(j, k) =\n( 1\nΩ− 1 Ω∑ ω=1 ( FCωm(j, k)−µ ( FCωm(j, k) ))2) 12 ,\n(7) where µ(FCωm(j, k)) = 1 Ω ∑Ω ω=1(FC ω m(j, k)) is the mean of correlation coefficients for cognitive states ω = 1, · · · ,Ω, and the entropy Entm(j, k) as follows:\nEntm(j, k) = − Ω∑ ω=1 P ( FCωm(j, k) ) log P ( FCωm(j, k) ) , (8)\nwhere P ( FCωm(j, k) ) is the probability of the observation of correlation coefficients which are measured between two voxels ϑj and ϑk for a cognitive process ω.\nThe advantage of using discriminative matrices is the reduction of the FC-LRF order p selection problem to a threshold selection problem for discriminative matrices. For instance, consider the within-cluster functional connectivity matrices illustrated in Figure 5. Standard deviation of within-cluster functional connectivity matrix Stdm, whose elements take values in the interval [0, 1] ( Figure 5b), standard deviation is computed using the standard deviation of Ω number of correlation matrices, whose elements take values in the interval [−1, 1] (Figure 5a).\nNote that, if Stdm(j, k) ≈ 1, then the deviation of the correlation coefficients ρjk, which are computed using the signal values at the voxels ϑj and ϑk, highly varies in time. Therefore, we may state that the voxels respond to different cognitive processes which are determined by the\nAlgorithm 3 Compute Discriminative Within-Cluster Functional Connectivity Matrices Input : Number of Clusters : C Number of Semantic Categories: Ω Output : Discriminative Functional Connectivity Matrices Std and Ent\n1: Std← Ø 2: Ent← Ø 3: for semantic category ω = 1 to Ω do 4: Compute FCω using Algorithm (1) 5: end for 6: for m = 1 to C do 7: for each pair (j, k) ∈ cm do 8: α← Ø // temporary vector for correlation coefficients 9: for semantic category ω = 1 to Ω do\n10: α← α ∪ FCωm(j, k) 11: end for 12: Stdm(j, k)← std(α) // using equation (7) 13: Entm(j, k)← entropy(α) // using equation (8) 14: end for 15: Std← Std ∪ Stdm 16: Ent← Ent ∪ Entm 17: end for 18: return Std and Ent\nAlgorithm 4 Compute Between-Category Discriminative neighbourhood and FC-LRF Order Input : Discriminative Functional Connectivity Matrices : Std (or Ent)\nVoxel in consideration : υ(·, s̄j) Threshold : τ\nOutput : p−functional neighbourhood set ηfcp [ υ(·, s̄j) ] and FC-LRF order p\n1: ηfcp [ υ(·, s̄j) ] ← Ø 2: p← 0 3: Stdm (or Entm) ← Select discriminative matrix that voxel υ(·, s̄j) belongs in Std (or Ent)\n// Scan through all the relations in cluster m // j′ and k′ are translated indices of j and k in cluster m\n4: for k′ = 1 to πm do 5: if Stdm(j′, k′) ≥ τ then 6: ηfcp [ υ(·, s̄j) ] ← ηfcp [ υ(·, s̄j) ] ∪ k 7: p← p+ 1 8: end if 9: end for\n10: return ηfcp [ υ(·, s̄j) ] and p\nclasses with different signal values. Therefore, this voxel pair provides discriminative information for the classification of the cognitive processes, and the signal measurements observed in this voxel pair is considered for the extraction of FC-LRF. On the other hand, if Stdm(j, k) ≈ 0, then we observe that the measurements at the voxels are similar for different cognitive processes. Therefore, they do not provide discriminative information and will not be considered in the neighbourhood of each other, for the extraction of FC-LRF features, even they are fully correlated.\nThe other measure which defines the amount of the discrimination of different classes is entropy. Similar to the standard deviation, entropy captures the divergence of the correlation coefficients between semantic classes. A voxel pair can exhibit full correlation (ρij = 1) for a given semantic class but this pairwise relation does not carry any information for the classifier if the same correlation coefficient is observed for the rest of semantic classes. Therefore, the divergence of correlation coefficients is informative for the classifier, and such a divergence results a non-negative value by the employment of entropy. This trivial affect is also illustrated in Figure 6a. The more divergence in the correlation coefficients for a voxel pairs’ functional relation, higher the entropy measure indicating the amount of information.\nWe consider a pair of voxels ϑj and ϑk, with Stdm(j, k) ≥ τ and Entm(j, k) ≥ τ , for a given threshold value τ , for the extraction of features. In other words, given a threshold, a set of p-functionally nearest neighbours ηfcp for a voxel υ(ti, s̄j) is constructed using Algorithm 4. Note that, FC-LRF order p increases for each voxel as the threshold τ goes to 0, and FCLRF order p decreases as the threshold τ gets closer to 1. If the threshold τ = 0, then all the neighbouring voxels will be included in the p-functionally nearest neighbours set ηfc and FC-LRF order p will be equal to πm. On the contrary, if τ = 1, then only a very small number of neighbouring voxels will be\nincluded in the p-functionally nearest neighbours set ηfc and FC-LRF order p = 0 for most of the voxels. Notice that voxels having p = 0 and ηfc = {} will be automatically discarded in Algorithm 2 because of not having any discriminative information."

After the presentation of each study list, the participant solves math problems and following this delay period, decides whether a probe word matches one of the members of the study list (“old” or “new”). Employing a delay period (about 14 sec during which the participant solved math problems) allows independent assessment of encoding related (i.e. study list period) brain activation from retrieval related (i.e. during the test probe) activity patterns. With this approach, one can test whether it is possible to identify and differentiate semantic categories of information that is represented in the brain at a given time based on distributed patterns of brain activity associated with and during cognitive processing. A total of ten semantic categories were used in the study, which are animals, colors, furniture, body parts, fruits, herbs, clothes, chemical elements, vegetables and tools. We used the neural activation patterns collected during encoding and retrieval phases, to train and test the classifier to predict the semantic categories.\nThe neuroimaging data underwent standard preprocessing stages before the pattern analysis step. Image processing and data analysis were performed using SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). Following quality assurance procedures to assess outliers or artifacts in volume and slice-to-slice variance in the global signal, functional images were corrected for differences in slice acquisition timing by re-sampling all slices in time to match the first slice, followed\nby motion correction across all runs (using sinc interpolation). Functional data were then normalized based on MNI stereotaxic space using a 12-parameter affine transformation along with a non-linear transformation using cosine basis functions. Images were re-sampled into 2-mm cubic voxels and then spatially smoothed with an 8-mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel. Next, the functional data were detrended to account for baseline shifts across runs and for scanner drift across the entire session for the pattern analysis. Consistent with previous research of Polyn et al., onsets were shifted forward by three points to account for the hemodynamic response lag [30].\nVI. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FUNCTIONAL MESH LEARNING ALGORITHM\nOur dataset consists of 240 training samples from encoding phase and 239 test samples from the retrieval phase with 24 samples in each of 10 semantic categories. Our region of interest consists of 8142 voxels covering the lateral temporal cortex. Results for FC-LRF are generated using k-nearest neighbour (k-nn) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods. The k value of k-nn and kernel parameters of SVM classifier are selected using cross validation in the training set.\nThe number of clusters C in the proposed algorithm is a user specified parameter. Since the number of voxels in all clusters πm is always much higher than FC-LRF order p, regardless of the cluster size, similar functionally connected meshes are formed. Therefore, it has practically no effect on the performance of the algorithm. This fact is illustrated in the performance results in Table IV. Graph theoretic approaches can be employed after computing functional connectivity\nmatrices in order to partition connectivity matrices such as [31], [32], but this will introduce additional thresholds and user specified parameters, thus spared as a future work. Three different correlation variants are employed to capture functional similarity between nodes; i) cross-correlation which is given in equation 4, ii) peak correlation which captures the relationships between activation peaks and iii) scan correlation which measures the correlations of waveforms at a specific scan of interest. The overall performance of the algorithm is improved only by 2% − 4% percent by employing improved correlation measures as peak correlation and scan correlation.\nIn addition, we employed four different functionally-nearest neighbour selection approaches namely, selecting positively or negatively correlated neighbours by specifying FC-LRF order p and using discriminative functional connectivity matrices Std or Ent by specifying a threshold τ . The performance results are illustrated in Table I and Table II employing k-nn method and SVM method in classification of cognitive processes, respectively. Functional Connectivity Toolbox implementation [33] is used for the computation of the correlation measures.\nThe discriminative matrices Stdm and Entm are computed using within-cluster functional connectivity matrices with a fixed number of clusters C = 256. In the computations, we employed three different correlation measures (peak, scan and zero-order correlation), and two different discriminative matrix generation methods (standard deviation and entropy). Threshold values are empirically selected in the interval between [0.5, 0.95] with a 0.05 step-size.\nThe results in Table III show that the employment of functional connectivity in the mesh learning algorithm [22] improves classification performances, considerably. When we\nclassify the raw features of 8142 voxels (without LRF), we observe 48% and 40% performances. Note that Mesh Learning increases the performances to 58% and 45% and Functional Mesh Learning further increases the performances to 71% and 70% using k-NN and SVM methods, respectively. The main issue which increases the performance is basically the selection of nearest neighbours by using functional connectivity of the voxels in brain."

In the proposed learning method, local meshes are formed around each voxel. The distance between voxels in the mesh is determined by using a functional neighbourhood concept. In order to define the functional neighbourhood, the similarities between the time series recorded for voxels are measured and functional connectivity matrices are constructed. Then, the local mesh for each voxel is formed by including the functionally closest neighbouring voxels in the mesh. The relationship between the voxels within a mesh is estimated by using a linear regression model. These relationship vectors, called Functional Connectivity aware Local Relational Features (FC-LRF) are then used to train a statistical learning machine. The proposed method was tested on a recognition memory experiment, including data pertaining to encoding and retrieval of words belonging to ten different semantic categories. Two popular classifiers, namely knearest neighbour (k-nn) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are trained in order to predict the semantic category of the item being retrieved, based on activation patterns during encoding. The classification performance of the Functional Mesh Learning model, which range in 62% − 71% is superior to the classical multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods, which range in 40%− 48%, for ten semantic categories.",
