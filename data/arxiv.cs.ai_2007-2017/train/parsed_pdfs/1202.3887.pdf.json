      "text" : "Combining classifier is one of the most popular approaches in pattern recognition, which leads to have a better classification. It increases the recognition rate and improves the reliability of the system. It is usually a good approach in complicated problems due to the small sample size, class overlapping, dimensionality, and substantial noise in the input samples.\nPrevious experimental and theoretic results show that the combining classifiers with each other lead to higher performance when the base classifiers have small error rates, and their errors are different [1]; in other words, the base classifiers make uncorrelated decision in this case. Generally, classifier selection and classifier fusion are two types of combining classifiers [2]. One of the most popular methods of classifier selection is ME, originally proposed by Jacobs et al. [3]. The ME models the conditional probability density of the target output by mixing the outputs from a set of local experts, each of which separately derives a conditional probability density of the target output. The outputs of expert networks are combined by a gating network which is trained to select the expert(s) that is performing the best at solving the problem [4, 5, and 6]. In the basic form of ME [3], the expert and gating networks are linear classifiers, however, for more\ncomplex classification tasks, the expert and gating networks could be of more complicated types. For instance, Ebrahimpour et al. [7] proposes a face detection model, in which they used MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs) [8, 9, 10] to form the gating and expert networks in order to improve the face detection accuracy.\nThe Back Propagation (BP) algorithm is the most commonly used technique for training neural networks. It is an approximation of the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm, which is based on the steepest descent method. While the BP technique follows a straightforward and wellestablished algorithm, there are some disadvantages associated with it. For instance, the convergence behavior of the BP algorithm highly depends on the choice of initial values of connection weights and other parameters used in the algorithm such as the learning rate and the momentum term [11, 8].\nTo tackle the mentioned problems, we decided to employ much more powerful methods such as Conjugate Gradient (CG) and Modified Cuckoo Search (MCS) algorithm as a hybrid model. The CG method as a second-order optimization techniques is applied to the learning of MLP in ME structure. The MCS algorithm proposed by Walton et al [12] is an improved version of another metaheuristic algorithm the so called Cuckoo Search (CS) [13] and it can be used for initialing optimal values of connection weights. This is an evolutionary optimization algorithm inspired by the nature. This algorithm is inspired by the reproduction strategy of cuckoos. At the most basic level, cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other host birds, which may be of different species. The host bird may discover that the eggs which are not it’s own and either destroy the egg or abandon the nest all together. This has resulted in the evolution of cuckoo eggs which mimic the eggs of local host birds. Experimental results show that this modification causes faster convergence and better performance in classification and regression benchmark problems.\nThe rest of paper is organized as follow: In Section 2, Conjugate Gradient Multi-Layer Perceptronsis is explained. Mixture of Expert method is introduced in Section 3. Section 4 discusses Cuckoo Search and Modified Cuckoo Search. Experimental results are discussed in Section 5; finally, the conclusion is made in Section 6."

      "text" : "The BP learning algorithm is a supervised learning method for multi-layer feed-forward neural networks. It is a gradient descent local optimization technique which involves backward error correction of network weights. Despite the general success of BP method in the learning process, several major deficiencies are still needed to be solved. The convergence rate of BP is slow and hence it becomes unsuitable for large problems. Furthermore, the convergence behavior of the BP algorithm depends on the choice of initial values of connection weights and other parameters used in the algorithm such as the learning rate and the momentum term.\nOne way for speeding up the learning phase is using higher-order optimization. In the BP case the function is approximated by only the linear terms that include the first-order derivatives in a Taylor series expansion. In this case the second-order nonlinear terms that include the secondorder derivatives are also used in the Taylor series expansion, resulting more precise approximation [14].\nGiven a vector 0w∆ in the weight space, a second-order Taylor series approximation of the error function around this vector is expressed as\n0\n1 ( ) ( ) ( )\n2\nT T E w E w d w w H w= + ∆ + ∆ ∆\n(1)\nwhere ,d H are the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix, respectively. The minima of the\nfunction E are located where the gradient of E was equal to zero, therefore, the optimal value of w is given by 1\n0 .w w H d − = − (2)\nThe form of the basic updating equation of the CG algorithm is the same as the general gradient algorithm, and is given by\n( 1) ( ) ( ) ( )w k w k k w kη+ = + ∆ (3)\nwhere ( )kη is a time-varying learning parameter that may be updated using the following line\nsearch method:\n( ) min{ ( ( ) ( )) : 0}k E w k w k η\nη η η= + ∆ ≥ (4)\nThe conjugate condition for the incremental weight vector w∆ is designed as ( ( )) ( ) ( 1) 0 T w k H k w k∆ ∆ + = (5)\nwhere the Hessian matrix ( )H k is calculated at the point ( )w k . The updating for ( )w k , in this case,\nis chosen as:\n( ) ( ) ( 1) ( 1)w k d k k w kα∆ = − + − ∆ − (6)\nIn order to satisfy the conjugate condition between the vectors ( )w k∆ and ( 1)w k∆ + , the update\nprocedure for ( )kα is expressed using the Fletcher-Reeves formulation, the Hestenes-Stiefel\nformulation and the Hestenes-Stiefel formulation given by equation 7, 8 and 9 respectively:\n( ( 1)) ( 1) ( )\n( ( )) ( )\nT\nT\nd k d k k\nd k d k α\n+ + =\n(7)\n( ( 1)) ( ( 1) ( )) ( )\n( ( )) ( )\nT\nT\nd k d k d k k\nd k d k α\n+ + − =\n(8)\n[ ( ) ( 1)] ( ) ( )\n( ( 1)) [ ( ) ( 1)]\nT\nT\nd k d k d k k\nw k d k d k α\n− − =\n∆ − − −\n(9)\nIn fact, this algorithm exploits information about the direction of search for w∆ from the previous iteration in order to accelerate the convergence."

      "text" : "MLPs have been used successfully for solving different regression and classification problems. However, for large problems the parameter space of MLPs becomes huge and hence in training phase it becomes computationally intractable. To tackle this problem, one can take advantage of the principle of “divide and conquer”. According to the divide and conquer approach, one can solve a complex task by dividing it into simple tasks and then combining the solutions of them appropriately. A well-known method that works based on this principle is ME. This method is in the category of dynamic classifiers combining where the input signal is directly involved in the mechanism that integrates the output of the experts into an overall result [8]. For the first time ME was proposed in [3]. Their proposed model contains a population of simple linear classifiers (the experts). Outputs of the experts are mixed using a gating network. Technically the experts perform supervised learning, since for modeling the desired response; outputs of individual experts are combined. The experts are also self-organize to find a good partitioning of the input space and each expert model has its own subspace, and combination of all experts model the input\nspace well. In [13, 14] this method was extended to the so-called “Hierarchical Mixture of Experts” (HME). In HME instead of single experts, mixtures of experts’ models are used for each component. The ME has been studied for a wide range of research [15-18]."

The weights of MLPs expert networks are updated based on those estimations and the procedure is repeated.\nAs mentioned before, the convergence rate of GD learning algorithms is slow and hence it becomes unsuitable for large problems.

Each expert network is an MLP network\nwith one hidden layer that computes an output iO as a function of the input vector, x and weights of hidden and output layers and a sigmoid activation function. We assume that each expert\nspecializes in a specific area of the input space. The gating network assigns a weight ig to each of\nthe expert’s output, iO . The gating network determines ig as a function of the input vector x and a set of parameters such as weights of its hidden and output layers. The activation function of the gating hidden layer is sigmoid, and in the output layer we use linear activation function.

      "text" : "Although CG converge faster than BP, but it remarkably depends on initial weights among neurons. If optimal weights are assigned to connections of neurons, it can be expected that the final performance increases. In order to tackle this problem, we applied a metaheuristic algorithm so called Modified Cuckoo Search.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, computer scientists investigated the possibility of applying the concepts of evolution as an optimization tool for engineers and this gave birth to a subclass of gradient free methods called genetic algorithms (GA) [20]. Since then many other algorithms have been developed that have been inspired by nature, for example particle swarm optimization (PSO) [21], differential evolution (DE) [22] and, more recently, the cuckoo search (CS) [23]. These are heuristic techniques which make use of a large population of possible is design at each iteration. For each member of the population, the objective function is evaluated and a fitness is assigned. A set of rules is then used to move the population towards the optimum solution. Here, we used a new version of CS, the so called Modified Cuckoo Search (MCS) which was introduced by Walton et al [24]. They showed that MCS is more reliable and faster than CS, GA, DE and PSO [24]."

      "heading" : "4.1. Cuckoo Search (CS)",
      "text" : "CS is a metaheuristic search algorithm which has been recently proposed by Yang and Deb [26]. The algorithm is inspired by the reproduction strategy of cuckoos. At the most basic level, cuckoos lay their eggs in the nests of other host birds, which may be of different species. The host bird may discover that the eggs are not it’s own and either destroy the egg or abandon the nest all together. This has resulted in the evolution of cuckoo eggs which mimic the eggs of local host birds [25]. To apply this as an optimization tool, Yang and Deb [26] used three idealized rules:\n• Each cuckoo lays one egg, which represents a set of solution co-ordinates, at a time and\ndumps it in a random nest;\n• A fraction of the nests containing the best eggs, or solutions, will carry over to the next\ngeneration;\n• The number of nests is fixed and there is a probability that a host can discover an alien\negg, say [0,1]ap ∈ . If this happens, the host can either discard the egg or the nest and\nthese results in building a new nest in a new location.\nAlgorithm 1. Cuckoo Search (CS)\nInitialize a population of n host nests , 1, 2, ..., .x i ni = for all xi do\n1.1 Calculate fitness Fi = f(xi)\nend for while Number Objective Evaluations <Max Number Evaluations do\nGenerate a cuckoo egg ( ) j x by taking a Lévy flight from random nest\n( )jj F f x= .\nChoose a random nest I\nif ( j i F F> ) then\ni j x x←\ni j\nF F←\nend if\nAbandon a fraction ap of the worst nests Build new nests at new locations via Lévy flights to replace nests lost Evaluate fitness of new nests and rank all solutions\nend while\nThe steps involved in the CS are then derived from these rules and are shown in Algorithm 1 [23]. An important component of a CS is the use of Lévy flights for both local and global searching. The Lévy flight process, which has previously been used in search algorithms [27], is a random walk that is characterized by a series of instantaneous jumps chosen from a probability density function which has a power law tail Eq.7. -\n1 3Lévy u t λ λ∼ = ≤ ≤ (17)\nThis process represents the optimum random search pattern and is frequently found in nature [28]. When generating a new egg in Algorithm 1, a Lévy flight is performed starting at the position of a randomly selected egg, if the objective function value at these new coordinates is better than another randomly selected egg then that egg is moved to this new position.\n( 1) ( ) ( ) t t\ni i x x Lévyα λ\n+ = + ⊕\n(18)\nThe scale of this random search is controlled by multiplying the generated Lévy flight by a step sizeα . For example setting α = 0.1 could be beneficial in problems of small domains, in the examples presented here α = 1 is used in line with the work by Yang and Deb [26]. Yang and Deb [26] do not discuss boundary handling in their formulation, but an approach similar to PSO boundary handling [29] is adopted here. When a Lévy flight results in an egg location outside the bounds of the objective function, the fitness and position of the original egg are not changed. One\nof the advantages of CS over PSO is that only one parameter, the fraction of nests to abandon ap , needs to be adjusted. Yang and Deb [26] found that the convergence rate was not strongly\naffected by the value and they suggested setting ap = 0.25. The use of Lévy flights as the search method means that the CS can simultaneously find all optima in a design space and the method has been shown to perform well in comparison with PSO and GA [24]."

      "text" : "Given enough computation, the CS will always find the optimum [24] but, as the search relies entirely on random walks, a fast convergence cannot be guaranteed. In [25] two modifications to the method were made with the aim of increasing the convergence rate which leads to making the method more practical for a wider range of applications but without losing the attractive features of the original method. The first modification was made to the size of the Lévy flight step size α . In CS, α is constant and the value 1α = is employed [26]. In the MCS, the value of α decreases as the number of generations increases. This is done for the same reasons that the inertia constant is reduced in the PSO [22], i.e. to encourage more localized searching as the individuals, or the eggs, get closer to the solution. An initial value of the Lévy flight step size 1A = is chosen and, at each generation, a new Lévy flight step is calculated by using AGα = , where G is the generation number. This exploratory search is only performed on the fraction of nests to be abandoned. The second modification is to add information exchange between the eggs in an attempt to speed up convergence to a minimum. In the CS, there is no information exchange between individuals and, essentially, the searches are performed independently. In the MCS, a fraction of the eggs with the best fitness are put into a group of top eggs. For each of the top eggs, a second egg in this group is picked at random and a new egg is then generated on the line connecting these two top eggs. The distance along this line at which the new egg is located is\ncalculated, using the inverse of the golden ratio (1 5) 2ϕ = + , such that it is closer to the egg\nwith the best fitness. In the case that both eggs have the same fitness, the new egg is generated at the midpoint. Whilst developing the method a random fraction was used in place of the golden ratio, it was found that the golden ratio showed significantly greater performance than a random fraction. There is a possibility that, in this step, the same egg is picked twice. In this case, a local Lévy flight search is performed from the randomly picked nest with step size 2A Gα = . The\nsteps involved in the modified cuckoo search are shown in detail in Algorithm 2. There are two parameters, the fraction of nests to be abandoned and the fraction of nests to make up the top nests, which need to be adjusted in the MCS. Through testing on benchmark problems, it was found that setting the fraction of nests to be abandoned to 0.75 and the fraction of nests placed in the top nests group to 0.25 yielded the best results over a variety of functions.\nAlgorithm 2.

    "abstractText" : "This paper investigates a new method for improving the learning algorithm of Mixture of Experts (ME) model using a hybrid of Modified Cuckoo Search (MCS) and Conjugate Gradient (CG) as a second order optimization technique. The CG technique is combined with Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm to yield a much more efficient learning algorithm for ME structure. In addition, the experts and gating networks in enhanced model are replaced by CG based Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to provide faster and more accurate learning. The CG is considerably depends on initial weights of connections of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), so, a metaheuristic algorithm, the so-called Modified Cuckoo Search is applied in order to select the optimal weights. The performance of proposed method is compared with Gradient Decent Based ME (GDME) and Conjugate Gradient Based ME (CGME) in classification and regression problems. The experimental results show that hybrid MSC and CG based ME (MCS-CGME) has faster convergence and better performance in utilized benchmark data sets.",
