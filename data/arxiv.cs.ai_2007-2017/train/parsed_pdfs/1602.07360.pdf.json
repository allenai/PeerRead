      "text" : "Much of the recent research on deep neural networks has focused on increasing accuracy on computer vision datasets. For a given accuracy level, there typically exist multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. Given equivalent accuracy, a DNN architecture with fewer parameters has several advantages:\n• More efficient distributed training. Communication among servers is the limiting factor to the scalability of distributed DNN training. For distributed data-parallel training, communication overhead is directly proportional to the number of parameters in the model [11]. In short, small models train faster due to requiring less communication.\n• Less overhead when exporting new models to clients. For autonomous driving, companies such as Tesla periodically copy new models from their servers to customers’ cars. With AlexNet, this would require 240MB\n∗http://deepscale.ai\nof communication from the server to the car. Smaller models require less communication, making frequent updates more feasible.\n• Feasible FPGA and embedded deployment. FPGAs often have less than 10MB1 of on-chip memory and no off-chip memory or storage. For inference, a sufficiently small model could be stored directly on the FPGA, while video frames stream through the FPGA in real time.\nAs you can see, there are several advantages of smaller DNN architectures. With this in mind, we focus directly on the problem of identifying a DNN architecture with fewer parameters but equivalent accuracy compared to a wellknown model. We have discovered such an architecture, which we call SqueezeNet.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe SqueezeNet. We review related work in Section 3, and we evaluate SqueezeNet in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5."

      "heading" : "2.1. Architectural Design Strategies",
      "text" : "Our overarching objective in this paper is to identify DNN architectures which have few parameters while maintaining competitive accuracy. To achieve this, we work toward three main strategies when designing DNN architectures:\nStrategy 1. Replace 3x3 filters with 1x1 filters. Given a budget of a certain number of convolution filters, we will choose to make the majority of these filters 1x1, since a 1x1 filter has 9x fewer parameters than a 3x3 filter.\n1For example, the Xilinx Vertex-7 FPGA has a maximum of 8.5 MBytes (i.e. 68 Mbits) of on-chip memory and does not provide off-chip memory.\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n07 36\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n4 Fe\nb 20\nh\"p://www.presenta.on0process.com/lego0blocks0in0powerpoint.html88\nsquee ze8\nexpan d8\n1x18convolu.on8filters8\n1x18and83x38convolu.on8filters8\nReLU8\nReLU8\nFigure 1. Organization of convolution filters in the Fire module. In this example, s1x1 = 3, e1x1 = 4, and e3x3 = 4. We illustrate the convolution filters but not the activations.\nStrategy 2. Decrease the number of input channels to 3x3 filters. Consider a convolution layer that is comprised entirely of 3x3 filters. The total quantity of parameters in this layer is (number of input channels) * (number of filters) * (3*3). So, to maintain a small total number of parameters in a DNN, it is important not only to decrease the number of 3x3 filters (see Strategy 1 above), but also to decrease the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters. We decrease the number of input channels to 3x3 filters using squeeze modules, which we describe in the next section.\nStrategy 3. Downsample late in the network so that convolution layers have large activation maps. In a convolutional network, each convolution layer produces an output activation map with a spatial resolution that is at least 1x1 and often much larger than 1x1. The height and width of these activation maps are controlled by: (1) the size of the input data (e.g. 256x256 images) and (2) the choice of layers in which to downsample in the DNN architecture. Most commonly, downsampling is engineered into DNN architectures by setting the (stride > 1) in some of the convolution or pooling layers. If early2 layers in the network have large strides, then most layers will have small activation maps. Conversely, if most layers in the network have a stride of 1, and the strides greater than 1 are concentrated toward the end3 of the network, then many layers in the network will have large activation maps. Our intuition is that large activation maps due to delayed downsampling can lead to higher classification accuracy, with all else held equal. Indeed, K. He and H. Sun applied delayed downsampling to four different DNN architectures, and in each case delayed downsampling led to higher classification accuracy [10].\nStrategies 1 and 2 are about judiciously decreasing the quantity of parameters in a DNN while attempting to preserve accuracy. Strategy 3 is about maximizing accuracy on a limited budget of parameters. Next, we describe the Fire module, which is our building block for DNN architectures that achieve Strategies 1, 2, and 3.\n2In our terminology, an “early” layer is close to the input data. 3In our terminology, the “end” of the network is the classifier."

      "heading" : "2.2. The Fire Module",
      "text" : "We define the Fire module as follows. A Fire module is comprised of: a squeeze convolution module comprised of 1x1 filters, feeding into an expand module that is comprised of a mix of 1x1 and 3x3 convolution filters; we illustrate this in Figure 1. The liberal use of 1x1 filters in Fire modules allows us to leverage Strategy 1 from Section 2.1.\nWe expose three tunable dimensions (hyperparameters) in a Fire module: s1x1, e1x1, and e3x3. In a Fire module, s1x1 is the number of filters in the squeeze module (all 1x1), e1x1 is the number of 1x1 filters in the expand module, and e3x3 is the number of 3x3 filters in the expand module. When we use Fire modules we set s1x1 to be less than (e1x1 + e3x3), so the squeeze module helps to limit the number of input channels to the 3x3 filters, enabling Strategy 2 from Section 2.1."

We illustrate in Figure 2 that SqueezeNet begins with a standalone convolution layer (conv1), followed by 8 Fire modules (fire2-9), ending with a final conv layer (conv10). We gradually increase the number of filters per fire module from the beginning to the end of the network. SqueezeNet performs max-pooling with a stride of 2 after conv1, fire4, fire8, and conv10; these relatively late placements of pooling allow us to achieve Strategy 3 from Section 2.1. We present the full SqueezeNet architecture in Table 1."

For details on the training protocol (e.g. batch size, learning rate, parameter initialization), please refer to our Caffe [15] configuration files located here: https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet.\n• The Caffe framework does not natively support a convolution layer that contains multiple filter resolutions (e.g. 1x1 and 3x3). To get around this, we implement our expand modules with two separate convolution layers: a layer with 1x1 filters, and a layer with 3x3 filters. Then, we concatenate the outputs of these layers together in the channel dimension.

      "heading" : "3. Related Work",
      "text" : "The overarching goal of our work is to identify a model that has very few parameters while preserving accuracy. To\naddress this problem, a sensible approach is to take an existing DNN model and compress it in a lossy fashion. In fact, a research community has emerged around the topic of model compression, and several approaches have been reported. A fairly straightforward approach by Denton et al. is to apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to a pretrained DNN model [4]. Han et al. developed Network Pruning, which begins with a pretrained model, then replaces parameters that are below a certain threshold with zeros to form a sparse matrix, and finally performs a few iterations of training on the sparse DNN [9]. Recently, Han et al. extended their work by combining Network Pruning with quantization (to 8 bits or less) and huffman encoding to create an approach called Deep Compression [8]."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4. Evaluation",
      "text" : "We now turn our attention to evaluating SqueezeNet. In each of the DNN model compression papers reviewed in the previous section, the goal was to compress an AlexNet [16] model that was trained to classify images using the ImageNet [3] (ILSVRC 2012) dataset. Therefore, we use AlexNet4 and the associated model compression results as a basis for comparison when evaluating SqueezeNet.\nIn Table 2, we review SqueezeNet in the context of recent model compression results. The SVD-based approach is able to compress a pretrained AlexNet model by a factor of 5x, while diminishing accuracy to 56.0% top-1 accuracy [4]. Network Pruning achieves a 9x reduction in model size while maintaining the baseline of 57.2% top-1 and 80.3% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet [9]. Deep Compression achieves a 35x reduction in model size, while still maintaining the baseline accuracy level [8]. Now, with SqueezeNet, we achieve a 50x reduction in model size compared to AlexNet, while meeting or exceeding the top-1 and top-5 accuracy of AlexNet. We summarize all of the aforementioned results in Table 2.\nIt appears that we have surpassed the state-of-the-art results from the model compression community: even when using uncompressed 32-bit values to represent the model, SqueezeNet has a 1.4x smaller model size than the best efforts from the model compression community while maintaining or exceeding the baseline accuracy. Until now, an open question has been: are small models amenable to compression, or do small models “need” all of the representational power afforded by dense floating-point values? To find out, we applied Deep Compression [8] to SqueezeNet, using 50% sparsity5 and 8-bit quantization. This yields a 0.92 MB model (258x smaller than 32-bit AlexNet) with equivalent accuracy to AlexNet. Further, applying Deep Compression with 6-bit quantization and 45% sparsity on SqueezeNet, we produce a 0.52MB model (461x smaller than 32-bit AlexNet) with equivalent accuracy. It appears that our small model is indeed amenable to compression.\n4Our baseline is bvlc alexnet from the Caffe codebase [15]. 5Note that, due to the storage overhead of storing sparse matrix indices, increasing sparsity from 0% to 50% leads to somewhat less than a 2x decrease in model size.\nIn addition, these results demonstrate that Deep Compression [8] not only works well on DNN architectures with many parameters (e.g. AlexNet and VGG [19]), but it is also able to compress the already compact, fully convolutional SqueezeNet architecture. Deep Compression compressed SqueezeNet by 9.2x while preserving the baseline accuracy. By combining DNN architectural innovation (SqueezeNet) with state-of-the-art compression techniques (Deep Compression), we achieved a 461x reduction in model size with no decrease in accuracy compared to the baseline."

      "text" : "We have presented SqueezeNet, a DNN architecture that has 50x fewer parameters than AlexNet and maintains AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet. In this paper, we focused on ImageNet as a target dataset. However, it has become common practice to apply ImageNet-trained DNN representations to a variety of applications such as fine-grained object recognition [21, 5], logo identification in images [13], and generating sentences about images [6]. ImageNettrained DNNs have also been applied to a number of applications pertaining to autonomous driving, including pedestrian and vehicle detection in images [12, 7] and videos [2], as well as segmenting the shape of the road [1]. We think SqueezeNet will be a good candidate DNN architecture for a variety of applications, especially those in which small model size is of importance.\nSqueezeNet is one of several new DNNs that we have discovered while broadly exploring the design space of DNN architectures. We hope that SqueezeNet will inspire the reader to consider and explore the broad range of possibilities in the design space of DNN architectures."

    "abstractText" : "Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNetlevel accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 1MB (461x smaller than AlexNet). The SqueezeNet architecture is available for download here: https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet",
