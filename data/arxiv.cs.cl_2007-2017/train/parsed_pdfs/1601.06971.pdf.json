      "text" : "Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data :A Survey of Techniques\nVishal.A.Kharde1, Prof.S.S.Sonawane2 Department of Computer Engg,\nPune Institute of Computer Technology,Pune University of Pune (India)\n1vishal.kharde@india.com; 2sssonawane@pict.edu Abstract: With the advancement of web technology and its growth, there is a huge volume of data present in the web for internet users and a lot of data is generated too. Internet has become a platform for online learning, exchanging ideas and sharing opinions. Social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, Google+ are rapidly gaining popularity as they allow people to share and express their views about topics,have discussion with different communities, or post messages across the world. There has been lot of work in the field of sentiment analysis of twitter data. This survey focuses mainly on sentiment analysis of twitter data which is helpful to analyze the information in the tweets where opinions are highly unstructured, heterogeneous and are either positive or negative, or neutral in some cases. In this paper, we provide a survey and a comparative analyses of existing techniques for opinion mining like machine learning and lexicon-based approaches, together with evaluation metrics. Using various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Max Entropy, and Support Vector Machine, we provide a research on twitter data streams. We have also discussed general challenges and applications of Sentiment Analysis on Twitter. Index Terms: Twitter, Sentiment analysis (SA), Opinion mining, Machine learning, Naive Bayes (NB), Maximum Entropy, Support Vector Machine (SVM).\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNowadays, the age of Internet has changed the way people express their views, opinions. It is now mainly done through blog posts, online forums, product review websites, social media ,etc. Nowadays, millions of people are using social network sites like Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, etc. to express their emotions, opinion and share views about their daily lives. Through the online communities, we get an interactive media where consumers inform and influence others through forums. Social media is generating a large volume of sentiment rich data in the form of tweets, status updates, blog posts, comments, reviews, etc. Moreover, social media provides an opportunity for businesses by giving a platform to connect with their customers for advertising. People mostly depend upon user generated content over online to a great extent for decision making. For e.g. if someone wants to buy a product or wants to use any service, then they firstly look up its reviews online, discuss about it on social media before taking a decision. The amount of content generated by users is too vast for a normal user to analyze. So\nthere is a need to automate this, various sentiment analysis techniques are widely used. Sentiment analysis (SA) tells user whether the information about the product is satisfactory or not before they buy it. Marketers and firms use this analysis data to understand about their products or services in such a way that it can be offered as per the user’s requirements. Textual Information retrieval techniques mainly focus on processing, searching or analyzing the factual data present. Facts have an objective component but, there are some other textual contents which express subjective characteristics. These contents are mainly opinions, sentiments, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions, which form the core of Sentiment Analysis (SA). It offers many challenging opportunities to develop new applications, mailnly due to the huge growth of available information on online sources like blogs and social networks. For example, recommendations of items proposed by a recommendation system can be predicted by taking into account considerations such as positive or negative opinions about those items by making use of SA."

      "text" : "Sentiment analysis can be defined as a process that automates mining of attitudes, opinions, views and emotions from text, speech, tweets and database sources through Natural Language Processing (NLP). Sentiment analysis involves classifying opinions in text into categories like \"positive\" or \"negative\" or \"neutral\". It's also referred as subjectivity analysis, opinion mining, and appraisal extraction. The words opinion, sentiment, view and belief are used interchangeably but there are differences between them. • Opinion: A conclusion open to dispute (because different\nexperts have different opinions ) • View: subjective opinion • Belief: deliberate acceptance and intellectual assent • Sentiment: opinion representing one‘s feelings An example for terminologies for Sentiment Analysis is as given below,\nSentiment Analysis is a term that include many tasks such as sentiment extraction, sentiment classification, subjectivity classification, summarization of opinions or opinion spam detection, among others. It aims to analyze people's sentiments, , attitudes, opinions emotions, etc. towards elements such as, products, individuals, topics ,organizations, and services. Mathematically we can represent an opinion as a quintuple (o, f, so, h, t), where o = object; f = feature of the object o; so = orientation or polarity of the opinion on feature f of object o; h = opinion holder; t = time when the opinion is expressed. Object: An entity which can be a, person, event, product ,organization, or topic Feature: An attribute (or a part) of the object with respect to which evaluation is made. Opinion orientation or polarity: The orientation of an opinion on a feature f represent whether the opinion is positive, negative or neutral . Opinion holder: The holder of an opinion is the person or organization or an entity that expresses the opinion . In recent years a lot of work has been done in the field of “Sentiment Analysis on Twitter“ by number of researchers. In its early stage it was intended for binary classification which assigns opinions or reviews to bipolar classes such as positive or negative only. Pak and Paroubek(2010) [1] proposed a model to classify the tweets as objective, positive and negative. They created a twitter corpus by collecting tweets using Twitter API and automatically annotating those tweets using emoticons. Using that corpus, theydeveloped a sentiment classifier based on the multinomial Naive Bayes method that uses features like Ngram and POS-tags. The training set they used was less efficient since it contains only tweets having emoticons. Parikh and Movassate(2009) [2] implemented two models, a Naive Bayes bigram model and a Maximum Entropy model to classify tweets. They found that the Naive Bayes classifiers worked much better than the Maximum Entropy model. Go and L.Huang (2009) [3] proposed a solution for sentiment analysis for twitter data by using distant supervision, in which their training data consisted of tweets with emoticons which served as noisy labels. They build\nmodels using Naive Bayes, MaxEnt and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Their feature space consisted of unigrams, bigrams and POS. They concluded that SVM outperformed other models and that unigram were more effective as features. Barbosa et al.(2010) [4] designed a two phase automatic sentiment analysis method for classifying tweets. They classified tweets as objective or subjective and then in second phase, the subjective tweets were classified as positive or negative. The feature space used included retweets, hashtags, link, punctuation and exclamation marks in conjunction with features like prior polarity of words and POS. Bifet and Frank(2010) [5] used Twitter streaming data provided by Firehouse API , which gave all messages from every user which are publicly available in real-time. They experimented multinomial naive Bayes, stochastic gradient descent, and the Hoeffding tree. They arrived at a conclusion that SGD-based model, when used with an appropriate learning rate was the better than the rest used. Agarwal et al. (2011)[6] developed a 3-way model for classifying sentiment into positive, negative and neutral classes. They experimented with models such as: unigram model, a feature based model and a tree kernel based model. For tree kernel based model they represented tweets as a tree.The feature based model uses 100 features and the unigram model uses over 10,000 features. They arrived on a conclusion that features which combine prior polarity of words with their parts-of-speech(pos) tags are most important and plays a major role in the classification task. The tree kernel based model outperformed the other two models. Davidov et al.,(2010) [7] proposed a approach to utilize Twitter user-defined hastags in tweets as a classification of sentiment type using punctuation, single words, n-grams and patterns as different feature types, which are then combined into a single feature vector for sentiment classification. They made use of K-Nearest Neighbor strategy to assign sentiment labels by constructing a feature vector for each example in the training and test set. Po-Wei Liang et.al.(2014) [8] used Twitter API to collect twitter data. Their training data falls in three different categories (camera, movie , mobile). The data is labeled as positive, negative and non-opinions. Tweets containing opinions were filtered. Unigram Naive Bayes model was implemented and the Naive Bayes simplifying independence assumption was employed. They also eliminated useless features by using the Mutual Information and Chi square feature extraction method. Finally , the orientation of an tweet is predicted. i.e. positive or negative. Pablo et. al. [9] presented variations of Naive Bayes classifiers for detecting polarity of English tweets. Two different variants of Naive Bayes classifiers were built namely Baseline (trained to classify tweets as positive, negative and neutral), and Binary (makes use of a polarity lexicon and classifies as positive and negative. Neutral tweets neglected). The features considered by classifiers were Lemmas (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), Polarity\nLexicons, and Multiword from different sources and Valence Shifters. Turney et al [11] used bag-of-words method for sentiment analysis in which the relationships between words was not at all considered and a document is represented as just a collection of words. To determine the sentiment for the whole document, sentiments of every word was determined and those values are united with some aggregation functions. Kamps et al. [12] used the lexical database WordNet to determine the emotional content of a word along different dimensions. They developed a distance metric on WordNet and determined semantic polarity of adjectives. Xia et al. [13] used an ensemble framework for Sentiment Classification which is obtained by combining various feature sets and classification techniques. In thier work, they used two types of feature sets (Part-of-speech information and Wordrelations) and three base classifiers (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines) . They applied ensemble approaches like fixed combination, weighted combination and Meta-classifier combination for sentiment classification and obtained better accuracy. Luo et. al. [13] highlighted the challenges and an efficient techniques to mine opinions from Twitter tweets. Spam and wildly varying language makes opinion retrieval within Twitter challenging task. A General model for sentiment analysis is as follows,\nFig.1. Sentiment Analysis Architecture Following are the phases required for sentiment analysis of twitter data, A. Pre-processing of the datasets:\nA tweet contains a lot of opinions about the data which are expressed in different ways by different users .The twitter dataset used in this survey work is already labeled into two classes viz. negative and positive polarity and thus the sentiment analysis of the data becomes easy to observe the effect of various features. The raw data having polarity is highly susceptible to inconsistency and redundancy. Preprocessing of tweet include following points, • Remove all URLs (e.g. www.xyz.com), hash tags (e.g. #topic), targets (@username) • Correct the spellings; sequence of repeated characters is to be handled • Replace all the emoticons with their sentiment. • Remove all punctuations ,symbols,numbers • Using a POS tagger, the NL Processor linguistic Parser , we\ntag the adjectives, verbs and adverbs • Remove Stop Words • Expand Acronyms(we can use a acronym dictionary) • Remove Non-English Tweets"

      "text" : "The preprocessed dataset has many distinctive properties.In the feature extraction method,we extract the aspects from the processed dataset. Later this aspect are used to compute the positive and negative polarity in a sentence which is useful for determining the opinion of the individuals using models like unigram,bigram [18].\nMachine learning techniques require representing the key features of text or documents for processing. These key features are c o n s i d e r e d as feature vectors which are used for the classification task.. Some examples features that have been reported in literature are:\n1. Words And Their Frequencies: Unigrams, bigrams and n-gram models with their frequency counts are considered as features. There has been more reseach on using word presence rather than frequencies to\nbetter describe this feature. Pang et al. [23] showed better results by using presence instead of frequencies. 2. Parts Of Speech Tags Parts of speech like adjectives, adverbs and some groups of verbs and nouns are good indicators of subjectivity and sentiment. We can generate syntactic dependency patterns by parsing or dependency trees. 3. Opinion Words And Phrases Apart from specific words, some phrases and idioms which convey sentiments can be used as features. e.g. cost someone an arm and leg. 4. Position Of Terms The position of a term within a text can affect on how much the term makes difference in overall sentiment of the text. 5. Negation Negation is an important but difficult feature to interpret. The presence of a negation usually changes the polarity of the opinion.. e.g., no doubt android is best in the market currently. 6. Syntax Syntactic patterns like collocations are used as features to learn subjectivity patterns by many of the researchers."

      "text" : "It is a probabilistic classifier and can learn the pattern of examining a set of documents that has been categorized [9]. It compares the contents with the list of words to classify the documents to their right category or class. Let d be the tweet and c* be a class that is assigned to d, where\nFrom the above equation, ‘f’ is a ‘feature’, count of feature (fi) is denoted with ni(d) and is present in d which represents a tweet. Here, m denotes no. of features.\nParameters P(c) and P(f|c) are computed through maximum likelihood estimates, and smoothing is utilized for unseen features. To train and classify using Naïve Bayes Machine Learning technique ,we can use the Python NLTK library . 2. Maximum Entropy:\nIn Maximum Entropy Classifier, no assumptions are taken regarding the relationship inbetween the features extracted from dataset. This classifier always tries to maximize the entropy of the system by estimating the conditional distribution of the class label. Maximum entropy even handles overlap feature and is same as logistic regression method which finds the distribution over classes. The conditional distribution is defined as MaxEnt makes no independence assumptions for its features, unlike Naive Bayes. The model is represented by the following:\nWhere c is the class,d is the tweet and λi is the weight vector.The weight vectors decide the importance of a feature in classification. 3. Support Vector Machine:\nSupport vector machine analyzes the data, define the decision boundaries and uses the kernels for computation which are performed in input space[15]. The input data are two sets of vectors of size m each. Then every data which represented as a vector is classified into a class. Nextly we find a margin between the two classes that is far from any document. The distance defines the margin of the classifier, maximizing the margin reduces indecisive decisions. SVM also supports classification and regression which are useful for statistical learning theory and it also helps recognizing the factors precisely, that needs to be taken into account, to understand it successfully."

The machine learning approach applicable to sentiment analysis mainly belongs to supervised classification. In a machine learning techniques, two sets of data are needed:\n1. Training Set 2. Test Set.\nA number of machine learning techniques have been formulated to classify the tweets into classes. Machine learning techniques like Naive Bayes (NB), maximum entropy (ME), and support vector machines (SVM) have achieved great success in sentiment analysis. Machine learning starts with collecting training dataset. Nextly we train a classifier on the training data. Once a supervised classification technique is selected, an important decision to make is to select feature. They can tell us how documents are represented. The most commonly used features in sentiment classification are :\n• Term presence and their frequency • Part of speech information • Negations • Opinion words and phrases\nFig.2 Sentiment Classification Based On Emoticons\nWith respect to supervised techniques, support vector machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy are some of the most common techniques used.

Bigram effectively captures some features in the data that unigram fails to capture. For example, words like ’not sad’, ’not good’ clearly say that the sentiment is negative.

In particular, the feature combination of Slang stopwords removal and Bigram gives the maximum accuracy of 77.73 with SVM.\nMaximum Entropy model gives an accuracy consistently inbetween Naive Bayes and SVM. Also it runs iteratively and takes a large amount of time to run. Hence MaxEnt was not used for all the feature combinations.\nFig.7 Graph Representing Different results obtained for\nNaïve Bayes Algorithm And Linear SVC (SVM)."

      "heading" : "VIII. CHALLENGES IN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS",
      "text" : "Sentiment Analysis is a very challenging task. Following are some of the challenges[13] faced in Sentiment Analysis of Twitter."
    }, {
      "heading" : "1. Identifying subjective portions of text:",
      "text" : "Subjective portion here refers to sentiment-bearing content. The same word can be treated as subjective in one context, while it might be objective in some other. This makes it difficult to identify the subjective portions of text.\nFor example: 1. The language of the author was very crude. 2. Crude oil is extracted from the sea beds. The same word ‘crude’ is used as an opinion in first sentence, while it is completely objective in the second sentence. 2. Associating sentiment with keywords:\nIt is difficult to pinpoint the source of these sentiments in sentences having strong opinion. Hence an association to a keyword or phrase is difficult. For example: Every time I read `Pride and Prejudice' I want to dig her up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone. In this example, ‘her’ refers to the character in the book ‘Pride and Prejudice’, which is not explicitly mentioned. In such cases the negative sentiment must be associated with the character in the book. 3. Domain dependence[24]:\nThe same sentence or phrase can have different meanings in different domains. For Example, the word ‘unpredictable’ is positive in the domain of movies, but if the same word is used in the context of a vehicle's steering, then it has a negative opinion.\n4. Sarcasm Detection:\nSarcastic sentences express negative opinion about a target using positive words in unique way.. Example: Nice perfume. You must marinate in it. The sentence contains only positive words but actually it expresses a negative sentiment. 5. Thwarted expressions:\nThere are some sentences in which only some part of text determines the overall polarity of the document. Example: This Movie should be amazing. It sounds like a great plot, the popular actors , and the supporting cast is talented as well.\nHowever, it can't hold up. Simple bag-of-words approaches will term it as positive sentiment, but the ultimate sentiment is negative. 6. Indirect negation of sentiment:\nSentiment can be negated in many ways as opposed to using simple no, not, never, etc. It is difficult to identify such negations easily. Example: It avoids all clichés and predictability found in Hollywood movies. While the words cliche and predictable bear a negative sentiment, the usage of ‘avoids’ negates their respective sentiments. 7. Order dependence:\nDiscourse Structure analysis is essential for Sentiment Analysis/Opinion Mining. For example: A is better than B, conveys the exact opposite opinion from, B is better than A. 8. Entity Recognition:\nThere is a need to separate out the text about a specific entity and then analyze sentiment towards it. For Example: “I hate Microsoft, but I like Linux”. A simple bag-of-words approach will label it as neutral, however, it carries a specific sentiment for both the entities present in the statement."

    }, {
      "heading" : "10. Handling comparisons.",
      "text" : "Bag of words model doesn't handle comparisons very well. Example: \"IIT’s are better than most of the private colleges\", the tweet would be considered positive for both IIT’s and private colleges using bag of words model because it doesn't take into account the relation towards \"better\". 11. Applying sentiment analysis to Facebook messages.\nThere has been less work on sentiment analysis on Facebook data mainly due to various restrictions by Facebook graph api and security policies in accessing data.\n12. Internationalization [16,17].\nCurrent Research work focus mainly on English content, but Twitter has many varied users from across."

This includes product reviews, feedbacks on political issues, comments about services, etc. Thus there is a need for a sentiment analysis system that can extract sentiments about a particular product or services. It will help in providing feedback or rating for the given product,item,etc.This would serve the needs of both the users and the vendors."

      "heading" : "3. Applications in Business Intelligence",
      "text" : "It has been observed that people nowadays tend to look upon reviews of products online before buying them. And for many businesses the online opinion can make or break their product.

Recently there has been lot of research going on Internet of Things(IoT). Sentiment Analysis would also find its way in IoT. Like for example, based on the current sentiment or emotion of the user, the home could alter its ambiance to create a soothing and peaceful environment. Sentiment Analysis can also be used in trend prediction. By tracking public views, important data regarding sales trends and customer satisfaction can be extracted."

Research results show that machine learning methods, such as SVM and naive Bayes have the highest accuracy and can be regarded as the baseline learning methods, while lexicon-based methods are very effective in some cases, which require few effort in human-labeled document.We also studied the effects of various features on classifier.We can conclude that more the cleaner data,more accurate results can be obtained.Use of bigram model provides better sentiment accuracy as compared to other models. In future, we can focus on the study on combining machine learning method into opinion lexicon method in order to improve the accuracy of sentiment classification and adaptive capacity to variety of domains and different languages."
