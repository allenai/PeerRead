      "text" : "The theory of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic developed by Zadeh (1965) has been applied to model uncertainty or lack of knowledge when applied to a variety of MCDM problems. Bellman & Zadeh (1970) introduced the theory of fuzzy sets in problems of MCDM as an effective approach to treat vagueness, lack of knowledge and ambiguity inherent in the human decision making process, which are known as fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (FMCDM).\nFor real world-problems the decision matrix is affected by uncertainty, which may be modeled using fuzzy numbers. A fuzzy number (Dubois and Prade, 1980) can be seen as an extension of an interval with varied grade of membership. This means that each value in the interval has associated a real number that indicates its compatibility with the vague statement associated with a fuzzy number. MCDM methods like the standard TOPSIS (Hwang and Yoon, 1980) and TODIM (Gomes and Rangel, 1992) in the last few years have largely been applied to a variety of MCDM problems.\nTOPSIS has been generalized to deal with a variety of information types. For example, interval numbers (Jahanshahloo, Lotfi, & Davoodi, 2009; Dymova, Sevastjanov, Tikhonenko, 2013), probability distributions (Wentao, Huan, 2010), fuzzy information (Chen, 2000; Chen, Tsao, 2003; Wang, Liu, and Zhang, 2005; Wang, Lee, and Lin, 2003; Wang, and Lee, 2008, Krohling and Campanharo, 2011), intuitionistic fuzzy information (Yue, 2014), interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information (Ye, 2010, Park et al., 2011), among many others. For the reader interested in TOPSIS for hybrid data types, we recommend Lourenzutti and Krohling (2016).\nThe TODIM method has also been extended to different types of information. Firstly, Krohling and de Souza (2012) proposed the fuzzy TODIM to treat fuzzy numbers. Another important aspect in the treatment of uncertainties is the reliability of information. So, the fuzzy TODIM was extended to intuitionistic fuzzy TODIM (Krohling, Pacheco and Siviero, 2013; Lourenzutti and Krohling, 2013). The latter is able to deal with uncertainty described by\nintuitionistic fuzzy numbers (Atanassov, 1986). Zhang, and Xu (2014) extended the TODIM for hesitant fuzzy information. For information described by probability distributions were developed the Hellinger TODIM and the Hellinger TOPSIS (Lourenzutti and Krohling, 2014; Krohling, Lourenzutti, and Campos, 2015). However, in many decision-making problems, the data come from different sources, which means that data can be presented in numerical format, interval, fuzzy, fuzzy intuitionist, or even described by probability distributions. So, a method for decision-making should be able to process simultaneously hybrid information, i.e., information in different formats is very desired and have been presented (Wang and Wang, 2008; Fan et al. (2013); Lourenzutti and Krohling 2016).\nBoth methods TOPSIS and TODIM and their extension have successfully been applied to tackle different kinds of information to solve MCDM problems, but one very important aspect in decision making is the reliability of the information involved in the process. Z-numbers were proposed by Zadeh (2011) as a new way to treat uncertainty and reliability of information. Znumbers are composed of two parts, the first one is a restriction on the values that can be assumed, and the second part is the reliability of the information. Z-numbers can be used to model sentences like \"the temperature in summer will be very hot, very sure,\" or \"the journey time from home to university takes about half hour, very likely.\" As human beings we communicate with other people by means of natural language using sentences like the ones mentioned above. The standard approach to work with Z-number was presented by Kang et al. (2012a), where a procedure to convert Z-numbers into fuzzy numbers has been proposed. The same authors, Kang et al. (2012b) apply the procedure to solve MCDM problems after converting Z-numbers to crisp values.\nAzadeh et al. (2013) presented a new AHP method based on Z-number to deal with linguistic decision making problems. An application to search the criteria's for the evaluation of best universities. Xiao (2014) proposed a method for fuzzy multi-criteria decision making with Znumbers, where the evaluation of each alternative with respect to each criterion is described as a Z-number. The Z-numbers in the decision making matrix are converted to crisp numbers and the author show the effectiveness of their method. Patel, Rahimi, & Khorasani (2015) provided an applied model of Z-numbers based on certain realistic assumptions regarding probability distributions. Aliev, Alizadeh, Huseynov (2015) proposed an arithmetic to discrete Z-numbers as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root and other operations. The authors state that problems involving computation with Z-numbers is far from easy to solve.\nIn this paper, the goal consists in the extension of fuzzy TODIM to handle uncertain decision matrices described by Z-numbers. In section 2, we provide some background on fuzzy multicriteria decision making. In addition we review fuzzy TODIM and fuzzy TOPSIS. In section 3, we give the necessary background on Z-numbers, and the procedure to convert Z-numbers into trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Next, we present the Z-TODIM and the Z-TOPSIS. In section 4, we illustrate the method using two case studies showing the results and the feasibility of the approach. In section 5, we present some conclusions and directions for future works."

A Z-number is defined by the tuple (A, B), where A and B are fuzzy numbers, and a Z-valuation by a tuple of the form (X, A, B), which can be understood by X is (A, B), where X is a variable. Z-valuations can be used to model sentences like the \"temperature in summer will be very hot, very sure\", whereas X is the variable that is \"the temperature\", A is the fuzzy number \"very hot\" and B the number \"very sure\". In the above example you can get a better idea of the meaning of A and B by interpreting A as a restriction of the values that the temperature can assume, i.e., very hot and B as a fuzzy restriction on the probability of X be A, i.e., (Prob (X is A) is B). Since Z-numbers represent a relatively new concept, some operations as distance calculation between two Z-numbers are not defined yet. So, in order to overcome the difficulties to work with Z numbers is required a conversion to standard fuzzy numbers."

      "context" : "intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (Atanassov, 1986). Zhang, and Xu (2014) extended the TODIM for hesitant fuzzy information. For information described by probability distributions were developed the Hellinger TODIM and the Hellinger TOPSIS (Lourenzutti and Krohling, 2014; Krohling, Lourenzutti, and Campos, 2015). However, in many decision-making problems, the data come from different sources, which means that data can be presented in numerical format, interval, fuzzy, fuzzy intuitionist, or even described by probability distributions. So, a method for decision-making should be able to process simultaneously hybrid information, i.e., information in different formats is very desired and have been presented (Wang and Wang, 2008; Fan et al. (2013); Lourenzutti and Krohling 2016). Both methods TOPSIS and TODIM and their extension have successfully been applied to tackle different kinds of information to solve MCDM problems, but one very important aspect in decision making is the reliability of the information involved in the process. Z-numbers were proposed by Zadeh (2011) as a new way to treat uncertainty and reliability of information. Znumbers are composed of two parts, the first one is a restriction on the values that can be assumed, and the second part is the reliability of the information. Z-numbers can be used to model sentences like \"the temperature in summer will be very hot, very sure,\" or \"the journey time from home to university takes about half hour, very likely.\" As human beings we communicate with other people by means of natural language using sentences like the ones mentioned above. The standard approach to work with Z-number was presented by Kang et al. (2012a), where a procedure to convert Z-numbers into fuzzy numbers has been proposed. The same authors, Kang et al. (2012b) apply the procedure to solve MCDM problems after converting Z-numbers to crisp values. Azadeh et al. (2013) presented a new AHP method based on Z-number to deal with linguistic decision making problems. An application to search the criteria's for the evaluation of best universities. Xiao (2014) proposed a method for fuzzy multi-criteria decision making with Znumbers, where the evaluation of each alternative with respect to each criterion is described as a Z-number. The Z-numbers in the decision making matrix are converted to crisp numbers and the author show the effectiveness of their method. Patel, Rahimi, & Khorasani (2015) provided an applied model of Z-numbers based on certain realistic assumptions regarding probability distributions. Aliev, Alizadeh, Huseynov (2015) proposed an arithmetic to discrete Z-numbers as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root and other operations.",
