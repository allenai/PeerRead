      "text" : "The k-means problem and its variants constitute one of the most popular paradigms for clustering [Jain, 2010]. Given a set of n data points, the task is to group them into k clusters, each defined by a cluster center, such that the sum of distances from points to cluster centers (raised to a power `) is minimized. Optimal clustering in this sense is known to be NP-hard, in particular for k-means (` = 2) [Dasgupta, 2008, Aloise et al., 2009, Mahajan et al., 2009, Awasthi et al., 2015] and k-medians (` = 1) [Jain et al., 2002]. In practice, the most widely used algorithm remains Lloyd’s [1957, 1982] (often referred to as the k-means algorithm), which alternates between updating centers given cluster assignments and re-assigning points to clusters.\nIn this paper, we study an enhancement to Lloyd’s algorithm known as k-means++ [Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007] and the more general class of D` sampling algorithms to which k-means++ belongs. These algorithms select cluster centers randomly from the given data points with probabilities proportional to their current costs. The clustering can then be refined using Lloyd’s algorithm. D` sampling is attractive for two reasons: First, it is guaranteed to yield an expected O(log k) approximation to the optimal clustering with k centers [Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007]. Second, it is as simple as Lloyd’s algorithm, both conceptually as well as computationally with O(nkd) running time in d dimensions.\nThe particular focus of this paper is on the setting where an optimal k-clustering remains the benchmark but more than k cluster centers can be sampled to improve the approximation. Specifically, it is shown (see Theorem 1 and Corollary 1) that for any constant factor β > 1, if βk centers are chosen byD` sampling, then a constant-factor approximation to the optimal k-clustering is obtained. This guarantee holds in expectation and for all datasets, like the one in Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007], and improves upon the O(log k) factor therein. Such a result is known as a constant-factor bi-criteria approximation since both the optimal cost and the relevant degrees of freedom (k in this case) are exceeded but only by constant factors.\nIn the context of clustering, bi-criteria approximations can be valuable because an appropriate number of clusters k is almost never known or pre-specified in practice. Approaches to determining k from the data are all ideally based on knowing how the optimal cost decreases as k increases, but obtaining this optimal trade-off between cost and k is NP-hard as mentioned earlier. Alternatively, a simpler algorithm that has a constant-factor bi-criteria guarantee would ensure that the trade-off curve generated by this algorithm\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n04 98\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n6 M\nay 2\ndeviates by no more than constant factors along both axes from the optimal curve. This may be more appealing than a deviation along the cost axis that grows with k. Furthermore, if a solution with a specified number of clusters k is truly required, then linear programming techniques can be used to select a k-subset from the βk cluster centers while still maintaining a constant-factor approximation [Aggarwal et al., 2009, Charikar et al., 2002].\nThe main result in this paper differs from the constant-factor bi-criteria approximation established in Aggarwal et al. [2009] in that the latter holds only with constant probability as opposed to in expectation. Using Markov’s inequality, a constant-probability corollary can be derived from Theorem 1 herein, and doing so improves upon the approximation factor of Aggarwal et al. [2009] by more than a factor of 2. The present paper also differs from recent work on more general bi-criteria approximation of k-means by Makarychev et al. [2015], which analyzes substantially more complex algorithms.\nIn the next section, existing work on D` sampling and clustering approximations in general is reviewed in more detail. Section 2 gives a formal statement of the problem, the D` sampling algorithm, and existing lemmas regarding the algorithm. Section 3 states the main results of the paper and compares them to previous results. Proofs are presented in Section 4 and the paper concludes in Section 5."

      "text" : "There is a considerable literature on approximation algorithms for k-means, k-medians, and related problems, spanning a wide range in the trade-off between tighter approximation factors and lower algorithm complexity. At one end, exact algorithms [Inaba et al., 1994] and several polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTAS) [Matoušek, 2000, Badoiu et al., 2002, de la Vega et al., 2003, Har-Peled and Mazumdar, 2004, Kumar et al., 2010, Chen, 2009, Feldman et al., 2007, Jaiswal et al., 2014] have been proposed for k-means and k-medians. While these have polynomial running times in n, the dependence on k and sometimes on the dimension d is exponential or worse. A simpler local search algorithm was shown to yield a ((3+2/p)`+ ) approximation for k-means (` = 2) in Kanungo et al. [2004] and k-medians (` = 1) in Arya et al. [2004], the latter under the additional constraint that centers are chosen from a finite set. This local search however requires a polynomial number of iterations of complexity nO(p), and Kanungo et al. [2004] also rely on a discretization to an -approximate centroid set [Matoušek, 2000] of size O(n −d log(1/ )). Linear programming algorithms offer similar constant-factor guarantees with similar running times for kmedians (again the finite set variant) and the related problem of facility location [Charikar et al., 2002, Jain and Vazirani, 2001].\nIn contrast to the above, this paper focuses on simpler algorithms in the D` sampling class, including k-means++. In Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007], it was proved that D` sampling results in an O(log k) approximation, in expectation and for all datasets. The current work builds upon Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007] to extend the guarantee to the constant-factor bi-criteria regime. Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007] also provided a matching lower bound, exhibiting a dataset on which k-means++ achieves an expected Ω(log k) approximation.\nSampling algorithms have been shown to yield improved O(1) approximation factors provided that the dataset satisfies certain conditions. Such a result was established in Ostrovsky et al. [2012] for k-means++ and other variants of Lloyd’s algorithm under the condition that the dataset is well-suited in a sense to partitioning into k clusters. In Mettu and Plaxton [2004], anO(1) approximation was shown for a somewhat more complicated algorithm called successive sampling with O(n(k + log n) + k2 log2 n) running time, subject to a bound on the dispersion of the points. A constant-factor approximation with slightly superlinear running time has also been obtained in the streaming setting [Guha et al., 2003].\nFor k-means++, the Ω(log k) lower bound in Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007], which holds in expectation, has spurred follow-on works on the question of whether k-means++ might guarantee a constant-factor approximation with reasonably large probability. Negative answers were provided by Brunsch and Röglin\n[2013], who showed that an approximation factor better than (2/3) log k cannot be achieved with probability higher than a decaying exponential in k, and Bhattacharya et al. [2014], who showed that a similar statement holds even in 2 dimensions.\nIn a similar direction to the one pursued in the present work, Aggarwal et al. [2009] showed that if the number of cluster centers can be increased to a constant factor times k, then a constant-factor approximation can be achieved with constant probability. Specifically, they prove that using d16(k+ √ k)e centers gives an approximation factor of 20 with probability 0.03, together with a general bi-criteria guarantee but without explicit constants. An O(1) factor was also obtained independently by Ailon et al. [2009] using more centers, of order O(k log k). As mentioned, the result of Aggarwal et al. [2009] differs from Theorem 1 herein in being true with constant probability as opposed to in expectation. Furthermore, Section 3.1 shows that a constant-probability corollary of Theorem 1 improves significantly upon Aggarwal et al. [2009].\nRecently, Makarychev et al. [2015] has also established constant-factor bi-criteria results for k-means. Their work differs from the present paper in studying more complex algorithms. First, similar to Kanungo et al. [2004], Makarychev et al. [2015] reduce the k-means problem to an -approximate, finite-set instance of k-medians of size nO(log(1/ )/\n2). Subsequently, linear programming and local search algorithms are considered, the latter the same as in Kanungo et al. [2004], Arya et al. [2004], and both with polynomial complexity in the size of the k-medians instance."

The choice ` = 1 is also popular and corresponds to the k-medians problem.\nThroughout this paper, an optimal clustering will always refer to one that minimizes (1) over solutions with t = k clusters, where k ≥ 2 is given.

Subsequently in Section 3.1, the results are discussed in the context of previous work.\nTheorem 1. Let φ be the potential resulting from selecting βk cluster centers according to Algorithm 1, where β ≥ 1. The expected approximation ratio is then bounded as\nE[φ] φ∗ ≤ r(`)D\n( 1 + min { ϕ(k − 2)\n(β − 1)k + ϕ ,Hk−1\n}) −Θ ( 1\nn\n) ,\nwhere ϕ = (1 + √\n5)/2 . = 1.618 is the golden ratio and Hk = 1 + 12 + · · ·+ 1 k ∼ log k is the kth harmonic\nnumber.\nIn the proof of Theorem 1 in Section 4.2, it is shown that the 1/n term is indeed non-positive and can therefore be omitted, with negligible loss for large n.\nThe approximation ratio bound in Theorem 1 is stated as a function of k. The following corollary confirms that the theorem also implies a constant-factor bi-criteria approximation.\nCorollary 1. With the same definitions as in Theorem 1, the expected approximation ratio is bounded as\nE[φ] φ∗ ≤ r(`)D\n( 1 + ϕ\nβ − 1\n) .\nProof. The minimum appearing in Theorem 1 is bounded from above by its first term. This term is in turn increasing in k with asymptote ϕ/(β − 1), which can therefore be taken as a k-independent bound.\nIt follows from Corollary 1 that a constant “oversampling” ratio β > 1 leads to a constant-factor approximation. Theorem 1 offers a further refinement for finite k.\nThe bounds in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 consist of two factors. As β increases, the second, parenthesized factor decreases to 1 either exactly or approximately as 1/(β − 1). The first factor of r(`)D however is no smaller than 4, and is a direct consequence of Lemma 2. Any improvement of Lemma 2 would therefore strengthen the approximation factors above. This subject is briefly discussed in Section 5."

      "text" : "A comparison of Theorem 1 to results in Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007] is implicit in its statement since the Hk−1 term in the minimum comes directly from Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007, Theorems 3.1 and 5.1]. For k = 2, 3, the first term in the minimum is smaller than Hk−1 for any β ≥ 1, and hence Theorem 1 is always an improvement. For k > 3, Theorem 1 improves upon Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007] for β greater than the critical value\nβc = 1 + φ(k − 2−Hk−1)\nkHk−1 .\nNumerical evaluation of βc shows that it reaches a maximum value of 1.204 at k = 22 and then decreases back toward 1 roughly as 1/Hk−1. It can be concluded that for any k, at most 20% oversampling is required for Theorem 1 to guarantee a better approximation than Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007].\nThe most closely related result to Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 is found in Aggarwal et al. [2009, Theorem 1]. The latter establishes a constant-factor bi-criteria approximation that holds with constant probability, as opposed to in expectation. Since a bound on the expectation implies a bound with constant probability via Markov’s inequality, a direct comparison with Aggarwal et al. [2009] is possible. Specifically, for ` = 2 and the t = d16(k + √ k)e cluster centers assumed in Aggarwal et al. [2009], Theorem 1 in the present work implies that\nE[φ] φ∗ ≤ 8\n( 1 + min { ϕ(k − 2)\nd15k + 16 √ ke+ ϕ ,Hk−1 }) ≤ 8 ( 1 + ϕ\n15\n) ,\nafter taking k →∞. Then by Markov’s inequality,\nφ φ∗ ≤ 8 0.97\n( 1 + ϕ\n15\n) . = 9.137\nwith probability at least 1 − 0.97 = 0.03 as in Aggarwal et al. [2009]. This 9.137 approximation factor is less than half the factor of 20 in Aggarwal et al. [2009].\nCorollary 1 may also be compared to the results in Makarychev et al. [2015], although it should be re-emphasized that the latter analyzes different, substantially more complex algorithms, with running time at least nO(log(1/ )/\n2) for reasonably small . The main difference between Corollary 1 and the bounds in Makarychev et al. [2015] is the extra factor of r(`)D since the factor of 1 + φ/(β − 1) is comparable, at least for moderate values of β that are of practical interest. As discussed above and in Section 5, the factor of r(`)D is due to Lemma 2 and is unlikely to be intrinsic to the D` sampling algorithm."

We consider the two cases in which the first of the t+1 new centers is chosen from either the covered set V or the uncovered set U , similar to the proof of Lemma 4. Denote by φ1 the potential after adding the first new center.\nCovered case: This case occurs with probability φ(V)/φ and leaves the covered and uncovered sets unchanged. We then invoke Lemma 3 with (t, u+ 1) (one fewer center to add) and φ1 playing the role of φ. The contribution to E[φ′ | φ] from this case is then bounded by\nφ(V) φ\n( cV(t, u+ 1)φ 1(V) + cU (t, u+ 1)ρ(U) )\n≤ φ(V) φ (cV(t, u+ 1)φ(V) + cU (t, u+ 1)ρ(U)) , (7)\nnoting that φ1(S) ≤ φ(S) for any set S. Uncovered case: We consider each uncovered cluster A ⊆ U separately. With probability φ(A)/φ, the first new center is selected from A, moving A from the uncovered to the covered set and reducing the number of uncovered clusters by one. Applying Lemma 3 for (t, u), the contribution to E[φ′ | φ] is bounded by\nφ(A) φ\n[ cV(t, u) ( φ1(V) + φ1(A) ) + cU (t, u)(ρ(U)− ρ(A)) ] .\nTaking the expectation with respect to possible centers in A and using Lemma 2 and φ1(V) ≤ φ(V), we obtain the further bound\nφ(A) φ [cV(t, u)(φ(V) + ρ(A)) + cU (t, u)(ρ(U)− ρ(A))] .\nSumming over A ⊆ U yields\nφ(U) φ (cV(t, u)φ(V) + cU (t, u)ρ(U)) + cV(t, u)− cU (t, u) φ ∑ A⊆U φ(A)ρ(A)\n≤ φ(U) φ cV(t, u)(φ(V) + ρ(U)), (8)\nusing the inner product bound (18). The result follows from summing (7) and (8) and combining with the trivial bound E[φ′ | φ] ≤ φ = φ(U) + φ(V).\nAs noted above, the bound in Lemma 5 depends on φ(U), the potential over uncovered clusters. This quantity can be arbitrarily large or small. In the next lemma, φ(U) is eliminated by maximizing with respect to it.\nLemma 6. Assume that Lemma 3 holds for (t, u) and (t, u + 1) with cV(t, u + 1) ≥ 1. Then for the case (t+ 1, u+ 1) in the sense of Lemma 5,\nE[φ′ | φ] ≤ 1 2 cV(t, u)(φ(V) + ρ(U)) + 1 2 max\n{ cV(t, u)(φ(V) + ρ(U)), √ Q } ,\nwhere\nQ = ( cV(t, u) 2 − 4cV(t, u) + 4cV(t, u+ 1) ) φ(V)2\n+ 2 ( cV(t, u) 2 − 2cV(t, u) + 2cU (t, u+ 1) ) φ(V)ρ(U) + cV(t, u)2ρ(U)2.\nProof. The result is obtained by maximizing the bound in Lemma 5 with respect to φ(U). Let B1(φ(U)) and B2(φ(U)) denote the two terms in the minimum. The derivative of B1(φ(U)) is given by\nB′1(φ(U)) = φ(V) (φ(U) + φ(V))2 [ (cV(t, u)− cV(t, u+ 1))φ(V) + (cV(t, u)− cU (t, u+ 1))ρ(U) ] ,\nwhich does not change sign as a function of φ(U). The two cases B′1(φ(U)) ≥ 0 and B′1(φ(U)) < 0 are considered separately below. Taking the maximum of the resulting bounds (9), (10) establishes the lemma.\nCase B′1(φ(U)) ≥ 0: Both B1(φ(U)) and B2(φ(U)) are non-decreasing functions of φ(U). The former has the finite supremum\ncV(t, u)(φ(V) + ρ(U)), (9)\nwhereas the latter increases without bound. Therefore B1(φ(U)) eventually becomes the smaller of the two and (9) can be taken as an upper bound on min{B1(φ(U)), B2(φ(U))}.\nCase B′1(φ(U)) < 0: At φ(U) = 0, we have B1(0) = cV(t, u + 1)φ(V) + cU (t, u + 1)ρ(U) and B2(0) = φ(V). The assumption cV(t, u + 1) ≥ 1 implies that B1(0) ≥ B2(0). Since B1(φ(U)) is now a decreasing function, the two functions must intersect and the point of intersection then provides an upper bound on min{B1(φ(U)), B2(φ(U))}.\nSolving for the intersection leads after some algebra to a quadratic equation in φ(U):\n0 = φ(U)2 + [2φ(V)− cV(t, u)(φ(V) + ρ(U))]φ(U) + φ(V) (φ(V)− cV(t, u+ 1)φ(V)− cU (t, u+ 1)ρ(U)) .\nAgain by the assumption cV(t, u + 1) ≥ 1, the constant term in this quadratic equation is non-positive, implying that one of the roots is also non-positive and can be discarded. The remaining positive root is given by\nφ(U) = 1 2 cV(t, u)(φ(V) + ρ(U))− φ(V) + 1 2\n√ Q\nafter simplifying the discriminant to match the stated expression for Q. Evaluating either B1(φ(U)) or B2(φ(U)) at this root gives\n1 2 cV(t, u)(φ(V) + ρ(U)) + 1 2\n√ Q. (10)\nThe bound in Lemma 6 is a function of φ(V) and ρ(U) only but is nonlinear, in contrast to the desired form in Lemma 3. The next step is to linearize the bound by imposing additional conditions (5) on the coefficients.\nLemma 7. Assume that Lemma 3 holds for (t, u) and (t, u+ 1) with coefficients satisfying (5). Then for the case (t+ 1, u+ 1) in the sense of Lemma 5,\nE[φ′ | φ] ≤ 1 2\n[ cV(t, u) + ( cV(t, u) 2 + 4 max{cV(t, u+ 1)− cV(t, u), 0} )1/2] φ(V) + cV(t, u)ρ(U).\nProof. It suffices to linearize the √ Q term in Lemma 6. In particular, we aim to bound the quadratic function Q from above by the square (aφ(V) + bρ(U))2 for all φ(V), ρ(U) and some choice of a, b ≥ 0. The cases φ(V) = 0 and ρ(U) = 0 require that\na2 ≥ cV(t, u)2 + 4(cV(t, u+ 1)− cV(t, u)), b2 ≥ cV(t, u)2.\nSetting these inequalities to equalities, the remaining condition for the cross-term is\nab ≥ cV(t, u)2 + 2(cU (t, u+ 1)− cV(t, u)).\nEquivalently for a, b ≥ 0, a2b2 = ( cV(t, u) 2 + 4(cV(t, u+ 1)− cV(t, u)) ) cV(t, u) 2\n≥ ( cV(t, u) 2 + 2(cU (t, u+ 1)− cV(t, u)) )2 .\nWe rearrange to obtain\n4(cV(t, u+ 1)− cV(t, u))cV(t, u)2\n≥ 4cV(t, u)2(cU (t, u+ 1)− cV(t, u)) + 4(cU (t, u+ 1)− cV(t, u))2,\n(cV(t, u+ 1)− cU (t, u+ 1))cV(t, u)2 ≥ (cU (t, u+ 1)− cV(t, u))2, the last of which is true by assumption (5). Thus we conclude that√\nQ ≤ √ cV(t, u)2 + 4(cV(t, u+ 1)− cV(t, u))φ(V) + cV(t, u)ρ(U).\nCombining this last inequality with Lemma 6 proves the result.\nGiven conditions (5) and Lemma 7, the inductive step for Lemma 3 can be completed by defining cV(t+ 1, u+ 1) and cU (t+ 1, u+ 1) recursively as in (6).\nEquations (5) and (6) provide sufficient conditions on the coefficients cV(t, u) and cU (t, u) to establish Lemma 3 by induction. Section 4.1.3 shows that these conditions are satisfied by (2). To motivate the functional form chosen in (2), we first explore the behavior of solutions that satisfy (6) in particular. This is done by treating (6) as a recursion, taking the inequalities to be equalities, and numerically evaluating cV(t+ 1, u+ 1) and cU (t+ 1, u+ 1) starting from the base cases (3) and (4) as boundary conditions. More specifically, the computation is carried out as an outer loop over increasing u starting from u + 1 = 1, and an inner loop over t starting from t = u+ 1. Figure 1 plots the resulting values for cV(t, u) over the region t ≥ u (cU (t, u) is simply a shifted copy). The most striking feature of Figure 1 is that the level contours appear to be lines t ∝ u emanating from the origin. Sampling values at multiple points (t, u) suggests that cV(t, u) ≈ t/(t − u). The plot also has the properties that cV(t, u) is decreasing in t for fixed u and increasing in u for fixed t. These observations lead to the functional form for cV(t, u) proposed in Section 4.1.3.\nAs for conditions (5), it can be verified directly using the base cases (3) and (4) that they are satisfied for (t, u) = (1, 0). The subsequent numerical values in Figure 1 were found to satisfy (5) for all t > u as well. This suggests that recursion (6) is self-perpetuating in the sense that if (5) are satisfied for (t, u), then the values for cV(t + 1, u + 1), cU (t + 1, u + 1) resulting from (6) will also satisfy (5) for (t + 1, u) and (t+ 1, u+ 1), i.e. points to the right and upper-right. This self-perpetuating property is not proven however in the present paper. Instead, it is shown that the proposed functional form (11) satisfies (5) directly."

(12b)\nEquation (2) is obtained at the end from (11) by optimizing the parameters a and b. Note that with a+1 > 0, (11a) is decreasing in t for fixed u > 0 and increasing in u for fixed t.\nGiven the inductive approach and the results established in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, the proof requires the remaining steps below. First, it is shown that the base cases (3), (4) from Section 4.1.1 imply that Lemma 3 is true for the same base cases but with cV(t, u), cU (t, u) given by (11) instead. Second, (11) is shown to satisfy conditions (5) for all t > u, thus permitting Lemma 7 to be used. Third, (11) is also shown to satisfy (6), which combined with Lemma 7 completes the induction.\nConsidering the base cases, for u = 0, (3) and (11) coincide so there is nothing to prove. For the case t = u, u ≥ 1, Lemma 3 with coefficients given by (4) implies the same with coefficients given by (11) provided that\n(1 +Hu)φ(V) + (1 +Hu−1)ρ(U) ≤ ( 1 + (a+ 1)u\nb\n) φ(V) + ( 1 +\n(a+ 1)(u− 1) b\n) ρ(U)\n∀ φ(V), ρ(U).\nThis in turn is ensured if the coefficients satisfy Hu ≤ (a+ 1)u/b for all u ≥ 1. The most stringent case is u = 1 and is met by assumption (12a).\nFor the second step of establishing (5), it is clear that (5a) is satisfied by (11a). A direct calculation presented in Appendix B shows that (5b) is also true.\nLemma 8. Condition (5b) is satisfied for all t > u if cV(t, u) and cU (t, u) are given by (11) and (12b) holds.\nSimilarly for the third step, it suffices to show that (11a) satisfies recursion (6a) since (11b) automatically satisfies (6b). A proof is provided in Appendix C.\nLemma 9. Recursion (6a) is satisfied for all t > u if cV(t, u) is given by (11a) and (12b) holds.\nHaving shown that Lemma 3 is true for coefficients given by (11) and (12), the specific expressions in (2) are obtained by minimizing cV(t, u) in (11a) with respect to a, b, subject to (12). For fixed a, minimizing with respect to b yields b = a+ 1 in light of (12a), and\ncV(t, u) = 1 + (a+ 1)u\nt− u+ (a+ 1) .\nMinimizing with respect to a then results in a(a + 1) = 1 from (12b). The solution satisfying a > −1 is a = ϕ− 1 and b = ϕ."

The contributions herein extend and improve upon previous results concerning D` sampling [Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007, Aggarwal et al., 2009].\nAs noted in Section 3, the constant r(`)D in Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 represents an opportunity to further improve the approximation bounds. One possibility is to tighten Lemmas 3.2 and 5.1 in Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007], which are the lemmas responsible for the r(`)D factor. A more significant improvement may result from considering not only the covering of optimal clusters by at least one cluster center, but also the effect of selecting more than one center from a single optimal cluster. As the number of selected centers increases, an approximation factor analogous to r(`)D would be expected to decrease. Analysis of algorithms with similar simplicity to D` sampling is also of interest."

In practice, the most widely used algorithm remains Lloyd’s [1957, 1982] (often referred to as the k-means algorithm), which alternates between updating centers given cluster assignments and re-assigning points to clusters. In this paper, we study an enhancement to Lloyd’s algorithm known as k-means++ [Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007] and the more general class of D` sampling algorithms to which k-means++ belongs. These algorithms select cluster centers randomly from the given data points with probabilities proportional to their current costs. The clustering can then be refined using Lloyd’s algorithm. D` sampling is attractive for two reasons: First, it is guaranteed to yield an expected O(log k) approximation to the optimal clustering with k centers [Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007]. Second, it is as simple as Lloyd’s algorithm, both conceptually as well as computationally with O(nkd) running time in d dimensions. The particular focus of this paper is on the setting where an optimal k-clustering remains the benchmark but more than k cluster centers can be sampled to improve the approximation. Specifically, it is shown (see Theorem 1 and Corollary 1) that for any constant factor β > 1, if βk centers are chosen byD` sampling, then a constant-factor approximation to the optimal k-clustering is obtained. This guarantee holds in expectation and for all datasets, like the one in Arthur and Vassilvitskii [2007], and improves upon the O(log k) factor therein.",
