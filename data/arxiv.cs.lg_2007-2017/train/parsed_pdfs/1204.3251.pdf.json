      "text" : "Many machine learning algorithms have been developed to deal with real-life high dimensional data. In order to state and prove properties of such algorithms it is standard to assume that the data satisfy the exchangeability assumption (although some algorithms make different assumptions or, in the case of prediction with expert advice, do not make any statistical assumptions at all). These properties can be violated if the assumption is not satisfied, which makes it important to test the data for satisfying it.\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nNote that the popular assumption that the data is i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) has the same meaning for testing as the exchangeability assumption. A joint distribution of an infinite sequence of examples is exchangeable if it is invariant w.r. to any permutation of examples. Hence if the data is i.i.d., its distribution is exchangeable. On the other hand, by de Finetti’s theorem (see, e.g., Schervish, 1995, p. 28) any exchangeable distribution on the data (a potentially infinite sequence of examples) is a mixture of distributions under which the data is i.i.d. Therefore, testing for exchangeability is equivalent to testing for being i.i.d.\nTraditional statistical approaches to testing are inappropriate for high dimensional data (see, e.g., Vapnik, 1998, pp. 6–7). To address this challenge a previous study (Vovk et al., 2003) suggested a way of on-line testing by employing the theory of conformal prediction and calculating exchangeability martingales. Basically testing proceeds in two steps. The first step is implemented by a conformal predictor that outputs a sequence of p-values. The sequence is generated in the on-line mode: examples are presented one by one and for each new example a p-value is calculated from this and all the previous examples. For the second step the authors introduced exchangeability martingales that are functions of the p-values and track the deviation from the assumption. Once the martingale grows up to a large value (20 and 100 are convenient rules of thumb) the exchangeability assumption can be rejected for the data.\nThis paper proposes a new way of constructing martingales in the second step of testing. To construct an exchangeability martingale based on the sequence of p-values we need a betting function, which determines the contribution of a p-value to the value of the martingale. In contrast to the previous studies that use a fixed betting function the new martingale tunes its betting function to the sequence to detect any deviation from\nar X\niv :1\n20 4.\n32 51\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 8\nJu n\n20 12\nthe assumption. We show that this martingale, which we call a plug-in martingale, is competitive with all the martingales covered by the previous studies; namely, asymptotically the former grows faster than the latter."

      "text" : "The first procedure of testing exchangeability on-line is described in Vovk et al. (2003). The core testing mechanism is an exchangeability martingale. Exchangeability martingales are constructed using a sequence of p-values. The algorithm for generating p-values assigns small p-values to unusual examples. It implies the idea of designing martingales that would have a large value if too many small p-values were generated, and suggests corresponding power martingales. Other martingales (simple mixture and sleepy jumper) implement more complicated strategies, but follow the same idea of scoring on small p-values.\nHo (2005) applies power martingales to the problem of change detection in time-varying data streams. The author shows that small p-values inflate the martingale values and suggests to use the martingale difference as another test for the problem."

      "text" : "As in Vovk et al. (2003), the main tool for testing exchangeability on-line is a martingale. The value of the martingale reflects the strength of evidence against the exchangeability assumption. An exchangeability martingale is a sequence of non-negative random variables S0, S1, . . . that keep the conditional expectation:\nSn ≥ 0 Sn = E(Sn+1 | S1, . . . , Sn),\nwhere E refers to the expected value with respect to any exchangeable distribution on examples. We also assume S0 = 1. Note that we will obtain an equivalent definition if we replace “any exchangeable distribution on examples” by “any distribution under which the examples are i.i.d.” (remember the discussion of de Finetti’s theorem in Section 1).\nTo understand the idea behind martingale testing we can imagine a game where a player starts from the capital of 1, places bets on the outcomes of a sequence of events, and never risks bankruptcy. Then a martingale corresponds to a strategy of the player, and its value reflects the acquired capital. According to Ville’s inequality (see Ville, 1939, p. 100),\nP { ∃n : Sn ≥ C } ≤ 1/C, ∀C ≥ 1,\nit is unlikely for any Sn to have a large value. For the problem of testing exchangeability, if the final value of a martingale is large then the exchangeability assumption for the data can be rejected with the corresponding probability."

In this paper we use conformal predictors to generate a sequence of p-values that corresponds to the given examples. The general idea of conformal prediction is to test how well a new example fits to the previously observed examples. For this purpose a “nonconformity measure” is defined. This is a function that estimates the strangeness of one example with respect to others:\nαi = A ( zi, {z1, . . . , zn} ) ,\nAlgorithm 1 Generating p-values on-line\nInput: (z1, z2, . . .) data for testing Output: (p1, p2, . . .) sequence of p-values for i = 1, 2, . . . do\nobserve a new example zi for j = 1 to i do αj = A ( zj , {z1, . . . , zi} ) end for pi = #{j:αj>αi}+θi#{j:αj=αi} i\nend for\nwhere in general {. . .} stands for a multiset (the same element may be repeated more than once) rather than a set. Typically, each example is assigned a “nonconformity score” αi based on some prediction method. In this paper we deal with the classification problem and the 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) algorithm is used as the underling method to compute the nonconformity scores. The algorithm is simple but it works well enough in many cases (see, e.g., Hastie et al., 2001, pp. 422–427). A natural way to define the nonconformity score of an example is by comparing its distance to the examples with the same label to its distance to the examples with a different label:\nαi = minj 6=i:yi=yj d(xi, xj)\nminj 6=i:yi 6=yj d(xi, xj) , (1)\nwhere d(xi, xj) is the Euclidean distance. According to the chosen nonconformity measure, αi is high if the example is close to another example with a different label and far from any examples with the same label.\nUsing the calculated nonconformity scores of all observed examples, the p-value pn that corresponds to an example zn is calculated as\npn = #{i : αi > αn}+ θn#{i : αi = αn}\nn ,\nwhere θn is a random number from [0, 1] and the symbol # means the cardinality of a set. Algorithm 1 summarises the process of on-line calculation of p-values (it is clear that it can also be applied to a finite dataset (z1, . . . , zn) producing a finite sequence (p1, . . . , pn) of p-values).\nThe following is a standard result in the theory of conformal prediction (see, e.g., Vovk et al. 2003, Theorem 1).\nTheorem 1. If examples (z1, z2, . . .) (resp. (z1, z2, . . . , zn)) satisfy the exchangeability assumption, Algorithm 1 produces p-values (p1, p2, . . .) (resp. (p1, p2, . . . , pn)) that are independent and uniformly distributed in [0, 1].\nThe property that the examples generated by an exchangeable distribution provide uniformly and independently distributed p-values allows us to test exchangeability by calculating martingales as functions of the p-values."

At each step the probability density function is estimated using the accumulated p-values:\nρi(p) = ρ̂(p1, . . . , pi−1, p), (3)\nwhere ρ̂(p1, . . . , pi−1, p) is the estimate of the probability density function using the p-values p1, . . . , pi−1 output by Algorithm 1.\nSubstituting these betting functions into (2) we get a new martingale that we call a plug-in martingale. The martingale avoids betting if the p-values are distributed uniformly, but if there is any peak it will be used for betting.\nEstimating a probability density function. In our experiments we have used the statistical environment and language R. The density function in its\nStats package implements kernel density estimation with different parameters. But since p-values always lie in the unit interval, the standard methods of kernel density estimation lead to poor results for the points that are near the boundary. To get better results for the boundary points the sequence of p-values is reflected to the left from zero and to the right from one. Then the kernel density estimate is calculated using the extended sample ∪ni=1 { −pi, pi, 2 − pi } . The estimated density function is set to zero outside the unit interval and then normalised to integrate to one. For the results presented in this paper the parameters used are the Gaussian kernel and Silverman’s “rule of thumb” for bandwidth selection. Other settings have been tried as well, but the results are comparable and lead to the same conclusions.\nThe values Sn of the plug-in martingale can be updated recursively. Suppose computing the nonconformity scores (α1, . . . , αn) from (z1, . . . , zn) takes time g(n) and evaluating (3) takes time h(n). Then updating Sn−1 to Sn takes time O(g(n) + n+ h(n)): indeed, it is easy to see that calculating the rank of αn in the multiset {α1, . . . , αn} takes time Θ(n).\nThe performance of the plug-in martingale on real-life datasets will be presented in Section 4. The rest of the current section proves that the plug-in martingale provides asymptotically a better growth rate than any martingale with a fixed betting function. To prove this asymptotical property of the plug-in martingale we need the following assumptions."

Then inequality (6) implies that, for all n ≥ N1,∫ 1\n0\nlog ( ρ(p) ) dPn ≥ ∫ 1 0 log ( f(p) ) dPn − 2ε.\nBy the definition of the probability measure Pn, the last inequality is the same thing as\n1\nn n∑ i=1 log ( ρ(pi) ) ≥ 1 n n∑ i=1 log ( f(pi) ) − 2ε.

      "text" : "In this paper we have introduced a new way of constructing martingales for testing exchangeability online. We have shown that for stable sequences of p-values the new more adaptive martingale provides asymptotically the best result compared with any other martingale with a fixed betting function. The experiments of testing two real-life datasets have been presented. Using the same sequence of p-values the plug-in martingale extracts approximately the same amount or more information about the data-generating distribution as compared to the previously introduced power martingales.\nRemark. The previous studies were based on the natural idea that lack of exchangeability leads to new examples looking strange as compared to the old ones and therefore to small p-values (for example, if the datagenerating mechanism changes its regime and starts producing a different kind of examples). This is, however, a situation where lack of exchangeability makes the p-values cluster around 1: we observe examples that are ideal shapes of several kinds distorted by random noise, and the amount of noise decreases with time. Predicting the kind of a new example using the nonconformity measure (1) will then tend to produce large p-values.\nOur goal has been to find an exchangeability martingale that does not need any assumptions about the p-values generated by the method of conformal prediction. Our proposed martingale adapts to the unknown distribution of the p-values by estimating a good bet-\nting function from the past data. This is an example of the plug-in approach. It is generally believed that the Bayesian approach is more efficient than the plug-in approach (see, e.g., Bernardo & Smith, 2000, p. 483). In our present context, the Bayesian approach would involve choosing a prior distribution on the betting functions and integrating the exchangeability martingales corresponding to these betting functions over the prior distribution. It is not clear yet whether this can be done efficiently and, if yes, whether this can improve the performance of exchangeability martingales."

Exchangeability martingales are constructed using a sequence of p-values. The algorithm for generating p-values assigns small p-values to unusual examples. It implies the idea of designing martingales that would have a large value if too many small p-values were generated, and suggests corresponding power martingales. Other martingales (simple mixture and sleepy jumper) implement more complicated strategies, but follow the same idea of scoring on small p-values. Ho (2005) applies power martingales to the problem of change detection in time-varying data streams.",

This paper is devoted to testing the assumption of exchangeability on-line: the examples arrive one by one, and after receiving each example we would like to have a valid measure of the degree to which the assumption of exchangeability has been falsified. Such measures are provided by exchangeability martingales. We extend known techniques for constructing exchangeability martingales and show that our new method is competitive with the martingales introduced before. Finally we investigate the performance of our testing method on two benchmark datasets, USPS and Statlog Satellite data; for the former, the known techniques give satisfactory results, but for the latter our new more flexible method becomes necessary.",
