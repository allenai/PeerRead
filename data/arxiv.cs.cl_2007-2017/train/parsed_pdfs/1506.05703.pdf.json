      "text" : "Recently, there has been a lot of effort to represent words in continuous vector spaces. Those representations have been shown to capture both semantic and syntactic information about words. However, distributed representations of phrases remain a challenge. We introduce a novel model that jointly learns word vector representations and their summation. Word representations are learnt using the word co-occurrence statistical information. To embed sequences of words (i.e. phrases) with different sizes into a common semantic space, we propose to average word vector representations. In contrast with previous methods which reported a posteriori some compositionality aspects by simple summation, we simultaneously train words to sum, while keeping the maximum information from the original vectors. We evaluate the quality of the word representations on several classical word evaluation tasks, and we introduce a novel task to evaluate the quality of the phrase representations. While our distributed representations compete with other methods of learning word representations on word evaluations, we show that they give better performance on the phrase evaluation. Such representations of phrases could be interesting for many tasks in natural language processing.\n1All research was conducted at Idiap Research Institute, before Ronan Collobert joined Facebook AI Research."

      "text" : "Human language “makes infinite use of finite means” (Humboldt, 1836). A large number of sentences can be generated from a finite set of words. Thus there has been a lot of effort to capture the meaning of words. Some approaches are based on distributional word representations (Lund & Burgess, 1996; Patel et al., 1998), others are based on distributed representations (Bengio, 2008; Collobert et al., 2011; Mnih & Kavukcuoglu, 2013; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Lebret & Collobert, 2014; Pennington et al., 2014; Levy & Goldberg, 2014) where the meaning of a word is encoded as a vector computed from co-occurrence statistics of a word and its neighboring words. Finally, distributed representations emerged as the solution to many natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Turney & Pantel, 2010; Collobert et al., 2011).\nGiven these representations of words in a vector space, techniques for combining them have been proposed to get representations of phrases or sentences. These compositional models involve vector addition or multiplication (Mitchell & Lapata, 2010). Such simple compositions have shown to perform competitively on the paraphrase detection and phrase similarity tasks (Blacoe & Lapata, 2012). More sophisticated approaches use techniques from logic, category theory, and quantum information (Clark et al., 2008). Others use the syntactic relations between words to treat certain words as functions and other as arguments such as adjective-noun composition (Baroni & Zamparelli, 2010) or noun-verb composition (Grefenstette et al., 2013). Recursive neural network model for semantic compositionality has also been proposed (Socher et al., 2012), where each word has a matrixvector representation: the vector captures its meaning (as it is initialized with a pre-trained distributed representation), while the matrix learns throught a parse tree how it modifies the meaning of the other word that it combines ar X iv :1\n50 6.\n05 70\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n8 Ju\nwith. Many recent works are based on distributed representations of phrases to tackle a wide range of application in NLP: machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015), constituency parsing (Legrand & Collobert, 2015), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), or image captioning (Lebret et al., 2015). There is therefore a clear need for distributed word representations that can be easily extrapolated to meaningful phrase representations.\nWe argue that distributed representation and composition must go hand in hand, i.e., they must be mutually learned. We present a model that learns to capture meaning of words in distributed representations using a low-rank approximation of a large word co-occurrence matrix. We choose to stochastically perform this low-rank approximation which enables the model to simultaneously train these representations to compose for producing representations of phrases (see Figure 1). As composition function, we choose a simple weighted addition for its simplicity and for enabling sequences of words with different lengths to be representated in a common vector space. Aside from generating distributed representations of words and phrases, this model gives an encoding function (represented by a matrix) which can be used to encode new words or even phrases based on their co-occurrence counts. This offers two different alternatives for phrase representations: (1) representation for a query phrase can be inferred by averaging vector representations of its words (only if they all were in the training set), or (2) by using its word co-occurrence statistics.\nEvaluation on the popular word similarity and analogy tasks demonstrate the capability of our joint model for capturing good distributed representations. We then introduce a novel task for evaluating phrase representations. Given a phrase representation, the objective is to retrieve the words that compose the phrase. We compare our model against other state-of-the-art methods for distributed word representations which capture meaningful linear substructures (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Pennington et al., 2014). We show that our model achieves similar performance on word evaluation tasks, but that it outperforms other methods on the phrase evaluation task."

      "text" : "In the literature, two major model families exist for learning distributed word representations: the count-based methods and the predictive-based methods.\nThe count-based methods consist of using the statistical information contained in large corpora of unlabeled text to build large matrices by simply counting words (word cocoocurrence statistics). The rows correspond to words or terms, and the columns correspond to a local context. The context can be documents, such as in latent semantic anal-\nysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990); or other words (Lund & Burgess, 1996). To generate low-dimensional word representations, a low-rank approximation of these large matrices is performed, mainly with a singular value decomposition (SVD). Many authors proposed to improve this model with different transformations for the matrix of counts, such as positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) (Bullinaria & Levy, 2007; Levy & Goldberg, 2014), or a square root of the co-occurrence probabilities in the form of Hellinger PCA (Lebret & Collobert, 2014). Instead of using the co-occurrence probabilities, (Pennington et al., 2014) suggest that word vector representations should be learnt with ratios of co-occurrence probabilities. For this purpose, they introduce a log-bilinear regression model that combines both global matrix factorization and local context window methods.\nThe predictive-based model has first been introduced as a neural probabilistic language model (Bengio et al., 2003). A neural network architecture is trained to predict the next word given a window of preceding words, where words are representated by low-dimensional vector. Since, some variations of this architecture have been proposed. (Collobert et al., 2011) train a language model to discriminate a two-class classification task: if the word in the middle of the input window is related to its context or not. More recently, the need of full neural architectures has been questioned (Mnih & Kavukcuoglu, 2013; Mikolov et al., 2013a). Mikolov et al. (2013a) propose two predictivebased log-linear models for learning distributed representations of words: (i) the continous bag-of-words model (CBOW), where the objective is to correctly classify the current (middle) word given a symmetric window of context words around it; (ii) the skip-gram model, where instead of predicting the current word based on the context, it tries to maximize classification of a word based on another word in the same sentence. In Mikolov et al. (2013b), the authors also introduce a data-driven approach for learning phrases, where the phrases are treated as individual tokens during the training.\nIn this paper, we leverage both families: (i) we use the statistical information for learning distributed word representations by approximating the Hellinger PCA with an autoencoder network; (ii) we jointly learn to predict the words that compose a given phrase."

Common approaches calculate the frequencies, apply some transformations (tfidf, PPMI), reduce the dimensionality, and calculate the similarities. More recently, Lebret & Collobert (2014) proposed a novel method based on a Hellinger PCA of the word co-occurrence matrix. They showed that word representations can be learnt even with a reasonable number of context words. Inspired by this work, we propose to stochastically perform this low-rank approximation. For this purpose, we use an autoencoder with only linear activations to find an optimal solution related to the Hellinger PCA (Bourlard & Kamp, 1988). Replacing the PCA by an autoencoder allows us to learn jointly a cost function which constrains the word information to be kept by summation."

Considering two discrete probability distributions P = (p1, . . . , pk) and Q = (q1, . . . , qk), the Hellinger distance is formally defined as:\nH(P,Q) = 1√ 2 √√√√ k∑ i=1 ( √ pi − √ qi)2 , (3)\nwhich is directly related to the Euclidean norm of the difference of the square root vectors:\nH(P,Q) = 1√ 2 ‖ √ P −\n√ Q‖2 .

      "heading" : "3.2. Learning to Sum Word Representations",
      "text" : "Interesting compositionality properties have been observed from models based on the addition of representations (Mikolov et al., 2013b). An exhaustive comparison of different composition functions has indeed revealed that an additive model performs well on pre-trained word representations (Mitchell & Lapata, 2010). Because our word representations are learnt from linear operations, the inherent structure of these representations is linear. To combine a sequence of words into a common vector space, we then simply apply an element-wise addition of their vector representations. This approach makes sense and works well when the meaning of a text is literally “the sum of its parts”. This is usually the case with noun and verb phrase chunks. For example, into phrases such as “the red cat” or “struggle to deal”, each word independently has its proper meaning. Distributed representations for such phrase chunks must retain information from the individual words. An objective function is thus defined to learn how to combine the word vector representations, while keeping the maximum information from the original vectors. An operation as simple as a weighted sum will probably fail for sequences where individual words act as operators that modify the meaning of another word, or for multiword expressions. Other more complex functions could be chosen to also include such cases, but we choose to propose a much simpler model (i.e.,\naveraging the word representations) to get phrase chunk representations with unsupervised learning. In this paper, we therefore focus on noun and verb phrase chunks."

An objective function is thus defined to encourage words wt which appear in the chunk s to give high scores when calculating the dot product between xwt and xs. On the other hand, these scores must be low for words wi /∈ s that do not appear in the chunk. We train this problem with a rankingtype cost:∑\ns∈S ∑ wt∈s ∑ wi∈W wi 6∈s max(0, 1− xs · xwt + xs · xwi) .

Our model significantly outperforms others methods on this task. In Figure 2, a more detailed analysis of results reveals that the GloVe model competes with ours for the 2-word phrases. However GloVe’s representations cannot maintain this performance for longer phrases. It is probably not too surprising as this model is trained using ratios of co-occurrence probabilities for two\ntarget words.

Consider that the dictionary Wn tends to grow exponentially with n, it gives a nice framework to produce the huge variety of possible sequence of n words in a timely and efficient manner with low memory consumption, unlike other methods. Relying on word co-occurrence statistics to represent words in vector space also provides a framework to easily generate representations for unseen words. This is another advantage compared to methods focused on learning distributed word representations (such as CBOW, Skip-gram and GloVe models), where the whole system needs to be trained again to learn representations for these new con-\nstituents. To infer a representation for a new word wnew, one only needs to count its context words over a large corpus of text to build the distribution √ Pwnew . This nice feature can be extrapolated to phrases, which gives another alternative for generating phrase representations. Table 3 presents some examples of phrases, where we use both alternatives to compute their distributed representations. It can be seen that both alternatives give distinct representations. For instance, by using the encoding function f , our model infers a representation for the entity Chicago Bulls which is close to other NBA teams, like the Denver Nuggets or the Seattle Supersonics. By averaging the representations of both words Chicago and Bulls, our model infers a representation which is close to other Chicago’s sport teams. Both representations are meaningful, but they carry different information. Relying on co-occurrence statistics gives entities that occur in a similar context, while the summation tries to find entities containing the maximum amount of similar information. This also works with longer phrases, such as President of the United States. The first alternative gives men who served as president, when the second gives related positions."

Using a chunking approach, a collection of noun phrases and verb phrases is extracted from Wikipedia. For a given n-word phrase, we train our model to generate a low-dimensional representation for each word based on its co-occurrence probability distribution. These n representations are averaged together to generate a distributed phrase representation in the same semantic space. Thanks to an autoencoder approach, we can simultaneously train the model to retrieve the original n words from the phrase representation, and therefore learn complex linear substructures. When compared to state-of-the-art methods on some classical word evaluation tasks, the competitive results show that our joint model produces meaningful word representations. Performance on a novel task for evaluating phrase representations confirm the ability of our model to learn complex substructures, which make possible the aggregation of multiple words within a low-dimensional vector space. Better still, inference of new phrase representations is also easily feasible when relying on counts. Some quantitative examples demonstrate that both alternatives can give different but meaningful information about phrases.

Those representations have been shown to capture both semantic and syntactic information about words. However, distributed representations of phrases remain a challenge. We introduce a novel model that jointly learns word vector representations and their summation. Word representations are learnt using the word co-occurrence statistical information. To embed sequences of words (i.e. phrases) with different sizes into a common semantic space, we propose to average word vector representations. In contrast with previous methods which reported a posteriori some compositionality aspects by simple summation, we simultaneously train words to sum, while keeping the maximum information from the original vectors. We evaluate the quality of the word representations on several classical word evaluation tasks, and we introduce a novel task to evaluate the quality of the phrase representations. While our distributed representations compete with other methods of learning word representations on word evaluations, we show that they give better performance on the phrase evaluation. Such representations of phrases could be interesting for many tasks in natural language processing.
