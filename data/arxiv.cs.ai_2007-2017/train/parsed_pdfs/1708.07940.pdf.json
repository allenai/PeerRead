      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "e explosive growth of the World Wide Web generates tremendous amount of web data and consequently web data mining has become an important technique for discovering useful information and knowledge. Among many popular topics in web data mining, extracting information architecture or content structures for a web site has a racted many research a ention in recent years. Existing works mainly extract navigation menus from webpages to reveal the content structure of the site [11]. Many applications can be derived from the extracted content structure, including generating site map to improve information accessibility for disabled users, or providing content hierarchy in search results [10] etc.\nHowever, the increasing number of web 2.0 sites such as social networks, e-commerce portals etc. are turning the web from a static information repository into a dynamic platform for information sharing and interactions. As shown in Figure 1, the information architecture on these sites are characterized not only by the traditional static directory structure of the site, but also by the dynamic elements such as the top reading list, recommended items etc. In fact, the dynamic nature of web 2.0 sites are be er captured by these dynamic and personalized elements. But their importance are neglected in existing works of web structure extraction, which mainly focus on extracting static web site structures such as the navigation menus[11], headings[17] etc.\nIn this paper, we propose a new extraction method for navigation objects in a webpage to capture both the static directory structures and the dynamic content structures in a web site. It is a non-trivial task mainly because of the great diversities in webpage structures. Webpages come with various layouts, thus navigation objects in di erent webpages varies greatly in their presentation. Moreover,\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n07 94\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 6\nmany navigation elements in a webpage nowadays are generated dynamically, or customized for speci c users.\nTo overcome these di culties, we a empt to develop a pagedependent extractor for navigation objects in a webpage. Our method is based on following observations for navigation objects, in a typical webpage: 1) the navigation objects are naturally grouped in di erent hyperlink blocks, in which few other contents other than these hyperlinks exist; 2) the anchor text for these hyperlinks are usually short and well aligned. With these observations, the rst step of our method is to cluster hyperlinks in a webpage into multiple blocks by exploiting features such as spatial locations of hyperlinks, the hierarchical structure of the DOM-tree and the hyperlink density etc.\nen we identify navigation objects using the SVM classi er. Generally, the hyperlink blocks in a webpage can be divided into the following four categories:\n• Navigation Menu. Hyperlinks provide site-level navigation. ey stay relatively invariant and can be directly mapped to the static directory structure in a website. • Navigation List. Hyperlinks provide page-dependent navigation and capture the dynamic and personalized content structures, such as recommended list etc. • Content Hyperlink. Hyperlinks appears in the main content. • Others. Hyperlinks include Ads, copyright information etc.\nObviously, we intend to extract Navigation Menu and Navigation List in a webpage. e SVM classi er is trained with some well de ned features, such as the number of hyperlinks, the mean and the variance of anchor text lengths etc. Experimental results in multiple real-world datasets verify the e ectiveness of our method.\ne rest of the paper is organized as follows. We brie y review related works in section 2. We describe our method in section 3 and 4, the part of clustering hyperlinks into blocks is in section 3 and the part of classifying hyperlink blocks is in section 4. en in section 5 we show our experimental setup and results followed by discussing the results. Finally, we present our conclusions and plans to future research in section 6."

      "heading" : "2 RELATEDWORK",
      "text" : "Our work is related to areas of web structure mining and web information extraction.\nWeb structure mining. Web structure mining aims to study the hyperlink structure of the web. Some early works studied the structure of the web at large [4][12] and uncover the major connected components of the web. Others analyzed the generally\nproperties related with the web graph, such as its diameter [1], size and accessibility of information on the web [14] etc. PageRank [18] exploits the linkage information to learn the importance of webpages and becomes widely used in modern search engines.\nRecent works on web structure mining focused more on the local structures of the web graph. Ravi et al. [13] used the hierarchical structure of URLs to generate hierarchical web site segmentation. ough the hierarchical structure of URLs was also used in many other works, such as [31], the hierarchical structure of URLs does not re ect the web site organization accurately. Eduarda Mendes et al. [23] noticed that and thought navigation objects could re ect the web site structure be er. ey applied frequent item-set algorithms on the outgoing hyperlinks of webpages to detect repeated navigation menus and then used them to represent web sites. Keller et al. [11] also tried to use navigation menus to reveal the information architecture of web sites, but they extracted navigation menus in a very di erent way. ey extracted navigation menus by analyzing maximal cliques on the web graph. Some works do not extract navigation objects directly, but they take into account the structural information navigation objects provide. For instance, when Cindy Xide et al. [15] clustered webpages, they considered parallel links which are siblings in the DOM-tree of a webpage and usually in the same navigation objects. However, these works only focus on the static structure of a web site represented by navigation menus etc. and neglect the dynamic structure represented by personalized page-speci c navigation lists. ese navigation elements is vital to understand the dynamic nature of web 2.0 sites.\nWeb information extraction. Information extraction from webpages has many applications. Most of the existing works focus on main content extraction from webpages and the early work about that can be traced back to Rahman et al. [21]. ey segment the webpages into zones based on its HTML structure and extract important contents by analyzing zone a ributes.\nAmong many di erent categories of extraction methods, templatebased ones are popular because they are highly accurate and easy to implement. ey extracted content from pages with a common template by looking for special HTML cues using regular expressions. A di erent category of template-based methods used template detection algorithms [2][16][32][7], in which webpages with the same template are collected and used to learn common structures. e major problem with template-based extractors is that di erent extractors must be developed for di erent templates. What’s more, once the template updates, as frequently happens in many web site, the extractor will be invalidated.\nTo overcome the limitations of template-based methods, many researchers a empted to extract content from webpages in a templateindependent way. Cai et al. [5] proposed a vision-based webpage segmentation algorithm named VIPS to divide a webpage into several blocks by its visual presentation. Zheng et al. [33] presented a template-independent news extraction method based on visual consistency. Wang et al. [28] exploited more features about the relation between the news title and body by rstly extracting the title block and then extracting the body block. Shanchan et al. [30] trained a machine learning model with multiple features generated by utilizing DOM-tree node properties and extracted content using this model. Although these methods extract webpage content in\na template-independent way, they still have to rely on some particular HTML cues (e.g., < table >, < td >, color and font etc) in their extraction, and thus are more easily a ected by the underlying web development technologies. Two recent works, CETR [29] and CETD [25] address this issue by identifying regions with high text density, i.e., regions including many words and few tags are more likely to be main content.\nAs can be seen, most existing works of information extraction from webpages focus on main content extraction and they can not be applied to extracting navigation objects directly. Even the template-based methods cannot be used directly to extract navigation objects because navigation lists in webpages are usually generated dynamically and page-dependent."

      "text" : "Before clustering hyperlinks in a webpage into blocks, we parse the webpage into a DOM-tree. Each webpage corresponds to a DOM-tree where detailed text, images and hyperlinks etc. are leaf nodes. An example of the DOM-tree is shown in Figure 3. e DOM-tree at the bo om of Figure 3 is derived from the HTML code at the top right, whose webpage layout is at the top le .\ne DOM-tree is a hierarchical structure and it has three useful properties as follows. First, the relation between child node and parent node re ects their relation in the webpage layout, e.g., in Figure 3 the node < p > and < imд > are child nodes of node < div > re ects that text and image are included in the block corresponding to < div > in the webpage layout. Second, the relative positions of sibling nodes are preserved when they are displaying in the webpage. More speci cally, if node a and node b 1h p://www.techweb.com\nare sibling nodes and a is at the le side of b on the DOM-tree, the displaying element corresponding to a must stay at the le side or the top of the displaying element corresponding tob in the webpage layout. ird, hyperlinks in the same block must have the same ancestor, which is the root node of the smallest sub-tree including that block. e above three properties are very useful when we cluster hyperlinks into blocks on the DOM-tree of a webpage."

      "heading" : "3.2 DOM-tree Distance",
      "text" : "e central problem in clustering hyperlinks is to de ne a reasonable distance between them that well conforms to their visual presentation. e most intuitive choice is the Euclid distance between their locations on the webpage as rendered by browsers. However, obtaining these locations requires expensive computation cost. Moreover, locations for many hyperlinks can not be obtained without user interactions, e.g., in multilevel menus, the displaying locations of hyperlinks in the second or third level menus are only available a er clicking their parent menus.\nTo address this issue, we analyze the structure of the HTML code and use the DOM-tree distance to approximate the distance between two hyperlinks. We rst traverse the DOM-tree of a given webpage with depth- rst search order and index each node we encounter, starting from 1. en we calculate the DOM-tree Distance (DD) between hyperlinks l1 and l2 as follow:\nDD(l1, l2) = |index(l1) − index(l2)|, (1)\nwhere index(li ) means the index of hyperlink li . For two given\nhyperlink blocks B1 and B2, we de ne the gap between them as the minimum distance between hyperlinks in B1 and B2:\ngap(B1,B2) = min i, j DD(li , lj ), (2)\nwhere li ∈ B1, lj ∈ B2. We can use the internal node to represent a hyperlink block, which includes all hyperlink nodes in the corresponding sub-tree. In Figure 4, the node indexed with 2 can represent the hyperlink block including hyperlinks indexed with 6, 8 and the node indexed with 11 can represent the hyperlink block including hyperlink indexed with 12. e gap between these two hyperlink blocks is min{4, 6} = 4."

We only try to merge hyperlink blocks which have the same parent because hyperlinks in the same block should have the same ancestor. We only try to merge hyperlink blocks which are neighbors because the relative positions of sibling nodes are preserved when displaying in the webpage layout.\ne whole process executes from bo om to top on the whole DOM-tree and from le to right on each level of the DOM-tree.

Firstly, each hyperlink is a hyperlink block which only contains one hyperlink, so Sh ⊂ Sb . Secondly, as de ned in equation (4), the gap between two hyperlink blocks is the minimum distance between hyperlinks in those two hyperlink blocks, which must be the distance between two neighbor hyperlinks, so Sb ⊂ Sh . Above all, Sb = Sh is proved.\nLet DL denote Sh with an additional 0, the problem of calculating дt becomes choosing a proper value from DL:\n(1) e дt should not be too large to avoid clustering all hyperlinks into very few big blocks;\n(2) e дt should not be too small to avoid clustering all hyperlinks into too many small blocks.\nWe choose the following i-th value in DL as дt a er sorting DL in decreasing order:\nargi min ( DLi DL1 + β i length(DL) ) (4)\nwhere the DL1 is the maximum value in DL, the length(DL) is the number of values in DL, 1 ≤ i ≤ length(DL). ey are used to normalize the value of distance and the number of potential blocks. β is a tradeo parameter and we set β = 1 in all our experiments.\n3.5.2 Hyperlink density threshold. A hyperlink block includes few text except the text in hyperlinks. Intuitively, since the node with < body > tag is the root node of the DOM-tree and it contains no less other text than each hyperlink block. Let HDB denote the Hyperlink Density of the whole webpage, then\nhdt = γHDB (5)\nperform the lower bound of Hyperlink Density of hyperlink blocks. γ ≥ 0 is a tuning parameter and we set γ = 1 in our experiments."

For a given hyperlink block Bi , we denote the number of hyperlinks in it as #Bi .\n4.1.2 Text length in hyperlinks. e length of anchor text is also very useful. On one hand, anchor texts in a navigation object are usually short, while hyperlinks in main content usually have relatively longer texts and hyperlinks in Ads etc. usually contain images without any text. So the mean of text length in a navigation object is usually small but not zero. On the other hand, the text in a navigation object is usually neat and the variance of these text lengths is small. For a given hyperlink block Bi , we denote the mean and variance of the text length in its hyperlinks as Btmi and B tv i respectively. We apply the re-implemented Gaussian smoothing [29] to the text lengths of hyperlinks in a DOM-tree to avoid sudden changes in the text lengths.\nAbove all, for a given hyperlink block Bi , the feature vector of Bi is [#Bi ,Btmi ,B tv i ]. en the SVM classi er with RBF kernel is applied to classify Bi as navigation object or non-navigation object."

A er parsing the HTML le of a webpage into a DOM-tree, we treated all elements with the tag < a > as hyperlinks, including some bu ons and drop-down lists. We kept everything in a webpage without any preprocess, in order to show that our method can handle most noise in the webpage.\n5.3.1 Clustering hyperlinks. In order to properly evaluate the performance of our method on clustering hyperlinks, we compared our method’s performance with several common clustering algorithms, including Agglomeration, DBSCAN, K-Means and Spectral Clustering [24]. All algorithms use equation (1) to measure the distance between two hyperlinks. e Agglomeration initializes every hyperlink to a singleton cluster at the beginning. At each of the N − 1 steps, the two closest clusters are merged into one singleton cluster. We implement this algorithm by ourselves and use single-linkage to measure the intergroup dissimilarity and use дt as the threshold to jump out of its iteration. e DBSCAN algorithm regards clusters as areas with high density separated by areas with low density. We use the implementation in scikit-learn by setting eps = дt ,min samples = 1, where eps means the maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered as in the same neighborhood and min samples is the minimum number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as a core point. e K-Means algorithm clusters data by trying to split samples into K groups. We use the implementation in scikit-learn by se ing parameter K with the number of blocks in the ground truth. For Spectral Clustering ,we use the implementation in scikit-learn by se ing parameter K with the number of blocks in the ground truth and use the one nearest neighbor method to construct the a nity matrix for Spectral Clustering.\nere are two versions of our method.

We classify each hyperlink block as navigation object or non-navigation object by using SVM with RBF kernel implemented in scikit-learn. e parameters in this SVM classi er are set as C = 1.0andγ = 0.1, where C is the penalty parameter of the error term and γ is the kernel coe cient for RBF."

Table 1 and Table 2 present the hyperlink clustering performance of di erent algorithms on the CleanEval, Myriad 40 and Big 5 data sets in the ARI metric and AMI metric respectively. e Big 5 has been broken down into it’s individual sources.\nComparing the average ARI values and AMI values over all data sets, our methods (including both CHD and CHD-HD) outperform all comparison methods. Actually, our methods have a be er performance than most comparison methods when comparing ARI values and AMI values on individual data set. Moreover, our method is more reliable than the comparison methods since our method has a stable performances while comparison methods may collapse on some particular data sets. It is because that our method makes good use of the hierarchical structure of the DOM-tree as well as the distance information on DOM-tree. Finally, CHD-HD always performs be er than CHD, especially on the dataset CleanEval, which has the greatest diversity and most dynamic and page-dependent navigation elements. at means besides the hierarchical structure of the DOM-tree, Hyperlink Density is also very helpful.\nBesides our method, the Agglomeration has the best performance, except the collapse of performance on Suntimes data set. Although it makes no use of any information from the hierarchical structure, it uses the fact that hyperlinks in a block are gathering together. e DBSCAN also uses this fact, so its performances are quite similar with the performance of Agglomeration. For instance, on the Myriad 40 and four sources in Big 5, the performance of DBSCAN is the same as Agglomeration. For K-Means and Spectral clustering, the performance is very poor, even though they have “cheatet” by using K obtained from the ground truth. Actually, nding the best K is very di cult. e average cumulative percentage of webpages for which the clustering performance of a particular method is less than a certain ARI value is plo ed in Figure 5. e corresponding gure for AMI is in Figure 6. e slower the curve goes up from le to right, the be er performance the corresponding method has. ese two gures provide a more obvious illustration than Table 1 and Table 2, in terms of the be er performance that our method achieved on each ARI and AMI value relative to comparison methods. e majority of webpages that our method processed have a larger AMI or ARI value. Taking Figure 5 as an example, for Agglomeration, DBSCAN, K-Means and Spectral clustering, the average percentages of ARI value lower than 0.6 are about 26%, 27%, 84% and 89%. At the same time, for CHD and CHD-HD, such percentage are only 13% and 10% respectively.\n5.4.2 Classifying hyperlink blocks. Table 3 and Table 4 present the results of classifying hyperlink blocks.

However, web 2.0 sites such as social networks, e-commerce portals etc. are making the understanding of the content structure in a web site increasingly dicult. Dynamic and personalized elements such as top stories, recommended list in a webpage are vital to the understanding of the dynamic nature of web 2.0 sites. To beer understand the content structure in web 2.0 sites, in this paper we propose a new extraction method for navigation objects in a webpage. Our method will extract not only the static navigation menus, but also the dynamic and personalized page-specic navigation lists. Since the navigation objects in a webpage naturally come in blocks, we rst cluster hyperlinks into dierent blocks by exploiting spatial locations of hyperlinks, the hierarchical structure of the DOM-tree and the hyperlink density. en we identify navigation objects from those blocks using the SVM classier with novel features such as anchor text lengths etc. Experiments on real-world data sets with webpages from various domains and styles veried the eectiveness of our method.",
