      "text" : "In this work, a computational intelligence (CI) technique named flexible neural tree (FNT) was developed to predict die filling performance of pharmaceutical granules and to identify significant die filling process variables. FNT resembles feedforward neural network, which creates a tree-like structure by using genetic programming. To improve accuracy, FNT parameters were optimized by using differential evolution algorithm. The performance of the FNT-based CI model was evaluated and compared with other CI techniques: multilayer perceptron, Gaussian process regression, and reduced error pruning tree. The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using die filling as a case study. The die filling experiments were performed using a model shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG). The feed powders were roll-compacted and milled into granules. The granules were then sieved into samples of various size classes. The mass of granules deposited into the die at different shoe speeds was measured. From these experiments, a dataset consisting true density, mean diameter (d50), granule size, and shoe speed as the inputs and the deposited mass as the output was generated. Cross-validation (CV) methods such as 10FCV and 5x2FCV were applied to develop and to validate the predictive models. It was found that the FNT based CI model (in the cases of both CV methods) performed much better than other CI models.

      "text" : "In pharmaceutical industries, it is well recognized that the variation in composition and the quality of tablets are determined by material properties and process conditions. One of the greatest challenges in pharmaceutical development is to identify the causal relationship between material properties, intermediate properties, final product properties, and process variables, which is crucial to obtain high-quality products. However, it is a challenging multifactorial problem.\nTablets are manufactured by compressing dry powders or granules in a die, i.e., the socalled die compaction. The die compaction process consists of three primary stages: die filling, compaction, and ejection [1]. Simple gravity effect can play a role during die filling of powders into the die. However, flow behavior during die filling process controls the tablet composition, the tablet properties as well as its segregation tendency [2–4]. Therefore, the study of die filling process parameters has a significant role in controlling tablet (drug) manufacturing industry.\nPrevious studies on die filling have been focused on such factors influencing the flow behavior as powder characteristics, apparatus features, and operating variables. For instance, the effect of density and particle size on gravity and suction filling of several grades of microcrystalline cellulose powders were explored in [5]. It was shown that fine particles present intermittent flow behavior due to their cohesive property, while larger particles are free flowing. The suction effect during die filling on a rotary press system was studied in [6], where the strong influence on the flow behavior of powders was observed due to air pressure build-up into an open cavity. Moreover, it was found that the lower punch has to be withdrawn at a higher speed by increasing the turret speed in order to improve the suction feed efficiency.\nIn [7], authors studied powder segregation behavior during die filling process for a mixture of fine and coarse powders from a stationary hopper. Segregation was found due to the movement of the fine particles on the powder bed during the process. Moreover, the reduction of segregation was possible with the decrease of fill time or enhancing the drop height.\nSeveral studies reported in the literature are on apparatus features such as die width and feed frame design. For example, a study on die width proved that the filling density decreases proportionally with the die width [8]. In another study, the filling density was found correlated with the shoe speed, i.e., the filling density was observed to be increasing as the shoe speed was decreasing [9]. Additionally, in [10], authors studied the influence of different feed frames\nof powder blends and found that the feed frame had a significantly high impact on powder hydrophobicity due to over lubrication of the powders caused by the shear. This will lead to an increase of flowability and a decrease in tablet tensile strength.\nSimilarly, different process conditions such as die filling in the air or in the vacuum, were studied [2], where it was shown that nose flow and bulk flow are two possible classifications of die filling depending on the shoe speed, the powder flow patterns. Moreover, a faster filling rate was observed in the vacuum than the filling rate in the air. Furthermore, in [11], authors proposed a new methodology based on the concept of critical shoe velocity to characterize powder flow, where a critical fill speed that suggests the minimum filling speed at which the die can be filled, completely. The die will not be full if the velocity is higher than the critical velocity. Hence, it was possible to determine the fill ratio at these higher speeds using the following equation:\nδ = ( vc vs )m (1)\nwhere vc is the critical velocity, vs is the shoe speed, and m is a coefficient of value between 1.0 and 1.6.\nGuo et al. [12] used a coupled discrete element method with computational fluid dynamics (DEM-CFD) to modeled die filling process, in which they explored the influence of powder properties (i.e., particle size and density) on die filling in the air and in the vacuum. They characterized flow in terms of mass flow rate and found that the mass flow rate is constant in the vacuum; whereas for light and small particles in the air-sensitive regime, it was found that the mass flow rate increases as the particle size and density increase, and for coarse and dense particles in the air-inert regime, a negligible effect on airflow was observed. Guo et al. [13] then investigated segregation induced by air during die filling, where DEM-CFD was used to simulate monodispersed mixtures. For die filling using a stationary shoe, segregation was induced due to the air presence and a lower concentration of light particles was found in the lower region of the die. Whereas, for die filling using a moving shoe, lighter particles predominantly gather in the leading edge of the flow stream.\nAlthough several investigations on die filling have been proposed both experimentally and numerically, the influence of the granule property on die filling behavior and how this is correlated with the raw material properties and process variables are not fully understood. Moreover, it is of commercial benefit for pharmaceutical companies to reduce the development time and costs with the contemporary improvement of the pharmaceutical process design [14]. To achieve these goals, the use of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) on a limited set of experiment data for predictive modeling can be of great benefit [15]. Additionally, use of computational intelligence techniques is advantageous for various pharmaceutical processes [16, 17]. Hence, the objective of this work is to develop a predictive model that can accurately describe the die filling behavior of pharmaceutical granules. For this purpose, a computational intelligent (CI)\ntechnique, named flexible neural tree (FNT), is used for predicting die filling performance of pharmaceutical granules"

      "text" : "Computational intelligence techniques discover knowledge from data and create predictive models. Moreover, in a predictive modeling, a causal relationship between the independent variable X = (x1,x2, . . . ,xN) and the dependent variable d = 〈d1, d2, . . . , dN〉 is discovered. Specifically, the unknown parameter w, which represents the learning component of a CI technique, are determined by minimizing the root mean square error e (RMSE) between the desired output d and the predicted output y = 〈y1, y2, . . . , yN〉. Hence, the training of a CI technique is a process of searching the optimum parameter w. In this work, the RMSE e was computed as:\ne = √√√√ 1 N N∑\ni=1\n(yi − di)2, (2)\nwhere N is total samples in a training set. An additional performance measure used in this work was correlation coefficient r that quantifies the correlation between two the variables: the desired output d and the predicted output y. The correlation coefficient value r was computed as:\nr = ∑N i=1((yi −mean(y))(di −mean(d)))∑N\ni=1(yi −mean(y))2 ∑N i=1(di −mean(d))2 (3)\nwhere function mean(·) returns the average of the elements of a vector. The correlation coefficient r equal to 1 indicate the best performance and the correlation coefficient r equal to -1 indicates the worst performance.\nThe common CI techniques such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and reduced error pruning tree (REP-Tree) solves several industrial and real-world problems [18]. The concise definitions of these CI techniques are as follows:\n• The MLP is a mathematical form of human-like learning, where a network of computational nodes arranged in a layered architecture is trained using a dataset [19].\n• In REP-Tree, based on the dataset, a tree-like structure is created, where the tree’s internal nodes are binary decision nodes and the leaf nodes are the output nodes [20].\n• The GPR is a Gaussian distribution based extension of linear regression technique [21].\nThese CI techniques are implemented as an open source library, i.e., as a software tool named WEKA [22]. A detailed description of these models is available in [23].\nIn comparison to the models above, the flexible neural tree (FNT) produces a tree-like model, where the nodes of the tree are similar to the MLP nodes. Hence, FNT differs from MLP in its\nstructural configuration, and it differs from REP-Tree in its node type. Moreover, the tree-like structure in the FNT is created using genetic programming (GP) [24,25]. Therefore, the basic advantage of using FNT over MLP and REP-Tree lies in its ability of automatic adaptation into the tree-structure and the input feature selection with the help of GP [26]. Such an ability is necessary and has been used in several successful applications. Examples of such applications are cement decomposing-furnace production-process modeling [27]; exchange rate forecasting [28]; gene regulatory network reconstruction and time-series prediction from gene expression [29]; Internet traffic identification [30]; and protein desolation rate prediction [31].\nIt is known that for a good quality data, the predictive capability of MLP lies in its learning components, such as connection weights, network-architecture, activation-function, input features, and learning rules [32]. The design of FNT includes all these MLP-like learning components and offer an automatic adaptation of these components by using GP [24, 25]. The descriptions of the CI models are given below."

      "text" : "To minimize RMSE e so that it converges to zero, an FNT adapts its parameter by using learning algorithms (such as genetic programming and differential evolution). Such adaptation is performed by optimizing the components of tree-like structure: internal-nodes (computational nodes), branches (connection-weights), and leaf nodes (terminal nodes).\nMathematically, a union of computational node F and the terminal node T describes an FNT denoted as S, where a computational node represents an activation function, and a terminal node represents an input. Hence, an FNT can be represented as:\nS = F ∪ T = {+2,+3, · · · ,+N} ∪ {x1, x2, . . . , xd} (4)\nwhere +n (n = 2 or 3 or . . . or N) indicates that a computational node that takes two or more arguments; whereas, the terminal node takes zero arguments. Fig. 1 is an illustration of FNT model.\nThe shaded circle in Fig. 1 represents a computational node (the root node is among the computational nodes), the branches of the tree indicate the weights of the model, and the leaf nodes (shown in square) of the tree indicates the selected input features. The root node of\nthe tree represents the output of the model.The output of an FNT at the root node is computed using a bottom-up approach (as indicated by arrows in Fig. 1). The i-th computational node (shown in Fig. 2) of the tree (Fig. 1) receives ni input through ni connection-weights (branches) and two adjustable parameters ai and bi, which represent the arguments of the ith computational node’s activation function. The purpose of using an activation function at the computational node is to limit computational node’s output within a certain range. For example, output of i-th node that contains a Gaussian function is computed as:\nyi = fi(ai, bi, oi) = exp\n( − (\n(oi − ai) bi\n)) (5)\nwhere oi is the weighted summation of the inputs to the i-th computational node (see Fig. 1), which is computed as:\noi = ni∑\nj=1\nwijx i j (6)\nwhere zij ∈ {x1, x2, . . . , xd} or zij ∈ {y1, y2, . . . , yk}, i.e., zij can be either an input feature (leaf node value) or the output of another node (computational node value). The weight wij is the connection weight of real value in the range [wl, wh]. Now, two aspects are involved in the training of an FNT: tree structure optimization and parameter optimization. The optimization of these two aspects of FNT took place in two phases:\n1) Structure optimization using genetic programming (GP)\n2) Parameter optimization with differential evolution (DE)."

At each iteration, the selection operator selects three random vectors from the population H: r1, r2, and r3 such that r1 6= r2 6= r3 and the vector g that denotes the best solution in the population. Therefore, a new tree parameter vector hnew is computed as:\nhnew    r1 + F · (r1 − g) + F · (r2 − r3), if u < C\nr1, if u ≥ C (7)\nwhere u, is a vector of random values taken from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, C is a vector of crossover probability, and F is a vector of mutation factor.

However, during cross-validation (CV) methods such as k-fold CV, the structure is determined only once (for only first fold) and for the rest of the (k − 1) folds only parameters were optimized.

The mean diameter (d50) defined as the size value below which 50% of the particles lies, was then determined. Die filling experiments were performed using a model die filling system that consists of a shoe driven by a pneumatic driving unit, a positioning controller, and a displacement transducer [2]. For each granule size class, experiments were performed using seven different shoe speeds in the range of 10 mm s−1 to 400 mm s−1. For each die filling experiment, the powder mass deposited into the die was weighted, and the value was recorded. Each experiment was repeated three times. In total, 389 experiments (3 powders, 6 granule sizes, 7 speeds, 3 repeats) were performed, and 389 datasets were generated.\nFrom the collected experimental data, four parameters were chosen as inputs for the modeling: true density and mean diameter (d50) of raw powders, granule size ( µm), and shoe speed ( mm s−1) and the deposited mass was the only output.

Two different cases, i.e., 10-fold cross validation (10FCV) and 5-cross-2-fold cross validation (5x2FCV) methods, were considered. In 10FCV, a dataset is first randomized (shuffled). Then, 90% of data samples are used for training of a model and the rest of 10% data samples are used for testing. This process is repeated for 10 times and each time a distinct set of 10% dataset is picked for testing of the model. Hence, called 10FCV. In the 5x2FCV, the data set is randomly divided into two sets, where each set is 50% in size of the entire dataset. When the first set is used for the training of a model, then the second set is used for the testing of the same model, and the vice-versa. This process is repeated for five times hence referred to as 5x2FCV validation.

The feature selection rate is defined as:\nRj = 1\nM\nM∑\ni=1\nI(Aj) (8)\nwhere Rj is the selection rate of j-th input feature set Aj ∈ A which is a power set P{true density, d50, granule size, shoe speed}, M is the total number of models in the list, and function I(Aj) is an identity function that returned “1” if j-th input feature set Aj is selected by the i-th model, otherwise, returned “0.” Feature selection rate R equal to one is the highest (100% selection rate), and R equal to zero is the lowest (0% selection rate).

From our 5x2FCV results, it was found that the model Nos. 7 and 8 were simple in comparison to model Nos. 1, 2, and 3, but their accuracies (correlation coefficient) were slightly poorer in comparison. However, the model Nos. 7 and 8 were tested over 50% test samples. Hence, it describes that the deposited mass can be efficiently predicted by using die filling process variables knowledge. Moreover, choice of model is subjective. Since simple models possess higher generalization ability, the competitive accuracies of the model Nos. 7 and 8 to the model Nos. 1, 2, and 3 tells that one had to choose between the accuracies and the generalization ability of the models. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 present the graphical visualization of the 10FCV and 5x2FCV models, respectively, where, the test performance of the models over each test samples were examined. The 5x2FCV models produced similar trend when the models were tested over 50% of samples. However, the 5x2FCV models (see Fig. 6(d)) did not predict the outlier as close as 10FCV models (see Fig. 5(d)) predicted it."

Since the evolutionary process was used during model creation, the created models selected the input features set that had the highest predictability. Therefore, the RMSEs and selected input feature set by the models were placed into a list. Subsequently, a comprehensive feature analysis was performed. For this purpose, two performance measure dimensions were adopted: feature selection rate R as defined in (8) and feature predictability score P as defined in (10). The feature analysis was categorized into two phases.\n1) The identification of individual input features. Here, for (8) and (9) the feature set |Aj| was set to one, which indicates that only one input feature was analyzed at a time. Since\nthere were four input features in our dataset, in this phase, P ⊂ A, i.e., P was equal to {A1, A2, A3, A4} (see Table 6 for the definition of A1, . . . , A4), i.e., z in (10) was equal to four.\n2) The identification of feature subset, i.e., identification of the best combination of input\nfeature. Here, for (8) and (9) the feature set |Aj| can be one or two or three or four. After examining the selected feature by the models in the list, there were six different input feature subsets was found. Hence, in this phase, Q ⊂ A, i.e., Q was equal to {A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6} (see Table 7 for the definition of A1, . . . , A6), i.e., z in (10) was equal to six."

The significance of individual features true density, d50, granule size, and shoe speed was examined. The features true density and d50 represents the powder properties. Whereas, the granule size and shoe speed represents the die filling process variables. It can be observed that the selection rate and predictability score of d50 (0.62069 and 0.58626) were higher than that of the selection rate and predictability score of true density (0.55173 and 0.54136). Therefore, d50 possess comparatively higher importance as a powder property than that of the true density. Similarly, the process variable granule size was more influential than that of shoe speed. However, the difference of significance level was marginal, but when the entire four input variables were compared, the process variables were having significantly higher selection rate and predictability score than that of the properties of the powder. This fact was also evident from feature subset analysis."

It says that although the predictability score of subset A3 was highest, the selection rate of subset A1 was highest. This indicates that the evolutionary process often preferred to use the combination of entire features, i.e., the set A1. However, among the subsets A1, A2, and A3, the selection rate of subset A2 was higher, which indicates d50 had the higher ability to represent powder properties than that of true density, but again the difference was marginal (say approximately higher by only four percent)."

      "heading" : "4.2.3 Accuracy of Model Predictions",
      "text" : "Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show the comparison between die filling experimental results and predicted results from the model No 1 of the 10FCV method using FNT. This model was chosen because it has the highest value of R2, which leads to a better fitting between experimental and predicted data. More specifically, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 present the mass collected after each experiment as a function of the shoe speed of the three different MCCs powders for six different granule size ranges. It shows that there is a decrease of mass deposited into the die with increasing shoe speed for all the materials and granules size ranges investigated. Moreover, a general increase of deposited mass at a consistent shoe speed was found with the increasing granule size. MCC DG tends to have higher mass deposited values compare to MCC PH 102 and MCC PH 101 at all the shoe speeds considered and for all the different size ranges analyzed, exception for the granule size range 250-500 µm (Fig. 9(c)). MCC PH 101 and MCC PH 102 show an identical trend in all the experiments performed. Interestingly, results for finest granules (Fig. 9(a) and\nFig. 9(b)) appears to have larger variations (due to the lower experimental reproducibility) compare to those for coarser granules (Fig. 10(b) and Fig. 10(c)). It is clear that the models give better predictions for coarser granules (Fig. 10(b) and Fig. 10(c)) than for finer granules (Fig. 9(a) and Fig. 9(b)) for all the materials under investigation. In particular, the model gives almost identical values to the measured ones for coarser granules, which proves that the FNT method used can predict die filling behavior for such materials with high accuracy. The accuracy of the model appears to rely on the consistency (or scattering) of the experimental data."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusions",
      "text" : "Flexible neural tree (FNT) was used to predict die filling behavior of MCCs granules of different size ranges. Two main methods were investigated, 10-fold cross-validation (CV) and 5x2-fold CV. Computational intelligence (CI) models were developed using FNT, multilayer perceptron, reduced error pruning tree, and Gaussian process regression. It was observed that the flexible neural tree models performed better than other CI techniques. Additionally, by examining FNT models of each method, it was found that 10-fold CV was a more efficient method with a higher correlation coefficient than the 5x2 fold CV. The experimental results were used as inputs and outputs of the FNT models. The constructed model efficiently predicted the deposited mass based on the knowledge gathered from the experimental data. Similarly, the feature analysis discovered that the shoe speed and the granule size are more significant in terms of governing the deposited mass than the raw powder properties (true density and d50). Interestingly, die filling behavior of coarser granules are easier to predict than fine granules for all the materials considered. This is due to the higher reproducibility of the experimental data for larger granules."

    "abstractText" : "In this work, a computational intelligence (CI) technique named flexible neural tree (FNT) was developed to predict die filling performance of pharmaceutical granules and to identify significant die filling process variables. FNT resembles feedforward neural network, which creates a tree-like structure by using genetic programming. To improve accuracy, FNT parameters were optimized by using differential evolution algorithm. The performance of the FNT-based CI model was evaluated and compared with other CI techniques: multilayer perceptron, Gaussian process regression, and reduced error pruning tree. The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using die filling as a case study. The die filling experiments were performed using a model shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG). The feed powders were roll-compacted and milled into granules. The granules were then sieved into samples of various size classes. The mass of granules deposited into the die at different shoe speeds was measured. From these experiments, a dataset consisting true density, mean diameter (d50), granule size, and shoe speed as the inputs and the deposited mass as the output was generated. Cross-validation (CV) methods such as 10FCV and 5x2FCV were applied to develop and to validate the predictive models. It was found that the FNT based CI model (in the cases of both CV methods) performed much better than other CI models. Additionally, it was observed that process variables such as the granule size and the shoe speed had a higher impact on ∗Corresponding author Neural Comput & Applic (2016) DOI:10.1007/s00521-016-2545-8 1 ar X iv :1 70 9. 04 31 8v 1 [ cs .N E ] 1 6 M ay 2 01 7 the predictability than that of the powder property such as d50. Furthermore, validation of model prediction with experimental data showed that the die filling behavior of coarse granules could be better predicted than that of fine granules.",
