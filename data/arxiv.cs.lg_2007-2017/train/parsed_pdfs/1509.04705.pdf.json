      "text" : "Nowadays development of various socio-economic processes, which are becoming increasingly interconnected, accelerates more actively. In this regard, it is necessary to use approaches, which are already well known, more extensively. It is also important to develop new approaches to solving the problem of forecasting grouped time series (TS), which describe certain process indicators.\nThe plain fact is that during the development of forecasting TS models it is necessary to consider not only the tendencies of forecasted TS, but also tendencies of other TS which can influence on it. For example, such macroeconomic indicators as gross domestic product and the level of exports described by a TS are in explicit dependence, as well as the average level of income and level of education, health care and average life expectancy.\nAt the same time it is also clear that many TS have similar laws of changing values of its components and they can be combined in a subgroup according to the criterion of similarity of these laws [12]. In this case, it is advisable to develop a forecasting model that is common to all TS included in the subgroup for the purpose of direct use to forecast all private TS subgroups or further refinement of forecasting models for individual private TS (in the case of lack of precise predicted values while using the general model) [11].\nThe process of developing the model of forecasting TS is characterized by the highest computational complexity. That means that the use of a common forecasting model for a TS subgroup can be a significant step in the development of approaches to the analysis of correlating TS. It allows to carry out forecasting of private TS in a subgroup with acceptable time-consuming.\nIt is obvious that the use of cluster analysis techniques, namely clustering algorithms such as k-means algorithm [8, 9], the algorithm of fuzzy c-means (FCM-algorithm) [2, 3], EM-algorithm [10], will bring together similar TS into subgroups (clusters) and determine TS-centroids of clusters. All of that is necessary for solving the problem of common forecasting models development for TS subgroups. In addition to actual development of forecasting TS-centroid clusters models, it is suggested to use an approach that supposes construction of forecasting models on the base of strict binary trees (SBT) and modified clonal selection algorithm (MCSA) with the formation of analytical dependencies. They describe certain values of TS and provide minimum affinity values, in other words average forecasting error rate [6].\nThe aim of the paper is to develop an approach to forecasting grouped time series with the use of cluster analysis algorithms, which provides a forecast with reasonable time-consuming."

      "text" : "Suppose that there is a group of TS T : ( 1, )it i m . Therewith, let each TS it\nconsists of n (10 30)n  elements ( 1, ).jit j n\nSignificant interest is in the solution of the problem of developing forecasting\nmodels for all TS in a group with reasonable time-consuming.\nTime series, as well as other objects of data analysis, can be joined into clusters (subgroups) taking into account values of certain features. They are expectation values, dispersion and others. They can be calculated on the base of TS elements values, maximum and minimum values of TS, etc.\nThe problem of selection of an analytic dependence is usually solved in the process of forecasting models development for the purpose of calculating TS future values. This analytic dependence describes the variation of TS values of the elements in time in a best way. So, it seems appropriate to use similar mathematical laws of changing TS values in time for grouping TS into clusters.\nThe hypothesis of possible similarities between mathematical laws of changing TS values, and consequently, correspondent kinds of analytical dependences can be explained by the fact that many socio-economic indicators are interrelated, and changing trends of one of them causes a change in the trends of the other.\nUnfortunately, there is no available information about what TS form connected subgroups in a group of analyzed TS. This fact leads to a need for additional methods of analysis, such as cluster analysis techniques.\nThe use of such clustering algorithms as k-means algorithm [8, 9], FCM-algorithm [2, 3], EM-algorithm [10], during iterative calculations allows to divide groups of objects into a predetermined number of clusters according to some optimality criterion, in addition to determining the coordinates of clusters centroids.\nDuring handling the problem of TS clustering, centroids coordinates can be used to form integrating TS-centroids, which characterize private TS included in corresponding clusters. It is obvious that a certain forecasting model can be developed for TS centroid. Then it can be used either directly for forecasting private TS assigned to a particular cluster or as a basic model for the purpose of further clarification and application for forecasting private TS.\nIn order to minimize the time spent on the development of forecasting models,\nit is suggested to use k-means algorithm [9] that implements the partition of ob-\njects of group T into sub-groups ( 1, )rT r c so that\n1\n; c\nr\nr T T   (1)\n;r hT T  1, ;r c 1, ;h c ;r h\n;rT T  1,r c .\nIn the context of solving TS clustering problem it is supposed to understand\nTS as an object. Let ( )r iu t be a characteristic function, which can take two values: 0, if the object does not belong to the cluster, and 1 if the object belongs to a cluster. Then a clear c -partition of the group objects in the cluster can be de-\nscribed by the matrix [ ( )]r iU u t ( ( ) {0, 1};r iu t  1, ;r c 1, ).i m\nThe matrix [ ( )]r iU u t must meet the following requirements:\n1\n( ) 1 c\nr i\nr u t   ( 1,i m ); (2)\n1\n0 ( ) m\nr i\ni u t m    ( 1, )r c . (3)\nK-means algorithm provides minimizing of the objective function:\n2\n1 1\n( , ) ( ) ( , ) c m\nr i r i\nr i J U V u t d v t     , (4)\nwhere [ ( )]r iU u t is the с-partition of the group objects T on the base of the\ncharacteristic functions ( )r iu t , that define that the object it belongs to a cluster\n;rT 1( , ..., )cV v v — centroids of clusters; ( , )r id v t is the distance between the\ncenter of the cluster rv and the object it ; c is the number of clusters ;rT m is\nthe number of objects; 1, ;r c 1,i m .\nThe following steps should be done during the implementation of k-means\nalgorithm [3].\n1. Initialization of the initial c-partition [ ( )],r iU u t that must match the re-\nquirements (2) and (3).\n2. The calculation of clusters centroids coordinates:\n1\n1 ( ) ,\nm j j r r i i\nir\nv u t t m    \nwhere rm is the number of objects related to cluster ;r 1, .j n\n3. Calculation of a new c-partition [ ( )],r iU u t that must match the require-\nments (2) and (3).\n4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the desired accuracy :\n( , ) ( , ) ,J U V J U V   where ( , ),J U V ( , )J U V are the values of the objective\nfunction (4) in two successive iterations (or until prescribed number of iterations\nH is done).\nIf it is necessary to calculate the distance ( , )r id v t between the center of the\ncluster rv and the object ,it usually Euclidean metric is used. In this case\n( , )r id v t is calculated as 0.5\n2\n1\n( , ) ( ) , n j j\nr i r i\nj d v t v t         \nwhere n is the features’ number of the object. So in the context of solving the problem of TS clustering on the base of similarity of mathematical laws of TS values changing, it is suggested to do modification to perform this metric so as to take into account various relevance of TS elements (most distant in time from the time of forecasting) and larger relevance of other TS elements (closest in time to the moment of forecasting) [1]\n0.5\n2\n1\n( )( , ) . n j j\nr ir i j\nj v td v t\nn\n     \n   (5)\nThe utility of such a modification can be explained so that with the passage of time the dependencies between socio-economic indicators change. So, during the forming of forecasting models, larger preference should be given to the closest TS\nelements in time of forecasting. The use of the weighting coefficients j n sug-\ngests the most significant differences between the values of the most relevant TS elements (for example, if j n then the weight value is 1, and if 1j then it is\n1 ).n The use of formula (5) will not only take into account the relevance of TS\nelements, but also in a view of high sensitivity to divergent TS trends, it will provide unification of clusters on the base of similarity of the trends.\nHowever, there is a problem, the solution of which is a principal in the case of cluster analysis techniques. This problem is related to the different scale of the analyzed TS which characterize various socio-economic indicators. Such indicators have different unit of measurement, a variety of ranges and corresponding statistical features (statistical expectation and so on).\nTo solve this problem it is advisable to use the algorithms of normalization,\nwhich are widely used in the statistics, mathematical economics and econometrics. Their point is to define a medium level — median, according to which all analyzed TS are aligned.\nA certain conditional straight can be used as a median, as well as one of TS of\nthe analyzed TS group or TS-centroid S, which jS elements are defined as:\n1\n1 ,\nm j\nj i\ni S t m   \nwhere jit is the j-th element of the i-th TS; 1, ;i m 1, ;j n m is the number of TS; n is the number of elements of TS-centroid.\nNormalization algorithm of the i-th TS ( 1, ),i m which is based on\nTS-centroid S, can be represented by the following sequence of steps. Step 1. 1.1. The average step hS of changing TS-centroid elements is determined as\n 1,1,max( ) min( ) ,j jj nj n S ShS n  where n is the number of elements of TS-centroid; jS is the j-th element of\nTS-centroid S.\n1.2. The average step iht of changing of the i-th TS elements ( 1, )i m is determined:\n 1,1,max( ) min( ) , j j i ii j nj n t tht n  \nwhere n is the number of TS elements; j it is the j-th element of the i-th TS. Step 2. 2.1. The average TS centroid level is determined:\n1\n1 ,\nn\nj\nj S S n   \nwhere n is the number of elements of TS centroid; jS is the j-th element of TS\ncentroid.\n2.2. The average level it of the i-th TS ( 1, )i m is determined as:\n1\n1 ,\nn j\ni i\nj t t n   \nwhere n is the number of TS elements; j it is the j-th element of the i-th TS. Step 3. The value j\nidt is calculated. It represents a ratio of diminution between the aver-\nage level it of the i-th TS and the j-th element\nj\nit of the i-th TS to the average\nstep :iht\n( ) ,j ji i i it t t ht  \nwhere jit is the j-th element of the i-th TS; it is the average level of the i-th TS;\niht is the average step of changing of the i-th TS elements; 1, ;i m 1, .j n Step 4. The j-th element j it of the i-th TS is transformed into:\n.j ji it S t hS  \nSuch converted TS can further be used for clusterization with the help of\nk-means algorithm.\nSince clusters centroids express general trends for TS subgroups, which form correspondent clusters, it is appropriate to develop forecasting models for TS-centroid.\nNowadays, there are different approaches to building TS forecasting models. One of the most perspective approach is the implementation of evolutionary algorithms (genetic algorithms [13, 14], clonal selection algorithms [4, 7]) which based on the principles of natural selection. They provide (at acceptable time expenses) construction of TS forecasting models that describe in certain TS values a\nbest way. They can be also characterized by acceptable indicators values of quality models.\nIn the context of solving the problem of forecasting models development for TS-centroid of clusters, it is appropriate to use the modified clonal selection algorithm. This algorithm simulates the natural laws of the immune system functioning [5, 15] and provides the formation of quite complex analytical functions [6]. The principles of developing forecasting models of k -order with the use of MCSA were investigated in [7]. MCSA allows to form an analytical dependence on the base of SBT at an acceptable time expenses, that describes certain TS values and provides a minimum affinity (affinity) — average forecasting error rate (AFER):\n1\n1 100%,( )\nn j j j\nj k AFER f d d n k \n     \n   (6)\nwhere jd и jf are respectively the actual (fact) and forecasted values for the\nj-th element of TS (for the j-th timing); n is the number of TS elements (number of timing).\nIn the context of solving the problem of forecasting TS subgroups as ,jd it\nis suggested to use, for example, the j-th element j\nit of the i-th TS or the corre-\nsponding j-th element j\nrv of the r-th TS centroid cluster.\nPossible options for analytical dependences are presented in the form of antibodies ,Ab which recognize antigens Ag (certain TS values). An antibody\nAb is selected as «the best one». It provides the minimum value of affinity Aff [6]. Coding of an antibody Ab is carried out by recording signs in a line.\nThe signs are selected from three alphabets [6]:\n the alphabet of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) — }/'','','',''{ Operation ;\n the functional alphabet, where letters '','','' ,'',' ELQCS define mathematical\nfunctions «sine», «cosine», «square root», «natural logarithm», «exhibitor», and the sign '_' means the absence of any mathematical function, –\n}'_','','','' ,'',''{ ELQCSFunctional  ;\n the alphabet of terminals, where letters '',...,'','' zba define the arguments re-\nquired analytical dependence and the sign ?'' defines a constant, }'?','',...,'',''{ zbaTerminal  .\nThe use of these three signs alphabets provides a correct conversion of randomly generated antibodies into the analytical dependence. The structure of such antibodies can be described with the help of SBT [6, 7].\nThe number of signs in the alphabet of terminals Terminal in the antibody Ab determines maximal possible order K of forecasting models (K k,\nwhere k is the real model order), i.e. having the value of the element jd in forecasting TS at the j-th moment of time, K values of TS elements can be used as: , j Kd  …, 2,jd  1.jd \nThe use of SBT type, illustrated in Fig. 1, allows to build complex analytical\ndependence and provides high accuracy of forecasting TS [6].\nSuch SBT can be generated as a composition result of one «left» subtree of the maximum possible order 3K  and some «right» subtrees of the maximum possible order 2.K \nThus the term «left» subtree («right» subtree) is used for the branch (left or\nright) of SBT level in which it is necessary to include a new subtree.\nIn this case it is rational to form antibodies by subdividing SBT into subtrees, then execute the subtree-walk of each vertex forming the ordered symbol lists on its vertices and then combining these lists consecutively [6].\nForming the symbol ordered list on the base of a subtree the consecutive double subtree-walk is carried out: at first moving the subtree bottom-up left to right we walk the vertices containing the alphabetic terminal signs Terminal in pairs and correspondingly above placed vertices containing the alphabetic functional symbols ,Functional and then moving in the same direction it is necessary to\ngo around in pairs the vertices containing the alphabetic arithmetic operation signs Operation and correspondingly above placed vertices containing the alphabetic\nfunctional signs .Functional\nThe first two signs in such an antibody contain the pair of zero level SBT from the functional alphabet Functional and arithmetic operation alphabet Operation .\nThen there are the lists of the signs corresponding to the «right» maximum possible ordered subtrees 2K  (moving the SBT bottom-up) and finally the symbol list of the «left» maximum possible ordered subtree 3.K \nUsing such a way of antibody formation we ensure the visualization of the SBT structure representation in the form of the subtrees union, and the antibody is easily interpreted in the analytical dependence.\nFor example, the antibody formed on the base of SBT as shown in Fig. 1 is\ncoded by the line of signs: ,L S / SeSdC S EaCbEa  \nwhich can be transformed into an analytical dependence:\n( , , , ) ln(cos(sin(exp( ) cos( )) exp( )) sin(sin( ) / sin( )).f a b c d a b c d a    (7)\nIn the task of a forecasting model development of k-order where 4k  and considering the order of , , ,a b c d in the terminal alphabet ,Terminal the ana-\nlytical dependence (7) can be written as:\n1 2 3 4 1\n2 3 4 1\n( , , , ) ln(cos(sin(exp( )\ncos( )) exp( )) sin(sin( ) / sin( )).\nj j j j j\nj j j j\nf d d d d d\nd d d d\n    \n   \n \n  \nInterpreting the antibodies into the analytical dependences it is rational to use the recursive procedure of interpretation [6]. MCSA applied to the searching for «the best» antibody defining «the best» analytic dependence includes the preparatory part (realizes the formation of the initial antibody population) and iterative part (presupposes the ascending antibodies ordering of affinity ;Aff the selection\nand cloning the part of «the best» antibodies, that are characterized by the least affine value ;Aff the hypermutation of the antibodies clones; self-destruction of\nthe antibodies clones «similar» to the other clones and antibodies of the current population; calculating the affinity of the antibodies clones and forming the new antibodies population; suppression of the population received; generation of the new antibodies and adding them to the current population until the ingoing size; the conditional test of the MCSA completion.\nIt is arguable that the application of the general forecasting models developed for TS-centroid of the clusters ensures the uniqueness of the forecasting result for all the particular TS labeled as a cluster since while prognostic value calculation for the particular TS based on the analytic dependences defining prognostic models for TS-centroid of the clusters private item values of TS stand for the values of variables.\nOn the base of the foregoing approach to a TS group forecasting ensuring the forecasting result within the acceptable expenditures of time can be realized after execution of the following steps.\nStep 1. Normalization of all TS groups in reference to their average level ex-\npressed by the TS-centroid .S Step 2. Normalized TS clusterization of the set quantity of clusters c.\nStep 3. Forecasting model creation for the TS-centroid of clusters on the base\nof SBT and MCSA.\nStep 4. Private initial TS forecasting with the use of the forecasting models for\nthe TS-centroid of clusters.\nIt should be noted that the TS forecasting with use of the general forecasting\nmodels doesn't conduct to receiving the general forecasting for the TS subgroup (cluster). The forecasting model defines only the mathematical law of elements value change of TS by means of the analytical dependence formed with MCSA applied. The forecasted values for every particular TS will be unique as they will be calculated by means of substitution known private elements values of TS in the general forecasting model."

In the reviewed example 600 iterations of MCSA for population of 20 antibodies were executed. Coefficient of antibodies’ cloning was equal to 0,3. Coefficient of clones’ reproduction was equal to 0,8.\nComputer working under the 64-bit Windows 7 version with RAM of 2 Gb and the two-nuclear Pentium 4 processor with a clock frequency of 3,4 GHz was used for experiment. 115,5 seconds were spent for creation of one forecasting model. Thus, 462 seconds (7 minutes 42 seconds) are necessary for creation of 4 models, and 2541 seconds (42 minutes 21 seconds) are necessary for creation of 22 models, that in 5,5 times more.\nAt realization of the offered method the additional time-consuming caused by need of TS clustering procedure takes place. However, time spent for clustering procedure in the reviewed example takes only 0,254 seconds that much less time which needs to be spent for additional creation of 18 forecasting models [this time takes 2079 seconds (34 minutes 39 seconds)].\nAt application of this method for new grouped TS, that is for the first time, it is necessary to perform of TS clustering procedure for different quantity of clusters for finding of the optimum splitting determined by a minimum value of clustering algorithm criterion function (1). But also in this case essential decrease in time expenditure on forecasting for grouped TS takes place. Graphic dependences for elements’ values of private TS, carried respectively to clusters 1, 2, 3 and 4, are presented in Fig. 2–5 (including forecast values for 3 steps forward).\nAll TS are numbered according to the numbering, given in Table 1.

      "text" : "The offered approach of forecasting for grouped TS realizes the combined use of FCM-algorithm and forecasting models on the base of SBT and MCSA and provides individual forecast values for all TS in group with acceptable time-consuming.\nThe results of experimental studies received during macroeconomic indicators’ forecasting of Russian Federation confirm prospects of application and further development for the offered approach.\nUse of cluster analysis’ algorithms allows to form clusters (subgroups) of the connected TS, having similar change laws of elements’ values, and provides increase of TS forecasting speed. Application of the general forecasting models (forecasting models for TS-centroids of clusters) for private TS, entering into the relevant subgroups, doesn't lead to essential decrease in forecasting accuracy. Thus the demanded forecast accuracy for private TS can be reached in the course of general forecasting model improving with application of MCSA."
