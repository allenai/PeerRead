We develop direct and highly efficient reconstruction algorithms based on deep-learning. In this approach image reconstruction is performed with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), whose weights are adjusted prior to the actual image reconstruction based on a set of training data. Our results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning approach reconstructs images with a quality comparable to state of the art iterative approaches from sparse data. At the same time, the numerically complexity of our approach is much smaller and the image reconstruction is performed in a fraction of the time required by iterative methods.\nIndex Terms—Deep learning, convolutional neural networks, photoacoustic tomography, sparse data, image reconstruction, inverse problems.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDeep learning is a rapidly emerging research area that has significantly improved performance of many pattern recognition and machine learning applications [1], [2]. Deep learning algorithms make use of special artificial neural network designs for representing a nonlinear input to output map together with optimization procedures for adjusting the weights of the network during the training phase.

In this paper, we a develop a deep learning framework for image reconstruction in photoacoustic tomography (PAT). To concentrate on the main ideas we restrict ourselves to the sparse data problem in PAT in a circular measurement geometry. With minor modifications our approach can be extended to an arbitrary measurement geometry in arbitrary dimension."

      "text" : "PAT is a non-invasive coupled-physics biomedical imaging technology which beneficial combines the high contrast of pure optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging [18]–[21]. It is based on the generation of acoustic waves by illuminating a semi-transparent biological or medical object with short optical pulses. The induced time dependent acoustic waves are measured outside of the sample with acoustic detectors, and the measured data are used to recover an image of the interior (see Fig. I.1). As in many other imaging modalities, high spatial resolution in PAT can be achieved by measuring the acoustic data with high spatial and temporal sampling rate [22], [23]. While temporal samples can be easily collected at or above the Nyquist rate, the spatial ar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n04 58\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n5 A\npr 2\n2 sampling density is usually limited [24]–[29]. In fact, each spatial measurement requires a separate sensor and high quality detectors are often costly. Moving the detector elements around can increase the number of sensor locations but it is time consuming and introduces motion artifacts. Therefore, in actual\napplications, the number of sensors locations is usually small compared to the desired resolution which yields to a so called sparse data problem.\nApplying standard algorithms to sparse data yields low-quality images containing severe undersampling artifacts. To some extent, these artifacts can be reduced by using iterative image reconstruction algorithms [30]–[36] which allow to include prior knowledge such as smoothness, sparsity or total variation (TV) constraints [37]–[42]. These algorithms tend to be time consuming as the forward and adjoint problem have to be applied repeatedly. Further, iterative algorithms have their own limitations. For example, the reconstruction quality strongly depends on the used a-priori knowledge about the objects to be recovered (for example, sparsity of the gradient in TV minimization). Such assumptions are often not strictly satisfied in real world scenarios which again limits the theoretically achievable reconstruction quality. To overcome these limitation in this paper we develop a new reconstruction approach based on deep learning that comes with the following properties: (i) it has low numerical complexity; (ii) no explicit knowledge of prior information on the object class is required; and (iii) it yields a reconstruction quality comparable to state of the art methods for sparse data.\nFig. I.2. ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED DEEP LEARNING APPROACH. In the first step apply a standard linear reconstruction method to the sparse data. In a second step a deep convolutional neural network is applied to the intermediate reconstruction which outputs an almost artifact free image."

      "text" : "Our reconstruction approach for the sparse data problem in PAT uses deep convolutional neural networks in combination with any simple linear reconstruction method as preprocessing step. Essentially, it consists of the following two steps (see Fig. I.2):\n(1) In the first step, a standard linear PAT image reconstruc-\ntion algorithm is applied, which yields an approximation of the original object including under-sampled artifacts. (2) In the second step, a deep convolutional neural network\n(CNN) is applied. The parameters of the network are trained to map the intermediate reconstruction from the first step to an artifact free final image.\nThe first step can be implemented by any standard linear reconstruction algorithm including filtered backprojection (FBP) [43]–[49], Fourier methods [50]–[54], or time reversal [55]– [58]. In fact, all these methods can be implemented efficiently using at most O(D3) floating point operations (FLOPS) for reconstructing a high resolution image on an D × D grid. The CNN applied in the second step depends on weights that are adjusted using a set of training data to achieve artifact removal. The weights in the CNN are learned during the so called training phase which is performed prior to the actual image reconstruction [2]. In our current implementation we use the U-net architecture originally designed in [59] for image segmentation. Application of the trained CNN for image reconstruction is fast. In fact, one application of the CNN requires O(FLD2) FLOPS, where F is the number of\n3 channels in the first convolution and L describes the depth of the network. Typically, FL will be in the order of D and the number of FLOPS for evaluating the CNN is comparable to the effort of performing an FBP reconstruction. On the other hand, iterative reconstruction are much slower as they repeatedly apply implementations of the forward operator and its adjoint.\nTo the best of our knowledge this is the first paper using deep learning or neural networks for PAT. Related approaches applying CNNs for different medical imaging technologies including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appeared recently in [11]–[17]. The author of [15] shares his opinions on deep learning for image reconstruction. In [14] deep learning is applied for imaging problems where the normal operator is shift invariant; PAT does not belong to this class. A different learning approach for addressing the limited view problem in PAT is proposed in [60]."

Let us denote by h : Rd → R the initial pressure distribution which provides diagnostic information about the patient and which is the quantity of interest in PAT.

For keeping the presentation simple and focusing on the main ideas we only consider the case of d = 2 spatial dimensions in the following.

The goal is to recover h from measurements of p made on the boundary ∂BR.\nIn a complete data situation, PAT in a circular measurement geometry consist in recovering the function h from data\n(Ph)(z, t) := p(z, t) for (z, t) ∈ ∂BR × [0, T ] , (II.2)\nwhere p denotes the solution of (II.1) with initial data h and T is the final measurement time. Several efficient methods for recovering h from complete data Ph are well investigated (see, for example, [43]–[58]).

      "text" : "In practical applications, the acoustic pressure Ph can only be measured with a finite number of acoustic detectors. The standard sampling scheme for PAT in circular geometry assumes uniformly sampled values\np[m, · ] := Ph (zm, · ) , for m = 1, . . . ,M , (II.4)\n4\nwith zm := R cos (2π(m− 1)/M) R sin (2π(m− 1)/M)  . (II.5) Here p[i, · ] : [0, T ] → R is the signal corresponding to the mth detector, and M is the total number of detector locations. Of course, in practice also the signals p[m, · ] have to be represented by discrete samples. However, temporal samples can easily be collected at a high sampling rate compared to the spatial sampling, where each sample requires a separate sensor.\nIn the case a sufficiently large number of detectors is used, according to Shannon sampling theory implementations of full data methods yield almost artifact free reconstructions (for a detailed analysis of sampling in PAT see [22]). As the fabrication of an array of detectors is demanding, experiments using integrating line detectors are often carried out using a single line detector, scanned on circular paths using scanning stages [63], [64], which is very time consuming. Recently, systems using arrays of 64 parallel line detectors have been demonstrated [25], [26]. To keep production costs low and to allow fast imaging the number M will typically be kept much smaller than advised by Shannon sampling theory and one deals with highly under-sampled data.\nDue to the high frequency information contained in time, there is still hope to recover high resolution images form spatially under-sampled data. For example, iterative algorithms, using TV minimization yield good reconstruction results from\nundersampled data (see [24], [28], [42], [65]). However such algorithms are quite time consuming as they require evaluating the forward and adjoint problem repeatedly (for TV typically at least several hundreds of times). Moreover the reconstruction quality depends on strong a-priori assumptions on the class of objects to be reconstructed. The deep learning approach proposed in this paper requires a much smaller numerical effort compared to iterative methods and further does not require explicit prior knowledge about the object to be recovered."

      "heading" : "III. DEEP LEARNING FOR PAT IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION",
      "text" : "Suppose that sparsely sampled data of the form (II.4), (II.5) are at our disposal. As illustrated in Fig. I.2 in our deep learning approach we first apply a linear reconstruction procedure to the sparsely sampled data (p[m, · ])Mm=1 which outputs a discrete image X ∈ RD×D . According to Shannon sampling theory an aliasing free reconstruction requires M ≥ πD detector positions [22]. However, in practical applications we will have M D, in which case severe undersampling artifacts appear in the reconstructed image. To reduce these artifacts we apply a CNN to the intermediate reconstruction which outputs an almost artifact free reconstruction Y ∈ RD×D . How to implement such an approach is described in the following.\nA. Image restoration by neural networks\nThe task of removing artifacts can be formulated as supervised machine learning problem. In that context, the aim is finding a restoration function Φ: RD×D → RD×D that maps the input image X ∈ RD×D (containing undersampling artifacts) to the output image Y ∈ RD×D which should be almost artifact free. For constructing such a function Φ, one assumes that a family of training data T := (Xn,Yn)Nn=1 are given. Any training example (Xn,Yn) consist of an input image Xn and a corresponding artifact-free output image Yn. The restoration function is constructed in such a way that the training error\nE(T ; Φ) := N∑\nn=1\nd(Φ(Xn),Yn) (III.1)\nis minimized, where d : RD×D × RD×D → R measures the error made by Φ on the training examples.\n5 Particular powerful supervised machine learning methods are based on neural networks (NNs). In our context the restoration function is taken in the form\nΦW = (σL ◦WL) ◦ · · · ◦ (σ1 ◦W1) , (III.2)\nwhere any factor σ` ◦ W` is the composition of a linear transformation (or matrix) W` ∈ RD`+1×D` and a nonlinearity σ` : R → R that is applied component-wise. Here L denotes the number of processing layers, σ` are so called activation functions and W := (W1, . . . ,WL) is the weight vector. Neural networks can be graphically illustrated in the form of layers as illustrated in Fig. III.1. Between any neighboring layer in the NN the factor σ` ◦W` maps the variables of layer ` to the variables of layer `+ 1. The variables in the first layer are the entries of the input vector X and the variables in the last layer are the entries of the output vector Y. Note that in our situation we use equal dimension D := D1 = DL+1 of the input and output layer. Approximation properties of NNs have been analyzed, for example, in [66], [67].\nThe entries of the weight vector W are called weights and are the variable parameters in the NN. They are adjusted during the training phase prior to the actual restoration process. This is commonly implemented using gradient descent methods to\nminimize the training set error [2], [68]\nE(T ,W) := E(T ,ΦW) = N∑\nn=1\nd (ΦW(Xn),Yn) (III.3)\nThe standard gradient method uses the update rule W(k+1) = W(k)−η∇E(T ,W(k)), where∇E denotes the gradient of the error function in the second component and W(k) the weight vector in the kth iteration. In the context of neural networks the update term is also known as error backpropagation. If the number of training examples is large then the gradient method becomes notoriously slow. In such a situation a popular acceleration is the stochastic gradient descent algorithm [2], [68]. Here for each iteration a small subset T (k) of the whole training set is chosen randomly at any iteration and the weights are adjusted using the modified update formula W(k+1) = W(k) − η∇E(T (k),W(k)) for the kth iteration. In the context of image reconstruction similar acceleration strategies are known as ART or Kaczmarz type reconstruction methods [23], [69], [70]. The number of elements in T (k) is called batch size and η is referred to as the lerning rate. To stabilize the iterative process it is common to add a so-called momentum term β (W(k) −W(k−1)) with some nonnegative parameter β in the update of the kth iteration."

      "text" : "In our application the inputs and outputs are high dimensional vectors. Such large scale problems require special network designs, where the weight matrices are not taken as arbitrary matrices but take a special form reducing its effective dimensionality. When the input is an image, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use such special network designs that are widely and successfully used in various imaging applications [68], [71]. A main property of CNNs is the invariance with respect to certain transformations of the input. In CNNs the weight matrices are block diagonal, where each block corresponds to a convolution with a filter of small support and the number of blocks corresponds to the number of different filters (or channels) used in each layer. Each block is therefore a sparse band matrix, where the non-zero entries of the band matrices determine the filters of the convolution. CNNs are currently\n6 extensively used in image processing and image classification, since they outperform most comparable algorithms [2]. They are also the method of choice for the present paper.\nThere are various CNN designs that can differ in the number of layers, the form of the activation functions and the particular form of the weight matrices W`. In this paper we use a particular CNN based on the so called U-net introduced in [59]. It has been originally designed for biomedical image segmentation and recently been used for low dose CT in [13], [14]. The U-net is based on the so-called fully convolutional network of [72]. Such network architectures employ multichannel filtering which means that the weight matrix in every layer consists of a family of multiple convolution filters followed by the rectified linear unit (ReLU) as activation function. The rectified linear unit is defined by ReLU(x) := max {x, 0}. As shown in [13], the residual images X − Y often have a simpler structure and are more accessible to the U-net than the original outputs. Therefore, learning the residuals and subtracting them from the inputs after the last layer is more effective than directly training for Y. Such an approach is followed in our implementation. The resulting deep neural network architecture is illustrated in Fig. III.2; see also [13], [14], [59]."

For the sparse data in (II.4) we use M = 30 detector locations and discretize the pressure signals p[m, · ] with 300 uniform samples in the time interval [0, 2]. In our initial studies we generate simple phantoms consisting of indicator functions of ellipses with support in the unit cube [−1, 1]2 ⊆ R2.

For such superpositions of random ellipse phantoms, the trained network is in all tested case able to almost completely eliminate the sparse data artifacts in the test images. Fig. IV.1 illustrates such result for one of the test phantoms. The top row shows the actual phantom Y and the sparse data p. The bottom row in Fig. IV.1 shows the result of the FPB algorithm (left) which contains severe undersampling artifacts and the result of applying the CNN (right) which is almost artifact free.

For that purpose we added Gaussian noise with a standard\ndeviation equal to 2% of the maximal value to the simulated data. Reconstruction results are shown in Fig. IV.2. There we show two reconstruction results with a trained network. In one case we used the network trained on the exact data (bottom left) and the other case the network trained on the noisy data (bottom right). The reconstructions using each of the networks are again almost artifact free.\nWe also compared our trained network to penalized TV mini-\n9 mization [41], [42]\n1 2 ‖p− P(Y)‖22 + λ‖Y‖TV → min Y .

For the presented results we take λ = 0.002 and used the lagged diffusivity algorithm [74] with 20 outer and 20 inner iterations for numerically minimizing (IV.1). TV minimization exploits the sparsity of the gradient as prior information and is therefore especially well suited for reconstructing sums of indicator functions and can be seen as state of the art approach for reconstructing such type of objects. As can be seen from the results in Fig. IV.3, TV minimization in fact gives very accurate results. Nevertheless, the deep learning approach yields comparable results in both cases; the relative `2 reconstruction errors for CNN reconstructions are even smaller than the errors for the corresponding TV results (see Tab. I).\nIn order to investigate limitations of the presented we also applied the deep learning to test data, where the training data is not adequate. The results are illustrated in Fig. IV.4, which shows a test phantom similar to the Shepp Logan phantom and its reconstructions using FBP, the CNN improved version and total variation minimization. As expected, the network is not able to remove all the artifacts this time. However, despite the test object has features not appearing in the training data, still artifacts are removed by the network trained on the ellipse phantoms. We see these initial results quite encouraging; future work will be done to extensively test the framework using a variety of training and test data sets.\nThe relative `2-reconstruction errors for numerical results presented above are summarized in Tab. I."

    "abstractText" : "The development of fast and accurate image reconstruction algorithms is a central aspect of computed tomography. In this paper we investigate this issue for the sparse data problem of photoacoustic tomography (PAT). We develop direct and highly efficient reconstruction algorithms based on deep-learning. In this approach image reconstruction is performed with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), whose weights are adjusted prior to the actual image reconstruction based on a set of training data. Our results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning approach reconstructs images with a quality comparable to state of the art iterative approaches from sparse data. At the same time, the numerically complexity of our approach is much smaller and the image reconstruction is performed in a fraction of the time required by iterative methods.",
