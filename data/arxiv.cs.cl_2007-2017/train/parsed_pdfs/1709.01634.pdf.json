      "text" : "All writing systems in the world [8, 5] require some effort in acquisition and use. While for some groups of languages, difficulty and differences may be comparatively small [17], in others the complexity of the script can appear forbidding for all but a minority of scribes. Religious observance, for example, may require the adherents to continue using a script or language that no longer adapts to its language environment and that may thus tend to become ambiguous or incomprehensible. In order to retain a unique pronunciation and, supported by extensive commentaries, continuing understandability, glyphs (diacritics) from were added to letters to distinguish them, or additional letters (matres lectionis) were inserted to represent sounds (such as vowels in the consonant-based (abjad) scripts. However, such additional efforts may not be considered necessary, if the oral tradition in the community is sufficiently strong, such that the texts do not have to be extracted from the writing itself, but are rather remembered while being read. If the Voynich Manuscript (VM, MS 408 in the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University) derives from such a tradition, the difficulty in reading it may be understandable.\nar X\niv :1\n70 9.\n01 63\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 6\nS ep\nThe Voynich Manuscript (VM, MS 408 in the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University) which is written on more than 200 vellum pages has been dated between 1404 and 1438 (University of Arizona, 2011), but its history is largely unknown until the discovery by the bookseller Voynich in 1912. Apart from a few cautious attempts, such as Ref. [3], so far little progress has been achieved in deciphering the VM nor even a decision was reached whether the VM has any meaningful content at all. Before we\nOur hypothesis that the VM is written in natural language, is to be evidenced by showing that the script used in the VM is directly related to Pahlavi, a writing system that was in use for several Iranian languages from before the current era at least until 900 [9]. Pahlavi is a particular case of a language that is notoriously difficult to read. It was used in medieval scriptures, commentaries, and a few other texts [2] related to Zoroastrianism, the pre-Islamic religion of Persia. Over the few centuries of the language evolution, many Pahlavi letters have coalesced, e.g. for the phonemes d, g, j, and y, only a single letters is retained in Pahlavi. Moreover, letters are usually joined in Pahlavi script and can appear thus similar to other letters: E.g., in addition to its proper meaning, a letter can be indistinguishable from as much a sixteen different phoneme or letter combinations [11]. In some words, corrupted forms of letters have become a standard that is accepted to various degrees by the scribes. In addition to Persian words, Pahlavi contains also a large number of heterograms, i.e. around a thousand, partially very common words of Aramaic origin that are meant to be read in Persian (like the Latin abbreviation i.e. is read in English as that is). Finally, as for many other ancient texts, material decay, language drift, scribe errors, unfamiliarity with the original cultural context, and, possibly, the need of the writers to hide the content from contemporary hostility, also contribute to the difficulty of reading the text.\nConcerning recent work on the VM, statistical approaches [1, 10, 14] that search for nonrandom features in data may be bound to fail if the target is quite random to begin with. The standard Voynich character set (EVA) [7] is not too helpful either, because it is unrelated to the phonemics, it breaks some of the letters into smaller parts, and fails to identify ligatures, all of which may further reduce the strength of the statistical analysis, cf. [19, 20, 18, 10]. In addition, the extensive 19th century literature dedicated to religious writing, see e.g. [15] was difficult to access until scanned copies became available online recently, and, finally, it may be construed that our academic habits thwart the systematic study of matters as obscure as the VM.\nThe VM which is written on over 200 vellum pages has been dated between 1404 and 1438 (University of Arizona, 2011), but its history is largely unknown until the discovery by the bookseller Voynich in 1912. Apart from a few cautious attempts such as Ref. [3], so far no progress has been achieved in deciphering the VM nor even a decision was reached whether the VM has any meaningful content at all [18].\nThe present paper aims at providing evidence for the hypothesis that the VM is a readable text with an interest in itself. Our approach consists in establishing a relation between the Voynich and Pahlavi scripts (see Section 2). It will also become clear that only within a cooperation among experts in Pahlavi philology, Zoroastrianism, history of medicine, botany, astronomy and palaeography, the content of the VM can be revealed.\nWe will provide evidence for the proposed relation between the two alphabets by a number\nof examples from VM illustrations as well as from its running text (Section 3). Finally, we will draw (in Section 4) some rather speculative conclusions on the context in which the content of the VM may have originated."

      "heading" : "2 Letters are reverted Pahlavi characters",
      "text" : "Comparing the Voynichese and Pahlavi scripts, we find that many of the characters are upside-down versions of each other, see Table 1. This may be due to the different writing direction of the two scripts. A similar effect that was observed also in the earlier sinistrodextral Brahmi script [4], in which also some of the letters appear as upside-down adoptions from its likely predecessor Aramaic (right to left). Pahlavi, that ultimately derives also from the Aramaic alphabet, has retained the dextrosinistral direction, while the VM is written in the opposite direction.\nIn this way, six of the about 20 Voynich letters can be explained directly (a, h, s, S, r, in our notation, see Table 1, and K, see Table 2). Two more letters (d, c) differ from s and S, respectively, only by an inverted breve diacritic. In addition, there are three more letters that obtain by rotation about a different angle (t, y) or by mirroring (z ). The similarity of eleven out of the comparatively small number of letters of the two alphabets can be considered as a clear indication of a relation between Voynich (V) and Pahlavi (P). Below we will see that the relation extends also to the phonemic level. Two letters o and n that occur frequently in the VM, differ from their counterpart in the P alphabet. It is tempting to relate V o to P pe, but we suggest rather an association to waw. This also supported by the frequent use of o as a word separator in the VM. In Pahlavi a vertical bar is used for this purpose, which is of similar shape as P v, while in the VM apparently the more distinctive letter o has been preferred. Further analysis of the V text will shown whether o, y or a also have a grammatical function. Based on the phonetic content (Sect. 3) of the letters, we assume that, in contrast to Pahlavi, the nasal alveolar is not part of the spectrum of V o, but is represented by V n.\nThe remaining V letters are the “capitals” B, K, M, P, or occur only very rarely (see f57v for a number of other characters, some of which, however, occur nowhere else in the VM). The shape of the V “capitals” may have arisen from a fusion of the respective Pahlavi characters with a vertical stroke (P word separator). We do not consider the capitals to be functional ligatures, though, as they are used also within words or after the word separator (o).\nBox 1: Comments on Table 1. The letters are given in the order to the Aramaic alphabet with resh taking the place of phonetically similar lamed, and jod is placed near daleth and gimel with which it is interchangeable in Pahlavi. Frequently occurring corruptions are given in [brackets] [13]. Strokes from neighbouring characters are removed from the Voynich letters. [a] Appears in B-Pahlavi as a raised character. ℵ represents a glottal stop. [B ] We could not find enough evidence for systematic use of two variants (B and H ) of this character. [g ] Occurs usually in final position, elsewhere y is used instead. [o] V v resembles Syriac vav ( ), Pahlavi vav is identical to resh [y ] the letter represented here is daleth. The actual P-Pahlavi letter yod ( ) shows an interesting similarity to the inverted breve diacritic of V d and V c. Many words have an otiose y ending. [c] This character occurs rarely in the VM, the mere fact that we did not identify a distinctive character for P č does not justify the transliteration of c by č. [z ] is often (or easily) confused with r. [P] occurs often at the beginning of paragraphs. It may be an abbreviation of pad for to, at, in or on."

By the introduction of a number of additional characters, such as to distinguish d, g, n, reading a Voynichese text may have been easier than a Pahlavi text. It is not clear why the history of the deciphering of the VM, does not support this claim. Analysing plant and star names, Bax [3] has suggested a similar reading for some but not all of the letters. We base our transcription on a larger number of samples from the manuscript and compare the results with names from the Zoroastrian cosmological scripture Bundahesh [23, 11], which was composed in the 11th century, and with general vocabulary [13], such that we arrive at a more complete and more reliable transcription that is based not only on the similarity of the letter shapes.

Based on the well known symbols shown in the centres of f70v1 – f73v, the identification with the Pahlavi names is straight-forward, expect for the two pages f71r and f72r1 which show the same symbols (Aries and Taurus) as f70v1 and f71v, respectively. We cannot answer the question whether the two repeated signs do in fact represent the missing Capricorn and\nAquarius.

The same seems true for the plant drawings in the VM, where, in some case, it seems even plausible that the artist followed merely a verbal description rather than an own view or any original drawings. We can thus expect only a few characteristics to be identifiable. In addition, only a few plant names are included in the standard dictionaries (e.g. [13]), such that most of the VM plant depictions will require more research. We will first consider two plants (henbane and cannabis) whose names are easily identifiable and where a visual comparison, see Fig. 1 can be considered as additional evidence for the text-based identification. After this will report on some preliminary attempts, i.e. we are not attempting a botanical identification of the plants [22] and should take into account that, even in comparison to other medieval depictions, the drawings are far from perfect."

E.g. on f17r we find don (dān) which here, however, may refer to buckwheat.\nFolio 21r shows a plant similar to box (buxus) or P šimšār. The first word of the text is Sor (šār). Near the end of the 7th line we find šomšor (with the middle m and š as an odd ligature).\nThe first word of Folio 24r can be read as alālag which would mean anemone (anemone blanda (?)), but the picture does hardly match, although the anemone family has a wide variety of leave shapes and numbers of petals. The must be said for f45v which starts with the same word. A problem with this reading is also that we otherwise ignored the waw after the initial “paragraph marker” P while it would be part of the plant name here.\nChick-pea in P is naxōd which can be found in the beginning of 5th line of 26v. While the leaves are may be plausible, the drawn flowers are less typical, perhaps chick-peas are mentioned only for comparison here and, therefore, not in the beginning of the text.\nThe drawing on f41v is identified as coriander (Coriandrum sativum) [3], or gišn̄ız in P. Ref. [13] gives also the variant kišn̄ız. While the single word that makes up the first line is unrelated to this P word, the second line appears to give several variants, e.g. the 2nd word contains Kš, the third word reads Kšnd.\nDate palm in P us muγ [13] which can be found as the third word of the first line in f56r. The drawing shows a plant with at least the base of the stem and the lower pair of leaves reminiscent of a palm tree."

The second word in the upper row Mht could be mih (false, opposite) or mahist (greatest). The four words in the second row are less ambiguous. We have Bı̄or (bahr, part) for a leaf consisting of three parts, rot (rōd, river) for a set of leaf stems that branch off like a river delta, tšhg, which may relate to (tašt, bowl), and Botr (BATR, a heterogram for pas [13], behind) for one leave behind the other.

Because of the short and repeated Pahlavi names of the mansions, a unambiguous correspondence was possible for only 20 of the mansions, such that we did not include it here. Interestingly, the 1247 stone representation of the Suzhou star chart (1193) that shows the related 28 Chinese constellations has a “cartouche” title beginning with the ideogram for sky that can also be seen in a corrupted and reverted form on f1r of the VM.

The words are grouped around a small square-shaped picture of a swirl-radiating star which could represent a sacrificial fire.\nApp. B includes a transcription of words from the beginning of the third paragraph of f1r. This sample is included not only to show that the Pahlavi transcription applies to the main\ntext, too, but also to demonstrate the difficulty of a translation of the text, which has, however, been noted by all translators of Pahlavi documents.\nIn the illustration on f77v, we find the words oBam yHat otBaNat orShNat oMot dhNy oMotor which can be transcribed as b̄ım duxt wad-baxt rēšinad mı̄h dēn wizār and is translated word-by-word as fear daughter unfortunately wounded: false (alternative? ) religion explanation [13]. This sample, nevertheless, suggests that the “nudes” pages (f75r – f84v) represent medieval medical content.

The question whether the ∩∩ character before the lacuna at the end of this line was originally the initial character of a year, cannot be answered without further analysis of the velum.\nBased on the Pahlavi hypothesis presented here, it seems possible to extract more information from the colophon.

      "text" : "We have not been presented more than a few words, which is mainly due to the inherent difficulties in reading Pahlavi. Therefore, at this point it is not clear, whether the VM contains also words of a different idiom, such as the northwest Indian language Gujarati, whose Parsi dialect contains many Iranian words due to the Zoroastrian influence, although Gujarati does not itself identify as an Iranian language.\nIt is striking that the manuscript does not contain any obvious religious symbolism (apart from the crucifix on f79v, which may well be a later insertion) nor any other culturally identifiable elements. However, the astronomical charts of the VM are related to the world of the Zoroastrian culture in the middle East or South Asia. They do not show any awareness of (earlier?) Arabic astronomy, but seem to follow the cosmological view in the Bundahesh.\nFinally, we want to emphasise that we have no evidence that the VM was produced in Persia (or perhaps even western India). It is also possible that it originates from the regions near the Black Sea where an exchange between Persia and the Italian cities of Genoa and Venice took place around the presupposed time of the production of the VM. Our opinion that the content of the VM is meaningful does not exclude the possibility that it is still a “hoax”, in the sense that it was copied to be sold rather than read. In this process or by later\naction, foliae with critical content may have been removed to further obscure the origin of the manuscript.\nAlthough the proposed transcription is obviously tentative, it is now possible to find many of the VM words in a Pahlavi dictionary [13, 16, 11] using Table 1, which will give at least partial insight into the content of the VM. We are also unable to provide a more precise phonemic account at this stage, although some of the differences (e.g. between V d and P t) may allow for such discussions. It will require a substantial effort to provide a complete translation of the VM, as it seems unlikely that large parts of the text have been passed down also from other sources, i.e. the VM does not appear to be identical to any of the better known Zoroastrism-related scriptures or commentaries, so its content may as well have an interest on its own."

We can identify a place of origin and a date, but not the year in which the manuscript was written. Also we believe to be able to identify the scribe’s name which may refer to a female writer from a medieval Zoroastrian community possible in the city of Trebisonta, the a gateway between Persia, Byzantium and early renaissance Italy.\nThe interpretation is in large part speculative and in need of further research, but is included here in order to stimulate further study as well as to provide in turn additional evidence for the Pahlavi hypothesis.\nBelow we will consider the last page of the VM line-by-line in some detail based on the Pahlavi hypothesis.

Some of the V characters characters are upside-down versions of their Pahlavi counterparts, which may be an effect of different writing directions. Other V letters are related in another obvious way or can be explained as ligatures. Finally, two letters are added, but are easily identifiable from the vocabulary. In principle, it is thus possible to translate Voynich words using a Pahlavi dictionary such as Ref. [13]. Although this process is in many cases successful, is is not always straightforward.\nThe colophon of the Voynich manuscript contains only a few Voynichese letters. Most of the characters resemble Latin letters, but the awkwardness of their shapes contrasts strikingly with the fluency of the proper Voynichese letters. This indicates the possibility that the colophon text was written by a scribe not well acquainted with in Latin letters.

The first a touches the following letter and the second one is corrected ā by an overlapping o. The i is meant to represent Pahlavi y.\nThe word “be finished” in Pahlavi is frazaftan (alternatively haňaftan), which we can read in the second word of the line. We need to assume the leading o is not a word separator but stands as a waw for the f sound (usually f is expressed by p in Pahlavi). Reading the second letter as r is consistent with all occurrences of this character on this page. Another critical assumption is the interpretation of the sixth letter as a ligature of f and t or by an omission of one of the two letter. Also the other letters are unambiguous including the final figure-8 character that always represents an n. We should note again, that an interpretation of the first two words without being biased by the expectation of the explicit, would be very difficult.\nThe last word in Fig. 7 is read as Pahlavi mārdan (spelt with t [13]) for perceive, notice or feel.

As the capital of the Empire of Trebisonta is was a melting pot of religions. In this way it would be a plausible location for a Zoroastrian book to be transferred from Persia to Europe.\nIn Fig. 8, we note that first two characters (with a + sign between them) appear as unsuccessful attempts to construct a ligature that does not exist in Pahlavi. The combination šr does not occur in initial position [13], where ligatures are mostly used in other parts of the VM. Only at the third attempt, the c-shape is correctly placed between the legs of the πshape that is usually expressing the sound š, but appears here to represent t. Although there is evidence elsewhere for this corruption, it is clearly a weak point of the interpretation. Also the split of the word into the parts treb and isonta casts doubts on the identification. The final n (figure 8 -shape) is less critical as it can be seen as a locative ending.

C.5.3), which is also used to denote the number 20 [13]. It may not seem straightforward to explain why the Pahlavi numeral is followed by a Roman IX (Pahlavi for number 9 would be 333 ), but it is not fully unexpected considering the organisation of the Pahlavi tens in steps of 20. In combination with the M in the preceding line leads to an year 1029 which can refer (based on the date in Sect. C.5.1) to the Christian (11th of November 1029), the Muslim (9th of September 1620) or the Zoroastrian era (19th of July, 18th of August, or 26th of December in 1660, resp., for the Kadmi, Shenshay or Fasli calendars [12]). However, from the dating of the velum to 14th century, neither of these dates appears likely. One possibility is to use the velum date to justify a lost Roman CD after the M at the end of the first line, such that a date of 1429 is implied, which is, however, highly speculative and contradicts the use of the Zoroastrian calendar for the month (Sect. C.5.1). Whether or not the space after the M contains indeed the minuscule letters cd cannot be decided from the available scans of the VM.\nIn the remainder of the line, we can identify in this line three attempts to write the word māh meaning moon or month. It consists of the letter m followed by a for the lengthening of the vowel and three strokes representing h. In the second occurrence of the word instead of a the letter o is written. The first two occurrences precede what appears to be the Roman numeral X. The third occurrence of māh follows a word with the possible spelling abha (Fig. 10). The reading is not clear, but the word may be Latin for the Zoroastrian day name xwar that occurs also in the third line, see Sect. C.5.1."

      "text" : "C.5.1 Date\nThe last line of the short text starts with the words aror dccy, see Fig. 11 which are, in contrast to most of the awkward Latin script on this page, unambiguously identifiable: The letters a, o and r can express the same Latin phonemes. The combination cc is a single letter which can refer to s or ı̄ and the last character is the ambiguous d -g-y letter mentioned in the introduction. The remaining letter π functions as a d. The Pahlavi correspondence is nevertheless more complicated, but suggests unambiguously the irregular transcription xwar day, which refers to the 11th day of the 10th month of the Zoroastrian calendar [13, p. 142]. After the mediocre attempts to give the date in Latin script in the previous line, it seemed necessary to return to the more familiar and less ambiguous Voynichese expression.\nC.5.2 Name\nObserving the descenders in the two initials in Fig. 12, we read two first letters of the words as g, as in the “title” of the folio f116v. The forth letter of the first word is, as in Figs. 7 and 8, an n, and the following letter an r, see Fig. 11. Considering the remaining characters as Latin letters, we can identify the string Galnr Gbrey. The Persian name Gōlnar refers to the flower of a pomegranate tree, and is used since medieval times, as obvious from its prevalence among the Parsis in India. Since Pahlavi uses essentially an abjad alphabet, it seems natural that the vowel between the Voynichese letters is omitted. Likewise, the second letter (a) does not stand for the vowel o, but expresses the lengthening of the sound.\nGbrey is a Pahlavi from of Gabr or Gabr̄ı, a term that was used for non-Muslim people in Iran. It seems to have been applied mainly to members of the Zoroastrian faith [21]. Considering that, when the VM was written, it would not have had the later pejorative meaning, it could be have well been used as a byname, and in fact has survived in several variants as a surname.\nGōlnar Gabr̄ı is likely to a female name, although also unisex names with the compound Gōl (rose) exist. If the scribe was indeed one of the rare female authors or writers from that time, then the preservation of the VM is indeed very interesting, even if we do not yet have much insight into the actual content of the manuscript."

      "text" : "As the least phrase of the colophon is particularly obscure, it is hard to resist reading the last words of the colophon, Fig. 13, as the German phrase So nimm gar mich. (Thus take even me), which appears to be out off context. However, the identification of the first letter as an descending s and of the similar letter in the middle as an r is not entirely inconsistent within the Pahlavi hypothesis, although we would expect the writer to return rather to the Voynich r in case of ambiguity.\nA slightly more likely alternative reading can be found by considering the phrase in Fig. 13 again as Pahlavi written in Latin letters. In this case we would ignore the first part\nIf we read the first letter as b, then we can identify the first word as band which refers to bastan and is occasionally written as bn [13], noting that the letter waw (o) and nun (n) are of identical shape in Pahlavi. The word bastan means tie or bind. Other options of starting with b would require the presence of a third letter.\nWe prefer to read the first letter as r (as in the third word in Fig. 13), for which MacKenzie [13] suggests the transliteration raw which then refers to raftan meaning go or move. The following words can be transcribed [13] as nim[ay ] (nimudan) meaning guard, gōr for nature (or jewel) and mizd which can mean reward.\nAlthough the rough translation of the phrase as “Go, guard nature’s reward!” appears utterly anachronistic, it would be within context and could be considered as a final message of the author to posterity. Nevertheless, as many of our conclusions are rather speculative, this translation is even more so."

      "heading" : "C.6 Drawings",
      "text" : "The velum of the last page has tear that apparently has been mended before the use of the page. The scribe used the large part right of the tear for text of the colophon, and decorated the margin left of the tear by a few small drawings, see Fig. 14.\nThe top picture (Fig. 14 left) has a conspicuous likeness to a chicken corpse. The middle picture represents a billy goat or a similar animal. The bottom pictures is a female nude in the style of the figures in the “nudes” pages (f75r – f84v). It would be strange to assume that it represents the author.\nAlthough we are unable to give a interpretation of the pictures here, we note the letters in the top figure (Fig. 14 left). Although the first letter as a similarity with F, we should stay with the earlier reading of the character as r, which is followed by a (or o) and n (figure-8 shape). The word rān means fight [13], but our confidence in this reading is low.\nC.7 Illegible characters on right margin\nOne of the most important information to obtain from a colophon would be the year of the production of the document. We have touched upon this question above, but are unable to give a definite answer. Fig. 15 shows the ending of the first line of the colophon and the right margin of the page next to the colophon. It is possible that characters after the letter M are lost, although they may become visible in a multi-spectral analysis of the velum.\nIn the left middle and lower part of Fig. 15 a few blurred characters (such as a question mark) can be seen, but due to the difference in the strokes and unrelatedness to the main part of the colophon, they should be considered as later additions."

      "text" : "All of the presented results from our reading of the colophon are to a larger or lesser extent speculative, but at least we should admit that the combined evidence provided here shows that the text on f116v indeed represents a colophon. Further analysis of the text as well as of the material document may lead to more reliable information about the manuscript.\nColophons occur already on Ancient Near East clay tablets, but in the case of the VM, the addition of a colophon appears as an ineffectual attempt to adopt a Western custom, which may have be seen as suboptimal when taken, but we can now appreciate it as potentially very useful."

    "abstractText" : "The late medieval Voynich Manuscript (VM) has resisted decryption and was considered a meaningless hoax or an unsolvable cipher. Here, we provide evidence that the VM is written in natural language by establishing a relation of the Voynich alphabet and the Iranian Pahlavi script. Many of the Voynich characters are upside-down versions of their Pahlavi counterparts, which may be an effect of different writing directions. Other Voynich letters can be explained as ligatures or departures from Pahlavi with the intent to cope with known problems due to the stupendous ambiguity of Pahlavi text. While a translation of the VM text is not attempted here, we can confirm the Voynich-Pahlavi relation at the character level by the transcription of many words from the VM illustrations and from parts of the main text. Many of the transcribed words can be identified as terms from Zoroastrian cosmology which is in line with the use of Pahlavi script in Zoroastrian communities from medieval times. 1 Why is Voynichese difficult? All writing systems in the world [8, 5] require some effort in acquisition and use. While for some groups of languages, difficulty and differences may be comparatively small [17], in others the complexity of the script can appear forbidding for all but a minority of scribes. Religious observance, for example, may require the adherents to continue using a script or language that no longer adapts to its language environment and that may thus tend to become ambiguous or incomprehensible. In order to retain a unique pronunciation and, supported by extensive commentaries, continuing understandability, glyphs (diacritics) from were added to letters to distinguish them, or additional letters (matres lectionis) were inserted to represent sounds (such as vowels in the consonant-based (abjad) scripts. However, such additional efforts may not be considered necessary, if the oral tradition in the community is sufficiently strong, such that the texts do not have to be extracted from the writing itself, but are rather remembered while being read. If the Voynich Manuscript (VM, MS 408 in the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University) derives from such a tradition, the difficulty in reading it may be understandable. 1 ar X iv :1 70 9. 01 63 4v 1 [ cs .C L ] 6 S ep 2 01 7 The Voynich Manuscript (VM, MS 408 in the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University) which is written on more than 200 vellum pages has been dated between 1404 and 1438 (University of Arizona, 2011), but its history is largely unknown until the discovery by the bookseller Voynich in 1912. Apart from a few cautious attempts, such as Ref. [3], so far little progress has been achieved in deciphering the VM nor even a decision was reached whether the VM has any meaningful content at all. Before we Our hypothesis that the VM is written in natural language, is to be evidenced by showing that the script used in the VM is directly related to Pahlavi, a writing system that was in use for several Iranian languages from before the current era at least until 900 [9]. Pahlavi is a particular case of a language that is notoriously difficult to read. It was used in medieval scriptures, commentaries, and a few other texts [2] related to Zoroastrianism, the pre-Islamic religion of Persia. Over the few centuries of the language evolution, many Pahlavi letters have coalesced, e.g. for the phonemes d, g, j, and y, only a single letters is retained in Pahlavi. Moreover, letters are usually joined in Pahlavi script and can appear thus similar to other letters: E.g., in addition to its proper meaning, a letter can be indistinguishable from as much a sixteen different phoneme or letter combinations [11]. In some words, corrupted forms of letters have become a standard that is accepted to various degrees by the scribes. In addition to Persian words, Pahlavi contains also a large number of heterograms, i.e. around a thousand, partially very common words of Aramaic origin that are meant to be read in Persian (like the Latin abbreviation i.e. is read in English as that is). Finally, as for many other ancient texts, material decay, language drift, scribe errors, unfamiliarity with the original cultural context, and, possibly, the need of the writers to hide the content from contemporary hostility, also contribute to the difficulty of reading the text. Concerning recent work on the VM, statistical approaches [1, 10, 14] that search for nonrandom features in data may be bound to fail if the target is quite random to begin with. The standard Voynich character set (EVA) [7] is not too helpful either, because it is unrelated to the phonemics, it breaks some of the letters into smaller parts, and fails to identify ligatures, all of which may further reduce the strength of the statistical analysis, cf. [19, 20, 18, 10]. In addition, the extensive 19th century literature dedicated to religious writing, see e.g. [15] was difficult to access until scanned copies became available online recently, and, finally, it may be construed that our academic habits thwart the systematic study of matters as obscure as the VM. The VM which is written on over 200 vellum pages has been dated between 1404 and 1438 (University of Arizona, 2011), but its history is largely unknown until the discovery by the bookseller Voynich in 1912. Apart from a few cautious attempts such as Ref. [3], so far no progress has been achieved in deciphering the VM nor even a decision was reached whether the VM has any meaningful content at all [18]. The present paper aims at providing evidence for the hypothesis that the VM is a readable text with an interest in itself. Our approach consists in establishing a relation between the Voynich and Pahlavi scripts (see Section 2). It will also become clear that only within a cooperation among experts in Pahlavi philology, Zoroastrianism, history of medicine, botany, astronomy and palaeography, the content of the VM can be revealed. We will provide evidence for the proposed relation between the two alphabets by a number",
