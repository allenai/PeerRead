Therefore, it is one of the key steps to recover the dropped pronouns for elliptical sentence completion and natural language understanding for machines. Recently, recovering the dropped pronouns has been verified to be effective for statistical machine translation [1].\nTo address the dropped pronoun recovery problem, [2] manually annotated dropped pronouns in Chinese newswire text. [3] utilized a maximum entropy (ME) classifier to recover dropped pronoun from Chinese text messages. However, the major drawbacks of the previous work are two-fold. First, manually annotating the dropped pronouns is a labor intensive work. Second, the applying of the ME classifier also dependents on empirically selecting features, which is also called the feature engineering.\nIn this study, we proposed a neural recovery machine (NRM) to recover the dropped pronouns on two heterogeneous datasets so that to avoid the nontrivial feature engineering process. The contributions of this paper include the following:\n• To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a neural network framework,\nwhich avoids the empirical feature engineering process, to recover Chinese dropped pronouns.\n• The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approach signifi-\ncantly on two heterogeneous datasets, which also demonstrate the domain adaption of the NRM.\n• By integrating the dropped pronouns into the anaphoric zero pronouns,\nwe verified that the proposed NRM can further improve the performance of zero pronoun resolution task."

We use x, Wi and bi to represent the continuous representation of the input, the weight matrix and bias of the i-th layer respectively. Here, the continuous representation of the\ninput is obtained by concatenating the word embedding, which is pre-trained as described in Section 4.1, in a specific window in a sentence. We use the ReLU as the activation function, which is described in Equation (1).\nfi = ReLU(Wix+ bi) (1)\nHere, we take rect() as the ReLU() and z = Wix+ bi. The activation function can be represented as Equation (2).\nrect(z) = max(z, 0) (2)\nAs shown in Figure 1, the dropped pronoun recovery includes 2 steps. The first step is to identify the dropped position. Hence, for each of the dropped hypothesis, the dropped position identification is transformed to a binary classification task. The second step is to generate the explicit pronouns for the fixed dropped position. It therefore can be seen as a multi-classification task. According to the statistics of the annotated data which is shown in Table 4, the dropped pronoun generation is transformed to a 14-category and a 10-category classification task on the OntoNote 4.0 and Baidu Zhidao datasets, respectively. We thus utilize a softmax function for the output layer.

This commonly occurs with nouns that represent organizations. An organization can be a referent that is referred by a singular or a plural. For example, “公司(company)” can be the company itself as one unit or the people in the company, in which case the corresponding pronouns would be “它(it)” and “他们(they)”, respectively. Hence, this can be viewed as an ambiguity which is intricate to model. The following two sentences are examples to show the above cases.

Example (8) shows the above case.\nIn example (8), the antecedent of the dropped pronoun “她(She)” is absent on context. Other personal pronouns can also be placed in the position of the DP and are sensible both on syntactic and semantic.

For training and testing, they encoded the surface node into two categories, EC and NEC (non-EC). Hence, the recovery is actually a binary classification process. However, the major drawback of this study is the overlook of structure and position information. [11] presented a simple and highly effective EC recovery approach, which can fully integrate with state-of-the-art parser. The basic assumption is that the state-splitting of the parsing model will enable it to learn where to expect ECs to be inserted into the test sentences. Experimental results indicated their superiority. [12] described a novel approach to detecting ECs that represented in dependency parse trees. They first converted the phrase structure into dependency structure. The lexical and hierarchical features were then exploited for predicting both the position and type of ECs. [13] explored a clause-level hybrid approach, which integrated the linear tagging and structure parsing information, to recovering ECs in Chinese. They employed a higher level framework, semantic role labeling, to model the hybrid features. Meanwhile, a comma disambiguation approach is also utilized to improve the performance of syntactic parsing and further affect the final results on EC recovery. [14] proposed a structure learning based approach to recovering ECs for machine translation (MT) task. 3 major categories of features, lexical feature, syntactic feature and EC-specific feature, were taken into consideration.

They exploited two categories of features which can be summarized to intra- and inter-sentence features, including the position of the gap, syntactic roles, comma, clause, and the distances of zero pronouns and their antecedents in sentences. Finally, a J48 decision tree model was employed to integrate these features for zero pronoun resolution. [16] proposed a unified tree kernel based framework for Chinese zero pronoun resolution. The main contribution of this study focused on measuring the similarity between zero pronouns and their antecedents on syntactic tree structure. The task, then converted to classify the pair of zero pronoun and antecedent to anaphoric zero pronoun (AZP) and non-AZP by using the SVM classifier. [17] further extended [15]’s work by involving more features and exploiting the co-reference links between zero pronoun and antecedent into a SVMlight classifier. Experimental results indicated that the extended approach outperformed the two state-of-the-art approaches [16, 15] significantly.\nA zero pronoun resolution task was also carried out on other pro-drop languages like Japanese and Korean. [18] implemented the zero pronoun resolution task in a semantic role labeling framework. They first transformed the dependency parsing trees of sentences into syntactic patterns. A hybrid set of features, including lexical, grammatical, semantic and heuristic, as well as the syntactic patterns were uniquely integrated into the learning model.

They then proposed an example based log-linear model by inte-\ngrating intra- and inter-sentence features for Japanese zero pronoun resolution.

Further, they analyzed the similar pro-drop phenomenon among seven languages, such as English, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Cantonese, and Japanese. [21] presented a two step approach, which included the clause- and phrase-level antecedent detection, to resolving zero pronouns in Korean by reducing the number of candidate antecedents with syntactic structure information. [22] proposed an unsupervised approach for Chinese zero pronouns resolution with language independent features. They first predicted ten overt pronouns and then ranked the candidate antecedents. The integer linear programming approach was then employed to enhance the performance of the ranking model. They [9] further proposed an end-to-end unsupervised probabilistic model for Chinese zero pronoun resolution task. They used a salience model to capture discourse information.

Further experiment results of Chinese zero pronoun (ZP) resolution show that the performance of ZP resolution can also be improved by recovering the ZPs to DPs.",
