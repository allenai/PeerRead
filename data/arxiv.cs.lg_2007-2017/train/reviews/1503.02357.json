{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Mar-2015", "title": "Context-Dependent Translation Selection Using Convolutional Neural Network", "abstract": "We propose a novel method for translation selection in statistical machine translation, in which a convolutional neural network is employed to judge the similarity between a phrase pair in two languages. The specifically designed convolutional architecture encodes not only the semantic similarity of the translation pair, but also the context containing the phrase in the source language. Therefore, our approach is able to capture context-dependent semantic similarities of translation pairs. We adopt a curriculum learning strategy to train the model: we classify the training examples into easy, medium, and difficult categories, and gradually build the ability of representing phrase and sentence level context by using training examples from easy to difficult. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline system by up to 1.4 BLEU points.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Mar 2015 02:16:19 GMT  (548kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02357v1", "9 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 01:07:40 GMT  (553kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02357v2", "Short version is accepted by ACL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["baotian hu", "zhaopeng tu", "zhengdong lu", "hang li", "qingcai chen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.02357"}
