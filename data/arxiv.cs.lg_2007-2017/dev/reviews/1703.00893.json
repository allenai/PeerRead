Recent work in theoretical computer science has shown that, in appropriate distributional models, it is possible to robustly estimate the mean and covariance with polynomial time algorithms that can tolerate a constant fraction of corruptions, independent of the dimension. However, the sample and time complexity of these algorithms is prohibitively large for high-dimensional applications. In this work, we address both of these issues by establishing sample complexity bounds that are optimal, up to logarithmic factors, as well as giving various refinements that allow the algorithms to tolerate a much larger fraction of corruptions. Finally, we show on both synthetic and real data that our algorithms have state-of-the-art performance and suddenly make high-dimensional robust estimation a realistic possibility.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 18:50:33 GMT  (1689kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00893v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS cs.IT math.IT stat.ML", "authors": ["ilias diakonikolas", "gautam kamath", "daniel m kane", "jerry li 0001", "ankur moitra", "alistair stewart"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.00893"}
