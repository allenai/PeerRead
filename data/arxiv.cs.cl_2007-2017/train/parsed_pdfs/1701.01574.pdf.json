      "text" : "Representing meanings of words by embedding them into a high dimensional vector space, so called word embedding, is a useful technique in natural language processing. An intuitive idea is to encode one word into a single vector, which contains the semantic information of the word in corpus (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010).\nThere is a consensus that natural languages always include lots of polysemous words. For example, when the word star appears together with words like planet, satellite, it may roughly denote a kind of celestial body; when star appears with words like movie, song, drama, it may stand for a famous person. For most cases, we human beings can easily point out which sense a word belongs to based on its context. Considering the polysemous words, some previous approaches have learned multiple embeddings for a word, discriminating different senses by their context, related syntax and topics (Reisinger and Mooney, 2010; Huang et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014; Pina and Johansson, 2014; Neelakantan et al., 2015; Cheng and Kartsaklis, 2015; Liu et al., 2015). The authors also provided methods to disambiguate among the multiple representations. Li and Jurafsky (2015) have demonstrated that multi-sense word embeddings could be helpful to improve the performance on many NLP and NLU tasks.\nHowever, this leads to another problem. It’s much more difficult for computer than human beings to detect whether two appearances of a same word stand for the same sense. Moreover, the contexts may be totally different even if these appearances belong to the same meaning based on human judgement. Previous multi-sense word embedding approaches often tend to embed a word in such situation into more than one vector by mistake (actually, they have the same meaning and should be embedded into only one vector). Consider three different representations of word bear learnt by the method introduced by Neelakantan et al. (2015), which are shown by their nearest neighbors in the vector space MSSG-50d.\n• emerald, bears, three-toed, snake, periwinkle, ruffed, hoopoe, distinctive, unmistakable\nThis work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

We could infer that the first two representations have the same meaning that points to the animal bear, and the third representation has different meaning. We call such different learnt representations of a word with the same meaning (e.g. the first two representations of word bear shown above) pseudo multi-sense, where we judge whether senses are pseudo multi-sense by comparing their domains.\nGiven the word embeddings, which have multiple vectors for each polysemous word, we introduce an algorithm based on domains and semantic relations to detect pseudo multi-sense, since word representations which stand for the same meaning would have the same hypernym and belong to the same domain. Then we try to eliminate the effect of pseudo multi-sense by training a global transition matrix which projects the original word vectors into a new vector space based on the detected pseudo multi-sense pairs, minimizing the distance between pseudo multi-sense pairs in the vector space while keeping the spatial relation of other pairs. We propose the algorithm in Section 3 and evaluate it in Section 4.\nObviously, detecting and diminishing pseudo multi-sense would make word sense representations, which can be processed by computer, closer to human thinking. We also suggest this approach can improve the performance on real world NLU tasks by evaluating the algorithm on the analogy test dataset introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013a), and also on WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001) and SCWS (Huang et al., 2012) dataset which include human judgements on similarity between pairs of words."

What’s more, hierarchical softmax by Morin and Bengio (2005), noise contrastive estimation by Mnih and Kavukcuoglu (2013) and negative sampling by Mikolov et al.

(2012) proposed a method to generate the context embeddings in the following way. Firstly, they generate single-sense word embeddings and compute out the context embeddings. Then they cluster the context embeddings, and the result are used to relabel each occurrence of each word in the corpus. Thirdly, the model they proposed is applied to the labeled corpus to generate the multi-sense embeddings. Chen et al. (2014) took external knowledge base into consideration and built a model to learn a separate vector for each sense pre-defined by WordNet (Miller, 1995). Neelakantan et al. (2015) improved multi-sense word embedding model by dropping the assumption that each word should have the same number of senses, and proposed a non-parametric model to automatically discover a varying number of senses per word type. Cheng and Kartsaklis (2015) proposed a syntax-aware approach for multi-sense word embeddings."

Our vector space projection algorithm is very similar to this."

      "text" : "Given a word and its context, we human beings can easily determine the domains this word belongs to. WordNet makes it convenient for users to get the domains of all synsets of a word. To determine the domain of a sense given the multi-sense word embeddings, we can intuitively define the probability that the kth sense of word w belongs to domain d as\nPD(w, k, d) ∝ ∑\nw′∈NN(w,k)\nD(p(w′), d) (1)\nwhere NN(w, k) is the nearest neighbors of the kth sense of word w in the given word embeddings, p(w′) is the protocol representation of word w′ (e.g. when w′ is star s1, p(w′) would be star), D(p(w′), d) is the sum probability that domain d appears in all synsets of p(w′) in WordNet provided by Extended WordNet Domain. Then we can compute the domain similarity between the kth and the lth sense of word w by\nSimD(w, k, l) = 1\nn |TopN(PD, w, k, n) ∩ TopN(PD, w, l, n)| (2)\nwhere TopN(P,w, k, n) is the set of x that P (w, k, x) ranks top n in decreasing order (in our experiments, n = 5)."

      "text" : "However, in the knowledge base we applied, the domain knowledge is sometimes not enough for dectecting pseudo multi-sense, especially for some abstract words. For example, it’s hard to specify which domain the word extract belongs to. What’s more, based on González et al. (2012), the Extended WordNet Domain cannot reach the precision of 100%. So we tend to apply semantic hierarchy, particularly hypernymy relations, to help improve our pseudo multi-sense detecting as supplement, since hypernymy somehow contains some domain information. With WordNet, we can also get the semantic relations (e.g. hypernymy, hyponymy, synonymy) of synsets. With the consideration of the DAG structure of semantic relations, for hypernyms of a specific word, the nearer the hypernym, the more information it contains. So we penalize the far hypernyms, like whole, entity, thing, which cover a large amount of words as their hyponyms. Similar to the definition of PD(w, k, t), we can define the probability that the kth sense of word w has the hypernym h, where h is a synset in WordNet, as\nPH(w, k, h) ∝ 1\nd(w, h)\n∑\nw′∈NN(w,k)\nH(p(w′), h) · 1\nd(p(w′), h) (3)\nwhere d(w, h) = minsw∈Synsets(w) dis(sw, h), dis(x, y) is the distance between two synsets x and y in WordNet, H(p(w′), h) is the frequency that the synset h appears as a hypernym of a synset of p(w′) in WordNet. In particular, if h is not a hypernym of w in WordNet, PH(w, k, h) = 0.\nWe then compute the semantic hierarchical similarity between the kth and the lth sense of word w by\nSimH(w, k, l) = 1\nn |TopN(PH , w, k, n) ∩ TopN(PH , w, l, n)| (4)\nWith the definition of domain similarity and semantic hierarchical similarity, we can compute the similarity between the kth and the lth sense of word w by\nSim(w, k, l) = SimD(w, k, l) + SimH(w, k, l) (5)\nWhen Sim(w, k, l) > λ, where λ is a hyper-parameter (λ = 1 in our experiments), we consider the kth and the lth sense of word w have the same meaning. In other words, we are able to detect pseudo multi-sense pair (wk, wl) based on Sim(w, k, l), which is called pseudo multi-sense detection."

Thus, we can find a representative vector for the group. Let vs(w, ki) be the corresponding vectors of wki , and vr(G) be the representative vector for the group G. Such vector vr(G) can be randomly chosen from {vs(w, k1), vs(w, k2), ..., vs(w, kn)}, or simply the mean vector of them. Other methods to compute vr(G) are also worth trying if reasonable.\nInspired by Mikolov et al. (2013b), we assume there is a transition matrix, by which for all pseudo multi-sense group G, ∀wki ∈ G, vwki can be projected to vr(G). The experiments shown in Section 4 supported our assumption. In other words, we suggest that there exists a global matrix Φ, for any given pseudo multi-sense group G = {wk1 , wk2 , ..., wkn} and its representative vector vr(G), we have\nvr(G) = Φ ∗ vs(w, ki),∀wki ∈ G,∀G (6)\nStochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a stochastic approximation of the gradient descent optimization method for minimizing an objective function written as a sum of differentiable functions by iteration. In order to obtain a consistent Φ for the projection of all pseudo multi-sense group, we can learn an approximate Φ with SGD for optimization. Then we use the obtained Φ to project existing word embeddings, and thus we can get a new vector space in which pseudo multi-sense has been eliminated compared to the original space."

For the convenience of view, we only focus on the semantic relation in the qualitative evaluation part. We extracted the most probable hypernym for each sense of some sample words by Eq(4), using the synset semantic relations provided by WordNet (Miller, 1995). If different representations of one word have the same hypernym, we consider them as pseudo multi-sense.\nIn Table 1, we show the nearest neighbors for each sense of each sample word with multiple word embeddings and our result of pseudo multi-sense detecting. For most of the representations, according to their nearest neighbors, we got reasonable hypernyms. However, there are also some unexpected cases from the result based on the word vectors released by Huang et al. (2012), while no such cases are found in the vectors released by Neelakantan et al. (2015). For example, we got [whole.n.02] as the hypernym of the three sample words (which seems too general since whole can be the hypernym of nearly all entities), and [person.n.01] as a hypernym of ROCK (which seems not very reasonable according to the nearest neighbors). By intuition, we suggest that is because of the quality of the word embeddings. Possibly, the level of confidence to extract domains and hypernyms for each sense could be a metric for evaluating the quality of word embeddings. From this point of view, the word embeddings released by Neelakantan et al. (2015) are also with higher quality."

Based on such relationship, we conduct the following experiment, which shows that our method is able to improve the quality of multi-sense word embeddings.\nIn order to compare the quality of different versions of word vectors, our experiment runs on the Semantic-Syntactic Word Relationship dataset, which contains five types of semantic questions and nine types of syntactic questions, as shown in Table 4, including 19544 such quadruples totally.\nFor each quadruple in the test dataset, we mark it as w1, w2, w3, w4. The relationship between w1 and w2 is similar to that between w3 and w4. In single-sense word embeddings, we just need to check whether v(w4) is the most similar vector to v(w1) − v(w2) + v(w3) among all the vectors, and apply the same procedure for w1, w2, w3. For multi-sense word embeddings, we check whether there is a combination of senses {k1, k2, k3, k4} so that vs(w4, k4) is the most similar vector to vs(w1, k1)−v(w2, k2)+v(w3, k3), where vs(w, k) is the vector of word w’s kth sense. What’s more, since the equivalence of the two pairs, we also check by such procedure for vs(w1, k1), vs(w2, k2), vs(w3, k3). For every quadruple, once one of the requirements above is satisfied, we treat it as correct. We report the accuracy for each multi-sense vector space in Table 5.\nOverall, our detection and elimination of pseudo multi-sense on word embeddings reach higher performance on the nearest neighbor, word similarity and analogy task."

The evaluation of our pseudo multi-sense eliminated vector showed that detecting and eliminating pseudo multi-sense significantly improved the ability for each vector in the word embeddings to represent for an exact meaning. We suggest that the following research directions could be considered.\n• For the detection of pseudo multi-sense, taking syntactic information and other information we have or we can extract from corpus into account is a reasonable idea to improve the performance.\n• Involve the pseudo multi-sense detection and elimination into the neural network structure, so that the learnt word embeddings could have higher quality than those learnt by existing methods without consideration of pseudo multi-sense.\n• Though we have gained an improvement on experiments, we don’t have a deep understanding about the reason that why elimination of pseudo multi-sense works well and why pseudo multi-sense cases are ubiquitous in all kinds of word embeddings. In future work, we could focus on finding a reasonable explanation of the fact."

In this paper, we introduce the concept of pseudo multi-sense, and then propose an algorithm to detect such cases. With the consideration of the detected pseudo multi-sense cases, we try to refine the existing word embeddings to eliminate the influence of pseudo multi-sense. Moreover, we apply our algorithm on previous released multi-sense word embeddings and tested it on artificial word similarity tasks and the analogy task. The result of the experiments shows that diminishing pseudo multi-sense can improve the quality of word representations.
