{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Nov-2014", "title": "Existential Rule Languages with Finite Chase: Complexity and Expressiveness", "abstract": "Finite chase, or alternatively chase termination, is an important condition to ensure the decidability of existential rule languages. In the past few years, a number of rule languages with finite chase have been studied. In this work, we propose a novel approach for classifying the rule languages with finite chase. Using this approach, a family of decidable rule languages, which extend the existing languages with the finite chase property, are naturally defined. We then study the complexity of these languages. Although all of them are tractable for data complexity, we show that their combined complexity can be arbitrarily high. Furthermore, we prove that all the rule languages with finite chase that extend the weakly acyclic language are of the same expressiveness as the weakly acyclic one, while rule languages with higher combined complexity are in general more succinct than those with lower combined complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Nov 2014 13:37:22 GMT  (27kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5220v1", "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI 2015"], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Nov 2014 05:36:49 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5220v2", "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI 2015"], ["v3", "Thu, 8 Jan 2015 22:53:11 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5220v3", "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB cs.LO", "authors": ["heng zhang", "yan zhang", "jia-huai you"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.5220"}
