We motivate the choice of our convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a significant margin.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper proposes the graph convolutional networks, motivated from approximating graph convolutions.

Thanks a lot for pointing out the references on iterative classification. ICA is indeed a powerful baseline that we have not considered previously and it compares favorably against some of the other baselines. We have put the code to reproduce the ICA baseline experiments on Github: ", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "14 Jan 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Simple and reasonable approach", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper develops a simple and reasonable algorithm for graph node prediction/classification. The formulations are very intuitive and lead to a simple CNN based training and can easily leverage existing GPU speedups. \n\nExperiments are thorough and compare with many reasonable baselines on large and real benchmark datasets. Although, I am not quite aware of the literature on other methods and there may be similar alternatives as link and node prediction is an old problem. I still think the approach is quite simple and reasonably supported by good evaluations.

The proposed algorithm has a limited complexity and it is shown to scale well on a large dataset. The comparison with baselines on different datasets show a clear jump of performance with the proposed method.\n\nThe paper is technically fine and clear, the algorithm seems to scale well, and the results on the different datasets compare very favorably with the different baselines. The algorithm is simple and training seems easy. Concerning the originality, the proposed algorithm is a simple adaptation of graph convolutional networks (ref Defferrard 2016 in the paper) to a semi-supervised transductive setting. This is clearly mentioned in the paper, but the authors could better highlight the differences and novelty wrt this reference paper. Also, there is no comparison with the family of iterative classifiers, which usually compare favorably, both in performance and training time, with regularization based approaches, although they are mostly used in inductive settings. Below are some references for this family of methods.\n\nThe authors mention that more complex filters could be learned by stacking layers but they limit their architecture to one hidden layer. They should comment on the interest of using more layers for graph classification.\n\n\nSome references on iterative classification Qing Lu and Lise Getoor. 2003. Link-based classification.
