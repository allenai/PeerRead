INTRODUCTION\nIntrinsic dimensionality (ID) of data is a key priori knowledge in pattern recognition and statistics, such as time series analysis, classification and neural networks, to improve their performance. In time series analysis [1], the domain of attraction of a nonlinear dynamic system has a very complex geometric structure, and study on the geometry of the attraction domain is closely related to the fractal geometry. Fractal dimension is an important tool to characterize certain geometric properties of complex sets. In neural network design [2], the number of hidden units in the encoding middle layer should be chosen according to the ID of data. In classification tasks [3], in order to balance the generalization ability and the empirical risk value, the complexity of the function should also be related to the ID of data.\nM. Fan and B. Zhang are with LSEC and the Institute of Applied Mathematics, AMSS, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China (email: fanmingyu@amss.ac.cn, b.zhang@amt.ac.cn)\nN. Gu and H. Qiao are with the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China (email: gunannan@gmail.com, hong.qiao@ia.ac.cn)\nCorresponding author: Bo Zhang\nRecently, manifold learning, an important approach for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, has drawn great interests. Important manifold learning algorithms include isometric feature mapping (Isomap) [4], locally linear embedding (LLE) [5] and Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) [6]. They all assume data to distribute on an intrinsically lowdimensional sub-manifold [7] and reduce the dimensionality of data by investigating the intrinsic structure of data. However, all manifold learning algorithms require the ID of data as a key parameter for implementation.\nPrevious ID estimation methods can be categorized mainly into three groups: projection approach, geometric approach and probabilistic approach. The projection approach [9]–[11] finds ID by checking up the lowdimensional embedding of data. The geometric method [22] finds ID by investigating the intrinsic geometric structure of data. The probabilistic technique [19] builds estimators by making distribution assumptions on data. These approaches will be briefly introduced in Section II.\nIn this paper, we propose a new PCA-based method for ID estimation which is called the C-PCA method. The proposed method first finds a minimal cover of the data set, and each subset in the cover is considered as a small subregion of the data manifold. Then, on each subset, a revised PCA procedure is applied to examine the local structure. The revised PCA method can filter out noise in data and leads to a stable and convergent ID estimation with the increase of the subregion size, as shown by the experimental results. This is an advantage over the traditional PCA method which is very sensitive to noise, outliers and the choice of the subregion size. Further analysis shows that the revised PCA procedure can efficiently reduce the running time complexity and utilize all data samples for ID estimation. We should remark that our ID estimation method is also applicable to incremental learning for consecutive data. Our method is compared with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method [19], the manifold adaptive method (which is referred to as the k-k/2 NN method in this paper) [18] and the k-nearest neighbor graph (kNNG) method [26], [27] through experiments.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In\n2 Section II, previous ID estimation methods are briefly reviewed. In Section III, the new ID estimation method (C-PCA) is introduced. In Section IV, experiments are conducted on synthetic and real world data sets to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Conclusion is made in Section V."

      "heading" : "II. PREVIOUS ALGORITHMS ON ID ESTIMATION",
      "text" : "Previously, there are mainly three approaches to estimate the ID of data: projection, geometric and probabilistic approaches.\nThe projection approach first projects data into a low-dimensional space and then determine the ID by verifying the low-dimensional representation of data. PCA is a classical projection method which finds ID by counting the number of significant eigenvalues. However, the traditional PCA only works on data lying in a linear subspace but becomes ineffective when data distribute on a nonlinear manifold. To overcome this limitation, localPCA [9] and OTPMs PCA [10] have been proposed and can discover the ID of data lying on nonlinear manifolds by performing the PCA method locally. The Isomap algorithm yields ID of data by inspecting the elbow of residual variance curve [4]. Cheng et al. gave an efficient procedure to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors in PCA [24].\nGeometric approaches make use of the geometric structure of data to build ID estimators. Fractal-based methods have been well developed and used in time series analysis. For example, the correlation dimension (a kind of fractal dimensions) was used in [13] to estimate the ID, whilst the method of packing numbers was proposed in [14] to find the ID. Other fractalbased methods include the kernel correlation method [23] and the quantization estimator [21]. A good survey on fractal-based methods can be found in [22]. There are also many methods based on techniques from computational geometry. Lin [15] and Cheng [25] suggested to construct simplices to find the ID, while the nearest neighbor approach uses the distances between data points with their nearest neighbors to build ID estimators such as the estimator proposed by Pettis et al. [29], the kNNG method [26], [27] and the incising ball method [17]. A comparison of the local-PCA method with that introduced by Pettis et al. was made in [16].\nProbabilistic methods are based on probabilistic assumptions of data and have been tested on various data sets with stable performance. The MLE-method [19] is a representative method of this approach, whose final global estimator is given by averaging the local\nestimators:\nd̂k(xi) =\n\n\n1\nk − 1\nk−1 ∑\nj=1\nlog Tk(xi)\nTj(xi)\n\n\n−1\n, for i = 1, · · · , N,\nwhere Tk(xi) is the distance between xi and its k-th nearest neighbor. MacKay and Ghahramani [20] pointed out that compared with averaging the local estimators directly, it is more sensible to average their inverses d̂−1k (xi), i = 1, · · · , N for the maximum likelihood purpose. The recommended final estimator is\nd̂−1k = 1\nN\nN ∑\ni=1\nd̂−1k (xi),\nwhere dk is the estimated ID corresponding to the neighborhood size k.\nIII. ID ESTIMATION USING PCA WITH COVER SETS: C-PCA\nBasically, there are two kinds of definitions of ID that are commonly used. One is based on the fractal dimension, such as the Hausdorff dimension and the packing dimension that are usually real positive numbers. The other kind of definition is based on the embedding manifold whose ID is always an integer.\nDefinition 3.1 (Embedding manifold and dimension): Let d < D and let Ω be a compact open set in Rd. Assume that span{Ω − ∫\nΩ dµ} = Rd and φ : Ω → RD\nis a smooth function. The set X = φ(Ω) is called an embedding manifold with d its embedding dimension.\nMore and more real world data are proved to have nonlinear intrinsic structures and may possibly distribute on nonlinear embedding manifolds [7]. Therefore, estimation of embedding ID of data becomes an important problem [17]. In this paper, we focus on estimation of embedding dimensions."

Let X = [x1, · · · , xN ] and x̄ = 1N ∑N i=1 xi. The covariance matrix of X is given by\nC = 1\nN\nN ∑\ni=1\n(xi − x̄)(xi − x̄) T .\nSince C is a positive semi-definite matrix, we can assume that λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λN ≥ 0 are the eigenvalues of C with ν1, · · · , νN the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors, respectively. The eigen-decomposition of\n3 matrix C is denoted as C = ΓDΓT , where D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = λi and Γ = [ν1, · · · , νN ]. The eigenvector νi is the i-th principal direction (PD) and, for any variable x, yi = νix is defined as the i-th principal component (PC). By the definition, we have the variance var(yi) = λi and the covariance cov(yi, yj) = 0.\nIf the data set X distributes on a linear subspace, then the d primary PDs should be able to span the subspace and the corresponding PCs can account for most of the variations contained in X . On the other hand, the variance of PCs on νd+1, · · · , νN (i.e., the PDs which are orthogonal to the linear subspace of dimension d) will be trivial. The most commonly-used criterions for ID estimation with the PCA method are\nmin i=1,··· ,d (var(yi))\nmax j=d+1,··· ,N\n(var(yj)) > α ≫ 1 (1)\nand the percentage of the accounted variance ∑d\ni=1 var(yi) ∑N\ni=1 var(yi) > β, 0 < β < 1.

      "heading" : "B. Filtering out the noise of data",
      "text" : "There are two challenges for PCA-based ID estimation methods. The first one is how to filter out the noise in data, while the second one is how to choose the size of subregions on the manifold. Previously, the ID estimation of data obtained with PCA-based methods always increases with the size of subregions so the methods can not converge to give a stable ID estimation. In order to address these two limitations, we propose the following noise filtering procedure which can efficiently filter out the noise in data and make PCA-based methods to converge.\nConsider the effect of additive white noise µ in data with E(µ) = 0 and var(µ) = σ2. The covariance matrix of the noise corrupted data is given by\nC ′ = var(X + µ) = C + σ2I,\nwhere C is the covariance matrix of the data X . It can be seen that the PDs of C ′ are identical to those of C and the eigenvalues of C ′ are λ′i = λi + σ\n2. If σ is relatively large, then the ID criterions (1) and (2) will be ineffective.\nThe variance of data projections on the PDs that are orthogonal to the intrinsic embedding subspace is very small, and the most part of the variance is produced by\nnoise. Therefore, it is possible to calculate the variance of noise by projecting data on the orthogonal PDs. Given a real number P which is very close to 1 (P is taken to be 0.95 in this paper), the noise part of data is determined by ∑r−1\ni=1 var(yi) ∑N\ni=1 var(yi) < P and\n∑r i=1 var(yi) ∑N i=1 var(yi) > P.\nThus, the variance of noise contained in data can be estimated as\nσ̂2 = 1\nN − r + 1\nN ∑\ni=r\nvar(yi). (3)\nOur new ID estimation criterions make use of the updated variance on PDs: var(yi) = λi − σ̂2.\nRemark 3.1: Noise is typically different from outliers. Noise affects every data points independently, while outliers are referred to data points that are at least at a certain distance from the data points on manifold. The proposed procedure is very robust to both noise and outliers, as shown in experiments. On the other hand, the traditional PCA procedure can handle limited noise but is very sensitive to outliers."

Therefore, it is possible to estimate the ID of a nonlinear manifold by checking it locally. A cover is referred to a set whose elements are subsets of the data set satisfying that the union of all subsets in the cover contains the whole data set.\nDefinition 3.2 (The set cover problem): Given a universe X of N elements and a collection F of subsets of X , where F = {F1, · · · , FN}. Set cover is concerned with finding a minimum sub-collection of F that covers all data points.\nUsing a minimum cover has two advantages. First, it can find the minimal number of subregions, which helps save the computational time. Secondly, the result of ID estimation that utilizes the whole data set is more reliable. However, searching such a minimal cover is an NP-hard problem. In the following, we introduce an algorithm which can approximately find a minimal cover of a data set.\nGiven the parameter, an integer k or a real number ε, there are two ways to define the neighborhood of any data point x:\n1) The k-NN method: any data point xi that is one of k nearest data points of x is in the neighborhood of x;\n4 2) The ε-NN method: any data point xi in the region {y : ‖y − x‖ < ε} is in the neighborhood of x.\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that the index of data points is independent of their locations.\nAlgorithm 1 (Minimum set cover algorithm) Input: Neighborhood size k (integer) or ε (real number), distance matrix D̂ = (‖xi − xj‖) Output: Minimum cover F = {(Fi, ri), i = 1, · · · , S}.\n1: for i=1 to N do 2: Identify the neighbors {xi1 , · · · , xiPi} of xi by the\nk-NN or ε-NN method.

Compared with the local region selection algorithm used in [9], our algorithm above has a low time complexity and avoids the supervised process to choose the neighborhood. Intuitively, the cardinality S of the cover F satisfies that N/k < S < N/2k, where k is the average number of neighbors."

In the first part, computing the distance matrix needs O(N2) time, searching the nearest neighbors for every data point needs O(kN2) time and finding an approximate minimum cover of X needs O(kN) time. Therefore, the first part needs O((K + 1)N2 + kN) running time. In the second part, performing PCA locally needs k3 × (N/k) ≈ O(k2N) running time.

Some samples of the Isoface data set are shown in Fig. 2(a). In the experiments, each image is reshaped to a 4096-dimensional vector. It can be seen that the Isoface data set is under a three-dimensional movement: up-down, left-right and lighting changes. In [4], the Isomap algorithm estimated its ID as 3 using the projection approach. As can be seen from Fig. 2(b), corresponding to the neighborhood sizes from 4 to 40, the C-PCA estimator ranges from 2.3 to 3.5 and the MLE estimator ranges from 3.5 to 4.5. The estimation given by the k-NNG and k-k/2 NN methods is oscillating badly with the neighborhood sizes, so they are bot unstable. Since the L-PCA method can not filter out noise contained in data, it tends to overestimate the ID as the neighborhood size increases. This means that our noise filtering process plays a key role in the convergence of the C-PCA method.\nThe second data set is the LLEface data set, which contains 1965 samples in a 560-dimensional space (see Fig. 3(a) for some samples). From Fig. 3(b), it is seen that both the C-PCA and the MLE methods give a convergent ID estimation with the increase of the neigh-\nborhood size, while the L-PCA, k-k/2-NN and k-NNG methods seem not convergent when the neighborhood size is increasing. The ID estimation given by the C-PCA method changes between 2.8 and 4.7 with the convergent estimation being 4.7, while the estimation result obtained by the MLE method changes gradually from 5.2 to 5.8 with a convergent estimation of 5.8.\nWe now consider two MNIST data sets: the set ’0’ and the set ’1’ (see Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 5(a) for some samples of these two data, respectively). The data set ’0’ contains\n980 data points, while the data set ’1’ contains 1135 data points. It can be seen from Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 5(b) that all methods, except the L-PCA and k-NNG methods, converge with the increase of the neighborhood size. For the data set ’0’, it can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that the ID estimation given by the C-PCA method converges to 5.8 and the estimation given by both the MLE estimator and the k-k/2-NN estimator converges to 10. For the data set ’1’, Fig. 5(b) shows that the ID estimation obtained by\nthe C-PCA method converges to 5.5 and the estimation provided with both the MLE method and the k-k/2-NN method converges to 7.2. Note that the result given by our method is in a big disagreement with the results given by other methods for the ID estimation of the data sets ’0’ and ’1’. A digit ’0’ is usually represented as an ellipse which can be determined by the coordinates of its focus and its major and minor axes, so the ID of the data set ’0’ is likely to be 5. The number ’1’ can be considered as a line segment, which rotates from left to right, so a sensible ID estimation for the data set ’1’ may be between 4 and 5."

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool in discovering dimensionality of data sets with a linear structure; it, however, becomes ineffective when data have a nonlinear structure. In this paper, we propose a new PCA-based method to estimate intrinsic dimension of data with nonlinear structures. Our method works by first finding a minimal cover of the data set, then performing PCA locally on each subset in the cover and finally giving the estimation result by checking up the data variance on all small neighborhood regions. The proposed method utilizes the whole data set to estimate its intrinsic dimension and is convenient for incremental learning. In addition, our new PCA procedure can filter out noise in data and converge to a stable estimation with the neighborhood region size increasing. Experiments on synthetic and real world data sets show effectiveness of the proposed method.",
