      "text" : "Humans have the capacity to draw commonsense inferences from natural language: various things that are likely but not certain to hold based on established discourse, and are rarely stated explicitly. We propose an evaluation of automated common-sense inference based on an extension of recognizing textual entailment: predicting ordinal human responses of subjective likelihood of an inference holding in a given context. We describe a framework for extracting common-sense knowledge for corpora, which is then used to construct a dataset for this ordinal entailment task, which we then use to train and evaluate a sequence to sequence neural network model. Further, we annotate subsets of previously established datasets via our ordinal annotation protocol in order to then analyze the distinctions between these and what we have constructed."

The windows looked out to the bay. In order for the definite reference the windows to be resolved, one needs to know that rooms have windows is probable or at least reasonable.\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n00 60\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nN ov\nrately considered models of language, rather than of the world (Rudinger et al., 2015). Facts such that a person walking into a room is very likely to be regularly blinking and breathing are not often explicitly stated, so their real-world likelihoods do not align to language model probabilities.4 We would like a system capable of reading a sentence describing some situation, such as found in a newspaper, and be able to infer how likely other statements hold of that situation, in the real world. This as compared to, e.g., knowing the likelihood of the next observed sentence in that newspaper article.\nWe therefore propose a model of knowledge acquisition based on first deriving possibilistic properties from text: as the relative frequency of these statements suffer the mentioned reporting bias, we then follow up with human annotation of derived examples. Our derived common-sense knowledge, which we initially are uncertain as to the real-world likelihood of it holding in any particular context, is paired with various grounded contexts which are presented to humans for their own assessment. As these examples vary in assessed plausibility, we propose the task of ordinal common-sense inference, which embraces a wider set of natural conclusions arising from language comprehension (see Fig 1).\nIn the following, we first describe prior efforts in common-sense knowledge acquisition and textual inference tasks (§2). We then state our position on how common-sense inference should be defined (§3), and detail our own framework for large-scale extraction and abstraction, along with a crowdsourcing protocol for assessment (§4). This includes a novel neural model for forward generation of textual inference statements. Together these methods are applied to contexts derived from various prior textual inference resources, resulting in a large collection of diverse common-sense inference examples, judged to hold with varying levels of subjective likelihood (§5). We provide baseline results (§6) for prediction on the Johns Hopkins Ordinal Commonsense Inference (JOCI) collection, which we will release freely.\n4For further background see discussions by Van Durme (2010), Gordon and Van Durme (2013), Rudinger et al. (2015) and Misra et al. (2016)."

      "text" : "Mining Common Sense Building large collections of common-sense knowledge can be done manually via professionals (Hobbs and Navarretta, 1993), but at considerable time and expense (Miller, 1995; Lenat, 1995; Baker et al., 1998; Friedland et al., 2004). Efforts have pursued volunteers (Singh, 2002; Havasi et al., 2007) and games with a purpose (Chklovski, 2003), but are still left fully reliant on human labor. Many have pursued automating the process, such as in expanding lexical hierarchies (Hearst, 1992; Snow et al., 2006), constructing inference patterns (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Berant et al., 2011), reading reference materials (Richardson et al., 1998; Suchanek et al., 2007), mining search engine query logs (Paşca and Van Durme, 2007), and most relevant here: abstracting from instance-level predications discovered in descriptive texts (Schubert, 2002; Liakata and Pulman, 2002; Clark et al., 2003; Banko and Etzioni, 2007). In this article we are concerned with knowledge mining for purposes of seeding a text generation process (constructing common-sense inference examples).\nCommon-sense Tasks A large portion of textual inference tasks has been designed to require common-sense knowledge at some degree, e.g., the Winograd Schema Challenge discussed by Levesque et al. (2011). The data for these tasks are either smaller, carefully constructed evaluation sets by professionals, following efforts such the construction of the FRACAS test suite (Cooper et al., 1996), or they rely on crowdsourced elicitation (Bowman et al., 2015). Crowdsourcing is scalable, but elicitation protocols can lead to biased responses unlikely to contain a wide range of possible common-sense inferences: humans can generally agree on the plausibility of a wide range of possible inference pairs, but they are not likely to generate them from an initial prompt.5\nThe construction of SICK (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge) made use of existing paraphrastic sentence pairs (descriptions by differ-\n5McRae et al. (2005): For example, features such as <is larger than a tulip> or <moves faster than an infant>, although logically possible, do not occur in [human responses] [...] Although people are capable of verifying that a <dog is larger than a pencil>.\nent people of the same image), which were modified through a series of rule-based transformations then judged by humans (Marelli et al., 2014). As with SICK, we rely on humans only for judging provided examples, rather than elicitation of text. Unlike SICK, our generation is based on a more extensive process targeted specifically at common sense.\nTextual Entailment A multi-year source of textual inference examples were generated under the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges, introduced by Dagan et al. (2006):\nWe say that T entails H if, typically, a human reading T would infer that H is most likely true. This somewhat informal definition is based on (and assumes) common human understanding of language as well as common background knowledge.\nThis definition strayed from the more strict notion of entailment as used by linguistic semanticists, such as those involved with FRACAS. While Giampiccolo et al. (2008) extended binary RTE with an “unknown” category, the entailment community has primarily focussed on issues such as paraphrase and monotonicity (such as captured by MacCartney and Manning (2007)).\nGarrette et al. (2011) and Beltagy et al. (2013) introduced weighted inference rules based words/phrases similarity, and treated textual entailment as probabilistic logical inference in Markov Logic Networks (Richardson and Domingos, 2006). Supported by Hobbs et al. (1988), who proposed viewing natural language interpretation as abductive inference, their approach to weighted inference is to measure how likely H is best entailed, i.e., the probability of H being an entailment. However, it is not guaranteed that there is a map between the probability of being an entailment to the likelihood of an inference being true. For example, ”Ed has a convertible” does not strictly entail ”The convertible has a retractable roof ”, which should receive a low probability of being an entailment. But we can infer here, the convertible is indeed very likely to have a retractable roof.\nNon-entailing Inference Of the various non“entailment” textual inference tasks, a few are most salient here. Agirre et al. (2012) piloted a Textual Similarity evaluation which has been refined in each\nsubsequent year: systems produce scalar values corresponding to predictions of how similar the meaning is between two provided sentences. For example, the following pair from SICK was judged very similar (4.2 out of 5), while also being a contradiction: There is no biker jumping in the air and A lone biker is jumping in the air. The ordinal approach we advocate for here relies on a graded notion, like textual similarity.\nThe Choice of Plausible Alternative (COPA) task (Roemmele et al., 2011) was a reaction to RTE, similarly motivated to probe a system’s ability to understand inferences that are not strictly entailed: a single context was provided, with two alternative inferences, and a system had to judge which was more plausible. The COPA dataset was manually elicited, and is not large: we discuss this data further in § 5.\nThe Narrative Cloze task (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008) requires a system to score candidate inferences as to how likely they are to appear in a document that also included the provided context. Many such inferences are then not strictly entailed by the context. Further, the cloze task gives the benefit of being able to generate very large numbers of examples automatically by simply occluding parts of existing documents and asking a system to predict what is missing. As our concern is with inferences that are often true but never stated in a document, this approach is not viable here. The ROCStories corpus (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016) elicited a more “plausible” collection of documents in order to retain the narrative cloze in the context of commonsense inference; we consider this dataset in § 5.\nAlongside the narrative cloze, Pichotta and Mooney (2016) made use of a 5-point Likert scale (very likely to very unlikely) as a secondary evaluation of various script induction techniques. While they were concerned with measuring their ability to generate very likely inferences, here we are interested in generating a wide swath of inference candidates, including those that are impossible."

Based on the observed shortfalls of prior work, we propose the notion of Ordinal Common-\nsense Inference (OCI). OCI embraces the notion of Dagan et al. (2006), in that we are concerned with human judgements of whether something is likely. However, rather than weakening the notion of logical truth to result in bins of (most likely) true and (most likely) false, with possibly a gray area between, we refine the task definition to directly embrace subjective likelihood on an ordinal scale. Humans when presented with a context C are asked whether a provided inference I is very likely, likely, plausible, technically possible, or impossible. Furthermore, an important part of this process is the generation of I by automatic methods, which seeks to avoid the elicitation bias of many prior works."

      "heading" : "4.1.1 Generation based on World Knowledge",
      "text" : "Our motivation for this approach was first introduced by Schubert (2002):\nThere is a largely untapped source of general knowledge in texts, lying at a level beneath the explicit assertional content. This knowledge consists of relationships implied to be possible in the world, or, under certain conditions, implied to be normal or commonplace in the world.\nFollowing Schubert (2002) and Van Durme and Schubert (2008), we define an approach for abstracting over explicit assertions derived from corpora, leading to a large-scale collection of general possibilistic statements. As shown in Fig 2, this approach generates common-sense inference candidates in four steps: (a) extracting propositions with predicate-argument structures from texts, (b)\nabstracting over propositions to generate templates for concepts, (c) deriving properties of concepts via different strategies, and (d) generating possibilistic inferences from contexts.\n(a) Extracting propositions: First we extract a large set of propositions with predicate-argument structures from noun phrases and clauses, under which general world presumptions often lie. Following Rudinger and Van Durme (2014), we define a series of conversion rules for post-processing a sentential syntactic dependency tree into zero or more predicate argument structures. Fig 2 (a) shows an example extraction.\nWe use the Gigaword corpus (Parker et al., 2011) for extracting propositions as it is a comprehensive text archive. There exists a version containing automatically generated syntactic annotation (Ferraro et al., 2014), which bootstraps large-scale knowledge extraction. We use PyStanfordDependencies6 to convert constituency parses to depedency parses, from which we extract structured propositions. (b) Abstracting propositions: In this step, we abstract the propositions into a more general form. This involves lemmatization, stripping inessential modifiers and conjuncts, and replacing specific arguments with generic types (e.g., replacing “John” with “person”)7. An example is shown in Fig 2 (b). This method of abstraction often yields general presumptions about the world. To reduce noise from predicate-argument extraction, we only keep 1-place and 2-place predicates after abstraction.\nWe further generalize individual arguments to concepts by attaching semantic-class labels to them. Here we choose WordNet (Miller, 1995) noun synsets8 as the semantic-class set. (A synset is a group of words denoting the same concept, as represented by a single WordNet sense, e.g., person.n.01.) When selecting the correct sense for an argument, we adopt a fast and relatively accurate method: always taking the first sense which is usually the most commonly used sense (Suchanek et al., 2007; Pasca, 2008). By doing so, we attach 84 million abstracted propositions with senses, covering 43.7% (35,811/81,861) of WordNet noun senses.\nEach of these WordNet senses, then, is associated with a set of abstracted propositions. The abstracted propositions are turned into templates by replacing the sense’s corresponding argument with a placeholder, similar to Van Durme et al. (2009). (See Fig 2 (b).) We remove any template associated with a sense if it occurs less than two times for that sense, leaving 38 million unique templates. (c) Deriving properties via WordNet: At this step, we want to associate with each WordNet sense a set of possible properties. We employ three strategies.\n6https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ PyStanfordDependencies\n7See Schubert (2002) for detail. 8In order to avoid too general senses, we set cut points at the depth of 4 (Pantel et al., 2007) to truncate the hierarchy and consider all 81,861 senses below these points.\nThe first strategy is to use a decision tree to pick out highly discriminative properties for each WordNet sense. Specifically, for each set of cohyponyms9, we train a decision tree using the associated templates as features. For example, in Fig 2 (c), we train a decision tree over the cohyponyms of publication.n.01. Then the template “person subscribe to ” would be selected as a property of magazine.n.01, and the template “person borrow from library” for book.n.01.\nThe second strategy is simply to select the most frequent templates associated with each sense as properties of that sense.\nThe third strategy uses WordNet ISA relations to derive new properties of senses. For example, for the sense book.n.01 and its hypernym publication.n.01, we generate a property “ be publication”. (d) Generating inference candidates: As shown in Fig 2 (d), given a discourse context (Tanenhaus and Seidenberg, 1980), we first extract an argument of the context, then select the derived properties for the argument. Since we don’t assume any specific sense for the argument, these properties could come from any of its candidate senses. They could also come from any sense on the hypernym path of all candidate senses, as the downward polarity of the properties guarantees their applicability to more specific senses. We then generate inferences by replacing the placeholder in the selected properties with the argument, and verbalizing the properties10."

      "text" : "As an alternative to the knowledge-based methods described above, we also adapt a neural sequence-tosequence model (Vinyals et al., 2015; Bahdanau et al., 2014) to directly generate inferences given contexts. The model is trained on sentence pairs labeled “entailment” from the train set of the SNLI corpus (Bowman et al., 2015). Here, the SNLI “premise” is the input to the network (i.e., context), and the SNLI “hypothesis” is the output (inference).\n9Senses sharing a hypernym with each other are called cohyponyms (e.g., book.n.01, magazine.n.01 and collections.n.02 are co-hyponyms of publication.n.01).\n10 We use the pattern.en module (http://www.clips. ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-en) for verbalization, which includes determining plurality of the argument, adding proper articles, and conjugating verbs.\nWe employ two different strategies for forward generation of inferences given any context. The sentence-prompt strategy uses the entire sentence in the context as an input, and generates output using greedy decoding. The word-prompt strategy differs by using only a single word from the context as input. This word is chosen in the same fashion as the AGCI-WK step (d), i.e. an argument of the context. See example in Fig 3. For both strategies, we later present the full context and decoded inference to crowdsource workers for annotation."

Specifically, in the SNLI train set, there are over 150K different first sentences, involving 7,414 different arguments according to predicate-argument extraction. We randomly choose 4,600 arguments. For each argument, we sample one first sentence that has the argument, and run AGCI against this as context. We also do the same generation for the SNLI dev set and test set. We also run AGCI against randomly sampled first sentences in the ROCStories corpus. Collectively, these pairs and their ordinal labels (to be described in § 5.2) make up the main part of the JOCI corpus. The statistics of this subset are shown in Table 1 (first five rows).\nFor comprehensiveness, we also produced ordinal labels on ( C , I ) pairs directly drawn from existing corpora.

      "text" : "We use Amazon Mechanical Turk to annotate the inferences with ordinal labels. In each HIT (Human Intelligence Task), a worker is presented with one context and one or two inferences, as shown in Fig 4. First, the annotator sees an “Initial Sentence” (context), e.g. “John’s goal was to learn how to draw well.”, and is then asked about the plausibility of the inference, e.g. “A person accomplishes the goal”. In particular, we ask the annotator how plausible the inference is true during or shortly after, because without this constraint, most sentences are technically plausible in some imaginary world.\nIf the inference does not make sense11, the workers can check the box under the question and skip the ordinal annotation. In the annotation, about 25% of AGCI are marked as not making sense, and are removed from our data.\nWith the sampled contexts and the common-sense inferences, we prepare about 35K examples for crowdsourced annotation in bulk. In order to guarantee the quality of annotation, we have each example annotated by three workers. We take the median of the three as the ordinal label. Table 3 shows the statistics of the crowdsourced efforts.\n11“Not making sense” means that inferences that are incom-\nplete sentences or grammatically wrong.\nTo make sure non-expert workers have a correct understanding of our task, before launching the later tasks in bulk, we run two pilots to create a pool of qualified workers. In the first pilot, we publish 100 examples. Each example is annotated by five workers. From this pilot, we collect a set of “good” examples which have 100% annotation agreement among workers. The ordinal labels chosen by the workers are regarded as the gold labels. In the second pilot, we randomly select two “good” examples for each gold label (i.e., 12 “good” examples for all six ordinal labels), and publish a HIT with these examples. To measure workers’ agreement, we calculate the average of quadratic weighted Cohen’s κ scores between workers’ annotation. By setting a threshold of the average of κ scores to 0.7, we are able to create a pool that has over 150 qualified workers."

We are also interested in comparing AGCI with related resources under our annotation protocol to see its other characteristics such as the coverage on different ordinals of likelihood. Quality We measure the quality of each pair by calculating the standard deviation of workers’ annotations. Fig 5 shows the growth of the size of AGCI as we decrease the threshold of the averaged κ score to filter pairs. Even if we place a relatively strict threshold (> 0.6), we can still get a large subset of AGCI with over 15K pairs. We randomly sample several pairs from this subset. As shown in table 2, they are all high-quality common-sense inferences with different ordinal labels.\nLabel Distribution We compare the distribution\nof labels between our AGCI subset and our SNLI, ROCStories, and COPA subsets.\nFig 6a shows the normalized distribution of SNLI and AGCI, where AGCI covers a wide range of ordinal likelihoods. We believe datasets with wide support are important in training systems to recognize ordinal scale inferences.\nFig 6a also shows how traditional RTE labels are related to ordinal labels, although lots of inferences in the SNLI corpus are just textual inferences requiring no common-sense knowledge (e.g. paraphrases). Expectedly, entailments are mostly considered very likely, neutral inferences are mostly plausible, and contradictions are more likely to be either impossible or just technically possible, but there are also a considerable number of exceptions.\nFig 6b shows the normalized distributions of AGCI and ROCStories. Compared with ROCStories, AGCI still covers a wider range of ordinal likelihood. We observe in ROCStories that while 2nd\nsentences are in general more likely to be true than 3rd, a large proportion of both 2nd and 3rd sentences are plausible, as compared to likely or very likely. This matches intuition: pragmatics dictates that subsequent sentences in a standard narrative carry new information.12 That our protocol picks this up is an encouraging sign for our ordinal protocol, as well as suggestive that the makeup of the elicited ROCStories collection is indeed “story like”.\nFor the COPA dataset, we make use only of the pairs in which the alternatives are plausible effects (rather than causes) of the premise, as our protocol more easily accommodates these pairs.13 Annotating this section of COPA with OCI labels pro-\n12I.e., if subsequent sentences in a story were always very likely, then those would be boring tales; the reader could infer the conclusion based on the introduction. While at the same time if most subsequent sentences were only technically possible, the reader would give up in confusion.\n13Specifically, we treat premises as contexts and effect alternatives as possible inferences.\nvides an enlightening and validating view of the dataset. Fig 6c shows the normalized distribution of COPA next to that of AGCI. (COPA-1 alternatives are marked as most plausible; COPA-0 are not.) True to its name, the majority of COPA alternatives are labeled as either plausible or likely; almost none are impossible. This is consistent with the idea that the COPA task is to determine which of two possible options is the more plausible. Fig 7 shows the joint distribution of ordinal labels on (COPA-0,COPA-1) pairs. As expected, the densest areas of the heatmap lie above the diagonal, indicating that in almost every pair, COPA-1 received a higher OCI score than COPA-0.\nAGCI Comparisons: We compare the label distributions of different AGCI methods in Fig 8. Among ACGI-WK methods, the ISA strategy yields a bimodal distribtuion, with the majority of inferences labeled impossible or very likely. This is likely because most copular statements generated with the ISA strategy will either be categorically true or false. In contrast, the decision tree and frequency based strategies generate many more inferences with intermediate ordinal labels. This suggests the propositional templates (learned from text) capture many “possibilistic” inferences, as we aim to achieve.\nThe two AGCI-NN strategies show interesting differences in label distribution, as well. Sequence-tosequence decodings with full-sentence prompts lead to more very likely labels than single-word prompts. This is unsurprising, as the sequence-to-sequence model can make more precise inferences when it has access to all the information in the context. When combined, the five AGCI strategies (three AGCIWK and two AGCI-NN) provide reasonable coverage\nover all five categories, as can be seen in Fig 6."

As reference, a model which selects the ordinal class that appears most often in the training data performs worse at 5.56 and 7.00 MSE (Most Frequent). Other comparisons include:\nFrequency Sampling: Select an ordinal label according to their distribution in train\nRounded Average: Average over all labels from train rounded to nearest ordinal.\nOne-vs-All: Train one SVM classifier per ordinal class and select the class label with the largest corresponding margin. We train this model with the same set of features as the ordinal regression model.\nOverall, the regression model achieves lower MSE, which implies that this dataset is learnable and tractable. Naturally, we would desire a model that achieves MSE under 1.0, and we hope that the release of our dataset will encourage more concerted effort in this common-sense inference task. Importantly, note that MSE on B-test is substantially higher than on A-test. We believe “B” is a more challenging dataset because auto-generation of inference leads to wider variety than elicitation.\nWe also run feature ablation tests to compare the importance of different features. In Fig 10, it is notable that on A-test and B-test, the most useful sets of features differ. On A-test, where the inferences are elicited from humans, the similarity- and bow-based features together yield the biggest gains. In contrast, similarity- and bow-based features offer little to no gain on B-test, in which the inferences have been automatically generated. Instead, most gains on B-test come from the sequence-tosequence based features. (Note that, as a result of the generation techniques in B-test, the value of bowoverlap is nearly always 1.) These observations belie systematic statistical differences between humanelicited and automatically generated inferences, a\nfundamental motivating point of the JOCI corpus."

      "text" : "In motivating the need for automatically building collections of common-sense knowledge, Clark et al. (2003) wrote:\n“China launched a meteorological satellite into orbit Wednesday.” suggests to a human reader that (among other things) there was a rocket launch; China probably owns the satellite; the satellite is for monitoring weather; the orbit is around Earth; etc\nThe use of “etc” summarizes an infinite number of other statements that a human reader would find to be very likely, likely, technically plausible, or impossible, given the provided context.\nPreferably we could build systems that would automatically learn common-sense exclusively from available corpora; extracting not just statements about what is possible, but also the associated probabilities of how likely certain things are to obtain in any given context. We are unaware of existing work that has demonstrated this to be feasible.\nWe have therefore described a multi-stage approach to common-sense textual inference: we first extract large amounts of possible statements from a corpus, and use those statements to generate contextually grounded context-inference pairs. These are presented to humans for direct assessment of subjective likelihood, rather than relying on corpus data alone. As the data is automatically generated, we\ncan bypass issues in human elicitation bias. Further, since subjective likelihood judgments are not difficult for humans, our crowdsourcing technique is inexpensive and could be scaled beyond what is already described here.\nFuture work will extend our techniques for forward inference generation, further scale up the annotation of additional examples, and explore the use of larger, more complex contexts."

We propose an evaluation of automated common-sense inference based on an extension of recognizing textual entailment: predicting ordinal human responses of subjective likelihood of an inference holding in a given context. We describe a framework for extracting common-sense knowledge for corpora, which is then used to construct a dataset for this ordinal entailment task, which we then use to train and evaluate a sequence to sequence neural network model. Further, we annotate subsets of previously established datasets via our ordinal annotation protocol in order to then analyze the distinctions between these and what we have constructed.",
