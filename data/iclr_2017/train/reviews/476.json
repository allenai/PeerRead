Although previous research showed that shallow feed-forward nets sometimes can learn the complex functions previously learned by deep nets while using the same number of parameters as the deep models they mimic, in this paper we demonstrate that the same methods cannot be used to train accurate models on CIFAR-10 unless the student models contain multiple layers of convolution.

The experiments are performed on he CIFAR 10 dataset where deep convolutional teacher networks are used to train shallow student networks using L2 regression on logit outputs.  The results show that similar accuracy on the same parameter budget can be only obtained when multiple layers of convolution are used. \n\nStrong  points.\n- The experiments are carefully done with thorough selection of hyperparameters. \n- The paper shows interesting results that go partially against conclusions from the previous work in this area (Ba and Caruana 2014).\n- The paper is well and clearly written.\n\nWeak points:\n- CIFAR is still somewhat toy dataset with only 10 classes. It would be interesting to see some results on a more challenging problem such as ImageNet. Would the results for a large number of classes be similar?\n\nOriginality:\n- This is mainly an experimental paper, but the question it asks is interesting and worth investigation. The experimental results are solid and provide new insights.\n\nQuality:\n- The experiments are well done.\n\nClarity:\n- The paper is well written and clear.\n\nSignificance:\n- The results go against some of the conclusions from previous work, so should be published and discussed.\n\nOverall:\nExperimental paper with interesting results.

The results are therefore perhaps not quite surprising, but not completely obvious either.\n\nAn interesting point on which the authors comment only very briefly is that among the non-convolutional architectures the ones using 2 or 3 hidden layers outperform those with 1, 4 or 5 hidden layers. Do you have an interpretation / hypothesis of why this is the case? It  would be interesting to discuss the point a bit more in the paper.\n\nIt was not quite clear to me why were the experiments were limited to use  30M parameters at most. None of the experiments in Figure 1 seem to be saturated. Although the performance gap between CNN and MLP is large, I think it would be worthwhile to push the experiment further for the final version of the paper.\n\nThe authors state in the last paragraph that they expect shallow nets to be relatively worse in an ImageNet classification experiment. \nCould the authors argue why they think this to be the case? \nOne could argue that the much larger training dataset size could compensate for shallow and/or non-convolutional choices of the architecture. \nSince MLPs are universal function approximators, one could understand architecture choices as expressions of certain priors over the function space, and in a large-data regimes such priors could be expected to be of lesser importance.\nThis issue could for example be examined on ImageNet when varying the amount of training data.\nAlso, the much higher resolution of ImageNet images might have a non-trivial impact on the CNN-MLP comparison as compared to the results established on the CIFAR10 dataset.\n\nExperiments on a second data set would also help to corroborate the findings, demonstrating to what extent such findings are variable across datasets.\n\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 7, "DATE": "16 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Careful study proving, to the extent possible, a fascinating point", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper describes a careful experimental study on the CIFAR-10 task that uses data augmentation and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization to train a large number of high-quality, deep convolutional network classification models from hard (0-1) targets.
