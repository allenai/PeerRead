That structure may be considered as a graph with colored vertices and colored edges: vertex color is its entity type, edge color correponds to a relation.\nThe question that we address is how to define similarity functions\nst : t× t→ R, ∀t ∈ T ,\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

      "text" : "The basic graph structure similarity measure is the classical SimRank [7] over a homogeneous graph G = (V,E) which is defined as follows:\nNG(a) = {v ∈ V : (v, a) ∈ E(G)},\ns(a, b) = C\nI(a)I(b) ∑ v∈N(a) w∈N(b) s(w, v).\nThe main drawback of this approach is that we cannot induce multiple relations or object types, so the only option is mixing them up into blobs ”relation exists” and ”all objects” that is completely not applicable in the case we have multiple relations with different semantics, for example the OpenCyc ontology node of the concept ”Game” (see Figure 1) cannot be easily expressed via a single type of relations and objects.\nPersonalized PageRank [8] is also often used to measure\nar X\niv :1\n50 2.\n06 81\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 4\nFe b\n20 15\nsimilarity in homogeneous graphs:\nπa(b) = εδa(b) + (1− ε) ∑\n(w,b)∈E\nπa(w)\nαw,v ,\nthat it same as PageRank, except random jumps are made into some pre-chosen node b, rather then into random node.\nAnother option is PathRank [6] that measures path-similarity between objects a, b picked from the same class A of the heterogeneous information network N given a symmetric meta-path P (set of paths that satisfy composition of relations M1,M2, . . . ,Mn that A M1−−→ C1 M2−−→ C2 . . .\nMn−−→ A, so A\nM1◦M2◦···◦Mn−−−−−−−−−−→ A) as a number of paths from the object a to the object b (each step i must satisfy corresponding relation Mi in P) normed over the number of paths from a to a plus the number of paths from b to b given P:\nsP(a, b) = ‖{p ∈ P : a p=⇒ b}‖\n‖{p ∈ P : a p=⇒ a}‖+ ‖{p ∈ P : b p=⇒ b}‖\nThat approach can handle several relations and object types and is very useful when we know the structure of relations we want our similarity measure to be based on. In case we want just to ”put our relations into a black box” that would find similarity that would capture all network relations as a whole, we might want to use something different. Recently, an approach [9] for building an optimal linear combination of meta-paths has been proposed.\nThere are several works on measuring similarity between objects from different classes, see, for example, [10]."

Relation between objects of unrelated classes is equal to zero by definition too. Equation (1) is basically the classical SimRank equation with the adjacency tensor instead of the adjacency matrix: each nonzero layer of tensor encodes some relation on the same pair of types. If one has more than a single relation between types p, t ∈ T , then r would have multiple non-zero layers on the intersection of indices associated with the classes t, p — one adjacency matrix per layer. In (1) the index γ stands for (weighted) summation over all layers of the tensor. That can be equivalently rewritten explicitly:\nS = ∑ γ wγWγSW T γ +D, (2)\nwhere the diagonal matrix D has to be chosen in a such way that diag(S) = I."

DISCUSSION AND FURTHER WORK\nProposed model can be used in various problem areas where most of the information is available in the form of relations between entities rather than features of individual entities and no trivial vector representation of those entities can be induced. One can use the vector representation\n[st]ij = δij + [ut]ik[dt]kl[ut]lj ,\nto embed the notion of relations into classical machine learning algorithms. Also, the proposed model can be used for relation generalisation, that might give interesting results since we work on heterogeneous graphs.\nFurther model improvements might also include treating relations as objects too (probably, via heterogeneous hypergraphs) and defining similarity matrix on relations."
