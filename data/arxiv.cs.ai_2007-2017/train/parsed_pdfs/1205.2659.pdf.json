      "text" : "The simplest model for sequential decision making is the deterministic model with known initial and goal states. Solutions are sequences of actions that map the initial state into a goal state that can be computed with standard search algorithms. This model has been studied thoroughly in AI with important contributions such as A*, IDA*, and others [30, 34].\nThe deterministic model has strong limitations on the type of problems that can be represented: it is not possible to model situations where actions have nondeterministic outcomes or where states are not fully observable. In such cases, one must resort to more expressive formalisms such as Markov Decision Processes (mdps) and Partially Observable mdps (pomdps). The generality of these models comes with a cost since the computation of solutions increase in complexity, specially for pomdps, and thus one gains in generality but loses in the ability to solve problems. pomdps, for example, are widely used as they offer one of the most\ngeneral frameworks for sequential decision making [19], yet the known algorithms scale very poorly.\nHowever, we have seen that an important collection of problems that involve uncertainty and partial information have a common characteristic: they have actions with deterministic outcomes and the observations generated at each decision stage also behave deterministically. Indeed, these models have been used in recent proposals for planning with incomplete information [15, 16, 27], appear in works of more general scope [15, 20] and about causation [31], and are used for learning partially-observable action models [1].\nThese models were briefly considered in Littman’s thesis [21] under the name of Deterministic POMDPs (det-pomdps) for which some important theoretical results were obtained. Among others, he showed that a det-pomdp can be mapped into an mdp with an exponential number of states and thus solved with standard MDP algorithms, and that optimal nonstationary policies of polynomial horizon can be computed in non-deterministic polynomial time. Unfortunately, det-pomdps briefly appeared as a curiosity of theoretical interest and then quickly fade out from consideration, to the point that, up to our knowledge, there are no publications on this subject neither from Littman or others.\nGiven the role of det-pomdps in recent investigations, motivated mainly by the quest of amenable models for decision making with uncertainty and partial information, we believe that det-pomdps should be further studied. In this paper, we carry out a systematic exploration of det-pomdps mainly from the complexity perspective yet we outline novel algorithms for them. We present three variants of the model: the fully observable, the unobservable and the general case, and two metrics of performance: worst- and expected-cost. As it will be shown, det-pomdps offer a tradeoff between the classical deterministic model and the general pomdp model. Furthermore, their characteristics permits the use of standard and novel AND/OR algo-\nrithms which are simpler and more efficient that the standard algorithms for pomdps [32, 36, 37], or the transformation proposed by Littman.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, we give examples of challenging problems that help us to establish the relevance of det-pomdps. We then present the definition and variants of the model in Sect. 3, the relation with AND/OR graphs and algorithms in Sect. 4, complexity analyses in Sect. 5, and finish with a brief discussion in Sect. 6."

For space reasons, we only provide few examples and brief descriptions for some of them.\nMastermind. There is a secret word of lengthm over an alphabet of n symbols. The goal is to discover the word by making guesses about it. Upon each guess, the number of exact matches and near matches is returned. The goal is to obtain a strategy to identify the secret.\nNavigation in Partially-Known Terrains. There is a robot in a n× n grid that must navigate from an initial position to a goal position. Each cell of the grid is either traversable or untraversable. The robot has perfect sensing within its cell but the traversability of a subset of cells is unknown. The task is to obtain a strategy for guiding the robot to its destination [20].\nDiagnosis. There are n binary tests for finding out the state of a system among m possible states. An instance consists of a m×n binary matrix T such that Tij = 1 iff test j is positive when the state is i. The goal is to get a strategy for identifying the state [29].\nCoins. There are n coins from which one is a counterfeit of different weight, and there is a 2-pan balance scale. A strategy that spots the counterfeit and finds out whether is heavier or lighter is needed [30].\nDomains from IPC. The problems in the 2006 and 2008 International Planning Competition for the track on conformant planning consisted of domains covering topics such as Blocksworld, circuit synthesis, universal traversal sequences, sorting networks, communication protocols and others [11], all of which are instances of det-pomdps."

      "text" : "Formally, a det-pomdp model is a tuple made of:\n– a finite state space S = {1, . . . , n},\n– finite sets of applicable actions Ai ⊆ A for i ∈ S,\n– a finite set of observations O,\n– an initial subset of states b0 ⊆ S, or alternatively an initial distribution of states b0 ∈ ∆S,\n– a subset T ⊆ S of goal (target) states,\n– a deterministic transition function f(i, a) ∈ S, for i ∈ S, a ∈ Ai, that specifies the result of applying action a on state i,\n– a deterministic observation function o(i, a) ∈ O, for i ∈ S, a ∈ A, that specifies the observation received when entering state i after the application of action a, and\n– positive costs c(i, a), for i ∈ S, a ∈ Ai that tells the immediate cost of applying a on i.\nFor simplicity, we assume that goal states are absorbing. That is, once a goal state is entered, the system remains there and incurs in no costs, hence At = A, f(t, a) = t and c(t, a) = 0 for t ∈ T .\nThe two options for b0 depend on whether the interest is in minimizing the worst-case total accumulated cost, or the expected total accumulated cost (see below). In any case, b0 is called the initial belief state1 and describes the different possibilities for the initial state which is not known a priori. Its importance is crucial since, under the assumption of deterministic transitions, if the initial state were known, then all future states would also be known, and the model reduces to the well-known deterministic model in AI [34]. Hence, the only source of uncertainty in det-pomdp models comes from the initial state which further induces an uncertainty on the observations generated at each decision stage. Nonetheless, the model remains challenging, with respect to expressivity and computation, as exemplified in the previous section.\nAlthough the state of the system may not be fully observable, it is possible (and indeed useful) to consider preconditions for actions. The role of preconditions is to permit the knowledge engineer to design economical representations by leaving out from the specification unimportant details or undesirable situations. For example, if one does not want to model the effects of plugging a 120V artifact into a 240V outlet, then a simple precondition can be used to avoid such situations. Preconditions in the det-pomdp model are expressed through the sets of applicable actions Ai. As it is standard in planning, situations in which there are no actions available are called dead ends.\n1The term ‘belief state’ refers to a subset of states (or a probability distribution on states) that is deemed possible by the agent at a given point in time."

      "heading" : "3.1 Optimality Criteria",
      "text" : "Our goal is to compute strategies that permit the agent to act optimally. We consider two optimality criteria, and three variants of the model. For optimality, we consider the minmax that minimizes the worst-case cost of a policy, and the minexp that minimizes the expected cost of a policy. The variants of the model depend on the observation model:\n• unobservable models in which O is a singleton and thus observations return no information about the state. This class is a subclass of the so-called conformant problems in planning [13].\n• fully-observable models in which o(i, a) = i. This class corresponds to fully observable mdps except that the initial state is unknown, but after the application of the first action the state is revealed.\n• models with no assumptions on the observations. This case corresponds to general det-pomdps and include the previous cases.\nTwo optimization criteria and three variants combine into six models: unobservable models with the minmax and minexp criteria, fully-observable models with the minmax and minexp criteria, and general models with minmax and minexp criteria. Among these, the unobservable and the general models are the interesting ones; fully-observable models are trivial and pathological and thus will not be considered again.\nFor partially-observable problems, the most general form of a policy is a function that maps belief states into actions. Beliefs are subsets of states for minmax models and probability distributions over states for minexp models. However, an optimal policy does not need to specify an action for all possible beliefs: it just need to consider the beliefs that could appear during the execution of the policy."

      "text" : "In order to execute an action, the agent must be certain about its applicability no matter what is the current state of the environment. Otherwise, the model might end up in an inconsistent configuration with respect to the specification. Hence, the set Ab of applicable actions at b is Ab\n.= ∩{Ai : i ∈ sup(b)} where sup(b), called the support of b, is the collection of states that are deemed possible at b, i.e. sup(b) .= b for subsets of states and sup(b) .= {i : b(i) > 0} for distributions on states. Once an applicable action is executed, each state in sup(b) changes into a new state making up a new belief ba\n.= {f(i, a) : i ∈ sup(b)} for subsets, and ba(j) .= ∑ f(i,a)=j b(i) for distributions.\nOn the real environment though, the current state transforms into a new state and an observation is generated, which is used to filter out states inconsistent with it; i.e. the filtered belief is boa\n.= {i ∈ ba : o(i, a) = o} for subsets, and, for distributions, is\nboa(i) .= {\n0 if ba(i) = 0 or o(i, a) 6= o, ba(i)/ba(o) otherwise,\nwhere ba(o) is a normalization constant.\nFrom the point of view of the agent, which does not know the current state of the environment, the set of observations that may appear after the application of a at b is o(b, a) .= {o(i, a) : i ∈ sup(ba)}. Under the minexp criterion, each observation has probability ba(o) of being received once action a is applied at b.\nLittman proposes an interesting representation for the reachable beliefs in the probabilistic case [21], in which a reachable belief b is represented by a table tb : S → S ∪ {⊥} as follows. For b0, tb0(i) is i or ⊥ whether b0(i) > 0 or not, and for boa where b is a reachable belief, a ∈ Ab and o ∈ o(b, a), the table tboa is given by tboa(i) = ⊥ if tb(i) = ⊥, ba(i) = 0 or o(i, a) 6= o, and tboa(i) = f(i, a) otherwise. In words, the entry tb(i) tells what would be the current state had the initial state been equal to i. The relation between b and tb is\nb(i) ∝ ∑\nj∈S b0(j)|{j : tb(j) = i}|.\nWe are interested in optimal policies that are closed with respect to the initial belief b0. Namely, that the policy is defined over all the beliefs that may appear during the execution of the policy. We say that a policy π is closed in a subset B of beliefs if π is defined on each b ∈ B, and boπ(b) ∈ B for each b ∈ B and o ∈ o(b, π(b)), and that π is closed with respect to b0, or just closed, if b0 ∈ Dom(π) and π is closed in Dom(π). We will only consider closed policies. The set of reachable beliefs from b0 using (closed) policy π is the minimum subset R .= R(b0, π) ⊆ Dom(π) such that b0 ∈ R and π|R is closed with respect to b0.2 A policy π is minimal if π = π|R(b0,π)."

      "text" : "Let us reason about the trajectories generated by a policy π. At the beginning, the agent applies the action a0 = π(b0). Then, the agent incurs in certain immediate cost, which depends on the current state and a0, and receives an observation o0, which also depends on the current state and action, that is used by the agent to update its initial belief into b1 = (b0)o0a0 . At the second decision stage, the agent applies the action a1 = π(b1), incurs in a cost and receives a new\n2f |A means the restriction of f to Dom(f) ∩ A.\nobservations o1 that is used to update the belief into b2 = (b1)o1a1 , and so on. This process continues until the agent is certain that a goal state has been reached, i.e. until the current belief b is a target belief characterized by sup(b) ⊆ T . It is important to remark that during the execution of a policy the agent cannot predict with certainty neither the costs nor the observations since s/he is not certain about the current state of the environment.\nAll possibles trajectories of π seeded at b0 form a labeled directed (multi-)graph Gπ = (V,E, `) where V = R(b0, π) and there is an edge (b, b′) labeled with o iff b is non-target and b′ = boπ(b) for some o ∈ o(b, π(b)). In probabilistic models, edges (b, b′) labeled with o have attached probabilities equal to bπ(b)(o).\nDeterministic actions imply |sup(ba)| ≤ |sup(b)| with strict inequality only if f(i, a) = f(j, a) for some i 6= j in sup(b). Therefore, if a is applicable in b and {b1, . . . , bm} is the collection of possible beliefs after observations, then the collection {sup(bi)}mi=1 is a partition of sup(ba) and thus ∑ o∈o(b,a) |sup(boa)| ≤ |sup(b)| for each a ∈ Ab. Furthermore, if b <π b′ denotes the existence of a path b b′ in Gπ and b <dπ b ′ the existence of a deterministic path, i.e. one in which each node has outdegree of one, then Theorem 1. Let Gπ be the graph for π. Then, (a) if b <π b′ then |sup(b)| ≥ |sup(b′)|, (b) if b <π b′ and |sup(b)| = |sup(b′)| then b <dπ b′, and (c) for minexp, if b <π b\n′ and sup(b) = sup(b′) then b(i) = b′(σi) where σ is a permutation of sup(b).\nAn immediate consequence is that for minexp models the set of reachable beliefs is finite independently of the initial belief. This fact was also observed by Littman who gave the upper bound (1+|S|)|S| on the maximum number of reachable beliefs as this is the maximum number of tables. This is a marked difference with respect to standard pomdps in which the number of reachable beliefs is typically infinite as well as the size of the policy graphs. Theorem 2. The set R(b0, A) of reachable beliefs is finite, the graph Gπ is finite for each policy π, and the number of minimal policies is also finite.\nTo define the cost of a policy, we consider the cases of whether Gπ is a DAG or not. In the latter case, there is a cycle in Gπ along a deterministic path and thus, for both optimization criteria, π incurs in infinite cost once it gets trapped into the cycle.3 Therefore, if Gπ has a cycle, its cost at b0 is set to infinity; i.e. V maxπ (b0) = V exp π (b0)\n.=∞. 3In mdps, it is customary to use a factor to discount future costs at a geometric rate so that every policy has finite cost. We do not consider such factors as often they are difficult to interpret and justify.\nIf Gπ is a DAG, the cost assigned by π at each belief is defined inductively bottom-up from the sink nodes up to the source b0. Indeed, being π closed, the sinks are target beliefs which has zero cost under both criteria, i.e. V maxπ (b) = V exp π (b)\n.= 0 if sup(b) ⊆ T . Once all successors of b get values, the value at b is defined as\nV maxπ (b) .= cmax(b, π(b)) + max\n(b,b′)∈Gπ V maxπ (b ′),\nV expπ (b) .= cexp(b, π(b)) + ∑ o∈o(b,π(b)) ba(o) · V expπ (boa),\nwhere the costs over beliefs are defined as cmax(b, a) .= maxi∈b c(i, a) and cexp(b, a) = ∑ i∈S b(i) · c(i, a). The cost assigned by policy π to belief b0, either finite or infinite, is called the cost of π. Clearly, if Gπ is a DAG, then V expπ (b0) ≤ V maxπ (b0) <∞.\nA policy π is preferred to policy π′ under optimization criterion ∆ if V ∆π (b0) < V ∆ π′ (b0). A policy π is optimal under ∆ if no other policy is preferred to it. Hence, by Theorem 2, if there is a policy of finite cost, then there is an optimal policy π∗ whose graph is a DAG. From now on, when we say an optimal policy, we mean an optimal policy of finite cost. If there is no policy of finite cost, we say there is no optimal policy."

Hence, Gπ is a single path of form\nb0 → b1 → b2 → · · · → bn−1 → bn.\nBy Theorem 1, |sup(b0)| ≥ · · · ≥ 1. Let us say that a “jump” occurs at bi if |sup(bi)| > |sup(bi+1)|, and that 〈bi, . . . , bi+m〉 is a “chunk” if it is a maximal subsequence with |sup(bi)| = · · · = |sup(bi+m)|. There are at most |S| jumps in the sequence so we need to bound the size of a largest chunk. Theorem 1 implies that the actions in the chunk map states in a 1-1 way, i.e. that actions behave like permutations over states. As it will be shown later, the size of a chunk can be exponential in some problems.\nLet us introduce the notion of diameter of a model that allow us to bound the length of a largest chunk. For a set of actions A and belief b, denote with R(b, A) the set of beliefs reachable from b using only actions in A, and with R∗(b, A) the set of beliefs with supports of size |sup(b)| that are reachable from b using only actions in A. A belief in R∗(b, A) is said to be k-reachable if it can be reached from b through the application of at most k actions from A. The diameter of R∗(b, A) is the least integer k such that every b′ ∈ R∗(b, A) is k-reachable, and the diameter\nof a model M is the maximum over the diameters of R∗(b, A) for all b ∈ R(b0, A). The model has polynomial diameter if its diameter is O(poly(|S|, |A|)).\nIf R(b0, A) is of polynomial size, the model is of polynomial diameter but the converse is not necessarily true. If M is of polynomial diameter, the lengths of the chunks are of polynomial length. Thus, unobservable problems of polynomial diameter have optimal policies of polynomial size.\nGeneral Models. Optimal policies are DAGs in which paths correspond to sequences of beliefs with non-increasing supports. As before, Theorem 3. Models of polynomial diameter have optimal policies of polynomial size.\nProof. It remains to show the claim for general models. Let π be an optimal policy. A subset B of beliefs is called an anti-chain iff there are no two different beliefs b, b′ ∈ B with b <π b′. An induction shows that if B is an anti-chain, then |sup(b0)| ≥ ∑ b∈B |sup(b)|. Thus, since |sup(b0)| ≤ |S|, all anti-chains have size at most |S|. On the other hand, the assumption implies that all paths in Gπ have polynomial length. Therefore, Gπ is of polynomial size since the beliefs at depth k form an anti-chain and thus their number is at most |S|."

Also observe that the beliefs in the graph can be represented with probability distributions or with Littman’s tables.\nThis relation permits the use of diverse algorithms. Firstly, since the number of reachable beliefs is finite, then all reachable beliefs can be enumerated and Value or Policy Iteration applied on the resulting mdp over belief space (this is essentially Littman’s proposal); both algorithms are guaranteed to converge in a finite number of steps. However, we can do better since optimal policies are acyclic and thus consistently improving policies exist. Therefore, more efficient algorithms can be used such as label setting methods and Dial’s algorithm [3, 7].\nExplicit algorithms as the above require enough memory to compute the set of reachable beliefs. If no such memory is available, search-based algorithms that generate beliefs incrementally and that use admissible heuristics to focus the search must be used. Relevant algorithms in this class are the classical AO* [6, 23, 26], LAO* [14], RTDP-like algorithms [2, 4], and LDFS [5].

Results for different optimization criteria, probabilistic and non-deterministic variants, and so on are known [17, 22, 25, 28, 33]. Littman [21] obtained important complexity results about detpomdps for problems with non-negative costs (i.e. with non-positive rewards):\n• deciding the existence of a policy that incurs in zero cost for an infinite-horizon det-pomdp is PSPACEcomplete, and\n• deciding the existence of a policy of polynomial length that incurs in zero cost for a det-pomdp is NP-complete\nIn this section, we extend this results as follows:\n• deciding the existence of a policy of finite cost for det-pomdps of polynomial diameter is NPcomplete,\n• there are det-pomdps on which all policies of finite cost are of super-polynomial size,\n• give new class of problems on which the existence of policies can be checked in non-deterministic polynomial time, and\n• give some sufficient conditions for testing whether a det-pomdp is of polynomial diameter.\nAll these results, as well as Littman’s results, are based in the assumption that the models are encoded in a flat language; that is, that the models are encoded with O(poly(|S|, |A|, h)) bits where h is the maximum number of bits needed to specify a cost or probability. The general question that we address here is whether there is a policy that reaches the goal with certainty. Namely,\nPolicy Existence for Flat Models (PEF): Is there a policy of finite cost for flat model M?\nThe fact that pef only considers flat models is important because with compact representations, an exponential number of states can be described and thus a double-exponential number of beliefs could be needed.\nTheorem 4. The PEF problem for unobservable models of polynomial diameter is NP-complete.\nProof. Inclusion is direct by guessing a polynomiallysized policy and checking it. For hardness, we reduce sat using the method in [25] almost verbatim. Let φ be a 3-CNF formula with variables x1, . . . , xn and clauses C1, . . . , Cm. A variable x 1-appears (0- appears) in clause C if x ∈ C (x ∈ C). We construct an unobservable modelM(φ) as follows. The set of states is S = {[xi, Cj ] : 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m}∪ {t, f}. States t and f mean satisfiable and unsatisfiable respectively. The actions set(i, v), for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and v ∈ {0, 1}, are used to set the value of variables: set(i, v) maps state [xi, Cj ] ([xn, Cj ]) to either t or [xi+1, Cj ] (to either t or f) whether xi v-appears in Cj or not. The initial belief is b0 = {[x1, Cj ] : 1 ≤ j ≤ m} and t is the unique target state. M(φ) is of polynomial size and diameter, and has a policy of finite cost iff φ is satisfiable.\nCorollary 5. The PEF problem for general models of polynomial diameter is NP-complete.\nProof. Hardness is direct since unobservable models are a special case. Inclusion follows by guessing a policy of polynomial size (Theorem 3) and checking it.\nSometimes, it is easy to verify that a model is of polynomial diameter. Indeed, if |sup(b0)| = k the number of reachable beliefs is O(nk). If k is a constant then the number of reachable beliefs is polynomial as well as the diameter. For another case, consider the (global) transition graph TM that is a directed graph whose nodes are the states and there is an edge (i, j) iff there is action a ∈ Ai such that j = f(i, a). If TM is acyclic, except for self-loops, the model has linear diameter. Examples are knowledge-gathering problems such as Mastermind, 12-coins and Diagnosis. The IPC problem for sorting networks is also of this type.\nTheorem 6. If |sup(b0)| is constant, then the diameter is polynomial. If TM is acyclic, except perhaps for self-loops, then the diameter is linear.\nAs noted in Theorem 1, there is a close connection between the diameter of a model and permutations over states. Thus, the study of permutations provides important insight for estimating the diameter of models."

Hence, the number of primes in [n1/2, n3/4] is asymptotically equal to 4n3/4/3 log n− 2n1/2/ log n which dominates n1/4. Therefore, for sufficiently large n, we can choose bn1/4c different primes in [n1/2, n3/4]. Their sum is bounded by n3/4 × n1/4 = n and thus these primes can be extended into a collection {d1, . . . , dm} of integers whose sum is equal to n. Since all primes are different and at least n1/2, their lcm is at least n 1 2n 1/4 which dominates nk for any constant k. Estimations on the expected order of random permutations are also known [9, 12, 38].\nFor the model, let a be an action that is like σ and let b0 be the subset containing the “first” state from each cycle Ci. Let a′ be another action that maps s into a target if s is the “last” state in a cycle, or into s otherwise. The optimal plan is the sequence of ord(σ)− 1 repetitions of a followed by a′.\nHowever, even in cases of non-polynomial diameter, we can test in non-deterministic polynomial-time the existence of policies for some models (proof below).\nTheorem 8. If each action is a permutation with empty precondition, then the PEF problem is in NP, even if the model is not of polynomial diameter.\nThe group Sn of all permutations over n elements is called the symmetric group of degree n. Let A ⊆ Sn be a subset. Then, A generates the subgroup 〈A〉 of all permutations that can be formed by finite compositions of elements from A. A permutation σ ∈ 〈A〉 is k-expressible if it is the product of at most k permutations from A. The diameter of 〈A〉 is the least integer k such that every permutation in 〈A〉 is k-expressible. Problems related to generated groups have a tradition in computer science. For example, Furst, Hopcroft and Luks [10] gave a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether a permutation σ is generated by the set A, and Jerrum [18] showed that computing the size of a smallest generator set is PSPACE-complete.\nProof Sketch for Theorem 8. We do it for unobservable models; the proof for general models is a bit more involved. Since actions are permutations, the size of beliefs do not change with actions. If there is a solution b0 → · · · → bn where bn is a target belief, then by Theorem 1, there is a permutation σ such that sup(b0) is\nmapped 1-1 into sup(bn). Thus, it is enough to guess σ and then test, in polynomial-time using the algorithm in [10], if σ is generated by the actions.\nMore important to us are results about diameters of groups. Driscoll and Furst [8] showed that if the generators are all cycles of bounded length, the diameter is O(n2), while McKenzie [24] showed that if all generators move at most k elements, the diameter is O(nk).\nTheorem 9. If every action has empty precondition, and is a permutation that moves a constant number of states or all cycles are of bounded length, then the model is of polynomial diameter."

      "text" : "We have shown that the Deterministic POMDP model first studied by Littman is more relevant than previously thought for two reasons. First, a number of important and challenging problems in planning correspond to such models, and second since they provide a tradeoff between the restricted yet efficient classical deterministic model and the general but inefficient pomdp model. We have shown novel complexity results that show this tradeoff: while checking the existence of plans in classical deterministic (flat) problems is NL-complete (via st-Reachability [35]), and checking the existence of plans for pomdps is EXPTIME-complete [21], we have that checking the existence of plans for det-pomdps of polynomial diameter is NP-complete, and that for det-pomdps in which the actions are permutations with empty precondition is in NP. Furthermore, we give polynomialtime checkable conditions for polynomial diameter.\nWe also proposed a relation between det-pomdps and AND/OR graphs that permit the use of general AND/OR search algorithms. Although we did not perform an experimental evaluation, it is clear that such algorithms should outperform in practice the explicit mapping of a det-pomdp into an mdp.\nIt is important to emphasize that det-pomdps are not “general” pomdps, and hence one should be careful when evaluating general algorithms with them. Due to the reduced complexity of the model, det-pomdps must be tackled as a more specialized class which is likely to scale better.\nIn the future, we would like to further study the relation between det-pomdps and permutation groups and to implement algorithms based of AND/OR search.\nAcknowledgments.
