Introduction The use of corpora has been a major factor in the recent advance in natural language processing development and evaluation. However, the high costs of building or licensing a corpora could be an obstacle for many young researchers or even some institution in several parts of the world. Therefore, having access to freely available corpora is clearly a desirable goal. Unfortunately, the freely available corpora are generally not easily found and most resources available from language data providers are for fees or exclusively reserved for subscribers, such as the corpora available from the Linguistic Data Consortium or the Evaluations and Language resources Distribution Agency (ELDA). A simple query for Arabic corpora available in the LDC Catalog shows the availability of 116 corpora of various types (text, speech, evaluation etc…).1 Another similar query done with the ELRA Corpora search engine showed the availability of 80 corpora. 2 For instance, Arabic can still be considered a relatively resource poor language when compared to other languages such as English, and having access to freely available corpora will definitely improve the current Arabic NLP technologies. In this paper, we present the results of an online survey of the freely available Arabic corpora.\n2. Current situation of the freely available Arabic corpora\nBefore starting our survey experiment, we tried various online queries to locate any freely available Arabic corpora or a repository listing the corpora for any easy access to the resources. We found that the information is scattered in various personal and research groups sites\n1 Query performed on January 31st 2014 <http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/>\n2 Query performed on January 31st 2014 <http://catalog.elra.info/search.php>\nthat are often not complete or outdated. As of 2010, ELRA created the LRE Map (Language Resources and Evaluation) which is an online database on language resources. The goal behind LRE Map is to monitor the creation and the use and of language resources. The information is collected during the submission process to LREC and other conferences. We did a query to list the freely available Arabic corpora and we found a limited number and no URL to link the user or project details were available. Habash (2010) listed in his book, various available Arabic corpora sorted by corpus type (speech, text, bi-lingual). Again the list is not designed for the freely available resources and most of data listed are available from data providers. The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) maintains a wiki page that lists the available resources by language, the Arabic page only lists five corpora, four free corpora and one proprietary corpora.3 The European Network of Excellence in Human Language Technologies (ELSNET) maintains a list of pointers to Arabic and other Semitic NLP and Speech sites, the Arabic resources section includes 23 entries and most of them were created more than 12 years ago.4 The Mediterranean Arabic Language and Speech Technology (MEDAR) conducted a survey in 2009 and 2010 to list the existing institutions and experts involved in the development of Arabic language resources, activities and projects being carried out and related and tools.5 The collected results were compiled and made available into a knowledge base that is accessible online6. Again, despite the huge effort made, the list is no 3 http://aclweb.org/aclwiki/index.php?title=Resources_for_Arabic\n4 http://www.elsnet.org/arabiclist.html\n5 http://www.medar.info/MEDAR_Survey_III.pdf\n6 www.elda.org/medar_knowledge_base/\nlonger updated and it lacks the necessary information to locate the data such as the download page or the project description and URL. Finally, we cite other interesting personal efforts to list some Arabic language resources such as the Sibawayh Repository for Arabic Language Processing page,7 Al-Sulaiti Arabic corpora page8 and Al-Ghamidi Arabic links page. 9 We consider our efforts described in this project as a complement to what exists already with a focus on the free resources and how each corpus can be obtained.\n3. The Survey In order to start the collection of our freely available Arabic corpora list, we created an online survey10 that was shared in the various NLP related lists such as Corpora11 and ArabicList.12 The online survey was intended to be completed within 5-10 minutes to encourage participants, and included some very basic questions such as the provider information, corpus type, size, purpose, download link, related publications, Arabic variety, production status and a confirmation that the corpus is completely free for a research purposes. The online survey was completed by 20 participants who pointed 26 resources. Once the survey results were compiled, we added manually, 40 other freely available Arabic resources taken from the various online sources described in section 2. We also added the missing information when needed (wrong download URL, description, corpus size, authors, etc.). Finally we tried to locate any related publication to the source so it can be cited properly when used. In the next section, we describe briefly a selection of the 66 free resources found during our survey.\n4. Available Resources In this section, we present the result of our survey of the freely available Arabic corpora with a focus on the most important work for each of the following categories:\nRaw Text Corpora: monolingual corpora, multilingual corpora, dialectal Corpora, web-based corpora. Annotated Corpora: named entities, error annotation, POS, syntax, semantic, anaphora. Lexicon: lexical databases and words lists. Speech Corpora: audio recording, transcribed data. Handwriting Recognition Corpora: scanned and annotated documents. Miscellaneous Corpora types: Questions/Answers, comparable corpora, plagiarism detection and summaries.\n7 http://arab.univ.ma/web/s/\n8 http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/eric/latifa/arabic_corpora.htm\n9 http://www.mghamdi.com/links.htm\n10 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1N2W76d8Uxnzx--0Dj6An2mJr8KzeR0U1rF6pOj6Djjg/vi\newform?edit_requested=true\n11 http://www.hit.uib.no/corpora/\n12 https://listserv.byu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=ARABIC-L\nFor each of the four categories, some basic information will be provided a table for each category. It includes the author name or the research group, the corpus name, the corpus size in words or in files. In case there is a publication associated with the corpus, it will be cited as part of the author name in the table otherwise only the corpus download/access URL is provided as a footnote following the corpus name in each table. The sources are sorted in the tables according to their size for the most important to the least important."

One notable effort in this category is the ongoing work to build the Quranic Arabic Corpus, an annotated linguistic resource consisting of 77,430 words of Quranic Arabic. The project aims to provide morphological and syntactic annotations for researchers wanting to study the language of the Quran. While the POS annotated version is already available for download, the treebank version is still ongoing. Moreover, an online query interface is available\n42 http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.01/tests/ace/ 43 http://nlp.qatar.cmu.edu/qalb/\n44 http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/scayga/alc/corpus%20files.html\n45 http://cri.kacst.edu.sa/Resources/TST_DB.rar\nfor morphological queries and concordance.

We hope that this initial attempt to located freely available Arabic corpora would be useful to the research community and such effort can be easily replicated to located similar sources for other languages. The corpora list presented in this paper, is made available in a single webpage for an easier access.74 In the near future, we plan to make the list available in an online database and we will continue looking for other free corpora to enrich our repository.\n6.

However, the costs of acquiring corpora can prevent some researchers from going further in their endeavours. The ease of access to freely available corpora is urgent needed in the NLP research community especially for language such as Arabic. Currently, there is not easy was to access to a comprehensive and updated list of freely available Arabic corpora. We present in this paper, the results of a recent survey conducted to identify the list of the freely available Arabic corpora and language resources. Our preliminary results showed an initial list of 66 sources. We presents our findings in the various categories studied and we provided the direct links to get the data when possible.",
