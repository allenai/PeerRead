The models further depend on a non-deterministic quantity in the form of a control input, which can be selected to affect the probabilistic dynamics. We address the synthesis of optimal controllers that maximize the probability associated to a rather general property of interest, known as the \"reach-avoid\" specification. The reach-avoid specification deals with assessing the likelihood that any finite-horizon trajectory of the model enters a given goal set, while avoiding a given set of undesired states (both arbitrary subsets of the state space). Equivalently, the property can be expressed as entering a goal set, while dwelling within a set of allowed states. The reach-avoid property is a well known specification that lies at the core of a number of modal logics used in the field of formal verification, and which is relevant for safety-critical applications ranging from robotics to air traffic management. This article newly provides an approximate computational scheme for the reach-avoid specification based on the Fitted Value Iteration algorithm, which hinges on random sample extractions, and derives new formal probabilistic bounds on the error made by the approximation algorithm: as such, the output of the numerical scheme is quantitatively assessed and thus meaningful for safety-critical applications of the property of interest. Furthermore, this contribution provides tighter sample-based probabilistic error bounds for the computation of the reach-avoid problem based on the Fitted Value Iteration. The overall computational scheme is put in relationship with alternative approximation algorithms in the literature, and finally its performance is practically assessed over a benchmark case study.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Sep 2014 20:03:48 GMT  (538kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0553v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 9 Sep 2015 20:20:13 GMT  (540kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0553v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.LG", "authors": ["sofie haesaert", "robert babuska", "alessandro abate"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0553"}
