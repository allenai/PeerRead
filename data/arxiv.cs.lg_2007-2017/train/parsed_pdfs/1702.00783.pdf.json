      "text" : "The problem of super resolution entails artificially enlarging a low resolution photograph to recover a plausible high resolution version of it. When the zoom factor is large, the input image does not contain all of the information necessary to accurately construct a high resolution image. Thus, the problem is underspecified and many plausible high resolution images exist that match the low resolution input image. This problem is significant for improving the state-of-the-art in super resolution, and more generally for building better conditional generative models of images.\nA super resolution model must account for the complex variations of objects, viewpoints, illumination, and occlusions, especially as the zoom factor increases. When some details do not exist in the source image, the challenge lies not only in ‘deblurring’ an image, but also in generating\n∗Work done as a member of the Google Brain Residency program (g.co/brainresidency).\nnew image details that appear plausible to a human observer. Generating realistic high resolution images is not possible unless the model draws sharp edges and makes hard decisions about the type of textures, shapes, and patterns present at different parts of an image.\nImagine a low resolution image of a face, e.g., the 8×8 images depicted in the left column of Figure 1–the details\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n00 78\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\nF eb\n2 01\nof the hair and the skin are missing. Such details cannot be faithfully recovered using simple interpolation techniques such as linear or bicubic. However, by incorporating the prior knowledge of the faces and their typical variations, an artist is able to paint believable details. In this paper, we show how a fully probabilistic model that is trained end-toend can play the role of such an artist by synthesizing 32×32 face images depicted in the middle column of Figure 1. Our super resolution model comprises two components that are trained jointly: a conditioning network, and a prior network. The conditioning network effectively maps a low resolution image to a distribution over corresponding high resolution images, while the prior models high resolution details to make the outputs look more realistic. Our conditioning network consists of a deep stack of ResNet [10] blocks, while our prior network comprises a PixelCNN [28] architecture.\nWe find that standard super resolution metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (pSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) fail to properly measure the quality of predictions for an underspecified super resolution task. These metrics prefer conservative blurry averages over more plausible photo realistic details, as new fine details often do not align exactly with the original details. Our evaluation studies demonstrate that humans easily distinguish real images from super resolution predictions when regression techniques are used, but they have a harder time telling our samples apart from real images."

      "text" : "Super resolution has a long history in computer vision [22]. Methods relying on interpolation [11] are easy to implement and widely used, however these methods suffer from a lack of expressivity since linear models cannot express complex dependencies between the inputs and outputs. In practice, such methods often fail to adequately predict high frequency details leading to blurry high resolution outputs.\nEnhancing linear methods with rich image priors such as sparsity [2] or Gaussian mixtures [35] have substantially improved the quality of the methods; likewise, leveraging low-level image statistics such as edge gradients improves predictions [31, 26, 6, 12, 25, 17]. Much work has been done on algorithms that search a database of patches and combine them to create plausible high frequency details in zoomed images [7, 13]. Recent patch-based work has focused on improving basic interpolation methods by building a dictionary of pre-learned filters on images and selecting the appropriate patches by an efficient hashing mechanism [23]. Such dictionary methods have improved the inference speed while being comparable to state-of-the-art.\nAnother approach for super resolution is to abandon inference speed requirements and focus on constructing the\nhigh resolution images at increasingly higher magnification factors. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) represent an approach to the problem that avoids explicit dictionary construction, but rather implicitly extracts multiple layers of abstractions by learning layers of filter kernels. Dong et al. [5] employed a three layer CNN with MSE loss. Kim et al. [16] improved accuracy by increasing the depth to 20 layers and learning only the residuals between the high resolution image and an interpolated low resolution image. Most recently, SRResNet [18] uses many ResNet blocks to achieve state of the art pSNR and SSIM on standard super resolution benchmarks–we employ a similar design for our conditional network and catchall regression baseline.\nInstead of using a per-pixel loss, Johnson et al.[14] use Euclidean distance between activations of a pre-trained CNN for model’s predictions vs. ground truth images. Using this so-called preceptual loss, they train feed-forward networks for super resolution and style transfer. Bruna et al. [3] also use perceptual loss to train a super resolution network, but inference is done via gradient propagation to the low-res input (e.g., [9]).\nLedig et al. [18] and Yu et al. [33] use GANs to create compelling super resolution results showing the ability of the model to predict plausible high frequency details. Sønderby et al. [15] also investigate GANs for super resolution using a learned affine transformation that ensures the models only generate images that downscale back to the low resolution inputs. Sønderby et al. [15] also explore a masked autoregressive model like PixelCNN [27] but without the gated layers and using a mixture of gaussians instead of a multinomial distribution. Denton et al. [4] use a multi-scale adversarial network for image synthesis, but the architecture also seems beneficial for super resolution.\nPixelRNN and PixelCNN by Oord et al. [27, 28] are probabilistic generative models that impose an order on image pixels representing them as a long sequence. The probability of each pixel is then conditioned on the previous ones. The gated PixelCNN obtained state of the art log-likelihood scores on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, making it one of the most competetive probabilistic generative models.\nSince PixelCNN uses log-likelihood for training, the model is highly penelized if negligible probability is assigned to any of the training examples. By contrast, GANs only learn enough to fool a non-stationary discriminator. One of their common failure cases is mode collapsing were samples are not diverse enough [21]. Furthermore, GANs require careful tuning of hyperparameters to ensure the discriminator and generator are equally powerful and learn at equal rates. PixelCNNs are more robust to hyperparameter changes and usually have a nicely decaying loss curve. Thus, we adopt PixelCNN for super resolution applications."

      "text" : "We aim to learn a probabilistic super resolution model that discerns the statistical dependencies between a high resolution image and a corresponding low resolution image. Let x and y denote a low resolution and a high resolution image, where y∗ represents a ground-truth high resolution image. In order to learn a parametric model of pθ(y | x), we exploit a large dataset of pairs of low resolution inputs and ground-truth high resolution outputs, denoted D ≡ {(x(i),y∗(i))}Ni=1. One can easily collect such a large dataset by starting from a set of high resolution images and lowering their resolution as much as needed. To optimize the parameters θ of the conditional distribution p, we maximize a conditional log-likelihood objective defined as,\nO(θ | D) = ∑\n(x,y∗)∈D\nlog p(y∗ | x) . (1)\nThe key problem discussed in this paper is the exact form of p(y | x) that enables efficient learning and inference, while generating realistic non-blurry outputs. We first discuss pixel-independent models that assume that each output pixel is generated with an independent stochastic process given the input. We elaborate why these techniques result in sub-optimal blurry super resolution results. Finally we describe our pixel recursive super resolution model that generates output pixels one at a time to enable modeling the statistical dependencies between the output pixels using PixelCNN [27, 28], and synthesizes sharp images from very blurry input."

      "text" : "The simplest form of a probabilistic super resolution model assumes that the output pixels are conditionally independence given the inputs. As such, the conditional distribution of p(y | x) factorizes into a product of independent pixel predictions. Suppose an RGB output y has M pixels each with three color channels, i.e., y ∈ R3M . Then,\nlog p(y | x) = 3M∑ i=1 log p(yi | x) . (2)\nTwo general forms of pixel prediction models have been explored in the literature: Gaussian and multinomial distributions to model continuous and discrete pixel values respectively. In the Gaussian case,\nlog p(yi | x) = − 1\n2δ2 ‖yi − Ci(x)‖22 − log\n√ 2δ2π , (3)\nwhere Ci(x) denotes the ith element of a non-linear transformation of x via a convolutional neural network.

Often the variance is not learned, in\nHow the dataset was created\nwhich case maximizing the conditional log-likelihood of (1) reduces to minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between yi and Ci(x) across the pixels and channels throughout the dataset. Super resolution models based on MSE regression (e.g., [5, 16, 18]) fall within this family of pixel independent models, where the outputs of a neural network parameterize a set of Gaussians with fixed bandwidth.\nAlternatively, one could use a flexible multinomial distribution as the pixel prediction model, in which case the ouput dimensions are discretized into K possible values (e.g., K = 256) where yi ∈ {1, . . . ,K}. The pixel prediction model based on a multinomial softmax operator is represented as, log p(yi = k | x) = wjkTCi(x)−log K∑ v=1 exp{wjvTCi(x)} , (4) where {wjk}3,Kj=1,k=1 denote the softmax weights for different color channels and different discrete values."

      "heading" : "3.2. Synthetic multimodal task",
      "text" : "To demonstrate how the above pixel independent models can fail at conditional image modeling, we created a synthetic dataset that is explicitly multimodal. For many generative tasks like super resolution, colorization, and depth estimation, models that are able to predict a mode without averaging effects are desirable. For example, in coloriza-\ntion, selecting a strong red or blue for a car is better than selecting a sepia toned average of all of the colors of cars that the model has been exposed to. In this synthetic task, the input is an MNIST digit (1st row of Figure 2), and the output is the same input digit but scaled and translated either into the upper left corner or upper right corner (2nd and 3rd rows of Figure 2). The dataset has an equal ratio of upper left and upper right outputs, which we call the MNIST corners dataset.\nA convolutional network using per pixel squared error loss (Figure 2, L2 Regression) produces two blurry figures. Replacing the continuous loss with a per-pixel crossentropy produces crisper images but also fails to capture the stochastic bimodality because both digits are shown in both corners (Figure 2, cross-entropy). In contrast, a model that explicitly deals with multi-modality, PixelCNN stochastically predicts a digit in the upper-left or bottom-right corners but never predicts both digits simultaneously (Figure 2, PixelCNN).\nSee Figure 5 for examples of our super resolution model predicting different modes on a realistic dataset.\nAny good generative model should be able to make sharp single mode predictions and a dataset like this would be a good starting point for any new models."

      "heading" : "4. Pixel recursive super resolution",
      "text" : "The main issue with the previous probabilistic models (Equations (3) and (4)) for super resolution is the lack of conditional dependency between super resolution pixels. There are two general methods to model statistical correlations between output pixels. One approach is to define the conditional distribution of the output pixels jointly by either a multivariate Gaussian mixture [36] or an undirected graphical model such as conditional random fields [8]. With these approaches one has to commit to a particular form of statistical dependency between the output pixels, for which inference can be computationally expensive. The second approach that we follow in this work, is to factorize the conditional distribution using chain rule as,\nlog p(y | x) = M∑ i=1 log p(yi | x,y<i) , (5)\nwhere the generation of each output dimension is conditioned on the input, previous output pixels, and the previous channels of the same output pixel. For simplicity of exposition, we ignore different output channels in our derivations, and use y<i to represent {y1, . . . ,yi−1}. The benefits of this approach is that the exact form of the conditional dependencies is flexible and the inference is straightforward. Inspired by the PixelCNN model, we use a multinomial distribution to model discrete pixel values in Eq. (5). Alternatively, one could use an autoregressive prediction model\nwith Gaussian or Logistic (mixture) conditionals as proposed in [24].\nOur model, outlined in Figure 3, comprises two major components that are fused together at a late stage and trained jointly: (1) a conditioning network (2) a prior network. The conditioning network is a pixel independent prediction model that maps a low resolution image to a probabilistic skeleton of a high resolution image, while the prior network is supposed to add natural high resolution details to make the outputs look more realistic.\nGiven an input x ∈ RL, let Ai(x) : RL → RK denote a conditioning network predicting a vector of logit values corresponding to the K possible values that the ith output pixel can take. Similarly, let Bi(y<i) : Ri−1 → RK denote a prior network predicting a vector of logit values for the ith output pixel. Our probabilistic model predicts a distribution over the ith output pixel by simply adding the two sets of logits and applying a softmax operator on them,\np(yi | x,y<i) = softmax(Ai(x) +Bi(y<i)) . (6)\nTo optimize the parameters of A and B jointly, we perform stochastic gradient ascent to maximize the conditional log likelihood in (1). That is, we optimize a cross-entropy loss between the model’s predictions in (6) and discrete\nground truth labels y∗i ∈ {1, . . . ,K},\nO1 = ∑\n(x,y∗)∈D M∑ i=1 ( 1[y∗i ] T (Ai(x) +Bi(y ∗ <i))\n− lse(Ai(x) +Bi(y∗<i)) ) , (7)\nwhere lse(·) is the log-sum-exp operator corresponding to the log of the denominator of a softmax, and 1[k] denotes a K-dimensional one-hot indicator vector with its kth dimension set to 1.\nOur preliminery experiments indicate that models trained with (7) tend to ignore the conditioning network as the statistical correlation between a pixel and previous high resolution pixels is stronger than its correlation with low resolution inputs. To mitigate this issue, we include an additional loss in our objective to enforce the conditioning network to be optimized. This additional loss measures the cross-entropy between the conditioning network’s predictions via softmax(Ai(x)) and ground truth labels. The total loss that is optimized in our experiments is a sum of two cross-entropy losses formulated as,\nO2 = ∑\n(x,y∗)∈D M∑ i=1 ( 1[y∗i ] T (2Ai(x) +Bi(y ∗ <i))\n− lse(Ai(x) +Bi(y∗<i))− lse(Ai(x)) ) . (8)\nOnce the network is trained, sampling from the model is straightforward. Using (6), starting at i = 1, first we sample a high resolution pixel. Then, we proceed pixel by pixel, feeding in the previously sampled pixel values back into the network, and draw new high resolution pixels. The three channels of each pixel are generated sequentially in turn.\nWe additionally consider greedy decoding, where one always selects the pixel value with the largest probability and sampling from a tempered softmax, where the concentration of a distribution p is adjusted by using a temperature parameter τ > 0,\npτ = pτ\n‖pτ‖1 .\nTo control the concentration of our sampling distribution p(yi | x,y<i), it suffices to multiply the logits from A and B by a parameter τ . Note that as τ goes towards∞, the distribution converges to the mode1, and sampling converges to greedy decoding."

The last layer uses a 1×1 convolution to increase the channels to 256×3 and uses the resulting activations to predict a multinomial distribution over 256 possible sub-pixel values via a softmax operator.\nThis network provides the ability to absorb the global structure of the image in the marginal probability distribution of the pixels.

Sampling sub-pixels independently will mix the assortment of distributions.\nThe prior network provides a way to tie together the subpixel distributions and allow us to take samples dependent on each other. We use 20 gated PixelCNN layers with 32 channels at each layer. We leave conditioning until the late stages of the network, where we add the pre-softmax activations from the conditioning network and prior network before computing the final joint softmax distribution.\nOur model is built by using TensorFlow [1] and trained across 8 GPUs with synchronous SGD updates.

The first dataset is a version of the CelebA dataset [19] composed of a set of celebrity faces, which are cropped around the face. In the second dataset LSUN Bedrooms [32], images are center cropped. In both datasets we resize the images to 32×32 with bicubic interpolation and again to 8×8, constituting the output and input pairs for training and evaluation. We present representative super resolution examples on held out test sets and report human evaluations of our predictions in Table 1.\nWe compare our results with two baselines: a pixel independent L2 regression (“Regression”) and a nearest neighbors search (“NN“). The architecture used for the regression baseline is identical to the conditioning network used in our model, consisting of several ResNet blocks and upsampling convolutional layers, except that the baseline regression model outputs three channels and has a final tanh(·) non-linearity instead of ReLU. The regression architecture is similar in design to to SRResNet [18], which reports state of the art scores in image similarity metrics. Furthermore, we train the regression network to predict super resolution residuals instead of the actual pixel values. The residuals are computed based on bicubic interpolation of the input, and are known to work better to provide superior predictions [16]. The nearest neighbors baseline searches the downsampled training set for the nearest example (using eu-\nclidean distance) and returns its high resolution counterpart."

      "text" : "Sampling from the model multiple times results in different high resolution images for a given low resolution image (Figure 5). A given model will identify many plausible high resolution images that correspond to a given lower resolution image. Each one of these samples may contain distinct qualitative features and each of these modes is contained within the PixelCNN. Note that the differences between samples for the faces dataset are far less drastic than seen in our synthetic dataset, where failure to cleanly predict modes meant complete failure.\nThe quality of samples is sensitive to the softmax temperature. When the mode is sampled (τ = ∞) at each subpixel, the samples are of poor quality, they look smooth with horizontal and vertical line artifacts. Sampling at τ = 1.0, the exact probability given by the model, tend to be more jittery with high frequency content. It seems in this case there are multiple less certain trajectories and the samples\njump back and forth between them–perhaps this is alleviated with more capacity and training time. Manually tuning the softmax temperature was necessary to find good looking samples–usually a value between 1.1 and 1.3 worked.\nIn Figure 6 are various test predictions with their negative log probability scores listed below each image. Smaller scores means the model has assigned that image a larger probability mass. The greedy, bicubic, and regression faces are preferred by the model despite being worse quality. This is probably because their smooth face-like structure doesn’t contradict the learned distributions. Yet sampling with the proper softmax temperature nevertheless finds realistic looking images."

We quantified the prediction accuracy of our model compared to ground truth using pSNR and MS-SSIM (Table 1). We found that our own visual assessment of the predicted image quality did not correspond to these image similarities metrics. For instance, bicubic interpolation achieved relatively high metrics even though the samples appeared quite poor. This result matches recent observations that suggest that pSNR and SSIM provide poor judgements of super resolution quality [18, 14] when new details are synthesized.\nTo ensure that samples do indeed correspond to the lowresolution input, we measured how consistent the high resolution output image is with the low resolution input image (Table 1, ’consistency’). Specifically, we measured the L2 distance between the low-resolution input image and a bicubic downsampled version of the high resolution estimate. Lower L2 distances correspond to high resolutions that are more similar to the original low resolution image. Note that the nearest neighbor high resolution images are less consistent even though we used a database of 3 million training images to search for neighbors in the case of LSUN bedrooms. In contrast, the bicubic resampling and the PixelCNN upsampling methods showed consistently better consistency with the low resolution image.

We explored this underspecified problem using small images, demonstrating that even the smallest 8×8 images can be enlarged to sharp 32×32 images. We introduced a toy dataset with a small number of explicit modes to demonstrate the failure cases of two common pixel independent likelihood models. In the presented model, the conditioning network gets us most of the way towards predicting a high-resolution image, but the outputs are blurry where the model is uncertain. Combining the conditioning network with a PixelCNN model provides a strong prior over the output pixels, allowing the model to generate crisp predications. Our human evaluations indicate that samples from our model on average look more photo realistic than a strong regression based conditioning network alone."

A low resolution image may correspond to multiple plausible high resolution images, thus modeling the super resolution process with a pixel independent conditional model often results in averaging different details– hence blurry edges. By contrast, our model is able to represent a multimodal conditional distribution by properly modeling the statistical dependencies among the high resolution image pixels, conditioned on a low resolution input. We employ a PixelCNN architecture to define a strong prior over natural images and jointly optimize this prior with a deep conditioning convolutional network. Human evaluations indicate that samples from our proposed model look more photo realistic than a strong L2 regression baseline.",
