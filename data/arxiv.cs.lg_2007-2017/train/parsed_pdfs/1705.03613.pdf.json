      "text" : "Let I = {x1, x2… xn} be an instance with n number of data points, and each data point is characterized by m variables: xi = {xi,1, xi,2, . . . xi,m}. The aim of the k-means [1] is to group these data points into the k disjoint subsets Si (0≤i≤k), such that minimize the sum of squared Euclidean distances to the mean of each subset (SSEDM) as its objective function. For number k, input instance I, and partitioning solution S, where S = S1 ∪ S2 ∪ . . . ∪ Sk, SSEDM can be defined as following equation:\n\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDC46) = \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC40 (\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC46, \uD835\uDC58) = ∑ \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC56) \uD835\uDC58 \uD835\uDC56 =1 (1)\nWhere SSEDM(Si) is partial SSEDM of cluster Si and can be defined as following equation:\n\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC56) = ∑ dis(\uD835\uDC43, \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B(\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC56)) 2 ∀\uD835\uDC43∈\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC56 (2)\n1 Department of Computer Engineering, University of Bonab.\nEmail: h.ismkhan@bonabu.ac.ir, esmkhan@gmail.com\nAlthough exactly minimizing SSEDM can not guarantee the best quality for clustering solution [2], and exactly minimizing this function is an NP-Hard problem [3], not only this function is popular to measure quality of clustering solutions, it is also used as an objective function in the kmeans, which is one of the most influential data mining algorithms [4]. The k-means operates instructions as follows: (1) select k number of points as initial centers, (2) assign each data point to its nearest center, (3) updates location of centers, (4) repeat instructions 2 and 3 until convergence. The k-means can effectively minimize SSEDM for instances with linearly separable clusters [18], but it is too sensitive to initial centers. Therefore, many initialization methods are proposed in the literature. References [5] [6] propose an initialization method, namely Maxmin, which chooses the first center randomly, and in the rest, it selects a data point with largest distance to its nearest center as a new center.\nAmong famous initialization methods, k-means++ [7] is one of the most accurate algorithm and easy to be implemented. k-means++ chooses the first center, among data points of data set, randomly. It chooses a data point x ∈ X as the i-th center with probability \uD835\uDC37(\uD835\uDC4B)2\n∑ \uD835\uDC37(\uD835\uDC4B)2\uD835\uDC65∈\uD835\uDC4B , where D(x)\ndenotes the shortest distance from a data point to the closest center we have already chosen. As the main aim of the k-means is to minimize SSEDM, this paper proposes a novel method. It is based on the concept of useful centers of each data point. Results of performed experiments shows how it can outperform k-means++ on real world datasets."

The concept of useful nearest center: a center C is useful for a data point P, if it is not a useless nearest center of P.\nExample 3.1. In Figure. 1, C1 and C2 are useful center for P. C3 is closer to P than C1, but C3 is not a useful center for P, because C2 causes that definition 2 does not meet for P and C3.\nThe proposed initialization method, selects the first center with the smallest value on the first axis,\nthen in each of next iterations, a data point P with the largest value of\naverage ∀\uD835\uDC50∈\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC43 (\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC60(\uD835\uDC43,\uD835\uDC50))\nmax ∀\uD835\uDC50∈\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC43\n(\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC60(\uD835\uDC43,\uD835\uDC50)) ×\n∑ ln(\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC60(\uD835\uDC43, \uD835\uDC50))∀\uD835\uDC50∈\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC43 is selected as the next center, where UNCP is the set of useful nearest centers of P.

The proposed method is based on the concept of useful nearest center which is defined for each data point. After each iteration, when a new center is added, the list of useful nearest center of each data point is updated. During each iteration, a data point with the largest amount of a value, which is depends on distance from its nearest center, is selected as the next center. In comparison to the random kmeans and k-means++, not only the proposed algorithm has acceptable runtime, it obtain better SSEDM with high gap from the random k-means and k-means++."
