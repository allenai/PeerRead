Techniques are presented for handling various types of complicating plan features. These include plans with context-dependent consequences, indirect consequences, actions with preconditions that must be true during the execution of an action, contingencies, multiple levels of abstraction, multiple execution agents with partially·ordered and temporally overlapping actions, and plans which reference specific times and time durations.",
