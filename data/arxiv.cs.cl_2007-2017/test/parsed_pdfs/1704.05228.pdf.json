      "text" : "Prominent applications of sentiment analysis are countless, including areas such as marketing, customer service and communication. The conventional bag-ofwords approach for measuring sentiment merely counts term frequencies; however, it neglects the position of the terms within the discourse. As a remedy, we thus develop a discourse-aware method that builds upon the discourse structure of documents. For this purpose, we utilize rhetorical structure theory to label (sub-)clauses according to their hierarchical relationships and then assign polarity scores to individual leaves. To learn from the resulting rhetoric structure, we propose a tensor-based, tree-structured deep neural network (named RST-LSTM) in order to process the complete discourse tree. The underlying attention mechanism infers the salient passages of narrative materials. In addition, we suggest two algorithms for data augmentation (node reordering and artificial leaf insertion) that increase our training set and reduce overfitting. Our benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. Ultimately, this work advances the status quo in natural language processing by developing algorithms that incorporate semantic information.\nKeywords: Sentiment analysis, Rhetorical structure theory, Discourse tree, Tree-structured network, Long short-term memory, Attention mechanism\n∗Corresponding author.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "User-generated content reveals personal opinions towards entities such as products, services or events, which can benefit organizations and businesses in improving their marketing, communication, production and procurement. In this context, sentiment analysis facilitates the extraction of subjective information from user-generated content, or narrative materials in general, by quantifying the positivity or negativity of natural language [1, 2]. Among the many applications of sentiment analysis are tracking customer opinions [3], evaluating survey responses [4], mining user reviews [5, 6, 7], trading upon financial news [8, 9] and predicting sales [6, 10].\nSentiment analysis traditionally utilizes bag-of-words approaches, which merely\ncount the frequency of words (and tuples thereof) to obtain a mathematical representation of documents in matrix form [1, 2]. As such, these approaches are not capable of taking into consideration semantic relationships between sections and sentences of a document. Let us, for instance, consider the following two examples, which express opposite polarities: “the movie was [good]+, although reviews are [bad]−” and “the movie was [bad]−, although reviews are [good]+”. Both constitute identical representations in näıve bag-of-words models, which are unable to account for information regarding semantics and discourse.\nA remedy to this problem may be found in the form of n-grams, which construct tuples of n contiguous words from a text and thus incorporate the contextual information of words into the representation of text [11]. Here research commonly utilizes n-grams of size two (bi-grams) and three (tri-grams), which are often enriched with additional features such as part-of-speech [1]. This approach allows for implicitly formalizing dependencies between adjacent words. Specific use cases are the detection of negation scopes, e. g. “not bad”, or compound nouns, e. g. “computer science”. Yet n-grams cannot encode relationships between different sections of a text. For instance, bi-grams cannot\n2\ncorrectly infer the sentiment of the previous example.1\nTo reliably analyze the sentiment of lengthy documents, it is essential to incorporate the semantic structure. A recent review in Science points out that novel techniques are required to leverage semantics [12]. Hence, we propose an innovative method, based on rhetorical structure theory (RST), that incorporates the discourse structures of natural language. RST structures documents hierarchically [13] by splitting the content into (sub-)clauses called elementary discourse units (EDUs). The EDUs are then connected to form a binary discourse tree. The edges are further labeled according to the type of discourse, for instance, whether it is an elaboration or an argument. The RST tree thus helps localize essential information within documents; e. g. the concluding section of a newspaper article is typically relevant as it reports the opinion of the author. Figure 1 illustrates the discourse tree for the previous example, in which RST renders it possible to identify the intended sentiment (i. e. the subjective statement conveyed by the main clause). Hence, the goal of this work is to develop a novel approach that identifies salient passages in a document based on their position in the discourse tree and incorporates their importance in the form of weights when computing sentiment scores.\n1Bi-grams contained in the first example are “The movie”, “movie was”, “was [good]+”, “[good]+ although”, “although reviews”, “reviews are”, “are [bad]−”. The second example includes the bi-grams “The movie”, “movie was”, “was [bad]−”, “[bad]− although”, “although reviews”, “reviews are”, “are [good]+”. Hence, the vector representations differ for each sentence, but both still suggest the same, albeit false, neutral rating.\n3\nPrevious research has demonstrated that discourse-related information can successfully improve the performance of sentiment analysis (see Section 2 for details). For instance, one can reweigh the importance of passages based on their relation type [14] or depth [15] in the discourse tree. Some methods prune the discourse trees at certain thresholds to yield a tree of fixed depth, e. g. 2 or 4 levels [15]. Other approaches train machine learning classifiers based on the relation types as input features [16]. What the previous references have in common is that they try to map the tree structure onto mathematically simpler representations, since it is virtually impossible to encode unstructured data of arbitrary complexity in a fixed-length vector.\nWe overcome the limitations of previous works and propose a specific neural network, named RST-LSTM, for representation learning. The RST-LSTM utilizes multiple tensors to build an attention mechanism that can localize salient passages within documents by following the discourse structure. In contrast to previous works, the RST-LSTM is thus capable of exploiting the complete structure of the discourse tree. In addition, we propose two techniques for data augmentation that facilitate training and yield higher predictive accuracy.\nIn brief, our approach is as follows: we utilize rhetorical structure theory to represent the semantic structure of a document in the form of a hierarchical discourse tree. We then follow a dictionary-based approach to obtain sentiment scores for each leaf. The resulting tree is subsequently traversed by the RST-LSTM, thereby aggregating the sentiment scores based on the discourse structure in order to compute a sentiment score at document level. This approach thus weighs the importance of (sub-)clauses based on their position and relation in the discourse tree, which is learned during the training phase. As a consequence, this allows us to improve sentiment analysis with discourse information.\nThe RST-LSTM also differs from the attention mechanism in [17], which can only exploit the relation type and not the hierarchy. Furthermore, former approaches are based on traditional recursive neural networks, which are limited by the fact that they can persist information for only a few iterations [18].\n4\nTherefore, these methods struggle with complex discourses, while ours can handle even very deep tree structures.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews discourse parsing and RST-based sentiment analysis. To overcome the limitations of previous approaches, Section 3 introduces the RST-LSTM, as well as our algorithms for data augmentation. Section 4 describes our experimental setup, for which we evaluate the performance of our deep learning methods in comparison to common baselines (Section 5). Section 6 concludes with a summary and suggestions for future research."

      "text" : "Rhetorical structure theory formalizes the discourse in narrative materials by organizing sub-clauses, sentences and paragraphs into a hierarchy [13]. The premise is that a document is split into elementary discourse units, which constitute the smallest, indivisible segments. These EDUs are then connected by one of 18 different relation types, which represent edges in the discourse tree; see Table 1 for a list [19]. Each relation is further labeled by a hierarchy type, i. e. either as a nucleus (N) or a satellite (S), where a nucleus denotes a more essential unit of information, while a satellite indicates a supporting or background unit of information. We note that this hierarchy type is not necessarily an exclusive-or, since both children can be labeled as nuclei or satellites at the same time. Figure 2 presents an example of a discourse tree.\n5\n6\nPrevious research has proposed various methods for automating the parsing of discourse trees of documents. Common implementations for documents consisting of multiple paragraphs are represented by the high-level discourse analyzer HILDA [20] and the DPLP parser [21], of which the DPLP parser currently achieves the better F1-score in identifying relation types . Since this is regarded as the most challenging subtask of RST parsing, we specifically decided to utilize the DPLP parser in this work."

      "heading" : "2.2. Sentiment analysis with RST",
      "text" : "Previous studies have advocated different approaches for sentiment analysis\nthat utilize the discourse tree; see Table 2.\nThe underlying sentiment scores of EDUs are almost exclusively calculated on the basis of pre-defined sentiment dictionaries. Common examples include\n7\nSentiWordNet [22, 19, 14, 16], hand-crafted dictionaries [23] or domain-specific dictionaries [15]. A recent approach calculates ex ante vector representations for the EDUs based on word embeddings [17]. This essentially resembles a high-dimensional dictionary that is, consistent with the pre-defined dictionaries, applied prior to learning the weights of the classifier. For reasons of comparability, we also utilize a dictionary-based approach in order to compute sentiment features from the content of elementary discourse units.\nAmong the most common methods are simple weighting rules that aggregate the sentiment scores of EDUs based on the tree structure [19, 14]. However, the weights are frequently pre-determined and hand-crafted. A different stream of research also considers hierarchy labels (nucleus or satellite) of the nodes and updates the weights based on these. Examples include approaches that focus on the top-split (i. e. the root node) of the discourse tree and scale the relative importance based on (hand-crafted) weights [23, 19, 14]. The underlying weights can also be optimized using logistic regression [24]. In contrast, other works specifically focus on the hierarchy labels at leaf level, arguing that this choice facilitates a more fine-grained evaluation [14], while neglecting the discourse tree from above. To fill the gap between top-level and leaf-level analysis, recent research also applies a recursive weighting scheme that utilizes a scaling factor to diminish the influence of increasing depth [14, 15]. Alternatively, one can prune the discourse tree at certain thresholds in order to yield a tree of fixed depth, e. g. 2 or 4 levels [15]. Some works also incorporate relation types between EDUs [19, 24, 14] or categorize them into contrastive or non-contrastive relations, which are then weighted separately [22].\nThe papers discussed above predominantly consider depth-related information of the RST nodes. Accordingly, they neglect the links between nodes within the tree structure. A potential remedy is to traverse the RST tree with a recursive neural network [25]; however, this approach only incorporates the edges and lacks information regarding the relation type. Closest to our work is an approach that traverses the RST tree with the help of a recursive neural network, while utilizing relation-specific composition matrices in order to build an\n8\nattention mechanism [17]. However, the recursive neural network is known to struggle with complex tree structures because of vanishing or exploding gradients and, instead, we utilize a long short-term memory. Moreover, the approach sums the representations in each recursion and, hence, cannot distinguish the hierarchy; i. e. between nucleus and satellite. Hence, the objective of this paper is to extend the previous works by advancing representation learning in order to incorporate the complete discourse tree, including relation types, tree depth and hierarchy labels."

      "heading" : "2.3. Representation learning for sequential and tree data",
      "text" : "Recent advances in deep neural networks have rendered it possible to learn representations of unstructured data such as sequences or text [26]. This can, for instance, be achieved by recurrent neural networks, which entail an internal architecture in the form of a directed cycle, thereby creating an internal state with which to learn dependent structures [27]. Based on these, one can process texts of arbitrary length in sequential order, while the internal state encodes the complete sequence. The underlying structure thus allows for the passage of information from one word to the next. However, in practice, information only persists for a few iterations [18]. A viable remedy is provided by the long shortterm memory (LSTM) network. These enhance recurrent neural networks by capturing long dependencies among input signals [28]. We thus utilize LSTMs as part of our baselines later, as well as inside all tree-structured networks.\nPrevious research has proposed a Tree-LSTM that can deal with representation learning, for instance for trees from RST, and we thus rely upon it as another baseline. This tree-structured LSTM network traverses trees bottomup in order to generate representations of the underlying structure [29]. The Tree-LSTM computes a representation for each parent node based on its immediate children and does so recursively until the root of the tree is reached. It thereby stacks individual LSTMs such that they reflect the tree structure from the input. However, the Tree-LSTM provides no possibility of incorporating additional information from the discourse trees, such as the relation type.

      "text" : "We draw upon the Tree-LSTM as a baseline, since it is widely regarded as the status quo for tree learning [29]. The Tree-LSTM takes a discourse tree as input and then processes EDU features while incorporating their position in the tree. For this purpose, it stacks individual LSTMs in the form of that tree (cf.\n12\nFigure 4) and adapts the ideas of both a memory cell and gates from traditional LSTMs, but extends these concepts to tree structures [29]. Here the underlying LSTM helps to overcome the problem of exploding gradients.\nIn the Tree-LSTM, each node j from the discourse tree is translated into a single LSTM unit, which comprises an input gate ij , an output gate oj , a memory cell cj and hidden state hj . In contrast to the standard LSTM, the Tree-LSTM contains not a single forget gate, but one forget gate fjk for each child k. This allows each parent node to recursively compute a representation from its immediate children. The input vectors to each LSTM unit are given by the hidden state hk and the memory cell ck from each child k ∈ C(j), where C(j) is the set of children of parent j. This layout of arranging connections renders it possible for the Tree-LSTM to pass information upward in the tree, since every node can incorporate selected information from each child-LSTM. Figure 5 details the connection between the gates in a Tree-LSTM.\n13\nOur experiments later compare the performance of two different architectures of Tree-LSTM models, namely, the child-sum and N -ary Tree-LSTM [29]. Both are common in research, but vary in their connections between input and output gates. The former, the child-sum Tree-LSTM, sums the hidden states hk from the children k ∈ C(j) in order to obtain a single input to the hidden state h̃parent of the parent. This approach loses any information regarding the order of the children, since it uses the same weights U (i), U (f), U (o) and U (u) for all children. In contrast, the N -ary Tree-LSTM requires a fixed, pre-defined number of N = |C(j)| children for each inner node. It then combines the child nodes by weighting their hidden states based on parameters U (i) m , U (f) km , U (o) m and U (u) m dependent on the index m = 1, . . . , N of the child.\n14\nMathematically, the child-sum Tree-LSTM transition equations are defined\nas\nh̃j = ∑\nk∈C(j)\nhk, (2)\nij = sigmoid ( W (i)xj + U (i)h̃j + b (i) ) , (3)\nfjk = sigmoid ( W (f)xj + U (f)hk + b (f) ) , (4)\noj = sigmoid ( W (o)xj + U (o)h̃j + b (o) ) , (5)\nuj = tanh ( W (u)xj + U (u)h̃j + b (u) ) , (6)\ncj = ij uj + ∑\nk∈C(j)\nfjk ck, (7)\nhj = oj tanh(cj), (8)\nwhere denotes the element-wise multiplication. Moreover, the above equations contain the weights W (i), W (f), W (o), W (u) and b(i), b(f), b(o), b(u) that must be learned from the data. Similarly, the N -ary Tree-LSTM obtains its memory cell and hidden state via\nij = sigmoid ( W (i)xj +\nN∑ m=1 U (i)m hjm + b (i)\n) , (9)\nfjk = sigmoid ( W (f)xj +\nN∑ m=1 U (f) kmhjm + b (f)\n) , (10)\noj = sigmoid ( W (o)xj +\nN∑ m=1 U (o)m hjm + b (o)\n) , (11)\nuj = tanh ( W (u)xj +\nN∑ m=1 U (u)m hjm + b (u)\n) , (12)\ncj = ij uj + N∑ m=1 fjm cjm, (13) hj = oj tanh(cj). (14)\nIn order to make sentiment predictions from the Tree-LSTM at the root\n15\nnode, we introduce an additional feedforward classification layer. Here we utilize a softmax classifier that predicts a class label y from the hidden state hroot of the root node. The softmax layer entails further weights W (s) and b(s), based on which it computes the probability p(ŷ |hroot) of the tree belonging to class ŷ via\ny = arg max ŷ p(ŷ | hroot) = arg max ŷ\nsoftmax ( W (s) hroot + b (s) ) , (15)\nwith the negative log-likelihood of the true class label y as the cost function [26]."

We then select an LSTMρi for each node depending on its relation type ρi.\nWe incorporate the hierarchy type τi (i. e. nucleus or satellite) by additionally weighting the cell state cj and the hidden state hj before they enter the above tensor-based LSTM. For this purpose, we introduce tensor-based weights\nW (c) = [ W\n(c) nucleus;W (c) satellite\n] , (16)\nW (h) = [ W\n(h) nucleus;W (h) satellite\n] . (17)\nWe then choose the weights according to the hierarchy type τi in the tree. This allows us to additionally discriminate the influence of nuclei and satellites.\nAccordingly, the RST-LSTM must simultaneously optimize both the tensorbased LSTM, as well as the hierarchy-related tensors W (c) and W (h) based on a combined objective function. We thus rearrange them as rank-3 tensors as follows: let W (x)[r, :] indicate the weight tensor for relation type r and W (x)[l, :] denote the weight tensor for a hierarchy type l ∈ {nucleus, satellite}. On this basis, we now specify the new, updated equations for calculating the cell and\n17\nhidden state. As such, the child-sum RST-LSTM computes\nĥj = W (h)[l, :]hj , (18) ĉj = W (c)[l, :] cj , (19)\nh̃j = ∑\nk∈C(j)\nĥk, (20)\nij = sigmoid ( W (i)xj + U (i)[r, :] h̃j + b (i)[r, :] ) , (21)\nfjk = sigmoid ( W (f)xj + U (f)[r, :] ĥk + b (f)[r, :] ) , (22)\noj = sigmoid ( W (o)xj + U (o)[r, :] h̃j + b (o)[r, :] ) , (23)\nuj = tanh ( W (u)xj + U (u)[r, :] h̃j + b (u)[r, :] ) , (24)\ncj = ij uj + ∑\nk∈C(j)\nfjk ĉk, (25)\nhj = oj tanh(cj). (26)\nSimilarly, the N -ary RST-LSTM computes its representations via\nĥj = W (h)[l, :]hj , (27) ĉj = W (c)[l, :] cj , (28)\nij = sigmoid ( W (i)xj +\nN∑ m=1 U (i)m [r, :] ĥjm + b (i)[r, :]\n) , (29)\nfjk = sigmoid ( W (f)xj +\nN∑ m=1 U (f) km [r, :] ĥjm + b (f)[r, :]\n) , (30)\noj = sigmoid ( W (o)xj +\nN∑ m=1 U (o)m [r, :] ĥjm + b (o)[r, :]\n) , (31)\nuj = tanh ( W (u)xj +\nN∑ m=1 U (u)m [r, :] ĥjm + b (u)[r, :]\n) , (32)\ncj = ij uj + N∑ m=1 fjm ĉjm, (33) hj = oj tanh(cj). (34)\n18\nAs a result, both the N -ary and child-sum RST-LSTM integrate the complete discourse tree into the neural network. As opposed to the works in the literature review, this approach allows us to encode both the relation type and the hierarchy type."

A viable remedy is to artificially increase the number of training samples in order to better tune parameters. Such approaches are common in computer vision, where one extracts different crops from the same image and later considers each as a training instance. We thus propose similar techniques for tree structures that enlarge our training set. These algorithms take a tree as input and then slightly modify its structure in each epoch of training (one full training cycle on the training set). The first variant, called node reordering, swaps sub-trees, while the second, artificial leaf insertion, randomly exchanges a leaf for a node with two new children."

That is, the text passages inside the nodes must keep their original order since the content might otherwise change its meaning or grammatical structure. Our approach thus randomly chooses an inner node n and relocates it to the position of its sibling m in the tree. The sibling m is then moved down the tree and becomes a child of n. Afterwards, the previous position of n is filled by one of its former children. As a result, the order of l, r and m from left to right is unchanged. The corresponding algorithm for an inner node n is sketched in Figure 7.\nAltogether, this approach for data augmentation tries to modify the structure slightly, thereby generating potentially different representations of the same tree. The extent of reordering depends on the level of n, since a reordering of\n19\na node at a higher level usually has a larger effect on the overall tree structure compared to a node at a lower level."

The näıve benchmark with tf-idf features yields\n24\na balanced accuracy of 0.746 and an F1-score of 0.763. The approach with tffeatures, as well as the LSTM, achieves a similar performance. Here we see no clear indication that one of the baselines is consistently superior to another.\nWhen comparing the pruned RST trees, we observe that a higher pruning depth also increases the predictive performance. For instance, the best results stem from an RST tree pruned at level 4, thereby obtaining a balanced accuracy of 0.758 and an F1-score of 0.753. However, this still ranges below the bestperforming näıve benchmarks. Moreover, the inclusion of the relation type ρR diminishes the predictive power compared to the approach with only sentiment scores [σN , σS ], amounting to a decrease of 0.007 in the balanced accuracy and 0.006 in the F1-score.\nThe simple tree learning based on the Tree-LSTM outperforms all of the previous benchmarks. It achieves a balanced accuracy of up to 0.774 and an F1-score of 0.781. Nevertheless, the Tree-LSTM is further surpassed by the RST-LSTM, which achieves an equal balanced accuracy of 0.777, but boosts the F1-score to 0.796.

However, the N -ary models usually benefit more strongly from data augmentation due to their additional degrees of freedom. By comparing the underlying algorithms for data augmentation, the results indicate a greater increase in predictive power from leaf insertion as compared to node reordering. Yet the best performing models generally facilitate both techniques, which is not surprising given that the dataset consists of only 2000 samples.

In response to such shortcomings, we decided to draw upon a long short-term memory.\nWe proceed as follows in order to specifically evaluate the attention mechanism itself and leave all other parameters unchanged (i. e. identical to the\n27\nprevious experiments). That is, we feed the networks by utilizing EDU-level features that originate from the previous dictionary-based sentiment scores. The performance measurements indicate that the resulting predictive accuracy is inferior to the RST-LSTM.

Figure 9 compares the normalized weights of the tensors U (u) m across different relation types m. The values result from using a child-sum RST-LSTM without data augmentation. Overall, the tensor weights between both datasets are highly correlated. The corresponding correlation coefficient stands at 0.640, statistically significant at the 99 % level. However, we observe large differences in the relative importance across the relation types. For instance, relation types such as background and textual-organization entail only a marginal importance, consistent with initial expectations. In contrast, the joint relation yields among the highest weights across both datasets.\n29\nWith regard to the hierarchy-related tensors, we find a greater importance (i. e. higher weights) for nuclei, as compared to satellites. For instance, the IMDb movie reviews lead to a nucleus weight of 0.738, whereas the weight of satellites totals a mere 0.588. This is in keeping with our intuition and the idea of RST since, in most cases, nuclei are more essential to the writer’s purpose than satellites.\nFigure 10 illustrates the attention mechanism with an example movie review drawn from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. Here we color the text according to the attention values inside the child-sum RST-LSTM without data augmentation. A darker text color refers to more essential pieces of information. For instance, the RST-LSTM assigns among the highest relevance to the passage “the plot is deceptively simple”, whereas “a popular-but-slow jock to run” ranges among the lowest.\n30\nThe above discussion confirms that the tensors build an attention mechanism that learns to weight the importance of sentences based on their position and relations in the discourse tree. As a result, the RST-LSTM can localize the relevant parts of the document and ascertain the relative importance of sentiment scores"

      "heading" : "6. Conclusion",
      "text" : "Deep learning for natural language predominantly builds upon sequential models such as LSTMs in order to incorporate context. While these models usually achieve a high predictive power when applied to short texts, the complexity of linguistic discourse hampers performance in relation to longer documents. As a remedy, our paper proposes an innovative, discourse-aware approach: we first parse the semantic structure based on rhetorical structure theory, thereby mapping the document onto a discourse tree that encodes its storyline. We then\n31\napply tailored tree-structured deep neural networks with an additional attention mechanism that enables us to directly learn the complete discourse tree. Each of the architectures entails more than 10,000 parameters, empowering the models to learn highly non-linear relationships.\nOur findings reveal that our RST-LSTM substantially outperforms the baselines. For instance, the best-performing RST-LSTMs achieve an improvement of 4.33 % and 3.16 % in the F1-score for both datasets as compared to using word features. These gains are partially owed to our techniques for data augmentation, which slightly alter existing trees in order to enlarge the size of the training set. Evidently, data augmentation presents a viable option to reduce the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, the underlying attention mechanism learns the relative importance of passages based on their position in the discourse tree. This facilitates insights into which discourse units convey essential pieces of information. Altogether, our work contributes to research in the field of text mining by advancing deep learning methods towards including semantic information when processing natural language.\nFuture research could benefit from a neural network in which the dictionarybased approach is replaced by sentiment scores that are learned from the content itself. For instance, one could think of an alternating approach where, in one step, the algorithm trains the RST-LSTM and, in every second step, optimizes an autoencoder based on the content of the EDUs. This could theoretically yield additional improvements in the predictive performance."

The conventional bag-ofwords approach for measuring sentiment merely counts term frequencies; however, it neglects the position of the terms within the discourse. As a remedy, we thus develop a discourse-aware method that builds upon the discourse structure of documents. For this purpose, we utilize rhetorical structure theory to label (sub-)clauses according to their hierarchical relationships and then assign polarity scores to individual leaves. To learn from the resulting rhetoric structure, we propose a tensor-based, tree-structured deep neural network (named RST-LSTM) in order to process the complete discourse tree. The underlying attention mechanism infers the salient passages of narrative materials. In addition, we suggest two algorithms for data augmentation (node reordering and artificial leaf insertion) that increase our training set and reduce overfitting. Our benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. Ultimately, this work advances the status quo in natural language processing by developing algorithms that incorporate semantic information.",
