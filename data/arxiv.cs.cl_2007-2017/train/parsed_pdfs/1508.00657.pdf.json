      "text" : "At the heart of natural language parsing is the challenge of representing the “state” of an algorithm— what parts of a parse have been built and what parts of the input string are not yet accounted for—as it incrementally constructs a parse. Traditional approaches rely on independence assumptions, decomposition of scoring functions, and/or greedy approximations to keep this space manageable. Recently, continuous-state parsers have been proposed, in which the state is embedded as a vector (Titov and Henderson, 2007; Stenetorp, 2013; Chen and Manning, 2014; Dyer et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2015). Dyer et al. reported state-of-the-art performance on English and Chinese benchmarks using a transitionbased parser whose continuous-state embeddings were constructed using LSTM recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and estimated using backpropagation.\nSince morphology provides strong clues for parsing morphologically rich languages (Balles-\nteros, 2013), our primary extension takes the idea of continuous-state parsing a step farther to be include sensitive to word forms (in past work, continuous-state parsers consistently made use of vector embeddings of words that were independent of the form of the word). When estimated from distributional statistics, such vectors tend to learn a certain amount of syntactic and semantic information, leading (in a parser) to statistical sharing across “nearby” elements of the lexicon. However, these embeddings are oblivious to morphology; morphological variants will only be embedded close together if they are observed in similar contexts with sufficient frequency. Rich inflective morphology implies a greater diversity of surface forms, resulting in sparse data and poor estimates. Our solution to this problem is to reparameterize word embeddings using the same RNN machinery used in the parser: a word’s vector is calculated based on the sequence of orthographic symbols representing it (§3).\nAlthough this model is provided no supervision in the form of explicit morphological annotation, we find that it gives a large performance increase when parsing morphologically rich languages in the SPMRL datasets (Seddah et al., 2013; Seddah and Tsarfaty, 2014), especially in agglutinative languages and the ones that present extensive case systems. Further, this modification does not harm parser performance for other languages, and even improves when parsing without POS tags. Interestingly, we find that character-based word embeddings in some cases obviate explicit POS information. Taken together, these findings suggest that such representations are able to capture important morphosyntactic information from word strings. Runtime is minimally impacted, and the parser is quite fast.\nFinally, since the Dyer et al. (2015) parser used only a simple arc-standard parsing algorithm, it could not produce nonprojective trees. We present\nar X\niv :1\n50 8.\n00 65\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nA ug\n2 01\n5\na parallel improvement to the parser by including a SWAP operation (Nivre, 2009) (§2.4), enabling the parser to produce nonprojective dependencies which are often found in morphologically rich languages."

      "text" : "We begin by reviewing the parsing approach of Dyer et al. (2015) on which our work is based.\nLike most transition-based parsers, Dyer et al.’s parser can be understood as the sequential manipulation of three data structures: a buffer B initialized with the sequence of words to be parsed, a stack S containing partially-built parses, and a list A of actions previously taken by the parser. In particular the parser implements the arc-standard parsing algorithm (Nivre, 2004).\nAt each time step t, a transition action is applied that alters these data structures by pushing or popping words from the stack and the buffer; the operations are listed in Figure 1.\nAlong with the discrete transitions above, the parser calculates a vector representation of the states of B, S, and A; at time step t these are denoted by bt, st, and at, respectively. The total parser state at t is given by\npt = max {0,W[st;bt;at] + d} (1)\nwhere the matrix W and the vector d are learned parameters. This continuous-state representation pt is used to decide which operation to apply next, updating B, S, and A (Figure 1).\nWe elaborate on the design of bt, st, and at using RNNs in §2.1, on the representation of partial parses in S in §2.2, and on the parser’s decision mechanism in §2.3. We discuss the inclusion of SWAP in §2.4."

      "heading" : "2.1 Stack LSTMs",
      "text" : "RNNs are functions that read a sequence of vectors incrementally; at time step t the vector xt is read in and the hidden state ht computed using xt and the previous hidden state ht−1. In principle, this allows retaining information from time steps in the distant past, but the nonlinear “squashing” functions applied in the calcluation of each ht result in a decay of the error signal used in training with backpropagation. LSTMs are a variant of RNNs designed to cope with this “vanishing gradient” problem using an extra memory “cell” (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013).\nPast work explains the computation within an LSTM through the metaphors of deciding how much of the current input to pass into memory (it) or forget (ft). We refer interested readers to the original papers and present only the recursive equations updating the memory cell ct and hidden state ht given xt, the previous hidden state ht−1, and the memory cell ct−1:\nit = σ(Wixxt +Wihht−1 +Wicct−1 + bi)\nft = 1− it ct = ft ct−1+\nit tanh(Wcxxt +Wchht−1 + bc) ot = σ(Woxxt +Wohht−1 +Wocct + bo)\nht = ot tanh(ct),\nwhere σ is the component-wise logistic sigmoid function and is the component-wise (Hadamard) product. Parameters are all represented using W and b. This formulation differs slightly from the classic LSTM formulation in that it makes use of “peephole connections” (Gers et al., 2002) and defines the forget gate so that it sums with the input gate to 1 (Greff et al., 2015). To improve the representational capacity of LSTMs (and RNNs generally), they can be stacked in “layers.” In these architectures, the input LSTM at higher layers at time t is the value of ht computed by the lower layer (and xt is the input at the lowest layer).\nThe stack LSTM augments the left-to-right sequential model of the conventional LSTM with a stack pointer. As in the LSTM, new inputs are added in the right-most position, but the stack pointer indicates which LSTM cell provides ct−1 and ht−1 for the computation of the next iterate. Further, the stack LSTM provides a pop operation that moves the stack pointer to the previous element. Hence each of the parser data structures (B, S, and A) is implemented with its own stack LSTM, each with its own parameters. The values of bt, st, and at are the ht vectors from their respective stack LSTMs."

      "text" : "Whenever a REDUCE operation is selected, two tree fragments are popped off of S and combined to form a new tree fragment, which is then popped back onto S (see Figure 1). This tree must be embedded as an input vector xt.\nTo do this, Dyer et al. (2015) use a recursive neural network gr (for relation r) that composes\nthe representations of the two subtrees popped from S (we denote these by u and v), resulting in a new vector gr(u,v) or gr(v,u), depending on the direction of attachment. The resulting vector embeds the tree fragment in the same space as the words and other tree fragments. This kind of composition was thoroughly explored in prior work (Socher et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013b; Hermann and Blunsom, 2013; Socher et al., 2013a); for details, see Dyer et al. (2015)."

Letting A(S,B) denote the set of allowed transitions given the stack S and buffer S (i.e., those where preconditions are met; see Figure 1), the probability of action z ∈ A(S,B) defined using a log-linear distribution:\np(z | pt) = exp\n( g>z pt + qz )∑ z′∈A(S,B) exp ( g>z′pt + qz′\n) (2) (where gz and qz are parameters associated with each action type z).\nParsing proceeds by always choosing the most probable action from A(S,B). The probabilistic definition allows parameter estimation for all of the parameters (W∗, b∗ in all three stack LSTMs, as well as W, d, g∗, and q∗) by maximizing the conditional likelihood of each correct parser decisions given the state."

In order to deal with nonprojective trees, we also add the SWAP operation which allows nonprojective trees to be produced.\nThe SWAP operation, first introduced by Nivre (2009) can produce nonprojective trees with a\ntransition-based parser. In Dyer et al. (2015)’s parser, besides the oracle transitions, the inclusion of the SWAP operation requires breaking the linearity of the stack by removing tokens that are not at the top of the stack, however this is easily handled with the stack LSTM. Figure 1 shows how the parser is capable of moving words from the stack (S) to the buffer (B), breaking the linear order of words. Since a node that is swapped may have already been assigned as the head of a dependent, the buffer (B) can now also contain tree fragments."

This mapping can be shown schematically as in Figure 2.\n1Dyer et al. (2015), included a third input representation learned from a neural language model (w̃LM).

Following (Ling et al., 2015), we compute character-based representations which are calculated as continuous-space vector embeddings representing the words based on bidirectional LSTMs (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005). When the parser initiates the learning process and populates the buffer with all the words from the sentence, it reads the words character by character from left to right and computes a continuous-space vector embedding the character sequence, which is the h vector of the LSTM; we denote it by → w. The same process is applied in reverse, computing a similar continuous-space vector embedding starting from the last character and finishing at the first one ( ← w); again each character is represented with an LSTM cell. After that, we concatenate these vectors and a (learned) representation of their tag to produce the representation w. As in §3.1, a linear map (V) is applied and passed through a component-wise ReLU.\nx = max { 0,V[ → w; ← w; t] + b } This process is shown schematically in Figure 3.\nNote that under this representation, out-ofvocabulary words are treated as bidirectional LSTM encodings and thus they will be “close” to other words that the parser has seen during training, ideally close to their more frequent morphological relatives. We conjecture that this will give a clear advantage over a single “UNK” token for all the words that the parser does not see during training, as done by Dyer et al. (2015) and other parsers without additional resources. In §4 we confirm this hypothesis."

The results of Chinese, English and Turkish7 are calculated excluding punctuation symbols, as is the common practice in those treebanks; while the results in the rest are calculated including punctuation symbols for evaluation. The left hand side of the tables shows the results for the model that only use words forms ([Words] and [Char-based]), the parser is run simply by using the words that it can find in the training sets. The right hand of the table shows the results when we include the POS tags in the model ([Words + POS] and [Char-based + POS]).\nThe first conclusion to extract from the set of experiments is that the model really improves for Basque, Hungarian, Korean, Polish, and Turkish.\nBasque, Hungarian, Turkish, and Korean are agglutinative languages, and in these four languages [Char-based + POS] is superior than [Words + POS]. For Arabic there is a slight improvement as well. In fact, in Arabic, Basque, Korean, and Turkish [Char-based] is better than [Char-based + POS] and [Words + POS]. For the rest, we believe that the character-based representations helped a lot when the POS tags were not present since both POS tags and character-based representations approximate the same kind of information, but once the POS tags are included the character-based representations become less effective.\nIt is also worth noting that the character-based representations are always useful when the POS tags are not present ([Words] vs. [Char-based]), which means that the character-based representations are capable of learning similar information as the POS tags.\n7In the CoNLL-X Shared Task, they used eval.pl which calculates scores without punctuation symbols, while in the SPMRL Shared task used eval07.pl which includes punctuation for evaluation.\nIt is common practice to encode morphological information in the POS tags; for instance, the English treebank includes tense and number (NNS: singular noun or VBD: verbs in past tense) and even if our character-based representations are capable of encoding the same kind of information, the POS tags suffice for high accuracy. However, in morphologically rich languages, the POS tags do not seem to be enough.\nSwedish, English, and French use suffixes for the verb tenses and number,8 while Hebrew\n8Tense and number features provide little improvement in\npresents more prepositional particles rather than grammatical case. Tsarfaty (2006) and Cohen and Smith (2007) claimed that for Semitic languages, such as Hebrew, determining the correct morphological segmentation is dependent on syntactic context; our character-based representations are capturing the same kind of information and learning it from syntactic context. Chinese morphology is mainly represented by syllables that can even stand alone as different words, nonetheless the character-based representations are still\na transition-based parser, compared with other features such as case, when the POS tags are included (Ballesteros, 2013).\nuseful for Chinese. Finally, on average the parser is always better with character-based representations, regardless of whether POS tags are included; the best model for UAS is [Char-based], while the best model for LAS is [Char-based + POS]. We conclude that character-based representations have a positive role to play in statistical parsers."

Under these conditions, we see large performance\ndrops in languages with high OOV rates: Korean drops 15.5 LAS (6,708 OOVs out of 25,265 tokens in the development set); Hungarian drops 5.5 LAS (5,955 OOVs out of 29,970 tokens). Others show a much smaller drop: French (1,252 OOVs out of 38,603 tokens) drops 0.8 LAS. Table 3 shows all the results.\nInterestingly, this artificially impoverished model is still consistently better than [Words] for all languages (e.g., for Korean, by 4 LAS). This implies that not all of the improvement is due to OOV words; statistical sharing across orthographically close words is beneficial, as well.\nIncluding POS tags, [Char-based + POS] is also better for most languages but, as expected, the improvements are not that high. The highest one is Hungarian with 5.14 LAS points of improvement (71.02 vs 76.16) in the development set. Basque drops 3.49 LAS points (2,541 OOVs out of 13,840 tokens).

In this paper, we demonstrate that they are useful for transition-based dependency parsing, since they are capable of capturing morphological information crucial for analyzing syntax.\nThe improvements provided by the characterbased representations using bidirectional LSTMs are strong for agglutinative languages, such as Basque, Hungarian, Korean, and Turkish, since the inclusion of POS tags is not sufficient. This outcome is important, since annotating morphological information for a treebank is expensive; our model suggests that only dependency annotations are necessary and morphological features can be learned from strings.\nThe character-based representations are also a way of overcoming the out-of-vocabulary problem; without any additional resources, they enable the parser to substantially improve the performance when OOV rates are high. We expect that, in conjunction with a pretraing regime, or in\nconjunction with distributional word embeddings, further improvements could be realized."

Starting with a highperformance transition-based parser that uses long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks to learn representations of the parser state, we replace lookup based word representations with representations constructed based on the orthographic representations of the words, also using LSTMs. This allows statistical sharing across word forms that are similar on the surface. Experiments for morphologically rich languages show that the parsing model benefits from incorporating the character-based encodings of words.",
