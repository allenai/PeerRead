      "text" : "Distributed word representations, or word embeddings, have been successfully used in many NLP applications (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013). Traditionally, word representations have been obtained using countbased methods (Baroni et al., 2014), where the cooccurrence matrix is derived directly from corpus counts (Lin, 1998) or using association measures like Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990) and Positive PMI (PPMI) (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Levy et al., 2014).\nTechniques for generating lower-rank representations have also been employed, such as PPMI-SVD (Levy et al., 2015) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), both achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.\n∗This is a preprint of the paper that will be presented at the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.\nAlternatively, vector-space models can be generated with predictive methods, which generally outperform the count-based methods (Baroni et al., 2014), the most notable of which is Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS, Mikolov et al. (2013b)), which uses a neural network to generate embeddings. It implicitly factorizes a shifted PMI matrix, and its performance has been linked to the weighting of positive and negative co-occurrences (Levy and Goldberg, 2014).\nIn this paper, we present Lexical Vectors (LexVec), a method for factorizing PPMI matrices that combines characteristics of all these methods. On the one hand, it uses SGNS window sampling, negative sampling, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize a loss function that weights frequent co-occurrences heavily but also takes into account negative co-occurrence. However, since PPMI generally outperforms PMI on semantic similarity tasks (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007), rather than implicitly factorize a shifted PMI matrix (like SGNS), LexVec explicitly factorizes the PPMI matrix.\nThis paper is organized as follows: First, we describe PPMI-SVD, GloVe, and SGNS (§2) before introducing the proposed method, LexVec (§3), and evaluating it on word similarity and analogy tasks (§4). We conclude with an analysis of results and discussion of future work.\nWe provide source code for the model at https: //github.com/alexandres/lexvec."

      "text" : "Given a word w and a symmetric window of win context words to the left and win to the right, the co-occurrence matrix of elements Mwc is defined as the number of times a target word w and the context word c co-occurred in the corpus within the window. The PMI matrix is defined as\nPMIwc = log Mwc M∗∗ Mw∗ M∗c\n(1)\nwhere ’*’ represents the summation of the corresponding index. As this matrix is unbounded in the inferior limit, in most applications it is replaced by its positive definite version, PPMI, where negative values are set to zero. The performance of the PPMI matrix on word similarity tasks can be further improved by using context-distribution smoothing (Levy et al., 2015) and subsampling the corpus (Mikolov et al., 2013b). As word embeddings with lower dimensionality may improve efficiency and generalization (Levy et al., 2015), the improved PPMI∗ matrix can be factorized as a product of two lower rank matrices.\nPPMI∗wc ≃ WwW̃ ⊤ c (2)\nwhere Ww and W̃c are d-dimensional row vectors corresponding to vector embeddings for the target and context words. Using the truncated SVD of size d yields the factorization UΣT⊤ with the lowest possible L2 error (Eckert and Young, 1936).\nLevy et al. (2015) recommend using W = UΣp\nas the word representations, as suggested by Bullinaria and Levy (2012), who borrowed the idea of weighting singular values from the work of Caron (2001) on Latent Semantic Analysis. Although the optimal value of p is highly task-dependent (Österlund et al., 2015), we set p = 0.5 as it has been shown to perform well on the word similarity and analogy tasks we use in our experiments (Levy et al., 2015)."

The\nloss function for factorization is\nLGloV ewc = 1\n2 f(M̂wc)(WwW̃\n⊤ c +bw+ b̃c−log M̂wc) 2\n(3) where bw and b̃c are bias terms, and f is a weighting function defined as\nf(x) =\n{\n(x/xmax) β if x < xmax 1 otherwise (4)\nW and W̃ are obtained by iterating over all non-zero (w, c) cells in the co-occurrence matrix and minimizing eq. (3) through SGD.\nThe weighting function (in eq. (3)) penalizes more heavily reconstruction error of frequent cooccurrences, improving on PPMI-SVD’s L2 loss, which weights all reconstruction errors equally. However, as it does not penalize reconstruction errors for pairs with zero counts in the co-occurrence matrix, no effort is made to scatter the vectors for these pairs."

Window sampling ensures the factorization weights frequent co-occurrences heavily, but also takes into account negative co-occurrences, thanks to negative sampling.\n1Following Mikolov et al.

      "heading" : "3 LexVec",
      "text" : "LexVec is based on the idea of factorizing the PPMI matrix using a reconstruction loss function that does not weight all errors equally, unlike SVD, but instead penalizes errors of frequent cooccurrences more heavily, while still treating negative co-occurrences, unlike GloVe. Moreover, given that using PPMI results in better performance than PMI on semantic tasks, we propose keeping the SGNS weighting scheme by using window sampling and negative sampling, but explicitly factorizing the PPMI matrix rather than implicitly factorizing the shifted PMI matrix. The LexVec loss function has two terms\nLLexV ecwc = 1\n2 (WwW̃c\n⊤\n− PPMI∗wc) 2 (6)\nLLexV ecw = 1\n2\nk ∑\ni=1\nEwi∼Pn(w)(WwW̃wi ⊤ − PPMI∗wwi) 2\n(7)\nWe minimize eqs. (6) and (7) using two alternative approaches: Mini-Batch (MB): This variant executes gradient descent in exactly the same way as SGNS. Every time a pair (w, c) is observed by window sampling and pairs (w,w1...k) drawn by negative sampling, Ww, W̃c, and W̃w1...k are updated by gradient descent on the sum of eq.(6) and eq.(7). The global loss for this approach is\nLLexV ec = ∑\n(w,c)\n#(w, c) (LLexV ecwc +L LexV ec w ) (8)\nwhere #(w, c) is the number of times (w, c) is observed in the subsampled corpus. Stochastic (St): Every context window is extended with k negative samples w1...k. Iterative gradient descent of eq. (6) is then run on pairs (w, cj), for j = 1, .., 2∗win and (w, ci), j = 1, .., k for each window. The global loss for this approach is\nLLexV ec ′ = ∑\n(w,c)\n#(w, c)LLexV ecwc +\n∑\nw\n#(w)LLexV ecw\n(9)\nwhere #(w) is the number of times w is observed in the subsampled corpus.\nIf a pair (w, c) co-occurs frequently, #(w, c) will weigh heavily in both eqs. (8) and (9), giving the desired weighting for frequent co-occurrences. The noise term, on the other hand, has corrections proportional to #(w) and #(wi), for each pair (w,wi). It produces corrections in pairs that due to frequency should be in the corpus but are not observed, therefore accounting automatically for negative cooccurrences."

      "text" : "All models were trained on a dump of Wikipedia from June 2015, split into sentences, with punctuation removed, numbers converted to words, and lower-cased. Words with less than 100 counts were removed, resulting in a vocabulary of 302,203 words. All models generate embeddings of 300 dimensions.\nThe PPMI* matrix used by both PPMI-SVD and LexVec was constructed using smoothing of α = 3/4 suggested in (Levy et al., 2015) and an unweighted window of size 2. A dirty subsampling of the corpus is adopted for PPMI* and SGNS with threshold of t = 10−5 (Mikolov et al., 2013b).2 Additionally, SGNS uses 5 negative samples (Mikolov et al., 2013b), a window of size 10 (Levy et al., 2015), for 5 iterations with initial learning rate set to the default 0.025. GloVe is run with a window of size 10, xmax = 100, β = 3/4, for 50 iterations and initial learning rate of 0.05 (Pennington et al., 2014).\nIn LexVec two window sampling alternatives are compared: WSPPMI , which keeps the same fixed size win = 2 as used to create the PPMI∗ matrix; or WSSGNS , which adopts identical SGNS settings (win = 10 with size randomization). We run LexVec for 5 iterations over the training corpus.\nAll methods generate both word and context matrices (W and W̃ ): W is used for SGNS, PPMI-SVD and W+W̃ for GloVe (following Levy et al. (2015), and W and W + W̃ for LexVec.\nFor evaluation, we use standard word similarity and analogy tasks (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Levy et al., 2014; Pennington et al., 2014; Levy et al., 2015). We examine, in particular, if LexVec weighted PPMI∗ factorization outperforms SVD, GloVe (weighted\n2Words with unigram relative frequency f > t are discarded from the training corpus with probability pw = 1− √ t/f .\nfactorization of log M̂ ) and Skip-gram (implicit factorization of the shifted PMI matrix), and compare the stochastic and mini-batch approaches.\nWord similarity tasks are:3 WS-353 Similarity (WSim) and Relatedness (WRel) (Finkelstein et al., 2001), MEN (Bruni et al., 2012), MTurk (Radinsky et al., 2011), RW (Luong et al., 2013), SimLex999 (Hill et al., 2015), MC (Miller and Charles, 1991), RG (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965), and SCWS (Huang et al., 2012), calculated using cosine. Word analogy tasks are: Google semantic (GSem) and syntactic (GSyn) (Mikolov et al., 2013a) and MSR syntactic analogy dataset (Mikolov et al., 2013c), using 3CosAdd and 3CosMul (Levy et al., 2014)."

      "heading" : "5 Results",
      "text" : "Results for word similarity and for the analogy tasks are in tables 1 and 2, respectively. Compared with PPMI-SVD, LexVec performs better in all tasks. As they factorize the same PPMI∗ matrix, it is the\n3http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ mfaruqui/suite.html\nloss weighting from window sampling that is an improvement over L2 loss. As expected, due to PPMI, LexVec performs better than SGNS in several word similarity tasks, but in addition it also does so on the semantic analogy task, nearly approaching GloVe. LexVec generally outperforms GloVe on word similarity tasks, possibly due to the factorization of the PPMI matrix and to window sampling’s weighting of negative co-occurrences.\nWe believe LexVec fares well on semantic analogies because its vector-space does a good job of preserving semantics, as evidenced by its performance on word similarity tasks. We believe the poor syntactic performance is a result of the PPMI measure. PPMI-SVD also struggled with syntactic analogies more than any other task. Levy et al. (2015) obtained similar results, and suggest that using positional contexts as done by Levy et al. (2014) might help in recovering syntactic analogies.\nIn terms of configurations, WSSGNS performed marginally better than WSPPMI . We hypothesize it is simply because of the additional computation.\nWhile W and (W + W̃ ) are roughly equivalent on word similarity tasks, W is better for analogies. This is inline with results for PPMI-SVD and SGNS models (Levy et al., 2015). Both mini-batch and stochastic approaches result in similar scores for all tasks. For the same parameter k of negative samples, the mini-batch approach uses 2 ∗ winWSPPMI times more negative samples than stochastic when using WSPPMI , and winWSSGNS times more samples when using WSSGNS. Therefore, the stochastic approach is more computationally efficient while delivering similar performance."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion and Future Work",
      "text" : "In this paper, we introduced LexVec, a method for low-rank, weighted factorization of the PPMI matrix that generates distributed word representations, favoring low reconstruction error on frequent co-occurrences, whilst accounting for negative cooccurrences as well. This is in contrast with PPMISVD, which does no weighting, and GloVe, which only considers positive co-occurrences. Finally, its PPMI factorization seems to better capture semantics when compared to the shifted PMI factorization of SGNS. As a result, it outperforms PPMI-SVD and SGNS in a variety of word similarity and semantic analogy tasks, and generally outperforms GloVe on similarity tasks.\nFuture work will examine the use of positional contexts for improving performance on syntactic analogy tasks. Moreover, we will explore further the hyper-parameter space to find globally optimal values for LexVec, and will experiment with the factorization of other matrices for developing alternative word representations."
