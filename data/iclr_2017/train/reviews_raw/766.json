{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Pedestrian Detection Based On Fast R-CNN and Batch Normalization ", "abstract": "Most of the pedestrian detection methods are based on hand-crafted features which produce low accuracy on complex scenes. With the development of deep learning method, pedestrian detection has achieved great success. In this paper, we take advantage of a convolutional neural network which is based on Fast R-CNN framework to extract robust pedestrian features for efficient and effective pedestrian detection in complicated environments. We use the EdgeBoxes algorithm to generate effective region proposals from an image, as the quality of extracted region proposals can greatly affect the detection performance. In order to reduce the training time and to improve the generalization performance, we add a batch normalization layer between the convolutional layer and the activation function layer. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves satisfactory performance on the INRIA and ETH datasets.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper presents experimental results from an EdgeBoxes + Fast R-CNN detector on the task of localizing pedestrians. It uses an AlexNet (CaffeNet) backbone architecture modified to include batch normalization. Experimental results are presented on the INRIA and ETH datasets.\n\nPros\n- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow\n\nCons\n- The paper's two contributions are too minor to merit publication\n- Experimental results should include at least the Caltech pedestrian dataset but likely also the KITTI pedestrian dataset\n- Recent work from ECCV 2016 [a], with superior results and much more experimental evaluation, is not cited or discussed\n\nMy rating is due primarily to the lack luster contributions. The first claimed contribution is the use of EdgeBoxes as proposals for pedestrian detection. Unless the result of this choice produced a truly surprising experimental result, this is simply too minor to be considered a contribution. Moreover, if this choice is important, then the paper should justify it by showing that other proposal methods (of which there are a great many in addition to Selective Search and Edge Boxes) are worse performing in some regard (speed, accuracy, memory, etc.). The second claimed contribution is the use of batch normalization (BN) in their network architecture. There is a case to be made that BN hasn't been explored in Fast R-CNN. However, if the goal of the paper was to thoroughly explore BN + Fast R-CNN, then why focus narrowly on pedestrian detection? Instead, it should focus more broadly on generic object category detection for which there are well established Fast R-CNN baselines on PASCAL VOC and COCO. The use of BN + Fast R-CNN only for pedestrian detection does not provide much signal about this choice. There are also potential technical issues that are not discussed. BN is typically avoided in Fast R-CNN because the batch size seen by most of the network is usually only one or two images. This is likely too few images for the naive application of BN.\n\n\n[a] \"Is Faster R-CNN Doing Well for Pedestrian Detection?\" Zhang et al.", "IS_META_REVIEW": true}, {"TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 pcs", "comments": "Four knowledgable reviewers recommend rejection due to too weak of a contribution.
