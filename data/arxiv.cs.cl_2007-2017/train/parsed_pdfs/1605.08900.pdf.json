      "text" : "Aspect level sentiment classification is a fundamental task in the field of sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012; Pontiki et al., 2014). Given a sentence and an aspect occurring in the sentence, this task aims at inferring the sentiment polarity (e.g. positive, negative, neutral) of the aspect. For example, in sentence “great food but the service was dreadful!”, the sentiment polarity of aspect “food” is positive while the polarity of aspect “service” is negative. Researchers typically use machine learning algorithms and build sentiment clas-\nsifier in a supervised manner. Representative approaches in literature include feature based Support Vector Machine (Kiritchenko et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2014) and neural network models (Dong et al., 2014; Lakkaraju et al., 2014; Vo and Zhang, 2015; Nguyen and Shirai, 2015; Tang et al., 2015a). Neural models are of growing interest for their capacity to learn text representation from data without careful engineering of features, and to capture semantic relations between aspect and context words in a more scalable way than feature based SVM.\nDespite these advantages, conventional neural models like long short-term memory (LSTM) (Tang et al., 2015a) capture context information in an implicit way, and are incapable of explicitly exhibiting important context clues of an aspect. We believe that only some subset of context words are needed to infer the sentiment towards an aspect. For example, in sentence “great food but the service was dreadful!”, “dreadful” is an important clue for the aspect “service” but “great” is not needed. Standard LSTM works in a sequential way and manipulates each context word with the same operation, so that it cannot explicitly reveal the importance of each context word. A desirable solution should be capable of explicitly capturing the importance of context words and using that information to build up features for the sentence after given an aspect word. Furthermore, a human asked to do this task will selectively focus on parts of the contexts, and acquire information where it is needed to build up an internal representation towards an aspect in his/her mind.\nIn pursuit of this goal, we develop deep memory network for aspect level sentiment classification,\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n08 90\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n8 M\nay 2\nwhich is inspired by the recent success of computational models with attention mechanism and explicit memory (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). Our approach is data-driven, computationally efficient and does not rely on syntactic parser or sentiment lexicon. The approach consists of multiple computational layers with shared parameters. Each layer is a content- and location- based attention model, which first learns the importance/weight of each context word and then utilizes this information to calculate continuous text representation. The text representation in the last layer is regarded as the feature for sentiment classification. As every component is differentiable, the entire model could be efficiently trained end-toend with gradient descent, where the loss function is the cross-entropy error of sentiment classification.\nWe apply the proposed approach to laptop and restaurant datasets from SemEval 2014 (Pontiki et al., 2014). Experimental results show that our approach performs comparable to a top system using feature-based SVM (Kiritchenko et al., 2014). On both datasets, our approach outperforms both LSTM and attention-based LSTM models (Tang et al., 2015a) in terms of classification accuracy and running speed. Lastly, we show that using multiple computational layers over external memory could achieve improved performance."

      "heading" : "2 Background: Memory Network",
      "text" : "Our approach is inspired by the recent success of memory network in question answering (Weston et al., 2014; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). We describe the background on memory network in this part.\nMemory network is a general machine learning framework introduced by Weston et al. (2014). Its central idea is inference with a long-term memory component, which could be read, written to, and jointly learned with the goal of using it for prediction. Formally, a memory network consists of a memory m and four components I , G, O and R, where m is an array of objects such as an array of vectors. Among these four components, I converts input to internal feature representation, G updates old memories with new input, O generates an output representation given a new input and the current memory state, R outputs a response based on the\noutput representation. Let us take question answering as an example to explain the work flow of memory network. Given a list of sentences and a question, the task aims to find evidences from these sentences and generate an answer, e.g. a word. During inference, I component reads one sentence si at a time and encodes it into a vector representation. Then G component updates a piece of memory mi based on current sentence representation. After all sentences are processed, we get a memory matrix m which stores the semantics of these sentences, each row representing a sentence. Given a question q, memory network encodes it into vector representation eq, and then O component uses eq to select question related evidences from memory m and generates an output vector o. Finally, R component takes o as the input and outputs the final response. It is worth noting that O component could consist of one or more computational layers (hops). The intuition of utilizing multiple hops is that more abstractive evidences could be found based on previously extracted evidences. Sukhbaatar et al. (2015) demonstrate that multiple hops could uncover more abstractive evidences than single hop, and could yield improved results on question answering and language modeling."

For example, the sentiment polarity of sentence “great food but the service was dreadful!” towards aspect “food” is positive, while the polarity towards aspect “service” is negative. When dealing with a text corpus, we map each word into a low dimensional, continuous and real-valued vector, also known as word embedding (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014). All the word vectors are stacked in a word embedding matrix L ∈ Rd×|V |, where d is the dimension of word vector and |V | is vocabulary size.

      "text" : "We present an overview of the deep memory network for aspect level sentiment classification.\nGiven a sentence s = {w1, w2, ..., wi, ...wn} and the aspect word wi, we map each word into its embedding vector. These word vectors are separated into two parts, aspect representation and context representation. If aspect is a single word like “food” or “service”, aspect representation is the embedding of aspect word. For the case where aspect is multi word expression like “battery life”, aspect representation is an average of its constituting word vectors (Sun et al., 2015). To simplify the interpretation, we consider aspect as a single word wi. Context word vectors {e1, e2 ... ei−1, ei+1 ... en} are stacked and regarded as the external memory m ∈ Rd×(n−1), where n is the sentence length.\nAn illustration of our approach is given in Figure 1, which is inspired by the use of memory network in question answering (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). Our approach consists of multiple computational layers (hops), each of which contains an attention layer and a linear layer. In the first computational layer (hop 1), we regard aspect vector as the input to adaptively select important evidences from memory m through attention layer. The output of attention layer and the linear transformation of aspect vector2 are summed and the result is considered as the input of next layer (hop 2). In a similar way, we stack multiple hops and run these steps multiple times, so that more abstractive evidences could be selected from the external\n2In preliminary experiments, we tried directly using aspect vector without a linear transformation, and found that adding a linear layer works slightly better.\nmemory m. The output vector in last hop is considered as the representation of sentence with regard to the aspect, and is further used as the feature for aspect level sentiment classification.\nIt is helpful to note that the parameters of attention and linear layers are shared in different hops. Therefore, the model with one layer and the model with nine layers have the same number of parameters."

      "heading" : "3.3 Content Attention",
      "text" : "We describe our attention model in this part. The basic idea of attention mechanism is that it assigns a weight/importance to each lower position when computing an upper level representation (Bahdanau et al., 2015). In this work, we use attention model to compute the representation of a sentence with regard to an aspect. The intuition is that context words do not contribute equally to the semantic meaning of a sentence. Furthermore, the importance of a word should be different if we focus on different aspect. Let us again take the example of “great food but the service was dreadful!”. The context word “great” is more important than “dreadful” for aspect “food”. On the contrary, “dreadful” is more important than “great” for aspect “service”.\nTaking an external memory m ∈ Rd×k and an aspect vector vaspect ∈ Rd×1 as input, the attention model outputs a continuous vector vec ∈ Rd×1. The output vector is computed as a weighted sum of each piece of memory in m, namely vec = ∑k i=1 αimi,\nwhere k is the memory size, αi ∈ [0, 1] is the weight of mi and ∑ i αi = 1. We implement a neural network based attention model. For each piece of memory mi, we use a feed forward neural network to compute its semantic relatedness with the aspect. The scoring function is calculated as follows, where Watt ∈ R1×2d and batt ∈ R1×1.\ngi = tanh(Watt[mi; vaspect] + batt) (1)\nAfter obtaining {g1, g2, ... gk}, we feed them to a softmax function to calculate the final importance scores {α1, α2, ... αk}.\nαi = exp(gi)∑k j=1 exp(gj)\n(2)\nWe believe that such an attention model has two advantages. One advantage is that this model could adaptively assign an importance score to each piece of memory mi according to its semantic relatedness with the aspect. Another advantage is that this attention model is differentiable, so that it could be easily trained together with other components in an end-to-end fashion."

      "heading" : "3.4 Location Attention",
      "text" : "We have described our neural attention framework and a content-based model in previous subsection. However, the model mentioned above ignores the location information between context word and aspect. Such location information is helpful for an attention model because intuitively a context word closer to the aspect should be more important than a farther one. In this work, we define the location of a context word as its absolute distance with the aspect in the original sentence sequence3. On this basis, we study four strategies to encode the location information in the attention model. The details are described below. • Model 1. Following Sukhbaatar et al. (2015), we calculate the memory vector mi with mi = ei vi, where means element-wise multiplication and vi ∈ Rd×1 is a location vector for word wi. Every element in vi is calculated as follows,\nvki = (1− li/n)− (k/d)(1− 2× li/n) (3) 3The location of a context word could also be measured by its distance to the aspect along a syntactic path. We leave this as a future work as we prefer to developing a purely data-driven approach without using external parsing results.\nwhere n is sentence length, k is the hop number and li is the location of wi. • Model 2. This is a simplified version of Model 1, using the same location vector vi for wi in different hops. Location vector vi is calculated as follows.\nvi = 1− li/n (4)\n• Model 3. We regard location vector vi as a parameter and compute a piece of memory with vector addition, namely mi = ei + vi. All the position vectors are stacked in a position embedding matrix, which is jointly learned with gradient descent. • Model 4. Location vectors are also regarded as parameters. Different from Model 3, location representations are regarded as neural gates to control how many percent of word semantics is written into the memory. We feed location vector vi to a sigmoid function σ, and calculatemi with element-wise multiplication: mi = ei σ(vi)."

In this work, the attention layer in one layer is essentially a weighted average compositional function, which is not powerful enough to handle the sophisticated computationality like negation, intensification and contrary in language. Multiple computational layers allow the deep memory network to learn representations of text with multiple levels of abstraction. Each layer/hop retrieves important context words, and transforms the representation at previous level into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level. With the composition of enough such transformations, very complex functions of sentence representation towards an aspect can be learned."

We compare with a top system using ngram features, parse features and lexicon features (Kiritchenko et al., 2014).\n4Available at: http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.\n(3) We compare with three LSTM models (Tang et al., 2015a)). In LSTM, a LSTM based recurrent model is applied from the start to the end of a sentence, and the last hidden vector is used as the sentence representation. TDLSTM extends LSTM by taking into account of the aspect, and uses two LSTM networks, a forward one and a backward one, towards the aspect. TDLSTM+ATT extends TDLSTM by incorporating an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) over the hidden vectors. We use the same Glove word vectors for fair comparison.\n(4) We also implement ContextAVG, a simplistic version of our approach. Context word vectors are averaged and the result is added to the aspect vector. The output is fed to a softmax function.\nExperimental results are given in Table 2. Our approach using only content attention is abbreviated to MemNet (k), where k is the number of hops. We can find that feature-based SVM is an extremely strong performer and substantially outperforms other baseline methods, which demonstrates the importance of a powerful feature representation for aspect level sentiment classification. Among three recurrent models, TDLSTM performs better than LSTM, which indicates that taking into account of the aspect information is helpful. This is reasonable as the sentiment polarity of a sentence towards different aspects (e.g. “food” and “service”) might be different. It is somewhat disappointing that in-\ncorporating attention model over TDLSTM does not bring any improvement. We consider that each hidden vector of TDLSTM encodes the semantics of word sequence until the current position. Therefore, the model of TDLSTM+ATT actually selects such mixed semantics of word sequence, which is weird and not an intuitive way to selectively focus on parts of contexts. Different from TDLSTM+ATT, the proposed memory network approach removes the recurrent calculator over word sequence and directly apply attention mechanism on context word representations.\nWe can also find that the performance of ContextAVG is very poor, which means that assigning the same weight/importance to all the context words is not an effective way. Among all our models from single hop to nine hops, we can observe that using more computational layers could generally lead to better performance, especially when the number of hops is less than six. The best performances are achieved when the model contains seven and nine hops, respectively. On both datasets, the proposed approach could obtain comparable accuracy compared to the state-of-art feature-based SVM system."

Instead, the memory network approach is simpler and evidently faster because it does not need recurrent calculators of sequence length. Our approach with nine hops is almost 15 times faster than the basic LSTM model."

While after the second hop, the weight of “dreadful” increases and finally the model correctly predict the polarity towards “service” as negative. This case shows the effects of multiple hops. However, in Table 4(b), the content-based model also gives a larger weight to “dreadful” when the target we focus on is “food”. As a result, the model incorrectly predicts the polarity towards “food” as negative. This phenomenon might be caused by the neglect of location information. From Table 5(b), we can find that the weight of “great” is increased when the location of con-\ntext word is considered. Accordingly, Model 2 predicts the correct sentiment label towards “food”. We believe that location-enhanced model captures both content and location information.

An example is “dessert was also to die for!”, where the aspect is underlined. The sentiment expression is “die for”, whose meaning could not be composed from its constituents “die” and “for”. The second factor is complex aspect expression consisting of many words, such as “ask for the round corner table next to the large window.” This model represents an aspect expression by averag-\ning its constituting word vectors, which could not well handle this situation. The third factor is sentimental relation between context words such as negation, comparison and condition. An example is “but dinner here is never disappointing, even if the prices are a bit over the top”.

One of the most successful approaches in literature is feature based SVM. Experts could design effective feature templates and make use of external resources like parser and sentiment lexicons (Kiritchenko et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2014).

    "abstractText" : "We introduce a deep memory network for aspect level sentiment classification. Unlike feature-based SVM and sequential neural models such as LSTM, this approach explicitly captures the importance of each context word when inferring the sentiment polarity of an aspect. Such importance degree and text representation are calculated with multiple computational layers, each of which is a neural attention model over an external memory. Experiments on laptop and restaurant datasets demonstrate that our approach performs comparable to state-of-art feature based SVM system, and substantially better than LSTM and attention-based LSTM architectures. On both datasets we show that multiple computational layers could improve the performance. Moreover, our approach is also fast. The deep memory network with 9 layers is 15 times faster than LSTM with a CPU implementation.",
