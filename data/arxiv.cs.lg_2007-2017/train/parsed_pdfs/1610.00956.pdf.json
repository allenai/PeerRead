      "text" : "Since humans amass more and more generally available data in the form of unstructured text it would be very useful to teach machines to read and comprehend such data and then use this understanding to answer our questions. A significant amount of research has recently focused on answering one particular kind of questions the answer to which depends on understanding a context document. These are cloze-style questions (Taylor, 1953) which require the reader to fill in a missing word in a sentence. An important advantage of such questions is that they can be generated automatically from a suitable text corpus which allows us to produce a\n∗These authors contributed equally to this work.\npractically unlimited amount of them. That opens the task to notoriously data-hungry deep-learning techniques which now seem to outperform all alternative approaches.\nTwo such large-scale datasets have recently been proposed by researchers from Google DeepMind and Facebook AI: the CNN/Daily Mail dataset (Hermann et al., 2015) and the Children’s Book Test (CBT) (Hill et al., 2015) respectively. These have attracted a lot of attention from the research community (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Kadlec et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Sordoni et al., 2016; Dhingra et al., 2016; Trischler et al., 2016b; Weissenborn, 2016; Cui et al., 2016b; Cui et al., 2016a; Li et al., 2016) with a new state-of-the-art model coming out every few weeks.\nHowever if our goal is a production-level system actually capable of helping humans, we want the model to use all available resources as efficiently as possible. Given that\n1. there is an almost unlimited amount of data that can be used for generating cloze-style question-answering datasets;\n2. it is widely accepted that more data can significantly improve performance of most models (Banko and Brill, 2001; Halevy et al., 2009);\n3. training a model takes only about two hours on the CBT or about two days on the Daily Mail dataset, the largest of the three sets, therefore these datasets are not allowing us to fully use current computing potential;\nwe believe that if the community is striving to bring the performance as far as possible, it should move its work to larger data.\nThis thinking goes in line with recent developments in the area of language modelling. For a long\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n00 95\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nO ct\n2 01\n6\ntime models were being compared on several ”standard” datasets with publications often presenting minuscule improvements in performance. Then the large-scale One Billion Word corpus dataset appeared (Chelba et al., 2014) and it allowed Jozefowicz et al. to train much larger LSTM models (Jozefowicz et al., 2016) that almost halved the state-of-the-art perplexity on this dataset.\nWe think it is time to make a similar step in the area of text comprehension. Hence we are introducing the BookTest, a new dataset very similar to the Children’s Book test but more than 60 times larger1 to enable training larger models even in the domain of text comprehension. Furthermore the methodology used to create our data can later be used to create even larger datasets when the need arises thanks to further technological progress.\nWe show that if we evaluate a model trained on the new dataset on the now standard Children’s Book Test dataset, we see an improvement in accuracy much larger than other research groups achieved by enhancing the model architecture itself (while still using the original CBT training data). By training on the new dataset, we reduce the prediction error by almost one third. On the named-entity version of CBT this brings the ensemble of our models to the level of human baseline as reported by Facebook (Hill et al., 2015). However in the final section we show in our own human study that there is still room for improvement on the CBT beyond the performance of our model."

      "text" : "A natural way of testing a reader’s comprehension of a text is to ask her a question the answer to which can be deduced from the text. Hence the task we are trying to solve consists of answering a clozestyle question, the answer to which depends on the understanding of a context document provided with the question. The model is also provided with a set of possible answers from which the correct one is to be selected2. This can be formalized as follows:\nThe training data consist of tuples (q,d, a, A), where q is a question, d is a document that contains the answer to question q, A is a set of possible answers and a ∈ A is the ground-truth answer. Both q and d are sequences of words from vocabulary\n1Therefore more than 16 times larger than the Daily Mail dataset.\n2To get open-domain question answering we can provide the whole vocabulary as a candidate list.\nW 3. We also assume that all possible answers are words from the vocabulary, that is A ⊆W . In the CBT and CNN/Daily Mail datasets it is also true that the ground-truth answer a appears in the document. This is exploited by many machine learning models (Hill et al., 2015; Kadlec et al., 2016; Sordoni et al., 2016; Dhingra et al., 2016; Trischler et al., 2016b; Cui et al., 2016b; Cui et al., 2016a; Li et al., 2016), however some do not explicitly depend on this property (Hermann et al., 2015; Kobayashi et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Weissenborn, 2016)"

For question answering this specifically means having a large number of documentquestion-answer triples available. While there is an unlimited amount of text available, coming up with relevant questions and the corresponding answers can be extremely labour-intensive if done by human annotators. There were efforts to provide such human-generated datasets, e.g. Microsoft’s MCTest (Richardson et al., 2013), however their scale is not suitable for deep learning without pretraining on other data (Trischler et al., 2016a) (such as using pre-trained word embedding vectors).\nGoogle DeepMind managed to avoid this scale issue with their way of generating documentquestion-answer triples automatically, closely followed by Facebook with a similar method.

This forces the model to rely solely on information from the context document, not being able to transfer any meaning of the named entities between documents.\nThis restricts the task to one specific aspect of context-dependent question answering which may be useful however it moves the task further from the real application scenario, where we would like the model to use all information available to answer questions. Furthermore Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2016) have suggested that this can make about 17% of the questions unanswerable even by humans. They also claim that more than a half of the question sentences are mere paraphrases or exact matches of a single sentence from the context document. This raises a question to what extent the dataset can test deeper understanding of the articles."

      "heading" : "3.1.3 Recent additions",
      "text" : "Several new datasets related to the (now almost standard) ones above emerged recently. We will now briefly present them and explain how the dataset we are introducing in this article differs from them.\nThe LAMBADA dataset (Paperno et al., 2016) is designed to measure progress in understanding common-sense questions about short stories that can be easily answered by humans but cannot be answered by current standard machine-learning models (e.g. plain LSTM language models). This dataset is useful for measuring the gap between humans and machine learning algorithms. However, by contrast to our BookTest dataset, it will not allow us to track progress towards the performance of the baseline systems or on examples where machine learning may show super-human performance. Also LAMBADA is just a diagnostic dataset and does not provide ready-to-use questionanswering training data, just a plain-text corpus which may moreover include copyrighted books making its use potentially problematic for some purposes. We are providing ready training data consisting of copyright-free books only.\nThe SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) based on Wikipedia and the Who-did-What dataset (Onishi et al., 2016) based on Gigaword news articles are factoid question-answering datasets where a multi-word answer should be extracted from a context document. This is in contrast to the previous datasets, including CNN/DM, CBT, LAMBADA and our new dataset, which require only single-word answers. Both these datasets however provide less than 130,000 training questions, two orders of magnitude less than our dataset does.\nThe Story Cloze Test (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016)\nprovides a crowd-sourced corpus of 49,255 commonsense stories for training and 3,744 testing stories with right and wrong endings. Hence the dataset is again rather small. Similarly to LAMBADA, the Story Cloze Test was designed to be easily answerable by humans.\nIn the WikiReading (Hewlett et al., 2016) dataset the context document is formed from a Wikipedia article and the question-answer pair is taken from the corresponding WikiData page. For each entity (e.g. Hillary Clinton), WikiData contain a number of property-value pairs (e.g. place of birth: Chicago) which form the datasets’s questionanswer pairs. The dataset is certainly relevant to the community, however the questions are of very limited variety with only 20 properties (and hence unique questions) covering 75% of the dataset. Furthermore many of the frequent properties are mentioned at a set spot within the article (e.g. the date of birth is almost always in brackets behind the name of a person) which may make the task easier for machines. We are trying to provide a more varied dataset.\nAlthough there are several datasets related to task we are aiming to solve, they differ sufficiently for our dataset to bring new value to the community. Its biggest advantage is its size which can furthermore be easily upscaled without expensive human annotation. Finally while we are emphasizing the differences, models could certainly benefit from as diverse a collection of datasets as possible."

This work was followed by the application of Memory Networks to the same task (Hill et al., 2015). Later three models emerged around the same time (Kobayashi et al., 2016; Kadlec et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016) including our Attention Sum Reader (AS Reader) model (Kadlec et al., 2016). The AS Reader inspired several subsequent models that use it as a sub-component in a diverse ensemble (Trischler et al., 2016b); extend it with a hierarchical structure (Sordoni et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016; Dhingra et al., 2016); compute attention over the context document for every word in the query (Cui et al., 2016b) or use two-way context-query attention mechanism for every word in the context and the query (Cui et al., 2016a) that is similar in its\nspirit to models recently proposed in different domains, e.g. (dos Santos et al., 2016) in information retrieval.

Current state of the art models (Sordoni et al., 2016; Dhingra et al., 2016; Trischler et al., 2016b; Cui et al., 2016a) improve over AS Reader’s accuracy on CBT NE and CN datasets by 1-2 percent absolute. This suggests that with current techniques there is only limited room for improvement on the algorithmic side.\nThe other possibility to improve performance is simply to use more training data. The importance of training data was highlighted by the frequently quoted Mercer’s statement that “There is no data like more data.”5 The observation that having more data is often more important than having better algorithms has been frequently stressed since then (Banko and Brill, 2001; Halevy et al., 2009).\nAs a step in the direction of exploiting the potential of more data in the domain of text comprehension, we created a new dataset called BookTest similar to, but much larger than the widely used CBT and CNN/DM datasets."

That is, we detect whether each sentence contains either a named entity or a common noun that already appeared in one of the preceding twenty sentences. This word is then replaced by a gap tag (XXXXX) in this sentence which is hence turned into a clozestyle question. The preceding 20 sentences are used as the context document. For common noun\n5Quote attributed to Robert Mercer by Fred Jelinek (Jelinek, 2004)\n6BookTest dataset can be downloaded from https:// ibm.biz/booktest-v1.\nand named entity detection we use the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) and Stanford NER (Finkel et al., 2005)7.\nThe training dataset consists of the original CBT NE and CN data extended with new NE and CN examples.

Similarly to many other models it uses attention over the document – intuitively a measure of how relevant each word is to answering the question. However while most previous models used this attention as weights to calculate a blended representation of the answer word, we simply sum the attention across all occurrences of each unique words and then simply select the word with the highest sum as the final answer.

We can also understand it as representing the set of questions to which this word may be an answer.\nSimilarly the question is read by a bidirectional GRU but in this case only the final hidden states are concatenated to form the question embedding.\nThe attention over each word in the context is then calculated as the dot product of its contextual embedding with the question embedding. This attention is then normalized by the softmax function and summed across all occurrences of each answer candidate.

      "heading" : "6 Discussion",
      "text" : "Embracing the abundance of data may mean focusing on other aspects of system design than with smaller data. Here are some of the challenges that we need to face in this situation.\nFirstly, since the amount of data is practically unlimited – we could even generate them on the fly resulting in continuous learning similar to the NeverEnding Language Learning by Carnegie Mellon University (Mitchell et al., 2015) – it is now the speed of training that determines how much data the model is able to see. Since more training data significantly help the model performance, focusing on speeding up the algorithm may be more important than ever before. This may for instance influence the decision whether to use regularization such as dropout which does seem to somewhat improve the model performance, however usually at a cost of slowing down training.\nThanks to its simplicity, the AS Reader seems to be training fast - for example around seven times faster than the models proposed by Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2016). Hence the AS Reader may be particularly suitable for training on large datasets.\nThe second challenge is how to generalize the performance gains from large data to a specific target domain. While there are huge amounts of natural language data in general, it may not be the case in the domain where we may want to ultimately apply our model.\nHence we are usually not facing a scenario of simply using a larger amount of the same training data, but rather extending training to a related domain of data, hoping that some of what the model\nlearns on the new data will still help it on the original task.\nThis is highlighted by our observations from applying a model trained on the BookTest to Children’s Book Test test data. If we move model training from joint CBT NE+CN training data9 to a subset of the BookTest of the same size (230k examples), we see a drop in accuracy of around 10% on the CBT test datasets.\nHence even though the Children’s Book Test and BookTest datasets are almost as close as two disjoint datasets can get, the transfer is still very imperfect 10. Rightly choosing data to augment the in-domain training data is certainly a problem worth exploring in future work.\nOur results show that given enough data the AS Reader was able to exceed the human performance on CBT CN reported by Facebook. However we hypothesized that the system is still not achieving its full potential so we decided to examine the room for improvement in our own small human study.\n9Note that while here we are using joint CBT NE+CN data to create an equivalent of a 230k subset of our BookTest, for most experiments on the CBT we and some other teams have used NE and CN as two separate training datasests.\n10This also suggests that the increase in accuracy when using more data that are strictly in the same domain as the original training data results in a performance increase even larger that the one we are reporting on CBT. However the scenario of having to look for additional data elsewhere is more realistic, so we are focusing this article in that direction."

However is there still potential for much further growth beyond the results we have observed?\nWe decided to explore the remaining space for improvement on the CBT by testing humans on a random subset of 50 named entity and 50 common noun validation questions that the AS Reader ensemble could not answer correctly. These questions were answered by 10 non-native English speakers from our research laboratory, each on a disjoint subset of questions.. Participants had unlimited time to answer the questions and were told that these questions were not correctly answered by a machine, providing additional motivation to prove they are better than computers. The results of the human study are summarized in Table 3. They show that a majority of questions that our system could not answer so far are in fact answerable. This suggests that 1) the original human baselines might have been underestimated, however, it might also be the case that there are some examples that can be answered by machines and not by humans; 2) there is still space for improvement.\nA system that would answer correctly every time when either our ensemble or human answered correctly would achieve accuracy over 92% percent on both validation and test NE datasets and over 96% on both CN datasets.

Yes, experiments on small datasets certainly can bring useful insights. However we believe that the community should also embrace the real-world scenario of data abundance.\nThe BookTest dataset we are proposing gives the reading-comprehension community an opportunity to make a step in that direction."

The best learning rate in our experiments was 0.0005. We minimized negative log-likelihood as the training objective.\nThe initial weights in the word-embedding matrix were drawn randomly uniformly from the interval [−0.1, 0.1]. Weights in the GRU networks were initialized by random orthogonal matrices (Saxe et al., 2014) and biases were initialized to zero. We also used a gradient clipping (Pascanu et al., 2012) threshold of 10 and batches of sizes between 32 or 256. Increasing the batch from 32 to 128 seems to significantly improve performance on the large dataset - something we did not observe on the original CBT data. Increasing the batch size much above 128 is currently difficult due to memory constraints of the GPU.\nDuring training we randomly shuffled all examples at the beginning of each epoch. To speed up training, we always pre-fetched 10 batches worth of examples and sorted them according to document length. Hence each batch contained documents of roughly the same length.\nWe also did not use pre-trained word embeddings.\nWe did not perform any text pre-processing since the datasets were already tokenized.\nDuring training we evaluated the model performance every 12 hours and at the end of each epoch and stopped training when the error on the 20k BookTest validation set started increasing.\nWe explored the hyperparameter space by training 67 different models11 The region of the parameter space that we explored together with the param-\n11Some of these models were trained on data other than the BookTest which were however very similar.\neters of the model with best validation accuracy are summarized in Table 4.\nOur model was implemented using Theano (Bastien et al., 2012) and Blocks (van Merrienboer et al., 2015).\nThe ensembles were formed by simply averaging the predictions from the constituent single models. These single models were selected using the following algorithm.\nWe started with the best performing model according to validation performance. Then in each step we tried adding the best performing model that had not been previously tried. We kept it in the ensemble if it did improve its validation performance and discarded it otherwise. This way we gradually tried each model once. We call the resulting model a greedy ensemble. We used the 20, 000 BookTest validation dataset for this procedure.\nThe algorithm was offered 10 models and selected 5 of them for the final ensemble."

This article is making a case for the community to move to larger data and as a step in that direction it is proposing the BookTest, a new dataset similar to the popular Children’s Book Test (CBT), however more than 60 times larger. We show that training on the new data improves the accuracy of our Attention-Sum Reader model on the original CBT test data by a much larger margin than many recent attempts to improve the model architecture. On one version of the dataset our ensemble even exceeds the human baseline provided by Facebook. We then show in our own human study that there is still space for further improvement.",
