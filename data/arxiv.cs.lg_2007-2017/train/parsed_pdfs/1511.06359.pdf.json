      "text" : "Sparse representation of natural signals in a certain transform domain or dictionary has been widely exploited. Various sparse signal models, such as the synthesis model [6, 12] and the transform model [27] have been studied. The popular synthesis model suggests that a signal y ∈ Rn can be sparsely represented as y = Dx + η, where D ∈ Rn×m is a synthesis dictionary, x ∈ Rm is a sparse code, and η is a small approximation error in the signal domain. Synthesis dictionary learning methods [13, 5] that adapt the dictionary\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 35\n9v 4\n[ cs\n.L G\nbased on training data typically involve a synthesis sparse coding step which is often NPhard [10], so that approximate solutions [23, 21, 8] are widely used. Various dictionary learning algorithms [13, 47, 39, 18] have been proposed and are popular in numerous applications such as denoising, inpainting, deblurring, and demosaicing [11, 19, 4]. For example, the well-known K-SVD method [5] generalizes the K-means clustering process to a dictionary learning algorithm, and alternates between updating the sparse codes of training signals (sparse coding step) and the dictionary (dictionary or codebook update step). K-SVD updates both the dictionary atoms (columns) and the non-zero entries in the sparse codes (with fixed support) in the dictionary update step using singular value decompositions (SVD). However, the dictionary learning algorithms such as K-SVD are usually computationally expensive for large-scale problems. Moreover, methods such as KSVD lack convergence guarantees, and can get easily caught in local minima, or saddle points [38].\nThe alternative transform model suggests that the signal y is approximately\nsparsifiable using a transform W ∈ Rm×n, i.e., Wy = x + e, with x ∈ Rm sparse in some sense and e a small approximation error in the transform domain (rather than in the signal domain). It is well-known that natural images are sparsifiable by analytical transforms such as the discrete cosine transform (DCT), or wavelet transform [20]. Furthermore, recent works proposed learning square sparsifying transforms (SST) [34], which turn out to be advantageous in various applications such as image denoising, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) [34, 36, 25, 26]. Alternating minimization algorithms for learning SST have been proposed with cheap and optimal updates [35].\nSince SST learning is restricted to one adaptive square transform for all the data,\nthe diverse patches of natural images may not be sufficiently sparsified in the SST model. Recent work focused on learning a union of unstructured sparsifying transforms [44, 43], dubbed OCTOBOS (for OverComplete TransfOrm with BlOck coSparsity constraint – cf. [44]), to sparsify images with diverse contents, features and textures. Given a signal y ∈ Rn and a union of transforms {Wk}Kk=1, where each Wk ∈ Rm×n, the OCTOBOS model selects the best matching transform for y as the one providing the minimum transform-domain modeling error. The OCTOBOS sparse coding problem is the following:\n(P0) min 1≤k≤K min xk ∥∥Wk y − xk∥∥22 s.t. ∥∥xk∥∥0 ≤ s ∀ k, where xk denotes the sparse representation for y in the transform Wk, the `0 “norm” counts the number of non-zeros in a vector, and s is a given sparsity level. However, learning such an unstructured OCTOBOS model [44] (that has many free parameters) especially from noisy or limited data could suffer from overfitting to noise/artifacts, thereby degrading performance in various applications and inverse problem settings.\nInstead, in this paper, we consider the use of transformation symmetries to constrain\nthe multiple learned transforms, thus reducing the number of free parameters and avoiding overfitting. While previous works exploited transformation symmetries in\nsynthesis model sparse coding [45], and applied rotational operators with analytical transforms [53], the usefulness of the rotational invariance property in learning adaptive sparse signal models has not been explored. Here, we propose a Flipping and Rotation Invariant Sparsifying Transform (FRIST) learning scheme, and show that it can provide better sparse representations by capturing the “optimal” orientations of patches in natural images. As such, it serves as an effective regularizer for image recovery in various inverse problems. Preliminary experiments in this paper show the usefulness of adaptive sparse representation by FRIST for sparse image representation, segmentation, denoising, robust inpainting, and compressed sensing-based magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction with promising performances."

      "text" : "We summarize some important features and contributions of this work as follows:\n• We propose a FRIST model that exploits the flipping and rotation invariance property of natural images, i.e., image patches typically contain edges and\nfeatures at different orientations, and hence a (single) common transform could be learned for (optimally) flipped or rotated versions of patches. Compared to a general overcomplete synthesis dictionary model or OCTOBOS, FRIST is much more constrained (with the constraints reflecting commonly observed image properties), which proves beneficial in various applications and inverse problem settings involving limited or highly corrupted measurements. • We propose a novel problem formulation and an efficient algorithm for learning FRIST. All steps of our alternating minimization algorithm involve simple optimal\nupdates. We also provide a convergence analysis of the proposed FRIST learning algorithm. • We propose various adaptive FRIST-based inverse problem formulations along with algorithms for these problems, including for image denoising, inpainting,\nand compressed sensing-based image reconstruction. The proposed FRIST-based algorithms outperform the previous adaptive sparse modeling methods.\nThe adaptive FRIST algorithms in this work involve clustering the image patches.\nSuch clustering naturally arises in the proposed alternating minimization algorithms. There are other prior works such as the Structured Sparse Model Selection (SSMS) [50, 51] approach that also involve clustering, but the sub-dictionary in each cluster in SSMS is obtained by conventional Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Though both SSMS and FRIST impose more structure to reduce the degrees of freedom in the underlying model, the proposed FRIST learning involves a variational formulation that automatically enables joint sparse coding, clustering (based on flipping and rotations), and (a single, small parent) transform learning from training signals. Moreover, our FRIST learning algorithm comes with convergence guarantees.\nWe organize the rest of the paper as follows. Section 2 introduces the FRIST\nmodel and the learning formulation. In Section 3, we present efficient FRIST learning\nalgorithms to solve the proposed learning problem along with convergence analysis. Section 4 describes various applications based on FRIST learning, including image denoising, inpainting and compressed sensing-based (MR) image reconstruction. Section 5 provides experimental results demonstrating the promise of FRIST learning, including for image segmentation, sparse representation, denoising, inpainting, and MRI."

      "text" : "The learning of the sparsifying transform model [34] has been proposed recently. Extending this approach, we propose a FRIST model that first applies a flipping and rotation (FR) operator Φ ∈ Rn×n to a signal y ∈ Rn, and models Φy as approximately sparsifiable by some sparsifying transform W ∈ Rm×n, i.e., WΦy = x+ e, with x ∈ Rm sparse in some sense, and e is a small deviation term. A finite set of flipping and rotation operators {Φk}Kk=1 is considered, and the sparse coding problem in the FRIST model is as follows:\n(P1) min 1≤k≤K min xk ∥∥W Φk y − xk∥∥22 s.t. ∥∥xk∥∥0 ≤ s ∀ k. Thus, xk denotes the sparse code of Φk y in the transform W domain, with maximum sparsity s. Equivalently, the optimal x̂k̂ (achieving the minimum over all k) is called the optimal sparse code in the FRIST domain. We further decompose the FR matrix as Φk , Gq F , where F can be either an identity matrix, or (for 2D signals) a left-toright flipping permutation matrix. Though there are various methods of formulating the rotation operator G with arbitrary angles [16, 15], rotating image patches by an angle θ that is not a multiple of 90◦ requires interpolation, and may result in misalignment with the pixel grid. Here, we adopt the matrix Gq , G(θq) that permutes the pixels in an image patch approximating rotation by angle θq without interpolation. Constructions of such {Gq} have been proposed before [24, 28, 53]. With such implementation, the number of possible permutations {Gq} denoted by Q̃, is finite and grows linearly with the signal dimension n. Accounting for the flipping operation, the total number of possible FR operators is K̃ = 2Q̃. In practice, one can select a subset {Φk}Kk=1, containing K < K̃ of FR candidates, from which the optimal Φ̂ = Φk̂ is chosen in (P1). For each Φk, the optimal sparse code x̂k in Problem (P1) can be solved exactly as x̂k = Hs(WΦky), where Hs(·) is the projector onto the s-`0 ball [32], i.e., Hs(b) zeros out all but the s elements of largest magnitude in b ∈ Rm. The optimal FR operator Φk̂ is selected to provide the smallest sparsification (modeling) error ‖W Φk y −Hs(WΦky)‖22 over k in Problem (P1).\nThe FRIST model can be interpreted as a structured union-of-transforms model,\nor a structured OCTOBOS model [44], i.e., compared to OCTOBOS, FRIST is much more constrained, with fewer free parameters. In particular, the OCTOBOS model involves a collection (or union) of sparsifying transforms {Wk}Kk=1 such that for each\ncandidate signal, there is a transform in the collection that is best matched (or that provides the lowest sparsification error) to the signal. The FRIST model involves a collection of transforms {WΦk}Kk=1 (as in Problem (P1)) that are related to each other by rotation and flip operators (and involving a single parent transform W ). The transforms in the collection all share a common transform W . We call the shared common transform W the parent transform, and each generated Wk = WΦk is called a child transform. Clearly, the collection of transforms in FRIST is more constrained than in the OCTOBOS model. The constraints that are imposed by FRIST are devised to reflect commonly observed properties of natural image patches, i.e., image patches tend to have edges and features at various orientations, and optimally rotating (or flipping) each patch would allow it to be well-sparsified by a common sparsifying transform W (as in (P1)). This property turns out to be useful in inverse problems such as denoising and inpainting, preventing the overfitting of the model in the presence of limited or highly corrupted data or measurements.\nProblem (P1) is similar to the OCTOBOS sparse coding problem [44], where each\nWk = WΦk corresponds to a block of OCTOBOS. Similar to the clustering procedure in OCTOBOS, Problem (P1) matches a signal y to a particular child transform Wk with its directional FR operator Φk. Thus, FRIST is potentially capable of automatically clustering a collection of signals (e.g., image patches), but according to their geometric orientations. When the parent transform W is unitary, FRIST is also equivalent to an overcomplete synthesis dictionary with block sparsity [52], with W Tk denoting the kth block of the equivalent overcomplete dictionary."

      "text" : "Generally, the parent transform W can be overcomplete [33, 44, 26]. In this work, we restrict ourselves to learning FRIST with a square parent transform W (i.e., m = n), which leads to a highly efficient learning algorithm with optimal updates. Note that the FRIST model is still overcomplete, even with a square parent W , because of the additional FR operators. Given the training data Y ∈ Rn×N , we formulate the FRIST learning problem as follows:\n(P2) min W,{Xi},{Ck} K∑ k=1 ∑ i∈Ck ‖WΦkYi −Xi‖22 + λQ(W )\ns.t. ‖Xi‖0 ≤ s ∀ i, {Ck} ∈ Γ\nwhere {Xi} represent the FRIST-domain sparse codes of the corresponding columns {Yi} of Y , and X ∈ Rn×N with columns Xi denotes the transform sparse code matrix of Y . The {Ck}Kk=1 indicate a clustering of the signals {Yi} N i=1 such that Cj contains the indices of signals in the jth cluster (corresponding to the child transform WΦj), and each signal Yi is associated exactly with one FR operator Φk. The set Γ is the set of all possible partitions (into K subsets) of the set of integers {1, 2, ..., N}, which enforces all of the Ck’s to be disjoint [44].\nProblem (P2) is to minimize the FRIST learning objective that includes the modeling or sparsification error ∑K\nk=1 ∑ i∈Ck ‖WΦkYi −Xi‖ 2 2 for Y as well as the\nregularizer Q(W ) = − log |detW | + ‖W‖2F to prevent trivial solutions [34]. Here, the negative log-determinant penalty − log |detW | enforces full rank on W , and the ‖W‖2F penalty helps remove a ‘scale ambiguity’ in the solution. The regularizer Q(W ) fully controls the condition number and scaling of the learned parent transform [34]. The regularizer weight λ is chosen as λ = λ0 ‖Y ‖2F with λ0 > 0, in order to scale with the first term in (P2). Previous works [34] showed that the condition number and spectral norm of the optimal parent transform Ŵ approach 1 and 1/ √\n2 respectively, as λ0 →∞ in (P2). Problem (P2) imposes an `0 sparsity constraint ‖Xi‖0 ≤ s on the sparse code of each signal or image patch. One can also impose an overall (or aggregate) sparsity constraint on the entire sparse code matrix X to allow variable sparsity levels across the signals (see Section 4.3). Alternatively, a sparsity penalty method can be used, instead of imposing sparsity constraints, which also leads to efficient algorithms (see Section 4.2). We will demonstrate the use of various sparsity methods in Section 4.\nNote that in the overcomplete synthesis dictionary model, sparse coding with an\n`0 “norm” constraint is NP-hard in general, and convex `1 relaxations of the synthesis sparse coding problem have been popular, and solving such an `1 (relaxed) problem is known to provide the sparsest solution under certain conditions on the dictionary. On the other hand, in the sparsifying transform model (including in the FRIST model), the sparse coding problem can be solved exactly and cheaply by thresholding operations, irrespective of whether an `0 penalty or constraint (resulting in hard thresholding-type solution) or an `1 penalty (resulting in soft thresholding solution) is used. Thus there is not a computational benefit for employing the `1 norm in case of the transform model. More importantly, in practice, we have observed that transform learning with `0 sparsity leads to better performance in applications compared to `1 norm-based learning."

Therefore the\nis Xi = Hs(WΦkYi). Problem (P3) is clearly equivalent to finding the “optimal” FR permutation Φk̂i independently for each data vector Yi by solving the following optimization problems:\nmin 1≤k≤K\n‖WΦkYi −Hs(WΦkYi)‖22 ∀ i (1)\nwhere the minimization over k for each Yi determines the optimal Φk̂i , or the cluster Ck̂i to which Yi belongs. The corresponding optimal sparse code for Yi in (P3) is thus X̂i = Hs(WΦk̂iYi). Given the sparse code §, one can also easily recover a least squares estimate of each signal as Ŷi = Φ\nT k̂i W−1X̂i. Since the Φk’s are permutation matrices,\napplying and computing ΦTk (which is also a permutation matrix) is cheap. Transform Update Step. Here, we solve for W in (P2) with fixed {Ck} and {Xi}, which leads to the following problem:\n(P4) min W ∥∥∥WỸ −X∥∥∥2 F + λQ(W )\nwhere Ỹ = [ Φk̂1Y1 | Φk̂2Y2 | ... | Φk̂NYN ] contains signals after applying their optimal (as determined in the preceding sparse coding and clustering step) FR operations, and the columns of X are the corresponding sparse codes Xi’s. Problem (P4) has a simple solution involving a singular value decomposition (SVD), which is similar to the transform update step in SST [35]. We first decompose the positive-definite matrix Ỹ Ỹ T + λIn = UU T (e.g., using Cholesky decomposition). Then, denoting the full singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix U−1Ỹ XT = SΣV T , where S,Σ, V ∈ Rn×n, an optimal transform Ŵ in (P4) is\nŴ = 0.5V ( Σ + (Σ2 + 2λIn) 1 2 ) STU−1 (2)\nwhere (·) 12 above denotes the positive definite square root, and In is the n× n identity. Initialization Insensitivity and Cluster Elimination. Unlike the previously proposed OCTOBOS learning algorithm [44], which requires initialization of the clusters using heuristic methods such as K-means, the FRIST learning algorithm only needs initialization of the parent transform W . In Section 5.1, numerical results demonstrate the fast convergence of the proposed FRIST learning algorithm, which can be insensitive to the parent transform initialization. In practice, we apply a heuristic cluster elimination strategy in the FRIST learning algorithm, to select the desired K FR operators. In the first iteration, all possible FR operators Φk’s [24, 53] (i.e., all possible child transforms Wk’s) are considered for sparse coding and clustering. After each iteration, the learning algorithm eliminates half of the operators with smallest cluster sizes, until the number of selected FR operators drops to K, which only takes a few\ncomposite operator Φk is a permutation matrix. § The stored sparse code includes the value of X̂i, as well as the membership index k̂i which adds just log2K bits to the code storage.\niterations. For the rest of the iterations, the algorithm only considers the selected K Φk’s in the sparse coding and clustering steps.\nComputational Cost Analysis. The sparse coding and clustering step computes\nthe optimal sparse codes and clusters, with O(Kn2N) cost. In the transform update step, we compute the optimal solution for the square parent transform in (P4). The cost of computing this solution scales as O(n2N) (dominated by matrix-matrix products), assuming N n, which is cheaper than the sparse coding and clustering step. Thus, the overall computational cost per iteration of FRIST learning using the proposed alternating algorithm scales as O(Kn2N), which is typically lower than the cost per iteration of the overcomplete K-SVD learning algorithm [5], with the number of dictionary atoms m = Kn, and synthesis sparsity s ∝ n. FRIST learning also converges quickly in practice as illustrated later in Section 5.1. The computational costs periteration of SST, OCTOBOS, FRIST, and KSVD learning are summarized in Table 1."

Problem (P2) is formulated with sparsity constraints (for each Xi),\nwhich is equivalent to an unconstrained formulation with sparsity barrier penalties φ(Xi) (which equals +∞ when the constraint is violated, and is zero otherwise). Thus, the objective function of Problem (P2) can be rewritten as\nf (W,X,Λ) = K∑ k=1 ∑ i∈Ck { ‖WΦkYi −Xi‖22 + φ(Xi) } + λQ(W ) (3)\nwhere Λ ∈ R1×N is the vector whose ith element Λi ∈ {1, .., K} denotes the cluster label corresponding to the signal Yi, i.e., CΛi .

Since FRIST can be interpreted as a structured OCTOBOS,\nthe convergence results for the FRIST learning algorithm take a form similar to those obtained for the OCTOBOS learning algorithm [44] in our recent work. The convergence\nresult for the FRIST learning algorithm for (P2), is summarized in the following theorem and corollaries.\nTheorem 1 For each initialization (W 0, X0,Λ0), the following results hold:\n(i) The objective sequence {f t = f(W t, X t,Λt)} in the FRIST learning algorithm is monotone decreasing, and converges to a finite value, f ∗ = f ∗(W 0, X0,Λ0).\n(ii) The iterate sequence {W t, X t,Λt} is bounded, with all of its accumulation points equivalent, i.e., achieving the exact same value f ∗.\n(iii) Every accumulation point (W,X,Λ) of the iterate sequence satisfies the following\npartial global optimality conditions:\n(X,Λ) ∈ arg min X̃,Λ̃\nf ( W, X̃, Λ̃ ) (4)\nW ∈ arg min W̃\nf ( W̃ ,X,Λ ) (5)\n(iv) For each accumulation point (W,X,Λ), there exists = (W ) > 0 such that\nf (W + dW,X + ∆X,Λ) ≥ f (W,X,Λ) = f ∗, (6)\nwhich holds for all dW ∈ Rn×n satisfying ‖dW‖F ≤ , and all ∆X ∈ Rn×N satisfying ‖∆X‖∞ < mink mini∈Ck {ψs(WΦkYi) : ‖WΦkYi‖0 > s}. Here, we define the infinity norm of matrix ∆X as ‖∆X‖∞ , maxi,j |∆Xi,j|, and the operator ψs(·) returns the sth largest magnitude in a vector.\nConclusion (iv) provides a partial local optimality condition for each accumulation\npoint with respect to (W,X), where the local perturbation dW in Equation (6) is sufficiently small, and ∆X is specified by a finite region, which is determined by a scalar κ that limits the amplitudes of entries in ∆X (i.e., ‖∆X‖∞ < κ). Here κ = mink κk, and each κk = mini∈Ck {ψs(WΦkYi) : ‖WΦkYi‖0 > s} is computed by (i) choosing the vectors with sparsity > s from {WΦkYi} where i ∈ Ck, (ii) selecting the sth largest magnitude in each of those vectors, and (iii) returning the smallest of those values. If there are no vectors with sparsity of WΦkYi greater than s in a class k, then that κk is set as ∞.\nCorollary 1 For a particular initial (W 0, X0,Λ0), the iterate sequence in the FRIST learning algorithm converges to an equivalence class of accumulation points, which are also partial minimizers satisfying (4), (5), and (6).\nCorollary 2 The iterate sequence {W t, X t,Λt} in the FRIST learning algorithm is globally convergent (i.e., it converges from any initialization) to the set of partial minimizers of the objective f (W,X,Λ).\nFor reasons of space, we only provide an outline of proofs. The conclusion (i) in\nTheorem 1 is obvious, as the proposed alternating algorithm solves the sub-problem in each step exactly. The proof of Conclusion (ii) follows the same arguments as in the proofs in Lemma 3 and Lemma 5 in [44]. In Conclusion (iii), Condition (4) can be proved using the arguments for Lemma 7 from [44], while Condition (5) can be proved with the arguments for Lemma 6 from [35]. The last conclusion in Theorem 1 can be shown using similar arguments as from the proof of Lemma 9 in [35].\nTheorem 1 and Corollaries 1 and 2 establish that with any initialization\n(W 0, X0,Λ0), the iterate sequence {W t, X t,Λt} generated by the FRIST learning algorithm converges to an equivalence class (corresponding to a common objective value f ∗ – that may depend on initialization) of partial minimizers of the objective. No assumptions are made about the initialization to establish these results. We leave the investigation of stronger convergence results (e.g., convergence to global minima) with additional assumptions including on the algorithm initialization or using a probabilistic analysis framework, to future work."

Various denoising algorithms have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art performance [49, 9]. Similar to previous dictionary and transform learning based image denoising methods [11, 44], we propose the following patch-based image denoising formulation using FRIST learning:\n(P5) min W,{yi,xi,Ck} K∑ k=1 ∑ i∈Ck { ‖WΦkyi − xi‖22 + τ ‖Ri z − yi‖ 2 2 } + λQ(W )\ns.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ si ∀ i, {Ck} ∈ Γ\nwhere Ri ∈ Rn×P denotes the patch extraction operator, i.e., Riz ∈ Rn represents the ith overlapping patch of the corrupted image z as a vector.

The vector xi ∈ Rn represents the sparse code of yi in the FRIST domain, with an a\npriori unknown sparsity level si. We follow the previous SST-based and OCTOBOSbased denoising methods [32, 44], and impose a sparsity constraint on each yi.\nWe propose a simple iterative denoising algorithm based on (P5). Each iteration\ninvolves the following steps: (i) sparse coding and clustering, (ii) sparsity level update, and (iii) transform update. Once the iterations complete, we have a denoised image reconstruction step. We initialize the {yi} in (P5) using the noisy image patches {Riz}. Step (i) is the same as described in Section 3.1. We then update the sparsity levels si for all i, similar to the SST learning-based denoising algorithm [32]. With fixed W and clusters {Ck}, we observe the solution for yi (i ∈ Ck) in (P5) in the least squares sense,\nyi = Φ T k\n[√ τ I\nW\n]† [ √ τ vi\nHsi(Wvi)\n] = G1vi +G2Hsi(Wvi) (7)\nwhere G1 and G2 are appropriate matrices in the above decomposition, and vi , ΦkRi z are the rotated/flipped noisy patches, which can be pre-computed in each iteration. We choose the optimal si to be the smallest integer that makes the reconstructed yi in (7) satisfy the error condition ‖Riz − yi‖22 ≤ nC2σ2, where C is a constant parameter [32]. Once the sparsity level update (step (ii)) is completed, we proceed to the transform update based on the method in Section 3.1. The algorithm alternates between steps (i)-(iii) for a fixed number of iterations, and eventually the denoised image patches {yi} are obtained using (7). Each pixel in the reconstructed patch is projected onto the underlying intensity range (image pixel is typically stored as 8-bit integer, which corresponds to the intensity range [0, 255]). The denoised image is reconstructed by averaging the overlapping denoised patches at their respective image locations.\nFor improved denoising, the algorithm for (P5) is repeated for several passes by\nreplacing z with the most recent denoised image estimate in each pass. The noise standard deviation σ decreases gradually in each such pass, and is found (tuned) empirically [44]."

The sparse coding problem with a sparsity penalty has a closed-form solution [37], and thus Step (i) is equivalent to solving the following clustering problem:\nmin 1≤k≤K\n‖WΦkyi − Tτ (WΦkyi)‖22 + τ 2 ‖Tτ (WΦkyi)‖0 ∀ i (8)\nwhere the hard thresholding operator Tτ (·) is defined as\n(Tτ (b))j = { 0 , |bj| < τ bj , |bj| ≥ τ\n(9)\nwhere the vector b ∈ Rn, and the subscript j indexes its entries. The optimal sparse codes are obtained by hard thresholding yi in the optimal transform domain. Step (ii) is similar to that in the denoising algorithm in Section 4.1. In the following, we discuss Step (iii) by considering two cases.\nIdeal image inpainting without noise. In the ideal case when the noise ε is\nabsent, i.e., σ = 0, the coefficient of the fidelity term γ → ∞. Thus the fidelity term can be replaced with hard constraints Pi yi = zi ∀ i. In the noiseless reconstruction step, with fixed {xi, Ck} and W , we first reconstruct each image patch yi by solving the following linearly constrained least squares problem:\nmin yi ‖WΦkiyi − xi‖ 2 2 s.t. Pi yi = zi . (10)\nWe define zi = Piyi , yi − ei, where ei = (In − Pi)yi. Ωi = supp(Φkidiag(In − Pi)), which is complementary to supp(Φkidiag(Pi)), where “diag” denotes the diagonal of a matrix extracted as a vector. Since the constraint leads to the relationship yi = zi + ei with zi given, we solve the equivalent minimization problem over ei as follows:\nmin ei ‖WΦkiei − (xi −WΦki zi)‖ 2 2 s.t. supp(Φkiei) = Ωi . (11)\nHere, we define WΩi to be the submatrix of W formed by columns indexed in Ωi, and (Φkiei)Ωi to be the vector containing the entries at locations Ωi of Φkiei. Thus, WΦkei = WΩi(Φkiei)Ωi , and we define ξ i , Φkiei. The reconstruction problem is then re-written as the following unconstrained problem:\nmin ξiΩi ∥∥WΩiξiΩi − (xi −WΦk zi)∥∥22 ∀ i . (12) The above least squares problem has a simple solution given as ξ̂iΩi = W † Ωi\n(xi−WΦk zi). Accordingly, we can calculate êi = Φ\nT ki ξ̂i, and thus the reconstructed patches ŷi = êi+zi.\nRobust image inpainting. We now consider the case of noisy z, and propose\na robust inpainting algorithm (i.e., for the aforementioned Step (iii)). This is useful because real image measurements are inevitably corrupted with noise [19]. The robust reconstruction step for each patch is to solve the following problem:\nmin yi ‖WΦkiyi − xi‖ 2 2 + γ ‖Piyi − zi‖ 2 2 (13)\nLet z̃i , Φkizi, ui , Φkiyi, and P̃i , ΦkiPiΦ T ki , where Φki is a permutation matrix. The rotated solution ûi in optimization problem (13) is equivalent to\nûi = arg min ui\n‖Wui − xi‖22 + γ ∥∥∥P̃iui − z̃i∥∥∥2\n2 (14)\nwhich has a least squares solution ûi = (W TW + γP̃i) −1(W Txi + γP̃iz̃i). As the matrix inversion (W TW+γP̃i) −1 is expensive with a cost of O(n3) for each patch reconstruction, we apply the Woodbury Matrix Identity and rewrite the solution to (14) as\nûi = [B −BTΥi( 1\nγ Iqi + Ψi)\n−1BΥi ](W Txi + γP̃iz̃i) (15)\nwhere B , (W TW )−1 can be pre-computed, and the support of z̃i is denoted as Υi , supp(diag(P̃i)). The scalar qi = |Υi| counts the number of measured pixels in zi. Here, BΥi is the submatrix of B formed by Υi-indexed rows, while Ψi is the submatrix of BΥi formed by Υi-indexed columns. Thus, the matrix inversion ( 1 γ Iqi +Ψi) −1 has cost of O((qi)3) and the other matrix-matrix products in (15) have cost O(n(qi)2), compared to computing (W TW + γP̃i) −1 with cost of O(n3) for the reconstruction of each patch. For an inpainting problem with most pixels missing (qi n), this represents significant savings. On the other hand, with few pixels missing (qi ≈ n), a similar procedure can be used with I − Pi replacing Pi. Once ûi is computed, the patch in (13) is recovered as ŷi = Φ\nT ki ûi.\nSimilar to Section 4.1, each pixel in the reconstructed patch is projected onto the\n(underlying) intensity range (e.g., [0, 255] for image pixel stored using 8-bit integer). Eventually, we output the inpainted image by averaging the reconstructed patches at their respective image locations. We perform multiple passes in the inpainting algorithm for (P6) for improved inpainting. In each pass, we initialize {yi} using patches extracted from the most recent inpainted image. By doing so, we indirectly reinforce the dependency between overlapping patches in each pass."

      "text" : "Compressed Sensing (CS) exploits sparsity and enables accurate MRI reconstruction from limited k-space or Fourier measurements [40, 36, 17]. However, CS-based MRI may suffer from artifacts at high undersampling factors, when using non-adaptive or analytical sparsifying transforms [31]. Recent works [36] proposed Blind Compressed Sensing (BCS)-based MR image reconstruction methods using learned signal models,\nand achieved superior reconstruction results. The terminology blind compressed sensing (or image model-blind compressed sensing) is used because the dictionary or sparsifying transform for the underlying image patches is assumed unknown a priori, and is learned simultaneously with the image from the undersampled (compressive) measurements themselves. MR image patches typically contain various oriented features [53], which have recently been shown to be well sparsifiable by directional wavelets [28]. As an alternative to approaches involving directional analytical transforms, here, we propose an adaptive FRIST-based approach that can adapt a parent transform W while clustering image patches simultaneously based on their geometric orientations. This leads to more accurate modeling of MR image features.\nSimilar to the previous TL-MRI work [36], we propose a BCS-based MR image\nreconstruction scheme using the (adaptive) FRIST model, dubbed FRIST-MRI. For computational efficiency, we restrict the parent W to be a unitary transform in the following. The FRIST-blind image recovery problem with a sparsity constraint is formulated as\n(P7) min W,y,{xi,Ck} µ ‖Fuy − z‖22 + K∑ k=1 ∑ i∈Ck ‖WΦkRiy − xi‖22\ns.t. WHW = I, ‖X‖0 ≤ s, ‖y‖2 ≤ L, {Ck} ∈ Γ ,\nwhere WHW = I is the unitary constraint, y ∈ CP is the MR image to be reconstructed, and z ∈ CM denotes the measurements with the sensing matrix Fu ∈ CM×P , which is the undersampled (single coil, Cartesian) Fourier encoding matrix. Here M P , so Problem (P7) is aimed to reconstruct an MR image y from highly undersampled measurements z. The constraint ‖y‖2 ≤ L with L > 0, represents prior knowledge of the signal energy/range. The sparsity term ‖X‖0 counts the number of non-zeros in the entire sparse code matrix X, whose columns are the sparse codes {xi}. This sparsity constraint enables variable sparsity levels for individual patches [36].\nWe use a block coordinate descent approach [36] to solve Problem (P7). The\nproposed algorithm alternates between (i) sparse coding and clustering, (ii) parent transform update, and (iii) MR image update. We initialize this algorithm, dubbed FRIST-MRI, with an image (estimate for y) such as the zero-filled Fourier reconstruction FHu z. Step (i) solves Problem (P7) for {xi, Ck} with fixed W and y as\nmin {xi,Ck} K∑ k=1 ∑ i∈Ck ‖WΦkRiy − xi‖22 s.t. ‖X‖0 ≤ s, {Ck} ∈ Γ. (16)\nThe exact solution to Problem (16) requires calculating the sparsification error (objective) for each possible clustering. The cost for this scales as O(Pn2KP ) for P patches ‖, which is computationally infeasible. Instead, we present an approximate\n‖ The number of patches is P when we use a patch overlap stride of 1 and include patches at image boundaries by allowing them to ‘wrap-around’ on the opposite side of the image [35].\nsolution here, which we observed to work well in our experiments. In this method, we first compute the total sparsification error SEk, associated with each Φk, by solving the following problem:\nSEk = P∑ i=1 SEik , min{βki } P∑ i=1 ∥∥WΦkRiy − βki ∥∥22 s.t. ∥∥Bk∥∥0 ≤ s (17) where the columns of Bk are { βki } . The optimal Bk above is obtained by thresholding\nthe matrix with columns { WΦkRiy }P i=1 and retaining the s largest magnitude elements. The clusters {Ck} in (16) are approximately computed by assigning i ∈ Ck̂i where k̂i = arg min\nk SEik. Once the clusters are computed, the corresponding sparse\ncodes X̂ in (16) (for fixed clusters) are easily found by thresholding the matrix[ WΦk̂1R1y | ... | WΦk̂PRPy ] and retaining the s largest magnitude elements [36].\nStep (ii) updates the parent transform W with the unitary constraint (and with\nother variables fixed). The optimal solution, which is similar to previous work [35], is computed as follows. First, we calculate the full SVD AXH = S̃Σ̃Ṽ H , where the columns of A are {ΦkRiy}Pi=1. The optimal unitary parent transform is then Ŵ = Ṽ S̃H . Step (iii) solves for y with fixed W and {xi, Ck} as\nmin y K∑ k=1 ∑ i∈Ck ‖WΦkRiy − xi‖22 + µ ‖Fuy − z‖ 2 2 s.t. ‖y‖2 ≤ L. (18)\nAs Problem (18) is a least squares problem with an `2 constraint, it can be solved exactly using the Lagrange multiplier method [14]. Thus (18) is equivalent to\nmin y K∑ k=1 ∑ i∈Ck ‖WΦkRiy − xi‖22 + µ ‖Fuy − z‖ 2 2 + ρ(‖y‖ 2 2 − L) (19)\nwhere ρ ≥ 0 is the optimally chosen Lagrange multiplier. An alternative approach to solving Problem (18) is by employing the iterative projected gradient method. However, because of the specific structure of the matrices (e.g., partial Fourier sensing matrix in MRI) involved, (18) can be solved much more easily and efficiently with the Lagrange multiplier method as discussed next.\nSimilar to the previous TL-MRI work [36], the normal equation for Problem (19)\n(for known multiplier ρ) can be simplified as follows, where F denotes the full Fourier encoding matrix assumed normalized (FHF = I):\n(FEFH + µFFHu FuF H + ρI)Fy = F K∑ k=1 ∑ i∈Ck RTi Φ H k W Hxi + µFF H u z (20)\nwhere E , ∑K\nk=1 ∑ i∈Ck R T i Φ H k W HWΦkRi = ∑P i=1R T i Ri. When the patch stride is 1\nand all wrap-around patches are included, E = nI, with I the P × P identity. Since\nFEFH , µFFHu FuF H [36], and ρI are all diagonal matrices, the matrix pre-multiplying Fy in (20) is diagonal and invertible. Hence, (20) can be solved cheaply. Importantly, using a unitary constraint for W leads to an efficient update in (20). In particular, the matrix E is not easily diagonalizable when W is not unitary. The problem of finding the optimal Lagrange multiplier reduces to solving a simple scalar equation (see for example, equation (3.17) in [36]) that can be solved using Newton’s method. Thus, the approach based on the Lagrange multiplier method is much simpler compared to an iterative projected gradient scheme to estimate the (typically large) vector-valued image in Problem (18)."

In this subsection, we illustrate the FRIST clustering behavior by image segmentation experiments. We consider the images Wave (512 × 512) and Field (512 × 512) shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 4(a) as inputs. Both images contains directional textures, and we aim to cluster the pixels of the images into one of four classes, which represent different orientations or flips. For each input image, we convert it into gray-scale, extract the overlapping mean-subtracted patches, and learn a FRIST while clustering the patches using the algorithm in Section 3.1. As overlapping patches are used, each pixel in the image belongs to several overlapping patches. We cluster a pixel into a particular class by majority voting among the patches that contain it.\nWe set s = 10, and K = 4 in the clustering experiments. Figure 3 and Figure 4\nillustrate the segmentation results of images Wave and Field, respectively. Figure 3(b) and Figure 4(b) illustrate the pixel memberships with four different colors (blue, red, green, and black, for classes 1 to 4, respectively). Figures 3(c)-(f) and Figures 4(c)-(f) each visualize the image pixels clustered into a specific class in gray-scale, and the pixels that are not clustered into that class are shown in black. Each class captures edges at specific orientations.\nThe parent transform W and its children transforms Wk’s in the learned FRIST\nfor the Wave image are visualized in Fig. 5 with the rows of each Wk displayed as 8× 8\npatches. We observe that each child transform contains distinct directional features that were adaptively learned to sparsify edges with specific orientations better. The parent W turns out to be identical to the child transform shown in Fig. 4(e), implying that the corresponding FR operator is the identity matrix.\nThe preliminary image segmentation results here demonstrate some potential for\nthe FRIST scheme for directional classification or segmentation. More importantly, we wish to illustrate why FRIST can provide improvements over SST or OCTOBOS in various inverse problems. As natural images usually contain a variety of directional features and edges, FRIST is capable of grouping those patches with similar orientations/flips, and thus provides better sparsification in each cluster using directional children transforms, even while learning only a single small parent transform W (which could be learned even in cases of very limited or corrupted data)."

      "text" : "Most of the popular image compression methods make use of analytical sparsifying transforms. In particular, the commonly used JPEG uses the 2D DCT to sparsify image patches. Data-driven adaptation of dictionaries using the K-SVD scheme has also been shown to be beneficial for image compression, compared to fixed analytical transforms [7]. In this section, we show that the proposed FRIST learning scheme provides improved sparse representations of images compared to related adaptive sparse modeling methods. While we focus here on a simple study of the sparse representation abilities of adaptive FRIST, the investigation of a complete adaptive image compression framework based on FRIST and its comparison to benchmarks is left for future work. We learn a FRIST, with a 64 × 64 parent transform W , from the 104 randomly selected patches (from USC-SIPI images) used in Section 5.1. We set K = 32, s = 10 and λ0 = 3.1×10−3. We compare the learned FRIST with other popular adaptive sparse signals models. In particular, we train a 64×64 SST [35], a 128×64 OCTOBOS [44], as well as a 64× 64 square (synthesis) dictionary and a 64× 128 overcomplete dictionary using KSVD [11], using the same training patches and sparsity level as for FRIST.\nWith the learned models, we represent each image from the USC-SIPI database as\nwell as some other standard images. Each image is represented compactly by storing its sparse representation including (i) non-zero coefficient values in the sparse codes of the 8 × 8 non-overlapping patches, (ii) locations of the non-zeros (plus the cluster membership if necessary) in the sparse codes for each patch and (iii) the adaptive sparse signal model (e.g., the dictionary or transform matrix – this would typically involve negligible overhead). For each method, the patch sparsity (or equivalently, the number of non-zero coefficients per patch) is set to s = 10 (same as during training). The adaptive SST, square KSVD, and adaptive FRIST methods store only a 64 × 64 square matrix in (iii) above, whereas the overcomplete KSVD and OCTOBOS methods store a 128× 64 matrix. The images (i.e., their non-overlapping patches) are reconstructed from their sparse representations in a least squares sense, and the reconstruction quality for each image is evaluated using the Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), expressed in decibels (dB). We use the average of the PSNR values over all 44 USC-SIPI images as the indicator of the quality of sparse representation of the USC-SIPI database.\nTable 2 lists the sparse representation reconstruction results for the USC-SIPI\ndatabase and the images Cameraman (256× 256) and House (256× 256). We observe that the learned FRIST model provides the best reconstruction quality compared to other adaptive sparse signal models or the analytical 2D DCT, for both the USCSIPI images and the external images. Compared to unstructured overcomplete models such as KSVD and OCTOBOS, the proposed FRIST provides improved PSNRs, while achieving potentially fewer bits for sparse representation ¶. Additionally, dictionary learning based representation requires synthesis sparse coding, which is more expensive compared to the cheap and exact sparse coding in the transform model-based methods [34]. As mentioned before, the investigation of an image compression system based on learned FRIST models, and its analysis as well as quantitative comparison to other compression benchmarks is left for future work."

Gaussian noise at 4 different noise levels (σ = 5, 10, 15, 20) for seven standard images in Fig. 1. Denoising results obtained by our proposed algorithm in Section 4.1 are compared with those obtained by the adaptive overcomplete K-SVD denoising scheme [11], adaptive SST denoising scheme [35] and the adaptive OCTOBOS denoising scheme [44]. We also compare to the denoising result using the SST method, but with fixed 2D DCT (i.e., no learning).\n¶ Assuming for simplicity that L bits are used to describe each non-zero coefficient value in each model, the total number of bits for storing the sparse code (non-zero locations, non-zero coefficient values, cluster membership) of a patch is 6s + Ls + 5 in 64 × 64 FRIST (K = 32), and 7s + Ls in 64× 128 KSVD. For the setting s = 10, FRIST requires 5 fewer bits per patch compared to KSVD.\nadaptive SST and OCTOBOS denoising methods, we follow the same parameter settings as used in the previous works [35, 44]. The same parameter settings as for the SST method is used for the DCT-based denoising algorithm. A 64 × 256 learned synthesis dictionary is used in the synthesis K-SVD denoising method and for the OCTOBOS denoising scheme, we use a corresponding 256 × 64 learned OCTOBOS. For the KSVD, adaptive SST, and adaptive OCTOBOS denoising methods, we used the publicly available implementations [1, 3] in this experiment.\nTable 3 lists the denoised image PSNR values for the various methods for the\nseven tested images at several noise levels. The proposed FRIST scheme provides consistently better PSNRs compared to the other fixed or adaptive sparse modeling methods including DCT, SST, K-SVD, and OCTOBOS. The average denoising PSNR improvements provided by adaptive FRIST over DCT, adaptive SST, K-SVD, and adaptive OCTOBOS are 0.48 dB, 0.26 dB, 0.47 dB, and 0.04 dB respectively, and the standard deviation in these improvements was 0.26 dB, 0.11 dB, 0.22 dB, and 0.03 dB, respectively.\nPerformance vs. Noise Level. Table 4 lists the noisy PSNR and denoising\nPSNR values averaged over 7 testing images, using the competing methods relative to those using FRIST. It is clear for larger σ values, the proposed FRIST provides larger average denoising PSNR improvements, compared to the competing methods. Because the FRIST model is more constrained, thus more robust to measurement corruption (e.g., additive noise), comparing to other sparse models. Sections 5.5 and 5.6 will provide more evidence demonstrating the robustness of the proposed FRIST method for other types of measurement corruptions, including missing pixel in image inpainting and Fourier-domain undersampling in MRI.\nPerformance vs. Number of Clusters. In applications such as image denoising,\nwhen OCTOBOS or FRIST are learned from limited noisy patches, OCTOBOS with\nmany more degrees of freedom is more likely to overfit the data and learn noisy features, which can degrade the denoising performance. Figure 6 provides an empirical illustration of this behavior, and plots the denoising PSNRs for Peppers as a function of the number of child transforms or number of clusters K for σ = 5 and σ = 15. In both cases, the denoising PSNRs of the OCTOBOS and FRIST schemes increase with K initially. However, beyond an optimal value of K, the OCTOBOS denoising scheme suffers from overfitting the noise. Thus the OCTOBOS performance in Fig. 6 quickly degrades as the number of transforms (in the collection/union) or clusters to be learned from a set of noisy image patches is increased [44]. In contrast, the structured FRIST-based denoising scheme (involving much fewer degrees of freedom) is more robust or resilient to noise. As K increases, adaptive FRIST denoising provides continually monotonically increasing denoising PSNR in Fig. 6. For example, while the FRIST PSNR achieves a peak value for K = 128, the PSNR for adaptive OCTOBOS denoising is significantly lower at such a large K.\nAlthough we focused our comparisons here on related adaptive sparse modeling\nmethods, a very recent work [42] shows that combining transform learning based denoising with non-local similarity models leads to better denoising performance, and outperforms the state-of-the-art BM3D denoising method [9]. A further extension of the work in [42] to include FRIST learning is of interest and could potentially provide even greater advantages, but we leave this detailed investigation to future work."

However, synthesis dictionary learning typically involves NP-hard sparse coding and expensive learning steps. Recently, sparsifying transform learning received interest for its cheap computation and its optimal updates in the alternating algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for learning Flipping and Rotation Invariant Sparsifying Transforms, dubbed FRIST, to better represent natural images that contain textures with various geometrical directions. The proposed alternating FRIST learning algorithm involves efficient optimal updates. We provide a convergence guarantee, and demonstrate the empirical convergence behavior of the proposed FRIST learning approach. Preliminary experiments show the promising performance of FRIST learning for sparse image representation, segmentation, denoising, robust inpainting, and compressed sensing-based magnetic resonance image reconstruction.",
