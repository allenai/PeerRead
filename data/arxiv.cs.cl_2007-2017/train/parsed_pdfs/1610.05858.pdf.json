      "text" : "Patient clinical records contain longitudinal record of patient health, disease, test’s conducted and response to treatment, often useful for epidemiologic and clinical research. Thus extracting these information has been of immense value for both clinical practise and to improve quality of patient care provided while reducing healthcare costs. Concept extraction (CE) aims to identify medical concept mentions such as problems, test, treatments in clinical records (Eg: discharge summaries, progress reports) and classify them into pre-defined categories. The concepts in clinical records are often expressed with unstructured free text, rendering their extraction a daunting task for clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. The CE problem is analogous to well-studied Named Entity Recognition (NER) task in general NLP domain. Traditional approaches to extracting concepts relied on rule based systems or dictionaries (lexicon’s) using string comparision to recognise concepts of interest. The concepts represent drug names, anatomical nomenclature, other specialised names and phrases which are not part of mundane English vocabulary. For instance ”resp status” should be interpreted as ”response status”. Furthermore the use of abbreviated phrases are very common among medical fraternity and many of these abbreviations have alternative meanings in other genres of English. Intrinsically, rule based systems are hard to scale, and ineffective in the presence of informal sentences and abbreviated phrases (Liu et al., 2015). Dictionary based systems perform a fast look-up from medical ontologies such as Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to extract concepts (Kipper-Schuler et al., 2008). Although these systems achieve high precison but suffer from low recall ( i,e they may not identify significant number of concepts) due to missplelled words or medical jargons not present in dictionaries. To overcome these limitations various supervised and semi-supervised machine learning (ML) approaches and its variants have been proposed utilizing conditional random fields (CRF), maximum entropy and support vector machines (SVM) models which utilize both textual and contextual information while reducing the dependency on lexicon lookup (Lafferty et al., 2001; Berger et al., 1996; Joachims, 1998). However these state-of-the-art ML approaches follow two step process of domain specific feature engineering and classification, which are highly dedicated hand-crafted systems and require labour intensive expert knowledge. For this reason, this paper employs bidirectional LSTM-CRF intialized with general purpose off-the-shelf neural word embeddings derived from Glove (Pennington et al., 2014) and Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) for automatic feature learning thus avoiding time-consuming feature engineering, which deliver system performance comparable to the best submissions from the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge.\nMost of the research to date have formulated CE as a sequence labelling NER problem employing various supervised and semi-supervised ML algorithms employing focussed domain-dependent attributes and specialized text features (Uzuner et al., 2011). Similarly hybrid models obtained by cascading CRF and SVM algorithms along with several pattern matching rules are shown to produce effective results (Boag et al., 2015). The efficacy of including pre-processing technique (such as truecasing and annotation combination) along with CRF based NER system to improve concept extraction performace was exemplified by (Fu and Ananiadou, 2014). The best performing system for 2010 i2b2/VA concept extract task adopted unsupervised feature representations derived from unlabeled corpora using Brown clustering technique along with semi-supervised Markov HMM models (de Bruijn et al., 2011). However, the unsupervised one-hot word feature representations derived from Brown clustering fails to capture multiple aspect relation between words. Subsequently (Jonnalagadda et al., 2012) demonstrated that random indexing model with distributional word representations improve clinical concept extraction. With recent success of incorporating word embeddings derived from the entire English wikipedia in various NER task (Collobert et al., 2011), binarized word embeddings derived from domain specific copora (Eg: Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) II corpus) has improved performance of CRF based concept extraction system (Wu et al., 2015). In the broader field of machine learning, the recent years have witnessed proliferation of deep neural networks, with unprecedented results in tasks such as visual, speech and NER. One of the main advantages of neural networks is that they learn features automatically thus avoiding laborious feature engineerin. Given these promising results obtained the main goal of this paper is to employ bidirectional LSTM CRF intialized with general off-the-shelf unsupervised word embeddings derived from Glove and Word2Vec models and evaluate its performance. The experimental results obtained on 2010 i2b2/VA reference standard corpora without use of any extensive feature engineering and domain specific resources is very encouraging."

      "heading" : "3 The Proposed Approach",
      "text" : "CE can be formulated as a joint segmentation and classification task over a predefined set of classes. As an example, consider the input sentence provided in Table 1. The notation follows the widely adopted in/out/begin (IOB) entity representation with, in this instance, HCT as the test, 2U PRBC as the treatment. In this paper, we approach the CE task by bidirectional LSTM CRF and we therefore provide a brief description hereafter. In a bidirectional LSTM CRF, each word in the input sentence is first mapped to a random real-valued vector of arbitrary dimension, d. Then, a measurement for the word, noted as x(t), is formed by concatenating the word’s own vector with a window of preceding and following vectors (the\nw3(t) = [His,HCT, dropped],\n‘His′ → xHCT ∈ R d,\n‘HCT ′ → xHis ∈ R d,\n‘dropped′ → xdropped ∈ R d,\nx(t) = [xHis, xHCT, xdropped] ∈ R 3d\n(1)\nwhere w3(t) is the context window centered around the t-th word, ′HCT ′, and xword represents the numerical vector for word."

      "text" : "Word embeddings are dense vector representations of natural language words that preserves the semantic and syntactic similarities between them. The vector representations could be generated by either count based such as Hellinger-PCA (Lebret and Collobert, 2013), direct prediction models such as Word2Vec comprising of Skip-gram or Common Bag of Words (CBOW) or Glove word embeddings. Glove vector representations captures complex patterns beyond word similarity through by combining efficient use of word co-occurance statistics and generate a global vector representation for any given word."

      "text" : "The LSTM was designed to overcome this limitation by incorporating a gated memory-cell to capture long-range dependencies within the data (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). In the bidirectional LSTM, for any given sentence, the network computes both a left, −→ h (t), and a right, ←− h (t), representations of the sentence context at every input, x(t). The final representation is created by concatenating them as h(t) = [ −→ h (t); ←− h (t)]. All these networks utilize the h(t) layer as an implicit feature for entity class prediction: although this model has proved effective in many cases, it is not able to provide joint decoding of the outputs in a Viterbi-style manner (e.g., an I-group cannot follow a B-brand; etc). Thus, another modification to the bidirectional LSTM is the addition of a conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) as the output layer to provide optimal sequential decoding. The resulting network is commonly referred to as the bidirectional LSTM-CRF (Lample et al., 2016)."

With this evaluation, the predicted entities have to match the ground-truth entities exactly, both in boundary and class. To facilitate the replication of our experimental results, we have used a publiclyavailable library for the implementation (i.e., the Theano neural network toolkit (Bergstra et al., 2010)) and we publicly release our code1. The experiments have been run over a range of values for the hyperparameters, using the validation set for selection (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012). The hyper-parameters include the number of hidden-layer nodes, H ∈ {25, 50, 100}, the context window size, s ∈ {1, 3, 5}, and the embedding dimension, d ∈ {50, 100, 300, 500, 1000}. Two additional parameters, the learning and drop-out rates, were sampled from a uniform distribution in the range [0.05, 0.1]. To begin with, the embedding and initial weight matrices were all randomly initialized from the uniform distribution within range [−1, 1] subsequently word embeddings with d = 300 derived from Word2Vec and Glove was utilized in the experiments. Early training stopping was set to 100 epochs to mollify over-fitting, and the model that gave the best performance on the validation set was retained. The accuracy is reported in terms of micro-average F1 score computed using the CoNLL score function (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007)."

      "text" : "Table 3 shows the performance comparison between the employed bidirectional LSTM-CRF and stateof-the-art CE systems. As an overall note, the bidirectional LSTM-CRF have not reached the same accuracy as the top system, semi-supervised Markov HMM (de Bruijn et al., 2011). However, our approach has achieved the second-best score on 2010 i2b2/VA. These results seem interesting on the ground that the bidirectional LSTM-CRF provide CE without utilizing any manually-engineered features. Given that our system learn entirely from the data, it is also robust to any new concept or unseen words additions. In our current experimental setting about 20% of tokens were either alpha-numeric or abbreviated strings whose Word2Vec or Glove pretrained vector embeddings were not available. These special strings in text were randomly initialized with d = 300 vector embeddings and input to bidirectional LSTM-CRF system. Subsequently the system was able to learn meaningfull representations with remaining 80% of pre-trained vector embeddings and produce comparable results to the state-of-the-art CE systems.\nConclusion\nThis paper has used the contemporary bidirectional LSTM-CRF, for clinical concept extraction. The most appealing feature of this sytem is their ability to provide end-to-end recognition initialized with general purpose off-the-shelf word embeddings sparing effort from laborious feature construction. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to adopt bidirectional LSTM-CRF for concept extraction from clinical records. The experimental results over the 2010 i2b2/VA reference standard corpora look promising, with the bidirectional LSTM-CRF ranking closely to the state of the art. A potential way to further improve its performance would be to initialize its training with unsupervised word embeddings such as Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) trained with domain specific resources such as Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) II copora. This approach has proved effective in many other domains and still dispenses with expert annotation effort; we plan this exploration for the near future.\n1https://github.com/raghavchalapathy/Bidirectional-LSTM-CRF-for-Clinical-Concept-Extraction\n[Berger et al.1996] Adam L Berger, Vincent J Della Pietra, and Stephen A Della Pietra. 1996.

State-of-the-art CE approaches heavily rely on hand crafted features and domain specific resources which are hard to collect and tune. For this reason, this paper employs bidirectional LSTM with CRF decoding initialized with general purpose off-the-shelf word embeddings for CE. The experimental results achieved on 2010 i2b2/VA reference standard corpora using bidirectional LSTM CRF ranks closely with top ranked systems.",
