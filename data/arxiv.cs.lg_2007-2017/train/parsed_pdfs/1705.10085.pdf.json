      "text" : "Consider a security analyst examining user access logs of a large database system. A blatant security breach might involve a user with insufficient clearance attempting to access a restricted database table. However, there could be more subtle indicators of suspicious activity, such as users accessing database tables that are atypical of their past behavioral pattern, or at unusual times. Moreover, in a distributed attack, perhaps no single user has done anything particularly out of the ordinary, but the general pattern of access to different database tables is atypical in terms of frequency, time of day, etc.\nThe difficulty stemming from the nebulous definition of potentially suspicious activity is compounded by the fact that severe anomalies, by their very nature, are extremely rare occurrences, and when the goal is to learn to identify them, we generally do not expect the available training data to contain any examples. Furthermore, due to the large number of users and database tables in a typical system, a naive solution, which classifies all previously unseen access events as anomalies, will tend to trigger many false alarms. The latter issue is exacerbated further by the problem of ∗Ben-Gurion University of the Negev †IBM Security Division, Israel\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n10 08\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C R\n] 2\n9 M\ncold start [Su and Khoshgoftaar, 2009] — that is, the activity of previously unseen users (say, new employees). This activity should not automatically be classified as an anomaly, or else too many false alarms will be issued. Thus, a main challenge of anomaly detection of temporal events from a complex system is to calibrate the surprise level associated with incoming events — and this is the central challenge that we address.\nProblem description. In this paper we address the problem of unsupervised anomaly detection in a temporal sequence of user-object access events. The events might be employees accessing different database tables, users interacting with a website, customers executing transactions, and so on. We assume that the users and the objects are atomic (that is, known by a name or identification number only). Time is discretized into fixed units (such as hours), and for each time unit, the access activity is recorded in a binary user-object incidence matrix.\nOur goal in this work is to develop an anomaly detection method which allows identifying distributed attacks. Such attacks cannot be characterized by a single suspicious access event — the latter can be handled by more direct means, such as a permission system; instead, they are characterized by system-wide suspicious access patterns. Thus, our goal is to detect anomalous time intervals, i.e. segments of activity that contain atypical behavior. This presents a host of novel issues, not present in static problems. We detect anomalies at the application-specified time scale, since it is intuitively clear that what might be considered anomalous at the scale of a minute is rather different from the same notion at the scale of hours or days. While we focus in this work on deciding whether a given time interval is anomalous, the proposed method could be adapted also to diagnosing a specific user’s behavior, or a specific object’s access pattern, as anomalous within a time interval. We leave the study of this adaptation to future work.\nFrom a bird’s eye view, our approach consists of two orthogonal components: (1) fitting a generative model to the data and (2) assigning an anomaly score to new time segments based on the model we learned. Conceptually, the first component is fairly standard in anomaly detection applications — though the choice of generative model must be carried out judiciously. As we explain in the sequel, some natural candidates (such as Markov models or HMMs) are not appropriate for our setting. Given the high number, and atomicity, of users and objects in our application, we propose a model based on a low-rank assumption. Such a model allows decomposing users and objects into latent factors [Srebro et al., 2004], and discovering abnormal behavior patterns based on the latent factors of a user or object. We extend to our setting previous theoretical results on the sample complexity of learning such a model.\nOur main methodological innovation is in step (2). Here, the likelihood assigned to an observed behavior pattern, based on the fitted model, is converted into an anomaly score. We propose to learn the expected likelihood score from the training data, as an independent regression problem, and then to use the disparity between the predicted and observed likelihood scores as a measure of surprise. Thus, we compensate for characteristic discrepancies between the learned model and the observed behavior at certain times. For instance, it is expected that the activity will be different during different hours of the day. However, learning separate models for each possible activity type is prohibitive, for both statistical and computational reasons. Our approach enables us to learn a single model, yet adapt the anomaly score to time-varying normal behavior patterns.\nThis work was motivated by studying a real database monitoring system, with anomaly detection among its goals. We provide a new data set, which we call TDA (Temporal Database Accesses). It was generated by recording user accesses in a live database system (of the kind often monitored for anomalous behavior) over a two-month period. The data recorded thousands of users and database tables, and the rate of events was approximately 20, 000 per hour. The data is\nprovided in the form of binary access matrices indicating accesses over one-hour-long intervals. The full dataset will be made publicly available, and is provided in the supplementary material."

      "text" : "Intrusion detection methods can be roughly clustered into two main categories: rules-based and learning-based methods [Santos et al., 2014]. This paper deals with the latter, in a temporal setting. Temporal analysis [Lee et al., 2000] models the timing and frequencies of user accesses to the database. Approaches based on dependency and relation analysis look for a systematic redundancy in the event co-occurrence log [Chung et al., 1999, Kamra et al., 2008]. Sequence alignment methods [Srivastava et al., 2006] seek common sequences of events, then monitor the system behavior by checking for repetition of these sequences. Some methods gather various statistical information about the user accesses to the database, and use it to model the normal behavior [Spalka and Lehnhardt, 2005, Mathew et al., 2010]. Lee et al. [2002] analyzed SQL patterns in such an application. These approaches are inapplicable to our setting, since they rely on sequential data, while we have only aggregated data from each time interval.\nThe problem of change-point detection, while not strictly a subset of anomaly or intrusion detection, is of some relevance to the temporal setting [Takeuchi and Yamanishi, 2006, Tartakovsky et al., 2006, Höhle, 2010, Khaleghi and Ryabko, 2012, 2014]. A natural approach is to model the temporal process via a Markov or Hidden Markov Model, as was done in Görnitz et al. [2015]. These approaches, however, cannot be feasibly applied to our setting, because of the high dimensionality of the aggregated access matrices. Additionally, our data is aggregated over time intervals rather than being sequential, which precludes a clean application of Markovian techniques. Lakhina et al. [2005] employ a low rank concatenation of entropy matrices for every feature at different intervals, achieved by PCA. Chan et al. [2003], Das and Schneider [2007], Das et al. [2008] use a variant of association rules based on groups to detect anomalies. The main disadvantage of association rules in our context is the inability to cope with new instances.\nOur use of low-rank matrix completion in the context of anomaly detection appears to be novel. However, the technique is well-established in areas of semi-supervised learning and collaborative filtering (e.g., Srebro et al. 2004, Mazumder et al. 2010, Sindhwani et al. 2010, Shamir and Shalev-Shwartz 2014, Hsieh et al. 2015)."

      "heading" : "3 Our approach",
      "text" : "To detect anomalous access patterns, we begin by defining a probabilistic model for normal access patterns. Our approach is based on learning a baseline low-rank stationary model, and then modeling the deviation of the temporal model from the stationary one. This approach enables learning and detection using a feasible number of parameters. Denote the number of different users by n and the number of different objects by m. For simplicity of notation we fix m and n, however in practice they need not be known to the algorithm in advance. We assume that the data is provided as a sequence of consecutive time intervals, where for each time interval t an access matrix Bt ∈ {0, 1}n×m is provided, where Bt(i, j) = I[user i accessed object j]. The length of a time interval is an application-specific parameter.\nThe goal of the algorithm is to assign an anomaly score to each new access matrix Bt which is observed after the training phase. Quite generally, the distribution of Bt might be modeled using a matrix πt ∈ [0, 1]n×m, where πt(i, j) is the probability that user i accesses object j during time\ninterval t, and different entries in Bt are assumed statistically independent. Thus, at time interval t, any possible observation matrix G ∈ {0, 1}n×m would be assigned a probability of\nP[Bt = G] = Pπt [Bt = G] := ∏\ni∈[n],j∈[m]\nπt(i, j) G(i,j)(1− πt(i, j))1−G(i,j). (1)\nThis model allocates a separate set of parameters for each time interval, and is incapable of extrapolating beyond past observations. Hence, we instead posit a single baseline matrix π̄ ∈ [0, 1]n×m, which approximates a stationary (time-independent) distribution. This matrix can be thought of as a rough approximation of πt for all time intervals t. It induces a distribution on observation matrices in a manner analogous to Eq. (1): P[Bt = G] = Pπ̄[Bt = G]. This model is similar to the one proposed in Davenport et al. [2014] for a non-temporal variant of matrix completion from probabilistic binary observations. We take the standard approach of assuming that π̄ is low-rank, motivated by the intuition that the relevance of a user to an object can be explained by a small number of latent factors (see, e.g., Su and Khoshgoftaar [2009], Sindhwani et al. [2010], Leskovec et al. [2014]).\nHaving obtained an approximation π̂ to π̄ based on the training set, we can calculate the log-likelihood of an observation matrix G at time interval t, as induced by the parameters π̂:\nLL(G, π̂) := logPπ̂[G] = ∑ i,j (G(i, j) log π̂(i, j) + (1−G(i, j)) log(1− π̂(i, j))) .\nAt this point, one might consider assigning time interval t an anomaly score based on the value LL(Bt, π̂), where Bt is the actual matrix observed at time t: a lower log-likelihood value would indicate a higher anomaly level. The problem with this proposal is that it is likely that some time intervals will systematically exhibit behavior that deviates significantly from that of π̄, and these systematic deviations should not be classified as anomalies. For instance, it is expected that access patterns will differ between night and day, weekdays and weekends, holidays and workdays, and so on, as well as being affected by application-specific circumstances. Thus, if the application monitors a software company’s database accesses, scheduled days of major version updates will likely have patterns different from other days. Thus, we need some way of accounting for systematic, non-anomalous, differences between time intervals.\nWe address this issue by proposing a compromise between the overly constraining stationary model defined by π̄ and the overly rich model in Eq. (1). Our approach is to model the similarity between πt and π̄ in terms of properties of the time interval t. This similarity can be formalized using the cross-entropy between π̄ and πt. Recall that the cross-entropy between two discrete distributions p, q isH(p, q) := − ∑ i pi log(qi). For two distributions defined as above by matrices π1, π2 ∈ [0, 1]m×n, we have\nH(π1, π2) = ∑ i,j HBer(π1(i, j), π2(i, j)),\nwhere HBer(a, b) for a, b ∈ [0, 1] is the cross-entropy between the distributions Bernoulli(a) and Bernoulli(b). The expected value of the measured log-likelihood score LL(Bt, π̂) satisfies\nEBt∼πt [LL(Bt, π̂)] = −H(πt, π̂).\nTherefore, if the actual log-likelihood score LL(Bt, π̂) is far from −H(πt, π̂), this can be considered an anomalous behavior. The value of H(πt, π̂) cannot be computed, since πt is unknown.\nInstead, we train a predictor in order to estimate it. Each time-interval t is represented by a vector vt ∈ Rd of d time-dependent real-valued features, such as time-of-day, day-of-weak, day-ofmonth, auto-regressive features (such as the log-likelihood in a previous interval) and possibly application-specific features (such as a binary indicator major-version-delivery). Using these time dependent features, we fit a linear regression model vt 7→ 〈ŵ, vt〉 parametrized by ŵ ∈ Rd, where LL(Bt, π̂) ≈ 〈ŵ, vt〉 on the training set.1 We then define the anomaly score of a new observed time interval t by\nDeviation(π̂, Bt, t) = |LL(Bt, π̂)− 〈ŵ, vt〉|. (2)\nThis approach enables identifying anomalous behavior, while avoiding many of the false-alarms resulting from normal differences between time intervals.\nLastly, we address the issue of cold-start [Su and Khoshgoftaar, 2009]. So far, we have assumed that each user and object appears at least once in the training data. This is unlikely in many scenarios. For instance, in the database-access setting, new employees and new database tables can be added over time. If the application monitors an open environment such as a public web site, then the users and objects modeled in π̄ could be a small minority of the set of users and objects observed during the deployment of the system. We address this issue by applying a process commonly known as folding (e.g., Deerwester et al. [1990], Manning and Schütze [1999]) to incorporate the new users or objects into the model on the fly.\nIn the next section we give a detailed account of the full anomaly detection algorithm."

      "text" : "We describe the two phases of the algorithm: the training phase and the anomaly-detection phase. In the training phase, the algorithm has access to a training set S = (B1, . . . , BT ), where Bt are binary access matrices of consecutive time intervals. The algorithm splits the training set into two parts, S1 = (B1, . . . , BT1), S2 = (BT1+1, . . . , BT ). S1 is used to find an estimator π̂ for the probabilistic stationary model π̄, as described in Section 4.1. S2 is used to fit the log-likelihood regressor ŵ. The full training phase is given in Section 4.2.\nIn the anomaly-detection phase, an access matrix is provided as input for each time interval, and the algorithm outputs an anomaly score for each such matrix using Eq. (2). The system could now present a ranking of all the intervals by anomaly score in a specific time frame, or display the top few, as specified by the desired user interface.\nFor simplicity of presentation, we describe the two phases under the assumption that no new users or objects appear after the model π̂ is estimated. We explain in Section 4.3 how the algorithm can be seamlessly adapted to handle new users or objects.\nThe most computationally expensive step in the algorithm is the SVD procedure in Alg. 1 below, which, naively, is cubic in the matrix dimensions. However, since in many applications the matrices are sparse, a sparse SVD algorithm could speed up computation (e.g., Larsen 2000). All other procedures are linear in m and/or n, as should be clear from context. Below we use several matrix norms. For a real-valued matrix A ∈ Rm×n, denote the nuclear (trace) norm by ‖A‖tr = ∑ i σi, where σi are the singular values of A. Denote the Frobenius norm by\n‖A‖F = ( ∑m i=1 ∑n j=1A 2 i,j) 1 2 . Denote the spectral norm of by ‖A‖sp = maxσi.\n1Central to this approach is the assumption that anomalous intervals are very rare, and so the model is trained almost exclusively on non-anomalous behavior."

      "text" : "Our probabilistic estimation problem in the first part of the training process is to estimate a low-rank probability matrix π̂ based on the sequence of matrices S1 = (B1, . . . , BT1), where Bt records accesses in time interval t. In our simplified probabilistic model, the Bt are assumed to be drawn i.i.d. according to some low-rank matrix π̄. As discussed in Section 3, this i.i.d. assumption is a deliberate simplification, which ignores possible time-dependencies in the probabilistic model.\nOur probabilistic model, and our low-rank assumption on π̄, are similar to those studied in Davenport et al. [2014], Hsieh et al. [2015]. However, in these works it is assumed that only one access matrix drawn from π̄ is available, while we have several matrices available at training time. A standard approach for finding a low-rank estimate [Fazel, 2002] is to minimize the mean-squared error of the matrix difference, and regularize using the trace norm, which is a convex relaxation of the low-rank constraint:\nF (B, λ) := min π̂ ∈[0,1]n×m\n‖π̂ −B‖2F + λ‖π̂‖tr. (3)\nHere λ > 0 balances the trade-off between fidelity to B and the low-rank structure. Existing generalization bounds [Davenport et al., 2014, Shamir and Shalev-Shwartz, 2014, Hsieh et al., 2015] give guarantees for the mean-squared-loss of the solution to the optimization problem in Eq. (3), for the case where B is a single matrix drawn according to π̄. Our approach to finding the low-rank structure is similar to the above, however instead of considering a single binary matrix B, we use the average matrix B̄ = 1T1 ∑T1 t=1Bt. In Appendix A in the supplementary we prove a generalization bound for F (B̄, λ), which converges to the true low-rank model as T1 increases. An efficient solution to the unconstrained version of Eq. (3), with π̂ ∈ Rn×m, is given in Mazumder et al. [2010]: For a real-valued matrix A, let SVD(A) be the Singular Value Decomposition ofA. Let r be the rank of the matrix B̄, and let (U,D, V T) = SVD(B̄). Mazumder et al. [2010] show that\nargmin π̂ ‖π̂ − B̄‖2F + λ‖π̂‖tr = UDλ/2V T, (4)\nwhereDλ = [max(d1−λ, 0), ...,max(dr−λ, 0)]. In practice, Shamir and Shalev-Shwartz [2014] observed that the solutions to Eq. (4) typically nearly satisfy the constraint π̂ ∈ [0, 1]n×m, with few values slightly outside [0, 1]. For these values, they propose a simple clipping to fit them into [0, 1]. This approach reportedly results in solutions that are very similar to those obtained by solving the full constrained minimization; this matches our empirical observations. Hence, we follow the same approach. The full procedure for finding a model matrix π̂ given a regularization parameter λ and a training set S is given in Alg. 1.\nAlgorithm 1 FindModel(λ, S): Find model matrix Require: λ > 0, training data S = (B1, . . . , BK) Ensure: π̂\n1: B̄ ← 1K ∑K i=1Bt. 2: (U,D, V T)← SVD(B̄). 3: π′ ← UDλ/2V T. 4: For each i ∈ [m], j ∈ [n], set π̂(i, j)← min(1,max(π̂′(i, j), 0)). 5: Return π̂.\nNote that while in the rest of our algorithm we use log-likelihood as a measure of fit between the model π̂ and the observed matrix Bt, in Eq. (3) the Frobenius norm is used instead, and our generalization bound, given in Appendix A, bounds the mean-squared error. The reason is two-fold: first, as evident in our analysis, the Frobenius norm lends itself to a stable low-rank matrix approximation because of its Lipschitz property. Such a property does not hold for the loglikelihood loss near zero. Second, optimizing π̂ based on the log-likelihood requires significantly more computational resources. In particular, because of the sensitivity of the log-likelihood near 0, optimizing this objective without constraints tends to push the solution far outside the [0, 1] range, and clipping no longer helps. Instead, one is faced with solving a much more heavily constrained optimization problem, which presents a prohibitive computational cost for a run-of-the-mill system. Our experiments show that despite this apparent mismatch between the loss functions, the empirical results are promising. In future work, we plan to study efficient methods for directly optimizing the log-likelihood."

      "text" : "In the algorithm description above, we avoided the issue of users or objects that are observed for the first time only after the first phase of training, that is, after π̂ has been estimated. Such new elements might be observed for the first time during the regression phase, or later during the deployment phase, as anomaly scores are being computed. In the context of collaborative filtering, this issue is commonly known as the cold start problem [Su and Khoshgoftaar, 2009]. In our setting, the challenge is to assign likelihood scores to matrices Bt which include new rows or columns that do no appear in π̂.\nPrevious solutions to the cold start problem in the context of collaborative filtering have suggested finding an existing user whose pattern of accesses most resembles that of the new user, and assigning the new user the same prediction as the existing user or a weighted score of the most similar users [Shardanand and Maes, 1995]. Our setup is slightly different, since we are not attempting to predict the values of specific matrix entries. Our solution relies on similar ideas but adapts them to our setting. To calculate the log-likelihood of a matrix Bt which includes rows or columns not present in π̂, we calculate a new version of π̂ which extends to these rows and columns. The process is based on finding similar users/objects in latent space, the low-rank space spanned by π̂.\nEach new user or object is projected onto latent space, via a process commonly known as folding [Manning and Schütze, 1999]. Then, we find its nearest neighbor in the existing π̂, based on the distances in latent space. Finally, we assign the new row/column the same probability vector as its nearest neighbor. Using distances in latent space carries two advantages: first, these are less liable to overfit. Second, this allows storing and searching over smaller matrices, instead of the original training matrix B̄, which is usually significantly larger.\nMore formally, let B̄1 = 1T1 ∑T1 i=1Bi ∈ Rn×m be the matrix representing the aggregate access data from the training set S1. Let π̂ = USV T be the rank-k model estimated in the first step of the training phase. Let G = B̄1V ∈ Rn×k and H = B̄T1 U ∈ Rm×k. Let Gi be the i’th row in G, and let Hj be the j’th row in H . These are the latent representations of user i and object j from B̄1, respectively. Alg. 2 gives the procedure FoldedLL for calculating the folded log-likelihood of a new observation matrix Bt, assuming for simplicity that all new users/objects appear in the last rows/columns of Bt and its dimensions are n′,m′. The training algorithm and the procedure for assigning an anomaly score, described above, can be easily adapted to handle cold start, by replacing LL in the regression learning step and in the anomaly score step with FoldedLL. It should be noted that this approach will not work if the observed time interval has no shared users or objects with the model π̂, or very few of them. A possible remedy is to attempt to identify when this situation is about to occur, and to retrain the stationary model π̂. We leave this issue to future work."

A perfect result for the anomalous interval would be the maximal percentile of 100%. The results of our algorithm are compared to a baseline algorithm, which uses an anomaly score based only on the deviation from the mean log-likelihood in the regression training set, without adjusting for temporal differences using regression. This algorithm is labeled MEAN in the plots.\nTable 1 specifies the dataset paramters. For Netflix we used the timespan between 11-Mar-99 and 19-Apr-04, since data was incomplete for later periods. For Movielens we used years 2010 to 2014, inclusive. The following time-dependent features were used for regression: A binary “weekend” feature, the log-likelihood of the previous interval and of the one 24 hours ago, the number of total accesses in the current interval, and the length of time (in time-interval units) since the time of the last interval in the training set S1. In addition, in TDA we used the hour of the day h ∈ {1, . . . , 24} and the shifted hour h+ 12 mod 24. In Netflix and Movielens, we used a day-of-the-week feature.\nAccuracy of regression We plot, for each dataset, the true log-likelihood of each test interval against the predicted log-likelihood based on the learned regressor ŵ. A straight diagonal line would indicate a perfect prediction. We observe that the regression-based prediction is quite successful for these datasets, indicating that the use of a linear regressor here is reasonable. The plots and the correlation coefficients (ρ) are provided in Figure 1 (Top).\nRandom accesses In this experiment, an anomalous interval was simulated by adding random accesses to a random test interval: Each bit in the interval’s access matrix was changed to 1 with an independent probability of > 0. The average anomaly score percentile of our algorithm and MEAN, over a 100 random experiments, against the value of log10( ), are plotted in Figure 1 (Bottom). The regression model improved the identification of the anomaly in a wide range of noise levels.\nAccesses at an anomalous time In this experiment, we simulated a behavior which is normal at one time, but possibly anomalous at a different time: two random intervals t1 and t2 were selected from the test set, and we set Bt1 ← Bt2 . We repeated this experiment 100 times. Table 2 lists the percent of changed intervals that were identified in the 95% anomaly percentile or above. The full distribution of both algorithm’s outputs is provided in Figure 2. The histograms depict the percent of anomalous intervals in each anomaly score percentile, in the MEAN algorithm and in our algorithm.\nIndeed, our algorithm identifies a significant proportion of the intervals as anomalous, while the baseline algorithm does not. Note that we do not expect a 100% success here: if t1 and t2 happen to have a similar pattern, e.g., they are at the same hour of the day, the new Bt1 should not be considered anomalous."

Moreover, if S = (B1, . . . , BT ) and B̄ = 1T ∑T t=1Bt, we have\n‖π̂ − B̄‖2F = ‖π̂‖2F − 2〈π̂, B̄〉+ ‖B̄‖2F = 1\nT T∑ t=1 ‖π̂ −Bt‖2F − 1 T T∑ t=1 ‖Bt‖2F + ‖B̄‖2F .\nTherefore,\n‖π̂ − B̄‖2F = 1\nT T∑ t=1 ‖π̂ −Bt‖2F + C = mn · 1 T T∑ t=1 MSE(π̂, Bt) + C,\nwhere C is a constant independent of π̂. By a similar derivation, for another constant C ′ independent of π̂,\nEB∼π̄[MSE(π̂, B)] = MSE(π̂, π̄) + C ′. Therefore, if |EB∼π̄[MSE(π̂, B)] − 1T ∑T t=1 MSE(π̂, Bt)| is small, finding F (B̄, λ) is a good proxy for minimizing MSE(π̂, π̄). We prove a more general claim, which bounds the diffrence between the empirical loss and the true loss of a general Lipschitz loss, which we define below. Our result generalizes a result from Hsieh et al. [2015] to the case of a training sample with several matrices. The proof employs techniques from Hsieh et al. [2015] and Shamir and Shalev-Shwartz [2014].\nLet ` : [0, 1]× [0, 1]→ R+ be a loss function. For two matrices A,B ∈ [0, 1]n×m, let\n`(A,B) := 1\nnm ∑ i∈[n],j∈[m] `(A(i, j), B(i, j)).\nFor L > 0, ` is L-Lipschitz in the first argument if\n∀x, x′, y ∈ R, |`(x, y)− `(x′, y)| ≤ L|x− x′|,\nwith an analogous definition for the second argument. For a matrix X ∈ [0, 1]n×m and a distribution P over matrices [0, 1]n×m; denote the true loss of X by `(X,P ) := EY ∈P [`(X,Y )]. For a (multi)set S ⊆ [0, 1]n×m, denote the empirical loss of X on S by `(X,S) := 1|S| ∑ Y ∈S [`(X,Y )].\nThe theorem below gives a guarantee for L-Lipschitz losses. Note that for the squared-loss ` := MSE, where MSE(x, y) := (x−y)2, ` is 2-Lipschitz in both arguments: For x, x′, y ∈ [0, 1],\n|(x− y)2 − (x′ − y)2| = |x2 − x′2 − 2xy + 2x′y| = |(x− x′)(x+ x′)− 2y(x− x′)| = |(x− x′)(x+ x′ − 2y)| = |(x− x′)||(x+ x′ − 2y)| ≤ 2|x− x′|.\nThus the theorem below holds for the MSE loss with L = 2, proving that as the size of the training set grows, minimizing Eq. (3) converges to a minimization of MSE(π̂, π̄) with high probability. In the following theorem and proof, we use c to indicate a universal constant, whose value can change from line to line.\nTheorem A.1. Let `(x, y) be anL-Lipschitz loss. Let π̄ ∈ [0, 1]n×m, and letDπ̄ be the distribution satisfying the probabilistic model defined in Section 3. Assume w.l.o.g. that m ≥ n. Let S = (B1, B2, . . . , BT ) ∼ Dmπ̄ be an i.i.d. sample from Dπ̄ . With a probability of at least 1− δ, for all π ∈ [0, 1]n×m such that ‖π‖tr ≤ γ,\n|`(π,Dπ̄)− `(π, S)| ≤ c Lγ\nn √ mT + L\n√ ln( 2δ )\n2Tmn .\nProof. Let Π ⊆ [0, 1]n×m. Denote ψ(S) := supπ∈Π(`(π,Dπ̄)− `(π, S)). By definition,\n∀π ∈ Π, `(π,Dπ̄) ≤ `(π, S) + ψ(S). (5)\nNote that the sample S has Tnm independent (though not identically distributed) entries. Thus, we upper-bound ψ(S) with high probability using McDiarmid’s inequality [McDiarmid, 1989], which states that if for every two samples S, S′ which differ by a single entry, |ψ(S)−ψ(S′)| ≤ α, then\nP [ψ(S)− E[ψ(S)] ≥ ] ≤ e −2 2 Tnmα2 .\nTo bound α, consider two samples, S, S′, where the matrices in S are denoted Bt and the matrices in S′ are denoted B′t. Suppose that S\n′ differs from S by a single entry (i, j) in the matrix Bto , such that Bto(i, j) = 1 and B ′ to(i, j) = 0. We have\n|ψ(S)− ψ(S′)| = | sup π (`(π,Dπ̄)− `(π, S))− sup π (`(π,Dπ̄)− `(π, S′))|.\nFor bounded f, g : R → R, it holds that | supx f(x) − supx g(x)| ≤ | supx(f(x) − g(x))|. Therefore\n|ψ(S)− ψ(S′)| ≤ 1 T | sup π ∑ t (`(π,Bt)− `(π,B′t))|\n= 1\nTmn | sup π (`(π(i, j), Bto(i, j))− `(π(i, j), B′to(i, j))|\n≤ L Tmn |Bto(i, j)−B′to(i, j)]| ≤ L Tmn ,\nWhere we used the fact that ` is L-Lipschitz in the second argument. Setting α = L/(Tnm) and applying McDiarmid’s inequality, we get\nP[ψ(S)− E[ψ(S)] ≥ ] ≤ e−2 2Tmn/L2 .\nSetting the latter to δ2 , we obtain that with a probability of at least 1− δ 2 ,\nψ(S) ≤ E[ψ(S)] + L\n√ ln( 2δ )\n2Tmn . (6)\nIt remains to bound E[ψ(S)]. Let S′ = (B′1, . . . , B′T ) ∼ DTπ̄ be a sample which is independent from S. Following a standard symmetrization argument as in Hsieh et al. [2015], we have\nE[ψ(S)] = ES [sup π (`(π,Dπ̄)− `(π, S))]]\n= ES [sup π\n(ES′ [`(π, S′)− `(π, S)])]\n≤ ES,S′ [sup π\n(`(π, S′)− `(π, S))]\n= 1\nmnT ES,S′ sup π ∑ i,j,t `(π(i, j), B′t(i, j))− `(π(i, j), Bt(i, j))  . Letting σi,j,t ∼ Uniform{−1, 1} for i ∈ [n], j ∈ [m], t ∈ [T ] be independent Rademacher variables, it follows that\nE[ψ(S)] = 1\nmnT ES,S′,σ sup π ∑ i,j,t σi,j,t ( `(π(i, j), B′t(i, j))− `(π(i, j), Bt(i, j)) ) ≤ 2 mnT ES,σ sup π ∑ i,j,t σi,j,t`(π(i, j), Bt(i, j))\n ≤ 2L mnT Eσ  sup π(i,j) ∑ i,j,t σi,j,tπ(i, j).\n (7) The last inequality follows from Talagrand’s contraction principle [Ledoux and Talagrand, 1991], together with the fact that `(x, y) is L-Lipschitz in both arguments.\nNow, denoting νi,j := ∑ t σi,j,t, we observe that\nEσ sup π ∑ i,j,t σi,j,tπ(i, j)  = Eσ sup π ∑ i,j π(i, j) ∑ t σi,j,t  = Eσ sup π ∑ i,j π(i, j)νi,j  . Since the nuclear and spectral norms are dual [e.g., Horn and Johnson, 2013, p. 362], a matrix\nHölder inequality holds, where ν is the matrix with entries νi,j :∑ i,j π(i, j)νi,j ≤ ‖π‖tr‖ν‖sp .\nTherefore, combining with Eq. (7), and assuming supπ∈Π ‖π‖tr ≤ γ, it follows that\nE[ψ(S)] ≤ 2L mnT Eσ[sup π∈Π ‖π‖tr‖ν‖sp ] ≤ 2Lγ mnT Eσ[‖ν‖sp ]. (8)\nIt remains to bound Eσ [ ||ν||\nsp\n] . To this end, recall the following result of Latała [2005]:\nThere is a universal constant c > 0 such that for any random matrix Z ∈ Rn×m with independent mean-zero entries, we have\nE [ ||Z||\nsp\n] ≤ c max i √∑ j E [Z(i, j)2] + max j √∑ i E [Z(i, j)2] + 4 √ E [Z(i, j)4]  .\nNow νi,j is a sum of T i.i.d. Rademacher random variables, and thus E[νi,j ] = 0 and E[ν2i,j ] = T . To bound the 4th moment, we appeal to Khinchine’s inequality [Boucheron et al., 2013, Exercise 5.10], which states that E[ν4i,j ] ≤ 4!2·22E[ν 2 i,j ]\n2 = 3T 2. Substituting these moment bounds into Latała’s bound, we get\nE [ ||ν||sp ] ≤ c (√ nT + √ mT + 4 √ nm √ T ) .\nSince 4 √ nm ≤ 12 ( √ n + √ m) and m ≥ n, we have E [ ||ν||sp ] ≤ c √ Tm. Substituting this into Eq. (8), we get\nE[ψ(S)] ≤ c Lγ n √ mT .\nCombining this with Eq. (6) yields that with probability of at least 1− δ2 , if\nψ(S) ≤ c Lγ n √ mT + L\n√ ln( 2δ )\n2Tmn .\nCombining this with Eq. (5) and the observation that\n∀π ∈ Π `(π,Dπ) ≤ `(π, S) + sup π′∈Π (`(π′,Dπ)− `(π′, S)) ≤ `(π, S) + ψ(S),\nwe get that if supπ∈Π ‖π‖tr ≤ γ, then with probability of at least 1− δ2 ,\n∀π ∈ Π, `(π,Dπ̄)− `(π, S) ≤ c Lγ\nn √ mT + L\n√ ln( 2δ )\n2Tmn .\nAn analogous argument yields the same bound for `(π, S)− `(π,Dπ̄), which implies the statement of the theorem via a union bound."

Our methodology allows identifying anomalies based on a single stationary model, instead of requiring a full temporal one, which would be prohibitive in our setting. We learn our low-rank stationary model from the high-dimensional training data, and then fit a regression model for predicting the expected likelihood score of normal access patterns in the future. The disparity between the predicted and the observed likelihood scores is used to assess the “surprise”. This approach enables calibration of the anomaly score so that time-varying normal behavior patterns are not considered anomalous. We provide a detailed description of the algorithm, including a convergence analysis, and report encouraging empirical results. One of the datasets we tested is new for the public domain. It consists of two months’ worth of database access records from a live system. This dataset will be made publicly available, and is provided in the supplementary material.",
