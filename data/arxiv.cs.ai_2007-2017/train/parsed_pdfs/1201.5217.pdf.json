      "text" : "Unsupervised classification which also known as data clustering is defined as the problem of classifying a collection of objects into a set of natural clusters without any a priori knowledge. Many clustering methods were proposed. These methods can be basically classified into two categories: hierarchical and partitional. In contrast to hierarchical clustering, which yields a successive level of clusters by iterative fusions or divisions, partitional clustering assigns a set of data points into K clusters without any hierarchical structure. This process usually accompanies the optimization of a criterion function [1]. One of the widely used partitional method is the K-means algorithm. It is an iterative hill-climbing algorithm. Many of stochastic optimization methods were used in clustering problem Such as genetic algorithms GAs [2-5], simulated annealing (SA) [6-8] and tabu search (TS) [9].\nArtificial Immune Systems (AIS) is a field of study devoted to the development of computational models based on the principles of the biological immune system. It is an emerging area that explores and employs different immunological mechanisms to\nsolve computational problems [10] A lot of immune algorithms were developed aiming to finding solutions to a broad class of complex problems. Applications of AIS have included the following areas: clustering and classification [11-15], anomaly detection [16-18], optimization [13, 19], control [20-21],\ncomputer security, learning, bio-informatics, image processing, robotics, virus detection and web mining [22].\nMany of the immune algorithms use principles inspired by the clonal selection theory of acquired immunity. The clonal selection principle is used by the immune system to describe the basic features of an immune response to an antigenic stimulus. It establishes the idea that only those cells that recognize the antigens proliferate, thus being selected against those which do not. The process of proliferating called clonal expansion. The selected cells are subject to an affinity maturation process which improves their affinity to the selective antigens [23]. The first clonal selection algorithm was proposed by [13] which named CLONALG and used for optimization. Other versions of clonal selection algorithm are designed to improve the performance of CLONALG such as [24-26].\nIn this study, we tried to investigate the possibility of using clonal selection algorithm as stochastic optimization methods for clustering. Unsupervised classification algorithm based on clonal selection principle named Unsupervised Clonal Selection Classification (UCSC) is proposed. The new algorithm is data driven and self-adaptive, it adjusts its parameters to the data to make the classification operation as fast as possible. The proposed approach has been tested on several artificial and reallife data sets and its performance is compared with the well known K-means algorithm [1]. Experiments show that UCSC algorithm is more reliable and has high classification precision comparing to traditional classification methods such as K-means."

      "text" : "In UCSC, clustering problem is considered as optimization problem and the objective is to find the optimal partitions of data where the resulting clusters tend to be compact as possible. A simple criterion which is the within cluster spread is used in UCSC, this criterion needs to be minimized for good clustering. Unlike K-means which uses the square-error criterion to measure the within cluster spread, UCSC uses the sum of the Euclidean Distances of the points from their respective cluster centroids as clustering metric and uses clonal selection algorithm as clustering algorithm which ensures finding the global optima when most of others algorithms such as K-means stuck into local optima. The number of clusters K is supposed to be known and the appropriate cluster centers m1, m2,…,mk have to be found such that the clustering metric J is minimized. Mathematically,\nthe clustering metric J for the K clusters C={C1, C2, …, CK } is given by the following equation:\nK\ni\nN\nj ijij mxJ 1 1 )M,( (1)\nwhere djx , j = 1,…, N are data points, }{ ij is a\npartition matrix witch given by the eq.

Based on clustering criterion, UCSC is supposed to give right results if the clusters are compact and hyperspherical in shape."

Even a small change in any of these aspects may lead to a considerable change in the performance of clonal selection algorithms [26].\nThe UCSC algorithm is summarized as follows: Initialization: generate population P of n antibodies (candidate solutions) randomly For every generation do: {\naffinity measure of all antibodies in P\nclone P generating a population PC\nsubmit PC to hypermutation scheme generating Pm consolidate P & Pm affinity measure of all antibodies re-select the n highest affinity to form P\nGenerate new L individuals (randomly) replace the L lowest affinity antibodies in P with the new ones }\nfinally: select the highest affinity antibody in P which is the solution These steps will be described in details next."

The new proposed algorithm is data driven and self-adaptive, it adjusts its parameters to the data to make the classification operation as fast as possible. The performance of UCSC is evaluated by comparing it with the well known K-means algorithm using several artificial and real-life data sets. The experiments show that the proposed UCSC algorithm is more reliable and has high classification precision comparing to traditional classification methods such as K-means.
