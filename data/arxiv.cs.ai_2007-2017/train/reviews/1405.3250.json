We present several results. First, we describe a lifted inference algorithm that generalizes prior approaches in SRL and PDB. Second, we provide a novel dichotomy result for a non-trivial fragment of FO CNF sentences, showing that for each sentence the WFOMC problem is either in PTIME or #P-hard in the size of the input domain; we prove that, in the first case our algorithm solves the WFOMC problem in PTIME, and in the second case it fails. Third, we present several properties of the algorithm. Finally, we discuss limitations of lifted inference for symmetric probabilistic databases (where the weights of ground literals depend only on the relation name, and not on the constants of the domain), and prove the impossibility of a dichotomy result for the complexity of probabilistic inference for the entire language FOL.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 May 2014 18:39:11 GMT  (50kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3250v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Jul 2014 17:31:31 GMT  (50kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3250v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB cs.LO", "authors": ["eric gribkoff", "guy van den broeck", "dan suciu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3250"}
