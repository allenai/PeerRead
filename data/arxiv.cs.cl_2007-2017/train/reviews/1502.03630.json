In most previous work, the \"bag-of-words\" assumption is usually made which ignores the ordering of words. This assumption simplifies the computation, but it unrealistically loses the ordering information and the semantic of words in the context. In this paper, we present a Gaussian Mixture Neural Topic Model (GMNTM) which incorporates both the ordering of words and the semantic meaning of sentences into topic modeling. Specifically, we represent each topic as a cluster of multi-dimensional vectors and embed the corpus into a collection of vectors generated by the Gaussian mixture model. Each word is affected not only by its topic, but also by the embedding vector of its surrounding words and the context. The Gaussian mixture components and the topic of documents, sentences and words can be learnt jointly. Extensive experiments show that our model can learn better topics and more accurate word distributions for each topic. Quantitatively, comparing to state-of-the-art topic modeling approaches, GMNTM obtains significantly better performance in terms of perplexity, retrieval accuracy and classification accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Feb 2015 12:32:39 GMT  (44kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03630v1", "To appear in proceedings of AAAI 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in proceedings of AAAI 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["min yang", "tianyi cui", "wenting tu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.03630"}
