{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Human perception in computer vision", "abstract": "Computer vision has made remarkable progress in recent years. Deep neural network (DNN) models optimized to identify objects in images exhibit unprecedented task-trained accuracy and, remarkably, some generalization ability: new visual problems can now be solved more easily based on previous learning. Biological vision (learned in life and through evolution) is also accurate and general-purpose. Is it possible that these different learning regimes converge to similar problem-dependent optimal computations? We therefore asked whether the human system-level computation of visual perception has DNN correlates and considered several anecdotal test cases. We found that perceptual sensitivity to image changes has DNN mid-computation correlates, while sensitivity to segmentation, crowding and shape has DNN end-computation correlates. Our results quantify the applicability of using DNN computation to estimate perceptual loss, and are consistent with the fascinating theoretical view that properties of human perception are a consequence of architecture-independent visual learning.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The paper reports several connections between the image representations in state-of-the are object recognition networks and findings from human visual psychophysics:\n1) It shows that the mean L1 distance in the feature space of certain CNN layers is predictive of human noise-detection thresholds in natural images.\n2) It reports that for 3 different 2-AFC tasks for which there exists a condition that is hard and one that is easy for humans, the mutual information between decision label and quantised CNN activations is usually higher in the condition that is easier for humans.\n3) It reproduces the general bandpass nature of contrast/frequency detection sensitivity in humans. \n\nWhile these findings appear interesting, they are also rather anecdotal and some of them seem to be rather trivial (e.g. findings in 2). To make a convincing statement it would be important to explore what aspects of the CNN lead to the reported findings.

The specific psychophysical experiment determined, separately for each of a set of approx. 1110 images, what the noise level of additive noise would have to be to make a just-noticeable-difference for humans in discriminating the noiseless image from the noisy one.   The authors then define a metric on neural networks that allows them to measure what they posit might be a similar property for the networks.  They then correlate the pattern of noise levels between neural networks that the humans.    Deep neural networks end up being much better predictors of the human pattern of noise levels than simpler measure of image perturbation (e.g. RMS contrast).  \n\nA second result involves comparing DNNs to humans in terms of their pattern errors in a series of highly controlled experiments using stimuli that illustrate classic properties of human visual processing -- including segmentation, crowding and shape understanding.  They then used an information-theoretic single-neuron metric of discriminability to assess similar patterns of errors for the DNNs.   Again, top layers of DNNs were able to reproduce the human patterns of difficulty across stimuli, at least to some extent. \n\nA third result involves comparing DNNs to humans in terms of their pattern of contrast sensitivity across a series of sine-grating images at different frequencies.  (There is a classic result from vision research as to what this pattern should be, so it makes a natural target for comparison to models.)   The authors define a DNN correlate for the propertie in terms of the cross-neuron average of the L1-distance between responses to a blank image and responses to a sinuisoid of each contrast and frequency.   They then qualitatively compare the results of this metric for DNNs models to known results from the literature on humans, finding that, like humans, there is an apparent bandpass response for low-contrast gratings and a mostly constant response at high contrast.  \n\nPros:\n    * The general concept of comparing deep nets to psychophysical results in a detailed, quantitative way, is really nice.   \n\n    * They nicely defined a set of \"linking functions\", e.g. metrics that express how a specific behavioral result is to be generated from the neural network.  (Ie. the L1 metrics in results 1 and 3 and the information-theoretic measure in result 2.)   The framework for setting up such linking functions seems like a great direction to me. \n\n    * The actual psychophysical data seems to have been handled in a very careful and thoughtful way.   These folks clearly know what they're doing on the psychophysical end.  \n\n\nCons:\n    * To my mind, the biggest problem wit this paper is that that it doesn't say something that we didn't really know already.   Existing results have shown that DNNs are pretty good models of the human visual system in a whole bunch of ways, and this paper adds some more ways.    What would have been great would be: \n         (a) showing that they metric of comparison to humans that was sufficiently sensitive that it could pull apart various DNN models, making one clearly better than the others. \n         (b) identifying a wide gap between the DNNs and the humans that is still unfilled.   They sort of do this, since while the DNNs are good at reproducing the human judgements in Result 1, they are not perfect -- gap is between 60% explained variance and 84% inter-human consistency.    This 24% gap is potentially important, so I'd really like to see them have explored that gap more -- e.g. (i) widening the gap by identifying which images caused the gap most and focusing a test on those, or (ii) closing the gap by training a neural network to get the pattern 100% correct and seeing if that made better CNNs as measured on other metrics/tasks. \n\nIn other words, I would definitely have traded off not having results 2 and 3 for a deeper exploration of result 1.    I think their overall approach could be very fruitful, but it hasn't really been carried far enough here. \n\n   * I found a few things confusing about the layout of the paper.  I especially found that the quantitative results for results 2 and 3 were not clearly displayed.   Why was figure 8 relegated to the appendix?  Where are the quantifications of model-human similarities for the data shown in Figure 8?  Isn't this the whole meat of their second result?   This should really be presented in a more clear way.    \n\n    * Where is the quantification of model-human similarity for the data show in Figure 3?  Isn't there a way to get the human contrast-sensitivity curve and then compare it to that of models in a more quantitively precise way, rather than just note a qualitative agreement?   It seems odd to me that this wasn't done. \n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "20 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Review of \"HUMAN PERCEPTION IN COMPUTER VISION\"", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper compares the performance, in terms of sensitivity to perturbations, of multilayer neural networks to human vision.  In many of the tasks tested, multilayer neural networks exhibit similar sensitivities as human vision.  \n\nFrom the tasks used in this paper one may conclude that multilayer neural networks capture many properties of the human visual system.  But of course there are well known adversarial examples in which small, perceptually invisible perturbations cause catastrophic errors in categorization, so against that backdrop it is difficult to know what to make of these results.  That the two systems exhibit similar phenomenologies in some cases could mean any number of things, and so it would have been nice to see a more in depth analysis of why this is happening in some cases and not others.  For example, for the noise perturbations described in the the first section, one sees already that conv2 is correlated with human sensitivity.  So why not examine how the first layer filters are being combined to produce this contextual effect?  From that we might actually learn something about neural mechanisms.\n\nAlthough I like and am sympathetic to the direction the author is taking here, I feel it just scratches the surface in terms of analyzing perceptual correlates in multilayer neural nets.  \n\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "18 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 3}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Updated Review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper reports several connections between the image representations in state-of-the are object recognition networks and findings from human visual psychophysics:\n1) It shows that the mean L1 distance in the feature space of certain CNN layers is predictive of human noise-detection thresholds in natural images.\n2) It reports that for 3 different 2-AFC tasks for which there exists a condition that is hard and one that is easy for humans, the mutual information between decision label and quantised CNN activations is usually higher in the condition that is easier for humans.\n3) It reproduces the general bandpass nature of contrast/frequency detection sensitivity in humans. \n\nWhile these findings appear interesting, they are also rather anecdotal and some of them seem to be rather trivial (e.g. findings in 2).
