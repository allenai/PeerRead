      "text" : "Face verification [12, 26, 27, 28, 30] and person reidentification [5,6,20,42] have been well studied and widely used in computer vision applications such as financial identity authentication and video surveillance. Both the two tasks need to measure the distance between two face or person images. Such tasks can be naturally formalized as a metric learning problem, where the distance of images from the same identity should be smaller than that from different\n1 https://github.com/sciencefans/Quality-Aware-Network Note that we are developing P-QAN (a fine-grained version of QAN, see Sec.5) in this repository. So the performance may be higher than that we report in this paper.\nidentities. Built on large scale training data, convolutional neural networks and carefully designed optimization criterion, current methods can achieve promising performance on standard benchmarks, but may still fail due to appearance variations caused by large pose or illumination.\nIn practical applications, instead of one single image, a set of images for each identity can always be collected. For example, the image set of one identity can be sampled from the trajectory of the face or person in videos. Images in a set can be complementary to each other, so that they provide more information than a single image, such as images from different poses. The direct way to aggregate identity infor-\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n03 37\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n1 A\npr 2\n01 7\nmation from all images in a set can be simply max/average pooling appearance features of all images. However, one problem in this pooling is that some images in the set may be not suitable for recognition. As shown in Figure 1, both sets from left-top and left-bottom hold noisy images caused by shake or blur. If the noisy images are treated equally and max/average pooling is used to aggregate all images’ features, the noisy images will mislead the final representation.\nIn this paper, in order to be robust to images with poor quality as described above and simultaneously use the rich information provided by the other images, our basic idea is that each image can have a quality score in aggregation. For that, we propose a quality aware network (QAN), which has two branches and then aggregated together. The first branch named feature generation part extracts the feature embedding for each image, and the other branch named quality generation part predicts quality score for each image. Features of images in the whole set are then aggregated by the final set pooling unit according to their quality.\nA good property of our approach is that we do not supervise the model by any explicit annotations of the quality. The network can automatically assign low quality scores to images with poor quality in order to keep the final feature embedding useful in set-to-set recognition. To implement that, an elaborate model is designed in which embedding branch and score generation branch can be jointly trained through optimization of the final embedding. Specially in this paper, we use the joint triplet and softmax loss on top of image sets. The designed gradient of image set pooling unit ensures the correctness of this automatic process.\nExperiments indicate that the predicted quality score is correlated with the quality annotated by human, and the predicted quality score performs better than human in recognition. In this paper, we show the applications of the proposed method on both person re-identification and face verification. For person re-identification task, the proposed quality aware network improves top-1 matching rates over the baseline by 14.6% on iLIDS-VID and 9.0% on PRID2011. For face verification, the proposed method reduces 15.6% and 29.32% miss ratio when the false positive rate is 0.001 on YouTube Face and IJB-A benchmarks.\nThe main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows.\n• The proposed quality aware network automatically generates quality scores for each image in a set and leads to better representation for set-to-set recognition.\n• We design an end-to-end training strategy and demonstrate that the quality generation part and feature generation part benefit from each other during back propagation.\n• Quality learnt by QAN is better than quality estimated\nby human and we achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks for person re-identification and face verification."

      "text" : "Our work is build upon recent advances in deep learning based person re-identification and unconstrained face recognition. In person re-identification, [20, 37, 41] use features generated by deep convolutional network and obtain state-of-the-art performance. To learn face representations in unconstrained face recognition, Huang et al. [11] uses convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine while deep convolutional neural network is used in [28, 30]. Furthermore, [26, 29] use deeper convolutional network and achieved accuracy that even surpasses human performance. The accuracy achieved by deep learning on image-based face verification benchmark LFW [12] has been promoted to 99.78%. Although deep neural network has achieved such great performance on these two problems, in present world, unconstrained set-to-set recognition is more challenging and useful.\nLooking backward, there are two different approaches handling set-to-set recognition. The first approach takes image set as a convex hull [2], affine hull [10] or subspace [1,13]. Under these settings, samples in a set distribute in a Hilbert space or Grassmann mainfold so that this issue can be formulated as a metric learning problem [23, 39].\nSome other works degrade set-to-set recognition to point-to-point recognition through aggregating images in a set to a single representation in hyperspace. The most famous approach in this kind is the Bag of features [17], which uses histogram to represent the whole set for feature aggregation. Another classical work is vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) [14], which aggregates all local descriptors from all samples. Temporal max/average pooling is used in [36] to integrate all frames’ features generated by recurrent convolutional network. This method uses the 1st order statistics to aggregate the set. The 2nd order statistics is used in [32, 43] in assuming that samples follow Gaussian distribution. In [8], original faces in a set are classified into 20 bins based on their pose and quality. Then faces in each bin are pooled to generate features and finally feature vectors in all bins are merged to be the final representation. [38] uses attention mechanism to summarize several sample points to a single aggregated point.\nThe proposed QAN belongs to the second approach. It discards the dross and selects the essential information in all images. Different from recent works which learn aggregation based on fixed feature [38] or image [8], the QAN learns feature representation and aggregation simultaneously. [7] proposed a similar quality aware module named “memorability based frame selection” which takes “visual entropy” to be the score of a frame. But the score of a frame\nis defined by human and independent with feature generation unit. In QAN, score is automatically learned and quality generation unit is joint trained with feature generation unit. Due to mutual benefit between the two parts during training, performance is improved significantly by jointly optimizing images aggregation parameter and images’ feature generator."

      "text" : "In our work we focus on improving image set embedding model, which maps an image set S = {I1, I2, · · · , IN} to an representation with fixed dimension so that image sets with different number of images are comparable with each other. Let Ra(S) and RIi denote representation of S and Ii. Ra(S) is determined by all elements in S, therefore it can be denoted as\nRa(S) = F(RI1 , RI2 , · · · , RIN ). (1)\nTheRIi is produced by a feature extraction process, containing traditional hand-craft feature extractors or convolutional neural network. F(·) is an aggregative function, which maps a variable-length input set to a representation of fixed dimension. The challenge is to find an optimized F(·), which aggregate features from the whole image set to obtain the most discriminative representation. Based on notion that images with higher quality are easier for recognition while images with lower quality containing occlusion and large pose have less effect on set representation, we denote F(·) as\nF(RI1 , RI2 , · · · , RIN ) = ∑N\ni=1 µiRIi∑N i=1 µi\n(2)\nµi = Q(Ii), (3)\nwhere Q(Ii) predicts a quality score µi for image Ii. So the representation of a set is a fusion of each images’ features, weighted by their quality scores."

Two branches are splited from the middle of it. In the first branch, quality generation part followed by a set pooling unit composes the aggregation module. And in the second branch, feature generation part generates images’ representation. Now we introduce how an image set flows through QAN. At the beginning of the process, all images are sent into a fully convolutional network to generate middle representations. After that, QAN is divided into two branches. The first one (upper) named quality generation part is a tiny convolution neural network (see Sec. 3.4 for details) which is employed to predict quality score µ. The second one (lower), called feature generation part, generates image representations RI for all images. µ and RI are aggregated at set pooling unit F , and then pass through a fully connected layer to get the final representation Ra(S). To sum up, this structure generates quality scores for images, uses these quality scores to weight images’ representations and sums them up to produce the final set’s representation."

      "text" : "We train the QAN in an end-to-end manner. The data flow is shown in Fig. 2. QAN is supposed to generate discriminative representations for images and sets belonging to different identities. For image level training, a fully connection layer is established after feature generation part, which is supervised by Softmax loss Lclass. For set level training, a set’s representation Ra(S) is supervised by Lveri which is formulated as:\nLveri = ‖Ra(Sa)−Ra(Sp)‖2− ‖Ra(Sa)−Ra(Sn)‖2 + δ (4)\nThe loss function above is referred as Triplet Loss in previous works [26]. We define Sa as anchor set, Sp as positive set, and Sn as negative set. This function minimizes variances of intra-class samples while Softmax loss cannot\nguarantee that because softmax-loss directly optimizes the probability of each class, but not the discrimination of representation.\nKeeping this in mind, we consider the set pooling operation F . The gradients back propagated through set pooling unit can be formulated as follows,\n∂F ∂RIi = ∂Ra(S) ∂RIi = µi (5)\n∂F ∂µi = ∂Ra(S) ∂µi = RIi −Ra(S) (6)\nSo we can formulate propagation process of the final loss as\n∂Lveri ∂RIi = ∂Ra(S) ∂RIi · ∂Lveri ∂Ra(S) = ∂Lveri ∂Ra(S) · µi (7)\n∂Lveri ∂µi = ∂Ra(S) ∂µi · ( ∂Lveri ∂Ra(S) )T\n= D∑ j=1 ( ∂Lveri ∂Ra(S)j · (xij −Ra(S)j)) (8)\nWhere D is the dimension of images’ representation. We discuss how a quality score µ is automatically learned by this back propagation process."

      "text" : "Automatic gradient of µ. After back-propagation through set pooling unit, gradient of µi with regard to Lveri\ncan be calculated according to the Eq. 8, which is the dot product of gradient from Ra(S) and RIi . So if angle of ∇Ra(S) and RIi belongs to (−90◦, 90◦), µi’s gradient will be positive. For example, as shown in Fig. 3, the angle of ∇Ra(Sneg) and xni−Ra(Sneg) is less than 90◦, so the x′nis quality score µni will become larger after this back propagation process. In contrast, the relative direction of xai is in the opposite side of the gradient of Ra(Sanchor), making it obviously a hard sample, so its quality score µai will tend to be smaller. Obviously, samples in the “correct” directions along with set gradient always score higher in quality, while those in the “wrong” directions gain lower weight. For example in Fig. 3, green samples in the upper area and red samples in the lower area keep improving their quality consistently while in the middle area, sample’s quality reduces. To this end, µi represents whether i − th image is a good sample or a hard sample. This conclusion will be further demonstrated by experiments. µ regulates the attention of RIi . The gradient of RIi is shown in Eq. 7 with a factor µi, together with the gradient propagated from Softmax loss. Since most of hard samples with lower µi are always poor images or even full of background noises, the factor µi in gradient of RIi weaken their harmful effect on the whole model. That is, their impact on parameters in feature generation part is negligible during back propagation. This mechanism helps feature generation part to focus on good samples and neglect ones, which benefits set-to-set recognition."

Instances of same person with different qualities are shown in the first two rows in Fig. 5. All images are selected from test set. The two images in the same column belong to a same person. The upper images are random selected from images with quality scores higher than 0.8 and the lower images are selected from images with quality scores lower than the corresponding higher one. It is easy to find that images with de-\nformity, superposition, blur or extreme light condition tend to obtain lower quality scores than normal images.\nThe last two rows in Fig. 5 give some examples of other images random selected from test set. They are sorted by their quality scores from left to right. We can observe that instances with quality scores larger than 0.70 are easy to recognize by human while the others are hard. Especially many of hard images include two or more bodies in the center and we can hardly discriminate which one is the right target.\nQuantitative analysis In order to measure the relationship between the quality labelled by human and µ predicted by QAN, 1000 images in YouTube Face are selected randomly and the quality of them are rated subjectively by 6 volunteers, where each volunteer estimates a quality score for each image, ranging from 0 to 1. All the ratings of each volunteer are aligned by logistic regression. Then the 6 aligned scores of each image are averaged and finally normalized to [0, 1] to get the final quality score from human.\nWe divide the images into ten partitions based on human’s score as shown in Fig. 6. In which we show the corresponding quality statistics generated by QAN. It is obvious that the scores given by the QAN are strongly correlated with human-defined quality.

    "abstractText" : "This paper targets on the problem of set to set recognition, which learns the metric between two image sets. Images in each set belong to the same identity. Since images in a set can be complementary, they hopefully lead to higher accuracy in practical applications. However, the quality of each sample cannot be guaranteed, and samples with poor quality will hurt the metric. In this paper, the quality aware network (QAN) is proposed to confront this problem, where the quality of each sample can be automatically learned although such information is not explicitly provided in the training stage. The network has two branches, where the first branch extracts appearance feature embedding for each sample and the other branch predicts quality score for each sample. Features and quality scores of all samples in a set are then aggregated to generate the final feature embedding. We show that the two branches can be trained in an end-to-end manner given only the set-level identity annotation. Analysis on gradient spread of this mechanism indicates that the quality learned by the network is beneficial to set-to-set recognition and simplifies the distribution that the network needs to fit. Experiments on both face verification and person re-identification show advantages of the proposed QAN. The source code and network structure can be downloaded at GitHub1",
