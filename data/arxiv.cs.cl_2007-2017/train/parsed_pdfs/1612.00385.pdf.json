      "text" : "Sequence classification is posed as a problem of assigning a label to a sequence of observations. Sequence classification models have extensive applications ranging from computer vision [17] to natural language processing [1]. Most existing sequence classification models are designed for well segmented sequences and do not explicitly model the fact that irrelevant (noisy) parts may be present in the sequence. To reduce the interference of these irrelevant parts, researchers will often manually pre-process the dataset to remove irrelevant subsequences. This manual pre-processing can be very time consuming and reduce applicability in real-world scenarios.\nA popular approach for sequence classification is gated recurrent networks like Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) [4] and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [11]. They employ gates (e.g., the input gate in the LSTM model) to balance\nbetween current and previous time steps when memorizing the temporal information flow. However, these vectorial gates are applied individually to each dimension of the information flow, thus it is hard to interpret the relative importance of the input time observations (i.e., time steps). What subset of sequential observations is the most salient for the classification task? Another way to balance the information flow, as we do in this work, is the adoption of attention-based mechanism, which applies individual attention scores to each observation (time step), allowing for better interpretability.\nIn this paper, we introduce the Temporal AttentionGated Model (TAGM) which extends the idea of attentionbased mechanism to sequence classification tasks (see overview in Figure 1). TAGM’s attention module automatically localizes the salient observations which are relevant to the final decision and ignore the irrelavant (noisy) parts of the input sequence. We created a new recurrent neural unit that can learn a better sequence hidden representation based on the attention scores. Consequently, TAGM’s classification decision is made based on the selected relevant segments, improving accuracy over the conventional models that take into account the whole input sequence.\nar X\niv :1\n61 2.\n00 38\n5v 2\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n5 A\npr 2\nNotably, compared to conventional sequence classification models, TAGM benefits from the following advantages:\n• It is able to automatically capture salient parts of the input sequences thereby leading to better performance. • The inferred attention (scalar) scores provide a mean-\ningful interpretation for the informativeness of each observation in the sequence. • Compared to conventional gated recurrent models such\nas LSTM, our model reduces the number of parameters which leads to faster training and inference and better generalizability with less training data. • The proposed model is able to generalize to tasks in\ncomputer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing."

      "text" : "While a full review of previous sequence classification models is beyond the scope of this paper, in this section we summarize approaches most relevant to our proposed approach, grouping them in three areas: sequence classification, attention models and recurrent networks. Sequence Classification. The conventional sequence classification models can be divided roughly into two categories: generative and discriminative models.\nThe first category focuses on learning an effective intermediate representation based on generative models. These methods are typically based on the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [31]. The HMM is a generative model which can be extended to class-conditional HMMs for sequence classification by combining class priors via Bayes’ rule. HMM can also be used as the base model for Fisher Kernel [14] to learn a sequence representation.\nThe second category is the discriminative graphical models which model the distribution over all class labels conditioned on the input data. Conditional random fields (CRF) [20] are discriminative models for sequence labeling which aims to assign one label for each sequence observation. A potential drawback of common CRFs is that the linear mapping between observations and labels cannot model complex decision boundaries, which gives rise to many non-linear CRF-variants (e.g., latent-dynamic CRFs [29], conditional neural fields [27], neural conditional random fields [5] and hidden-unit CRF model [39]). Hidden-state CRF (HCRF) [30] employs a chain of k-nomial latent variables to model the latent structure and has been successfully used in the sequence labeling. Similarly, hidden unit logistic model (HULM) [26] utilizes binary stochastic hidden units to represent the exponential hidden states so as to model more complex latent decision boundaries.\nAforementioned works are specifically designed for well segmented sequences and hence cannot cope well with noisy or unsegmented sequences. Attention Models. Inspired by the attention scheme of hu-\nman foveal vision, attention model was proposed to focus selectively on certain relevant parts of the input by measuring the sensitivity of output to variances of the input. Doing so can not only improve the performance of the model but can also result in better interpretability [41]. Attention models have been applied to image and video captioning [41, 3, 6, 42], machine translation [1, 22, 32], depthbased person identification [10] and speech recognition [8]. To the best of our knowledge, our TAGM is the first end-toend recurrent neural network to employ the attention mechanism in the temporal domain of sequences, with the added advantage of interpretability of its temporal salience indicators (i.e., temporal attention) at each time step (sequence observation). Our work is different from prior work focused on spatial domain (e.g., images) such as the model proposed by Sharma et al. [34]. Recurrent Networks. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) learn a representation for each time step by taking into account both the observation at current time step and the representation in the previous one [33]. The biggest advantage of recurrent neural networks lies in their capability of preserving information over time by the recurrent mechanism. Recurrent networks have been successfully applied to various tasks including language modeling [23], image generation [38] and online handwriting generation [7]. To address the gradient vanishing problem of plain-RNN when dealing with long sequences, LSTM [11] and GRU [4] were proposed. They are equipped with the gates to balance the information flow from the previous time step and current time step dynamically. Inspired by this setup, our TAGM model also employs a gate to filter out the noisy time steps and preserve the salient ones. The difference from the LSTM and GRU is that the gate value in our model is fed from the attention module which focuses on learning the salience at each time step."

To achieve these goals, we propose the Temporal Attention-Gated Model (TAGM) which consists of two modules: temporal attention module, and recurrent attention-gated units. Our TAGM model can be trained in an end-to-end manner efficiently. The graphical structure of the model is illustrated in Figure 2."

In order to inte-\ngrate the attention scores in the recurrent network units, we define an attention gate to control how much information is incorporated from the input of the current time step based on the salience and relevance to the final task.\nFormally, given an input sequence x1,...,T = {x1, . . . ,xT } of length T in which xt ∈ RD denotes the observation at the t-th time step, the attention score at time step t is denoted as at, which is a scalar value that indicates the salience of current time step to the final decision. For this purpose, we define our core recurring process where the hidden state ht at time step t is modeled as a convex summation:\nht = (1− at) · ht−1 + at · h′t (1)\nWherein, ht−1 is the previous hidden state and h′t is the candidate hidden state value which fully incorporates the input information xt in the current time step:\nh′t = g(W · ht−1 +U · xt + b) (2)\nHerein, W and U are respectively the linear transformation parameters for previous and current time steps while b is the bias term. We use the rectified linear unit (ReLU)[24] as the activation function g. Equation 1 uses attention score at to balance the information flow between current candidate hidden state h′t and previous hidden state ht−1. High attention value will push the model to focus more on the current hidden state h′t and input feature xt, while low attention value\nwould make the model ignore the current input feature and inherit more information from previous time steps.\nThe learned hidden representation at the last time step hT of the sequence is further fed into the final classifier, often a softmax function, to perform a classification task, which calculates the probability of a predicted label yk among K classes as:\nP (yk|hT ) = exp{W>k hT + bk}∑K i=1 exp{W>i hT + bi}\n(3)\nwhere W>i and bi refer to the parameters calculating the linear mapping score for the i-th class."

This saliency score should not only be based on the input observation at the current time step, but also take into consideration information from neighboring observations in both directions.

A sigmoid function is employed as the activation function σ at the top layer of the attention module in Equation 4 to constraint the attention weight to lie between [0, 1]. −→ h t and ←− h t are the hidden representations of a bi-directional RNN model: −→ h t = g( −→ Wxt + −→ U −→ h t−1 + −→ b ) (5)\n←− h t = g( ←− Wxt + ←− U ←− h t+1 + ←− b ) (6)\nThe ReLU functions are used as the activation functions g.

      "heading" : "3.4. Comparison with LSTM and GRU",
      "text" : "While our model is similar to RNN variants like GRU and LSTM, it is specifically designed with salience detection in mind and has four key differences when compared to them:\n• We only focus on one scalar attention score to measure the relevance of the current time step instead of generally modeling gate’s multi-dimensional values for each hidden unit as done by GRU and LSTM. In this way, we can obtain an interpretable salience detection (demonstrated on three tasks in Section 4). • We separate the attention modeling and recurrent hid-\nden representation learning as two independent modules to decrease the degree of coupling. One of the advantages of this is our ability to customize the specific recurrent structure for each module with different complexity according to the requirements (eg., different size of hidden units in two modules of TAGM in Table 1). • We employ a bi-directional RNN to take into account\nboth the preceding and the following information of the sequence in the temporal attention module. It helps to model the temporal smoothness of the sequence of salience scores (demonstrated in Figure 4). It should be noted that it is different from the design of the gates in the bi-directional LSTM model since the latter just concatenates the hidden representations of two unidirectional LSTMs, which does not remedy the downside that all vectorial gates are still calculated by considering only one-directional information. • Our model only contains one scalar gate, namely the\nattention gate, rather than 2 vectorial gates in GRU and 3 gates in LSTM. Doing so enforces the attention gate to take full responsibility of modeling all the salience information. In addition, the model contains fewer parameters (compared to LSTM) and simpler gate structure with less redundancy (compared to GRU and LSTM). It eases the training procedure and can alleviate the potential over-fitting and has better generalization given small amount of training data, which is demonstrated in Section 4.1.3."

Therefore, such methods cannot be easily applied on noisy sequences expected in real-world applications. In this paper, we present the Temporal Attention-Gated Model (TAGM) which integrates ideas from attention models and gated recurrent networks to better deal with noisy or unsegmented sequences. Specifically, we extend the concept of attention model to measure the relevance of each observation (time step) of a sequence. We then use a novel gated recurrent network to learn the hidden representation for the final prediction. An important advantage of our approach is interpretability since the temporal attention weights provide a meaningful value for the salience of each time step in the sequence. We demonstrate the merits of our TAGM approach, both for prediction accuracy and interpretability, on three different tasks: spoken digit recognition, text-based sentiment analysis and visual event recognition.",
