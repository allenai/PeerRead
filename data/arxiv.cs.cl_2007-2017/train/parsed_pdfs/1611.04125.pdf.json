      "text" : "People construct various large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to organize structural knowledge about the world, such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), DBPedia (Auer et al., 2007) and WordNet (Miller, 1995). A typical knowledge graph is a multiple-relational directed graph with nodes corresponding to entities, and edges corresponding to relations between these entities. Knowledge graphs are playing an important role in numerous applications such as question answering and Web search.\nThe facts in knowledge graphs are usually recorded as a set of relational triples (h, r, t) with h and t indicating head and tail entities and r the relation between h and t, e.g., (Mark Twain, PlaceOfBirth, Florida).\nTypical large-scale knowledge graphs are usually far from complete. The task of knowledge graph completion aims to enrich KGs with novel facts. Based on the network structure of KGs, many graphbased methods have been proposed to find novel facts between entities (Lao et al., 2011; Lao and Cohen, 2010). Many efforts are also devoted to extract relational facts from plain text (Zeng et al., 2014; dos Santos et al., 2015). However, these approaches cannot jointly take both KGs and plain texts into consideration.\nIn recent years, neural-based knowledge representation has been proposed to encode both entities and relations into a low-dimensional space, which are capable to find novel facts (Bordes et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014b; Lin et al., 2015). More importantly, neural models enable us to conduct joint rep-\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n04 12\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n3 N\nov 2\nresentation learning of text and knowledge within a unified semantic space, and perform knowledge graph completion more accurately.\nSome pioneering works have been done. For example, (Wang et al., 2014a) performs joint learning simply considering alignment between words and entities, and (Toutanova et al., 2015) extracts textual relations from plain texts using dependency parsing to enhance relation embeddings. These works either consider only partial information in plain text (entity mentions in (Wang et al., 2014a) and textual relations in (Toutanova et al., 2015)), or rely on complicated linguistic analysis (dependency parsing in (Toutanova et al., 2015)) which may bring inevitable parsing errors.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel framework for joint representation learning. As shown in Figure 1, the framework is expected to take full advantages of both text and KGs via complicated alignments with respect to words, entities and relations. Moreover, our method applies deep neural networks instead of linguistic analysis to encode the semantics of sentences, which is especially capable of modeling large-scale and noisy Web text.\nWe conduct experiments on a real-world dataset with KG extracted from Freebase and text derived from the New York Times corpus. We evaluate our method on the tasks including entity prediction, relation prediction with embeddings and relation classification from text. Experiment results demonstrate that, our method can effectively perform joint representation learning and obtain more informative knowledge representation, which significantly outperforms other baseline methods on all three tasks."

      "text" : "The work in this paper relates to representation learning of KGs, words and textual relations. Related works are reviewed as follows.\nRepresentation Learning of KGs. A variety of approaches have been proposed to encode both entities and relations into a continuous low-dimensional space. Inspired by (Mikolov et al., 2013b), TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) regards the relation r in each (h, r, t) as a translation from h to t within the lowdimensional space, i.e., h + r = t, where h and t are entity embeddings and r is relation embed-\nding. Despite of its simplicity, TransE achieves the state-of-the-art performance of representation learning for KGs, especially for those large-scale and sparse KGs. Hence, we simply incorporate TransE in our method to handle representation learning for KGs.\nNote that, our method is also flexible to incorporate extension models of TransE, such as TransH (Wang et al., 2014b) and TransR (Lin et al., 2015), which is not the focus of this paper and will be left as our future work.\nRepresentation Learning of Textual Relations. Many works aim to extract relational facts from large-scale text corpora (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010). This indicates textual relations between entities are contained in plain text. In recent years, deep neural models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proposed to encode semantics of sentences to identify relations between entities (Zeng et al., 2014; dos Santos et al., 2015). As compared to conventional models, neural models are capable to accurately capture textual relations between entities from text sequences without explicitly linguistic analysis, and further encode into continuous vector space. Hence, in this work we apply CNN to embed textual relations and conduct joint learning of text and KGs with respect to relations.\nMany neural models such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Zhang and Wang, 2015) and longshort term memory networks (LSTM) (Xu et al., 2015) have also been explored for relation extraction. These models can also be applied to perform representation learning for textual relations, which will be explored in future work.\nRepresentation Learning of Words. Given a text corpus, we can learn word representations without supervision. The learning objective is defined as the likelihood of predicting its context words of each word or vice versa (Mikolov et al., 2013b). Continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) (Mikolov et al., 2013a) and Skip-Gram (Mikolov et al., 2013c) are stateof-the-art methods for word representation learning. The learned word embeddings can capture both syntactic and semantic features of words derived from plain text. As reported in many previous works, deep neural network will benefit significantly if being initialized with pre-trained word embeddings (Erhan et al., 2010). In this work, we apply Skip-Gram for\nword representation learning, which serves as initialization for joint representation learning of text and KGs."

In the corpus D, each sentence is denoted as a word sequence s = {x1, . . . , xn}, xi ∈ V , and the length is n.\nFor entities, relations and words, we use the bold face to indicate their corresponding lowdimensional vectors. For example, the embeddings of h, t ∈ E, r ∈ R and x ∈ V are h, t, r,x ∈ Rk of k dimension, respectively."

      "heading" : "3.2 Joint Learning Method",
      "text" : "As mentioned in Section 2, representation learning methods have been proposed for knowledge graphs and text corpora respectively. In this work, we propose a joint learning framework for both KGs and text.\nIn this framework, we aim to learn representations of entities, relations and words jointly. Denote all these representations as model parameters θ = {θE , θR, θV }. The framework aims to find optimized parameters\nθ̂ = argminθLθ(G,D), (1)\nwhere Lθ(G,D) is the loss function defined over the knowledge graph G and the text corpus D. The loss function can be further decomposed as follows,\nLθ(G,D) = LθE ,θR(G) + τLθ(D) + λ‖θ‖2, (2)\nwhere τ and λ are harmonic factors, and ‖θ‖2 is the regularizer defined as L2 distance.\nLθE ,θR(G) is responsible to learn representations of both entities and relations from the knowledge graph G. This part will be introduced in detail in Section 3.3. Lθ(D) is responsible to learn representations of entities and relations as well as words from the text corpus T . It is straightforward to learn word representations from text as discussed in Section 2. On the contrary, since entities and relations are not explicitly shown in text, we have to identify entities and relations in text to support representation learning of entities and relations from text. The process is realized by entity-text alignment and relation-text alignment.\nEntity-Text Alignment. Many entities are mentioned in text. Due to the complex polysemy of entity mentions (e.g., an entity name Washington in a sentence could be indicating either a person or a location), it is non-trivial to build entity-text alignment. The alignment can be built via entity linking techniques or anchor text information. In this paper, we simply use the anchor text annotated in articles to build the alignment between entities in E and entity mentions in V . We will share the aligned entity representations to corresponding entity mentions.\nRelation-Text Alignment. As mentioned in Section 2, textual relations can be extracted from text. Hence, relation representation can also be learned from plain text. Inspired by the idea of distant supervision, for a relation r ∈ R, we collect all entity pairs Pr = {(h, t)} connected by r in KG. Afterwards, for each entity pair in Pr, we extract all sentences that contain the both entities from D, and regard them as the positive instances of the relation r. We can further apply deep neural networks to encode the semantic of these sentences into the corresponding relation representation. The process will be introduced in detail in Section 3.4.\nIn summary, the framework enables joint representation learning of both entities and relations by taking full advantages of both KG and text. The learned representations are expected to be more informative and robust, which will be verified in experiments."

(3)\nMeanwhile, each triple (h, r, t) ∈ T has an explicit relation r between h and t. Hence, we can define the scoring function for each triple as follows:\nfr(h, t) = ‖rht − r‖2 = ‖(t− h)− r‖2. (4)\nThis indicates that, for each triple (h, r, t) in T , we expect h + r ≈ t.\nBased on the above scoring function, we can formalize the loss function over all triples in T as follows: L(G) = ∑\n(h,r,t)∈T ∑ (h′,r′,t′)∈T ′ [ γ+fr(h, t)−fr′(h′, t′) ] + .\n(5) Here [x]+ indicates keeping the positive part of x and γ > 0 is a margin.

WPE is a position feature indicating the relative distances of the given word to the marked entities in the sentence. As shown in Figure 2, the relative distances of the word born to the entities Mark Twain and Florida are −2 and +2 respectively. We map each distance to a vector of dimension kp in the continuous latent space. Given the word xi in the sentence s, the word position embedding is pi = [phi ,p t i], where p h i and pti are vectors of distances to the head entity and tail entity respectively.\nWe simply concatenate textual word embeddings and word position embeddings to build the input for CNN:\ns = {[w1;p1], . . . , [wn;pn]}.

More specifically, we need to predict the tail entity when given a triple (h, r, ?) or predict the head entity when given a triple (?, r, t). In this task, for each missing entity, the system is asked to rank all candidate entities from the knowledge graph instead of only giving one best result. For each test triple (h, r, t), we replace head and tail entities with all entities in FB15K ranked in descending order of similarity scores calculated by ‖h+r−t‖2. The relational fact (h, r, t) is expected to have smaller score than any other corrupted triples.\nWe follow (Bordes et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014b; Lin et al., 2015) and use the proportion of correct entities in Top-10 ranked entities (Hits@10) as the evaluation metric. As mentioned in (Bordes et al., 2013), a corrupted triple may also exist in knowledge graphs, which should not be considered as incorrect. Hence, before ranking, we filter out those corrupted triples that have appeared in FB15K.\nThe relations in knowledge graphs can be divided into four classes: 1-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-toN relations, where a “1-to-N” relation indicates a head entity may correspond to multiple tail entities in knowledge graphs, and so on. For example, the relation (Country, PresidentOf, Person) is a typical “1-to-N” relation, because there used to be many presidents for a country in history. We report the average Hits@10 scores when predicting missing head entities and tail entities with respect to different classes of relations. We also report the overall performance by averaging the Hits@10 scores over triples and over relations.\nSince the evaluation setting is identical, we simply report the results of TransE, TransH and TransR from (Bordes et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014b; Lin et al., 2015), where “unif” and “bern” are two settings to sample negative instances for learning. We also report the results of TransE we implement for joint learning.\nThe evaluation results on entity prediction is shown in Table 2. From Table 2 we observe that:\n(1) The joint model almost achieves improvements under four classes of relations when predicting head and tail entities. This indicates the per-\nformance of joint learning is consistent and robust. Note that, our TransE version, which is implemented by ourselves, outperforms previous TransE, TransH and TranR, by simply increase the embedding dimension to k = 150, which suggests the effectiveness of TransE.\n(2) The improvements on “1-to-1”, “1-to-N” and “N-to-1” relations are much more significant as compared to those on “N-to-N”. This indicates that our joint model is more effective to embed textual relations for those deterministic relations.\n(3) Our joint model achieves improvement of more than 13% than TransE when averaging over relations. This indicates that, our joint model can take advantages of plain texts and greatly improve representation power in relation-level.\n(4) In FB15K, the relation numbers in different relation classes are comparable, but more than 80% triples are instances of “N-to-N” relations. Since the improvement of the joint model on “N-to-N” relations is not as remarkable as on other relation classes, hence the overall superiority of our joint model seems not so notable when averaging over triples as compared to averaging over relations."

In experiments, we evaluate the joint learning model on three tasks including entity prediction, relation prediction and relation classification from text. The experiment results show that our model can significantly and consistently improve the performance on the three tasks as compared with other baselines.",
