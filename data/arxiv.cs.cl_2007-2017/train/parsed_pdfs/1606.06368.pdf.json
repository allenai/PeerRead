      "text" : "If a user asks a system “How many painkillers should I take?”, it is better for the system to say “don’t know” rather than making a costly incorrect prediction. When the system is learned from data, uncertainty pervades, and we must manage this uncertainty properly to achieve our precision requirement. It is particularly challenging since training inputs might not be representative of test inputs due to limited data, covariate shift (Shimodaira, 2000), or adversarial filtering (Nelson et al., 2009; Mei and Zhu, 2015). In this unforgiving setting, can we still train a system that is guaranteed to either abstain or to make the correct prediction?\nOur present work is motivated by the goal of\nbuilding reliable question answering systems and natural language interfaces. Our goal is to learn a semantic mapping from examples of utterancelogical form pairs (Figure 1). More generally, we assume the input x is a bag (multiset) of source atoms (e.g., words {area, of,Ohio}), and the output y is a bag of target atoms (e.g., predicates {area,OH}). We consider learning mappings M that decompose according to the multiset sum: M(x) = ]s∈xM(s) (e.g., M({Ohio}) = {OH}, M({area,of,Ohio}) = {area,OH}). The main challenge is that an individual training example (x, y) does not tell us which source atoms map to which target atoms.1\nHow can a system be 100% sure about something if it has seen only a small number of possibly non-representative examples? Our approach is based on what we call the unanimity principle (Section 2.1). LetM be a model family that contains the true mapping from inputs to outputs. Let C be the subset of mappings that are consistent\n1A semantic parser further requires modeling the context dependence of words and the logical form structure joining the predicates. Our framework handles these cases with a different choice of source and target atoms (see Section 4.2).\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n06 36\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n3 Ju\nn 20\n16\nwith the training data. If all mappings M ∈ C unanimously predict the same output on a test input, then we return that output; else we return “don’t know” (see Figure 1). The unanimity principle provides robustness to the particular input distribution, so that we can tolerate even adversaries (Mei and Zhu, 2015), provided the training outputs are still mostly correct.\nTo operationalize the unanimity principle, we need to be able to efficiently reason about the predictions of all consistent mappings C. To this end, we represent a mapping as a matrixM , whereMst is number of times target atom t (e.g., OH) shows up for each occurrence of the source atom s (e.g., Ohio) in the input. We show that unanimous prediction can be performed by solving two integer linear programs. With a linear programming relaxation (Section 3), we further show that checking unanimity over C can be done very efficiently without any optimization but rather by checking the predictions of just two random mappings, while still guaranteeing 100% precision with probability 1 (Section 3.2).\nWe further relax the linear program to a linear system, which gives us a geometric view of the unanimity: We predict on a new input if it can be expressed as a “linear combination” of the training inputs. As an example, suppose we are given training data consisting of (CI) cities in Iowa, (CO) cities in Ohio, and (AI) area of Iowa (Figure 1). We can compute (AO) area of Ohio by analogy: (AO) = (CO) - (CI) + (AI). Other reasoning patterns fall out from more complex linear combinations.\nWe can handle noisy data (Section 3.4) by asking for unanimity over additional slack variables. We also show how the linear algebraic formulation enables other extensions such as learning from denotations (Section 5.1), active learning (Section 5.2), and paraphrasing (Section 5.3). We validate our methods in Section 4. On artificial data generated from an adversarial distribution with noise, we show that unanimous prediction obtains 100% precision, whereas point estimates fail. On GeoQuery (Zelle and Mooney, 1996), a standard semantic parsing dataset, where our model assumptions are violated, we still obtain 100% precision. We were able to reach 70% recall on recovering predicates and 59% on full logical forms."

In the simplest case, source atoms are words and target atoms are predicates—see Figure 2(top) for an example.2 We assume there is a true mapping M∗ from a source atom s (e.g., Ohio) to a bag of target atoms t = M∗(s) (e.g., {OH}). Note that M∗ can also map a source atom s to no target atoms (M∗(of) = {}) or multiple target atoms (M∗(grandparent) = {parent,parent}). We extend M∗ to bag of source atoms via multiset sum: M∗(x) = ]s∈xM∗(s).\nOf course, we do not know M∗ and must estimate it from training data. Our training examples are input-output pairs D = {(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)}. For now, we assume that there is no noise so that yi =M∗(xi); Section 3.4 shows how to deal with noise. Our goal is to output a mapping M̂ that maps each input x to either a bag of target atoms or “don’t know.” We say that M̂ has 100% precision if M̂(x) = M∗(x) whenever M̂(x) is not “don’t know.” The chief difficulty is that the source atoms xi and the target atoms yi are unaligned. While we could try to infer the alignment, we will show that it is unnecessary for obtaining 100% precision."

      "text" : "Finding an element of C as defined in (3) corresponds to solving an integer linear program (ILP), which is NP-hard in the worst case, though there exist relatively effective off-the-shelf solvers such as Gurobi. However, one solution is not enough. To check whether an input x is in the safe set F (2), we need to check whether all mappings M ∈ C predict the same output on x; that is, xM is the same for all M ∈ C.\nOur insight is that we can check whether x ∈ F by solving just two ILPs. Recall that we want to know if the output vector xM can be different for different M ∈ C. To do this, we pick a random vector v ∈ Rnt , and consider the scalar projection xMv. The first ILP maximizes this scalar and the second one minimizes it. If both ILPs return the same value, then with probability 1, we can conclude that xM is the same for all mappingsM ∈ C and thus x ∈ F . The following proposition formalizes this:\nProposition 2. Let x be any input. Let v ∼ N (0, Int×nt) be a random vector. Let a = minM∈C xMv and b = maxM∈C xMv. With probability 1, a = b iff x ∈ F .\nProof. If x ∈ F , there is only one output xM , so a = b. If x 6∈ F , there exists two M1,M2 ∈ C for which xM1 6= xM2. Then w def = x(M1 −\nM2) ∈ R1×nt is nonzero. The probability ofwv = 0 is zero because the space orthogonal to w is a (nt−1)-dimensional space while v is drawn from a nt-dimensional space. Therefore, with probability 1, xM1v 6= xM2v. Without loss of generality, a ≤ xM1v < xM2v ≤ b, so a 6= b."

      "text" : "Proposition 2 requires solving two non-trivial ILPs per input at test time. A natural step is to relax the integer constraint so that we solve two LPs instead.\nCLP def = {M ∈ Rns×nt≥0 | SM = T} (4)\nFLP def = {x : |{M(x) :M ∈ CLP}| = 1}. (5)\nThe set of consistent mappings is larger (CLP ⊇ C), so the set of safe inputs is smaller (FLP ⊆ F). Therefore, if we predict only on FLP, we still maintain 100% precision, although the recall could be lower.\nNow we will show how to exploit the convexity of CLP (unlike C) to avoid solving any LPs at test time at all. The basic idea is that if we choose two mappingsM1,M2 ∈ CLP “randomly enough”, whether xM1 = xM2 is equivalent to unanimity over CLP. We could try to sample M1,M2 uniformly from CLP, but this is costly. We instead show that “less random” choice suffices. This is formalized as follows:\nProposition 3. Let X be a finite set of test inputs. Let d be the dimension of CLP. LetM1 be any mapping in CLP, and let vec(M2) be sampled from a\nproper density over a d-dimensional ball lying in CLP centered at vec(M1). Then, with probability 1, for all x ∈ X , xM1 = xM2 implies x ∈ FLP.\nProof. We will prove the contrapositive. If x 6∈ FLP, then xM is not the same for all M ∈ CLP. Without loss of generality, assume not all M ∈ CLP agree on the i-th component of xM . Note that (xM)i = tr(Meix), which is the inner product of vec(M) and vec(eix). Since (xM)i is not the same for all M ∈ CLP and CLP is convex, the projection of CLP onto vec(eix) must be a one-dimensional polytope. For both vec(M1) and vec(M2) to have the same projection on vec(eix), they would have to both lie in a (d − 1)-dimensional polytope orthogonal to vec(eix). Since vec(M2) is sampled from a proper density over a d-dimensional ball, this has probability 0.\nAlgorithm. We now provide an algorithm to find two points p1, p2 inside a general ddimensional polytope P = {p : Ap ≤ b} satisfying the conditions of Proposition 3, where for clarity we have simplified the notation from vec(Mi) to pi and CLP to P .\nWe first find a point p1 in the relative interior of P , which consists of points for which the fewest number of inequalities j are active (i.e., ajp = bj). We can achieve this by solving the following LP from Freund et al. (1985):\nmax 1>ξ s.t. Ap+ ξ ≤ αb, 0 ≤ ξ ≤ 1, α ≥ 1. (6)\nHere, ξj is a lower bound on the slack of inequality j, and α scales up the polytope so that all the ξj that can be positive are exactly 1 in the optimum solution. Importantly, if ξj = 0, constraint j is always active for all solutions p ∈ P . Let (p∗, ξ∗, α∗) be an optimal solution to the LP. Then define A1 as the submatrix of A containing rows j for which ξ∗j = 1, and A0 consist of the remaining rows for which ξ∗j = 0.\nThe above LP gives us p1 = p∗/α∗, which lies in the relative interior of P (see Figure 4). To obtain p2, define a radius R def = (αmaxj:ξ∗j=1 ‖aj‖2) −1. Let the columns of matrix N form an orthonormal basis of the null space of A0. Sample v from a unit d-dimensional ball centered at 0, and set p2 = p1 +RNv.\nTo show that p2 ∈ P : First, p2 satisfies the always-active constraints j, a>j (p1 +RNv) = bj ,\nAlgorithm 1 Our linear programming approach. procedure TRAIN Input: Training examples Output: Generic mappings (M1,M2)\nDefine CLP as explained in (4).

For non-active j, the LP ensures that a>j p1 + α\n−1 ≤ bj , which implies a>j (p1 +RNv) ≤ bj .\nAlgorithm 1 summarizes our overall procedure: At training time, we solve a single LP (6) and draw a random vector to obtain M1,M2 satisfying Proposition 3. At test time, we simply apply M1 and M2, which scales only linearly with the number of source atoms in the input."

(8)\nNote that CLS is an affine subspace, so each M ∈ CLS can be expressed as M0 + BA, where M0 is an arbitrary solution,B is a basis for the null space of S and A is an arbitrary matrix. Figure 5 presents the linear system for four training examples. In the rare case that S has full column rank (if we have many training examples), then the left inverse of S exists, and there is exactly one consistent mapping, the true one (M∗ = S†T ), but we do not require this.\nLet’s try to explore the linear algebraic structure in the problem. Intuitively, if we know area of Ohio maps to area(OH) and Ohio maps to OH, then we should conclude area of maps to area by subtracting the second example from the first.

If x is in the row space of S, we can write x as a linear combination of S for some coefficients α ∈ Rn: x = α>S. Then for all M ∈ CLS, we have SM = T , so xM = α>SM = α>T , which is the unique output3 (See Figure 6). If x ∈ FLS is safe, then there exists a y such that for all M ∈ CLS, xM = y. Recall that each element of CLS can be decomposed into M0 +BA. For x(M0 +BA) to be the same for each A, x should be orthogonal to each column of B, a basis for the null space of S. This means that x is in the row space of S.\nIntuitively, this proposition says that stitching new inputs together by adding and subtracting existing training examples (rows of S) gives you exactly the relaxed safe set FLS.\nNote that relaxations increases the set of consistent mappings (CLS ⊇ CLP ⊇ C), which has the contravariant effect of shrinking the safe set (FLS ⊆ FLP ⊆ F).

Now assume that an adversary has made at most nmistakes additions to and deletions of target atoms across the examples in T , but of course we do not know which examples have been tainted. Can we still guarantee 100% precision?\nThe answer is yes for the ILP formulation: we simply replace the exact match condition (SM = T ) with a weaker one: ‖SM−T‖1 ≤ nmistakes (*). The result is still an ILP, so the techniques from Section 3.1 readily apply. Note that as nmistakes increases, the set of candidate mappings grows, which means that the safe set shrinks.\nUnfortunately, this procedure is degenerate for linear programs. If the constraint (*) is not tight, thenM+E also satisfies the constraint for any matrix E of small enough norm. This means that the consistent mappings CLP will be full-dimensional and certainly not be unanimous on any input.\nAnother strategy is to remove examples from the dataset if they could be potentially noisy. For each training example i, we run the ILP (*) on all but the i-th example. If the i-th example is not in the resulting safe set (2), we remove it. This procedure produces a noiseless dataset, on which we can apply the noiseless linear program or linear system from the previous sections."

We then created 120 training examples and 50 test examples, where the length of every input is between 5 and 10. The source atoms are divided into 10 clusters, and each input only contains source atoms from one cluster.\nFigure 7a shows the results for F (integer linear programming), FLP (linear programming), and\nFLS (linear system). All methods attain 100% precision, and as expected, relaxations lead to lower recall, though they all can reach 100% recall given enough data.\nComparison with point estimation. Recall that the unanimity principle M̂ reasons over the entire set of consistent mappings, which allows us to be robust to changes in the input distribution, e.g., from training set attacks (Mei and Zhu, 2015). As an alternative, consider computing the point estimateMp that minimizes ‖SM−T‖22 (the solution is given by Mp = S†T ). The point estimate, by minimizing the average loss, implicitly assumes i.i.d. examples. To generate output for input x we compute y = xMp and round each coordinate yt to the closest integer. To obtain a precision-recall tradeoff, we set a threshold and if for all target atoms t, the interval [yt− , yt+ ) contains an integer, we set yt to that integer; otherwise we report “don’t know” for input x.\nTo compare unanimous prediction M̂ and point estimation Mp, for each f ∈ {0.2, 0.5, 0.7}, we randomly generate 100 subsampled datasets consisting of an f fraction of the training examples. For Mp, we sweep across {0.0, 0.1, . . . , 0.5} to obtain a ROC curve. In Figure 7c(left/right), we select the distribution that results in the maximum/minimum difference between F1(M̂) and F1(Mp) respectively. As shown, M̂ has always 100% precision, while Mp can obtain less 100% precision over its full ROC curve. An adversary can only hurt the recall of unanimous prediction.\nNoise. As stated in Section 3.4, our algorithm has the ability to guarantee 100% precision even when the adversary can modify the outputs.

After replacing entity names by their types4 based on the standard entity lexicon, there are 172 different words and 57 different predicates in this dataset.\nHandling context. Some words are polysemous in that they map to two predicates: in “largest river” and “largest city”, the word largest maps to longest and biggest, respectively. Therefore, instead of using words as source atoms, we\n4If an entity name has more than one type we replace it by concatenating all of its possible types.\nuse bigrams, so that each source atom always maps to the same target atoms.\nReconstructing the logical form. We define target atoms to include more information than just the predicates, which enables us to reconstruct logical forms from the predicates. We use the variable-free functional logical forms (Kate et al., 2005), in which each target atom is a predicate conjoined with its argument order (e.g., loc 1 or loc 2). Table 1 shows two different choices of target atoms. At test time, we search over all possible “compatible” ways of combining target atoms into logical forms. If there is exactly one, then we return that logical form and abstain otherwise. We call a predicate combination “compatible” if it appears in the training set.\nWe put a “null” word at the end of each sentence, and collapsed the loc and traverse predicates. To deal with noise, we minimized ‖SM − T‖1 over real-valued mappings and removed any example (row) with non-zero residual. We perform all experiments using the linear system relaxation. Training takes under 30 seconds.\nFigure 8 shows precision and recall as a function of the number of the training examples. We obtain 70% recall over predicates on the test examples. 84% of these have a unique compatible way of combining target atoms into a logical form, which results in a 59% recall on logical forms.\nThough our modeling assumptions are incorrect for real data, we were still able to get 100% precision for all training examples. Interestingly, the linear system (which allows negative mappings) helps model GeoQuery dataset better than the linear program (which has a non-negativity constraint). There exists a predicate all:e in GeoQuery that is in every sentence unless the ut-\nterance contains a proper noun. With negative mappings, null maps to all:e, while each proper noun maps to its proper predicate minus all:e.\nThere is a lot of work in semantic parsing that tackles the GeoQuery dataset (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2007; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011), and the state-of-the-art is 91.1% precision and recall (Liang et al., 2011). However, none of these methods can guarantee 100% precision, and they perform more feature engineering, so these numbers are not quite comparable. In practice, one could use our unanimous prediction approach in conjunction with others: For example, one could run a classic semantic parser and simply certify 59% of the examples to be correct with our approach. In critical applications, one could use our approach as a first-pass filter, and fall back to humans for the abstentions."

This has motivated previous work to learn from question-answer pairs (e.g., area of Ohio to 44825) (Liang et al., 2011). This provides weaker supervision: For example, 44825 is the area of Ohio (in squared miles), but it is also the zip code of Chatfield. So, the true output could be either area(OH) or zipcode(Chatfield).\nIn this section, we show how to handle this form of weak supervision by asking for unanimity over additional selection variables. Formally, we have D = {(x1, Y1), . . . , (xn, Yn)} as a set of training examples, here each Yi consists of ki candidate outputs for xi.

Over the last decade, there has been much work on semantic parsing, mostly focusing on learning from weaker supervision (Liang et al., 2011; Goldwasser et al., 2011; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2011; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013), scaling up beyond small databases (Cai and Yates, 2013; Berant et al., 2013; Pasupat and Liang, 2015), and applying semantic parsing to other tasks (Matuszek et al., 2012; Kushman and Barzilay, 2013; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013). How-\never, only Popescu et al. (2003) focuses on precision. They also obtain 100% precision, but with a hand-crafted system, whereas we learn a semantic mapping.\nThe idea of computing consistent hypotheses appears in the classic theory of version spaces for binary classification (Mitchell, 1977) and has been extended to more structured settings (Vanlehn and Ball, 1987; Lau et al., 2000). Our version space is used in the context of the unanimity principle, and we explore a novel linear algebraic structure. Our “safe set” of inputs appears in the literature as the complement of the disagreement region (Hanneke, 2007). They use this notion for active learning, whereas we use it to support unanimous prediction.\nThere is classic work on learning classifiers that can abstain (Chow, 1970; Tortorella, 2000; Balsubramani, 2016). This work, however, focuses on the classification setting, whereas we considered more structured output settings (e.g., for semantic parsing). Another difference is that we operate in a more adversarial setting by leaning on the unanimity principle.\nAnother avenue for providing user confidence is probabilistic calibration (Platt, 1999), which has been explored more recently for structured prediction (Kuleshov and Liang, 2015). However, these methods do not guarantee precision for any training set and test input.\nIn summary, we have presented the unanimity principle for guaranteeing 100% precision. For the task of learning semantic mappings, we leveraged the linear algebraic structure in our problem to make unanimous prediction efficient. We view our work as a first step in learning reliable semantic parsers. A natural next step is to explore our framework with additional modeling improvements—especially in dealing with context, structure, and noise.\nReproducibility.

We answer the question in the affirmative provided our model family is wellspecified. Specifically, we introduce the unanimity principle: only predict when all models consistent with the training data predict the same output. We operationalize this principle for semantic parsing, the task of mapping utterances to logical forms. We develop a simple, efficient method that reasons over the infinite set of all consistent models by only checking two of the models. We prove that our method obtains 100% precision even with a modest amount of training data from a possibly adversarial distribution. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the standard GeoQuery dataset.",
