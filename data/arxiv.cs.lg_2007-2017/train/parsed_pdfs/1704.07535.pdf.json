We introduce abstract syntax networks, a modeling framework for these problems. The outputs are represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and constructed by a decoder with a dynamically-determined modular structure paralleling the structure of the output tree. On the benchmark HEARTHSTONE dataset for code generation, our model obtains 79.2 BLEU and 22.7% exact match accuracy, compared to previous state-ofthe-art values of 67.1 and 6.1%. Furthermore, we perform competitively on the ATIS, JOBS, and GEO semantic parsing datasets with no task-specific engineering."

      "text" : "Tasks like semantic parsing and code generation are challenging in part because they are structured (the output must be well-formed) but not synchronous (the output structure diverges from the input structure).\nSequence-to-sequence models have proven effective for both tasks (Dong and Lapata, 2016; Ling et al., 2016), using encoder-decoder frameworks to exploit the sequential structure on both the input and output side. Yet these approaches do not account for much richer structural constraints on outputs—including well-formedness, well-typedness, and executability. The wellformedness case is of particular interest, since it can readily be enforced by representing outputs as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) (Aho et al., 2006), an approach that can be seen as a much lighter weight\n∗Equal contribution.\nversion of CCG-based semantic parsing (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005).\nIn this work, we introduce abstract syntax networks (ASNs), an extension of the standard encoder-decoder framework utilizing a modular decoder whose submodels are composed to natively generate ASTs in a top-down manner. The decoding process for any given input follows a dy-\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n07 53\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n5 A\npr 2\n01 7\nnamically chosen mutual recursion between the modules, where the structure of the tree being produced mirrors the call graph of the recursion. We implement this process using a decoder model built of many submodels, each associated with a specific construct in the AST grammar and invoked when that construct is needed in the output tree. As is common with neural approaches to structured prediction (Chen and Manning, 2014; Vinyals et al., 2015), our decoder proceeds greedily and accesses not only a fixed encoding but also an attention-based representation of the input (Bahdanau et al., 2014).\nOur model significantly outperforms previous architectures for code generation and obtains competitive or state-of-the-art results on a suite of semantic parsing benchmarks. On the HEARTHSTONE dataset for code generation, we achieve a token BLEU score of 79.2 and an exact match accuracy of 22.7%, greatly improving over the previous best results of 67.1 BLEU and 6.1% exact match (Ling et al., 2016).\nThe flexibility of ASNs makes them readily applicable to other tasks with minimal adaptation. We illustrate this point with a suite of semantic parsing experiments. On the JOBS dataset, we improve on previous state-of-the-art, achieving 92.9% exact match accuracy as compared to the previous record of 90.7%. Likewise, we perform competitively on the ATIS and GEO datasets, matching or exceeding the exact match reported by Dong and Lapata (2016), though not quite reaching the records held by the best previous semantic parsing approaches (Wang et al., 2014)."

      "text" : "Encoder-decoder architectures, with and without attention, have been applied successfully both to sequence prediction tasks like machine translation and to tree prediction tasks like constituency parsing (Cross and Huang, 2016; Dyer et al., 2016; Vinyals et al., 2015). In the latter case, work has focused on making the task look like sequence-tosequence prediction, either by flattening the output tree (Vinyals et al., 2015) or by representing it as a sequence of construction decisions (Cross and Huang, 2016; Dyer et al., 2016). Our work differs from both in its use of a recursive top-down generation procedure.\nDong and Lapata (2016) introduced a sequenceto-sequence approach to semantic parsing, includ-\ning a limited form of top-down recursion, but without the modularity or tight coupling between output grammar and model characteristic of our approach.\nNeural (and probabilistic) modeling of code, including for prediction problems, has a longer history. Allamanis et al. (2015) and Maddison and Tarlow (2014) proposed modeling code with a neural language model, generating concrete syntax trees in left-first depth-first order, focusing on metrics like perplexity and applications like code snippet retrieval. More recently, Shin et al. (2017) attacked the same problem using a grammar-based variational autoencoder with top-down generation similar to ours instead. Meanwhile, a separate line of work has focused on the problem of program induction from input-output pairs (Balog et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2010; Menon et al., 2013).\nThe prediction framework most similar in spirit to ours is the doubly-recurrent decoder network introduced by Alvarez-Melis and Jaakkola (2017), which propagates information down the tree using a vertical LSTM and between siblings using a horizontal LSTM. Our model differs from theirs in using a separate module for each grammar construct and learning separate vertical updates for siblings when the AST labels require all siblings to be jointly present; we do, however, use a horizontal LSTM for nodes with variable numbers of children. The differences between our models reflect not only design decisions, but also differences in data—since ASTs have labeled nodes and labeled edges, they come with additional structure that our model exploits.\nApart from ours, the best results on the codegeneration task associated with the HEARTHSTONE dataset are based on a sequence-tosequence approach to the problem (Ling et al., 2016). Abstract syntax networks greatly improve on those results.\nPreviously, Andreas et al. (2016) introduced neural module networks (NMNs) for visual question answering, with modules corresponding to linguistic substructures within the input query. The primary purpose of the modules in NMNs is to compute deep features of images in the style of convolutional neural networks (CNN). These features are then fed into a final decision layer. In contrast to the modules we describe here, NMN modules do not make decisions about what to generate or which modules to call next, nor do they\nmaintain recurrent state."

      "text" : "Our model makes use of the Abstract Syntax Description Language (ASDL) framework (Wang et al., 1997), which represents code fragments as trees with typed nodes. Primitive types correspond to atomic values, like integers or identifiers. Accordingly, primitive nodes are annotated with a primitive type and a value of that type—for instance, in Figure 3a, the identifier node storing \"create minion\" represents a function of the same name.\nComposite types correspond to language constructs, like expressions or statements. Each type has a collection of constructors, each of which specifies the particular language construct a node of that type represents. Figure 4 shows constructors for the statement (stmt) and expression (expr) types. The associated language constructs include function and class definitions, return statements, binary operations, and function calls.\nComposite types enter syntax trees via composite nodes, annotated with a composite type and a choice of constructor specifying how the node expands. The root node in Figure 3a, for example, is\n1The full grammar can be found online on the documentation page for the Python ast module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast. html#abstract-grammar\na composite node of type stmt that represents a class definition and therefore uses the ClassDef constructor. In Figure 3b, on the other hand, the root uses the Call constructor because it represents a function call.\nChildren are specified by named and typed fields of the constructor, which have cardinalities of singular, optional, or sequential. By default, fields have singular cardinality, meaning they correspond to exactly one child. For instance, the ClassDef constructor has a singular name field of type identifier. Fields of optional cardinality are associ-\nated with zero or one children, while fields of sequential cardinality are associated with zero or more children—these are designated using ? and * suffixes in the grammar, respectively. Fields of sequential cardinality are often used to represent statement blocks, as in the body field of the ClassDef and FunctionDef constructors.\nThe grammars needed for semantic parsing can easily be given ASDL specifications as well, using primitive types to represent variables, predicates, and atoms and composite types for standard logical building blocks like lambdas and counting (among others). Figure 2 shows what the resulting λ-calculus trees look like. The ASDL grammars for both λ-calculus and Prolog-style logical forms are quite compact, as Figures 9 and 10 in the appendix show."

      "heading" : "3.2 Decoder Modules",
      "text" : "The decoder decomposes into several classes of modules, one per construct in the grammar, which we discuss in turn. Throughout, we let v denote the current vertical LSTM state, and use f to represent a generic feedforward neural network. LSTM updates with hidden state h and input x are notated as LSTM(h,x).\nComposite type modules Each composite type T has a corresponding module whose role is to select among the constructors C for that type. As Figure 5a exhibits, a composite type module receives a vertical LSTM state v as input and applies a feedforward network fT and a softmax output layer to choose a constructor:\np (C | T,v) = [ softmax (fT (v)) ] C .\nControl is then passed to the module associated with constructor C.\nConstructor modules Each constructor C has a corresponding module whose role is to compute an intermediate vertical LSTM state vu,F for each of its fields F whenever C is chosen at a composite node u.\nFor each field F of the constructor, an embedding eF is concatenated with an attention-based context vector c and fed through a feedforward neural network fC to obtain a context-dependent field embedding:\nẽF = fC (eF, c) .\nAn intermediate vertical state for the field F at composite node u is then computed as\nvu,F = LSTM v (vu, ẽF) .\nFigure 5b illustrates the process, starting with a single vertical LSTM state and ending with one updated state per field.\nConstructor field modules Each field F of a constructor has a corresponding module whose role is to determine the number of children associated with that field and to propagate an updated vertical LSTM state to them. In the case of fields with singular cardinality, the decision and update are both vacuous, as exactly one child is always generated. Hence these modules forward the field vertical LSTM state vu,F unchanged to the child w corresponding to F:\nvw = vu,F. (1)\nFields with optional cardinality can have either zero or one children; this choice is made using a feedforward network applied to the vertical LSTM state:\np(zF = 1 | vu,F) = sigmoid (fgenF (vu,F)) . (2)\nIf a child is to be generated, then as in (1), the state is propagated forward without modification.\nIn the case of sequential fields, a horizontal LSTM is employed for both child decisions and state updates. We refer to Figure 5c for an illustration of the recurrent process. After being initialized with a transformation of the vertical state, sF,0 = WFvu,F, the horizontal LSTM iteratively\ndecides whether to generate another child by applying a modified form of (2):\np (zF,i = 1 | sF,i−1, vu,F) = sigmoid (fgenF (sF,i−1, vu,F)) .\nIf zF,i = 0, generation stops and the process terminates, as represented by the solid black circle in Figure 5c. Otherwise, the process continues as represented by the white circle in Figure 5c. In that case, the horizontal state su,i−1 is combined with the vertical state vu,F and an attention-based context vector cF,i using a feedforward network fupdateF to obtain a joint context-dependent encoding of the field F and the position i:\nẽF,i = f update F (vu,F, su,i−1, cF,i).\nThe result is used to perform a vertical LSTM update for the corresponding child wi:\nvwi = LSTM v(vu,F, ẽF,i).\nFinally, the horizontal LSTM state is updated using the same field-position encoding, and the process continues:\nsu,i = LSTM h(su,i−1, ẽF,i).\nPrimitive type modules Each primitive type T has a corresponding module whose role is to select among the values y within the domain of that type. Figure 5d presents an example of the simplest form of this selection process, where the value y is obtained from a closed list via a softmax layer applied to an incoming vertical LSTM state:\np (y | T,v) = [ softmax (fT (v)) ] y .\nSome string-valued types are open class, however. To deal with these, we allow generation both from a closed list of previously seen values, as in Figure 5d, and synthesis of new values. Synthesis is delegated to a character-level LSTM language model (Bengio et al., 2003), and part of the role of the primitive module for open class types is to choose whether to synthesize a new value or not. During training, we allow the model to use the character LSTM only for unknown strings but include the log probability of that binary decision in the loss in order to ensure the model learns when to generate from the character LSTM."

At each step, the active decoder module either makes a generation decision, propagates state down the tree, or both.\nTo construct a composite node of a given type, the decoder calls the appropriate composite type module to obtain a constructor and its associated module. That module is then invoked to obtain updated vertical LSTM states for each of the constructor’s fields, and the corresponding constructor field modules are invoked to advance the process to those children.\nThis process continues downward, stopping at each primitive node, where a value is generated but no further recursion is carried out."

The attention weight vector a is then computed using a softmax:\na = softmax (q) .\nGiven the weights, the attention-based context is given by:\nc = ∑ t atet.\nCertain decision points that require attention have been highlighted in the description above; however, in our final implementation we made attention available to the decoder at all decision points.\nSupervised Attention In the datasets we consider, partial or total copying of input tokens into primitive nodes is quite common. Rather than providing an explicit copying mechanism (Ling et al., 2016), we instead generate alignments where possible to define a set of tokens on which the attention at a given primitive node should be concentrated.2 If no matches are found, the corresponding set of tokens is taken to be the whole input.\nThe attention supervision enters the loss through a term that encourages the final attention weights to be concentrated on the specified subset. Formally, if the matched subset of componenttoken pairs is S, the loss term associated with the supervision would be\nlog ∑ t exp (at)− log ∑ t∈S exp (at), (3)\n2Alignments are generated using an exact string match heuristic that also included some limited normalization, primarily splitting of special characters, undoing camel case, and lemmatization for the semantic parsing datasets.\nwhere at is the attention weight associated with token t, and the sum in the first term ranges over all tokens in the input.

However, these fall short of the previous best results of 91.3% and 90.4%, respectively, obtained by Wang et al. (2014).

      "text" : "As the examples in Figures 6-8 show, classes in the HEARTHSTONE dataset share a great deal of common structure. As a result, in the simplest cases, such as in Figure 6, generating the code is simply a matter of matching the overall structure and plugging in the correct values in the initializer and a few other places. In such cases, our system generally predicts the correct code, with the\nexception of instances in which strings are incorrectly transduced. Introducing a dedicated copying mechanism like the one used by Ling et al. (2016) or more specialized machinery for string transduction may alleviate this latter problem.\nThe next simplest category of card-code pairs consists of those in which the card’s logic is mostly implemented via nested function calls. Figure 7 illustrates a typical case, in which the card’s effect is triggered by a game event (a spell being cast) and both the trigger and the effect are described by arguments to an Effect constructor. Our system usually also performs well on instances like these, apart from idiosyncratic errors that can take the form of under- or overgeneration or simply substitution of incorrect predicates.\nCards whose code includes complex logic expressed in an imperative style, as in Figure 8, pose the greatest challenge for our system. Factors like variable naming, nontrivial control flow, and interleaving of code predictable from the description with code required due to the conventions of the library combine to make the code for these cards difficult to generate. In some instances (as in the figure), our system is nonetheless able to synthesize a close approximation. However, in the most complex cases, the predictions deviate significantly from the correct implementation.\nIn addition to the specific errors our system makes, some larger issues remain unresolved. Existing evaluation metrics only approximate the actual metric of interest: functional equivalence. Modifications of BLEU, tree F1, and exact\nmatch that canonicalize the code—for example, by anonymizing all variables—may prove more meaningful. Direct evaluation of functional equivalence is of course impossible in general (Sipser, 2006), and practically challenging even for the HEARTHSTONE dataset because it requires integrating with the game engine.\nExisting work also does not attempt to enforce semantic coherence in the output. Long-distance semantic dependencies, between occurrences of a single variable for example, in particular are not modeled. Nor is well-typedness or executability. Overcoming these evaluation and modeling issues remains an important open problem."
