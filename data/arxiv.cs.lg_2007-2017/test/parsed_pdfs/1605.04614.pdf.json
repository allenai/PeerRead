Based on XCode profiling we suspect that the Metal compute drivers for the GPU weren’t fine tuned, so with lower level tools (e.g. for OpenCL/Vulkan SPIR-V) for tuning for the GPU we could probably improve performance quite a bit.\n(Note that 100 milliseconds or in other words 0.1 seconds is what Jacob Nielsen stated is one of 3 important response times that a user feels a system reacts instantenously)"

The Swift API for setting up Metal resembles the corresponding OpenCL C API as shown in Figure 2.\nThe Deep Learning GPU code (e.g. shader functions with calculations of convolution etc) is written in Metal, a language that is a subset C++-11 and also has its own (relatively few) additions compared to C++11. Porting the Metal code GPU code to OpenCL should be relatively straight forward since OpenCL is also a subset of C++, as an example see figures 3 and 4 for a rectifier function written in both Metal and OpenCL. Going from OpenCL to Vulkan SPIR-V can be done with compiler (figure 5) for further profiling and optimization.\nThe threading model supported by Vulkan is 1-1 with what is developed in DeepLearningKit with Metal (figure 6), so that should not be an issue (The equivalent classes to what Vulkan has in the figure in Metal is from left to right MTLCommandBuffer, MTLCommandQueue and MTLDevice)"

[20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\n7. Look into teacher-student deep networks or other compressed models for even smaller but still high quality models (recent research have shown AlexNet models being compressed from 240MB to 6.9MB), see the paper [A Deep Neural Network Compression Pipeline]\n8. Look into algorithms for approximate matrix multiplication (i.e. convolution step speedup) to further increase speed (and reduce energy usage), interesting techniques include a) [Approximating matrix multiplication and low-rank approximation], [Fast Approximate Matrix Multiplication by Solving Linear Systems] and [Fast Monte-Carlo Algorithms for Approximate Matrix Multiplications].\n9. Look into a broad set of Deep Learning applications, e.g. categories in figures 7, 8 and 9 from DeepLearningKit’s research bibliography at [http://Deeplearning.University]. It might be application specific optimizations that can be done, e.g. in the case of natural language processing with convolutional neural networks one uses 1D convolution instead of 2D (as in image classification)."

      "heading" : "2 App Store for Deep Learning Models",
      "text" : "Given the immense asymmetry in time taken to train a Deep Learning Model versus time needed to use it (e.g. to do image recognition), it makes perfect sense to build a large repository of pre-trained models that can be (re)used several times. Since there are several popular tools used to train Deep Learning models (e.g. Caffe, Torch, Theano, DeepLearning4J, PyLearn and Nervana) were working on supporting importing pre-trained models in those tools into an app store for deep learning models (currently weve been primarily been working with Caffe CNN models).\nThe tweet in Figure 10 illustrates how much energy is required to train a Deep Network (per night), some Deep Learning Models can take weeks of training on GPUs like the Nvidia TitanX, or in other words piles of wood of energy. Using a model is quite different since it requires less energy than lighting match. See figures 11 and 12 for an illustration of this.\nDeep Learning Models also typically have a (low) limit in the number of classes they can predict per model (e.g. in the ImageNet competition there are 1000 classes, CIFAR-100 100 classes and CIFAR10 10 classes). This means that in order to create real-life applications one need to intelligently (and very rapid load them from SSD into GPU accessible RAM) switch between several Deep Learning Models, or if there is enough capacity one can run several models in parallel on the same GPU. Selecting an approriate Deep Learning model (i.e. which is the most likely to work well in a given context) is to our knowledge not a well-studied field of research, and in some ways it resembles the meta or universal search problem found in web search (e.g. cross-model ranking), but latency plays an even bigger part in the mobile on-device case (dont have time to run many models). We have some ideas for a meta model for selecting a model to use, which can use input like location, time of day, and camera history to predict which models might be most relevant.\nWith state-of-the-art compression techniques for Convolutional Neural Network the (groundbreaking) AlexNet model from 2012 can be compressed from 240MB to 6.9MB. This means that one could theoretically fit more than eighteen thousand AlexNet models on a 128 GB mobile device like the iPhone 6!"

      "text" : "Importing Deep Learning models into the model app store requires supporting the main Deep Learning tools. The most used ones in research are Torch and Caffe, and DeepLearningKit currently sup-\nports converting trained Caffe models to JSON (i.e. ready to be uploaded to app store) and then importing into Swift/Metal (or OpenCL/Vulkan with porting) for the mobile app. Making support for importing convolutional neural network from other tools might require getting intimate insight into the tools, but since convolutional neural networks are quite similar of nature the complexity and effort for creating importers is not horrific. Proposing and supporting standards - e.g. for\n1. deep learning network description (i.e input to training stage) 2. input data formats (images, text, etc input to training stage) 3. trained networks (i.e. input to DeepLearningKit deep learning)\nmight be a longer term goal since this will make it easier to use pretrained models with OpenCL/Vulkan no matter which tool they are created in."
