      "text" : "“When information is cheap, attention becomes expensive.” — James Gleick\nSatirical news is considered to be entertainment. However, it is not easy to recognize the satire if the satirical cues are too subtle to be unmasked and the reader lacks the contextual or cultural background. The example illustrated in Table 1 is a piece of satirical news with subtle satirical cues.\nAssuming readers interpret satirical news as true news, there is not much difference between satirical news and fake news in terms of the consequence, which may hurt the credibility of the media and the trust in the society. In fact, it is reported in the Guardian that people may believe satirical news and spread them to the public re-\ngardless of the ridiculous content1. It is also concluded that fake news is similar to satirical news via a thorough comparison among true news, fake news, and satirical news (Horne and Adali, 2017). This paper focuses on satirical news detection to ensure the trustworthiness of online news and prevent the spreading of potential misleading information.\nSome works tackling fake news and misleading information favor to discover the truth (Xiao et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2016) through knowledge base (Dong et al., 2015) and truthfulness estimation (Ge et al., 2013). These approaches may not be feasible for satirical news because there is no ground-truth in the stories. Another track of works analyze social network activities (Zhao et al., 2015) to evaluate the spreading information (Gupta et al., 2012; Castillo et al., 2011). This could be ineffective for both fake news and satirical news because once they are distributed on the social network, the damage has been done. Finally, works evaluating culture difference (PérezRosas and Mihalcea, 2014), psycholinguistic features (Ott et al., 2011), and writing styles (Feng et al., 2012) for deception detection are suitable for satirical news detection. These works consider features at document level, while we observe that satirical cues are usually located in certain para-\n1https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/nov/17/facebookfake-news-satire\nar X\niv :1\n70 9.\n01 18\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nS ep\n2 01\n7\ngraphs rather than the whole document. This indicates that many document level features may be superfluous and less effective.\nTo understand how paragraph-level features and document-level features are varied towards detection decision when only document level labels are available, we propose a 4-level neural network in a character-word-paragraph-document hierarchy and utilize attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014) to reveal their relative difference. We apply psycholinguistic features, writing stylistic features, structural features, and readability features to understand satire. The paragraph-level features are embedded into attention mechanism for selecting highly attended paragraphs, and the document-level features are incorporated for the final classification. This is the first work that unveils satirical cues between paragraph-level and document-level through neural networks to our knowledge.\nWe make the following contributions in our paper:\n• We propose a 4-level hierarchical network for satirical news detection. The model detects satirical news effectively and incorporates attention mechanism to reveal paragraph-level satirical cues.\n• We show that paragraph-level features are more important than document-level features in terms of the psycholinguistic feature, writing stylistic feature, and structural feature, while the readability feature is more important at the document level.\n• We collect satirical news (16,000+) and true news (160,000+) from various sources and conduct extensive experiments on this corpus2."

      "text" : "We categorize related works into four categories: content-based detection for news genre, truth verification and truthfulness evaluation, deception detection, and identification of highly attended component using attention mechanism.\nContent-based detection for news genre.Content-based methods are considerably effective to prevent satirical news from being recognized as true news and spreading through\n2https://github.com/fYYw/satire\nsocial media. Burfoot and Baldwin (2009) introduce headline features, profanity, and slang to embody satirical news. They consider absurdity as the major device in satirical news and model this feature by comparing entity combination in a given document with Google query results. Rubin et al. (2016) also consider absurdity but model it through unexpected new name entities. They introduce additional features including humor, grammar, negative affect, and punctuation to empower the detection. Besides satirical news, Chen et al. (2015) aim to detect click-baits, whose content exaggerates fact. Potthast et al. (2017) report a writing style analysis of hyperpartisan news. Barbieri et al. (2015) focus on multilingual tweets that advertise satirical news.\nIt is noteworthy that satirical news used for evaluation in above works are of limited quantity (around 200 articles). Diverse examples of satire may not be included as discussed by Rubin et al. (2016). This issue inspires us to collect more than 16,000 satirical news for our experiment.\nTruth discovery and truthfulness evaluation. Although truth extraction from inconsistent sources (Ge et al., 2013; Wan et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) and from conflicting sources (Yin et al., 2008; Li et al., 2014b), truth inference through knowledge base (Dong et al., 2015), and discovering evolving truth (Li et al., 2015) could help identify fact and detect fake news, they cannot favor much for satirical news as the story is entirely made up and the ground-truth is hardly found. Analyzing user activities (Farajtabar et al., 2017) and interactions (Castillo et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Weikum, 2015) to evaluate the credibility may not be appropriate for satirical news as it cannot prevent the spreading. Therefore, we utilize content-based features, including psycholinguistic features, writing stylistic features, structural features, and readability features, to address satirical news detection.\nDeception detection. We believe satirical news and opinion spam share similar characteristics of writing fictitious and deceptive content, which can be identified via a psycholinguistic consideration (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009; Ott et al., 2011). Beyond that, both syntactic stylometry (Feng et al., 2012) and behavioral features (Mukherjee et al., 2013b) are effective for detecting deceptive reviews, while stylistic features are practical to deal with obfuscating and imitat-\ning writings (Afroz et al., 2012). However, deceptive content varies among paragraphs in the same document, and so does satire. We focus on devising and evaluating paragraph-level features to reveal the satire in this work. We compare them with features at the document level, so we are able to tell what features are important at which level.\nIdentification of highly attended component using attention mechanism. Attention mechanism is widely applied in machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014), language inference (Rocktäschel et al., 2015), and question answering (Chen et al., 2016a). In addition, Yang et al. (2016b) propose hierarchical attention network to understand both attended words and sentences for sentiment classification. Chen et al. (2016b) enhance the attention with the support of user preference and product information to comprehend how user and product affect sentiment ratings. Due to the capability of attention mechanism, we employ the same strategy to show attended component for satirical news. Different from above works, we further evaluate linguistic features of highly attended paragraphs to analyze characteristics of satirical news, which has not been explored to our knowledge."

Assuming a sequence of paragraph representations have been constructed from lower levels, another Bi-GRU is used to encode these representations to a series of new states p1:t, so the sequential orders are considered.\nTo decide how paragraphs should be attended, we calculate satirical degree αi of paragraph i. We first convey pi into hidden states ui as in Equation 5. Then we product ui with a learnable satireaware vector va and feed the result into softmax function as in Equation 6. The final document representation d is computed as a weighted sum of αi and pi.\nui = tanh(Wapi + ba) (5) αi = exp(u>i v\na)∑t j=0 exp(u > j v a)) (6)\nd = t∑ i=0 αipi (7)\nLinguistic features are leveraged to support attending satire paragraph.

      "heading" : "3.2 Linguistic Features",
      "text" : "Linguistic features have been successfully applied to expose differences between deceptive and genuine content, so we subsume most of the features in previous works. The idea of explaining fictitious content is extended here to reveal how satirical news differs from true news. We divide our linguistic features into four families and compute them separately for paragraph and document.\nPsycholinguistic Features: Psychological differences are useful for our problem, because professional journalists tend to express opinion conservatively to avoid unnecessary arguments. On the contrary, satirical news includes aggressive language for the entertainment purpose. We additionally observe true news favors clarity and accuracy while satirical news is related to emotional cognition. To capture the above observations, we employ Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2007) as our psycholinguistic dictionary. Each category of LIWC is one independent feature and valued by its frequency3.\nWriting Stylistic Features: The relative distribution of part-of-speech (POS) tags reflects informative vs. imaginative writing, which contributes to detecting deceptions (Li et al., 2014a; Mukherjee et al., 2013a). We argue that the stories covered by satirical news are based on imagination. In addition, POS tags are hints of the underlying\n3Total counts divided by total words.\nhumor (Reyes et al., 2012), which is common in satirical news. So we utilize POS tags (Toutanova et al., 2003) to apprehend satire. Each tag is regarded as one independent feature and valued by its frequency.\nReadability Features: We consider readability of genuine news would differ from satirical news because the former is written by professional journalists and tend to be clearer and more accurate, while satirical news packs numerous clauses to enrich the made-up story as introduced by Rubin et al. (2016). Different from their work, we use readability metrics, including Flesch Reading Ease (Kincaid et al., 1975), Gunning Fog Index (Gunning, 1952), Automated Readability Index (Senter and Smith, 1967), ColemanLiau Index (Coleman and Liau, 1975), and syllable count per word, as features.\nStructural Features: To further reflect the structure of news articles, we examine the following features: word count, log word count, number of punctuations, number of digits, number of capital letters, and number of sentences."

True news may use other evidence to support the credibility, which explains “twitter”, “com”, “video”, and “pictured”. High weight of “ : ” indicates that true news uses colon to list items for clarity. High weight of “ '' ” indicates that satirical news involves more conversation, which is consistent with our observation. The final interesting note is satirical news favors “washington dc”.

Alternatively, we define the importance of linguistic features by summing the absolute value of the weights if directly connected to the feature. For example, the importance I of feature k is given by Ik = 1 M ∑M m=0 |wk,m|, where w ∈ RK×M is the directly connected weight, K is the number of features, and M is the dimension of the output.

      "heading" : "4.5.2 Comparing Individual Features",
      "text" : "Within each set, we rank features based on the importance score and report their mean and standard deviation before being scaled in Table 6. At paragraph level, we use top three attended paragraphs for calculating. The respective p-values of all features in the table are less than 0.01 based on the t-test, indicating satirical news is statistically significantly different from true news.\nComparing Table 6 and Table 3, we find that the word count, capital letters, and punctuations in true news are larger than in satirical news at the document level, while at paragraph level these\nfeatures in true news are less than in satirical news. This indicates satire paragraph could be more complex locally. It also could be referred as “sentence complexity”, that “satirical articles tend to pack a great number of clauses into a sentence for comedic effect” (Rubin et al., 2016). Accordingly, we hypothesize top complex paragraphs could represent the entire satire document for classification, which we leave for future examination.\nIn Table 6, psycholinguistic feature “Humans” is more related to emotional writing than control writing (Pennebaker et al., 2007), which indicates satirical news is emotional and unprofessional compared to true news. The same reason also applies to “Social” and “Leisure”, where the former implies emotional and the latter implies control writing. The “Past” and “VBN” both have higher frequencies in true news, which can be explained by the fact that true news covers what happened. A similar reason that true news reports what happened to others explains a low “Self” and a high “VBZ” in true news.\nFor writing stylistic features, it is suggested that informative writing has more nouns, adjectives, prepositions and coordinating conjunctions, while imaginative writing has more verbs, adverbs, pronouns, and pre-determiners (Rayson et al., 2001). This explains higher frequencies of “RB” and “PRP” in satirical news, and higher frequency of “NN” and “CC” in true news. One exception is “JJ”, adjectives, which receives the highest weight in this feature set and indicates a higher frequency\nin satirical news. We suspect adjective could also be related to emotional writing, but more experiments are required.\nReadability suggests satirical news is easier to be understood. Considering satirical news is also deceptive (as the story is not true), this is consistent with works (Frank et al., 2008; Afroz et al., 2012) showing deceptive writings are more easily comprehended than genuine writings. Finally, true news has more digits and a higher “CD”(Cardinal number) frequency, even at the paragraph level, because they tend to be clear and accurate."

In addition, although satirical news is shorter than true news at the document level, we find satirical news generally contain paragraphs which are more complex than true news at the paragraph level. The analysis of individual features reveals that the writing of satirical news tends to be emotional and imaginative.\nWe will investigate efforts to model satire at the paragraph level following our conclusion and theoretical backgrounds, such as (Ermida, 2012). We plan to go beyond the binary classification and explore satire degree estimation. We will generalize our approach to reveal characteristics of figurative language (Joshi et al., 2016), where different paragraphs or sentences may reflect different degrees of sarcasm, irony, and humor."
