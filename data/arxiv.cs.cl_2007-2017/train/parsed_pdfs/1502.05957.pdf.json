For sets of search terms the NWD gives a similarity on a scale from 0 (identical) to 1 (completely different). The NWD approximates the similarity according to all (upper semi)computable properties. We develop the theory and give applications. The derivation of the NWD method is based on Kolmogorov complexity.\nIndex Terms— Normalized web distance, pattern recognition, data mining, similarity, classification,\nKolmogorov complexity,\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCommonly objects are computer files that carry all their properties in themselves. However, there are also objects that are given by name, such as ‘red,’ ‘three,’ ‘Einstein,’ or ‘chair.’ Such objects acquire their meaning from the common knowledge of mankind. We can give objects either as the object itself or as the name of that object, such as the literal text of the work “Macbeth by Shakespeare” or the name “Macbeth by Shakespeare.” We focus on the name case using the background information provided by the World Wide Web, or another data base such as Wikipedia, and a search engine that produces reliable aggregate page counts. The frequencies involved enable us to compute a distance for each set of names. The normalized form of this distance expresses similarity, that is, the search engine discovers the “meaning” names have in common. Insofar as the meaning of names on the data base as discovered by this process approximates the meaning of those names in human society, the above distance expresses the\nAndrew Cohen is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Drexel University.

The term “name” is used here synonymously with “word” “search term” or “query.” The normalized distance above is called the normalized web distance (NWD). We apply it in classification.\nExample I.1. Although Google gives notoriously unreliable counts it serves well enough for an example. On our scale of similarity, if NWD(X) = 0 then the search terms in the set X are identical, and if NWD(X) = 1 then the search terms in X are as different as can be. On 19 August 2014 searching for “Shakespeare” gave 124,000,000 hits; searching for “Macbeth” gave 22,400,000 hits; searching for “Hamlet” gave 51,300,000 hits; searching for “Shakespeare Macbeth” gave 7,730,000 hits; searching for “Shakespeare Hamlet” gave 18,500,000 hits; and searching for “Shakespeare Macbeth Hamlet” gave 663,000 hits. The number of web pages returned by Google was estimated by searching for “the” as 25,270,000,000. By (II.3) we have NWD({Shakespeare,Macbeth}) ≈ 0.395, NWD({Shakespeare,Hamlet}) ≈ 0.306 and NWD({Shakespeare,Macbeth,Hamlet}) ≈ 0.372. We conclude that Shakespeare and Hamlet have a lot in common, Shakespeare and Macbeth have a lot in common, and the commonality of Shakespeare, Hamlet, and Macbeth is intermediate between the two. ♦\nTo develop the theory behind the NWD we consider the information in individual objects. These objects are finite and expressed as finite binary strings. The classic notion of Kolmogorov complexity [8] is an objective measure for the information in a single object, and information distance measures the information between a pair of objects [1]. There arises the question of the shared information between many objects instead of just a pair of objects."

      "text" : "The similarity or relative semantics between pairs of search terms was defined in [5] and demonstrated in practice by using the World Wide Web as database and Google as search engine. The proposed normalized Google distance (NGD) works for any search engine that gives an aggregate page count for search terms. See for example [2], [7], [21], [20], [3] and the many references to [5] in Google scholar.\nIn [11] the notion is introduced of the information required to go from any object in a finite multiset (a set where a member can occur more than once) of objects to any other object in the set. Let X denote a finite multiset of n finite binary strings defined by {x1, . . . , xn}, the constituting\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n3 elements ordered length-increasing lexicographic. The information distance in X is defined by Emax(X) = min{|p| : U(xi, p, j) = xj for all xi, xj ∈ X}. For instance, with X = {x, y} the quantity Emax(X) is the least number of bits in a program to transform x to y and y to x. In [18] the mathematical theory is developed further and the difficulty of normalization is shown."

      "text" : "The NWD is a similarity (a common semantics) between all search terms in a set. (We use set rather than multiset since a set is more appropriate in the context of search terms.) It can be thought of as a diameter of the set. For sets of cardinality two this diameter reduces to a distance between the two elements of the set. The NWD can be used for the classification of an unseen item into one of several classes (sets of names or phrases). This is simpler and computationally much easier that constructing the classes from the pairwise distances. In the latter solution inevitably information gets lost.\nThe basic concepts like the web events, web distribution, and web code are given in Section II. We determine the length of a single shortest binary program to compute from any web event of a single member in a set to the web event associated with the whole set (Theorem II.5). The mentioned length is an absolute information distance associated with the set. It is incomputable (Lemma II.4). However, for different sets it can be large while a set has similar members and small when a (different) set has dissimilar members. Therefore we normalize on a scale from 0 to 1 to express the information distance or similarity between members of the set. We approximate the incomputable normalized version with the computable NWD (Definition II.6). In Section III we present properties of the NWD such as the range from 0 to 1 (Lemma III.1), whether and how it changes under adding members (Lemma III.2), and that it does not satisfy the triangle inequality and hence is not metric (Lemma III.5). Theorem III.7 and Corollary III.8 show that the NWD approximates the common similarity of the queries in a set of search terms (that is, a common semantics). We subsequently apply the NWD to various data sets based on search results from Amazon, Wikipedia and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website from the U.S. National Institutes of Health in Section IV. We treat strings and self-delimiting strings in Appendix A, computability notions in Appendix B, Kolmogorov complexity in Appendix C, and metric of sets in Appendix D. The proofs are deferred to Appendix E.\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n4"

Consider the set\nTw,s = {(w, s) : w ∈ Ω, s ∈ S, s occurs in w}.\nThen α = ∑\nw∈Ω, s∈S |Tw,s|/|Ω| is the average number of search terms per web page in Ω. Define\nthe probability g(X) of X as g(X) = f(X)/N with N = α|Ω|. This probability may change over time, but let us imagine that the probability holds in the sense of an instantaneous snapshot.\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n5 A probability mass function on a known set allows us to define the associated prefix-code word length (information content) equal to unique decodable code word length [9], [13]. Such a prefix code is a code such that no code word is a proper prefix of any other code word. By the ubiquitous Kraft inequality [9], if l1, l2, . . . is a sequence of positive integers satisfying∑ i 2−li ≤ 1, (II.1)\nthen there is a set of prefix-code words of length l1, l2, . . . . Conversely, if there is a set of prefix-code words of length l1, l2, . . . then these lengths satisfy the above displayed equation. By the fact that the probabilities of a discrete set sum to at most 1, every web event e(X) having probability g(X) can be encoded in a prefix-code word.\nDefinition II.2. The length G(X) of the web code word for X ∈ X is\nG(X) = log 1/g(X), (II.2)\nor ∞ for g(X) = 0. The case |X| = 1 gives the length of the web code word for singleton search terms. The logarithms are throughout base 2.\nThe web code is a prefix code. The code word associated with X and therefore with the web event e(X) can be viewed as a compressed version of the set of web pages constituting e(X). That is, the search engine compresses the set of web pages that contain all elements from X into a code word of length G(X).\nDefinition II.3. Let p ∈ {0, 1}∗ and X ∈ X \\ S. The information EGmax(X) to compute event e(X) from event e(x) for any x ∈ X is defined by EGmax(X) = minp{|p| : for all x ∈ X we have U(e(x), p) = e(X)}.\nIn this way EGmax(X) corresponds to the length of a single shortest self-delimiting program to compute output e(X) from an input e(x) for all x ∈ X . We use the notion of prefix Kolmogorov complexity K as in Appendix C.\nLemma II.4. The function EGmax is upper semicomputable but not computable.\nTheorem II.5. EGmax(X) = maxx∈X{K(e(X)|e(x))} up to an additive logarithmic term\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n6 O(log maxx∈X{K(e(X)|e(x))}) which we ignore in the sequel.\nTo obtain the NWD we must normalize EGmax. Let us give some intuition first. Suppose X, Y ∈ X \\S. If the web events e(x)’s are more or less the same for all x ∈ X then we consider the members of X very similar to each other. If the web events e(y)’s are very different for different y ∈ Y then we consider the members of Y to be very different from one another. Yet for certain X and Y depending on the cardinalities and the size of the web events of the members we can have EGmax(X) = EGmax(Y ). That is to say, the similarity is dependent on size. Therefore, to express similarity of the elements in a set X we need to normalize EGmax(X) using the cardinality of X and the events of its members. Expressing the normalized values on a scale of 0 to 1 allows us to express the degree in which all elements of a set are alike. Then we can compare truly different sets.\nUse the symmetry of information law (A.1) to rewrite EGmax(X) according to Theorem II.5 as K(e(X)) − minx∈X{K(e(x))} up to a logarithmic additive term which we ignore. Since G(X) is computable prefix code for e(X), while K(e(X)) is the shortest computable prefix code for e(X), it follows that K(e(X)) ≤ G(X). Similarly K(e(x)) ≤ G(x) for x ∈ X . The search engine G returns frequency f(X) on query X (respectively frequency f(x) on query x). These frequencies are readily converted into G(X) (respectively G(x)) using (II.2). Replace K(e(X)) by G(X) and minx∈X{K(e(x))} by minx∈X{G(x)} in EGmax(X). Subsequently use as normalizing term maxx∈X{G(x)}(|X| − 1). This yields the following.\nDefinition II.6. The normalized web distance (NWD) of X ∈ X with G(X) <∞ (equivalently f(X) > 0)) is\nNWD(X) = G(X)−minx∈X{G(x)} maxx∈X{G(x)}(|X| − 1)\n(II.3)\n= maxx∈X{log f(x)} − log f(X)\n(logN −minx∈X{log f(x)})(|X| − 1) ,\notherwise NWD(X) is undefined.\nThe second equality in (II.3), expressing the NWD in terms of frequencies, is seen as follows. We use (II.2). The numerator is rewritten by G(X) = log 1/g(X) = log(N/f(X)) = logN − log f(X) and minx∈X{G(x)} = minx∈X{log 1/g(x)} = logN − maxx∈X{log f(x)}.\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n7 The denominator is rewritten as maxx∈X{G(x)}(|X| − 1) = maxx∈X{log 1/g(x)}(|X| − 1) = (logN −minx∈X{log f(x)})(|X| − 1).\nRemark II.7. By assumption f(X) > 0 which, since it has integer values, means f(X) ≥ 1. The case f(X) = 0 means that there is an x ∈ X such that e(x) ⋂ e(X \\ {x}) = ∅. That is, query x is independent of the set of queries X \\ {x}, that is, x has nothing in common with X \\ {x} since there is no common web page. Hence the NWD is undefined. The other extreme is that e(x) = e(y) (x ∼ y) for all x, y ∈ X . In this case the NWD(X) = 0. ♦"

Then NWD(X) ∈ [0, 1].\nWe determine bounds on how the NWD may change under addition of members to its argument. These bounds are necessary loose since the added members may be similar to existing ones or very different. In Lemma III.2 below we shall distinguish two cases for the relation between the minimum frequencies of members of X and Y with X ⊂ Y and the overall frequencies of X and Y . In the first case\nf(y1)f(X) f(x1)f(Y ) ≥ ( f(x0) f(y0) )(|X|−1)NWD(X) , (III.1)\nwhere x0 = arg minx∈X{log f(x)}, y0 = arg miny∈Y {log f(y)}, x1 = arg maxx∈X{log f(x)}, and y1 = arg maxy∈Y {log f(y)}.\nWe give an example.

Consider the Shakespeare–Macbeth–Hamlet Example I.1. Let X = {Shakespeare,Macbeth}, Y = {Shakespeare,Macbeth,Hamlet}, and Z = {Shakespeare,Hamlet}. Then inequality (III.1) for X versus Y gives (124, 000, 000× 7, 730, 000/(124, 000, 000× 663, 000) ≥ (22, 400, 000/22, 400, 000)0.395 (that is 11.659 ≥ 1), and for Z versus Y gives 18, 500, 000/663, 000 ≥ (51, 300, 000/22, 400, 000)0.306 (that is 27.903 ≥ 1.289). In the first case Lemma III.2 item (i) is applicable since the frequency minima of X and Y are the same. (In this case inequality (III.1) is not needed.) Therefore NWD(X)(|X| − 1)/(|Y | − 1) ≤ NWD(Y ) which works out as 0.395/2 ≤ 0.372. In the second case Lemma III.2 item (ii) is applicable since the frequency minima of Z and Y are not the same. Since inequality (III.1) holds this gives NWD(Z)(|Z| − 1)/(|Y | − 1) ≤ NWD(Y ) which works out as 0.306/2 ≤ 0.372. ♦\nRemark III.4. To interpret Lemma III.2 we give the following intuition. Under addition of a member to a set there are two opposing tendencies on the NWD concerned. First, the range of the NWD stays fixed at a unit and (II.3) shows that addition of a member tends to decrease the NWD, that is, it moves closer to 0. Second, the common similarity of queries in a given set as measured by the NWD is based on the number of properties all members of a set have in common. By adding a member to the set clearly the number of common properties does not increase and generally decreases. This diminishing tends to cause the NWD to increase—move closer to 1. The first effect is visible when (|X| − 1)NWD(X) > (|Y | − 1)NWD(Y ), which happens in the case of Lemma III.2 item (ii) for the case when the frequencies do not satisfy (A.2). The second effect is visible when (|X| − 1)NWD(X) ≤ (|Y | − 1)NWD(Y ), which happens in Lemma III.2 item (i), and item (ii) with the frequencies satisfying (A.2). (Note that to keep NWD(X) ∈ [0, 1] for all X we have the factor (|X| − 1) in the denominator of NWD(X). Without this factor the resulting function of X has range [0, |X| − 1] and in the inequalities in this remark and in the NWD formula (II.3) and all the previous theory properties\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n9 the factors |X| − 1 and |Y | − 1 are replaced by 1.) ♦\nFor every set X we have that the NWD(X) is invariant under permutation of X: it is symmetric. The NWD is also positive definite as in Appendix D (where equal members should be interpreted as saying that the set has only one member). However the NWD does not satisfy the triangle inequality and hence is not a metric. This is natural for a common similarity or semantics: The members of a set XY can be less similar (have greater NWD) then the similarity of the members of XZ plus the similarity of the members of ZY for some set Z.\nLemma III.5. The NWD violates the triangle inequality.\nIt remains to formally prove that the NWD expresses in the similarity of the search terms in the set. We define the notion of a distance on these sets using the web as side-information. We consider only distances that are upper semicomputable, that is, the distance can be computably approximated from above (Appendix B). A priori we allow asymmetric distances, but we exclude degenerate distances such as d(X) = 1/2 for all X ∈ X containing a fixed element x. That is, for every d we want only finitely many sets X 3 x such that d(X) ≤ d. Exactly how fast we want the number of sets we admit to go to ∞ is not important; it is only a matter of scaling.\nDefinition III.6. A web distance function (quantifying the common properties or common features) d : X → R+ is admissible if d(X) is (i) a nonnegative total real function and is 0 iff X ∈ S; (ii) it is upper semicomputable from the e(x)’s with x ∈ X and e(X); and (iii) it satisfies the density requirement: for every x ∈ S∑ X3x, |X|≥2 2−d(X) ≤ 1.\nWe give the gist of what we are about to prove. Let X = {x1, x2, . . . , xn}. A feature of a query is a property of the web event of that query. For example, the frequency in the web event of web pages containing an occurrence of the word “red.” We can compute this frequency for each e(xi) (1 ≤ i ≤ n). The minimum of those frequencies is the maximum of the number of web pages containing the word “red” which surely is contained in each web event e(x1), . . . , e(xn). One can identify this maximum with the inverse of a distance in X . There are many such distances in X . The shorter a web distance is, the more dominant is the feature it represents. We show\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n10\nthat the minimum admissible distance is EGmax(X). It is the least admissible web distance and represents the shortest of all admissible web distances in members of X . Hence the closer the numerator of NWD(X) is to EGmax(X) the better it represents the dominant feature all members of X have in common.\nTheorem III.7. Let X ∈ X . The function G(X)−minx∈X{G(x)} is a computable upper bound on EGmax(X). The closer it is to EGmax(X), the better it approximates the shortest admissible distance in X . The normalized form of EGmax(X) is NWD(X).\nThe normalized least admissible distance in a set is the least admissible distance between its\nmembers which we call the common admissible similarity. Therefore we have:\nCorollary III.8. The function NWD(X) is the common admissible similarity among all search terms in X . This admissible similarity can be viewed as semantics that all search terms in X have in common."

      "heading" : "IV. APPLICATIONS",
      "text" : "The application of the approach presented here requires the ability to query a database for the number of occurrences and co-occurrences of the elements in the set that we wish to analyze. One challenge is to find a database that has sufficient breadth as to contain a meaningful numbers of co-occurrences for related terms. As discussed previously, an example of one such database is the World Wide Web, with the page counts returned by Google search queries used as an estimate of co-occurrence frequency. There are two issues with using Google search page counts. The first issue is that Google limits the number of programmatic searches in a single day to a maximum of 100 queries, and charges for queries in excess of 100 at a rate of up to $50 per thousand. The second issue with using Google web search page counts is that the numbers are not exact, but are generated using an approximate algorithm that Google has not disclosed. For the questions considered previously [5] we found that these approximate measures were sufficient at that time to generate useful answers, especially in the absence of any a priori domain knowledge. It is possible to implement internet based searches without using search engine API’s, and therefore not subject to daily limit. This can be accomplished by parsing the HTML returned by the search engine directly. The issue with google page counts in this study being approximate counts based\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n11\non a non-public algorithm was more concerning as changes in the approximation algorithm can influence page count results in a way that may not reflect true changes to the underlying distributions. Since any internet search that returns a results count can be used in computing the NWD, we adopt the approach of using web sites that return exact rather than approximate page counts for a given query.\nHere we describe a comparison of the NWD using the set formulation based on web-site search result counts with the pairwise NWD formulation. The examples are based on search results from Amazon, Wikipedia and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The NCBI website exposes all of the NIH databases searchable from a single web portal. We consider example classification questions that involve partitioning a set of words into underlying categories. For the NCBI applications we compare various diseases using the loci identified by large genome wide association studies (GWAS). For the NWD set classification, we determine whether to assign element x to class A or class B by computing NWD(Ax)−NWD(A) and NWD(Bx)−NWD(B) and assigning element x to whichever class achieves the minimum.\nFor the pairwise formulation, we use the gap spectral clustering unsupervised approach developed in [4]. Gap spectral clustering uses the gap statistic as first proposed in [17] to estimate the number of clusters in a data set from an arbitrary clustering algorithm. In [4], it was shown that the gap statistic in conjunction with a spectral clustering [15] of the distance matrix obtained from pairwise NWD measurements is an estimate of randomness deficiency for clustering models. Randomness deficiency is a measure of the meaningful information that a model, here a clustering algorithm, captures in a particular set of data [12]. The approach is to select the number of clusters that minimizes the randomness deficiency as approximated by the gap value. In practice, this is achieved by picking the first number of clusters where the gap value achieves a maximum as described in [4].\nThe gap value is computed by comparing the intra-cluster dispersions of the pairwise NWD distance matrix to that of uniformly distributed randomly generated data on the same range. For each value of k, the number of clusters in the data, we apply a spectral clustering algorithm to partition the data, assigning each element in the data to one of k clusters. Next, we compute\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n12\nDr, the sum of the distances between elements in each cluster Cr,\nDr = ∑ i,j∈Cr di,j.\nThe average intra-cluster dispersion is calculated,\nWk = k∑\nr=1\n1\n2nr Dr,\nwhere nr is the number of points in cluster Cr. The gap statistic is then computed as the difference between the averages of the intra-cluster distances of our data and the intra-cluster distances of B randomly generated uniformly distributed data sets of the same dimension as our data,\nGap(k) = 1\nB B∑ b=1 log(Wkb)− log(Wk),\nwhere Wkb is the average intra-cluster dispersion obtained by running our clustering algorithm on each of the B randomly generated uniformly-distributed datasets. Following [4] we set B to 100. We compute the standard deviation of the gap value sk from σk, the standard deviation of the B uniformly distributed randomly generated data, adjusted to account for simulation error, as\nsk = σk √ 1 + 1/B.\nFinally, we choose the smallest value of k for which\nGap(k) ≥ Gap(k + 1)− sk+1.\nWe now describe results from a number of sample applications. For all of these applications, we use a single implementation based on co-occurrence counts. For each search engine that we used, including Amazon, Wikipedia and NCBI a custom MATLAB script was developed to parse the search count results. We used the page counts returned using the built in search from each website for the frequencies, and following the approach in [5] choose N as the frequency for the search term ’the’. The results described were not sensitive to the choice of search term used to establish N , for example identical classification results were obtained using the counts returned by the search term ’N’ as the normalizing factor. Following each classification result below, we\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n13\ninclude in parenthesis the 95% confidence interval for the result, computed as described in [19]\nThe first three classification questions we considered used the wikipedia search engine.

For colors vs animals and shapes, gap spectral clustering found two groups in the data and classified all of the elements 100% correctly. The NWD set formulation classified the terms perfectly (0.82,1.0). For the presidential candidate classification by party, the pairwise NWD formulation performed poorly, classifying 58% correctly (0.32,0.8), while the multiset formulation obtained 100% correct classification (0.76,1.0). Table I shows the data used for each question, together with the pairwise and set accuracy, the number of groups obtained by gap spectral clustering and the total number of website queries required for each method.\nThe next classification question considered used page counts returned by the Amazon website search engine to classify book titles by author. Table II summarizes the sets of novels associated with each author, and the classification results for each author as a confusion matrix. The Multiset NWD (top) misclassified one of the Tolstoy novels (’War and Peace’) to Stephen King, but\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n14\nShakespeare = {Macbeth, The Tempest, Othello, King Lear, Hamlet, The Merchant of Venice, A Midsummer Nights Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Taming of the Shrew, Twelfth Night} King = {Carrie, Salems Lot, The Shining, The Stand, The Dead Zone, Firestarter, Cujo} Twain = {Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court, Life on the Mississippi, Puddnhead Wilson} Hemingway = {The Old Man and The Sea, The Sun Also Rises, For Whom the Bell Tolls, A Farewell To Arms} Tolstoy = {Anna Karenina, War and Peace, The Death of Ivan Ilyich}\ncorrectly classified all other novels correctly, 96% accurate (0.83,0.99). The pairwise NWD performed significantly more poorly, achieving only 79% accuracy (0.6,0.9).\nThe final application considered is to quantify similarities among diseases based on the results of genome wide association studies (GWAS). These studies scan the genomes from a large population of individuals to identify genetic variations occurring at fixed locations, or loci that can be associated with the given disease. Here we use the the NIH NCBI database to search for similarities among diseases, comparing loci identified by recent GWAS results for each disease. The diseases included Alzheimers [22], Parkinsons [27], Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [23], Schizophrenia [28], Leukemia [24], Obesity [26], and Neuroblastoma [25]. The top of Table III lists the loci used for each disease. The middle panel of Table III shows at each\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n15\nlocation (i, j) of the distance matrix the NWD computed for the combined counts for the loci of disease i concatenated with disease j. The diagonal elements (i, i) show the NWD for the loci of disease i. The bottom panel of Table III shows the NWD for each element with the diagonal subtracted, (i, j) − (i, i). This is equivalent to the NWD(Ax) − NWD(A) value used in the previous classification problems. The two minimum values in the bottom panel, showing the relationships between Parkinsons and Obesity, as well as between Schizophrenia and Leukemia were surprising. The hypothesis was that neurological disorders such as Parkinsons, ALS and Alzheimers, would be more similar to each other. After these findings we found that there actually have been recent findings of strong relationships between both Schizophrenia and Leukemia [29] as well as between Parkinsons and Obesity [30], relationships that have also been identified by clinical evidence not relating to GWAS approaches.\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT"

      "text" : "Consider queries to a search engine using a data base divided in chunks called web pages. On each query the search engine returns a set of web pages. We propose a method, the normalized web distance (NWD) for sets of queries that quantifies in a single number between 0 and 1 the way in which the queries in the set are similar: 0 means all queries in the set are the same (the set has cardinality one) and 1 means all queries in the set are maximally dissimilar to each other.\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n17\nThe similarity among queries uses the frequency counts of web pages returned for each query and the set of queries. The method can be applied using any big data base and a search engine that returns reliable aggregate page counts. Since this method uses names for object, and not the objects themselves, we can view the common similarity of the names as a common semantics between those names (words or phrases). The common similarity between a finite nonempty set of queries can be viewed as a distance or diameter of this set. We show that this distance ranges in between 0 and 1, how it changes under adding members to the set, that it does not satisfy the triangle property, and that the NWD formally and provably expresses common similarity (common semantics).\nTo test the efficacy of the new method for classification we experimented with small data sets of queries based on search results from Wikipedia, Amazon, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. In particular we compared classification using pairwise NWDs with classification using set NWD. The last mentioned performed consistently equal or better, sometimes much better.\nAPPENDIX"

The length of a string x (the number of bits in it) is denoted by |x|. Thus, | | = 0. The self-delimiting code for x of length n is x̄ = 1|x|0x of length 2n+ 1, or even shorter x′ = 1x̄0x of length n+ 2 log n+ 1 (see [12] for still shorter self-delimiting codes). Self-delimiting code words encode where they end. The advantage is that if many strings of varying lengths are encoded self-delimitingly using the same code, then their concatenation can be parsed in their constituent code words in one pass going from left to right. Self delimiting codes are computable prefix codes. A prefix code has the property that no code word is a proper prefix of any other code word. The code-word set is called prefix-free.\nWe identify strings with natural numbers by associating each string with its index in the length-increasing lexicographic ordering according to the scheme ( , 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (00, 3), (01, 4), (10, 5), (11, 6), . . . .

      "heading" : "C. Kolmogorov Complexity",
      "text" : "The Kolmogorov complexity is the information in a single finite object [8]. Informally, the Kolmogorov complexity of a finite binary string is the length of the shortest string from which the original can be lossless reconstructed by an effective general-purpose computer such as a particular universal Turing machine. Hence it constitutes a lower bound on how far a lossless compression program can compress. For technical reasons we choose Turing machines with a separate read-only input tape that is scanned from left to right without backing up, a separate work tape on which the computation takes place, an auxiliary tape inscribed with the auxiliary information, and a separate output tape. All tapes are divided into squares and are semi-infinite. Initially, the input tape contains a semi-infinite binary string with one bit per square starting at the leftmost square, and all heads scan the leftmost squares on their tapes. Upon halting, the initial segment p of the input that has been scanned is called the input program and the contents of the output tape is called the output. By construction, the set of halting programs is prefix free (Appendix A), and this type of Turing machine is called a prefix Turing machine. A standard enumeration of prefix Turing machines T1, T2, . . . contains a universal machine U such that U(i, p, y) = Ti(p, y) for all indexes i, programs p, and auxiliary strings y. (Such universal machines are called “optimal” in contrast with universal machines like U ′ with U ′(i, pp, y) = Ti(p, y) for all i, p, y, and U ′(i, q, y) = 1 for q 6= pp for some p.) We call U the reference universal prefix Turing machine. This leads to the definition of prefix Kolmogorov complexity.\nFormally, the conditional prefix Kolmogorov complexity K(x|y) is the length of the shortest input z such that the reference universal prefix Turing machine U on input z with auxiliary information y outputs x.

In these definitions both x and y can consist of strings into which finite sets of finite binary strings are encoded. Theory and applications are given in the textbook [12].\nFor a finite set of strings we assume that the strings are length-increasing lexicographic ordered. This allows us to assign a unique Kolmogorov complexity to a set. The conditional prefix Kolmogorov complexity K(X|x) of a set X given an element x is the length of a shortest program p for the reference universal Turing machine that with input x outputs the set X . The prefix Kolmogorov complexity K(X) of a set X is defined by K(X| ). One can also put set in the conditional such as K(x|X) or K(X|Y ). We will use the straightforward laws K(·|X, x) = K(·|X) and K(X|x) = K(X ′|x) up to an additive constant term, for x ∈ X and X ′ equals the set X with the element x deleted.\nWe use the following notions from the theory of Kolmogorov complexity.

Therefore EGmax(X) is upper semicomputable. It is not computable since for X = {x, y} we have EGmax(X) = max{K(e(x)|e(y)), K(e(y)|e(x))}+O(1), the information distance between e(x) and e(y) which is known to be incomputable [1].\nProof: of Theorem II.5.\n(≤) We use a modification of the proof of [11, Theorem 2]. According to Definition II.1 x = y iff e(x) = e(y). Let X = {x1, . . . , xn} and k = maxx∈X{K(e(X)|e(x)}. A set of cardinality n in S is for the purposes of this proof represented by an n-vector of which the entries consist of the lexicographic length-increasing sorted members of the set. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n let Yi be the set of computably enumerated n-vectors Y = (y1, . . . , yn) with entries in S such that\nK(e(Y )|e(yi)) ≤ k for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Define the set V = ⋃n i=1 Yi. This V is the set of vertices of a graph G = (V,E). The set of edges E is defined by: two vertices u = (u1, . . . , un) and v = (v1, . . . , vn) are connected by an edge iff there is 1 ≤ j ≤ n such that uj = vj . There are at most 2k self-delimiting programs of length at most k computing from input e(uj) to different e(v)’s with uj in vertex v as jth entry. Hence there can be at most 2k vertices v with uj as jth entry. Therefore, for every u ∈ V and 1 ≤ j ≤ n there are at most 2k vertices v ∈ V such that vj = uj . The vertex-degree of graph G is therefore bounded by n2k. Each graph can be vertex-colored by a number of colors equal to the maximal vertex-degree. This divides the set of\nvertices V into disjoint color classes V = V1 ⋃ · · · ⋃ VD with D ≤ n2k. To compute e(X) from e(x) with x ∈ X we only need the color class of which e(X) is a member and the position of x in n-vector X . Namely, by construction every vertex with the same element in the jth position is connected by an edge. Therefore there is at most a single vertex with x in the jth position in a color class. Let x be the jth entry of n-vector X . It suffices to have a program of length at most log(n2k) +O(log nk) = k +O(log nk) bits to compute e(X) from e(x). From n and k we can generate G and given log(n2k) bits we can identify the color class Vd of e(X). Using another log n bits we define the position of x in the n-vector X . To make such a program self-delimiting add a logarithmic term. In total k +O(log k) suffices since O(log k) = O(log n+ log nk).\n(≥) That EGmax(X) ≥ maxx∈X{K(e(X)|e(x)} follows trivially from the definitions.\nProof: of Lemma III.1.\n(≥ 0) Since f(X) ≤ f(x) for all x ∈ X the numerator of the right-hand side of (II.3) is\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n21\nnonnegative. Since the denominator is also nonnegative we have NWD(X) ≥ 0. Example of the lower bound: if maxx∈X{log f(x)} = log f(X), then NWD(X) = 0.\n(≤ 1) Intuitively the upper bound on g(X) is reached if the web events e(x) for x ∈ X are mutually almost disjoint. We say ”almost” since if ⋂\nx∈X e(x) = ∅ then NWD(X) is undefined. Case 1 Let the web events e(x) satisfy | ⋂ x∈X e(x)| = 1. Then g(X) = ∏ x∈X(g(x)−1/N) +\n1/N . By (II.2) therefore ∑\nx∈X G(x)−G(X) = for some very small positive .\nSubcase 1.a Let |e(x)| = |e(y)| for all x, y ∈ X . Then G(X) − minx∈X{G(x)} = (X − 1) maxx∈X{G(x)} − . By (II.3) we have NWD(X) = 1 − ′ where ′ = /((X − 1) maxx∈X{G(x)}).\nSubcase 1.b Let |e(x)| 6= |e(y)| for some x, y ∈ X . Then G(X) − minx∈X{G(x)} < (X −\n1) maxx∈X{G(x)}. By (II.3) we have NWD(X) < 1− ′. Case 2 Let the web events e(x) satisfy | ⋂ x∈X e(x)| > 1. Then g(X) > ∏ x∈X(g(x) −\n1/N) + 1/N yielding ∑\nx∈X G(x)−G(X) < and therefore G(X)−minx∈X{G(x)} < (X −\n1) maxx∈X{G(x)}. By (II.3) we have NWD(X) < 1− ′.\nProof: of Lemma III.2.\n(i) Since X ⊆ Y and because of the condition of item (i) we have miny∈Y {log f(y)} = minx∈X{log f(x)}. From X ⊆ Y also follows maxy∈Y {log f(y)} ≥ maxx∈X{log f(x)}, and log f(X) ≥ log f(Y ). Therefore the numerator of NWD(Y ) is at least as great as that of NWD(X), and the denominator of NWD(Y ) equals (|Y |−1)/(|X|−1) times the denominator of NWD(X).\n(ii) We have minx∈Y log f(y) < minx∈X{log f(x)}. If NWD(X) = 1 then NWD(Y ) = 1 (in both cases there is no common similarity of the members of the set). Item (ii) follows vacuously in this case. Therefore assume that NWD(X) < 1. Write NWD(X) = a/b with a equal to the numerator of NWD(X) and b equal to the denominator. If c, d are real numbers satisfying c/d ≥ a/b then bc ≥ ad. Therefore ab + bc ≥ ab + ad which rearranged yields (a+ c)/(b+ d) ≥ a/b. If c/d < a/b then by similar reasoning (a+ c)/(b+ d) < a/b.\nAssume (III.1) holds. We take the logarithms of both sides of (III.1) and rearrange it to obtain log f(X)−maxx∈X{log f(x)} − log f(Y ) + maxy∈Y {log f(y)} ≥ (minx∈X{log f(x)} − miny∈Y {log f(y)})(|X| − 1)NWD(X). Let the lefthand side of the inequality be c and the\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n22\nrighthand side of the inequality be dNWD(X). Then\nNWD(X) = maxx∈X{log f(x)} − log f(X)\n(logN −minx∈X{log f(x)})(|X| − 1) (A.2)\n≤ maxy∈Y {log f(y)} − log f(Y ) (logN −miny∈Y {log f(y)})(|X| − 1) = |Y | − 1 |X| − 1 NWD(Y ).\nThe inequality holds by the rewritten (III.1) and the a, b, c, d argument above since c/d ≥ NWD(X) = a/b.\nAssume (III.1) does not hold, that is, it holds with the ≥ sign replaced by a < sign. We take logarithms of both sides of this last version and rewrite it to obtain log f(X)−maxx∈X{log f(x)}− log f(Y ) + maxy∈Y {log f(y)} < (minx∈X{log f(x)} −miny∈Y {log f(y)})(|X| − 1)NWD(X). Let the lefthand side of the inequality be c and the righthand side dNWD(X). Since c/d < NWD(X) = a/b we have a/b > (a + c)/(b + d) by the a, b, c.d argument above. Hence (A.2) holds with the ≤ sign switched to a > sign. It remains to prove that NWD(Y ) ≥ NWD(Z)(|Z| − 1)/(|Y | − 1). This follows directly from item (i).\nProof: of Lemma III.5.\nThe following is a counterexample. Let X = {x1}, Y = {x2}, Z = {x3, x4}, maxx∈XY {log f(x)} = 10, maxx∈XZ{log f(x)} = 10, maxx∈ZY {log f(x)} = 5, log f(XY ) = log f(XZ) = log f(ZY ) = 3, minx∈XY {log f(x)} = minx∈XZ{f(x)} = minx∈ZY {log f(x)} = 4, and logN = 35. This arrangement can be realized for queries x1, x2, x3, x4. (As usual we assume that e(xi) 6= e(xj) for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 4 and i 6= j.) Computation shows NWD(XY ) > NWD(XZ) +NWD(ZY ) since 7/31 > 7/62 + 1/62.\nProof: of Theorem III.7.\nWe start with the following:\nClaim A.1. EGmax(X) is an admissible web distance function and EGmax(X) ≤ D(X) for every computable admissible web distance function D.\nProof: Clearly EGmax(X) satisfies items (i) and (ii) of Definition III.6. To show it is an\nadmissible web distance it remains to establish the density requirement (iii). For fixed x consider the sets X 3 x and |X| ≥ 2. We have∑ X:X3x & |X|≥2 2−EGmax(X) ≤ 1,\nFebruary 23, 2015 DRAFT\n23\nsince for every x the set {EGmax(X) : X 3 x & EGmax(X) > 0} is the length set of a binary prefix code and therefore the summation above satisfies the Kraft inequality [9] given by (II.1). Hence EGmax is an admissible distance.\nIt remains to prove minorization. Let D be a computable admissible web distance, and the function f defined by f(X, x) = 2−D(X) for x ∈ X and 0 otherwise. Since D is computable the function f is computable. Given D, one can compute f and therefore K(f) ≤ K(D) + O(1). Let m denote the universal distribution [12]. By [12, Theorem 4.3.2] cDm(X|x) ≥ f(X, x) with cD = 2K(f) = 2K(D)+O(1), that is, cD is a positive constant depending on D only. By [12, Theorem 4.3.4] we have − logm(X|x) = K(X|x) + O(1). Altogether, for every X ∈ X and for every x ∈ X holds log 1/f(X, x) ≥ K(X|x) + log 1/cD + O(1). Hence D(X) ≥ EGmax(X) + log 1/cD +O(1).\nBy Lemma II.4 the function EGmax is upper semicomputable but not computable. The function G(X) − minx∈X{G(x)} is a computable and an admissible function as in Definition III.6. By Claim A.1 it is an upper bound on EGmax(X) and hence EGmax(X) < G(X)−minx∈X{G(x)}. Every admissible property or feature that is common to all members of X is quantized as an upper bound on EGmax(X). Thus, the closer G(X) − minx∈X{G(x)} approximates EGmax(X), the better it approximates the common admissible properties among all search terms in X . This G(X) − minx∈X{G(x)} is the numerator of NWD(X). The denominator is maxx∈X{G(x)}(|X| − 1), a normalizing factor suited to the numerator of NWD(X). It is chosen such that the quotient NWD(X) has a value in [0, 1] (Lemma III.1)."
