      "text" : "Objective The goal of this study was to build a corpus of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk-factor annotations based on Chinese electronic medical records (CEMRs). This corpus is intended to be used to develop a risk-factor information extraction system that, in turn, can be applied as a foundation for the further study of the progress of risk-factors and CVD. Materials and Methods We designed a light-annotation-task to capture CVD-risk-factors with indicators, temporal attributes and assertions explicitly displayed in the records. The task included: 1) preparing data; 2) creating guidelines for capturing annotations (these were created with the help of clinicians); 3) proposing annotation method including building the guidelines draft, training the annotators and updating the guidelines, and corpus construction. Results The outcome of this study was a risk-factor-annotated corpus based on de-identified discharge summaries and progress notes from 600 patients. Built with the help of specialists, this corpus has an inter-annotator agreement (IAA) F1-measure of 0.968, indicating a high reliability. Discussion Our annotations included 12 CVD-risk-factors such as Hypertension and Diabetes. The\nannotations can be applied as a powerful tool to the management of these chronic diseases and the prediction of CVD. Conclusion Guidelines for capturing CVD-risk-factor annotations from CEMRs were proposed and an annotated corpus was established. The obtained document-level annotations can be applied in future studies to monitor risk-factors and CVD over the long term."

      "text" : "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the leading cause of death throughout the world;\nthere were about 17.5 million deaths from CVD in 2012, most of which occurred in low- and middleincome countries.[1] In China, CVD occupies the leading position among causes of death and is responsible for 2 out of every 5 deaths.[2] This situation deeply impairs the health of the Chinese people and is a heavy burden on society. Fortunately, most CVD can be prevented by controlling the malleable risk-factors such as specific medical conditions and the adoption of unhealthy life-styles at early stages.[3] A risk-factor is a pattern of behavior or physical characteristic of a group of individuals that increases the probability of the future occurrence of one or more diseases in that group relative to comparable groups without or with different levels of the behavior or characteristic.[4] Risk-factors, including specific medical conditions such as hypertension and hyperglycemia/diabetes, unhealthy life-style choices such as smoking and alcohol abuse, and other factors such as age and family history, can have prominent effects on the progress of CVD.[3,5] Therefore, monitoring these risk-factors constitutes an important approach in avoiding CVD.\nCEMR is an utilizable medium for the CVD-risk-factors extraction and supervision. Actually,\nelectronic medical record (EMR) is the storage of all health care data and information in electronic formats, along with the associated information processing and knowledge support tools necessary for the managing the health enterprise system.[6] A large amount of individuals’ health narratives in CEMRs make this resource available for study by natural language processing (NLP) techniques especially information extraction (IE) techniques.[7] Furthermore, in 2010, the ministry of health in China published the basic norms of medical records writing[8] and the basic norms of electronic\nmedical records[9] made this data more normative. All these made CEMR an available medium for the CVD-risk-factor extraction researches. Some related works[7,10—21] have been done, but no studies have been conducted on the CVD-risk-factors based on CEMRs. For this, we designed a task to extract CVD-risk-factors from CEMRs.\nFor the extraction, we developed a CVD-risk-factor-annotation-corpus based on CEMRs\nbecause in biomedical field the utilized corpora are far less than other open fields and a specific corpus is so important for building an IE-system. The application of this corpus is to act as the basis for developing an automatic risk-factor extraction system and then a monitoring-platform could be established that can supervise CVD-risk-factors over time. Furthermore, based on these risk-factors comprehensively stored over long terms along with other health information, a function that could predict the trend of each risk-factor, manage these chronic diseases (such as hypertension and diabetes) and estimate the progress of CVD could be also included in the platform. To build the corpus, a light-annotation-task[22] is proposed, and we annotated 600 patients’ de-identified discharge summaries and progress notes from CEMRs.\nOur work is similar to the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth risk-factor annotation shared task.[40] We\nadopted some technologies such as the formulation for annotation guidelines, workflow and the format for annotation results. However, compared to that task, there are four main differences: (1) the biggest difference is that the concerned text is Chinese EMRs; (2) we added additional risk-factors such as A2 and CKD based on the characteristics of CEMRs; (3) not all the risk-factors are explicitly described in the records, some indicators are also adopted in the 2014 i2b2 shared task. However, negative or below-threshold indicators also form a part of one’s health condition and can be used to develop a long-term supervision system, so this information was appended for our annotations; (4) an\nexhaustive-annotation-strategy was applied. We found this strategy caused fewer difficulties for annotators and also resulted in a higher level of IAA despite consuming slightly more time. Related work Related works based on English EMRs\nThe 2006 Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) shared task focused on\nidentifying smoking status from medical discharge records; 928 records covering five categories were annotated by two pulmonologists.[23] The 2008 i2b2 Obesity Challenge was an organized competition to find ways to recognize obesity and comorbidities from discharge summaries, and classify them into four classes: Present, Absent, Questionable, and Unmentioned; at the same time an annotated data set was provided.[24] In 2009, the challenge focused on extracting medication information from medical records, including the names of medications, their dosages, modes of administration, frequencies of administration, durations, and reasons for administration, and released a set of annotated discharge summaries.[25,26] In 2010 the challenge was a concepts, assertions, and relations identification task, and they gave an annotated gold-standard corpus for system training.[27] The Sixth i2b2 Natural Language Processing Challenge was concerned with the issues involved in recognizing temporal relations in clinical records, and offered a corpus of annotated discharge summaries with temporal information.[28,29] Subsequently, the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth NLP project focused on identifying risk-factors for Cardiac Artery Disease (CAD) in the narrative texts of EMRs, a set of 1304 medical records were annotated.[30,31] In 2016, follows were asked to classify psychotic patients into four severities based on their neuropsychiatric clinical records, and 433 records were annotated for training.[32]\nOther works, such as the ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab 2013, have been devoted to\nsolving the difficulties involved in understanding the professional expressions (such as non-standard abbreviations, and ward-specific idioms) that clinicians use when describing their patients, and annotated corpora were provided for system building.[33,34] Another important project was undertaken during SemEval 2015. Its clinical TempEval sub-task was similar to the i2b2 2012 NLP shared task in that participants were asked to find ways to recognize time information, clinical events, and their relations in clinical narratives; manually annotated corpus based on 600 clinical notes and pathology reports was built[35]. Another sub-task of SemEval 2015 involved analyzing clinical text, it attracted the attention to named entity recognition and template slot filling, and the ShARe corpus of annotated clinical text was applied.[34,36] Meystre et al.[37] proposed a new information extraction system for congestive heart failure performance measure based on clinical notes from 1083 Veterans Health Administration patients, and domain experts annotated notes were created for gold standard. Ford et al.[38] studied that extracted information from EMRs text does improve case detection when combined with codes. Related works based on CEMRs\nWang et al.[16] focused on recognizing and normalizing the names of symptoms in traditional\nChinese medicine EMRs; for the judgement, a set of clinical symptom names were manually annotated. Jiang et al.[14] proposed a complete annotation scheme for building a corpus of word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) from CEMRs. Yang et al.[11] focused on designing an annotation scheme and constructing a corpus of named entities and entity relationships from CEMRs; they formulated an annotation specification and built a corpus based on 992 medical discharge summaries and progress notes. Lei[17] and Lei et al.[18] focused on the recognition of named entities in Chinese medical discharge summaries and classified the entities into four categories: clinical problems, procedures, labs,\nand medications; a entities corpus was annotated based on CEMRs. Xu et al.[19] studied a joint model that performed segmentation and named entity recognition in Chinese discharge summaries and built a set of 336 annotated Chinese discharge summaries. Wang et al.[20] researched the extraction of tumor-related information from the Chinese-language operation notes of patients with hepatic carcinomas, and annotated a corpus contains 961 entities. He et al.[21] first proposed a comprehensive corpus of syntactic and semantic annotations from Chinese clinical texts.\nTo sum up these works, research of CVD-risk-factor extraction from CEMRs has not been\nstudied yet. Meanwhile, for the IE tasks studied for the biomedical field, accessible corpora are far less than those for more general extractions but are important for IE-system building. Thus, constructing a CVD-risk-factor annotated corpus is both necessary and fundamental. Moreover, compared with annotation tasks for texts that require little professional knowledge, linguists require the help of medical experts to perform annotations in the biomedical field. MATERIALS AND METHODS A light-annotation-task\nAnnotating CVD-risk-factors from CEMRs, compared with traditional NLP tasks such as\nsegmentation, POS tagging, parsing, and semantic analysis, is a task that is both distinctive and light. As Stubbs says,[22] we need only create a light-annotation-task for risk-factor annotation rather than implementing all the NLP tasks. Therefore, based on the annotation trials conducted by Stubbs and Uzuner,[31] a light-annotation-task in which we only focused on annotations of CVD-risk-factor with indicators, temporal attributes and assertions but no other NLP tasks was built. Meanwhile, an exhaustive-annotation-strategy—we annotated all the occurrences of a CVD-risk-factor in the narrative of CEMRs, no matter how many times it appears—was applied. Notably, in the annotation\ntrials, the increased time consumption caused by exhaustive-annotation-strategy was compensated for by a higher level of IAA and fewer difficulties for the annotators. Data\nWe obtained a snapshot of medical records from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin\nMedical University (a large general hospital that offers clinical services, medical education, scientific research, disease prevention, healthcare and rehabilitation) for all of 2012. The data included images of the medical records for approximately 140,000 patients from 35 departments and 87 subdepartments, ranging from pediatrics to the ICU. To function as annotation tasks for CVD-risk-factors, we selected a subset of CEMRs from 600 patients composed of 344 randomly selected medical records of cardiovascular patients, 190 from cardiovascular surgery patients, and 66 from other departments. Each patient’s medical records contained a series of documents consisting of their discharge summary, progress notes, medical examination reports, electrocardiograms and so on. The discharge summary and progress notes were regarded as the most important free-text of these.[7] A discharge summary is used to summarize the entire therapeutic process and treatment outcome, while the progress notes record the clinical manifestations, medical examinations and treatment periodicity. Therefore, discharge summaries and progress notes for the 600 patients mentioned above were suitable for annotation.\nThereafter, preprocessing was conducted for these records as follows: (1) we used an optical\ncharacter recognition (OCR) tool “Tesseract”[39] to convert the original record images into text; (2) we manually fixed mistakes after the OCR process was complete, and removed identifying information such as patient names, addresses, hospital IDs and doctor names; (3) we encoded the text into Extensible Markup Language (XML) format and added a title section using an XML node. Figure 1 shows\nan example of a progress note in XML format after preprocessing which is prepared for annotation."

      "text" : "As the light-annotation-task says, our goal was to annotate the CVD-risk-factors with indicators,\ntemporal attributes and assertions from the narrative of the CEMRs. According to the characteristics of CEMRs and suggestions of clinicians, the guidelines for annotating these information are presented as follows. CVD-risk-factors and indicators\nAn indicator is used to indicate the existence of a risk-factor that may not be explicitly recorded\nin the narratives of CEMRs but in a cryptic form (e.g. “最高血压达 150/100 mmHg” (the highest blood pressure (Bp) is 150/100 mmHg) also manifests a hypertensive patient). Explicitly mentioned risk-\nfactor and indirect expressions such as tests or treatments that can indicate the existence of risk-factor are given equal status, even indirect information such as quantitative values from medical examinations is more meaningful because it can capture additional details about a patient’s condition. With the assistance of medical experts, we selected a set of risk-factors contains Overweight/Obesity (O2), Hypertension, Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Atherosis, Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), Smoking, Alcohol Abuse (A2), Family History of CVD (FHCVD), Age and Gender, and exploited the indicators of these risk-factors. Table 1 lists all 12 types of risk-factors with the risk-factors in the left column and the indicators on the right.\n Hypoglycemic drug: Patient takes medications confirmed to control blood glucose, e.g. “规律用胰岛素” (patient takes insulin regularly)\nDyslipidemia  Mention: A diagnosis of dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia or a history of\nhyperlipidemia, e.g. “高血脂史” (a history of hyperlipidemia)  High blood lipids: A measurement of blood lipids or a description of the patient’s high blood lipids, e.g. TG (triglyceride): 1.96mmol/L  Regulate blood lipids: A description of blood lipids regulation or unsuccessful regulation, e.g. “降脂” (to lower serum lipids)  Lipid-lowering drug: Patient takes medicine that is confirmed to control blood lipids, e.g. “治疗计划：立普妥 20 mg Qn po” (Treatment plan: Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium) 20 mg, take orally, once per night)\nCKD  Mention: A diagnosis of CKD, e.g. “慢性肾炎” (chronic nephritis) Atherosis  Mention: A diagnosis of atherosclerosis or atherosclerotic plaque, e.g. “冠脉粥样\n斑块” (atherosclerotic plaque)\nOSAS  Mention: A diagnosis of OSAS, e.g. “阻塞型睡眠呼吸暂停综合症” (OSAS) Smoking  Mention: Smoking or a patient history of smoking, e.g. “吸烟 40余年” (smoking\nover 40 years)  Smoking cessation: A description of smoking cessation or that the patient has not yet quit smoking, e.g. “未戒烟” (the patient has not yet quit smoking)  Smoking amount: A description of how much the patient smokes, e.g. “每天 20 支” (20 cigarettes per day)\nA2  Mention: Alcohol abuse, e.g. “长期大量饮酒史” (a long history of heavy\ndrinking)  Drinking amount: A description of how much the patient drinks, e.g. “2两/日” （数值要大于 1）(100 grams of white spirit consumption per day (the number should be over 50 g))\nFHCVD  Mention: Patient has a family history of CVD or has a first-degree relative\n(parents, siblings, or children) who has a history of CVD, e.g. “哥哥有冠心病病史” (the patient’s brother has a history of CVD)\nAge  Mention: The age of the patient, e.g. “66岁” (66 years old)\n Age group: The age group of the patient, e.g. “老年”(elderly)\nGender  Mention: The gender of patient, e.g. “女性” (female)\nNotably, given to construct a CVD-risk-factors timeline, we annotated all the quantitative\nvalues from medical examinations regardless of whether they were over the threshold (e.g., a patient whose Bp is 120/80 mmHg is also annotated for hypertension, even though the measurement is below the 140/90 mmHg criterion[5]). So that all the test values would be extracted and we can build a clear picture of risk-factors changes over time, and this is one of the big difference between the i2b2 2014 risk-factor task and ours. Temporal attributes\nTo construct a health condition timeline, collecting temporal annotations is essential.\nConsidering the time at which the indicators occurred, we divided the risk-factors into four timedependent categories: before the duration of hospital stay (DHS) (the risk-factor occurred before the DHS), during the DHS, after the DHS, and continuing (the risk-factor is continuous). For instance, “平 时血压 130/90 mmHg” (a patient whose ordinary Bp is 130/90 mmHg) is regarded as the high Bp indicator of hypertension with time before the DHS; “查体：Bp 130/80 mmHg” (physical examination: Bp 130/80 mmHg) indicates that the high Bp of Hypertension was made during the DHS; “出院医嘱： 调节血糖” (doctor advice to a patient after discharge: to regulate blood glucose) indicates that the diabetes indicator of regulate blood glucose occurred after the DHS; and “身材肥胖” (a fat body) which is usually unchangeable over the short term would be annotated as a mention of O2 with time continuing. In this way, changes of risk-factors can be clearly presented. For example, no indicators of diabetes were presented during the previous DHS, but evidence shows that the patient exhibited\ndiabetic indicators before the next DHS; therefore, the diabetes occurred between the two DHSs. Specially, age and gender are not included in temporal annotations. Assertions\nDifferent from the works of Stubbs and Uzuner,[30] we first proposed assertions of risk-factors\nin CEMRs. For example, “无糖尿病病史” (patient does not have a history of diabetes) also needs to be considered as such text can certainly show that the patient did not previously have diabetes. In detail, based on whether the risk-factor actually occurred on the patient, we created two modifiers: associated or not associated with the patient. Further, risk-factors associated with the patient are divided into three categories: present, absent and possible. Overall, assertions can be summarized as follows:  Present: the risk-factor definitely occurred on the patient, e.g. “平时血压 130/90 mmHg” (the\npatient’s ordinary Bp is 130/90 mmHg)\n Absent: the risk-factor was considered for the patient, but was negative, e.g. “无糖尿病病史” (the\npatient does not have a history of diabetes)\n Possible: the risk-factor may possibly have occurred on the patient, e.g. “临床初步诊断：糖尿病”\n(Primary diagnosis: diabetes)\n Not associated with the patient: the risk-factor occurred on others, e.g. “弟患糖尿病” (the\npatient’s brother has diabetes)\nAnnotation method\nThe annotation method involves three major tasks: building the guidelines draft, training the\nannotators and updating the guidelines, and corpus construction. These tasks can be seen in Figure 2.\nBuilding the guidelines draft\nBased on annotation guidelines above, the linguists created a preliminary implementation of\nan annotation guidelines draft that included all 12 CVD-risk-factors, indicators, temporal attributes, and assertions along with their definitions, some positive annotations (expressions which should be marked) and negative annotations (expressions which should not be marked) by referencing the 2014\ni2b2/UTHealth risk-factor annotation guideline.[40] Some annotation attempts were conducted under this draft using an annotation tool which was developed specifically for this task. Figure 3 shows a sample annotation.\nUsing sample annotations, errors and inappropriate rules in the preliminary draft were\ncorrected and both positive and negative examples were added to the draft. This process continued until no more modifications were needed; at that point, the specification were considered to be suitable for the next workflow. Training the annotators and updating the guidelines\nFor domain annotation, annotators with specific knowledge backgrounds are desirable.\nConsequently, two Masters students in medicine were employed and trained as annotators. The training process follows an iterative method, each repetition can be summed up as follows:\nPhase 1: A set of discharge summaries and progress notes for 15 randomly selected patients\nwere provided to both annotators for labeling.\nPhase 2: After completing the annotation, the IAA of the two annotated corpus was calculated\nto evaluate the degree to which the annotators were in agreement. For the IAA calculation, one annotated database is used as the gold standard, and the other is compared to the standard to compute the precision, recall, and F1-measure. Here, standard precision, recall, and F1-measure equations were adopted, the calculation equations were described as follows:\n( 1, 2) ( 2)"

The ( )1, 2Agreement A A refers to the same annotations of the two annotators.\nMore calculation details can be found in Hripcsak et al.[41]\nPhase 3: The two annotations were compared. Moreover, any uncertainties would be\ndiscussed by both the linguists and the annotators. A voting method was used to obtain a final agreement.\nPhase 4: Annotation guidelines were updated. In particular, errors found during phase 3 were\nadded to the positive or negative examples and, when necessary, the guidelines were modified.\nThis procedure should be iteratively conducted until the IAA calculated in Phase 2 achieves a\nhigh value continuously. In total, five repetitions were carried out; the resulting IAA-values are listed in Table 2.\nAs Table 2 shows, the iterations obtained very high IAAs. All the F1-measures values were\nabove 0.964 except for Iteration 1 in which the low score was probably caused by the initial unfamiliarity of annotators with the annotation guidelines and tools. Meanwhile, the subsequent iterations obtained surprisingly high scores, indicating that the annotators and guidelines were truly ready for the corpus annotation. Corpus construction\nThe annotators were asked to capture annotations from CEMRs for the 600 patients using the\nupdated annotation guidelines. Moreover, to create a high quality annotated corpus, three measures were taken. One was that, during the development of annotation tool, a button indicating that the labeling is uncertain was for annotators to press when they were unsure of the accuracy of a current annotation. Those uncertainties could be collected and discussed later. Another measure involved the use of overlapped documents (discharge summaries and progress notes of 25 patients), which were distributed to both annotators. These twice-annotated records can be used to calculate IAA and to monitor the quality of the entire annotation evaluation. The last measure was a random sampling\ncheck on the annotations (at least one third were selected) by the linguists. When problems were found, a discussion would be held and the guidelines were updated. RESULTS\nIn total, in the CVD-risk-factor-annotation-corpus comprising the discharge summaries and\nprogress notes for all the 600 patients, there are 9678 annotations associated with the 12 CVD-riskfactors. Of these, “mention” garners 63.5%, while “drug” is rare (due to our restriction in the annotation guidelines that medication must be confirmed to be treated as a risk-factor). Among the risk-factors, hypertension is prominent in CEMR, with 3729 annotations; age and gender occur at the same rate as Bp because they are basic patient attributes that are routinely recorded before diagnosis. The distributions of the four assertions (present, absent, possible, and not associated with patient) were 69.7, 19.2, 11.0, and 0.1 percent, respectively. The “present” assertions occur most often, possibly because positive descriptions may have more significance when creating the medical records. Annotation quality and analysis\nReasonably, the IAA-values for the final corpus should be as high as the IAA-values obtained\nduring the training process due to the work performed before and during the formal annotation to guarantee sufficient quality. The final IAA calculations resulted in 0.971 for precision, 0.965 for recall and 0.968 for the F1-measure; these values demonstrate the high quality of the corpus.\nTable 3 shows the distribution of risk-factors, indicators, temporal attributes and assertions.\nEach row in the table shows the distribution of a single indicator over the entire corpus in different time and assertion partitions.\nOSAS Mention 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 Smoking Mention 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 231 149 0 0 380 380\nSmoking cessation 5 2 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 8 Smoking amount 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 119 0 0 0 119 120\nA2 Mention 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 52 15 0 0 67 76\nDrinking amount 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 19 0 0 0 19 19\nFHCVD Mention 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 10 10 Age Mention - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1233\nAge group - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 626\nGender Mention - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1909\nP: Present, A: Absent, Pb: Possible, N: Not associated with the patient. “-” denotes not considered.\nFor hypertension, “high Bp” is the most common indicator and “mention” is second.\nApproximately 2 “mention” and 3 “high Bp” indicators appear in each patient’s records. Mostly, “mention” annotations are continuing and usually fixed over a short term, while “high Bp” annotations occur during DHSs because Bp value is mainly measured during physical examinations. Meanwhile, 78.7 percent of “regulate Bp” annotations occur during DHSs because controlling Bp is a standard treatment for hypertensive individuals.\nCompared with “high Bp”, annotations identifying “high blood glucose” are far less common\nbecause of the complicated testing technique for blood glucose. In Table 3, the diabetes “mention” annotations comprise 86.7% of all the annotations for this risk-factor, and 64.1% of these “mention” are “continuing, absent.” From discoveries, we knew that “否认高血压、糖尿病病史” (denying a history of hypertension and diabetes) occurs frequently in the records.\nThe spotlight indicator of dyslipidemia annotations is “regulate blood lipids”, because “调节\n血脂” (to regulate blood lipids) is a representative narrative in the assessment and plan section of dyslipidemia records. Moreover, for the same reason, the timing of this indicator is clustered around “during DHS, present”.\nWhen considering CKD, OSAS and FHCVD, the only indicator “mention” occurs infrequently\nwith CKD occurs the most but fewer than 26 times. Meanwhile, there is no “absent” assertion for any of these annotations.\nAtherosclerosis has a relative high number of mentions in our corpus for “稳定冠脉粥样斑块”\n(stabilizing coronary atheromatous plaque) is repeatedly occurred in the assessment and plan section of CEMRs.\nThe number of smoking annotations are relatively high (508 annotations among the records\nof 600 patients). “Mention” and “smoking amount” account for almost all of the occurrences, and 380 “mention” and 119 “smoking amount” annotations include the “continuing” assertion because tobacco use is generally a habit and quitting rarely occurs for a short period.\nThere are a large number of references to alcohol in the narratives of CEMRs such as “否认吸\n烟、饮酒史” (denying the history of smoking and drinking) and “间断少量饮酒史” (a history of intermittent small amounts of alcohol), but these were not tagged as alcohol abuse for the patient’s intake is none or a slight. In contrast, serious usage has only 76 “mention” and 19 “drinking amount” annotations in our corpus and nearly all those are continuing.\nAge and gender as basic information are rich attributes. As with actual discoveries in the\nnarratives of CEMRs, most “mention” annotations for age and gender occur in the hospitalization information section of discharge summaries and in the complaint, case characteristics and diagnosis basis sections of progress notes. Occasionally, “age group” occurs in the case characteristics and diagnosis basis sections. DISCUSSION\nWe developed a corpus of CVD-risk-factor annotations that include indicators, temporal\nattributes and assertion. Linguists and clinicians cooperated throughout the entire corpus construction from drafting annotation guidelines to discussing disagreements. The final IAA-values achieved for this corpus reflects its high level.\nIn our corpus, a test value was annotated whether the test outcome is above or below a\nstandard threshold, which was designed to build a complete risk-factor variation in long term. For hypertension, we annotated all the Bp values regardless of whether it is above the standard 140/90 mmHg. Based on these annotations, if supervise individual’s condition in long term, the trained IE-\nsystem can extract all the Bp conditions with no omissions and a picture of Bp variations will be appeared. Appropriate warning or intervention treatment would be applied at a critical variation point.\nThe annotated therapeutic method such as regulate blood glucose and hypoglycemic drug\nprovides optional treatment recommendation. The trained IE-system, after extracting plenty of CEMRs, can provide clinician referable treatments while retrieving a similar condition. Along time dimension, these extractions can provide an exhibition of treatment effect, such as a regulating glucose was recognized but no more glucose treatments were happened after would show this regulating had a positive effect. This has a significance for clinician to treat a similar patient and decide which treatment would be better.\nThe annotations of O2, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, CKD, Atherosis can play a role of\nmanagement of these chronic diseases. An IE-system can extract individual’s conditions such as examination values and medications; a long-term monitoring-platform can monitor these variations, feedback the effects of treatments, and predict the tendencies of these diseases. Globally, nearly one billion people have high blood pressure; in 2008, diabetes was responsible for 1.3 billion deaths; raised cholesterol was estimated to cause 2.6 million deaths; at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese.[5] So a monitoring-platform including managing these chronic disease has a significance for reducing the sufferings of such a lot of patients and the occurrences of CVD. By the way, the annotation of smoking and alcohol abuse can be used to the studying of directing people’s lifestyle. CONCLUSION\nThis paper constructs an annotated corpus of CVD-risk-factors. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first Chinese corpus concerning risk-factors for CVD. We engaged both clinicians and\nannotators during the process of drafting guidelines and annotating the medical records. We proposed the annotation method to create high quality annotations; the final IAA-values indicate the high quality of the resulting corpus. These document-level risk-factor annotations, alone with the included temporal attributes and assertion, can be utilized in future studies of the progress of risk-factors and CVD over time. This corpus can play a significant role in developing a future IE-system that can extract CVD-risk-factors from CEMRs to build a clear picture of individuals’ CVD-risk-factors conditions, and it makes developing a monitoring-platform to supervise the progression of risk-factors and CVD possible.

    "abstractText" : "Objective The goal of this study was to build a corpus of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk-factor annotations based on Chinese electronic medical records (CEMRs). This corpus is intended to be used to develop a risk-factor information extraction system that, in turn, can be applied as a foundation for the further study of the progress of risk-factors and CVD. Materials and Methods We designed a light-annotation-task to capture CVD-risk-factors with indicators, temporal attributes and assertions explicitly displayed in the records. The task included: 1) preparing data; 2) creating guidelines for capturing annotations (these were created with the help of clinicians); 3) proposing annotation method including building the guidelines draft, training the annotators and updating the guidelines, and corpus construction. Results The outcome of this study was a risk-factor-annotated corpus based on de-identified discharge summaries and progress notes from 600 patients. Built with the help of specialists, this corpus has an inter-annotator agreement (IAA) F1-measure of 0.968, indicating a high reliability. Discussion Our annotations included 12 CVD-risk-factors such as Hypertension and Diabetes. The annotations can be applied as a powerful tool to the management of these chronic diseases and the prediction of CVD. Conclusion Guidelines for capturing CVD-risk-factor annotations from CEMRs were proposed and an annotated corpus was established. The obtained document-level annotations can be applied in future studies to monitor risk-factors and CVD over the long term. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the leading cause of death throughout the world; there were about 17.5 million deaths from CVD in 2012, most of which occurred in lowand middleincome countries.[1] In China, CVD occupies the leading position among causes of death and is responsible for 2 out of every 5 deaths.[2] This situation deeply impairs the health of the Chinese people and is a heavy burden on society. Fortunately, most CVD can be prevented by controlling the malleable risk-factors such as specific medical conditions and the adoption of unhealthy life-styles at early stages.[3] A risk-factor is a pattern of behavior or physical characteristic of a group of individuals that increases the probability of the future occurrence of one or more diseases in that group relative to comparable groups without or with different levels of the behavior or characteristic.[4] Risk-factors, including specific medical conditions such as hypertension and hyperglycemia/diabetes, unhealthy life-style choices such as smoking and alcohol abuse, and other factors such as age and family history, can have prominent effects on the progress of CVD.[3,5] Therefore, monitoring these risk-factors constitutes an important approach in avoiding CVD. CEMR is an utilizable medium for the CVD-risk-factors extraction and supervision. Actually, electronic medical record (EMR) is the storage of all health care data and information in electronic formats, along with the associated information processing and knowledge support tools necessary for the managing the health enterprise system.[6] A large amount of individuals’ health narratives in CEMRs make this resource available for study by natural language processing (NLP) techniques especially information extraction (IE) techniques.[7] Furthermore, in 2010, the ministry of health in China published the basic norms of medical records writing[8] and the basic norms of electronic medical records[9] made this data more normative. All these made CEMR an available medium for the CVD-risk-factor extraction researches. Some related works[7,10—21] have been done, but no studies have been conducted on the CVD-risk-factors based on CEMRs. For this, we designed a task to extract CVD-risk-factors from CEMRs. For the extraction, we developed a CVD-risk-factor-annotation-corpus based on CEMRs because in biomedical field the utilized corpora are far less than other open fields and a specific corpus is so important for building an IE-system. The application of this corpus is to act as the basis for developing an automatic risk-factor extraction system and then a monitoring-platform could be established that can supervise CVD-risk-factors over time. Furthermore, based on these risk-factors comprehensively stored over long terms along with other health information, a function that could predict the trend of each risk-factor, manage these chronic diseases (such as hypertension and diabetes) and estimate the progress of CVD could be also included in the platform. To build the corpus, a light-annotation-task[22] is proposed, and we annotated 600 patients’ de-identified discharge summaries and progress notes from CEMRs. Our work is similar to the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth risk-factor annotation shared task.[40] We adopted some technologies such as the formulation for annotation guidelines, workflow and the format for annotation results. However, compared to that task, there are four main differences: (1) the biggest difference is that the concerned text is Chinese EMRs; (2) we added additional risk-factors such as A2 and CKD based on the characteristics of CEMRs; (3) not all the risk-factors are explicitly described in the records, some indicators are also adopted in the 2014 i2b2 shared task. However, negative or below-threshold indicators also form a part of one’s health condition and can be used to develop a long-term supervision system, so this information was appended for our annotations; (4) an exhaustive-annotation-strategy was applied. We found this strategy caused fewer difficulties for annotators and also resulted in a higher level of IAA despite consuming slightly more time. Related work Related works based on English EMRs The 2006 Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) shared task focused on identifying smoking status from medical discharge records; 928 records covering five categories were annotated by two pulmonologists.[23] The 2008 i2b2 Obesity Challenge was an organized competition to find ways to recognize obesity and comorbidities from discharge summaries, and classify them into four classes: Present, Absent, Questionable, and Unmentioned; at the same time an annotated data set was provided.[24] In 2009, the challenge focused on extracting medication information from medical records, including the names of medications, their dosages, modes of administration, frequencies of administration, durations, and reasons for administration, and released a set of annotated discharge summaries.[25,26] In 2010 the challenge was a concepts, assertions, and relations identification task, and they gave an annotated gold-standard corpus for system training.[27] The Sixth i2b2 Natural Language Processing Challenge was concerned with the issues involved in recognizing temporal relations in clinical records, and offered a corpus of annotated discharge summaries with temporal information.[28,29] Subsequently, the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth NLP project focused on identifying risk-factors for Cardiac Artery Disease (CAD) in the narrative texts of EMRs, a set of 1304 medical records were annotated.[30,31] In 2016, follows were asked to classify psychotic patients into four severities based on their neuropsychiatric clinical records, and 433 records were annotated for training.[32] Other works, such as the ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab 2013, have been devoted to solving the difficulties involved in understanding the professional expressions (such as non-standard abbreviations, and ward-specific idioms) that clinicians use when describing their patients, and annotated corpora were provided for system building.[33,34] Another important project was undertaken during SemEval 2015. Its clinical TempEval sub-task was similar to the i2b2 2012 NLP shared task in that participants were asked to find ways to recognize time information, clinical events, and their relations in clinical narratives; manually annotated corpus based on 600 clinical notes and pathology reports was built[35]. Another sub-task of SemEval 2015 involved analyzing clinical text, it attracted the attention to named entity recognition and template slot filling, and the ShARe corpus of annotated clinical text was applied.[34,36] Meystre et al.[37] proposed a new information extraction system for congestive heart failure performance measure based on clinical notes from 1083 Veterans Health Administration patients, and domain experts annotated notes were created for gold standard. Ford et al.[38] studied that extracted information from EMRs text does improve case detection when combined with codes. Related works based on CEMRs Wang et al.[16] focused on recognizing and normalizing the names of symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine EMRs; for the judgement, a set of clinical symptom names were manually annotated. Jiang et al.[14] proposed a complete annotation scheme for building a corpus of word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) from CEMRs. Yang et al.[11] focused on designing an annotation scheme and constructing a corpus of named entities and entity relationships from CEMRs; they formulated an annotation specification and built a corpus based on 992 medical discharge summaries and progress notes. Lei[17] and Lei et al.[18] focused on the recognition of named entities in Chinese medical discharge summaries and classified the entities into four categories: clinical problems, procedures, labs, and medications; a entities corpus was annotated based on CEMRs. Xu et al.[19] studied a joint model that performed segmentation and named entity recognition in Chinese discharge summaries and built a set of 336 annotated Chinese discharge summaries. Wang et al.[20] researched the extraction of tumor-related information from the Chinese-language operation notes of patients with hepatic carcinomas, and annotated a corpus contains 961 entities. He et al.[21] first proposed a comprehensive corpus of syntactic and semantic annotations from Chinese clinical texts. To sum up these works, research of CVD-risk-factor extraction from CEMRs has not been studied yet. Meanwhile, for the IE tasks studied for the biomedical field, accessible corpora are far less than those for more general extractions but are important for IE-system building. Thus, constructing a CVD-risk-factor annotated corpus is both necessary and fundamental. Moreover, compared with annotation tasks for texts that require little professional knowledge, linguists require the help of medical experts to perform annotations in the biomedical field. MATERIALS AND METHODS A light-annotation-task Annotating CVD-risk-factors from CEMRs, compared with traditional NLP tasks such as segmentation, POS tagging, parsing, and semantic analysis, is a task that is both distinctive and light. As Stubbs says,[22] we need only create a light-annotation-task for risk-factor annotation rather than implementing all the NLP tasks. Therefore, based on the annotation trials conducted by Stubbs and Uzuner,[31] a light-annotation-task in which we only focused on annotations of CVD-risk-factor with indicators, temporal attributes and assertions but no other NLP tasks was built. Meanwhile, an exhaustive-annotation-strategy—we annotated all the occurrences of a CVD-risk-factor in the narrative of CEMRs, no matter how many times it appears—was applied. Notably, in the annotation trials, the increased time consumption caused by exhaustive-annotation-strategy was compensated for by a higher level of IAA and fewer difficulties for the annotators. Data We obtained a snapshot of medical records from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University (a large general hospital that offers clinical services, medical education, scientific research, disease prevention, healthcare and rehabilitation) for all of 2012. The data included images of the medical records for approximately 140,000 patients from 35 departments and 87 subdepartments, ranging from pediatrics to the ICU. To function as annotation tasks for CVD-risk-factors, we selected a subset of CEMRs from 600 patients composed of 344 randomly selected medical records of cardiovascular patients, 190 from cardiovascular surgery patients, and 66 from other departments. Each patient’s medical records contained a series of documents consisting of their discharge summary, progress notes, medical examination reports, electrocardiograms and so on. The discharge summary and progress notes were regarded as the most important free-text of these.[7] A discharge summary is used to summarize the entire therapeutic process and treatment outcome, while the progress notes record the clinical manifestations, medical examinations and treatment periodicity. Therefore, discharge summaries and progress notes for the 600 patients mentioned above were suitable for annotation. Thereafter, preprocessing was conducted for these records as follows: (1) we used an optical character recognition (OCR) tool “Tesseract”[39] to convert the original record images into text; (2) we manually fixed mistakes after the OCR process was complete, and removed identifying information such as patient names, addresses, hospital IDs and doctor names; (3) we encoded the text into Extensible Markup Language (XML) format and added a title section using an XML node. Figure 1 shows an example of a progress note in XML format after preprocessing which is prepared for annotation. Figure 1. A sample progress note after preprocessing Annotation guidelines As the light-annotation-task says, our goal was to annotate the CVD-risk-factors with indicators, temporal attributes and assertions from the narrative of the CEMRs. According to the characteristics of CEMRs and suggestions of clinicians, the guidelines for annotating these information are presented as follows. CVD-risk-factors and indicators An indicator is used to indicate the existence of a risk-factor that may not be explicitly recorded in the narratives of CEMRs but in a cryptic form (e.g. “最高血压达 150/100 mmHg” (the highest blood pressure (Bp) is 150/100 mmHg) also manifests a hypertensive patient). Explicitly mentioned riskfactor and indirect expressions such as tests or treatments that can indicate the existence of risk-factor are given equal status, even indirect information such as quantitative values from medical examinations is more meaningful because it can capture additional details about a patient’s condition. With the assistance of medical experts, we selected a set of risk-factors contains Overweight/Obesity (O2), Hypertension, Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Atherosis, Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), Smoking, Alcohol Abuse (A2), Family History of CVD (FHCVD), Age and Gender, and exploited the indicators of these risk-factors. Table 1 lists all 12 types of risk-factors with the risk-factors in the left column and the indicators on the right. Table 1 CVD-risk-factors and their indicators. Risk-factors Indicators O2  Mention: A diagnosis of patient overweight or obesity, e.g. “肥胖” (obesity) Hypertension  Mention: A diagnosis or history of hypertension, e.g. “高血压病史 20年” (a history of hypertension for 20 years)  High Bp: A measurement of Bp or a description of the patient’s high Bp, e.g. Bp 150/100 mmHg  Regulate Bp: A description of Bp regulation or unsuccessful regulation, e.g. “控制 血压” (regulating Bp)  Blood pressure drug: Patient takes medicine which is confirmed to control Bp, e.g. “口服降压药” (patient is taking hypotensor) Diabetes  Mention: A diagnosis or a history of diabetes, e.g. “糖尿病” (diabetes)  High blood glucose: A measurement of blood glucose or a description of the patient’s high blood glucose, e.g. blood glucose: “随机血糖:14.5mmol/L” (RBG (Random Blood Glucose): 14.5mmol/L)  Regulate blood glucose: A description of blood glucose regulation or unsuccessful regulation, e.g. “调节血糖” (regulating the glucose)  Hypoglycemic drug: Patient takes medications confirmed to control blood glucose, e.g. “规律用胰岛素” (patient takes insulin regularly) Dyslipidemia  Mention: A diagnosis of dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia or a history of hyperlipidemia, e.g. “高血脂史” (a history of hyperlipidemia)  High blood lipids: A measurement of blood lipids or a description of the patient’s high blood lipids, e.g. TG (triglyceride): 1.96mmol/L  Regulate blood lipids: A description of blood lipids regulation or unsuccessful regulation, e.g. “降脂” (to lower serum lipids)  Lipid-lowering drug: Patient takes medicine that is confirmed to control blood lipids, e.g. “治疗计划:立普妥 20 mg Qn po” (Treatment plan: Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium) 20 mg, take orally, once per night) CKD  Mention: A diagnosis of CKD, e.g. “慢性肾炎” (chronic nephritis) Atherosis  Mention: A diagnosis of atherosclerosis or atherosclerotic plaque, e.g. “冠脉粥样 斑块” (atherosclerotic plaque) OSAS  Mention: A diagnosis of OSAS, e.g. “阻塞型睡眠呼吸暂停综合症” (OSAS) Smoking  Mention: Smoking or a patient history of smoking, e.g. “吸烟 40余年” (smoking over 40 years)  Smoking cessation: A description of smoking cessation or that the patient has not yet quit smoking, e.g. “未戒烟” (the patient has not yet quit smoking)  Smoking amount: A description of how much the patient smokes, e.g. “每天 20 支” (20 cigarettes per day) A2  Mention: Alcohol abuse, e.g. “长期大量饮酒史” (a long history of heavy drinking)  Drinking amount: A description of how much the patient drinks, e.g. “2两/日” (数值要大于 1)(100 grams of white spirit consumption per day (the number should be over 50 g)) FHCVD  Mention: Patient has a family history of CVD or has a first-degree relative (parents, siblings, or children) who has a history of CVD, e.g. “哥哥有冠心病病史” (the patient’s brother has a history of CVD) Age  Mention: The age of the patient, e.g. “66岁” (66 years old)  Age group: The age group of the patient, e.g. “老年”(elderly) Gender  Mention: The gender of patient, e.g. “女性” (female) Notably, given to construct a CVD-risk-factors timeline, we annotated all the quantitative values from medical examinations regardless of whether they were over the threshold (e.g., a patient whose Bp is 120/80 mmHg is also annotated for hypertension, even though the measurement is below the 140/90 mmHg criterion[5]). So that all the test values would be extracted and we can build a clear picture of risk-factors changes over time, and this is one of the big difference between the i2b2 2014 risk-factor task and ours. Temporal attributes To construct a health condition timeline, collecting temporal annotations is essential. Considering the time at which the indicators occurred, we divided the risk-factors into four timedependent categories: before the duration of hospital stay (DHS) (the risk-factor occurred before the DHS), during the DHS, after the DHS, and continuing (the risk-factor is continuous). For instance, “平 时血压 130/90 mmHg” (a patient whose ordinary Bp is 130/90 mmHg) is regarded as the high Bp indicator of hypertension with time before the DHS; “查体:Bp 130/80 mmHg” (physical examination: Bp 130/80 mmHg) indicates that the high Bp of Hypertension was made during the DHS; “出院医嘱: 调节血糖” (doctor advice to a patient after discharge: to regulate blood glucose) indicates that the diabetes indicator of regulate blood glucose occurred after the DHS; and “身材肥胖” (a fat body) which is usually unchangeable over the short term would be annotated as a mention of O2 with time continuing. In this way, changes of risk-factors can be clearly presented. For example, no indicators of diabetes were presented during the previous DHS, but evidence shows that the patient exhibited diabetic indicators before the next DHS; therefore, the diabetes occurred between the two DHSs. Specially, age and gender are not included in temporal annotations. Assertions Different from the works of Stubbs and Uzuner,[30] we first proposed assertions of risk-factors in CEMRs. For example, “无糖尿病病史” (patient does not have a history of diabetes) also needs to be considered as such text can certainly show that the patient did not previously have diabetes. In detail, based on whether the risk-factor actually occurred on the patient, we created two modifiers: associated or not associated with the patient. Further, risk-factors associated with the patient are divided into three categories: present, absent and possible. Overall, assertions can be summarized as follows:  Present: the risk-factor definitely occurred on the patient, e.g. “平时血压 130/90 mmHg” (the patient’s ordinary Bp is 130/90 mmHg)  Absent: the risk-factor was considered for the patient, but was negative, e.g. “无糖尿病病史” (the patient does not have a history of diabetes)  Possible: the risk-factor may possibly have occurred on the patient, e.g. “临床初步诊断:糖尿病” (Primary diagnosis: diabetes)  Not associated with the patient: the risk-factor occurred on others, e.g. “弟患糖尿病” (the patient’s brother has diabetes) Annotation method The annotation method involves three major tasks: building the guidelines draft, training the annotators and updating the guidelines, and corpus construction. These tasks can be seen in Figure 2. Figure 2. The flowchart for CVD-risk-factor annotation method Building the guidelines draft Based on annotation guidelines above, the linguists created a preliminary implementation of an annotation guidelines draft that included all 12 CVD-risk-factors, indicators, temporal attributes, and assertions along with their definitions, some positive annotations (expressions which should be marked) and negative annotations (expressions which should not be marked) by referencing the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth risk-factor annotation guideline.[40] Some annotation attempts were conducted under this draft using an annotation tool which was developed specifically for this task. Figure 3 shows a sample annotation. Figure 3. A sample annotation for CVD-risk-factors Using sample annotations, errors and inappropriate rules in the preliminary draft were corrected and both positive and negative examples were added to the draft. This process continued until no more modifications were needed; at that point, the specification were considered to be suitable for the next workflow. Training the annotators and updating the guidelines For domain annotation, annotators with specific knowledge backgrounds are desirable. Consequently, two Masters students in medicine were employed and trained as annotators. The training process follows an iterative method, each repetition can be summed up as follows: Phase 1: A set of discharge summaries and progress notes for 15 randomly selected patients were provided to both annotators for labeling. Phase 2: After completing the annotation, the IAA of the two annotated corpus was calculated to evaluate the degree to which the annotators were in agreement. For the IAA calculation, one annotated database is used as the gold standard, and the other is compared to the standard to compute the precision, recall, and F1-measure. Here, standard precision, recall, and F1-measure equations were adopted, the calculation equations were described as follows: ( 1, 2) ( 2) Agreement A A precision Annotation A = , (1) ( 1, 2) ( 1) Agreement A A recall Annotation A = , (2) 1 2 = . precision recall F precision recall × × + (3) Here, we regarded the annotations of annotator 1 A as gold standard and evaluated the quality of 2 A annotations. The ( ) 1, 2 Agreement A A refers to the same annotations of the two annotators. More calculation details can be found in Hripcsak et al.[41] Phase 3: The two annotations were compared. Moreover, any uncertainties would be discussed by both the linguists and the annotators. A voting method was used to obtain a final agreement. Phase 4: Annotation guidelines were updated. In particular, errors found during phase 3 were added to the positive or negative examples and, when necessary, the guidelines were modified. This procedure should be iteratively conducted until the IAA calculated in Phase 2 achieves a high value continuously. In total, five repetitions were carried out; the resulting IAA-values are listed in Table 2. Table 2. IAA-values achieved during the iterative training process Iteration 1 Iteration 2 Iteration 3 Iteration 4 Iteration 5 Precision 0.810 0.977 0.967 0.986 0.988 Recall 0.815 0.977 0.962 0.986 0.988 F1-measure 0.812 0.977 0.964 0.986 0.988 As Table 2 shows, the iterations obtained very high IAAs. All the F1-measures values were above 0.964 except for Iteration 1 in which the low score was probably caused by the initial unfamiliarity of annotators with the annotation guidelines and tools. Meanwhile, the subsequent iterations obtained surprisingly high scores, indicating that the annotators and guidelines were truly ready for the corpus annotation. Corpus construction The annotators were asked to capture annotations from CEMRs for the 600 patients using the updated annotation guidelines. Moreover, to create a high quality annotated corpus, three measures were taken. One was that, during the development of annotation tool, a button indicating that the labeling is uncertain was for annotators to press when they were unsure of the accuracy of a current annotation. Those uncertainties could be collected and discussed later. Another measure involved the use of overlapped documents (discharge summaries and progress notes of 25 patients), which were distributed to both annotators. These twice-annotated records can be used to calculate IAA and to monitor the quality of the entire annotation evaluation. The last measure was a random sampling check on the annotations (at least one third were selected) by the linguists. When problems were found, a discussion would be held and the guidelines were updated. RESULTS In total, in the CVD-risk-factor-annotation-corpus comprising the discharge summaries and progress notes for all the 600 patients, there are 9678 annotations associated with the 12 CVD-riskfactors. Of these, “mention” garners 63.5%, while “drug” is rare (due to our restriction in the annotation guidelines that medication must be confirmed to be treated as a risk-factor). Among the risk-factors, hypertension is prominent in CEMR, with 3729 annotations; age and gender occur at the same rate as Bp because they are basic patient attributes that are routinely recorded before diagnosis. The distributions of the four assertions (present, absent, possible, and not associated with patient) were 69.7, 19.2, 11.0, and 0.1 percent, respectively. The “present” assertions occur most often, possibly because positive descriptions may have more significance when creating the medical records. Annotation quality and analysis Reasonably, the IAA-values for the final corpus should be as high as the IAA-values obtained during the training process due to the work performed before and during the formal annotation to guarantee sufficient quality. The final IAA calculations resulted in 0.971 for precision, 0.965 for recall and 0.968 for the F1-measure; these values demonstrate the high quality of the corpus. Table 3 shows the distribution of risk-factors, indicators, temporal attributes and assertions. Each row in the table shows the distribution of a single indicator over the entire corpus in different time and assertion partitions. Table 3.
