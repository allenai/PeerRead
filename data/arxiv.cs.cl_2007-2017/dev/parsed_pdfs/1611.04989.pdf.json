      "text" : "Code-Mixing and Code-Switching are observed in the text or speech produced by a multilingual user. Code-Mixing occurs when a user changes the language within a sentence, i.e. a clause, phrase or word of one language is used within an utterance of another language. Whereas, the co-occurrence of speech extract of two different grammatical systems is known as Code-Switching.\nThe language analysis of code-mixed text is a non-trivial task. Traditional approaches of POS tagging are not effective, for this text, as it does not adhere to any grammatical structure in general. Many studies have shown that RNN based POS taggers produced comparable results and, is also the state-of-the-art for some languages. How-\never, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been done for RNN based POS tagging of codemixed data.\nIn this paper, we have proposed a POS tagger using RNN-LM architecture for code-mixed Indian social media text. Earlier, researchers have adopted RNN-LM architecture for Natural language Understanding (NLU) (Yao et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2014) and Translation Quality Estimation (Patel and Sasikumar, 2016). RNNLM models are similar to other vectorspace language models (Bengio et al., 2003; Morin and Bengio, 2005; Schwenk, 2007; Mnih and Hinton, 2009) where we represent each word with a high dimensional real-valued vector. We modified RNN-LM architecture to predict the POS tag of a word, given the word and its context. Let’s consider the following example:\nInput: behen ki shaadi and m not there\nOutput : G N G PRP G N CC G V G R G R\nIn the above sentence, to predict POS tag (G N) for the word shaadi using an RNN-LM model with window size 3, the input will be ki shaadi and. Whereas, in standard RNN-LM model, ki andwill be the input with shaadi as the output. We will discuss details of various models tried and their implementations in section 3.\nIn this paper, we show that our approach achieves results close to the state-of-the-art systems such as 1Stanford (Toutanova et al., 2003), and 2HunPos (Halácsy et al., 2007) .\n1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml (Maximum-Entropy based POS tagger)\n2https://code.google.com/archive/p/hunpos/ (Hidden Markov Model based POS tagger)\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n04 98\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n5 N\nov 2\n01 6"

      "text" : "POS tagging has been investigated for decades in the literature of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Different methods like a Support Vector Machine (Màrquez and Giménez, 2004), Decision Tree (Schmid and Laws, 2008), Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Kupiec, 1992) and, Conditional Random Field Auto Encoders (Ammar et al., 2014) have been tried for this task. Among these works, Neural Network (NN) based models is mainly related to this paper. In NN family, RNN is widely used network for various NLP applications (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Socher et al., 2013a; Socher et al., 2013b).\nRecently, RNN based models have been used to POS tag the formal text, but have not been tried yet on code-mixed data. Wang et al. (2015) have tried Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) on Penn Treebank WSJ test set, and reported stateof-the-art performance. Qin (2015) has shown that RNN models outperform Majority Voting (MV) and HMM techniques for POS tagging of Chinese Buddhist text. Zennaki et al. (2015) have used RNN for resource-poor languages and reported comparable results with state-of-the-art systems (Das and Petrov, 2011; Duong et al., 2013; Gouws and Søgaard, 2015).\nWork on POS tagging code-mixed Indian social media text is at a very nascent stage to date. Vyas et al. (2014) and Jamatia et al. (2015) have worked on data labeling and automatic POS tagging of such data using various machine learning techniques. Building further on that labeled data, Pimpale and Patel (2015) and, Sarkar (2015) have tried word embedding as an additional feature to the machine learning based classifiers for POS tagging."

We initialized all the square weight matrices as random orthogonal matrices. All the bias vectors were initialized to zero. Other weight matrices were sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 0.0001.\nWe trained all the models using Truncated Back-Propagation-Through-Time (TBPTT) (Werbos, 1990) with the stochastic gradient descent. Standard values of hyperparameters were used for RNN model training, as suggested in the literature (Yao et al., 2014; Patel and Sasikumar, 2016). The depth of BPTT was fixed to 7 for all the models. We trained each model for 50 epochs and used Ada-delta (Zeiler, 2012) to adapt the learning rate of each parameter automatically ( = 10−6 and ρ = 0.95)."

Table 1 details sizes of the different sets at the sentence and token level.

In the preprocessing, we mapped all the words of a group to a single new token as they have the same POS tag.

In the second configuration (GRU Pre), we trained word representations (pre-training) using word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013b) tool and fine tuned with the training of other parameters of the network. Pre-training not only guides the learning towards minima with better generalization in non-convex optimization (Bengio, 2009; Erhan et al., 2010) but also improves the accuracy of the system (Kreutzer et al., 2015; Patel and Sasikumar, 2016). In the third setting (GRU Pre Lang), we also added language of the words as an additional feature with the context words. We learn the vector representation of languages similar to that of words, from scratch."

Also, the accuracy of our best system (GRU Pre Lang) is comparable to that of Stanford and HunPos. GRU models are out-performing other models (Simple RNN, LSTM, Deep LSTM) for this task also as reported by Chung et al. (2014) for a suit of NLP tasks."

For constrained submission, the output of GRU Pre Lang was used. We trained Stanford POS tagger with the same data for unconstrained submission.

Also, we did the confusion matrix analysis and found that these POS tags are mostly confused with each other only. For instance, G J POS tag was tagged 28 times wrongly to the other POS tags in which 17 times it was G N.\n• RNN models require a huge amount of corpus to train the model parameters. From the results, we can observe that for hien and te-en with only approx 2K training sentences, the results of best RNN model (GRU Pre Lang) are comparable to Stanford and HunPos. For bn-en, the corpus was very less (only approx 0.5K sentences) for RNN training which resulted into poor performance compared to Stanford and HunPos. With this and the earlier work on RNN based POS tagging, we can expect that RNN models could achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with given the sufficient amount of training data.\n• In general, LSTM and Deep LSTM models perform better than Simple RNN. But here, Simple RNN is outperforming both LSTM and Deep LSTM. The reason could be less amount of data for training such a complex model.\n• Few orthographically similar words of English and Hindi, having different POS tags are given with examples in Table 3. System confuses in POS tagging of such words. With adding language as an additional feature, we were able to tag these type of words correctly."

Also, the accuracy of our approach is comparable to that of Stanford and HunPos.\nIn the future, we could try RNN models with more features like POS tags of context words, prefixes and suffixes, length, position, etc. Word characters also have been found to be a very useful feature in RNN based POS taggers."

The shared task was to predict Part of Speech (POS) tag at word level for a given text. The codemixed text is generated mostly on social media by multilingual users. The presence of the multilingual words, transliterations, and spelling variations make such content linguistically complex. In this paper, we propose an approach to POS tag code-mixed social media text using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) architecture. We submitted the results for Hindi-English (hi-en), BengaliEnglish (bn-en), and Telugu-English (teen) code-mixed data.",
