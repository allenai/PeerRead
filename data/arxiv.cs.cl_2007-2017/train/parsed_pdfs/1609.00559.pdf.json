      "text" : "Measures of semantic similarity and relatedness quantify the degree to which two concepts are similar (e.g., lung-heart) or related (e.g., lungbronchitis). Semantic similarity can be viewed as a special case of semantic relatedness – to be similar is one of many ways that a pair of concepts may be related. The automated discovery of groups of semantically similar or related terms is critical to improving the retrieval (Rada et al., 1989) and clustering (Lin et al., 2007) of biomedical and clinical documents, and the development of biomedical terminologies and ontologies (Bodenreider and Burgun, 2004).\nThere is a long history of success in using distributional methods to discover semantic similarity and relatedness (e.g., (Lin and Pantel, 2002;\nReisinger and Mooney, 2010; Radinsky et al., 2011; Yih and Qazvinian, 2012)). These methods are all based on the distributional hypothesis, which holds that two terms that are distributionally similar (i.e., used in the same context) will also be semantically similar (Harris, 1954; Weeds et al., 2004).\nHowever, despite these successes distributional methods do not perform well when data is very sparse (which is common). One possible solution is to use second–order co–occurrence vectors (Schütze, 1992; Schütze, 1998). In this approach the similarity between two words is not strictly based on their co–occurrence frequencies, but rather on the frequencies of the other words which occur with both of them (i.e., second order co–occurrences). This approach has been shown to be successful in quantifying semantic relatedness (Islam and Inkpen, 2006; Pedersen et al., 2007). However, while more robust in the face of sparsity, second–order methods can result in significant amounts of noise, where contextual information that is overly general is included and does not contribute to quantifying the semantic relatedness between the two concepts.\nOur goal then is to discover methods that automatically reduce the amount of noise in a second– order co–occurrence vector. We achieve this by embedding pairwise semantic similarity scores derived from a taxonomy into our second–order vectors, and then using these scores to select only the most semantically similar co–occurrences (thereby reducing noise).\nWe evaluate our method on two datasets that have been annotated in multiple ways. One has been annotated for both similarity and relatedness, and the other has been annotated for relatedness by two different types of experts (medical doctors and medical coders). Our results show that embedding second order co–occurrences with measures\nof semantic similarity increases correlation with our human reference standards. This suggests that these methods have the potential to improve performance over purely distributional methods."

SNOMED-CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) is a comprehensive clinical terminology created for the electronic representation of clinical health information. MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) is a taxonomy of biomedical terms developed for indexing biomedical journal articles.\nWe obtain SNOMED-CT and MeSH via the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus (version 2014AA). The Metathesaurus contains approximately 2 million biomedical and clinical concepts from over 150 different terminologies that have been semi-automatically integrated into a single source. Concepts in the Metathesaurus are connected largely by two types of hierarchical relations: parent/child (PAR/CHD) and broader/narrower (RB/RN)."

      "text" : "Measures of semantic similarity can be classified into three broad categories : path-based, featurebased and information content (IC). Path-based similarity measures use the structure of a taxonomy to measure similarity - concepts positioned close to each other are more similar than those further apart. Feature-based methods rely on set theoretic measures of overlap between features (union and intersection). The information content measures quantify the amount of information that a concept provides – more specific concepts have a higher amount of information content."

      "text" : "(Rada et al., 1989) introduce the Conceptual Distance measure. This measure is simply the length of the shortest path between two concepts (c1 and c2) in the MeSH hierarchy. Paths are based on broader than (RB) and narrower than (RN) relations. (Caviedes and Cimino, 2004) extends this measure to use parent (PAR) and child (CHD) relations. Our path measure is simply the reciprocal of this shortest path value (Equation 1), so that\nlarger values (approaching 1) indicate a high degree of similarity.\npath = 1\nspath(c1, c2) (1)\nWhile the simplicity of path is appealing, it can be misleading when concepts are at different levels of specificity. Two very general concepts may have the same path length as two very specific concepts. (Wu and Palmer, 1994) introduce a correction to path that incorporates the depth of the concepts, and the depth of their Least Common Subsumer (LCS). This is the most specific ancestor two concepts share. In this measure, similarity is twice the depth of the two concept’s LCS divided by the product of the depths of the individual concepts (Equation 2). Note that if there are multiple LCSs for a pair of concepts, the deepest of them is used in this measure.\nwup = 2 ∗ depth(lcs(c1, c2))\ndepth(c1) + depth(c2) (2)\n(Zhong et al., 2002) take a very similar approach and again scale the depth of the LCS by the sum of the depths of the two concepts (Equation 3), where m(c) = k−depth(c). The value of k was set to 2 based on their recommendations.\nzhong = 2 ∗m(lcs(c1, c2))\nm(c1) +m(c2) (3)\n(Pekar and Staab, 2002) offer another variation on path, where the shortest path of the two concepts to the LCS is used, in addition to the shortest bath between the LCS and the root of the taxonomy (Equation 4).\npks = − log spath(lcs(c1, c2), root)∑\nx=c1,c2,root spath(lcs(c1, c2), x)\n(4)"

The effect of this is to assign rare (low probability) concepts a high measure of information content, since the underlying assumption is that more specific concepts are less frequently used than more common ones.\n(Resnik, 1995) modified this notion of information content in order to use it as a similarity measure. He defines the similarity of two concepts to be the information content of their LCS (Equation 7).\nres = IC(lcs(c1, c2) = − log(P (lcs(c1, c2))) (7)\n(Jiang and Conrath, 1997), (Lin, 1998), and (Pirró and Euzenat, 2010) extend res by incorporating the information content of the individual concepts in various different ways. Lin defines the similarity between two concepts as the ratio of information content of the LCS with the sum of the individual concept’s information content (Equation 8). Note that lin has the same form as wup and zhong, and is in effect using information content as a measure of specificity (rather than depth). If there is more than one possible LCS, the LCS with the greatest IC is chosen.\nlin = 2 ∗ IC(lcs(c1, c2))\nIC(c1) + IC(c2) (8)\nJiang and Conrath define the distance between two concepts to be the sum of the information content of the two concepts minus twice the information content of the concepts’ LCS. We modify this from a distance to a similarity measure by taking the reciprocal of the distance (Equation 9).

In this work we focus on corpus–based techniques.\nFor corpus–based information content, we estimate the probability of a concept c by taking the sum of the probability of the concept P (c) and the probability its descendants P (d) (Equation 11).\nP (c∗) = P (c) + ∑\nd∈descendant(c)\nP (d) (11)\nThe initial probabilities of a concept (P (c)) and its descendants (P (d)) are obtained by dividing the number of times each concept and descendant occurs in the corpus, and dividing that by the total numbers of concepts (N ).\nIdeally the corpus from which we are estimating the probabilities of concepts will be sense tagged. However, sense-tagging is a challenging problem in its own right, and it is not always possible to carry out reliably on larger amounts of text. In fact in this paper we did not use any sense tagging of the corpus we derived information content from.\nInstead, we estimated the probability of a concept by using the UMLSonMedline dataset. This was created by the National Library of Medicine and consists of concepts from the 2009AB UMLS and the counts of the number of times they occurred in a snapshot of Medline taken on 12 January, 2009. These counts were obtained by using the Essie Search Engine (Ide et al., 2007) which queried Medline with normalized strings from the\n2009AB MRCONSO table in the UMLS. The frequency of a CUI was obtained by aggregating the frequency counts of the terms associated with the CUI to provide a rough estimate of its frequency. The information content measures then use this information to calculate the probability of a concept.\nAnother alternative is the use of Intrinsic Information Content. It assess the informativeness of concept based on its placement within a taxonomy by considering the number of incoming (ancestors) relative to outgoing (descendant) links (Sánchez et al., 2011) (Equation 12).\nIC(c) = −log(\n|leaves(c)| |subsumers(c)| + 1 max leaves + 1 ) (12)\nwhere leaves are the number of descendants of concept c that are leaf nodes, subsumers are the number of concept c’s ancestors and max leaves are the total number of leaf nodes in the taxonomy."

He was able to perform word sense disambiguation by identifying the senses of words in a sentence with the largest number of overlaps between their definitions. An overlap is the longest sequence of one or more consecutive words that occur in both definitions. (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) extended this idea to WordNet, but observed that WordNet glosses are often very short, and did not contain enough information to distinguish between multiple concepts. Therefore, they created a super gloss for each concept by adding the glosses of related concepts to the gloss of the concept itself (and then finding overlaps).\n(Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) adapted this measure to second-order co-occurrence vectors. In this approach, a vector is created for each word in a concept’s definition that shows which words co–occur with it in a corpus. These word vectors are averaged to create a single co-occurrence vector for the concept. The similarity between the concepts is calculated by taking the cosine between the concepts second-order vectors. (Liu et al., 2012) modified and extended this measure to be used to quantify the relatedness between biomedical and clinical terms in the UMLS.\nThe work in this paper can be seen as a further extension of (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006; Liu et al., 2012)."

In particular we add the definitions of any concepts connected via a parent (PAR), child (CHD), RB (broader than), RN (narrower than) or TERM (terms associated with CUI)\n1http://mbr.nlm.nih.gov/Download/index.shtml\nrelation. All of the definitions for a term are combined into a single super–gloss. At the end of this process we should have two super–glosses, one for each term to be measured for relatedness.\nNext, we process each super–gloss as follows.\n1. We extract a first–order co–occurrence vector for each term in the super–gloss from the co–occurrence matrix created in the previous step.\n2. We take the average of the first order co– occurrence vectors associated with the terms in a super-gloss and use that to represent the meaning of the term. This is a second–order co–occurrence vector.\n3.

We evaluated our method on datasets that have been annotated for relatedness and similarity. The results show that using a combination of contextual information using the term pair’s definition and their pairwise semantic similarity scores derived from a taxonomy obtain a high correlation with human judgments for both similarity and relatedness. In the future, we plan to further explore combining this type of information to quantify the\nrelatedness and similarity between term pairs. In this work, we also explored using a threshold cutoff to include only those term pairs that obtained pre-specified similarity score. In the future, we plan to explore metrics to automatically determine the threshold cutoff appropriate given a dataset.

In this paper we extend these methods by embedding a measure of semantic similarity based on a human curated taxonomy into a second–order vector representation. This results in a measure of semantic relatedness that combines both the contextual information available in a corpus–based vector space representation with the semantic knowledge found in a biomedical ontology. Our results show that embedding semantic semantic similarity into a second order co–occurrence matrix improves correlation with human judgments for both similarity and relatedness.",
