      "text" : "Traditional image clustering methods take a two-step approach, feature learning and clustering, sequentially. However, recent research results demonstrated that combining the separated phases in a unified framework and training them jointly can achieve a better performance. In this paper, we first introduce fully convolutional auto-encoders for image feature learning and then propose a unified clustering framework to learn image representations and cluster centers jointly based on a fully convolutional auto-encoder and soft k-means scores. At initial stages of the learning procedure, the representations extracted from the auto-encoder may not be very discriminative for latter clustering. We address this issue by adopting a boosted discriminative distribution, where high score assignments are highlighted and low score ones are de-emphasized. With the gradually boosted discrimination, clustering assignment scores are discriminated and cluster purities are enlarged. Experiments on several vision benchmark datasets show that our methods can achieve a state-of-the-art performance.\nKeywords: image clustering, fully convolutional auto-encoder, representation learning, discriminatively boosted clustering\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier March 24, 2017\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n07 98\n0v 1\n[ cs"

      "text" : "Clustering methods are very important techniques for exploratory data analysis with wide applications ranging from data mining [1, 2], dimension reduction [3], segmentation [4] and so on. Their aim is to partition data points into clusters so that data in the same cluster are similar to each other while data in different clusters are dissimilar. Approaches to achieve this aim include partitional methods such as k-means and k-medoids, hierarchical methods like agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering, methods based on density estimation such as DBSCAN [5], and recent methods based on finding density peaks such as CFSFDP [6] and LDPS [7].\nImage clustering [8] is a special case of clustering analysis that seeks to find compact, object-level models from many unlabeled images. Its applications include automatic visual concept discovery [9], content-based image retrieval and image annotation. However, image clustering is a hard task mainly owning to the following two reasons: 1) images often are of high dimensionality, which will significantly affect the performance of clustering methods such as k-means [10], and 2) objects in images usually have twodimensional or three-dimensional local structures which should not be ignored when exploring the local structure information of the images.\nTo address these issues, many representation learning methods have been proposed for image feature extractions as a preprocessing step. Traditionally, various hand-crafted features such as SIFT [11], HOG [12], NMF [13], and (geometric) CW-SSIM similarity [14, 15] have been used to encode the visual information. Recently, many approaches have been proposed to combine clustering methods with deep neural networks (DNN), which have shown a remarkable performance improvement over hand-crafted features [16]. Roughly speaking, these methods can be categorized into two groups: 1) sequential methods that apply clustering on the learned DNN representations, and 2) unified approaches that jointly optimize the deep representation learning and clustering objectives.\nIn the first group, a kind of deep (convolutional) neural networks, such as deep belief network (DBN) [17] and stacked auto-encoders [18], is first trained in an unsupervised manner to approximate the non-linear feature embedding from the raw image space to the embedded feature space (usually being low-dimensional). And then, either k-means or spectral clustering or agglomerative clustering can be applied to partition the feature space. However, since the feature learning and clustering are separated from each\nother, the learned DNN features may not be reliable for clustering. There are a few recent methods in the second group which take the separation issues into consideration. In [19], the authors proposed deep embedded clustering that simultaneously learns feature representations with stacked auto-encoders and cluster assignments with soft k-means by minimizing a joint loss function. In [20], joint unsupervised learning was proposed to learn deep convolutional representations and agglomerative clustering jointly using a recurrent framework. In [21], the authors proposed an infinite ensemble clustering framework that integrates deep representation learning and ensemble clustering. The key insight behind these approaches is that good representations are beneficial for clustering and conversely clustering results can provide supervisory signals for representation learning. Thus, two factors, designing a proper representation learning model and designing a suitable unified learning objective will greatly affect the performance of these methods.\nIn this paper, we follow recent advances to propose a unified clustering method named Discriminatively Boosted Clustering (DBC) for image analysis based on fully convolutional auto-encoders (FCAE). See Fig. 1 for a glance of the overall framework. We first introduce a fully convolutional encoder-decoder network for fast and coarse image feature extraction. We then discard the decoder part and add a soft k-means model on top of the encoder to make a unified clustering model. The model is jointly trained with gradually boosted discrimination where high score assignments are highlighted and low score ones are de-emphasized. The our main contributions are summarized as follows:\n• We propose a fully convolutional auto-encoder (FCAE) for image feature learning. The FCAE is composed of convolution-type layers (convolution and de-convolution layers) and pool-type layers (pooling and un-pooling layers). By adding batch normalization (BN) layers to each of the convolution-type layers, we can train the FCAE in an end-toend way. This avoids the tedious and time-consuming layer-wise pretraining stage adopted in the traditional stacked (convolutional) autoencoders. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to learn a deep auto-encoder in an end-to-end manner.\n• We propose a discriminatively boosted clustering (DBC) framework based on the learned FCAE and an additional soft k-means model.\nWe train the DBC model in a self-paced learning procedure, where deep representations of raw images and cluster assignments are jointly learned. This overcomes the separation issue of the traditional clustering methods that use features directly learned from auto-encoders.\n• We show that the FCAE can learn better features for clustering than raw images on several image datasets include MNIST, USPS, COIL-20 and COIL-100. Besides, with discriminatively boosted learning, the FCAE based DBC can outperform several state-of-the-art analogous methods in terms of k-means and deep auto-encoder based clustering.\nThe remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. Some related work including stacked (convolutional) auto-encoders, deconvolutional neural networks, and joint feature learning and clustering are briefly reviewed in Section 2. Detailed descriptions of the proposed FCAE and DBC are presented in Section 3. Experimental results on several real datasets are given in Section 4 to validate the proposed methods. Conclusions and future works are discussed in Section 5."

      "text" : "Stacked auto-encoders [22, 23, 24, 17, 25, 26] have been studied in the past years for unsupervised deep feature extraction and nonlinear dimension reduction. Their extensions for dealing with images are convolutional stacked auto-encoders [27, 28]. Most of these methods contain a two-stage training procedure [26]: one is layer-wise pre-training and the other is overall finetuning. One of the significant drawbacks of this learning procedure is that the layer-wise pre-training is time-consuming and tedious, especially when the base layer is a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) rather than a traditional auto-encoder or when the overall network is very deep.\nRecently, there is an attempt to discard the layer-wise pre-training procedure and train a deep auto-encoder type network in an end-to-end way. In [29], a deep deconvolution network is learned for image segmentation. The input of the architecture is an image and the output is a segmentation mask. The network achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with analogous methods thanks to three factors: 1) introducing a deconvolution layer and a unpooling layer [30, 31, 32] to recover the original image size of the segmentation mask, 2) applying the batch normalization [33] to each convolution layer and each deconvolution layer to reduce the internal covariate\nshifts, which not only makes an end-to-end training procedure possible but also speeds up the process, and 3) adopting a pre-trained encoder on largescale datasets such as VGG-16 model [34]. The success of the architecture motivates us that it is possible to design an end-to-end training procedure for fully convolutional auto-encoders.\nClustering has also been studied in the past years based on independent features extracted from auto-encoders (see, e.g. [10, 18, 35, 36]). Recently, there are attempts to combine the auto-encoders and clustering in a unified framework [19, 40]. In [19], the authors proposed Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) that learns deep representations and cluster assignments jointly. DEC uses a deep stacked auto-encoder to initialize the feature extraction model and a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss to fine-tune the unified model. In [40], the authors proposed Deep Clustering Network (DCN), a joint dimensional reduction and k-means clustering framework. The dimensional reduction model is based on deep neural networks. Although these methods have achieved some success, they are not suitable for dealing with highdimensional images due to the use of stacked auto-encoders rather than convolutional ones. This motivates us to design a unified clustering framework based on convolutional auto-encoders."

The framework contains two parts: part I is a fully convolutional auto-encoder (FCAE) for fast and coarse image feature extraction, and part II is a discriminatively boosted clustering (DBC) method which is composed of a fully convolutional encoder and a soft k-means categorizer. The DBC takes an image as input and exports soft assignments as output. It can be jointly trained with a discriminatively boosted distribution assumption, which makes the learned deep representations more suitable for the top categorizer. Our idea is very similar to self-paces learning [9], where easiest instances are first focused and more complex objects are expanded progressively. In the following subsections, we will explain the detailed implementation of the idea."

      "text" : "Traditional deep convolutional auto-encoders adopt a greedy layer-wise training procedure for feature transformations. This could be tedious and time-consuming when dealing with very deep neural networks. To address this issue, we propose a fully convolutional auto-encoder architecture which can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Part I of Fig. 1 shows an example of FCAE on the MNIST dataset. It has the following features:\nFully Convolutional As pointed out in [27], the max-pooling layers are very crucial for learning biologically plausible features in the convolutional architectures. Thus, we adopt convolution layers along with max-pooling layers to make a fully convolutional encoder (FCE). Since the down-sampling operations in the FCE reduce the size of the output feature maps, we use an unpooling layer introduced in [29] to recover the feature maps. As a result, the unpooling layers along with deconvolution layers (see [29]) are adopted to make a fully convolutional decoder (FCD).\nSymmetric The overall architecture is symmetric around the feature layer. In practice, it is suggested to design layers of an odd number. Otherwise, it will be ambiguous to define the feature layer. Besides, fully\nconnected layers (dense layers) should be avoided in the architecture since they destroy the local structure of the feature layer.\nNormalized The depth of the whole network grows in log-magnitude as the input image size increases. This could make the network very deep if the original image has a very large width or height. To overcome this problem, we adopt the batch normalization (BN) [33] strategy for reducing the internal covariate shift and speeding up the training. The BN operation is performed after each convolutional layer and each deconvolutional layer except for the last output layer. As pointed out in [29], BN is critical to optimize the fully convolutional neural networks.\nFCAE utilizes the two-dimensional local structure of the input images and reduces the redundancy in parameters compared with stacked auto-encoders (SAEs). Besides, FCAE differs from conventional SAEs as its weights are shared among all locations within each feature map and thus preserves the spatial locality."

      "text" : "Once FCAE has been trained, we can extract features with the encoder part to serve as the input of a categorizer. This strategy is used in many clustering methods based on auto-encoders, such as GraphEncoder [18], deep embedding networks [35], and auto-encoder based clustering [36]. These approaches treat the auto-encoder as a preprocessing step which is separately designed from the latter clustering step. However, the representations learned in this way could be amphibolous for clustering, and the clusters may be unclear (see the initial stage in Fig. 2)).\nTo address this issue, we propose a self-paced approach to make feature learning and clustering in a unified framework (see Part II in Fig. 1). We throw away the decoder of the FACE and add a soft k-means model on top of the feature layer. To train the unified model, we trust easier samples first and then gradually utilize new samples with the increasing complexity. Here, an easier sample (see the regions labelled 2, 3 and 4 in Fig. 2) is much certain to belong to a specific cluster, and a harder sample (see the region 1 in Fig. 2) is very likely to be categorized to multiple clusters. Fig. 2 describes the difference between these samples at a different learning stage of DBC.\nThere are three challenging questions in the learning problem of DBC which will be answered in the following subsections:\n1. How to choose a proper criterion to determine the easiness or hardness of a sample?\n2. How to transform harder samples into easier ones?\n3. How to learn from easier samples?\n3.2.1. Easiness measurement with the soft k-means scores\nWe follow DEC [19] to adopt the t-distribution-based soft assignment to measure the easiness of a sample. The t-distribution is investigated in [37] to deal with the crowding problem of low-dimensional data distributions. Under the t-distribution kernel, the soft score (or similarity) between the feature zi (i ∈ 1, 2, . . . ,m) and the cluster center µj (j ∈ 1, 2, . . . , k) is\nsij ∝ ( 1 + ||zi − µj||2\nv\n)− v+1 2 (1)\ns.t. k∑ j=1 sij = 1\nHere, v is the degree of freedom of the t-distribution and set to be 1 in practice. The most important reason for choosing the t-distribution kernel is that it has a longer tail than the famous heat kernel (or the Gaussiandistribution kernel). Thus, we do not need to pay much attention to the parameter estimation (see [37]), which is a hard task in unsupervised learning."

      "text" : "We transform the harder examples to the easier ones by boosting the higher score assignments and, meanwhile, bring down those with lower scores. This can be achieved by constructing an underlying target distribution rij\nfrom sij as follows:\nrij ∝ sαij, α > 1 (2)\ns.t. k∑ j=1 rij = 1\nSuppose we can ideally learn from the soft scores (denoted as S) to the assumptive distribution (denoted as R) each time. Then we can generate a learning chain as follows:\nS(0) → R(0) = S(1) → R(1) = S(2) → · · · .\nThe following two properties can be observed from the chain: Property 1 If s\n(0) ij = s (0) ij′ for any j and j ′, then s (t) ij ≡ 1/k for all j and\nall time step t. Proof Under the condition, and by (2) we can deduce that r\n(0) ij ≡ r (0) ij′ . By\nthe chain this is equivalent to the fact that s (1) ij ≡ s (1) ij′ . Thus, the conclusion s (t) ij ≡ s (t) ij′ follows recursively for all t.\nProperty 2 If there exists an l such that s (0) il > max j 6=l s (0) ij , then\nlimit t→∞\ns (t) ij =\n{ 1 if j = l\n0 if j 6= l\nProof By (2) we have\ns (t) ij s (t) il = [s(t−1)ij s (t−1) il ]α = [s(t−2)ij s (t−2) il ]α2 = · · · = [s(0)ij s (0) il ]αt .\nBy the assumption s (0) il > max j 6=l s (0) ij , it is seen that s (0) ij /s (0) il < 1 for any j 6= l. On the other hand, since α > 1, we have limit t→∞ αt =∞. Thus,\nlimit t→∞\ns (t) ij s (t) il = limit αt→∞ [s(0)ij s (0) il ]αt = 0, ∀j 6= l.\nSince s (t) il is finite, we have limitt→∞ s (t) ij = 0, ∀j 6= l. Finally, with the constrains∑k\nj=1 s (t) ij = 1, we obtain\nlimit t→∞\ns (t) il = 1− ∑ j 6=l limit t→∞ s (t) ij = 1.\nProperty 1 tells us that the hardest sample (which has the equal probability to be assigned to different clusters) would always be the hardest one. However, in practical applications, there can hardly exist such examples. Property 2 shows that the initial non-discriminative samples could be boosted gradually to be definitely discriminative. As a result, we get the desired features for k-means clustering.\nNote that the boosting factor α controls the speed of the learning process. A larger α can make the learning process more quickly than smaller ones. However, it may boost some falsely categorized samples too quickly at initial stages and thus makes their features irrecoverable at later stages.\nBesides, it can be helpful to balance the data distribution at different learning stages. In [19], the authors proposed to normalize the boosted assignments to prevent large clusters from distorting the hidden feature space. This problem can be overcome by dividing a normalization factor nj = ∑m i=1 rij for each of the rij."

Therefore, it will\nnot be seriously treated in the learning process.

From the information theory point of view NMI can be interpreted as\nNMI(ĉ, c) = MI(ĉ, c)\nmax(H(ĉ),H(c))\nwhere H(c) is the entropy of c and NMI(ĉ, c) is the mutual information of ĉ and c.\nNetwork architectures Table 2 shows the network architecture of the encoder parts with respect to different datasets. The decoder parts are totally reversed by the encoder parts. We use max-pooling in all the experiments. The size of all the feature layers is 1× 1. No padding is used in the convolutional layers except for the USPS dataset whose padding size is 1.\nThe comparing methods To validate the effectiveness of FCAE and DBC, we compare them with the following state-of-the-art methods in terms of the k-means and deep auto-encoders based clustering.\n• KMS is the baseline method that applies the k-means algorithm on raw images.\n• DAE-KMS [19] uses deep auto-encoders for feature extraction and then applies k-means for later clustering.\n• AEC [36] is a variant of DAE-KMS that simultaneously optimizes the data reconstruction error and representation compactness.\nResults and analysis Table 3 summarizes the benchmark results on the MNIST dataset. The k-means method performs badly on raw images. However, based on the end-to-end trained FACE features, k-means can achieve comparative results compared with DAE-KMS which uses greedily layerwise trained deep auto-encoder features. Moreover, with an additional joint training, DBC outperforms FCAE-KMS and beats all the other comparing methods in terms of ACC and NMI.\nTables 4-6 show the benchmarks on USPS, COIL-20 and COIL-100, respectively. Similarly to the observations on the MNIST hand-writeen digits dataset, DBC outperforms FCAE-KMS by a large margin on the USPS handwritten digits dataset. On the COIL sets, DBC obtained a little better results than FCAE-KMS did.\nOn the hand-written digits datasets, the number of samples is much larger than the number of categories. This results in the distribution of the FCAE features to be closely related, and lots of ambiguous samples may occur. As a result, discriminatively boosting makes sense on these datasets. Thus, there is no doubt that DBC performs much better than FCAE-KMS. On the COIL sets, DBC takes little advantage of the discriminatively boosting procedure since the FCAE features are very helpful for clustering. Thus, there are very few ambiguous samples whose easiness needs to be boosted."

It is observed in [27] that the stacked convolutional auto-encoders trained on noisy inputs (30% binomial noise) and a max-pooling layer can learn localized biologically plausible filters. However, even without adding noise, the learned deconvolutional filters in our architectures are non-trivial Gabor-like filters which are visually the nicest shapes.

On the contrary, when the factor is set to be very large (α = 4), the learning process is very fast at the initial stages. However,\nthis could result in falsely boosting some scores of the ambiguous samples. As a consequence, the model learned too much from some false information so the performance is not so satisfactory. With a moderate boosting factor (α = 2), the ACC and NMI curves grow reasonably and progressively."

      "text" : "In DEC [19], the authors pointed out that the balance normalization plays an important role in preventing large clusters from distorting the hidden feature space. To address this issue, we compare three normalization strategies: 1) the constant normalization for comparison, that is, nj = 1, 2) the normalization by dividing the sum of the original soft assignment score per cluster, that is, nj = ∑ i sij, which is adopted in DEC, and 3) the normalization by dividing the sum of the boosted soft assignment score per cluster, that is, nj = ∑ i s α ij. Fig. 9(b) presents the value curves of ACC and NMI against the epoch with these settings. Initially, the normalization does not affect ACC and NMI very much. However, the constant normalization can easily get stuck at early stages. The normalization by dividing nj = ∑ i sij has certain power of preventing the distortion. Our normalization strategy gives the best performance compared with the previous methods. This is because our normalization directly reflects the changes of the boosted scores."

The comparison results are shown in Fig. 9(c). As illustrated in the figure, DBC performs greatly based on all the models even when the initialization model is randomly distributed. However, if the FCAE model is not sufficiently trained, the resultant DBC model will be suboptimal."

Besides, the visualization shows that the proposed learning algorithm can implement the idea proposed in Section 3.2. Some\nissues to be considered in the future include: 1) adding suitable constraints on FCAE to deal with natural images, and 2) scaling the algorithm to deal with large-scale datasets such as the ImageNet dataset."

However, recent research results demonstrated that combining the separated phases in a unified framework and training them jointly can achieve a better performance. In this paper, we first introduce fully convolutional auto-encoders for image feature learning and then propose a unified clustering framework to learn image representations and cluster centers jointly based on a fully convolutional auto-encoder and soft k-means scores. At initial stages of the learning procedure, the representations extracted from the auto-encoder may not be very discriminative for latter clustering. We address this issue by adopting a boosted discriminative distribution, where high score assignments are highlighted and low score ones are de-emphasized. With the gradually boosted discrimination, clustering assignment scores are discriminated and cluster purities are enlarged. Experiments on several vision benchmark datasets show that our methods can achieve a state-of-the-art performance.",
