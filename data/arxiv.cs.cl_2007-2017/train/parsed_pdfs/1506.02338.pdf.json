      "text" : "NLP systems seek to automate the extraction of useful information from sequences of symbols in human language. These systems encounter difficulty due to the complexity and sparsity in natural language. Traditional systems have represented words as atomic units with success in a variety of tasks (Katz, 1987). This approach is limited by the curse of dimensionality and has been outperformed by neural network language models (NNLM) in a variety of tasks (Ben-\nProceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Lille, France, 2015. JMLR: W&CP volume 37. Copyright 2015 by the author(s).\ngio et al., 2003; Morin & Bengio, 2005; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). NNLMs overcome the curse of dimensionality by learning distributed representations for words (G.E. Hinton, 1986; Bengio et al., 2003). Specifically, neural language models embed a vocabulary into a smaller dimensional linear space that models “the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations” (Bengio et al., 2003). The result is a vector space model (Maas & Ng, 2010) that encodes semantic and syntactic relationships and has defined a new standard for feature generation in NLP (Manning et al., 2008; Sebastiani, 2002; Turian et al., 2010).\nNNLMs generate word embeddings by training a symbol prediction task over a moving local-context window such as predicting a word given its surrounding context (Mikolov et al., 2013a;b). This work follows from the distributional hypothesis: words that appear in similar contexts have similar meaning (Harris). Words that appear in similar contexts will experience similar training examples, training outcomes, and converge to similar weights. The ordered set of weights associated with each word becomes that word’s dense vector embedding. These distributed representations encode shades of meaning across their dimensions, allowing for two words to have multiple, real-valued relationships encoded in a single representation (Liang & Potts, 2015).\n(Mikolov et al., 2013c) introduced a new property of word embeddings based on word analogies such that vector operations between words mirror their semantic and syntactic relationships. The analogy ”king is to queen as man is to woman” can be encoded in vector space by the equation king - queen = man - woman. A dataset of these analogies, the Google Analogy Dataset 1, is divided into two broad categories, semantic queries and syntactic queries. Semantic queries idenfity relationships such as “France is to Paris\n1http://word2vec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n02 33\n8v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n1 Ju\nn 20\nas England is to London” whereas syntactic queries identify relationships such as “running is to run as pruning is to prune”. This is a standard by which distributed word embeddings may be evaluated.\nUntil recently, NNLMs have ignored morphology and word shape. However, including information about word structure in word representations has proven valuable for part of speech analysis (Santos & Zadrozny, 2014), word similarity (Luong et al., 2013), and information extraction (Qi et al., 2014).\nWe propose a neural network architecture that explicitly encodes order in a sequence of symbols and use this architecture to embed both word-level and character-level representations. When these two representations are concatenated, the resulting representations exceed best published results in both the semantic and syntactic evaluations of the Google Analogy Dataset."

      "heading" : "2.1. Word-level Representations (Word2vec)",
      "text" : "Our technique is inspired by recent work in learning vector representations of words, phrases, and sentences using neural networks (Mikolov et al., 2013a;b; Le & Mikolov, 2014). In the CBOW configuration of the negative sampling training method by (Mikolov et al., 2013a), each word is represented by a row-vector in matrix syn0 and is concatenated, summed, or averaged with other word vectors in a context window. The resulting vector is used in a classifier syn1 to predict the existence of the whole context with the the focus term (positive training) or absence of other randomly sampled words in the window (negative sampling). The scalar output is passed through a sigmoid function (σ(z) = (1 + e(−z)), returning the network’s probability that the removed word exists in the middle of the window, without stipulation on the order of the context words. This optimizes the following objective:\nargmax θ ∏ (w,C)∈d p(w = 1|C; θ) ∏ (w,C)∈d′ p(w = 0|C; θ)\nwhere d represents the document as a collection of contextword pairs (w,C) and C is an unordered group of words in a context window. d′ is a set of random (w,C) pairs. θ will be adjusted such that p(w = 1, C; θ) = 1 for context-word pairs that exist in d, and 0 for random context-word pairs that do not exist in d′. In the skip-gram negative sampling work by (Mikolov et al., 2013a;b), each word in a context is trained in succession. This optimizes the following objective:\nargmax θ ∏ (w,c)∈d p(w = 1|c; θ) ∏ (w,c)∈d′ p(w = 0|c; θ)\nwhere d represents the document as a collection of contextword pairs (w, c) and c represents a single word in the context. Modeling an element-wise probability that a word occurs given another word in the context, the element-wise nature of this probability allows (2) to be an equivalent objective to the skip-gram objective outlined in (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Goldberg & Levy, 2014).\nReducing the window size under these models constrains the probabilities to be more localized, as the probability that two words co-occur will reduce when the window reduces which can be advantageous for words subject to short-windowed statistical significance. For example, currency symbols often co-occur with numbers within a small window. Outside of a small window, currency symbols and numbers are not likely to co-occur. Thus, reducing the window size reduces noise in the prediction. Words such as city names, however, prefer wider windows to encode broader co-occurrence statistics with other words such as landmarks, street-names, and cultural words which could be farther away in the document.\nNeither skip-gram nor CBOW explicitly preserve word order in their word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013a;b; Le & Mikolov, 2014). Ordered concatenation of syn0 vectors does embed order in syn1, but this is obfuscated by the fact that the same embedding for each word must be linearly compatible with the feature detectors in every window position. In addition to changing the objective function, this has the effect of cancelling out features that are unique to\nonly one window position by those in other window positions that are attempting to be encoded in the same feature detector dimension. This effect prevents word embeddings from preserving order based features. The other methods (sum, average, and skip-gram) ignore all order completely in their modeling and model only co-occurrence based probability in their embeddings."

The network architecture leverages the convolutional approach introduced in (Waibel et al., 1990) to produce local features around each character of the word and then combines them into a fixed-sized character-level embedding of the word. The character-level word embedding is then concatenated with a word-level embedding learned using word2vec.

Words are decomposed into morphemes using a morphological segmenter (Creutz & Lagus, 2007). Using the “morphemic vectors”, word-level representations are constructed for complex words. In the experiments performed by (Luong et al., 2013), word embeddings were borrowed from (Huang et al., 2012) and (Collobert et al., 2011). After conducting a morphemic segmentation, complex words were then enhanced with morphological feature embeddings by using the morphemic vectors in the RNN to compute word representations “on the fly”.

      "text" : "We propose a new neural language model called a Partitioned Embedding Neural Network (PENN). PENN improves upon word2vec by modeling the order in which words occur. It models order by partitioning both the embedding and classifier layers. There are two styles of training corresponding to the CBOW negative sampling and skip-gram negative sampling methods in word2vec, although they differ in key areas.\nThe first property of PENN is that each word embedding is partitioned. Each partition is trained differently from each other partition based on word order, such that each partition models a different probability distribution. These different probability distributions model different perspectives on the same word. The second property of PENN is that the classifier has different inputs for words from different window positions. The classifier is partitioned with equal partition dimensionality as the embedding. It is possible to have fewer partitions in the classifier than the embedding, such that a greater number of word embeddings are summed/averaged into fewer classifier partitions. This configuration has better performance when using smaller dimensionality feature vectors with large windows as it balances the (embedding partition size) / (window size) ratio. The following subsection presents the two opposite configurations under the PENN framework."

Closely related to the CBOW training method, the CLOW method models the probability that in an ordered list of words, a specific word is present in the middle of the list, given the presence and location of the other words. For each training example out of a windowed sequence of words, the middle focus term is removed. Then, a partition is selected from each remaining word’s embedding based on that word’s position relative to the focus term. These partitions are concatenated and propagated through the classifier layer. All weights are updated to model the probability that the presence of the focus term is 100% (positive training) and other randomly sampled words 0% (negative sampling)."

PENN skip-gram is almost identical to the CLOW method with one key difference. Instead of each partition of a word being concatenated with partitions from neighboring words, each partition is fed forward and back propagated in isolation. This models the probability that, given a single word, the focus term is present a relative number of words away in a given direction. This captures information lost in the word2vec skip-gram architecture by modeling based on the relative location of a context word in the window as opposed to an arbitrary location within the window.\nThe intuition behind modeling w and c based on j at the same time becomes clear when considering the neural architecture of these embeddings. Partitioning the context word into j partitions gives a location specific representation for a word’s relative position. Location specific representations are important even for words with singular meanings. Consider the word “going”, a word of singular meaning. This word’s effect on a task predicting a word immediately before it is completely different than predicting a word immediately after it. The phrase “am going” is a plausible phrase. The phrase “going am” is not. Thus, forcing this word to have a consistent embedding across these\ntasks forces it to convey identical information optimizing for nonidentical problems.\nPartitioning the classifier incorporates this same principle with respect to the focus word. The focus word will read features presented to it in a different light with a different weighting given its position. For example, “dollars” is far more likely to be predicted accurately based on the word before it; whereas, it is not likely to be predicted correctly by a word ten window positions after. Thus, the classifier responsible for looking for features indicating that “dollars” is next should not have to be the same classifier that looks for features ten window positions into the future. Training separate classifier partitions based on window position avoids this phenomenon."

A special case of this is the windowed embedding configuration, where every window position can be trained in full parallel and concatenated (embeddings and classifiers) at the end of training. This allows very large, rich embeddings to be trained on relatively small, inexpensive machines in a small amount of time with each machine optimizing a part of the overall objective function. Given machine j, training skip-gram under the windowed embedding configuration optimizes the following objective function:\nargmax θ\n( ∏\n(w,C)∈d\np(wj = 1|cjj ; θ)\n∏ (w,C)∈d′ p(wj = 0|cjj ; θ))\nConcatenation of the weight matrices syn0 and syn1 then incorporates the sum over j back into the PENN skip-gram objective function during the forward propagation process, yielding identical training results as a network trained in a single-threaded, single-model PENN skip-gram fashion.

They all share the same global error and continue on to the next iteration.\nA second, nontrivial optimization is found in the strong performance of the directional CLOW implementation with very small window sizes (pictured below with a window size of 1).

This clusters characters in an intuitive way, vowels with vowels, numbers with numbers, and capitals with capitals. In this way, character embeddings represent morphological building blocks that are more or less similar to each other, based on how they have been used.\nOnce character embeddings have been generated, interpolation may begin over a word of length I . The final embedding size must be selected as a multiple M of the character embedding dimensionalityC. For each character in a word, its index i is first scaled linearly with the size of the final “syntactic” embedding such that s = M * i / l. Then, for each length C position m (out of M positions) in the final word embedding vm, a squared distance is calculated relative to the scaled index such that distance d = pow(1-(abs(s - j)) / M ,2). The character vector for the character at position i in the word is then scaled by d and added elementwise into position m of vector v.\nA more efficient form of this process caches a set of transformation matrices, which are cached values of di,m for words of varying size. These matrices are used to transform variable length concatenated character vectors into fixed length word embeddings via vector-matrix multiplication.\nThese embeddings are useful for a variety of tasks, including syntactic word-analogy queries. Furthermore, they are useful for syntactic query expansion, mapping sparse edge cases of a word (typos, odd capitalization, etc.) to a more common word and its semantic embedding."

New syntactic vectors may be inexpensively generated for words never before seen, giving loss-less generalization to any word from initial character training, assuming only that the word is made up of characters that have been seen. Syntactic embeddings can be generated in a fully distributed fashion and only require a small vector concatenation and vector-matrix multiplication per word. Secondly, the character vectors (typically length 32) and transformation ma-\ntrices (at most 20 or so of them) can be stored very efficiently relative to the semantic vocabularies, which can be several million vectors of dimensionality 1000 or more. Despite their significant positive impact on quality, DIEM optimally performs using 6+ orders of magnitude less storage space, and 5+ orders of magnitude fewer training examples than word-level semantic embeddings."

Between tables 3 and 4, we see that increasing dimension-\n2https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/\nality of baseline CBOW word2vec past 500 achieves suboptimal performance. Thus, a fair comparison of two models should be between optimal (as opposed to just identical) parameterization for each model. This is especially important given that PENN models are modeling a much richer probability distribution, given that order is being preserved. Thus, optimal parameter settings often require larger dimensionality. Unlike the original CBOW word2vec, we have found that bigger window size is not always better. Larger windows tend to create slightly more semantic embeddings, whereas smaller window sizes tend to create slightly more syntactic embeddings. This follows the intuition that syntax plays a huge role in grammar, which is dictated by rules about which words make sense to occur immediately next to each other. Words that are +5 words apart cluster based on subject matter and semantics as opposed to grammar. With respect to window size and overall quality, because partitions slice up the global vector for a word, increasing the window size decreases the size of each partition in the window if the global vector size remains constant. Since each embedding is attempting to model a very complex (hundreds of thousands of words) probability distribution, the partition size in each partition must remain high enough to model this distribution. Thus, modeling large windows for semantic embeddings is optimal when using either the directional embedding model, which has a fixed partition size of 2, or a large global vector size. The\ndirectional model with optimal parameters has slightly less quality than the windowed model with optimal parameters due to the vector averaging occurring in each window pane."
