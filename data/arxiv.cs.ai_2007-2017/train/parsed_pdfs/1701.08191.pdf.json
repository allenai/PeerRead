      "text" : "The problem of association rules mining (ARM) (Agrawal et al, 1993) receives a lot of attention. This attention is motivated by several application domains such as market basket analysis, telecommunications analysis, Web logs analysis etc. Several ARM algorithms have been constructed to solve this problem (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994), (Savasere et al, 1995), (Zaki et al, 1997), (Pasquier et al, 1999), (Han et al, 2000). They compute association rules that describe a data set. Nevertheless, data sources are frequently updated. It follows that extracted rules describe a data set at a moment t, the mining moment. This change of data implies invalidation of rules and necessity to maintain them.\nSeveral algorithms of incremental maintenance have been proposed (Cheung et al, 1996), (Tsai et al, 1999), (Zhang et al, 1997); the first algorithm called FUP (Cheung et al, 1996) was achieved in 1996. These algorithms target maintenance of rule bases under the same support threshold. In this paper, we present IMSC, an algorithm of incremental maintenance after several updates (insertion of transactions). IMSC allows the user to change support threshold. This algorithm is based on Apriori (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994) that is oriented sparse databases such as transactional databases.\nGenerally, maintenance of association rules is achieved according to one of the two following approaches; incremental approach and non-incremental approach. Non-incremental maintenance consists in executing again an ARM algorithm on the whole updated data. The advantage of this method is the free choice of a new support threshold. Its drawback is ignoring old association rules making the operation more expensive. Incremental maintenance is the second approach. This method uses old association rules to compute new association rules. It’s faster in comparison with non-incremental maintenance. Nevertheless, its drawback is that maintenance is realized on the same initial extraction support threshold. The purpose of this\nwork is to develop an incremental maintenance algorithm under support threshold change. Our algorithm combines the advantages of the two maintenance approaches.\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we define the problem of association rule mining and maintenance, and in section 3 we present our algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is studied in section 4, and finally, conclusion and perspectives are given in section 5."

      "text" : "Let I be a set of n items, I= {i1, i2, i3,…., in}. Let BD be a database of D transactions with schema <tid,items>. Each transaction is included in I. An association rule is XY with X,Y I, X and X∩Y=ø. Rule support is the occurrence number of XY in BD, and its confidence is support(XY)/support(X). Given a minimum support threshold s% and a minimum confidence threshold c%, ARM problem (Agrawal et al, 1993) is to find out all association rules which support exceeds s% and confidence exceeds c%. An itemset is a set of items. It said to be frequent in BD if its support in BD (X.supportBD) exceeds s% (X.supportBD≥s×D), we say that is s-frequent in BD. The ARM problem may be reduced to the computation of frequent itemsets, because once we have frequent itemsets set, association rules generation will be straightforward.\nLet be F the set of the frequent itemsets in BD and s the support threshold under which F is extracted. After several updates of BD, an increment bd of d transactions is added to BD. The problem of incremental maintenance under support threshold change is to compute F’, the set of the frequent itemsets in BD’=BDbd according to a support threshold s’."

Let be an initial database BD (see figure 1), an increment bd and different values of s and s’. In the following, we execute IMSC to maintain F, i.e., to compute F’:\n First scenario : 0 < CPT ≤ d\nLet s=30%, then F is {A7, B5, C6, D4, AB4, AC4, BC4, CD3, ABC3}.\nLet bd be an increment of data containing the following transactions (each transaction is a doublet (Tid,\nItems)): {(11,ABD),(12,BD),(13,BCD)}, we have d=3.\nLet s’ =35%, candidate pruning threshold (cpt) is 2,55, it is the first scenario. We compute C1 and F1. F1={A8, B8, C7, D7} and C1=Ø. All items of F1 are inserted in F’1 because their supports in BD’ exceeds 0,35×13=4,55. C2 is calculated from F’1 via Apriori_gen function, we remove elements of F2 from C2: C2={AD,BD}. After a scan on bd, we get the supports in bd of candidate itemsets of size 2 ; C2={AD1,BD3} and the supports of frequent itemsets in BD’ ; F2={AB5, AC4, BC5, CD4}. We prune C2 and F2 according respectively to the thresholds 2,55 (cpt) and 4,55 (min_supp). C2={BD3}, F2={AB5, BC5}. Elements of F2 are added to F’2. Scan on BD is made to update the support of the itemset “BD”. Its support is 5, the itemset “BD” is inserted in F’2. F’2 = {AB5, BC5,BD5}. We go to level 3, C3=Ø, F3={ABC3}. While scanning bd, support of itemset “ABC” doesn't change, it’s rejected, F’3 will be empty and the algorithm stops.\n Second scenario : CPT ≤ 0\nLet s=50%, then F is {A7, B5, C6}.\nLet bd be a data increment of size d=3 containing the following transactions {(11,AB),(12,BC),(13,C)}.\nLet be s’ =25%, CPT is equal to -0,75. In this case, we are certain there is no loser itemsets; F is included in F’ (see lemma 2). After a scan of bd, we get C1=Ø, F1={A8, B7, C8}. Elements of F1 are inserted in F’1.Then a scan is achieved on BD. During this scan the items that are not in F1 and not in C1 are inserted in C1 because a non frequent item in BD according to s could be frequent in BD’ according to s’. C1={D4}. After pruning C1 according to support threshold 0,25×13=3,25, the only item of C1 is added to F’1, F’1={A8, B7, C8, D4}. C2 is generated from F’1; C2=Apriori_gen(F’1)-F2={AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD}. F2 being empty, the scan on bd is made to compute the supports of the elements of C2, then a scan on BD is achieved to update the supports of all itemsets of C2. C2={AB5, AC4, AD1, BC5, BD2, CD3}. After pruning C2 according to s’×(d+D)=3,25, we get C2={AB5, AC4, BC5}, the elements of C2 are inserted in F’2. Then, C3 is generated from F’2, we obtain C3={ABC}. After scanning bd and BD, the support of “ABC” in BD’ is 3, F’3=Ø and the algorithm stops.\n Third scenario : CPT > d\nLet s=30%, F is then {A7, B5, C6, D4, AB4, AC4, BC4, CD3, ABC3}.\nLet bd be a data increment containing the following transactions {(11,AB),(12,BC),(13,C)}, we have d=3.\nLet s’=40%, CPT is equal to 3,2 which is superior to d=3. In this case, there are no candidate itemsets. We must update the supports of elements of F, and to filter them. F’1={A8, B7, C8}. We go to second level since F’1 is not empty. F2={AB4, AC4, BC4, CD3} is updated while scanning bd, we have F2={AB5, AC4, BC5, CD3}. The pruning of F2 according to support threshold (=5,2) eliminates all its itemsets. F’2 being empty, the algorithm stops."

      "heading" : "4. PERFORMANCE STUDY",
      "text" : "In this section, we present experimentations achieved to test IMSC efficiency. We implemented IMSC and Apriori and we tested them on synthetic dataset T5.I2.D100k. Generation of synthetic dataset follows the same technique as (Agrawal et al, 1993).\nIn the first experimentation, we divided database in two partitions: BD that is constituted of 70K transactions and bd that is constituted of 30K transactions. The initial extraction is done on BD according to a support threshold of 30%. The set of the resulting frequent itemsets of this extraction is stored in F. Having BD, bd, s% and F, we executed IMSC to compute F’ under several maintenance support threshold going from 1% to 60%. In the same way, we executed Apriori on BD’ (= BDbd) under the same support\nthreshold interval and we placed the two algorithms curves on the same graphic. The result is shown in the following figure.\nIt is obvious that IMSC is faster than Apriori. Two reasons explain this fact. First, IMSC has in memory the initially frequent itemsets in BD and their supports. It needs to scan only bd to compute their supports in BD’. In contrast, Apriori scans all BD’ to compute their supports. Secondly, Apriori generates the candidates set Ck from F’k (Apriori_gen), whereas IMSC calculates Ck in the same way except that it eliminates the former frequent itemsets of it (Ck=Ck-Fk) and that it prunes it (Ck) according to CPT (Candidate Pruning threshold). This double pruning of Ck is done just after scaning the increment bd that is generally smaller than initial database BD.\nWe also tested IMSC performance for different increment sizes. We executed IMSC for two increments: D=70k, d=30k and s=30%, and D=70k, d=10k and s=30%. The following figure shows experimentation result. It is obvious that smaller increment is, faster IMSC is.\nThe two vertical lines of every curve delimit the three possible scenarios of our algorithm. For each curve, supports between the two lines make that CPT is between 0 and d. The supports on the left make CPT superior to d, and on the right those that make CPT lower to 0. We notice that when CPT is superior to d, the execution time is nearly null. When CPT is between 0 and d, more support increases, more the curve accelerates (the execution time accelerates), it is due to the return to the initial database. But this acceleration accentuates more in the last case, because of the heavier return to initial database.\nWe implemented our IMSC algorithm and we tested it against an ARM algorithm (Apriori). The results we obtained were expected; the incremental maintenance achieved by IMSC is faster than a new frequent itemsets extraction by an ARM algorithm, and IMSC curves have the same shape in which we distinguish the three maintenance scenarios."

      "heading" : "5. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES",
      "text" : "In this paper, we propose an incremental maintenance approach for the maintenance of association rule base after data source updating under support threshold change. This approach (IMSC) is Apriori like. Apriori is efficient for mining sparse databases (such as transactional databases). Many other ARM algorithms are more efficient when it is about correlated database (Pasquier et al, 1999), (Bastide et al, 2002). It’s interesting to develop methods for incremental maintenance under support threshold change based on these algorithms for correlated databases.\nWe also propose to integrate the incremental maintenance idea in inductive databases (Imielinski and Mannila, 1995), i.e., incremental pattern maintenance under several types of constraints and not only the antimonotone constraints such as for IMSC.\nMany algorithms use database vertical representation (Eclat (Zaki et al, 1997), Partition (Savasere et al, 1995) etc.); Support computation of candidate itemsets is done via tidlists intersection. These algorithms are deficient when databases are very large because of their memory need. However, in the maintenance problem, increment size is small. We think that using this strategy for itemset support computation should improve IMSC."

This solution allows user to maintain its rule base under any support threshold.",
