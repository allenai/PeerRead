      "text" : "Emotional intelligence is one of the key factors to the success of dialogue systems or conversational agents. In this paper, we propose Emotional Chatting Machine (ECM) which generates responses that are appropriate not only at the content level (relevant and grammatical) but also at the emotion level (consistent emotional expression). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. ECM addresses the factor in three ways: modeling high-level abstraction of emotion expression by embedding emotion categories, changing of implicit internal emotion states, and using explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary. Experiments show that our model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion."

      "text" : "In recent years, there has been a rising tendency in AI research to enhance Human-Computer Interaction by humanizing machines (Treur, 2007). However, to create a robot capable of acting and talking with a user at the human level requires the robot to understand human cognitive behaviors, while one of the most important human behaviors is expressing and understanding emotions and affects (Salovey and Mayer, 1990; Picard and Picard, 1997). As a vital part of human intelligence, emotional intelligence is defined as the ability to perceive, integrate, understand, and regulate emotions (Mayer and Salovey, 1997; Mayer et al., 2008). To create a machine capable to communicate with a user at\nthe human level, it is necessary to equip the machine with emotional intelligence.\nThere have been prior works on endowing dialogue systems or conversational agents with emotional intelligence, through text, facial expression, and other modalities (Andre et al., 2004; Ptaszynski et al., 2009; Skowron, 2010; Skowron et al., 2011). These studies showed that addressing the issue of emotional intelligence can enhance users performance (Partala and Surakka, 2004) and users satisfaction (Prendinger et al., 2005), and lead to less breakdowns in dialogues (Martinovski and Traum, 2003). Additionally, dialogue behaviors can be adjusted to the users emotional state (Polzin and Waibel, 2000), and systems can respond to users’ utterances both at the contentand affect-related levels (Skowron, 2010).\nHowever, these studies, mostly inspired by psychology findings, are either rule-based or limited to small-scale data, and not easily extensible to large-scale data. Recently, thanks to the advance of deep learning, large-scale conversation generation approaches have been investigated (Ritter et al., 2011; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Shang et al., 2015; Serban et al., 2016). Training on large scale data collected from social media or movie subtitles, most of these works aim to improve the content quality issues of conversation generation systems (Gu et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2016; Mou et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016a). However, to the best of our knowledge, the emotion factor has not been addressed in current large-scale conversation generation models. Table 1 shows some dialogue examples with/without emotions. We can see that our ECM model can be more emotionally empathic.\nIn this paper, we address the problem of generating emotional responses in conversational chatbots. We propose a model in the encoder-decoder framework of large-scale sequence-to-sequence\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n01 07\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nA pr\n2 01\n7\ngeneration that can respond to users emotionally. The central idea is to model emotion expressions in conversation generation with the following additional new mechanisms: a high-level abstraction of emotion expressions is considered through embedding emotion categories and feeding into the decoder; an internal memory module is used to implicitly model the change of the internal emotion state of the decoder; and the expression of an emotion is explicitly modeled by choosing a generic (non-emotion) or emotion word during decoding.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. To summarize, our contributions are as follows:\n• We propose an end-to-end framework to incorporate emotion influence in large-scale sequence-to-sequence conversation generation. Three novel mechanisms are proposed: emotion category embedding, an internal emotion memory, and an external memory.\n• We show that ECM can generate responses with higher naturalness and emotion intelligence than the traditional seq2seq model. We believe that future work such as empathetic computer agent and emotion interaction model can be carried out based on ECM."

Experiments in (Prendinger and Ishizuka, 2005) showed that an empathetic computer agent can contribute to a more positive perception of the interaction. In (Martinovski and Traum, 2003), the authors showed that many breakdowns could be avoided if the machine was able to recognize the emotional state of the user and responded to it sensitively. The work in (Polzin and Waibel, 2000) presented how dialogue behaviors can be adjusted to the users emotional state. Skowron (2010) proposed conversational systems, called affect listeners, that can respond to users’ utterances both at the content- and affect-related level.\nThese works, mainly inspired by psychological findings, are either rule-based, or limited to small data, making them difficult to apply to large-scale dialogue or conversation generation."

In (Ritter et al., 2011), statistical machine translation (SMT) was used to generate conversational responses from social media data. Due to the success of sequence-to-sequence generation models in machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014), these models were soon applied to conversation generation (Vinyals and Le, 2015), including the neural responding machine (Shang et al., 2015), the hierarchical recurrent encoderdecoder neural network (Serban et al., 2015), and many others (Sordoni et al., 2015).\nTo avoid generating meaningless and universal responses such as “I dont know”, Li et al. (2015) proposed the maximum mutual information (MMI) principle as an alternative to maximum likelihood estimation. Beam search was also extensively used to generate meaningful and diversified responses (Li et al., 2015, 2016b; Shao et al., 2017). Other attempts to improve content quality include incorporating into the decoder additional topic words (Xing et al., 2016; Mou et al., 2016), topic categories (Xiong et al., 2016), persona information (Li et al., 2016a), or other retrieved\nresponses (Song et al., 2016). Another path to avoid meaningless response is to apply deep reinforcement learning which can model the long-term delayed reward in chatbot’s dialogues (Li et al., 2016c; Ranzato et al., 2015). Dealing with unknown words can improve the generation quality too. Duplicating low-frequency words from post to response was proposed in (Gu et al., 2016).\nThese works have been done to improve the content quality generation, however, no work has addressed the emotion factor. Our work aims to generate responses both relevant in content and coherent in emotion."

The encoder and decoder of the seq2seq model (Sutskever et al., 2014) are implemented with GRU (Cho et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2014).\nThe encoder converts the post sequence X = (x1, x2, · · · , xn) to hidden representations h = (h1, h2, · · · , hn), which is briefly defined as:\nht = GRU(ht−1, xt) (1)\nDetails of GRU can be found in (Cho et al., 2014). The decoder takes a context vector ct and the embedding of a previously decoded word e(yt−1), and updates its state st using another GRU:\nst = GRU(st−1, [ct; e(yt−1)]) (2)\nwhere [ct; e(yt−1)] is concatenation of the two vectors, serving as input to the GRU network. The\ncontext vector ct is designed to dynamically attend on key information of the input post during decoding (Bahdanau et al., 2014). Formally, ct depends on the previous state of the decoder st−1:\nct = n∑\nk=1\nαtkhk (3)\nαtk = exp(etk)∑n j=1 exp(etj)\n(4)\netk = v > a tanh(Wast−1 + Uahk) (5)\nwhere αtk can be viewed as the similarity score between each hidden state hk of the post and the decoder’s state st−1.\nOnce the state vector st is obtained, the decoder generates a token by sampling from the output probability distribution ot computed from the decoder’s state st, as follows:\nyt ∼ ot = P (yt | y1, y2, · · · , yt−1, ct) (6) = softmax(Wost) (7)"

      "text" : "The problem we deal with in this paper is formulated as follows: Given a post X = (x1, x2, · · · , xn), and a user-specified emotion category e of the response to be generated, the goal is to generate a response Y = (y1, y2, · · · , ym) that is coherent with the emotion category e. Essentially, the model estimates the probability: P (Y |X, e) = ∏m t=1 P (yt|y<t,X, e). The emotion categories are {Anger, Disgust, Happiness, Like, Sadness, Other}, adopted from a Chinese emotion classification challenge task.1 In order to train our model, X/Y will be automatically annotated with emotion categories by an emotion classifier.\nBuilt upon the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) generation framework discussed in the previous section. Emotional Chatting Machine (ECM) generates an emotion expression using three mechanisms: First, since the emotion category is a highlevel abstraction of an emotion expression, ECM embeds the emotion category and takes the emotion category embedding as input to the decoder; Second, we assume that during decoding, there is an internal emotion state, and in order to model\n1The taxonomy comes from http://tcci.ccf.org.cn/confere -nce/2014/dldoc/evatask1.pdf\nthe implicit change of the state, ECM adopts an internal memory module; Last, explicit expression of an emotion is modeled through explicit selection of a common or emotion word by an external memory module.\nAn overview of ECM is given in Figure 1. The decoder has several inputs: the context vector c, and, the emotion embedding vector and the internal memory both indexed by the emotion category. After combined with an external memory module, the decoder obtains a probability distribution o (see Eq. 17) for response generation."

Each emotion category is represented by a realvalued, low dimensional vector. For each emotion category e, we randomly initialize the vector of the emotion category ve, and then learn the emotion category representations through training. The emotion category embedding ve, along with word embedding e(yt−1), and the context vector ct, are fed into the decoder to update the decoder’s state st:\nst = GRU(st−1, [ct; e(yt−1); ve]) (8)\nBased on st, the decoding probability distribution can be updated accordingly as Eq. 7 to generate the next token yt."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4.3 Internal Memory",
      "text" : "The method presented in the preceding section is rather static: the emotion category embedding will not change during the token generation process. We assume that there is an internal emotion state during the decoding process, and the state changes as the decoding process proceeds. Hence, we design an internal memory module to approach the emotion dynamics during decoding. We simulate the process as follows: there is an internal emotion state for each category before the decoding process starts; at each step of the decoding pro-\ncess, the emotion state decays by a certain amount; once the decoding process stops, the emotion state should decay to zero.\nThe detailed process of the internal memory module is illustrated in Figure 2. At each step t, the read gate grt takes as input the word embedding of the previously decoded word e(yt−1), the previous state of the decoder st−1, and the current context vector ct. The write gate gwt computes a write vector from the decoder’s state vector st. The read and write vector are then used to read from and write into the internal memory. Hence, the emotion state is erased by a certain amount (by gwt ) at each step. At the last step, the internal emotion state will decay to zero. This process is formally described as below:\ngrt = σ(W r g [e(yt−1); st−1; ct]) (9)\ngwt = σ(W w g st) (10) M Ir,t = g r t M Ie,t (11) M Ie,t+1 = g w t M Ie,t (12)\nwhere r/w denotes read/write respectively, and I means Internal. With the input of the previous target word e(yt−1), the previous state of the decoder st−1, the context vector ct, and the emotion state update M Ir,t, GRU outputs the current state st,\nst = GRU(st−1, [ct; e(yt−1);M I r,t]) (13)\nWith the state, the word generation distribution ot can be obtained with Eq. 7, and the next word yt can be sampled. After generating the next word, M Ie,t+1 is written back to the internal memory.\nIt is noteworthy that the write vector works as a DELETE operation to model the expression of an emotion in generation of a response, which is quite different from the ADD and DELETE operation used in previous memory networks (Meng et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2016; Perez and Liu, 2016)."

      "heading" : "4.4 External Memory",
      "text" : "In the internal memory module, the correlation between the change of the internal emotion state and choosing of a word is implicit and not directly observable. As most emotional responses contain emotion words such as lovely and awesome which indicate strong emotions compared to generic (non-emotion) words such as person and day, we propose an external memory model to model emotion expressions explicitly by assigning different generation probabilities to emotion\nwords and generic words. Thus the model can choose to generate words from a generic vocabulary or an emotion vocabulary (Xu et al., 2008).\nThe decoder with an external memory is illustrated in Figure 3. Given the current state of the decoder st, the emotion softmax Pe(yt = we) and the generic softmax Pg(yt = wg) are computed over the emotion vocabulary which is read from the external memory and generic vocabulary, respectively. The output gate got controls the weights of generating an emotion or a generic word. Finally, the next word yt is sampled from the next word probability, and the concatenation of the two weighted probabilities. The process can be formulated as follows:\ngot = σ(v > u st) (14)\nPg(yt = wg) = softmax(W o g st) (15) Pe(yt = we) = softmax(W o e st) (16)\not = P (yt) =\n[ (1− got )Pg(yt = wg)\ngotPe(yt = we)\n] (17)\nwhere got ∈ [0, 1] is a scalar to balance the choice between an emotion word we and a generic word wg, Pg/Pe is the distribution over generic/emotion words respectively, and P (yt) is the final word decoding distribution. Note that the two vocabularies have no intersection, and the final distribution P (yt) is a concatenation of two distributions."

Additionally, we apply two regularization terms: one\non the internal memory, enforcing that the internal emotion state should decay to zero at the end of decoding, and the other on the external memory, constraining the selection of an emotional or generic word. The loss on one sample < X,Y > (X = x1, x2, ..., xn, Y = y1, y2, ..., ym) is defined as: L(θ) = − m∑ t=1 ptlog(ot)− m∑ t=1 qtlog(g o t )+ ‖M Ie,m ‖ (18) whereM Ie,m is the internal emotion state at the last step m, got is the probability of choosing an emotion word or a generic word, and qt ∈ {0, 1} is the true choice of an emotion word or a generic word in Y .

Instead, we adopt perplexity to evaluate the model at the content level (whether the content is relevant and grammatical). To evaluate the model at the emotion level, we adopt the coherence between the expected emotion category (as input to the model)\nand the predicted emotion category of a generated response by the emotion classifier as mentioned in Section 5.2.\nWe compare the seq2seq model (Sutskever et al., 2014) as the baseline with our ECM models. The three options including emotion category embedding (Emb), internal memory (IMem), and external memory (EMem) are incrementally added to the basic model. In other words, EMem in the tables means all three options have been included. We choose the model with the best perplexity on the validation set to evaluate the two metrics of perplexity and coherence in the test set. To evaluate the performance of ECM models at the emotion level, we generate emotional responses using beam search and evaluate the emotion coherence of the top 5 responses for each model on the 1,000 test set.\nThe results are shown in Table 4. As it can be seen, the perplexity of our models is much lower than that of the seq2seq model; the emotion coherence is much higher correspondingly. Note that emotion coherence measures the agreement between the pre-specified emotion category and the predicted category by the emotion classifier, which may be influenced by the errors of the classifier. However, as shown in the table, better coherence is observed when more model options are incrementally added.\nAlthough the EMem model obtains the best performance in emotion coherence, the perplexity of this model is worse than the other two settings after incorporating the external memory. This may be due to the fact that the loss function of the EMem model is not only supervised on perplexity, but also on the selection of generic or emotion words (see Eq.18)."

Judges were asked to score each response in terms of naturalness and emotion (rating scale is 1,2,3), and also to state a preference between any two of the four systems. The naturalness is defined as whether the response could plausibly have been produced by a human and the emotion is defined as whether the emotion expression of a response is coherent and appropriate to the given emotion category. We test the same 500 posts extracted from the test set, for each setting of our models, we generate 2533 emotional responses, and additional 500 responses for the seq2seq model, which amounts to 8099 responses in total.\nThe results of human evaluation for the quality of response are shown in Table 5.

For low-valued EIPs such as < Happiness,Disgust > and < Happiness,Anger > as shown in last two lines of Figure 4, responses are less coherent to the emotion category due to the lack of training data and/or the errors caused by the emotion classifier./Users/tuxchow/Downloads/ZhouHaoACL2017 (arxiv)/acl2017.bib\nFigure 5 visualizes the emotion interaction patterns between post and response in the training\ndata whose label is made by our emotion classifier. The color darkness indicates the strength of an EIP. Each cell indicates an EIP, for instance, the cell of row 6 and column 2 indicates < Happiness,Like >. Frequent EIPs show that there exists a major responding emotion given the post emotion category. For instance, when a post expresses Happiness, the emotion of responses is typically Like. The diagonal patterns indicate emotional empathy which is a common type of emotion interaction. Note that class other has much more data than other classes (see Table 3), and thus EIP is biased to this class (the first column of Figure 5), which may be biased by the data and the errors of the classifier.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. ECM addresses the factor in three ways: modeling high-level abstraction of emotion expression by embedding emotion categories, changing of implicit internal emotion states, and using explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary. Experiments show that our model can generate responses appropriate not only in content but also in emotion.",
