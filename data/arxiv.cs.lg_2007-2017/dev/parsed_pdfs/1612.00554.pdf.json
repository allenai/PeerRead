      "text" : "Feature selection is a dimensionality reduction technique for a wide range of search problems. A common practice used in machine learning is to find subset of available features for a learning algorithm. The best subset contains the least number of dimensions that most contribute to accuracy [13]. Feature selection differs from standard dimensionality reduction. Both methods seek to reduce the number of attributes in the dataset, but a dimensionality reduction method does so by creating new combinations of attributes, where as feature selection methods includes and excludes attributes in the data without changing them.\nThe central premise when using a feature selection technique is that the data contains many features that are either redundant or irrelevant, and can thus be removed without incurring much loss of information [2]. Redundant features refer to those having information which is already contained in other features, while irrelevant features are those with no useful information related to the class variable. Feature selection mostly acts as a filter, muting out features that are not useful in addition to the existing features , and thus avoid over-fitting, speed up computation, or improve the interpretability of the results.\nFeature selection techniques can be broadly classified into two groups: classifier dependent (wrapper [12], embedded [14]) and classifier independent filter [11]. Classifier dependent methods exploit the label information as a measure to guide the feature selection process. Examples are Backward Elimination and Forward selection. In forward selection, variables are progressively incorporated into larger subsets, whereas in backward elimination one starts with the set of all variables and progressively eliminates the least promising ones [9]. The inherent advantage of this class of methods are that multi-collinearity issues are automatically handled. However, no prior knowledge about the actual relationship between the variables can be inferred.\nClassifier independent methods, on the other hand, define a scoring function between features and labels in the selection process. They are based only on general features like the correlation with the variable to predict. Filter methods suppress the least interesting variables and are particularly effective in computation time and robust to over-fitting. A very simple filter type feature selection algorithm is a basic correlation analysis [10], where only attributes which are correlated to the label are\n∗Authors contribute equally 0This work is supported by the NIH Grants #R41 GM116300, #R01 GM117594. 0Primary Contact: C.

Correlation analysis helps to identify these “features” right at the outset and allows a better understanding of how the attribute affects the predicted variable. However correlation table needs to be generated and collinear variables must be eliminate “by hand”.\nThe Mutual Information MI (also called cross entropy or information gain) is a widely used information theoretic measurement for the stochastic dependency of discrete random variables. MI based feature selection works similar to a standard correlation analysis, except that it is more robust when the variables are noisy or non-linearly related to the predicted or target variable. Heuristic greedy algorithms are adopted to find out the most relevant and least redundant feature at each step. Brown et al. [3] show that the redundant term should refer to conditional mutual information and summarizes a uniform framework for information theoretic feature selection. However, due to the computational cost, the joint probability density functions (pdf) are often approximated as multiplication of single variable distribution functions. This is based on two inconsistent independence assumptions in Gao et al. [8], which can be seen as first order approximation of Information Gain, leading to the miss of multi-way feature combinations. This feature independence assumption produces singleton feature elements, thereby failing to capture he joint MI gain over a collection of correlated variables. A higher order approximation is thus needed to counter this scenario and get a better comprehension of the inter-feature dependence.\nThe ICA (Independent Component Analysis) algorithm, based on infomax or maximum likelihood estimation, tries to represent an input vector x = (x1, x2, ..., xM )T as a linear combination of independent signal vector s = (s1, s2, ..., sM )T e.g. X = AS, where each xi and si represents a random variable and A is called the mixing matrix [4]. The connection between ICA algorithm and information theory has been well known for many years [16]. However, to our knowledge, most of work concerns extracting signal vector s by finding out the optimal unmixing matrix (W ∼ A−1), that can minimize the mutual information(MI) between si, which leads to large running time.\nTo address all these issues, this paper presents a feature selection method, termed Higher Order Feature Selection (HOFS). This integrates ICA to approximate the MI in higher order dimension. Instead of producing a single list of features, we provide several subsets of features that maximizes MI, giving better comprehension as to which features work best when selected together due to their underlying interdependent structure. This addresses Feature Ranking, by scoring the feature subsets based on their combined predictive power, which is a significant advantage over lower order models. Our model also considers simplifying the computational cost of calculating multi-variable MI using ICA. We compare the results of our experiments against well known feature selection algorithms on publicly available datasets. Observations show that we perform at par if not better than them in classification error and global MI captured using the subset of selected features, while keeping similar running times and computational complexity.\nRest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec. 2 sets up the basic framework of MI based feature selection approach with notations, definitions and prior work. Sec. 3 discusses the lo-order and ICA issues which we are trying to address in this paper. In Sec. 4, we introduce the proposed Higher Order Feature Selection (HOFS) approach with its computation analysis and running times. All experiments on publicly available real datasets and their comparison results are illustrated in Sec. 5. Experiments performed on synthetic data (numerical graphical models and heterogeneous feature models) for model checking are tabulated in Sec. 6. We conclude our findings and discuss some of the future problems that can be addressed in Sec. 7."

[8] discusses the inconsistency of these two assumptions. The independence assumption leads to the miss of multi-way feature combinations, because the interdependence between features is ignored.\nLet us look at a scenario where a lower order MI based feature selection algorithm would fail. For example, consider three random variables x1, x2, x3, where x1, x2 have the same pdf: p(x = 0) = 0.5 and p(x = 1) = 0.5, and p(x3 = 0) = 1. Let Y = x1 x2. In that case, I(x1 ∪ x2 : y) = 1, however, I(x1 : y) + I(x2 : y) = 0. Thus a lower order MI based algorithm should select x3, which is irrelevant to y and ignore the feature combination x1 ∪ x2, which fully defines y."

ΩVMI = {x1, x4, x5, x2, x6, x7, x3, x8, x9} and ΩHOFS = {{x1, x4, x5}, {x2, x6, x7}, {x3, x8, x9}}. Therefore, HOFS goes an extra step in showing which features are correlated to each other, which is not evident from VMI. Fig. 3c shows the plot of Information gain according to the generated model and as predicted by HOFS. We also show the Information gain by adding a new feature to the current selected subset in Table 6."

      "heading" : "6.2. Handling Non-Numerical Features",
      "text" : "To verify the effectiveness of the proposed HOFS for a non-/numerical feature selection, 1000 samples with 20 heterogeneous features and 5 classes were synthesized according to [21]. There were 4 groups of features and each group had 5 features of both numerical and non-numerical features, which are shown in Table 7. The class label can be described by the group of features. In Group I, F1, F2, F3 are non-numerical features which can explain class 1 - class 3. F4, F5 are numerical features which can explain class 4 and class 5. Here, F1 is the most prominent feature to classify the class label and there are redundancies within this group. Ideally, the selected feature subset should be {F1, F3, F5} or {F1, F4, F5}. If anyone of\nthese two subsets is selected, other features in this group are redundant. Group II contains 5 features which were generated by adding some bias to the related features in Group I. Group III contains 5 features which were generated by adding noise to the related features in Group I. Group IV contains 5 random attributes, which were uncorrelated with class label.\nVMI completely breaks down in this scenario and selects the features in linear order as ΩVMI = {F1, F2, . . . , F20}. The subsets produced are ΩHOFS = {{F1, F6, F2, F7}, {F9, F4, F14, F10, F5, F15}, {F3, F8}, {F11}, {F13}, {F12}, {F19}, {F20}, {F16}, {F17}, {F18}}. The first set {F1, F6, F2, F7} clearly separates classes 1 and 2 from the other classes, where F1, F6 separates class 1 from class 2. The next subset {F9, F4, F14, F10, F5, F15} segregates classes 3, 4 and 5 amongst themselves. Since F14, F15 were generated by randomly replacing 200 negative values with positive values in F4, F5 respectively, they group up in together side-by side in the selected subset. Hence HOFS preserves the underlying structure of the generated features in presence of heterogeneity and provides meaningful feature ranking. Fig. 4 shows the plot of Information gain according to the heterogeneous model and as predicted by HOFS."

      "heading" : "7. Conclusion",
      "text" : "Mutual Information (MI) defines a measurement of how informative the features are. Feature selection based on MI has been developed a lot over the past decade. However,the computation of global MI is a NP-Hard problem. Thus, most of those algorithms are forced to do a lower order estimation. We introduce an improved method (HOFS) to estimate the global MI by integrating incremental ICA algorithm. Our method clearly performs better than most owing to its ability to select feature subsets that jointly maximize MI, while keeping similar running times and computational complexity as the current\napproaches. We would like to extend our work to provide minimal cardinality feature subsets for a wide range of datasets including geometric and hyperspectral."

    "abstractText" : "Feature selection is a process of choosing a subset of relevant features so that the quality of prediction models can be improved. An extensive body of work exists on information-theoretic feature selection, based on maximizing Mutual Information (MI) between subsets of features and class labels. The prior methods use a lower order approximation, by treating the joint entropy as a summation of several single variable entropies. This leads to locally optimal selections and misses multi-way feature combinations. We present a higher order MI based approximation technique called Higher Order Feature Selection (HOFS). Instead of producing a single list of features, our method produces a ranked collection of feature subsets that maximizes MI, giving better comprehension (feature ranking) as to which features work best together when selected, due to their underlying interdependent structure. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than existing feature selection approaches while keeping similar running times and computational complexity.",
