The problem statement of this research can be summarized as follows. Spike train generation assumes that spiking statistics is Poisson, but real data violates this assumption [18]. To capture non-Poissonian features, in order to fix the inevitable inherent irregularity, researchers rescale the time axis with tedious computational overhead ([19], [20] ) instead of searching for another distribution! We claim that we get the best model of spike train modeling and generation based on the following notice. From equation (1) we notice that memristance value is multiples of initial resistance. This reminds us with the foundations of quantum mechanics, when Planck found that atoms in a heated solid had energies that were multiples of a fixed amount, called a quantum [22]. Bohr explained the line spectrum of hydrogen, as in the energy diagram [22], shown in figure 1.\nWe try to quantize resistance, as done with energy. First we review Planck curve for blackbody radiation. Then we propose the quantization equations. Investigation shows how this perfectly models the neuron spiking, with the introduction of a new term called Tyke."

That is about 300 points. We use a simple performance measure of counting the matched points. On average we have 280 matched points. This is over 97% match of the curve points, as shown in figure 4.\nFuture work has many dimensions. One possible direction is answering the question: What is the relation between the class of problems solved by the current model and the class of problems solved by chaotic stochastic models? If the two classes are equivalent or there is a mapping between them, there would be no need to hybridize neural network with fuzzy sets, rough sets, or chaos. Another future work direction is investigating how to exploit other quantum physics equations, such as Wien's. Wien proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object, which was correct at high frequencies (short wavelength) but not at low frequencies (long wavelength) [21]. Finally, a direction is to seek an optimal learning rule the spiking neuron model, to enhance operation of artificial neural networks."

    "abstractText" : "Modeling spike firing assumes that spiking statistics is Poisson, but real data violates this assumption. To capture non-Poissonian features, in order to fix the inevitable inherent irregularity, researchers rescale the time axis with tedious computational overhead instead of searching for another distribution! Spikes or action potentials are precisely-timed changes in the ionic transport through synapses adjusting the synaptic weight, successfully modeled and developed as a memristor. Memristance value is multiples of initial resistance. This reminds us with the foundations of quantum mechanics. We try to quantize potential and resistance, as done with energy. After reviewing Planck curve for blackbody radiation, we propose the quantization equations. We introduce and prove a theorem that quantizes the resistance. Then we define the tyke showing its basic characteristics. Finally we give the basic transformations to model spiking and link an energy quantum to a tyke. Investigation shows how this perfectly models the neuron spiking., with over 97% match. All MATLA codes used are supplemented in the appendix.",
