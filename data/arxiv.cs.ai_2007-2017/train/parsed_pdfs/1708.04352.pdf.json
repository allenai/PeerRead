      "text" : "Multitask learning involves training a single agent in a lifelong context across a series of tasks. When tasks share similar characteristics, there is potential for the learning agent to reuse information, potentially achieving greater performance or learning more rapidly on down-stream tasks than would be possible by learning each task from scratch.\nThe promise of multitask learning has been previously demonstrated in several contexts. It has been shown that transfer learning on multiple related tasks improves the ability of the agent to learn a larger variety of domains while using less training data overall (Thrun, 1996). This naturally renders the agent more applicable to real-world scenarios. Additionally, by training on multiple tasks, the agent can exploit common traits to gain efficiency and generalize to unseen tasks (Caruana, 1998; Murugesan et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2016).\n1McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Copyright 2017 by the author(s).\nFigure 1. Example environments: 2D navigation task, with several sample paths (top-left). Hopper with a wall (top-right). Walker2d with big (bottom-right) and small (bottom-left) feet.\nIn discrete domains, several works have investigated the transferring of playing knowledge acquired between various Atari games. It is intuitive that there should be some knowledge transfer between Atari games (Breakout and Pong are similar in catching a ball; DemonAttack, Carnaval, Assault, and AirRaid share a goal in shooting upwards to destroy enemies). However, despite several authors’ attempts to demonstrate multitask learning in both Atari tasks and the DeepMind Lab Labyrinth (Parisotto et al., 2015; Rusu et al., 2015; Jaderberg et al., 2016), this task that has yet to be convincingly solved. Atari videogames therefore stand as a useful benchmark which can be used to induce further progress in multitask, transfer and lifelong learning in discrete domains. On the contrary, in continuous domains, each approach for continuous domain multitask learning has utilized a unique set of environments with little mutual overlap. As such, there is a need for such open-source standard benchmarks.\nThis problem is one that has been recognized by other research groups. Particularly, OpenAI lists the need for benchmark environments and investigation of multitask learning in continuous domains in a request for research1. As they mention, the current OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016) environments do not share enough characteristics to likely pose as effective multitask or lifelong learn-\n1See: https://openai.com/requests-for-research/ #multitask-rl-with-continuous-actions\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n04 35\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 4\nA ug\n2 01\n7\ning benchmarks. The contribution of this work is a set of benchmark environments that are suitable to evaluate continuous domain multitask learning. Our environments are constructed using an expandable software framework built on top of OpenAI Gym. Here, we show over 50 new environment variations (spread among 12 broad groups of variation types) for challenging new continuous domain tasks. We verify the utility of these environments for evaluating multitask learning by reporting the performance of a wellknown reinforcement learning algorithm on our multitask benchmark environments as a simple baseline."

We emit ray-beams from the torso of the runner for the measurements (with an arc of 90 degrees, 10 beams, a maximum sensing distance of 10 meters, and readouts normalized to a range of [0, 1]). We provide the usual running tasks with the sensor perception enabled (with no readings since there is no wall), and extra environments with a wall set in the path of the agent at a location drawn from a uniform distribution from 1.8 to 3.8 meters ahead of the agent’s start location."

      "heading" : "3.2. 2D Navigation",
      "text" : "We also provide several novel 2D environments that focus on navigation tasks with continuous action spaces to enable benchmarking of learning tasks requiring an implicit memory. The tasks take place in a given occupancy grid map, similar to (Tamar et al., 2016). We opt to make the layout and shape of the obstacles as the only disambiguating feature for localizing within the map. Aside from that information, the environment does not have any texture mapping or other distinctive features.\nWe provide three different types of navigation tasks, increasing in level of difficulty:\n• Image-based navigation where the agent has access to the entire map, including its own position within the map and the destination in the map as part of the image data.\n• State-based navigation, where the agent has access to its own position in the map and the distance and bearing to the closest obstacle. A simpler version also contains the destination coordinates.\n• Navigation based only on local range-and-bearing data around the agent using ray-tracing. It has to perform mapping and estimate its own position within the map (i.e. perform SLAM), while at the same time exploring to find the goal location, and learning to avoid obstacles. We also modify this with a simpler version, where the goal and current position are known as well.\nWe provide a reward of -1 for every timestep, -5 for obstacle collisions, and +10 for reaching the goal (which also ends the task, similarly to the MountainCar-v0 environment in OpenAI Gym). The action space is the bounded velocity to apply in the x and y directions."

      "heading" : "5. Baseline Experiments",
      "text" : "We develop a basic experiment to run on the aforementioned groupings of the environments to demonstrate learning on a series of multiple similar tasks consecutively. We then evaluate the generalized performance across all of the environments using the final learned policy. For an initial baseline, we simply run the RLLab (Duan et al., 2016) implementation of Trust Region Policy Optimization (Schulman et al., 2015) (TRPO) using an identical policy network to (Gu et al., 2016)7. We train the same policy consecutively on each environment in a group in the same order as listed in Section 4. After having trained on a specific environment, we evaluate the current policy on that environ-\n6 {BaseRunningEnv} denotes one of the OpenAI Gym environments from: Humanoid, Hopper, Walker2d, HalfCheetah with {GravityVariation} from {Half, ThreeQuarters, OneAndQuarter, OneAndHalf}.\n7Size 100, 50, 25 hidden layers with rectified linear activations and a tanh output activation, and hyperparameters: step-size, 0.01; GAE lambda, 1.0; regularization coefficient, 1.0 · 10−5; number of epochs, 1000; batch size, 50000\nment by running 20 sample rollouts. We then train on the next environment in the group, starting from that same policy. We finally evaluate the reward across 20 sample rollouts on each environment in a group using the final learned policy (which by then has been trained on every variation of the environment). While this isn’t an explicit multitask learning approach, this provides basic insights (using a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm) into forward transfer and generalization of a policy on these task groupings.\nOur baseline experiment results are found in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4. In the case of modified Hopper tasks, modifying gravity and body part size has a profound effect on the system dynamics. As a result, we see that catastrophic forgetting (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989) in the policy prevents generalization to earlier tasks. This can be seen in Tables 1 and 2. First, when evaluating the final policy on all of the previously trained environments (the “Fully Trained” column), performance decreases monotonically as we move backwards over the environments. Additionally, immediately after training on the earlier environments (the “After Env Training” column), the performance on the sample rollouts is much higher than that of the final policy (which has seen all the environments). This indicates that this group of environments are good indicators for demonstrating and overcoming catastrophic forgetting in multitask learning.\nIn other environment variations (modified HalfCheetah and Walker2d environments), the agent’s final policy outperforms both training from scratch (as in Table 1) and the ‘After Env Training” result (as in Tables 1 and 2), which is evidence of positive forward transfer. The dynamics of these environment are not significantly perturbed by changes in physics, as the models have inherent stability. There remains significant room for future improvement upon our baseline. Future methods may achieve more efficient forward transfer between sequential environments. Furthermore, generalization across multiple tasks may come at a cost of higher variance in the policy (e.g. in Walker2d environments here). Future improvements may also focus on generalization with constrained variance across trials (and thus higher safety when learning on new environments).\nFor the Humanoid-exclusive variations and Wall variations (as in Tables 2 and 3), TRPO is not able to learn a policy which can jump over a wall or learn a good policy on Humanoid tasks in the small number of iterations which we ran (1000 iterations). The results we see are on a comparable scale to (Duan et al., 2016).\nIn our new map navigation tasks, rewards remain at -1000, which is the initial lowest reward. That is, the agent never learns to find the goal using our default parameters and TRPO. This is to be expected as TRPO may not be suited for such a navigation task which requires large amounts of\nexploration with an extremely delayed reward. Other methods which encourage principled exploration and have a memory component to the policy may be more suitable for such tasks. We nevertheless share these environments with the community in an effort to drive investigation into creating complex policies for simultaneous localization, exploration and goal searching in settings where goals and obstacles vary between tasks."

      "text" : "Our initial release investigates adding flexibility to standard OpenAI gym MuJoCo environments: modifying gravity, adding sensor readouts and a random wall obstacle, perturbing body-part sizes, and adding random goal/start state positions for arm environments. We also add an original set of environments for learning policies in continuous navigation tasks. In future releases we also plan to add standard environments for: adding motor noise, arm environments where the end-goal position has a velocity (such that the arm must track the target), and making the sensor-based environments more realistic (and thus more transferable to real-world systems)."

In discrete domains, performance on the Atari game suite has emerged as the de facto benchmark for assessing multitask learning. However, in continuous domains there is a lack of agreement on standard multitask evaluation environments which makes it difficult to compare different approaches fairly. In this work, we describe a benchmark set of tasks that we have developed in an extendable framework based on OpenAI Gym. We run a simple baseline using Trust Region Policy Optimization and release the framework publicly to be expanded and used for the systematic comparison of multitask, transfer, and lifelong learning in continuous domains.",
