In this paper, we particularly consider generating Japanese captions for images. Since most available caption datasets have been constructed for English language, there are few datasets for Japanese. To tackle this problem, we construct a large-scale Japanese image caption dataset based on images from MS-COCO, which is called STAIR Captions. STAIR Captions consists of 820,310 Japanese captions for 164,062 images. In the experiment, we show that a neural network trained using STAIR Captions can generate more natural and better Japanese captions, compared to those generated using English-Japanese machine translation after generating English captions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 May 2017 07:07:55 GMT  (1701kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00823v1", "Accepted as ACL2017 short paper. 5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as ACL2017 short paper. 5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["yuya yoshikawa", "yutaro shigeto", "akikazu takeuchi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.00823"}
