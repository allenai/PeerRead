      "text" : "With more than one hundred thousand new scholarly articles being published each year, there is a rapid growth in the number of citations for the relevant scientific articles. In this context, we highlight the following interesting facts about the process of citing scientific articles: (i) the most commonly cited paper by Gerard Salton, titled “A Vector Space Model for Information Retrieval” (alleged to have been published in 1975) does not actually exist in reality (Dubin, 2004), (ii) the scientific authors read only 20% of the works they cite (Simkin and Roychowdhury, 2003), (iii) one third of\nthe references in a paper are redundant and 40% are perfunctory (Moravcsik and Murugesan, 1975), (iv) 62.7% of the references could not be attributed a specific function (definition, tool etc.) (Teufel et al., 2006). Despite these facts, the existing bibliographic metrics consider that all citations are equally significant.\nIn this paper, we would emphasize the fact that all the references of a paper are not equally influential. For instance, we believe that for our current paper, (Wan and Liu, 2014) is more influential reference than (Garfield, 2006), although the former has received lower citations (9) than the latter (1650) so far1. Therefore the influence of a cited paper completely depends upon the context of the citing paper, not the overall citation count of the cited paper. We further took the opinion of the original authors of few selective papers and realized that around 16% of the references in a paper are highly influential, and the rest are trivial (Section 4). This motivates us to design a prediction model, GraLap to automatically label the influence of a cited paper with respect to a citing paper. Here, we label paper-reference pairs rather than references alone, because a reference that is influential for one citing paper may not be influential with equal extent for another citing paper.\nWe experiment with ACL Anthology Network (AAN) dataset and show that GraLap along with the novel feature set, quite efficiently, predicts the intensity of references of papers, which achieves (Pearson) correlation of 0.90 with the human anno-\n1The statistics are taken from Google Scholar on June 2, 2016.\ntations. Finally, we present four interesting applications to show the efficacy of considering unequal intensity of references, compared to the uniform intensity.\nThe contributions of the paper are four-fold: (i) we acquire a rich annotated dataset where paperreference pairs are labeled based on the influence scores (Section 4), which is perhaps the first goldstandard for this kind of task; (ii) we propose a graph-based label propagation model GraLap for semi-supervised learning which has tremendous potential for any task where the training set is less in number and labels are non-uniformly distributed (Section 3); (iii) we propose a diverse set of features (Section 3.3); most of them turn out to be quite effective to fit into the prediction model and yield improved results (Section 5); (iv) we present four applications to show how incorporating the reference intensity enhances the performance of several stateof-the-art systems (Section 6)."

      "text" : "All the references of a paper usually do not carry equal intensity/strength with respect to the citing paper because some papers have influenced the research more than others. To pin down this intuition, here we discretize the reference intensity by numerical values within the range of 1 to 5, (5: most influential, 1: least influential). The appropriate definitions of different labels of reference intensity are presented in Figure 1, which are also the basis of building the annotated dataset (see Section 4):\nNote that “reference intensity” and “reference similarity” are two different aspects. It might happen that two similar reference are used with different intensity levels in a citing paper – while one is just mentioned somewhere in the paper and other is used as a baseline. Here, we address the former problem as a semi-supervised learning problem with clues taken from content of the citing and cited papers."

      "heading" : "3.1 Problem Definition",
      "text" : "We are given a set of papers P = {P1, P2, ..., PM} and a sets of references R = {R1, R2, ..., RM}, where Ri corresponds to the set of references (or cited papers) of Pi. There is a set of papers PL ∈ P whose references RL ∈ R are already labeled by ℓ ∈ L = {1, ..., 5} (each reference is labeled with exactly one value). Our objective is to define a predictive function f that labels the references RU ∈ {R \\ RL} of the papers PU ∈ {P \\ PL} whose reference intensities are unknown, i.e., f : (P,R, PL, RL, PU , RL) −→ L.\nSince the size of the annotated (labeled) data is much smaller than unlabeled data (|PL| ≪ |PU |), we consider it as a semi-supervised learning problem.\nDefinition 1. (Semi-supervised Learning) Given a set of entries X and a set of possible labels YL, let us assume that (x1, y1), (x2, y2),..., (xl, yl) be the set of labeled data where xi is a data point and yi ∈ YL is its corresponding label. We assume that at least one instance of each class label\nis present in the labeled dataset. Let (xl+1, yl+1), (xl+2, yl+2),..., (xl+n, yl+u) be the unlabeled data points where YU = {yl+1, yl+2, ...yl+u} are unknown. Each entry x ∈ X is represented by a set of features {f1, f2, ..., fD}. The problem is to determine the unknown labels using X and YL.\n3.2 GraLap: A Prediction Model\nWe propose GraLap, a variant of label propagation (LP) model proposed by (Zhu et al., 2003) where a node in the graph propagates its associated label to its neighbors based on the proximity. We intend to assign same label to the vertices which are closely connected. However unlike the traditional LP model where the original values of the labels continue to fade as the algorithm progresses, we systematically handle this problem in GraLap. Additionally, we follow a post-processing in order to handle “classimbalance problem”. Graph Creation. The algorithm starts with the creation of a fully connected weighted graph G = (X,E) where nodes are data points and the weight wij of each edge eij ∈ E is determined by the radial basis function as follows:\nwij = exp\n(\n−\n∑D\nd=1(x d i − x d j ) 2\nσ2\n)\n(1)\nThe weight is controlled by a parameter σ. Later in this section, we shall discuss how σ is selected. Each node is allowed to propagate its label to its neighbors through edges (the more the edge weight, the easy to propagate). Transition Matrix. We create a probabilistic transition matrix T|X|×|X|, where each entry Tij indicates the probability of jumping from j to i based on the following: Tij = P (j → i) =\nwij∑|X| k=1 wkj .\nLabel Matrix. Here, we allow a soft label (interpreted as a distribution of labels) to be associated with each node. We then define a label matrix Y|X|×|L|, where ith row indicates the label distribution for node xi. Initially, Y contains only the values of the labeled data; others are zero. Label Propagation Algorithm. This algorithm works as follows:\nAfter initializing Y and T , the algorithm starts by disseminating the label from one node to its neighbors (including self-loop) in one step (Step 3). Then we normalize each entry of Y by the sum of its cor-\n1: Initialize T and Y 2: while (Y does not converge) do 3: Y ← TY 4: Normalize rows of Y , yij =\nyij∑ k yik\n5: Reassign original labels to XL\nresponding row in order to maintain the interpretation of label probability (Step 4). Step 5 is crucial; here we want the labeled sources XL to be persistent. During the iterations, the initial labeled nodes XL may fade away with other labels. Therefore we forcefully restore their actual label by setting yil = 1 (if xi ∈ XL is originally labeled as l), and other entries (∀j 6=lyij) by zero. We keep on “pushing” the labels from the labeled data points which in turn pushes the class boundary through high density data points and settles in low density space. In this way, our approach intelligently uses the unlabeled data in the intermediate steps of the learning. Assigning Final Labels. Once YU is computed, one may take the most likely label from the label distribution for each unlabeled data. However, this approach does not guarantee the label proportion observed in the annotated data (which in this case is not well-separated as shown in Section 4). Therefore, we adopt a label-based normalization technique. Assume that the label proportions in the labeled data are c1, ..., c|L| (s.t. ∑|L| i=1 ci = 1). In case of YU , we try to balance the label proportion observed in the ground-truth. The label mass is the column sum of YU , denoted by YU.1 , ..., YU.|L| , each of which is scaled in such a way that YU.1 : ... : YU.|L| = c1 : ... : c|L|. The label of an unlabeled data point is finalized as the label with maximum value in the row of Y . Convergence. Here we briefly show that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge. Let us combine Steps 3 and 4 as Y ← T̂ Y , where T̂ = Tij/ ∑\nk Tik. Y is composed of YLl×|L| and YUu×|L| , where YU never changes because of the reassignment. We can split T̂ at the boundary of labeled and unlabeled data as follows:\nF̂ =\n[\nT̂ll T̂lu T̂ul T̂uu\n]\nTherefore, YU ← T̂uuYU+ T̂ulYL, which can lead to YU = limn→∞ T̂ nuuY 0 + [ ∑n i=1 T̂ (i−1) uu ]T̂ulYL, where Y 0 is the shape of Y at iteration 0. We need\nto show T̂ nuuijY 0 ← 0. By construction, T̂ij ≥ 0, and since T̂ is row-normalized, and T̂uu is a part of T̂ , it leads to the following condition: ∃γ < 1,\n∑u j=1 T̂uuij ≤ γ, ∀i = 1, ..., u. So,\n∑\nj\nT̂nuuij = ∑\nj\n∑\nk\nT̂ (n−1) uuik T̂uukj\n= ∑\nk\nT̂ (n−1) uuik\n∑\nj\nT̂uuik\n≤ ∑\nk\nT̂ (n−1) uuik γ\n≤ γn\nTherefore, the sum of each row in T̂ nuuij converges\nto zero, which indicates T̂ nuuijY 0 ← 0. Selection of σ. Assuming a spatial representation of data points, we construct a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal’s algorithm (Kruskal, 1956) with distance between two nodes measured by Euclidean distance. Initially, no nodes are connected. We keep on adding edges in increasing order of distance. We choose the distance (say, df ) of the first edge which connects two components with different labeled points in them. We consider df as a heuristic to the minimum distance between two classes, and arbitrarily set σ = d0/3, following 3σ rule of normal distribution (Pukelsheim, 1994)."

It indicates whether Rij is mentioned alone in the reference context or together with other references. (ii) CF:First.

The hardest challenge in this task is that there is no publicly available dataset where references are annotated with the intensity value. Therefore, we constructed our own annotated dataset in two different ways. (i) Expert Annotation: we requested members of our research group4 to participate in this survey. To facilitate the labeling process, we designed a portal where all the papers present in our dataset are enlisted in a drop-down menu. Upon selecting a paper, its corresponding references were shown with five possible intensity values. The citing and cited papers are also linked to the original texts so that the annotators can read the original papers. A total of 20 researchers participated and they were asked to label as many paperreference pairs as they could based on the definitions of the intensity provided in Section 2. The annotation process went on for one month. Out of total 1640 pairs annotated, 1270 pairs were taken such that each pair was annotated by at least two annotators, and the final intensity value of the pair was considered to be the average of the scores. The Pearson correlation and Kendell’s τ among the annotators are 0.787 and 0.712 respectively. (ii) Author Annotation: we believe that the authors of a paper are the best experts to judge the intensity of references present in the paper.

This sort of citation stacking is much more pernicious and difficult to detect. We anticipate that this behavior can be detected by the reference intensity. Since the AAN dataset does not have journal information, we use DBLP dataset (Singh et al., 2015) where the complete metadata information (along with reference contexts and abstract) is available, except the full content of the paper (559,338 papers and 681 journals; more details in (Chakraborty et al., 2014)). From this dataset, we extract all the features mentioned in Section 3.3 except the ones that require full text, and run our model using the existing annotated dataset as training instances. We measure the traditional impact factor (IF ) of the journals and impact factor after considering the reference intensity (IFif ). Figure 4(a) shows that there are few journals whose IFif significantly deviates (3σ from the mean) from IF ; out of the suspected journals 70% suffer from the effect of self-journal citations as well (shown in Figure 4(b)), example including Expert Systems with Applications (current IF of 2.53). One of the future work directions would be to predict such journals as early as possible after their first appearance."

      "text" : "Although the citation count based metrics are widely accepted (Garfield, 2006; Hirsch, 2010), the belief that mere counting of citations is dubious has also been a subject of study (Chubin and Moitra, 1975).\n(Garfield, 1964) was the first who explained the reasons of citing a paper. (Pham and Hoffmann, 2003) introduced a method for the rapid development of complex rule bases for classifying text segments. (Dong and Schfer, 2011) focused on a less manual approach by learning domaininsensitive features from textual, physical, and syntactic aspects To address concerns about hindex, different alternative measures are proposed (Waltman and van Eck, 2012). However they too could benefit from filtering or weighting references with a model of influence. Several research have been proposed to weight citations based on factors such as the prestige of the citing journal (Ding, 2011; Yan and Ding, 2010), prestige of an author (Balaban, 2012), frequency of citations in citing papers (Hou et al., 2011). Recently, (Wan and Liu, 2014) proposed a SVR based approach to measure the intensity of citations. Our methodology differs from this approach in at lease four significant ways: (i) they used six very shallow level features; whereas we consider features from different dimensions, (ii) they labeled the dataset by the help of independent annotators; here we additionally ask the authors of the citing papers to identify the influential references which is very realistic (Gilbert, 1977); (iii) they adopted SVR for labeling, which does not perform well for small training instances; here we propose GraLap , designed specifically for small training instances; (iv) four applications of reference intensity mentioned here are completely new and can trigger further to reassessing the existing bibliometrics."
    }, {
      "heading" : "8 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We argued that the equal weight of all references might not be a good idea not only to gauge success of a research, but also to track follow-up work or recommending research papers. The annotated dataset would have tremendous potential to be utilized for other research. Moreover, GraLap can be used for any semi-supervised learning problem. Each application mentioned here needs separate attention. In\nfuture, we shall look into more linguistic evidences to improve our model."

Here, we posit that measuring the intensity of a reference is crucial not only to perceive better understanding of research endeavor, but also to improve the quality of citation-based applications. To this end, we collect a rich annotated dataset with references labeled by the intensity, and propose a novel graph-based semisupervised model, GraLap to label the intensity of references. Experiments with AAN datasets show a significant improvement compared to the baselines to achieve the true labels of the references (46% better correlation). Finally, we provide four applications to demonstrate how the knowledge of reference intensity leads to design better real-world applications.",
