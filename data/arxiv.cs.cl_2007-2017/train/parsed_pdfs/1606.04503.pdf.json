      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Our approach to discourse relation classification is to combine strong surface features with a distributed representation of each discourse unit. This follows prior work demonstrating that distributed representations can improve generalization for this task (Ji and Eisenstein, 2014; Ji and Eisenstein, 2015; Braud and Denis, 2015). We combine these two disparate representations in a neural network architecture. Our approach is shaped by two main design decisions: the use of long short-term memory recurrent networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to induce representations of each discourse unit, and the use of Bayesian optimization (Snoek et al., 2012) for tuning the neural network architecture."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2 System Overview",
      "text" : "The overall architecture is shown in Figure 1. The same architecture is used for both explicit and non-explicit relations, but with different parameters. The output of the classifier is a softmax layer, which takes as input a series of dense layers. These dense layers allow nonlinear interactions between surface features and elements of the distributed representations. Dropout is employed\nto reduce overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). The overall architecture is trained to minimize crossentropy. The implementation is in Keras (Chollet, 2015), and training takes several hours on a standard CPU. We now describe of the subcomponents of the classifier in detail."

      "heading" : "2.1 Distributed representations for discourse units",
      "text" : "First, we induce representations for each unit in each discourse relation. This component of the model is shown in the dotted part of Figure 1 for the first discourse argument. Prior work has explored a variety of ways for inducing representations of discourse units, including average pooling (Ji and Eisenstein, 2014; Braud and Denis, 2015) and recursive neural networks on syntactic parse trees (Li et al., 2014; Ji and Eisenstein, 2015). We take a recurrent neural network approach, characterizing\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n04 50\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n4 Ju\nn 20\n16\neach discourse unit by a recurrently-updated state vector (Li et al., 2015), with the input consisting of pre-trained word embeddings GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin from the word2vec page.1\nSpecifically, our recurrent architecture is a long short-term memory (LSTM), which uses a combination of gates to better handle long-term dependencies, as compared with the more straightforward recurrent neural network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Following Graves and Schmidhuber (2005), we employ a bidirectional LSTM, in which each training sequence is presented forwards and backwards to two separate recurrent nets, both of which are connected to the same output layer. We combine the output of these bidirectional LSTMs in a multilayer perceptron with the extracted surface features."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.2 Surface features",
      "text" : "In addition to the distributed representations of the discourse units, we use some of the most successful surface features from prior work. These features are implemented using the Natural Language Toolkit (Bird et al., 2009) and scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). In general, these features were inspired by the system from Wang and Lan (2015), which obtained best performance on the PDTB test set in the 2015 shared task (Xue et al., 2015)."

This feature alone yields F1 of 0.8862 for our classifier.\nSentiment Value The Vader Sentiment analysis package (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014) was used to calculate sentiment score for both arguments. The feature then reports whether the two arguments have the same sentiment.\nTrigrams We used trigram features for the final three words of arg1, and for the first three words of arg2."

      "heading" : "2.2.2 Features for non-explicit relations",

We then replaced the words in each pair with a cluster identity (Rutherford and Xue, 2014). Specifically, we used the GoogleNews-vectors-negative skipgram word embeddings to form 1000 clusters.\nPart-of-Speech Pairs Similarly, we formed partof-speech pairs from the tags appearing in the two arguments (Rutherford and Xue, 2014).\nProduction Rules Pairs Using the syntactic analysis of each argument, we form pairs of production rules appearing in the two arguments (Lin et al., 2009).\nAdverb Pairs Adverbs are particularly relevant for non-explicit discourse relations, so we compute features from pairs of adverbs appearing the two arguments."

      "heading" : "2.3 Hyperparameter tuning",
      "text" : "The best set of hyperparameters for the classifiers were found using spearmint (Snoek et al.,\n2012), using the GPEIOptChooser Markov Chain Monte Carlo search algorithm. This algorithm samples from the space of hyperparameters, while trying to learn a function from hyperparameters to overall performance. We use the crossentropy (and not the F1) as the overall performance objective; due to the time cost for training the model, we could run only twenty samples, which took several days. The progress of this search is shown in Figure 2, which indicates that the best hyperparameter configuration was identified on the sixth sample. More samples may have yielded better performance, but this was not possible under the time constraints of the shared task. The best set of hyperparameters for non-explicit discourse relation classification are listed in Table 1."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3 Evaluation",
      "text" : "Evaluation was performed using the evaluation script provided by the conll16 task organizers. In Table 3, the performance of our system is compared to the best-performing systems from this year’s shared task. Our system was particularly competitive on the blind test set. (The best performance on non-explicit relations on the blind test set was from ttr, but this system did not attempt to classify explicit relations, and so did not obtain an overall score for all relations.) This suggests that our approach suffered less from overfitting to the dev data. On the other hand, our system’s performance on explicit relations was further behind the best systems, suggesting the need for additional features to handle this case.\nResults are broken down by individual relation types in Table 4, again using the shared task evaluation script. In addition, the contribution of each feature is indicated in Table 2, in which features are incrementally added to a baseline model containing only the distributed representations of each argument.\nAcknowledgments We thank the organizers of the shared task for formalizing this evaluation, and we thank Yangfeng Ji for helpful discussions in the initial phase of the project."
