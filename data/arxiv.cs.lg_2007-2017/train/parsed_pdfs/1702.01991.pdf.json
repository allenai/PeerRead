      "text" : "Speech recognition is one of the success stories of language technology. It works remarkably well in a range of practical settings. However, this success relies on the use of very heavy supervision where the machine is fed thousands of hours of painstakingly transcribed audio speech signal. Humans are able to learn to recognize and understand speech from notably weaker and noisier supervision: they manage to learn to extract structure and meaning from speech by simply being exposed to utterances situated and grounded in their daily sensory experience. Modeling and emulating this remarkable skill has been the goal of numerous studies; however in the overwhelming majority of cases researchers used severely simplified settings where either the language input or the extralinguistic sensory input, or both, are small scale and symbolically represented. Section 2 provides a brief overview of this research.\nMore recently several lines of work have moved towards more realistic inputs while modeling or emulating language acquisition in a grounded setting. Gelderloos and Chrupała (2016) use the image captioning dataset MS COCO (Lin et al., 2014) to mimic the setting of grounded language learning: the sensory input consists of images of natural scenes, while the language input are phonetically transcribed descriptions of these scenes. The use of such moderately large and low-level data allows the authors to train a multi-layer recurrent neural network model, and to explore the nature and localization of the emerging hierarchy of linguistic representations learned in the process. Furthermore, in a series of recent studies Harwath and Glass (2015); Harwath et al. (2016); Harwath and Glass (2017) use image captioning datasets to model learning to understand spoken language from visual context with convolutional neural network models. Finally, there is a small but growing body of work dedicated to elucidating the nature of representations learned by neural networks from language data (see Section 2.2 for a brief overview). In the current work we build on these three strands of research and contribute the following advances:\n• We use a multi-layer gated recurrent neural network to properly model the temporal nature of speech signal and substantially improve performance compared to the convolutional architecture from Harwath and Glass (2015); • We carry out an in-depth analysis of the representations used by different components of the trained model and correlate them to representations learned by a text-based model and to human patterns of judgment on linguistic stimuli. This analysis is especially novel for a model with speech signal as input.\nThe general pattern of findings in our analysis is\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n01 99\n1v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\n0 Ju\nn 20\n17\nas follows: The model learns to extract from the acoustic input both form-related and semanticsrelated information, and encodes it in the activations of the hidden layers. Encoding of semantic aspects tends to become richer as we go up the hierarchy of layers. Meanwhile, encoding of formrelated aspects of the language input, such as utterance length or the presence of specific words, tends to initially increase and then decay.\nWe release the code for our models and analyses as open source, available at https://github.com/gchrupala/visually-groundedspeech. We also release a dataset of synthetically spoken image captions based on MS COCO, available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.400926."

      "text" : "Children learn to recognize and assign meaning to words from continuous perceptual data in extremely noisy context. While there have been many computational studies of human word meaning acquisition, they typically make strong simplifying assumptions about the nature of the input. Often language input is given in the form of word symbols, and the context consists of a set of symbols representing possible referents (e.g. Siskind, 1996; Frank et al., 2007; Fazly et al., 2010). In contrast, several studies presented models that learn from sensory rather than symbolic input, which is rich with regards to the signal itself, but very limited in scale and variation (e.g. Roy and Pentland, 2002; Yu and Ballard, 2004; Lazaridou et al., 2016)."

      "text" : "Chrupała et al. (2015) introduce a model that learns to predict the visual context from image captions. The model is trained on image-caption pairs from MSCOCO (Lin et al., 2014), capturing both rich visual input as well as larger scale input, but the language input still consists of word symbols. Gelderloos and Chrupała (2016) propose a similar architecture that instead takes phonemelevel transcriptions as language input, thereby incorporating the word segmentation problem into the learning task. In this work, we introduce an architecture that learns from continuous speech and images directly.\nThis work is related to research on visual grounding of language. The field is large and growing, with most work dedicated to the ground-\ning of written text, particularly in image captioning tasks (see Bernardi et al. (2016) for an overview). However, learning to ground language to visual information is also interesting from an automatic speech recognition point of view. Potentially, ASR systems could be trained from naturally co-occurring visual context information, without the need for extensive manual annotation – a particularly promising prospect for speech recognition in low-resource languages. There have been several attempts along these lines. Synnaeve et al. (2014) present a method of learning to recognize spoken words in isolation from cooccurrence with image fragments. Harwath and Glass (2015) present a model that learns to map pre-segmented spoken words in sequence to aspects of the visual context, while in Harwath and Glass (2017) the model also learns to recognize words in the unsegmented signal.\nMost closely related to our work is that of Harwath et al. (2016), as it presents an architecture that learns to project images and unsegmented spoken captions to the same embedding space. The sentence representation is obtained by feeding the spectrogram to a convolutional network. The architecture is trained on crowd-sourced spoken captions for images from the Places dataset (Zhou et al., 2014), and evaluated on image search and caption retrieval. Unfortunately this dataset is not currently available and we were thus unable to directly compare the performance of our model to Harwath et al. (2016). We do compare to Harwath and Glass (2015) which was tested on a public dataset. We make different architectural choices, as our models are based on recurrent highway networks (Zilly et al., 2016). As in human cognition, speech is processed incrementally. This also allows our architecture to integrate information sequentially from speech of arbitrary duration."

      "text" : "While analysis of neural methods in NLP is often limited to evaluation of the performance on the training task, recently methods have been introduced to peek inside the black box and explore what it is that enables the model to perform the task. One approach is to look at the contribution of specific parts of the input, or specific units in the model, to final representations or decisions. Kádár et al. (2016) propose omission scores, a method to estimate the contribution of input tokens to the fi-\nnal representation by removing them from the input and comparing the resulting representations to the ones generated by the original input. In a similar approach, Li et al. (2016) study the contribution of individual input tokens as well as hidden units and word embedding dimensions by erasing them from the representation and analyzing how this affects the model.\nMiao et al. (2016) and Tang et al. (2016) use visualization techniques for fine-grained analysis of GRU and LSTM models for ASR. Visualization of input and forget gate states allows Miao et al. (2016) to make informed adaptations to gated recurrent architectures, resulting in more efficiently trainable models. Tang et al. (2016) visualize qualitative differences between LSTM- and GRUbased architectures, regarding the encoding of information, as well as how it is processed through time.\nWe specifically study linguistic properties of the information encoded in the trained model. Adi et al. (2016) introduce prediction tasks to analyze information encoded in sentence embeddings about word order, sentence length, and the presence of individual words. We use related techniques to explore encoding of aspects of form and meaning within components of our stacked architecture."

      "text" : "We use a multi-layer, gated recurrent neural network (RHN) to model the temporal nature of speech signal. Recurrent neural networks are designed for modeling sequential data, and gated variants (GRUs, LSTMs) are widely used with speech and text in both cognitive modeling and engineering contexts. RHNs are a simple generalization of GRU networks such that the transform between time points can consist of several steps.\nOur multimodal model projects spoken utterances and images to a joint semantic space. The idea of projecting different modalities to a shared semantic space via a pair of encoders has been used in work on language and vision (among them Vendrov et al. (2015)). The core idea is to encourage inputs representing the same meaning in different modalities to end up nearby, while maintaining a distance from unrelated inputs.\nThe model consists of two parts: an utterance encoder, and an image encoder. The utterance encoder starts from MFCC speech features, while\nthe image encoder starts from features extracted with a VGG-16 pre-trained on ImageNet. Our loss function attempts to make the cosine distance between encodings of matching utterances and images less than the distance between encodings of mismatching utterance/image pairs, by a margin:\n(1)\n∑\nu,i\n(∑\nu′ max[0, α+d(u, i)−d(u′, i)]\n+ ∑\ni′ max[0, α+ d(u, i)− d(u, i′)]\n)\nwhere d(u, i) is the cosine distance between the encoded utterance u and encoded image i. Here (u, i) is the matching utterance-image pair, u′ ranges over utterances not describing i and i′ ranges over images not described by u. The image encoder enci is a simple linear projection, followed by normalization to unit L2 norm:\nenci(i) = unit(Ai+ b) (2)\nwhere unit(x) = x (xT x)0.5 and with (A, b) as learned parameters. The utterance encoder encu consists of a 1-dimensional convolutional layer of length s, size d and stride z, whose output feeds into a Recurrent Highway Network with k layers and L microsteps, whose output in turn goes through an attention-like lookback operator, and finally L2 normalization:\nencu(u) = unit(Attn(RHNk,L(Convs,d,z(u)))) (3)\nThe main function of the convolutional layer Convs,d,z is to subsample the input along the temporal dimension. We use a 1-dimensional convolution with full border mode padding. The attention operator simply computes a weighted sum of the RHN activation at all timesteps:\nAttn(x) = ∑\nt\nαtxt (4)\nwhere the weights αt are determined by learned parameters U and W, and passed through the timewise softmax function:\nαt = exp(U tanh(Wxt))∑ t′ exp(U tanh(Wxt′))\n(5)\nThe main component of the utterance encoder is a recurrent network, specifically a Recurrent Highway Network (Zilly et al., 2016). The idea behind\nRHN is to increase the depth of the transform between timesteps, or the recurrence depth. Otherwise they are a type of gated recurrent networks. The transition from timestep t − 1 to t is then defined as:\nrhn(xt, s (L) t−1) = s (L) t (6)\nwhere xt stands for input at time t, and s (l) t denotes the state at time t at recurrence layer l, with L being the top layer of recurrence. Furthermore,\ns (l) t = h (l) t t (l) t + s (l−1) t ( 1− t(l)t ) (7)\nwhere is elementwise multiplication, and\nh (l) t = tanh ( I[l = 1]WHxt +UHls (l−1) t ) (8)\nt (l) t = σ ( I[l = 1]WTxt +UTls (l−1) )\n(9)\nHere I is the indicator function: input is only included in the computation for the first layer of recurrence l = 1. By applying the rhn function repeatedly, an RHN layer maps a sequence of inputs to a sequence of states:\n(10) RHN(X, s0)\n= rhn(xn, . . . , rhn(x2, rhn(x1, s (L) 0 )))\nTwo or more RHN layers can be composed into a stack:\nRHN2(RHN1(X, s1 (L) 0 ), s2 (L) 0 ), (11)\nwhere sn (l) t stands for the state vector of layer n of the stack, at layer l of recurrence, at time t. In our version of the Stacked RHN architecture we use residualized layers:\nRHNres(X, s0) = RHN(X, s0) +X (12)\nThis formulation tends to ease optimization in multi-layer models (cf. He et al., 2015; Oord et al., 2016).\nIn addition to the speech model described above, we also define a comparable text model. As it takes a sequence of words as input, we replace the convolutional layer with a word embedding lookup table. We found the text model did not benefit from the use of the attention mechanism, and thus the sentence embedding is simply the L2-normalized activation vector of the topmost layer, at the last timestep."

The Speech RHN model scores substantially higher than model of Harwath and Glass (2015) on the same data. However the large gap between its perfomance and the scores of the text model suggests that Flickr8K is rather small for the speech task. In Table 2 we present the results on the dataset of synthetic speech from MS COCO. Here the text model is still better, but the gap is much smaller than for Flickr8K. We attribute this to the much larger size of dataset, and to the less noisy and less variable synthetic speech.\nWhile the MS COCO text model is overall better than the speech model, there are cases where it outperforms the text model. We listed the top hundred cases where the ratio of the ranks of the correct image according to the two models was the smallest, as well as another hundred cases where it was the largest. Manual inspection did not turn\nup any obvious patterns for the cases of text being better than speech. For the cases where speech outperformed text, two patterns stood out: (i) sentences with spelling mistakes, (ii) unusually long sentences. For example for the sentence a yellow\nand white birtd is in flight the text model misses the misspelled word birtd and returns an irrelevant image, while the speech model seems robust to some degree of variation in pronunciation and returns the target image at rank 1 (see Figure 1). In an attempt to quantify this effect we counted the number of unique words with training set frequencies below 5 in the top 100 utterances with lowest and highest rank ratio: for the utterances where text was better there were 16 such words; for utterances where speech was better there were 28, among them misspellings such as streeet, scears (for skiers), contryside, scull, birtd, devise.\nThe distribution of utterance lengths in Figure 2 confirms pattern (ii): the set of 100 sentences where speech beats text by a large margin are longer on average and there are extremely long outliers among them. One of them is the 36-word-\nlong utterance depicted in Figure 3, with ranks 470 and 2 for text and speech respectively. We suspect that the speech model’s attention mechanism enables it to cherry pick key fragments of such monster utterances, while the text model lacking this mechanism may struggle. Figure 3 shows the plot of the attention weights for this utterance from the\nspeech model."

      "heading" : "4.3 Predicting utterance length",

Since the length of an utterance directly corresponds to how long it takes to articulate, we also use the number of time steps5 as a feature and expect it to provide the upper bound for our task, especially for synthetic speech. We use a Ridge Regression model for predicting utterance length using each set of features. The model is trained on 80% of the sentences in the validation set, and tested on the remaining 20%. For all features regularization penalty α = 1.0 gave the best results.\nFigure 4 shows the results for this task on human speech from Flickr8K and synthetic speech from COCO. With the exception of the average input vectors for Flickr8K, all features can explain a high proportion of variance in the predicted utterance length. The pattern observed for the two datasets is slightly different: due to the systematic conversion of words to synthetic speech in COCO, using the number of time steps for this dataset yields the highest R2. However, this feature is not as informative for predicting the utterance length in Flickr8K due to noise and variation in human speech, and is in fact outperformed by some of the features extracted from the model. Also, the input vectors from COCO are much more informative than Flickr8K due to larger quantity and simpler structure of the speech signal. However, in both datasets the best (non-ceiling) performance is obtained by using average unit activations from the hidden layers (layer 2 for COCO, and layers 3 and 4 for Flickr8K). These features outperform utterance embeddings, which are optimized according to the visual grounding objective of the model and most probably learn to ignore the superficial characteristics of the utterance that do not contribute to matching the corresponding image.\nNote that the performance on COCO plateaus after the second layer, which might suggest that form-based knowledge is learned by lower layers. Since Flickr8K is much smaller in size, the stabilising happens later in layer 3.\n5This is approximately duration in milliseconds 10×stride ."

      "text" : "Results from the previous experiment suggest that our model acquires information about higher level building blocks (words) in the continuous speech signal. Here we explore whether it can detect the presence or absence of individual words in an utterance. We formulate detecting a word in an utterance as a binary classification task, for which we use a multi-layer perceptron with a single hidden layer of size 1024, optimized by Adam. The input to the model is a concatenation of the feature vector representing an utterance and the one representing a target word. We again use utterance embeddings, average unit activations on each layer, and average input vectors as features, and represent each target word as a vector of MFCC features extracted from the audio signal synthetically produced for that word.\nFor each utterance in the validation set, we randomly pick one positive and one negative target (i.e., one word that does and one that does not appear in the utterance) that is not a stop word. To balance the probability of a word being positive or negative, we use each positive target as a negative target for another utterance in the validation\nset. The MLP model is trained on the positive and negative examples corresponding to 80% of the utterances in the validation set of each dataset, and evaluated on the remaining 20%.\nFigure 5 shows the mean accuracy of the MLP on Flickr8K and COCO. All results using features extracted from the model are above chance (0.5), with the average unit activations of the hidden layers yielding the best results (0.65 for Flickr8K on layer 3, and 0.79 for COCO on layer 4). These numbers show that the speech model infers reliable information about word-level blocks from the low-level audio features it receives as input. The observed trend is similar to the previous task: average unit activations on the higher-level hidden layers are more informative for this task than the utterance embeddings, but the performance plateaus before the topmost layer."

SICK consists of image descriptions taken from\nFlickr8K and video captions from the SemEval 2012 STS MSRVideo Description data set (STS) (Agirre et al., 2012). Captions were paired at random, as well as modified to obtain semantically similar and contrasting counterparts, and the resulting pairs were rated for semantic similarity.\nFor all sentence pairs in SICK, we generate synthetic spoken sentences and feed them to the COCO Speech RHN, and calculate the cosine similarity between the averaged MFCC input vectors, the averaged hidden layer activation vectors, and the sentence embeddings. Z-score transformation was applied before calculating the cosine similarities. We then correlate these cosine similarities with\n• semantic relatedness according to human ratings • cosine similarities according to z-score transformed embeddings from COCO Text RHN • edit similarities, a measure of how similar the sentences are in form, specifically, 1−normalized Levenshtein distance over character sequences\nFigure 6 shows a boxplot over 10,000 bootstrap samples for all correlations. We observe that (i) correlation with edit similarity initially increases, then decreases; (ii) correlation with human relatedness scores and text model embeddings increases until layer 4, but decreases for hidden layer 5. The initially increasing and then decreasing correlation with edit similarity is consistent with the findings that information about form is encoded by lower layers. The overall growing correlation with both human semantic similarity ratings and\nthe COCO Text RHN indicate that higher layers learn to represent semantic knowledge. We were somewhat surprised by the pattern for the correlation with human ratings and the Text model similarities which drops for layer 5. We suspect it may be caused by the model at this point in the layer hierarchy being strongly tuned to the specifics of the COCO dataset. To test this, we checked the correlations with COCO Text embeddings on validation sentences from the COCO dataset instead of SICK. These increased monotonically, in support of our conjecture."

We group the words in the union of the training and validation data of the COCO dataset by their phonetic transcription. We then pick pairs of words which have the same pronunciation but different spelling, for example suite/sweet. We impose the following conditions: (a) both forms appear more than 20 times, (b) the two forms have different meaning (i.e. they are not simply variant spellings like theater/theatre), (c) neither form is a function word, and (d) the more frequent form constitutes less than 95% of the occurrences. This\ngives us 34 word pairs. For each pair we generate a binary classification task by taking all the utterances where either form appears, using average input vectors, utterance embeddings, and average unit activations as features. Instances for all feature sets are normalized to unit L2 norm.\nFor each task and feature set we run stratified 10-fold cross validation using Logistic Regression to predict which of the two words the utterance contains. Figure 7 shows, for each pair, the relative error reduction of each feature set with respect to the majority baseline. There is substantial variation across word pairs, but overall the task becomes easier as the features come from higher layers in the network. Some forms can be disambiguated with very high accuracy (e.g. sale/sail, cole/coal, pairs/pears), while some others cannot be distinguished at all (peaking/peeking, great/grate, mantle/mantel). We examined the sentences containing the failing forms, and found out that almost all occurrences of peaking and mantle were misspellings of peeking and mantel, which explains the impossibility of disambiguating these cases."

This will hopefully lead to a better understanding of language learning and processing by both artificial and neural networks."

We carry out an in-depth analysis of the representations used by different components of the trained model and show that encoding of semantic aspects tends to become richer as we go up the hierarchy of layers, whereas encoding of formrelated aspects of the language input tends to initially increase and then plateau or decrease.",
