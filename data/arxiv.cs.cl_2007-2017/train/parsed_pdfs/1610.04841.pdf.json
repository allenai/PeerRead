      "text" : "Quality estimation is the process to predict the quality of translation without any reference translation (Blatz et al., 2004; Specia et al., 2009). Whereas, Machine Translation (MT) system evaluation does require references (human translation). QE could be done at word, phrase, sentence or document level. This paper describes the submission to the shared task on word and phrase level QE (Task 2) for English-German (en-de) MT.\nThe shared task has the trace of last five years’ research in the field of QE (Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bojar et al., 2013; Bojar et al., 2014; Bojar et al., 2015).\nIn recent years, RNN-LM has demonstrated exceptional performance in a variety of NLP applications (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Socher et al., 2013a; Socher et al., 2013b). The RNN-LM represents each word as high-dimensional real-valued vectors, like the other continuous space language models such as feed forward neural network language models (Schwenk and Gauvain, 2002; Bengio et al., 2003; Morin and Bengio, 2005; Schwenk, 2007) and Hierarchical Log-Bi-linear language models (Mnih and Hinton, 2009).\nIn this paper, we have used a modified version of RNN-LM, which accepts the word sequence (context window) as input and predicts label at the output for the middle word. For example, let us consider the following input/output sample:\nEnglish (MT input): Layer effects are retained by default .\nGerman (MT output): ” Effekte sind standardmig beibehalten .\nGerman (Post-edited): Ebeneneffekte werden standardmig beibehalten .\nTags: BAD BAD BAD OK OK OK Now if we have to predict the output tag (BAD) for the word “sind” in the MT output, our input sequence to the RNN-LM will be “Effekte sind standardmig” (if context window size is 3). Whereas, for standard RNN-LM model, “Effekte standardmig” would be the input to the network with “sind” as the output. We add padding at the start and end of the sentence according to the context window. The detailed description of the model and its implementation is given in section 3.\nWe have used the data provided by the or-\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n04 84\n1v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n1 O\nct 2\n01 6\nganizers for the shared task on quality estimation (2016) which includes: (i) source sentence (ii) translated output (word/phrase level) (iii) word/phrase level tagging (OK/BAD) (iv) post edited translation (v) 22 baseline features (vi) word alignment. The goal of the task is to predict whether the given word/phrase is a correct/incorrect (OK/BAD) translation in the given sentence.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the related work. Section 3 presents RNN models we use, and its implementation. In section 4, we discuss the data distribution, our approaches, and results. Discussion of our methodology and different models is covered in section 5 followed by concluding remarks in section 6."

      "text" : "For word level QE, supervised classification techniques are being used widely. Most of these approaches require manually designed features (Bojar et al., 2014), similar to the feature set provided by the organizers.\nLogacheva et al. (2015) modeled the word level QE using the CRF++ tool with data selection and data bootstrapping in which data selection filters out the sentences having the smallest proportion of erroneous tokens and are assumed to be less useful for the task. The bootstrapping technique creates additional data instances and boosts the importance of BAD labels occurring in the training data. Shang et al. (2015) tried to solve the problem of label imbalance with creating sub-labels like OK B (begin), OK I (intermediate), OK E (end). Shah et al. (2015) have used word embedding as an additional feature (+25 features) with SVM classifier. Bilingual Deep Neural Network (DNN) based model for word level QE was proposed by Kreutzer et al. (2015), in which word embedding was pre-trained and fine-tuned with other parameters of the network using stochastic gradient descent. de Souza et al. (2014) have used Bidirectional LSTM as a classifier for word level QE.\nThe architecture of RNN-LM has been used for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) (Yao et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2014) earlier. Our approach is quite similar to the Kreutzer et al. (2015), but we are using RNN instead of DNN. We have also tried to address the problem of label-imbalance, introducing sub-labels as suggested by Shang et\nal. (2015)."

      "text" : "For this task, we exploited RNN’s extensions, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014). LSTM and GRU have shown to perform better at modeling the long-range dependencies in the data than the simple RNN. Simple RNN also suffers from the problem of exploding and vanishing gradient (Bengio et al., 1994). LSTM and GRU tackle this problem by introducing a gating mechanism. LSTM includes input, output and forget gates with a memory cell, whereas GRU has reset and update gates only (no memory cell). The detailed description of each model is given in the following subsections."

All the bias vectors were initialized to zero. Other weight matrices were sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 0.012.\nTo update the model parameters, we have used Truncated Back-Propagation-Through-Time (T-BPTT) (Werbos, 1990) (Werbos, 1990) with stochastic gradient descent. We fixed the depth of BPTT to 7 for all the models. We used Ada-delta (Zeiler, 2012) (Zeiler, 2012) to adapt the learning rate of each parameter automatically ( = 10−6 and ρ = 0.95). We trained each model for 50 epochs."

      "text" : "Our experiments are mainly focused on the word level QE. We have used the output of the word level QE system for the estimation of the phrase level quality.\nAs mentioned above, we have used the modified RNN-LM architecture for the experiments. Baseline (LSTM) system was developed by training word embedding from scratch with other parameters of the model. In another set of experiments, we have pre-trained the word embedding with word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013b), and further tuned with the training of the model parameters. For pretraining, we have used an additional corpus (2M sentences approx.) from EnglishGerman Europarl data (Koehn, 2005).\nFor bilingual models, we restructured the source sentence (English) according to the target (German) using word alignment provided by the organizers. For many-to-one mapping in the alignment (English-German), we chose the first alignment only. The ‘NULL’ token was assigned to the words where were not aligned with any word on the target side. The input of the model is constructed by concatenating context words of source and target. For example, consider the source word sequence s1s2s3, and the target word sequence t1t2t3, then the input to the network will be s1s2s3t1t2t3.\nIn the training data, the distribution of the labels (OK/BAD) is skewed (OK to BAD ratio is approx. 4:1). To handle the issue, we tried one of the strategies proposed by Shang et al. (2015),\nin which we replace ‘OK’ label with sub-labels to balance the distribution. The sub-labels are OK B, OK I, OK E, depending on the location of the token in the sentence."

As it was mentioned by the organizers that a phrase is tagged as ‘BAD’, if any word in the phrase is an incorrect translation. So, We have taken the output of the word level QE system and tagged the phrase as ‘BAD’, if any word in the phrase boundary is tagged ‘BAD’. And other phrases (all words have the OK tag) are simply tagged as ‘OK’."

The results of the experiments against Test2 are displayed in Table 2 and 3.\nWe have evaluated our systems using the F1score. As ‘OK’ class is dominant in the data and a naive system tagging all the words ‘OK’ will score high. Hence, F1-score of the ‘BAD’ class has been used as a primary metric for the system evaluation. We have used the separate set of test and development corpus as shown in Table 2. The evaluation of all the experiments against Test1 corpus is displayed in Table 2 for word level QE. Results for\nphrase level QE are shown in Table 3. From the result tables, it is evident that GRU outperforms LSTM as reported by Cho et al. (2014) for this task as well. Pre-training is helpful in all the models. Also, the introduction of sub-labels is able to handle the problem of labelimbalance up to some extent. The results of Bilingual models are better than monolingual models, as reported by Kreutzer et al. (2015)."

      "heading" : "5 Discussion",
      "text" : "The approach is language independent and it uses only context words’ vector for predicting the tag for a word. In the other words, we check if any word fits (grammatically) in the given slot of words or not. We could use language specific features to enhance the classification accuracy, though. Experiments with bilingual models are similar to the concept of adding more features to any machine learning algorithm. In monolingual models, we use only target (German) words’ vector as feature whereas, in bilingual models, we use source (English) words’ vector also. A challenge which machine learning practitioners often face is, how to deal with skewed classes in classification problems. The distribution of classes (OK/BAD) is skewed in our case as well. To handle the issue, we tried to balance the distribution of classes by introducing the sub-labels.\nLSTM and GRU are quite similar models, except the gating mechanism. It is hard to say which model will perform better in what conditions or in general (Chung et al., 2014). In this paper and in general as well, this restricts us to conduct only the empirical comparison between the LSTM and the GRU units. Deep models generally perform better than the shallow models, which is opposite for this task where LSTM outperforms Deep LSTM. The reason could be the insufficient data for training the deep models."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion and Future Work",
      "text" : "We have developed a language independent word/phrase level Quality Estimation system using RNN. We have used RNN-LM architecture, with LSTM, deep LSTM, and GRU. We showed that these models benefit from pretraining and the introduction of sub-labels. Also, models with bilingual features outperform the monolingual models.\nWe can extend the work for sentence and document level quality estimation. Improving the word level quality estimation with data selection and bootstrapping (Logacheva et al., 2015), more effective ways to handle label-imbalance, training bigger models, using language specific features, other variations of LSTM architecture etc., are the other possibilities."

For many-to-one mapping in the alignment (English-German), we chose the first alignment only. The ‘NULL’ token was assigned to the words where were not aligned with any word on the target side. The input of the model is constructed by concatenating context words of source and target. For example, consider the source word sequence s1s2s3, and the target word sequence t1t2t3, then the input to the network will be s1s2s3t1t2t3. In the training data, the distribution of the labels (OK/BAD) is skewed (OK to BAD ratio is approx. 4:1). To handle the issue, we tried one of the strategies proposed by Shang et al. (2015),",

The objective of the shared task was to predict if the given word/phrase is a correct/incorrect (OK/BAD) translation in the given sentence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for word level Quality Estimation using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) architecture. RNN-LMs have been found very effective in different Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. RNN-LM is mainly used for vector space language modeling for different NLP problems. For this task, we modify the architecture of RNNLM. The modified system predicts a label (OK/BAD) in the slot rather than predicting the word. The input to the system is a word sequence, similar to the standard RNN-LM. The approach is language independent and requires only the translated text for QE. To estimate the phrase level quality, we use the output of the word level QE system.",
