First, using policy gradient and mixed-loss methods for reinforcement learning, we directly optimize sentence-level task-based metrics (as rewards), achieving significant improvements over the baseline, based on both automatic metrics and human evaluation on multiple datasets. Next, we propose a novel entailment-enhanced reward (CIDEnt) that corrects phrase-matching based metrics (such as CIDEr) to only allow for logically-implied partial matches and avoid contradictions, achieving further significant improvements over the CIDEr-reward model. Overall, our CIDEnt-reward model achieves the new state-of-the-art on the MSR-VTT dataset."

      "text" : "The task of video captioning (Fig. 1) is an important next step to image captioning, with additional modeling of temporal knowledge and action sequences, and has several applications in online content search, assisting the visuallyimpaired, etc. Advancements in neural sequenceto-sequence learning has shown promising improvements on this task, based on encoderdecoder, attention, and hierarchical models (Venugopalan et al., 2015a; Pan et al., 2016a). However, these models are still trained using a wordlevel cross-entropy loss, which does not correlate well with the sentence-level metrics that the task is finally evaluated on (e.g., CIDEr, BLEU). Moreover, these models suffer from exposure bias (Ran-\nzato et al., 2016), which occurs when a model is only exposed to the training data distribution, instead of its own predictions. First, using a sequence-level training, policy gradient approach (Ranzato et al., 2016), we allow video captioning models to directly optimize these nondifferentiable metrics, as rewards in a reinforcement learning paradigm. We also address the exposure bias issue by using a mixed-loss (Paulus et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016), i.e., combining the cross-entropy and reward-based losses, which also helps maintain output fluency.\nNext, we introduce a novel entailment-corrected reward that checks for logically-directed partial matches. Current reinforcement-based text generation works use traditional phrase-matching metrics (e.g., CIDEr, BLEU) as their reward function. However, these metrics use undirected ngram matching of the machine-generated caption with the ground-truth caption, and hence fail to capture its directed logical correctness. Therefore, they still give high scores to even those generated captions that contain a single but critical wrong word (e.g., negation, unrelated action or object), because all the other words still match with the ground truth. We introduce CIDEnt, which penalizes the phrase-matching metric (CIDEr) based reward, when the entailment score is low. This ensures that a generated caption gets a high re-\nward only when it is a directed match with (i.e., it is logically implied by) the ground truth caption, hence avoiding contradictory or unrelated information (e.g., see Fig. 1). Empirically, we show that first the CIDEr-reward model achieves significant improvements over the cross-entropy baseline (on multiple datasets, and automatic and human evaluation); next, the CIDEnt-reward model further achieves significant improvements over the CIDEr-based reward. Overall, we achieve the new state-of-the-art on the MSR-VTT dataset."

(2016), using a mixed sequence level training paradigm to use non-differentiable evaluation metrics as rewards.1 Liu et al. (2016b) and Rennie et al. (2016) improve upon this using Monte Carlo roll-outs and a test inference baseline, respectively. Paulus et al. (2017) presented summarization results with ROUGE rewards, in a mixed-loss setup.\nRecognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) is a traditional NLP task (Dagan et al., 2006; Lai and Hockenmaier, 2014; Jimenez et al., 2014), boosted by a large dataset (SNLI) recently introduced by Bowman et al. (2015). There have been several leaderboard models on SNLI (Cheng et al., 2016; Rocktäschel et al., 2016); we focus on the decomposable, intra-sentence attention model of Parikh et al. (2016). Recently, Pasunuru and Bansal (2017) used multi-task learning to combine video captioning with entailment and video generation.\n1Several papers have presented the relative comparison of image captioning metrics, and their pros and cons (Vedantam et al., 2015; Anderson et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016b; Hodosh et al., 2013; Elliott and Keller, 2014)."

      "text" : "Attention Baseline (Cross-Entropy) Our attention-based seq-to-seq baseline model is similar to the Bahdanau et al. (2015) architecture, where we encode input frame level video features {f1:n} via a bi-directional LSTM-RNN and then generate the caption w1:m using an LSTM-RNN with an attention mechanism. Let θ be the model parameters and w∗ 1:m be the ground-truth caption, then the cross entropy loss function is:\nL(θ) = − m ∑\nt=1\nlog p(w∗t |w ∗ 1:t−1, f1:n) (1)\nwhere p(wt|w1:t−1, f1:n) = softmax(W Thdt ), W T is the projection matrix, and wt and h d t are the generated word and the RNN decoder hidden state at time step t, computed using the standard RNN recursion and attention-based context vector ct. Details of the attention model are in the supplementary (due to space constraints).\nReinforcement Learning (Policy Gradient) In order to directly optimize the sentence-level test metrics (as opposed to the cross-entropy loss above), we use a policy gradient pθ, where θ represent the model parameters. Here, our baseline model acts as an agent and interacts with its environment (video and caption). At each time step, the agent generates a word (action), and the generation of the end-of-sequence token results in a reward r to the agent. Our training objective is to minimize the negative expected reward function:\nL(θ) = −Ews∼pθ [r(w s)] (2)\nwhere ws is the word sequence sampled from the model. Based on the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992), the gradients of this nondifferentiable, reward-based loss function are:\n∇θL(θ) = −Ews∼pθ [r(w s) · ∇θ log pθ(w s)] (3)\nWe follow Ranzato et al. (2016) approximating the above gradients via a single sampled word\nsequence. We also use a variance-reducing bias (baseline) estimator in the reward function. Their details and the partial derivatives using the chain rule are described in the supplementary.\nMixed Loss During reinforcement learning, optimizing for only the reinforcement loss (with automatic metrics as rewards) doesn’t ensure the readability and fluency of the generated caption, and there is also a chance of gaming the metrics without actually improving the quality of the output (Liu et al., 2016a). Hence, for training our reinforcement based policy gradients, we use a mixed loss function, which is a weighted combination of the cross-entropy loss (XE) and the reinforcement learning loss (RL), similar to the previous work (Paulus et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016). This mixed loss improves results on the metric used as reward through the reinforcement loss (and improves relevance based on our entailmentenhanced rewards) but also ensures better readability and fluency due to the cross-entropy loss (in which the training objective is a conditioned language model, learning to produce fluent captions). Our mixed loss is defined as:\nLMIXED = (1− γ)LXE + γLRL (4)\nwhere γ is a tuning parameter used to balance the two losses. For annealing and faster convergence, we start with the optimized cross-entropy loss baseline model, and then move to optimizing the above mixed loss function.2"

      "text" : "Caption Metric Reward Previous image captioning papers have used traditional captioning metrics such as CIDEr, BLEU, or METEOR as reward functions, based on the match between the generated caption sample and the ground-truth reference(s). First, it has been shown by Vedantam\n2We also experimented with the curriculum learning ‘MIXER’ strategy of Ranzato et al. (2016), where the XE+RL annealing is based on the decoder time-steps; however, the mixed loss function strategy (described above) performed better in terms of maintaining output caption fluency.\net al. (2015) that CIDEr, based on a consensus measure across several human reference captions, has a higher correlation with human evaluation than other metrics such as METEOR, ROUGE, and BLEU. They further showed that CIDEr gets better with more number of human references (and this is a good fit for our video captioning datasets, which have 20-40 human references per video).\nMore recently, Rennie et al. (2016) further showed that CIDEr as a reward in image captioning outperforms all other metrics as a reward, not just in terms of improvements on CIDEr metric, but also on all other metrics. In line with these above previous works, we also found that CIDEr as a reward (‘CIDEr-RL’ model) achieves the best metric improvements in our video captioning task, and also has the best human evaluation improvements (see Sec. 6.3 for result details, incl. those about other rewards based on BLEU, SPICE).\nEntailment Corrected Reward Although CIDEr performs better than other metrics as a reward, all these metrics (including CIDEr) are still based on an undirected n-gram matching score between the generated and ground truth captions. For example, the wrong caption “a man is playing football” w.r.t. the correct caption “a man is playing basketball” still gets a high score, even though these two captions belong to two completely different events. Similar issues hold in case of a negation or a wrong action/object in the generated caption (see examples in Table 1).\nWe address the above issue by using an entailment score to correct the phrase-matching metric (CIDEr or others) when used as a reward, ensuring that the generated caption is logically implied by (i.e., is a paraphrase or directed partial match with) the ground-truth caption. To achieve an accurate entailment score, we adapt the state-of-theart decomposable-attention model of Parikh et al. (2016) trained on the SNLI corpus (image caption domain). This model gives us a probability for whether the sampled video caption (generated by our model) is entailed by the ground truth caption as premise (as opposed to a contradiction or neu-\ntral case).3 Similar to the traditional metrics, the overall ‘Ent’ score is the maximum over the entailment scores for a generated caption w.r.t. each reference human caption (around 20/40 per MSRVTT/YouTube2Text video). CIDEnt is defined as:\nCIDEnt =\n{\nCIDEr− λ, if Ent < β CIDEr, otherwise (5)\nwhich means that if the entailment score is very low, we penalize the metric reward score by decreasing it by a penalty λ. This agreement-based formulation ensures that we only trust the CIDErbased reward in cases when the entailment score is also high. Using CIDEr−λ also ensures the smoothness of the reward w.r.t. the original CIDEr function (as opposed to clipping the reward to a constant). Here, λ and β are hyperparameters that can be tuned on the dev-set; on light tuning, we found the best values to be intuitive: λ = roughly the baseline (cross-entropy) model’s score on that metric (e.g., 0.45 for CIDEr on MSR-VTT dataset); and β = 0.33 (i.e., the 3-class entailment classifier chose contradiction or neutral label for this pair). Table 1 shows some examples of sampled generated captions during our model training, where CIDEr was misleadingly high for incorrect captions, but the low entailment score (probability) helps us successfully identify these cases and penalize the reward."

This discrepancy can be addressed by directly optimizing the\nnon-differentiable metric scores using policy gradients pθ, where θ represents the model parameters. In our captioning system, our baseline attention model acts as an agent and interacts with its environment (video and caption). At each time step, the agent generates a word (action), and the generation of the end-of-sequence token results in a reward r to the agent. Our training objective is to minimize the negative expected reward function given by:\nL(θ) = −Ews∼pθ [r(w s)] (11)\nwhere ws = {ws 1 , ws 2 , ..., wsm}, and w s t is the word sampled from the model at time step t.

In our model, baseline estimator is a simple linear regressor with hidden state of the decoder hdt at time step t as the input. We stop the back propagation of gradients before the hidden states for the baseline bias estimator.

First, using policy gradient and mixed-loss methods for reinforcement learning, we directly optimize sentence-level task-based metrics (as rewards), achieving significant improvements over the baseline, based on both automatic metrics and human evaluation on multiple datasets. Next, we propose a novel entailment-enhanced reward (CIDEnt) that corrects phrase-matching based metrics (such as CIDEr) to only allow for logically-implied partial matches and avoid contradictions, achieving further significant improvements over the CIDEr-reward model. Overall, our CIDEnt-reward model achieves the new state-of-the-art on the MSR-VTT dataset.",
