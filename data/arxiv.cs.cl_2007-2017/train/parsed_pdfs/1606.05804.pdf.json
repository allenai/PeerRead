      "text" : "Automatic knowledge base construction (AKBC) is the task of building a structured knowledge base (KB) of facts using raw text evidence, and often an initial seed KB to be augmented (Carlson et al., 2010; Suchanek et al., 2007; Bollacker et al., 2008). KBs generally contain entity type facts such as Sundar Pichai IsA Person and relation facts such as CEO Of(Sundar Pichai, Google).\nExtracted facts about entities, and their types and relations are useful for many downstream tasks such as question answering (Bordes et al., 2014) and semantic parsing (Berant et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013).\nAn effective approach to AKBC is universal schema, which predicts the types of entities and relations in a knowledge base (KB) by jointly embedding the union of all available schema types—not only types from multiple structured databases (such as Freebase or Wikipedia infoboxes), but also types expressed as textual patterns from raw text. This prediction is typically modeled as a matrix completion problem. In the standard formulation for relation extraction (Riedel et al., 2013), entity pairs and relations occupy the rows and columns of the matrix respectively (Figure 1). Analogously in entity type prediction (Yao et al., 2013), entities and types occupy the rows and columns of the matrix respectively (Figure 2). The row and column entries are represented as learned vectors with compatibility determined by a scoring function.\nIn its original form, universal schema can reason only about row entries and column entries explicitly seen during training. Unseen rows and columns observed at test time do not have a learned embedding. This problem is referred to as the cold-start problem in recommendation systems (Schein et al., 2002).\nRecently Toutanova et al. (2015) and Verga et al. (2016) proposed ‘column-less’ versions of universal schema models that generalize to unseen column entries. They learn compositional pattern encoders to parameterize the column matrix in place of individual column embeddings. However, these models still do not generalize to unseen row entries.\nIn this work, we present a ‘row-less’ extension of universal schema that generalizes to unseen entities and entity pairs. Rather than representing each row entry with an explicit dense vector, we encode each entity or entity pair as aggregate functions over their observed column entries. This is beneficial because when new entities are mentioned in text documents and subsequently added to\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n05 80\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n8 Ju\nn 20\nthe KB, we can directly reason on the observed text evidence to infer new binary relations and entity types for the new entities. This avoids the cumbersome effort of re-training the whole model from scratch to learn embeddings for the new entities.\nTo construct the row representation, we compare various aggregation functions in our experiments. We consider query independent and dependent aggregation functions. We find that query dependent attentional models that selectively focus on relevant evidence outperform the query independent alternatives. The query dependent attention mechanism also helps in providing a direct connection between the prediction and its provenance. Additionally, our models have a much smaller memory footprint since they do not store explicit row representations.\nIt is important to note that our approach is different from sentence level classifiers that predict KB relations and entity types using a single sentence as evidence. To make a prediction, we pool information from multiple pieces of evidence coming from both text and annotated KB facts. Also, our methods predict a much richer set of labels (KB types and textual) enabling easier downstream processing closer to natural language interaction with the KB.\nThe current methods for KB entity type prediction operate with explicit entity representations (Yao et al., 2013; Neelakantan and Chang, 2015) and hence, cannot generalize to unseen entities. In relation extraction, entitylevel models (Nickel et al., 2011; Garcı́a-Durán et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015; Bordes et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Socher et al., 2013) can handle unseen entity pairs at test time. These models learn representations for the entities instead of entity pairs. Hence, these methods still cannot generalize to predict relations between an entity pair if even one of the entities is unseen. Moreover, Toutanova et al. (2015) and Riedel et al. (2013) observe that the entity pair model outperforms entity models in cases where the entity pair was seen at training time. Since universal schema leverages large amounts of unlabeled text we desire the benefits of entity pair modeling, and row-less universal schema facilitates learning entity pair representations without the drawbacks of the traditional one-embedding-per-pair approach.\nIn this paper we investigate universal schema models without explicit row representations on two tasks: entity type prediction and relation extraction. We use entity type and relation facts from Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) augmented with textual relations and types from Clueweb text (Orr et al., 2013; Gabrilovich et al., 2013). We explore multiple aggregation functions and find that an attention-based aggregation function outperforms several simpler functions and matches a model using explicit row representations with an or-\nder of magnitude fewer parameters. More importantly, we then demonstrate that our ‘row-less’ models accurately predict relations on unseen entity pairs and types on unseen entities. The data and code for all our experiments are available at https://github.com/ patverga/torch-relation-extraction."

      "text" : "Universal schema (Riedel et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2013) relation extraction and entity type prediction is typically modeled as a matrix completion task. In relation extraction, entity pairs and relations occupy the rows and columns of the matrix (Figure 1), while in entity type prediction, entities and types occupy the rows and columns of the matrix (Figure 2). During training, we observe some positive entries in the matrix and at test time, we predict the missing cells in the matrix. This is achieved by decomposing the observed matrix into two low-rank matrices resulting in embeddings for each column entry and each row entry. Test time prediction is performed using the learned low-rank column and row representations.\nLet T be the training set consisting of examples of the form (r, c), where row r ∈ U and column c ∈ V , denote entity pair and relation type in the relation extraction task, while entity and entity type in the entity type prediction task. Let v(r) ∈ Rd and v(c) ∈ Rd be the vector representations or embeddings of row r ∈ U and column c ∈ V that are learned during training. Given a positive example, (r, c) ∈ T in training, the probability of observing the fact is given by,\nP (yr,c = 1) = σ(v(r).v(c)) (1)\nwhere yr,c is a binary random variable that is equal to 1 when (r, c) is a fact and 0 otherwise, and σ is the sigmoid function. The embeddings are learned using Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) (Rendle et al., 2009) in which the probability of the observed triples are ranked above unobserved triples."

      "text" : "While column-less universal schema addresses reasoning over arbitrary textual patterns, it is still limited to reasoning over row entries seen at training time. Verga et al. (2016) use column-less universal schema for relation extraction. They address the problem of unseen row entries by using universal schema as a sentence classifier – directly comparing a textual relation to a KB relation to perform relation extraction. However, this approach is\nunsatisfactory for two reasons. The first is that this creates an inconsistency between training and testing. The model is trained to predict compatibility between rows and columns, but at test time it predicts compatibility between relations directly. Second, it considers only a single piece of evidence in making its prediction.\nWe address both of these concerns in our ‘row-less’ universal schema. Rather than explicitly encoding each row, we encode the row as a learned aggregation over their observed columns (Figure 3). A row contains an entity for type prediction and an entity pair for relation extraction while a column contains a relation type for relation extraction and an entity type for type prediction. A learned row embedding can be seen as a summarization of all columns observed with that particular row. Instead of modeling this summarization as a single embedding, we reconstruct a row representation from an aggregate of its column embeddings, essentially learning a mixture model rather than a single centroid."

      "heading" : "3.2 Aggregation Functions",
      "text" : "In this work we examine four aggregation functions to construct the representations for the row. Let v(.) denote a function that returns the vector representation for rows and columns. To model the probability between row r and column c, we consider the set ¯V (r) which contains the set of column entries that are observed with row r at training time, i.e.,\n∀c̄ ∈ ¯V (r), (r, c̄) ∈ T\nThe first two aggregation functions create a single representation for each row independent of the query. Mean Pool creates a single centroid for the row by averaging all of its column vectors,\nv(r) = ∑\nc̄∈ ¯V (r) v(c̄)\nWhile this formulation intuitively makes sense as an approximation for the explicit row representation, averaging large numbers of embeddings can lead to a noisy representation.\nMax Pool also creates a single representation for the row by taking a dimension-wise max over the observed column vectors:\nv(r)i = maxc̄∈ ¯V (r) v(c̄)i,∀i ∈ 1, 2, . . . , d\nwhere ai denotes the ith dimension of vector a. Both mean pool and max pool are query-independent and form the same representation for the row regardless of the query relation.\nWe also examine two query-specific aggregation functions. These models are more expressive than a single vector forced to to act as a centroid to all possible columns observed with that particular row. For example, the entity pair Bill and Melinda Gates could hold the relation ‘per:spouse’ or ‘per:co-worker’. A query-specific aggregation mechanism can produce separate representations for this entity pair dependent on the query.\nThe Max Relation aggregation function represents the row as its most similar column to the query vector of interest.

This model has the advantage of creating a query-specific entity pair representation, but is more susceptible to noisy training data as a single incorrect piece of evidence could be used to form a prediction.\nFinally, we look at an Attention aggregation function over columns (Figure 4) which is similar to a single-layer memory network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). The soft attention mechanism has been used to selectively focus on relevant parts in many different models (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Graves et al., 2014; Neelakantan et al., 2016).\nIn this model the query is scored with an input representation of each column embedding followed by a softmax, giving a weighting over each relation type. This output is then used to get a weighted sum over a set of output representations for each column resulting in a queryspecific vector representation of the row. Given a query relation c,\nscorec̄ = v(c).v(c̄),∀c̄ ∈ ¯V (r) pc̄ =\nexp(scorec̄)∑ ĉ∈ ¯V (r) exp(scoreĉ)\n,∀c̄ ∈ ¯V (r) v(r) = ∑ c̄∈ ¯V (r) pc̄ × v(c̄)\nThe model pools relevant information over the entire set of observed columns and selects the most salient aspects to the query."

They are appositives extracted from sentences mentioning entities and we select the 5000 most common ones. This results in 140513 unique entities, 1120 Freebase relation types, and 5000 free text relation types.\nAll embeddings are 25 dimensions, randomly initialized. We tune learning rates from {.01, .001}, `2 from {1e-8, 0}, batch size {512, 1024, 2048} and negative samples from {2, 200}.\nFor evaluation, we split the Freebase entity type pairs into 60% train, 20% validation, and 20% test.

      "text" : "We evaluate our models on the FB15k-237 dataset from Toutanova et al. (2015). The data is composed of a small set of 237 Freebase relations and approximately 4 million textual patterns from Clueweb with entities linked to Freebase (Gabrilovich et al., 2013). In past studies, for each (subject, relation, object) test triple, negative examples are generated by replacing the object with all other entities, filtering out triples that are positive in the data set. The positive triple is then ranked among the negatives. In our experiments we limit the possible generated negatives to those entity pairs that have textual mentions in our training set. This way we can evaluate how well the model classifies textual mentions as Freebase relations. We also filter textual patterns with length greater than 35. Our filtered data set contains 2740237 relation types, 2014429 entity pairs, and 176476 tokens. We report the percentage of positive triples ranked in the top 10 amongst their negatives as well as the MRR scaled by 100.\nModels are tuned to maximize mean reciprocal rank (MRR) on the validation set with early stopping. The entity pair model used a batch size 1024, `2 = 1e-8, = 1e4, and learning rate 0.01. The aggregation models all used batch size 4096, `2 = 0, = 1e-8, and learning rate 0.01. Each use 200 negative samples except for max pool which performed better with two negative samples The column vectors are initialized with the columns learned by the entity pair model. Randomly initializing the query encoders and tying the output and attention encoders performed better and all results use this method. All models are trained with embedding dimension 25.\nOur results are shown in Table 6. We can see that the models with query specific aggregation functions give the same results as models with explicit entity pair representations. The max-model performs competitively with the attention model which is not entirely surprising as it is a simplified version of the attention model. Further, the attention model reduces to the max-relation model for entity pairs with only a single observed relation type. In our data, 64.8% of entity pairs have only a single observed relation type and 80.9% have 1 or 2 observed relation types.\nWe also explore the models’ abilities to predict on unseen entity pairs (Table 7). We remove all training examples that contain a positive entity pair in either our validation or test set. We use the same validation and test set as in Table 6. The entity pair model predicts random relations as it is unable to make predictions on unseen entity pairs. The query-independent aggregation functions, mean pool and max pool, perform better than models with explicit entity pair representations. Again, query specific aggregation functions get the best results, with the attention model performing slightly better than the max-relation model.\nThe two experiments indicate that we can train relation extraction models without explicit entity pair representations that perform as well as models with explicit representations. We also find that models with query specific aggregation functions predict relations for unseen entity pairs without drop in accuracy compared to predicting relations for seen entity pairs."

These models learn compositional pattern encoders to parameterize the column matrix in place of directly embeddings. Compositional universal schema facilitates more compact sharing of statistics by composing similar patterns from the same sequence of word embeddings – the text patterns ‘lives in the city’ and ‘lives in the city of’ no longer exist as distinct atomic units. More importantly, compositional universal schema can thus generalize to all possible textual patterns, facilitating reasoning over arbitrary text at test time.\nThe column-less universal schema model generalizes to all possible input textual relations and the row-less model generalizes to all entities and entity pairs, whether seen at train time or not. We can combine these two approaches together to make an universal schema model that generalizes to unseen rows and columns.\nThe parse path between the two entities in the sentence is encoded with an LSTM model. We use a single layer model with 100 dimensional token embeddings initialized randomly. To prevent exploding gradients, we clip them to norm 10 while all the other hyperparameters are tuned the same way as before. We follow the same evaluation protocol from 5.2.\nThe results of this experiment with observed rows are shown in Table 8. While both the MRR and Hits@10 metrics increase for models with explicit row representations, the row-less models show an improvement only on the Hits@10 metric. The MRR of the query dependent row-less models is still competitive with the model\nwith explicit row representation even though they have far fewer parameters to fit the data.\nTable shows the performance on the test set with unseen entity pairs.

This prediction is typically modeled as a matrix completion problem, with one type per column, and either one or two entities per row (in the case of entity types or binary relation types, respectively). Factorizing this sparsely observed matrix yields a learned vector embedding for each row and each column. In this paper we explore the problem of making predictions for entities or entity-pairs unseen at training time (and hence without a pre-learned row embedding). We propose an approach having no per-row parameters at all; rather we produce a row vector on the fly using a learned aggregation function of the vectors of the observed columns for that row. We experiment with various aggregation functions, including neural network attention models. Our approach can be understood as a natural language database, in that questions about KB entities are answered by attending to textual or database evidence. In experiments predicting both relations and entity types, we demonstrate that despite having an order of magnitude fewer parameters than traditional universal schema, we can match the accuracy of the traditional model, and more importantly, we can now make predictions about unseen rows with nearly the same accuracy as rows available at training time.",
