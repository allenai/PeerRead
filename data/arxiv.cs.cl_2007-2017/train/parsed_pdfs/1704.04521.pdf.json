      "text" : "Neural machine translation (NMT), a new approach to solving machine translation, has achieved promising results (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Jean et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015a; Luong et al., 2015b). An NMT system builds a simple large neural network that reads the entire input source sentence and generates an output translation. The entire neural network is jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a correct translation of a source sentence with a bilingual corpus. Although NMT offers many advantages over traditional phrase-based approaches, such as a small memory footprint and simple decoder implementation, conventional NMT is limited when it comes to larger vocabularies. This is because the training complexity and decoding complexity proportionally increase with the number of target words. Words that are out of vocabulary are represented by a single unknown token in translations, as illustrated in Figure 1. The problem becomes more serious when translating patent documents, which contain several newly introduced technical terms.\nThere have been a number of related studies that address the vocabulary limitation of NMT systems. Jean el al. (2014) provided an efficient approximation to the softmax to accommodate a very large vocabulary in an NMT system. Luong et al. (2015b) proposed annotating the occurrences of a target unknown word token with positional information to track its alignments, after which they replace the tokens with their translations using simple word dictionary lookup or identity copy. Li et al. (2016) proposed to replace out-of-vocabulary words with similar in-vocabulary words based on a similarity model learnt from monolingual data. Sennrich et al. (2016) introduced an effective approach based on encoding rare and unknown words as sequences of subword units. Luong and Manning (2016) provided a character-level\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n04 52\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n4 A\npr 2\n01 7\nand word-level hybrid NMT model to achieve an open vocabulary, and Costa-jussà and Fonollosa (2016) proposed a NMT system based on character-based embeddings.\nHowever, these previous approaches have limitations when translating patent sentences. This is because their methods only focus on addressing the problem of unknown words even though the words are parts of technical terms. It is obvious that a technical term should be considered as one word that comprises components that always have different meanings and translations when they are used alone. An example is shown in Figure1, wherein Japanese word “ ”(bridge) should be translated to Chinese word “ ” when included in technical term “bridge interface”; however, it is always translated as “ ”.\nIn this paper, we propose a method that enables NMT to translate patent sentences with a large vocabulary of technical terms. We use an NMT model similar to that used by Sutskever et al. (2014), which uses a deep long short-term memories (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to encode the input sentence and a separate deep LSTM to output the translation. We train the NMT model on a bilingual corpus in which the technical terms are replaced with technical term tokens; this allows it to translate most of the source sentences except technical terms. Similar to Sutskever et al. (2014), we use it as a decoder to translate source sentences with technical term tokens and replace the tokens with technical term translations using statistical machine translation (SMT). We also use it to rerank the 1,000-best SMT translations on the basis of the average of the SMT and NMT scores of the translated sentences that have been rescored with the technical term tokens. Our experiments on Japanese-Chinese patent sentences show that our proposed NMT system achieves a substantial improvement of up to 3.1 BLEU points and 2.3 RIBES points over a traditional SMT system and an improvement of approximately 0.6 BLEU points and 0.8 RIBES points over an equivalent NMT system without our proposed technique."

From the collected documents, we extracted 312,492 patent families, and the method of Utiyama and Isahara (2007) was applied1 to the text of the extracted patent families to align the Japanese and Chinese sentences. The Japanese sentences were segmented into a sequence of morphemes using the Japanese morphological analyzer MeCab2 with the morpheme lexicon IPAdic,3 and the Chinese sentences were segmented into a sequence of words using the Chinese morphological analyzer Stanford Word Segment (Tseng et al., 2005) trained using the Chinese Penn Treebank.

Given a source sentence x = (x1, . . . , xN ) and target sentence y = (y1, . . . , yM ), an NMT system uses a neural network to parameterize the conditional distributions\np(yl | y<l,x)\nfor 1 ≤ l ≤ M . Consequently, it becomes possible to compute and maximize the log probability of the target sentence given the source sentence\nlog p(y | x) = M∑ l=1 log p(yl|y<l,x) (1)\nIn this paper, we use an NMT model similar to that used by Sutskever et al. (2014). It uses two separate deep LSTMs to encode the input sequence and output the translation. The encoder, which is implemented as a recurrent neural network, reads the source sentence one word at a time and then encodes it into a large vector that represents the entire source sentence. The decoder, another recurrent neural network, generates a translation on the basis of the encoded vector one word at a time.\nOne important difference between our NMT model and the one used by Sutskever et al. (2014) is that we added an attention mechanism. Recently, Bahdanau et al. (2015) proposed an attention mechanism, a form of random access memory, to help NMT cope with long input sequences. Luong et al. (2015a) proposed an attention mechanism for different scoring functions in order to compare the source and target hidden states as well as different strategies for placing the attention. In this paper, we utilize the attention mechanism proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2015), wherein each output target word is predicted on the basis of not only a recurrent hidden state and the previously predicted word but also a context vector computed as the weighted sum of the hidden states."

      "text" : "Figure 2 illustrates the procedure of the training model with parallel patent sentence pairs, wherein technical terms are replaced with technical term tokens “TT1”, “TT2”, . . ..\nIn the step 1 of Figure 2, we align the Japanese technical terms, which are automatically extracted from the Japanese sentences, with their Chinese translations in the Chinese sentences.5 Here, we introduce the following two steps to identify technical term pairs in the bilingual Japanese-Chinese corpus:\n1. According to the approach proposed by Dong et al. (2015), we identify Japanese-Chinese technical term pairs using an SMT phrase translation table. Given a parallel sentence pair 〈SJ , SC〉 containing a Japanese technical term tJ , the Chinese translation candidates collected from the phrase translation table are matched against the Chinese sentence SC of the parallel sentence pair. Of those found in SC , tC with the largest translation probability P (tC | tJ) is selected, and the bilingual technical term pair 〈tJ , tC〉 is identified.\n4 In this paper, we focus on the task of translating patent sentences with a large vocabulary of technical terms using the NMT system, where we ignore the translation task of patent sentences that are longer than 40 morphemes in Japanese side or longer than 40 words in Chinese side.\n5 In this work, we approximately regard all the Japanese compound nouns as Japanese technical terms. These Japanese compound nouns are automatically extracted by simply concatenating a sequence of morphemes whose parts of speech are either nouns, prefixes, suffixes, unknown words, numbers, or alphabetical characters. Here, morpheme sequences starting or ending with certain prefixes are inappropriate as Japanese technical terms and are excluded. The sequences that include symbols or numbers are also excluded. In Chinese side, on the other hand, we regard Chinese translations of extracted Japanese compound nouns as Chinese technical terms, where we do not regard other Chinese phrases as technical terms.\n2. For the Japanese technical terms whose Chinese translations are not included in the results of Step 1, we then use an approach based on SMT word alignment. Given a parallel sentence pair 〈SJ , SC〉 containing a Japanese technical term tJ , a sequence of Chinese words is selected using SMT word alignment, and we use the Chinese translation tC for the Japanese technical term tJ .6\nAs shown in the step 2 of Figure 2, in each of Japanese-Chinese parallel patent sentence pairs, occurrences of technical term pairs 〈t 1J , t1C〉, 〈t2J , t2C〉, . . ., 〈tkJ , tkC〉 are then replaced with technical term tokens 〈TT1, TT1〉, 〈TT2, TT2〉, . . ., 〈TTk, TTk〉. Technical term pairs 〈t1J , t1C〉, 〈t2J , t2C〉, . . ., 〈tkJ , tkC〉 are numbered in the order of occurrence of Japanese technical terms t iJ (i = 1, 2, . . . , k) in each Japanese sentence SJ . Here, note that in all the parallel sentence pairs 〈SJ , SC〉, technical term tokens “TT1”, “TT2”, . . . that are identical throughout all the parallel sentence pairs are used in this procedure. Therefore, for example, in all the Japanese patent sentences SJ , the Japanese technical term t 1J which appears earlier than other Japanese technical terms in SJ is replaced with TT1. We then train the NMT system on a bilingual corpus, in which the technical term pairs is replaced by “TTi” (i = 1, 2, . . .) tokens, and obtain an NMT model in which the technical terms are represented as technical term tokens.7"

In the step 1 of Figure 3, when given an input Japanese sentence, we first automatically extract the technical terms and replace them with the technical term tokens “TTi” (i = 1, 2, . . .). Consequently, we have an input sentence in which the technical term tokens “TTi” (i = 1, 2, . . .) represent the positions of the technical terms and a list of extracted Japanese technical terms. Next, as shown in the step 2-N of Figure 3, the source Japanese sentence with technical term tokens is translated using the NMT model trained according to the procedure described in Section 4.1, whereas the extracted Japanese technical terms are translated using an SMT phrase translation table in the step 2-S of Figure 3.8 Finally, in the step 3, we replace the technical term tokens “TTi” (i = 1, 2, . . .) of the sentence translation with SMT the technical term translations.\n6 We discard discontinuous sequences and only use continuous ones. 7 We treat the NMT system as a black box, and the strategy we present in this paper could be applied to any NMT system (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a). 8 We use the translation with the highest probability in the phrase translation table.

Next, in the step 2, we then replace the technical terms in the translation sentences with technical term tokens “TTi” (i = 1, 2, 3, . . .), which must be the same with the tokens of their source Japanese technical terms in the input Japanese sentence. The technique used for aligning Japanese technical terms with their Chinese translations is the same as that described in Section 4.1. In the step 3 of Figure 4, the 1,000- best translations, in which technical terms are represented as tokens, are rescored using the NMT model trained according to the procedure described in Section 4.1. Given a Japanese sentence SJ and its 1,000- best Chinese translations S nC (n = 1, 2, . . . , 1, 000) translated by the SMT system, NMT score of each translation sentence pair 〈SJ , SnC〉 is computed as the log probability log p(SnC | SJ) of Equation (1). Finally, we rerank the 1,000-best translation list on the basis of the average SMT and NMT scores and output the translation with the highest final score."

Further training details are given below:\n• All of the LSTM’s parameter were initialized with a uniform distribution ranging between -0.06 and 0.06.\n• We set the size of a minibatch to 128.\n• We used the stochastic gradient descent, beginning at a learning rate of 0.5. We computed the perplexity of the development set using the currently produced NMT model after every 1,500 minibatches were trained and multiplied the learning rate by 0.99 when the perplexity did not decrease with respect to the last three perplexities. We trained our model for a total of 10 epoches.\n• Similar to Sutskever et al.

The training time was around two days when using the described parameters on an 1-GPU machine.\n9 There are also Japanese technical terms (3% of all the extracted terms) for which Chinese translations can be identified using neither the SMT phrase translation table nor the SMT word alignment.\n10 https://www.tensorflow.org/"

      "heading" : "5.3 Evaluation Results",
      "text" : "We calculated automatic evaluation scores for the translation results using two popular metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and RIBES (Isozaki et al., 2010). As shown in Table 1, we report the evaluation scores, on the basis of the translations by Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), as the baseline SMT11 and the scores based on translations produced by the equivalent NMT system without our proposed approach as the baseline NMT. As shown in Table 1, the two versions of the proposed NMT systems clearly improve the translation quality when compared with the baselines. When compared with the baseline SMT, the performance gain of the proposed system is approximately 3.1 BLEU points if translations are produced by the proposed NMT system of Section 4.3 or 2.3 RIBES points if translations are produced by the proposed NMT system of Section 4.2. When compared with the result of decoding with the baseline NMT, the proposed NMT system of Section 4.2 achieved performance gains of 0.8 RIBES points. When compared with the result of reranking with the baseline NMT, the proposed NMT system of Section 4.3 can still achieve performance gains of 0.6 BLEU points. Moreover, when the output translations produced by NMT decoding and SMT technical term translation described in Section 4.2 with the output translations produced by decoding with the baseline NMT, the number of unknown tokens included in output translations reduced from 191 to 92. About 90% of remaining unknown tokens correspond to numbers, English words, abbreviations, and symbols.12\nIn this study, we also conducted two types of human evaluation according to the work of Nakazawa et al. (2015): pairwise evaluation and JPO adequacy evaluation. During the procedure of pairwise evaluation, we compare each of translations produced by the baseline SMT with that produced by the two versions of the proposed NMT systems, and judge which translation is better, or whether they are with comparable quality. The score of pairwise evaluation is defined by the following formula, where W\n11 We train the SMT system on the same training set and tune it with development set. 12 In addition to the two versions of the proposed NMT systems presented in Section 4, we evaluated a modified version of the propsed NMT system, where we introduce another type of token corresponding to unknown compound nouns and integrate this type of token with the technical term token in the procedure of training the NMT model. We achieved a slightly improved translation performance, BLEU/RIBES scores of 55.6/90.9 for the proposed NMT system of Section 4.2 and those of 55.7/89.5 for the proposed NMT system of Section 4.3.\nis the number of better translations compared to the baseline SMT, L the number of worse translations compared to the baseline SMT, and T the number of translations having their quality comparable to those produced by the baseline SMT:\nscore = 100× W − L W + L+ T\nThe score of pairwise evaluation ranges from −100 to 100. In the JPO adequacy evaluation, Chinese translations are evaluated according to the quality evaluation criterion for translated patent documents proposed by the Japanese Patent Office (JPO).13 The JPO adequacy criterion judges whether or not the technical factors and their relationships included in Japanese patent sentences are correctly translated into Chinese, and score Chinese translations on the basis of the percentage of correctly translated information, where the score of 5 means all of those information are translated correctly, while that of 1 means most of those information are not translated correctly. The score of the JPO adequacy evaluation is defined as the average over the whole test sentences. Unlike the study conducted Nakazawa et al. (Nakazawa et al., 2015), we randomly selected 200 sentence pairs from the test set for human evaluation, and both human evaluations were conducted using only one judgement. Table 2 shows the results of the human evaluation for the baseline SMT, the baseline NMT, and the proposed NMT system. We observed that the proposed system achieved the best performance for both pairwise evaluation and JPO adequacy evaluation when we replaced technical term tokens with SMT technical term translations after decoding the source sentence with technical term tokens.\nThroughout Figure 5∼Figure 7, we show an identical source Japanese sentence and each of its translations produced by the two versions of the proposed NMT systems, compared with translations produced by the three baselines, respectively. Figure 5 shows an example of correct translation produced by the proposed system in comparison to that produced by the baseline SMT. In this example, our model correctly translates the Japanese sentence into Chinese, whereas the translation by the baseline SMT is a translation error with several erroneous syntactic structures. As shown in Figure 6, the second example highlights that the proposed NMT system of Section 4.2 can correctly translate the Japanese technical term “ ”(laminated wafer) to the Chinese technical term “ ”. The translation by the baseline NMT is a translation error because of not only the erroneously translated unknown token but also the Chinese word “ ”, which is not appropriate as a component of a Chinese technical term. Another example is shown in Figure 7, where we compare the translation of a reranking SMT 1,000-best translation produced by the proposed NMT system with that produced by reranking with the baseline NMT. It is interesting to observe that compared with the baseline NMT, we obtain a better translation when we rerank the 1,000-best SMT translations using the proposed NMT system, in which technical term\n13 https://www.jpo.go.jp/shiryou/toushin/chousa/pdf/tokkyohonyaku_hyouka/01.pdf (in Japanese)\ntokens represent technical terms. It is mainly because the correct Chinese translation “ ”(wafter) of Japanese word “ ” is out of the 40K NMT vocabulary (Chinese), causing reranking with the baseline NMT to produce the translation with an erroneous construction of “noun phrase of noun phrase of noun phrase”. As shown in Figure 7, the proposed NMT system of Section 4.3 produced the translation with a correct construction, mainly because Chinese word “ ”(wafter) is a part of Chinese technical term “ ”(laminated wafter) and is replaced with a technical term token and then rescored by the NMT model (with technical term tokens “TT1”, “TT2”, . . .)."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we proposed an NMT method capable of translating patent sentences with a large vocabulary of technical terms. We trained an NMT system on a bilingual corpus, wherein technical terms are replaced with technical term tokens; this allows it to translate most of the source sentences except the technical terms. Similar to Sutskever et al. (2014), we used it as a decoder to translate the source sentences with technical term tokens and replace the tokens with technical terms translated using SMT. We also used it to rerank the 1,000-best SMT translations on the basis of the average of the SMT score and that of NMT rescoring of translated sentences with technical term tokens. For the translation of Japanese patent sentences, we observed that our proposed NMT system performs better than the phrase-based SMT system as well as the equivalent NMT system without our proposed approach.\nOne of our important future works is to evaluate our proposed method in the NMT system proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2015), which introduced a bidirectional recurrent neural network as encoder and is the state-of-the-art of pure NMT system recently. However, the NMT system proposed by Bahdanau et\nal. (2015) also has a limitation in addressing out-of-vocabulary words. Our proposed NMT system is expected to improve the translation performance of patent sentences by applying approach of Bahdanau et al. (2015). Another important future work is to quantitatively compare our study with the work of Luong et al. (2015b). In the work of Luong et al. (2015b), they replace low frequency single words and translate them in a post-processing Step using a dictionary, while we propose to replace the whole technical terms and post-translate them with phrase translation table of SMT system. Therefore, our proposed NMT system is expected to be appropriate to translate patent documents which contain many technical terms comprised of multiple words and should be translated together. We will also evaluate the present study by reranking the n-best translations produced by the proposed NMT system on the basis of their SMT rescoring. Next, we will rerank translations from both the n-best SMT translations and n-best NMT translations. As shown in Section 5.3, the decoding approach of our proposed NMT system achieved the best RIBES performance and human evaluation scores in our experiments, whereas the reranking approach achieved the best performance with respect to BLEU. A translation with the highest average SMT and NMT scores of the n-best translations produced by NMT and SMT, respectively, is expected to be an effective translation."

    "abstractText" : "Neural machine translation (NMT), a new approach to machine translation, has achieved promising results comparable to those of traditional approaches such as statistical machine translation (SMT). Despite its recent success, NMT cannot handle a larger vocabulary because training complexity and decoding complexity proportionally increase with the number of target words. This problem becomes even more serious when translating patent documents, which contain many technical terms that are observed infrequently. In NMTs, words that are out of vocabulary are represented by a single unknown token. In this paper, we propose a method that enables NMT to translate patent sentences comprising a large vocabulary of technical terms. We train an NMT system on bilingual data wherein technical terms are replaced with technical term tokens; this allows it to translate most of the source sentences except technical terms. Further, we use it as a decoder to translate source sentences with technical term tokens and replace the tokens with technical term translations using SMT. We also use it to rerank the 1,000-best SMT translations on the basis of the average of the SMT score and that of the NMT rescoring of the translated sentences with technical term tokens. Our experiments on Japanese-Chinese patent sentences show that the proposed NMT system achieves a substantial improvement of up to 3.1 BLEU points and 2.3 RIBES points over traditional SMT systems and an improvement of approximately 0.6 BLEU points and 0.8 RIBES points over an equivalent NMT system without our proposed technique.",
