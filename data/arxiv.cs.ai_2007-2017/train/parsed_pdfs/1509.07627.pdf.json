      "text" : "Over the past few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly improved from the standpoint of the network architectures needed to facilitate recognition accuracy and to reduce processing costs [15]. Currently, CNNs are primarily used to help users understand objects and scenes in an image. In our study, we applied a CNN to an ImageNet dataset containing over 1.4 million images and 1,000 object categories [13]. Use of such a large-scale dataset allows us to model a wide variety of object recognition image features. By using the pre-trained ImageNet dataset model, we found that CNN is capable of presenting significantly more effective feature variations.\nFor feature extraction, Donahue et al. employed CNN features as a feature vector by combining those features with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier [1], while other researchers have evaluated and visualized CNN features with an eight-layer AlexNet architecture [9]. More recent architectures utilize deep structures, such as the\nvery deep convolutional network (VGGNet) [16] and GoogLeNet [17], which were developed by Oxford University’s Visual Geometry Group and Google Inc., respectively.\nAccording to He et al. [5], the most important CNN feature is deep architecture. Along this line, the VGGNet contains 16 to 19 layers and GoogLeNet utilizes 22 layers. VGGNet is frequently used in the computer vision field, not only in full scratch neural net models, but also as a feature generator. CNN’s utility as a feature generator is also important because it can function well even if only a few learning samples are available. Thus, large-scale databases such as ImageNet can provide recognition rates that outperform human-level classification (e.g., [6, 14]). However, this performance will fluctuate depending on the amount and variance of the data. Therefore, when CNN is used for feature generation, it provides better performance for some recognition problems than others.\nDonahue et al. argued that usage should be limited to the last two layers before output, which are extracted from first and second fully connected layers in CNN features with AlexNet. However, we believe that more detailed evaluations should be undertaken since several different architectures have recently been proposed, and because middle layers have not been examined as feature descriptors. Accordingly, in this study, we performed more detailed experiments to evaluate two famous CNN architectures – AlexNet and VGGNet. In addition, we carried out simple tuning for feature concatenation (e.g., layer 3 + layer 5 + layer 7) and transformations (e.g., principal component analysis: PCA).\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, related works are listed. The feature settings are evaluated in Section 3. The results are shown in Section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5."

      "text" : "In the time since the neocognitron was first proposed by Fukushima [3], neuron-based recognition has become one of the most commonly used neural network architectures.\nFollowing that study, the LeNet-5 [10] neocognitron model added a baseline to CNNs in order to create a more significant model. Current network architectures include standard structures such as multiple fully connected layers, while recent challengers employ pre-trained [7], dropout [8], and rectified linear units (ReLU) [12] as improved learning models. The most outstanding computer vision result was obtained by AlexNet in the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC2012), which remains the image recognition leader, with 1,000 classes [9].\nAlexNet made it possible to increase the number of layers in network architectures. For example, Krizhevsky et al. implemented an eight-layer model that includes convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. More recent variations, such as the 16- or 19-layer VGGNet [16], and the 22-layer GoogLeNet [17] models, have even deeper architectures. These deeper models outperform conventional models on the ILSVRC dataset [13]. More specifically, when compared to the AlexNet (top-five error rate on the ILSVRC2012: 16.4%), deeper models achieved better performance levels with GoogLeNet and VGGNet (top-five error rate on the ILSVRC2014: 6.7% for GoogLeNet and 7.3% for VGGNet). Currently, the object detection problem is one of the most important topics in computer vision. The existing state-of-the-art framework, regions with convolutional neural networks (R-CNN), was proposed by Girshick et al. [4]. This framework consists of two steps during which (i) object areas are extracted as object proposals, and (ii) CNN recognition is performed. Those authors adopted selective search [18] as an object proposal approach and\nVGGNet for the CNN architecture. However, while they restricted the object detection and recognition tasks to fully connected CNN features, we believe that the features of the other layers should be more carefully evaluated in order to determine whether they could provide more accurate recognition and detection."

We believe that while the evaluation itself is very important, particular attention must be paid to tunings such as concatenation and feature transformation. Basically, deep learning architectures are based on their approaches.\nFeature setting. We begin by extracting the middle and deeper layers. Layers 3–7 of AlexNet and VGGNet are shown in Figure 1. Next, we extract each max-pooling layer (layers 3–5), and the last two fully connected layers (layers 6 and 7) in VGGNet.\nConcatenation and transformation. Next, we concatenate neighboring or one-step layers such as layer-3,4,5 and layer-3,5,7. In feature transformation, we simply apply PCA, which is set at 1,500 dimensions in this experiment.\nClassifier. In the next step, we apply deep learning features and SVM for object recognition. The parameters are based on DeCAF [1]."

      "text" : "ferences between VGGNet (91.8%) and AlexNet (78.37%). From the above results, it can be seen that features obtained from fully connected layers do not always provide the highest performance rates during recognition and detection tasks, and that middle-layer features are more flexible for some tasks. We also found that fully connected layers or max-pooling layers located near fully connected layers tend to perform better in general object recognition tasks, such as the Caltech 101 dataset.\nThe main difference between AlexNet and VGGNet is the architecture depth. Additionally, VGGNet assigns very small 3 × 3 convolutional kernels against the 7 × 7 (Conv 1), 5 × 5 (Conv 2), and 3 × 3 (others) kernels in AlexNet. The settings refrain the feature representation.\nThe classification results of concatenated vectors are shown in Table 1 and 2. Here, it can be seen that concatenation of VGGNet layer-5,6,7 provides the highest levels of accuracy for both datasets. The rates are 99.38% on the Daimler dataset and 92.00% on the Caltech 101 dataset. For AlexNet, layer-3,4,5 and layer-3,5,7 achieved top performance rates on those datasets. The results show that combining features of the convolutional and fully connected layers provides better performance. It is especially noteworthy that VGGNet layer 5, which is near the fully connected layer, provides significantly high levels of feature extraction from an image patch."
