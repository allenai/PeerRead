      "text" : "Large and balanced datasets are normally crucial for learning classifiers. In real-world scenarios, however, one always struggles to find adequate amounts of labeled data. Even with the help of crowdsourcing, e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), it is often difficult to collect a large quantity of labeled instances with high quality that is necessary for training a classifier for a real-world problem. In terms of quantity, it has been shown that the amount of available training data, per object class, roughly follows a Zipf distribution [35]. That means a small number of object classes account for most of the available training instances. In terms of quality, some domains, such as the analysis of satellite images (e.g. the comet images from Rosetta), require extensive and detailed expert user annotation [32], [48]. Large volume of LiDAR point cloud data have to be labeled before they can be used to train some classifiers [49]. Such labeling process usually is very time consuming and requires expert-level labeling efforts or expensive equipments. Practically only a very limited portion of the data points can be obtained.\nTo solve the problem of lacking enough training samples, attributes [22], [30], [13] have been introduced to transfer the knowledge held by majority classes to instances in minority classes. Nevertheless, for certain tasks, such shared attributes [14], [12], [25], [10], [46] may simply be unavailable or nontrivial to define. In contrast, rather than using such a ‘learning to learn’ [38] framework, humans can generalize and associate the similar patterns from images. This ability inspires us to circumvent the problem of lacking enough training data and solve it from a different angle: utilizing the synthetic\n• Xi Zhang, Andi Zang, and Gady Agam are with the Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago, IL 60616.

For example, cognitive psychology studied a case that an infant learns to understand and imitate a facial expression from parents’ examples. In the computing domain, exemplar SVM [26] tries to associate images with training exemplars. Different from these previous works, we create synthetic images to associate them with the real images whilst previous works associate ‘new’ real data with ‘old’ real data. By contrast, our approach is a ’free lunch’ in the sense that the proposed approach does not need any human annotation of real data, thus we could easily amplify the dataset used in training.\nLearning a classifier from synthetic data is unfortunately extremely challenging due to the following reasons. Firstly, the feature distribution of synthetic data generated will shift away from that of real data. Such distribution shift is termed synthetic gap and illustrated in Fig 2. The synthetic gap is a major obstacle in using synthetic data to help learning classifiers, since synthetic data may fail to simulate the potential useful patterns of real data for training classifiers. To our knowledge, this synthetic gap problem has never been formally\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n03 16\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n1 M\nar 2\n01 5\n2 −60 −40 −20 0 20 40 60 −60 −40 −20 0 20 40 60 80 Real Synthetic −80 −60 −40 −20 0 20 40 60 −60 −40 −20 0 20 40 60 Real Synthetic\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2. t-SNE visulization of synthetic gap using the data from SRC dataset.

Secondly, since practically a small amount of labeled images may be available, it is necessary to jointly learn from synthetic and real data. The learning process must be automatically leveraged between synthetic data and real data.\nTo better learn a classifier from synthetic data, we propose a novel framework –Multichannel Autoencoder (MCAE) which is an extension of sparse autoencoder. The training step of MCAE is a process of bridging the synthetic gap between the real and the synthetic data by learning the mapping from (1) synthetic to real data and (2) real to real data. Critically, such mapping try to keep the real data while enforce MCAE to learn a transfer from the synthetic data to the real data. We thus can generate more synthetic data which will simulate the real data when the learned mapping is applied to them.\nTo facilitate the study on satellite image analysis, we introduce a new benchmark satellite roof classification (SRC) image dataset. The SRC dataset needs expertlevel labeling and has unique challenges, such as satellite image blurring, building shadows, and extremely imbalanced roof class instances. To demonstrate the generality of the proposed approach, we use an additional handwritten digit dataset from the UCI machine learning repository [1]. In both datasets, synthetic data is generated using a parametric model of derived from real data that roughly mimics real data in terms of appearances and basic structure. Experimental results using these datasets demonstrate that better classification results can be obtained by training a classifier using the synthetic data when used by the proposed approach.\nWe thus highlight three contributions in this paper: (1) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address the problem of synthetic gap, by solving which we demonstrate that the synthetic data could be used to improve the performance of classifiers. (2) We propose a Multichannel Autoencoder (MCAE) model to bridge the synthetic gap and jointly learn from both real and synthetic data. (3) Also, a novel benchmark dataset – Satellite Roof Classification (SRC) is introduced to the vision community. Such dataset is of expert-level label annotations as well as great challenges for satellite image analysis."

      "text" : "3D image analysis. Synthetic data has been used for several 3D image analysis applications, but not for helping learn classifiers. A large number of synthetic 3D meshes in [47] were created by a series of mesh editing steps including subdivision, simplification, smooth, adding noise and Poisson reconstruction, in order to automatically evaluate the subjective visual quality of a 3D object. Recently, to circumvent the point labeling difficulty in a building roof classification problem using LiDAR point cloud, [49] explicitly indicated semantic roof points on synthetically created roof point clouds and compute point features from the synthetic point clouds. Techniques such as point cloud resampling, size normalization and mesh erosion are employed to reduce the differences between real roof and synthetic ones in data space.\nGenerating synthetic data. Previous method generate synthetic data in data space using tools including geometrical transformation and degradation models: In [40][41], to help off-line recognition of handwritten text, a perturbation model combined with morphological operation is applied to real data. They showed that when a moderate transformation is added to the real data, the resulting synthetic training set boost the performance. To enhance the quality of degraded document, in [2] degradation models such as brightness degradation, blurring degradation, noise degradation and textureblending degradation were used to create a training dataset for a handwritten text recognition problem. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) [8] and its variants [19][20] are also powerful methods that have shown many success in various applications. However, these previous methods are relatively limited to one particular type of dataset, whilst we propose a more general methodology of generating synthetic data in this paper. We show that our methodology can be used both for SRC and handwritten digits dataset.\nTransfer Learning aims to extract the knowledge from one or more source tasks and applies the knowledge to a target task. Transfer learning has been found helpful in many real world problems, such as in sentiment classification [6], web page classification [36] and zeroshot classification of image and video data [23], [22], [16], [45], [15], [17], [33], [34], [37]. Transfer learning is categorized to three classes [31]: inductive transfer learning, transductive transfer learning and unsupervised transfer learning. The work in this paper falls into a framework of domain adaptation [4], [44] in the transductive transfer learning. Nonetheless, different from previous domain adaptation tasks of different source and target domains, the synthetic gap is caused by the shifted feature distribution of synthetic data from real data. To solve this problem, our MCAE is developed from the idea of autoencoder.\nAutoencoder is one type of neural network and its output vectors have the same dimensionality as the\n3 input vectors [42]. The hidden representation obtained by training a sparse autoencoder followed by a parameters fine tuning is useful in pre-training a deeper neural network. Recently autoencoder with its different variants [9], [18] also exhibit the success in learning and transferring sharing knowledge among data source from different domains [3], [5], [11], thus benefit other machine learning tasks."

      "text" : "In this section, we introduce the MCAE model as illustrated in Fig. 3. It can (1) bridge synthetic gap by minimizing the discrepancy between real and synthetic data; and (2) preserve and emphasize the potential useful patterns existed in both real and synthetic data in order to generate the better feature representations used for learning classifiers.\nEssentially, synthetic and real data should have similar patterns, a natural idea of bridging synthetic gap is to learning a mapping from the synthetic data to the real data using an autoencoder, and vice versa. MCAE, hence, provides a more flexible way to learn this mapping due to the specific structure of the MCAE. There are two channels in MCAE, left one and right one. Each channel basically is an SAE, however, two channels share the same hidden layer. With this structure, MCAE basically learns two tasks in the same time. By setting different types of input and out data such as the one in denoising autoencoder [43], MCAE is capable for many applications. In our work, to bridge the gap between synthetic data and real data, we set the task in left channel as one that takes synthetic data as input and real data as reconstruction target, while the task in right channel use real data in both input and reconstrution target. This configuration actually is essentially meaningful that by keeping the reconstruction target identical in two channels, MCAE attempts to transform inputs in two channels towards the same target, thus minimize the discrepancy between two input dataset which are synthetic data and real data in our work."

      "text" : "Our MCAE is built on the sparse autoencoder (SAE). A basic autoencoder is a fully connected neural network with one hidden layer and can be decomposed into two parts: an encoding and a decoding process. Assume an input dataset with n instances X = {xi}ni=1 where xi ∈ Rm and m is the dimension of each instance. Encoding typically transforms input data to hidden layer representation using an affine mapping squashed by a sigmoid function:\nhe(xi) = f(Wexi + be) (1)\nwhere f(·) is a sigmoid function and θe = {We, be}, We ∈ Rk×m, be ∈ Rk is a set of unknown parameters in encoding with k nodes in hidden layer.\nθe\nθd L\nθd R\ntask one task two\nE ncoding\nD ecoding\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3. (a) Illustration of the proposed MCAE model in a stacked autoencoder structure, where black edge between two layers are linked to and shared by two tasks, red and blue links are separately connected to left and right task respectively. (b) A zoom in structure of MCAE.\nWhile in decoding, with parameters θd = {Wd, bd}, Wd ∈ Rm×k, bd ∈ Rm, autoencoder attempts to reconstruct the input data at the output layer by imposing another affine mapping followed by nonlinearity to hidden representation he(xi):\nhd(xi) = f(Wdhe(xi) + bd) (2)\nIn above equation hd(xi) is viewed as a reconstruction of input xi. Normally, we impose hd(xi) ≈ xi. Here xi play a role of reconstruction target in this expression and we use notation 〈i:Xi, t:Xi〉 to denote the configuration of input data short for i and reconstruction target short for t in an autoencoder. Xs and Xr indicate synthetic and real data respectively. By minimizing the reconstruction errors of all data instances, we have following objective function:\nJ(θe, θd) = 1\nn n∑ i=1 (hd(xi)− xi)2 + λW (3)\nwhere W = ( ∑ W 2e + ∑ W 2d )/2 is a weight decay term added to improve generalization of the autoencoder and λ leverages the importance of this term.\nTo avoid learning identity mapping in autoencoder, a regularization term Θ = ∑k i=1 δlog\nδ δ̂i + (1− δ)log 1−δ 1−δ̂i\nthat penalizes over-activation of the nodes in the hidden layer is added. δ is a sparsity parameter and is set by users and δ̂i = 1k ∑k i=1 he(xi).\nJ(θe, θd) = 1\nn n∑ i=1 (x̂i − xi)2 + λW + ρΘ (4)\nρ controls sparsity of representation in hidden layer. Note that directly applying sparse autoencoder to our problem does not work well. For example, we can train an autoencoder purely by placing synthetic data in input layer and real data in output layer denoted as 〈i:Xs, t:Xr〉 which however can not bridge the synthetic gap in our problem. Such way of reconstruction is only\n4 to complement the missing information in synthetic data from real data but not vice versa1.\nA better representation should be reconstructed by using the information from both real and synthetic data simultaneously. Specifically, we aim at two tasks: one is 〈i:Xs, t:Xr〉L which reconstructs synthetic data towards real data, and the other one is 〈i:Xr, t:Xr〉R which uses identical real data for input and reconstruction target, where 〈·〉L and 〈·〉R indicate the left and right channel of MCAE."

      "text" : "We propose a multichannel autoencoder that uses a balance regularization to leverage the learning between two tasks, i.e. 〈i:Xs, t:Xr〉L and 〈i:Xr, t:Xr〉R. The structure of this new autoencoder is shown in Fig. 3. In this new structure, tasks of two channels will share the same parameters θe in encoding process which will enforce autoencoder to reconstruct common structure in both tasks. However, in decoding process, we divide autoencoder to two separate channels that two tasks will have their own parameters θLd and θ R d . Dividing autoencoder to two channels at decoding layer enable a more flexible control between the two tasks. Thus autoencoder better leverage the common knowledge from the two tasks.\nWith two channels in the MCAE, we target to minimize the reconstruction error of two tasks together while taking into account the balance between two channels. The new objective function of the MCAE is given in the following:\nE = JL(θe, θ L d ) + J R(θe, θ R d ) + γΨ (5)\nwhere\nΨ = 1\n2 (JL(θe, θ L d )− JR(θe, θRd ))2 (6)\nis a regularization added to balance the learning rate between two channels. This regularization will have two effects on the MCAE. First, Ψ accelerates the speed of optimizing Eq. 9, since minimizing Ψ requires both JL(θe, θ L d ) and J R(θe, θ R d ) are small which in turn cause E decreases faster. Second, Ψ penalizes a situation more when difference of learning error between two channels are large, so as to avoid imbalanced learning between two channels.\nThe minimization of Eq. 9 is achieved by back propagation and stochastic gradient descent using QuasiNewton method. Since the regularization term is added to leverage the balance of different tasks, we have to compute the gradient of parameters θe and θLd , θ R d in MCAE.

      "text" : "Our MCAE enforces autoencoder to learn useful class patterns from the two tasks simultaneously. Thus it helps with capturing a common structure of synthetic and real images. Another alternative way is to concatenate the input and target of the two tasks 〈i:XsXr, t:XrXr〉 for autoencoder. We annotate the usage of this autoencoder as Concatenate-Input Autoencoder (CIAE), since this autoencoder learns concatenated tasks at the same time. Such configurations however may result in an unbalanced optimization for these two tasks: the optimization process of one task will take over the process of the other one. It results in a biased reconstructed hidden layer of the autoencoder and thus a limited classification performance. Our experiments also validate this point in Sec. 5."

      "text" : "It is an important and yet less studied topic of how to generate synthetic data. This section discusses the methodology of generating synthetic data used in our experiments. Such synthetic data have some similarities and differences with the augmented data used in deep learning e.g. [21]. Both of synthetic data and augmented data aim at improving the generalisation capacity of classifiers. Nevertheless, the methodology of generating synthetic data brings more deformed patterns than the simply label-preserving transformations used in data augmentation.\nSynthetic data are created to highlight the potential useful pattern existed in real images. We have two stages of generating synthetic data. In the first stage, for each real data used to train MCAE, a synthetic version that best matching appearance of the real data is generated; thus pairs of corresponding real and synthetic data can be used to train the MCAE. In the second stage, more synthetic data could be derived using synthetic data generated in the first stage by both interpolation and extrapolation. To distinguish the set of synthetic data used in these two stages, we use abbreviation Syn I and Syn II to represent them respectively.\nIn the proposed approach, the synthetic data are represented as a parametric model of a set of control points and edges associated to these points in the images. From the control points, the synthetic images could be generated to simulate the real images in terms of having the same structure or a similar appearance. Initially, the control points are selected from a synthetic prototype that generalize all images in the same class. Then the locations of the control points are iteratively optimized until convergence in order to minimize the distance between synthetic images generated by control points and the real image. We annotate the control points and edges associated to them as S = {P,E}, where P = {pi}ni=1 is the set of the control points, and E = {(pi, pj)}, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n is the set of edges connecting control points.\n5 A generalized algorithm of getting the best matching synthetic image is provided in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Get Matching Synthetic Image.

In their work, given enough pre-knowledge about the 3D objects, a synthetic prototype of 3D objects is explicitly designed and built. By adjusting the control points of the prototype, various kinds of 3D objects are generated. In this work, essentially, our data is very similar to theirs in a sense that roof images share a lot of characteristics such as ridge lines, valley lines and intersections between these lines, which make it possible to manually design the synthetic prototypes that characterize these patterns. Based on this observation, a synthetic roof prototype could be generated by setting the control points at the intersections of the ridge or valley lines and drawing segments connecting these control points. 2.\nIn this scenario, the OptimizeControlPoints(U, V,S) function of Alg. 1 turns out to be a process that searches for optimal control point locations which results in a synthetic image minimizing the discrepancy between the real image and the synthetic image.

To generate the intermediate images, we binarize all the images and the distance transformed images[7] of the synthetic prototype and the real image are generated. Given the number of steps, an intermediate image then is generated as a binarized image of linear interpolation between two distance transformed images.

This regularization will have two effects on the YMAE. First, Ψ accelerates the speed of optimizing Eq. 9, since minimizing Ψ requires both JL(θe, θ L d ) and J R(θe, θ R d ) are small which in turn cause E decrease faster. Second, Ψ penalize a situation more when difference of learning error between two branches are large, so as to avoid imbalanced learning between two branches.\nThe minimization of Eq. 9 is achieved by back propagation and stochastic gradient descent using QuasiNewton method. In the MCAE, with balance regularization added to the objective, the only difference as opposed to sparse autoencoder is the gradient computation of unknown parameters θe and θLd , θ R d . We clarify these differences in the following equations:\n∇WeE = ∂JL ∂We + ∂JR ∂We + γ(JL − JR)( ∂J L ∂We − ∂J R ∂We )\n∇beE = ∂JL ∂be + ∂JR ∂be + γ(JL − JR)(∂J L ∂be − ∂J R ∂be )\n(11)\nand\n∇WLd E = ∂JL ∂WLd + γ(JL − JR) ∂J L ∂WLd ∇bLdE = ∂JL\n∂bLd + γ(JL − JR)∂J\nL\n∂bLd\n∇WRd E = ∂JR ∂WRd + γ(JL − JR)(− ∂J R ∂WRd ) ∇bRd E = ∂JR\n∂bRd + γ(JL − JR)(−∂J\nR\n∂bRd )\n(12)\nThe exact form of gradients of θe and θLd , θ R d varies according to different sparsity regularization Θ used in the framework."

It could be observed that most of the control points are moved from the source image to corresponding locations on destination image. In this step, it is not necessary for all control points accurately move to exact corresponding location on the destination image. Our goal is just to use these migrated control points to generate synthetic data which will roughly mimic the real data. Our MCAE later will rectify the difference between synthetic data and real data."

For example, we can train an autoencoder purely by placing synthetic data in input layer and real data in output layer which however can not bridge the synthetic gap in our problem. Such way of reconstruction is only to complement the missing information in synthetic data from real data. On the contrary, reconstructed real data using such SAE will add unnecessary information and noisy patterns to reconstructed data.\nTo validate this point, we extend the experiments of two datasets and show that SAE can not bridge the gap of synthetic gap. The results are shown in Fig. 10. The reconstructed data of SAE have lower average divergence than the other methods. That means, SAE performances worse than MCAE in bridging the synthetic gap.\n11"

We show that by suing MCAE, it is possible to learn a better feature representation for classification. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on two types of datasets. Experimental results on two datasets validate the efficiency of our MCAE model and our methodology of generating synthetic data.",
