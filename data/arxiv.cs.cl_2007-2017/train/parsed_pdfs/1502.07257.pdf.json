      "text" : "Continuous-valued word representations are very useful in many natural language processing applications. They could serve as input features for higher-level algorithms in text processing pipeline and help to overcome the word sparseness of natural texts. Moreover, they can explain on their own many semantic properties and relationships between concepts represented by words.\nRecently, with the success of the deep learning, new meth-\nods for learning word representations inspired by various neural architectures were introduced. Among many others the two particular models Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram (SG) proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013a) were used to obtain high-dimensional distributed representations that capture many semantic relationships and linguistic regularities (Mikolov et al., 2013b;c). In addition to high quality of learned representations these models are computationally very efficient and allow to process text data in online streaming setting.\nHowever, word ambiguity (which may appear as polysemy, homonymy, etc) the important property of a natural language is usually ignored in representation learning methods. For example, word “apple” may refer to a fruit or to the Apple inc. depending on the context. Both CBOW and SG also fail to address this issue since they assume a unique representation for each word. As a consequence either the most frequent meaning of the word dominates the others or the meanings are mixed. Clearly both situations are not desirable for practical applications.\nWe address the problem of unsupervised learning of multiple representations that correspond to different meanings of a word, i.e. building multi-prototype word representations. This may be considered as specific case of word sense induction (WSI) problem which consists in automatic identification of the meanings of a word. In our case different meanings are distinguished by separate representations. We define meaning or sense as distinguishable interpretation of the spelled word which may be caused by any kind of ambiguity.\nWord-sense induction is closely related to the word-sense disambiguation (WSD) task where the goal is to choose\nwhich meaning of a word among provided in the sense inventory was used in the context. The sense inventory may be obtained by a WSI system or provided as external information.\nMany natural language processing (NLP) applications benefit from ability to deal with word ambiguity (Navigli & Crisafulli, 2010; Vickrey et al., 2005). Since word representations have been used as word features in dependency parsing (Chen & Manning, 2014), named-entity recognition (Turian et al., 2010) and sentiment analysis (Maas et al., 2011) among many other tasks, employing multi-prototype representations could increase the performance of such representation-based approaches.\nIn this paper we develop natural extension of the Skip-gram model which we call Adaptive Skip-gram (AdaGram). It retains all noticeable properties of SG such as fast online learning and high quality of representations while allowing to automatically learn the necessary number of prototypes per word at desired semantic resolution.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: we start with reviewing original Skip-gram model (section 2), then we describe our extension called Adaptive Skip-gram (section 3). Then, we compare our model to existing approaches in section 4. In section 5 we evaluate our model qualitatively by considering neighborhoods of selected words in the learned latent space and by quantitative comparison against concurrent approaches. Finally, we conclude in section 6."

      "text" : "The original Skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013b) is formulated as a set of grouped word prediction tasks. Each task consists of prediction of a word v given a word w using correspondingly their output and input representations\np(v|w, θ) = exp(in⊺woutv)∑V\nv′=1 exp(in ⊺ woutv′) , (1)\nwhere global parameter θ = {inv, outv}Vv=1 stands for both input and output representations for all words of the dictionary indexed with 1, . . . , V . Both input and output representations are real vectors of the dimensionality D.\nThese individual predictions are grouped in a way to simultaneously predict context words y of some input word x:\np(y|x, θ) = ∏\nj\np(yj |x, θ).\nInput text o consisting of N words o1, o2, . . . , oN is then interpreted as a sequence of input words X = {xi}Ni=1 and their contexts Y = {yi}Ni=1. Here i-th training object (xi, yi) consists of word xi = oi and its contextyi = {ot}t∈c(i)\nwhere c(i) is a set of indices such that |t − i| ≤ C/2 and t 6= i for all t ∈ c(i)1.\nFinally, Skip-gram objective function is the likelihood of contexts given the corresponding input words:\np(Y |X, θ) =\nN∏\ni=1\np(yi|xi, θ) =\nN∏\ni=1\nC∏\nj=1\np(yij |xi, θ). (2)\nNote that although contexts of adjacent words intersect, the model assumes the corresponding prediction problems independent.\nFor training the Skip-gram model it is common to ignore sentence and document boundaries and to interpret the input data as a stream of words. The objective (2) is then optimized in a stochastic fashion by sampling i-th word and its context, estimating gradients and updating parameters θ. After the model is trained, Mikolov et al. (2013a;b) treated the input representations of the trained model as word features and showed that they captured semantic similarity between concepts represented by the words. Further we refer to the input representations as prototypes following (Reisinger & Mooney, 2010b).\nBoth evaluation and differentiation of (1) has linear complexity (in the dictionary size V ) which is too expensive for practical applications. Because of that the soft-max prediction model (1) is substituted by the hierarchical soft-max (Mnih & Hinton, 2008):\np(v|w, θ) = ∏\nn∈path(v)\nσ(ch(n)in⊺woutn) (3)\nHere output representations are no longer associated with words, but rather with nodes in a binary tree where leaves are all possible words in the dictionary with unique paths from root to corresponding leaf. ch(n) assigns either 1 or −1 to each node in the path(v) depending on whether n is a left or right child of previous node in the path. Equation (3) is guaranteed to sum to 1 i.e. be a distribution w.r.t. v as σ(x) = 1/(1 + exp(−x)) = 1 − σ(−x). For computational efficiency Skip-gram uses Huffman tree to construct hierarchical soft-max."

      "text" : "The original Skip-gram model maintains only one prototype per word. It would be unrealistic to assume that single representation may capture the semantics of all possible word meanings. At the same time it is non-trivial to specify exactly the right number of prototypes required for handling meanings of a particular word. Hence, an adaptive\n1For notational simplicity we will further assume that size of the context is always equal to C which is true for all non-boundary words.\napproach for allocation of additional prototypes for ambiguous words is required. Further we describe our Adaptive Skip-gram (AdaGram) model which extends the original Skip-gram and may automatically learn the required number of prototypes for each word using Bayesian nonparametric approach.\nFirst, assume that each word has K meanings each associated with its own prototype. That means that we have to modify (3) to account for particular choice of the meaning. For this reason we introduce latent variable z that encodes the index of active meaning and extend (3) to\np(v|z = k, w, θ) = ∏\nn∈path(v)\nσ(ch(n)in⊺wkoutn) (4)\nNote that we bring even more asymmetry between input and output representations comparing to (3) since now only prototypes depend on the particular word meaning. While it is possible to make context words be also meaning-aware this would make the training process much more complicated. Our experiments show that this word prediction model is enough to capture word ambiguity. Equation (4) could be viewed as prediction of context words using meanings of the input words.\nHowever, setting the number of prototypes for all words equal is not a very realistic assumption. Moreover, it is desirable that the number of prototypes for a particular word would be determined by the training text corpus. We approach this problem by employing Bayesian nonparametrics into Skip-gram model, i.e. we use the constructive definition of Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1973) for automatic determination of the required number of prototypes. Dirichlet process (DP) has been successfully used for infinite mixture modeling and other problems where the number of structure components (e.g. clusters, latent factors, etc.) is not known a priori (Shahbaba & Neal, 2009; Rasmussen, 2000) which is exactly our case.\nWe use the constructive definition of DP via the stickbreaking representation (Sethuraman, 1994) to define a prior over meanings of a word. The meaning probabilities are computed by dividing total probability mass into infinite number of diminishing pieces summing to 1. So the prior probability of k-th meaning of the word w is\np(z = k|w,β) = βwk\nk−1∏\nr=1\n(1 − βwr),\np(βwk|α) = Beta(βwk|1, α), k = 1, . . .\nThis assumes that infinite number of prototypes for each word may exist. However, as long as we consider finite amount of text data, the number of prototypes (those with non-zero prior probabilities) for word w will not exceed the number of occurrences of w in the text which we denote as\nnw. The hyperparameter α controls the number of prototypes for a word allocated a priori. Asymptotically, the expected number of prototypes of word w is proportional to α log(nw). Thus, larger values of α produce more prototypes which lead to more granular and specific meanings captured by learned representations and the number of prototypes scales logarithmically with number of occurrences.\nAnother attractive property of DPs is their ability to increase the complexity of latent variables’ space with more data arriving. In our model this will result to more distinctive meanings of words discovered on larger text corpus.\nCombining all parts together we may write the AdaGram model as follows:\np(Y, Z,β|X,α, θ) =\nV∏\nw=1\n∞∏\nk=1\np(βwk|α)\nN∏\ni=1\n[ p(zi|xi,β)) C∏\nj=1\np(yij |zi, xi, θ) ] .\nwhere Z = {zi}Ni=1 is a set of senses for all the words.\nSimilarly to Mikolov et al. (2013a) we do not consider any regularization (and so the informative prior) for representations and seek for point estimate of θ."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.1. Learning representations",
      "text" : "One way to train the AdaGram is to maximize the marginal likelihood of the model\nlog p(Y |X, θ, α) = log\n∫ ∑\nZ\np(Y, Z,β|X,α, θ)dβ (5)\nwith respect to representations θ. One may see that the marginal likelihood is intractable because of the latent variables Z and β. Moreover, β and θ are infinite-dimensional parameters. Thus unlike the original Skip-gram and other methods for learning multiple word representations, our model could not be straightforwardly trained by stochastic gradient ascent w.r.t. θ.\nTo make this tractable we consider the variational lower bound on the marginal likelihood (5)\nL = Eq [log p(Y, Z,β|X,α, θ)− log q(Z,β)]\nwhere\nq(Z,β) = q(Z)q(β) =\nN∏\ni=1\nq(zi)\nV∏\nw=1\nT∏\nk=1\nq(βwk)\nis the fully factorized variational approximation to the posterior p(Z,β|X,Y, α, θ) with possible number of representations for each word truncated to T (Blei & Jordan, 2005). It may be shown that the maximization of the variational lower bound with respect to q(Z,β) is equivalent to\nthe minimization of Kullback-Leibler divergence between q(Z,β) and the true posterior (Jordan et al., 1999).\nWithin this approximation the variational lower bound L(q(Z), q(β), θ) takes the following form:\nL(q(Z),q(β),θ)=Eq\n[ V∑\nw=1\nT∑\nk=1\nlog p(βwk|α)−log q(βwk)+\nN∑\ni=1\n( log p(zi|xi,β)−log q(zi)+ C∑\nj=1\nlog p(yij |zi, xi, θ) ) ] .\nSetting derivatives of L(q(Z), q(β), θ) with respect to q(Z) and q(β) to zero yields standard update equations\nlog q(zi = k) = Eq(β) [log p(Y, Z,β|X,α, θ)] + const\n= Eq(β) [ log βxi,k + k−1∑\nr=1\nlog(1− βxi,r)\n]\n+\nC∑\nj=1\nlog p(yij |k, xi, θ) + const, (6)\nlog q(β) = Eq(Z) [log p(Y, Z,β|X,α, θ)] + const\n= V∑\nw=1\nT∑\nk=1\nlog Beta(βwk|awk, bwk), (7)\nwhere (natural) parameters awk and bwk deterministically depend on the expected number of assignments to particular sense nwk = ∑ i:xi=w\nq(zi = k) (Blei & Jordan, 2005):\nawk = 1 + nwk, bwk = α+\nT∑\nr=k+1\nnwr. (8)\nStochastic variational inference. Although variational updates given by (6) and (7)-(8) are tractable, they require the full pass over training data. In order to keep the efficiency of Skip-gram training procedure, we employ stochastic variational inference approach (Hoffman et al., 2013) and derive online optimization algorithm for the maximization of L.\nThere are two groups of parameters in our objective: {q(βvk)} and θ are global because they affect all the objects; {q(zi)} are local, i.e. affect only the corresponding object xi. After updating the local parameters according to (6) with the global parameters fixed and defining the obtained distribution as q∗(Z) we have a function of the global parameters\nL∗(q(β), θ) = L(q∗(Z), q(β), θ) ≥ L(q(Z), q(β), θ).\nAlgorithm 1 Training AdaGram model\nInput: training data {(xi,yi)}Ni=1, hyperparameter α Output: parameters θ, distributions q(β), q(z)\nInitialize parameters θ, distributions q(β), q(z) for i = 1 to N do\nSelect word w = xi and its context yi LOCAL STEP: for k = 1 to T do γik = Eq(βw)[log p(zi = k|β, xi)] for j = 1 to C do γik ← γik + log p(yij |xi, k, θ)\nend end γik ← exp(γik)/ ∑ ℓ exp(γiℓ) GLOBAL STEP: ρt ← 0.025(1− i/N), λt ← 0.025(1− i/N) for k = 1 to T do\nUpdate nwk ← (1− λt)nwk + λtnwγik end Update θ ← θ + ρt∇θ ∑ k ∑ j γik log p(yij |xi, k, θ)\nend\nThe new lower bound L∗ is no longer a function of local parameters which are always kept updated to their optimal values. Thus L∗ allows for employing stochastic optimization framework and was shown to converge faster than L when using gradient methods (Hensman et al., 2012).\nFollowing Hoffman et al. (2013) we iteratively optimizeL∗ with respect to the global parameters using stochastic gradient estimated at a single object. Stochastic gradient w.r.t θ computed on the i-th object is computed as follows:\n∇̂θL ∗ = N\nC∑\nj=1\nT∑\nk=1\nq∗(zi = k)∇θ log p(yij |k, xi, θ)\nNow we describe how to optimize L∗ w.r.t global posterior approximation q(β) = ∏D w=1 ∏T k=1 q(βwk). The stochastic gradient with respect to natural parameters awk and bwk according to (Hoffman et al., 2013) can be estimated by computing intermediate values of natural parameters (âwk, b̂wk) on the i-th data point as if we estimated q(z) for all occurrences of xi = w equal to q(zi):\nâwk = 1+nwq(zi = k), b̂wk = α+\nT∑\nr=k+1\nnwq(zi = r),\nwhere nw is the total number of occurrences of word w. The stochastic gradient estimate then can be expressed in the following simple form:\n∇̂awkL ∗ = âwk − awk, ∇̂bwkL ∗ = b̂wk − bwk.\nOne may see that making such gradient update is equivalent to updating counts nwk since they are sufficient statistics of q(βwk).\nWe use conservative initialization strategy for q(β) starting with only one allocated meaning for each word, i.e. nw1 = nw and nwk = 0, k > 1. Representations are initialized with random values drawn from Uniform(−0.5/D, 0.5/D). In our experiments we updated both learning rates ρ and λ using the same linear schedule from 0.025 to 0.\nThe resulting learning algorithm 1 may be also interpreted as an instance of stochastic variational EM algorithm. It has linear computational complexity in the length of text o similarly to Skip-gram learning procedure. The overhead of maintaining variational distributions is negligible comparing to dealing with representations and thus training of AdaGram is T times slower than Skip-gram."

      "text" : "Literature on learning continuous-space representations of embeddings for words is vast, therefore we concentrate on\nworks that are most relevant to our approach.\nHuang et al. (2012); Reisinger & Mooney (2010a;b) propose the neural network-based methods for learning multiprototype representations. Both methods include clustering contexts for all words as prepossessing or intermediate step. While this allows to learn multiple prototypes per word, clustering large number of contexts brings serious computational overhead and limit these approaches to offline setting.\nRecently various modifications of Skip-gram were proposed to learn multi-prototype representations. Qiu et al. (2014) developed Proximity-Ambiguity Sensitive Skipgram which maintains individual representations for different parts of speech (POS) of the same word. While this may handle word ambiguity to some extent, clearly there could be many meanings even for the same part of speech of some word remaining not discovered by this approach.\nWork of Tian et al. (2014) can be considered as a parametric form of our model with number of meanings for each word fixed. Their model also provides improvement over original Skip-gram, but it is not clear how to set the number of prototypes. Our approach not only allows to efficiently learn required number of prototypes for ambiguous words, but is able also to gradually increase the number of meanings when more data becomes available thus distinguishing between shades of same meaning.\nChen et al. (2014) incorporate external knowledge about word meanings into Skip-gram in the form of sense inventory. First, single-prototype representations are pre-trained with original Skip-gram. Afterwards, meanings provided by WordNet lexical database are used learn multi-prototype representations for ambiguous words. The dependency on the external high-quality linguistic resources such as WordNet makes this approach inapplicable to languages lacking such databases. In contrast, our model does not consider any form of supervision and learns the sense inventory automatically from the raw text.\nRecent work of Neelakantan et al. (2014) proposing Multisense Skip-gram (MSSG) and its nonparameteric (not in the sense of Bayesian nonparametrics) version (NP MSSG) is the closest to AdaGram prior art. While MSSG defines the number of prototypes apriori similarly to (Tian et al., 2014), NP MSSG features automatic discovery of multiple meanings for each word. In contrast to our approach, learning for NP MSSG is defined rather as ad-hoc greedy procedure that allocates new representation for a word if existing ones explain its context below some threshold. AdaGram instead follows more principled nonparametric Bayesian approach. Thus in our model the number of prototypes may not only increase during the training, but also decrease if this leads to a better model in terms of varia-\ntional lower bound. In our experimental evaluation we use models of Neelakantan et al. (2014) as baselines."

Finally, we evaluate our approach on the word sense induction task (WSI).\nIn order to evaluate our method we trained several models with different values of α on April 2010 snapshot of English Wikipedia (Shaoul & Westbury, 2010). It contains nearly 2 million articles and 990 million tokens. We did not consider words which have less than 20 occurrences.

      "text" : "As mentioned in section 3 hyperparameter α of the AdaGram model indirectly controls the number of induced word meanings. Figure 1 shows the distribution of number of induced word meanings under different values of α. One may see that while for most words relatively small number of meanings is learned, larger values of α lead to more meanings in general. This effect may be explained by the property of Dirichlet process to allocate number of prototypes that logarithmically depends on number of word occurrences. Since word occurrences are known to be distributed by Zipf’s law, the majority of words is rather infrequent and thus our model discovers few meanings for them. Figure 2 quantitatively demonstrates this phenomenon.\nIn the table 2 we demonstrate how larger values of α lead to more meanings on the example of the word “light”. The original Skip-gram discovered only the meaning related to a physical phenomenon, AdaGram with α = 0.075 found\nthe second, military meaning, with further increase of α value those meanings start splitting to submeanings, e.g. light tanks and light troops. In table 3 we demonstrate analogical result on the example of the word “core”. The Skip-gram model discovered only one meaning which corresponds to microprocessor core, AdaGram with α = 0.05 also found the meaning related to nuclear reactors, and several other meanings were obtained with the increase of α.\nFor most of the words α = 0.1 results in most interpretable model. It seems that for values less than 0.1 for most words only one prototype is learned and for values greater than 0.1 the model becomes less interpretable as learned meanings are too specific sometimes duplicating."

At the same time, FS is biased towards clusterings consisting of small number of clusters e.g. assigning each instance to the same single cluster. Thus we consider another metric - adjusted Rand index (Hubert & Arabie, 1985) (ARI) which does not suffer from such drawbacks.

AdaGram uses different prototypes to represent a word depending on the context and thus may handle various forms of word ambiguity. Our experiments suggest that representations learned by our model correspond to different word meanings. Using resolution parameter α we may control how many prototypes are extracted from the same text corpus. Too large values of α lead to different prototypes that correspond to the same meaning which decreases model performance. The values α = 0.1 − 0.2 are generally good for practical purposes. For those values the truncation level T = 30 is enough and does not affect the number of discovered prototypes. AdaGram also features online variational learning algorithm which is very scalable and makes it possible to train our model just several times slower than extremely efficient Skip-gram model. Since the problem of learning multi-prototype word representation is closely related to word-sense induction, we evaluated AdaGram on several WSI datasets and contributed a new large one obtained automatically from Wikipedia disambiguation pages. The source code of our implementation, WWSI dataset and all trained models are available at http://bayesgroup.ru/adagram/."

      "text" : "Similarly to (Navigli & Vannella, 2013) we considered Wikipedia’s disambiguation pages as a list of ambiguous words. From that list we have selected target single-term words which had occurred in the text at least 5000 times to ensure there is enough training contexts in Wikipedia to capture different meanings of a word (note, however, that all models were trained on earlier snapshot of Wikipedia). We also did not consider pages belonging to some categories such as “Letternumber_combination_disambiguation_pages” as they did not contain meaningful words. Then we prepared the sense inventory for each word in the list using Wikipedia pages with names matching to the pattern “WORD_(*)” which is used as convenient naming of specific word meanings. Again, we applied some automatic filtering to remove names of people and geographical places in order to obtain more coarse-grained meanings. Finally for each page selected on the previous step we find all occurrences of the target word on it and use its 5-word neighbourhood (5 words on the left and 5 words on the right) as a context. Such size of the context was chosen to minimize the intersection between adjacent contexts but still provide enough words for disambiguation. 10-word context results into average intersection of 1.115 words.\nThe list of the categories pages belonging to which were excluded during target word selection is following:\n• Place_name_disambiguation_pages\n• Disambiguation_pages_with_surname-holder_lists\n• Human_name_disambiguation_pages\n• Lists_of_ambiguous_numbers\n• Disambiguation_pages_with_given-nameholder_lists\n• Letter-number_combination_disambiguation_pages\n• Two-letter_disambiguation_pages\n• Transport_route_disambiguation_pages\n• Temple_name_disambiguation_pages\n• and also those from the categories which name contains one of the substrings: “cleanup”, “people”, “surnames”\nDuring the sense inventory collection we do not consider pages which name contains one of the following substrings: “tv_”, “series”, “movie”, “film”, “song”, “album”, “band”, “singer”, “musical\", “comics\"; and also those from the\ncategories with names containing geography terms “countries”, “people”, “province”, “provinces”.\nIn table 8 we compare our WWSI dataset with SemEval2007 and SemEval-2010 datasets. Namely, we provide the total number of words and contexts as well as average number of contexts and senses per word. Our dataset has the largest number of words and contexts, however it consists of the words with less number of senses."

However, Skip-gram as well as most prior work on learning word representations does not take into account word ambiguity and maintain only single representation per word. Although a number of Skip-gram modifications were proposed to overcome this limitation and learn multi-prototype word representations, they either require a known number of word meanings or learn them using greedy heuristic approaches. In this paper we propose the Adaptive Skip-gram model which is a nonparametric Bayesian extension of Skip-gram capable to automatically learn the required number of representations for all words at desired semantic resolution. We derive efficient online variational learning algorithm for the model and empirically demonstrate its efficiency on wordsense induction task.",
