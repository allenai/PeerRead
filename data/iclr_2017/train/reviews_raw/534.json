{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning in Implicit Generative Models", "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an algorithmic framework for constructing generative models with several appealing properties: they do not require a likelihood function to be specified, only a generating procedure; they provide samples that are sharp and compelling; and they allow us to harness our knowledge of building highly accurate neural network classifiers. Here, we develop  our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning---to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models---models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data---and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density ratio estimation. There are four approaches for density ratio estimation, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence minimisation and moment matching have also been explored in the GAN literature, and we synthesise these views to form an understanding  in terms of the relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for future exploration and cross-pollination.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "Thank you for an interesting read.\n\nGiven the huge interest in generative modelling nowadays, this paper is very timely and does provide very clear connections between methods that don't use maximum likelihood for training.

(16), but this procedure is in fact known as least-squares importance estimation.\n* in turn, Eqn. (14) is actually more akin to KLIEP, the main difference being the use of the unnormalised form of the KL-divergence. So I think you meant to put the KLIEP reference here.\n\nFurther comment on making Eqn. (14) practical:\nIf you read the KLIEP paper, they formulate the procedure as a constrained optimisation problem:\nmaximise\n$$\nE_{p^*} log r_\\phi(x)\n$$\nsubject to the constraint that\n$$\nE_{q_\\theta} r_\\phi(x) = 1\n$$\n\nCompare this constrained optimisation to your solution, it is easy to make the connection: if you introduce a Lagrange multiplier to handle the constraint, one obtains the following unconstrained optimisation problem:\n\nseek stationary points of\n\n$$\n\\ell(\\phi, \\lambda) = E_{p^*} log r_\\phi(x) - \\lambda E_{q_\\theta} (r_\\phi(x) - 1)\n$$\n\nI do think that solving this unconstrained optimisation problem is actually possible, you can do that via stochastic gradient descent, and it does not include your nasty cross-entropy term.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nThanks,\n\nRev1", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "21 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 pcs", "comments": "This paper provides a unifying review of various forms of generative model.

We address the common concerns here and address other questions individually.\n\nThe aim of our paper is to review different approaches for learning in implicit generative models; GANs are a special case of implicit generative models and our work helps understand connections between GAN variants as well as understand how GANs are related to the wider statistical literature. We are not aware of any other work in the GAN literature which discusses the connections to approximate Bayesian computation, moment-matching and two sample-testing, unsupervised-as-supervised learning, optimal transport, likelihood free inference, or non-maximum likelihood estimation, even though these methods are clearly related. We believe these connections would be interesting to ICLR community for at least two reasons: (1) we can borrow tools from the related literature to improve optimisation and analyse convergence and (2) we can use GAN-like techniques to train differentiable simulators in other application domains (e.g high energy physics, economics, ecology), thereby opening up exciting research directions. AnonReviewer4 writes \u201cI believe this work is significant - it provides a bridge for language and methods used in multiple parts of statistics and machine learning. This has the potential to accelerate progress.\u201d And AnonReviewer1 writes \u201cIt is well written and a good read, and one I would recommend to people who would like to get involved in GANs.\u201d This was our aim, and why this paper is of relevance to ICLR.\n\nNovelty: The view of hypothesis testing gives an insight about the learning principle used in likelihood free / implicit models. This view also helps understand connections between variants of GANs; for instance, methods that use the density ratio (e.g. the original GAN paper, f-GAN and b-GAN) or the density difference (e.g. generative moment matching networks). To the best of our knowledge, this unifying view through hypothesis testing is novel (see also the concurrent submissions by Lopez-paz and Oquab (2016) and Uehara et al. (2016)). To quote AnonReviewer4, \u201cthe individual pieces are not novel, and yet the exposition of all of them in the same space with clear outline of the connections between them is novel.\u201d \nThe unifying view opens up lots of interesting research directions, e.g., since our initial arxiv submission, Kareletsos (2016) has published \u201cAdversarial Message Passing For Graphical Models\u201d ", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "13 Jan 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "I just noticed I submitted my review as a pre-review question - sorry about this. Here it is again, with a few more thoughts added...\n\nThe authors present a great and - as far as I can tell - accurate and honest overview of the emerging theory about GANs from a likelihood ratio estimation/divergence minimisation perspective. It is well written and a good read, and one I would recommend to people who would like to get involved in GANs.\n\nMy main problem with this submission is that it is hard as a reviewer to pin down what precisely the novelty is - beyond perhaps articulating these views better than other papers have done in the past. A sentence from the paper \"But it has left us unsatisfied since we have not gained the insight needed to choose between them.\u201d summarises my feeling about this paper: this is a nice 'unifying review\u2019 type paper that - for me - lacks a novel insight.\n\nIn summary, my assessment is mixed: I think this is a great paper, I enjoyed reading it. I was left a bit disappointed by the lack of novel insight, or a singular key new idea which you often expect in conference presentations, and this is why I\u2019m not highly confident about this as a conference submission (and hence my low score) I am open to be convinced either way.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\nI think the authors should probably discuss the connection of Eq. (13) to KLIEP: Kullback-Leibler Importance Estimation by Shugiyama and colleagues.\n\nI don\u2019t quite see how the part with equation (13) and (14) fit into the flow of the paper. By this point the authors have established the view that GANs are about estimating likelihood ratios - and then using these likelihood ratios to improve the generator. These paragraphs read like: we also tried to derive another particular formulation for doing this but we failed to do it in a practical way.\n\nThere is a typo in spelling Csiszar divergence\n\nEquation (15) is known (to me) as Least Squares Importance Estimation by Kanamori et al (2009). A variant of least-squares likelihood estimation uses the kernel trick, and finds a function from an RKHS that best represents the likelihood ratio between the two distributions in a least squares sense. I think it would be interesting to think about how this function is related to the witness function commonly used in MMD and what the properties of this function are compared to the witness function - perhaps showing the two things for simple distributions.\n\nI have stumbled upon the work of Sugiyama and collaborators on direct density ratio estimation before, and I found that work very insightful. Generally, while some of this work is cited in this paper, I felt that the authors could do more to highlight the great work of this group, who have made highly significant contributions to density ratio estimation, albeit with a different goal in mind.\n\nOn likelihood ratio estimation: some methods approximate the likelihood ratio directly (such as least-squares importance estimation), some can be thought of more as approximating the log of this quantity (logistic regression, denoising autoencoders). An unbiased estimate of the ratio will provide a biased estimate of the logarithm and vice versa. To me it feels like estimating the log of the ratio directly is more useful, and in more generality estimating the convex function of the ratio which is used to define the f-divergence seems like a good approach. Could the authors comment on this?\n\nI think the hypothesis testing angle is oversold in the paper.  I\u2019m not sure what additional insight is gained by mixing in some hypothesis testing terminology. Other than using quantities that appear in hypothesis testing as tests statistics, his work does not really talk about hypothesis testing, nor does it use any tools from the hypothesis testing literature. In this sense, this paper is in contrast with Sutherland et al (in review for ICLR) who do borrow concepts from two-sample testing to optimise hyperparameters of the divergence used.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "21 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer4", "TITLE": "An important paper", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper provides an exposition of multiple ways of learning in implicit generative models, of which generative adversarial networks are an example.
