We assume that we have access to some initial word representations (e.g., unsupervised embeddings), and that the supervised learning procedure updates them to task-specific representations for words contained in the training data. But what about words not contained in the supervised training data? When such unseen words are encountered at test time, they are typically represented by either their initial vectors or a single unknown vector, which often leads to errors. In this paper, we address this issue by learning to map from initial representations to task-specific ones. We present a general technique that uses a neural network mapper with a weighted multiple-loss criterion. This allows us to use the same learned model parameters at test time but now with appropriate task-specific representations for unseen words. We consider the task of dependency parsing and report improvements in performance (and reductions in out-of-vocabulary rates) across multiple domains such as news, Web, and speech. We also achieve downstream improvements on the task of parsingbased sentiment analysis."

      "text" : "In many NLP tasks, state-of-the-art systems achieve very good performance, but only when restricted to standard and heavily edited datasets (Petrov et al., 2010). For example, while\nstate-of-the-art accuracies exceed 97% for part-ofspeech tagging and 90% for dependency parsing, performance on non-standard, real-world datasets is substantially worse, dropping by nearly 10% absolute (Petrov and McDonald, 2012). A major cause of this drop is words that do not appear in the annotated training data but appear in unseen test data, whether in the same domain or in a new domain. We refer to such out-of-training-vocabulary (OOTV) words as unseen words. Supervised NLP systems often make errors on unseen words and, in structured tasks like dependency parsing, this can lead to other cascading errors in the same sentence, producing nonsensical output structures.\nRecently, continuous vector word representations, or embeddings, have shown promise in a variety of NLP tasks (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011; Anderson et al., 2013; Bansal et al., 2014). The typical assumption of word embedding learning is that words with similar statistical properties in a large dataset are similar in meaning. Using embeddings as features in NLP systems can help counter the effects of data sparsity (Necsulescu et al., 2015). However, the quality of such embeddings has been found to be heavily task-dependent (Bansal et al., 2014).\nThere is a great deal of work on updating embeddings during supervised training to make them more task-specific, whether through back-propagation or other techniques (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Qu et al., 2015; Chen and Manning, 2014). These task-trained embeddings have shown encouraging results but raise some concerns, especially: (1) for infrequent words, the updated representations\nmay be prone to overfitting, and (2) many words in the test data are not contained in the training data at all. In the latter case, at test time, most trained systems either fall back to some generic, single representation for all unknown words or use the initial representation (typically derived from unlabeled data) (Søgaard and Johannsen, 2012; Collobert et al., 2011). Neither of these choices is satisfactory: A single unknown word vector may lump too many words together, while the initial representations may be in a space which is not comparable to the trained embedding space.\nIn this paper, we focus on resolving unseen words by mapping from the initial embedding space to the task-trained embedding space. We train a neural network-based mapping function that takes initial word embeddings (learned using unsupervised techniques over a large unannotated dataset) and maps them to task-specific embeddings that are trained for the given task, via a multi-loss objective function. Moreover, due to the efficiency of training our mapper, we can tune its hyperparameters to optimize performance on each domain of interest, thereby achieving some of the benefits of domain adaptation.\nWe show the effectiveness of our mapping approach on the task of dependency parsing on a large set of diverse domains, e.g., news, Web, and speech. We also show the downstream effects of our mapper on the task of sentiment classification, using the recently proposed dependency parse-based tree long short-term memory (LSTM) network of Tai et al. (2015). In all domains and tasks, our method significantly reduces the number of unseen words (i.e., words without task-trained embeddings) and achieves significant performance improvements over the unmapped baselines."

The initial embeddings are typically learned in an unsupervised way, but for our purposes they can be any initial embeddings. Let T ⊆ V be the subset of words that appear in the annotated training data for some supervised task-specific training. We define unseen words as those in the set V \\ T . While our approach is general, for concreteness, we consider the task of dependency parsing, so the annotated data consists of sentences paired with dependency trees. We assume a dependency parser that learns task-specific word embeddings eti for word wi ∈ T , starting from the original embedding eoi . In this work, we use the Stanford neural dependency parser (Chen and Manning, 2014).\nThe goal of the mapper is as follows. We are given a training set of N pairs of initial and task-trained embeddings D = {(\neo 1 , et 1\n) , . . . , ( eoN , e t N )}\n, and we want to learn a function G that maps each initial embedding eoi to be as close as possible to its corresponding output embedding eti. We denote the mapped embedding emi , i.e., e m i = G (e o i ).\nFigure 1a describes the training procedure of the mapper. We use a supervised parser which is trained on an annotated dataset and initialized with pre-trained word embeddings eoi . The parser uses back-propagation to update these embeddings during training, producing task-trained embeddings eti for all wi ∈ T . After we train the parser, the mapping function G is trained to map an initial word embedding eoi to its parser-trained embedding e t i. At test (or development) time, we use the trained mapper G to transform the original embeddings of unseen test words to the parser-trained space (see Figure 1b). When parsing held-out data, we use the same parser model parameters (W ) as shown in Figure 1b. The only difference is that now some of the word embeddings (i.e., for unseen words) have changed to mapped ones."

This multiloss approach seeks to make both the conditional mean of the predicted representation close to the task-trained representation (via the squared loss) and the conditional median of the predicted representation close to the task-trained one (via the mean absolute loss). A weighted multi-criterion objective allows us to avoid making strong assumptions about the optimal transformation to be learned. We tune the hyperparameter α on domain-specific held-out data.\nFor optimization, we use batch limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) (Liu and Nocedal, 1989). In preliminary experiments comparing with stochastic optimization, we found L-BFGS to be more stable to train and easier to check for convergence (as has recently been found in other settings as well (Ngiam et al., 2011))."

We tune the hyperparameters of the regularizer and the loss function separately for each task, using a task-specific development set. This gives us additional flexibility to map the embeddings for the domain of interest, especially when the parser training data comes from a particular domain (e.g., newswire) and we want to use the parser on a new domain (e.g., email). We also tried dropout-based regularization (Srivastava et al., 2014) for the non-linear layer but did not see any significant improvement."

      "heading" : "2.5 Mapper-Parser Thresholds",
      "text" : "Certain words in the parser training data T are very infrequent, which may lead to inferior task-specific embeddings eti learned by the parser. We want our mapper function to be learned on high-quality tasktrained embeddings. After learning a strong mapping function, we can use it to remap the inferior task-trained embeddings.\nWe thus consider several frequency thresholds that control which word embeddings to use to train the mapper and which to map at test time. Below are the specific thresholds that we consider:\nMapper-training Threshold (τt) The mapper is trained only on embedding pairs for words seen at least τt times in the training data T .\nMapping Threshold (τm) For test-time inference, the mapper will map any word whose count in T is less than τm. That is, we discard parser-trained embeddings eti of these infrequent words and use our mapper to map the initial embeddings eoi instead.\nParser Threshold (τp) While training the parser, for words that appear fewer than τp times in T , the\nparser replaces them with the ‘unknown’ embedding. Thus, no parser-trained embeddings will be learned for these words.\nIn our experiments, we explore a small set of values from this large space of possible threshold combinations (detailed below). We consider only relatively small values for the mapper-training (τt) and parser thresholds (τp) because as we increase them, the number of training examples for the mapper decreases, making it harder to learn an accurate mapping function."

      "text" : "The most common approach to resolving unseen words is to replace them with a special unknown word token (Søgaard and Johannsen, 2012; Chen and Manning, 2014; Collobert et al., 2011). The representation for the unknown token is either learned specifically or computed from a selection of rare words, for example by averaging their embedding vectors. This approach could be problematic since all unseen words are mapped to the same vector, irrespective of their syntactic or semantic categories.\nThere are several threads of prior work using character-level information for unseen word forms. Some combine unsupervised morphological analysis with compositional neural network architectures (Luong et al., 2013; Botha and Blunsom, 2014). Ling et al. (2015) and Ballesteros et al. (2015) use long short-term memory recurrent neural networks to embed character sequences. Others use convolutional neural networks on character streams (Labeau et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015; Zhang and LeCun, 2015). Huang and Harper (2009; 2011) use a heuristic based on emission probabilities of individual characters in unknown words.\nThere is also a great deal of work using morphological information for rare or unseen words (Candito and Crabbé, 2009; Habash, 2009; Marton et al., 2010; Seddah et al., 2010; Attia et al., 2010). Other work has focused on using contextual information, such as using n-gram based sequence models or web data (Bansal and Klein, 2011). Keller and Lapata (2003) use the web to obtain\nfrequency information for unseen words. Dyer et al. (2015) represent each word using an embedding learned during parser training concatenated with a fixed embedding from a neural language model, which provides a larger vocabulary. While they still use an unknown word token for singletons, the pretrained embeddings from the neural language model provide additional information about the unknown word. Other work has also found improvements by combining pretrained, fixed embeddings with task-trained embeddings (Kim, 2014; Paulus et al., 2014). Also relevant are approaches developed specifically to handle large target vocabularies (including many rare words) in neural machine translation systems (Jean et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Chitnis and DeNero, 2015).\nClosely related to our approach is that of Tafforeau et al. (2015), which also tries to map an initial, unsupervised word embedding space to the word embedding space learned during supervised training. Their method generates updated embeddings for unseen words by combining the embeddings of their k nearest neighbors. In Section 5, we show that our approach outperforms this kNN approach. Another related technique proposed by Kiros et al. (2015) learns a linear mapping from an initial embedding space to their encoder’s vocabulary space by solving an unregularized linear regression problem. Our approach differs in that it can learn a non-linear mapping, and we also learn separate mappings for each domain of interest, tuning the mapper for each domain. We also empirically evaluate the effect of performing this mapping, showing statistically significant improvements. To our knowledge, these are the only approaches that handle unseen words by explicitly mapping initial representations to a task-trained space.\nOur work is also somewhat related to domain adaptation for dependency parsing, which has been extensively studied in recent years (McDonald and Nivre, 2007; Nilsson et al., 2007). The goal of this task is to adapt an existing parser to a target domain with little or no annotated data. Previous work has used co-training (Cohen et al., 2012), word distribution features (Koo et al., 2008; Bansal et al., 2014; Weiss et al., 2015), and selftraining (McClosky et al., 2006).\nOur simple approach learns to directly map initial word-level embeddings to the task-trained embedding space. No character-level compositional model or morphological information is needed. Since the initial embeddings are obtained from a large corpus in an unsupervised manner, data sparseness issues can be mitigated by enlarging this corpus. Tuning the hyperparameters of our mapper on small domain-specific development sets helps us to adapt the transformation to the target domain."

      "text" : "We consider a number of datasets with varying rates of OOTV words. We define the OOTV rate (or, equivalently, the unseen rate) of a dataset as the percentage of the vocabulary (types) of words occurring in the set that were not seen in training.\nWall Street Journal (WSJ) and OntoNotesWSJ We conduct experiments on the Wall Street Journal portion of the English Penn Treebank dataset (Marcus et al., 1993). We follow the standard splits: sections 2-21 for training, section 22 for validation, and section 23 for testing. We convert the original phrase structure trees into dependency trees using Stanford Basic Dependencies (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008) in the Stanford Dependency Parser. The POS tags are obtained using the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) in a 10-fold jackknifing setup on the training data (achieving an accuracy of 96.96%). The OOTV rate in the development and test sets is approximately 2-3%.\nWe also conduct experiments on the OntoNotes 4.0 dataset (which we denote OntoNotes-WSJ). This dataset contains the same sentences as the WSJ corpus (and we use the same data splits), but has significantly different annotations. The OntoNotes-WSJ training data is used for the Web Treebank test experiments. We perform the same pre-processing steps as for the WSJ dataset.\nWeb Treebank We expect our mapper to be most effective when parsing held-out data with many unseen words. This often happens when the held-out data is drawn from a different distribution than the training data. For example, when training a parser on newswire and testing on web data, many errors occur due to differing patterns of syntactic usage and unseen words (Foster et al., 2011; Petrov and McDonald, 2012; Kong et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014).\nWe explore this setting by training our parser on OntoNotes-WSJ and testing on the Web Treebank (Petrov and McDonald, 2012), which includes five domains: answers, email, newsgroups, reviews, and weblogs. Each domain contains approximately 2000-4000 manually annotated syntactic parse trees in the OntoNotes 4.0 style. As before, we convert\nthe phrase structure trees to dependency trees using Stanford Basic Dependencies. The parser and the mapper hyperparameters were tuned separately on the development set for each domain. The test and development sets for each domain contain approximately 1000-2500 sentences. We use our mapper to map unseen words in the development and test sets in each domain. The unseen rate is typically 6- 10% in the domains of the Web Treebank. We train a separate mapper for each domain, tuning mapper hyperparameters separately for each domain using the development sets. In this way, we obtain some of the benefits of domain adaptation for each target domain.\nSwitchboard Speech Corpus The NXT Switchboard speech corpus (Calhoun et al., 2010) contains annotated parses of spoken telephone conversations. We obtain ground truth dependencies from phrase structure trees using the Stanford converter as above, as also done by Honnibal and Johnson (2014). We perform their other preprocessing steps of lowercasing the text, removing punctuation, and removing partial utterances and one-token sentences. Since the current version of the Stanford parser cannot perform non-monotonic parsing,2 we also remove disfluent utterances in such a way that we get a purely non-disfluent speech dataset. We use the standard train/development/test splits of Charniak and Johnson (2001).\nDownstream Task: Sentiment Analysis with Dependency Tree LSTMs We also perform experiments to analyze the effects of embedding mapping on a downstream task, in this case sentiment analysis using the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (Socher et al., 2013). We use the dependency tree long short-term memory network (Tree-LSTM) proposed by Tai et al. (2015), simply replacing their default dependency parser with our version that maps unseen words. The dependency parser is trained on the WSJ corpus and mapped using the WSJ development set. We use the same mapper that was optimized for the WSJ development set, with-\n2The arc-standard algorithm, in the Stanford parser, is a monotonic parsing algorithm where once an action has been performed, subsequent actions must be consistent with it (Honnibal and Johnson, 2014).

We include four unseen words (shown in caps): ‘horrible’, ‘poor’, ‘marvelous’, and ‘magnificent’. In Figure 3a and Figure 3b, the embeddings for the unseen words are identical (even though t-SNE places them in different places when producing its projection). In Figure 3c, we observe that the mapper has placed the unseen words within appropriate areas of the space with respect to similarity with the seen words. We contrast this with Figure 3b, in which the unseen words appear to be within a different region of the space from all seen words."

We demonstrated significant improvements in dependency parsing accuracy across several domains, as well as improvements on a downstream task. Our approach is simple, effective, and applicable to many other settings, both inside and outside NLP."

We assume that we have access to some initial word representations (e.g., unsupervised embeddings), and that the supervised learning procedure updates them to task-specific representations for words contained in the training data. But what about words not contained in the supervised training data? When such unseen words are encountered at test time, they are typically represented by either their initial vectors or a single unknown vector, which often leads to errors. In this paper, we address this issue by learning to map from initial representations to task-specific ones. We present a general technique that uses a neural network mapper with a weighted multiple-loss criterion. This allows us to use the same learned model parameters at test time but now with appropriate task-specific representations for unseen words. We consider the task of dependency parsing and report improvements in performance (and reductions in out-of-vocabulary rates) across multiple domains such as news, Web, and speech. We also achieve downstream improvements on the task of parsingbased sentiment analysis.",
