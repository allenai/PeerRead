      "text" : "When evaluating the performance of a noisy optimisation algorithm, a key consideration is the stopping condition for the algorithm. A frequently used stopping condition in runtime analysis, known as “First Hitting Time”, is to stop the algorithm as soon as it encounters the optimal solution. However, this is unrealistic for real-world problems, as if the optimal solution were already known, there would be no need to search for it.\nThis paper argues that the use of First Hitting Time, despite being a commonly used approach, is significantly flawed and overestimates the quality of many algorithms in real-world cases, where the optimum is not known in advance and has to be genuinely searched for. A better alternative is to measure the quality of the solution an algorithm returns after a fixed evaluation budget, i.e., to focus on final solution quality. This paper argues that focussing on final solution quality is more realistic and demonstrates cases where the results produced by each algorithm evaluation method lead to very different conclusions regarding the quality of each noisy optimisation algorithm.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNoisy optimisation problems are important and commonplace in real-world applications, where evaluating the fitness of a solution may be subject to various forms of uncertainty. This paper deals with how to evaluate the performance of a noisy optimisation algorithm. The main purpose of the paper is to demonstrate that a commonly used measure, First Hitting Time (FHT), can give very misleading results: results which will not be indicative of real-world performance. The divergence between the performance measured by FHT and the real-world utility of the algorithm may be very large, as will be shown in the results (Section IV). The problem arises when an optimisation algorithm stumbles upon the optimal solution without being confident that it has found it. If the performance evaluator rewards an algorithm for merely visiting the optimum as opposed to returning the optimum as its best guess, then a significantly inflated estimate of the optimiser’s performance may be given.\nEvaluation of noisy optimisation algorithms: Commonly used measures of noisy optimisation algorithms are FHT when the search space is finite or countable, and the convergence rate in continuous domains. The FHT is the first time at which an optimum1 is visited. FHT is widely used to evaluate the performance of noisy optimisation algorithms in problems with discrete search space, such as various noisy versions of the OneMax problem [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. In the noisy case, some resampling techniques2 are often used aiming at cancelling the effect of noise [6], [7], [4]. In most of the previous work [1], [2], [4], the runtime analysis is based on the assumption that once the optimal solution is hit, an absorbing state is reached and the optimisation terminates. This assumption is not realistic in real-world applications, as if the optimal solution were known, no optimisation or search would be required.\nA better alternative to FHT is to measure the quality of the solution an algorithm returns after a fixed evaluation budget, i.e., to focus on final solution quality. This can focus on any measure of solution quality, but in this paper for ease of comparison and for clarity we focus on the success rate defined as the percentage of trials that the optimiser returns the optimal solution as its final solution.\nIn this paper we demonstrate the impact of choosing an appropriate methodology for evaluating a noisy optimisation algorithm. In particular, we do this by showing two test problems (described in Section II) where choosing an inapplicable evaluation methodology can lead to the opposite conclusion compared to choosing a more applicable one. We test two different optimisation algorithms: the Random Mutation Hill Climber (RMHC) and the (1+1)-EA under the two different evaluation methods, in order to demonstrate that the results are not unique to a single optimisation algorithm. These are described in Section III. Section IV summarises the results and discusses the dramatic impact that the evaluation method can have on the estimated performance of noisy optimisation algorithms and the prediction of the optimal resampling rate. Finally, Section V concludes that First Hitting Time should not\n1In this paper, the term “optimum” refers to the optimal solution, “optimal value” refers to the noise-free fitness value of the optimum.\n2The term “sampling” refers to sample the search points (solutions), while “resampling” stands for evaluating the identical solution more than once.\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n05 08\n6v 2\n[ cs\n.N E\n] 1\n2 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nbe used to evaluate the performance of a noisy optimisation algorithm."

The bit-string x can be:\n(P1) a parameter setting of an AI agent to play a given game (P2) or a parameter setting of a game for a given AI agent. The pretext for this problem is that we are trying to optimise the winning rate for a given agent but due to the stochastic nature of the game and / or the agent(s) playing it, the outcome of every simulation of the game is a win or a loss with a given probability. This leads to a very noisy optimisation problem.\nThe Noisy PMax problem was directly inspired by recent work on evolving game parameters in order to maximise the winning rate of a skilful agent over less skilful ones [8].\nIn this artificial model, x is treated as an n-bit binary number, and the true winning rate of x is defined as\nPwin(x) = V alue(x)\n(2n − 1) , (2)\nwhere V alue(x) denotes the numeric value of x located between 0 and 2n − 1. Thus, the outcome of a game is either loss (0) or win (1) with probability Pwin(x) (Eq. 2), as formalised in Eq. 3.\nG(x) = { 1 with probability Pwin(x), 0 otherwise. (3)\nWhile resampling a game r times, the average outcome, 1 r ∑r i=1G(x), is the winning rate measured over r repetitions of the game. By the Law of Large Numbers (LLN), for an r large enough, 1r ∑r i=1G(x) converges to Pwin(x)."

During evaluation, each solution is evaluated r times where r varies from 1 to 50. We call r the resampling rate. The pseudocode of RMHC and (1+1)-EA with resamplings are given in Algorithms 1 and 2. Note that in each algorithm the parent is re-evaluated at each iteration. Each experiment has been repeated 10,000 times using uniformly randomly initialised solutions. We chose the number of dimensions n = 10. This small number of dimensions helps to emphasise the difference in the results of the alternative evaluation methods, though differences are also present for higher-dimensional problems. The evaluation budget (i.e. the number of raw fitness evaluations allowed) was set to T = 500 for all experiments."

Qian et al. [2] stated that resampling was useless in the 10-bit Noisy OneMax problem described in this paper and Liu et al. [4] concluded that in the same noise model, the optimal resampling rate for the RMHC increased with the problem dimension, and for the 10-bit Noisy OneMax problem, the optimal resampling rate was 1. In both works [2], [4], the analysis was based on the condition that the optimisation terminated as soon as the optimum was found and there was no limit to the maximum number of fitness evaluations. Indeed, in line with those predictions, Figure 1b shows that the optimal resampling rate for the RMHC, using the FHT and the maximum number of fitness evaluations as the stopping conditions, is 1, while the rate for the RMHC using only the maximum number of fitness evaluations as the stopping condition is 7. The important point to note is that using FHT leads to a false conclusion regarding both the optimal success rate and the corresponding optimal resampling rate."

Table I illustrates that the (1+1)-EA using (E1) as the stopping condition gives the best success rate as 19.56%, but the true best success rate (without the assumption that the optimal solution is known) is only 1%; the RMHC using (E1) as the stopping condition gives the best success rate as 28.67%, but the true best success rate is only 1.14%. The percentage of times that an optimal solution is returned using the stopping condition (E1) is much higher than the percentage obtained when using the stopping condition (E2). However, having prior knowledge of the optimal solution and the access to the noise-free fitness is rare in real-world applications. Hence, the runtime analysis using the stopping condition (E1) is too optimistic and unrealistic."

      "heading" : "V. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current work around runtime analysis or prediction of the optimal resampling rate is based on the assumption that the optimal solution is known. Once the optimal noise-free fitness level is reached or the optimal solution is found, the optimisation stops immediately, thus the absorbing state is reached and the solution won’t escape from the absorbing state. In real-world applications, it is unlikely that we know the optimal solution in advance since there will be no reason to search for it.\nThe main conclusion is that First Hitting Time should not be used to evaluate the performance of noisy optimisation algorithms since it can dramatically over-estimate the performance of an algorithm, and may significantly under-estimate the amount of resampling required in order to obtain optimal performance. The conclusion is supported by the results of running two simple but widely used optimisation algorithms on two different test problems."
