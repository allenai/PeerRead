      "text" : "Formulated by Robert H. Goddard, see (Goddard, 1919), the problem is to establish the optimal thrust profile for a rocket ascending vertically from the Earth’s surface to achieve a given altitude with a given speed and pay load and with the minimum fuel expenditure. The aerodynamic drag and the gravitation varying with the altitude are considered. We study a problem version that assumes a bounded thrust. The problem has become a benchmark in the optimal control theory due to a characteristic singular arc behavior in connection with a relatively simple model structure, which makes the Goddard problem an ideal object of study, c.f. (Graichen and Petit, 2008)."

Please note that u ≤ 0 due to the fact that the mass of the rocket can only decrease (by burning the fuel). The control will be restricted to u ∈ [−3.5, 0].\nThe task is to find a control function u(h) so that we get from the initial state (m0, v0) to a terminal state (mT , vT ), where mT is the terminal mass and vT is the terminal speed at a given terminal altitude hT , v0 is the initial speed, and m0 > mT is the initial rocket mass (including fuel) so that the with a minimal fuel consumption (i.e, with a maximal final mass).\nFormula (11) can be rewritten as:\nu + m · v · dv dh + m · 1 h2 + 1 2 · s · cD · ρ0 · exp (β · (1− h)) · v2 = 0 .

Typically, the computed mass and speed values at the end of the segment will not lay in the discrete set of values of the mass and speed variables.

The control strategies found by the Runge-Kutta and the Gauss-Legendre methods have larger oscillations.
