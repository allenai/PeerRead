      "text" : "With regard to fast growing population around the world, the urban population in the 21st century is expected to increase dramatically. Hence, it is imperative that urban infrastructure is managed effectively to contend with this growth. One of the most critical consideration when designing modern cities is developing smart traffic management systems. The main goal of a traffic management system is reducing traffic congestion which nowadays is one of the major issues of megacities. Efficient urban traffic management results in timea and financial savings as well as reducing CO2 emission into atmosphere. To address this issue, a lot of solutions have been proposed [23, 4, 1, 22]. They can be roughly classified into three groups. The first is pre-timed signal control, where a fixed time is determined for all green phases according to historical traffic demand, without considering possible fluctuations in traffic demand. The second\nis vehicle-actuated signal control where, traffic demand information is used, provided by inductive loop detectors on an equipped intersection to decide to control the signals, e.g. extending or terminating a green phase. The third is adaptive signal control, where the signal timing control is managed and updated automatically according to the current state of the intersection (i.e. traffic demand, queue length of vehicles in each lane of the intersection and traffic flow fluctuation) [13]. In this study, we are interested in the third approach and aim to propose two novel methods for traffic signal control by leveraging recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence fields [26, 27].\nReinforcement learning [34] as a machine learning technique for traffic signal control problem has led to impressive results [4, 30] and has shown a promising potential solver. It does not need to have a perfect knowledge of the environment in advance, for example traffic flow. Instead they are able to gain knowledge and model the dynamics of the environment just by interacting with it. A reinforcement learning agent learns based on trial and error. It receives a scalar reward after taking each action in the environment. The obtained reward is based on how well the taken action is and the agent’s goal is to learn an optimal control policy so the discounted cumulative reward is maximized via repeated interaction with its environment. Aside from traffic control, reinforcement learning has been applied to a number of real world problems such as cloud computing [12, 11].\nTypically the complexity of using reinforcement learning in real world applications such as traffic signal management, grows exponentially as state and action spaces increase. To deal with this problem, function approximation techniques and hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches can be used. Recently, deep learning has gained huge attraction and has been successfully combined with reinforcement learning techniques to deal with complex optimization problems such as playing Atari 2600 games [27], Computer Go program [33], etc., where the classical RL methods could not provide optimal solutions. In this way, the current state of the environment is fed into a deep neural net (e.g. a convolutional neural network [20]) trained by reinforcement learning techniques to predict the next possible optimal action(s).\nInspired by the successes of combining reinforcement learning with deep learning paradigm and with regard to the complex nature of environment of traffic signal control problem, in this paper we aim to use the effectiveness and power of deep reinforcement learning to build adaptive signal control methods in order to optimize the traffic flow. Although a few previous studies have tried to apply deep reinforcement\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n08 88\n3v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n7 M\nay 2\n01 7\nlearning in the traffic signal control problem [38, 14], in this research the state representation is different. Also, One of our methods uses policy gradient method which does not suffer from oscillations and instabilities during training process and can take full advantage of the available data of the environment to develop the optimal control policy.\nWe propose adaptive signal controllers by combination two reinforcement learning approaches (i.e. policy gradient and action-value function) and a deep convolution neural network, which perceive embedded camera observations in order to produce control signals in an isolated intersection. We conduct simulated experiments with our proposed methods in SUMO traffic simulator.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides related work in the area of traffic light control (TLC). Section 3 gives a brief review of reinforcement learning techniques which we have used in this research. Section 4 presents how to formulate the TLC problem as a reinforcement learning task and the proposed methods to solve the task. Then Section 5 provides simulation results and the performance of the proposed approaches. Finally Section 6 concludes the paper and give some directions for future research."

      "text" : "A lot of research has been done in academic and industry communities to build adaptive traffic signal control systems. In particular, significant research has been conducted employing reinforcement learning methods in the area of traffic light signal control [39, 2, 7]. These works have achieved promising results. However, their simulation testbeds have not been mature enough to be comparable with more realistic situations. Developing advance traffic simulation tools have made researchers develop novel state representation and reward functions for reinforcement learning algorithms, which could consider more aspects of complexity and reality of real-world traffic problems [13, 1, 8, 3]. All this these attempts viewed the traffic light control problem as a fully observable Markov decision process (MDP) and investigated whether Q-learning algorithm can be applied to it. However, Richter’s study formulated the traffic problem as a partially observable MDP (POMDP) and applied policy gradient methods to guarantee local convergence under a partial observable environment [31].\nBy utilizing advances in deep learning and its application to different domains [10, 11], deep learning has gained attention in the area of traffic management systems. Previous research has used deep stacked autoencoders (SAE) neural networks to estimate Q-values, where each Q-value is corresponding to each available signal phase [21]. It considered measures of speed and queueing length as its state in each time step of learning process of its proposed method. Two recent studies by [38, 14] provided deep reinforcement learning agents that used deep Q-netwok [27] to map from given states to Q-values. Their state representations were a binary matrix of the positions of vehicles on the lanes of an intersection, and a combination of the presence matrix of vehicles, speed and the current traffic signal phase, respectively. However, we use raw visual input data of the traffic simulator snapshots as system states. Moreover, in addition to estimating Q-function, one of the proposed methods directly maps from the input state to a probability distribution over actions (i.e. signal phases) via deep policy gradient\nmethod."

      "heading" : "3.1 Reinforcement Learning",
      "text" : "A common reinforcement learning [34] setting is shown in Figure 1 where an RL agent interacts with an environment. The interaction is continued until reaching a terminal state or the agent meets a termination condition. Usually the problems that RL techniques are applied to, are treated as Markov decision processes (MDPs). A MDP is defined as a five-tuple < S,A, T,R, γ > , where S is the set of states in the state space of the environment, A is the set of actions in the action space that the agent can use in order to interact with the environment, T is the transition function, which is the probability of moving between the environment states, R is the reward function and γ ∈ [0, 1] is known as the discount factor, which models the importance of the future and immediate rewards. At each time step t, the agent perceives the state st ∈ S and, based on its observation, selects an action at. Taking the action, leads to the state of the environment transitions to the next states st+1 ∈ S regarding the transition function T . Then, the agent receives reward rt which is determined by the reward function R.\nThe goal of the learning agent in reinforcement learning framework is to learn an optimal policy π : S × A → [0, 1] which defines the probability of selecting action at in state st, so that with following the underlying policy the expected cumulative discounted reward over time is maximized. The discounted future reward, Rt at time t is defined as follows:\nRt = E[ ∞∑ k=0 γkrt+k], (1)\nwhere the role of the discount factor γ is to trade off the worth of immediate and future rewards. In most real world problems, there are many states and actions which make it impossible to apply classic reinforcement learning techniques, which consider tabular representations for their state and action spaces. For example, in the problem of traffic light optimization, that we interest in this paper, the state space is continuous. Hence, it is common to use function approximators [42] or decomposition and aggregation techniques like Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approaches [5, 15, 28] and advance HRL [16].\nDifferent forms of function approximators can be used with reinforcement learning techniques. For example, linear function approximation, a linear combination of feature of state and action spaces f and learned weights w (e.g.∑ i fiw) or a non-linear function approximation (e.g. a neural network). Until recently, the majority of work in reinforcement learning has been applying linear function approximatiors. More recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), stacked auto-encoders (SAE), etc. have also been commonly used as function approximators for large reinforcement learning tasks [19, 26]. The interested readers are referred to [29] for a review of using deep neural networks\nwith reinforcement learning framework."

      "text" : "Deep learning techniques are one of the best solutions to address high dimensional data and extract discriminative information from the data. Deep learning algorithms have the capability of automating feature extraction (the extraction of representations) from the data. The representation are learnt through the data which are fed directly into deep nets without using human knowledge (i.e. automated feature extraction). Deep learning models contain multiple layers of representations. Indeed, it is a stack of building blocks such as auto-encoders, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and convolutional layers. During training, the raw data is fed into a network consisting of multiple layers. The output of the each layer which is nonlinear feature transformations, is used as inputs to the next layers of the deep neural network. The output representation of the final layer can be used for constricting classifiers or those applications which can have the better efficiency and performance with abstract representation of the data in a hierarchical manner as inputs. A nonlinear transformation is applied at each layer on its input to try to learn and extract underlying explanatory factors. Consequently, this process learns a hierarchy of abstract representations.\nOne of the main advantages of deep neural networks is the capability of automating feature extraction from row input data. A deep Q-learning Network (DQN) [26] uses this benefit of deep learning in order to represent the agent’s observation as an abstract representation in learning an optimal control policy. The DQN method aggregates a deep neural network function approximator with Q-learning to learn action value function and as a result a policy π, the behaviour of the agent which tells the agent what action should be selected for each input state. Applying non-linear function approximators such as neural networks with modelfree reinforcement learning algorithms in high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces, has some convergence problems [37]. The reasons for these issues are: 1) Consecutive states in reinforcement learning tasks have correlation. 2) The underlying policy of the agent is changing frequently, because of slight changes in Q-values. To cope with these problems, the DQN provides some solutions which improve the performance of the algorithm significantly. For the prob-\nlem of correlated states, DQN uses the previously proposed experience replay approach [24]. In this way, at each time step, the DQN stores the agent’s experience (st, at, rt, rt+1) into a date set D, where st, at, and rt are the state, chosen action and received reward, respectively and st+1 is the state at the next time step. To update the network, the DQN utilizes stochastic minibatch updates with uniformly random sampling from the experience replay memory (previous observed transitions) at training time. This negates strong correlations between consecutive samples. Another approach to deal with aforementioned convergence issues, which we also examine in this research, is the policy gradient methods. This approach has demonstrated better convergence properties in some RL problems [35]."

      "heading" : "3.3 Policy Gradient Methods",
      "text" : "A Policy Gradient (PG) method tries to optimize a parameterized policy function by gradient descent method. Indeed, policy gradient methods are interested in searching policy space to learn policies directly, instead of estimating state-value or action-value functions. Unlike the traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, PG methods do not suffer from the convergence problems of estimating value functions under nonlinear function approximation or in the environments which might be partially observable MDPs. They can also deal with the complexity of continuous state and action spaces better than purely value-based methods [35]. Policy gradient methods estimate policy gradients using Monte Carlo estimates of the policy gradients [6]. These methods are guaranteed to converge to a local optimum of their parametrized policy function. However, typically PG methods result in high variance in their gradient estimates. Hence, in order to reduce the variance of the gradient estimators, some methods subtract a base line function from the policy gradients. The baseline function can be calculated in different manners [32, 40]. By inspiring these features of PG methods and successes of neural networks in automatic feature abstractions, we use deep neural networks to represent an optimal traffic control policy directly in the traffic signal control problem."

      "text" : "We represent the state of the system as an image st ∈ Rd or a snapshot of the current state of a graphical simulator (e.g. SUMO-GUI [18]) which is a vector of row pixel values of current view of the intersection at each step of simulation (as shown in Figure 1). This kind of representation is like putting a camera on an intersection which enables it to view the whole intersection. The state representation in the traffic light control literature usually uses a vector representing the presence of a vehicle at the intersection, a Boolean-valued vector where a value 1 indicates the presence of a vehicle and a value 0 indicates the absence of a vehicle [38, 36], or a combination of the presence vector with another vector indicating the vehicle’s speed at the given intersection [14]. Regardless of these states representations that are using a prior knowledge provided, they make as-\nsumptions which are not generalizable for the real world. For instance, they discretize a lane segment of an intersection into cells with a constant length c which is supposed to be the vehicle length to build the vehicle’s speed and presence vectors. However, by feeding the state as an image to a convolutional neural network, the system can detect the location and presence of all vehicles with different lengths and as result the vehicles’ queue on each lane. Furturmore, by stacking a history of consecutive observations as input, the convolutional layers of a deep network are able to estimate velocity and travel direction of vehicles. Hence, the system can implicitly benefit from these information as well."

EWG allows vehicles to pass from East to West and vice versa, and implies the vehicles on North/South route should stop and not proceed through the intersection. At each time step t, an agent regarding its strategy chooses an action at ∈ A. Depending the selected action, the vehicles on each lane are allowed to cross the intersection."

The total cumulative delay at time t, is the summation of the cumulative delay of all the vehicles appeared from t = 0 to current time step t in the system. The positive reward values imply the taken actions led to decrease the total cumulative delay and the negative rewards imply an increase in the delay. With regard to the reward values, the agent may decide to change its policy in certain states of the system in the future."

The policy distribution π(at|st; θ) is learned by performing gradient descent on the policy parameters. In the value-function based algorithm, the deep neural network is utilized to estimate the action-value function. The actionvalue function maps the input state to action values, which each represents the future reward that can be achieved for the given state and action.

In this research, the agent aims to maximize the reduction in the total cumulative delay, which empirically has been shown to maximize throughput and to reduce queue length (more details discussed in Section 5.3).\nThe objective of agent is to maximize the expected cumulative discounted reward. We aim to maximize the reward under the probability distribution π(at|st; θ):\nJ(θ) = Eπθ [ T∑ t=0 γtrt] = Eπθ [R]. (3)\nWe divide the system training based two RL approaches: Value-function based and Policy-based. in value-function based approach, the value function, Qπ(s, a) is defined as follows:\nQπ(s, a) = Eπ[rt + γmaxa′Q(s ′, a′)|s, a] (4)\nWhere it is implicit that s, s′ ∈ S and a ∈ A. the value function can be parameterized, Q(s, s; θ) with parameter vector θ. Typically, the gradient-descent methods are used to learn parameters, θ by trying to minimize the following loss function of mean-squared error in Q values:\nJ(θ) = Eπ[(r + γmaxa′Q(s ′, a′; θ)−Q(s, a; θ))2] (5)\nWhere r + γmaxa′Q(s ′, a′; θ) is the target value. In the DQN algorithm, a target Q-network is used to address the instability problem of the policy. The network is trained with the target Q-network to obtain consistent Q-learning targets by keeping the weight parameters (θ−) used in the Qlearning target fixed and updating them periodically every N steps through the parameters of the main network, θ. The target value of the DQN is represented as follows:\nyi = r + γmaxa′Q(s ′, a′; θ−i−1) (6)\nWhere θ− is parameters of the target network. The stochastic gradient descent method is used in order to optimize equation (5). The parameters of the deep Q-learning algorithm are updated as follows:\nθi ← θi−1 + α(yi −Q(s, a; θi))5θi Q(s, a; θi) (7)\nWhere yi is the target value for iteration i and α is a scalar learning rate. Algorithm 4.4 presents the pseudo-code for the training algorithm.\nIn policy-based approach, The gradient of the objective function represented in equation (3) is given by:\n5θ J = T∑ t=0 Eπθ [5θlog(at|st; θ)Rt]. (8)\nThis equation (8) is standard learning rule of the REINFORCE algorithm [41]. It updates the policy parameters θ in the direction 5θlog(at|st; θ) so that the probability of action at at state st is increased if it has led to high cumulative reward, however it is decreased if the action has result in a low reward. The gradient estimate in equation 2 results to have high variance. It is common to reduce the variance by subtracting a baseline function bt(st) from the return Rt, without changing expectation. Commonly an estimate of the state value function is used as the baseline, bt(st) = V\nπθv (st). Thus, the adjusted gradient is 5θlog(at|st; θ)(Rt − bt(st)). The value Rt − bt is known as the advantage function.\nWith regard to the advantage actor-critic method [25], computing a single update is done by selecting actions using the underlying policy for up to M steps or till a terminal state is met. In this way, the agent obtains up to M rewards from the environment at each update point and updates the policy parameters after every n ≤M steps regarding n-step returns. The vector parameters θ is updated through the stochastic gradient descent method:\nθ ← θ + α ∑ t 5θlog(at|st; θ)A(st, at; θ, θv), (9)\nwhere A(st, at; θ, θv) is an estimate of the advantage function corresponding ∑n−1 i=0 γ irt+i + γ nV (st+n; θ)− V (st; θv), where n might have different values with respect to the state, up to M . this process is an actor-critic algorithm, the policy\nπ(at|st; θ) refers to the actor and the estimate of the state value function V πθv (st) implies to the critic [9, 25].

      "text" : "To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we compared them against a baseline traffic controller, a controller that gives an equal fixed time to each phase of the intersection. We ran SUMO-GUI simulator for the proposed model using the configuration setting explained in Section 5.2 and compared the average reward, average total cumulative delay and average queue length achieved to the baseline. Figure 3 shows the received average reward while the agent follows a certain policy. As shown in Figure 3, the proposed method performs significantly better than the baseline and results more reward magnitudes by doing more epochs. This gradually increasing reward reflects the agent’s ability to learn an optimal control policy in a stable manner. Unlike using deep reinforcement learning for estimating the Q-values in traffic light optimisation problem [38], the proposed agent doesn’t suffer stability issues. In order to assess the learned policy by the agent, two of the most common performance metrics in the traffic signal control literature is implemented: the cumulative delay and queue length. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the performance comparison of the leaning agent regarding average cumulative delay time and\naverage queue length metrics, respectively, to the baseline, while the agent is following the learning policy over time. The plots clearly show the agent is able to find a policy resulting minimizing queue length and total cumulative delay. Moreover, these graphs reveal that by using the reward function for reducing cumulative delay, the intersection queue length is reduced as well as the total cumulative delay of all vehicles.\nWe also compared the proposed methods with the SNN, which is a shallow neural network with one hidden layer. Table 1 reports a comparison of the proposed models and the SNN model in terms of the average and standard deviation (µ, σ) of average queue length, average cumulative delay time and the received average reward metrics. The results on Table 1 are calculated from the last 100 training epochs of each method. Comparing the metrics shown in Table 1, demonstrates that the proposed models significantly outperform the SNN method. Based on the data in Table 1 we can induce 67% and 72% reductions in the average cumulative delay and queue length for the policy gradient method and 68% and 73% reductions for value-function based method compared to the SNN. Furthermore, we can see that the proposed methods have received average rewards superior to the SNN. Considering these results, it is obvious that the policy gradient and value-function agents could learn the control policies better than the SNN approach."

      "heading" : "6. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "In this paper, we applied deep reinforcement learning algorithms with focusing on both policy and value-function based methods to traffic signal control problem in order to find optimal control policies of signalling, just by using raw visual input data of the traffic simulator snapshots. Our approaches have led to promising results and showed they could find more stable control policies compared to previous work of using deep reinforcement learning in traffic light optimization. In our work, we developed and tested the proposed methods in a small application, extending the work for more complex traffic simulations, for instance consider-\ning many intersections and multiple agents to control each intersection, using multi-agent learning techniques to handle coordination problem between agents would be a direction for future research."

Inspired by these successes, in this paper, we build two kinds of reinforcement learning algorithms: deep policy-gradient and value-function based agents which can predict the best possible traffic signal for a traffic intersection. At each time step, these adaptive traffic light control agents receive a snapshot of the current state of a graphical traffic simulator and produce control signals. The policy-gradient based agent maps its observation directly to the control signal, however the value-function based agent first estimates values for all legal control signals. The agent then selects the optimal control action with the highest value. Our methods show promising results in a traffic network simulated in the SUMO traffic simulator, without suffering from instability issues during the training process.",
