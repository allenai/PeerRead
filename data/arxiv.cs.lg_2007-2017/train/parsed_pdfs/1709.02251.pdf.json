      "text" : "Understanding human emotions is a key component to improve human-computer interactions [1]. A wide range of applications can bene t from emotion recognition such as customer call center, computer tutoring systems and mental health diagnoses.\nDimensional emotion is one of the most popular computing models for emotion recognition [2]. It maps an emotion state into a point in a continuous space. Typically the space consists of three dimensions: arousal (a measure of a ective activation), valence (a measure of pleasure) and dominance (a measure of power or control). is representation can express natural, subtle and complicated emotions. ere have been many research works on dimensional emotion analysis for be er understanding human emotions in recent years [3–5].\nSince emotions are conveyed through various human behaviours, past works have utilized a broad range of modalities for emotion recognition including speech [6], text [7], facial expression [8], gesture [9], physiological signals [10], etc. Among them, facial expression and speech are the most common channels to transmit human emotions. It is bene cial to use multiple modalities for emotion recognition.\nFusion strategies for di erent modalities in previous works can be divided into 3 categories, namely feature-level (early) fusion, decision-level (late) fusion and model-level fusion [11]. Early fusion ∗Corresponding author.\nuses the concatenated features from di erent modalities as input features for classi ers. It has been widely used in the literature to successfully improve performance [12]. However, it su ers from the curse of dimensionality. Also it’s not very useful when features are not synchronized in time. Late fusion eliminates some disadvantages of early fusion. It combines the predictions of di erent modalities and trains a second level model such as RVM [13], BLSTM [14]. But it ignores interactions and correlations between di erent modality features. Model-level fusion is a compromise between the two extremes. e implementation of model-level fusion depends on the speci c classi ers. For example, for neural networks, modellevel fusion could be concatenation of di erent hidden layers from di erent modalities [15]. For kernel classi ers, model-level fusion could be kernel fusion [16]. As for Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classi ers, novel forms of feature interactions have been proposed [17].\nIn this paper, we propose a novel architecture for the fusion of di erent modalities called conditional a ention fusion. We use Long-short termmemory recurrent neural networks (LSTMs) as the basic model for each uni-modality since LSTMs are able to capture long time dependencies. For each time step, the fusion model learns how much of a entions it should put on each modality conditioning on its current input multi-modal features and recent history information. is approach is similar to human perceptions since humans can dynamically focus on more obvious and trustful modalities to understand emotions. Unlike early fusion, we dynamically combine predictions of di erent modalities, which avoids the curse of dimensionality and synchronization between di erent features. And unlike late fusion, the input features are interacted in a higher level to learn the current a ention instead of being isolated without any interactions among di erent modalities. e main architecture is shown in Figure 2. We use the AVEC2015 dimensional emotion dataset [5] to evaluate our methods. e results shows the e ectiveness of our new fusion architecture."

We de ne the conditional a ention fusion of the predictions from the two modalities at timestep t as:\nŷt = λt · fθa (x a t ,h a t−1) + (1 − λt ) · fθv (x v t ,h v t−1) (2)\nλt = σ (Wд[hat |hvt |xat |xvt ]) (3)\nwhere [hat |hvt |xat |xvt ] is the concatenation of the representations inside the bracket.\ne λt is calculated based on the current audio and visual features and their high-level history information for two reasons. Firstly, the current input features are the most direct indicators to show whether the modality is reliable. For example, for facial features, inputs lled with 0s suggest that the current face detection fails and thus should be assigned with less con dence. Secondly, the weights assigned to each modality would be smoothed by considering highlevel history featureshvt andhat in addition to current input features. In this way, the model can dynamically pay a ention to di erent modalities, which could improve the stability in di erent situations."

      "text" : "Intuitively, the acoustic features are more reliable when the acoustic energy is higher, because the headset microphone can record speech from both the subject speaker and other speakers in conversations.\nHigher energy may refers to higher con dence that the speech is from the target subject. Similarly the facial features are reliable only when faces are correctly detected. So adding such side information might be bene cial to learn the a ention weights.\nWe transform the acoustic energy into scale [0, 1], and we use дat to denote its value at the t th timestep. For visual features, we use дvt ∈ {0, 1} to indicate whether the subject’s face is detected since the face detection provided in the dataset has no detection con dence. We therefore de ne the nal loss function for one sequence as follows:\nL д t = 1 2 (α(д a t − λt )2 + β(дvt − (1 − λt ))2) (4)\nL = ∑ t 1 2 (ŷt − yt ) 2 + Lдt (5)\nwhere α and β are hyper-parameters and are optimized on the development set. In practice, α and β are usually set to small values around 10−2 to avoid Lдt over-a ecting on λt .\ne derivative of Lдt with respect to λt is as follows:\n∂L д t ∂λt = βдvt − αдat − β + (α + β)λt (6)\nWhen дat is high and дvt is low, (6) is close to (α + β)(λt − 1) (the extreme case when дat = 1 and дvt = 0). e derivative is less than 0, which will push λt to increase to give acoustic features more con dence. But when дat → 0 and дvt → 1, (6) is close to (α + β)λt , which is larger than 0 and will push λt to decrease to focus on visual features. When дat ≈ дvt , the absolute value of the derivative would be small and thus Lдt has less in uence on λt ."

Acoustic features achieve the best performance on the arousal prediction and visual features are slightly be er than acoustic features on valence prediction.\ne performance of di erent fusion methods on arousal prediction is shown in Figure 4(a). Early fusion achieves the average best performance and our proposed fusion method performs the second best among all the fusion strategies. However, there is no signi cant di erence between early fusion prediction and acoustic uni-modality prediction comparing Figure 4(a) with Table 1 (Student t-test with p-value = 0.07). We nd that there exists a strong correlation between arousal and the acoustic energy, as shown in Figure 3 where we smooth the acoustic energy with window 100 and shi and scale it according to the mean and standard deviation between energy and arousal labels. And their Pearson Correlation Coe cient on development set is high to 0.558 and CCC is 0.4. is suggests that humans’ perception of arousal may mainly base on acoustic features so fusing other modalities may bring less bene t.\nBut for valence prediction, all the fusion strategies outperform the original uni-modality models (as shown in Table 1). An interesting nding is that the higher level the fusion strategy applies, the be er performance is achieved as shown in Figure 4(b). Among them, our proposed conditional a ention fusion model achieves the best performance and signi cantly surpasses other fusion strategies by t-test (p¡0.02 compared with the second best fusion strategy late fusion, and p¡0.007 compared with others). is indicates that dynamically adapting fusion weights for di erent modalities is bene cial.\nTable 2 shows the CCC performance with and without Lдt in loss function. We can see that considering Lдt in loss function can further improve performance since it helps to guide the importance of di erent modalities. It is might because of the insu ciency of data that the model is unable to learn the a ention weights e ectively without any supervised information. We also observe\nin our experiments that when α and β are around 10−2, there is no signi cant change in prediction performance.\nFigure 5 shows some examples of the emotion predictions from the conditional a ention fusion method. e upper row shows the case where most of the visual features are missing and the bo om row is another case where the visual features can be extracted in most frames. We can see that the fusion method can make use of the complementary information automatically from audio and visual features in these two situations.\ne valence prediction performance of the conditional a ention fusion method on testing set is shown in Table 3. Chen et al. [19] use the same feature set as ours and Chao et al. [24] use more features including CNNs for valence prediction. e comparison further demonstrates the e ectiveness of the conditional a ention fusion method."

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion strategy named conditional aention fusion, which can dynamically pay aention to dierent modalities at each time step. Long-short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN) is applied as the basic uni-modality model to capture long time dependencies. e weights assigned to dierent modalities are automatically decided by the current input features and recent history information rather than being xed at any kinds of situation. Our experimental results on a benchmark dataset AVEC2015 show the eectiveness of our method which outperforms several common fusion strategies for valence prediction.",
