      "text" : "Deep neural networks – i.e. convolutional networks (LeCun et al., 1989), LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997a) or GRUs (Cho et al., 2014) – achieve state of the art results on a range of challenging tasks like object classification and detection (Szegedy et al., 2014), semantic segmentation (Visin et al., 2015), speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012), statistical machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014), playing Atari (Mnih et al., 2013) and Go (Silver et al., 2016). When trained with variants of SGD (Bottou, 1998) deep models can be hard to optimize due to their highly non-linear and nonconvex nature (Choromanska et al., 2014; Dauphin et al., 2014).\nA number of approaches were proposed to alleviate the difficulty of optimization: addressing the problem of the internal covariate shift with Batch Normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), learning with a curriculum (Bengio et al., 2009) and recently training with diffusion (Mobahi, 2016) - a form of continuation method. At the same time, the impact of noise injection on the behavior of modern deep models has been explored in (Neelakantan et al., 2015) and it has been recently shown that noisy activation functions improve performance on a wide variety of tasks (Gulcehre et al., 2016).\nIn this paper, we connect the ideas of curriculum learning and continuation methods with those arising from models with skip connections and with layers that compute near-identity transformations. Skip connections allow to train very deep residual and highway architectures (He et al., 2015; Srivastava et al., 2015) by skipping layers or block of layers. Similarly, it is now well known that it is possible to stochastically change the depth of a network during training (Huang et al., 2016b) and still converge.\nIn this work, we introduce the idea of mollification – a form of differentiable smoothing of the loss function connected to noisy activations – which can be interpreted as a form adaptive noise injection that only depends on a single hyperparameter. Inspired by Huang et al. (2016b), we exploit the\n∗ This work was done while these students were interning at the MILA lab. at the University of Montreal\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n04 98\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n7 A\nug 2\n01 6\nsame hyperparameter to stochastically control the depth of our network. This allows us to start the optimization in the easier setting of a convex objective function (as long as the optimized criterion is convex, e.g. linear regression, logistic regression) and to slowly introduce more complexity into the model by annealing the hyperparameter making the network deeper and increasingly non-linear."

      "heading" : "2.1 Continuation and Annealing Methods",
      "text" : "Continuation methods and simulated annealing provide a general strategy to reduce the impact of local minima and deal with non-convex, continuous, but not necessarily everywhere differentiable objective functions.\nContinuation methods (Allgower and Georg, 1980), address a complex optimization problem by smoothing the original function, turning it into a different problem that is easier to optimize. By gradually reducing the amount of smoothing, it is possible to consider a sequence of optimization problems that converge to the optimization problem of interest (see Fig. 1).\nThese methods have been very successful for tackling difficult optimization problems involving nonconvex objective functions with multiple local minima and possibly points of non-differentiability. In machine learning, approaches based on curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009) are inspired by this principle to define a sequence of gradually more difficult training tasks (or training distributions) that converge to the task of interest. Gradient-based optimization over a sequence of mollified objective functions has been shown to converge (Chen, 2012).\nIn the context of stochastic gradient descent, we can use an estimator of the gradient of the smoothed objective function. This is convenient because actually computing the smoothed objective function may not be analytically feasible, but a Monte-Carlo estimate can often be obtained easily. Definition 2.1. Weak gradients (Distributional Gradients) We generalize the definition of weak/distributional derivatives to gradients in order to show the relationship with training neural networks. For an integrable function L in space L ∈ L([a, b]), g ∈ L([a, b]n) is a n-dimensional weak gradient of L if it satisfies the Eq. 1:∫\nC g(θ)K(θ)dθ = − ∫ C L(θ)∇K(θ)dθ, (1)\nwhere K(θ) is an infinitely differentiable function vanishing at infinity and C ∈ [a, b]n, θ ∈ Rn is a parameter vector and L(θ) is the cost function that we would like to minimize. Definition 2.2. Mollifiers A mollifier is an infinitely differentiable function that behaves as an approximate identity in the group of convolutions of integrable functions. K is a mollifier if it is infinitely differentiable and for any integrable function L we have:\nL(θ) = lim →0\n∫ −1K(x/ )L(θ − x)dx.\nA mollifier converges to the Dirac function if we rescale it appropriately. In general, we are interested in constructing a sequence of mollifiers indexed by , which in the above integral corresponds to −1K(x/ ). This allows one to construct a sequence of gradually less blurred and closer approximations to L. We can define a weak gradient of a non-differentiable function by convolving it with a mollifier (Evans, 1998):\n∇(L ∗K)(θ) = (L ∗ ∇K)(θ).\nWe can choose K(·) to be the density function of an accessible distribution such as a Gaussian distribution. In the limit, the gradient of a mollified function is equivalent to its mollified weakgradients:\ng(θ) = − lim →0\n∫ −1K(x/ )g(θ − x)dx.\nFrom the properties of weak-gradients presented in Eq. 1, we know that:\ng(θ) = lim →0\n∫ −1∇K(x/ )L(θ − x)dx.\nAn important property of mollifiers and weak-gradients is that they allow to backpropagate through functions that don’t have strong derivatives defined everywhere, such as e.g. a step function.\nWe can obtain the mollified version LK(θ) of the cost function L(θ) by convolving it with a mollifier K(θ). Similarly to the analysis in Mobahi (2016), we can write a Monte-Carlo estimate of LK(θ) = (L ∗ K)(θ) ≈ 1N ∑N i=1 L(θ − ξ(i)). We provide the derivation and the gradient of this equation in Appendix A. K(·) is the kernel which we mollify with and corresponds to the average effect of injecting noise ξ sampled from standard Normal distribution. The amount of noise controls the amount of smoothing. Gradually reducing the noise during training is related to a form of simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983).\nThis result can be easily extended to neural networks, where the layers typically take the form:\nhl = f(Wlhl−1) (2)\nwith hl−1 a vector of activations from the layer below, Wl a matrix representing a linear transformation and f an element-wise non-linearity of choice.\nA mollification of such a layer can be formulated as:\nhl = f((Wl − ξl)hl−1), where ξl ∼ N (µ, σ2) (3)"

      "heading" : "2.2 Generalized and Noisy Mollifiers",
      "text" : "We introduce a slight generalization of the concept of mollifiers that encompasses the approach we explored here and that is targeted at optimization via a continuation method using stochastic gradient descent. Definition 2.3. (Generalized Mollifier). A generalized mollifier is a transformation Tσ(f) in Rk to Rk of a function f such that:\nlim σ→0 Tσf = f, (4)\nf0 = lim σ→∞ Tσf is convex (5)\n∂(Tσf)(x)\n∂x exists ∀x, σ > 0 (6)\nIn addition we consider noisy mollifiers which can be defined as the expected value of a stochastic function φ(x, ξ) under some noise source ξ with variance σ:\n(Tσf)(x) = Eξ[φ(x, ξσ)] (7)\nDefinition 2.4. (Noisy Mollifier). We call a stochastic function φ(x, ξσ) with input x and noise ξ a noisy mollifier if its expected value corresponds to the application of a generalized mollifier Tσ, as per Eq. 7.\nThe composition of two noisy mollifiers sharing the same σ is a noisy mollifier, since the three properties in the definition (Eqs. 4,5,6) are satisfied. When σ = 0 no noise is injected and therefore the original function is being optimized. If σ →∞ instead, the function will become convex. Consequently, corrupting separately the activation function of each level of a deep neural network (but with a shared noise level σ) and annealing σ yields a noisy mollifier for the objective function. This is related to the work of Mobahi (2016), who recently introduced analytic smooths of neural network non-linearities in order to help training recurrent networks. The differences with the work presented here are twofold: we use a noisy mollifier (rather than an analytic smooth of the network non-linearities) and we introduce (in the next section) a particular form of the noisy mollifier that empirically proved to work very well.\nMobahi (2016) also makes a link between continuation or annealing methods and noise injection, although an earlier form of that observation was already made by Bottou (1991) in the context of gradually decreasing the learning rate when doing stochastic gradient descent. The idea of injecting noise into a hard-saturating non-linearity was previously used in Bengio (2013) to help backpropagate signals through semi-hard decisions (with the “noisy rectifier” stochastic non-linearity)."

      "heading" : "3 Method",
      "text" : "We focus on improving the optimization of neural networks with tanh(·) and sigmoid(·) activation functions, since those have been known to be particularly challenging to optimize and play a crucial role in models that involve gating (e.g. LSTM, GRU) as well as piecewise linear activations such as ReLUs. However the general principles we present in this paper can be easily adapted to the other activation functions as well.\nWe propose a novel learning algorithm to mollify the cost of a neural network that addresses an important drawback of previously proposed noisy training procedures: as the noise gets larger it can dominate the learning process and lead the algorithm to perform a random walk on the energy landscape of the objective function. Conversely in the algorithm we propose in this paper, as the noise gets larger the SGD minimizes a simpler e.g. convex, but still meaningful objective function. To this end we define the desired behavior of the network in the limit cases where the noise is very large or very small, and modify the model architecture accordingly.\nIn other words during training we minimize a sequence of noisy objectives L = (L1(θ; ξσ1),L2(θ; ξσ2), · · · ,Lk(θ; ξσk)) where the scale (variance) of the noise σi and the simplicity of the objective function will be reduced during the training. Our model still satisfies the basic properties of the generalized and noisy mollifiers.\nInstead of mollifying our objective function with a kernel, we propose to mimic the properties of the mollification that are important for the continuation by reformulating our objective function such that:\n1. We start the training by optimizing a convex objective function which is obtained by configuring all layers between the input and the last cost layer to compute an identity function. On the other hand, a high level of noise controlled with a single scalar p ∈ [0, 1] per layer assures that element-wise activation functions compute a linear function.\n2. As the noise level p is annealed we move from identity transformations to arbitrary linear transformations between layers.\n3. Simultaneously the decreasing level of noise p allows element-wise activation functions to become non-linear.\nOn the other hand, this kind of noisy training is potentially helpful for the generalization as well, since the noise in the noisy mollified model will make the backpropagation to be noisy as well. Due to the noise induced by the backpropagation through the noisy units Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997b), SGD is more likely to converge to a flatter-minima because the noise will help SGD escape from sharper local minima."

For pl = 1, the layer computes the identity function leading to a convex objective. If pl = 0 the layer computes the original non-linear transformation unfolding the full capacity of the model.\nLinearizing the network In section 2, we show that convolving the objective function with a particular kernel can be approximated by adding noise to the activation function. This method may suffer from excessive random exploration when the noise is very large.\nWe address this issue by bounding the element-wise activation function f(·) with its linear approximation when the variance of the noise is very large, after centering it at the origin. The resulting function f∗(·) is bounded and centered around the origin. Note that centering the sigmoid or hard-sigmoid will make them symmetric with respect to the origin.

When trained with variants of SGD (Bottou, 1998) deep models can be hard to optimize due to their highly non-linear and nonconvex nature (Choromanska et al., 2014; Dauphin et al., 2014). A number of approaches were proposed to alleviate the difficulty of optimization: addressing the problem of the internal covariate shift with Batch Normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), learning with a curriculum (Bengio et al., 2009) and recently training with diffusion (Mobahi, 2016) - a form of continuation method.

In this paper, we connect the ideas of curriculum learning and continuation methods with those arising from models with skip connections and with layers that compute near-identity transformations. Skip connections allow to train very deep residual and highway architectures (He et al., 2015; Srivastava et al., 2015) by skipping layers or block of layers. Similarly, it is now well known that it is possible to stochastically change the depth of a network during training (Huang et al., 2016b) and still converge. In this work, we introduce the idea of mollification – a form of differentiable smoothing of the loss function connected to noisy activations – which can be interpreted as a form adaptive noise injection that only depends on a single hyperparameter.

In this paper, we attack the problem of optimization of highly non-convex neural networks by starting with a smoothed – or mollified – objective function which becomes more complex as the training proceeds. Our proposition is inspired by the recent studies in continuation methods: similar to curriculum methods, we begin learning an easier (possibly convex) objective function and let it evolve during the training, until it eventually goes back to being the original, difficult to optimize, objective function. The complexity of the mollified networks is controlled by a single hyperparameter which is annealed during the training. We show improvements on various difficult optimization tasks and establish a relationship between recent works on continuation methods for neural networks and mollifiers.",
