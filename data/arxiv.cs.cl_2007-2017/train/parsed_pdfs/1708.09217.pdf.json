      "text" : "Neural machine translation (NMT) has significantly improved the quality of machine translation in recent several years [10,26,1,9], in which the attention model increasingly plays an important role. Unlike traditional statistical machine translation (SMT) [13,4,32] which contains multiple separately tuned components, NMT builds upon a single and large neural network to directly map source sentence to associated target sentence.\nTypically, NMT adopts the encoder-decoder architecture which consists of two recurrent neural networks. The encoder network models the semantics of the source sentence and transforms the source sentence into context vector representation, from which the decoder network generates the target translation word by word. Attention mechanism has become an indispensable component in NMT, which enables the model to dynamically compose source representation for each timestep during decoding, instead of a single and static representation. Specifically, the attention model shows which source words the model should focus on in order to predict the next target word.\nHowever, previous attention models are mainly designed to predict the alignment of a target word with respect to source words, which take no account of the\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n09 21\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\n0 A\nug 2\n2 !\"#$%\n&'#(%)*\nfact that the generation of a target word may have a stronger correlation with the previous generated target words. Recurrent neural networks, such as gated recurrent units (GRU) [5] and long short term memory (LSTM) [8], still suffer from long-distance dependency problems, according to pioneering studies [1,12] that the performance of NMT is getting worse as source sentences get longer. Figure 1 illustrates an example of Chinese-English translation. The dependency relationship of target sentence determines whether the predicate of the sentence should be singular (is) or plural (are). While the conventional attention model does not have a specific mechanism to learn the dependency relationship between target words.\nTo address this problem, we propose in this paper a novel look-ahead attention mechanism for generation in NMT, which can directly model the longdistance dependency relationship between target words. The look-ahead attention model does not only align to source words, but also refer to the previous generated target words when generating a target word. Furthermore, we present and investigate three patterns for the look-ahead attention, which can be integrated into any attention-based NMT. To show the effectiveness of our look-ahead attention, we have conducted experiments on NIST Chinese-to-English translation tasks and WMT14 English-to-German translation tasks. Experiments show that our proposed model obtains significant BLEU score improvements over strong SMT baselines and a state-of-the-art NMT baseline."

      "text" : "Our framework integrating the look-ahead attention mechanism into NMT can be applied in any conventional attention model. Without loss of generality, we use the improved attention-based NMT proposed by Luong et al. [16], which utilizes stacked LSTM layers for both encoder and decoder as illustrated in Figure 2.\nThe NMT first encodes the source sentence X = (x1, x2, ..., xm) into a sequence of context vector representation C = (h1, h2, ..., hm) whose size varies\n1 http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/index.jsp.\nwith respect to the source sentence length. Then, the NMT decodes from the context vector representation C and generates target translation Y = (y1, y2, ..., yn) one word each time by maximizing the probability of p(yj |y<j , C). Next, we briefly review the encoder introducing how to obtain C and the decoder addressing how to calculate p(yj |y<j , C).\nEncoder: The context vector representation C = (hl1, h l 2, ..., h l m) are generated by the encoder using l stacked LSTM layers. Bi-directional connections are used for the bottom encoder layer, and h1i is a concatenation of a left-to-right−→ h 1i and a right-to-left ←− h 1i ,\nh1i = [−→ h 1i←− h 1i ] = [ LSTM( −→ h 1i−1, xi) LSTM( ←− h 1i−1, xi) ] (1)\nAll other encoder layers are unidirectional, and hki is calculated as follows:\nhki = LSTM(h k i−1, h k−1 i ) (2)\nDecoder: The conditional probability p(yj |y<j , C) is formulated as\np(yj |Y<j , C) = p(yj |Y<j , cj) = softmax(Wstj) (3)\nSpecifically, we employ a simple concatenation layer to produce an attentional hidden state tj :\ntj = tanh(Wc[s l j ; cj ] + b) = tanh(W 1 c s l j +W 2 c cj + b) (4)\nwhere slj denotes the target hidden state at the top layer of a stacking LSTM. The attention model calculates cj as the weighted sum of the source-side context\n4 vector representation, just as illustrated in the upper left corner of Figure 2.\ncj = m∑ i=1 ATT (slj , h l i) · hli = m∑ i=1 αjih l i (5)\nwhere αji is a normalized item calculated as follows:\nαji = exp(hli · slj)∑ i′ exp(h l i′ · slj)\n(6)\nskj is computed by using the following formula:\nskj = LSTM(s k j−1, s k−1 j ) (7)\nIf k = 1, s1j will be calculated by combining tj−1 as feed input [16]:\ns1j = LSTM(s 1 j−1, yj−1, tj−1) (8)\nGiven the bilingual training data D = {(X(z), Y (z))}Zz=1, all parameters of the attention-based NMT are optimized to maximize the following conditional log-likelihood:\nL(θ) = 1\nZ Z∑ z=1 n∑ j=1 logp(y (z) j |y (z) <j , X (z), θ) (9)"

In this section, we will elaborate on three proposed approaches about integrating the look-ahead attention into the generation of attention-based NMT."

Moses-1 [11] is the state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system with the default configuration and a 4-gram language model trained on the target portion of training data. Moses2 is the same as Moses-1 except that the language model is trained using the target data plus 10M Xinhua portion of Gigaword corpus. The BLEU score of our NMT baseline, which is an attention-based NMT as introduced in Section 2, is about 4.5 higher than the state-of-the-art SMT system Moses-2.\nFor the last three lines in Table 1, Enc-Dec pattern outperforms concatenation pattern and even Dec-Enc pattern, which shows Enc-Dec pattern is best\n4 https://github.com/isi-nlp/Zoph RNN\n8 approach to take advantage of look-ahead attention. Moreover, our Enc-Dec pattern gets an improvement of +0.93 BLEU points over the state-of-the-art NMT baseline, which demonstrates that the look-ahead attention mechanism is effective for generation in conventional attention-based NMT.\nEffects of Translating Long Sentences A well-known flaw of NMT model is the inability to properly translate long sentences. One of the goals that we integrate the look-ahead attention into the generation of NMT decoder is boosting the performance in translating long sentence. We follow Bahdanau et al. [1] to group sentences of similar lengths together and compute a BLEU score per group, as demonstrated in Figure 4.\nAlthough the performance of both the NMT baseline and our proposed model drops rapidly when the length of source sentence increases, our Enc-Dec model is more effective than the NMT Baseline in handling long sentences. Specifically, our proposed model gets an improvement of 1.88 BLEU points over the baseline from 50 to 60 words in source language. Furthermore, when the length of input sentence is greater than 60, our model still outperforms the baseline by 1.04 BLEU points. Experiments show that the look-ahead attention can relieve the burden of LSTM to carry on the target-side long-distance dependencies.\nTarget Alignment of Look-ahead Attention The conventional attention models always refer to some source words when generating a target word. We propose a look-ahead attention for generation in NMT, which also focuses on previous generated words in order to predict the next target word.\nWe provide two real translation examples to show the target alignment of look-ahead attention in Figure 5. The first line is blank because it does not have look-ahead attention when generating the first word. Every line represents the weight distribution for previous generated words when predicting current target word. More specifically, we find some interesting phenomena. First, target words often refer to verb or predicate which has been generated previously, such as the word “was” in Figure 5(a).\nSecond, the heat map shows that the word “we” and the word “looking” have a stronger correlation when translating the Chinese sentence as demonstrated in Figure 5(b). Intuitively, the look-ahead attention mechanism establishes a bridge to capture the dependency relationship between target words. Third, most target words mainly focus on the word immediately before the current target word, which may be due to the fact that the last generated word contains more information in recurrent neural networks. We can control the influence of the look-ahead attention like Tu et al. [27] to improve translation quality and instead we remain it as our future work."

      "text" : "The recently proposed neural machine translation has drawn more and more attention. Most of the existing approaches and models mainly focus on designing better attention models [16,19,20,28,18], better strategies for handling rare and unknown words [17,14,24], exploiting large-scale monolingual data [3,23,33], and integrating SMT techniques [25,7,35,30].\nOur goal in this work is to design a smart attention mechanism to model the dependency relationship between target words. Tu et al. [28] and Mi et al. [19] proposed to extend attention models with a coverage vector in order to attack the problem of repeating and dropping translations. Cohn et al. [6] augmented the attention model with well-known features in traditional SMT. Unlike previous works that attention models are mainly designed to predict the alignment of a target word with respect to source words, we focus on establishing a direct bridge to capture the long-distance dependency relationship between target words. In addition, Wu et al. [31] lately proposed a sequence-to-dependency NMT method, in which the target word sequence and its corresponding dependency structure are jointly constructed and modeled. However, the target dependency tree references are needed for training in this model and our proposed model does not need extra resources.\nVery Recently, Vaswani et al. [29] proposed a new simple network architecture, Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms with multi-headed self attention. Besides, Lin et al. [15] presented a self-attention mechanism which extracts different aspects of the sentence into multiple vector representations. And the self-attention model has been used successfully in some tasks including abstractive summarization and reading comprehension[22,2]. Here, in order to alleviate the burden of LSTM to carry on the target-side long-distance dependencies of NMT, we propose to integrate the look-ahead attention mechanism\n11\ninto the conventional attention-based NMT which is used in conjunction with a recurrent network."

However, we find that the generation of a target word does not only depend on the source sentence, but also rely heavily on the previous generated target words, especially the distant words which are difficult to model by using recurrent neural networks. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a novel look-ahead attention mechanism for generation in NMT, which aims at directly capturing the dependency relationship between target words. We further design three patterns to integrate our look-ahead attention into the conventional attention model. Experiments on NIST Chinese-to-English and WMT English-to-German translation tasks show that our proposed look-ahead attention mechanism achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.",
