      "text" : "Deep convolutional networks have, in recent times, achieved near-human performance on an array of visual, auditory, and other cognitive tasks [1, 2]. The intriguing possibility of delivering deep learning applications on mobile devices, as well as providing energy-efficient cognitive solutions on the cloud have inspired an increasing number of researchers to search for low-precision state-of-the-art convolutional networks that can be deployed on extremely energy-efficient platforms [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].\nBinary convolutional networks that use binary convolutional kernels, and binary neuron activations are ideally suited to be run on low-power neuromorphic architectures that use spike-based communication [9]. In addition, storage and computational efficiency may be gained by using structured matrices in convolutional layers. Using structured matrices in the fully connected layers (also known as linear layers) of deep networks has been studied in the literature [10, 11, 12] with the objective of reducing the number of learned parameters. The main idea behind these approaches is to restrict the connectivity matrix of a (fully connected) layer to be from a known family of matrices, which are parametrised by a few variables and adapt the backpropagation to update those variables. On the other hand, reducing the memory and computation requirements of convolutional layers has been addressed by several approaches to model compression [13, 14, 15, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] – mostly after training.\nIn this work, we propose the use of structured matrices in convolutional layers that are inspired by low-power neuromorphic hardware architectures [9, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 21]. By connecting the efficient weight representation schema used in neuromorphic architectures [9, 21] with block Toeplitz matrices that arise in discrete convolution, we identify a family of convolution kernels that are\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n02 40\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.N E\nnaturally hardware efficient. The primary motivation behind our investigation is in the tradition of discovering algorithms that are native to a chosen architecture [27, 28, 29, 30] and thereby harvesting the best that a particular architecture offers.\nWe incorporate learning structured convolutional matrices into traditional stochastic gradient descent [31] so that the trained inference networks are hardware-ready. Furthermore, we exploit a known equivalence between stochastic bounded rectified linear units and deterministic threshold neurons and propose a novel approach to training networks with binary neuron activations. This procedure allows us to obtain accurate gradient estimates during backward step, and speed-up convergence of training and enriches the library of tools available to train low-precision deep neural networks. We evaluate our system on Cifar10 data set and compare against best energy vs accuracy numbers reported on currently available hardware [3] – our approach reduces the number of TrueNorth cores required to achieve 87.5% on Cifar10 from 31872 TrueNoth cores in [3] to 13216 cores.\nWe begin the next section by discussing binary convolutional networks and their suitability for neuromorphic hardware and introduce the weight representation mechanism used in TrueNorth architecture [9]. In Section 3, we discuss the structure of discrete convolution matrices and present our main result connecting that structure with the weight representation in TrueNorth – thereby identifying the family of structured convolution matrices that efficiently map to that architecture. Section 4 outlines our methodology for training networks to use only structured convolution kernels, and discusses how the connection between noisy ReLUs and binary neurons is exploited during training. We summarize our experimental results in Section 5 followed by concluding remarks in Section 6."

      "text" : "Binary convolutional networks [5, 3] are a particularly elegant instance of low-precision computing targeted toward object recognition tasks. Motivated by the possibility of deploying state-of-theart image recognition convolutional networks on low-power mobile devices, there has been an increasing interest around binary networks [32, 4, 5, 8, 6, 3]. Such networks use t´1, 1u-valued (or, t0, 1u) neurons throughout the network and thus best suited to be deployed on neuromorphic hardware using spiking neurons. Although we will restrict our focus to TrueNorth architecture in this study [9], most of our conclusions are also applicable to other platforms offering similar features [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 21].\nA TrueNorth chip consists of a network of neurosynaptic cores with programmable connectivity, synapses, and neuron parameters [9]. It is a multicore array where each core consists of 256 input lines, 256 neurons, and a 256ˆ 256 synaptic crossbar array. Each input line in a core can connect to one neuron on any core through a spike router, and that input line is accessible to all of the 256 neurons on that core through the crossbar, thereby resulting in block-wise connectivity. All communication to-, from-, and within- chip is performed using spikes. TrueNorth neurons use a variant of an integrateand-fire model with 23 configurable parameters [33] where a neuron’s state variable updates each tick (typically at 1000 ticks per second, though higher rates are possible). Synapses have individually configurable on/off states and have a strength assigned by look-up table. Specifically, each neuron has a 4-entry table of 8-bit signed-integers, each input line to a core is assigned an input-type of 1, 2, 3 or 4, and each synapse then determines its strength by using the input-type on its source side to index into the table of the neuron on its target side. In summary, for non-negative integers L,N ď 256, the crossbar weight matrix is factored into three components: a) a L ˆ N binary (t0, 1u-valued) connectivity matrix C, (b) an input-type vector g of length L over the integers t1, 2, 3, 4u, and (c) a set of strength-value functions sj : t1, 2, 3, 4u Ñ t´255, . . . , 255u, j “ 1, 2, . . . , N – one for each of the N neurons on a core. If we extend functions sj to operate on vectors element-wise, then the LˆN weight matrix M of a core can be written as\nMpg, C, tsiuNi“1q “ rs1pgq s2pgq ¨ ¨ ¨ sN pgqs ˝ C (1) where ˝ denotes the Hadamard product1 between matrices. To account for the fact that a TrueNorth neuron can connect to at most 256 input features, as in [3], network structure in this paper constrained by partitioning features in each layer into one or more\n1Which is simply the element-wise product between matrices\nequally sized groups. Neurons in a group connect to all the input features in that group, and output features from different groups are generated from disjoint set of input features2. The number of groups in a layer is chosen such that the total filter size (rows ˆ columns ˆ features) as well as the number of output features of each group is less than or equal to 256. To further promote sparsity in connections, we allow the convolutional filters to be t´1, 0, 1u-valued. The number of neurons that spike in response to an input image influence the energy utilization as well as the number of classification per unit time that the underlying hardware can support. With this in mind, we strive to train networks with sparse binary activations. All the networks studied in this work use t0, 1u-valued neurons where average fraction of 1’s is less than 20%. All of the above considerations result in networks that are sparse in connectivity, weights, and activations."

      "text" : "When discrete convolution is written as a matrix multiplication, the resulting ‘convolution matrix’ has a block Toeplitz structure3 [34]. By establishing the connection between the weight representation in (1) and Toeplitz matrices, we identify a set of convolution kernels (symmetric kernels 4) that efficiently map to the TrueNorth architecture. We need a few more notations before giving a formal statement of this connection.\nFor an arbitrary matrix H , we denote its i-th column by Hi and its pi, jq-th element by Hi,j . If h is an arbitrary scalar-valued function on real numbers, we extend it to operate on matrices by applying it element-wise. For two functions h1 and h2, h1 ¨ h2 denotes function composition. Let X ˇ K denote the 2-D convolution5 between an nˆ n data matrix X and an l ˆ l convolution kernel matrix K.

Such an n2ˆnpn´ l` 1q matrix W will be referred to as the block Toeplitz convolution matrix for K, and we write W pKq to make its dependence on K explicit. The sparsity and circulant nature of convolution matrices are fully exploited in most approaches to accelerate training and inference [35, 36, 37].\nSuppose that the dimension of the data matrix X is such that n2 ď 256. Ideally, for every choice of kernel K the corresponding convolution matrix W pKq can be represented in the form of (1) for some choice of type vector g, a set of strength functions, and a binary connectivity matrix C. However, the representation in (1) requires the input-type vector g to be common to all the columns of the weight\n2This is in contrast to typical convolutional network layer whose output features depend on the entire set of input features.\n3We allow the Toeplitz matrices to be non-square. 4The name symmetric kernels is motivated by the fact that these kernels are generated using commutative members of the Symmetric group S4–the group of all permutations on a set of four elements. 5For notational simplicity, we ignore the boundary effects and assume n ě 2l and convolution stride of 1 throughout this section. The results presented here can be generalized to other cases.\nmatrix. Hence, it is conceivable that not every block Toeplitz convolution matrix W pKq can be represented in that form. Figure 1 provides a visual summary of the main result of this section: There\nis an one-to-one relationship between the set of convolution kernels and the set of block Toeplitz matrices of the form in (3). Theorem 3.1 asserts that only the set of block Toeplitz matrices associated with symmetric kernels characterized by the theorem can be represented by (1). The characterization also suggests a constructive procedure to generate all symmetric kernels. The proof of the theorem is outlined in the appendix. Example 3, also included in the appendix, explains the problem of relating the weight representation in (1) and convolution matrices in more detail.\nTheorem 3.1. Let n and l be non-negative integers such that L “ n2 ď 256, N “ n ´ l ` 1 ď 256 and let K be an l ˆ l kernel matrix.

In our case, we want the kernels to be from the class of symmetric kernels that efficiently map to TrueNorth architecture. Our strategy is as follows: At first, we allow every kernel K in the network to be learned without any constraints. Next, because our goal is to generate a trained network that maps to TrueNorth, once the performance on the validation data saturates, the unconstrained real-valued kernel K is replaced by a suitable member of the symmetric kernels as described below.

Our approach seeks to use a binary activations obtained by threshold functions because they map to neuromorphic harware with spike-based communication infrastruture efficiently. Our strategy is to begin the training with ReLU activations and to make them increasingly noisy so that they can be replaced with binary activations in the end. Using stochastic neuron activation functions has been explored in the literature for various purposes [41, 42, 43, 44]. An early attempt at using noisy ReLU with the objective of obtaining binary activations was reported in [45] for single-layer networks.\nIt is well-known in information theory [46, 47] that the best way to communicate using an amplitudebounded channel in the presence of additive noise of the form shown in Figure 2 is to use a discrete set of input values for x, and that for an appropriate choice of noise variance, binary signaling is optimal. Moreover, unlike in information theory where the noise distribution and variance are presupposed, we have the freedom to choose and vary them throughout the training period. We seek to utilize this connection to train a binary convolutional network using noisy ReLUs.\nDuring training, we use the bounded noisy ReLU shown in Figure 2 (a) with a zero mean uniform distributed random variable distributed in the range r´ , s as the noise source. The range of the random variable is slowly increased from 0 to T {2. Towards the end of the training period, noisy ReLUs are replaced by the threshold neuron shown in Figure 2 (b) one layer at a time for fine tuning the network.

Naturally, the input vector vecpXq is routed to 16 of the input lines of a TrueNorth core in the order shown in (14), and the two matrices on either side of the Hadamard product in (14) are implemented using the crossbar by selecting 1q an appropriate binary connectivity matrix C, 2q a set of four strength functions s1, s2, s3, and s4, and 3q a 4ˆ 4 matrix G such that Gi,j defines the input-type for Xi,j so\nthat by defining g “ vecpGq we can get\nrs1pgq s2pgq s3pgq s4pgqs ˝ C “\n¨\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˝\nK1,1 0 0 0 K2,1 K1,1 0 0 K3,1 K2,1 0 0 0 K3,1 0 0 K1,2 0 K1,1 0 K2,2 K1,2 K2,1 K1,1 K3,2 K2,2 K3,1 K2,1 0 K3,2 0 K3,1 K1,3 0 K1,2 0 K2,3 K1,3 K2,2 K1,2 K3,3 K2,3 K3,2 K2,2 0 K3,3 0 K3,2 0 0 K1,3 0 0 0 K2,3 K1,3 0 0 K3,3 K2,3 0 0 0 K3,3\n˛\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‚\n˝\n»\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n– 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1\nfi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nffi\nfl\n(15)\nwhich is sufficient to be able to compute the aforementioned convolution.\nThe obvious choice for C is the binary matrix on the RHS of (15), and the remainder of the discussion focuses on the choice of the type vector and strength functions. Since the strength function is common to all the rows of a particular column, two rows with distinct non-zero entries in a column must be assigned distinct types. To illustrate this further, let us consider the following kernel\nK “ ˜´1 2 ´1 ´2 4 ´2 ´1 2 ´1 ¸ .\nNow let us rewrite the matrix on the RHS of (15) for this example and color the rows of the resulting matrix such that any two rows of the first column with distinct non-zero elements have different colors:\n¨\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˝\nK1,1 0 0 0 K2,1 K1,1 0 0 K3,1 K2,1 0 0 0 K3,1 0 0 K1,2 0 K1,1 0 K2,2 K1,2 K2,1 K1,1 K3,2 K2,2 K3,1 K2,1 0 K3,2 0 K3,1 K1,3 0 K1,2 0 K2,3 K1,3 K2,2 K1,2 K3,3 K2,3 K3,2 K2,2 0 K3,3 0 K3,2 0 0 K1,3 0 0 0 K2,3 K1,3 0 0 K3,3 K2,3 0 0 0 K3,3\n˛\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‚\n“\n¨\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˝ ´1 0 0 0 ´2 ´1 0 0 ´1 ´2 0 0 0 ´1 0 0 2 0 ´1 0 4 2 ´2 ´1 2 4 ´1 ´2 0 2 0 ´1 ´1 0 2 0 ´2 ´1 4 2 ´1 ´2 2 4 0 ´1 0 2 0 0 ´1 0 0 0 ´2 ´1 0 0 ´1 ´2 0 0 0 ´1\n˛\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‚\nThe rows where the first column is 0 are free to choose a color based on subsequent columns so they remain uncolored for now. However, even though the colors so far have been chosen considering only the first column, it is important that no two rows of a subsequent column get the same color but contain distinct non-zero entries. In that case, the coloring scheme is said to be in ‘conflict’, and a conflictfree coloring scheme may not exist. Notice that the current row coloring does not contain any such conflicts so we can proceed with the remaining columns one at a time (starting position of the rowcolor indicates which column was under consideration while a row was assigned a particular color):\n¨ ˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˝ ´1 0 0 0 ´2 ´1 0 0 ´1 ´2 0 0 0 ´1 0 0 2 0 ´1 0 4 2 ´2 ´1 2 4 ´1 ´2 0 2 0 ´1 ´1 0 2 0 ´2 ´1 4 2 ´1 ´2 2 4 0 ´1 0 2 0 0 ´1 0 0 0 ´2 ´1 0 0 ´1 ´2 0 0 0 ´1\n˛\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‚\nùñ g “\n¨\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˝ 1 2 1 2 3 4 3 4 1 2 1 2 3 4 3 4\n˛\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‚ p1, 1q p2, 1q p3, 1q p4, 1q p1, 2q p2, 2q p3, 2q p4, 2q p1, 3q p2, 3q p3, 3q p4, 3q p1, 4q p2, 4q p3, 4q p4, 4q\n,\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / .\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / -\npi, jq location of the input incident ÐÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝÝ on the corresponding row as in (14)\n¨\n˚\n˝ ´1 2 ´1 0 ´2 4 ´2 0 ´1 2 ´1 0 0 0 0 0 ˛ ‹ ‚ ¨ ˚ ˝ 0 0 0 0 ´1 2 ´1 0 ´2 4 ´2 0 ´1 2 ´1 0 ˛ ‹ ‚ ¨ ˚ ˝ 0 ´1 2 ´1 0 ´2 4 ´2 0 ´1 2 ´1 0 0 0 0 ˛ ‹ ‚ ¨ ˚ ˝ 0 0 0 0 0 ´1 2 ´1 0 ´2 4 ´2 0 ´1 2 ´1 ˛ ‹ ‚\ns1p1q : ´1 s1p2q : ´2 s1p3q : 2 s1p4q : 4\ns2p1q : ´2 s2p2q : ´1 s2p3q : 4 s2p4q : 2\ns3p1q : 2 s3p2q : 4 s3p3q : ´1 s3p4q : ´2\ns4p1q : 4 s4p2q : 2 s4p3q : ´2 s4p4q : ´1\nwhere the type-vector g simply indicates the color index of the corresponding row (green – 1, red – 2, blue – 3, yellow – 4). The above coloring scheme represents a valid coloring solution that is conflict-free. For i “ 1, 2, 3, 4, the strength function si is defined by letting sipcq to be the unique non-zero value associated with color index c in column i and we have a solution that satisfies (15).\nIn general, suppose that the kernel K satisfies Ki,j “ fpσi´11 pσ j´1 2 pρqqq for some function f , ρ P t1, 2, 3, 4u, and two commuting permutations σ1 and σ2 on t1, 2, 3, 4u. We will now illustrate the idea behind why the above coloring procedure will never run into conflicts for such a K. For simplicity, assume that the function f is invertible. Since such a K has exactly four distinct entries, rows of the matrix whose first column contains a non-zero entry can be colored with four distinct colors without any conflict in that column. Assume that after such a coloring based on just the non-zero entries of the first column, two rows have been already assigned the same color as shown below:\n¨\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˚\n˝\nK1,1 0 0 0 K2,1 K1,1 0 0 K3,1 K2,1 0 0 0 K3,1 0 0 K1,2 0 K1,1 0 K2,2 K1,2 K2,1 K1,1 K3,2 K2,2 K3,1 K2,1 0 K3,2 0 K3,1 K1,3 0 K1,2 0 K2,3 K1,3 K2,2 K1,2 K3,3 K2,3 K3,2 K2,2 0 K3,3 0 K3,2 0 0 K1,3 0 0 0 K2,3 K1,3 0 0 K3,3 K2,3 0 0 0 K3,3\n˛\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‹\n‚\nThe two rows with the same color imply\nK2,2 “ K3,3 ùñ fpσ1pσ2pρqqq “ fpσ21pσ22pρqqq ùñ σ1pσ2pρqq “ σ21pσ22pρqq\nùñ ρ “ σ1pσ2pρqq. Now let us use the last equality to show that this coloring choice does not lead to a conflict in any of the three remaining columns:\nK2,3 “ σ1pσ22pρqq “ σ2pσ1pσ2pρqqq “ σ2pρq “ K1,2 K3,2 “ σ21pσ2pρqq “ σ1pσ1pσ2pρqqq “ σ1pρq “ K2,1 K2,2 “ σ1pσ2pρqq “ ρ “ K1,1\nwhich is precisely what we needed. Similar analysis can be used to show that all the rows can be colored without conflicts for such a matrix K. In fact, by defining the 4 ˆ 4 matrix G by Gi,j “ σi´11 pσ j´1 2 pρqq and letting g “ vecpGq, we can use g to obtain a conflict-free coloring solution!\nOutline of the proof of Theorem 3.1. Extending the arguments in Remark 1 in a straightforward manner proves the first part of the theorem. We will now outline the proof for the second half the theorem assuming n “ 16, l “ 3 and the proof for general case is a straightforward extension of arguments here. Assume that K contains at least four distinct non-zero entries as in the statement of the theorem. Suppose that there exist some g, C, and tsiuNi“1 such that Mpg, C, tsiuNi“1q “W pKq, we will now construct f , ρ, σ1 , and σ2 such that\nKi,j “ fpσi´11 pσ j´1 2 pρqqq.\nLet k, l P t1, 2, . . . , 14u, and r “ pl ´ 1q ¨ 14 ` k. Let X denote the 16 ˆ 16 input matrix. As in Remark 1, the pk, lq-th convolution result is computed using the r-th column of Mpg, C, tsiuNi“1q by\nvecpXqtMpg, C, tsiuNi“1qr “ vecpXqt psrpgq ˝ Crq . (16) Recall that the range of sr cannot contain zero (since its range must contain all unique entries of K – of which there are four non-zero elements), consequently srpgq cannot not contain any zero entries. The pk, lq-th convolution only depends on tXi,j : k ď i ď pk ` 2q, l ď j ď pl ` 2qu. Furthermore, since the theorem statement also requires that K does not contain zeros, the pk, lq-th convolution depends on all of tXi,j : k ď i ď pk ` 2q, l ď j ď pl ` 2qu non-trivially. Hence, if H denotes the 16ˆ 16 matrix constructed such that Cr “ vecpHq), then H must satisfy\nHi,j “ \" 1 if k ď i ď pk ` 2q and l ď j ď pl ` 2q 0 otherwise\n(17)\nwhich is merely stating that the binary vector Cr masks out all the rows on which the pk, lq-th convolution does not depend on. Now let G denote the 16ˆ 16 matrix obtained by reshaping g so that the input-type of Xi,j is Gi,j (i.e, g “ vecpGq).
