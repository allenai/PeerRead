      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Words are in general ambiguous and can have several related or unrelated meanings depending on context. For instance, the word rock can refer to both a stone and a music genre, but in the sentence ”Without the guitar, there would be no rock music” the sense is no longer ambiguous. From this example it is easy to see that the context surrounding the word is what defines the sense. However, it may not be so obvious that this is a difficult task. To see this, consider instead the sentence ”Hard rock crushes heavy metal” where all words in themselves seems to indicate stone but together they actually define the word token as music. Hence, to do word sense disambiguation (WSD) well we need to go beyond bag of words and into the territory of sequence modeling.\nImproved WSD would be beneficial to many of the big natural language processing (NLP) problems, e.g. machine translation, information Retrieval, information Extraction (Vickrey et al., 2005; Navigli, 2009), and basic NLP tasks like sense aware word representations (Neelakantan et al., 2015;\nNieto Piña and Johansson, 2015; Bovi et al., 2015). However, for word representations the benefit goes two ways which was shown by Taghipour and Ng (2015) who used word embeddings to improve on WSD, and later by Johansson and Pina (2015) who combined word embeddings with a knowledge graph approach. Though much progress has been done in the area, most current WSD systems suffer one of two problems. They either disregard the order of words or they rely on complicated hand crafted features. The first problem will lead to systems with low precision since many different contexts, potentially corresponding to different senses, will consist of the same bag of words. The second problem usually lead to high precision but will inevitable lack in coverage and therefore produce a low recall system. We aim to mitigate these problems by (1) modeling the sequence of words surrounding the target word instead of a bag, and (2) refrain from using any hand crafted features but let the model learn the features directly from the text during training.\nThe main contributions of this work include:\n• An end–to–end trainable WSD system that achieves state-of-the-art result on two standard datasets without any hand crafted features.\n• A novel regularization method for word sequences, dropword.\n• Empirical evidence that highlights the importance of word order for WSD."

      "text" : "When training powerful nonlinear classifiers like neural networks, good regularization is essential for generalization. One of the most basic regularization techniques is to add Gaussian noise to the inputs (Sietsma and Dow, 1991). This can be viewed as a type of data augmentation, i.e. distorting the training data to create slightly different examples for each pass through the data, making it harder for the model to simply memorize the training set. Another, more recent noise based regularization technique is dropout, introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014). Dropout lowers the capacity of the model by randomly erasing information from a layer of neurons by setting a subset of them to zero. This forces the network to learn independent sub networks which improves the generalization in a similar way as to train many separate models and combining the results."

      "text" : "Besides the regularization techniques described in Section 2.4 we present a novel regularizer referred to as dropword. The idea behind dropword is similar to that of dropout but instead of randomly removing a part of the activations, we randomly replace some words in the context with a <dropped> tag. The tag is treated just like any other word in the vocabulary and has a corresponding word embedding that is trained. This process is repeated over time, so that the words dropped change with time. The motivation for doing dropword is to decrease the dependency on individual words in the training context. This technique can be generalized to other kinds of sequential inputs, not only words."

The architecture of the model, depicted in Figure 1, consist of a softmax layer, a hidden layer, and a BLSTM. See Section 2.2 for more details regarding the BLSTM. The BLSTM and the hidden layer share parameters over all word types and senses, while the softmax is parameterized by word type and selects the corresponding weight matrix and bias vector for each word type respectively. This structure enables the model to share statistical strength\nacross different word types while remaining computationally efficient even for a large total number of senses."

(2)\nHere, v(wn) is the one-hot representation of the word type corresponding to wn ∈ D. This will have the effect of picking the column from W x corresponding to that word type. The resulting vector is referred to as word embedding. Further, W x can be initialized using pre-trained word embeddings, to leverage large unannotated datasets. In this work GloVe vectors were used for this purpose.\nThe model output, y(n), is a predicted sense distribution for a word at position n, and is computed via the hidden layer a as\na = W ha[hn−1;hn+1] + b ha (3) y(n) = softmax(W aywna+ b ay wn), (4)\nwhere [hn−1;hn+1] is the concatenated outputs of the right and left traversing LSTMs of the BLSTM at word n, see Equation (1). W ha and bha are the weights and biases for the hidden layer, and W aywn and baywn are the weights and biases for the softmax layer corresponding to the word at position n. Hence, each word type will have its own softmax parameters, with dimensions depending on the number of senses of that particular word type. The softmax is the multidimensional generalization of the logistic function defined as\nsoftmaxj(z(n)) = exp(zj(n))\n∑|S(wn)| k=1 exp(zk(n)) ,\nwhere z(n) = W aywna+ b ay wn , and S(wn) is the set of senses corresponding to the word type of wn."

To speed up training, we use a maximum context window length of 140 words. Allowing the model to use more distant data than this did not improve the results.

All parameters in the model are initialized in U(−0.1, 0.1), with the exception of the biases that are initialized to zero. The data is cleaned by removing various tags. We do not remove uncommon words, but to keep the size of the vocabulary manageable we replaced numbers with a < number > tag. Words not in GloVe is initialized from N (0, 0.1). This resulted in a vocabulary size of |V | = 50817 for SE2 and |V | = 37998 for SE3. Words not present in the training set is considered as unknown words during test."

(2001) and achieved the best score on the English lexical sample task of SE2 with a F1 score of 64.2. Their system utilized a rich feature space based on raw words, lemmas, POS tags, bag-of-words, bi-gram, and tri-gram collocations, etc. as inputs to an ensemble classifier. Correspondingly, htsa3 by Grozea (2004) was the winner of the SE3 lexical sample task with a F1 score of 72.9. This system also used a rich set of features. These were used as inputs to a regularized least square classifier. IMS+adapted CW is a more recent system by Taghipour and Ng (2015) that introduces word embeddings in WSD, albeit separately trained, as a feature together with, again, a rich set of features including POS tags, collocations and surrounding words. A support vector machine is subsequently trained on the extracted features for each target word.\nOur proposed model outperform previous stateof-the-art on SE2 and are tied with IMS+adapted CW on SE3. Moreover, we see that dropword consistently improves the results on both SE2 and SE3. Randomizing the order of the input words yields a substantially worse result, which provides evidence for our hypothesis that the order of the words are significant. We also see that the system effectively makes use of the information in the pre-trained word embeddings and that they are essential to the performance of our system on these\ndatasets."

The model stands in stark contrast to previous work in that it is an end-to-end trainable system, all the way from the text to the sense prediction. Further, we showed that employing pre trained word vectors improved the generalization power of the model. However, it is likely that this effect would diminish if the model was trained on more sense tagged data, which is an experiment we hope to conduct as future work. Also, in part due to the limited amount of data, we developed the regularization technique dropword that we could show improved the results under these constrained circumstances. Another effect that stemmed from the limited data is that we needed to scale down and regularize the model heavily. Therefore we hold it as likely that it is possible to improve on the reported results simply by scaling up the model and training on more data."
