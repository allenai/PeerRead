Recently, convolutional and recurrent neural networks has provided very effective mechanisms to capture the hidden structures within sentences via continuous representations, thereby significantly advancing the performance of relation extraction. The advantage of convolutional neural networks is their capacity to generalize the consecutive kgrams in the sentences while recurrent neural networks are effective to encode long ranges of sentence context. This paper proposes to combine the traditional feature-based method, the convolutional and recurrent neural networks to simultaneously benefit from their advantages. Our systematic evaluation of different network architectures and combination methods demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach and results in the state-of-the-art performance on the ACE 2005 and SemEval dataset."

      "text" : "We studies the relation extraction (RE) problem, one of the important problem of information extraction and natural language processing (NLP). Given two entity mentions in a sentence (relation mentions), we need to identify the semantic relationship (if any) between the two entity mentions. One example is the recognition of the Located relation between “He” and “Texas” in the sentence “He lives in Texas”.\nThe two methods dominating RE research in the last decade are the feature-based method (Kambhatla, 2004; Boschee et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2005; Grishman et al., 2005; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Chan and Roth, 2010; Sun et al., 2011) and the kernel-based method (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005a; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b; Zhang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2009; Plank and Moschitti, 2013). These research extensively studies the leverage of linguistic analysis and knowledge resources to construct the feature representations, involving the combination of discrete properties such as lexicon, syntax, gazetteers. Although these approaches are able to exploit the symbolic (discrete) structures within relation mentions, they also suffer from the difficulty to generalize over the unseen words (Gormley et al., 2015), motivating some very recent work on employing the continuous representations of words (word embeddings) to do RE. The most popular method involves neural networks (NNs) that effectively learn hidden structures of relation mentions from such word embeddings, thus achieving the top performance for RE (Zeng et al., 2014; dos Santos et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015).\nThe NN research for relation extraction and classification has centered around two main network architectures: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (dos Santos et al., 2015; Zeng et al., 2015) and recursive/recurrent neural networks (Socher et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2015). The distinction between convolutional neural networks\nand recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for RE is that the former aim to generalize the local and consecutive context (i.e, the k-grams) of the relation mentions (Nguyen and Grishman, 2015a) while the latter adaptively accumulate the context information in the whole sentence via the memory units, thereby encoding the global and possibly unconsecutive patterns for RE (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014). Consequently, the traditional feature-based method (i.e, the log-linear or MaxEnt model with hand-crafted features), the CNNs and the RNNs tend to focus on different angles for RE. Guided from this intuition, in this work, we propose to combine the three models to further improve the performance of RE.\nWhile the architecture design of CNNs for RE is quite established due to the extensive studies in the last couple of years, the application of RNNs to RE is only very recent and the optimal designs of RNNs for RE are still an ongoing research. In this work, we first perform a systematic exploration of various network architectures to seek the best RNN model for RE. In the next step, we extensively study different methods to assemble the log-linear model, CNNs and RNNs for RE, leading to the combined models that yield the state-of-the-art performance on the ACE 2005 and SemEval dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically examine the RNN architectures as well as combine them with CNNs and the traditional feature-based approach for RE."

      "text" : "Relation mentions consist of sentences marked with two entity mentions of interest. In this paper, we examine two different representations for the sentences in RE: (i) the standard representation, called SEQ that takes all the words in the sentences into account and (ii) the dependency representation, called DEP that only considers the words along the dependency paths between the two entity mention heads of the sentences. In the following, unless indicated specifically, all the statements about the sentences hold for both representations SEQ and DEP.\nThroughout this paper, for convenience, we assume that the input sentences of the relation mentions have the same fixed length n. This can be\nachieved by setting n to the length of the longest input sentences and padding the shorter sentences with a special token. Let W = w1w2 . . . wn be the input sentence of some relation mention, where wi is the i-th word in the sentence. Also, let wi1 and wi2 be the two heads of the two entity mentions of interest. In order to prepare the relation mention for neural networks, we first transform each word wi into a real-valued vector xi using the concatenation of the following seven vectors, motivated by the previous research on neural networks and feature analysis for RE (Zhou et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2011; Gormley et al., 2015).\n- The real-valued word embedding vector ei of wi, obtained by looking up the word embedding table E.\n- The real-valued distance embedding vectors di1 , di2 to encode the relative distances i − i1 and i − i2 of wi to the two entity heads of interest wi1 and wi2 : di1 = D[i − i1], di2 = D[i − i2] where D is the distance embedding table (initialized randomly). The objective is to inform the networks the positions of the two entity mentions for relation prediction.\n- The real-valued embedding vectors for entity types ti and chunks qi to embed the entity type and chunking information for wi. These vectors are generated by looking up the entity type and chunk embedding tables (also initialized randomly) (i.e, T and Q respectively) for the entity type enti and chunking label chunki of wi: ti = T [enti], qi = Q[chunki].\n- The binary vector pi with one dimension to indicate whether the word wi is on the dependency path between wi1 and wi2 or not.\n- The binary vector gi whose dimensions correspond to the possible relations between words in the dependency trees. The value at a dimension of gi is only set to 1 if there exists one edge of the corresponding relation connected to wi in the dependency tree.\nThe transformation from the word wi to the vector xi = [ei, di1 , di2 , ti, qi, pi, gi] essentially converts the relation mention with the input sentence W into a real-valued matrix X = [x1, x2, . . . , xn], to be used by the neural networks presented below."

Each feature map f is a weight matrix f = [f1, f2, . . . , fk] where fi is a vector to be learnt during training as the model parameters. The core of CNNs is the application of the convolutional operator on the input matrix X and the filter matrix f to produce a score sequence sf = [sf1, s f 2, . . . , s f\nn−k+1], interpreted as a more abstract representation of the input matrix X:\nsfi = g(\nk−1∑\nj=0\nfj+1xj+i + b)\nwhere b is a bias term and g is the tanh function. In the next step, we further abstract the scores in sf by aggregating it via the max function to obtain the max-pooling score sfmax. We then repeat this process for all the ck feature maps with different window sizes k to generate a vector of the maxpooling scores. In the final step, we pass this vector into some standard multilayer neural network, followed by a softmax layer to produce the probabilistic distribution pC(y|X) over the possible relation classes y in the prediction task."

At each step i, we compute the hidden vector hi from the current input vector xi and the previous hidden vector hi−1 using the non-linear transformation function Φ: hi = Φ(xi, hi−1).\nThis recurrent computation can be done via three different directional mechanisms: (i) the forward mechanism that recurs from 1 to n and generate the forward hidden vector sequence: R(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = h1, h2, . . . , hn, (ii) the backward mechanism that runs RNNs from n to 1 and results in the backward hidden vector sequence R(xn, xn−1, . . . , x1) = h ′ n, h ′ n−1, . . . , h ′ 1 1, and (iii) the bidirectional mechanism that performs RNNs in both directions to produce the forward and backward hidden vector sequences, and then concatenate them at each position to generate the new hidden vector sequence hb1, h b 2, . . . , h b n: h b i = [hi, h ′\ni]. 1The initial hidden vectors are set to the zero vector.\nGiven the hidden vector sequence h1, h2, . . . , hn obtained from one of the three mechanisms above, we study two following strategies to generate the representation vector vR for the initial relation mention. Note that this representation vector can be again fed into some standard multilayer neural network with a softmax layer in the end, resulting in the distribution pR(y|X) for the RNN models:\n- The HEAD strategy: In this strategy, vR is the concatenation of the hidden vectors at the positions of the two entity mention heads of interest: vR = [hi1 , hi2 ]. This is motivated by the importance of the two mention heads in RE (Sun et al., 2011; Nguyen and Grishman, 2014).\n- The MAX strategy: This strategy is similar to our max-pooling mechanism in CNNs. In particular, vR is obtained by taking the maximum along each dimension of the hidden vectors h1, h2, . . . , hn. The idea is to further abstract the hidden vectors by retaining only the most important feature in each dimension.\nRegarding the non-linear function, the simplest form of Φ in the literature considers it as a one-layer feed-forward neural network, called FF : hi = FF (xi, hi−1) = φ(Uxi + V hi−1) where φ is the sigmoid function. Unfortunately, the application of FF causes the socalled “vanishing/exploding gradient” problems (Bengio et al., 1994), making it challenging to train RNNs properly (Pascanu et al., 2012). These problems are overcome by the long-short term memory units (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Graves et al., 2009). In this work, we apply a variant of the memory units: the Gated Recurrent Units from Cho et al. (2014), called GRU . GRU is shown to be much simpler than LSTM in terms of computation but still achieves the comparable performance (Cho et al., 2014)."

The expectation is that we can learn more effective features for RE via such a deeper architecture by alternating between the local and global representations provided by CNNs and RNNs.\nWe examine two variants for this method. The first variant, called RNN-CNN, applies the CNN model in Section 2.1.1 on the hidden vector sequence generated by some RNN in Section 2.1.2 to perform RE. The second variant, called CNN-RNN, on the other hand, utilize the CNN model to acquire the hidden vector sequence, that is, in turn, fed as the input into some RNN for RE. For the second variant, as the length of the hidden vector s f = [sf1, s f 2, . . . , s f\nn−k+1] in the CNN model depends on the specified window size k for the feature map f , we need to pad the input matrix X with ⌊k\n2 ⌋ zero column vectors on both sides to en-\nsure the same fixed length n for all the hidden vectors: sf = [sf1, s f 2, . . . , s f n]. Besides, we need to rearrange the scores in the hidden vectors from different feature maps of the CNN so they are grouped according to the positions in the sentence, thus being compatible with the input requirement of RNNs."

If there are more than one relation classes receiving the highest number of votes, the relation class returned by a model and having the highest probability would be chosen."

Specifically, in such integration models (called the hybrid models), the relation class distribution is obtained from the element-wise multiplication between the distributions of the neural network models and the log-linear model. Let us take the ensembling model in Section 2.2.1 as an example. The corresponding hybrid model in this case would be: phybrid(y|X) = 1\nZ pC(y|X)pR(y|X)plogin(y|X), as-\nsuming plogin(y|X) be the distribution of the loglinear model and Z be the normalization constant. The parameters of the log-linear model are learnt jointly with the parameters of the neural networks.\nHypothesis: Let S be the set of relation mentions correctly predicted by some neural network model in some dataset (the coverage set). The introduction of the log-linear model into this neural network model essentially changes the coverage set of the network, resulting in the new coverage set S′ that might or might not subsume the original set S. In this work, we hypothesize that although S and S′ overlap, there are still some relation mentions that only belong to either set. Consequently, we propose to implement a majority voting system (called the hybrid-voting system) on the outputs of the network and its corresponding hybrid model to enhance both models.\nNote that the voting models in Section 2.2.3 involve the voting on two models (i.e, CNN and RNN). In order to integrate the log-linear model into such voting models, we first augment the separate CNN and RNN models with the log-linear model before we perform the voting procedure on the resulting models. Finally, the corresponding hybridvoting systems would involve the voting on four models (CNN, hybrid CNN, RNN and hybrid RNN)."

Following the common practice of domain adaptation research on this dataset (Plank and Moschitti, 2013; Nguyen and Grishman, 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015c; Gormley et al., 2015), we use news (the union of bn and nw) as the training data, a half of bc as the development set and the remainder (cts, wl and the other half of bc) as the test data.

In order to make it compatible with the previous research (Socher et al., 2012; Gormley et al., 2015), for this dataset, besides the word embeddings and the distance embeddings, we apply the name tagging, part of speech tagging and WordNet features (inherited from Socher et al.

In particular, the BIDIRECT has much better recall for the PHYS relation while the recalls of CNN are significantly better for the ART, ORG-AFF and GEN-AFF relations. A closer investigation reveals two facts: (i) the PHYS relation mentions that are only correctly predicted by BIDIRECT involve the long distances between two entity mentions, such as the PHYS relation between “Some” (a person entity) and “desert” (a location entity) in the following sentence: “Some of the 40,000 British troops are kicking up a lot of dust in the Iraqi desert making sure that nothing is left behind them that could hurt them.”, and (ii) the ART, ORGAFF, GEN-AFF relation mentions only correctly predicted by CNN contains the patterns between the two entity mentions that are short but meaningful enough to decide the relation classes, such as “The Iraqi unit in possession of those guns” (the ART relation between “unit” and “guns”), or “the al Qaeda chief operations officer” (the ORG-AFF relation between “al Qaeda” and “officer”). The failure of CNN on the PHYS relation mentions with long distances originates from its mechanism to model short and consecutive k-grams (up to length 5 in our case), causing the difficulty to capture the long and/or unconsecutive patterns. BIDIRECT, on the other hand, fails to predict the short (but expressive enough) patterns for ART, ORG-AFF, GEN-AFF because it involves the hidden vectors that only model the context words outside the short patterns, potentially introducing unnecessary and noisy information into the max-pooling scores for prediction.

Recently, convolutional and recurrent neural networks has provided very effective mechanisms to capture the hidden structures within sentences via continuous representations, thereby significantly advancing the performance of relation extraction. The advantage of convolutional neural networks is their capacity to generalize the consecutive kgrams in the sentences while recurrent neural networks are effective to encode long ranges of sentence context. This paper proposes to combine the traditional feature-based method, the convolutional and recurrent neural networks to simultaneously benefit from their advantages. Our systematic evaluation of different network architectures and combination methods demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach and results in the state-of-the-art performance on the ACE 2005 and SemEval dataset.",
