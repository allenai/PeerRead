      "text" : "Linear-time computational techniques have been developed for combining evidence which is available on a number of contending hypotheses. They offer a means of making the computation-intensive calculations involved more efficient in certain circumstances. Unfortunately, they restrict the orthogonal sum of evidential functions to the dichotomous structure − applies only to elements and their complements. In this paper, we present a novel evidence structure in terms of a triplet and a set of algorithms for evidential reasoning. The merit of this structure is that it divides a set of evidence into three subsets, distinguishing trivial evidential elements from important ones − focusing some particular elements. It avoids the deficits of the dichotomous structure in representing the preference of evidence and estimating the basic probability assignment of evidence. We have established a formalism for this structure and the general formulae for combining pieces of evidence in the form of the triplet, which have been theoretically and empirically justified."

      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a novel evidence structure − a triplet − which can be used to represent multiple pieces of evidence to improve effectiveness and efficiency in computing Dempster’s rule of combination and in making decisions. In particular, it is designed to represent the outputs of ensemble classifiers and it is capable of incorporating the prioritized outputs − evidence − into the decision making process, resulting in an improvement of classification accuracy. We have developed a formalism for the triplet structure, and we show that the mass functions defined on\nthis formalism satisfy the properties embedded in the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (Shafer 1976). We also developed a range of formulae for realizing linear time computations of combining various triplet mass functions, which are applicable to the other evidential functions of belief function, commonality function, plausibility function, and doubt function.\nThe evidential functions are defined on sets and their enumeration. Broadly speaking, the time complexity of computing evidential functions is exponential. Essentially, it is not feasible to translate the evidence theory into an efficient direct implementation (Barnett 1981). Therefore the applications of the DempsterShafer theory of evidence to real-world problems have been until recently limited (Denoeux 2000), in particular, to text categorization. Considerable efforts have been devoted to developing efficient algorithms for computing evidential functions (Barnett 1981; Shafer, et al. 1987; Kennes, et al. 1990; Moral, et al. 1994; Guan, et al. 1995; Shafer, et al. 2002). However, a particular structure embedded in evidence plays a dominant role in developing practical and linear algorithms for computing evidential functions and for realworld applications (Xu, et al. 1992; Denoeux 2000). For example, Barnett (1981) proposed a method for partitioning an evidence space in several independent ways and clustering pieces of evidence into the dichotomous partitions of a singleton proposition and its negation. Based on the dichotomous structure, a range of formulae were developed for computing various evidential functions, in which the computations of various evidential functions can be performed in linear time (Barnett 1981; Shafer, et al. 1987; Guan, et al. 1995).\nBarnett’s linear-time technique provides a feasible way for efficiently computing various evidential functions. However, two issues arise when this technique is applied to combining the outputs of ensemble classifiers. The first is that given a list of evidence, the dichotomous structure does not distinguish trivial evidential\nelements from important ones. This could lead to a deterioration in the performance of classification decision when multiple classifiers are combined. The second is that it is difficult to establish a measure for obtaining basic probability assignments for dichotomous elements − a single focus, its complement, and ignorance. In practice, when multiple pieces of evidence of classifiers being combined in a multiple classifier system, evidence elements (decision classes) consist of a list of decision classes. These decision classes are not equally important in determining the final decision. It is necessary to introduce a weighting mechanism to give high weights to decisions deemed important and lower weights to less important ones, and incorporate these weights into the decision making process to determine the final decision.\nThe awareness of the above issues motivates us to develop a novel triplet structure to cope with the above issues. To obtain a triplet from a list of decision classes, we have developed a new operation, called an outstanding rule − a focusing operation. It not only separates trivial elements from important ones, but also serves as an effective mechanism for allocating basic probability assignments to focal elements within triplets. To justify the triplet structure and the outstanding rule, we provide a theoretical support for how this rule can be used to derive mass functions and establish the formulae for combining two or more results obtained by the outstanding rule. The computational complexity of these formulae can be achieved in linear time (Bi 2004)."

It is also called a singleton when H is a one element subset.

      "text" : "In particular, a mass function m is said to be a dichotomous function if the only possible focal elements of m are A, Θ − A, Θ for some A ⊆ Θ. A special case occurs when A is a singleton. In such a situation, a dichotomous mass function m has no focuses other than {x}, Θ − {x},Θ for some x which is referred to as a dichotomous structure (Barnett 1981).\nLet Θ = {x1, x2, ..., x|Θ|}. Suppose that for every i = 1, 2, ..., |Θ|, there is a dichotomous mass function mi: pi = mi({xi}), ci = mi(Θ − {xi}), ri = mi(Θ), where pi + ci + ri = 1 for i = 1, 2, ..., |Θ|. We view these quantities as follows:\n• pi is the measure of support for {xi}; • ci is the measure of support for the refutation of {xi}; and\n• ri is the measure of the support not assigned for or against the proposition {xi}.\nBarnett’s technique is based on the dichotomous mass functions instead of general mass functions. It means that instead of potentially exponential calculation, the computation of dichotomous mass functions involves only the 3 particular subsets {x}, Θ−{x}, Θ for each x ∈ Θ, while the general mass functions have to enumerate all 2|Θ| subsets of Θ.\nBarnett’s approach is to consider the entire orthogonal sum for evidence bodies which have the structure m1 ⊕ m2 ⊕ ... ⊕ m|Θ|. These are precisely those evidence spaces which are separable into exactly |Θ| dichotomous mass functions m1, m2, ..., m|Θ|. Guan, et al. (1995) generalized this to consider the general orthogonal sum as explained below.\nLet Θ = {x1, ..., x|Θ|}. Suppose that for some xi ∈ Θ, there are li dichotomous mass functions of repeat focuses as defined previously: mij({xi}) = pij , mij(Θ− {xi}) = cij ,mij(Θ) = rij ; pij + cij + rij = 1; where i = 1, 2, ..., |Θ|; j = 1, 2, ..., li.

From Equation (2), the calculation of combining n dichotomous mass functions is divided into two parts. The first part is to combine the mass functions with repeated focal elements in terms of repeated focuses. The second part is to combine the mass functions without repeated focuses. Here we\nonly present the former to show that the calculation of combining such mass functions requires linear time (Guan, et al. 1995)."

      "text" : "In this section, we start with a formalism of a new evidence structure, and then we prove that our techniques are compatible with the conventional evidential function − mass function. Definition 2 Let Θ be a frame of discernment and ϕ(d) = {m({x1}), m({x2}), ..., m({xn})}, where |n| ≥\n2, an expression of the form Y = 〈A1, A2, A3〉 is defined as a triplet, where A1, A2 are singletons, and A3 is the whole set Θ, and they satisfy\nm(A1)⊕m(A2)⊕m(A3) = 1\nThese elements are obtained by using a focusing operation σ on m, called the outstanding rule and denoted by mσ as follows:\nA1 = arg max m({x1}),m({x2}), ..., m({xn}) (11)\nA2 = arg maxm({x} | x ∈ {x1, ..., xn} − {u}) (12) A3 = Θ,mσ(Θ) = 1−mσ({u}) + mσ({v}) (13)\nWe refer to mσ as a triplet mass function or as a twopoint mass function. Likewise, we can consider mass functions for three-point focuses, four-point focuses, ..., n-point focuses. For the sake of simplicity, here we only consider mass functions for two-point focuses and their use. In comparison with the dichotomous structure, the triplet structure has the following properties:\n• When a frame of discernment Θ contains two focal elements, a triplet function is the same as a dichotomous function.\n• A dichotomous structure only has one variable, so if any singleton proposition or its negation is known, then the dichotomous structure is determined. However a triplet structure involves two variables, so the triplet structure is more general and complicated than the dichotomous structure.\n• To carry out the combination of two triplet functions, we look at the configuration of any two pairs of focal subsets, A1, A2 and B1, B2. For dichotomous functions: 1) If A1 = B1 then A2 = B2, A1∩B2 = ∅ and A2∩B1 = ∅, so the combined result involves three different focal elements. 2) If A1 6= B1 then A2 6= B2, A1 ∩ B2 6= ∅ and A2 ∩B1 6= ∅, so the combined result involves five different focal elements. For triplet functions: 1) If A1 = B1 and A2 = B2, then A1 ∩ B2 = ∅ and A2 ∩ B1 = ∅, so the combination of two triplet functions involves three different focal elements. 2) If A1 = B1 and A2 6= B2 then A1 ∩ B2 = ∅, A2 ∩ B1 = ∅ and A2 ∩ B2 = ∅ or if A2 = B2 and A1 6= B1, then A1 ∩B2 = ∅, A2 ∩B1 = ∅ and A1 ∩ B1 = ∅, so the combination of two triplet functions involves four different focal elements. 3) If A1 6= B1, A2 6= B2, A1 6= B2, and A2 6= B1 then A1 ∩ B1 = ∅, A2 ∩ B2 = ∅, A1 ∩ B2 = ∅ and A2 ∩B1 = ∅, so the combination involves five different focal elements.\n• Given triplet functions and dichotomous functions, intuitively the computations of combining two triplet functions is more efficient than that of combining two dichotomous functions because the computation of dichotomous functions requires more set operations than triplet functions. An empirical comparison is illustrated in Section 5.\nThrough the above comparisons, it can be seen that the formulae for computing dichotomous functions are not directly applicable to triplet functions. In cases 2) and 3) of triplet functions, the combinations of multiple triplet functions cannot be iteratively performed since we are only interested in combining two-point focuses. In the following sections, we provide theoretical proofs to show any two triplet mass functions are indeed combinable and develop formulae for computing the combinations of triplet functions for three different cases above (Bi 2004)."

Now we first consider the combination of m1,m2, below: By using Equations (18), (19) and (20), we have\n(m1 ⊕m2)({x}) = K(m1({x})m2({x})\n+m1({x})m2(Θ) + m1(Θ)m2({x})), (m1 ⊕m2)({y1}) = Km1({y1})m2(Θ), (m1 ⊕m2)({y2}) = Km1(Θ)m2({y2}),\n(m1 ⊕m2)(Θ) = Km1(Θ)m2(Θ), and for convenience, we use an alternative formula to calculate K−1 below:\nK−1 = ∑\nX∩Y 6=∅ m1(X)m2(Y ) = m1({x})m2({x})\n+m1({x})m2(Θ) + m1(Θ)m2({x}) +m1({y1})m2(Θ) + m1(Θ)m2({y2})\nAfter applying the outstanding rule on the combined result, we assume that the first focal element is {x} and the second element remains {y1}, then we simplify K−1 as\nK−1 = ∑\nX∩Y 6=∅ m1(X)m2(Y ) = m1({x})m2({x})\n+m1({x})m2(Θ) + m1(Θ)m2({x}) +m1({y1})m2(Θ)\nSubstituting pi, ci, ri for mi, we then have the combined result of m1,m2 is as follows:\nm1⊕m2({x}) = K(p1p2+p1(1−P2−c2)+p2(1−p1−c1)\nm1 ⊕m2({y1}) = K(c1(1− p2 − c2)) m1 ⊕m2(Θ) = K((1− p1 − c1)(1− p2 − c2))\nwhere\nK−1 = (p1p2 + p1(1− p2 − c2) + p2(1− p1 − c1))\n+(1− p1 − c1)(1− p2 − c2) + c2(1− p2 − c2) Repeating the same process above, we can obtain the approximate formulae for combining l triplet mass functions below:\nm({x}) = K( l∏\ni=1\npi + l∑\ni=1\n(1− di) l∏\nj=1,j 6=i pj + λ (30)\nm({yi}) = K(pi l∏\ni=2\n(1− di)) (31)\nm(Θ) = K( l∏\ni=1\n(1− di)) (32)\nwhere λ is a constant and\nk−1 = ( l∏\ni=1\npi + l∑\ni=1\n(1− di) l∏\nj=1,j 6=i (pj + λ)+\n(pi l∏\ni=2\n(1− di)) + ( l∏\ni=1\n(1− di)) (33)\nThese formulae are approximations to the exact formulae. At first glance, the computational effort of computing formula (31) requires l+l×l calculations, therefore its time complexity is about O(l + l2). For formulae (31)-(33), their time complexity is about O(3l+l2), i.e. O(l2). However, because each triplet only involves two singletons, the combination of two triplets also results in two singletons after applying the outstanding rule. Thus,the time complexity for computing all the cases is about O(3 × 2l) = O(2 × 3l) = O(2n), i.e. O(n). Our experimental results validate the estimate of this time complexity."

      "text" : "To perform comparative analysis on combining dichotomous functions and combining triplet functions with respect to both efficiency and accuracy, we have implemented a set of algorithms for combining the two types of mass functions: dichotomous mass functions and triplet mass functions respectively, and carried out a range of experiments in the domain of text categorization.\nFor our experiments, we chose a benchmark data set − 20-newsgroup − a collection of text documents. It consists of twenty categories and the total number of documents is 20,000. We first divided the data set into a training data set and a testing set by using a 70% − 30% proportion, and then used our rough sets-based learning algorithm to generate ten classifiers (classification models) from the training data set, denoted by R0, R1, ..., R9. Given a testing document from the testing data set, every classifier will produce an output in the form of a set of numeric scores − probabilities. Each of the scores indicates a probability of the document is assigned to a corresponding category. We model each list of the scores into a triplet and dichotomous structure as a piece of evidence. With the testing data set and ten classifiers, for each document, ten outputs will be generated in the forms of triplet and dichotomous, respectively. So the total number of the triplets or dichotomous generated is 10× 6, 000 = 60, 000.\nFor the efficiency comparison, we first combine two lists of triplets from two classifiers, three lists of triplets, etc. until ten lists of triplets are combined. In the same way, we combine two lists of dichotomous, three lists of dichotomous, and so forth. Figure 1 presents a comparison of running time required in combining ten classifiers. The time required for combining the classifier outputs in the form of triplet is about 40% faster than that of dichotomous structure.\nIn order to compare classification accuracy between the two methods of triplet and dichotomous, we conduct further experiments. The first task is to experiment with various combinations of classifiers over 10 out of 20 document categories, such as combining two classifiers, three classifiers, etc. The second is to average the accuracies of the combined classifiers, and select some of the combined classifiers using the 70% accuracy as a cut-off point. Figure 2 depicts the performance of a group of the selected classifiers. The classification accuracy of combining triplet mass functions is 2.07% better than that of combining dichotomous mass functions on average."

In this paper, we present a novel evidence structure in terms of a triplet and a set of algorithms for evidential reasoning. The merit of this structure is that it divides a set of evidence into three subsets, distinguishing trivial evidential elements from important ones − focusing some particular elements. It avoids the deficits of the dichotomous structure in representing the preference of evidence and estimating the basic probability assignment of evidence. We have established a formalism for this structure and the general formulae for combining pieces of evidence in the form of the triplet, which have been theoretically and empirically justified.",
