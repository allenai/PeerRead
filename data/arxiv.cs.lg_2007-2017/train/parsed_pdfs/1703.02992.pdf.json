      "text" : "The process of designing a model and learning its parameters by numerically optimizing a loss function is a cornerstone of machine learning. In this setting, it is common to place constraints on the model’s parameters to ensure that they are valid, to promote desirable characteristics such as sparsity, to incorporate domain knowledge, or to make learning more efficient. Because they can significantly impact the difficulty of an optimization problem, it is useful to understand the properties of particular types of constraints and to develop optimization techniques that preserve them.\nRecently, there has been interest in developing Riemannian optimization methods that enforce certain constraints by leveraging the geometry of the parameters that satisfy them, called the feasible set. Specifically, if the feasible set forms a smooth manifold in the original parameter space, then Riemannian optimization can be applied. Unlike other strategies for enforcing constraints, such as augmenting the loss function with penalty terms or projecting the parameters back onto the feasible set, this approach eliminates the need to deal with constraints explictly by performing optimization on the constraint manifold directly. In many cases, using Riemannian optimization can simplify algorithms, provide convergence guarantees on learning, and ensure that constraints are satisfied exactly rather than approximately.\nIn this work, we investigate Riemannian optimization methods for enforcing subspace constraints, which we define as any constraint that forces a matrix of parameters to represent one or more subspaces. There are two commonly used subspace constraints that have well-established Riemannian optimization methods provided in (Edelman, Arias, and Smith, 1998). The first is applicable when optimizing over matrices that define k-dimensional bases in an n-dimensional ambient space. In this case, the feasible set consists of all n× k matrices Y that satisfy Y TY = I , which corresponds to the Stiefel manifold. If the optimization is instead taken over all distinct k-dimensional subspaces, then in addition to the constraint that Y TY = I , two matrices must be considered identical if they have the same span. This second condition is important because it implies that during optimization, estimates must be updated to not only change the parameter matrix, but to do so in a way that changes the subspace it represents. The feasible set for this constraint corresponds to the Grassmannian manifold, which has proven useful for a large number of applications including background separation in video, human activity analysis, subspace tracking, and others (He, Balzano, and Lui, 2011; Turaga and Chellappa, 2009; He, Balzano, and Szlam, 2012). ar X iv :1 70 3.\n02 99\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 8\nM ar\n2 01\nWhile the constraints satisfied by optimizing on the Stiefel or Grassmannian manifolds are useful in practice, there are more general subspace constraints that are not captured by these manifolds and offer significant flexibility when setting up an optimization problem. To see this, first consider that a point on a Stiefel manifold can be viewed as a collection of k, 1-dimensional subspaces that are constrained to be mutually orthogonal. Similarly, a point on a Grassmannian manifold represents 1, k-dimensional subspace. It is therefore natural to consider a general constraint in which both the number of subspaces and their sizes can be specified by the user. These relationships are shown in figure 1. Importantly, subspace constraints of this form allow different set of features to be learned according to different criteria. In analogy to optimization on the Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds, we aim to optimize over distinct sets of m mutually orthogonal subspaces with sizes [k1, k2, ..., km], which we refer to as partitions.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel manifold that generalizes the Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds to implicitly enforce the general subspace constraints described above. Individual points on our proposed manifold define partitions of n-dimensional space into mutually orthogonal subspaces of particular sizes. In addition, we derive update rules for performing Riemannian optimization on the manifold. This allows features of the original space to be grouped in useful ways by defining separate objective functions on each subspace. For example, given two datasets X0 and X1, the linear features that best describe the two can easily be partitioned into a pair of subspaces containing features unique to each dataset and a subspace of features that are shared between them. Because of these characteristics, we refer to this manifold as the partitioned subspace\n(PS) manifold. Finally, we provide several examples using both real and synthetic data to illustrate how the manifold can be applied in practice, and to establish intuition for its properties.\nRelated work The problem of learning parameters subject to subspace constraints has been investigated widely and for a variety of applications. In general, these applications use only simple subspace constraints, which effectively cause the feasible set to be either the Grassmannian manifold or Stiefel manifold. Optimization subject to general subspace constraints has been investigated much less. Kim, Kittler, and Cipolla (2010) proposed an algorithm for face recognition that is similar to our work in that they also learn a set of mutually-orthogonal subspaces. However, their approach learns subspaces by incrementally updating and reorthogonalizing the subspace matrix, whereas we optimize on the constraint manifold itself using Riemannian optimization. Our work presents, to our knowledge, the first formulation of general subspace constraints as a manifold.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe background concepts and establish notation. Next, we define the partitioned subspace manifold and provide details necessary to use it for optimization in section 3. Finally, section 4 illustrates the various properties of the manifold and analyzes them through experiments on both real and synthetic data."

      "text" : "A Riemannian manifold, or simply a manifold, can be described as a continuous set of points that appears locally Euclidean at every location. More specifically, a manifold is a topological space and a collection of differentiable, one-to-one mappings called charts. At any point on a ddimensional manifold, there is a chart that maps a neighborhood containing that point to the Euclidean space IRd (Absil, Mahony, and Sepulchre, 2009). This property allows a tangent space to be defined at every point, which is an Euclidean space consisting of directions that point along the manifold. Tangent spaces are particularly important for optimization because they characterize the set of update directions that can be followed without leaving the manifold. While the most familiar manifold is Euclidean space, a large number of other, more exotic manifolds can be defined. The manifolds discussed in this paper are examples of matrix manifolds, meaning that they consist of points that can be represented as matrices.\nGiven a manifold, it is often useful to define a quotient manifold by specifying an equivalence relation that associates sets of points on the original manifold with individual points on the quotient (Edelman, Arias, and Smith, 1998). Because each point on the quotient is an equivalence class of points on the parent manifold, we use the notation [p] to refer to a point on the quotient that contains p, where p is an element of the parent manifold. Quotient manifolds inherit a great deal of structure from their parent manifold. In particular, constraints that define the parent manifold also apply to the quotient.\nTo illustrate this, consider the Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds, which can be defined as quotients of the group of orthogonal matrices. Later in section 3, the derivation for the partitioned subspace manifold will follow a similar pattern. The orthogonal group, denoted On, consists of all n×nmatricesQ that satisfy the conditionQTQ = I . Note that in this work, we use Q to refer to an element of this set. From this definition, we see that each point [Q]St on a Stiefel manifold is a set of matrices from the orthogonal group whose first k columns match those of Q. Similarly, each point [Q]Gr on a Grassmannian manifold corresponds to those orthogonal group matrices whose first k columns span the same subspace. These relationships can be expressed mathematically as follows:\nStiefel points [Q]St = {QE}E∈ESt Grassmannian points [Q]Gr = {QE}E∈EGr\nwhere\nESt = [ Ik On−k ] , and\nEGr = [ Ok\nOn−k\n]\nBecause they encode the relationship between matrices that map to the same point on the quotient, we refer to the sets ESt and EGr as the equivalence sets for their respective manifolds.\nRepresentative elements As defined above, points on the Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds are equivalence classes [Q] of orthogonal matrices Q ∈ On. However, in practice, these points are represented by single, n × k matrices Y . This discrepancy occurs because in general, only the subspace spanned by the first k columns is of interest. Given a point [Q] on these manifolds, we refer to Y as a representative element defined by:\nY = Q′ [ Ik 0 ] , s.t. Q′ ∈ [Q]"

      "text" : "Optimization on manifolds requires specialized Riemannian optimization methods to ensure that the learned parameters remain valid. While many standard optimization methods have been derived on manifolds (Edelman, Arias, and Smith, 1998), we focus on Riemmannian gradient descent because of its simplicity. As in standard gradient descent, the goal is to use the gradient of a differentiable convex function f with respect to the matrix Q, denoted GQ, to construct a sequence of estimates Q′ = Q − αGQ that converges to the minimum of f , where the parameter α controls the size of the update at each step. However, in Riemannian gradient descent, the estimates are constrained to lie on a manifold.\nRiemannian gradient descent proceeds by iterating three steps, as illustrated in Figure 2. The first step is to compute the gradient at the current location, which is given by GQ = ∇Qf .\nNext, the update direction is modified to reflect the geometry of the underlying manifold. Intuitively, if some component of the update direction is orthogonal to the manifold’s surface, then any movement at all along that direction will immediately leave the manifold. To correct for this, the update direction is projected onto the tangent space at the current location. We denote the projected update direction as ∆ = πTQM (GQ), where πTQM (·) projects its input onto the tangent space of manifold M at Q.\nThe final step of Riemmannian gradient descent computes a new location by moving along the manifold in the direction ∆. This is accomplished using the exponential map, which maps elements of a tangent space onto the manifold by moving in a straight line along its surface. For matrix manifolds, the exponential map is given by the matrix exponential function exp(·), and the updated location is given by the following formula, as shown in (Edelman, Arias, and\nSmith, 1998):\nQ′ = Q exp(αQT ∆) (1)\nUnfortunately, computing updates in this way is inefficient due to the cost of evaluating the matrix exponential. Instead, it is common to use a retraction, which behaves similarly to the exponential map but may distort the magnitude of the update. Depending on the manifold, these alternatives may be comparably inexpensive. For example, updates on quotient manifolds of the orthogonal group can be performed using the Q-factor retraction, which maps an update ∆ at the point Q to the location Q′ = qr(Q + ∆), where qr(·) denotes the Q matrix of the QR decomposition of its input (Absil, Mahony, and Sepulchre, 2009).\nThe steps of computing the standard gradient, projecting onto the tangent space at the current point Q, and updating the location using an appropriate retraction are repeated until convergence."

      "text" : "The PS manifold is defined as a quotient of the orthogonal group, similarly to how the Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds were defined in section 2.1. Here, the difference will be the use of a generalized equivalence relation. For the Stiefel manifold, the equivalence relation equates two orthogonal group matrices if they are related by a rotation of their last n−k columns. The Grassmannian equivalence relation, on the other hand, equates two matrices if they are\nrelated by both a rotation of their last n− k columns and a rotation of their first k columns. The PS manifold equivalence relation generalizes this pattern by equating two matrices if they are related by rotation of the first k1 columns, or the next k2 columns, etc. Intuitively, rotations that only involve basis vectors for a single partition will not change the subspace they span, whereas rotations that mix basis vectors from different partitions will. Based on this, we define the partitioned subspace manifold as follows.\nDefinition 1 Let k1, k2, ..., km be subspace partition sizes, where m is the number of partitions. Furthermore, let n be the dimensionality of the ambient space, and let k =∑m\ni=1 ki ≤ n denote the total subspace size. We define the partitioned subspace manifold as a quotient of the group of orthogonal matrices, with points on the manifold characterized by:\nPS points [Q]PS = {QE}E∈EPS (2)\nwhere\nEPS =  Ok1 . . . Okm\nOn−k  (3) Similarly to the Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds, the last n − k columns are generally ignored, and points on the PS manifold are represented by n × k matrices Y = Q′ [ Ik 0 ]T for some Q′ ∈ [Q]PS . It is straightforward to show that the partitioned subspace manifold is equivalent to a Grassmannian manifold when m = 1 and k1 = k, and equivalent to the Stiefel manifold when m = k and kj = 1 for j = 1, 2, ...,m.\nNext, we characterize the tangent space for the PS manifold, which will be required for Riemannian optimization. Let Q be any element of an equivalence class defining a point on the PS manifold. Because the manifold is a quotient of On, it is subject to the orthogonality contraint QTQ = I . As shown by Edelman, Arias, and Smith (1998), this implies that elements ∆ of the tangent space at [Q] satisfy the skew-symmetry condition,QT ∆ = −∆TQ. It is straightforward to verify that ∆ = QA satisfies this condition for all skew-symmetric A. However, this does not fully characterize the tangent space at [Q] because there are directions of this form that lead only to points that are in the same equivalence class [Q]. These directions are exactly the ones for which movement in that direction is the same as multiplication by an element of EPS :\nQ exp(αQT ∆) = QE, E ∈ EPS\nSolving this equation reveals that updating Q in the direction ∆ will not change its equivalence class on the PS man-\nifold if ∆ is of the form:\n∆ = Q  Ak1 . . . Akm\nAn−k  , where each Ai is a ki × ki skew-symmetric matrix. Note that to reach this conclusion, we rely on the observation that QT ∆ = A, and that exp(A) ∈ O because A is skewsymmetric (Edelman, Arias, and Smith, 1998). Given these observations, tangent spaces on the partitioned subspace manifold are characterized as follows. Let Bi,j denote an arbitrary ki × kj matrix, and let B⊥,j and Bi,⊥ denote arbitary (n−k)×kj and ki× (n−k) matrices, respectively. The tangent space at a point [Q] on the partitioned subspace manifold is the set of all n× n matrices ∆ given by:\n∆ = Q  0 −BT2,1 · · · −BTm,1 −BT⊥,1 B2,1 0 · · · −BTm,2 −BT⊥,2 ... ... . . . ... ...\nBm,1 Bm,2 · · · 0 −BT⊥,m B⊥,1 B⊥,2 · · · B⊥,m 0\n (4)"

      "heading" : "4.1.3. REMARKS",
      "text" : "MD-PCA highlights several of the benefits and considerations of using the PS manifold in practice.\nFirst, the mutual orthogonality constraints between the subspace partitions guarantee that a feature in one partition is not contained in any other, i.e., the dataset-specific features truly are unique. Because the manifold enforces mutualorthogonality exactly, there is never redundancy in the features that might otherwise be introduced due to the constraints only being satisfied approximately.\nSecond, these same constraints cause common features to be included in Qsh, and unique features to be included in the corresponding subspace Qi, despite the lack of explicit discriminative terms in the loss function. Intuitively, if a feature is important for reconstructingXi, then the ith term in Equation 7 will encourage it to be contained in either Qi or Qsh. If that feature is also important for reconstructing a different dataset Xj , then the jth term will behave sim-\nilarly, and the pressure to include it in Qsh will dominate the pressure to include it in Qi or Qj . On the other hand, if the feature is unique to Xi, then the loss terms for the other datasets will encourageQsh to be populated with other features, so that the pressure to include it in Qi will be uncontested while the pressure to include it in Qsh will be neutralized. This behavior arises because the mutual orthogonality constraints captured by the PS manifold prevent a feature from being in multiple partitions simultaneously. If the partitions were not constrained in this way, for example if they were optimized as points on separate Grassmannian manifolds, then shared features would tend to mix with the per-dataset features, introducing redundancy and increasing the overall reconstruction error.\nFinally, the use of the PS manifold simplifies the presentation of the algorithm by eliminating the steps that would otherwise have to be taken to enforce the mutual orthogonality constraints.\nOn the other hand, there are limitations to this approach. Foremost, while MD-PCA extracts and partitions features for multiple datasets, those datasets must represent the data in a consistent way. In particular, if samples from two datasets have different dimensionality, as is often the case with image datasets for example, then MD-PCA cannot be applied without first processing the datasets to map them to a common feature space.\nAlso, MD-PCA requires the user to specify not only the total subspace size, as in PCA, but also the size of each partition. Figure 3 shows how the variance explained by the subspace partitions changes as the per-dataset partition size is varied. In general, the total variance explained for each dataset does not change much as the partition size changes, until the per-dataset partitions become large enough to cause the shared partition to be very small. This observation implies that in practice, the size of the perdataset partitions can be set liberally as long as the shared partition remains reasonably large. We hypothesize that the decrease in explained variance occurs when the shared partition becomes too small to contain all of the common features, which causes one dataset to ”steal” the feature into its partition while the reconstruction error suffers for the other datasets."

Secondly, we constrain the subspaces to be mutually orthogonal to promote better discrimination between classes after projection. The partitioned subspace manifold makes it straightforward to specify and implement this objective.\nWe note that while the strategy of identifying domain- or label-specific features is not new to domain adaptation, the use of explicitly partitioned subspaces to capture those features has, to the best of our knowledge, not been investigated.\nFirst, we define Q to be a partitioned subspace, where each partition will contain features that describe source samples with a given label y. To encourage the subspace to capture the structure of the source and target domains, we minimize the reconstruction error of approximating Xs and Xt by their projections onto Q. In addition, we promote discriminative subspaces by maximizing the magnitude of each source sample when projected onto its corresponding class partition, and minimizing the magnitude when projected onto the remaining partitions.

The first, called the Geodesic Flow Kernel (GFK) method, computes one subspace to represent the source data and another to represent the target. A similarity between samples is then\ncomputed by integrating their inner product after projection onto all intermediate subspaces between the source and target. The similarities are then used as input to a 1-NN classifier (Gong et al., 2012). We include results for two versions of GFK: in the configuration GFK(PCA,PCA), the source and target subspaces are learned using PCA, while in GFK(PLS,PCA), partial least squares (PLS) is used to learn a source subspace that captures covariance between the source data and the available labels (Wold, Sjöström, and Eriksson, 2001).\nThe second approach we compare to is Subspace Alignment (SA), which first computes source and target subspaces in a similar way to GFK.

After the transformation is applied, a support vector machine classifier is trained (Fernando et al., 2013).

To ensure a fair comparison, we used the same evaluation protocols used for GFK and SA for our experiments (Gong et al., 2012; Fernando et al., 2013).\nFor our experiments, we conducted trials using partition sizes kcs of 20 and 80 dimensions.

      "text" : "In this work, we presented a formulation for the Partitioned Subspace Manifold, which captures the geometry of mutually orthogonal subspaces, and provided the necessary components for optimizing on the manifold using Riemannian optimization techniques. The ability to specify and easily optimize under general subspace constraints offers a significant amount of flexibility in designing new loss functions. To illustrate this, we proposed and analyzed multiple-dataset PCA, an extension of the principle component analysis which is able to group features from multiple datasets according to whether they are unique to a specific dataset or shared between them. In addition, we showed how the PS manifold can be used to learn class-specific features for domain adaptation and proposed a method that achieves comparable accuracy several standard approaches. We are actively interested in extending this formulation to allow subspace partitions to be adaptively resized so that they can be more effective in online settings, where the optimal partition sizes may change."

One solution is to use Riemannian optimization methods that enforce such constraints implicitly, leveraging the fact that the feasible parameter values form a manifold. While Riemannian methods exist for some specific problems, such as learning a single subspace, there are more general subspace constraints that offer additional flexibility when setting up an optimization problem but have not been formulated as a manifold. We propose the partitioned subspace (PS) manifold for optimizing matrices that are constrained to represent one or more subspaces. Each point on the manifold defines a partitioning of the input space into mutually orthogonal subspaces, where the number of partitions and their sizes are defined by the user. As a result, distinct groups of features can be learned by defining different objective functions for each partition. We illustrate the properties of the manifold through experiments on multiple dataset analysis and domain adaptation.",
