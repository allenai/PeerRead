      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the subarea of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which focuses on building software systems that generate text or speech in human languages. Typically the input of an NLG system is some non-linguistic representation, such as knowledge bases or numerical data. Data-to-text generation is the area of Natural Language Generation (NLG) which elaborates the summarisation of numerical data, such as time-series data from sensors or event logs (Reiter and Dale, 2000). This survey particularly focuses on time-series data, i.e. data which change\nover time. Examples of such data are sensor data (e.g. heart rate, breathing rate), weather data, stock market data, etc. which can be found in modern applications on mobile phones and wearable gadgets as well as traditional desktop applications. Reiter (2007) proposes a general architecture for data-to-text systems which consists of four distinct modules: (1) Signal Analysis, (2) Data Interpretation, (3) Document Planning and (4) Microplanning and Realisation. The four modules are described briefly below and their relations are depicted in Figure 1:\n1. Signal Analysis: The Signal Analysis module is responsible for analysing the input data, identifying patterns and trends. This is an essential part of a data-to-text system when the input is numerical data.\n2. Data Interpretation: The Data Interpretation module is responsible for detecting causal and other relations between the patterns and trends identified by the Signal Analysis module. This module is useful for NLG systems that aim to communicate more complex messages, such as explanations.\n3. Document Planning: This module decides which of the identified patterns, trends and relations should be conveyed in the generated textual summary, a task known as content selection. It is also responsible for structuring the generated text, i.e. deciding on information ordering, the paragraph breaks in longer generated documents and the general structure of a document. The document planner is essential when part of the available content needs to be communicated, such as in report generation or summarisation of timeseries data.\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n08 37\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n6 O\nct 2\n01 6\n4. Microplanning and Realisation: This module actually generates the output text. Every NLG system contains a realisation module, which can be either template based, i.e. canned text, or it can use sophisticated methods based on syntax, sentence structure and morphology.\nThe focus of the survey is on the task of content selection from time-series data. In this survey, assumed applications generate summaries of a paragraph long or documents whose structure is predefined.\nTime-series data such as sensor data, weather data, stock market data etc., often has a complex internal structure and its analysis in order to derive the underlying information is domaindependent. Humans can summarise time-series data effectively by using natural language. According to (Gkatzia et al., 2014a), the descriptions of time-series data can be a result of an interplay of decisions, for example, one can decide to mention the unusual fluctuations, the averages or the timeseries changes (trends) over time. Moreover, they can decide to refer to the data in a sensible order, or to use their broad knowledge to justify and/or explain the time-series data. In contrast, the task of\nautomatically determining the content for effective summarisation of time-series data continues to be challenging, due to the fact that content determination in general is domain-dependent. The necessity of general content selection models has been acknowledged by the NLG community (BouayadAgha et al., 2012)."

      "heading" : "1.1 Why a survey on content selection, and how to read it?",
      "text" : "Content selection approaches have been developed considerably since the overview presented by Reiter and Dale (2000). These new approaches have been presented and published in very different venues, which makes it hard for a newcomer to investigate all the available literature. In this single survey, there is work presented from over 30 different publication venues, ranging from computational linguistics to data mining, artificial intelligence and medical informatics.\nThe added value of this survey is that it collects all relevant literature and discusses it in an informative way. In addition, directions for future work are suggested. Consequently, this survey is addressed to all researchers and practitioners of natural language generation, who aim to start working on or they resumed working on content selection. As it includes an informative introduction, it can be useful for students and researchers who are new to this field, as well as experienced researchers who want to catch up with latest developments.\nThe next section describes the motivation of dealing with the task of content selection from time-series data (Section 2). Section 3 presents the challenges of content selection in data-to-text systems. Then, the survey describes the related work in this area. It classifies the related work into two main areas: rule-based approaches 4 and trainable methods 5. Section 6 discusses adaptive NLG systems, followed by a discussion on evaluation metrics (Section 7). Finally, Section 8 concludes the work presented in this survey and Section 9 presents opportunities for future research. Appendix A includes a list of the available datasets for data-to-text generation."

In particular, it aims to answer: (1) why it is important for data-\nto-text systems to determine the relevant content (Section 2.1); (2) why it is preferable to present textual summaries of time-series data rather than graphical representations (Section 2.2); and (3) why it is important for content selection to be useradaptive (Section 2.3)."

      "text" : "Data-to-text systems are useful for simplifying the presentation of complex data. The overload of time-series data available through the web, sensors and other means has increased the need of digesting these data in an automatic, accurate and timeefficient manner. NLG systems can deal with this challenge in an automatic and fast way. For example, an NLG system can read sensor data and produce a comprehensive textual summary. Previous research on generation from time-series data has been conducted in several domains such as weather forecasts (Sripada et al., 2004; Konstas and Lapata, 2012; Gkatzia et al., 2016a), health informatics (Gatt et al., 2009; Gkatzia et al., 2016b), stock market summaries (Kukich, 1983) and assistive technology systems (Black et al., 2010). These systems have employed different content selection methods, which are reviewed in Section 4 and 5. In addition, it is essential for data-to-text systems to choose the relevant information to communicate so as to satisfy the users’ preferences or to assist in decision making (Gkatzia et al., 2016a)."

      "heading" : "2.2 Effectiveness of Textual Summaries over Graphical Representations",
      "text" : "Data and in particular time-series data is normally presented using visualisation techniques that can be difficult for an inexperienced user to understand. Data-to-text systems face the challenge of communicating the data in a simpler, more effective and more understandable way, by conveying information through language. Recent studies have showed that text descriptions of data can be more effective, comprehensible and helpful in decision making than the corresponding graphical representations (van den Meulen et al., 2010; Law et al., 2005), even when the data is uncertain (Gkatzia et al., 2016a).\nEarly research has shown that graphs require expertise in order to be interpreted (Petre, 1995). More recently, Law et al. (2005) compare expertgenerated text summaries with the corresponding pattern graphs in relation to their effectiveness to support clinical decisions. In that study, clini-\ncal staff are shown text summaries and graphical representations of patient’s data and are asked to make a decision about the health condition of the patient. It is found that clinical staff tend to make correct clinical decisions when viewing the textual format of the data rather than when consulting the graphs.\nvan den Meulen et al. (2010) describe a similar survey which focuses on the effectiveness of text compared to graphs in decision making in the health domain. The evaluation process follows the one described by (Law et al., 2005). This study shows that, although users prefer the textual descriptions produced by humans, the computerised textual reports are as useful in decision making as the graphs that the staff were familiar with.\nHunter et al. (2011) focus on the potential of improving clinical decisions by employing NLG. Indeed, their approach is evaluated by presenting nurses a computer generated summary with the corresponding data graph. Then, nurses are asked to make a clinical decision. It is found that exposure to textual summaries lead to comparable decision making as with the graphical representations. Gatt et al. (2009) present a system evaluation in the same domain. It is shown that all the users (doctors and nurses) perform better in parallel tasks (making decisions after viewing a text summary vs. a graphical representation) with human-written texts rather than graphs. Compared to computer-generated summaries, they perform worse than they perform with the hand-written texts, however the users find the computer-based texts as useful as the graphs.\nMore recently, Gkatzia et al. (2015) presented a game whose aim is to measure decision making under uncertainty with different conditions (graphical representations vs. text vs. multi-modal representation). It was found that for specific user groups text descriptions of weather data led to better decision making than other descriptions (Gkatzia et al., 2016a).\nThese examples of previous research show that the interpretation of graphical representations is not always obvious. It also shows that textual descriptions can effectively support and enhance decision making. Although we acknowledge the importance of combining text and visualisations (e.g. (Gkatzia et al., 2016a; Mahamood et al., 2014; Sripada and Gao, 2007)), in this survey we focus only on automatic content selection from time-series\ndata."

      "heading" : "2.3 Adaptive Output",
      "text" : "Different user groups such as doctors, nurses and parents or lecturers and students have different information needs and preferences, therefore personalised reports are important. Hunter et al. (2011) emphasise that personalisation should be based on relevant factors/ variables as for instance users’ stress level, and not only demographic data, although in some cases demographic data can be important to adaptation. Users have different preferences and goals and the systems should adapt to those in order to be more preferable. DiMarco et al. (2008) emphasise that it is necessary for a system to avoid referring to events that seem irrelevant for the majority of the users, but are relevant for a particular user. For example, today’s health care systems can provide too much irrelevant information to patients or omit important information, which leads the users to believe that the system is not addressed to them (DiMarco et al., 2008). This can have, for instance, negative impact on the patients’ compliance with medical regimens. Similarly, in the student feedback domain, a general system would advice students to study x hours per day. For a hard-working student this advice might be irrelevant or even disturbing (Gkatzia, 2015).\nOn a related note, Gkatzia et al. (2013) show that there is a mismatch between the preferences of students and lecturers on what constitutes a good feedback summary and therefore they introduce a new task, Multi-adaptive Natural Language Generation (MaNLG), which aims to find a balance between the preferences (or other conditions of interest) of two different user groups, as for instance, lecturers and students, or patients and doctors (Gkatzia et al., 2014b)."

      "heading" : "3 Challenges for Content Selection in Data-to-text Systems",
      "text" : "In this section, the challenges for content selection in data-to-text systems and recommendations for addressing them are presented.\n• Data availability: The lack of aligned datasets (data and corresponding summaries) that can be used to derive rules or to train an NLG system is a major challenge for NLG engineers. Although data are widely available, they cannot be used directly for the de-\nvelopment of an NLG system, because there is lack of alignment between input and output data (Belz and Kow, 2010). Data-driven datato-text systems require large corpora with data that can be aligned to natural language text so as to be used as an input to a training algorithm. In Appendix ??, we offer a list of freely available datasets for data-to-text generation.\n• Domain dependence: Data-to-text systems are domain sensitive which makes it hard to transfer modules or data between domains.\n• Evaluation challenges: As other areas of Computational Linguistics, NLG also suffers from the limitations of the available evaluation methods. Reiter and Sirpada (2002) firstly questioned the suitability of corpusbased approaches to evaluation of NLG systems, followed by (Foster and Oberlander, 2006) and (Belz and Reiter, 2006). Text corpora from data are usually gathered by asking experts to provide written textual summaries or descriptions. However, experts use different words to communicate the data or they choose to refer to different events, which makes it difficult to construct a consistent dataset and therefore using it as gold standard for evaluation.\n• Lack of or inconsistent expert knowledge: Another issue is the lack of expert knowledge or the difficulties of acquiring it due to several factors, such as difficulties in recruiting experts. The main challenge is that experts provide a variety of responses, which introduces difficulties in knowledge acquisition. This challenge has been also noted by (Sripada et al., 2004).\n• Lack of prior knowledge of the users: One of the most crucial issues in adaptation is the lack of prior knowledge of the users. This issue has been raised by several researchers, such as (Janarthanam, 2011; Han et al., 2014), to name a few. Previous approaches to tackling this issue include the use of latent User Models (Han et al., 2014), initial questionnaires to derive information by the user (Reiter et al., 1999) and tackling first-time users using multi-objective optimisation (Gkatzia et al., 2016b).\nAlthough these are important challenges, there are ways to address them. The data availability issue can only be solved by creating parallel corpora for every new domain, or investigate approaches which allow the transfer of knowledge from one domain to another. The evaluation of data-to-text systems can be improved by performing human evaluations, and in particular task-based evaluations. The lack of prior knowledge of the user can be solved by investigating approaches which aim at addressing to unknown users."

      "heading" : "4 Rule-based Content Selection in Data-to-Text Systems",
      "text" : "This section describes previous work that treats content selection in a rule-based manner. Table 1 summarises the methods and application domains of these systems. One of the earliest data-to-text applications is TREND (Boyd, 1998). TREND includes a very detailed module for time-series analysis using wavelets. However, this system does not include a notion of content selection, as it is mostly focused on describing all trends that are observed in data.\nSripada et al. (2001) suggest a “two-stage model for content selection” from time series data (sensor readings from a gas turbine and numerical weather simulations). The model assumes that the data source is an external component and that a Domain Reasoner (DR) module is evident. The DR is responsible for making inferences. The inferences together with the system’s communicative goal are used for building an overview of the summary. Finally, the Communication Reasoner module takes as input the output of the DR and it specifies the final content, which is then available to the other NLG tasks, i.e. microplanning and surface realisation. It is worth mentioning that this approach is suggested before 2007, when a general data-to-text approach is introduced by (Reiter, 2007), as we discussed in the introduction.\nSripada et al. (2003) introduces a domainindependent approach to Natural Language Generation using Gricean Maxims from the same data sources as previously mentioned plus medical sensor data. The Gricean maxims are used in order to communicate the content, after the segmentation algorithms have been applied for data analysis (Sripada et al., 2003). The maxims reflect the cooperative principle that describes how people communicate and act with one another, by\nusing utterances, their flow and their meaning. The Gricean maxims (Grice, 1975) constitute the Quality, Quantity, Relation and Manner maxims and they are inspired by the pragmatics of natural language. The maxim of Quality influences the content selection decisions regarding the real values of the data by using linear interpolation. The maxim of Quantity decides on which data patterns are useful for the user. The maxim of Relevance estimates which information might be relevant to a particular user and User Models are acquired for this task, as in (Reiter et al., 2003). Finally, the maxim of Manner influences the linguistic decisions, i.e. how the information should be conveyed, without ambiguity, briefness and in a sensible order.\nHallet et al. (2006) present a content selection approach for summarisation of medical histories which is based on two elements: (1) the type of the summary and (2) the length of the summary. They also introduce a list of concepts and, events which are linked to those concepts. During the content selection phase, the events are clustered in terms of relevance. It is assumed that smaller clusters do not include important events and therefore, only the larger clusters of events are mentioned in the summary. Depending on the type and the length of the summary the content attributes are determined in a rule-based fashion. For instance, a problem might be a main event and its attributes can be name, status, clinical course etc.\nSripada and Gao (2007) report the ScubaText system which generates reports from scuba-dive computer data and it detects the safety of the dives. The data analysis module determines the interpretations of the patterns identified regarding the safety of dives. Decompression models (similar to those used by dive computers) are used to generate recommendations on when the bottom is safe for diving. Using these interpretations, deviations from the actual dive are computed. Then, ratings are assigned inversely proportional to the deviations and they influence the text generation decisions.\nYu et al. (2007) present SumTime-Turbine, a system that summarises large time-series data sets from gas turbines’ sensors. This system adopts a bottom-up approach, where the NLG system emerges by joining subsystems together. It consists of two main components: a data analysis module that is responsible for content selection\nand the Natural Language Generation module. The data analysis component can be further split up into:\n• Pattern Recognition, which is responsible for connecting time-series segments to concepts.\n• Pattern Abstraction, which maps patterns to abstract concepts .\n• Interesting Pattern Selection, which is responsible for deciding which of the abstract patterns should be conveyed in the summary. The content is determined by using domain knowledge and historical pattern frequency.\nThe content order is based on rules obtained via corpus analysis and is inspired by the way that ex-\nperts tend to summarise sensor data. In particular, the content follows the following ordering.\n• Background information\n• Overall Description\n• Most significant patterns\nTurner et al. (2008) present a decision tree approach to content selection in the domain of description generation of geo-referenced data. In this framework, content is represented as leaves of a tree, whereas the nodes represent events. The text is then generated from the content that exists in leaves. Figure 2 shows the overview of events and content. In a similar domain, (Thomas et al., 2010) use document schemas to induce document plans\nfor textual descriptions of geo-referenced data for blind users. The selection of the schema is influenced by the spatial data analysis.\nHallet et al.’s (2006) algorithm is also used for content planning at the BabyTalk system (Gatt et al., 2009), which produces text summaries of neonatal intensive care unit data. The data used as input consist of (1) sensor data (Heart Rate, mean Blood Pressure and Oxygen Saturation), (2) lab results and observations, (3) events such as nurses actions, medical diagnosis and treatment and other information, and (4) free text. The BT-45 system generates a summary after 45 minutes of measurements and collection of the data mentioned earlier (Portet et al., 2007). Its aim is to interpret the data by linking events to observations, not to offer diagnosis.\nIn this system, content selection is handled as described in (Hallett et al., 2006), where the length of the goal summary is a deciding factor as well as the type of problem. The events are assigned an importance value which represents their significance in the data interpretation module, but it ignores the possibility of a value change after content selection, e.g. an event that explains a fact may be omitted, thus making the summary noncoherent. The events are clustered in terms of relevance and the first step of the summarisation dictates the removal of the smaller clusters, because they are usually irrelevant. Next, the important events and the level of details are influenced by the relevance to the type of summary. However, the system lacks in updating the importance of the events (regarding the probability to be selected) after one event is being selected.\nBlack et al. (2010) develop a story generation rule-based system that is addressed to children with Complex Communication Needs. The input of this system is non-linguistic data gathered through sensors which describe the child’s location, activities and interactions with people or objects. Specifically, the data are collected through: (1) RDIF readers which monitor the places that the child visits, (2) a microphone that is used for recording events, and (3) a visual interface and an access switch that the child can use with its head. The teacher and the school staff can also enter information about the child’s activities. Figure 4 presents the overall structure of the system.\nThe goal of the system is to automatically generate a narrative about “how was school today...”.\nThe system groups elements into events in order to determine the content (Peddington and Tintarev, 2011), by using clustering algorithms to classify events depending on the location, the time and the voice recordings. It also employs rules to define unexpected events, for example the divergence with the child’s usual timetable and activities. The derived rules are based on a User Model that takes into account the child’s cognitive model, the timetable, unexpected events and inherent “interestingness” five events are selected out of twelve (Tintarev et al., 2016).\nDemir et al. (2011) present an approach to summarisation of bar charts. This is a domainindependent approach which is based on users’ scores of potential content to be present in a brief summary. After averaging scores from a data collection, derived rules determine what information of a graph should be included in the summary.\nJohnson and Lane (2011) present Glaykos, a system that automatically generates audio visual debriefs for underwater missions. The data used are collected through an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) that is armed with sensors. The sensor data describe attributes of the bottom of the sea. In order to generate the multimodal output, a situation model is used, which consists of a bitmap situation model and a vector situation model in order to include all the data from the underwater mission and the related simple and complex concepts. Initially, the data from the mission are processed and linked with the other elements of this bitmap situation model. From this, a vector situation model is created, which models the motivation and the causation models. Next, the events are ordered and grouped together according to the time they happened (adjacent time), whether they have the same actor, whether they do not have contradictory motivations and depending\non their causal relations. These groups are viewed as an instance of the travelling salesman problem, where each group represents one city. In order to solve this, two optimisation algorithms have been applied, a depth-first search and a genetic algorithm. Both algorithms used the same fitness function, which is based on the spatiality of the event (a penalty is given if it is in a different region), temporality of the action, the protagonist, the motivation and the causality.\nBanaee et al. (2013) present a content selection approach for summarisation of physiological sensor data based on the importance of potential content messages: (1) messages conveying holistic information, (2) messages conveying events, and (3) messages which summarise events. Each message category uses a ranking function to assign an “importance” value to the message. The ordering of the message is based on how important the message is and whether there are dependencies between messages.\nSchneider et al. (2013) describe an approach to summarising medical sensor data in pre-hospital care (MIME project). The content selection module is rule-based and it uses trees that associate the chosen information, inspired by the Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988). The rules are derived through a combination of corpus analysis and expert consultation.\nSoto et al. (2015) describes an approach to short weather forecasts generation using fuzzy sets. In their approach, content selection is partially performed by a fuzzy operator, which chooses the\nuseful data from all the available data and then it converts it into data objects. Consequently, a list of episodes is created and is used for realisation.\nGkatzia et al. (2016a) present two rule-based approaches to weather forecast generation. The first approach (WMO-based) accounts for the uncertainty present in weather forecasts and it uses the guidelines (as rules) offered by the World Meteorological Organisation (Kootval, 2008)for referring to uncertain information. The second approach (NATURAL) imitates the way experts (i.e. professional weather forecasters) choose the content to be talked about in the weather forecasts. This approach is more natural than the WMObased, in that the probabilities are mapped to linguistic interpretation of weather (e.g. “sunny spells”) rather than the linguistic mapping of uncertainty (e.g. “likely”).\nDeriving rules by working with experts or by acquiring knowledge from expert generated corpora are two popular practices in developing rulebased data-to-text systems. These approaches offer many benefits as we discuss in Section 8."

      "heading" : "5 Trainable Approaches to Content Selection",
      "text" : "This section discusses trainable approaches to content selection. Trainable approaches to Natural Language Generation often treat content selection and surface realisation in a unified manner. Therefore, here we discuss systems that learn how to choose content, either as an independent task\nor jointly with surface realisation. Table 2 summarises trainable approaches to NLG.\nTrainable approaches to NLG have been initially introduced in sentence level (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995). Langkilde and Knight (1998) introduce a trainable approach to Natural Language Generation, which works in two steps. Initially, possible utterances are generated and then they are ranked according to probabilities derived through corpus analysis. Mellish et al. (1998) describe a similar stochastic approach based on over-generate and re-rank. The technique is applied in the context of text planning and is used to select the best of the candidate solutions (candidate solutions are generated and then the one to be present in the output is selected stochastically). A similar approach has been later used by Stent et al. (2004) for sentence level generation. Similarly, Duboue and McKeown (2002) present an approach to content planning using Genetic Algorithms that is able to identify common patterns in the data.\nDuboue and McKeown (2003) present a content selection approach where the available content consists of a corpus of text expressed as semantic features. They treated content selection as a classification task where the objective is to decide whether a database entry should be included in the output or not.\nBarzilay and Lapata (2005) propose a collective content selection approach which is a classification task that makes content decisions in a collective way. Their approach initially considers an “individual preference score”, which is defined as the preference of the entity to be chosen and it is estimated by: (1) the values of entity features, and (2) the potential association of similar entities. This method has been applied in sports domain where the data can be related in a timely manner, i.e. one player’s action can cause the injury of another. The collective content selection approach differs from Duboue and McKeown’s (2003) approach in that it allows contextual dependencies because the entries are selected depending on each other and not isolated.\nBarzilay and Lee (2004) treats content selection as HMMs, where states correspond to information types and state transitions define the potential ordering. The state transition probabilities define the chance to change from a given topic to another. Liang et al. (2009) present a model for generation\nusing a 3-tier HMMs in order to address the task of segmenting the utterances, mapping the sentences to meaning representations and choosing the content for generation. The aim of this model is to effectively cope with the segmentation, the grouping of relevant facts, and the alignment of the segmentation results to facts. For this purpose, it is assumed that a world state is represented by records and text, and each record is comprised of fields and their values. For example, in the weather domain, the text is the weather forecast, the records are the different weather attributes such as rain chance, temperature or wind speed, the fields can be the maximum or minimum temperature or wind speed and the values the numerical or categorical values. The parameters of this model are calculated through an EM algorithm and the model is tested in three domains in order to prove its generic nature: Robocup Sportcasting, Weather Reports and NFL Recaps. The process starts with the record selection, e.g. the temperature is selected for generation, then the field selection, e.g. the minimum temperature, and finally the word selection to be generated, e.g. the numerical values of the minimum temperature. The drawback of this model is that it does not treat record, field and word choices in a unified manner so as to capture potential dependencies. Therefore, Angeli et al. (2010) extend this model in order to capture the dependencies between records, fields and text. In their model the generation is regarded as a sequence of decisions.\nKonstas and Lapata (2012) present a framework for content selection by discriminatively reranking content using the structured perceptron for learning. In this framework, content features are seen as a hypergraph where nodes denote words. Graphical models have been used for NLG in dialogue systems as well, e.g. (Dethlefs and Cuayahuitl, 2011).\nLampouras and Androutsopoulos (2013) present an Integer Linear Programming model for generation. Their model combines content selection, lexicalisation and sentence aggregation. The ultimate goal of this method is to produce compact text with as short length as possible given an entity of OWL ontology and a set of OWL axioms (facts).\nMore recently classifiers have been used for content selection to decide whether an element should be mentioned in the summary or not. Sowdaboina et al (2014) use neural networks for\ncontent selection in the domain of weather forecasts. Kondadadi et al. (2013) report a statistical NLG framework for both content planning and realisation. Content is represented as semantic annotations and the realisation is performed using templates. The content selection and realisation decisions are learned from an aligned corpus using Support Vector Machines for modelling the generation and for creating a statistical model. Kondadadi et al. (2013) do not report using other algorithms for generation.\nGkatzia et al. (2014a) present and compares two trainable approaches to content selection. The first one uses multi-label classification to collectively learn the content to be chosen. In this framework, the learning task is formulated as follows: “given a set of X time-series factors, select the content that is most appropriate to be included in a sum-\nmary”. Labels represent content, whereas each label is represented by a template, and as a result the task can be seen as a classification task. Because the content should be considered simultaneously, multi-label classification is used. In contrast to traditional single-label classification, where the task is to associate a new observation with a label by selecting from a set of labels L, in multi-label classification the task is to associate an observation with a set of labels Y ⊆ L (Tsoumakas and Katakis, 2007). The second approach uses Reinforcement Learning (Gkatzia et al., 2013) for summarisation of time-series data. Content selection is regarded as a Markov Decision problem where the agent aims “to learn to take the sequence of actions that leads to optimal content selection”.\nFinally, Mahapatra et al. (2016)use multi-partite graphs for generation of weather forecasts. In their\nframework, a partition set for each attribute in the given non-textual dataset is created, and the content is chosen probabilistically from the graph.\nTrainable approaches offer many benefits to the developer, they can be easily transferred between domains, they can generalise for unseen instances and can eliminate the need to work with experts. However, big aligned datasets are needed for this task and the quality of the datasets is not always guaranteed. Section 8 expands on the benefits and drawbacks of trainable approaches and compares and contrasts them with rule-based approaches."

      "text" : "Adaptation is an area that has been studied in various fields of Computer Science and Human Computer Interaction and consequently, data-totext systems have been also concerned with adapting the output to particular users. One of the early approaches to adaptive Natural Language Generation is presented by Reiter et al. (1999) for the STOP system. This approach uses rules to map questionnaire answers to surface text. As each questionnaire only applies to a specific user, the output is personalised to a user’s specific answers.\nThe predominant way of adaptive data-to-text system is through user modelling. Table 3 summarises NLG systems that use User Models (UMs) along with the information included in the UMs. In the context of museum exhibits, Stock et al. (2007) describe an adaptive multi-modal interactive system, PEACH, that is addressed to museum visitors. It consists of:\n• a virtual agent that assists visitors and attracts their attention,\n• a user-adaptive video display on a mobile device and\n• a user adaptive summary that is generated at the end of the visit in the museum.\nA predecessor of PEACH is Ilex (O’donnell et al., 2001) which generates dynamic context in the domain of a virtual museum. PEACH is based on Ilex but it enhances the output with the tailored video. In Ilex, the generation was tailored to user’s specific attributes such as reason of visit, interest and change of background knowledge during the visit. The User Model is rule-based. Other innovations of Ilex include the fact that it allows the users\nto schedule their path and it makes use of the history to present richer summaries, for example by comparing different exhibits that the user has already visited. The content is selected by ranking content and select the most relevant of them.\nDemberg and Moore (2006) also suggest a User Model approach to Information Presentation in the context of flight recommendation. In their approach the selected content is influenced by the attributes a user finds important, such as price, number of stops etc. The novelty here is that in order to increase user confidence, the attributes with low value in the user model are briefly summarised, so as to help the user make an informed decision.\nNLG systems have also used User Models (UMs) in order to adapt their linguistic output to individual users (Janarthanam and Lemon, 2010; Thompson et al., 2004; Zukerman and Litman, 2001). For instance, (Janarthanam and Lemon, 2010) propose a system that adapts the generated referring expressions to the user’s inferred prior knowledge of the domain. As a user’s prior knowledge can change through interactions, they introduce dynamic user modelling which allows to update a User Model after interacting with the user.\nHan et al. (2014) suggest the use of latent User Models to NLG. In this framework, instead of directly seeking the users’ preferences or the users’ knowledge through questionnaires, the UMs are inferred through “hidden” information derived from sources such as Google Analytics.\nWalker et al. (2007) present an approach that adapts its surface realisations to individual users’ preferences, by using an over-generate and re-rank approach. The ranking step of this approach is influenced by the individual’s own preferences and therefore the generated realisations are different for each user. Mairesse and Walker (2007) present a system that recognises the Big Five personality traits and use this information for adapting the surface text to a particular user.\nNLG systems can employ different versions of a system for each different user group (Gatt et al., 2009; Hunter et al., 2011; Mahamood and Reiter, 2011). The BT project uses NLG systems in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit environment to automatically provide reports to different stakeholders. For example, BT-nurse is addressed to nurses working in NICU whereas BT-family is addressed to the parents and relatives of the baby and is able to further adapt to users’ stress levels.\nMore recently, Dethlefs et al. (2014) move away from user modelling by exploiting user ratings to infer users’ preferences on utterances describing restaurant suggestions. In their work, users are initially grouped together regarding their similarity in ratings. Then, the ratings of all users in the same cluster are used in order to predict the ratings of a specific user. Their approach is efficient in adapting to users’ linguistic preferences only after a few ratings are sourced, which means that the output might not be favourable for a first-time user. Therefore, Gkatzia et al. (2016b) propose a solution for this issue which eliminates the need of initial ratings for first-time users. This approach optimises for all available user groups (Gkatzia et al., 2014c) simultaneously using a multi-objective optimisation approach. Assuming that a first-time user will belong to one of the existing user groups and the output is optimised for all groups, the output will also be optimised for each first-time user."

      "text" : "Evaluation is very important for data-to-text systems and it can measure several aspects such as task success, effectiveness and similarity to gold standards. Evaluation can be either intrinsic (e.g. automatic metrics and user ratings) or extrinsic (e.g. evaluation with users in terms of task success), but the extrinsic evaluation is more important, in order to define for what an application is good for and to identify whether an application fulfils its task requirements. Next, we review some forms of evaluation highlighting in what they are successful of evaluating in relevance with the related work mentioned earlier. The evaluation methods are categorised into intrinsic and ex-\ntrinsic methods, adopting the terminology used by Belz and Hastie (2014)."

Recently, it has been widely used for the evaluation of data-to-text systems to measure the proximity of a machine generated text to a human generated text, e.g. (Angeli et al., 2010).\n• NIST (named after the US National Institute of Standards and Technology) is based on BLEU but it also assesses how informative an n-gram scoring higher for rarer n-gram occurrences (Doddington, 2002).\n• ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) package was also initially introduced to machine translation and summarisation communities, however it is widely used in NLG as well. It compares the output generated text against a reference\ntext (Lin, 2004). ROUGE is a summarisation evaluation package which consists of several automatic metrics: 1) ROUGE-N, which is based on n-grams, 2) ROUGE-L, which is based on Longest Common Subsequence, 3) ROUGE-W, which is based on Weighted Longest Common Subsequence and 4) ROUGE-S, which measures the overlap of skip-bigrams between a generated summary and a reference summary.\n• F-measure is borrowed from statistics and is based on precision and recall (Olson and Delen, 2008). This measure has been used to evaluate the content selection in data-to-text systems, e.g. (Angeli et al., 2010; Gkatzia et al., 2014a).\nAnother way of intrinsic evaluation is humanassessed evaluation, where humans evaluate the generated output in terms of similarity to a reference summary/translation (Belz and Hastie, 2014) as described in (Belz and Kow, 2010). In humanaided Machine Translation, post-editing is used to improve the output after machine translation and thus the generated output can be evaluated (Hutchins and Somers, 1992). This metric has been used for natural language generation too, as for instance in (Sripada et al., 2005).\nAutomatic metrics are regarded as “backup” metrics and they are used with human evaluations. They are not standalone metrics and their results are not always correlated with human evaluations (Belz and Reiter, 2006). The results of a human evaluation are more important, because what really matters is the usability of a system."

For this evaluation, users are asked questions such as “How useful did you find the summary?” (Belz and Hastie, 2014). This kind of method is used in (Walker et al., 2002) and (Foster and Oberlander, 2007), where an adaptive system is compared to a nonadaptive. The benefit of this method is that it can performed very quickly and easily in contrast with extrinsic methods which normally require a carefully designed setup."

Such an evaluation is applied to STOP system (Reiter et al., 1999) in order to find out whether the purpose of the system was achieved, i.e. to define whether users quit smoking. Although system purpose success measures is extremely important, it is an expensive and time consuming task. In addition, it is vague whether the system is solely successful or whether there are external factors that influence the outcome. If we consider the STOP project, there is uncertainty of whether someone quitted smoking because of the generated letter or due to other circumstances (such as health issues).\nExtrinsic methods are more powerful in indicating whether a data-to-text systems will be successful and whether the users will get “added value”. Because of the complex nature of these evaluation setups, evaluators should be very careful when designing measure task success and system purpose success experiments, and they should try to restrict the impact of confounding variables. Gkatzia and Mahamood (Gkatzia and Mahamood, 2015) provide an overview of the evaluation practices used in the field over the past decade."

      "heading" : "8 Conclusions",
      "text" : "This article reported the two main approaches to content selection for data-to-text generation: rulebased approaches and trainable approaches. It introduced content selection in other domains and it reviewed adaptive NLG systems. Finally, it discussed evaluation metrics and their suitability.\nBoth rule-based and trainable approaches provide benefits and suffer from limitations as we will discuss in the following paragraphs and as it is\ndepicted in Table 4. Regarding content selection, rule-based systems based on crafted rules, corpus analysis and expert consultations (Knowledge Acquisition from experts) are more robust and widely used in industry. In addition, the output produced by rule-based systems is more understandable by humans, with no funny elements as it is fully controlled. These systems can also account for outliers as long as rules have been provided to handle extreme examples of data. However, they may not be able to cover all distinct rules as the number of rules increases analogously to the complexity of the domain. In addition, the cost of developing and maintaining such a system is high comparing to systems that use data-driven approaches, as these systems can be scalable by providing more rules. In addition, rules are domain specific and therefore not transferable to other domains.\nStatistical methods and Machine Learning approaches, have been widely used and adopted for NLG in spoken dialogue systems as compared to data-to-text systems. With statistical methods (SM), NLG systems have the potential to be more domain independent, automatically optimised and generalised (Angeli et al., 2010; Dethlefs and Cuayahuitl, 2011; Rieser et al., 2010). Content selection rules learnt from data corpora can be more efficient, easily ported in new applications and cheap. Due to their ability to take into account large corpora, their coverage can be extended by using more training examples. However, they do require large amounts of training data. Statistical methods can be more expressive than rule-based systems in many ways, linguistically and adaptively and offer scalability and flexibility. In addition, statistical approaches can be used without taking into account part of speech tagging, syntactic relations and lexical dependencies, because statistical methods could facilitate the learning of the sequence of the words through a corpus, without needing details about the grammar (as in machine translation). However, if not enough training examples are available, those methods can choose content that is not coherent. Also statistical methods do not require the acquisition of knowledge from experts who can be hard to recruit."

      "text" : "Explicating researchers’ assumptions and claims about why they think an approach might be suit-\nable (or not) for content selection enables us to spherically view the task and therefore recognise suitable and unsuitable approaches, given the task at hand. The following framework is intended to provide a set of core questions to aid NLG researchers and developers in this process:\n• Domain: Is it a large or a small domain?\n• Knowledge (either from data or experts): If it is a large domain, is an aligned dataset available? If yes, in what format is the data available? If not, can you easily crowdsource data? If it is a small domain, do you have access to expert knowledge?\n• Evaluation: What is the main purpose of the system? Can you design an evaluation which includes potential users?\nHaving a good understanding of the task (domain, available knowledge and evaluation) greatly helps make decisions on which approaches to use and how to evaluate them. This framework is applicable for not only content selection, but also other NLG tasks."

      "text" : "There are several open research questions for datato-text systems, which can be either specific to content selection or they can be researched jointly with surface realisation.\n• How to transfer approaches between domains or from one language to another? One potential direction can be the application of transfer learning approaches (Jialin Pan and Yang, 2010).\n• How can textual information better be combined with visual information to achieve better task and system purpose success? There is evidence that multi-modal systems which combine graphs with language are more effective in decision making than systems which use only graphs or only natural language (Gkatzia et al., 2016a). However, little is known on which type of data can be better communicated in a multi-modal way or as texts.\n• Can we develop approaches which handle uncertain data? A vast variety of data is uncertain, either because of its nature (e.g. stock\nmarket data or weather data) or because of its source (e.g. data from web). Data-to-text generation will be benefited from research on methods to handle this data and potentially from effectively communicating uncertainty."
