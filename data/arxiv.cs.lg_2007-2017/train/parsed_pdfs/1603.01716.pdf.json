      "text" : "Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning. In numerous application fields very complex data needs to be classified which is often a difficult task for a single machine learning classifier [1] [2]. There are tremendous amount of research on improving the classification performance in such cases. One highly investigated field for this problem is ensemble learning [3], where multiple prediction are fused the produce a more efficient classifica-\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier March 8, 2016\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n01 71\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 5\nM ar\ntion approach. One fundamental requirement for the creation of classifier ensembles is diversity among them [4], that is, the classifiers included in the ensemble need to complement each other to provide more generalization capabilities than a single learner. Bagging [5] uses randomly selected training subsets with possible overlap (bootstrapping [6]) to ensure diversity among the member of the ensemble. Other diversity creation techniques may involve disjoint random sampling (random subspace methods [7], for example, some variants of Random Forest algorithms [8]), while Adaboost [9] based techniques aims to increase the accuracy of a weak learner iteratively (boosting [10]) using targeted sampling: each iteration considers the misclassified instances of the training data to be more important, and drives the iteration process to include them in the current training set. Another approach to create diverse ensembles is ensemble selection [11], where diversity of classifiers trained on the same dataset is measured and an optimal subset is selected.\nA more comprehensive review on the above described techniques can be found in [12]. The relationship of classifier diversity and ensemble accuracy is highly investigated in the ensemble learning community. Although the definite connection between diversity measures and ensemble accuracy is an open question [13], a decomposition of majority voting error into good and bad diversity is proposed in [14].\nIn this paper, a novel approach for ensemble creation based on this theoretical result is presented. The proposed approach takes the predictions of a single classifier on a training set. Then, an optimal labelling complimenting the predictions of the classifiers are created. Thus, an optimal but false labelling set is created for a number of classifiers. The data with each\nfalse labelling is trained to a classifier thus forming an ensemble. We define a Markov Random Field problem to create an optimal ensemble with this method. The approach has been tested on high-dimensional biomedical datasets where a large improvement over a single learner is achieved. Other aspects of the algorithm including its performance comparison with different number of ensemble members is also discussed. The outline of the proposed algorithm can be seen in Figure 1.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 contains the mathematical background behind the proposed method, while section 3 defines an\noptimization problem to solve it and proposes an implementation for it. Section 4 contains our experimental details, while the results are presented and discussed in section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in section 6."

In this section, the mathematical background behind the algorithm is presented. Moreover, an optimization problem is defined to provide an efficient solution for the false labelling problem.

HMRF is a powerful framework for\nsolving large-scale optimization problems, since there are multiple methods for solving HMRF problems near optimally in normal time, which would be a challenging task to find exact false labellings for real-life applications.\nIn this section, we briefly summarize the basis for Hidden Markov Random\nField (HMRF) optimization based on [15]. Let\nAk/2,L−1 = ai,j =  ωf1,1 ω f 1,2 · · · ω f 1,k/2 ωf2,1 ω f 2,2 · · · ω f 2,k/2 ... ... . . . ...\nωfL−1,1 ω f L−1,2 · · · ω f L−1,k/2  be a matrix containing a false labelling setup and Corig = bi,j a vector containing the labellings of Dorig and Ctraining = ci,j the labels assigned originally the training instances. All ai,j is a variable which can contain a possible label and at the end of the optimization process, each row contain a false labelling for a classifier Di.\nLet Λ = {0, 1} be a set of labels. Then, we assign each ai,j, i = 1, . . . , k/2j =\n1, . . . , L− 1 a label ωij . Let X be a labelling field. X is a Markov Random Field if P (X = ω), for all ω ∈ Λ and P ( ωai,j |ωak,l , ai,j 6= ik ) = P ( ωai,j |ωak,l , ak,l ∈ Nai,j ) , where Nai,j is a neighbourhood of ai,j.\nThe optimal labelling for the A variables with the HMRF optimization, one can use the the Hammersley-Clifford Theorem [16] to calculate the global energy for a labelling by summarizing the local energies for each variable. That is, during the optimization process, the global energy would be a function of the changes in the states of the ai,j variables.\nWe define the following three neighbourhoods for the optimization pro-\ncess:\nN1ai,j = {am,j|m ∈ {1, k/2},m 6= i} ∪ {bi}, (13)\nand a neighbourhood of a single variable containing the labelling for all of the feature vectors for the same classifier\nN2ai,j = {ai,l|l ∈ {1, L− 1}, l 6= j} ∪ {bi}, (14)\nwhich is a neighbourhood of a single variable containing the labelling of the other classifiers for the same feature vector, and\nN3ai,j = {ak,l|k ∈ {i− q, i+ q}, l ∈ {j − q, j + q}}, (15)\nwhich is a neighbourhood of a variable containing labelling of its close classifiers for inputs in a q · q part of A. First, we consider the individual classification error the individual classifiers:\nUind (ai,j) =\n∑ {ak,l|ak,l ∈ N1ai,j ∧ ak,l = ωi}\nk/2 , (16)\nwhere ωi is the actual label assigned to the feature vector in the training set. Out next criteria for the optimization process is to give a labelling, where the number of correct votes is exactly 50%+1 in all cases. Let\no = L/2 + 1.\nThen, we define the function Evotes in the following way:\nUgood (ai,j) =\n∑ {ak,l|ak,l ∈ N2ai,j ∧ ak,l = bi} − o\no . (17)\nThat is, we sum the correct labellings for a given input and subtracting the optimal number of votes from it. In this way, the Evotes will be minimal if\nthe number of correct votes is less than or equal to the number of optimal votes. Thus, we maximize the disagreement for bad diversity and minimize to good diversity [14]. To ensure classification accuracy (and avoid having lower numbers of votes resulting from negative values of Evotes), we also define\nUbad (ai,j) = − ∑ {ak,l|ak,l ∈ N3ai,j} ∧ {ak,l 6= bi} − o\no , (18)\nwhich is the disagreement term for bad diversity.\nFinally, we must ensure that the votes are unevenly distributed among\nthe classifiers to have less correlation between variables:\nUsmoothness (ai,j) = β ifai,j = ak,l−β otherwise. , (19) for all ak,l ∈ N2ai,j . In this way we ensure low correlation between the label sets assigned to the classifiers. In summary, the global energy U is the following:\nU = k/2∑ i=0 L−1∑ j=0 Eind (ai,j) + Egood (ai,j) + Ebad (ai,j) +\nEsmoothness (ai,j) .\n(20)\nThe optimization of the HMRF configuration can be done by optimizing U . Since simulated annealing [17], an efficient algorithm for finding approximate global solutions for large state-spaces.\nIn summary, simulated annealing measures energy values from different states of the variables. Each state is accepted as a better solution if provided a more optimal energy value or accepted by a function, which uses a random number to decide it. This step is important in avoiding stuck in local optima, as do other stochastic approaches like stochastic gradient search. The algorithm for simulated annealing can be found in algorithm 2.\nAlgorithm 2 Solving the optimization problem with simulated annealing.

The description of the datasets including the number of instances, the number of features per instance and the status of the patient by disease is summarized in Table 1. As it can be seen, the datasets contain a large number of features for a small number of instances thus making it challenging classification problems. Thus, the datasets are bootstrapped for training to ensure the number of instances per class are similar for better comparison of the methods.\nThe datasets were splitted into two equal partitions randomly 10 times to have a fair comparison. The false-labelling ensembles are tested with 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 members with Naive Bayes [19] base classifiers for each problem. The implementation of the classifiers was done using Weka [20]. To measure the accuracy of the ensembles, the classification accuracy of each cross-validation round is measured and their mean and standard deviation is calculated. For a comparison, we also show the results for a Naive Bayes classifier, which serves base classifiers in the ensembles, and three state-of-the-art ensemble approaches, namely Adaboost, Bagging and Random Forest.\nT ab\nle 1 :\nD es\ncr ip\nti o n\no f\nth e\nd a ta\nse ts\nD at\nas et\nN u\nm b\ner of\nIn st\na n\nce s\nN u m\nb er\no f\nF ea\ntu re\ns D\nis ea\nse\nb re\nas tC\nan ce\nrtr\nai n\n73 2 4 4 8 1\nB re\na st\nca n\nce r.\nb re\nas tC\nan ce\nrte\nst 19\n2 4 4 8 1\nce n tr\nal N\ner vo\nu sS\ny st\nem 60\n7 1 2 9\nC en\ntr a l\nn er\nvo u\ns sy\nst em\nem b\nry o n\na l\ntu m\no r.\nco lo\nn T\nu m\nor 62\n2 0 0 0\nC o lo\nn tu\nm o r.\nD L\nB C\nL -S\nta n\nfo rd\n47 4 0 2 6\nD iff\nu se\nla rg\ne B\n-c el\nl ly\nm p\nh o m\na\nD L\nB C\nL O\nu tc\nom e\n58 6 8 1 7\nD L\nB C\nL T\nu m\nor 77\n6 8 1 7\nD L\nB C\nL -N\nIH -t\nra in\n16 0\n7 3 9 9\nD L\nB C\nL -N\nIH -t\nes t\n80 7 3 9 9\nO C\n0- 9\n21 6\n3 7 3 4 0\nO va\nri a n\nca n\nce r\np ro\nst at\netu\nm or\nV S\nN or\nm al\n-t ra\nin 10\n2 1 2 6 0 0\nP ro\nst a te\nca n\nce r\np ro\nst at\netu\nm or\nV S\nN or\nm al\n-t es\nt 33\n1 2 6 0 0\np ro\nst at\neou\ntc om\ne 21\n1 2 6 0 0"

      "text" : "The validity of the optimization technique can be seen in Figures 2(a) and 2(b). As it can be seen in this example, the accuracy of the ensemble has increased steadily through iteration converging to an accuracy of 1, while the correlation of the labels of the ensemble members has been decreased at the same time. Figure 2(c) shows the optimization time through iterations. As it can be seen, in earlier iterations, the optimization procedure increases the energy function with less changes in the labelling spending less time, while in later iterations most of the combinations needs to be tested to increase energy, which require more time.\nThe mean accuracy and their standard deviations on the datasets for the ensembles can be found in table 2. Each column contains the classification accuracy of the respective ensembles Di, i ∈ {3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}. The results for the Naive Bayes, Adaboost, Bagging and Random Forest classifiers can be found in table 3. The values in bold for each dataset contain the best performing method. As it can be seen, for each dataset, the proposed approach provides the best values. However, the number of ensembles members varies among the best results. To have a deeper insight on the choice of optimal ensemble size, each investigated ensemble is compared to the best performing among the Naive Bayes, Adaboost, Bagging and Random Forest classifiers. Figures 4-10 show the difference between the respective ensemble and the best performing other method, where each positive value means that the respective ensemble performed better than the best among the other classifiers, while a negative value shows otherwise. As it can be seen, only the ensembles with 5 and 9 members remain above the other methods all\nthe time. From table 4 we can see that the sum of the all differences are the highest for the D5 ensemble. That is, based on these experiments, a false labelling ensemble with 5 member can be recommended to generate.\nStatistical analysis of the classifiers is also performed. First, Friedmantest [21] was performed to check whether the results of the proposed ensemble based classifiers, the Naive Bayes, Adaboost, Bagging and Random Forest are from the same distribution. This hypothesis was rejected with p = 3.8499e-026. Then, we applied post-hoc analysis to reveal the differences among the investigated classifiers. To recognize these differences, Tukey’s multiple comparison test [22] is also performed. The test revealed that the proposed ensembles consisting of 5-15 member (D5, . . . , D15) were all significantly different from the four classifiers they were compared to, while D3 were significantly different from all but Adaboost. The Friedman ranking also revealed D5 to be the best performing classifier among the investigated ones. For a visual representation of the Tukey test, see Figure 3, where a confidence interval for the sample mean differences are shown."

The presented approach is the first ensemble creation algorithm which creates diversity among classifiers using an artificially created labelling, a technique which can hopefully reused to create more robust algorithms in problems where individual classifier accuracy can be very varying. In the future, the ensemble creation method could be extended to handle unbalanced or multiclass classification problems efficiently."

While other ensemble creation techniques are based on careful selection of existing classifiers or preprocessing of the data, the presented approach automatically creates an optimal labelling for a number of classifiers, which are then assigned to the original data instances and fed to classifiers. The approach has been evaluated on high-dimensional biomedical datasets. The results show that the approach outperformed individual approaches in all cases.",
