      "text" : "While dealing with multimodal stimuli in order to perceive the surrounding environment and to understand the world is natural for human beings, it is not the case for artificial intelligence systems where an efficient integration of multimodal and/or multilingual information still remains a challenging task. Once tractable, this grounding of multiple modalities against each other may enable a more natural language interaction with computers.\nRecently, deep neural networks (DNN) achieved state-of-the-art results in numerous tasks of computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing (LeCun et al., 2015) where the input signals are monomodal i.e. image/video, characters/words/phrases, audio signal. With these successes in mind, researchers now attempt to design systems that will benefit from the fusion of several modalities in order to reach a wider generalization ability.\nMachine translation (MT) is another field where purely neural approaches (NMT) (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014) challenge the classical phrase-based approach (Koehn et al., 2003). This has been possible by formulating the translation problem as a sequence-to-sequence paradigm where a DNN may read and produce text in discrete steps with special recurrent building blocks that can model long range dependencies.\nAnother straightforward application of this paradigm is to incorporate DNNs into the task of generating natural language descriptions from images, a task commonly referred as image captioning. A number of approaches proposed by Karpathy and Fei-Fei (2015) ,Vinyals et al. (2015), Xu et al. (2015), You et al. (2016) have achieved state-of-the-art results on popular image captioning datasets Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014) and MSCOCO (Lin et al., 2014).\nIn this paper, we propose a multimodal architecture that is able to attend to multiple input modalities and we realize an extrinsic analysis of this specific attention mechanism. Furthermore, we attempt to determine the optimal way of attending to multiple input modalities in the context of image captioning. Although several attempts have been made to incorporate features from different languages (multi-source/multi-target) or different tasks to improve the performance (Elliott et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a; Firat et al., 2016), according to our knowledge, there has not been any attentional neural translation or captioning approach trained using an auxiliary source modality.\nThe architecture that we introduce for achieving multimodal learning can either be seen as an NMT enriched with convolutional image features as auxiliary source representation or an image captioning\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n03 97\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n3 Se\np 20\n16\nsystem producing image descriptions in a language T, supported with source descriptions in another language S. The modality specific pathways of the proposed architecture are inspired from two previously published approaches (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015) where an attention mechanism is learned to focus on different parts of the input sentence. Such integration implies a careful design of the underlying blocks: many strategies are considered in order to correctly attend to multiple input modalities. Along this line, different possibilities are also assessed for taking into account multimodal information during the decoding process of target words.\nWe compare the proposed architecture against single modality baseline systems using the recently published Multi30k multilingual image captioning dataset (Elliott et al., 2016). The empirical results show that we obtain better captioning performance in terms of different evaluation metrics when compared to baselines. We further provide an analysis of the descriptions and the multimodal attention mechanism to examine the impact of the multimodality on the quality of generated descriptions and the attention."

(2014) and Bahdanau et al. (2014) to achieve competitive results compared to state-of-the-art phrase-based method (Koehn et al., 2003). The dominant approaches in NMT differ in the way of representing the source sentence: Sutskever et al. (2014) and Cho et al. (2014) used the last hidden state of the encoder as a fixed size source sentence representation while Bahdanau et al. (2014) introduced an attention mechanism where a set of attentional weights are assigned to the recurrent hidden states of the encoder to obtain a weighted sum of the states instead of just taking the last. The idea of attention still continues to be an active area of research in the NMT community (Luong et al., 2015b)."

      "text" : "End-to-end neural image description models are basically recurrent language models conditioned in different ways on image features. These image features are generally extracted from powerful state-of-theart CNN architectures trained on large scale image classification tasks like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). Mao et al. (2015), Karpathy and Fei-Fei (2015), Vinyals et al. (2015) proposed a multimodal RNN which differs in the selection and integration of image features: Mao et al. (2015) made use of a multimodal layer which fuses image features, current word embedding and current hidden state of the RNN into a common multimodal space. The image features experimented by the authors are extracted from two different CNNs namely AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and VGG (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014). Karpathy and Fei-Fei (2015) takes a simpler approach and used a vanilla RNN that incorporates VGG image features only at the first time step as a bias term. Finally Vinyals et al. (2015) trained an ensemble of LSTM in which the image features extracted from a batch-normalized GoogLeNet (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) are presented to the LSTM sentence generator as the first input, before the special start word.\nDifferent from the previously cited works, Xu et al. (2015) applied the attention mechanism over convolutional image features of size 14x14x512 extracted from VGG, which makes the image context a collection of feature maps instead of a single vector. During training, an LSTM network jointly learns to generate an image description while selectively attending to the presented image features. This model is similar to the attentional NMT introduced by Bahdanau et al. (2014) except that the source word annotations produced by the encoder are replaced by the convolutional features.\nAnother attention based model proposed by You et al. (2016) introduced two separate attention mechanisms, input and output attention models, that are applied over a set of visual attributes detected using different methods like k-NN and neural networks. The image representation extracted from GoogLeNet\n(Szegedy et al., 2015) is only used as the initial input to the RNN. The authors use an ensemble of 5 differently initialized models as their final system.\nIn the context of multimodality, Elliott et al. (2015) explore the effectiveness of conditioning a target language model on the image features from the last fully-connected layer of VGG and on the features from a source language model using the IAPR-TC12 multilingual image captioning dataset."

CGRU consists of two stacked GRU activations that we will name g1 and g2 respectively. We experimented with several ways of initializing the hidden state of the decoder and found out that the model performs better when h(1)0 is learned from the mean textual annotation using a feed-forward layer with tanh nonlinearity. The hidden state h(2) of g2 is initialized with h (1) 1 :\nh (1) 0 = tanh ( W Tinit ( 1\nN N∑ i=1 atxti\n) + binit ) , h (2) 0 = h (1) 1 (4)\nAt each time step, a multimodal attention mechanism (detailed in Section 4) computes two modality specific context vectors {ctxtt , cimt } given the hidden state of the first GRU h (1) t and the textual/visual annotations {Atxt, Aim}. The multimodal context vector ct is then obtained by applying a tanh nonlinearity over a fusion of these modality specific context vectors.

      "text" : "In the context of multi-way multilingual NMT, Firat et al. (2016) benefit from a single attention mechanism shared across different language pairs. Although this may be reasonable within a multilingual task where all inputs and outputs are solely based on textual representations, this may not be the optimal approach when the modalities are completely different.\nIn order to verify the above statement, we consider different schemes for integrating the attention mechanism into multimodal learning. First, a shared feed-forward network is used to produce modalityspecific attention weights {αtxtt , αimt }:\nαtxtt = softmax ( UA tanh(WD h (1) t +WC A txt) )\n(9) αimt = softmax ( UA tanh(WD h (1) t +WC A im) ) (10)\n1github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-tutorial/blob/master/docs/cgru.pdf\nWe call this basic approach where linear transformations {WC , UA} from contexts to attentional weights are all shared, the encoder-independent attention (Figure 2A). An encoder-dependent attention in contrast, has distinct {WC , UA} for each modality which means that they are projected differently (Figure 2B).\nIt should be noted that both mechanisms depicted above still have a common projection layer WD applied to the hidden state h(1)t of the first GRU. In order to objectively assess the impact of modalitydependency on the decoder side, we also need to consider the two cases where a shared WD or distinct {W txtD ,W imD } transformations are used in the projection layer (Figure 2C and 2D). These two variants will be respectively referred as independent and dependent decoder state projection in the rest of the paper.\nTo sum up, we propose four variants of the multimodal attention mechanism in terms of modality dependency with respect to encoder and decoder. While encoder-independent attention with dependent decoder state projection (Figure 2C) might seem unnatural for this single target task, it may be interesting as a contrastive system.\nOnce the attentional weights {αtxtt , αimt } are computed, the modality-specific context vectors are defined as the weighted sum of each annotation set with its relevant α:\nctxtt = N∑ i=1 αtxtti a txt i , c im t = 196∑ j=1 αimtj a im j (11)\nThese vectors are then merged into a multimodal context vector that will be used in the target word generation (see equations 6, 8 in Section 3)."

It should be emphasized that the provided bilingual descriptions are not direct translations but could be considered somewhat comparable.\nThe training, validation and test set consist of 29000, 1014 and 1000 images respectively each having 5 English and 5 German annotations. A total of 25 sentence pairs can be obtained by taking the cross\nproduct of these annotations leading to a training set of 725K samples.

We only kept sentence pairs with sentence lengths ∈ [3, 50] having a length ratio of at most 3. This results in a final training dataset of 131K sentences (Table 1). We picked the most frequent 10K German words and replaced the rest with an UNK token for the target side.\nFor the image part, convolutional image features of size 14x14x2014 are extracted from the res4f relu layer of ResNet-50 CNN (He et al., 2016) trained on ImageNet.

The baselines have exactly the same architecture presented throughout this work but with only a single source modality.

We used Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) as the stochastic gradient descent variant with a minibatch size of 32. The weights of the networks are initialized using Xavier scheme (Glorot and Bengio, 2010) while the biases are initially set to 0. L2 regularization with λ = 0.00001 is applied to the training cost to avoid overfitting.\nThe performance of the networks is evaluated on the first validation split using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) at the end of each epoch and the training is stopped if BLEU does not improve for 20 evaluation periods.\nA classical left to right beam-search with a beam size of 12 is used for sentence generation during test time. Besides evaluating performance on the first validation split, we also experimented with a best source selection strategy where for each image we obtain 5 German hypotheses that correspond to 5 English descriptions and pick the one with the highest log-likelihood and the least number of UNK tokens."

The results are slightly worse than the NMT baseline regardless of the multimodal attention type when the fusion is realized with the SUM operator. This difference can be attributed to the fact that concatenation makes use of a linear layer that learns how to integrate the modality-specific activations into the multimodal context vector.\nThe improvement in terms of the automatic metrics is more significant with the best source selection strategy compared to the first validation split. The reason for this is that the first split contains source sentences which are much longer and detailed than the target ones: 18.35 words/sentence in average on the source side compared to 8.03 words/sentence on the target side. Once we use the best source selection method, the models compensate for this discrepancy by choosing source sentences of different lengths (in average ∼13 words/sentence).\nWe observe that a completely independent (shared) attention mechanism (MNMT5) has the worst performance among all CONCAT variants. This empirical evidence is on par with our initial statement that a single shared attention may not be the optimal approach in the case of different input modalities. We also notice that once a dependency be it on the encoder or the decoder side is established in the topology, the performance improves compared to the NMT baseline and MNMT5. The results obtained by MNMT6 that we previously conjectured as unnatural (see Section 4) also confirm this."

      "heading" : "6.2 Qualitative Analysis",
      "text" : "In Table 3 we present German descriptions generated by the NMT baseline and the best performing MNMT model using the same source description from the first validation split. In the first image, MNMT clearly produces a richer description where it provides additional visual information like the color and the type of clothing and also the positioning of the woman. In the second case, MNMT again generates a coherent and rich description but ignores the pink laptop bag that is mentioned in the NMT output. Lastly, third image shows a situation where NMT wrongly describes the color of an object while MNMT does its job correctly although METEOR penalizes it, a phenomenon observed when the references contain\nless detail than the hypotheses. One advantage of the attention mechanism is the ability to visualize where exactly the network pays attention. Although the visualization over the textual context is trivial to apply, inferring the spatial region in the original image that is attended by the model is not. Here we adopt the approach proposed by Xu et al. (2015) which upsamples the attention weights with a factor of 16 in order to lay them over the original image as white smoothed regions. We compare the multimodal attention between completely independent MNMT5 and encoder-dependent MNMT7 in Figure 3.\nAlthough both models achieve a comparable attention pattern over the image regions, textual alignment is completely disturbed (for all examples) in MNMT5. The failure of the shared attention which contrasts with Firat et al. (2016) can be attributed to a representational discrepancy between convolutional image features and the source side textual annotations. Moreover, the number of visual annotations for a single image (196) is ∼15 times higher than the number of textual annotations (with 13 words/sentence in average) which may bias the joint attention towards the visual side during the learning stage."

By quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing different attention schemes, we demonstrated that modality-dependent MNMT outperforms the textual NMT baseline by up to 1 BLEU/METEOR and 2.5 CIDEr-D points. The difference is even more significant with the best source selection strategy, where we reach a gain of almost 1.6 BLEU/METEOR and 4.2 CIDEr-D points. We further visualize multimodal attention and show that modality-dependent attention mechanism is able to learn an alignment over both the source words and the image features but this is not the case for shared attention where textual alignment is completely disturbed.\nAs future work, fine-tuning the extracted image features with a learnable convolutional layer inside MNMT and/or extracting image features based on source language description are interesting paths to explore in order to gain more insight about multimodality."

The image features experimented by the authors are extracted from two different CNNs namely AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and VGG (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014). Karpathy and Fei-Fei (2015) takes a simpler approach and used a vanilla RNN that incorporates VGG image features only at the first time step as a bias term. Finally Vinyals et al. (2015) trained an ensemble of LSTM in which the image features extracted from a batch-normalized GoogLeNet (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) are presented to the LSTM sentence generator as the first input, before the special start word. Different from the previously cited works, Xu et al. (2015) applied the attention mechanism over convolutional image features of size 14x14x512 extracted from VGG, which makes the image context a collection of feature maps instead of a single vector.",

Recently, the effectiveness of attention has also been explored in the context of image captioning. In this work, we assess the feasibility of a multimodal attention mechanism that simultaneously focus over an image and its natural language description for generating a description in another language. We train several variants of our proposed attention mechanism on the Multi30k multilingual image captioning dataset. We show that a dedicated attention for each modality achieves up to 1.6 points in BLEU and METEOR compared to a textual NMT baseline.",
