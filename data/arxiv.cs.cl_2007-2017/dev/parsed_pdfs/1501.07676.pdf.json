User’s decisions on software acquisitions are often ad hoc or based on preference due to difficulty in quantitatively measure software quality-in-use. However, why qualityin-use measurement is difficult? Although there are many software quality models to our knowledge, no works surveys the challenges related to software quality-in-use measurement. This paper has two main contributions; 1) presents major issues and challenges in measuring software quality-in-use in the context of the ISO SQuaRE series and related software quality models, 2) Presents a novel framework that can be used to predict software quality-in-use, and 3) presents preliminary results of quality-in-use topic prediction. Concisely, the issues are related to the complexity of the current standard models and the limitations and incompleteness of the customized software quality models. The proposed framework employs sentiment analysis techniques to predict software quality-in-use.\nKeywords: Software Quality-in-use; ISO 25010; SQUARE series; Sentiment analysis; Quality Measurement"

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "With thousands of software published online, it is essential for users to find the software that matches their stated or implied needs. Users often seek better software quality. Garvin [1] identified five views/approaches of quality. The nearest definition in this paper is the user based approach definition “meeting customer needs”. If the customer is satisfied, then product or service has good quality. It has been implemented in mobile-based applications[2]–[4] and Web applications[5]–[7].\nSoftware quality can be conceptualized from three\ndimensions; the quality characteristics, the quality model, and software quality requirements. A Quality characteristic is ”category of software quality attributes that bears on software quality” [8, p. 9]. Quality requirements are what the user needs in the software such as performance, user interface or security requirements. The quality model is how quality characteristics are related to each other and to the final product quality. Measuring the software quality will check if user requirements are met and decide the degree of quality.\nThe ISO/IEC 25010:2010 standard (ISO 25010\nhereafter), a part of a series known as the Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE), defines systems’ quality as “the degree to which the system satisfies the stated and implied needs of its various stakeholders, and thus provides value” [9, p. 8]. The ISO 25010 has two major dimensions: Quality-in-use (QinU) and Product Quality. The former specifies characteristics related to the human interaction with the system and the latter specifies characteristics intrinsic to the product. QinU is defined as “capability of a software product to influence users' effectiveness, productivity, safety and satisfaction to satisfy their actual needs when using the software product to achieve their goals in a specified context of use” [8, p. 17].The QinU model consists of five characteristics:\neffectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, freedom from risk and context coverage. Table 1 illustrates the definition of these characteristics."

On the other hand, customized quality models are subject to incomplete models that are designed for their own specific needs.\n Proposes a novel framework to predict software QinU from software reviews. Given the issues\nrelated to measuring QinU a framework is presented to resolve these issues. The framework is based on sentiment analysis, an emerging branch of Natural Language Processing.

      "heading" : "2.1 Standard Frameworks",
      "text" : "There have been many standards that can support software quality, but many of them are rather check list guide. For example, the ISO 9000 family has been criticized in literature not to be used for software [13]. The ANSI/IEEE 730-2002[14] support quality assurance plans. ISO/IEC 15504[15] or as it is known Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination (SPICE), is a set of technical standards documents for the computer software development process and related business management functions. These standards are not designed to address quality-in-use nor specific characteristics of software product quality.\nRecently, the Software Product Quality\nRequirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) ISO standard series are a result of blending the ISO/IEC 9126 and ISO/IEC 14598 series of standards. The purpose of the SQuaRE series of standards is to assist developing and\nacquiring software products with the specification of quality requirements and evaluation. From the viewpoint of the stakeholders the quality requirements are specified, the quality of the product is evaluated based on this specification utilizing chosen quality model, quality measurement and quality management process.\nTo measure QinU effectively, five divisions of the\nSQuaRE series have to be considered the ISO 2502n to ISO 25024 and in line with the ISO 25010 model as shown in Fig. 1. Technically and, more precisely, the QinU Measurement Standard ISO 25022 has to be considered in the context of four other standards: the Measurement Reference Model and Guide ISO 25020; the Measurement of Data Quality 25024, the Measurement of System and Software Product Quality ISO 25023, and Quality Measure Elements Standards ISO 25021. Fig. 2 depicts the relationship between the ISO/IEC 25022 and other ISO/IEC 2502n division of standards.\nWhile these standards provide the freedom of\ncustomization, they need careful quality assurance to provide apparent integration between related standards. They also suffer to detail how the customization need to be carried out."

Activity based models provide an interrelation between system properties and the activities carried out by the various stakeholders. Activity based models usually tracks development or testing activities rather than user activities .Famous hierarchical models are McCall’s Quality Model [16], Boehm’s Quality Model [17], Dromey’s Quality Model [18], and The Software Quality In Development (SQUID) approach [19]."

Exploiting ideas in COCOMO[20]the Constructive Quality Model [21], [22] (COQUAMO) helps project managers to manage, assess and predict product during the development lifecycle. Software Metrics Models are concerned with quality evaluation of a specific quality metric, quality assurance, or prediction. Many researchers have shown that these metrics are not certain indicators of faults[28], line code dependent [28] or programming dependent[29][30].Software Reliability Models target to measure the reliability of software systems based on failures intensity and software history profiles. Example of such models are [31], [32]. The application of these models to get quality-in-use is not feasible because the software will be in operation phase for users.

This means the user should be involved in the quality requirements specification which might not be applicable in all times. Other issues related to task measurement embraces the variety of tasks from one software function to another and from software to another. For example, a task to open a file for writing is different than a task of removing special characters from a text file. Worse on this, defining what are the tasks is by itself a major challenge. Hedonic tasks (the “be goals”) that imply user satisfaction cannot be specified, thus cannot be measured directly."

In cases where software is designed to be used by global users such as operating systems or antivirus software, then software publishers have to find other ways to collect user needs. However, it might be a disaster when users start using the software. Not because of software bugs, but because users are not satisfied. Users need to see software doing what they were thinking of without draining their mind with all the lifecycle of the software."

They contain many shortcomings. Consumers may not be satisfied with a product which meets these standards. Consumer requirements change from year to year and even frequently updated standards cannot keep the pace with consumer requirements\". These needs are usually resolved by building new software versions, however software might get complicated or buggy due to extra feature added that were not planned ahead. If users are involved ahead of time, these needs will be incorporated. Therefore, this problem returns us to the first and second unsolved issues above."

For example, to measure the effectiveness; task completion, task effectiveness and error frequency has to be calculated. Moreover, Integrating related quality processes of various standards (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) is a problem for quality engineers. The reason behind this problem is the need of experienced engineers given limited information in the standard models on how to customize them, especially for small sized companies. In an extension to the ISO 25010 Lew et al. [41] suggest adding data quality inside the ISO 25010 instead of being separate. Monitoring user actions or usage statistics to measure quality-in-use are not enough. A wide range of measuring methods needs an acceptable level of experts in each domain as shown in ISO 25022 standard."

The McCabe(1976) and Halstead(1977), are used since 1970’s while Chidamber& Kemerer metrics[26] triggers its use in 1994. These metrics depend on programming style objectoriented[26] versus procedure programming approaches[24], [25]. Moreover, results from COQUAMO model concluded that there were no software product metrics that were, in general, likely to be good predictors of final product qualities .Thus metrics used in measuring product quality cannot be utilized to measure quality-in-use directly."

It is obvious that, the average human reader will have difficulty accurately summarizing relevant information and identifying opinions\ncontained in reviews about a product. Moreover, human analysis of textual information is subject to considerable biases resulted from preferences and different understanding of written textual expressions. Therefore, opinion mining provided an alternative to identify important reviews and opinions to answer users’ queries[44], [45].\nDespite the difficulties of sentiment analysis\napproach[46], [47][48], it can be used to overcome issues discussed in Section 3. The sentiment analysis can seemingly work on user reviews without active user involvement. Moreover, by sentiment analysis the software trends can be analyzed and future software quality can be predicted.\nNext are the details of the framework."

      "heading" : "4.1 Proposed Quality-in-use Prediction Framework",
      "text" : "Fig. 3 shows a general framework to predict software Quality-in-use. We reemphasize that the purpose of this framework is to present a conceptual model to highlight high level details of the proposed framework. In this figure processes are marked by the letter p followed by process number and the input is marked by input1 and input2 respectively. The general idea of the framework is to utilize software reviews and ISO standard documents in order to process review text snippets into QinU characteristics.\nThe proposed framework has two inputs, the ISO\nQinU documents (input1) and the software reviews (input2). In this framework, the ISO documents have the quality-in-use description, modeling, specification and evaluation process components. These components will be used to 1) describe QinU for annotators, 2) to get the QinU characteristics, 3) to score QinU using formulas, and 4) to help validate the proposed model. The software reviews text is fed into a data preparation process (p1) in order to get a set of annotated/classified sentences that would be used as a gold standard.\nIn the data preparation process, first reviews are\ncrawled from software, websites such as Amazon and CNET. These reviews have a star rating from 1 to 5, where 1 stands for bad comment about the software and 5 stands for excellent comment. To balance the input data, for each star rating the top 10 reviews are selected for the next step. This process ensures that the input comments covers the whole star rating range of comments. Next, the reviews from the previous step are split into sentences using a combined automatic method and manual method to cover long sentences or sentences that are missing punctuated. Taking a sentence at a time and within the context of the review the annotator assigns a topic to the sentence. If the sentence is topic related, the annotator will assign the keyword that makes that sentence for a certain topic. For example the annotator might select the word fast from the sentence “this software is fast” as a keyword for the topic efficiency. Additionally the annotator will choose why a sentence is positive or negative by choosing an opinion, expression word and a modifier if available. Finally the classified sentences are saved in the database for the next step which is QinU extraction.\nThe core of this framework is the QinU extraction.\nIn this step it is proposed to use a sentence semantic similarity measure to map testing sentences into QinU characteristics (p2). In this step the sentences are classified into 3 topics; effectives, efficiency, and risk mitigation using a proposed sentence similarity. In the next step, each sentence is assigned a polarity by using data from the gold standard data set (p1). QinU is scored in process p4 by using linear combination of Qin Characteristics described in the ISO QinU Measurement Standard ISO 25022.\nTo evaluate the efficiency of the proposed sentence\nmeasure in process p2, it can be compared with other famous approaches. Several methods can be used for comparison. This paper chooses to compare with the below methods. The reason for choosing these methods is to have different measures from different spectrums. Li and google tri-grams [49] as sentence measures, Multinomial Naive Bayes text classification (NB) [50]–[52] and SVM[53] for text classification, LSA [54] for semantic space classification. These methods are evaluated in terms of standard classification performance measures: f-measure, accuracy and ROC analysis shown in process p6. In order to validate the framework a Use Case is built in p7 to validate the model."

These methods were able to detect a test sentence topic (illustrated in the P2 step of the Fig.3). The experiment was run on 3 fold cross validation.

The model depends on a manually built ontology of ISO 9126 “qualityin-use” keywords and Word Net 3.0 synonyms expansion. We consider the work of [10] the most nearby to this paper.\nThe difference from proposed work is that the proposed framework employs word similarity and relatedness rather than rule based classification and ontologies."

Quality-in-use can be measured using standard SQuaRE series while many characteristics of software quality-in-use are scattered in many customized software quality models. Measuring quality-in-use is challenging, due to the complexity of current standard models and the incompleteness of other related customized models. The viewpoint of the software users is hard to be implemented within the software lifecycle ahead of time especially for hedonic tasks. This paper proposes to process software reviews in order to get software quality-in-use. The framework employs sentence semantic relatedness to get a score for QinU characteristics."

It has gained its importance in e-learning applications, mobile service based applications and project management tools. User’s decisions on software acquisitions are often ad hoc or based on preference due to difficulty in quantitatively measure software quality-in-use. However, why qualityin-use measurement is difficult? Although there are many software quality models to our knowledge, no works surveys the challenges related to software quality-in-use measurement. This paper has two main contributions; 1) presents major issues and challenges in measuring software quality-in-use in the context of the ISO SQuaRE series and related software quality models, 2) Presents a novel framework that can be used to predict software quality-in-use, and 3) presents preliminary results of quality-in-use topic prediction. Concisely, the issues are related to the complexity of the current standard models and the limitations and incompleteness of the customized software quality models. The proposed framework employs sentiment analysis techniques to predict software quality-in-use.",
