To do this we test (query, learn) if X is before Y , if so we place it before Y to give the sequence XY , else we place it after Y resulting in Y X . Now, assume we have ordered i rules Y1 . . . Yi and we have to a new place rule X , Block suggests we test for each j if X < Yj, if so all we need do is to place X before Yj in our sequence Y1 . . . Yj . . . Yi to give Y1 . . .XYj . . . Yi. The reason we can do this is because the rules are linearly ordered and hence by transitivity we know X is less than all rules beyond Yj. Hence, we need test no further. If X is not less than Yj we continue until we find such a j. If we don’t find such a j, then we know that X is greater than all all the given rules and we place X at the end to give Y1 . . . YiX . Thus starting with one rule we gradually build up our knowledge about the order of the rules."

Rn it takes at most 1 + 2 + . . .+ i+ . . . + n steps. This worst case is how computer scientists measure the complexity of an algorithm.\nS(n) = n∑\ni=1\ni− 1 = n∑\ni=2\ni (1)\nWe subtract 1 (or equivalently start with 2) because the first rule does not have to be tested or compared. Thus, we have a measure of the complexity of Block’s algorithm in defined in terms of the number of queries or steps needed to order n rules."

      "text" : "ity\nThere is a simpler and shorter formula that eliminates the need to sum up the steps and thereby can easily be done on a calculator. It gives an exact characterization of the steps needed to order n rules:\nExact complexity of Block’s algorithm\nS(n) = (n2 − n)\n2 + n− 1 (2)\nSince, the exponent of 2 ultimately overpowers any addition or division by a constant, the complexity of Block’s algorithm is O(n2).\nFor example, for 27 rules it takes at most ∑ 27\ni=1 i = 27+26+ . . .+2 = 377 This is, of course, a very modest number when compared to the estimates of 27! = 1.08889x1028 steps by some linguists. For practical, purposes one would think this is enough and we should be satisfied with such an astounding reduction of steps needed to learn some 27 rules.\nHowever, if we increase the number of rules to hundreds, we quickly face numbers that may again seem insurmountable for the developing brain of a child. The method we present here improves on Blocks algorithm significantly since it is exponentially more efficient. As a result, even the ordering of thousands of rules can be learned relatively quickly.\nFor example, for one thousand rules, the number of steps required to determine the ordering of the rules using Block’s algorithm is 500, 499 steps. Below we will show that for this case we can improve this to less than 8, 977 steps which is about 55 times faster."

      "text" : "Block’s algorithm moves linearly from start to end to find and test if the rule is before or after the given rule. Instead we will adapt binary search to start at the middle of the sequence of rules and test the rule there. This will give us an exponential improvement over Block’s method."

      "text" : "Given n rules and a rule X that needs to be placed in its proper order, choose the middle rule, call it Y . This can be done since the rules are linearly ordered. Test to see if the rule is applied before Y if so test the middle rule between Y and the first rule, else test the middle rule between the end rule and rule Y . Repeat until done."

      "text" : "In effect we use binary search to find the proper place to insert our new rule Y given n rules. And, this process takes at most n logn steps. Hence, given we have n rules to insert into at most n rules, we have at most n log n steps to find the completely ordered sequence of n rules.\nActually, the process takes fewer steps. Since, work incrementally starting with n = 1, call this one rule Y and one rule X to insert we just have to make one test to see if X < Y or not. If it is less than Y we insert X before Y giving XY else we insert it after Y resulting in the partial sequence Y X . We then pick the next rule Z and insert it. Given a sequence of n rules we insert X at each stage according to the binary search algorithm above.\nHence, for n rules we require at most\nB(n) = ⌈log(n)⌉ + ⌈log(n− 1)⌉+ ⌈log(n− 2)⌉+ . . .+ ⌈log(n− (n− 1))⌉ (3)\nsteps to order them.\nNotation Throughout this article we use log to mean the logarithm base 2. The notation, ⌈α⌉ denotes the smallest integer i greater than or equal to the number α. The log of a number will in general not be an integer. This promotes a real (floating point) number to the next integer since we are counting steps in an algorithm and they are discrete.\nExpressed more succinctly we have:\nComplexity of the fast algorithm\nB(n) = n−1∑\ni=0\n⌈log(n− i)⌉ (4)\nNote, that B(n) < n logn. Thus, the complexity is less than O(nlogn)."

      "text" : "Looking at it from a different perspective, we can shorten the description of the complexity function by using factorial.\nn−1∑\ni=0\nlog(n− i) = log(n) + log(n− 1) + log(n− 2) + . . .+ log(n− (n− 1))\n= log(n(n− 1)(n− 2) . . . (n− (n− 1))) = log(n!)\nThus, we can get an approximation to the function B(n) in equation 4 using the following:\nBf (n) = ⌈log(n!)⌉ (5)\nHowever, this formulation has the disadvantage that the size of the factorial quickly expands to be computationally impractical. In addition, the result is not as accurate in that it underestimates the complexity because the log is used instead of ⌈log⌉ when log(n!) is calculated. If we add n to the result, giving log(n!)+n we get an overestimate. Thus,\nlog(n!) < B(n) < log(n!) + n (6)"

      "text" : "gorithms\nFor example, for 27 rules Block’s algorithm requires 377 steps. We need only 104 steps which is which is 3.6 times faster. However, since there is an exponential improvement using the fast algorithm, the differences become more dramatic the larger the number of rules that are to be ordered. For example, for 1, 000 rules, some linguists would tell us we need to search through 1000! possible combinations. Using Block’s algorithm, we need only 500, 499 steps, a much much smaller number. With our improved fast algorithm we need less than 8, 977 steps which is more than 55 times faster (smaller) in this case. So, for instance, if a child would learn to order two rules per day (into its given set of learned rules), it would take 685 years to learn the ordering of 1,000 rules using Block’s method. With our fast method it would take about 12 years.\nThere is the question to what extent such considerations are relevant to learning a language. The above presupposed that the rules are linearly ordered. That means each rule stands in a unique linear relationship to all the other rules. Partially ordered rules are yet another matter."
