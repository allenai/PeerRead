Our goal is to learn decision rules that adaptively select sensors for each example as necessary to make a confident prediction. We model our system as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where internal nodes correspond to sensor subsets and decision functions at each node choose whether to acquire a new sensor or classify using the available measurements. This problem can be naturally posed as an empirical risk minimization over training data. Rather than jointly optimizing such a highly coupled and non-convex problem over all decision nodes, we propose an efficient algorithm motivated by dynamic programming. We learn node policies in the DAG by reducing the global objective to a series of cost sensitive learning problems. Our approach is computationally efficient and has proven guarantees of convergence to the optimal system for a fixed architecture. In addition, we present an extension to map other budgeted learning problems with large number of sensors to our DAG architecture and demonstrate empirical performance exceeding state-of-the-art algorithms for data composed of both few and many sensors.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 19:40:10 GMT  (76kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07609v1", "To appear in NIPS 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in NIPS 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["joseph wang", "kirill trapeznikov", "venkatesh saligrama"], "accepted": true, "id": "1510.07609"}
