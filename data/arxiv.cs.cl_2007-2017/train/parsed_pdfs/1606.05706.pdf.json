      "text" : "We are in an era where people can easily voice and exchange their opinions on the internet through forums or social media. Mining public opinion and the social interactions from online discussions is an important task, which has a wide range of applications. For example, by analyzing the users’ attitude in forum posts on social and political problems, it is able to identify ideological stance (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) and user relations (Qiu et al., 2013), and thus further discover subgroups (Hassan et al., 2012; Abu-Jbara et al., 2012) with similar ideological viewpoint. Meanwhile, catching the sentiment in the conversation can help detect online disputes, reveal popular or controversial topics, and potentially disclose the public opinion formation process.\nIn this work, we study the problem of agreement and disagreement identification in online discussions. Sentence-level agreement and disagreement detection for this domain is challenging in its own right due to the dynamic nature of online conversations, and the less formal, and usually very emotional language used. As an example, consider a snippet of discussion from Wikipedia Talk page for article “Iraq War” where editors argue on the correctness of the information in the opening paragraph (Figure 1). “So what?” should presumably be tagged as a negative sentence as should the sentence “If you’re going to troll, do us all a favor and stick to the guidelines.”. We hypothesize that these, and other, examples will be difficult for the tagger unless the context surrounding each sentence is considered and in the absence of a sentiment lexicon tuned for conversational text (Ding et al., 2008; Choi and Cardie, 2009).\nAs a result, we investigate isotonic Conditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) (Mao and Lebanon, 2007) for the sentiment tagging task since they preserve the advantages of the popular CRF sequential tagging models (Lafferty et al., 2001) while providing an efficient mechanism to encode domain knowledge — in our case, a sentiment lexicon — through isotonic constraints on the model parameters. In particular, we bootstrap the construction of a sentiment lexicon from Wikipedia talk pages using the lexical items in existing general-purpose sentiment lexicons as seeds and in conjunction with an existing label propagation algorithm (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002).1\nTo summarize, our chief contributions include: (1) We propose an agreement and disagreement identification model based on isotonic Conditional Random Fields (Mao and Lebanon, 2007) to identify users’ attitude in online discussion. Our predictions that are made on the sentence-\n1Our online discussion lexicon (Section 4) will be made publicly available.\nor segment-level, are able to discover fine-grained sentiment flow within each turn, which can be further applied in other applications, such as dispute detection or argumentation structure analysis. We employ two existing online discussion data sets: the Authority and Alignment in Wikipedia Discussions (AAWD) corpus of Bender et al. (2011) (Wikipedia talk pages) and the Internet Argument Corpus (IAC) of Walker et al. (2012a). Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the AAWD data (our F1 scores are 0.74 and 0.67 for agreement and disagreement, vs. 0.58 and 0.56 for the linear chain CRF approach) and IAC data (our F1 scores are 0.61 and 0.78 for agreement and dis-\nagreement, vs. 0.28 and 0.73 for SVM). (2) Furthermore, we construct a new sentiment lexicon for online discussion. We show that the learned lexicon significantly improves performance over systems that use existing generalpurpose lexicons (i.e. MPQA lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), and SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)). Our lexicon is constructed from a very large-scale discussion corpus based on Wikipedia talk page, where previous work (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2010) for constructing online discussion lexicon relies on human annotations derived from limited number of conversations.\nIn the remainder of the paper, we describe first the related work (Section 2). Then we introduce the sentence-level agreement and disagreement identification model (Section 3) as well as the label propagation algorithm for lexicon construction (Section 4). After explain the experimental setup, we display the results and provide further analysis in Section 6."

      "text" : "Sentiment analysis has been utilized as a key enabling technique in a number of conversationbased applications. Previous work mainly studies the attitudes in spoken meetings (Galley et al., 2004; Hahn et al., 2006) or broadcast conversations (Wang et al., 2011) using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001). Galley et al. (2004) employ Conditional Markov models to detect if discussants reach at an agreement in spoken meetings. Each state in their model is an individual turn and prediction is made on the turnlevel. In the same spirit, Wang et al. (2011) also propose a sequential model based on CRF for detecting agreements and disagreements in broadcast conversations, where they primarily show the efficiency of prosodic features. While we also exploit a sequential model extended from CRFs, our predictions are made for each sentence or segment rather than at the turn-level. Moreover, we experiment with online discussion datasets that exhibit a more realistic distribution of disagreement vs. agreement, where much more disagreement is observed due to its function and the relation between the participants. This renders the detection problem more challenging.\nOnly recently, agreement and disagreement detection is studied for online discussion, especially\nfor online debate. Abbott et al. (2011) investigate different types of features based on dependency relations as well as manually-labeled features, such as if the participants are nice, nasty, or sarcastic, and respect or insult the target participants. Automatically inducing those features from human annotation are challenging itself, so it would be difficult to reproduce their work on new datasets. We use only automatically generated features. Using the same dataset, Misra and Walker (2013) study the effectiveness of topicindependent features, e.g. discourse cues indicating agreement or negative opinion. Those cues, which serve a similar purpose as a sentiment lexicon, are also constructed manually. In our work, we create an online discussion lexicon automatically and construct sentiment features based on the lexicon. Also targeting online debate, Yin et al. (2012) train a logistic regression classifier with features aggregating posts from the same participant to predict the sentiment for each individual post. This approach works only when the speaker has enough posts on each topic, which is not applicable to newcomers. Hassan et al. (2010) focus on predicting the attitude of participants towards each other. They relate the sentiment words to the second person pronoun, which produces strong baselines. We also adopt their baselines in our work. Although there are available datasets with (dis)agreement annotated on Wikipedia talk pages, we are not aware of any published work that utilizes these annotations. Dialogue act recognition on talk pages (Ferschke et al., 2012) might be the most related.\nWhile detecting agreement and disagreement in conversations is useful on its own, it is also a key component for related tasks, such as stance prediction (Thomas et al., 2006; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Walker et al., 2012b) and subgroup detection (Hassan et al., 2012; Abu-Jbara et al., 2012). For instance, Thomas et al. (2006) train an agreement detection classifier with Support Vector Machines on congressional floor-debate transcripts to determine whether the speeches represent support of or opposition to the proposed legislation. Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) design various sentiment constraints for inclusion in an integer linear programming framework for stance classification. For subgroup detection, Abu-Jbara et al. (2012) uses the polarity of the expressions in the discussions and partition discussants into sub-\ngroups based on the intuition that people in the same group should mostly agree with each other. Though those work highly relies on the component of agreement and disagreement detection, the evaluation is always performed on the ultimate application only."

Our model takes as input the text units x = {x1, · · · , xn} in the same turn, and outputs a sequence of sentiment labels y = {y1, · · · , yn}, where yi ∈ O,O = {NN,N,O,P,PP}. The labels in O represent strongly disagree (NN), disagree (N), neutral (O), agree (P), strongly agree (PP), respectively. In addition, elements in the partially ordered set O possess an ordinal relation ≤. Here, we differentiate agreement and disagreement with different intensity, because the output of our classifier can be used for other applications, such as dispute detection, where “strongly disagree” (e.g. NN) plays an important role. Meanwhile, fine-grained sentiment labels potentially provide richer context information for the sequential model employed for this task."

      "text" : "Conditional Random Fields (CRF) have been successfully applied in numerous sequential labeling tasks (Lafferty et al., 2001). Given a sequence of utterances or segments x = {x1, · · · , xn}, according to linear-chain CRF, the probability of the labels y for x is given by:\np(y|x) = 1\nZ(x) exp(\n∑\ni\n∑\nσ,τ\nλ〈σ,τ〉f〈σ,τ〉(yi−1, yi)\n+ ∑\ni\n∑\nσ,w\nµ〈σ,w〉g〈σ,w〉(yi, xi))\n(1)\nf〈σ,τ〉(yi−1, yi) and g〈σ,w〉(yi, xi) are feature functions. Given that yi−1, yi, xi take values of σ, τ, w, the functions are indexed by pairs 〈σ, τ〉 and 〈σ,w〉. λ〈σ,τ〉, µ〈σ,w〉 are the parameters.\nCRF, as defined above, is not appropriate for ordinal data like sentiment, because it ignores the ordinal relation among sentiment labels. Isotonic Conditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) are proposed by Mao and Lebanon (2007) to enforce a set of monotonicity constraints on the parameters that are consistent with the ordinal structure and domain knowledge (in our case, a sentiment lexicon automatically constructed from online discussions).\nGiven a lexicon M = Mp ∪ Mn, where Mp and Mn are two sets of features (usually words) identified as strongly associated with positive sentiment and negative sentiment. The constraints are encoded as below. For each feature w ∈ Mp, isotonic CRF enforces σ ≤ σ′ ⇒ µ〈σ,w〉 ≤ µ〈σ′,w〉. Intuitively, the parameters µ〈σ,w〉 are intimately tied to the model probabilities. When a feature such as “totally agree” is observed in the training data, the feature parameter for µ〈PP,totally agree〉 is likely to increase. Similar constraints are also defined on Mn. In this work, we boostrap the construction of an online discussion sentiment lexicon used as M in the isotonic CRF (see Section 4).\nThe parameters can be found by maximizing the likelihood subject to the monotonicity constraints. We adopt the re-parameterization from Mao and Lebanon (2007) for a simpler optimization problem, and refer the readers to Mao and Lebanon (2007) for more details.2"

For instance, “nsubj(wrong, you)” is generlized as the “nsubj(ADJ, you)” and “nsubj(wrong, PRP)”. We use Stanford parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006) to obtain parse trees and dependency relations.\nDiscourse Features. Previous work (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Abbott et al., 2011) suggests that discourse markers, such as what?, actually, may have their use for expressing opinions. We extract the initial unigram, bigram, and trigram of each utterance as discourse features (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993). Hedge words are collected from the CoNLL-2012 shared task (Farkas et al., 2010).\nConversation Features. Conversation features encode some useful information regarding the similarity between the current utterance(s) and the sentences uttered by the target participant. TFIDF similarity is computed. We also check if the current utterance(s) quotes target sentences and compute its length.\nSentiment Features. We gather connectives from Penn Discourse TreeBank (Rashmi Prasad and Webber, 2008) and combine them with any sentiment word that precedes or follows it as new features. Sentiment dependency relations are the subset of dependency relations with sentiment words. We replace those words with their polarity equivalents. For example, relation “nsubj(wrong, you)” becomes “nsubj(SentiWordneg, you)”."

      "text" : "Node Set V . Traditional lexicons, like General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), usually consist of polarized unigrams. As we mentioned in Section 1, unigrams lack the capability of capturing the sentiment conveyed in online discussions. Instead, bigrams, dependency relations, and even punctuation can serve as supplement to the unigrams. Therefore, we consider four types of text units as nodes in the graph: unigrams, bigrams, dependency relations, sentiment dependency relations. Sentiment dependency relations are described in Section 3.3. We replace all relation names with a general label. Text units that appear in at least 10 discussions are retained as nodes to reduce noise.\nEdge Set E. As Velikovich et al. (2010) and Feng et al. (2013) notice, a dense graph with a large number of nodes is susceptible to propagating noise, and will not scale well. We thus adopt the algorithm in Feng et al. (2013) to construct a sparsely connected graph. For each text unit t, we first compute its representation vector ~a using Pairwise Mutual Information scores with respect to the top 50 co-occuring text units. We define “co-occur” as text units appearing in the same sentence. An edge is created between two text units t0 and t1 only if they ever co-occur. The similarity between t0 and t1 is calculated as the Cosine similarity between ~a0 and ~a1.\nSeed Words. The seed sentiment are collected from three existing lexicons: MPQA lexicon, General Inquirer, and SentiWordNet. Each word in SentiWordNet is associated with a positive score and a negative score; words with a polarity score\nlarger than 0.7 are retained. We remove words with conflicting sentiments."

AAWD consists of 221 English Wikipedia discussions with agreement and disagreement annotations.3\nThe annotation of AAWD is made at utteranceor turn-level, where a turn is defined as continuous body of text uttered by the same participant. Annotators either label each utterance as agreement, disagreement or neutral, and select the corresponding spans of text, or label the full turn. Each turn is annotated by two or three people. To induce an utterance-level label for instances that have only a turn-level label, we assume they have the same label as the turn.\nTo train our sentiment model, we further transform agreement and disagreement labels (i.e. 3- way) into the 5-way labels. For utterances that are annotated as agreement and have the text span specified by at least two annotators, they are treated as “strongly agree” (PP). If an utterance is only selected as agreement by one annotator or it gets the label by turn-level annotation, it is “agree” (P). “Strongly disagree” (NN) and “disagree” (N) are collected in the same way from disagreement label. All others are neutral (O). In total, we have 16,501 utterances. 1,930 and 1,102 utterances are labeled as “NN” and “N”. 532 and 99 of them are “PP” and “P”. All other 12,648 are neutral samples. 4\n3Bender et al. (2011) originally use positive alignment and negative alignment to indicate two types of social moves. They define those alignment moves as “agreeing or disagreeing” with the target. We thus use agreement and disagreement instead of positive and negative alignment in this work.\n4345 samples with both positive and negative labels are treated as neutral.\nOnline Debate. The second dataset is the Internet Argument Corpus (IAC) (Walker et al., 2012a) collected from an online debate forum. Each discussion in IAC consists of multiple posts, where we treat each post as a turn. Most posts (72.3%) contain quoted content from the posts they target at or other resources. A post can have more than one quote, which naturally break the post into multiple segments. 1,806 discussions are annotated with agreement and disagreement on the segmentlevel from -5 to 5, with -5 as strongly disagree and 5 as strongly agree. We first compute the average score for each segment among different annotators and transform the score into sentiment label in the following way. We treat [−5,−3] as NN (1595 segments), (−3,−1] as N (4548 segments), [1, 3) as P (911 samples), [3, 5] as PP (199), all others as O (290 segments).\nIn the test phase, utterances or segments predicted with NN or N are treated as disagreement; the ones predicted as PP or P are agreement; O is neutral."

A classifier based on Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1999) (SVM) is trained with the features of sentiment words, minimum/maximum/average of the distances.\nWe also compare with two state-of-the-art methods that are widely used in sentiment prediction for conversations. The first one is an RBF kernel SVM based approach, which has been used for sentiment prediction (Hassan et al., 2010), and (dis)agreement detection (Yin et al., 2012) in online debates.

An isotonic Conditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) based sequential model is proposed to make predictions on sentenceor segment-level. We automatically construct a socially-tuned lexicon that is bootstrapped from existing general-purpose sentiment lexicons to further improve the performance. We evaluate our agreement and disagreement tagging model on two disparate online discussion corpora – Wikipedia Talk pages and online debates. Our model is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in both datasets. For example, the isotonic CRF model achieves F1 scores of 0.74 and 0.67 for agreement and disagreement detection, when a linear chain CRF obtains 0.58 and 0.56 for the discussions on Wikipedia Talk pages.",
