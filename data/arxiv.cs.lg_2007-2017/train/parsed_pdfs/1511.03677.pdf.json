      "text" : "Time series data comprised of clinical measurements, as recorded by caregivers in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), constitute an abundant and largely untapped source of medical insights. Potential uses of such data include classifying diagnoses accurately, predicting length of stay, predicting future illness, and predicting mortality. However, besides the difficulty of acquiring data, several obstacles stymie machine learning research with clinical time series. Episodes vary wildly in length, with stays ranging from just a few hours to multiple months. Observations, which include sensor data, vital signs, lab test results, and subjective assessments, are sampled irregularly, and are plagued by missing values (Marlin et al., 2012). Additionally, long-term time dependencies complicate learning with many algorithms. Lab results that taken together imply a particular diagnosis may be separated by days or weeks. Other examples of long-term dependencies include delays separating ∗Author website: http://zacklipton.com †Author website: http://www-scf.usc.edu/∼dkale/\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n03 67\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n1 N\nonsets of diseases from the appearance of symptoms. For example, symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome may not appear until 24-48 hours after lung injury (Mason et al., 2010).\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), in particular those based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), powerfully model varying-length sequential data, achieving state-of-the-art results for problems spanning natural language processing, image captioning, handwriting recognition, and genomic analysis (Auli et al., 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Vinyals et al., 2014; Karpathy & Fei-Fei, 2014; Liwicki et al., 2007; Graves et al., 2009; Pollastri et al., 2002; Vohradský, 2001; Xu et al., 2007). LSTMs can capture long range dependencies and nonlinear dynamics. Some sequence models, such as Markov models, conditional random fields, and Kalman filters, deal with sequential data but are ill-equipped to learn long-range dependencies. Other models require domain knowledge or feature engineering, offering less chance for serendipitous discovery. In contrast, neural networks learn representations and can discover unforeseen structure.\nThis paper presents the first empirical study of LSTMs applied to classifying diagnoses given multivariate PICU time series. Precisely, we formulate the problem as multilabel classification, since diagnoses are not mutually exclusive. Our examples are clinical episodes, each consisting of 13 frequently but irregularly sampled time series of clinical measurements, including body temperature, heart rate, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, and blood glucose among others. Associated with each patient are a subset of 429 diagnosis codes. As some are exceedingly rare, we focus on the 128 most common codes, classifying each episode with one or more diagnoses.\nBecause LSTMs have never been used in this setting, we methodically verify their utility. After first establishing set of strong baselines, we verify that even a simple LSTM architecture, trained to output predictions only at the final time step, beats a linear classifier when trained only on raw time series and nearly matches a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) trained on carefully hand-engineered features. We test a straightforward but novel target replication strategy for recurrent neural networks, inspired by the deep supervision technique of Lee et al. (2014) for training convolutional neural networks. We compose our optimization objective as a convex combination of the loss at the final sequence step and the mean of the losses over all sequence steps. Experiments demonstrate that target replication with a well-tuned hyper-parameter acts as a powerful regularizer, improving performance on all evaluation metrics. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of using additional information in the patient’s chart as auxiliary outputs, a technique previously used with feed-forward nets (Caruana et al., 1996). We show that this too regularizes the model and that in combination with target replication, it yields even higher performance on some metrics."

Notable earlier work includes Elman (1990), which first used back-propagation through time to train recurrent neural networks to perform supervised machine learning. The design of modern LSTM memory cells has remained close to the original, with the commonly used additions of forget gates (Gers et al., 2000b) and peep-hole connections (Gers et al., 2000a). The connectivity pattern among multiple LSTM layers in our models follows the architecture described by Graves (2013). Pascanu et al. (2013) explores other mechanisms by which a recurrent neural network could be made deep. Surveys of the literature include Graves (2012), a thorough dissertation on sequence labeling with RNNs, De Mulder et al. (2015), which surveys natural language applications, and Lipton et al. (2015), which provides a broad overview of RNNs for sequence learning, focusing on modern applications."

Several papers have applied RNNs to physiologic signals, including electrocardiograms (Silipo & Marchesi, 1998; Amari & Cichocki, 1998; Übeyli, 2009) and glucose measurements (Tresp & Briegel, 1998). RNNs have also been used for prediction problems in genomics (Pollastri et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2007; Vohradský, 2001). Multiple recent papers apply modern deep learning techniques (but not RNNs) to modeling psychological conditions (Dabek & Caban, 2015), head injuries (Rughani et al., 2010), and Parkinson’s disease (Hammerla et al., 2015).

Many recent papers use models with latent factors to capture nonlinear dynamics in clinical time series and to discover meaningful representations of health and illness. Gaussian processes and related techniques have proved popular because they can directly handle irregular sampling and encode prior knowledge via choice of covariance functions between time steps and across variables (Marlin et al., 2012; Ghassemi et al., 2015). Saria et al. (2010) combined a hierarchical dirichlet process with autoregressive models to infer latent disease “topics” in the heart rate signals of premature babies. Quinn et al. (2009) used linear dynamical systems with latent switching variables to model physiologic events like bradycardias. Citing inspiration from deep learning, Stanculescu et al.

      "heading" : "3 DATA DESCRIPTION",
      "text" : "Our experiments use a collection of fully anonymized clinical time series extracted from the EHR system at Children’s Hospital LA (Marlin et al., 2012; Che et al., 2015) as part of an IRB-approved study. The data consists of 10, 401 PICU episodes, each a multivariate time series of 13 variables: diastolic and systolic blood pressure, peripheral capillary refill rate, end-tidal CO2, fraction of inspired O2, Glascow coma scale, blood glucose, heart rate, pH, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, body temperature, and urine output. Episodes vary in length from 12 hours to 30 days.\nEach episode is associated with zero or more diagnostic labels from an in-house taxonomy used for research and billing, similar to codes from the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) (World Health Organization, 2004). The dataset contains 429 distinct labels indicating a variety of conditions, such as acute respiratory distress, congestive heart failure, seizures, renal failure, and sepsis. Because many of the diagnoses are exceedingly rare, we focus on the most common 128, each of which occurs more than 50 times in the dataset.\nThe time series are irregularly sampled multivariate time series with both missing values and variables. We resample all time series to an hourly rate, taking the mean measurement within each one hour window. We use forward- and back-filling to fill gaps created by the window-based resampling. When a single variable’s time series is missing entirely, we impute a clinically normal value, as defined by clinical experts. These procedures make reasonable assumptions about clinical practice: many variables are recorded at rates proportional to how quickly they change, and when a variable is absent, it is often because clinicians believed it to be normal and chose not to measure it. Nonetheless, they are not appropriate in all settings. Back-filling, for example, passes information from the future backwards. This is acceptable for classifying entire episodes but not for forecasting.\nWe rescale all variables to [0, 1] using ranges defined by clinical experts. We use published tables of normal values from large population studies to correct for differences in vital signs (e.g., blood pressure) that are due to age and gender (Fleming et al., 2011)(NHBPEP Working Group 2004)."

      "heading" : "4 METHODS",
      "text" : "In this work, we are interested in recognizing diagnoses and, more broadly, the observable physiologic characteristics of patients, a task generally termed phenotyping (Oellrich et al., 2015). We cast the problem of phenotyping clinical time series as multilabel classification. Given a series of observations x(1), ...,x(T ), we learn a classifier to generate hypotheses ŷ of the true labels y. Here, t indexes sequence steps, and for any example, T stands for the length of the sequence. Our proposed LSTM RNN uses memory cells with forget gates (Gers et al., 2000b) but without peephole connections (Gers et al., 2003). As output, we use a fully connected layer atop the highest LSTM layer followed by an element-wise sigmoid activation function, because our problem is multilabel. We use log loss as the loss function at each output.\nThe following equations give the update for a layer of memory cells htl where h (t) l−1 stands for the previous layer at the same sequence step (could be a previous LSTM layer or the input layer x(t)) and h(t−1)l stands for the same layer at the previous sequence step:\ng(t) = φ(Wgxh (t) l−1 +Wghh (t−1) l + bg)\ni(t) = σ(Wixh (t) l−1 +Wihh (t−1) l + bi)\nf (t) = σ(Wfxh (t) l−1 +Wfhh (t−1) l + bf )\no(t) = σ(Woxh (t) l−1 +Wohh (t−1) l + bo)\ns(t) = g(t) i(i) + s(t−1) f (t))\nh (t) l = φ(s (t)) o(t). In these equations, σ stands for an element-wise application of the sigmoid function, φ stands for an element-wise application of the tanh function and is the Hadamard (element-wise) product. The input, output, and forget gates are denoted by i, o, and f respectively, while g is the input node and has a tanh activation."

In this approach, we only have output ŷ at the final sequence step, at\nwhich our loss function is the average of the losses at each output node. Thus the loss calculated at a single sequence step is the average of log loss calculated separately on each label.\nloss(ŷ,y) = 1\n|L| l=|L|∑ l=1 −(yl · log(ŷl) + (1− yl) · log(1− ŷl))."

      "heading" : "4.2 SEQUENTIAL TARGET REPLICATION",
      "text" : "One problem with the simple approach is that the network must learn to pass information across many sequence steps in order to affect the output. We attack this problem by replicating our static targets at each sequence step (Figure 2), providing intermediate targets offering a local error signal. This approach is partly inspired by the deep supervision technique that Lee et al. (2014) apply to convolutional nets. This technique is especially sensible in our case because we expect the model to predict accurately even if the sequence were truncated by a small amount. The approach differs from Lee et al. (2014) because we use the same output weights to calculate ŷ(t) for all t. Further, we use this target replication to generate output at each sequence step, but not at each hidden layer.\nFor the model with target replication, we generate an output ŷ(t) at every sequence step. Our loss is then a convex combination of the final loss with an average of the losses over all steps:\nα · 1 T T∑ t=1 loss(ŷ(t),y(t)) + (1− α) · loss(ŷ(T ),y(T ))\nwhere T is the total number of sequence steps and α ∈ [0, 1] is a hyper-parameter which determines the relative importance of hitting these intermediary targets. At prediction time, we take only the output at the final step. In our experiments, networks using target replication outperformed those with a loss applied only on the final node in the sequence."

Given the well-documented successes of multitask learning with shared representations and feedforward networks, it seems plausible that we can train a stronger model by using the remaining 301 labels or other information, such as diagnostic categories, as auxiliary targets (Caruana et al., 1996). These additional targets serve as regularizers: the model aims to minimize the loss on the labels of interest but must also learn representations that minimize loss on the auxiliary targets (Figure 3). Given the lower quality of some of the extra labels, we name this model “JunkOut.”"

Interestingly, the presence of exploding gradients had no apparent connection to the loss on the particular example that caused it. To combat exploding gradients, we experimented with `22 weight decay, gradient clipping, and truncated back-propagation. Additionally, we found that deep supervision with target replication not only helped to learn faster but also served as a regularizer. In our final network, we used `22 regularization strength of 10\n−6, deep supervision with α = 0.6, hyperparameters which were chosen using validation data. Our final network used 2 hidden layers and 64 nodes per layer, an architecture also determined on the validation set. All models are trained on 80% of the data and tested on 10%. The remaining 10% is used as a validation set."

By micro-AUC we mean a single AUC computed on flattened Ŷ and Y matrices, whereas macro-AUC is an average of the AUC computed separately for each label. The blind classifier achieves 0.5 macro-AUC but can exceed .5 on micro AUC by predicting labels in descending order by base rate. Additionally, we report micro- and macro- averaged F1 score. Similarly, micro is reported on flattened matrices and macro- is an average over the labels. F1 metrics require a thresholding strategy, and here we select thresholds based upon validation set performance. We refer to Lipton et al. (2014) for an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each multilabel F-score and a characterization of optimal thresholds.\nFinally, we report precision at 10, which captures the fraction of true diagnoses among the model’s top 10 predictions, with a best possible score of 0.2281 on the test split of this data set because there are only 2.281 diagnoses per patient on average. While F1 and AUC are both useful for determining the relative quality of a classifier’s predictions, neither is tailored to a real-world application. Thus, we consider a medically plausible use case to motivate this more interpretable metric: generating a short list of the 10 most probable diagnoses. If we could create a high recall, moderate precision list\nof 10 likely diagnoses, it could be a valuable hint-generation tool. Further, testing for only the 10 most probable conditions is much more realistic than testing for all conditions."

For a much stronger baseline, we train an MLP with rectified linear activations, dropout of 0.5, and 3 hidden layers and 300 hidden nodes, hyperparameters chosen based on validation set performance. Each baseline is tested with two sets of inputs: raw time series and hand-engineered features. For raw time series, we used the first and last six hours. This provided classifiers with temporal information about changes in patient state from admission to discharge within a fixed-size input, as required by all baselines. We found this worked better than providing the first or last 12 hours. Our hand-engineered features are inspired by those used in state-of-the-art severity of illness scores (Pollack et al., 1996) and capture extremes (e.g., maximum), central tendencies (e.g., mean), variability, and trends. Such features have previously been shown to be very effective for these data (Marlin et al., 2012; Che et al., 2015)."

We believe that there is further room for improvement, especially given access to a richer data set including a larger number of variables and treatment information. Table 2 LSTM’s predictive performance for five critical care diagnoses with the highest F1 scores. Full per-diagnosis results may be found in Appendix A.\nDeep supervision yielded substantial improvements over simple LSTMs on all metrics. It accelerated learning and allowed the model to continue improving for a larger number of epochs. Computing classification error at each step provides local targets to guide training, which may aid the LSTM-DS in modeling long-range interactions indicating changes in patient state. The performance of the MLP using the first and last six hours suggests the importance such interactions.\nUsing additional targets (“JunkOut”) improved performance for most metrics, and reduced overfitting, but the effect was less dramatic than for deep supervision. Additionally, these gains came at the cost of slower training: the JunkOut models required more epochs, especially when using the 300 auxiliary labels. This may be due in part to class imbalance. For many of these labels it may take an entire epoch just to learn that they are occasionally nonzero.\nThe best performing model in our experiments was an MLP using hand-engineered features as input. This is not surprising as this model is able to directly exploit domain knowledge and features like\nvariability and trends that the LSTMs must learn. The LSTMs with deep supervision surpass the MLP on all metrics when both are trained on raw features."

      "heading" : "7 DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "Our results indicate that LSTM RNNs, especially when provided with deep supervision in the form of target replication, can successfully classify diagnoses of critical care patients given clinical time series data. Our experiments demonstrate a clear advantage over all linear baselines and over traditional feedforward architectures applied to raw measurements. However, this is only a first step in this line of research. Recognizing current diagnoses given only sensor data demonstrates that LSTMs can capture meaningful signal, but ultimately we would like to accurately predict unknown conditions and events, including outcomes such as mortality and treatment responses. In this work we used diagnostic labels without timestamps, but we are working to obtain time-stamped diagnoses, which would enable us to train models to perform early diagnosis by predicting future conditions. On the strength of these results, we are currently extending this work to a larger PICU data set with a richer set of measurements, including treatments and medications.\nOn the methodological side, we would like to both improve and better exploit the capabilities of LSTMs, Results from speech recognition have shown that LSTMs shine in comparison to other models using raw features. In the clinical setting, LSTMs may allow us to exploit previously difficult to mine sources of data while minimizing the preprocessing and feature engineering required. In contrast, our current data preparation pipeline removes valuable structure and information from clinical time series that could be exploited by a LSTM. For example, our forward- and back-filling imputation strategies discard useful information about which observations were recorded when. Imputing normal values for missing time series ignores the meaningful distinction between truly normal and missing measurements. In future work, we plan to introduce indicator variables to allow the LSTM to distinguish actual from missing or imputed measurements. Also, our window-based resampling procedure reduces the variability of more frequently measured vital signs (e.g., heart rate). The flexibility of the LSTM architecture should also enable us to eliminate age-based corrections and to incorporate non-sequential inputs, such as age, weight, and height (or even hand-engineered features), into predictions.\nNext steps in this direction include developing LSTM architectures to directly handle missing values and irregular sampling. We also are encouraged by the success of target replication and plan to explore other variants of this technique and to apply it to other domains and tasks. Additionally, we acknowledge that there remains a debate about the interpretability of neural networks when applied to complex medical problems. We are developing methods to interpret the representations learned by LSTMs in order to better expose patterns of health and illness to clinical users. We also hope to make practical use of the distributed representations of patients for patient similarity search."

    "abstractText" : "Clinical medical data, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU), consists of multivariate time series of observations. For each patient visit (or episode), sensor data and lab test results are recorded in the patient’s Electronic Health Record (EHR). While potentially containing a wealth of insights, the data is difficult to mine effectively, owing to varying length, irregular sampling and missing data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly those using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hidden units, are powerful and increasingly popular models for learning from sequence data. They adeptly model varying length sequences and capture long range dependencies. We present the first study to empirically evaluate the ability of LSTMs to recognize patterns in multivariate time series of clinical measurements. Specifically, we consider multilabel classification of diagnoses, training a model to classify 128 diagnoses given 13 frequently but irregularly sampled clinical measurements. First, we establish the effectiveness of a simple LSTM network for modeling clinical data. Then we demonstrate a straightforward and effective deep supervision strategy in which we replicate targets at each sequence step. Trained only on raw time series, our models outperforms several strong baselines on a wide variety of metrics, and nearly matches the performance of a multilayer perceptron trained on carefully hand-engineered features, establishing the usefulness of LSTMs for modeling medical data. The best LSTM model accurately classifies many diagnoses, including diabetic ketoacidosis (F1 score of .714), scoliosis (.677), and status asthmaticus (.632).",
