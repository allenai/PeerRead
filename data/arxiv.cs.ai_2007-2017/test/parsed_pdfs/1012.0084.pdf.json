      "text" : "Hand gestures provide a separate complementary modality to speech for expressing ones ideas. Information associated with hand gestures in a conversation is degree, discourse structure, spatial and temporal structure. The approaches present can be mainly divided into Data-Glove Based and Vision Based approaches. The Data-Glove based methods use sensor devices for digitizing hand and finger motions into multi-parametric data. The extra sensors make it easy to collect hand configuration and movement. However, the devices are quite expensive and bring much cumbersome experience to the users. In contrast, the Vision Based methods require only a camera, thus realizing a natural interaction between humans and computers without the use of any extra devices. These systems tend to complement biological vision by describing artificial vision systems that are implemented in software and/or hardware. This poses a challenging problem as these systems need to be background invariant, lighting insensitive, person and camera independent to achieve real time performance.\nAn important face feature point is the nose tip. This is because the nose is the highest protruding point from the face. Besides that, it is not affected by facial expressions. Another important function of the nose is that it is able to indicate the head pose. Knowledge of the nose location will enable us to align an unknown 3D face with those in a face database. Some 2D works include training the computer to detect the nose using Support Vector Machine or by using contrast values and edge detection to locate the nose changes. Using 3D images, one of the methods used was to take horizontal slices of the face and then draw triangles on the slices. The point with the maximum altitude triangle will be considered the nose tip.\nEye detection is divided into eye position detection and eye contour\ndetection. Existing works in eye detection can be classified into two major categories: traditional image-based passive approaches and the active IR based approaches. The former uses intensity and shape of eyes for detection and the latter works on the assumption that eyes have a reflection under near IR illumination and produce bright/dark pupil effect. The traditional methods can be broadly classified into three categories: template based methods, appearance based methods and feature based methods."

      "text" : "Eyes and Nose are the most salient and robust features on human faces. The precise detection of eyes and the nose tip had been a crucial step in many face-related applications. A handful of hardware solutions came its way through which included, entering data into the computer by pressing some sort of switches, infrared emitters and reflectors attached to the user’s glasses, head band, or cap, transmitter over the monitor. All these solutions were not properly adaptable as some people felt uncomfortable in wearing helmets, glasses, mouth sticks or other interfacing devices. In the later years, development in technology resulted in locating the eyes and nose computationally. The various approaches include the following:\nIn the template based methods, a generic eye model, based on the eye shape, was designed at first [12]. Template matching is then used to search the image for the eyes. While these methods can detect eyes accurately, they are normally time-consuming. In order to improve the accuracy, these methods have to match the whole face with an eye template pixel by pixel. If we are not aware of the size of eyes then, the matching process with eye templates of different sizes is repeated. Solutions to improve the efficiency of template matching method focus on two points:\ni. Reducing the area in the face image for template matching ii. Cutting down the times of this type of matching\nIn addition, one can evaluate the size of eye template according to the size of these two regions. In other words, profiting from possibility of evaluating the size of eyes, this algorithm performs the template matching just once [12]. A template based approach in which the convex shape of the nose was used to identify the nose region. It involved calculating the local search area which was used as a template. The template was scanned through the image and the pixel ‘x’ which had maximum correlation was identified. The position of best match was refined using Evident Based Convolution Filter.\nAppearance based methods: Appearance based methods detect eyes based on their photometric appearance. These methods usually need to collect a large amount of training data, representing eyes of different individuals under different illumination conditions.\nThis data is used to train some classifier, and detection is achieved by classification [15] [17].\nTexture based methods: The candidates of eyes are estimated by eye filters based on texture information. Human eyes usually include important information of a face, compared to the other facial features. The appearance of eyes variously changes.\nPixel-pattern-based texture feature (PPBTF) - It is constructed from one pattern map. A gray scale image is first transformed into a pattern map in which edge and background pixels are classified by pattern matching with a given set of M pattern templates B that reflect the spatial features of images. For each pixel (x, y) in a gray scale image I, let zi be the inner product of its S × S neighbour block b within the pattern templates.\nFeature based methods: In which the characteristics (such as edge and intensity of iris, the colour distributions of the sclera and the flesh) of the eyes were explored to identify some distinctive features around the eyes. Although these methods were efficient, they lacked accuracy for the images which did not have high contrast. For example, these techniques mistook eyebrows for eyes.\nA few systems which detect facial features computationally include the following:\nColour Data Model: The human facial features such nose tip and the nose ridge were identified using a shading technique on the colour data of the image. But, the highly sensitive nature of the nose region to light made the system disadvantageous.\nEffective Energy: An Effective Energy (EE) term was defined for nose tip, based on the assumption that the nose tip is the highest local point and has peaked cup like shape. This method had the sufficient accuracy result in case the complete shape of nose tip can be obtained. This is a feature based approach.\nUser Interface development requires a sound understanding of human hand’s anatomical structure in order to determine what kind of postures and gestures are comfortable to make. Although hand postures and gestures are often considered identical, the distinctions between them need to be cleared. Hand posture is a static hand pose without involvement of movements. For example, making a fist and holding it in a certain position is a hand posture. Whereas, a hand gesture is defined as a dynamic movement referring to a sequence of hand postures connected by continuous motions over a short time span, such as waving good-bye. With this composite property of hand gestures, the problem of gesture recognition can be decoupled into two levelsthe low level hand posture detection and the high level hand gesture recognition. In vision based hand gesture recognition system, the movement of the hand is recorded by video camera(s). This input video is decomposed into a set of features taking individual frames into account. Some form of filtering may also be performed on the frames to remove the unnecessary data, and highlight necessary components. One of the earliest model based approaches to the problem of bare hand tracking was proposed by Rehg and Kanade [19]. In [20] a model-based method for capturing articulated hand motion is presented. The constraints on the joint configurations are learned from natural hand motions, using a data glove as input device. A sequential Monte Carlo tracking algorithm, based on importance sampling, produces good results, but is view-dependent, and does not handle global hand motion.\nThe organization of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section III highlights the various aspects of hand posture and gesture recognition technology. Section IV discusses the available algorithms for nose detection and tracking, discussing their advantages and shortcomings. Section V describes various application areas of eye recognition and tracking and points out the open issues, and Section VI concludes the paper."

Gestures are extracted from a sequence of video images by tracking the skin-colour blobs corresponding to the hand into a body– face space centered on the face of the user. The goal is to recognize two classes of gestures: deictic and symbolic. The image is filtered using a fast look–up indexing table\nof skin colour pixels in YUV colour space. After filtering, skin colour pixels are gathered into blobs. Blobs are statistical objects based on the location (x,y) and the colourimetry (Y,U,V) of the skin colour pixels in order to determine homogeneous areas. A skin colour pixel belongs to the blob which has the same location and colourimetry component. Deictic gestures are pointing movements towards the left (right) of the body–face space and symbolic gestures are intended to execute commands (grasp, click, rotate) on the left (right) of shoulder."

The symbol Y indicates intensity while UV specifies chrominance components.\n3. Now the hand is separated using CAMSHIFT [2] algorithm .Since the hand is the largest connected region, we can segment the hand from the body.\n4. After this is done, the position of the hand centroid is calculated in each frame. This is done by first calculating the zeroth and first moments and then using this information the centroid is calculated.\n5. Now the different centroid points are joint to form a trajectory .This trajectory shows the path of the hand movement and thus the hand tracking procedure is determined."

The system uses a 3-D time-of-flight (TOF) [3] [4] sensor which has the big advantage of simplifying hand segmentation. The gestures used in the system show a good separation potential along the two image axes. Hence, the projections of the hand onto the x- and y-axis are used as features for the classification. The region of the arm is discarded since it contains no useful information for the classification and due to strong variation between human beings. Additionally, depth features are included to distinguish certain gestures: gestures which have same projections, but different alignments.\nThe algorithm can be divided into five steps:\n1. Segmentation of the hand and arm via distance values: The hand and arm are segmented by an iterative seed fill algorithm.\n2. Determination of the bounding box: The segmented region is projected onto the x- and y-axis to determine the bounding box of the object.\n3. Extraction of the hand.\n4.

This method is based on classifying the different gestures according to geometric-based invariants which are obtained from image data after segmentation; thus, unlike many other recognition methods, this method is not dependent on skin colour. Gestures are extracted from each frame of the video,\nwith a static background. The segmentation is done by dynamic extraction of background pixels according to the histogram of each image. Gestures are classified using a weighted K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm which is combined with a Naïve Bayes [5] approach to estimate the probability of each gesture type. When this method was tested in the domain of the JAST Human Robot dialog system, it classified more than 93% of the gestures correctly.\nThis algorithm proceeds in three main steps. The first\nstep is to segment and label the objects of interest and to extract geometric invariants from them. Next, the gestures are classified using a K-nearest neighbor algorithm with distance weighting algorithm (KNNDW) to provide suitable data for a locally weighted Naïve Bayes’ classifier. The input vector for this classifier consists of invariants of each region of interest, while the output is the type of the gesture. After the gesture has been classified, the final step is to locate the specific properties of the gesture that are needed for processing in the system—for example, the fingertip for a pointing gesture or the center of the hand for a holding-out gesture."

This input video is decomposed into a set of features taking individual frames into account. The hands are isolated from other body parts as well as other background objects.

Since, gestures are nothing but a sequence of hand postures connected by continuous motions, a recognizer can be trained against a possible grammar. With this, hand gestures can be specified as building up out of a group of hand postures in various ways of composition, just as phrases are built up by words.

Such an approach is ideal for realistic interactions in virtual environments. This approach has several disadvantages that have kept it from real-world use. First, at each frame the initial parameters have to be close to the solution, otherwise the approach is liable to find a suboptimal solution (i.e. local minima). Secondly, the fitting process is also sensitive to noise (e.g. lens aberrations, sensor noise) in the imaging process. Finally, the approach cannot handle the inevitable self-occlusion of the hand."

Generally speaking, appearance based approaches have the advantage of real time performance due to the easier 2D image features that are employed. There have been a number of research efforts on appearance based methods in recent years. A straightforward and simple approach that is often utilized is to look for skin coloured regions in the image. Although very popular, this has some drawbacks like skin colour detection is very sensitive to lighting conditions. While practicable and efficient methods exist for skin colour detection under controlled (and known) illumination, the problem of learning a flexible skin model and adapting it over time is challenging. This only works if we assume that no other skin like objects is present in the scene. Another approach is to use the\neigenspace for providing an efficient representation of a large set of high-dimensional points using a small set of basis vectors."

      "text" : "Based on the observations regarding Hand Detection and Tracking, we can conclude that using YUV Skin Color Segmentation followed by CAMSHIFT algorithm will help in the effective detection and tracking as the centroid values can easily be obtained by calculating the moments at each point, later we could combine Hidden Markov Training for further applications. It is better when compared to Time-Flight Camera where one has to find the bounding box and then use Iterative Seed Fill algorithm. For Nose Detection and Tracking system, the results obtained using Edge Detection Techniques were comparatively better, and it also detects the nose for faces at various angles. The success rate using this method for frontal faces is about 93% and for non frontal faces it is about 68%. This shows that this particular method is suitable to be implemented in an automatic 3D face recognition system. For the analysis of Eye Detection and Tracking, it would be efficient to implement a method which would be a combination of texture based and colour based eye detection methods as colour plays a major role in both texture recognition of facial regions and later finding the accurate location of eyes using eye maps. Individually the efficiencies of texture based and color based detection methods are 98.2% and 98.5% respectively, but after incorporating the proposed method the efficiency could be enhanced to greater extent."

    "abstractText" : "Gesture recognition is mainly apprehensive on analyzing the functionality of human wits. The main goal of gesture recognition is to create a system which can recognize specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. Hand gestures provide a separate complementary modality to speech for expressing ones ideas. Information associated with hand gestures in a conversation is degree, discourse structure, spatial and temporal structure. The approaches present can be mainly divided into Data-Glove Based and Vision Based approaches. An important face feature point is the nose tip. Since nose is the highest protruding point from the face. Besides that, it is not affected by facial expressions. Another important function of the nose is that it is able to indicate the head pose. Knowledge of the nose location will enable us to align an unknown 3D face with those in a face database. Eye detection is divided into eye position detection and eye contour detection. Existing works in eye detection can be classified into two major categories: traditional image-based passive approaches and the active IR based approaches. The former uses intensity and shape of eyes for detection and the latter works on the assumption that eyes have a reflection under near IR illumination and produce bright/dark pupil effect. The traditional methods can be broadly classified into three categories: template based methods, appearance based methods and feature based methods. The purpose of this paper is to compare various human Gesture recognition systems for interfacing machines directly to human wits without any corporeal media in an ambient environment.",
