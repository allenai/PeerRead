      "text" : "Although scientific experiments are often accompanied by vast amounts of structured data, full-text scientific publications still remain one of the main means for communicating academic knowledge. Given the dynamic nature of modern research and its ever-accelerating pace, it is crucial to automatically analyze new works in order to have a complete picture of advances in a given field.\nRecently, some progress has been made in this direction for the fixed-domain use case1. However, creating a universal open-domain system still\n1 E.g. BioNLP: http://2016.bionlp-st.org/\nremains a challenge due to significant domain differences between articles originating from different fields of research. The SemEval 2017 Task 10: ScienceIE (Augenstein et al., 2017) promotes the multi-domain use case, providing source articles from three domains: Computer Science, Material Sciences and Physics. The task consists of three subtasks, namely (A) identification of keyphrases, (B) classifying them into broad domain-independent classes and (C) inferring relations between the identified keyphrases.\nFor example, for the input sentence ‘The thermodynamics of copper-zinc alloys (brass) was subject of numerous investigations’ the following output would be expected:\n(A) 1. The thermodynamics of copper-zinc alloys 2. copper-zinc alloys 3. brass\n(B) 1. TASK 2. MATERIAL 3. MATERIAL\n(C) synonym(2,3)\nOur submission focuses on (B) keyphrase classification given item boundaries. We avoid taskspecific feature engineering, which would potentially render the system domain-dependent. Instead, we build an ensemble of several deep learning classifiers detailed in §3, whose inputs are word embeddings learned from general domains."

      "text" : "In the annotation scheme proposed by the task organizers, keyphrases denoting a scientific model, algorithm or process should be classified as PROCESS (P), which also comprises methods (e.g. ‘backpropagation’), physical equipment (e.g. ‘plasmatic nanosensors’, ‘electron microscope’) and tools (e.g. ‘MATLAB’). TASK (T) contains\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n02 21\n5v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n0 A\npr 2\n01 7\nconcrete research tasks (e.g. ‘powder processing’, ‘dependency parsing’) and research areas (e.g. ‘machine learning’), while MATERIAL (M) includes physical materials (e.g. ‘iron’, ‘nanotube’), and corpora or datasets (e.g. ‘the CoNLL-2003 NER corpus’).\nThe corpus for the shared task consisted of 500 journal articles retrieved from ScienceDirect2, evenly distributed among Computer Science, Material Sciences and Physics domains. It was split into three segments of 350 (training), 50 (development), and 100 (test) documents. The corpus used in subtask (B) contains paragraphs of those articles, annotated with spans of keyphrases. Table 1 shows the distribution of the classes M, T, and P in the data. We note that class T is underrepresented and makes up less than 16% of all instances.\nInter-annotator agreement for the dataset was published to be between 0.45 and 0.85 (Cohen’s κ) (Augenstein et al., 2017). Reviewing similar annotation efforts (QasemiZadeh and Schumann, 2016) already shows that despite the seemingly simple annotation task, usually annotators do not reach high agreement neither on span of annotations nor the class assigned to each span3."

      "text" : "In this section, we describe the individual systems that form the basis of our experiments (see §4).\nOur basic setup for all of our systems was as follows. For each keyphrase we extracted its left context, right context and the keyphrase itself (center). We represent each of the three contexts as the concatenation of their word tokens: to have fixed-size representations, we limit the left context to the ` previous tokens, the right context to the r following tokens and the center to the c initial tokens of the keyphrase. We consider `, r and c as hyper-parameters of our modeling. If necessary, we pad up each respective context with ‘empty’ word tokens. We then map each token to a ddimensional word embedding. The choices for\n2 http://www.sciencedirect.com/ 3F1-scores ranging from 0.528 to 0.755 for span bound-\naries and from 0.471 to 0.635 for semantic categories.\nword embeddings are described below. To summarize, we frame our classification problem as a mapping fθ (θ represents model parameters) from concatenated word embeddings to one of the three classes MATERIAL, PROCESS, and TASK:\nfθ : R`·d × Rc·d × Rr·d → {M,P,T}.\nNext, we describe the embeddings that we used and subsequently the machine learning models fθ.\nWord Embeddings We experimented with three kinds of word embeddings. We use the popular Glove embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) (6B) of dimensions 50, 100, and 300, which largely capture semantic information. Further we employ the more syntactically oriented 300-dimensional embeddings of Levy and Goldberg (2014), as well as the 300- dimensional embeddings of Komninos and Manandhar (2016), which are trained to predict both dependency- and standard window-based context.\nDeep Learning models Our first model is a character-level convolutional neural network (char-CNN) illustrated in Figure 1. This model (A) considers each of the three contexts (left, center, right) independently, representing them by a 100-dimensional vector as follows. Each character is represented by a 1-hot vector, which is then mapped to a 32-dimensional\nembedding (not pre-trained, and updated during learning). Then m filters, each of size s, are applied on the embedding layer. Max-over-time pooling results in anm-dimensional layer which is fully connected with the 100-dimensional output layer, with tanh activation function. The 100-d representations of each context are then (B) concatenated, resulting in a 300-dimensional representation of the input. A final softmax layer predicts one of our three target classes. The hyperparameters of this model—additional to `, r, c mentioned above—are: number of filters m, filter size s, and a few others, such as the number of characters to consider in each context window.\nOur second model, which operates on the tokenlevel, is a “stacked learner”. We take five base classifiers from scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier with two different parameterizations; ExtraTreesClassifier with two different parameterizations; and XGBClassifier), and train them repeatedly on 90% of the training data, extracting their\npredictions on the remaining 10%. This process is iterated 10 times, in a cross-validation manner, so that we have a complete sample of predictions of the base classifiers on the training data. We then use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a metaclassifier that is trained to combine the predictions of the base classifiers into a final output prediction. The MLP is trained for 100 epochs and the model with best performance on a 10% development set is chosen as the model to apply to unseen test data.\nOur third model (Figure 2), also operating on the token level, is an attention based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (AB-LSTM)4. After loading pre-trained word embeddings, we apply 4 convolutional layers with filter sizes 2, 3, 5 and 7, followed by max-over-timepooling. We concatenate the respective vectors to create an attention vector. The forward and backward LSTM layers (64-dimensional) are supplied with the pre-trained embeddings and the computed attention vector. Their output is concatenated and, after applying dropout of 0.5, is used by the final softmax layer to predict the label probabilities."

      "text" : "We set the c hyper-parameter to 4, and draw left and right context length hyper-parameters `, r (` = r) from a discrete uniform distribution over the multi-set {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5}.\nPerformance measure was micro-F1 as computed by the task’s evaluation script.5 Table 2 shows average, maximum, and minimum performances of the systems we experimented with. We indicate the ‘incorrect’ systems (those trained on only the dev set) with a star. We tested 56 different CNNs—hyper-parameters randomly drawn from specific ranges; e.g., we draw the number of filters m from a normal distribution N (µ = 250, σ = 50)—90 different stackers, and 20 different AB-LSTMs. Our three submitted systems were simple majority votes of (1) the 90 stackers, (2) the 90 stackers and 56 CNNs, (3) the 90 stackers, 56 CNNs and 20 AB-LSTMs. Overall, majority voting is considerably better than the mean performances of each system.\n4 Code was adapted from https://github.com/ codekansas/keras-language-modeling\n5 We report results without the “rel” flag, i.e., corresponding to the column “Overall” in Augenstein et al. (2017), Table 4. Setting “rel” leads to consistently higher results. E.g., with this flag, we have 72% micro-F1 for our best ensemble (corresponding to column “B” in Augenstein et al. (2017), Table 4), rather than 69% as reported in our Table 2.\nFor the stacker, the Komninos embeddings worked consistently best, with an average F1score of 63.83%. Levy embeddings were second (62.50), followed by Glove embeddings of size 50 (61%), size 300 (60.80) and size 100 (59.50). We assume this is due to the Komninos embeddings being ‘richest’ in nature, capturing both semantic and syntactic information. However, with more training data (corrected results), mean performances as a function of embedding type are closer: 67.77 (Komninos), 67.61 (Levy), 67.38 (Glove-300), 66.88 (Glove-50), 65.77 (Glove100). The AB-LSTM could not capitalize as much on the syntactic information, and performed best with the Glove embeddings, size 100 (60.35%), and worst with the Levy embeddings (57.80).\nThe char-level CNN and the stacker performed individually considerably better than the ABLSTM. However, including the AB-LSTM in the ensemble slightly increased the majority F1-score on both the M and T class, as Table 3 shows.\nError analysis: Table 4 details that TASK is often confused with PROCESS, and—though less often—vice versa, leading to drastically lower F1score than for the other two classes. This mismatch is because PROCESS and TASK can describe similar concepts, resulting in rather subtle differences. E.g., looking at various ‘analysis’ instances, we find that some are labeled as PROCESS and others as TASK in the gold data. This holds even for a few seemingly very similar keyphrases (‘XRD analysis’, ‘FACS analysis’). The ensemble has trouble labeling this correctly, tagging 6 of 17 ‘analysis’ instances wrongly. Beyond further suspicious labelings in the data (e.g.,\n‘nuclear fissions reactors’ as Task), other cases could have been resolved by knowledge of syntax (‘anionic polymerization of styrene’ is a process, not a material) and/or POS tags, and by knowledge of common abbreviations such as ‘PSD’.\nWe note that our submitted systems have the best F1-score for the minority class TASK (45%∗/47% vs. ≤28% for all other participants). Thus, our submission would have scored 1st using macro-F1 (60.66∗/65.33 vs. ≤56.66), even in the erroneous setting of much less training data."

      "text" : "We present an ensemble-based keyphrase classification system which has achieved close-to-thebest results in the ScienceIE Subtask (B) while using only a fraction of the available training data. With the full training data, our approach ranks 1st. To avoid using expert features has been one of our priorities, but we believe that incorporating additional task-neutral information beyond words and word order would benefit the system performance.\nWe also experimented with document embeddings, created from additionally crawled ScienceDirect6 articles. Even though the stacker described in §3 acting as a document classifier obtained a reasonably high accuracy of ∼87%, its predictions had little effect on the overall results.\nManual examination of system errors shows that using part-of-speech tags, syntactic relations and simple named entity recognition would very likely boost the performance of our systems."
