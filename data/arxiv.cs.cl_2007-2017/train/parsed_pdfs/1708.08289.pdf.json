      "text" : "Search is o en performed in the context of some larger underlying task [11]. ere is a growing stream of research aimed at making search engines more task-aware (i.e., recognizing what task the user is trying to accomplish) and customizing the search experience accordingly (see §2). In this paper, we focus our a ention on one particular tool for supporting task-based search: query suggestions. ery suggestions are an integral part of modern search engines [16]. We envisage an user interface where these suggestions are presented once the user has issued an initial query; see Figure 1. Note that this is di erent from query autocompletion, which tries to recommend various possible completions while the user is still typing the query. e task-aware query suggestions we propose are intended for exploring various aspects (subtasks) of the given task a er inspecting the initial search results. Selecting them would allow the user to narrow down the scope of the search.\ne Tasks track at the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) has introduced an evaluation platform for this very problem, referred to as task understanding [20].

We use these keyphrases as query suggestions.\nOur aim is to generate such suggestions in a se ing where past usage data and query logs are not available or cannot be utilized. is would be typical for systems that have a smaller user base (e.g., in the enterprise domain) or when a search engine has been newly deployed [4]. One possibility is to use query suggestion APIs, which are o ered by all major web search engines. ese are indeed one main source type we consider. Additionally, we use the initial query to search for relevant documents, using web search engines, and extract keyphrases from search snippets and from full text documents. Finally, given the task-based focus of our work, we lend special treatment to the WikiHow site,1 which is an extensive database of how-to guides.\ne main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a transparent architecture, using generative probabilistic modeling, for extracting keyphrases from a variety of sources and generating query suggestions from them. Second, we provide a detailed analysis of the components of our framework using di erent estimation methods. Many systems that participated in the TREC Tasks track have relied on strategic combinations of di erent sources to produce query suggestions, see, e.g., [7–9]. However, no systematic comparison of the di erent source types has been performed yet—we ll this gap. Additional components include estimating a document’s importance within a given source, extracting keyphrases from documents, and forming query suggestions from these keyphrases. Finally, we check whether our ndings are consistent across the 2015 and 2016 editions of the TREC Tasks track."

      "heading" : "2 RELATEDWORK",
      "text" : "ere is a large body of work on understanding and supporting users in carrying out complex search tasks. Log-based studies have been one main area of focus, including the identi cation of tasks and segmentation of search queries into tasks [2, 14] and mining task-based search sessions in order to understand query 1h p://www.wikihow.com/\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n08 28\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 2\n8 A\nug 2\n01 7\nreformulations [10] or search trails [19]. Another theme is supporting exploratory search, where users pursue an information goal to learn or discover more about a given topic. Recent research in this area has brought the importance of support interfaces into focus [1, 3, 17]. Our main interest is in query suggestions, as a distinguished support mechanism. Most of the related work utilizes large-scale query logs. For example, Craswell and Szummer [6] perform a random walk on a query-click graph. Boldi et al. [5] model the query ow in user search sessions via chains of queries. Scenarios in the absence of query logs have been addressed in [4, 13], where query suggestions are extracted from the document corpus. However, their focus is on query autocompletion, representing the completed and partial terms in a query. Kelly et al. [12] have shown that users prefer query suggestions, rather than term suggestions. We undertake the task of suggesting queries to users, related to the task they are performing, as we shall explain in the next section."

      "heading" : "3 PROBLEM STATEMENT",
      "text" : "We adhere to the problem de nition of the task understanding task of the TREC Tasks track. Given an initial query q0, the goal is to return a ranked list of query suggestions 〈q1, . . .qn〉 that cover all the possible subtasks related to the task the user is trying to achieve. In addition to the initial query string, the entities mentioned in it are also made available (identi ed by their Freebase IDs).\nFor example, for the query “low wedding budget,” subtasks include (but are not limited to) “buy a used wedding gown,” “cheap wedding cake,” and “make your own invitations.” ese subtasks have been manually identi ed by the track organizers based on information extracted from the logs of a commercial search engine. e suggested keyphrases are judged with respect to each subtask on a three point scale (non-relevant, relevant, and highly relevant). Note that subtasks are only used in the evaluation, these are not available when generating the keyphrases."

      "heading" : "4.4 Keyphrase Relevance",
      "text" : "We obtain keyphrases from each document, using an automatic keyphrase extraction algorithm. Speci cally, we use the RAKE keyword extraction system [15]. For each keyphrase k , extracted from document d , the associated con dence score is denoted by c(k,d). Upon a manual inspection of the extraction output, we introduce some data cleansing steps. We only retain keyphrases that: (i) have an extraction con dence above an empirically set threshold of 2; (ii) are at most 5 terms long; (iii) each of the terms has a length between 4 and 15 characters, and is either a meaningful number (i.e., max. 4 digits) or a term (excluding noisy substrings and reserved keywords from mark-up languages). Finally, we set the relevance of k as P(k |d, s) = c(k,d)/∑k ′ c(k ′,d).\nIn case s is of type QS, each returned document actually corresponds to a query suggestion. us, we treat each of these documents d as a single keyphrase k , for which we set P(k |d, s) = 1."

      "heading" : "4.5 ery Suggestions",
      "text" : "As a nal step, we need to generate query suggestions from the extracted keyphrases. As a baseline option, we take each raw keyphrase k as-is, i.e., with q = k we set P(q |q0, s,k) = 1.\nAlternatively, we can form query suggestions by expanding keyphrases. Here, k is combined with the initial query q0 using a set of expansion rules proposed in [7]: (i) adding k as a sufx to q0; (ii) adding k as a su x to an entity mentioned in q0; and (iii) using k as-is. Rules (i) and (ii) further involve a custom string concatenation operator; we refer to [7] for details. Each query suggestion q, that is generated from keyword k , has an associated con dence score c(q,q0, s,k). We then set P(q |q0, s,k) = c(q,q0, s,k)/ ∑ q′ c(q′,q0, s,k). By conditioning the suggestion probability on s , it is possible to apply a di erent approach for each source. Like in the previous subsection, we treat sources of type QS distinctly, by simply taking q = k and se ing P(q |q0, s,k) = 1.\nWe note that it is possible that multiple query suggestions have the same nal probability P(q |q0). We resolve ties using a deterministic algorithm, which orders query suggestions by length (favoring short queries) and then sorts them alphabetically."

We report on the o cial evaluation metrics used at the TREC Tasks track, which are ERR-IA@20 and α-NDCG@20. In accordance with the track’s se ings, we use ERR-IA@20 as our primary metric. (For simplicity, we omit mentioning the cut-o rank of 20 in all the table headers.) We noticed that in the ground truth the initial query itself has been judged as a highly relevant suggestion in numerous cases. We removed these cases, as they make li le sense for the envisioned scenario; we note that this leads to a drop in absolute terms of performance. We report on statistical signi cance using a two-tailed paired t-test at p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, denoted by † and ‡, respectively.\nIn a series of experiments, we evaluate each component of our approach, in a bo om-up fashion. For each query set, we pick the\ncon guration that performed best on that query set, which is an idealized scenario. Note that our focus is not on absolute performance gures, but on answering the following research questions:\nRQ1 What are the most useful information sources? RQ2 What are e ective ways of (i) estimating the importance\nof documents and (ii) generating query suggestions from keyphrases? RQ3 Are our ndings consistent across the two query sets?"

It is clear that, with a single exception (2015 WH), it is be er to use the raw keyphrases, without any expansion. e di erences are signi cant on the 2016 query set for all source types but QS. Regarding the comparison of di erent source types, we nd that QS >WS >WD >WH on the 2016 query set, meanwhile for 2015, the order is WS >WD > QS, WH."

We nd that rank-based document importance is bene cial for the query suggestion (QS) source types, for both years, and for WikiHow (WH) on the 2015 topics. However, the di erences are only signi cant for QS 2015. For all other source types, the uniform se ing performs be er.\nWe also compare performance across the 10 individual sources. Figure 3 shows the results, in terms of ERR-IA@20, using the uniform estimator. We observe a very similar pa ern using the rankbased estimator (which is not included due to space constraints). On the 2016 query set, the individual sources follow the exact same pa erns as their respective types (i.e., QS >WS >WD >WH), with one exception. e Bing API returned an empty set of search suggestions for many queries, hence the low performance of QSBinд .

Table 2); (iii) proportional to the importance of the individual source (cf. Figure 3). e results are presented in Table 3. Firstly, we observe that the combination of sources performs be er than any individual source type on its own. As for se ing source importance, on the 2015 query set we nd that (iii) delivers the best results, which is in line with our expectations.

On the 2015 query set, query suggestions proved much less e ective; see RQ3 below. (RQ2) With a single exception, using the raw keyphrases, as-is, performs be er than expanding them by taking the original query into account. For web query suggestions it is bene cial to consider the rank order of suggestions, while for web search snippets and documents the uniform se ing performs be er. For WikiHow, it varies across query sets. (RQ3) Our main observations are consistent across the 2015 and 2016 query sets, regarding documents importance estimation and suggestions generation methods. It is worth noting that some of our methods were o cially submi ed to TREC 2016 [7] and were included in the assessment pools. is is not the case for 2015, where many of our query suggestions are missing relevance assessments (and, thus, are considered irrelevant). is might explain the low performance of QS sources on the 2015 queries."

As a next step, we plan to cluster query suggestions together that belong to the same subtask. is would naturally enable us to provide diversi ed query suggestions."
