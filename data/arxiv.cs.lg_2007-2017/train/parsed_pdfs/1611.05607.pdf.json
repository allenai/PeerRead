      "text" : "In many AI challenges, including perception and planning, one specific problem requires multiple strategies. In the computer vision literature, this topic has gained little attention. Since a single model is typically trained, the conventional view is that of a unified, albeit complex, solution that captures all scenarios. Our work shows that careful consideration of the multifaceted nature of optical flow leads to a clear improvement in performing this task.\nIn optical flow, one can roughly separate between the small- and the large-displacement scenarios, and train model to apply different strategies to these different cases. The small displacement scenarios are characterized by relatively small appearance changes and require patch descriptors that can capture minute differences in appearance. The large displacement scenarios, on the other hand, require much more invariance in the matching process.\nState of the art methods in optical flow employ metric learning in order to learn the patch descriptors. We focus on the process of selecting negative samples during training and suggest two modifications. First, rather than selecting negative samples at random, we select negative samples that match the amount of displacement that the true match (the positive sample) undergoes, as is illustrated in Fig. 1. Second, we suggest gradually increasing the difficulty of the\nnegative samples during training. In the implementation of the second component, scheduling samples by difficulty, we combine two methods well known in the literature. The curriculum learning method [6] selects samples, stratified by difficulty, using a predefined order. The method of self-paced learning [24] identifies a set of easy samples by their loss, and learns using only those samples. The amount of samples defined as easy is increased over time. The Self-Paced-CurriculumInterleaving method we propose here combines in the selection process both the difficulty of a sample and its loss. However, in difference from the self-paced method, no samples are excluded during training. Instead, we control the level of the difficulty of instances used for training by selecting negative samples of appropriate distances.\nThe pipeline employed for computing optical flow is similar to the PatchBatch method [13].

      "text" : "Many computer vision tasks require a pixel-wise image comparison (e.g. image retrieval, object recognition, multi-view reconstruction). To allow for the comparison to be invariant to scale, rotation, illumination, etc., image descriptors such as SIFT [28], SURF [5], HOG [10], and DAISY [35] have been used. Brox and Malik were the first to apply local descriptors to the problem of dense optical flow [7]. They found that the use of descriptors enables better performance for large displacement matching, but that the obtained solution has many outliers due to missing regularization constraints. In order to account for this, they used descriptors to build a sparse initial flow and interpolate it to a dense one using image smoothness assumptions. Following their success, many other models adopted the use of local descriptors [39, 30, 20, 34].\nWith the advent of deep learning methods, CNNs were shown to be extremely powerful in the related problem of stereo matching [33, 41]. For optical flow, a few CNN based models were proposed. In [37], a CNN is used to predict the flow from a single static image. FlowNet [11] is the first end-to-end CNN for optical flow and showed competitive results. In the PatchBatch [13] pipeline, a CNN was used for extracting patch descriptors that are then used for matching via the PatchMatch [4] Nearest Neighbor Field (NNF) algorithms. It achieved state of the art performance in the KITTI benchmarks [15, 29] as of last year.\nWhile the use of descriptors has greatly improved overall performance and accuracy, methods keep failing with large displacements, as we further discuss in Section 4. To solve this problem, extensive efforts have been devoted to methods for the integration of descriptors with local assumptions [7, 34, 30]. However, much less work was done in making the descriptors themselves more suitable for this scenario. A concurrent work [3], focused on decreasing the error for large displacements by down-sampling patches and adding a threshold to the loss function. However, this comes at the cost of reducing the accuracy obtained for small displacements.\nIn our work, we follow the PatchBatch pipeline and use a CNN to extract descriptors. We expand the work by analyzing different matching cases, specifically those of small and large displacements, and present a method for generating better matching descriptors for both cases."

      "text" : "The need for multiple strategies was found in several vision problems where the basic trained model could not optimize the solution for all sub-categories. An example is the work of Antipov et al. [1] for age estimation. Unsatisfied by the accuracy of the model for children of age 0-12, they train a sub-model only for those ages and employ it to samples that are classified as this category by another model that is run first.\nAnother common case is in fine-grained classification, e.g. determining the exact model of a car or a particular species of bird. The subtle differences between nearby species require, for example, to focus on specific body regions. However, different distinctions require different body parts and we can consider each body part as a separate decision strategy.\nIn order to achieve the required accuracy, some methods perform object segmentation [23] or part detection [22] to limit the search of each sub-class to the most relevant body parts. A different approach was shown in [14], where several models were trained on different samples to create per class expert models. At test time, the answer with the highest confidence is chosen. The latter approach achieved better results due to each model leveraging all of the input data, and learning individually the required features to gain expertise in its task."

      "text" : "Curriculum learning [6], inspired by the learning process of humans, was the first method to manipulate the order of samples shown to the model during training. Specifically, it is suggested to present the easy training samples first and the harder samples later, after performing stratification based on the difficulty level.\nIn self-paced learning [24], instead of using a predefined order, the difficulty of each sample is dynamically estimated during training by inspecting the associated loss. On each epoch, only the easier samples are being learned from and their amount is increased with time until the entire data is considered. In the work of [19], those two methods were combined to allow a prior knowledge of samples difficulty to be considered in the self-paced iterations.\nIt was recently proposed to eliminate from the training process samples that are either too easy or too hard [36]. For this purpose, specific percentiles on the loss were employed. Samples which did not meet the loss criteria were put aside for a predefined number of epochs.\nIn the problem of optical flow, large displacements are known to be more challenging. Moreover, as we show in Section 4, the descriptor extraction strategy should differ by displacement. Due to the correlation between the difficulty level and the required strategy, applying the existing gradual learning methods could result in acquiring specific strategies in different training stages with the possibility of unwanted carryover. In Section 5, we suggest novel learning techniques, which use all samples, support different strategies and apply an easy to hard order."

      "text" : "The PatchBatch (PB) pipeline, as described in Fig. 2, consists of a CNN which generates per-pixel descriptors and an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm which is later used to compute the actual assignments. PatchBatch’s ACCURATE network configuration generates descriptors with 512 float values. The assignment is computed by minimizing the L2 distance between descriptor vectors. To create each pixel’s descriptor, the CNN uses a patch as an input. In most of the CNN configurations described in PatchBatch, the input is a 51 × 51 patch centered around the examined pixel. The CNN uses the grayscale data of the patch to extract a descriptor as similar as possible to the one extracted for the matching pixel on the second image.\nUsing the generated descriptors, PatchMatch [4] (PM) algorithm is used to compute initial flow assignments. PM is applied in both flow directions and is followed by a bidirectional consistency check that allows elimination of nonconsistent matches.\nIn the final step, the sparse-to-dense EpicFlow [32] (EF) algorithm creates the final estimation using the sparse flow and the original raw images. We refer the reader to the\nPatchBatch [13] paper and the published code1 for a more detailed description."

First, we adopt the suggestion, that was partially tested in the original PB paper [13], to enlarge the patch size from 51×51 to 71×71 pixels. Second, to improve the training of the network we use two novelties: (1) We introduce a new learning method for multiple displacements detailed in Section 5. (2) We modify the loss function and use a new form of the Hinge loss. Third, we altered the initial random guess range of the PM algorithm on MPI-Sintel to be 100 instead of 10, to allow larger search distance and better utilization of our large displacements descriptors. For the KITTI benchmarks, this parameter remained unchanged (500)."

To allow the use of this loss, we construct the samples as triplets. For each patch, we collect a matching patch by the ground truth and a non-matching one. As a baseline, we use the same non-matching collecting method, which is a random patch up to 8 pixels from the matching one.\nWe define the loss function as:\nLH = 1\nn n∑ i=1 max(0,m+Di,match −Di,non−match)\n(1) where D is theL2 distance of the examined patch descriptor from the matching or non-matching one.\nIn the PatchBatch paper, an addition of a standard deviation parameter was found to produce better distinction between matching and non-matching samples. With that inspiration, we apply a similar addition to the Hinge loss:\nLH+SD = λLH + (1− λ)(σDmatch + σDnon−match) (2)\nWe used m = 100, λ = 0.8 and a training set of n = 50k triplets for each epoch."

      "text" : "It is clear by examining the results of the common optical flow benchmarks that optical flow methods are challenged by large displacements. In the MPI-Sintel [8], where results are separated by the velocity of pixels, the current average end-point-error (EPE) of the top 10 ranked methods is 35.47\n1https://github.com/DediGadot/PatchBatch\nfor velocities higher than 40, while it is about 1.01 for velocities lower than 10. In KITTI2015 [29], there is no published estimation by velocity. However, there is separation of foreground vs. background regions. The current average outliers percentage for the top 10 methods is 26.43% for foreground versus 11.43% for background, which, assuming foreground objects typically move faster than background, supports the same observation. When evaluating the baseline PatchBatch model on a validating set, we notice an error (percent of pixels with euclidean error > 3) of 4.90% for displacements smaller than 10 and 42.15% for displacements larger than 40.\nThe challenge of matching at larger distances is exemplified in Fig. 3, which shows the L2 distance of the true match as a function of the ground truth displacement. Furthermore, as the distance increases, the average number of distractors in the second image, with higher similarity to patch in the first image than the true match, increases. This counting is performed in a radius of 25 pixels around the true match and is shown in Tab. 1 under the Baseline training set."

      "text" : "When training the PatchBatch network only on displacements that are smaller than 30, we are able to improve most cases of small displacements, while, in most cases increasing the number of nearby distractors for large displacements. Conversely, training only on displacements larger than 30 pixels, achieved a lower amount of distractors for large displacements (Tab. 1). However, since there is no\nmechanism for selecting between the two networks, it is best to train one network that addresses both scenarios. Interestingly, when training just one network on all samples, the network seems to outperform the two specialized networks in the domain of very small displacements. This is probably a result of designing the PatchBatch method to excel in benchmarks that emphasize this category.\nLarge displacements are typically associated with larger differences in appearance, as demonstrated in Fig.4. Differences in the patch appearance for the small displacement case typically arise from objects moving within the patch faster than the middle pixel. In contrast, in large motions, we can expect much more pronounced changes in appearance due to the following: (1) As fast objects move, their background is more likely to change. (2) The view point changes more drastically, which leads to different object parts being occluded. (3) The distance and angle to light sources vary more quickly, leading to a change in illumination. (4) When a significant displacement occurs along the Z-axis of the camera, the object changes in both position and scale."

For applying curriculum learning [6], the samples need to be stratified by difficulty prior to training. Followed our previous findings, we define the difficulty level as the displacement value in the ground truth and\nincrease the maximum displacement of the sample pool in each epoch which we call curriculum by displacement.\nAnother curriculum implementation, which we call curriculum by distance, would be to use samples with all displacement values for each epoch, and to start the training using false samples that have a large euclidean distance in the image from the true matching. Decreasing that distance with training should provide harder false samples with time.\nWe also implement a self-paced model by learning only from the easy samples in each epoch. Easiness here is measured per sample by requiring a loss that is lower than a threshold. This threshold is increased as training progresses."

      "heading" : "5.1. Interleaving learning",
      "text" : "Both the curriculum learning approach as well as the self-paced one utilize the difficulty diversification of the samples and suggest to learn from easy to hard. While this idea might seem appealing, and does work in many machine learning problems, it could cause the network to become overly adapted to different aspects of the problem at different training stages. In optical flow, models must excel in the low displacement task in order to be competitive. Therefore, the shift of attention to harder and harder tasks is potentially detrimental. In addition, if different strategies are required, the carryover from the easy task to the more challenging ones is not obvious.\nOur approach is motivated by psychological research. Kornell and Bjork, psychology researchers, found that for some cases, interleaving exemplars of different categories can enhance inductive learning [21]. Their tests showed that people learn better to distinguish classes, e.g. bird species, by learning in an interleaving sample order rather than blocks of the same class. Another example would be sports training, in which it is common to interleave simple basic exercises with more complex ones, incorporating at least part of the complex movements from very early, and going back to the basic movements even after these are mastered.\nInspired by their research, we present an interleaving learning method for machine learning. The idiomatic way of training ML models is to randomize the feeding order of the samples. When perceptual strategies and difficulty levels are unrelated, the random process might be sufficient. However, when the samples that require some strategy A are consistently harder than the ones required for strategy B, the frequent loss related to the samples associated with A would mean that the strategy B would be deprived of a training signal.\nTo preserve a random order of strategies, and, at the same time, facilitate the penalty of harder samples, we suggest that the learning process should consider the difficulty of each sample. This could be done by either taking the difficulty of the sample into account while computing the\npenalty or, when training by pairs or triplets of samples, by controlling the composition of these small reference groups."

      "text" : "The implementation of our model was done by using further patches as false samples for larger displacements. Thus, for the harder case of large displacements, we select false samples that should be easier to distinguish from the true ones and normalize the overall difficulty. From the strategy point of view, by presenting further away negatives for large displacements, the model learns to rely more on context and less on appearance changes for large displacements and conversely for small ones.\nThe chosen false sample distance is determined by:\nd = v(1−X) X ∼ logN (µ, σ) (3)\nP (X = x) = 1\nσx √ 2π e(−\n(ln(x)−µ)2\n2σ2 ) (4)\nwhere v is the displacement of the matching pixels and X is sampled from a log-normal distribution [31].\nUsing a log-normal distribution, allows us to take samples mostly relative to the exemplar motion while also providing a small amount of harder samples. We used µ = 0 and σ = 1 as parameters and after sampling values for all of the batch samples, they were normalized to [0, 1].\nTo implement this method in our learning process, we collect the false sample along the line connecting the original and the destined coordinates of the patch. Specifically, we randomly select a sample from a radius of up to 8 pixels from the point with distance d from the true match on that line, in the direction of the position in the first image (see Fig. 5). Interestingly, for the purpose of creating dual strategy descriptors, it does not matter whether the samples are from along the motion line. However, in our experiments, it turned out that sampling this way slightly helps the subsequent PM step. This is probably because PM initially searches in a random distance from the original patch position. By taking a false match that is closer to the original location, we help eliminate those samples."

In order to maintain the category diversity, we simply modify the distance equation for epoch i to:\ndi = v(1−X −Ri) (5)\nwhere Ri is define as:\nRi = i\nm︸︷︷︸ curriculum\n·max(0, 1− li−1 linit\n)︸ ︷︷ ︸ self-paced\n(6)\nand m is the total epoch amount, li is the loss on epoch i and linit is some initial loss to compare. We took linit as the loss from epoch number 5. Until that epoch, self-pacing is not applied.\nThe curriculum addition enhances the global difficulty of false samples in each iteration by shorting the taken distance and, therefore, integrates an instructor-driven approach assuming the student will handle more difficult tasks with time. To add a student-driven portion, we use the self-paced component which allows a feedback from the model to influence the difficulty of the next iteration. Integrating all of this together, we get a learning method that learns all strategies simultaneously and in which the difficulty is increased over iterations and with a success feedback."

This data set consists of images showing a digit from 0 to 9 with their true label. We divided the data into two different classes – class L contains digits 0..4 and class H contains 5..9 . To enable difficulty differentiation between samples, random noise was added to the top half of the images of H and to the bottom part of the L images. Furthermore, images from class H were rotated by a random angle of [0, 45] degrees with correlation to the noise amount, such that, samples that are more noisy are also rotated in larger angles.\nWhile referring noisier samples as harder, we trained a model using several methods. As curriculum learning, harder samples were added to the training pool in each epoch. In the self-paced model, the hardness of the samples to learn from was derived from the loss. Interleaving was implemented by using all of the noise range level in each epoch with a fewer noised samples for the harder H class against more for L class. An integration of interleaving with Curriculum and Self-Paced methods was also used by increasing the the amount of the noised H samples in each epoch.

We use their data to conduct a series of experiments to measure the effect of each of our contributions and to submit our best results to compare with other methods.\nBy training the different models on a subset of 80% from the KITTI2012 dataset for 500 epochs and testing the results on the remaining 20% image pairs, we show a comparison of the models summarized in Tab. 2. Note that lower PatchMatch (PM) error is not always correlated with lower EpicFlow (EF) error because of the bidirectional consistency check that excludes some inconsistent results to generate a sparse flow as an input for EF.\nObserving Tab. 2, one can notice that the use of the Hinge loss instead of CENT [13], improved the PM results and has no such effect on the final EF output. However, combining with the batch standard deviation term (SD) and our interleaving learning (Inter) leads to an advantage of the Hinge loss. Our interleaving learning method outperforms both Curriculum learning and Self-Paced learning. The SPCI technique contributes an additional improvement. Integrating all of our architecture modifications with SPCI produces the lowest error percent on the validation set with a major improvement on the initial baseline. Moreover, the amount of nearby distractors with descriptors that are more similar to the original patch than the true match is reduced in more than a third from the baseline.\nAs a sanity-check experiment we evaluate an AntiInterleaving method. In this method, negative matches from different ranges were also used. However, the ratio was inverted – true matches of small displacements were matched with false samples with large distances and vice versa. The high error of this model, as can be seen in Tab. 2, implies that the use of different ranges for false matches was not the\nmain benefit of the interleaving method and it is the correlation with the displacement values that is the crucial factor."

Those patches that are similar to patches that are associated with small displacements are treated differently than those which were associated, in the training set, with large displacements. To illustrate this, and compare the various learning methods, we explore the model behavior on nearby patches from the same image for varied displacement ranges. First, we measure the average distance d̄0−5 of a patch descriptor from that of a patch that is 5 pixels away for pixels which undergo a displacement of up to 5 pixels. Note that for a 51 × 51 patch, only 18% of the pixels were completely replaced in such a small displacement. Then, we repeat this to patches from various displacement ranges, taking again the average distance from a patch of 5 pixels away. To normalize, we divide this average distance by the first average d̄L−H d̄0−5\n, for (L,H) ∈ {(5, 10), (10, 40), (40, inf)}. The results in Tab. 4 show that while the PatchBatch original model reacts almost similarly for all displacement ranges, interleaving trained models have learned to be less sensitive to appearance changes for larger displacements. Moreover, using only gradual learning, leads to high sensitivity across all ranges. This can be the result of the carry-on from the early learning stages on small displacements where appearance sensitivity is more valuable."

We then study the implications of this observation on training a deep neural network for representing image patches in the context of descriptor based optical flow. We propose a metric learning method, which selects suitable negative samples based on the nature of the true match. This type of training produces a network that displays multiple strategies depending on the input and leads to state of the art results on the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 optical flow benchmarks.",
