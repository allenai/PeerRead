      "text" : "Shifts in word meaning exhibit systematic regularities (Bréal, 1897; Ullmann, 1962). The rate of semantic change, for example, is higher in some words than others (Blank, 1999) — compare the stable semantic history of cat (from ProtoGermanic kattuz, “cat”) to the varied meanings of English cast: “to mould”, “a collection of actors’, “a hardened bandage”, etc. (all from Old Norse kasta, “to throw”, Simpson et al., 1989).\nVarious hypotheses have been offered about such regularities in semantic change, such as an increasing subjectification of meaning, or the grammaticalization of inferences (e.g., Geeraerts, 1997; Blank, 1999; Traugott and Dasher, 2001).\nBut many core questions about semantic change remain unanswered. One is the role of frequency. Frequency plays a key role in other linguistic changes, associated sometimes with faster change—sound changes like lenition occur in more frequent words—and sometimes with slower change—high frequency words are more resistant to morphological regularization (Bybee, 2007; Pagel et al., 2007; Lieberman et al., 2007). What is the role of word frequency in meaning change?\nAnother unanswered question is the relationship between semantic change and polysemy. Words gain senses over time as they semantically drift (Bréal, 1897; Wilkins, 1993; Hopper and Traugott, 2003), and polysemous words1 occur in more diverse contexts, affecting lexical access speed (Adelman et al., 2006) and rates of L2 learning (Crossley et al., 2010). But we don’t know whether the diverse contextual use of polysemous words makes them more or less likely to undergo change (Geeraerts, 1997; Winter et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015). Furthermore, polysemy is strongly correlated with frequency—high frequency words have more senses (Zipf, 1945; İlgen and Karaoglan, 2007)—so understanding how polysemy relates to semantic change requires controling for word frequency.\nAnswering these questions requires new methods that can go beyond the case-studies of a few words (often followed over widely different timeperiods) that are our most common diachronic data (Bréal, 1897; Ullmann, 1962; Blank, 1999; Hopper and Traugott, 2003; Traugott and Dasher, 2001). One promising avenue is the use of distributional semantics, in which words are embedded in vector spaces according to their co-occurrence relationships (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Turney and Pantel, 2010), and the embeddings of words\n1We use ‘polysemy’ here to refer to related senses as well as rarer cases of accidental homonymy.\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n09 09\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\n0 M\nay 2\n01 6\nare then compared across time-periods. This new direction has been effectively demonstrated in a number of case-studies (Sagi et al., 2011; Wijaya and Yeniterzi, 2011; Gulordava and Baroni, 2011; Jatowt and Duh, 2014) and used to perform largescale linguistic change-point detection (Kulkarni et al., 2014) as well as to test a few specific hypotheses, such as whether English synonyms tend to change meaning in similar ways (Xu and Kemp, 2015). However, these works employ widely different embedding approaches and test their approaches only on English.\nIn this work, we develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change using embeddings by comparing state-of-the-art approaches (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) on novel benchmarks.\nWe then apply this methodology in a large-scale cross-linguistic analysis using 6 corpora spanning 200 years and 4 languages (English, German, French, and Chinese). Based on this analysis, we propose two statistical laws relating frequency and polysemy to semantic change: • The law of conformity: Rates of semantic\nchange scale with a negative power of word frequency. • The law of innovation: After controlling for\nfrequency, polysemous words have significantly higher rates of semantic change."

The p̂ correspond to the smoothed empirical probabilities of word (co-)occurrences within fixed-size sliding windows of text. Clipping the PPMI values above zero ensures they remain finite and has been shown to dramatically improve results (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007; Levy et al., 2015); intuitively, this clipping ensures that the representations emphasize positive word-word correlations over negative ones.\n3Synchronic applications of these three methods are reviewed in detail in Levy et al.

This SVD approach can be viewed as a generalization of Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), where the term-document matrix is replaced with MPPMI.

First, we tested whether the methods capture known historical shifts in meaning. The goal in this task is for the methods to correctly capture whether pairs of words moved closer or further apart in semantic space during a pre-determined time-period. We use a set of independently attested shifts as an evaluation set (Table 2). For comparison, we evaluated the methods on both the large (but messy) ENGALL data and the smaller (but clean) COHA data. On this task, all the methods performed almost perfectly in terms of capturing the correct directionality of the shifts (i.e., the pairwise similarity series have the correct sign on their Spearman correlation with time), but there were\nsome differences in whether the methods deemed the shifts statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level.7 Overall, SGNS performed the best on the full English data, but its performance dropped significantly on the smaller COHA dataset, where SVD performed best. PPMI was noticeably worse than the other two approaches (Table 3).\nDiscovering shifts from data. We tested whether the methods discover reasonable shifts by examining the top-10 words that changed the most from the 1900s to the 1990s according to the semantic displacement metric introduced in Section 2.4 (limiting our analysis to words with relative frequencies above 10−5 in both decades). We used the ENGFIC data as the most-changed list for ENGALL was dominated by scientific terms due to changes in the corpus sample.\nTable 4 shows the top-10 words discovered by each method. SGNS performed by far the best on this task, with 70% of its top-10 list corresponding to genuine semantic shifts, followed by 40% for SVD, and 10% for PPMI. However, a large portion of the discovered words for PPMI (and less so SVD) correspond to borderline cases, e.g. know,\n7All subsequent significance tests are at p < 0.05.\nthat have not necessarily shifted significantly in meaning but that occur in different contexts due to global genre/discourse shifts. The poor quality of the nearest neighbors generated by the PPMI algorithm—which are skewed by PPMI’s sensitivity to rare events—also made it difficult to assess the quality of its discovered shifts. SVD was the most sensitive to corpus artifacts (e.g., co-occurrences due to cover pages and advertisements), but it still captured a number of genuine semantic shifts.\nTable 5 details representative example shifts in English, French, and German. Chinese lacks sufficient historical data for this task, as only years 1950-1999 are usable; however, we do still see some significant changes for Chinese in this short time-period, such as 病毒 (“virus”) moving closer to电脑 (“computer”, ρ = 0.89)."

Between SVD and SGNS the results are somewhat equivocal, as both perform best on two out of the four tasks (synchronic accuracy, ENGALL detection, COHA detection, discovery). Overall, SVD performs best on the synchronic accuracy task and has higher average accuracy on the ‘detection’ task, while SGNS performs best on the ‘discovery’ task. These results suggest that both these methods are reasonable choices for studies of semantic change but that they each have their own tradeoffs: SVD is more sensitive, as it performs well on detection tasks even when using a small dataset, but this sensitivity also results in false discoveries due to corpus artifacts. In contrast, SGNS\nis robust to corpus artifacts in the discovery task, but it is not sensitive enough to perform well on the detection task with a small dataset.

      "text" : "We show how distributional methods can reveal statistical laws of semantic change and offer a robust methodology for future work in this area.\nThe two statistical laws we propose have strong implications for future work in historical semantics. The law of conformity—frequent words change more slowly—clarifies frequency’s role in semantic change. Future studies of semantic change must account for frequency’s conforming effect: when examining the interaction between some linguistic process and semantic change, the law of conformity should serve as a null model in which the interaction is driven primarily by underlying frequency effects. The\nlaw of innovation—polysemous words change more quickly—quantifies the central role polysemy plays in semantic change, an issue that has concerned linguists for more than 100 years (Bréal, 1897). Previous works argued that semantic change leads to polysemy (Wilkins, 1993; Hopper and Traugott, 2003), but our results suggest that polysemy may actually play a causal role in inducing semantic change. Overall, these two factors explain between 48% and 88% of the variance10 in rates of semantic change (across conditions). This remarkable degree of explanatory power indicates that frequency and polysemy are perhaps the two most crucial linguistic factors that explain rates of semantic change over time.\nThese empirical statistical laws also lend themselves to various causal mechanisms. The law of conformity might be a consequence of learning: perhaps people are more likely to use rare words mistakenly in novel ways, a mechanism formalizable by Bayesian models of word learning and corresponding to the biological notion of genetic drift (Reali and Griffiths, 2010). Or perhaps a sociocultural conformity bias makes people less likely to accept novel innovations of common words, a mechanism analogous to the biological process of purifying selection (Boyd and Richerson, 1988; Pagel et al., 2007). Moreover, such mechanisms may also be partially responsible for the law of innovation. Highly polysemous words tend to have more rare senses (Kilgarriff, 2004), and rare senses may be unstable by the law of conformity. While our results cannot confirm such causal links, they nonetheless highlight a new role for frequency and polysemy in language change and the importance of distributional models in historical research.\n10Marginal R2 (Nakagawa and Schielzeth, 2013)."

For the Google datasets we built models using the top-100000 words by their average frequency over the entire historical time-periods, and we used the top-50000 for COHA. During model learning we also discarded all words within a year that occurred below a certain threshold (500 for the Google data, 100 for the COHA data).\nFor all methods, we used the hyperparameters recommended in Levy et al. (2015). For the context word distributions in all methods, we used context distribution smoothing with a smoothing parameter of 0.75. Note that for SGNS this corresponds to smoothing the unigram negative sampling distribution. For both, SGNS and PPMI, we set the negative sample prior α = log(5), while we set this value to α = 0 for SVD, as this improved results. When using SGNS on the Google data, we also subsampled, with words being random removed with probability pr(wi) = 1 − √ 10−5\nf(wi) , as\nrecommended by Levy et al. (2015) and Mikolov et al. (2013). Furthermore, to improve the computational efficiency of SGNS (which works with text streams and not co-occurrence counts), we downsampled the larger years in the Google NGram data to have at most 109 tokens. No such subsampling was performed on the COHA data.\nFor all methods, we defined the context set to simply be the same vocabulary as the target words, as is standard in most word vector applications (Levy et al., 2015). However, we found that the PPMI method benefited substantially from larger contexts (similar results were found in Bullinaria and Levy, 2007), so we did not remove any lowfrequency words per year from the context for that method. The other embedding approaches did not appear to benefit from the inclusion of these lowfrequency terms, so they were dropped for computational efficiency.\nFor SGNS, we used the implementation provided in Levy et al. (2015). The implementations for PPMI and SVD are released with the code package associated with this work.\nB Visualization algorithm\nTo visualize semantic change for a word wi in two dimensions we employed the following procedure, which relies on the t-SNE embedding method (Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) as a subroutine:\n1. Find the union of the word wi’s k nearest neighbors over all necessary time-points.\n2. Compute the t-SNE embedding of these words on the most recent (i.e., the modern) time-point.\n3. For each of the previous time-points, hold all embeddings fixed, except for the target word’s (i.e., the embedding for wi), and optimize a new t-SNE embedding only for the target word. We found that initializing the embedding for the target word to be the centroid of its k′-nearest neighbors in a timepoint was highly effective.\nThus, in this procedure the background words are always shown in their “modern” positions, which makes sense given that these are the current meanings of these words. This approximation is necessary, since in reality all words are moving. Code for this procedure is included in the paper’s release."

We removed stop words and proper nouns by (i) removing all stop-words from the available lists in Python’s NLTK package (Bird et al., 2009) and (ii) restricting our analysis to words with part-of-speech (POS) tags corresponding to four main linguistic categories (common nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives), using the POS sources in Table 1.\nWhen analyzing the effects of frequency and contextual diversity, the model contained fixed effects for these features and for time along with random effects for word identity. We opted not to control for POS tags in the presented results, as contextual diversity is co-linear with these tags (e.g., adverbs are more contextual diverse than nouns), and the goal was to demonstrate the main effect of contextual diversity across all word types. That said, the effect of contextual diversity remained strong and significantly positive in all datasets even after controlling for POS tags.\nTo fit the linear mixed models, we used the Python statsmodels package with restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) (Seabold and Perktold, 2010).

Word embeddings show promise as a diachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity—the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation—independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.",
