On each round of the game, the player chooses an action Xt from an action set X , the ad-\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nversary chooses a loss function ft, and the player suffers a loss of ft(Xt). We often assume that ft(Xt) is bounded in [0, 1]. The player observes the loss value ft(Xt) and uses it to update its strategy for subsequent rounds. Unlike the full-information player, the bandit player does not observe the entire loss function ft. The player’s goal is to accumulate the smallest possible loss over T rounds of play.\nWhile this presentation is intuitively appealing, it hides the details on what information the adversary may use when choosing ft. Since this aspect of the problem is the main focus of our paper, we opt for a less common, yet entirely equivalent, definition of the online bandit problem.\nWe think of online prediction with bandit feedback as an iterative process where only the player makes active choices on each round. The adversary, on the other hand, prepares his entire sequence of loss functions in advance. To ensure that this assumption does not weaken the adversary, we make the additional assumption that the loss function ft takes, as input, the player’s entire sequence of past and current actions (X1, . . . , Xt), which we abbreviate by X1,...,t. More formally, for each t, Ft is a class of loss functions from X t to the unit interval [0, 1], and the adversary chooses each ft from the respective class Ft.\nWe model the player as a randomized algorithm that defines a distribution over X on each round and samples Xt from this distribution. Therefore, even though ft is a deterministic function fixed in advance, the loss ft(X1,...,t) is a bounded random variable. The player observes the value of this random variable and nothing else, and uses this value to define a new distribution over the action space.\nInteresting special cases of online learning with bandit feedback are the k-armed bandit (Robbins, 1952; Auer et al., 2002), bandit convex optimization (Kleinberg, 2004; Flaxman et al., 2005; Abernethy et al., 2008), and bandit submodular minimization (Hazan & Kale, 2009). In the k-armed bandit problem, the action space X is the discrete set {1, . . . , k} and each Ft contains all functions from X t to [0, 1]. In bandit convex optimization, X is a predefined convex set and each Ft is the set of functions that are convex in their last argument. A special case of bandit convex optimization is bandit linear optimization (Awerbuch & Kleinberg, 2004; Bartlett et al., 2008), where the functions in Ft are linear in their last argument. In bandit submodular minimization, X is the power-set of {1, . . . , k} and each Ft contains all of the functions that are submodular in their last argument.\nVarious different adversary types have been proposed in the literature (Borodin & El-Yaniv, 1998; CesaBianchi & Lugosi, 2006). All adversary types are strategic and possibly malicious, have unlimited computational power, and are free to use random bits when choosing their loss functions. If the adversary is not restricted beyond the setting described above, he is called an adaptive adversary. Other adversary types are restricted in various ways. For example, an oblivious adversary is restricted to choose a sequence of loss functions such that each ft is oblivious to the first t−1 arguments in its input. In other words, ft can only be a function of the current action. Formally,\nft(x1, . . . , xt) = ft(x ′ 1, . . . , x ′ t−1, xt) ,\nfor all x1, . . . , xt and x ′ 1, . . . , x ′ t−1 in X .\nThe expected cumulative loss suffered by the player after T rounds (which we abbreviate simply as loss) is\nE [∑T t=1 ft(X1,...,t) ] . To evaluate how good this loss is, we compare it to a baseline. To this end, we choose a competitor class CT , which is simply a set of deterministic action sequences of length T . Intuitively, we would like to compare the player’s loss with the cumulative loss of the best action sequence in CT . In practice, the most common way to evaluate the player’s performance is to measure his external pseudo-regret compared to CT (Auer et al., 2002) (which we abbreviate as regret), defined as\nmax (y1,...,yT )∈CT\nE [ T∑ t=1 ft(X1,...,t)− ft(X1,...,t−1, yt) ] . (1)\nMost of the theoretical work on online learning uses this definition, both in the bandit setting (e.g., (Auer et al., 2002; Awerbuch & Kleinberg, 2004; Kleinberg,\n2004; Flaxman et al., 2005; Bartlett et al., 2008; Abernethy et al., 2008; Hazan & Kale, 2009)) and in the full information setting (e.g., (Zinkevich, 2003; CesaBianchi & Lugosi, 2006; Hazan et al., 2006; Blum & Mansour, 2007; Hazan & Kale, 2009)).\nIf the adversary is oblivious, regret has a simple and intuitive meaning. In this special case, we can slightly overload our notation and rewrite ft(x1, . . . , xt) as ft(xt). With this simplified notation, the regret defined in Eq. (1) becomes\nE [ T∑ t=1 ft(Xt) ] − min (y1,...,yT )∈CT T∑ t=1 ft(yt) .\nThe above is the difference between the player’s loss and the loss of the best sequence in the competitor class CT . Intuitively, this difference measures how much the player regrets choosing his action-sequence over the best sequence in CT .\nHowever, if the adversary is adaptive, this simple intuition no longer applies, and the standard notion of regret losses much of its meaning. To observe the problem, note that if the player would have chosen a sequence from the competitor class, say (y1, . . . , yT ), then his loss would have been∑T t=1 ft(y1, . . . , yt). However, the definition of regret in Eq. (1) instead compares the player’s loss to the\nterm E [∑T t=1 ft(X1,...,t−1, yt) ] . We can attempt to articulate the meaning of this term: it is the loss in the peculiar situation where the adversary reacts to the player’s original sequence (X1, . . . , XT ), but the player somehow manages to secretly play the sequence (yi, . . . , yT ). This is not a feasible situation and it is unclear why this quantity is an interesting baseline for comparison.\nAs designers of online learning algorithms, we actually have two different ways to obtain a small regret: we can either design an algorithm that attempts to minimize its loss ∑T t=1 ft(X1,...,t), or we can cheat\nby designing an algorithm that attempts to maximize∑T t=1 ft(X1,...,t−1, yt). For example, consider an algorithm that identifies an action to which the adversary always responds (on the next round) with a loss function that constantly equals 1 (here we use our assumption that the adversary may play any strategy, not necessarily the most malicious one). Repeatedly playing that action would cause regret to asymptote to a constant (the best possible outcome), since the player’s loss would grow at an identical rate to the loss of all of its competitors. While this algorithm minimizes regret, it certainly isn’t learning how to choose good actions. It is merely learning how to make its competitors look bad.\nThe problem described above seems to be largely overlooked in the online learning literature, with the exception of two important yet isolated papers (Merhav et al., 2002; de Farias & Megiddo, 2006). To overcome this problem, we define the policy regret of the player as the difference between his loss after T rounds and the loss that he would have suffered had he played the best sequence from a competitor class. Policy regret captures the idea that the adversary may react differently to different action sequences. We focus on the bandit setting and start with the class of constantaction competitors. We first prove a negative result: no online bandit algorithm can guarantee a sublinear policy regret. However, if the adversary has a bounded memory, we show how a simple mini-batching technique converts an online bandit algorithm with a regret bound of O(T q) into an algorithm with a policy regret bound of O(T 1/(2−q)). We use this technique to derive a policy-regret bound of O(T 2/3) for the karmed bandit problem, O(T 4/5) for bandit convex optimization, O(T 3/4) for bandit linear optimization (or O(T 2/3) if the player knows the adversary’s memory size), and O(T 3/4) for bandit submodular optimization. We then extend our technique to other notions of regret, namely, switching regret, internal regret, and swap regret."

      "text" : "The pioneering work of Merhav et al. (2002) addresses the problem discussed above in the experts setting (the full-information version of the k-armed bandit problem) and presents a concrete full-information algorithm with a policy regret of O(T 2/3) against memorybounded adaptive adversaries. Our work extends and improves on Merhav et al. (2002) in various ways. First, Merhav et al. (2002) are not explicit about the shortcomings of the standard regret definition. Second, note that a bandit algorithm can always be run in the full-information setting (by ignoring the extra feedback) so all of our results also apply to the fullinformation setting and can be compared to those of Merhav et al. (2002). While Merhav et al. (2002) present one concrete algorithm with a policy regret bound, we show a general technique that endows any existing bandit algorithm with a policy regret bound. Despite the wider scope of our result, our proofs are simpler and shorter than those in Merhav et al. (2002) and our bound is just as good. Our extensions to switching regret, internal regret, and swap regret are also entirely novel.\nThe work of de Farias & Megiddo (2006) is even more closely related to ours as it presents a family of algorithms that deal with adaptive adversaries in the\nbandit setting. However, it is difficult to compare the results in de Farias & Megiddo (2006) with our results. While we stick with the widely accepted notion of online regret, de Farias & Megiddo (2006) forsake the notion of regret and instead analyze their algorithms using a non-standard formalization. Moreover, their analysis makes the assumption that the true value of any constant action can be estimated by repeating that action for a sufficiently large number of rounds, at any point in the game.\nThe reinforcement learning (RL) literature is also related to our work, at least in spirit. Specifically, the PAC-MDP framework (Szepesvári, 2010, section 2.4.2) models the player’s state on each round; typically, there is a finite number S of states and the player’s actions both incur a loss and cause him to transition from one state to another. The PAC-MDP bounds typically hold when the comparison is with all kS policies (mappings from states to actions), not just the k constant-action policies. Our work is still substantially different from RL. The state transitions in RL are often assumed to be stochastic, whereas our setting is adversarial. An adversarial variant of the MDP setting was studied in Even-Dar et al. (2009), however, it assumes that all loss functions across all states are observed by the player. There are recent extensions (Yu et al., 2009; Neu et al., 2010) to the partial feedback or bandit setting but they either give asymptotic rates or make even more stringent assumptions on the underlying state transition dynamics. Also, the dependence on the number of states, S, tends to be of the form Θ(Sα) for some α > 0. In the case of an m-memory bounded adaptive adversary, associating a state with each possible m-length history results in an exponential number of states.\nIn other related work, Ryabko & Hutter (2008) address the question of learnability in a general adaptive stochastic environment. They prove that environments that allow a rapid recovery from mistakes are asymptotically learnable. At a high level, the assumption that the adaptive adversary is memory bounded serves the same purpose. Our results differ from theirs in various ways: we consider adversarial environments rather than stochastic ones, we present a concrete tractable algorithm whereas their algorithm is intractable, and we prove finite-horizon convergence rates while their analysis is asymptotic.\nMore recently, Maillard & Munos (2010) considered adaptive adversaries in the k-armed bandit setting. They define a framework where the set of all actionhistories is partitioned into equivalence classes. For example, assuming that the adversary is m-memory-\nbounded is the same as assuming that two actionhistories with a common suffix of length m are equivalent. Within this framework, they study adversaries whose losses are functions of the equivalence classes and competitors whose actions are functions of the equivalence classes. However, they still use the standard notion of regret and do not address its intuitive problems. As mentioned above, this makes their regret bounds difficult to interpret. Moreover, when faced with an m-memory-bounded adversary, their bounds and running time both grow exponentially with m."

(1) for oblivious adversaries.\nFirst, we show a negative result. Let CT be the set of constant action sequences, namely, sequences of the form (y, . . . , y) for y ∈ X . We prove that it is impossible to obtain a non-trivial (sublinear) upper-bound on policy regret that holds for all adaptive adversaries.\nTheorem 1. For any player there exists an adaptive adversary such that the player’s policy regret compared to the best constant action sequence is Ω(T ).\nProof. Let y ∈ X and p ∈ (0, 1] be such that Pr(X1 = y) = p. Define an adaptive adversary that chooses the loss functions f1(x1) = 0 and\n∀ t ≥ 2 ft(x1, . . . , xt) =\n{ 1 if x1 = y\n0 if x1 6= y .\nAll of the loss functions defined above are constant functions of the current action. From round two and on, the value of the loss function depends entirely on whether the player’s first action was y or not. The player’s expected cumulative loss against this adversary equals pT , since the probability that X1 = y equals p. On the other hand, if the player were to play any constant sequence other than (y, . . . , y), it would accumulate a loss of zero. Therefore, the player’s policy regret is at least pT . For comparison, note that the player’s (standard) regret is zero.\nOther adversarial strategies can cause specific algorithms to suffer a linear regret. For example, the popular EXP3 algorithm (Auer et al., 2002) for the k-armed bandit problem maintains a distribution (p1,t, . . . , pk,t)\nover the k arms on each round. This distribution is a deterministic function of the algorithm’s past observations. If the adversary mimics EXP3’s computations and sets the loss to be ft(j) = pj,t we can prove that this distribution converges to the uniform distribution and EXP3 suffers a linear loss. In contrast, playing any constant arm against this adversary results in a sublinear loss, which implies a linear policy regret.\nGiven that no algorithm can guarantee a small policy regret against all adaptive adversaries, we must restrict the set of possible adversaries. We consider an adversary that lies between oblivious and adaptive: An m-memory-bounded adaptive adversary is an adversary that is constrained to choose loss functions that depend only on the m + 1 most recent actions. Formally,\nft(x1, . . . , xt) = ft(x ′ 1, . . . , x ′ t−m−1, xt−m, . . . , xt) ,\nfor all x1, . . . , xt and x ′ 1, . . . , x ′ t−m−1 in X . An oblivious adversary is 0-memory-bounded, while a general adaptive adversary is ∞-memory-bounded. We note that m-memory-bounded adversaries arrise in many natural scenarios. For example, the friction cost associated with switching from one action to another can be modeled using a 1-memory-bounded adversary.\nFor m-memory-bounded adaptive adversaries we prove a positive result, in the form of a reduction. Again, let the competitor class CT be the set of all constant action sequences of length T . We show how an algorithm A with a sublinear (standard) regret bound against an adaptive adversary can be transformed into another algorithm with a (slightly-inferior) policy regret bound against an m-memory-bounded adaptive adversary. We note that this new algorithm does not need to know m, but m does appear as a constant in our analysis.\nWe define a new algorithm by wrapping A with a minibatching loop (e.g., Dekel et al. (2011)). We specify a batch size τ and name the new algorithm Aτ . The algorithm Aτ groups the online rounds 1, . . . , T into consecutive and disjoint mini-batches of size τ : The j’th mini-batch begins on round (j − 1)τ + 1 and ends on round jτ . At the beginning of mini-batch j, Aτ invokes A and receives an action Zj drawn from A’s internal distribution over the action space. Then, Aτ plays this action for τ rounds, namely, X(j−1)τ+1 = . . . = Xjτ = Zj . During the mini-batch, A does not observe any feedback, does not update its internal state, and is generally unaware that τ rounds are going by. At the end of the mini-batch, Aτ feeds A with a single loss value, the average loss suffered during the mini-batch, 1τ ∑jτ t=(j−1)τ+1 ft(X1,...,t).\nFrom A’s point of view, every mini-batch feels like a single round: it chooses a single action Zj , receives a single loss value as feedback, and updates its internal state once. Put more formally, A is performing standard online learning with bandit feedback against the loss sequence f̂1, . . . , f̂J , where J = bT/τc,\nf̂j(z1, . . . , zj) = 1\nτ τ∑ k=1 f(j−1)τ+k(z τ 1 , ..., z τ j−1, z k j ), (2)\nand zi denotes i repetitions of the action z. By assumption, A’s regret against f̂1, . . . , f̂J is upper bounded by a sublinear function of J . The following theorem transforms this bound into a bound on the policy regret of Aτ . Theorem 2. Let A be an algorithm whose (standard) regret, compared to constant actions, against any sequence of J loss functions generated by an adaptive adversary, is upper bounded by a monotonic function R(J). Let τ > 0 be a mini-batch size and let Aτ be the mini-batched version of A. Let (ft)Tt=1 be a sequence of loss functions generated by an m-memory-bounded adaptive adversary, let X1, . . . , XT be the sequence of actions played by Aτ against this sequence, and let y be any action in X . If τ > m, the policy regret of Aτ , compared to the constant action y, is bounded by\nE [ T∑ t=1 ft(X1,...,t)− ft(yt) ] ≤ τR ( T τ ) + Tm τ + τ.\nSpecifically, if R(J) = CJq + o(Jq) for some C > 0 and q ∈ (0, 1), and τ is set to C −1 2−q T 1−q 2−q , then\nE [ T∑ t=1 ft(X1,...,t)− ft(yt) ] ≤ C ′T 1 2−q + o(T 1 2−q ) ,\nwhere C ′ = (m+ 1)C 1 2−q .\nProof. Assume that τ > m, otherwise the theorem makes no claim. Let J = bT/τc and let ( f̂j )J j=1 be the sequence of loss functions defined in Eq. (2). Let Z1, . . . , ZJ+1 be the sequence of actions played by A against the loss sequence ( f̂j )J j=1 . Our assumption on A implies that\nE  J∑ j=1 f̂j(Z1,...,j)−f̂j(Z1,...,j -1, y)  ≤ R(J). (3) From the definitions of Aτ and f̂j ,\nJ∑ j=1 f̂j(Z1,...,j) = 1 τ Jτ∑ t=1 ft(X1,...,t) . (4)\nIntroducing the notation tj = (j − 1)τ , we rewrite\nJ∑ j=1 f̂j(Z1,...,j -1, y) = 1 τ J∑ j=1 τ∑ k=1 ftj+k(X1,...,tj ,y k). (5)\nFor any j ≤ J , the bound on the loss implies m∑ k=1 ( ftj+k(X1,...,tj ,y k)− ftj+k(ytj+k) ) ≤ m , (6)\nand our assumption that the adversary is m-memorybounded implies\nτ∑ k=m+1 ftj+k(X1,...,tj ,y k) = τ∑ k=m+1 ftj+k(y tj+k). (7)\nCombining Eqs.(5-7) gives the bound\nJ∑ j=1 f̂j(Z1,...,j−1, y) ≤ 1 τ ( Jτ∑ t=1 ft(y t) + Jm ) .\nTogether with Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), we have\nE [ Jτ∑ t=1 ft(X1,...,t)− ft(yt) ] ≤ τR(J) + Jm.\nWe can bound the regret on rounds Jτ + 1, . . . , T by τ . Plugging in J ≤ T/τ gives an overall policy regret bound of τR(T/τ)+Tm/τ+τ . Focusing on the special case where R(J) = CJq + o(Jq), the bound becomes\nCT qτ1−q + Tmτ−1 + τ + o ( T qτ1−q ) .\nPlugging in τ = C −1 2−q T 1−q 2−q concludes the proof."

We begin with the EXP3 algorithm (Auer et al., 2002) in the classic k-armed bandit setting, with its regret bound of √ 7Jk log k against any sequence of J loss functions generated by an adaptive adversary. Applying Thm. 2 with C = √ 7k log k and q = 1/2 proves the following result.\nCorollary 1 (k-armed bandit). Let X = {1, . . . , k} and let Ft consist of all functions from X t to [0, 1].

The algorithm and analysis in Flaxman et al. (2005) guarantees a regret bound of 18d( √ LD+1)J3/4 against any sequence of J loss functions generated by an adaptive adversary, where d is the dimension, D is the diameter of X , and L is the Lipschitz coefficient of the loss functions. Applying Thm. 2 with C = 18d( √ LD + 1) and q = 3/4 proves the following result.\nCorollary 2 (Bandit convex optimization). Let X ⊂ Rd be a closed bounded convex set with diameter D and let Ft be the class of functions from X t to [0, 1] that are convex and L-Lipschitz in their last argument.

The analysis in Dani & Hayes (2006) proves a regret bound of 15dJ2/3 for the algorithm of McMahan & Blum (2004) against any sequence of J loss functions generated by an adaptive adversary. Applying Thm. 2 with C = 15d and q = 2/3 proves the following result.\nCorollary 3 (Bandit linear optimization). Let X ⊂ [−2, 2]d be a polytope (or, more generally, let X ⊆ Rd be a convex set over which linear optimization can be done efficiently). Let Ft be the class of functions from X t to [0, 1] that are linear in their last argument. The policy regret of the mini-batched version of McMahan and Blum’s algorithm (McMahan & Blum, 2004), with batch size τ = (15d)−3/4T 1/4, against an m-memory bounded adaptive adversary is upper bounded by\n(m+ 1)(15dT )3/4 + o(T 3/4).\nFinally, we apply our result to bandit submodular minimization over a ground set {1, . . . , k}. Recall that a set function f is submodular if for any two subsets of the ground set A,B it holds that f(A∪B)+f(A∩B) ≤ f(A) + f(B). The algorithm in Hazan & Kale (2009) has a regret bound of 12kJ2/3 against any sequence of J loss functions generated by an adaptive adversary. Applying Thm. 2 with C = 12k and q = 2/3 proves the following result.\nCorollary 4 (Bandit submodular minimization). Let X be the power set of {1, . . . , k} and let Ft be the class of functions from X t to [0, 1] that are submodular in their last argument. The policy regret of the minibatched version of Hazan and Kale’s algorithm (Hazan\n& Kale, 2009), with batch size τ = (12k)−3/4T 1/4, against an m-memory bounded adaptive adversary is\n(m+ 1)(12kT )3/4 + o(T 3/4)."

The policy regret of the mini-batched version of the EXP3.S algorithm, with batch size τ = (7ks log(kT ))−1/3T 1/3, compared to action sequences with at most s switches, against an m-memory bounded adaptive adversary, is upper bounded by\n(m+ 1) ( 7ks log(kT ) )1/3 T 2/3 +O(T 1/3).\nIt is possible to give similar guarantees for settings such as bandit convex optimization, provided that regret guarantees under action switches are available.\nFor instance, Flaxman et al. (Flaxman et al., 2005, Section 4) talk about (but do not explicitly derive) extensions of their bandit convex optimization regret guarantees that incorporate switches."

      "text" : "We have so far considered the standard notion of external pseudo-regret, where the player’s action-sequence is compared to action sequences in a class CT , where CT is commonly chosen to be the set of constant sequences. Other standard (yet less common) ways to analyze the performance of the player use the notions of internal regret (Blum & Mansour, 2007) and swap regret (Blum & Mansour, 2007). To define these notions, let Φ be a set of action transformations, namely each φ ∈ Φ is a function of the form φ : X → X . The player’s Φ-regret is then defined as:\nmax φ∈Φ\nE [ T∑ t=1 ft(X1,...,t)− ft(X1,...,t−1, φ(Xt)) ] .\nIn words, we compare the player’s loss to the loss that would have been attained if the player had replaced his current action according to one of the transformations in Φ. We recover external regret compared to constant action sequences by letting Φ be the set of constant functions, that map all actions to a constant action y. Internal regret is defined by setting Φ = {φy→y′ : y, y′ ∈ X}, where\nφy→y′(x) =\n{ y′ if x = y\nx otherwise .\nIn other words, φy→y′ replaces all occurrences of action y with action y′, but leaves all other actions unmodified. To define swap regret, we specialize to the k-armed bandit case, where X = {1, . . . , k}. Swap regret is defined by setting Φ = {φy1,...,yk : ∀j yj ∈ X}, where φy1,...,yk(x) = yx. In other words, this function replaces every action with a different action.\nΦ-regret suffers from the same intuitive difficulty as external regret, when the adversary is adaptive. Define the policy Φ-regret as\nmax φ∈Φ\nE [ T∑ t=1 ft(X1,...,t)− ft ( φ(X1), . . . , φ(Xt) )] .\nWe repeat our technique to prove the following.\nTheorem 6. Repeat the assumptions of Thm. 2, except that now let Φ be any set of action transformations and assume that A’s Φ-regret against any sequence of J loss functions generated by an adaptive\nadversary is upper bounded by R(J). Then, the policy Φ-regret of Aτ against (ft)Tt=1 generated by an m-memory-bounded adaptive adversary is bounded by τR(T/τ) + Tm/τ + τ .\nThe proof is omitted due to space constraints.\nBlum & Mansour (2007) presents a technique of converting any online learning algorithm with an external regret bound into an algorithm with an internal regret bound. Combining that technique with ours endows any of the online learning algorithms mentioned in this paper with a bound on internal policy regret."

      "text" : "We highlighted a problem with the standard definition of regret when facing an adaptive adversary. We defined the notion of policy regret and argued that it captures the intuitive semantics of the word “regret” better than the standard definition. We then went ahead to prove non-trivial upper bounds on the policy regret of various bandit algorithms.\nThe main gap in our current understanding of policy regret is the absence of lower bounds (in both the bandit and the full-information settings). In other words, we do not know how tight our upper bounds are. It is conceivable that bandit algorithms that are specifically designed to minimize policy regret will have superior bounds, but we are yet unable to show this. On a related issue, we do not know if our mini-batching technique is really necessary: perhaps one could prove a non-trivial policy regret bound for the original (unmodified) EXP3 algorithm. We leave these questions as open problems for future research."

The PAC-MDP bounds typically hold when the comparison is with all k policies (mappings from states to actions), not just the k constant-action policies. Our work is still substantially different from RL. The state transitions in RL are often assumed to be stochastic, whereas our setting is adversarial.

The widely-accepted formal definition of an online algorithm’s ability to learn is the game-theoretic notion of regret. We argue that the standard definition of regret becomes inadequate if the adversary is allowed to adapt to the online algorithm’s actions. We define the alternative notion of policy regret, which attempts to provide a more meaningful way to measure an online algorithm’s performance against adaptive adversaries. Focusing on the online bandit setting, we show that no bandit algorithm can guarantee a sublinear policy regret against an adaptive adversary with unbounded memory. On the other hand, if the adversary’s memory is bounded, we present a general technique that converts any bandit algorithm with a sublinear regret bound into an algorithm with a sublinear policy regret bound. We extend this result to other variants of regret, such as switching regret, internal regret, and swap regret.",
