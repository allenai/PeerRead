      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a new approach, medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN), to generate realistic synthetic EHRs. Based on an input EHR dataset, medGAN can generate high-dimensional discrete variables (e.g., binary and count features) via a combination of an autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. We also propose minibatch averaging to efficiently avoid mode collapse, and increase the learning efficiency with batch normalization and shortcut connections. To demonstrate feasibility, we showed that medGAN generates synthetic EHR datasets that achieve comparable performance to real data on many experiments including distribution statistics, predictive modeling tasks and medical expert review."

      "text" : "The adoption of electronic healthcare records (EHR) by healthcare providers, and the large quantity and quality of data now generated, has led to an explosion in computational health. However, the wide adoption of EHR systems does not automatically lead to easy access to EHR data for researchers. One of the reasons for limited access is because EHR data are composed of personally identifiable information, which in combination with potentially sensitive medical data, induces privacy concerns. As a result, access to such data for secondary purposes (e.g., research) is highly regulated, as well as controlled by provider groups that are at risk if data are misused or breached. The review process by legal departments and institutional review boards can take months, with no guarantee of access (Hodge Jr et al., 1999). This process limits timely opportunities to use data and may slow advances in biomedical knowledge and patient care (Gostin et al., 2009).\nHealthcare institutions often aim to mitigate privacy risks through the practice of de-identification (for Civil Rights, 2013). Typically, de-identification is accomplished through the perturbation of potentially identifiable attributes (e.g., dates of birth) via generalization, suppression or randomization (El Emam et al., 2015). However, this approach to privacy protection is not impregnable to re-identification attack (El Emam et al., 2011b). An alternative approach to de-identification is to generate synthetic data (McLachlan et al., 2016; Buczak et al., 2010; Lombardo and Moniz, 2008). However, realizing this approach in practice has been challenging because the resulting synthetic data are often not sufficiently realistic for machine learning tasks. Since many machine learning models on EHR data are using aggregated discrete features derived from longitudinal EHR records, we concentrate our effort on generating such aggregated data in this work. Although it is ultimately desirable to generate longitudinal event sequences, in this work we focus on generating high-dimensional discrete variables, which is an important and challenging problem on its own.\nGenerative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-quality synthetic images (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Radford et al., 2015; Goodfellow, 2016). A GAN consists\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n06 49\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n9 M\nar 2\nof two components: a generator that attempts to generate realistic, but fake, images and a discriminator that aims to distinguish between the generated fake images and the real images. By playing an adversarial game against each other, the generator can learn the distribution of the real samples provided that both the generator and the discriminator are sufficiently expressive. Empirically, a GAN outperforms other popular generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2013) and PixelRNN/PixelCNN (van den Oord et al., 2016a,b) on the quality of images (i.e., fake compared to real) and on processing speed (Goodfellow, 2016). However, a GAN cannot learn the distribution of discrete variables in its original form.\nOn that premise, we propose medGAN, a neural network model that generates high-dimensional discrete variables representing events documented in patients’ EHRs (e.g., diagnosis of a certain disease or treatment of a certain medication). Using an EHR source data, medGAN is designed to learn the distribution of discrete features, such as diagnosis or medication codes via a combination of an autoencoder and the adversarial framework. In this setting, the autoencoder is applied to overcome the original GAN’s inability to generate discrete samples. The specific contributions of this work are as follows: • We propose medGAN, an efficient algorithm to generate high-dimensional multi-hot discrete samples\nby combining an autoencoder with GAN. In particular, medGAN can handle both binary and count variables. • medGAN translates input EHR data to a program that can generate arbitrarily large volume of high-quality,\nhigh-dimensional synthetic patient data. • We propose a simple, yet effective, method called minibatch averaging to cope with the situation where\nGAN learns to generate samples of low diversity, the “mode collapse” problem, which outperforms previous methods such as minibatch discrimination. • We demonstrate the close-to-real-data performance of medGAN using real EHR datasets on diverse tasks including distribution statistics, classification performance and medical expert review."

      "text" : "We first discuss existing methods to generate synthetic EHR data, followed by recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GAN) and specific works on generating discrete variables using GAN. Synthetic Data Generation for Health Data: De-identification of EHR data is the prominent technical method for protecting patient privacy when sharing EHR data for research (Johnson et al., 2016). However, deidentification does not guarantee that a system is devoid of risk. In certain circumstances, re-identification of patients can be accomplished through residual distinguishable patterns in various features (e.g., demographics (Sweeney, 1997; El Emam et al., 2011a), diagnoses (Loukides et al., 2010), lab tests (Atreya et al., 2013), visits across healthcare providers (Malin and Sweeney, 2004), and genomic variants (Erlich and Narayanan, 2014)) To mitigate re-identification vulnerabilities, researchers in the statistical disclosure control community have investigated how to generate synthetic datasets. Yet, historically, these approaches have been limited to summary statistics for only several variables at a time (e.g., (Dreschsler, 2011; Reiter, 2002). For instance, McLachlan et al. (2016) used clinical practice guidelines and health incidence statistics with state transition machine to generate synthetic patient datasets.\nThere is some, but limited, work on synthetic data generation in the healthcare domain and, the majority that has, tend to be disease specific. For example, Buczak et al. (2010) generated EHR to explore questions related to the outbreak of specific illnesses, where care patterns in the source EHR were applied to generate synthetic datasets. Many of these methods often rely heavily upon domain-specific knowledge along with actual data to generate synthetic EHRs (Lombardo and Moniz, 2008). More recently, and most related to our work, a privacy-preserving patient data generator was proposed based on a perturbed Gibbs sampler (Park et al., 2013). Still, this approach can only handle binary variables and its utility was assessed only on a small, low-dimensional dataset. By contrast, our proposed medGAN directly captures general EHR data without focusing on specific diseases, which makes it suitable for diverse applications. GAN and its Applications: Attempts to advance GAN (Goodfellow et al., 2014) include, but are not limited to, using convolutional neural networks to improve image processing capacity (Radford et al., 2015), extending GAN to a conditional architecture for higher quality image generation (Mirza and Osindero, 2014;\nDenton et al., 2015; Odena et al., 2016), and text-to-image generation (Reed et al., 2016). We, in particular, pay attention to the recent studies that attempted to handle discrete variables using GAN.\nOne way to generate discrete variables with GAN is to invoke reinforcement learning. SeqGAN (Yu et al., 2016) trains GAN with REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) and Monte-Carlo search to generate word sequences. Although REINFORCE enables unbiased estimation of gradients of the model via sampling, the estimates come with a high variance. Moreover, SeqGAN focuses on sampling one word (i.e. one-hot) at each timestep, whereas our goal is to generate multi-label binary/count variables. Alternatively, one could use specialized distributions, such as the Gumbel-softmax (Jang et al., 2016; Kusner and Hernández-Lobato, 2016), a concrete distribution (Maddison et al., 2016) or a soft-argmax function (Zhang et al., 2016) to approximate the gradient of the model from discrete samples. However, since these approaches focus on the softmax distribution, they cannot be directly invoked for multi-label discrete variables, especially in the count variable case. Another way to handle discrete variables is to generate distributed representations, then decode them into discrete outputs. For example, Glover (2016) generated document embeddings with GAN, but did not attempt to generate actual documents.\nTo handle high-dimensional multi-label discrete variables, we propose medGAN to efficiently generate discrete samples by generating the distributed representations of patient records with GAN, then decoding them into actual discrete records with an autoencoder."

      "text" : "We assume there are |C| number of discrete variables (e.g., diagnosis, medication or procedure codes) in the EHR data that can be expressed as a fixed-size vector x ∈ Z|C|+ where the value of the ith dimension indicates the number of occurrences (i.e., counts) of the i-th variable in the patient record. In addition to the count variables, a visit record can also be represented as a binary vector x ∈ {0, 1}|C| where the ith dimension indicates the absence or occurrence of the ith variable in the patient record. Note that we can also represent demographic information, such as age and gender, as count and binary variables, respectively.\nLearning the distribution of count variables is generally more difficult than learning the distribution of binary variables. This is because the model needs to learn more than simple co-occurrence relations between the various dimensions. Moreover, in EHR data, certain codes tend to occur much more frequently (e.g., essential hypertension) than others. This is problematic because it can skew a distribution among different dimensions."

      "text" : "In a GAN, the generator G(z; θg), accepts the random prior z ∈ Rr and generates synthetic samples G(z) ∈ Rd, while the discriminator D(x; θd) determines whether a given sample is real or fake. The optimal discriminator D∗ would perfectly distinguish real samples from fake samples. The optimal generator G∗ would generate fake samples that are indistinguishable from the real samples so that D is forced to make random guesses. Formally, D and G play the following minimax game with the value function V (G,D):\nmin G max D V (G,D) = Ex∼pdata [logD(x)]\n+ Ez∼pz [log(1−D(G(z)))]\nwhere pdata is the distribution of the real samples and pz is the distribution of the random prior, for which N (0, 1) is generally used. Both G and D iterate in optimizing the respective parameters θg and θd as follows,\nθd ← θd + α∇θd 1\nm m∑ i=1 logD(xi) + log(1−D(G(zi)))\nθg ← θg − α∇θg 1\nm m∑ i=1 log(1−D(G(zi)))\nwhere m is the size of the minibatch and α the step size. In practice, however, G can be trained to maximize log(D(G(z)) instead of minimizing log(1−D(G(z)) to provide stronger gradients in the early stage of the training(Goodfellow et al., 2014) as follows,\nθg ← θg + α∇θg 1\nm m∑ i=1 logD(G(zi)) (1)\nIn the remainder of this paper we use Eq.(1) as it showed significantly more stable performance. We also assume throughout the paper that both D and G are implemented with feedforward neural networks.\n3.3 medGAN\nSince the generator G is trained by the error signal from the discriminator D via backpropagation, the original GAN cannot directly learn the distribution of discrete patient records x ∈ Z|C|+ . We overcome this limitation by leveraging the autoencoder. Autoencoders are trained to project given samples to a lower dimensional space, then project them back to the original space. Such a mechanism leads the autoencoder to learn salient features of the samples and has been successfully used in certain applications, like image processing (Goodfellow et al., 2016; Vincent et al., 2008). We apply the autoencoder to learn the salient features of discrete variables that can be used to decode the continuous output of G. This allows the gradient flow from D to the decoder Dec to enable the end-to-end fine-tuning. As depicted by Figure 1, an autoencoder consists of an encoder Enc(x; θenc) that compresses the input x ∈ Z|C|+ to Enc(x) ∈ Rh, and a decoder Dec(Enc(x); θdec) decompresses Enc(x) to Dec(Enc(x)) as the reconstruction of the original input x. The objective of the autoencoder is to minimize the reconstruction error:\n1 m m∑ i=0 ||xi − x′i||22 (2)\n1 m m∑ i=0 xi logx ′ i + (1− xi) log(1− x′i) (3) where x′i = Dec(Enc(xi))\nwhere m is the size of the mini-batch. We use the mean squared loss (Eq.(2)) for count variables and cross entropy loss (Eq.(3)) for binary variables. For count variables, we use rectified linear units (ReLU) as the activation function in both Enc and Dec. For binary variables, we use tanh activation for Enc and the sigmoid activation for Dec 1\nWith the autoencoder, we can allow GAN to generate distributed representation of patient records (i.e., the output of the encoder Enc), rather than generating discrete records directly. As the generator G and the encoder Enc both generate similar continuous values, the decoder Dec can pick up the right signals to convert synthetic continuous samples G(z) ∈ Rh to discrete samples Dec(G(z)) ∈ Z|C|+ . The discriminator D is trained to determine whether the given input is a synthetic sample Dec(G(z)) or a real sample x. The architecture of the proposed model medGAN is depicted in Figure 1. medGAN is trained in a similar fashion as the original GAN as follows,\nθd ← θd + α∇θd 1\nm m∑ i=1 logD(xi) + log(1−D(xzi))\nθg,dec ← θg,dec + α∇θg,dec 1\nm m∑ i=1 logD(xzi)\nwhere xzi = Dec(G(zi))\nNote that we fine-tune the pre-trained parameters of the decoder θdec while optimizing for G. Therefore the generator G can be viewed as a neural network with an extra hidden layer pre-trained to map continuous samples to discrete samples. We used ReLU for all of G’s activation functions, except for the output layer, where we used the tanh function2. For D, we used ReLU for all activation functions except for the output layer, where we used the sigmoid function for binary classification."

      "heading" : "3.4 Minibatch Averaging",
      "text" : "Since the objective of the generator G is to produce samples that can fool the discriminator D, G could learn to map different random priors z to the same synthetic output, rather than producing diverse synthetic outputs. This problem is denoted as mode collapse, which arises most likely due to the GAN’s optimization strategy often solving the max-min problem instead of the min-max problem (Goodfellow, 2016). Some methods have been proposed to cope with mode collapse such as minibatch discrimination and unrolled GANs, but they require some fine-tuning of the hyperparameters, or scalability has not been addressed (Salimans et al., 2016; Metz et al., 2016).\nmedGAN offers a simple and efficient method to cope with mode collapse when generating discrete outputs. Our method, minibatch averaging, is motivated by the philosophy behind minibatch discrimination; allow the discriminator D to view the minibatch of real samples x1,x2, . . . and the minibatch of the fake samples G(z1), G(z2), . . ., respectively, while classifying a real sample and a fake sample. Given a sample to discriminate, minibatch discrimination calculates the distance between the sample and all samples in the minibatch in the latent space. Minibatch averaging, by contrast, provides the average of the minibatch samples to D, modifying the objective as follows:\nθd ← θd + α∇θd 1\nm m∑ i=1 logD(xi, x̄) + log(1−D(xzi , x̄z))\nθg,dec ← θg,dec + α∇θg,dec 1\nm m∑ i=1 logD(xzi , x̄z)\nwhere x̄ = 1\nm m∑ i=1 xi, xzi = Dec(G(zi)), x̄z = 1 m m∑ i=1 xzi\nSpecifically, the average of the minibatch is concatenated on the sample and provided to the discriminator D.\n1We considered the denoising autoencoder (dAE) (Vincent et al., 2008) but there was no visible performance improvement. 2Note that we also used tanh activation for the encoder Enc for consistency.\nBinary variables: When processing binary variables x ∈ {0, 1}|C|, the average of minibatch samples x̄ and x̄z are equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimate of the Bernoulli success probability p̂k of each dimension k. This information makes it easier for D to ascertain whether a given sample is real or fake, if p̂k’s of fake samples are considerably different from those of real samples. This is especially likely if mode collapse occurs because the p̂k’s for most dimensions of the fake samples become dichotomized (either 0 or 1), whereas the p̂k’s of real samples generally take on a value between 0 and 1. Therefore, if G wants to fool D, it will have to generate more diverse examples within the minibatch Dec(G(z1, z2, . . .)). For EHR data generation, the binary variables can be applied to present whether diseases or treatments are present or not. Count variables: Count variables are a more accurate representation of clinical events they can indicate the number of times a diagnosis was made or a certain medication was prescribed over multiple hospital visits. In this case of count variables x ∈ Z|C|+ , the average of minibatch samples x̄ and x̄z can be viewed as the estimate of the binomial distribution mean np̂k of each dimension k, where n is the number of hospital visits. Hence minibatch averaging for the count variables also provides helpful statistics to the discriminator D, guiding the generator G to generate more diverse and realistic samples. Minibatch averaging works surprisingly well and does not require additional parameters as minibatch discrimination, therefore has minimal impact to the training time. It is worth mentioning that, for both binary and count variables, a bigger minibatch than usual is recommended to properly capture the statistics of the real data. We use 1,000 records for a minibatch in this work."

      "text" : "Similar to image processing GANs, we observed that balancing the power of D and G in the multi-label discrete variable setting was quite challenging (Goodfellow, 2016). Empirically, we observed that training medGAN with minibatch averaging demonstrated D consistently overpowering G after several iterations. While G still managed to learn under such situation, the performance seemed suboptimal, and updating θg and θdec more often than θd in each iteration only degraded performance. Considering the importance of an optimal D (Goodfellow, 2016), we chose not to limit the discriminative power of D, but rather improve the learning efficiency of G by applying batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) and shortcut connection (He et al., 2016). G’s kth layer is now formulated as follows:\nxk = ReLU(BNk(Wkxk−1)) + xk−1\nwhere ReLU is the rectified linear unit, BNk is the batch normalization at the k-th layer, Wk is the weight matrix of the k-th layer, and xk−1 is the input from the previous layer. The righthand side of Figure 1 depicts the first two layers of G. Note that we do not incporate the bias variable into each layer because batch normalization negates the necessity of the bias term. Additionally, Batch normalization and shortcut connections could be applied to the discriminator D, but the experiments showed that D was consistently overpowering G without such techniques, and we empirically found that a simple feedforward network was sufficient for D.\nAlgorithm 1 describes the overall optimization process of medGAN. Note that θd is updated k times per iteration, while θg and θdec are updated once per iteration to ensure optimality of D. However, typically, a larger k has not shown a clear improvement (Goodfellow, 2016). And we set k = 2 in our experiments."

We also compare the performance of medGAN with several popular generative methods as below. • Random Noise (RN): Given a real patient record x, we invert the binary value of each code (i.e.,\ndimension) with probability 0.1. This is not strictly a generative method but a simple implementation of a privacy protection method based on randomization. • Independent Sampling (IS): For the binary variable case, we calculate the Bernoulli success probability of each code in the real dataset, based on which we sample binary values to generate the synthetic dataset. For the count variable case, we use the kernel density estimator (KDE) for each code then sample from that distribution. • Stacked RBM (DBN): We train a stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006) and generate synthetic samples using Gibbs sampling. This was used as a baseline for binary variables only, as it is a binary network. • Variational Autoencoder (VAE): We train a variational autoencoder (Kingma and Welling, 2013)\nwhere the encoder and the decoder are constructed with feed-forward neural networks.

We also speculate that the medGAN’s dimension-wise prediction performance will increase with more training data, as Sutter HF dataset consists of only 30K samples."

      "text" : "To conduct a qualitative evaluation of medGAN, we use Sutter HF dataset to train medGAN and generate synthetic samples with count variables. We then randomly pick 50 records from real data and 50 records from synthetic data, shuffle the order, present them to a medical doctor (specialized in internal medicine) who is asked to score how realistic each record is using scale 1 to 10 (10 being most realistic). Here the human doctor is served as the role of discriminator to provide the quality assessment of the synthetic data generated by medGAN.\nThe results of this assessment is shown in Figure 7. The findings suggest that medGAN’s synthetic data are generally indistinguishable to a human doctor - except for several outliers. In those cases, the fake records identified by the doctor either lacked appropriate medication codes, or had both male-related codes (e.g. prostate cancer) and female-related codes (e.g. menopausal disorders) in the same record. The former issue also existed in some of the real records due to missing data, but the latter issue demonstrates a current limitation in medGAN which could potentially be alleviated by domain specific heuristics. In addition to medGAN’s impressive performance in statistical aspects, this medical review lends credibility to the qualitative aspect of medGAN."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this work, we proposed medGAN, which uses generative adversarial framework to learn the distribution of real-world multi-label discrete electronic health records (EHR). Through rigorous evaluation using two datasets, medGAN showed impressive results for both binary variables and count variables. Considering the\ndifficulty accessibility of EHRs, we expect medGAN to make a contribution for healthcare research. As we have shown the versatility of GAN framework, we also expect this will encourage other researchers to apply GAN framework on various datasets and tasks. For future directions, we plan to explore the sequential version of medGAN, and also try to include other modalities such as lab measures, patient demographics, and free-text medical notes."

However, various concerns, particularly over privacy, can limit access to and collaborative use of EHR data. Sharing synthetic EHR data could mitigate risk. In this paper, we propose a new approach, medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN), to generate realistic synthetic EHRs. Based on an input EHR dataset, medGAN can generate high-dimensional discrete variables (e.g., binary and count features) via a combination of an autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. We also propose minibatch averaging to efficiently avoid mode collapse, and increase the learning efficiency with batch normalization and shortcut connections. To demonstrate feasibility, we showed that medGAN generates synthetic EHR datasets that achieve comparable performance to real data on many experiments including distribution statistics, predictive modeling tasks and medical expert review.",
