      "text" : "The success of kernel methods has initiated the design of novel positive semidefinite functions, in particular for structured data. A leading design paradigm for this is the convolution kernel, which decomposes structured objects into their parts and sums over all pairs of parts. Assignment kernels, in contrast, are obtained from an optimal bijection between parts, which can provide a more valid notion of similarity. In general however, optimal assignments yield indefinite functions, which complicates their use in kernel methods. We characterize a class of base kernels used to compare parts that guarantees positive semidefinite optimal assignment kernels. These base kernels give rise to hierarchies from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed in linear time by histogram intersection. We apply these results by developing the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel for graphs. It provides high classification accuracy on widely-used benchmark data sets improving over the original Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "The various existing kernel methods can conveniently be applied to any type of data, for which a kernel is available that adequately measures the similarity between any two data objects. This includes structured data like images [2, 5, 10], 3d shapes [1], chemical compounds [7] and proteins [4], which are often represented by graphs. Most kernels for structured data decompose both objects and add up the pairwise similarities between their parts following the seminal concept of convolution kernels proposed by Haussler [11]. In fact, many graph kernels can be seen as instances of convolution kernels under different decompositions [21].\nA fundamentally different approach with good prospects is to assign the parts of one objects to the parts of the other, such that the total similarity between the assigned parts is maximum possible. Finding such a bijection is known as assignment problem and well-studied in combinatorial optimization. This approach has been successfully applied to graph comparison, e.g., in general graph matching [8, 15] as well as in kernel-based classification [7, 16, 1]. In contrast to convolution kernels, assignments establish structural correspondences and thereby alleviate the problem of diagonal dominance at the same time. However, the similarities derived in this way are not necessarily positive semidefinite (p.s.d.) [20, 21] and hence do not give rise to valid kernels, severely limiting their use in kernel methods.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 14\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\nOur goal in this paper is to consider a particular class of base kernels which give rise to valid assignment kernels. In the following we use the term valid to mean a kernel which is symmetric and positive semidefinite. We formalize the considered problem: Let [X ]n denote the set of all n-element subsets of a set X and B(X,Y ) the set of all bijections between X,Y in [X ]n for n ∈ N. We study the optimal assignment kernel KkB on [X ]n defined as\nKkB(X,Y ) = max B∈B(X,Y )\nW (B), where W (B) = ∑\n(x,y)∈B k(x, y) (1)\nand k is a base kernel on X . For clarity of presentation we assume n to be fixed. In order to apply the kernel to data sets, where n is variable, we may fill up smaller sets by new objects z with k(z, x) = 0 for all x ∈ X without changing the result.\nRelated work. Correspondence problems have been extensively studied in object recognition, where objects are represented by sets of features often called bag of words. Grauman and Darrell proposed the pyramid match kernel that seeks to approximate correspondences between points in Rd by employing a space-partitioning tree structure and counting how often points fall into the same bin [10]. An adaptive partitioning with non-uniformly shaped bins was used to improve the approximation quality in high dimensions [9].\nFor non-vectorial data, Fröhlich et al. [7] proposed kernels for graphs derived from an optimal assignment between their vertices and applied the approach to molecular graphs. However, it was shown that the resulting similarity measure is not necessarily a valid kernel [20]. Therefore, Vishwanathan et al. [21] proposed a theoretically well-founded variation of the kernel, which essentially replaces the max-function in Eq. (1) by a soft-max function. Besides introducing an additional parameter, which must be chosen carefully to avoid numerical difficulties, the approach requires the evaluation of a sum over all possible assignments instead of finding a single optimal one. This leads to an increase in running time from cubic to factorial, which is infeasible in practice. Pachauri et al. [14] considered the problem of finding optimal assignments between multiple sets. The problem is equivalent to finding a permutation of the elements of every set, such that assigning the i-th elements to each other yields an optimal result. Solving this problem allows the derivation of valid kernels between pairs of sets with a fixed ordering. This approach was referred to as transitive assignment kernel in [16] and employed for graph classification. However, this does not only lead to non-optimal assignments between individual pairs of graphs, but also suffers from high computational costs.\nVarious general approaches to cope with indefinite kernels have been proposed, in particular, for support vector machines (see [13] and references therein). Such approaches should principally be used in applications, where similarities cannot be expressed by positive semidefinite kernels.\nOur contribution. We study optimal assignment kernels in more detail and investigate which base kernels lead to valid optimal assignment kernels. We characterize a specific class of kernels we refer to as strong and show that strong kernels are equivalent to kernels obtained from a hierarchical partition of the domain of the kernel. We show that for strong base kernels the optimal assignment (i) yields a valid kernel; and (ii) can be computed in linear time given the associated hierarchy. While the computation reduces to histogram intersection similar to the pyramid match kernel [10], our approach is in no way restricted to specific objects like points in Rd. We demonstrate the versatility of our results by deriving novel graph kernels based on optimal assignments, which are shown to improve over their convolution-based counterparts. In particular, we propose the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel, which performs favourable compared to state-of-the-art graph kernels on a wide range of data sets."

      "text" : "Before continuing with our contribution, we begin by introducing some key notation for kernels and trees which will be used later. A (valid) kernel on a set X is a function k : X × X → R such that there is a real Hilbert space H and a mapping φ : X → H such that k(x, y) = 〈φ(x), φ(y)〉 for all x, y in X , where 〈·, ·〉 denotes the inner product of H. We call φ a feature map, and H a feature space. Equivalently, a function k : X × X → R is a kernel if and only if for every subset {x1, . . . , xn} ⊆ X the n× n matrix defined by [m]i,j = k(xi, xj) is p.s.d. The Dirac kernel kδ is defined by kδ(x, y) = 1, if x = y and 0 otherwise.\nWe consider simple undirected graphs G = (V,E), where V (G) = V is the set of vertices and E(G) = E the set of edges. An edge {u, v} is for short denoted by uv or vu, where both refer to the same edge. A graph with a unique path between any two vertices is a tree. A rooted tree is a tree T with a distinguished vertex r ∈ V (T ) called root. The vertex following v on the path to the root r is called parent of v and denoted by p(v), where p(r) = r. The vertices on this path are called ancestors of v and the depth of v is the number of edges on the path. The lowest common ancestor LCA(u, v) of two vertices u and v in a rooted tree is the unique vertex with maximum depth that is an ancestor of both u and v."

      "heading" : "3 Strong kernels and hierarchies",
      "text" : "In this section we introduce a restricted class of kernels that will later turn out to lead to valid optimal assignment kernels when employed as base kernel. We provide two different characterizations of this class, one in terms of an inequality constraint on the kernel values, and the other by means of hierarchy defined on the domain of the kernel. The latter will provide the basis for our algorithm to compute valid optimal assignment kernels efficiently.\nWe first consider similarity functions fulfilling the requirement that for any two objects there is no third object that is more similar to each of them than the two to each other. We will see later in Section 3.1 that every such function indeed is p.s.d. and hence a valid kernel.\nDefinition 1 (Strong Kernel). A function k : X × X → R≥0 is called strong kernel if k(x, y) ≥ min{k(x, z), k(z, y)} for all x, y, z ∈ X .\nNote that a strong kernel requires that every object is most similar to itself, i.e., k(x, x) ≥ maxy∈X {k(x, y)} for all x ∈ X . In the following we introduce a restricted class of kernels that is derived from a hierarchy on the set X . As we will see later in Corollary 1 this class of kernels is equivalent to strong kernels according to Definition 1. Such hierarchies can be systematically constructed on sets of arbitrary objects in order to derive strong kernels. We commence by fixing the the concept of a hierarchy formally. Let T be a rooted tree such that the leaves of T are the elements of X . Each inner vertex v in T corresponds to a subset of X comprising all leaves of the subtree rooted at v. Therefore the tree T defines a family of nested subsets of X . Let w : V (T )→ R≥0 be a weight function such that w(v) ≥ w(p(v)) for all v in T . We refer to the tuple (T,w) as a hierarchy.\nDefinition 2 (Hierarchy-induced Kernel). Let H = (T,w) be a hierarchy on X , then the function defined as k(x, y) = w(LCA(x, y)) for all x, y in X is the kernel on X induced by H .\nWe show that Definitions 1 and 2 characterize the same class of kernels.\nLemma 1. Every kernel on X that is induced by a hierarchy on X is strong. Proof. Assume there is a hierarchy (T,w) that induces a kernel k that is not strong. Then there are x, y, z ∈ X with k(x, y) < min{k(x, z), k(z, y)}. Consider the three vertices a = LCA(x, z), b = LCA(z, y) and c = LCA(x, y). The unique path from x to the root contains a and the path from y to the root contains b, both contain c. The assumption implies that a, b, c are pairwise distinct and c is an ancestor of a and b since weights decrease along the paths. Thus, there must be a path from z via a to c and another path from z via b to c. Hence, T is not a tree, contradicting the assumption.\nWe show constructively that the converse holds as well.\nLemma 2. For every strong kernel k on X there is a hierarchy on X that induces k.\nProof (Sketch). We incrementally construct a hierarchy on X that induces k by successive insertion of elements from X . In each step the hierarchy induces k restricted to the inserted elements and eventually induces k after insertion of all elements. Initially, we start with a hierarchy containing just one element x ∈ X with w(x) = k(x, x). The key to all following steps is that there is a unique way to extend the hierarchy: Let Xi ⊆ X bet the first i elements in order of insertion and let Hi = (Ti, wi) be the hierarchy after the i-th step. A leaf representing the next element z can be grafted onto Hi to form a hierarchy Hi+1 that induces k restricted to Xi+1 = Xi ∪ {z}. Let B = {x ∈ Xi : k(x, z) = kmax}, where kmax = maxy∈Xi k(y, z). There is a unique vertex b, such that B are the leaves of the subtree rooted at b, cf. Fig. 1. We obtain Hi+1 by inserting a\nnew vertex p with child z into Ti, such that p becomes the parent of b, cf. Fig. 1(b), (c). We set wi+1(p) = kmax, wi+1(z) = k(z, z) and wi+1(x) = wi(x) for all x ∈ V (Ti). The construction maintains the hierarchy, since for strong kernels k(x, z) = k(x, c) must hold for all x ∈ Xi \\ B and c ∈ B.\nNote that a hierarchy inducing a specific strong kernel is not unique: Adjacent inner vertices with the same weight can be merged, and vertices with just one child can be removed without changing the induced kernel. Combining Lemmas 1 and 2 we obtain the following result.\nCorollary 1. A kernel k on X is strong if and only if it is induced by a hierarchy on X .\nAs a consequence of the above corollary the number of values a strong kernel on n objects may take is bounded by the number of vertices in a binary tree with n leaves, i.e., for every strong kernel k on X we have | img(k)| ≤ 2|X | − 1. The Dirac kernel is a common example of a strong kernel, in fact, every kernel k with | img(k)| = 2 is strong. The definition of strong kernel and its relation to hierarchies is reminiscent of related concepts for distances: A metric d on X is an ultrametric if d(x, y) ≤ max{d(x, z), d(z, y)} for all x, y, z ∈ X . For every ultrametric d on X there is a rooted tree T with leafs X and edge weights, such that (i) d is the path length between leafs in T , (ii) the path lengths from a leaf to the root are all equal. Indeed, every ultrametric can be embedded into a Hilbert space [12] and thus the associated inner product is a valid kernel. Moreover, it can be shown that this inner product always is a strong kernel. However, the concept of strong kernels is more general: there are strong kernels k such that the associated kernel metric dk(x, y) = ‖φ(x)− φ(y)‖ is not an ultrametric. The distinction originates from the self-similarities, which in strong kernels, can be arbitrary provided that they fulfil k(x, x) ≥ maxy∈X k(x, y) for all x in X . This degree of freedom is lost when considering distances. If we require all self-similarities of a strong kernel to be equal, then the associated kernel metric always is an ultrametric. Consequently, strong kernels correspond to a superset of ultrametrics. We explicitly define a feature space for general strong kernels in the following."

For a vertex v ∈ V (T ) and a setX ⊆ X , we denote by Xv the subset of X that is contained in the subtree rooted at v. We define the histogram Hk of a set X ∈ [X ]n w.r.t. the strong base kernel k as Hk(X) =∑x∈X φ(x)◦φ(x), where φ is the feature map of the strong base kernel according to Section 3.1 and ◦ denotes the element-wise product. Equivalently, [Hk(X)]v = ω(v) · |Xv| for v ∈ V (T ). The histogram intersection kernel [18] is defined as Ku(g,h) = ∑t i=1 min{[g]i, [h]i}, t ∈ N, and known to be a valid kernel on Rt [2, 5].\nTheorem 1. Let k be a strong kernel on X and the histograms Hk defined as above, then KkB(X,Y ) = Ku ( Hk(X), Hk(Y ) ) for all X,Y ∈ [X ]n.\nProof. Let (T,w) be a hierarchy inducing the strong base kernel k. We rewrite the weight of an assignment B as sum of weights of vertices in T : Since\nk(x, y) = w(LCA(x, y)) = ∑\nv∈P (x)∩P (y) ω(v), we have W (B) =\n∑\n(x,y)∈B k(x, y) =\n∑\nv∈V (T ) cv · ω(v),\nwhere cv counts how often v appears simultaneously in P (x) and P (y) in total for all (x, y) ∈ B. For the histogram intersection kernel we obtain\nKu(H k(X), Hk(Y )) =\n∑\nv∈V (T ) min{ω(v) · |Xv|, ω(v) · |Yv|} =\n∑\nv∈V (T ) min{|Xv|, |Yv|} · ω(v).\nTo complete the proof we have to show that cv = min{|Xv|, |Yv|} for all v ∈ V (T ). Since B is a bijection, every x ∈ X and y ∈ Y appears only once in B and cv ≤ min{|Xv|, |Yv|} follows. It remains to show that there always is an assignment B for which the above inequality is tight. We construct a matching by the following greedy approach: We perform a bottom-up traversal on the hierarchy starting with the leafs. For every vertex v in the hierarchy we arbitrarily pair the objects in Xv and Yv that are not yet contained in the assignment. Note that no element in Xv has been assigned to an element in Y \\ Yv , and no element in Yv to an element from X \\Xv . Hence, at every vertex v we have cv = min{|Xv|, |Yv|} vertices from Xv assigned to vertices in Yv .\nFigure 3 illustrates the relation between the optimal assignment kernel employing a strong base kernel and the histogram intersection kernel. Note that a vertex v ∈ V (T ) with ω(v) = 0 does not contribute to the histogram intersection kernel and can be omitted. In particular, for any two objects x1, x2 ∈ X with k(x1, y) = k(x2, y) for all y ∈ X we have ω(x1) = ω(x2) = 0. There is no need to explicitly represent such leafs in the hierarchy, yet their multiplicity must be considered to determine the number of leafs in the subtree rooted at an inner vertex.\nCorollary 2. If the base kernel k is strong, then the function KkB is a valid kernel.\nTheorem 1 implies not only that optimal assignments give rise to valid kernels for strong base kernels, but also allows to compute them by histogram intersection. Provided that the hierarchy is known, bottom-up computation of histograms and their intersection can both be performed in linear time, while the general Hungarian method would require cubic time to solve the assignment problem.\nCorollary 3. Given a hierarchy inducing k, KkB(X,Y ) can be computed in time O(|X|+ |Y |)."

      "text" : "Weisfeiler-Lehman kernels are based on iterative vertex colour refinement and have been shown to provide state-of-the-art prediction performance in experimental evaluations [17]. These kernels employ the classical 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman heuristic for graph isomorphism testing and consider subtree patterns encoding the neighbourhood of each vertex up to a given distance. For a\nparameter h and a graph G with initial labels τ , a sequence (τ0, . . . , τh) of refined labels referred to as colours is computed, where τ0 = τ and τi is obtained from τi−1 by the following procedure: Sort the multiset of colours {τi−1(u) : vu ∈ E(G)} for every vertex v lexicographically to obtain a unique sequence of colours and add τi−1(v) as first element. Assign a new colour τi(v) to every vertex v by employing a one-to-one mapping from sequences to new colours. Figure 4(a) illustrates the refinement process. The Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel (WL) counts the vertex colours two graphs have in common in the first h refinement steps and can be computed by taking the dot product of feature vectors, where each component counts the occurrences of a colour.\nWe propose the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel (WL-OA), which is defined on the vertices like OA-V, but employs the non-trivial base kernel\nk(u, v) =\nh∑\ni=0\nkδ(τi(u), τi(u)). (2)\nThis base kernel corresponds to the number of matching colours in the refinement sequence. More intuitively, the base kernel value reflects to what extent the two vertices have a similar neighbourhood.\nLet V be the set of all vertices of graphs in G, we show that the refinement process defines a hierarchy on V , which induces the base kernel of Eq. (2). Each vertex colouring τi naturally partitions V into colour classes, such that vertices have the same colour if and only if they are in the same cell. Since the refinement takes the colour τi(v) of a vertex v into account when computing τi+1(v), the implication τi(u) 6= τi(v) ⇒ τi+1(u) 6= τi+1(v) holds for all u, v ∈ V . Hence, the colour classes induced by τi+1 are at least as fine as those induced by τi. Moreover, the sequence (τi)0≤i≤h gives rise to a family of nested subsets, which can naturally be represented by a hierarchy (T,w), see Fig. 4(b) for an illustration. When assuming ω(v) = 1 for all vertices v ∈ V (T ), the hierarchy induces the kernel of Eq. (2). We have shown that the base kernel is strong and it follows from Corollary 2 that WL-OA is a valid kernel. Moreover, it can be computed from the feature vectors of the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel in linear time by histogram intersection, cf. Theorem 1."

This indicates that optimal assignment kernels provide a more valid notion of similarity than convolution kernels for these classification tasks. The most successful kernel is WL-OA, which almost consistently improves over WL and performs best on seven of the nine data sets. WL-OA provides the second best accuracy on D&D and ranks in the middle of the field for MUTAG. For these two data set the difference in accuracy between the kernels is small and even the baseline kernels perform notably well.\nThe time to compute the quadratic kernel matrix was less that one minute for all kernels and data sets with exception of SP on D&D (29 min) and REDDIT (2 h) as well as GL on COLLAB (28 min).

A leading design paradigm for this is the convolution kernel, which decomposes structured objects into their parts and sums over all pairs of parts. Assignment kernels, in contrast, are obtained from an optimal bijection between parts, which can provide a more valid notion of similarity. In general however, optimal assignments yield indefinite functions, which complicates their use in kernel methods. We characterize a class of base kernels used to compare parts that guarantees positive semidefinite optimal assignment kernels. These base kernels give rise to hierarchies from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed in linear time by histogram intersection. We apply these results by developing the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel for graphs. It provides high classification accuracy on widely-used benchmark data sets improving over the original Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel.",
