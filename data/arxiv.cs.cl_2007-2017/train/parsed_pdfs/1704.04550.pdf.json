      "text" : "When humans encounter an unknown word in text, they can often infer approximately what it means, as in this example from Lazaridou et al. (2014):\nWe found a cute, hairy wampimuk sleeping behind the tree.\nPeople who hear this sentence typically guess that a wampimuk is an animal, or even that it is a mammal. Distributional models, which describe the meaning of a word in terms of its observed contexts (Turney and Pantel, 2010), have been suggested as a model for how humans learn word meanings (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). However, distributional models typically need hundreds of instances of a word to derive a highquality representation for it, while humans can often infer a passable meaning approximation from one sentence only (as in the above example). This phenomenon is known as fast mapping (Carey and Bartlett, 1978).\nWhile there is preliminary evidence that fast mapping can be modeled distributionally (Lazaridou et al., 2016), it is unclear what enables it. How do humans infer word meanings from so little data? This question has been studied for grounded word learning, when the\nlearner perceives an object in non-linguistic context that corresponds to the unknown word. The literature emphasizes the importance of learning general knowledge or overarching structure across all concepts (Kemp et al., 2007), for example knowledge about which properties are most important to object naming (Smith et al., 2002; Colunga and Smith, 2005), or a taxonomy of concepts (Xu and Tenenbaum, 2007).\nIn this paper we study models for fast mapping in word learning1 from textual context alone, using probabilistic distributional models. Our task differs from the grounded case in that we do not perceive any object labeled by the unknown word. For the sake of interpretability, we focus on learning definitional properties. We ask what kinds of general knowledge on regularities in distributional contexts and in properties will be helpful for oneshot word learning.\nWe focus on learning from syntactic context. Distributional representations of syntactic context are directly interpretable as selectional constraints, which in manually created resources are typically characterized through highlevel taxonomy classes (Kipper-Schuler, 2005; Fillmore et al., 2003). So they should provide good evidence for the meaning of role fillers. Also, it has been shown that selectional constraints can be learned distributionally (Erk et al., 2010; Ó Séaghdha and Korhonen, 2014; Ritter et al., 2010).\nWe test two types of general knowledge for their usefulness in fast mapping. First, we hypothesize that it is helpful to learn about commonalities among context items. For example the syntactic context items eat-dobj and cook-dobj should\n1In this paper, we interchangeably use the terms unknown word and unknown concept, as we learn properties, and properties belong to concepts rather than words, and we learn them from text, where we observe words rather than concepts.\nprefer similar targets: Things that are typically cooked are also things that are typically eaten (hypothesis H1). The second hypothesis (H2) is that it will be useful to learn co-occurrence patterns between properties. For example, entities which are mammals are also often four-legged."

      "heading" : "2 Background",
      "text" : "Fast mapping and textual context. Fast mapping (Carey and Bartlett, 1978) is the human ability to construct provisional word meaning representations after one or few exposures. An important reason for why humans can do fast mapping is that they acquire general knowledge that constrains learning (Smith et al., 2002; Colunga and Smith, 2005; Kemp et al., 2007; Xu and Tenenbaum, 2007; Maas and Kemp, 2009). In this paper, we ask what forms of general knowledge will be useful for text-based word learning.\nLazaridou et al. (2014) consider fast mapping for grounded word learning, mapping image data to distributional representations, which is in a way the mirror image of our task. Lazaridou et al. (2016) were the first to explore fast mapping for text-based word learning, using an extension to word2vec with both textual and visual features. However, they model the unknown word simply by averaging the vectors of known words in the sentence, and do not explore what types of knowledge enable fast mapping.\nDefinitional properties. Feature norms are definitional properties collected from human participants. Feature norm datasets are available from McRae et al. (2005) and Vigliocco et al. (2004). There are several recent approaches that learn to map distributional representations to feature norms (Johns and Jones, 2012; Rubinstein et al., 2015; Făgărăşan et al., 2015; Herbelot and Vecchi, 2015a). We also map distributional information to definitional properties, but we do it based on a single textual instance (oneshot learning).\nIn the current paper we use the QuantifiedMcRae (QMR) dataset (Herbelot and Vecchi, 2015b), which extends the McRae et al. (2005) feature norms by ratings on the proportion of category members that have a property, and the Animal dataset (Herbelot, 2013), which is smaller but has the same shape. For example, most alligators are dangerous. The quantifiers are given\nprobabilistic interpretations, so if most alligators are dangerous, the probability for a random alligator to be dangerous would be 0.95. This makes this dataset a good fit for our probabilistic distributional model. We discuss QMR and the Animal data further in Section 4.\nBayesian models in lexical semantics. We use Bayesian models for the sake of interpretability and because the existing definitional property datasets are small. The Bayesian models in lexical semantics that are most related to our approach are Dinu and Lapata (2010), who represent word meanings as distributions over latent topics that approximate senses, and Andrews et al. (2009) and Roller and Schulte im Walde (2013), who use multi-modal extensions of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models (Blei et al., 2003) to represent co-occurrences of textual context and definitional features. Ó Séaghdha (2010) and Ritter et al. (2010) use Bayesian approaches to model selectional preferences."

      "text" : "Independent Bernoulli condition. Let Q be a set of definitional properties, C a set of concepts that the learner knows about, and V a vocabulary of context items. For most of our models, context items w ∈ V will be predicate-role pairs such as eat-dobj. The task is determine properties that apply to an unknown concept u 6∈ C . Any concept c ∈ C is associated with a vector cInd (where “Ind” stands for “independent Bernoulli probabilities”) of |Q| probabilities, where the i-th entry of cInd is the probability that an instance of concept c would have property qi. These probabilities are independent Bernoulli probabilities. For instance, alligatorInd would have an entry of 0.95 for dangerous. An instance c ∈ {0, 1}|Q| of a\nconcept c ∈ C is a vector of zeros and ones drawn from cInd, where an entry of 1 at position i means that this instance has the property qi.\nThe model proceeds in two steps. First it learns property probabilities for context items w ∈ V . The model observes instances c occurring textually with context itemw, and learns property probabilities for w, where the probability that w has for a property q indicates the probability that w would appear as a context item with an instance that has property q. In the second step the model uses the acquired context item representations to learn property probabilities for an unknown concept u. When u appears withw, the context itemw “imagines” an instance (samples it from its property probabilities), and uses this instance to update the property probabilities of u. Instead of making point estimates, the model represents its uncertainty about the probability of a property through a Beta distribution, a distribution over Bernoulli probabilities. As a Beta distribution is characterized by two parameters α and β, we associate each context item w ∈ V with vectors wα ∈ R|Q| and wβ ∈ R|Q|, where the i-th α and β values are the parameters of the Beta distribution for property qi. When an instance c is observed with context item w, we do a Bayesian update on w simply as\nwα = wα + c wβ = wβ + (1− c)\n(1)\nbecause the Beta distribution is the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli. To draw an instance from w, we draw it from the predictive posterior probabilities of its Beta distributions, wInd = w α/(wα +wβ).\nLikewise, we associate an unknown concept u with vectors uα and uβ . When the model observes u in the context of w, it draws an instance from wInd, and performs a Bayesian update as in (1) on the vectors associated with u. After training, the property probabilities for u are again the posterior predictive probabilities uInd = u\nα/(uα+uβ). The model can be used for multi-shot learning and oneshot learning in the same way.\nMultinomial condition. We also test a multinomial variant of the count-based model, for greater comparability with the LDA model below. Here, the concept representation cMult is a multinomial distribution over the properties inQ. (That is, all the properties compete in this model.) An instance of concept c is now a single property, drawn from c’s multinomial. The representation\nof a context item w, and also the representation of the unknown concept u, is a Dirichlet distribution with |Q| parameters. Bayesian update of the representation of w based on an occurrence with c, and likewise Bayesian update of the representation of u based on an occurrence with w, is straightforward again, as the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the multinomial.\nThe two count-based models do not implement either of our two hypotheses. They compute separate selectional constraints for each context item, and do not attend to co-occurrences between properties. In the experiments below, the count-based models will be listed as Count Independent and Count Multinomial."

      "heading" : "3.2 The Bimodal Topic Model",
      "text" : "We use an extension of LDA (Blei et al., 2003) to implement our hypotheses on the usefulness of overarching structure, both commonalities in selectional constraints across predicates, and cooccurrence of properties across concepts. In particular, we build on Andrews et al. (2009) in using a bimodal topic model, in which a single topic simultaneously generates both a context item and a property. We further build on Dinu and Lapata (2010) in having a “pseudo-document” for each concept c to represent its observed occurrences. In our case, this pseudo-document contains pairs of a context item w ∈ V and a property q ∈ Q, meaning that w has been observed to occur with an instance of c that had q.\nThe generative story is as follows. For each known concept c, draw a multinomial θc over topics. For each topic z, draw a multinomial φz over context items w ∈ V , and a multinomial ψz over\nproperties q ∈ Q. To generate an entry for c’s pseudo-document, draw a topic z ∼ Mult(θc). Then, from z, simultaneously draw a context item from φz and a property from ψz . Figure 1 shows the plate diagram for this model.\nTo infer properties for an unknown concept u, we create a pseudo-document for u containing just the observed context items, no properties, as those are not observed. From this pseudo-document du we infer the topic distribution θu. Then the probability of a property q given du is\nP (q|du) = ∑\nz\nP (z|θu)P (q|ψz) (2)\nFor the one-shot condition, where we only observe a single context item w with u, this simplifies to\nP (q|w) = ∑\nz\nP (z|w)P (q|ψz) (3)\nWe refer to this model as bi-TM below. The topics of this model implement our hypothesis H1 by grouping context items that tend to occur with the same concepts and the same properties. The topics also implement our hypothesis H2 by grouping properties that tend to occur with the same concepts and the same context items. By using multinomials ψz it makes the simplifying assumption that all properties compete, like the Count Multinomial model above."

      "text" : "With the Count models, we investigate word learning without any overarching structures. With the bi-TMs, we investigate word learning with both types of overarching structures at once. In order to evaluate each of the two hypotheses separately, we use clustering with Bernoulli Mixture models of either the context items or the properties.\nA Bernoulli Mixture model (Juan and Vidal, 2004) assumes that a population ofm-dimensional binary vectors x has been generated by a set of mixture components K , each of which is a vector ofm Bernoulli probabilities:\np(x) =\n|K|∑\nk=1\np(k)p(x|k) (4)\nA Bernoulli Mixture can represent co-occurrence patterns between the m random variables it models without assuming competition between them.\nTo test the effect of modeling cross-predicate selectional constraints, we estimate a Bernoulli\nMixture model from n instances w for each w ∈ V , sampled from wInd (which is learned as in the Count Independent model). Given a Bernoulli Mixture model of |K| components, we then assign each context item w to its closest mixture component as follows. Say the instances of w used to estimate the Bernoulli Mixture were {w\n1 , . . . ,wn},\nthen we assign w to the component\nkw = argmaxk\nn∑\nj=1\np(k|wj) (5)\nWe then re-train the representations of context items in the Count Multinomial condition, treating each occurrence of c with context w as an occurrence of c with kw. This yields a Count Multinomial model called Count BernMix H1.\nTo test the effect of modeling property co-occurrences, we estimate a |K|-component Bernoulli Mixture model from n instances of each known concept c ∈ C , sampled from cInd. We then represent each concept c by a vector cMult, a multinomial with |K| parameters, as follows. Say the instances of c used to estimate the Bernoulli Mixture were {c\n1 , . . . , cn}, then the k-th entry in\ncMult is the average probability, over all ci, of being generated by component k:\nck = 1\nn\nn∑\nj=1\np(k|cj) (6)\nThis can be used as a Count Multinomial model where the entries in cMult stand for Bernoulli Mixture components rather than individual properties. We refer to it as Count BernMix H2.2\nFinally, we extend the bi-TM with the H2 Bernoulli Mixture in the same way as a Count Multinomial model, and list this extension as biTM BernMix H2. While the bi-TM already implements both H1 and H2, its assumption of competition between all properties is simplistic, and bi-TM BernMix H2 tests whether lifting this assumption will yield a better model. We do not extend the bi-TM with the H1 Bernoulli Mixture, as the assumption of competition between context items that the bi-TM makes is appropriate.\n2We use the H2 Bernoulli Mixture as a soft clustering because there is a straightforward way of doing this through the concept representations. For the H1 mixture we could see no straightforward use as a soft clustering, so we use it as a hard clustering."

      "heading" : "4 Data and Experimental Setup",
      "text" : "Definitional properties. As we use probabilistic models, we need probabilities of properties applying to concept instances. So the QMR dataset (Herbelot and Vecchi, 2015b) is ideally suited. QMR has 532 concrete noun concepts, each associated with a set of quantified properties. The quantifiers have been given probabilistic interpretations, mapping all→1, most→0.95, some→0.35, few→0.05, none→0.3 Each concept/property pair was judged by 3 raters. We choose the majority rating when it exists, and otherwise the minimum proposed rating. To address sparseness, especially for the one-shot learning setting, we omit properties that are named for fewer than 5 concepts. This leaves us with 503 concepts and 220 properties.\nIt is a problem of both the original McRae et al. (2005) data and QMR that if a property is not named by participants, it is not listed, even if it applies. For example, the property four-legged is missing for alligator in QMR. So we additionally use the Animal dataset of Herbelot (2013), where every property has a rating for every concept. The dataset comprises 72 animal concepts with quantification information for 54 properties.\nDistributional data. We use the British National Corpus (BNC) (The BNC Consortium, 2007), with dependency parses from Spacy. 4 As context items, we use pairs 〈pred, dep〉 of predicates pred that are content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) but not stopwords, where a concept from the respective dataset (QMR, Animal) is a dependency child of pred via dep. In total we obtain a vocabulary of 500 QMR concepts and 72 Animal concepts that appear in the BNC, and 29,124 context items. We refer to this syntactic context as Syn. For comparison, we also use a baseline model with a bag-of-words (BOW) context window of 2 or 5 words, with stopwords removed.\nModels. We test our probabilistic models as defined in the previous section. While our focus is on one-shot learning, we also evaluate a multi-shot setting where we learn from the whole BNC, as a sanity check on our models. (We do not test our models in an incremental learn-\n3The dataset also contains KIND properties that apply to the kind as a whole and that do not have probabilistic interpretations. Following Herbelot and Vecchi (2015a) we omit these properties.\n4 https://spacy.io\ning setting that adds one occurrence at a time. While this is possible in principle, the computational cost is prohibitive for the bi-TM.) We compare to the Partial Least Squares (PLS) model of Herbelot and Vecchi (2015a) to see whether our models perform at state of the art levels. We also compare to a baseline that always predicts the probability of a property to be its relative frequency in the set C of known concepts (Baseline). We can directly use the property probabilities in QMR and the Animal data as concept representations cInd for the Count Independent model. For the Count Multinomial model, we never explicitly compute cMult. To sample from it, we first sample an instance c ∈ {0, 1}|Q| from the independent Bernoulli vector of c, cInd. From the properties that apply to c, we sample one (with equal probabilities) as the observed property. All priors for the count-based models (Beta priors or Dirichlet priors, respectively) are set to 1.\nFor the bi-TM, a pseudo-document for a known concept c is generated as follows. Given an occurrence of known concept c with context item w in the BNC, we sample a property q from c (in the same way as for the Count Multinomial model), and add 〈w, q〉 to the pseudodocument for c. For training the bi-TM, we use collapsed Gibbs sampling (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007) with 500 iterations for burn-in. The Dirichlet priors are uniformly set to 0.1 following Roller and Schulte im Walde (2013). We use 50 topics throughout.\nFor all our models, we report the average performance from 5 runs. For the PLS benchmark, we use 50 components with otherwise default settings, following Herbelot and Vecchi (2015a).\nEvaluation. We test all models using 5-fold cross validation and report average performance across the 5 folds. We evaluate performance using Mean Average Precision (MAP): Assume a system that predicts a ranking of n datapoints, where 1 is the highest-ranked, and assume that each datapoint i has a gold rating of I(i) ∈ {0, 1}. This system obtains an Average Precision (AP) of\nAP = 1∑n\ni=1 I(i)\nn∑\ni=1\nPreci · I(i)\nwhere Preci is precision at a cutoff of i. Mean Average Precision is the mean over multiple AP values. In our case, n = |Q|, and we compare a model-predicted ranking of property probabilities\nwith a binary gold rating of whether the property applies to any instances of the given concept. For the one-shot evaluation, we make a separate prediction for each occurrence of an unknown concept u in the BNC, and report MAP by averaging over the AP values for all occurrences of u."

      "heading" : "5 Results and Discussion",
      "text" : "Multi-shot learning. We first test all models in a multi-shot setting to see how well they perform when given ample amounts of training data. The results are shown in Table 1, where Syn shows results that use syntactic context (encoding selectional constraints) and BOW5 is a bag-of-words context with a window size of 5. We only compare our models to the baseline and benchmark for now, and do an in-depth comparison of our models when we get to the one-shot task, which is our main focus.\nAcross all models, the syntactic context outperforms the bag-of-words context. We also tested a bag-of-words context with window size 2 and found it to have a performance halfway between Syn and BOW5 throughout. This confirms our assumption that it is reasonable to focus on syntactic context, and for the rest of this paper, we test models with syntactic context only.\nFocusing on Syn conditions now, we see that almost all models outperform the property frequency baseline, though the MAP scores for the baseline do not fall far behind those of the weakest count-based models.5 The best of our mod-\n5This is due to the formulation of MAP, which does not take into account gold property weights, that is, it gives equal credit for all properties correctly predicted as zero/nonzero. When we evaluate with Generalized Average Precision (GAP) (Kishida, 2005), which does take gold property weights into account, the baseline performance is on average more than 10 points below the other models. This indicates that unlike the baseline, our models do learn the true property distributions to some extent. We do not report GAP throughout because for all non-baseline models, GAP scores\nels perform on par with the PLS benchmark of Herbelot and Vecchi (2015a) on QMR, and on the Animal dataset they outperform the benchmark. Comparing the two datasets, we see that all models show better performance on the cleaner (and smaller) Animal dataset than on QMR. This is probably because QMR suffers from many false negatives (properties that apply but were not mentioned), while Animal does not. The Count Independent model shows similar performance here and throughout all later experiments to the Count Multinomial (even though it matches the construction of the QMR and Animal datasets better), so to avoid clutter we do not report on it further below.\nOne-shot learning. Table 2 shows the performance of our models on the one-shot learning task. We cannot evaluate the benchmark PLS as it is not suitable for one-shot learning. The baseline is the same as in Table 1. The numbers shown are Average Precision (AP) values for learning from a single occurrence. Column all averages over all occurrences of a target in the BNC (using only context items that appeared at least 5 times in the BNC), and column oracle top-20 averages over the 20 context items that have the highest AP for the given target. As can be seen, AP varies widely across sentences: When we average over all occurrences of a target in the BNC, performance is close to baseline level.6 But the most informative instances yield excellent information about an unknown concept, and lead to MAP values that are much higher than those achieved in multi-shot learning (Table 1). We explore this more below.\ntrack MAP scores closely and do not add any additional insights.\n6Context items with few occurrences in the corpus perform considerably worse than baseline, as their property distributions are dominated by the small number of concepts with which they appear.\nComparing our models, we see that the bi-TM does much better throughout than any of the countbased models. Since the bi-TM model implements both cross-predicate selectional constraints (H1) and property co-occurrence (H2), we find both of our hypotheses confirmed by these results. The Bernoulli mixtures improved performance on the Animal dataset, with no clear pattern of which one improved performance more. On QMR, adding a Bernoulli mixture model harms performance across both the count-based and biTM models. We suspect that this is because of the false negative entries in QMR; an inspection of Bernoulli mixture H2 components supports this intuition, as the QMR ones were found to be of poorer quality than those for the Animal data.\nComparing Tables 1 and 2 we see that they show the same patterns of performance: Models that do better on the multi-shot task also do better on the one-shot task. This is encouraging in that it suggests that it should be possible to build incremental models that do well both in a low-data and an abundant-data setting.\nTable 3 looks in more detail at what it is that the models are learning by showing the five highestprobability properties they are predicting for the concept gown. The top two entries are multishot models, the third shows the one-shot result from the context item with the highest AP. The bi-TM results are very good in both the multi-shot and the one-shot setting, giving high probability to some quite specific properties like has sleeves. The count-based model shows a clear frequency bias in erroneously giving high probabilities to the two overall most frequent properties, made of metal and an animal. This is due to the additive nature of the Count model: In updating unknown concepts from context items, frequent properties are more likely to be sampled, and their effect accumulates as\nthe model does not take into account interactions among context items. The bi-TM, which models these interactions, is much more robust to the effect of property frequency.\nInformativity. In Table 2 we saw that one-shot performance averaged over all context items in the whole corpus was quite bad, but that good, informative context items can yield high-quality property information. Table 4 illustrates this point further. For the concept gown, it shows the five context items that yielded the highest AP values, at the top undo-obj, with an AP as high as 0.7.\nThis raises the question of whether we can predict the informativity of a context item.7 We test three measures of informativity. The first is simply the frequency of the context item, with the rationale that more frequent context items should have more stable representations. Our second measure is based on entropy. For each context item w, we compute a distribution over properties as in the count-independent model, and measure the entropy of this distribution. If the distribution has few properties account for a majority of the probability mass, then w will have a low entropy, and would be expected to be more informative. Our third measure is based on the same intuition, that items with more “concentrated” selectional constraints should be more informative. If a context\n7Lazaridou et al. (2016), who use a bag-of-words context in their one-shot experiments, propose a measure of informativity based on the number of items in the context that constitute McRae properties. With our syntactic context, we cannot do that.\nitem w has been observed to occur with known concepts c1, . . . , cn, then this measure is the average cosine (AvgCos) of the property distributions (viewed as vectors) of any pair of ci, cj ∈ {c1, . . . , cn}.\nWe evaluate the three informativity measures using Spearman’s rho to determine the correlation of the informativity of a context item with the AP it produces for each unknown concept. We expect frequency and AvgCos to be positively correlated with AP, and entropy to be negatively correlated with AP. The result is shown in Table 5. Again, all measures work better on the Animal data than on QMR, where they at best approach significance. The correlation is much better on the bi-TM models than on the count-based models, which is probably due to their higher-quality predictions. Overall, AvgCos emerges as the most robust indicator for informativity.8 We now test AvgCos, as our best informativity measure, on its ability to select good context items. The last column of Table 2 shows MAP results for the top 20 context items based on their AvgCos values. The results are much below the oracle MAP (unsurprisingly, given the correlations in Table 5), but for QMR they are at the level of the multi-shot results of Table 1, showing that it is possible to some extent to automatically choose informative examples for one-shot learning.\nProperties by type. McRae et al. (2005) classify properties based on the brain region taxonomy of Cree and McRae (2003). This enables us to test what types of properties are learned most easily in our fast-mapping setup by computing average AP separately by property type. To combat sparseness, we group property types into five groups, function (the function or use of an entity), taxonomic, visual, encyclopaedic, and other per-\n8We also tested a binned variant of the frequency measure, on the intuition that medium-frequency context items should be more informative than either highly frequent or rare ones. However, this measure did not show better performance than the non-binned frequency measure.\nceptual (e.g., sound). Intuitively, we would expect our contexts to best reflect taxonomic and function properties: Predicates that apply to noun target concepts often express functions of those targets, and manually specified selectional constraints are often characterized in terms of taxonomic classes. Table 6 confirms this intuition. Taxonomic properties achieve the highest MAP by a large margin, followed by functional properties. Visual properties score the lowest."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "To test whether distributional models, like humans, can learn word meanings from only a single textual occurrence, we have developed several probabilistic distributional models for oneshot learning from textual context only. The models were designed to test the hypothesis that general knowledge about co-occurrences of distributional context items (H1) or about co-occurrences of properties (H2) aids word learning. We find evidence that both kinds of general knowledge are helpful, especially when combined (in the bi-TM), or when used on very clean property data (in the Animal dataset). We further saw that some context items can be highly informative by themselves, and in a preliminary exploration of informativity measures find that average pairwise similarity of seen role fillers (AvgCos) achieves some success in predicting which context items will lead to successful learning.\nOne obvious next step will be to test other types of general knowledge, in particular a taxonomy of known concepts (Xu and Tenenbaum, 2007), or overhypotheses on model hyperparameters (Kemp et al., 2007). We would also like to explore better informativity measures, as there is much room between the the performance of AvgCos and the oracle (Table 2). Knowledge about informative examples can be useful in human-inthe-loop settings, for example a user aiming to illustrate classes in an ontology with a few typical corpus examples.\nWe also note that the bi-TM cannot be used in for truly incremental learning, as the cost of global re-computation after each seen example is prohibitive. We would like to explore probabilistic models that support incremental word learning, which would be interesting to integrate with an overall probabilistic model of semantics (Goodman and Lassiter, 2014).\nFinally, it would be interesting to do distributional one-shot learning that maps to spaces other than a property space, for example again a distributional space.\nAcknowledgements.

We compare to the Partial Least Squares (PLS) model of Herbelot and Vecchi (2015a) to see whether our models perform at state of the art levels. We also compare to a baseline that always predicts the probability of a property to be its relative frequency in the set C of known concepts (Baseline). We can directly use the property probabilities in QMR and the Animal data as concept representations cInd for the Count Independent model. For the Count Multinomial model, we never explicitly compute cMult. To sample from it, we first sample an instance c ∈ {0, 1}|Q| from the independent Bernoulli vector of c, cInd. From the properties that apply to c, we sample one (with equal probabilities) as the observed property. All priors for the count-based models (Beta priors or Dirichlet priors, respectively) are set to 1. For the bi-TM, a pseudo-document for a known concept c is generated as follows. Given an occurrence of known concept c with context item w in the BNC, we sample a property q from c (in the same way as for the Count Multinomial model), and add 〈w, q〉 to the pseudodocument for c. For training the bi-TM, we use collapsed Gibbs sampling (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007) with 500 iterations for burn-in.
