      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Natural language understanding often necessitates deep semantic knowledge. This knowledge needs to be captured at multiple levels, from words to phrases, to sentences, to larger units of discourse. At each level, capturing meaning frequently requires context sensitive abstraction and disambiguation, as shown in the following example (Winograd, 1972):\nEx.1 [Kevin] was robbed by [Robert]. [He] was arrested by the police. Ex.2 [Kevin] was robbed by [Robert]. [He] was rescued by the police.\nIn both cases, one needs to resolve the pronoun “he” to either “Robert” or “Kevin”. To make\nthe correct decisions, one needs to know that the subject of “rob” is more likely than the object of “rob” to be the object of “arrest” while the object of “rob” is more likely to be the object of “rescue”. Thus, beyond understanding individual predicates (e.g., at the semantic role labeling level), there is a need to place them and their arguments in a global context.\nHowever, just modeling semantic frames is not sufficient; consider a variation of Ex.1:\nEx.3 Kevin was robbed by Robert, but the police mistakenly arrested him.\nIn this case, “him” should refer to “Kevin” as the discourse marker “but” reverses the meaning, illustrating that it is necessary to take discourse markers into account when modeling semantics.\nIn this paper we propose that these aspects of semantic knowledge can be modeled as a Semantic Language Model (SemLM). Just like the “standard” syntactic language models (LM), we define a basic vocabulary, a finite representation language, and a prediction task, which allows us to model the distribution over the occurrence of elements in the vocabulary as a function of their (well-defined) context. In difference from syntactic LMs, we represent natural language at a higher level of semantic abstraction, thus facilitating modeling deep semantic knowledge.\nWe propose two distinct discourse driven language models to capture semantics. In our first semantic language model, the Frame-Chain SemLM, we model all semantic frames and discourse markers in the text. Each document is viewed as a single chain of semantic frames and discourse markers. Moreover, while the vocabulary of discourse markers is rather small, the number of different surface form semantic frames that could appear in the text is very large. To achieve a better level of abstraction, we disambiguate semantic frames and map them to their PropBank/FrameNet represen-\ntation. Thus, in Ex.3, the resulting frame chain is “rob.01 — but — arrest.01” (“01” indicates the predicate sense).\nOur second semantic language model is called Entity-Centered SemLM. Here, we model a sequence of semantic frames and discourse markers involved in a specific co-reference chain. For each co-reference chain in a document, we first extract semantic frames corresponding to each co-referent mention, disambiguate them as before, and then determine the discourse markers between these frames. Thus, each unique frame contains both the disambiguated predicate and the argument label of the mention. In Ex.3, the resulting sequence is “rob.01#obj — but — arrest.01#obj” (here “obj” indicates the argument label for “Kevin” and “him” respectively). While these two models capture somewhat different semantic knowledge, we argue later in the paper that both models can be induced at high quality, and that they are suitable for different NLP tasks.\nFor both models of SemLM, we study four language model implementations: N-gram, skipgram (Mikolov et al., 2013b), continuous bagof-words (Mikolov et al., 2013a) and log-bilinear language model (Mnih and Hinton, 2007). Each model defines its own prediction task. In total, we produce eight different SemLMs. Except for Ngram model, others yield embeddings for semantic frames as they are neural language models.\nIn our empirical study, we evaluate both the quality of all SemLMs and their application to coreference resolution and shallow discourse parsing tasks. Following the traditional evaluation standard of language models, we first use perplexity as our metric. We also follow the script learning literature (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008b; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Rudinger et al., 2015) and evaluate on the narrative cloze test, i.e. randomly removing a token from a sequence and test the system’s ability to recover it. We conduct both evaluations on two test sets: a hold-out dataset from the New York Times Corpus and gold sequence data (for frame-chain SemLMs, we use PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002); for entitycentered SemLMs, we use Ontonotes (Hovy et al., 2006) ). By comparing the results on these test sets, we show that we do not incur noticeable degradation when building SemLMs using preprocessing tools. Moreover, we show that SemLMs improves the performance of co-reference resolu-\ntion, as well as that of predicting the sense of discourse connectives for both explicit and implicit ones.\nThe main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows: 1) The design of two novel discourse driven Semantic Language models, building on text abstraction and neural embeddings; 2) The implementation of high quality SemLMs that are shown to improve state-of-theart NLP systems."

      "text" : "Our work is related to script learning. Early works (Schank and Abelson, 1977; Mooney and DeJong, 1985) tried to construct knowledge bases from documents to learn scripts. Recent work focused on utilizing statistical models to extract high-quality scripts from large amounts of data (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008a; Bejan, 2008; Jans et al., 2012; Pichotta and Mooney, 2014; Granroth-Wilding et al., 2015; Pichotta and Mooney, 2016). Other works aimed at learning a collection of structured events (Chambers, 2013; Cheung et al., 2013; Cheung et al., 2013; Balasubramanian et al., 2013; Bamman and Smith, 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015), and several works have employed neural embeddings (Modi and Titov, 2014b; Modi and Titov, 2014a; Frermann et al., 2014; Titov and Khoddam, 2015). Ferraro and Van Durme (2016) presented a unified probabilistic model of syntactic and semantic frames while also demonstrating improved coherence.\nIn our work, the semantic sequences in the entity-centered SemLMs are similar to narrative schemas (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009). However, we differ from them in the following aspects: 1) script learning does not generate a probabilistic model on semantic frames1; 2) script learning models semantic frame sequences incompletely as they do not consider discourse information; 3) works in script learning rarely show applications to real NLP tasks.\nSome prior works have used scripts-related ideas to help improve NLP tasks (Irwin et al., 2011; Rahman and Ng, 2011; Peng et al., 2015b). However, since they use explicit script schemas either as features or constraints, these works suffer from data sparsity problems. In our work, the\n1Some works may utilize a certain probabilistic framework, but they mainly focus on generating high-quality frames by filtering.\nSemLM abstract vocabulary ensures a good coverage of frame semantics."

      "text" : "Semantic Frames A semantic frame is composed of a predicate and its corresponding argument participants. Here we require the predicate to be disambiguated to a specific sense, and we need a certain level of abstraction of arguments so that we can assign abstract labels. The design of PropBank frames (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) and FrameNet frames (Baker et al., 1998) perfectly fits our needs. They both have a limited set of frames (in the scale of thousands) and each frame can be uniquely represented by its predicate sense. These frames provide a good level of generalization as each frame can be instantiated into various surface forms in natural texts. We use these frames as part of our vocabulary for SemLMs. Formally, we use the notation f to represent a frame. Also, we denote fa , f#Arg when referring to an argument role label (Arg) inside a frame (f). Discourse Markers We use discourse markers (connectives) to model discourse relationships between frames. There is only a limited number of unique discourse markers, such as and, but, however, etc. We get the full list from the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008) and include them as part of our vocabulary for SemLMs. Formally, we use dis to denote the discourse marker. Note that discourse relationships can exist without an explicit discourse marker, which is also a challenge for discourse parsing. Since we cannot\nreliably identify implicit discourse relationships, we only consider explicit ones here. More importantly, discourse markers are associated with arguments (Wellner and Pustejovsky, 2007) in text (usually two sentences/clauses, sometimes one). We only add a discourse marker in the semantic sequence when its corresponding arguments contain semantic frames which belong to the same semantic sequence. We call them frame-related discourse markers. Details on generating semantic frames and discourse markers to form semantic sequences are discussed in Sec. 5."

Note that discourse markers do not necessarily exist between all semantic frames. Additionally, we treat the period symbol as a special discourse marker, denoted by “o”.

As the Illinois SRL package is built upon PropBank frames, we do a mapping to FrameNet frames via VerbNet senses (Schuler, 2005), thus achieving a higher level of abstraction. The mapping file4 defines deterministic mappings. However, the mapping is not complete and there are\n2https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19 3http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/software/ 4http://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/fn/vn-fn.xml\nremaining PropBank frames. Thus, the generated vocabulary for SemLMs contains both PropBank and FrameNet frames. For example, “place” and “put” with the VerbNet sense id “9.1-2” are converted to the same FrameNet frame “Placing”.\nAugmenting to Verb Phrases We apply three heuristic modifications to augment semantic frames defined in Sec. 3.1: 1) if a preposition immediately follows a predicate, we append the preposition to the predicate e.g. “take over”; 2) if we encounter the semantic role label AM-PRD which indicates a secondary predicate, we also append this secondary predicate to the main predicate e.g. “be happy”; 3) if we see the semantic role label AM-NEG which indicates negation, we append “not” to the predicate e.g. “not like”. These three augmentations can co-exist and they allow us to model more fine-grained semantic frames.\nVerb Compounds We have observed that if two predicates appear very close to each other, e.g. “eat and drink”, “decide to buy”, they actually represent a unified semantic meaning. Thus, we construct compound verbs to connect them together. We apply the rule that if the gap between two predicates is less than two tokens, we treat them as a unified semantic frame defined by the conjunction of the two (augmented) semantic frames, e.g. “eat.01-drink.01” and “decide.01-buy.01”.\nArgument Labels for Co-referent Mentions To get the argument role label information for coreferent mentions, we need to match each mention to its corresponding semantic role labeling argument. If a mention head is inside an argument, we regard it as a match. We do not consider singleton mentions.\nVocabulary Construction After generating all semantic units for (augmented and compounded) semantic frames and discourse markers, we merge them together as a tentative vocabulary. In order to generate a sensible SemLM, we filter out rare tokens which appear less than 20 times in the data. We add the Unknown token (UNK) and End-ofSequence token (EOS) to the eventual vocabulary.\nStatistics on the eventual SemLM vocabularies and semantic sequences are shown in Table 2. We also compare frame-chain and entity-centered SemLMs to the usual syntactic language model setting. The statistics in Table 2 shows that they are comparable both in vocabulary size and in the total number of tokens for training. Moreover, entity-centered SemLMs have shorter sequences\nthen frame-chain SemLMs. We also provide several examples of high-frequency augmented compound semantic frames in our generated SemLM vocabularies. All are very intuitive:\nwant.01-know.01, agree.01-pay.01, try.01-get.01, decline.02-comment.01, wait.01-see.01, make.02-feel.01, want.01(not)-give.08(up)"

All our SemLMs are trained on the remaining NYT data and tested on this hold-out data. We generate semantic sequences for the training and test data using the methodology described in Sec. 5.\nWe use PropBank data with gold frame annotations as another test set. In this case, we only generate frame-chain SemLM sequences by applying semantic unit generation techniques on gold frames, as described in Sec 5.2. When we test on Gold PropBank Data with Frame Chains, we use frame-chain SemLMs trained from all NYT data.\nSimilarly, we use Ontonotes data (Hovy et al., 2006) with gold frame and co-reference annotations as the third test set, Gold Ontonotes Data with Coref Chains. We only generate entitycentered SemLMs by applying semantic unit generation techniques on gold frames and gold coreference chains, as described in Sec 5.2. Baselines We use Uni-gram (UNI) and Bi-gram (BG) as two language model baselines. In addition, we use the point-wise mutual information (PMI) for token prediction. Essentially, PMI scores each pair of tokens according to their cooccurrences. It predicts a token in the sequence by choosing the one with the highest total PMI with all other tokens in the sequence. We use the ordered PMI (OP) as our baseline, which is a variation of PMI by considering asymmetric counting (Jans et al., 2012)."

LB consistently shows the lowest perplexities for both frame-chain and entity-centered SemLMs across\nall test sets. Similar to syntactic language models, perplexities are fast decreasing from UNI, BI to TRI. Also, CBOW and SG have very close perplexity results which indicate that their language modeling abilities are at the same level.\nWe can compare the results of our frame-chain SemLM on NYT Hold-out Data and Gold PropBank Data with Frame Chains, and our entitycentered SemLM on NYT Hold-out Data and Gold Ontonotes Data with Coref Chains. While we see differences in the results, the gap is narrow and the relative ranking of different SemLMs does not change. This indicates that the automatic SRL and Co-reference annotations added some noise but, more importantly, that the resulting SemLMs are robust to this noise as we still retain the language modeling ability for all methods.\nAdditionally, our ablation study removes the “FrameNet Mapping” step in Sec. 5.2 (“FC-FM” and “EC-FM” rows), resulting in only using PropBank frames in the vocabulary. The increase in perplexities shows that “FrameNet Mapping” does produce a higher level of abstraction, which is useful for language modeling."

(2015) points out, the narrative cloze test can be regarded as a language modeling evaluation. In the narrative cloze test, we randomly choose and remove one token from each semantic sequence in the test set. We then use language models to predict the missing token and evaluate the correct-\nness. For all SemLMs, we use the conditional probabilities defined in Sec. 4 to get token predictions. We also use ordered PMI as an additional baseline. The narrative cloze test is conducted on the same test sets as the perplexity evaluation. We use mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and recall at 30 (Recall@30) to evaluate.\nResults are provided in Table 4. Consistent with the results in the perplexity evaluation, LB outperforms other methods for both frame-chain and entity-centered SemLMs across all test sets. It is interesting to see that UNI performs better than BG in this prediction task. This finding is also reflected in the results reported in Rudinger et al. (2015). Though CBOW and SG have similar perplexity results, SG appears to be stronger in the narrative cloze test. With respect to the strongest baseline (UNI), LB achieves close to 20% relative improvement for Recall@30 metric on NYT hold-out data. On gold data, the frame-chain\nSemLMs get a relative improvement of 36.5% for Recall@30 while entity-centered SemLMs get 22.3%. For MRR metric, the relative improvement is around half that of the Recall@30 metric.\nIn the narrative cloze test, we also carry out an ablation study to remove the “FrameNet Mapping” step in Sec. 5.2 (“FC-FM” and “EC-FM” rows). The decrease in MRR and Recall@30 metrics further strengthens the argument that “FrameNet Mapping” is important for language modeling as it improves the generalization on frames.\nWe cannot directly compare with other related works (Rudinger et al., 2015; Pichotta and Mooney, 2016) because of the differences in data and evaluation metrics. Rudinger et al. (2015) also use the NYT portion of the Gigaword corpus, but with Concrete annotations; Pichotta and Mooney (2016) use the English Wikipedia as their data, and Stanford NLP tools for pre-processing while we use the Illinois NLP tools. Consequently, the even-\ntual chain statistics are different, which leads to different test instances.5 We counter this difficulty by reporting results on “Gold PropBank Data” and “Gold Ontonotes Data”. We hope that these two gold annotation datasets can become standard test sets. Rudinger et al. (2015) does share a common evaluation metric with us: MRR. If we ignore the data difference and make a rough comparison, we find that the absolute values of our results are better while Rudinger et al. (2015) have higher relative improvement (“Rel-Impr” in Table 4). This means that 1) the discourse information is very likely to help better model semantics 2) the discourse information may boost the baseline (UNI) more than it does for the LB model."

We may also get an additional discourse marker between these two frames, e.g. (fa1, dis, fa2). Now, we add the following conditional probability as the feature from SemLMs:\npc = p(fa2|fa1, dis).\nWe also add p2c , √ pc and 1/pc as features. To get the value of pc, we follow the definitions in Sec. 4, and we only use the entity-centered SemLM here as its vocabulary covers frames with argument labels.

We use the standard split of 268 training documents, 68 development documents, and 106 testing documents for ACE04 data (Culotta et al., 2007; Bengtson and Roth, 2008).

Tri-grams with conditional probability features improve the performance by a small margin, while the log-bilinear model achieves a 0.4-0.5 F1 points improvement. By employing log-bilinear model embeddings, we further improve the numbers and we outperform the best reported results on the CoNLL12 dataset (Wiseman et al., 2015).\nIn addition, we carry out ablation studies to remove all discourse makers during the language modeling process.

While our LB model can still exhibit improvement over the base system, its performance is lower than the proposed discourse driven version, which means that discourse information improves the expressiveness of semantic language models."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "The paper builds two types of discourse driven semantic language models with four different language model implementations that make use of neural embeddings for semantic frames. We use perplexity and a narrative cloze test to prove that the proposed SemLMs have a good level of abstraction and are of high quality, and then apply them successfully to the two challenging tasks of co-reference resolution and shallow discourse parsing, exhibiting improvements over state-ofthe-art systems. In future work, we plan to apply SemLMs to other semantic related NLP tasks e.g. machine translation and question answering."

We develop two distinct models that capture semantic frame chains and discourse information while abstracting over the specific mentions of predicates and entities. For each model, we investigate four implementations: a “standard” N-gram language model and three discriminatively trained “neural” language models that generate embeddings for semantic frames. The quality of the semantic language models (SemLM) is evaluated both intrinsically, using perplexity and a narrative cloze test and extrinsically – we show that our SemLM helps improve performance on semantic natural language processing tasks such as co-reference resolution and discourse parsing.",
