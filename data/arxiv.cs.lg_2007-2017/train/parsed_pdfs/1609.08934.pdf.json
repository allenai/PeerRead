Weakly dominated pure strategies can be detected and eliminated in polynomial time by solving a linear program. Furthermore, interior symmetric equilibria are a special case of a more general notion, namely, that of an “equalizer,” which can also be computed efficiently in polynomial time by solving a linear program. An elegant “symmetrization method” of bimatrix games [Jurg et al., 1992] and the well-known PPAD-completeness results on equilibrium computation in bimatrix games [Daskalakis et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2009] imply then the compelling P = PPAD."

      "text" : "This paper is an intellectual exercise using multiplicative weights. There are many variants and our results are perhaps not strongly bound to any particular multiplicative weights algorithm, but our favorite is Hedge [Freund and Schapire, 1997, 1999], which we use as a friendly companion to indulge in our intellectual pursuit. Our motivation is to compute Nash equilibria in polynomial time, noting up front that we do not necessarily use Hedge to compute them—for example, we can show as a simple implication of stronger properties that Hedge diverges from the equilibrium of rock-paper-scissors—but we use Hedge to prove some very nice equilibrium properties as well some properties on the structure of strategic games. The fact that Hedge does not necessarily converge is not necessarily bad—we believe it can be used as a powerful model of “evolutionary behavior” (in the sense of dynamical systems as well as that of biology) to explore “terrains” whether physical or conceptual. This paper actually amounts to some notion of proof of such a claim."

      "text" : "There are many ways to understand the mathematics of this paper, but one of the most fruitful is as a thought experiment: Can multiplicative weights serve as game theory’s foundation? The dominant approach to understanding game theory is by means of the best response, the Nash equilibrium, and how the two are related—the Nash equilibrium is a profile against which no player has an incentive to deviate or, equivalently, it is a fixed point of the game’s best response correspondence. The major problem with this approach is that alternating best responses may oscillate (or worse) and, therefore, game theory’s “natural dynamic” does not correspond to an equilibrium computation algorithm. Nevertheless, the concept of the best response dynamic is very helpful as it can be used\nto prove that a Nash equilibrium always exists which is soothing in founding a theory of strategic behavior based on the Nash equilibrium. So let us go back to our own question:"

      "heading" : "1.3 Our detailed results and techniques",
      "text" : "Best response dynamics are very problematic because they are discontinuous (and, therefore, often oscillatory or worse). One very prolific way of viewing multiplicative weights is as a continuous approximation of best responses, a point which we support by a lemma: Multiplicative weights are a continuous better response dynamic (for arbitrary values of the learning rate parameter). We do not use this lemma in any of our results and we give it only as an illustration of this important idea. Continuity and the better response property are important in a variety of ways not all of which we explore here. However, our main result crucially relies on this continuity property along with the continuity of the relative entropy function (known also as Kullback-Leibler divergence) and the elementary result in analysis that the composition of continuous functions is continuous."

Symmetric equilibria in symmetric N -person (and, therefore, also 2-person) games are guaranteed to exist [Nash, 1951]. Symmetric equilibria are also a foundational concept in evolutionary game theory [Maynard Smith and Price, 1973, Maynard Smith, 1982] but we designate evolutionary aspects of equilibrium computation as out of scope of the present paper simply to facilitate a more concise exposition of our results. Having laid out our overarching strategy and approach, we should point out that our main techniques consist in two parts, namely, in definitions and results on the properties of the concepts they define."

      "heading" : "1.3.2 Our main definitions",
      "text" : "An important idea in this paper is captured in the notion of an equalizer, an equilibrium notion generalizing interior equilibria. This idea emerged as follows: Chen et al. [2009] point out that a simple (inefficient) algorithm to find an equilibrium of a (general) bimatrix game is by support enumeration and the solution of a corresponding linear (feasibility) program iteratively for each support until an equilibrium is found. Of course the number of possible supports is exponential and, therefore, this algorithm is inefficient in all games but those with a small number of pure strategies. But there is an important detail in their formulation that can easily go unnoticed:\nGiven some support, the linear program Chen et al. [2009] formulate equalizes the pure strategies in the support and restricts the pure strategies outside the support to yield payoffs that are not superior to the payoffs pure strategies in the support yield. The important observation is that the solution of this linear program can yield an equilibrium lying outside the given support wherein the linear feasibility program is invoked (in that some pure strategies can receive zero probability). The idea of an equalizer emerged in the effort to understand when this phenomenon occurs.\nOne very important “technical result” in this paper (which can be used to prove P = PPAD as a simple exercise) is what happens to a symmetric bimatrix game if there is no equalizer. One algorithmically interesting answer is that the absence of an equalizer implies the existence of a weakly dominated pure strategy, which can be detected and eliminated in polynomial time [Conitzer and Sandholm, 2005] without missing out on the overall equilibrium computation objective."

Freund and Schapire [1997] extend this algorithm to the problems of “online allocation” as well as that of“boosting.” Arora et al. [2012] treat the history and applications of such algorithms to learning, game theory, and optimization rather comprehensively.\nFreund and Schapire [1999] prove convergence of a multiplicative weights algorithm to the value of a zero-sum game—the algorithm is employed by one of the two player positions and the opponent in the other position is assumed to be arbitrary. We note their result does not imply convergence to the minimax equilibrium, but it furnishes an alternative proof of von Neumann’s minimax theorem.\nMinimax equilibria in zero-sum games (such as the equilibrium of the rock-paper-scissors game) may “repel” the multiplicative weights dynamic (but not always). This is easy to prove using modified versions of analytical techniques employed in this paper (but the proof is omitted for brevity). We note their proof techniques are based on the relative entropy as in this paper.\nSimilar negative results that multiplicative weights are not convergent to Nash equilibria are obtained by [Daskalakis et al., 2010] and [Balkan et al., 2012]. We note that, as mentioned earlier, we do not use multiplicative weights to compute Nash equilibria but rather as a mathematical tool to “probe” (and characterize) the incentive (payoff) structure of strategic games."

      "text" : "PPAD (Polynomial Parity Arguments on Directed graphs) is a complexity class introduced by Papadimitriou [1994] to capture the difficulty of finding Brouwer fixed points. The archetypical problem in this class is to find an unbalanced vertex in a directed graph given some other unbalanced vertex in the same graph. Such a vertex can always be found but the conjecture was that the amount of time required to find one is exponential. Since PPAD was introduced, various problems have been shown to be PPAD-complete such as that of computing an N -player Nash equilibrium [Daskalakis et al., 2009] and that of computing a 2-player Nash equilibrium [Chen et al., 2009]. Adding support to the conjecture that PPAD captures hard problems, the Lemke-Howson algorithm, generally regarded as the most efficient algorithm for computing a 2-player Nash equilibrium, was shown to run in exponential time in the worst case [Savani and von Stengel, 2004].\nThere are two important threads of results on equilibrium computation and approximation, namely, the approximation of Nash equilibria in bimatrix games and the approximation of KKT (Karush, Kuhn, and Tucker) points in quadratic programs:\n(1) With respect to the first thread of results, under the assumption that PPAD 6= P the most significant open question concerned the existence of a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for equilibrium computation in bimatrix games (as it was well-known [Chen et al., 2009] that a full polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) would imply P = PPAD, which was considered unlikely). There are two notions of approximation, namely, additive approximations and multiplicative ones. The first quasi-polynomial algorithm for additively approximate Nash equilibria in bimatrix games is due to Lipton et al. [2003] based on the principle of looking for equilibria of small support. There is a rich literature on the additively and multiplicatively approximations of Nash equilibria. An interesting alternative approach, however, is to find an exact Nash equilibrium with high probability. Bárány et al. [2005] present an algorithm for finding a Nash equilibrium in random 2-player games that runs in polynomial time with high probability. This algorithm is based on searching for equilibria of small support. We note that the general methods employed in this thread of research depart significantly from our algorithmic and proof techniques:\nThe algorithm we present in this paper instead looks for equilibria of (possibly) large support (as equalizers are typically, but not always so, interior equilibria) and iteratively reduces the size of the game (by iterated elimination of weakly dominated pure strategies), checking for an equalizer in each step, until a single pure strategy remains (implying the game is dominance solvable). Alternatively, one may iteratively reduce the size of the basis game by iterated elimination until no further reduction is possible in which case our results imply the existence of an equalizer. As noted earlier, in contrast to other previous equilibrium computation efforts, our algorithm focuses on symmetric bimatrix games trying to find an equilibrium that is symmetric. (Given a bimatrix game an “equivalent” symmetric bimatrix game can be obtained by the Gale, Kuhn, and Tucker symmetrization method [Jurg et al., 1992].) We have not verified if the absence of an equalizer in general bimatrix games implies the existence of a weakly dominated pure strategy.\n(2) With respect to the second thread of results symmetric equilibria in doubly symmetric bimatrix games (that is, symmetric bimatrix games wherein the payoff matrix is symmetric) are known to coincide with KKT points of a quadratic optimization problem whose objective function is X ·SX, where S is the symmetric payoff matrix and X is a mixed strategy, and whose constraint set is a standard (probability) simplex corresponding to the space of mixed strategies. The computation of KKT points in (general) quadratic programs is known to admit an FPTAS [Ye, 1998]. Our results in this paper imply a polynomial-time algorithm for computing KKT points of quadratic programs over the probability simplex. We believe that our results can be extended to general quadratic programs (over general polytopes) but we have not verified the conjecture."

But let us precisely define the (well-known in game theory) notion of dominance and see how this subroutine can run in polynomial time (with the complexity of linear programming).\nThere are two versions of dominance the stronger of which is commonly referred to as “strict dominance.” Let us give the precise definition:\nDefinition 2. We say that the pure strategy Ei of (C,C T ) is strictly dominated if\n∃X ∈ X(C,CT ) ∀Y ∈ X(C,CT ) : Ei · CY < X · CY.\nIt is well known that eliminating a strictly dominated strategy cannot eliminate equilibria.

(Note also that, in weak iterated elimination, the order of elimination matters in that the surviving equilibria depend on the order by which strategies are eliminated. This matter is rather tangential to the main subject and result of this paper although a careful treatment of the subject is certainly important. Note that checking if a pure strategy is weakly dominated (by some mixed strategy) admits a polynomial-time algorithm (with the complexity of linear programming) [Conitzer and Sandholm, 2005] (see also [Myerson, 1991] and for iterated dominance see also [Knuth et al., 1988])."

The first order principle of the multiplicative weights approach to game theory is, not surprisingly, a fixed point of the multiplicative weights dynamic. In this section, we show how the two concepts are related. We refer to Nash fixed points as “equilibria” and to multiplicative weights fixed points as “fixed points” simply for reasons of remaining backward compatible with the game-theoretic nomenclature.\nDefinition 5. We say X∗ ∈ X(C,CT ) is a fixed point of (C,CT ) if it is a fixed point of (1). That is, if X∗ = T (X∗). We denote the set of fixed points of (C,CT ) by FX(C,CT ).

X ∈ FX(C,CT ) if and only if, X is a pure strategy or otherwise\n∀i, j ∈ C(X) : (CX)i = (CX)j .\nProof. First we show sufficiency, that is, if for all i, j ∈ C(X), (CX)i = (CX)j , then T (X) = X: Some of the coordinates of X are zero and some are positive. Clearly, the zero coordinates will not become positive after applying the map. Now, notice that, for all i ∈ C(X), exp{α(X)(CX)i} = ∑n\nj=1X(j) exp{α(X)(CX)j}. Therefore, T (X) = X. Now we show necessity, that is, ifX is a fixed point of Hedge, then for all i and for all i, j ∈ C(X),\n(CX)i = (CX)j : Let X̂(i) = Ti(x). Because X is a fixed point, X̂(i) = X(i).

This is a necessary condition for equilibrium but it is not sufficient:\nLemma 2. If X∗ ∈ X̊(C,CT ), X∗ ∈ FX(C,CT ) if and only if X∗ ∈ NE+(C,CT ).\nProof. The lemma is a straightforward implication of the aforementioned best response condition and Theorem 1: Suppose the interior X∗ ∈ NE+(C,CT ) and recall the best response condition: X is a best response to Y if and only if X(i) > 0 ⇒ (CY )i = (CY )max. But a symmetric Nash equilibrium strategy is a best response to itself, therefore, X∗(i) > 0 ⇒ (CX∗)i = (CX\n∗)max. Since X∗ is interior, for all i ∈ K(C,CT ), X∗(i) > 0, therefore,\n∀i, j ∈ C(X∗) : (CX∗)i = (CX ∗)j .\nThe characterization of fixed points in Theorem 1 completes the proof.\nAs a straightforward implication of the previous lemma we obtain:\nLemma 3. If X∗ ∈ FX(C,CT )/NE+(C,CT ), then X∗ ∈ X̄(C,CT ). That is, every non-equilibrium fixed point is a boundary strategy.\nProof. If X∗ 6∈ X̄(C,CT ), then X∗ ∈ X̊(C,CT ).\nOverall we obtain:\nCorollary 1. NE+(C,CT ) ⊆ FX(C,CT ).\nProof. Every symmetric equilibrium strategy is an equalizer of the its corresponding carrier game by Lemma 2.\nThe fundamental difference between fixed points and equilibria is that fixed points survive “inversion” of incentives. We call this principle “the virtue of vice versa” and it is proven next:\nTheorem 2. FX(C,CT ) = FX(−C,−CT ).\nProof. The theorem clearly holds for all pure fixed points. Furthermore, by Theorem 1, X∗ ∈ FX+(C,CT ) if and only if\n∀X ∈ X(C∗, C∗T ) : (X∗ −X) · C∗X∗ = 0\nwhere C∗ is X∗’s carrier game. This completes the proof.\nWe do not invoke the virtue of vice versa in this paper, but it is important to keep in mind."

We need the following result on strategic dominance due to Pearce [1984] (see also [Weibull, 1995, p. 14]):\nProposition 4. The pure strategy Ei of (C,C T ) is undominated if and only if\n∃X ∈ X̊(C,CT ) : Ei is a best response to X.\nWe also need the following lemmas:\nLemma 9. Let Y ∈ X̄(C,CT ) and X ∈ X̊(C,CT ). If RE(Y, T (X)) is strictly convex, then exactly one of the following hold:\n(i) limα→∞ (RE(Y, T (X)) −RE(Y,X)) = +∞.\n(ii) limα→∞ (RE(Y, T (X)) −RE(Y,X)) < 0.\nFurthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition for (ii) is that Y is a best response to X.\nProof. By the “convexity lemma” (Lemma 4), RE(Y, T (X)) is strictly convex if and only if X is not a fixed point. So let us assume this is the case. There are now three possibilities:\nFirst possibility: Assume (Y −X) · CX ≤ 0. Then the “instability lemma” (Lemma 7) implies\nlim α→∞ (RE(Y, T (X)) −RE(Y,X)) = +∞.\nSecond possibility: Assume (Y −X) · CX > 0 but Y is not a best response to X. Recall (5):\nRE(Y, X̂)−RE(Y,X) = ln\n\n\nn ∑\nj=1\nX(j) exp {α ((CX)j − Y · CX)}\n\n\nand note that by the assumption that Y is not a best response to X there exists i such that (CX)i > Y · CX implying that\nlim α→∞\n\n\nn ∑\nj=1\nX(j) exp {α ((CX)j − Y · CX)}\n\n = +∞.\nTherefore,\nlim α→∞ (RE(Y, T (X)) −RE(Y,X)) = +∞.\nThird possibility: Assume Y is a best response to X (implying (Y −X) ·CX > 0). Then Lemma 6 implies that\nlim α→∞ (RE(Y, T (X)) −RE(Y,X)) < 0.\nThis completes the proof.\nLemma 10. Suppose X̊(C,CT ) ∩ FX(C,CT ) = ∅, let X ∈ X̊, and\nY ∈ argmax{Y · CX|Y ∈ X(C,CT )}.\nThat is, Y is a best response to X. Then\n∀X ∈ X̊(C,CT ) : Y ∈ argmax{Y · CX|Y ∈ X(C,CT )}.\nProof. It is well-known that the best response correspondence is upper hemicontinuous. Finally, upper hemicontinuity of the best response correspondence implies that the set of strategies against which Y is a best response (that is, the lower inverse of Y under the best response correspondence) is closed [Corbae et al., 2009, Theorem 6.1.23]. Suppose now Y is a best response to an interior strategy and that the boundary of the set of strategies against which Y is a best response intersects the interior X̊(C,CT ) of the probability simplex of (C,CT ). Let X lie on the boundary of the intersection. Then there exists X ′ ∈ X̊(C,CT ) such that\n∀ǫ ∈ (0, 1] : Y 6∈ argmax{Y · CX(ǫ)|Y ∈ X(C,CT )}\nwhere\nX(ǫ) = (1− ǫ)X + ǫX ′.\nThat is, Y is best response against X but it is not a best response against any other X(ǫ). Since, for all X ∈ X̊(C,CT ), X 6∈ FX(C,CT ), for all X ∈ X̊(C,CT ), RE(Y, T (X)) is strictly convex (by the convexity lemma). Lemma 9 implies then that\nlim α→∞ (RE(Y, T (X)) −RE(Y,X)) < 0\nand\n∀ǫ ∈ (0, 1] : lim α→∞ (RE(Y, T (X(ǫ))) −RE(Y,X(ǫ))) = +∞.\nSince RE(Y, T (X(ǫ)))−RE(Y,X(ǫ)) is continuous, this is clearly impossible. Hence the lemma.\nLemma 11. Suppose X̊(C,CT ) ∩ FX(C,CT ) = ∅, let X ∈ X̊, and\nY ∈ argmax{Y · CX|Y ∈ X(C,CT )}.\nThat is, Y is a best response to X. Then\n∀X ∈ X̊(C,CT ) : (Y −X) · CX > 0.\nProof. Since X 6∈ NE+(C,CT ), the best response condition (Proposition 2) implies that\nY ∈ argmax{Y · CX|Y ∈ X(C,CT )} ⇒ (Y −X) · CX > 0\nand, then, Lemma 10 completes and proof.\nUsing the previous lemma we obtain the following theorem, which is a statement about the incentive structure of a symmetric bimatrix game without an (interior) equalizer:\nTheorem 3. X̊(C,CT )∩FX(C,CT ) = ∅ if and only if there exists a weakly dominated pure strategy of (C,CT ).\nProof. By Proposition 4, the pure strategy Ei is undominated if and only if it is a best response to some interior (completely mixed) strategy. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction that every pure strategy is a best response to some interior strategy. Then Lemma 11 implies\n∀i ∈ K(C,CT ) ∀X ∈ X̊(C,CT ) : (Ei −X) · CX > 0. (9)\nWe consider two possibilities:\nFirst possibility: Assume first K(C,CT ) ≥ 3: Consider a pure strategy Ei, a pair of pure strategies Ej1 6= Ej2 different from Ei, and let Y = (1 − ǫ)Ej1 + ǫEj2 , ǫ ∈ (0, 1), such that there exists a convex combination of Ei and Y in X̊(C,C T ). Then all such convex combinations are interior. Furthermore (9) implies\n∀X as convex combinations of Ei and Y : (Ei −X) · CX > 0 and (Y −X) · CX > 0,\nwhich is clearly an impossibility as (Ei −X) ·CX > 0 implies the angle between the payoff vector CX and Ei−X is acute and (Y −X)·CX > 0 similarly. But Ei−X and Y −X point in exactly opposite directions leading to a contradiction. Therefore, there exists a weakly dominated pure strategy.\nSecond possibility: If K(C,CT ) = 2, the argument is entirely analogous.\nThe reverse direction is straightforward from Propositions 3 and 4: If X̊(C,CT )∩FX(C,CT ) 6= ∅, every pure strategy is a best response to the interior symmetric equilibrium strategy by Proposition 3 (on best responses). Therefore, Proposition 4 implies every pure strategy is undominated.\nBased on the previous results, we have:"

Freund and Schapire [1999] prove convergence of a multiplicative weights algorithm to the value of a zero-sum game—the algorithm is employed by one of the two player positions and the opponent in the other position is assumed to be arbitrary. We note their result does not imply convergence to the minimax equilibrium, but it furnishes an alternative proof of von Neumann’s minimax theorem. Minimax equilibria in zero-sum games (such as the equilibrium of the rock-paper-scissors game) may “repel” the multiplicative weights dynamic (but not always). This is easy to prove using modified versions of analytical techniques employed in this paper (but the proof is omitted for brevity). We note their proof techniques are based on the relative entropy as in this paper. Similar negative results that multiplicative weights are not convergent to Nash equilibria are obtained by [Daskalakis et al., 2010] and [Balkan et al., 2012]. We note that, as mentioned earlier, we do not use multiplicative weights to compute Nash equilibria but rather as a mathematical tool to “probe” (and characterize) the incentive (payoff) structure of strategic games. 1.4.2 Equilibrium computation and approximation PPAD (Polynomial Parity Arguments on Directed graphs) is a complexity class introduced by Papadimitriou [1994] to capture the difficulty of finding Brouwer fixed points.",

Weakly dominated pure strategies can be detected and eliminated in polynomial time by solving a linear program. Furthermore, interior symmetric equilibria are a special case of a more general notion, namely, that of an “equalizer,” which can also be computed efficiently in polynomial time by solving a linear program. An elegant “symmetrization method” of bimatrix games [Jurg et al., 1992] and the well-known PPAD-completeness results on equilibrium computation in bimatrix games [Daskalakis et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2009] imply then the compelling P = PPAD.",
