      "text" : "Automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT) systems without human intervention has gained importance. For example, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) has improved the MT research in the last decade. However, BLEU has little correlation with human judgment on the segment level since it is originally proposed for system-level evaluation. Segment-level evaluation is crucial for analyzing MT outputs to improve the system accuracy, but there are few studies addressing the issue of segment-level evaluation of MT outputs.\nAnother issue in MT evaluation is to evaluate MT hypotheses that are semantically equivalent with different surfaces from the reference. For instance, BLEU does not consider any words that do not match the reference at the surface level. METEOR-Universal (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014) handles word similarities better,\n∗The last author is currently affiliated with Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan.\nbut it uses external resources that require timeconsuming annotations. It is also not as simple as BLEU and its score is difficult to interpret. DREEM (Chen and Guo, 2015), another metric that addresses the issue of word similarity, does not require human annotations and uses distributed representations for MT evaluation. It shows higher accuracy than popular metrics such as BLEU and METEOR.\nTherefore, we follow the approach of DREEM to propose a lightweight MT evaluation measure that employs only a raw corpus as an external resource. We adopt sentence similarity measures proposed by Song and Roth (2015) for a Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task. They use word embeddings to align words so that the sentence similarity score takes near-synonymous expressions into account and propose three types of heuristics using m:n (average), 1:n (maximum) and 1:1 (Hungarian) alignments. It has been reported that sentence similarity calculated with a word alignment based on word embeddings shows high accuracy on STS tasks.\nWe evaluated the word-alignment-based sentence similarity for MT evaluation to use the WMT12, WMT13, and WMT15 datasets of European–English translation and WAT2015 and NTCIR8 datasets of Japanese–English translation. Experimental results confirmed that the maximum alignment similarity outperforms previous word embeddings-based methods in European– English translation tasks and the average alignment similarity has the highest human correlation in Japanese–English translation tasks."

METEOR-Universal (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014) alleviates the problem of surface mismatch by using a thesaurus and a stemmer but it needs external resources, such as WordNet. In this work, we used a distributed word representation to evaluate semantic relatedness between the hypothesis and reference sentences. This approach has the advantage that it can be implemented only with only a raw monolingual corpus.\nTo address the problem of word n-gram precision, Wang and Merlo (2016) propose to smooth it by word embeddings. They also employ maximum alignment between n-grams of hypothesis and reference sentences and a threshold to cut off n-gram embeddings with low similarity. Their work is similar to our maximum alignment similarity method, but they only experimented in European–English datasets, where maximum alignment works better than average alignment.\nThe previous method most similar to ours is DREEM (Chen and Guo, 2015). It has shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy compared with popular metrics such as BLEU and METEOR. It uses various types of representations such as word and sentence representations. Word representations are trained with a neural network and sentence representations are trained with a recursive auto-encoder, respectively. DREEM uses cosine similarity between distributed representations of hypothesis and reference as a translation evaluation score. Both their and our methods employ word embeddings to compute sentence similarity score, but our method differs in the use of alignment and length penalty. As for alignment, we set a threshold to remove noisy alignments, whereas they use a hyper-parameter to down-weight overall sentence similarity. As for length penalty, we compared average, maximum, and Hungarian alignments to compensate for the difference between the lengths of translation hypothesis and reference, whereas they use an exponential penalty to normalize the length.\nAnother way to improve the robustness of MT evaluation is to use a character-based model. CHRF (Popović, 2015) is one such metric that uses character n-grams. It is a harmonic mean of character n-gram precision and recall. It works\nwell for morphologically rich languages. We, instead, adopt a word-based approach because our target language, English, is morphologically simple but etymologically complex."

Song and Roth (2015) propose to use word embeddings to align words in a pair of sentences. Their approach shows promising results in STS tasks.\nIn MT evaluation, a word in the source language aligns to either a word or a phrase in the target language; therefore, it is not likely for a word to align with the whole sentence. Thus, we use several heuristics to constrain word alignment between the hypothesis and reference sentences.\nIn the following subsections, we present three sentence similarity measures. All of them use cosine similarity to calculate word similarity. To avoid alignment between unrelated words, we cut off word alignment whose similarity is less than a threshold value."

For the WMT datasets, MAS has the highest correlation scores among the three word-alignment-based methods. A threshold value of 0.2 gives the maximum correlation for MAS for all WMT datasets.\nFigure 2 shows correlation of word-alignmentbased methods for the two Japanese–English\n1https://code.google.com/archive/p/ word2vec/\ndatasets with a varying threshold.

      "heading" : "5 Discussion",
      "text" : "Figure 1 demonstrated that MAS and AAS are more stable than HAS for European–English datasets. This may be because it is relatively easy for the AAS and MAS to perform word alignment using word embeddings in translation pairs of similar languages, but HAS suffers from alignment sparsity more than the other methods. In European–English translation, all the wordalignment-based methods perform poorly when using no word embeddings.\nUnlike the European–English translation task, the Japanese–English translation task exhibits a different tendency. Figure 2 shows the comparison between three types of word-alignment-based methods for each threshold. This is partly because word embeddings help evaluating lexically similar word pairs but fail to model syntactic variations. Also, we note that in Japanese–English datasets, AAS achieved the highest correlation. We suppose that this is because in Japanese–English transla-\ntion, it is difficult to cover all the source information in the target language, resulting in misalignment of inadequate words by HAS and MAS.\nTable 2 shows that MAS performs stably on the WMT datasets. In particular, Kendall’s τ score of HAS in WMT12 exhibits very low correlation. It seems that the 1:1 alignment is too strict to calculate sentence similarity in MT evaluation, while the 1:m (MAS) alignment performs well, possibly because of the removal of noisy word alignment. On the other hand, AAS is more stable than MAS and HAS for WAT2015 and NTCIR8 datasets. As a rule of thumb, AAS with high threshold values (0.6–0.9) shows stable high correlation across all language pairs, but if it is possible to use development data to tune the parameters, MAS with different values of thresholds should be considered."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",

In our experiments, MAS showed higher correlation with human evaluation than other automatic MT metrics such as BLEU and DREEM for European–English datasets. On the other hand, for Japanese–English datasets, AAS showed higher correlation with human evaluation than other metrics. These results indicate that appropriate word alignment using word embeddings is helpful in evaluating the MT output."
