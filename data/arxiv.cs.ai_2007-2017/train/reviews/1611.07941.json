It has attracted much interest in the Computer Vision community to efficiently solve problems expressible in terms of large Conditional Random Fields. However, since it models the posterior probability distribution as a product of marginal probabilities, it may fail to properly account for important dependencies between variables. We therefore replace the fully factorized distribution of Mean Field by a weighted mixture of such distributions, that similarly minimizes the KL-Divergence to the true posterior. By introducing two new ideas, namely, conditioning on groups of variables instead of single ones and using a parameter of the conditional random field potentials, that we identify to the temperature in the sense of statistical physics to select such groups, we can perform this minimization efficiently. Our extension of the clamping method proposed in previous works allows us to both produce a more descriptive approximation of the true posterior and, inspired by the diverse MAP paradigms, fit a mixture of Mean Field approximations. We demonstrate that this positively impacts real-world algorithms that initially relied on mean fields.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 19:14:25 GMT  (2082kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07941v1", "Submitted for review to CVPR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted for review to CVPR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["pierre baqu\\'e", "fran\\c{c}ois fleuret", "pascal fua"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.07941"}
