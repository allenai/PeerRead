      "text" : "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are able to represent long-term dependencies in sequential data, by adapting and propagating a deterministic hidden (or latent) state [6, 17]. There is recent evidence that when complex sequences such as speech and music are modeled, the performances of RNNs can be dramatically improved when uncertainty is included in their hidden states [3, 4, 8, 12, 13, 16]. In this paper we add a new direction to the explorer’s map of treating the hidden RNN states as uncertain paths, by including the world of state space models (SSMs) as an RNN layer. By cleanly delineating a SSM layer, certain independence properties of variables arise, which are beneficial for making efficient posterior inferences. The result is a generative model for sequential data, with a matching inference network that has its roots in variational auto-encoders (VAEs).\nSSMs can be viewed as a probabilistic extension of RNNs, where the hidden states are assumed to be random variables. Although SSMs have an illustrious history [27], their stochasticity has limited their widespread use in the deep learning community, as inference can only be exact for two relatively simple classes of SSMs, namely hidden Markov models and linear Gaussian models, neither of which are well-suited to modeling long-term dependencies and complex probability distributions over high-dimensional sequences. On the other hand modern RNNs rely on gated nonlinearities such as long short-term memory (LSTM) [17] cells or gated recurrent units (GRUs) [7], that let the deterministic hidden state of the RNN act as an internal memory for the model. This internal memory seems fundamental to capturing complex relationships in the data through a statistical model.\nThis paper introduces the stochastic recurrent neural network (SRNN) in Section 3. SRNNs combine the gated activation mechanism of RNNs with the stochastic states of SSMs, and are formed by stacking a RNN and a nonlinear SSM. The state transitions of the SSM are nonlinear and are parametrized by a neural network that also depend on the corresponding RNN hidden state. The SSM can therefore utilize long-term information captured by the RNN.\nWe use recent advances in variational inference to efficiently approximate the intractable posterior distribution over the latent states with an inference network [21, 26]. The form of our variational\n∗Now at Google DeepMind.\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n07 57\n1v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 4\nM ay\n2 01\napproximation is inspired by the independence properties of the true posterior distribution over the latent states of the model, and allows us to improve inference by conveniently using the information coming from the whole sequence at each time step. The posterior distribution over the latent states of the SRNN is highly non-stationary while we are learning the parameters of the model. To further improve the variational approximation, we show that we can construct the inference network so that it only needs to learn how to compute the mean of the variational approximation at each time step given the mean of the predictive prior distribution.\nIn Section 4 we test the performances of SRNN on speech and polyphonic music modelling tasks. SRNN improves the state of the art results on the Blizzard and TIMIT speech data sets by a large margin, and performs comparably to competing models on polyphonic music modeling. Finally, other models that extend RNNs by adding stochastic units will be reviewed and compared to SRNN in Section 5."

      "text" : "Recurrent neural networks and state space models are widely used to model temporal sequences of vectors x1:T = (x1,x2, . . . ,xT ) that possibly depend on inputs u1:T = (u1,u2, . . . ,uT ). Both models rest on the assumption that the sequence x1:t of observations up to time t can be summarized by a latent state dt or zt, which is deterministically determined (dt in a RNN) or treated as a random variable which is averaged away (zt in a SSM). The difference in treatment of the latent state has traditionally led to vastly different models: RNNs recursively compute dt = f(dt−1,ut) using a parameterized nonlinear function f , like a LSTM cell or a GRU. The RNN observation probabilities p(xt|dt) are equally modeled with nonlinear functions. SSMs, like linear Gaussian or hidden Markov models, explicitly model uncertainty in the latent process through z1:T . Parameter inference in a SSM require z1:T to be averaged out, and hence p(zt|zt−1,ut) and p(xt|zt) are often restricted to the exponential family of distributions to make many existing approximate inference algorithms applicable. On the other hand, averaging a function over the deterministic path d1:T in a RNN is a trivial operation. The striking similarity in factorization between these models is illustrated in Figures 1a and 1b.\nCan we combine the best of both worlds, and make the stochastic state transitions of SSMs nonlinear whilst keeping the gated activation mechanism of RNNs? Below, we show that a more expressive model can be created by stacking a SSM on top of a RNN, and that by keeping them layered, the functional form of the true posterior distribution over z1:T guides the design of a backwards-recursive structured variational approximation."

      "text" : "We define a SRNN as a generative model pθ by temporally interlocking a SSM with a RNN, as illustrated in Figure 2a. The joint probability of a single sequence and its latent states, assuming knowledge of the starting states z0 = 0 and d0 = 0, and inputs u1:T , factorizes as\npθ(x1:T , z1:T ,d1:T |u1:T , z0,d0) = pθx(x1:T |z1:T ,d1:T ) pθz(z1:T |d1:T , z0) pθd(d1:T |u1:T ,d0)\n= T∏ t=1 pθx(xt|zt,dt) pθz(zt|zt−1,dt) pθd(dt|dt−1,ut) . (1)\nThe SSM and RNN are further tied with skip-connections from dt to xt. The joint density in (1) is parameterized by θ = {θx, θz, θd}, which will be adapted together with parameters φ of a so-called “inference network” qφ to best model N independently observed data sequences {xi1:Ti} N i=1 that are described by the log marginal likelihood or evidence\nL(θ) = log pθ ( {xi1:Ti} | {u i 1:Ti , z i 0,d i 0}Ni=1 ) = ∑ i log pθ(x i 1:Ti |u i 1:Ti , z i 0,d i 0) = ∑ i Li(θ) . (2)\nThroughout the paper, we omit superscript i when only one sequence is referred to, or when it is clear from the context. In each log likelihood term Li(θ) in (2), the latent states z1:T and d1:T were averaged out of (1). Integrating out d1:T is done by simply substituting its deterministically obtained value, but z1:T requires more care, and we return to it in Section 3.2. Following Figure 2a, the states d1:T are determined from d0 and u1:T through the recursion dt = fθd(dt−1,ut). In our implementation fθd is a GRU network with parameters θd. For later convenience we denote the value of d1:T , as computed by application of fθd , by d̃1:T . Therefore pθd(dt|dt−1,ut) = δ(dt − d̃t), i.e. d1:T follows a delta distribution centered at d̃1:T .\nUnlike the VRNN [8], zt directly depends on zt−1, as it does in a SSM, via pθz(zt|zt−1,dt). This split makes a clear separation between the deterministic and stochastic parts of pθ; the RNN remains entirely deterministic and its recurrent units do not depend on noisy samples of zt, while the prior over zt follows the Markov structure of SSMs. The split allows us to later mimic the structure of the posterior distribution over z1:T and d1:T in its approximation qφ. We let the prior transition distribution pθz(zt|zt−1,dt) = N (zt;µ (p) t ,v (p) t ) be a Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix, whose mean and log-variance are parameterized by neural networks that depend on zt−1 and dt,\nµ (p) t = NN (p) 1 (zt−1,dt) , logv (p) t = NN (p) 2 (zt−1,dt) , (3)\nwhere NN denotes a neural network. Parameters θz denote all weights of NN (p) 1 and NN (p) 2 , which are two-layer feed-forward networks in our implementation. Similarly, the parameters of the emission distribution pθx(xt|zt,dt) depend on zt and dt through a similar neural network that is parameterized by θx."

Instead of maximizing L with respect to θ, we maximize a variational evidence lower\nbound (ELBO) F(θ, φ) = ∑ i Fi(θ, φ) ≤ L(θ) with respect to both θ and the variational parameters φ [18]. The ELBO is a sum of lower bounds Fi(θ, φ) ≤ Li(θ), one for each sequence i,\nFi(θ, φ) = ∫∫\nqφ(z1:T ,d1:T |x1:T , A) log pθ(x1:T , z1:T ,d1:T |A) qφ(z1:T ,d1:T |x1:T , A) dz1:T dd1:T , (4)\nwhere A = {u1:T , z0,d0} is a notational shorthand. Each sequence’s approximation qφ shares parameters φ with all others, to form the auto-encoding variational Bayes inference network or variational auto encoder (VAE) [21, 26] shown in Figure 2b. Maximizing F(θ, φ) – which we call “training” the neural network architecture with parameters θ and φ – is done by stochastic gradient ascent, and in doing so, both the posterior and its approximation qφ change simultaneously. All the intractable expectations in (4) would typically be approximated by sampling, using the reparameterization trick [21, 26] or control variates [24] to obtain low-variance estimators of its gradients. We use the reparameterization trick in our implementation. Iteratively maximizing F over θ and φ separately would yield an expectation maximization-type algorithm, which has formed a backbone of statistical modeling for many decades [9]. The tightness of the bound depends on how well we can approximate the i = 1, . . . , N factors pθ(zi1:Ti ,d i 1:Ti |xi1:Ti , A\ni) that constitute the true posterior over all latent variables with their corresponding factors qφ(zi1:Ti ,d i 1:Ti |xi1:Ti , A\ni). In what follows, we show how qφ could be judiciously structured to match the posterior factors.\nWe add initial structure to qφ by noticing that the prior pθd(d1:T |u1:T ,d0) in the generative model is a delta function over d̃1:T , and so is the posterior pθ(d1:T |x1:T ,u1:T ,d0). Consequently, we let the inference network use exactly the same deterministic state setting d̃1:T as that of the generative model, and we decompose it as\nqφ(z1:T ,d1:T |x1:T ,u1:T , z0,d0) = qφ(z1:T |d1:T ,x1:T , z0) q(d1:T |x1:T ,u1:T ,d0)︸ ︷︷ ︸ = pθd (d1:T |u1:T ,d0) . (5)\nThis choice exactly approximates one delta-function by itself, and simplifies the ELBO by letting them cancel out. By further taking the outer average in (4), one obtains\nFi(θ, φ) = Eqφ [ log pθ(x1:T |z1:T , d̃1:T ) ] −KL ( qφ(z1:T |d̃1:T ,x1:T , z0) ∥∥ pθ(z1:T |d̃1:T , z0)) , (6)\nwhich still depends on θd, u1:T and d0 via d̃1:T . The first term is an expected log likelihood under qφ(z1:T |d̃1:T ,x1:T , z0), while KL denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions. Having stated the second factor in (5), we now turn our attention to parameterizing the first factor in (5) to resemble its posterior equivalent, by exploiting the temporal structure of pθ."

      "text" : "The true posterior distribution of the stochastic states z1:T , given both the data and the deterministic states d1:T , factorizes as pθ(z1:T |d1:T ,x1:T ,u1:T , z0) = ∏ t pθ(zt|zt−1,dt:T ,xt:T ). This can be verified by considering the conditional independence properties of the graphical model in Figure 2a using d-separation [14]. This shows that, knowing zt−1, the posterior distribution of zt does not depend on the past outputs and deterministic states, but only on the present and future ones; this was also noted in [22]. Instead of factorizing qφ as a mean-field approximation across time steps, we keep the structured form of the posterior factors, including zt’s dependence on zt−1, in the variational approximation\nqφ(z1:T |d1:T ,x1:T , z0) = ∏ t qφ(zt|zt−1,dt:T ,xt:T ) = ∏ t qφz(zt|zt−1,at = gφa(at+1, [dt,xt])) , (7) where [dt,xt] is the concatenation of the vectors dt and xt. The graphical model for the inference network is shown in Figure 2b. Apart from the direct dependence of the posterior approximation at time t on both dt:T and xt:T , the distribution also depends on d1:t−1 and x1:t−1 through zt−1. We mimic each posterior factor’s nonlinear long-term dependence on dt:T and xt:T through a backwardsrecurrent function gφa , shown in (7), which we will return to in greater detail in Section 3.3. The inference network in Figure 2b is therefore parameterized by φ = {φz, φa} and θd. In (7) all time steps are taken into account when constructing the variational approximation at time t; this can therefore be seen as a smoothing problem. In our experiments we also consider filtering,\nwhere only the information up to time t is used to define qφ(zt|zt−1,dt,xt). As the parameters φ are shared across time steps, we can easily handle sequences with variable length in both cases.\nAs both the generative model and inference network factorize over time steps in (1) and (7), the ELBO in (6) separates as a sum over the time steps\nFi(θ, φ) = ∑ t Eq∗φ(zt−1) [ Eqφ(zt|zt−1,d̃t:T ,xt:T ) [ log pθ(xt|zt, d̃t) ] +\n−KL ( qφ(zt|zt−1, d̃t:T ,xt:T ) ∥∥ pθ(zt|zt−1, d̃t))] , (8) where q∗φ(zt−1) denotes the marginal distribution of zt−1 in the variational approximation to the posterior qφ(z1:t−1|d̃1:T ,x1:T , z0), given by\nq∗φ(zt−1) = ∫ qφ(z1:t−1|d̃1:T ,x1:T , z0) dz1:t−2 = Eq∗φ(zt−2) [ qφ(zt−1|zt−2, d̃t−1:T ,xt−1:T ) ] .\n(9) We can interpret (9) as having a VAE at each time step t, with the VAE being conditioned on the past through the stochastic variable zt−1. To compute (8), the dependence on zt−1 needs to be integrated out, using our posterior knowledge at time t− 1 which is given by q∗φ(zt−1). We approximate the outer expectation in (8) using a Monte Carlo estimate, as samples from q∗φ(zt−1) can be efficiently obtained by ancestral sampling. The sequential formulation of the inference model in (7) allows such samples to be drawn and reused, as given a sample z(s)t−2 from q ∗ φ(zt−2), a sample z (s) t−1 from qφ(zt−1|z(s)t−2, d̃t−1:T ,xt−1:T ) will be distributed according to q∗φ(zt−1)."

Specifically, we initialize the hidden state of the backwards-recursive RNN in Figure 2b as aT+1 = 0, and recursively compute at = gφa(at+1, [d̃t,xt]). The function gφa represents a recurrent neural network with, for example, LSTM or GRU units. Each sequence’s variational approximation factorizes over time with qφ(z1:T |d1:T ,x1:T , z0) = ∏ t qφz(zt|zt−1,at), as shown in (7). We let qφz(zt|zt−1,at) be a Gaussian with diagonal covariance, whose mean and the log-variance are parameterized with φz as\nµ (q) t = NN (q) 1 (zt−1,at) , logv (q) t = NN (q) 2 (zt−1,at) . (10)\nInstead of smoothing, we can also do filtering by using a neural network to approximate the dependence of the true posterior pθ(zt|zt−1,dt,xt) on dt and xt, through for instance at = NN(a)(dt,xt).\nImproving the posterior approximation. In our experiments we found that during training, the parameterization introduced in (10) can lead to small values of the KL term KL(qφ(zt|zt−1,at) ‖ pθ(zt|zt−1, d̃t)) in the ELBO in (8). This happens when gφ in the inference network does not rely on the information propagated back from future outputs in at, but it is mostly using the hidden state d̃t to imitate the behavior of the prior. The inference network could therefore get stuck by trying to optimize the ELBO through sampling from the prior of the model, making the variational approximation to the posterior useless. To overcome this issue, we directly include some knowledge of the predictive prior dynamics in the parameterization of the inference network, using our approximation of the posterior distribution q∗φ(zt−1) over the previous latent states. In the spirit of sequential Monte Carlo methods [11], we improve the parameterization of qφ(zt|zt−1,at) by using q∗φ(zt−1) from (9). As we are constructing the variational distribution sequentially, we approximate the predictive prior mean, i.e. our “best guess” on the prior dynamics of zt, as\nµ̂ (p) t =\n∫ NN\n(p) 1 (zt−1,dt) p(zt−1|x1:T ) dzt−1 ≈\n∫ NN\n(p) 1 (zt−1,dt) q ∗ φ(zt−1) dzt−1 , (11)\nwhere we used the parameterization of the prior distribution in (3). We estimate the integral required to compute µ̂(p)t by reusing the samples that were needed for the Monte Carlo estimate of the ELBO\nin (8). This predictive prior mean can then be used in the parameterization of the mean of the variational approximation qφ(zt|zt−1,at),\nµ (q) t = µ̂ (p) t +NN (q) 1 (zt−1,at) , (12)\nAlgorithm 1 Inference of SRNN with Resq parameterization from (12).\n1: inputs: d̃1:T and a1:T 2: Initialize z0 3: for t = 1 to T do 4: µ̂(p)t = NN (p) 1 (zt−1, d̃t) 5: µ(q)t = µ̂ (p) t +NN (q) 1 (zt−1,at) 6: logv(q)t = NN (q) 2 (zt−1,at) 7: zt ∼ N (zt;µ(q)t ,v (q) t ) 8: end for\nand we refer to this parameterization as Resq in the results in Section 4. Rather than directly learning µ(q)t , we learn the residual between µ̂(p)t and µ (q) t . It is straightforward to show that with this parameterization the KL-term in (8) will not depend on µ̂(p)t , but only NN (q) 1 (zt−1,at). Learning the residual improves inference, making it seemingly easier for the inference network to track changes in the generative model while the model is trained, as it will only have to learn how to “correct” the predictive prior dynamics by using the information coming from d̃t:T and xt:T . We did not see any improvement in results by parameterizing logv(q)t in a similar way. The inference procedure of SRNN with Resq parameterization for one sequence is summarized in Algorithm 1."

      "text" : "In this section the SRNN is evaluated on the modeling of speech and polyphonic music data, as they have shown to be difficult to model without a good representation of the uncertainty in the latent states [3, 8, 12, 13, 16]. We test SRNN on the Blizzard [19] and TIMIT raw audio data sets (Table 1) used in [8]. The preprocessing of the data sets and the testing performance measures are identical to those reported in [8]. Blizzard is a dataset of 300 hours of English, spoken by a single female speaker. TIMIT is a dataset of 6300 English sentences read by 630 speakers. As done in [8], for Blizzard we report the average log-likelihood for half-second sequences and for TIMIT we report the average log likelihood per sequence for the test set sequences. Note that the sequences in the TIMIT test set are on average 3.1s long, and therefore 6 times longer than those in Blizzard. For the raw audio datasets we use a fully factorized Gaussian output distribution. Additionally, we test SRNN for modeling sequences of polyphonic music (Table 2), using the four data sets of MIDI songs introduced in [4]. Each data set contains more than 7 hours of polyphonic music of varying complexity: folk tunes (Nottingham data set), the four-part chorales by J. S. Bach (JSB chorales), orchestral music (MuseData) and classical piano music (Piano-midi.de). For polyphonic music we use a Bernoulli output distribution to model the binary sequences of piano notes.\nAll models where implemented using Theano [2], Lasagne [10] and Parmesan2. Training using a NVIDIA Titan X GPU took around 1.5 hours for TIMIT, 18 hours for Blizzard, less than 15 minutes for the JSB chorales and Piano-midi.de data sets, and around 30 minutes for the Nottingham and MuseData data sets. To reduce the computational requirements we use only 1 sample to approximate all the intractable expectations in the ELBO (notice that the KL term can be computed analytically). Further implementation and experimental details can be found in the Supplementary Material.\nBlizzard and TIMIT. Table 1 compares the average log-likelihood per test sequence of SRNN to the results from [8]. For RNNs and VRNNs the authors of [8] test two different output distributions, namely a Gaussian distribution (Gauss) and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). VRNN-I differs from the VRNN in that the prior over the latent variables is independent across time steps, and it is therefore similar to STORN [3]. For SRNN we compare the smoothing and filtering performance (denoted as smooth and filt in Table 1), both with the residual term in (12) and without it in (10) (denoted as Resq if present). We prefer to only report the more conservative evidence lower bound for SRNN, as the approximation of the log-likelihood using standard importance sampling is known to be difficult to compute accurately in the sequential setting [11]. We see from Table 1 that SRNN outperforms all the competing methods for speech modeling. As the test sequences in TIMIT are on average more than 6 times longer than the ones for Blizzard, the results obtained with SRNN for TIMIT are in line with those obtained for Blizzard.

As expected, for SRNN the variational approximation that is obtained when future information is also used (smoothing) is better than the one obtained by filtering. Learning the residual between the prior mean and the mean of the variational approximation, given in (12), further improves the performance in 3 out of 4 cases.\nIn the first two lines of Figure 3 we plot two raw signals from the Blizzard test set and the average KL term between the variational approximation and the prior distribution. We see that the KL term increases whenever there is a transition in the raw audio signal, meaning that the inference network is using the information coming from the output symbols to improve inference. Finally, the reconstructions of the output mean and log-variance in the last two lines of Figure 3 look consistent with the original signal.\nPolyphonic music. Table 2 compares the average log-likelihood on the test sets obtained with SRNN and the models introduced in [3, 4, 13, 16]. As done for the speech data, we prefer to report the more conservative estimate of the ELBO in Table 2, rather than approximating the log-likelihood with importance sampling as some of the other methods do. We see that SRNN performs comparably to other state of the art methods in all four data sets. We report the results using smoothing and learning the residual between the mean of the predictive prior and the one of the variational approximation, but the performances using filtering and learning directly the mean of the variational approximation are now similar. We believe that this is due to the small amount of data and the fact that modeling MIDI music is much simpler than modeling raw speech signals."

The performances of these models are highly dependent on how the dependence among stochastic units is modeled over time, on the type of interaction between stochastic units and deterministic ones, and on the procedure that is used to evaluate the typically intractable log likelihood. Figure 4 highlights how SRNN differs from some of these works.\nIn STORN [3] (Figure 4a) and DRAW [15] the stochastic units at each time step have an isotropic Gaussian prior and are independent between time steps.

In the VRNN, on the other hand, the stochastic units are conditionally independent given the states d1:T . Because the inference and generative networks in the VRNN share the deterministic units, the variational approximation would not improve by making it dependent on the future through at, when calculated with a backward GRU, as we do in our model. Unlike STORN, DRAW and VRNN, the SRNN separates the “noisy” stochastic units from the deterministic ones, forming an entire layer of interconnected stochastic units. We found in practice that this gave better performance and was easier to train. The works by [1, 22] (Figure 4c) show that it is possible to improve inference in SSMs by using ideas from VAEs, similar to what is done in the stochastic part (the top layer) of SRNN. Towards the periphery of related works, [16] approximates the log likelihood of a SSM with sequential Monte Carlo, by learning flexible proposal distributions parameterized by deep networks, while [13] uses a recurrent model with discrete stochastic units that is optimized using the NVIL algorithm [23]."

For the first 0.5 second we initialize hidden units with zeros and for the subsequent 3 chunks we use the previous hidden states as initialization.\nFor Blizzard we split the data using 90% for training, 5% for validation and 5% for testing. For testing we report the average log-likelihood per 0.5s sequences. For TIMIT we use the predefined test set for testing and split the rest of the data into 95% for training and 5% for validation. The training and testing setup are identical to the ones for Blizzard. For TIMIT the test sequences have variable length and are on average 3.1s, i.e. more than 6 times longer than Blizzard.\nWe model the output using a fully factorized Gaussian distribution for pθx(xt|zt,dt). The deterministic RNNs use GRUs [7], with 2048 units for Blizzard and 1024 units for TIMIT. In both cases, zt is a 256-dimensional vector. All the neural networks have 2 layers, with 1024 units for Blizzard and 512 for TIMIT, and use leaky rectified nonlinearities with leakiness 13 and clipped at ±3. In both generative and inference models we share a neural network to extract features from the raw audio signal. The sizes of the models were chosen to roughly match the number of parameters used in [8]. In all experiments it was fundamental to gradually introduce the KL term in the ELBO, as shown in [5, 28, 25]. We therefore multiply a temperature β to the KL term, i.e. βKL, and linearly increase β from 0.2 to 1 in the beginning of training (for Blizzard we increase it by 0.0001 after each update, while for TIMIT by 0.0003). In both data sets we used the ADAM optimizer [20]. For Blizzard we use a learning rate of 0.0003 and batch size of 128, for TIMIT they are 0.001 and 64 respectively.\nA.2 Polyphonic music\nWe use the same model architecture as in Section 4, except for the output Bernoulli variables used to model the active notes. We reduced the number of parameters in the model to 300 deterministic hidden units for the GRU networks, and 100 stochastic units whose distributions are parameterized with neural networks with 1 layer of 500 units.\n32s·16Khz / 200 = 160"

This paper introduces stochastic recurrent neural networks which glue a deterministic recurrent neural network and a state space model together to form a stochastic and sequential neural generative model. The clear separation of deterministic and stochastic layers allows a structured variational inference network to track the factorization of the model’s posterior distribution. By retaining both the nonlinear recursive structure of a recurrent neural network and averaging over the uncertainty in a latent path, like a state space model, we improve the state of the art results on the Blizzard and TIMIT speech modeling data sets by a large margin, while achieving comparable performances to competing methods on polyphonic music modeling.",
