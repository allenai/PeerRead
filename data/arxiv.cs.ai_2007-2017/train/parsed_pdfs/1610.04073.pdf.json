      "text" : "Large scale knowledge bases such as WordNet [1] and FreeBase [2] are important resources for natural language processing (NLP) applications like web searching [3], automatic question answering systems [4], and even medical informatics [5]. Formally, a knowledge base is a dataset containing triples of two entities and their relation. A triplet (h, r, t), for example, indicates that the head entity h and the tail entity t have a relation r. Despite massive triplets a knowledge base contains, evidence in the literature suggests that existing knowledge bases are far from complete [6,7].\nIn the past decades, researchers have proposed various methods to automatically construct or populate knowledge bases from plain texts [6,8], semistructured data on the Web [9,10], etc. Recently, studies show that embedding the entities and relations of a knowledge base into a continuous vector space is an effective way to integrate the global information in the existing knowledge base and to predict missing triplets without using external resources (i.e., additional text or tables) [11,7,12,13,14].\nBordes et al. [11] propose the TransE approach, which translates entities’ embeddings by that of a relation, to model knowledge bases. That is to say, the relation between two entities can be represented as a vector offset, similar to word analogy tasks for word embeddings [15] and sentence relation classification\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n04 07\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n6 O\nct 2\n01 6\nby sentence embeddings [16]. For one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations, however, such straightforward vector offset does not make much sense. Considering a head entity China and the country-city relation, we can think of multiple plausible tail entities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. These entities cannot be captured in the same time by translating the head entity and relation embeddings. Therefore, researchers propose to map entities to a new space where embedding translation is computed, resulting in TransH [7], TransR [12], and other variants. Among the above approaches, TransR achieves the highest performance on established benchmarks.\nOne shortcoming of the above methods is that only the direct relation (i.e., one-hop relation) between two entities is considered. In a knowledge base, some entities and relations only appear a few times; they suffer from the problem of data sparsity during training. Fortunately, the problem can be alleviated by using multi-hop information in a knowledge base. Guu et al. [13] present a random walk approach to sample entities with composited relations. Likewise, Lin et al. [14] propose a path-augmenting approach that uses multi-hop relations between two entities to regularize the direct relation between the same entity pair. Their experiments show the path-augmented TransE model (denoted as PTransE) outperforms the one-hop TransE model.\nIn this paper, we are curious whether we can combine the worlds, i.e., whether the path-augmenting technique is also useful to a better one-hop “base” model. Therefore, we propose to leverage TransR [12] as our cornerstone, but enhance it with path information as in [14], resulting a new variant, PTransR. We evaluate our model on the FreeBase dataset. Experimental results show that modeling relation paths is beneficial to the base model TransR, and that PTransR also outperforms PTransE in entity prediction. In this way, we achieve the state-ofthe-art link prediction performance in the category that uses only the knowledge base itself (i.e., without additional textual information).\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the base model TransR and then discuss the path-augmented variant PTransR. In Section 3, we compare our PTransR model with other baselines in an entity prediction experiment; we also have in-depth analysis regarding different groups of relations, namely 1-to-1, 1-to-n, n-to-1, and n-to-n relations. In Section 4, we briefly review previous work in information extraction. Finally, we conclude our paper in Section 5."

      "text" : "As said in Section 1, embedding entities and their relation into vector spaces can effectively exploit internal structures that a knowledge base contains, and thus is helpful in predicting missing triplets without using additional texts.\nThe first model in such research direction is TransE [11]. It embeds entities and their relation in a same low-dimensional vector space; the two entities’ embeddings are translated by a relation embedding, which can be viewed as an offset vector. In other words, for a triplet (h, r, t), we would like h+r ≈ t. (Here, bold letters refer to the embeddings of head/tail entities and the relation.) The plausibility of a triplet (h, r, t) is then evaluated by a scoring function\nfr(h, t) , ‖h + r− t‖ , (1)\nwhere ‖ · ‖ denotes either `1-norm or `2-norm. fr(h, t) is expected to be small if (h, r, t) is a positve triplet.\nTo further analyze the performance of TransE, Bordes et al. [11] divide relations into four groups, namely 1-to-1, 1-to-n, n-to-1, and n-to-n, according to the mapping properties of a relataion. For example, country-city is a 1-to-n relation, because a country may have multiple cities, but a city belongs to only one country. The weakness of TransE is that entity embeddings on the many side tend to be close to each other, which is the result of expecting fr(h, t) to be small for all positive triplets. Therefore, it is hard for TransE to distinguish among the entities which are on the many side.\nTo solve the above problem, TransR [12] embeds entities and relations into two separate spaces: the entity space and the relation space. It uses relationspecific matrices Mr to map an entity from its own space to the relation space, given by hr = Mrh and tr = Mrt, so that translation can be accomplished by regarding relation embedding as an offset vector, i.e., hr + r ≈ tr. To achieve this goal, TransR defines the scoring function as\nfr(h, t) , ‖Mrh + r−Mrt‖22 . (2)\nTo train the model, we shall generate negative samples and use the hinge loss. The overall cost function of the TransR model is\nLTransR = ∑\n(h,r,t)∈S ∑ (h′,r,t′)∈S′ max { 0, γ + fr(h, t)− fr(h′, t′) } , (3)\nwhere negative samples are constructed as S′ = {(h′, r, t)|(h′, r, t) /∈ S} ⋃ {(h, r, t′)|(h, r, t′) /∈ S} .\nResults in link prediction show that TransR outperforms other models on established benchmarks, indicating TransR is the best one-hop model at present. However, TransR fails to utilize the rich path information, which will be dealt with in the following subsection."

      "heading" : "2.2 Path-Augmented TransR: PTransR",
      "text" : "Using path information to regularize one-hop models can be beneficial [14,13]. Here, we adopt the path modeling method in PTransE, and extend the TransR model to path-augmented TransR (denoted as PTransR).\nA relation path is a set of relations that connect head entity and tail entity in succession. An n-hop relation path from h to t is defined as p = {r1, r2, · · · , rn}, satisfying h r1−→ e1 r2−→ · · · rn−→ t. If n = 1, then p = r1 is a direct (1-hop) relation. To enhance TransR model with multi-hop information, we follow the treatment in PTransE [14] and represent a relation path as an embedding vector by additive compositional methods. Then such multi-hop information is used to regularize one-hop direct relation between the same entity pair. A reliability score is computed to address the strength of regularization by a particular path. Details are described as follows.\nTo compute the representation of a relation path p that composites primitive relations r1, r2, · · · , rn, i.e., p = r1 ◦r2 ◦· · ·◦rn (where ◦ denotes the composition operation), we add the embeddings of these primitive relations, given by\np = r1 + r2 + · · ·+ rn, (4)\nwhere bold letters denote the vector of a relation or a path. The choice of addition as the composition operation is reasonable, because the vector representation of path p should be close to that of direct relation r if it is likely to infer r from p. For example, the representation of path father−−−−→ mother−−−−−→ is expected to be close to that of direct relation grandmother−−−−−−−−→.\nAlthough a knowledge base may contain a variety of relation paths between two entities, not every path is equally useful for inferring direct relations. For example, the relation path John friend−−−−→ Tim gender−−−−→ male gives little contribution to inferring the gender of John. To evaluate the reliability of a path, PTransE uses a path-constraint resource algorithm (PCRA) [14], which is also applied in our approach. This algorithm first assigns a certain amount of resource (i.e., a value of 1) to the head entity h; then each node distributes resource evenly to its direct child nodes (Figure 2). The value of p along an entity pair h, t is denoted as v(p|h, t).\nHowever, v(p|h, t) alone does not embody the relatedness between a relation path p and a direct relation r. To address this problem, a relatedness measure is defined as Pr(r|p) = Pr(r, p)/Pr(p), where Pr(p) is the sum of v(p|h, t) for every training triplet (h, r, t) with p as a relation path from h to t. Pr(r, p) is the sum of v(p|h, t) for every training triplet (h, r, t) with r being a direct relation and p as a relation path. The overall reliability of a path p on a triplet (h, r, t) is given by\nR(p|h, r, t) = Pr(r|p) · v(p|h, t). (5)\nPTransR’s scoring function fPTransR(h, r, t) is composed of two scores:\nfPTransR(h, r, t) = E(h, r, t) + E(P|h, r, t). (6)\nE(h, r, t) is the same as the scoring function of TransR (Equation 2) which evaluates the plausibility of (h, r, t) without considering relation paths from h to t. Following PTransE, E(P|h, r, t) is defined as\nE(P|h, r, t) = 1 Z ∑ p∈P E(p|h, r, t), (7)\nE(p|h, r, t) = R(p|h, r, t) ‖p− r‖22 = Pr(r|p)v(p|h, t) ‖p− r‖ 2 2 , (8)\nwhere Z is a normalizing factor for R(p|h, t) and P is the set of all paths from h to t. E(P|h, r, t) evaluates the plausibility of (h, r, t) with the consideration of relation paths from h to t. The overall loss function of PTransR is\nLPTransR = ∑\n(h,r,t)∈S\n[L(h, r, t) + 1\nZ ∑ p∈P L(p|h, r, t)], (9)\nL(h, r, t) = ∑\n(h′,r,t′)/∈S\nmax { 0, γ1 + E(h, r, t)− E(h′, r, t′) } , (10)\nL(p|h, r, t) = ∑\n(h,r′,t)/∈S\nmax { 0, γ2 + E(p|h, r, t)− E(p|h, r′, t) } , (11)\nPTransR learns entity and relation embeddings by minimizing LPTransR."

The configuration of TransE is: margin γ = 1, learning rate α = 0.01, method = unif, and epoch = 1000. Negative samples. We sample negative triplets by randomly replacing head entity h or tail entity t or relation r. For example, (h, r, t)-derived negative triplets are (h′, r, t), (h, r, t′), and (h, r′, t), where (h, r, t) ∈ S and (h′, r, t), (h, r′, t), (h, r, t′)/∈ S. Vector representation constraints. Following TransR, to regularize the representations, we impose the following constraints on the entity and relation embeddings.\n‖ h ‖=‖ t ‖=‖ r ‖= 1, ‖Mrh ‖≤ 1, ‖Mrt ‖≤ 1. (12)\nPath selection. PTranE restricts the length of path to less than 3. Its results show that 3-hop paths do not make significant improvement, compared to 2-hop paths. For efficiency, we only consider 2-hop relation paths. Inverse relation.

      "text" : "We evaluate PtransR on the task of entity prediction. Entity prediction aims at predicting the missing entity in an incomplete triplet, i.e., predicting h given\nr and t, or predicting t given h and r. Following the settings in TransE, for a triplet (h, r, t), we replace the head entity h with every entity e and compute the score of (e, r, t). Entity candidates are ranked according to their scores. We repeat the same process to predict the tail entity t. Then we use the two metrices in TransE to evaluate the performance: MeanRank (average rank of the expected entity) and Hits@10 (proportion of triplets whose head/tail entity is among top10 in the ranking). However, there could be several entities that are plausible for the same incomplete triplet. The plausible entities which are ranked before h or t may cause underestimation of performance. One solution is to remove other plausible entities in the ranking, which is referred to as a filter. In comparison, the results without removing other plausible entities are referred to as raw. A good model should achieve low MeanRank and high Hits@10.\nTo utilize the inverse relation, instead of only using the score fPTransR(h, r, t), we use the sum of fPTransR(h, r, t) and fPTransR(t, r\n−1, h) to rank the candidates, i.e.,\nscore(h, r, t) = fPTransR(h, r, t) + fPTransR(t, r −1, h). (13)\nTo accelerate the testing process, we use the reranking method in PTransE. We first rank all candidates according to their scores which are computed by the scoring function of TransR, which means that path information is not considered in the first ranking. Then we rerank the top-500 candidates according to the scores computed by the scoring function mentioned above, namely score(h, r, t).\nThe configurations for experiments are given as follows: learning rate α for SGD among {0.01,0.001,0.0001}, dimension of enitity space Rk and relation space Rd between {20,50}, γ1 and γ2 among {1,2,4}, batch size B among {480,960,4800}.
