      "text" : "1 | P a g e\nSearch engines are the most important tools for web data acquisition. Web pages are crawled and indexed by search Engines. Users typically locate useful web pages by querying a search engine. One of the challenges in search engines administration is spam pages which waste search engine resources. These pages by deception of search engine ranking algorithms try to be showed in the first page of results. There are many approaches to web spam pages detection such as measurement of HTML code style similarity, pages linguistic pattern analysis and machine learning algorithm on page content features. One of the famous algorithms has been used in machine learning approach is Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Recently basic structure of SVM has been changed by new extensions to increase robustness and classification accuracy. In this paper we improved accuracy of web spam detection by using two nonlinear kernels into Twin SVM (TSVM) as an improved extension of SVM. The classifier ability to data separation has been increased by using two separated kernels for each class of data. Effectiveness of new proposed method has been experimented with two publicly used spam datasets called UK-2007 and UK-2006. Results show the effectiveness of proposed kernelized version of TSVM in web spam page detection.\nIndexing terms/Keywords\nSearch Engine, Web Spam Page Detection, Machine Learning, Twin Support Vector Machine (TSVM), Multiple Kernels.\n1.Introduction\nThe ever-increasing volume of information on the Internet has made search engines vital tools for information extraction. From a theoretical point of view, search engines are information retrieval tools responsible for downloading, indexing, processing, retrieving, and ranking of information [1].\nMalicious content on the Internet, poses a unique challenge for search engines; one that other information retrieval systems do not normally face. Malicious content refers to deceitful information created for the purpose of manipulating a search engine’s results. The open nature of the Internet allows any individual to create and distribute arbitrary content. Thus, malicious content cannot be avoided. Web pages which attempt to manipulate a search engine’s results are the most important type of malicious content. Such pages are called Spam Pages. Other types of malicious content include spam queries, spam posts and Fishing pages.\nMost website owners want to have higher-ranking pages. This is because only 15% of users visit the second page of search engine results before changing their query. Thus, search engines are constantly trying to assign better ranks to the most relevant results. This improvement increases their revenue and popularity. Such attempts can be exploited, and led to the creation of spam pages by profiteers [2].\nIt should be noted that not all spam pages have commercial or exploitive purposes. The contents of these pages differ from the user’s expectations. They aim to penetrate ranking algorithms and, therefore, can be classified as spam pages. The main purpose of spam pages is to fraud ranking algorithms, with the aim of achieving a higher rank among the top ten search engine’s results of various queries, as fast as possible [3]. Fig.1 illustrates a sample spam page. Since the text in each page include multiple valuable keywords, the content of the page is insignificant for the user. From the perspective of search engine, the most important effect of spam pages is diminution of search engine user’s trust. Furthermore, the large number of spam pages, forces search engines to allocate more resources (bandwidth, storage space, software) to crawling, indexing, storing, and processing contents of these pages.\n2 | P a g e\nSpam pages mainly aim to corrupt ranking algorithms in search engines. Ranking is done by search engine which estimates the quality of a page with respect to a particular query. In other words, one scores is assigned to each retrieved document. Documents are sorted in decreasing (or increasing) order of their scores. Search engines often use the following measures to rank web pages:\na) Relevance, measured as the degree of similarity between the input query and the text of the web page.\nb) Importance, input query is ignored in it. This measure can be calculated as the number of times other pages are linked to a certain page.\nAs mentioned earlier, spam pages are created with the aim of obtaining a high rank in a search engine’s results. As a result, they are created with the ranking algorithms in mind [1]. The content of a spam page is organized to match more queries. Therefore, a variety of useful keywords are used so that more user queries can be matched. Also, web spam content are changed based on the structure of web pages. Therefore, content ranking algorithms assign higher scores to these pages. If the goal is to match the target page to a certain request, then the target keywords need to be repeated multiple times. In 2006, Najork et al. [4] presented an approach based on content analysis, using examination of various features of spam and non-spam pages. Their findings formed a basis for identifying spam pages.\nCreating a high number of links is another method used by spammers to improve their rank. In [6-8] a different approach, based on the links between pages in the web graph, is used for detection. The graph and patterns that emerge from it are used to differentiate spam and non-spam pages.\nThere have also been attempts to combine ideas form both methods to achieve satisfactory results. In [5], spam pages are detected using a combination of content-based and link-based methods. In recent years, user behavior has also been a decisive factor in detecting spam pages. Liu et al. [9] presented a behavior-based method. Modern techniques for creating spam pages include information hiding, where users are encountered with different versions of pages compared to search engine crawlers.\nVarious methods of spam detection have been proposed, including those based on coding-style similarity [18] and language pattern analysis [11]. Machine learning algorithms have also been applied to page features [12- 16]. The majority of methods involved in creating spam pages rely on content-based techniques. Thus, analyzing the content features of these pages will improve much more efficiency compared to other methods. Web pages have certain features that can be extracted using content analysis. The values for these features are significantly different across spam and non-spam pages. Since the detection problem seeks to label pages as either spam or normal, it can be converted to a classification problem with two classes. Therefore, once\n3 | P a g e\nfeatures of page content are extracted and a suitable set of pages are labeled (normal or spam), a proper classifier can be used to determine the being spam of unlabeled pages collected by a search engine.\nMachine learning methods use classification algorithms to extract and detect patterns among normal and spam pages. Using more powerful algorithms can increase the accuracy of detection. In previous researches, Hidden Markov Model [12], Decision tree [13], Bayesian networks [14], and artificial neural network [15] are used to separate spam instances from non-spam ones.\nMany machine learning algorithms have been used for the binary classification problem. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of these algorithms, which offers favorable results. SVM despite is successfully applied to many problems of differentiating positive and negative instances, suitable accuracy has not been reported for web spam detection by it. However, studies on other applications demonstrate that new extensions of SVM have significantly superior performance [19]. Such versions aim to improve its performance on different data through changes in SVM structure.\nSVM is binary classifier, which constructs a hyper-plane among instances such that the distance from the instances is maximized and, thus, a good separation is achieved. In an extended version of it, namely the Twin SVM (TWSVM), two separate hyper-planes are used for each class instances. Based on the nature of web pages and number of extracted features in them, this version of SVM can be used for web spam classification.\nIn some cases, samples cannot be separated linearly by their attributes. The concept of kernel has been introduced in machine learning methods to solve this problem. In this approach, the data are first logically mapped to a higher-dimensional space. The new dimensions are created such that they can be linearly separated with more accuracy, using hyper-planes [21].\nIn this paper, TSVM with two non-linear kernels is used for spam page detection. The main innovation of the proposed method is embedding two different suitable kernels for each hyperplane in TSVM. Experimental results on UK-2006 and UK-2007 datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting spam pages.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of various extensions to the SVM. The importance of using non-linear kernels is considered in section 3. The details of the proposed method are discussed in section 4. Section 5 presents the experimental results. Finally, in section 6, the concluding remarks and suggestions for future works are offered."

      "text" : "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a non-statistical binary classifier, which has attracted a lot of attentions in recent years. In this method, all the instances are used in conjunction with an optimization algorithm to find instances that form the boundaries of classes. Using these instances, an optimal linear decision boundary is created to separate classes, and it is solved using the Quadratic Programming Problem (QPP) [23]. This classifier does not rely on statistics; the training points are directly used to determine the decision boundary between two classes.\nProximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) is a new version of the SVM, which aims to reduce computational costs. In this algorithm, two parallel hyper-planes, rather than one, are used to separate instances.\nGeneralized Eigenvalue Proximal SVM (GEPSVM), uses two non-parallel hyper-planes, each of which is placed near one of the two classes. Since a large QPP must be solved, the algorithm becomes very costly.\n4 | P a g e\nThe improved GEPSVM, called Twin SVM (TWSVM), eliminates this problem by solving two smaller instances of QPP. Therefore, computational cost is decreased, while the algorithm becomes more robust.\nThen, a variation of TWSVM, namely the Least Square TWSVM was introduced. The final solution of the algorithm is obtained by solving two linear equations, rather than two QPPs. Although the algorithm is easier, however it is less robust, due to its sensitivity to noise.\nKnowledge-based TWSVM is another version of TWSVM, which uses current instances along with previous knowledge to separate instances into two classes. Compared to other knowledge-based algorithms, it offers less complexity time.\nIn order to improve the structure of TWSVM, Smooth TWSVM was introduced. The most important change in this version of the algorithm is the elimination of QPP limitations."

      "text" : "Using linear models for classification is much easier and faster than non-linear counterparts. Linear models work on data that can be separable linearly. Often, developing of linear models is more appropriate than non-linear ones, since they are associated with lower complexity time. However, in some cases, the instances are not intrinsically linear. Such instances must be mapped to a more dimensional space, where a linear model is applicable. Fig.2 illustrates how the data are mapped to a new space. Mapping to a highdimensional space is not always straightforward manner and can impose much more costs than primary dimension space. By offering a way to reduce associated costs, the idea of kernel addresses this shortcoming. A kernel implicitly maps the data to a higher-dimensional space. In order to classify non-linear data in a linear manner, the SVM needs to use the idea of a kernel, which leads to enhanced classification capabilities [21].\nGenerally, in algorithms where data are in the form of dot products, the idea of a kernel can be applied. There are various types of kernel functions. Polynomial, Gaussian, linear, and fuzzy are more common kernel functions [21]. Using kernel functions together with SVMs is lead to performance improvement of binary classification."

      "text" : "As previously mentioned, in this paper for the first time two separate kernels are adjusted in TWSVM. The rationale behind this is the nature of spam pages as well as the distribution of instance. This paper tries to improve classification performance by designing two suitable kernels, both of which are used to map the input data to a new space. In the following, details of designing and matching two appropriate kernels for the TWSVM are discussed.\nIn subsection 4-2, kernel design in the TSVM is explained. Based on dimension space of samples, an efficient\nkernel must be designed to separate the samples both linearly and optimally, in the new space. The choice or design of the kernel function has a direct impact on the efficiency of the classifier algorithm. Kernel functions can be created as combinations of standard kernels. The resulting kernel must satisfy Mercer’s condition (Mercer’s theorem checks the validity of kernel functions). In this paper, a suitable kernel function for spam web pages is obtained using the method of fixed rule and a combination of two standard kernels. The first kernel is linear, which is powerful and has low computational costs. The linear kernel is shown in Eq(4).\nK( Xi , Xj ) = Xi . Xj +b\n(4)\nwhere nji XX , and b\nLinear kernel is most effective when the data are normally distributed. Since non-spam pages have a normal distribution, this kernel function is used to map these input instances to a new space.\nThe other kernel function is the hyperbolic tangent, which is used for non-linear patterns in the data. The function can be seen in Eq(5).\nK( Xi , Xj ) = tanh (k Xi . Xj - b)\n(5)\nwhere nji XX , and bk,\nSince each kernel function creates a similarity matrix, it must be designed such that the matrix for each instance of the two classes matches the real patterns in the data. Therefore, the choice of the function is very important. In this paper, the linear method is used, which offers simplicity while maintaining the advantages of both kernel functions. Eq(6) presents the linear combination of the two functions.\nK = tanh(k ×Xtrain × Xt' -b)2 + ( Xtrain × Xt' ) (6)\nwhere Xtrain is the set of positive instances (spam) and Xt represents the entire set of data. After several experiments, the coefficients k and b were assigned 1 and 0, respectively. A function must satisfy Mercer’s conditions before it can be considered a kernel function. The conditions are true for the proposed function.\n7 | P a g e\nAfter the appropriate kernel is chosen, it must be adapted to the TSVM. As shown earlier, in the TWSVM classifier the class of a new instance is determined using Eq(7).\ni\nT i\nii\ni wCxKw\nbwCxK Class\n),(\n|),(| minarg\n2,1 \n\n\n  (7)\nIn the proposed method, Eq(6) is applied to spam pages, whereas Eq(4) is used for normal instances. As mentioned before, the TWSVM classifier uses two separate hyper-planes for each instance, which allows the mapping of the input data to a new space. As a result, the hyper-planes become more effective in segregating of instances.\nAfter the designed kernel is adjusted to the TWSVM, the classifier must be trained. A portion of instancesin each dataset is used for training purposes. The trained classifier can then determine which class each new instance belongs."

    "abstractText" : "Search engines are the most important tools for web data acquisition. Web pages are crawled and indexed by search Engines. Users typically locate useful web pages by querying a search engine. One of the challenges in search engines administration is spam pages which waste search engine resources. These pages by deception of search engine ranking algorithms try to be showed in the first page of results. There are many approaches to web spam pages detection such as measurement of HTML code style similarity, pages linguistic pattern analysis and machine learning algorithm on page content features. One of the famous algorithms has been used in machine learning approach is Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Recently basic structure of SVM has been changed by new extensions to increase robustness and classification accuracy. In this paper we improved accuracy of web spam detection by using two nonlinear kernels into Twin SVM (TSVM) as an improved extension of SVM. The classifier ability to data separation has been increased by using two separated kernels for each class of data. Effectiveness of new proposed method has been experimented with two publicly used spam datasets called UK-2007 and UK-2006. Results show the effectiveness of proposed kernelized version of TSVM in web spam page detection.",
