      "text" : "O NE of the primary goals in computer vision is holisticscene understanding, which involves many sub-tasks, such as depth estimation, scene categorization, saliency detection, object detection, event categorization, etc. (See Figure 1.) Each of these tasks explains some aspect of a particular scene and in order to fully understand a scene, we would need to solve for each of these sub-tasks. Several independent efforts have resulted in good classifiers for each of these sub-tasks. In practice, we see that the subtasks are coupled—for example, if we know that the scene is an indoor scene, it would help us estimate depth from that single image more accurately. In another example in the robotic grasping domain, if we know what kind of object we are trying to grasp, then it is easier for a robot to figure out how to pick it up. In this paper, we propose a unified model that jointly optimizes for all the sub-tasks, allowing them to share information and guide the classifiers towards a joint optimal. We show that this can be seamlessly applied across different applications.\nRecently, several approaches have tried to combine these different classifiers for related tasks in vision [1–10]; however, most of them tend to be ad-hoc (i.e., a hardcoded rule is used) and often an intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the individual classifiers is required.\n• Congcong Li, Adarsh Kowdle and Tsuhan Chen are with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, 14853.

E-mail: asaxena@cs.cornell.edu\nEven beyond vision, in many other domains, state-of-the-art classifiers already exist for many sub-tasks. However, these carefully engineered models are often tricky to modify, or even to simply re-implement from the available descriptions. Heitz et. al. [11] recently developed a framework for scene understanding called Cascaded Classification Models (CCM) treating each classifier as a ‘black-box’. Each classifier is repeatedly instantiated with the next layer using the outputs of the previous classifiers as inputs. While this work proposed a method of combining the classifiers in a way that increased the performance in all of the four tasks they considered, it had a drawback that it optimized for each task independently and there was no way of feeding back information from later classifiers to earlier classifiers during training. This feedback can potentially help the CCM achieve a more optimal solution.\nIn our work, we propose Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models (FE-CCM), which provides feedback from the later classifiers to the earlier ones, during the training phase. This feedback, provides earlier stages information about what error modes should be focused on, or what can be ignored without hurting the performance of the later classifiers. For example, misclassifying a street scene as highway may not hurt as much as misclassifying a street scene as open country. Therefore we prefer the first layer classifier to focus on fixing the latter error instead of optimizing the training accuracy. In another example, allowing the depth estimation to focus on some specific regions can help perform better scene categorization. For instance, the open country scene is characterized by its upper part as a wide sky area.

Given a test image, Holistic Scene Understanding corresponds to inferring the labels for all possible scene understanding dimensions. In our work, we infer labels corresponding to, scene categorization, event categorization, depth estimation (Black = close, white = far), object detection, geometric layout (green = vertical, red = horizontal, blue = vertical) and saliency detection (cyan = salient) as shown above and achieve this jointly using one unified model. Note that different tasks help each other, for example, the depth estimate of the scene can help the object detector look for the horse; the object detection can help perform better saliency detection, etc.\ndepth well in that region by sacrificing some regions in the bottom may help to correctly classify an image. In detail, we do so by jointly optimizing all the tasks; the outputs of the first layers are treated as latent variables and training is done using an iterative algorithm. Another benefit of our method is that each of the classifiers can be trained using their own independent training datasets, i.e., our model does not require a datapoint to have labels for all the sub-tasks, and hence it scales well with heterogeneous datasets.\nIn our approach, we treat each classifier as a ‘black-box’, with no restrictions on its operation other than requiring the ability to train on data and have an input/output interface. (Often each of these individual classifier could be quite complex, e.g., producing labelings over pixels in an entire image.) Therefore, our method is applicable to many other tasks that have different but correlated outputs.\nIn extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves significant improvements in the performance of all the six sub-tasks we consider: depth estimation, object detection, scene categorization, event categorization, geometric labeling and saliency detection. We also successfully apply the same model to two robotics applications: robotic grasping, and robotic object detection.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first define holistic scene understanding and discuss the related works in Section 2. We describe our FE-CCM method in Section 3 followed by the discussion about handling heterogeneous datasets in Section 4. We provide the implementation details of the classifiers in Section 5. We present the experiments and results in Section 6 and some robotic applications in Section 7. We finally conclude in Section 8."

      "text" : "When we look at an image of a scene, such as in Figure 1, we are often interested in answering several different questions: What objects are there in the image? How far are things? What is going on in the scene? What type of scene it is? And so on. These are only a few examples of questions in the area of scene understanding; and there may even be more.\nIn the past, the focus has been to address each task in isolation, where the goal of each task is to produce a label Yi ∈ Si for the ith sub-task. If we are considering depth estimation (see Figure 1), then the label would be Y1 ∈ S1 = R100×100+ for continuous values of depth in a 100× 100 output. For scene categorization, we will have Y2 ∈ S2 = {1, . . . ,K} for K scene classes. If we have n subtasks, then we would have to produce an output as:\nY = {Y1, . . . , Yn} ∈ S1 × S2 . . .× Sn. The interesting part here is that often we want to solve different combinations of the sub-tasks depending on the situation. The goal of this work is to design an algorithm that does not depend on the particular sub-tasks in question."

      "text" : "Cascaded classifiers. Using information from related tasks to improve the performance of the task in question has been studied in various fields of machine learning. The idea of cascading layers of classifiers to aid a task was first introduced with neural networks as multi-level perceptrons where, the output of the first layer of perceptrons is passed on as input to the next layer [12–14]. However, it is often hard to train neural networks and gain an insight into its operation, making it hard to work for complicated tasks.\nThe idea of improving classification performance by combining outputs of many classifiers is used in methods such as Boosting [15], where many weak learners are combined to obtain a more accurate classifier; this has been applied to tasks such as face detection [16, 17]. To incorporate contextual information, Fink and Perona [18] exploited local dependencies between objects in a boosting framework, but did not allow for multiple rounds of communication between objects. Torralba et al. [19] introduced Boosted Random Fields to model object dependency, which used boosting to learn the graph structure and local evidence of a conditional random field. Tu [20] proposed a more general framework which used pixel-level label maps to learn a contextual model through a cascaded classifier approach. All these works mainly consider the interactions between labels of the same type. However, in our CCM framework [21, 22], the focus is on capturing contextual interactions between labels of different types. Furthermore, compared to the feed-forward only cascade method in [20], our model with feedback not only iteratively refines the contextual interactions, but also refines the individual classifiers to provide helpful context. Sensor fusion. There has been a huge body of work in the area of sensor fusion where classifiers output the same labels but work with different modalities, each one giving additional information and thus improving the performance, e.g., in biometrics, data from voice recognition and face recognition is combined [23]. However, in our scenario, we consider multiple tasks where each classifier is tackling a different problem (i.e., predicting different labels), with the same input being provided to all the classifiers. Structured Models for combining tasks. While the methods discussed above combine classifiers to predict the same labels, there is a group of works that designs models\n3 for predicting heterogenous labels. Kumar and Hebert [1] developed a large MRF-based probabilistic model to link multi-class segmentation and object detection. Li et al. [24] modeled mulitple interactions within tasks and across tasks by defining a MRF over parameters. Similar efforts have been made in the field of natural language processing. Sutton and McCallum [6] combined a parsing model with a semantic role labeling model into a unified probabilis-\ntic framework that solved both simultaneously. Ando and Zhang [25] proposed a general framework for learning predictive functional structures from multiple tasks. All these models require knowledge of the inner workings of the individual classifiers, which makes it hard to fit existing state-of-the-art classifiers of certain tasks into the models.\nStructured learning algorithms (e.g., [26–28]) can also be a viable option for the setting of combining multiple tasks. There has been recent development in structured learning on handling latent variables (e.g. hidden conditional random field [29], latent structured SVM [30]), which can be potentially applied to multi-task settings with disjoint datasets. With considerable understanding into each of the tasks, the loss function in structured learning provides a nice way to leverage different tasks. However, in this work, we focus on developing a more generic algorithm that can be easily applied even without intimate knowledge of the tasks.\nThere have been many works which show that with a well-designed model, one can improve the performance of a particular task by using cues from other tasks (e.g., [7– 9]). Saxena et al. manually designed the terms in an MRF to combine depth estimation with object detection [2] and stereo cues [10]. Sudderth et al. [5] used object recognition to help 3D structure estimation. Context. There is a large body of work that leverages contextual information to help specific tasks. Various sources of context have been explored, ranging from the global scene layout, interactions between objects and regions to local features. To incorporate scene-level information, Torralba et al. [31, 32] used the statistics of low-level features across the entire scene to prime object detection or help depth estimation. Hoiem et al. [33] used 3D scene information to provide priors on potential object locations. Park et al. [34] used the ground plane estimation as contextual information for pedestrian detection. Many works also model context to capture the local interactions between neighboring regions [35–37], objects [38–42], or both [43–45]. These methods improve the performance of some specific tasks by combining information from different aspects. However, most of these methods can not be applied to cases when we only have “black-box” classifiers for the individual tasks. Holistic Scene Understanding. Hoiem et. al. [3] proposed an innovative but ad-hoc system that combined boundary detection and surface labeling by sharing some lowlevel information between the classifiers. Li et. al. [4, 46] combined image classification, annotation and segmentation with a hierarchical graphical model. However, these methods required considerable attention to each classifier, and considerable insight into the inner workings of each task and also the connections between them.

In the proposed FE-CCM model, there is feed-back from the latter stages to help achieve a model which optimizes all the tasks considered, jointly. Here Classifieri’s on the two layers can have different forms though they are for the same classification task.

Deep Learning. There is also a large body of work in the areas of deep learning, and we refer the reader to Bengio and LeCun [47] for a nice overview of deep learning architectures and Caruana [48] for multitask learning with shared representation. While efficient back-propagation methods like [49] have been commonly used in learning a multilayer network, it is not as easy to apply to our case where each node is a complex classifier. Most works in deep learning (e.g., [50–52]) are different from our work in that, those works focus on one particular task (same labels) by building different classifier architectures, as compared to our setting of different tasks with different labels. Hinton et al. [51] used unsupervised learning to obtain an initial configuration of the parameters. This provides a good initialization and hence their multi-layered architecture does not suffer from local minimas during optimization. At a high-level, we can also look at our work as a multi-layered architecture (where each node typically produces complex outputs, e.g., labels over the pixels in the image); and initialization in our case comes from existing state-of-the-art individual classifiers. Given this initialization, our training procedure finds parameters that (consistently) improve performance across all the sub-tasks."

      "text" : "In the field of scene understanding, a lot of independent research into each of the vision sub-tasks has led to excellent classifiers. These independent classifiers are typically trained on different or heterogenous datasets due to the lack of ground-truth labels for all the sub-tasks. In addition, each of these classifiers come with their own learning and inference methods. Our goal is to consider each of them as a ‘black-box’, which makes it easy to combine them. We describe what we mean by ‘black-box classifiers’ below.\nBlack-box Classifier. A black-box classifier, as the name suggests, is a classifier for which operations (such as learning and inference algorithms) are available for use, but their inner workings are not known. We assume that,\n4 given the training dataset X, features extracted Ψ(X) and the target outputs of the ith task Yi, the black-box classifier has some internal learning function f ilearn with parameters θi that optimizes the mapping from the inputs to the outputs for the training data. 1 Once the parameters have been learnt, given a new data point, X with features Ψ(X) ∈ RK , where K can be changed as desired,2 the black-box classifier returns the output Ŷi according to its internal inference function f iinfer. This is illustrated through the equations below. For the ith task,\nLearning : θ∗i = optimize θi f ilearn(Ψ(X),Yi; θi) (1)\nInference : Ŷi = optimize Yi\nf iinfer(Ψ(X), Yi; θ ∗ i ). (2)\nThis approach of treating each classifier as a black-box allows us to use different existing classifiers which have been known to perform well at specific sub-tasks. Furthermore, without changing their inner workings, it allows us to compose them into one model which exploits the information from each sub-task to aid holistic scene understanding."

The first layer consists of an instantiation of each of the black-box classifiers with the image features as input. The second layer is a repeated instantiation of each of the classifiers with the first layer classifier outputs as well as the image features as inputs. Note that the repeated classifier on the second layer is not necessary to have the same mathematical form with the one on the first layer. Instead, we consider it as a repeated instantiation only because they are used for the same classification task.\nNotation: We consider n related sub-tasks Classifieri, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} (Figure 2). We describe the notations used in this paper as follows:\nΨi(X) Features corresponding to Classifieri extracted from image X . Zi, Z Zi indicates output from the first layer Classifieri.

      "text" : "During the training stage, the inputs Ψi(X) as well as the target outputs, Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn of the second level of classifiers, are all observed (because the ground-truth labels are available). In our algorithm, we consider Z (outputs of layer 1 and inputs to layer 2) as hidden variables. In previous work, Heitz et al. [11] assume that each layer is independent and that each layer produces the best output independently (without consideration for other layers), and therefore use the ground-truth labels for Z even for training the classifiers in the first layer.\nOn the other hand, we want to optimize for the final outputs as much as possible. Thus the first layer classifiers need not perform their best (w.r.t. groundtruth), but rather focus on error modes that would result in the second layer’s output (Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn) being more correct. Therefore, we learn the model through an iterative ExpectationMaximization formulation, given the independencies between classifiers represented by the model in Figure 2. In one step (Feed-forward step) we assume the variables Zi’s are known and learn the parameters and in the other step (Feed-back step) we fix the parameters estimated previously and estimate the variables Zi’s. Since the Zi’s are not fixed to the ground truth, as the iterations progress, the first level of classifiers start focusing on the error modes which would give the best improvement in performance at the end of the second level of classifiers. The learning algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 2.\n5 Algorithm 2 Learning 1. Initialize latent variables Z with the ground-truth Y .\n2. Do until convergence or maximum iteration: { Feed-foward step: Fix latent variables Z , estimate the parameters Θ and Ω using Equation 5 and Equation 6. Feed-back step: Fix the parameters Θ and Ω, compute latent variables Z using Equation 7. }\nInitialization: We initialize the model by setting the latent variables Zi’s to the groundtruth, i.e. Zi = Z gt i . Training with this initialization, our cascade is equivalent to CCM in [11], where the classifiers (and the parameters) in the first layer are similar to the original state-of-the-art classifier and the classifiers in the second layer use the outputs of the first layer in addition to the original features as input. Feed-forward Step: In this step, we estimate the parameters Θ and Ω. We assume that the latent variables Zi’s are known (and Yi’s are known because they are the groundtruth during learning, i.e. Yi = Y gt i ). We then learn the parameters of each classifier independently. Learning θi is precisely the learning problem of the ‘black-box classifier’, and learning ωi is also an instantiation of the original learning problem, but with the original input features appended with the outputs of the first level classifiers. Therefore, we can use the learning method provided by the individual black-box classifier (Equation 1).\nθ̂i = optimize θi\nf ilearn(Ψi(X),Zi; θi) (5)\nω̂i = optimize ωi\nf ′ i learn([Ψi(X) Z],Yi;ωi) (6)\nWe now have the parameters for all the classifiers. Feed-back Step: In the second step, we will estimate the values of the variables Zi’s assuming that the parameters are fixed (and Yi’s are given because the ground-truth is available, i.e. Yi = Y gt i ). This feed-back step is the crux that provides information to the first-layer classifiers what error modes should be focused on and what can be ignored without hurting the final performance. Given θi’s and ωi’s are fixed, we want the Zi’s to be good predictions from the first-layer classifiers and also help to increase the correction predictions of Yi’s as much as possible. We optimize the following function for the feed-back step:\noptimize Z n∑ i=1 ( J i1(Ψi(X), Zi; θ̂i) + J i 2(Ψi(X),Z, Yi; ω̂i) ) (7) where J i1’s and J i 2’s are functions respectively related to the first-layer classifiers and the second-layer classifiers. one option is to have J i1(Ψi(X), Zi; θ̂i) = f i infer(Ψi(X), Zi; θ̂i) and J i2(Ψi(X),Z, Yi; ω̂i) = f ′ i infer([Ψi(X),Z], Yi; ω̂i) if the intrinsic inference functions for the classifiers are known. More discussions will be given in Section 3.4 if the intrinsic functions are unknown. The updated Zi’s will be used to re-learn the classifier parameters in the feed-forward step of next iteration. Note that the updated Zi’s have continuous values. If the internal learning function of a classifier accepts only labels, we threshold the values of Zi’s to get labels."

      "text" : "Our algorithm can be explained with a probabilistic interpretation where the goal is to maximize the log-likelihood of the outputs of all tasks given the observed inputs, i.e., logP (Y|X), where X is an image belonging to training set Γ. Therefore, the goal of the proposed model shown in Figure 2 is to maximize\nlog ∏ X∈Γ P (Y|X; Θ,Ω) (8)\nTo introduce the hidden valuables Zi’s, we expand Equation 8 as follows, using the independencies represented by the directed model in Figure 2.\n= ∑ X∈Γ log ∑ Z P (Y1, . . . , Yn,Z|X; Θ,Ω) (9)\n= ∑ X∈Γ log ∑ Z n∏ i=1 P (Yi|Ψi(X),Z;ωi)P (Zi|Ψi(X); θi) (10) However, the summation inside the log makes it difficult to learn the parameters. Motivated by the Expectation Maximization algorithm [53], we iterate between the two steps as described in the following. Again we initialize the classifiers by learning the classifiers with ground-truth as discussed Section 3.3. Feed-forward Step: In this step, we estimate the parameters by assuming that the latent variables Zi’s are known (and Yi’s are known anyway because they are the groundtruth). This results in\nmaximize θ1,...,θn,ω1,...,ωn ∑ X∈Γ log n∏ i=1 P (Yi|Ψi(X),Z;ωi)P (Zi|Ψi(X); θi)\n(11)\nNow in this feed-forward step, the terms for maximizing the different parameters turn out to be independent. So, for the ith classifier we have:\nmaximize θi ∑ X∈Γ logP (Zi|Ψi(X); θi) (12)\nmaximize ωi ∑ X∈Γ logP (Yi|Ψi(X),Z;ωi) (13)\nNote that the optimization problem nicely breaks down into the sub-problems of training the individual classifier for the respective sub-tasks. We can solve each sub-problem separately given the probabilistic interpretation of the corresponding classifier. When the classifier is taken as ‘blackbox’, this can be approximated using the original learning method provided by the individual black-box classifier (Equation 5 and Equation 6) Feed-back Step: In this step, we estimate the values of the latent variables Zi’s assuming that the parameters are fixed. We perform MAP inference on Zi’s (and not marginalization). This can be considered as a special variant of the general EM framework (hard EM, [54]). Using Equation 10, we get the following optimization problem: maximize\nZ logP (Y1, . . . , Yn,Z|X; θ̂1, . . . , θ̂n, ω̂1, . . . , ω̂n)⇔\nmaximize Z n∑ i=1 ( logP (Yi|Ψi(X),Z; ω̂i) + logP (Zi|Ψi(X); θ̂i) ) (14)\nThis maximization problem requires that we have access to the characterization of the individual black-box classifiers\n6 in a probabilistic form. If the probabilistic interpretations of the classifiers are known, we can solve the above function accordingly. Note that Equation 14 is same as Equation 7 with J i1(Ψi(X), Zi; θ̂i) = logP (Zi|Ψi(X); θ̂i) and J i2(Ψi(X),Z, Yi; ω̂i) = logP (Yi|Ψi(X),Z; ω̂i).\nIn some cases, the classifier log-likelihoods in Equation 14 actually turn out to be convex. For example, if the individual classifiers are linear or logistic classifiers, the minimization problem is convex and can be solved using gradient descent (or any such method).\nHowever, if the probabilistic interpretations of the classifiers are unknown, the feedback step requires extra modeling. Some modeling options are provided as follows:\n• Case 1: Insight into the vision problem is available. In this case, one could use the domain knowledge of the task into the problem to properly model J i1’s and J i 2’s. • Case 2: No insight into the vision problem is available and no internal function of the original classifier is known. In this case, we formulate the J i1’s and J i 2’s\nas follows. The J i1 is defined to be a distance function between the target Zi and the estimated Ẑi, which serves as a regularization for the first-layer classifiers.\nJ i1(Ψi(X), Zi; θ̂i) = ∣∣∣∣∣∣Zi − Ẑi∣∣∣∣∣∣2\ns.t. Ẑi = optimize Zi\nf iinfer(Ψi(X), Zi; θ̂i) (15)\nTo formulate J i2’s, we make a variational approximation on the output of the second-layer classifier for task i (i.e., approximating it as a Gaussian, [55]) to get:\nminimize αi ∑ X∈Γ ∣∣∣∣∣∣Ŷi − αTi [Ψi(X), Ẑ]∣∣∣∣∣∣2 2\n(16)\nwhere αi are parameters of the approximation model. Ŷi is the actual output of the second layer classifier for the task i, i.e. Ŷi = optimizeYi f ′ infer([Ψi(X) Ẑ], Yi; ω̂i). Then we define the J i2’s as follows.\nJ i2(Ψi(X),Z, Yi; ω̂i) = ∣∣∣∣∣∣Yi − α̂Ti [Ψi(X),Z]∣∣∣∣∣∣2\n2 (17)\nSparsity: Note that the parameter αi is typically extremely high-dimensional (and increases with the number of tasks) because the second layer classifiers take as input the original features as well as outputs of all previous layers. The learning for the approximation model may become ill-conditioned. Therefore, we want our model to select only a few non-zero weights, i.e., only a few non-zero entries in αi. We do this by introducing the l1 sparsity in the parameters [56]. So Equation 16 is extended as follows.\nminimize αi ∑ X∈Γ (∣∣∣∣∣∣Ŷi − αTi [Ψi(X), Ẑ]∣∣∣∣∣∣2 2 + β |αi| ) (18)\nInference: As introduced in Section 3.2, our inference procedure consists of two steps: first maximize over hidden variable Z and then maximize over Y . 3\nẐ = argmax Z logP (Z|X, Θ̂) (19)\nŶ = argmax Y logP (Y|Ẑ, X, Ω̂) (20)\n3. Another alternative would have been to maximize P (Y |X) =∑ Z P (Y, Z|X); however, this would require marginalization over the variable Z which is expensive to compute.\nGiven the structure of our directed graph, the outputs for different classifiers on the same layer are independent given their inputs and parameters. Therefore, Equations 19 and 20 are equivalent to the following:\nẐi = argmax Zi\nlogP (Zi|Ψi(X); θ̂i), i = 1, . . . , n (21)\nŶi = argmax Yi\nlogP (Yi|Ψi(X); Ẑ; ω̂i), i = 1, . . . , n (22)\nAs we see, Equation 21 and Equation 22 are instantiations of Equation 3 and Equation 4 in the probabilistic form."

In this section, we show our formulation for this general case, where we use Γi as the dataset that has labels only for the ith task.\nIn the following we provide the modifications to the feedforward step and the feed-back step while dealing with disjoint datasets, i.e., data in dataset Γi only have labels for the ith task. These modifications also allow us to develop different variants of the model, described in Section 4.1. Feed-forward Step: Using the feedback step, we can have Zi’s for all the data. Therefore, we use all the datasets in order to re-learn each of the first-layer classifiers. If the internal learning function of the black-box classifier is additive over the data points, then we have\nθ̂i = optimize θi ∑ j ∑ X∈Γj πjf i learn(Ψi(X), Zi; θi), (23)\nwhere πj’s are the importance factors given to different datasets, and satisfy ∑ j πj = 1. (See Section 4.1 on how to choose πj’s.) If the internal learning function is not additive over the data points, we provide an alternative solution here. We sample a subset of data Xj from each dataset Γj , i.e. Xj ⊆ Γj and combine them into a new set X = [X1, . . . ,Xn]. In X, the ratio of data belonging to Xj is equal to πj , i.e. |X\nj | |X| = πj , where | · | indicates the number of datapoints. Then we can learn the parameters of the first-layer classifiers as follows.\nθ̂i = optimize θi\nf ilearn(Ψi(X),Zi; θi), (24)\nTo re-learn the second-layer classifiers, the only change made to Equation 6 is that instead of using all data while optimizing for a particular task, we use only the data-points that have the ground-truth label for the corresponding task. ω̂i = optimize\nωi\nf ′ i learn([Ψi(X) Z],Yi;ωi), s.t. X = Γi (25)\nFeed-back Step: In this step, we change Equation 7 as follows. Since a datapoint in the set Γj only has groundtruth label for the jth task (Yj), we only consider J j 2 in the second term. However, since this datapoint has outputs for all the first-layer classifiers using the feed-forward step, we consider all the J i1’s, i = 1, · · · , n. Therefore, in order to obtain the value of Z corresponding to each data-point X ∈ Γj , we have\noptimize Z n∑ i=1 ( J i1(Ψj(X), Zi; θ̂i) ) + Jj2 (Ψj(X),Z, Yj ; ω̂j).\n(26)\n7"

      "text" : "The parameters πj allow us to formulate three different instantiations of our model.\n• Unified FECCM: In this instantiation, our goal is to achieve improvements in all tasks with one set of parameters {Θ,Ω}. We want to balance the data from different datasets (i.e., with different task labels). Towards this goal, πj is set to be inversely proportional to the amount of data in the dataset of the jth task. Therefore, the unified FECCM balances the amount of data in different datasets, based on Equation 23.\n• One-goal FECCM: In this instantiation, we set πj = 1 if j = k, and πj = 0 otherwise. This is an extreme setting to favor the specific task k. In this case, the retraining of the first-layer classifiers will only use the feedback from the Classifierk on the second layer, i.e., only use the dataset with labels for the kth task. Therefore, FECCM degrades to a model with only one target task (the kth\ntask) on the second layer and all the other tasks are only instantiated on the first layer. Although the goal in this setting is to completely benefit the kth task, in practice it often results in overfitting and does not always achieve the best results even for the specific task (see Table 1 in Section 6). In this case, we train different models, i.e. different θi’s and ωi’s, for different target tasks.\n• Target-Specific FECCM: This instantiation is to optimize the performance of a specific task. As compared to one-goal FECCM where we manually remove the other tasks on the second layer, in this instantiation we keep all the tasks on the second layer and conduct data-driven selection of the parameters πj for different datasets. In detail, πj is selected through cross validation on a hold-out set in the learning process in order to optimize the second-layer output of a specific task. Since TargetSpecific FECCM still has all the tasks instantiated on the second layer, the re-training of the first-layer classifiers can still use data from different datasets (i.e., with different task labels). Here we train different models, i.e. different θi’s and ωi’s, for different target tasks."

      "heading" : "5 SCENE UNDERSTANDING: IMPLEMENTATION",
      "text" : "In this section we describe the implementation details of our instantiation of FE-CCM for scene understanding. Each of the classifiers described below for the sub-tasks are our “base-model” shown in Table 1. In some sub-tasks, our base-model will be simpler than the state-of-the-art models (that are often hand-tuned for the specific sub-tasks respectively). However, even when using base-models in our FE-CCM, our model will still outperform the stateof-the-art models for the respective sub-tasks (on the same standard respective datasets) in Section 6.\nIn order to explain the implementation details for the different tasks, we will use the following notation. Let i be the index of the tasks we consider. We consider 6 tasks for our experiments on scene understanding: scene categorization (i = 1), depth estimation (i = 2), event\ncategorization (i = 3), saliency detection (i = 4), object detection (i = 5) and geometric labeling (i = 6). The inputs for the jth task at the first layer are given by the low-level features Ψj . At the second layer, in addition to the original features Ψj , the inputs include the outputs from the first layer classifiers. This is given by,\nΦj = [Ψj Z1 Z2 Z3 Z4 Z5 Z6] (27) where, Φj is the input feature vector for the jth task on the second layer, and Zi (i = 1, . . . , 6) represents the output from the ith task which is appended to the input to the jth task on the second layer and so on.\nScene Categorization. For scene categorization, we classify an image into one of the 8 categories defined by Torralba et al. [57] tall building, inside city, street, highway, coast, open country, mountain and forest. We evaluate the performance by measuring the rate of incorrectly assigning a scene label to an image on the MIT outdoor scene dataset [57]. The feature inputs for the first-layer scene classifier Ψ1 ∈ R512 is the GIST feature [57], extracted at 4 × 4 regions of the image, on 4 scales and 8 orientations.\nWe use an RBF-Kernel SVM classifier [58], as the firstlayer scene classifier, and a multi-class logistic classifier for the second layer. The output of the first-layer scene classifier Z1 ∈ R8 is an 8-dimensional vector where each element represents the log-odds score of the corresponding image belonging to a scene category. This 8-dimensional output is fed to each of the second-layer classifiers.\nDepth Estimation. For the single image depth estimation task, we estimate the depth of every pixel in an image. We evaluate the estimation performance by computing the root mean square error of the estimated depth with respect to ground truth laser scan depth using the Make3D Range Image dataset [59, 60]. We uniformly divide each image into 55 × 305 patches as [59]. The feature inputs for the first-layer depth estimation Ψ2 ∈ R104 are features which capture texture, color and gradient properties of the patch. This is obtained by convolving the image with Laws’ masks and computing the energy and Kurtosis over the patch along with the shape features as described by Saxena et al. [59].\nWe use a linear regression for the first-level and secondlevel instantiation of the depth estimation module. The output of the first-layer depth estimation Z2 ∈ R+ is the predicted depth of each patch in the image. In order to feed the first-layer depth output to the second-layer classifiers, for the scene categorization and event categorization tasks, we use a vector with the predicted depth of all patches in the image; for the other tasks, we use the 1-dimensional predicted depth for the patch/pixel/bounding-box, etc.\nEvent Categorization: For event categorization, we classify an image into one of the 8 sports events as defined by Li et al. [46]: bocce, badminton, polo, rowing, snowboarding, croquet, sailing and rock-climbing. For evaluation, we compute the rate of incorrectly assigning an event label to an image. The feature inputs for the first-layer event classifier Ψ3 ∈ R43 is a 43-dimensional feature vector, which includes the top 30 PCA projections of the 512- dimensional GIST features [61], the 12-dimension global\n8 color features (mean and variance of RGB and YCrCb color channels over the entire image), and a bias term.\nWe use a multi-class logistic classifier on each layer for event classification. The output of the first-layer event classifier Z3 ∈ R8 is an 8-dimensional vector where each element represents the log-odd score of the corresponding image belonging to a event category. This 8-dimensional output is feed to each of the second-layer classifiers.\nSaliency Detection. The goal of the saliency detection task is to classify each pixel in the image as either salient or non-salient. We use the saliency detection dataset used by Achanta et. al. [62] for our experiments. The feature inputs for the first-layer saliency classifier Ψ4 ∈ R4 includes the 3-dimensional color-offset features based on the Lab color space as described by Achanta et al. [62] and a bias term.\nWe use a logistic model for the saliency estimation classifiers on both layers. The output of the first-layer saliency classifier Z4 ∈ R is the log-odd score of a pixel being salient. In order to feed the first-layer saliency detection output to the second-layer classifiers, for the scene categorization and event categorization tasks, we form a vector with the predicted saliency of all the pixels in the image; for the other tasks, we use the 1-dimensional average saliency for the corresponding pixel/patch/bounding-box.\nObject Detection. We consider the following object categories: car, person, horse and cow. We use the train-set and test-set of PASCAL 2006 [63] for our experiments. Our object detection module builds on the part-based detector of Felzenszwalb et. al. [64]. We first generate 5 to 100 candidate windows for each image by applying the partbased detector with a low threshold (over-detection). The feature inputs for the first-layer object detection classifier Ψ5 ∈ RK are the HOG features extracted based on the candidate window as [65] plus the detection score from the part-based detector [64]. K depends on the number of scales to be considered and the size of the object template.\nWe learn an RBF-kernel SVM model as the first layer classifier. The classifier assigns each window a +1 or 0 label indicating whether the window belongs to the object or not. For the second-layer classifier, we learn a logistic model over the feature vector constituted by the outputs of all first-level tasks and the original HOG feature. We use average precision to quantitatively measure the performance. The output of the first-layer object detection classifier Z5 ∈ R4 are the estimated 0 or 1 labels for a region to belong to the 4 object categories we consider. In order to feed the first-layer object detection output to the second-layer classifiers, we first generate a detection map for each object. Pixels inside the estimated positive boxes are labeled as “+1”, otherwise they are labeled as “0”. For scene categorization and event categorization on the second layer, we feed all the elements on the map; for the other tasks, we use the 1-dimensional average value on the map for the corresponding pixel/patch/bounding-box.\nGeometric labeling. The geometric labeling task refers to assigning each pixel to one of three geometric classes: support, vertical and sky, as defined by Hoiem et al. [33].\nFor evaluation, we compute the accuracy of assigning the correct geometric label to a pixel. The feature inputs for the first-layer geometry labeling classifier Ψ6 ∈ R52 are the region-based features as described by Hoiem et al. [33].\nWe use the dataset and the algorithm by [33] as the firstlayer geometric labeling module. To reduce the computation time, we avoid the multiple segmentations and instead use a single segmentation with 100 segments per image. We use a logistic model as the second-layer classifier. The output of the first-layer geometry classifier Z6 ∈ R3 is a 3-dimensional vector with each element representing the log-odd score of the corresponding pixel belonging to a geometric category. In order to feed the first-layer geometry output to the second-layer classifiers, for scene/event categorization we form a vector with the predicted scores of all pixels; for the other tasks we use the 3-dimensional vector with each element representing the average scores for the corresponding pixel/patch/bounding-box."

In our experiment, the training of FE-CCM takes 4-5 iterations. For each of the sub-tasks in each of the domains, we evaluate our performance on the standard dataset for that sub-task (and compare against the specifically designed state-of-the-art algorithm for that dataset).

      "text" : "To quantitatively evaluate our method for each of the subtasks, we consider the metrics appropriate to each of the six tasks in Section 5. Table 1 and Figure 3 show that FECCM not only beats state of the art in all the tasks but also does it jointly as one single unified model.\nIn detail, we see that all-features-direct improves over the base model because it uses features from all the tasks.\nThe state-of-the-art classifiers improve on the base model by explicitly hand-designing the task specific probabilistic model [46, 59] or by using adhoc methods to implicitly use information from other tasks [33]. Our FE-CCM model, which is a single model that was not given any manually designed task-specific insight, achieves a more significant improvement over the base model.\nWe also compare the three instantiations of FE-CCM in Table 1 (the last three rows). We observe that the target-specific FE-CCM achieves the best performance, by selecting a set of πj’s to optimize for each task independently. Though the unified FE-CCM achieves slightly worse performance, it jointly optmizes for all the tasks by training only one set of parameters. The performance of one-goal FE-CCM is less stable compared to the other two instantiations. It is mainly because the first-layer classifiers only gain feedback from the specific task on the second layer in one-goal FE-CCM, which easily causes overfitting.\nWe note that our target-specific FE-CCM, which is optimized for each task independently and achieves the best performance, is a more fair comparison to the state-of-theart because each state-of-the-art model is trained specifically for the respective task. Furthermore, Figure 3 shows the results for CCM (which is a cascade without feedback information) and all-features-direct (which uses features\n4. The state-of-the-art method for depth estimation in [59] follows a slightly different testing procedure. In that case, our target-specific FECCM method achieves RMSE = 15.3.\nfrom all the tasks). This indicates that the improvement is strictly due to the proposed feedback and not just because of having more information.\nWe show some visual improvements due to the proposed FE-CCM in Figure 4. In comparison to CCM, FE-CCM leads to better depth estimation of the sky and the ground, and it leads to better coverage and accurate labeling of the salient region in the image, and it also leads to better geometric labeling and object detection. Figure 5 also provides the confusion matrices for the three tasks: scene categorization, event categorization, geometric labeling.\nFigure 6 provides scatter plots of the performance difference for each image between the unified FE-CCM method and the all-features-direct method, respectively for the tasks of geometric labeling, saliency detection, and depth estimation. We note that for all three tasks, the unified FECCM outperforms the all-features-direct method on most images. For geometric labeling and saliency detection, the improvement from the unified FE-CCM method is mainly due to large improvements on some images. For depth estimation, the improvement is scattered over many images.\nThe cause of improvement. We have shown improvements of FE-CCM in Table 1 under the situation of heterogeneous\ndatasets. The improvement can be caused by one or both of the following reasons: (1) the feedback process finds better error modes for the first-layer classifiers; (2) the feedback generates additional “labels” to retrain the firstlayer classifiers. In order to analyze this, we consider the two tasks of scene recognition and object detection on the DS1 dataset in [11], which contains ground-truth labels for both the tasks. We compare the various methods under two settings: (1) train with the fully-labeled data; (2) train with only the scene labels for one half of the training data and only the object labels for the second half. Table 2 compares the performance of training with partially-labeled datasets and the performance of different methods under these two settings. The experiments are performed using 5-fold cross validation. The unified FE-CCM method outperforms the other methods under both partially-labeled and fully-labeled situations. We note that all methods listed perform better when full labels are provided. In fact, FE-CCM achieves close performance in both settings. We also note that the FE-CCM method trained with partially-labeled datasets outperforms the CCM method trained with fully-labeled datasets, which indicates that the improvement achieved by the FE-CCM method is not simply from generating more labels for training the first-layer classifiers, but also due to finding useful modes for the first-layer classifiers.\nFigure 7 illustrates the first-layer outputs of a test image, respectively at initialization and at the 5th iteration. Our\ninitialization is the same as CCM, i.e., using groundtruth labels to train the first-layer classifiers. We note that with feedback, the first-layer output shifts to focus on more meaningful modes, e.g., At initialization, the event classifier has widespread confusion with other categories. With feedback, the event classifier turns to be confused with only the ’rock-climbing’ and ’croquet’ events which are more similar to ’bocce’. Moreover, the first-layer scene, depth, and object classifiers also give more meaningful predictions while trained with feedback. With better firstlayer predictions, our FE-CCM correctly classifies the event as ’bocce’, while CCM misclassifies it as ’rowing’."

      "text" : "FE-CCM allows each classifier in the second layer to learn which information from the other first-layer sub-tasks is useful, and this can be seen in the learned weights Ω for the second-layer. We provide a visualization of the weights for the six vision tasks in Figure 8(a). We see that the model agrees with our intuitions that large weights are assigned to the outputs of the same task from the first layer classifier (see the large weights assigned to the diagonals in the categorization tasks), though saliency detection is an exception which depends more on its original features (not shown here) and the geometric labeling output. We also observe that the weights are sparse. This is an advantage of our approach since the algorithm automatically figures out which outputs from the first level classifiers are useful for the second level classifier to achieve the best performance.\nFigure 8(b) provides a closer look to the positive weights given to the various outputs for a second-level geometric classifier. We observe that large positive weights are assigned to “mountain”, “forest”, “tall building”, etc. for supporting the geometric class “vertical”, and similarly “coast”, “sailing” and “depth” for supporting the “sky”\nclass. These illustrate some of the relationships the model learns automatically without any manual intricate modeling.\nFigure 8(c) visualizes the weights given to the depth attributes (first-layer depth outputs) for the task of event categorization. Figure 8(d) shows the same for the task of scene categorization. We see that the depth plays an important role in these tasks. In Figure 8(c), we observe that most event categories rely on the middle part of the image, where the main objects of the event are often located. E.g., most of the “polo” images have horses and people in the middle of the image while many “snowboarding” images have people jumping in the upper-middle part. For scene categorization, most of the scene categories (e.g., coast, mountain, open country) have sky in the top part, which is not as discriminative as the bottom part. In scene categories of tall buildings and street, the upper part of the street consists of buildings, which discriminates these two categories from the others. Not surprisingly, our method had automatically figured this out (see Figure 8(d)). Stability of the FE-CCM algorithm: In this paper, we have presented results for six sub-tasks. In order to find out how our method scales with different combination and number of sub-tasks, we have tried several combinations, and in each case we get consistent improvement in each sub-task. For example, in our preliminary experiments, we combined depth estimation and scene categorization and our reduction in error are 12.0% and 13.2% respectively. Combining scene categorization and object detection gives us 15.4% and 10.2% respective improvements (Table 2). We then combined four tasks: event categorization, scene categorization, depth estimation, and saliency detection, and got improvements in all these sub-tasks [22]. Finally, we also combined different tasks for robotic applications, and the performance improvement was similar.\n12\nsup por\nt\nver tica l sky\n(a) (b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFig. 8.

In this work, we use our FE-CCM to combine object classification and grasping point detection. Implementation: We work with the labeled synthetic dataset by Saxena et al.

The six object categories include spherically symmetric objects such as cerealbowl, rectangular objects such as eraser, martini glass, books, cups and long objects such as pencil.\nFor grasp point detection, we compute image and depthmap features at each point in the image (using codes given by [66]). The features describe the response of the image and the depth map to a bank of filters (similar to Make3D) while also capturing information from the neighboring grid elements.

Similarly, office scenes are more likely to contain tv-monitors than kitchen scenes. Furthermore, it is also intuitive that shoes are more likely to appear on the supportive surface such as floor, instead of the vertical surface such as the wall. Therefore, in this work, we use our FE-CCM to combine object detection with indoor scene categorization and geometric labeling. Implementation: For scene categorization, we use the indoor scene subsets in the Cal-Scene Dataset [68] and\n13\nclassify an image into one of the four categories: bedroom, living room, kitchen and office. For geometric labeling, we use the Indoor Layout Data [69] and assign each pixel to one of three geometry classes: ground, wall and ceiling. We use the same features and classifiers for scene categorization as in Section 5.\nFor object detection, we use the PASCAL 2007 Dataset [70] and our own shoe dataset to learn detectors for four object categories: shoe, dining table, tv-monitor, and sofa. We first use the part-based object detection algorithm in [38] to create candidate windows, and then use the same classifiers as described in Section 5. Results: We use this method to build a shoe-finding robot, as shown on Figure 11-left. With a limited number of training images (86 positive images in our case), it is hard to train a robust shoe detector to find a shoe far away from the camera. However, using our FE-CCM model, the robot learns to leverage the other tasks and performs more robust shoe detection. Figure 11-right shows a successful detection.

Our method introduces feedback in the training process from the later stage to the earlier one, so that a later classifier can provide the earlier classifiers information about what error modes to focus on, or what can be ignored without hurting the joint performance.\nOur extensive experiments show that our unified model (a single FE-CCM trained for all the sub-tasks) improves performance significantly across all the sub-tasks considered over the respective state-of-the-art classifiers.

These classifiers operate on the same raw image and provide correlated outputs. It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring any changes to the inner workings of any classifier. We propose Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models (FE-CCM), that jointly optimizes all the sub-tasks, while requiring only a ‘black-box’ interface to the original classifier for each sub-task. We use a two-layer cascade of classifiers, which are repeated instantiations of the original ones, with the output of the first layer fed into the second layer as input. Our training method involves a feedback step that allows later classifiers to provide earlier classifiers information about which error modes to focus on. We show that our method significantly improves performance in all the sub-tasks in the domain of scene understanding, where we consider depth estimation, scene categorization, event categorization, object detection, geometric labeling and saliency detection. Our method also improves performance in two robotic applications: an object-grasping robot and an object-finding robot.",
