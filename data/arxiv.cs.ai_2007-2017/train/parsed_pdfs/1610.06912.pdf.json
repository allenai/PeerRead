      "text" : "Over the last few years, significant advances have been made in automatically constructing knowledge graphs such as NELL [30], Yago [37], Knowledge-Vault [10] etc., by extracting information from web documents and storing them into coherent Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Such KGs contain hundreds of predicate-relations (e.g., city, stadiumLocatedInCity) and millions of their instances called beliefs (e.g., (Joe Luis Arena, stadiumLocatedInCity, Detroit)). Due to imperfections in automatic models and unreliability of source web documents, many of these beliefs in the KG may be noisy. Reliably estimating accuracy of such KGs is of great importance before they are used in downstream applications. Human judgments are necessary in this accuracy estimation process. Please note that the evaluation process can’t be\ncompletely automated as any system which is highly effective at estimating belief accuracy may as well be utilized during KG construction rather than evaluation.\nCrowdsourcing marketplaces such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)1 have emerged as a convenient way to collect human judgments on a variety of tasks, ranging from document and image classification to scientific experimentation [15, 26, 6, 21]. AMT provides a platform where a requester may post a Human Intelligence Task (HIT) which is carried out by one or more workers geographically distributed all around the world. Depending on the complexity of the task and desired level of expertise, the requester provides monetary compensation against successful completion of HIT(s).\nIn standard crowdsourcing settings, HITs are available apriori, and the requester sets the per-HIT payment and number of workers subject to the available budget before publishing the HITs. More recently, algorithms have been developed to adjust these parameters adaptively [1, 14]. However, in many crowdsourcing applications of practical significance, far too many HITs are available than what can realistically be covered by limited available budget. Hence, in such cases, there is a need to select subset of HITs, either adaptively or offline, which can fit in the available budget. Estimating the accuracy of automatically constructed Knowledge Graphs (KG) is one such instance.\nIn order to get the true accuracy of the KG, we would like to determine correctness of each and every belief in the KG. A HIT in this context is determining the correctness of a single belief. However, even with nominal rates like $0.01 per belief evaluation, and 1 worker per belief, we will need $10,000 to evaluate a KG with 1 million beliefs. This is prohibitively expensive, as available budgets are usually orders of magnitude smaller and many of these KGs bigger than this. So, the crucial problem here is:\nHow can we select a subset of beliefs (HITs) to evaluate which will (1) give the best estimate of true (but unknown) accuracy of the KG; and (2) require limited budget."

      "text" : "While randomly sampling a subset of beliefs (edges of the KG) is a natural approach for its evaluation, this is often suboptimal as it ignores the inherent structural information. Let us motivate this through a small KG shown in Figure 1.\nThere are six correct and two incorrect beliefs, resulting in overall true KG accuracy of 75% which we would like to estimate. Here, each belief corresponds to a triple like\n1AMT: http://www.mturk.com\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n06 91\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 1\nO ct\n2 01\n6\n(RedWings, isA, SportsTeam) which is an edge with its participating nodes in the graph.\nFirst, we observe that the beliefs in this example are not independent – there are coupling constraints among them. Type consistency constraint between categories and the relations connecting them, is one such example. For instance, from KG ontology we may know that homeStadiumOf relation connects an entity from the Stadium category to another entity in Sports Team category. Now, if (Joe Louis Arena, homeStadiumOf, Red Wings) is sampled and evaluated to be correct, then from these constraints we can immediately infer that (Joe Louis Arena, isA, Stadium) and (Red Wings, isA, Sports Team) are correct. Similarly, by evaluating (Taj Mahal, isA, State), which turns out to be false, we can infer that (Detroit, cityInState, TajMahal) is incorrect. In addition to type coupling constraints, Horn clauses [30, 25], such as homeStadiumOf ∧ homeCity → stadiumLocatedInCity, can also be used. By additionally evaluating (Red Wings, homeCity, Detroit) and applying this horn clause to the already evaluated facts mentioned above, we can immediately infer that (Joe Louis Arena, stadiumLocatedInCity, Detroit) is also correct. We will explore generalized forms of these constraints in Section 3.1.\nThus, by exploiting the coupling constraints among beliefs and by evaluating only three of them, we are able to exactly estimate true accuracy of 75%. In contrast, random sampling, a popular alternative, when allowed to evaluate only three beliefs, estimates an expected accuracy of 66.7%.\nIn this paper, we make the following contributions:\n• We introduce Relational Crowdsourcing (RelCrowd), a new paradigm aimed at crowdsourcing over multirelational data where the number of potential HITs far exceeds what can be accommodated within limited available budget. RelCrowd exploits dependencies among HITs to reduce the number of explicit evaluation queries to humans, resulting in more effective budget utilization.\n• We apply the RelCrowd for quality estimation of automatically constructed KGs such as NELL [30] and\nYago [37]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such system of its kind to work in multi-relational setting.\n• We demonstrate that the objective optimized by RelCrowd using our inference method is in fact submodular, and hence allowing for application of efficient approximation algorithms with guarantees.\n• We report extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets to demonstrate effectiveness of RelCrowd.\nWe next formulate our problem in Section 2 and in doing so also establish the notations used throughout this paper. We then discuss the applicability of our approach for KG evaluation in Section 3 and present experimental results in Section 5."

Mapping function l(hi) ∈ {0, 1} returns the value of evaluation label of hi, more generally l({h1 . . . ht}) → {0, 1}t return binary labels for set. Label for hi could either be gold expert label lg(hi) or its estimate lu(hi) as returned by noisy crowd worker u.\nWe also have access to a set of coupling constraints C = {(Ci, θi)} where each coupling constraint Ci enforces consistency of judgment assignments over subset of HITs, and θi ∈ R represents the strength of this enforcement. Further, we may write each coupling constraint as Ci : Hi → R where Hi ⊆ H is the subset of tasks over which Ci operates, also referred to as Dom(Ci). The procedure to derive these constraints involves determining relationships among HITs which we will further explain in Section 3.1.\nTo assimilate all HITs and coupling constraints at one place, we construct a graph G = (H ∪ C, E). Both, HITs as well as constraints are treated as nodes in this graph. The edges, connecting these two types of nodes, denote the participation of tasks in coupling constraints. Specific details of graph construction will be further explained in Section 3.2.\nGiven a set of already crowdsourced HITs Q ⊆ H, we define inferable set I ( G,Q,Θ ) ⊆ H to be the set of HITs whose categorization labels may be automatically inferred by an inference algorithm, while using the coupling constraints C. Θ denotes the parameters required by inference algorithm. Given a set of categorized HITs Q ⊆ H, we define Φ(Q) = 1|Q| ∑ h∈Q lg(h)."

Unfortunately, computing Φ(H) is not feasible in most application settings as evaluation of all HITs in H may be prohibitively expensive, i.e., ∑ h∈H c(h) B, primarily due to high cardinality of H. In Relational Crowdsourcing (RelCrowd), we are interested in posting a smaller subset of HITs Q ⊆ H to crowd such that the resulting inferable set I ( G,Q,Θ ) provides the best estimate of Φ(H) under all possible choices of Q, while staying within crowdsourcing budget B. This may be formulated as follows:\narg min Q⊆H\n∆Q = ∣∣∣Φ(H)− Φ(I(G,Q,Θ))∣∣∣\ns.t. ∑ h∈Q c(h) ≤ B\nwhere ∆Q measures the deviation in average categorization scores of H and I ( G,Q,Θ ) .

If the labels in Q̄ are perfectly correlated with labels of corresponding HITs in H (i.e., the inference algorithm expands binary scores {0, 1} of other HITs given seed set Q well), then the above problem may be equivalently formulated as below:\narg max Q⊆H ∣∣I(G,Q,Θ)∣∣ , s.t. ∑ h∈Q c(h) ≤ B (1)\n2 In this paper, we restrict our Φ function to average aggregation and HITs to binary categorization tasks.

Given a set of evaluated HITs Q, Φ ( I(G,Q,Θ) ) is accuracy of the corresponding beliefs in its inferable set, whereas Φ(H) is the overall gold accuracy of entire KG. We would like to estimate this unknown quantity by crowdsourcing a small subset Q identified by optimizing the RelCrowd objective shown in Equation (1).\nIn order to solve the RelCrowd objective in the context of KG evaluation, we proceed as follows:\n• We first create a new graph, the Evaluation Coupling Graph (ECG), which puts the KG and coupling constraints into one structure. Coupling constraints are described in Section 3.1, and construction of ECG is described in Section 3.2.\n• Given an ECG graph and a few evaluated HITs in it, in Section 3.3, we address the question of how this seed evaluation may be propagated to estimate evaluation of other currently non-evaluated HITs. This constitutes the Inference Mechanism.\n• Given a partially evaluated ECG, in Section 3.4, we address the question of which next HIT(s) should be evaluated using the crowd.

      "text" : "Each coupling constraint Ci ∈ C in KG evaluation setting is a First Order Logic rule (horn clause) which allows us to infer the evaluation label of a HIT based on evaluations of one or more other HITs. Examples of a few such coupling constraints are shown below.\nC1: (JoeLouisArena, homeStadiumOf, RedWings) → (JoeLouisArena, isA, stadium) C2: (JoeLouisArena, homeStadiumOf, RedWings) → (RedWings, isA, sportsTeam) C5: (JoeLouisArena, homeStadiumOf, RedWings) ∧ (RedWings, homeCity, Detroit) → (JoeLouisArena,\nstadiumLocatedInCity, Detroit)\nFor each Ci, HIT(s) to the left of the arrow constitute its body, while the HIT to the right is its head. Horn clauses are frequently occurring patterns in the KG which capture common sense inference knowledge. For example, we know from predefined ontology that (domain, range) type signature of homeCity relation is (sportsTeam, city). Coupling constraint C2 enforces type consistency between two HITs sharing the entity RedWings. So the enforcement of this constraint helps us infer that (RedWings, isA, sportsTeam) should be correct if (JoeLouisArena, homeStadiumOf, RedWings) is evaluated to be correct.\nSimilarly, coupling constraint C5, which is automatically mined first order rule from KG, conveys that a stadium S which is home to certain team T based in city C, is itself located in city C. It allows us to infer the correctness of a HIT based on the truth labels of two other HITs. Given a KG, recent research has developed efficient techniques to automatically learn such coupling constraints [25, 12]. We want to emphasize the fact that these first-order-logic rules are automatically generated over KG and not manually curated. These are generally series of relations (paths in KG) which are good predictors of a given relation and we use such automatically learned coupling constraints for the experiments in this paper.\nOther types of constraints, like subsumption relation, mutual exclusion, etc., which have also been successfully employed during knowledge extraction in NELL [30] and during integration of such extracted knowledge [34], can also be used as coupling constraints.\nThe above rules depict how labels of evaluated HITs h ∈ Q are coupled together to be consistent with one another. Relational Crowdsourcing exploits these rules to our benefit by crowdsourcing only a much smaller set Q and propagating their evaluation labels over I(G,Q,Θ) with coupling weight θj ."

The constraint node is connected to all the HIT nodes that\nit operates over. We call this graph the Evaluation Coupling Graph (ECG), represented as G = (H∪C, E) with the set of undirected edges E = {(c, h) | h ∈ H, ∃c ∈ C, h ∈ Dom(c)}. Please note that the ECG is in fact a bi-partite factor graph [24] with HIT nodes corresponding to variable-nodes and coupling constraint nodes corresponding to factor-nodes.\nExample of an ECG constructed out of the KG in Figure 1 and coupling constraint set C with |C| = 8 is shown in Figure 2. In this figure, there is a separate node corresponding to each of the eight edges (beliefs or HITs) in Figure 1. Also, there are eight coupling nodes corresponding to each coupling constraint operating over subset of these HIT nodes.\nWe want to bring forward the multi-relational property of Relational Crowdsourcing into notice. Observe the each first-order constraint node Cj is assigned θj weight, which ranks it among other rules. Higher weight indicates greater chances of being true and such constraint nodes will be more influential over other lower-weight rules in case of conflicts. We pose the Relational Crowdsourcing problem as classification of HIT nodes in ECG and covering that essential subset Q which induces a larger coverage, using coupling constraints, over all tasks."

      "heading" : "3.3 Inference Mechanism",
      "text" : "Given a set of crowd evaluated tasks, it is essential to design an inference mechanism which helps propagate their labels. Inference module, which mostly involves machine intelligence and automated computing over crowd labels, is an essential part of crowdsourcing system [7] to save on total expenditure.\nSuppose we are given labels for few HITs l(h), ∀h ∈ Q ⊂ H and we would like to additionally infer labels for other HITs using the available coupling constraints. As a first approach, we could obtain logical closure over first-order rules and available evidence using deterministic enumeration technique. But, as we want to highlight, our setting addresses much richer multi-relational structure, where two HIT nodes from ECG could interact in multiple ways with varying strengths, hence requiring transition to probabilistic truth values of fact. The probabilistic nature is also apparent in crowdsourcing techniques due to inherent noise in worker responses. These reasons motivate us to retain soft truth values of tasks while making all calculations.\nWe use Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL)3 [8], as our inference engine, to implement propagation of evaluation labels. PSL is a declarative language to reason uncertainty in relational domains via first order logic statements. One of the motivations to use PSL as our evaluation propagation mechanism is that it relaxes boolean truth values over H to continuous soft values in interval [0,1], unlike discrete binary Markov Logic Networks [35].\nThe first order rules are relaxed to their soft truth values and propagation is done by finding the most likely explanation over evidences. To get a sense of soft truthness over binary, the conjunction logical operator of first-order coupling constraints are converted to R using Lukaseiwicz t-norms; for instance, (a ∧ b → max{0,a+b-1}). Using these norm relaxations, we further define potential function ψj , corresponding to each coupling constraint node Cj in ECG. For\n3 http://www.psl.umiacs.umd.edu\nexample C5 mentioned earlier will translate to, ψj(C5) = ( max{0, hx + hy − 1− hw} )p\n(2)\nwhere C5 = hx ∧ hy → hw and hx denotes the evaluation score associated with the label of HIT (Joe Louis Arena, homeStadiumOf, Red Wings), hy corresponds to (Red Wings, homeCity, Detroit) and hw for (Joe Louis Arena, locatedInCity, Detroit). We can choose p ∈ {1, 2} for penalizing constraint violations either linearly or squared (less for small and high for larger violations). In a soft sense, ψj denotes the degree of satisfaction of constraint Cj . Higher value of ψj represent lower fit for Cj .\nThe probability distribution over all possible assignments of evaluation to I(G,Q,Θ) is structured such that the ones which satisfy more coupling constraints from C are more probable. Essentially, for any permutation of labels l ( I(G,Q,Θ) ) , this assignment is made through most probable explanation of density function given by\nP ( l ( I(G,Q,Θ) )) = 1\nZ exp [ − |C|∑ j=1 θjψj ( I(G,Q,Θ) )] (3)\nwhere Z is normalizing constant and ψj ’s correspond to above potential functions. Optimization technique searches for the most likely explanation of this joint probability distribution over all HITs hi ∈ I(G,Q,Θ) by maximum aposteriori inference. Formally, the final assignment of labels to HITs is obtained by solving the following optimization problem\nlMAP ( IMAP (G,Q,Θ) ) = arg max I(G,Q,Θ) P ( l ( I(G,Q,Θ) )) In our experiment, to calculate the accuracy of knowledge graph, it is essential to find the total number of correct beliefs against incorrect ones. We threshold these soft label values to distinguish true from false beliefs i.e., (lMAP (h) ≥ threshold)→ (lg(h) = lMAP (h)).\nHence, given initial evaluation labels of HITs in Q, we can use above PSL-based inference mechanism and help propagate their values to a larger set of I(G,Q,Θ)."

      "text" : "In the discussion so far, we have not addressed the issue that the labels provided by crowd workers may be noisy. Hence, one has to redundantly post the same task to multiple workers and estimate its accuracy by aggregating all responses. In this section, we provide upper bounds on the number of workers which should evaluate a given HIT.\nWe make a rational assumption here, which is also widely adopted in the literature, that workers’ response reflect their true opinions and noise might be attributed to innocent mistakes or lack of specific expertise. Here, we do not account for strategic workers who might collude and deliberately spam. This assumption, together with the widely accepted notion of ‘wisdom of crowds’, leads us to a stronger conclusion that expectation over the responses rh(u) for a task h by worker set {u} is closer to gold truth Gh [40]. Formally,∣∣∣∣ED(h,u)(rh(u))−Gh∣∣∣∣ ≤ 12 (4) with respect to distribution D of workers and tasks. We employ majority voting to aggregate and deduce the answer r̂h for task h.\nWhile allocating budget for redundant tasks, we want to be more certain about those HITs h which have larger inferable set |I(G,Q ∪ {h},Θ)| and hence post them to more workers. The rationale is to be more confident about tasks which directly impact larger subset of remaining HITs. Earlier works have considered allocation of workers to varyingcost model [40], but are not directly applicable in this setting due to our preference bias for few tasks over others. We divide the entire budget B among T tasks {h1, . . . hT } and determine the number of workers {nh1 , . . . , nhT } for each task such that ht’s with larger inference set I(G,Q∪ht,Θ) have higher nht . Suppose, the cardinality of set I(G,Q ∪ ht,Θ) is given by it and the cost of querying each task is c, then\nwe allocate nht = ⌊B it (1−γ)\nc imax\n⌋ where imax is the size of\nlargest inferable set and γ is constant. The residual budget Br = B − c ∑T j=1 nht , can be further distributed by assigning nht = nht + 1 ∀t ∈ {1 . . . T} to tasks iteratively until budget exhausts. The following theorem theoretically bounds the errors with such allocation scheme. Detailed proof is in Section 9.\nTheorem 3 For a task ht, the allocation scheme in Section 4 of redundantly posing it to nht workers does not exceed the total budget B and its expected estimation error is upper bounded by e−O(it), while the rest of the parameters are fixed. The expected estimation error over all tasks is upper bounded by e−O(B)."

This initial evidence helps PSL learn posterior for rule weights and tune specific parameters. In absence of seed set, we can generate S by randomly sampling few HITs from distribution.

In order to compare the runtime performance of RelCrowd with PSL and MLN as inference engines, respective; we experimented with a subset of the NELL dataset with 1860 HITs and 130 constraints. While the PSL engine took only 320 seconds, the MLN implementation6 took considerably more time and it didn’t even complete the graph grounding step even after 7 hours. This justifies out choice of PSL as the inference engine for RelCrowd.\nParallelism: Computing I(G,Q,Θ) for varying Q involves solving independent optimization function. The greedy step, which is also the most computationally intensive step, can easily be parallelized by distributing calculation of I(G,Q∪ hi,Θ) among i different computing nodes. The final aggregator node selects arg maxi |I(G,Q∪ hi,Θ)|.\nComputational Optimization: Grounding of all firstorder logic rules and maximizing their posterior probabilities, as in Equation (3), is computationally expensive. PSL inference engine uses Java implementation of hinge-loss Markov random fields (hl-mrf) to find the most probable explanation[4]. It also uses relational database for efficient retrieval during rule grounding [8].\nQuick-RelCrowd: Running the inference engine (PSL) over all remaining HITs to find the best greedy candidate may not be computationally feasible, especially in case of large G. One can resort to reduction in the search space over a smaller set H′. The expectation from H′ is that it should contain the best HIT, i.e., h∗ ∈ H′, and one can further distinguish h∗ by explicit iterations of PSL over H′. We observed that HITs connected to higher number of unfulfilled constraints in ECG propose suitable candidates for H′, where unfulfilled constraints are those Ck’s which have at least one adjacent HIT hk /∈ I(G,Q,Θ). We also experimentally validated this heuristic by varying size of reduced space to |H′| ∈ {1, 3, 5}, which caused only negligible change in performance of baselines, indicating that the heuristic is indeed effective and stable."

      "heading" : "6. RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Most of the previous work on evaluation of large scale KGs has resorted to random sampling, whereas crowdsourcing research has typically considered atomic allocation of tasks wherein the requester posted HITs independently. In estimating the accuracy of knowledge bases through crowdsourcing, we find the task of knowledge corroboration [19] to be closely aligned with our motivations. This work proposes probabilistic model to utilize a fixed set of basic first-order logic rules for label propagation. However, unlike RelCrowd, it does not look into the budget feasibility aspect and does not try to reduce upon the number of queries to crowdsource.\nMost of the other research efforts along this line have gone into modeling individual workers and minimizing their required redundancy. They are mainly focused on getting a better hold on user’s behavior and use it to further get better estimates of gold truth [41]. Recent improvements use Bayesian techniques [17, 36] for predicting accuracy of classification type HITs, but they operate in much simpler atomic\n6pyLMN: http://ias.cs.tum.edu/people/jain/mlns\nsetting. None of them relate the outputs of HITs to one another and do not capture the relational complexities of our Relational Crowdsourcing.\nThere have been models named Find-Fix-Verify which break large complex tasks, such as editing erroneous text, into modular chunks of simpler HITs and deal with these three inter-dependent tasks [5, 18]. The kind of inter-dependency among the three micro-tasks is very specific in the sense that output of previous stage goes as input to the next stage and cost analysis, workers Allocation and performance bounds over this model are done [39]. Our model transcends this restrictive linear dependence and is more flexible/natural. Decision theoretic approaches on constrained workflows have been employed to obtain high quality output for minimum allocated resources [23, 7]. Crowdsourcing tasks, like collective itinerary planning [42, 28], involves handling tasks with global constraints, but our notion of inter-dependence is again very different as compared to above model More recent work on construction of hierarchy over domain concepts [38], top-k querying over noisy crowd data [2], multi-label image annotation from crowd [11, 9] involve crowdsourcing over dependent HITs but their goals and methods vary largely from ours.\nOur model significantly differs from previous works in marketing theory [13], outbreak detection [27] and social network analysis [20] etc., as it operates over multi-relational modes of inference and not just singular way of connecting two entities.\nWork on budget sensitive algorithm [18, 3, 40] provides performance guarantees over several cost models, but do not account for any inter-relation among tasks.\nIn large scale crowdsourcing, recent works have highlighted case for active learning [32]. However, unlike our selection based on relational dependence at instance level tasks, active learning selection is based upon ranking generated over classifiers."

      "text" : "In this paper we have introduced Relational Crowdsourcing (RelCrowd), a novel framework for crowdsourcing multirelational data. RelCrowd is aimed at settings where the number of potential HITs far exceed what can be accommodated within available budget. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such framework of its kind. We demonstrated that the objective optimized by RelCrowd is in fact NP-Hard and submodular, and hence allowing for the application of greedy algorithms with approximation guarantees. Through extensive experiments on real datasets, we successfully demonstrated RelCrowd’s application to the important problem of knowledge graph evaluation. As part of future work, we hope to extend RelCrowd to incorporate varying cost, and more sophisticated evaluation aggregation. Also, we hope to apply the model to other structurally rich environments."

Both submodular and regular properties are found to be in accord with each other and the equivalence of regular energy functions and submodular set functions has been studied earlier in realms of image segmentation [22, 16].\nProof For Theorem 1. By construction, the Evaluation Coupling Graph G = (H ∪ C, E) is conducting, in the sense that any two HITs which share a common factor node Cj are encouraged to have similar labels. Each ψj of Equation (3) is a conducting potential function and also satisfies regularity property of Equation (5), making it submodular for a given Q. As θj ≥ 0, using standard non-negative summation properties of submodularity [29], we can show that∑ j∈C θjψj is also submodular. We consider a HIT h to be confidently inferred when the soft score of its label assignment in I(G,Q,Θ) is greater than some threshold ρh ∈ [0, 1], i.e P (l(h)|Q) ≥ ρh. Choice\nof random ρh mimics the uncertainty associated in quantifying exact dependence of HITs on each other. The label assignment made through most probable explanation of\nP ( l(h) ) = 1\nZ exp [ − |C′|∑ j=1 θjψj ( h, h′ )] ≥ ρh\nwhere C′ is the reduced constraint set which is active over h and h′ are HITs sharing C′ with h.\nWe now know that P (l(h)|Q) is submodular with respect to fixed initial set Q. However we are interested in global selection of Q in the first place which maximizes the objective of Equation (1). Although max or min of submodular functions are not submodular in general, but [20] conjectured that global function of Equation (1) is submodular if local threshold function P (h|Q) ≥ ρh respected submodularity, which holds good in our case of Equation (3). This conjecture was further proved in [31] and thus making our global optimization function of Equation (1) submodular.\nProof For Theorem 2. This can be proved by showing that NP-complete Set-cover Problem (SCP) is a special case of RelCrowd-KGE and that it can be reduced to selection of Q which covers I(G,Q,Θ). From the above discussions note that for any fixed (Q, C), PSL gives us a definitive way of creating inferable sets.\nFor the proof to remain consistent with earlier notations, we define SCP by collection of subsets I1, I2, . . . , Im from set H = {h1, h2, . . . , hn} and we want to determine if there exist k subsets whose union equals H. Without loss of generality assume that optimal solution has k 6= m and for all practical purposes k < n < m. We define a bipartite graph with m + n nodes corresponding to Ii’s and hj ’s respectively and construct edge (Ii, hj) if hj ∈ Ii. SCP can help us decide if there is a set Q, with cardinality k, such that |I(G,Q,Θ)| ≥ n+ k.\nChoosing our hit-set Q as per the solution proposed by SCP, posting them to the crowd and further infer the evaluations of other remaining HITs using PSL solves our knowledge graph evaluation (KGE) problem in hand.\nProof For Theorem 3. Allocating nht redundant workers for each task ht, ∀t ∈ {1 · · ·T} with size of inferable set it, we incur cost of\nT∑ t=1 c nht = T∑ t=1 B it (1− γ) c imax · c\n= ( T∑ t=1 it ) · ( B (1− γ) imax )\nFor greedy control mechanism, i1 = imax. Suppose we approximate the reduction in size of inferable set by a diminishing factor of γ ∈ (0, 1) i.e it+1 = γ it.\n=\n( imax (1− γT )\n(1− γ) ) · ( B (1− γ) imax ) ≤ B\nNote that the above geometric approximation, which practically holds true when decaying is averaged over few time steps, helps in getting an estimate of ∑T t=1 it at iteration t ≤ T . Such approximation would not be possible unless we already ran the entire experiment. For practical implementation, we can use an educated guess of γ = 1− imax\navgt(it) ."

Estimating accuracy of such automatically constructed KGs is a challenging problem due to their size and diversity. Even though crowdsourcing is an obvious choice for such evaluation, the standard single-task crowdsourcing, where each predicate in the KG is evaluated independently, is very expensive and especially problematic if the budget available is limited. We show that such approaches are sub-optimal as they ignore dependencies among various predicates and their instances. To overcome this challenge, we propose Relational Crowdsourcing (RelCrowd), where the tasks are created while taking dependencies among predicates and instances into account. We apply this framework in the context of evaluation of large-scale KGs and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on real-world datasets.",
