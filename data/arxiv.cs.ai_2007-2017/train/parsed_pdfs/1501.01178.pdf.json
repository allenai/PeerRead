      "text" : "In AI in general and in data mining in particular, there is an increasing interest in developing general methods for data analysis. In order to be useful, such methods should be easy to extend with domain-specific knowledge.\nIn pattern mining, the frequent sequence mining problem has already been studied in depth, but usually with a focus on efficiency and less on generality and extensibility. An important step in the development of more general approaches was the cSpade algorithm [19] which supports a variety constraints. It supports many constraints such as constraints on the length of the pattern, on the maximum gap in embeddings or on the discriminative power of the patterns between datasets. Many other constraints have been integrated into specific mining algorithms (e.g. [6,17,16,13]). However, none of these are truly generic in that adding extra constraints usually amounts to changing the data-structures used in the core of the algorithm.\n? This paper is published at CPAIOR 2015, this arxiv version additionally has an appendix.\nar X\niv :1\n50 1.\n01 17\n8v 3\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 5\nFe b\nFor itemset mining, the simplest form of pattern mining, it has been shown that constraint programming (CP) can be used as a generic framework for constraint-based mining [5] and beyond [14,11]. Recent works have also investigated the usage of CP-based approaches for mining sequences with explicit wildcards [3,7,8]. A wildcard represents the presence of exactly one arbitrary symbol in that position in the sequence.\nThe main difference between mining itemsets, sequences with wildcards and standard sequences lies in the complexity of testing whether a pattern is included in another itemset/sequence, e.g. from the database. For itemsets, this is simply testing the subset inclusion relation which is easy to encode in CP. For sequences with wildcards and general sequences, one has to check whether an embedding exists (matching of the individual symbols). But in case only few embeddings are possible, as in sequences with explicit wildcards, this can be done with a disjunctive constraint over all possible embeddings [8]. In general sequence (the setting we address in this paper), a pattern of size m can be embedded into a sequence of size n in O(nm) different ways, hence prohibiting a direct encoding or enumeration.\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows:\n– We present four categories of user-constraints, this categorization will be useful to compare the generality of the two proposed models. – We introduce an exists-embedding global constraint for sequences, and show the relation to projected databases and projected frequency used in the sequence mining literature to speedup the mining process [6,20]. – We propose a more general formulation using a decomposition of the exists-embedding constraint. Searching whether an embedding exists for each transaction is not easily expressed in CP and requires a modified search procedure. – We investigating the effect of adding constraints, and compare our method with state-of-the-art sequence mining algorithms.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 formally introduces the sequence mining problem and the constraint categories. Section 3 explains the basics of encoding sequence mining in CP. Section 4 and 5 present the model with the global constraint and the decomposition respectively. Section 6 presents the experiments. After an overview of related work (Section 7), we discuss the proposed approach and results in Section 8."

      "text" : "Sequence mining [1] can be seen as a variation of the well-known itemset mining problem proposed in [2]. In itemset mining, one is given a set of transactions, where each transaction is a set of items, and the goal is to find patterns (i.e. sets of items) that are included in a large number of transactions. In sequence mining, the problem is similar except that both transactions and patterns are ordered, (i.e. they are sequences instead of sets) and symbols can be repeated. For example, 〈b, a, c,b〉 and 〈a, c, c,b,b〉 are two sequences, and the sequence 〈a,b〉 is one possible pattern included in both.\nThis problem is known in the literature under multiple names, such as embedded subsequence mining, sequential pattern mining, flexible motif mining, or serial episode mining depending on the application."

      "text" : "A key concept of any pattern mining setting is the pattern inclusion relation. In sequence mining, a pattern is included in a transaction if there exists an embedding of that sequence in the transaction; where an embedding is a mapping of every symbol in the pattern to the same symbol in the transaction such that the order is respected.\nDefinition 1 (Embedding in a sequence). Let S = 〈s1, . . . , sm〉 and S′ = 〈s′1, . . . , s′n〉 be two sequences of size m and n respectively with m ≤ n. The tuple of integers e = (e1, . . . , em) is an embedding of S in S′ (denoted S ve S′) if and only if:\nS ve S′ ↔ e1 < . . . < em and ∀i ∈ 1, . . . ,m : si = s′ei (1)\nFor example, let S = 〈a,b〉 be a pattern, then (2, 4) is an embedding of S in 〈b, a, c,b〉 and (1, 4), (1, 5) are both embeddings of S in 〈a, c, c,b,b〉. An alternative setting considers sequences of itemsets instead of sequences of individual symbols. In this case, the definition is S ve S′ ↔ e1 < . . . < en and ∀i ∈ 1, . . . , n : si ⊆ s′ei . We do not consider this setting further in this paper, though it is an obvious extension.\nWe can now define the sequence inclusion relation as follows:\nDefinition 2 (Inclusion relation for sequences). Given two sequences S and S′, S is included in S′ (denoted S v S′) if there exists an embedding e of S in S′:\nS v S′ ↔ ∃e s.t. S ve S′. (2)\nTo continue on the example above, S = 〈a,b〉 is included in both 〈b, a, c,b〉 and 〈a, c, c,b,b〉 but not in 〈c,b, a, a〉.\nDefinition 3 (Sequential dataset). Given an alphabet of symbolsΣ, a sequential dataset D is a multiset of sequences defined over symbols in Σ.\nEach sequence in D is called a transaction using the terminology from itemset mining. The number of transactions in D is denoted |D| and the sum of the lengths of every transaction in D is denoted ||D|| (||D|| = ∑|D| i=1 |Ti|). Furthermore, we use dataset as a shorthand for sequential dataset when it is clear from context. Given a dataset D = {Ti, . . . , Tn}, one can compute the cover of a sequence S as the set of all transactions Ti that contain S:\ncover(S,D) = {Ti ∈ D : S v Ti} (3)\nWe can now define frequent sequence mining, where the goal is to find all patterns that are frequent in the database; namely, the size of their cover is sufficiently large.\nDefinition 4 (Frequent sequence mining). Given:\n1. an alphabet Σ 2. a sequential dataset D = {T1, . . . , Tn} defined over Σ 3. a minimum frequency threshold θ,\nenumerate all sequences S such that |cover(S,D)| ≥ θ.\nIn large datasets, the number of frequent sequences is often too large to be analyzed by a human. Extra constraints can be added to extract fewer, but more relevant or interesting patterns. Many such constraints have been studied in the past."

      "text" : "Constraints typically capture background knowledge and are provided by the user. We identify four categories of constraints for sequence mining: 1) constraints over the pattern, 2) constraints over the cover set, 3) constraints over the inclusion relation and 4) preferences over the solution set.\nConstraints on the pattern These put restrictions on the structure of the pattern. Typical examples include size constraints or regular expression constraints. Size constraints: A size constraint is simply |S| ≷ α where ≷∈ {=, 6=, >,≥, <,≤} and α is a user-supplied threshold. It is used to discard small patterns. Item constraints: One can constrain a symbol t to surely be in the pattern: ∃s ∈ S : s = t; or that it can not appear in the pattern: ∀s ∈ S : s 6= t, or more complex logical expressions over the symbols in the pattern. Regular expression constraints: Let R be a regular expression over the vocabulary V and LR be the language of sequences recognised by R, then for any sequence pattern S over V , the match-regular constraint requires that S ∈ LR [6].\nConstraints on the cover set. The minimum frequency constraint |cover(S,D)| ≥ θ is the most common example of a constraint over the cover set. Alternatively, one can impose the maximum frequency constraint: |cover(S,D)| ≤ β Discriminating constraints: In case of multiple datasets, discriminating constraints require that patterns effectively distinguish the datasets from each other. Given two datasets D1 and D2, one can require that the ratio between the size of the cover of both is above a threshold: |cover(S,D1)||cover(S,D2)| ≥ α. Other examples include more statistical measures such as information gain and entropy [12].\nConstraints over the inclusion relation. The inclusion relation in definition 2 states that S v S′ ↔ ∃e s.t. S ve S′. Hence, an embedding of a pattern can match symbols that are far apart in the transaction. For example, the sequence 〈a, c〉 is embedded in the transaction 〈a,b,b,b, . . . ,b, c〉 independently of the distance between a and c in the transaction. This is undesirable when mining datasets with long transactions. The max-gap and max-span constraints [19] impose a restriction on the embedding, and hence on the inclusion relation. The max-gap constraint is satisfied on a transaction Ti if an embedding e maps every two consecutive symbols in S to symbols in Ti that are close to each-other: max-gapi(e) ⇔ ∀j ∈ 2..|Ti|, (ej − ej−1 − 1) ≤ γ. For example, the sequence 〈abc〉 is embedded in the transaction 〈adddbc〉 with a maximum gap of 3 whereas 〈ac〉 is not. The max-span constraint requires that the distance between the first and last position of the embedding of all transactions Ti is below a threshold γ: max-spani(e)⇔ e|Ti| − e1 + 1 ≤ γ.\nPreferences over the solution set. A pairwise preference over the solution set expresses that a pattern A is preferred over a pattern B. In [11] it was shown that condensed representations like closed, maximal and free patterns can be expressed as pairwise preference relations. Skypatterns [14] and multi-objective optimisation can also be seen as preference over patterns. As an example, let∆ be the set of all patterns; then, the set of all closed patterns is {S ∈ ∆|@S′ s.t. S @ S′ and cover(S,D) = cover(S′, D)}."

      "text" : "In constraint programming, problems are expressed as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), or a constraint optimisation problem (COP). A CSP X = (V,D,C) consists of a set of variables V , a finite domain D that defines for each variable v ∈ V the possible values that it can take, and a set of constraints C over the variables in V . A solution to a CSP is an assignment of each variable to a value from its domain such that all constraints are satisfied. A COP additionally consists of an optimisation criterion f(V ) that expresses the quality of the solution.\nThere is no restriction on what a constraint C can represent. Examples include logical constraints like X∧Y or X→ Y and mathematical constraints such as Z = X+Y etc. Each constraint has a corresponding propagator that ensures the constraint is satisfied during the search. Many global constraints have been proposed, such as alldifferent, which have a custom propagator that is often more efficient then if one would decompose that constraint in terms of simple logical or mathematical constraints. A final important concept used in this paper is that of reified constraints. A reified constraint is of the form B↔ C ′ where B is a Boolean variable which will be assigned to the truth value of constraint C ′. Reified constraints have their own propagator too.\nVariables and domains for modeling sequence mining. Modeling a problem as a CSP requires the definition of a set of variables with a finite domain, and a set of constraints. One solution to the CSP will correspond to one pattern, that is, one frequent sequence.\nWe model the problem using an array S of integer variables representing the characters of the sequence and an array C of Boolean variables representing which transactions include the pattern. This is illustrated in Fig. 1:\n1. T1 and T2 represent two transactions given as input. We denote the number of transactions by n; 2. The array of variables S represents the sequence pattern. Each variable Sj represents the character in the jth position of the sequence. The size of S is determined by the length of the longest transactions (in the example this is 4). We want to allow patterns that have fewer than maxi(|Ti) characters, hence we use to represent an unused position in S. The domain of each variable Sj is thus Σ ∪ { }; 3. Boolean variables Ci represent whether the pattern is included in transaction Ti, that is, whether S v Ti. In the example, this is the case for T1 but not for T2.\nWhat remains to be defined is the constraints. The key part here is how to model the inclusion relation; that is, the constraint that verifies whether a pattern is included in the\ntransaction. Conceptually, this is the following reified constraint: Ci ↔ ∃e s.t. S ve Ti. As mentioned in the introduction, the number of possible embeddings is exponential in the size of the pattern. Hence, one can not model this as a disjunctive constraint over all possible embeddings (as is done for sequences with explicit wildcards [8]).\nWe propose two approaches to cope with this problem: one with a global constraint that verifies the inclusion relation directly on the data, and one in which the inclusion relation is decomposed and the embedding is exposed through variables.\n4 Sequence mining with a global exists-embedding constraint\nThe model consists of three parts: encoding of the pattern, of the minimum frequency constraint and finally of the inclusion relation using a global constraint.\nVariable-length pattern: The array S has length k; patterns with l < k symbols are represented with l symbols from Σ and (k − l) times an value. To avoid enumerating the same pattern with values in different positions, values can only appear at the end:\n∀j ∈ 1..(k − 1) : Sj = → Sj+1 = (4)\nMinimum frequency: At least θ transactions should include the pattern. This inclusion is indicated by the array of Boolean variables C:\nn∑ i=1 Ci ≥ θ (5)\nGlobal exists-embedding constraint: The goal is to encode the relation: Ci ↔ ∃e s.t. S ve Ti. The propagator algorithm for this constraint is given in Algorithm 1. It is an incremental propagator that should be run when one of the S variables is assigned. Line 1 will loop over the variables in S until reaching an unassigned one at position posS . In the sequence mining literature, the sequence 〈S1..SposS〉 is called the prefix. For each assigned Sj variable, a matching element in the transaction is sought, starting from the position pose after the element that matched the previous Sj−1 assigned variable. If no such match is found then an embedding can not be found and Ci is set to false.\nLine 11 is called when an Sj variable is assigned to . This line can only be reached if all previous values of S are assigned and were matched in Ti, hence the propagator can set Ci to true and quit. Similarly for line 14 when the end of the sequence is reached, and lines 15-20 in case the transaction is smaller than the sequence. Lines 21- 22 propagate the remaining possible symbols from Ti to the first unassigned S variable in case Ci = True.\nThe propagator algorithm has complexity O(|Ti|): the loop on line 1 is run up to |Ti| times and on line 3 at most |Ti| times in total, as pose is monotonically increasing.\n4.1 Improved pruning with projected frequency\nCompared to specialised sequence mining algorithms, posS in Algorithm 1 points to the first position in S after the current prefix. Dually, pose points to the position after\nAlgorithm 1 Incremental propagator for Ci ↔ ∃e s.t.

If one would project the prefix away, only the symbols in the transaction from pose on would remain; this is known as prefix projection [6]. Given prefix 〈a, c〉 and transaction 〈b, a, a, e, c,b, c,b,b〉 the projected transaction is 〈b, c,b,b〉.\nThe concept of a prefix-projected database can be used to recompute the frequency of all symbols in the projected database. If a symbol is present but not frequent in the projected database, one can avoid searching over it. This is known to speed up specialised mining algorithms considerably [6,16].\nTo achieve this in the above model, we need to adapt the global propagator so that it exports the symbols that still appear after pose. We introduce an auxiliary integer variable Xi for every transaction Ti, whose domain represents these symbols (the set of symbols is monotonically decreasing). To avoid searching over infrequent symbols, we define a custom search routine (brancher) over the S variables. It first computes the local frequencies of all symbols based on the domains of the Xi variables; symbols that are locally infrequent will not not be branched over. See Appendix A for more details."

This constraint can be formalised as follows.\nk∑ j=1 [Sj 6= ] ≥ α (6)\nMinimum frequency in Equation (5) is an example of a constraint of type 2, over the cover set. Another example is the discriminative constraint mentioned in Section 2.2: given two datasets D1 and D2, one can require that the ratio between the cover in the two datasets is larger than a user defined threshold α: |cover(S,D1)||cover(S,D2)| ≥ α. Let D = D1 ∪ D2 and let t1 = {i|Ti ∈ D1} and t2 = {i|Ti ∈ D2} then we can extract the discriminant patterns from D by applying the following constraint.∑\ni∈t1 Ci∑ i∈t2 Ci ≥ α (7)\nSuch a constraint can also be used as an optimisation criterion in a CP framework. Type 4 constraints a.k.a. preference relations have been proposed in [11] to formalise well-known pattern mining settings such as maximal or closed patterns. Such preference relations can be enforced dynamically during search for any CP formulation [11]. The preference relation for closed is S′ S ⇐⇒ S @ S′ ∧ cover(S,D) = cover(S′, D) and one can reuse the global reified exists-embedding constraint for this.\nFinally, type 3 constraints over the inclusion relation are not possible in this model. Indeed, a new global constraint would have to be created for every possible (combination of) type 3 constraints. For example for max-gap, one would have to modify Algorithm 1 to check whether the gap is smaller than the threshold, and if not, to search for an alternative embedding instead (thereby changing the complexity of the algorithm)."

As for each sequence of size m, the number of embeddings in a transaction of size n can be O(nm), such a search would not perform well. Instead, we only need to search whether one embedding exists for each transaction.\nWith additional constraints on Eij but not Ci. When there are additional constraints on the Eij variables such as max-gap, one has to perform backtracking search to find a valid embedding. We do this after the S variables have been assigned.\nWe call the search over the S variables the normal search, and the search over the Eij variables the sub search. Observe that one can do the sub search for each transaction i independently of the other transactions as the different Ei have no influence on each other, only on Ci. Hence, one does not need to backtrack across different sub searchers.\nThe goal of a sub search for transaction i is to find a valid embedding for that transaction. Hence, that sub search should search for an assignment to the Eij variables with Ci set to true first. If a valid assignment is found, an embedding for Ti exists and the sub search can stop. If no assignment is found, Ci is set to false and the sub search can stop too. See Appendix C for more details on the sub search implementation.\nWith arbitrary constraints. The constraint formulation in Equation (10) is not equivalent to Ci ↔ ∃e s.t. S ve Ti. For example, lets say some arbitrary constraint propagates Ci to false. For the latter constraint, this would mean that it will enforce that S is such that there does not exists an embedding of it in Ti. In contrast, the constraint in Equation (10) will propagate some Eij to the no-match value, even if there exists a valid match for the respective Sj in Ti!\nTo avoid an Eij being set to the no-match value because of an assignment to Ci, we can replace Equation (10) by the half-reified ∀i : Ci → (∀j (Sj 6= ) → (Eij 6= |Ti|+ 1) ) during normal search.\nThe sub search then has to search for a valid embedding, even if Ci is set to false by some other constraint. One can do this in the sub search of a specific transaction i by replacing the respective half-reified constraint by the constraint C′i ↔ (∀j (Sj 6= )→ (Eij 6= |Ti|+1) ) over a new variable C′i that is local to this sub search. The sub search can then proceed as described above, by setting C′i to true and searching for a valid assignment to Ei. Consistency between C′i and the original Ci must only be checked after the sub search for transaction i is finished. This guarantees that for any solution found, if Ci is false and so is C′i then indeed, there exists no embedding of S in Ti."

Lower values for minsup result in larger solution sets, thus in larger execution times.\nExperiments: First we compare the global and the decomposed models. The execution times for these models are shown on Fig. 3, both without and with projected frequency (indicated by -p.f.). We first look at the impact of exposing the embedding variables in the decomposed model (Q1). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the global model is up to one order of magnitude faster than the decomposed model, which hasO(n∗k) extra variables. This is the overhead required to allow one to add constraints over the inclusion relation. We also study the impact of the projected frequency on both models (Q2). In the global model this is done as part of the search, while in the decomposed model this is achieved with an elaborate constraint formulation. For global-p.f. we always observe a speedup in Fig. 3. Not so for decomposed-p.f. for the two largest (in terms of ||D||) datasets.\nWe now evaluate the impact of user constraints on the number of results and on the execution time (Q3). Fig. 4 shows the number of patterns and the execution times for\n6 http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/\nvarious combinations of constraints. We can see that adding constraints enables users to control the explosion of the number of patterns, and that the execution times decrease accordingly. The constraint propagation allows early pruning of invalid solutions which effectively compensates the computation time of checking the constraints. For example, on the Unix user dataset, it is not feasible to mine for patterns at 5% minimum frequency without constraints, let alone do something with the millions of patterns found. On the other hand, by adding constraints one can look for interesting patterns at low frequency without being overwhelmed by the number of results (see also later).\nThe last experiment compares our models to existing algorithms. Fig. 5 shows the execution times for our global model compared with regular-dfa, PrefixSpan and cSpade (Q4). First, we can observe that regular-dfa is always slowest. On iPRG it performs reasonably well, but the number of transitions in the DFAs does not permit it to perform well on datasets with a large alphabet or large transactions, such as Unix user, JMLR or FIFA. Furthermore, it can not make use of projected frequencies.\nglobal shows similar, but much faster, behaviour than regular-dfa. On datasets with many symbols such as JMLR and FIFA, we can see that not using projected frequency is a serious drawback; indeed, global-p.f. performs much better than global there.\nOf the specialised algorithms, cSpade performs better than PrefixSpan; it is the most advanced algorithm and is the fastest in all experiments (not counting the highest frequency thresholds). global-p.f. has taken inspiration from PrefixSpan and we can see that they indeed behave similarly. Although, for the dense iPRG dataset PrefixSpan performs better than global-p.f. and inversely for the large and sparse FIFA dataset. This might be due to implementation choices in the CP solver and PrefixSpan software.\nAnalysis of the pattern quality Finally, we use our constraint-based framework to perform exploratory analysis of the Unix user datasets. Table 2 shows different settings we\ntried and patterns we found interesting. Few constraints lead to too many patterns while more constrained settings lead to fewer and more interesting patterns."

      "text" : "The idea of mining patterns in sequences dates from earlier work by Agrawal et al. [1] shortly after their well-known work on frequent itemset mining [2]. The problem introduced in [1] consisted of finding frequent sequences of itemsets; that is: sequences of sets included in a database of sequences of sets. Mining sequences of individual symbols was introduced later by [9]; the two problems are closely related and one can adapt one to the other [16]. Sequence mining was driven by the application of market basket analysis for customer data spread over multiple days. Other applications include bio-medical ones where a large number of DNA and protein sequence datasets are available (e.g. [18]), or natural language processing where sentences can be represented as sequences of words (e.g. [15]).\nSeveral specialised algorithm have addressed the problem of constrained sequence mining. The cSpade algorithm [19] for example is an extension of the Spade sequence mining algorithm [20] that supports constraints of type 1, 2 and 3. PrefixSpan [6] mentions regular expression constraints too. The LCMseq algorithm [13] also supports a range of constraints, but does not consider all embeddings during search. Other sequence mining algorithms have often focussed on constraints of type 4, and on closed sequence mining in particular. CloSpan [17] and Bide [16] are both extentions of Pre-\nfixSpan to mine closed frequent sequences. We could do the same in our CP approach by adding constraints after each solution found, following [11,8].\nDifferent flavors of sequence mining have been studied in the context of a generic framework, and constraint programming in particular. They all study constraints of type 1, 2 and 4. In [3] the setting of sequence patterns with explicit wildcards in a single sequence is studied: such a pattern has a linear number of embeddings. As only a single sequence is considered, frequency is defined as the number of embeddings in that sequence, leading to a similar encoding to itemsets. This is extended in [7] to sequences of itemsets (with explicit wildcards over a single sequence). [8] also studies patterns with explicit wildcards, but in a database of sequences. Finally, [10] considers standard sequences in a database, just like this paper; they also support constraints of type 3. The main difference is in the use of a costly encoding of the inclusion relation using non-deterministic automata and the inherent inability to use projected frequency."

      "heading" : "8 Conclusion and discussion",
      "text" : "We have investigated a generic framework for sequence mining, based on constraint programming. The difficulty, compared to itemsets and sequences with explicit wildcards, is that the number of embeddings can be huge, while knowing that one embedding exists is sufficient.\nWe proposed two models for the sequence mining problem: one in which the existsembedding relation is captured in a global constraint. The benefit is that the complexity of dealing with the existential check is hidden in the constraint. The downside is that modifying the inclusion relation requires modifying the global constraint; it is hence not generic towards such constraints. We were able to use the same projected frequency technique as well-studied algorithms such as PrefixSpan [6], by altering the global exists-embedding constraint and using a specialised search strategy. Doing this does amount to implementing specific propagators and search strategies into a CP solver, making the problem formulation not applicable to other solvers out-of-the-box. On the other hand, it allows for significant efficiency gains.\nThe second model exposes the actual embedding through variables, allowing for more constraints and making it as generic as can be. However, it has extra overhead and requires a custom two-phased search strategy.\nOur observations are not just limited to sequence mining. Other pattern mining tasks such as tree or graph mining also have multiple (and many) embeddings, hence they will also face the same issues with a reified exists relation. Whether a general framework exists for all such pattern mining problems is an open question."

      "heading" : "B Decomposition with explicit embedding variables, modeling details",
      "text" : "The decomposition consists of two constraints: the position-match constraint and the is-embedding constraint.\nposition-match formulation, part 1 The first constraint needed to enforce position-match is formally defined as follows:\n∀i ∈ 1, . . . , n, ∀j ∈ 1, . . . , |Ti| : (Sj = Ti[Eij]) ∨ (Eij = |Ti|+ 1) (14)\nInstead of modeling this with a reified element constraint, we can decompose the element constraint over all values in Eij except the no-match value |Ti|+ 1:\n∀i ∈ 1, . . . , n, ∀j ∈ 1, . . . , |Ti|,∀x ∈ 1 . . . |Ti| : Eij = x→ Sj = Ti[x] (15)\nObserve that in the above formulation Ti[x] is a constant, so the reified Sj = v expressions can be shared for all unique values of v ∈ Σ.\nFurthermore, using half-reified constraints we need only one auxiliary variable for both Eij = x → B and B → Sj = s, where the latter can be shared for all unique values of s ∈ Σ. This leads to O(n · k · k) half-reified constraints of the former type and O(k · k) auxiliary variables and half-reified constraints of the latter type, with k = maxi(|Ti|).\nposition-match formulation, part 2 The second constraint needed to enforce position-match is:\n∀i ∈ 1, . . . , n, ∀j ∈ 2, . . . , |Ti| : (Ei(j−1) < Eij) ∨ (Eij = |Ti|+ 1) (16)\nFormulating this in CP would not perform any propagation until |Ti|+1 is removed from the domain of Eij. However, one can see that the lower-bound on Ei(j−1), when not equal to |Ti|+ 1, can be propagated to the lower-bound of Eij.\nConsider the following example: let S = [{B,C, }, {A,B,C, }, {A,B,C, }] and T1 = [A,B,C] then k = 3 and D(E1) = {2, 3, 4}, D(E2) = {2, 3, 4}, D(E3) = {2, 3, 4}. However, because min(D(E1)) = 2 we know that E2 6= 2 and similar for E3. This leads to E3 = {4}, from which the is-embedding propagator can derive that there is no embedding of the pattern in T1. This is a quite common situation.\nThis propagation can be obtained with the following decomposition over all elements of the domain (except |Ti|+ 1):\n∀i ∈ 1 . . . n,∀j ∈ 1 . . . |Ti| − 1,∀x ∈ 1 . . . |Ti| : (Eij+1 = x)→ (Eij < x) (17)\nHowever, this would require in the order O(n · k2) reified constraints and auxiliary variables.\nInstead, we use a simple modification of the binary inequality propagator X < Y that achieves the same required result. This propagator always propagates the lowerbound of X to Y , and as soon as |Ti| + 1 /∈ Y it propagates like a standard X < Y propagator.\nThere are O(n · k) such constraints needed and no auxiliary variables.\nis-embedding formulation The constraint is the following:\n∀i ∈ 1, . . . , n : Ci ↔ ∀j ∈ 1, . . . , |Ti| : (Sj 6= )→ (Eij 6= |Ti|+ 1) (18)\nAcross all transactions, the reified Sj 6= expressions can be shared. O(n · k) such constraints and auxiliary variables are needed in total. For each transaction, the forall requires |Ti| times 2 auxiliary variables, one for reifying Eij 6= |Ti| + 1 and one for reifying the implication. This leads to an additional O(n · k) auxiliary variables and constraints, plus n reified conjunction constraints."

We then force the sub-search to only search over Ci and Ei, such that an assignment for Ci =true is found first, if it exists. By removing all branchers at the start of loop, the next transaction’s sub-search will not reconsider branching choices made in the previous sub-search.\nAs the master problem should not branch over any of the sub-search choices either, we merge all the assignments found by the sub-searches and present this as the only branch-choice for the master problem.\nUsing this sub-search-brancher, for each Ti for which an embedding of S in Ti exists, Ci will be true. Only if no such embedding exists will Ci be false. This is the required behaviour for our constraint formulation."

Many constraints have been proposed in the literature, but a general framework is still missing. We investigate the use of constraint programming as general framework for this task. We first identify four categories of constraints that are applicable to sequence mining. We then propose two constraint programming formulations. The first formulation introduces a new global constraint called exists-embedding. This formulation is the most efficient but does not support one type of constraint. To support such constraints, we develop a second formulation that is more general but incurs more overhead. Both formulations can use the projected database technique used in specialised algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the flexibility towards constraint-based settings and compare the approach to existing methods.",
