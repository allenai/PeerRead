      "text" : "Abstractive summarization aims to generate a shorter version of the document covering all the salient points in a compact and coherent fashion. On the other hand, query-based summarization highlights those points that are relevant in the context of a given query. The encodeattend-decode paradigm has achieved notable success in machine translation, extractive summarization, dialog systems, etc. But it suffers from the drawback of generation of repeated phrases. In this work we propose a model for the query-based summarization task based on the encode-attend-decode paradigm with two key additions (i) a query attention model (in addition to document attention model) which learns to focus on different portions of the query at different time steps (instead of using a static representation for the query) and (ii) a new diversity based attention model which aims to alleviate the problem of repeating phrases in the summary. In order to enable the testing of this model we introduce a new query-based summarization dataset building on debatepedia. Our experiments show that with these two additions the proposed model clearly outperforms vanilla encode-attend-decode models with a gain of 28% (absolute) in ROUGE-L scores."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Over the past few years neural models based on the encode-attend-decode (Bahdanau et al.,\n2014) paradigm have shown great success in various natural language generation (NLG) tasks such as machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014), abstractive summarization ((Rush et al., 2015),(Nallapati et al., 2016)) dialog (Li et al., 2016), etc. One such NLG problem which has not received enough attention in the past is query based abstractive text summarization where the aim is to generate the summary of a document in the context of a query. In general, abstractive summarization, aims to cover all the salient points of a document in a compact and coherent fashion. On the other hand, query focused summarization highlights those points that are relevant in the context of the query. Thus given a document on “the super bowl”, the query “How was the half-time show?”, would result in a summary that would not cover the actual game itself.\nNote that there has been some work on query based extractive summarization in the past where the aim is to simply extract the most salient sentence(s) from a document and treat these as a summary. There is no natural language generation involved. Since, we were interested in abstractive (as opposed to extractive) summarization we created a new dataset based on debatepedia. This dataset contains triplets of the form (query, document, summary). Further, each summary is abstractive and not extractive in the sense that the summary does not necessarily comprise of a sentence which is simply copied from the original document.\nUsing this dataset as a testbed, we focus on a recurring problem in models based on the encode-attend-decode paradigm. Specifically, it is observed that the summaries produced by such models contain repeated phrases. Table 1 shows a few such examples of summaries gener-\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n08 30\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n6 A\npr 2\n01 7\nated by such a model when trained on this new dataset. This problem has also been reported by (Chen et al., 2016) in the context of summarization and by (Sankaran et al., 2016) in the context of machine translation.\nWe first provide an intuitive explanation for this problem and then propose a solution for alleviating it. A typical encode-attend-decode model first computes a vectorial representation for the document and the query and then produces a contextual summary one word at a time. Each word is produced by feeding a new context vector to the decoder at each time step by attending to different parts of the document and query. If the decoder produces the same word or phrase repeatedly then it could mean that the context vectors fed to the decoder at these time steps are very similar.\nWe propose a model which explicitly prevents this by ensuring that successive context vectors are orthogonal to each other. Specifically, we subtract out any component that the\ncurrent context vector has in the direction of the previous context vector. Notice that, we do not require the current context vector to be orthogonal to all previous context vectors but just its immediate predecessor. This enables the model to attend to words repeatedly if required later in the process. To account for the complete history (or all previous context vectors) we also propose an extension of this idea where we pass the sequence of context vectors through a LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and ensure that the current state produced by the LSTM is orthogonal to the history. At each time step, the state of the LSTM is then fed to the decoder to produce one word in the summary.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows: (i) We propose a new dataset for query based abstractive summarization and evaluate encode-attend-decode models on this dataset (ii) We study the problem of repeating phrases in NLG in the context of this dataset and propose two solutions for countering this problem. We show that our method outperforms a vanilla encoder-decoder model with a gain of 28% (absolute) in ROUGE-L score (iii) We also demonstrate that our method clearly outperforms a recent state of the art method proposed for handling the problem of repeating phrases with a gain of 7% (absolute) in ROUGE-L scores (iv) We do a qualitative analysis of the results and show that our model indeed produces outputs with fewer repetitions."

      "text" : "Summarization has been studied in the context of text ((Mani, 2001), (Das and Martins, 2007), (Nenkova and McKeown, 2012)) as well as speech ((Zhu and Penn, 2006), (Zhu et al., 2009)). A vast majority of this work has focused on extractive summarization where the idea is to construct a summary by selecting the most relevant sentences from the document ((Neto et al., 2002), (Erkan and Radev, 2004), (Filippova and Altun, 2013), (Colmenares et al., 2015), (Riedhammer et al., 2010), (Ribeiro et al., 2013)). There has been some work on abstractive summarization in the context of DUC-2003 and DUC-2004 contests (Zajic et al.). We refer the reader to (Das and Martins, 2007) and (Nenkova and McKeown, 2012) for an excellent survey of\nthe field. Recent research in abstractive summarization has focused on data driven neural models based on the encode-attend-decode paradigm (Bahdanau et al., 2014). For example, (Rush et al., 2015), report state of the art results on the GigaWord and DUC corpus using such a model. Similarly, the work of Lopyrev (2015) uses neural networks to generate news headline from short news stories. Chopra et al. (2016) extend the work of Rush et al. (2015) and report further improvements on the two datasets. Hu et al. (2015) introduced a dataset for Chinese short text summarization and evaluated a similar RNN encoder-decoder model on it.\nOne recurring problem in encoder-decoder models for NLG is that they often repeat the same phrase/word multiple times in the summary (at the cost of both coherency and fluency). Sankaran et al. (2016) study this problem in the context of MT and propose a temporal attention model which enforces the attention weights for successive time steps to be different from each other. Similarly, and more relevant to this work, Chen et al. (2016) propose a distraction based attention model which maintains a history of attention vectors and context vectors. It then subtracts this history from the current attention and context vector. When evaluated on our dataset their method performs poorly. This could be because their method is very aggressive in dealing with the history (as explained later in the Experiments section). On the other hand, our method has a better way of handling history (by passing context vectors through an LSTM recurrent network) which gives us the flexibility to forget/retain some portions of the history and at the same time produce diverse context vectors at successive time steps.\nWe evaluate our method in the context of query based abstractive summarization - a problem which has received almost no attention in the past due to unavailability of datasets. We create a new dataset for this task and show that our method indeed produces better output by reducing the number of repeated phrases produced by encoder decoder models."

      "text" : "As mentioned earlier, there are no existing datasets for query based abstractive summarization. We create such a dataset from Debatepedia an encyclopedia of pro and con arguments and quotes on critical debate topics. There are 663 debates in the corpus (we have considered only those debates which have at least one query with one document). These 663 debates belong to 53 overlapping categories such as Politics, Law, Crime, Environment, Health, Morality, Religion, etc. A given topic can belong to more than one category. For example, the topic “Eye for an Eye philosophy” belongs to both “Law” as well as “Morality”. The average number of queries per debate is 5 and the average number of documents per query is 4. Please refer to the dataset url1 for more details about number of debates per category.\nFor example, Figure 1 shows the queries associated with the topic “Algae Biofuel”. It also lists the set of documents and an abstractive summary associated with each query. As is obvious from the example, the summary is an abstractive summary and not extracted directly from the document. We crawled 12695 such {query, document, summary} triples from debatepedia (these were all the triples that were available). Table 2 reports the average length of the query, summary and documents in this dataset.\nWe used 10 fold cross validation for all our experiments. Each fold uses 80% of the documents for training, 10% for validation and 10% for testing."

This can be modeled as the problem of finding a y∗ that maximizes the probability p(y|q,d) which can be further decomposed as:\ny∗ = argmax y m∏ t=1 p(yt|y1, ..., yt−1,q,d) (1)\nWe now describe a way of modeling p(yt|y1, ..., yt−1,q,d) using the neural encoderattention-decoder paradigm. The proposed model contains the following components: (i) an encoder RNN for the query (ii) an encoder RNN for the document (iii) attention mechanism for the query (iv) attention mechanism for the document and (v) a decoder RNN. All the RNNs use a GRU cell. Encoder for the query: We use a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for encoding the query. It reads the query q = q1, q2, ..., qk from left to right and computes a hidden representation for each time-step as:\nhqi = GRUq(h q i−1, e(qi)) (2)\nwhere e(qi) ∈ Rd is the d-dimensional embedding of the query word qi. Encoder for the document: This is similar to the query encoder and reads the document d = d1, d2, ..., dn from left to right and computes a hidden representation for each time-step as:\nhdi = GRUd(h d i−1, e(di)) (3)\nwhere e(di) ∈ Rd is the d-dimensional embedding of the document word di. Attention mechanism for the query : At each time step, the decoder produces an output word\nby focusing on different portions of the query (document) with the help of a query (document) attention model. We first describe the query attention model which assigns weights αqt,i to each word in the query at each decoder timestep using the following equations.\naqt,i = v T q tanh(Wqst + Uqh q i ) (4) αqt,i = exp(aqt,i)∑k j=1 exp(a q t,j) (5)\nwhere st is the current state of the decoder at time step t (we will see an exact formula for this soon). Wq ∈ Rl2×l1 , Uq ∈ Rl2×l2 , vq ∈ Rl2 , l1 is the size of the decoder’s hidden state, l2 is both the size of hqi and also the size of the final query representation at time step t, which is computed as:\nqt = k∑\ni=1\nαqt,ih q i (6)\nAttention mechanism for the document : We now describe the document attention model which assigns weights to each word in the document using the following equations.\nadt,i = v T d tanh(Wdst + Udh d i + Zqt) (7) αdt,i = exp(adt,i)∑n j=1 exp(a d t,j)\nwhere st is the current state of the decoder at time step t (we will see an exact formula for this\nsoon). Wd ∈ Rl4×l1 , Ud ∈ Rl4×l4 , Z ∈ Rl4×l2 , vd ∈ Rl2 , l4 is the size of hdi and also the size of the final document representation dt which is passed to the decoder at time step t as:\ndt = n∑\ni=1\nαdt,ih d i (8)\nNote that dt now encodes the relevant information from the document as well as the query (see Equation (7)) at time step t. We refer to this as the context vector for the decoder. Decoder: The hidden state of the decoder st at each time t is again computed using a GRU as follows:\nst = GRUdec(st−1, [e(yt−1), dt−1]) (9)\nwhere, yt−1 gives a distribution over the vocabulary words at timestep t − 1 and is computed as:\nyt = softmax(Wof(Wdecst + Vdecdt)) (10)\nwhere Wo ∈ RN×l1 , Wdec ∈ Rl1×l1 , Vdec ∈ Rl1×l4 , N is the vocabulary size, yt is the final output of the model which defines a probability distribution over the output vocabulary. This is exactly the quantity defined in Equation (1) that we wanted to model (p(yt|y1, ..., yt−1,q,d)). Further, note that, e(yt−1) is the d-dimensional embedding of the word which has the highest probability under the distribution yt−1. Also [e(yt−1), dt−1] means a concatenation of the vectors e(yt−1), dt−1. We chose f to be the identity function.\nThe model as described above is an instantiation of the encoder-attention-decoder idea applied to query based abstractive summarization. As mentioned earlier (and demonstrated later through experiments), this model suffers from the problem of repeating the same phrase/word in the output. We now propose a new attention model which we refer to as diversity based attention model to address this problem."

      "text" : "As hypothesized earlier, if the decoder produces the same phrase/word multiple times then it is possible that the context vectors being fed to the decoder at consecutive time steps are\nvery similar. We propose four models (D1, D2, SD1, SD2) to directly address this problem. D1: In this model, after computing dt as described in Equation (8), we make it orthogonal to the context vector at time t− 1:\nd ′ t = dt − dTt d\n′ t−1\nd ′T t−1d ′ t−1\nd ′\nt−1 (11)\nSD1: The above model imposes a hard orthogonality constraint on the context vector(d\n′ t).\nWe also propose a relaxed version of the above model which uses a gating parameter. This gating parameter decides what fraction of the previous context vector should be subtracted from the current context vector using the following equations:\nγt = Wgdt−1 + bg\nd ′ t = dt − γt dTt d\n′ t−1\nd ′T t−1d ′ t−1\nd ′\nt−1\nwhere Wg ∈ Rl4×l4 , bg ∈ Rl4 , l4 is the dimension of dt as defined in equation (8). D2: The above model only ensures that the current context vector is diverse w.r.t the previous context vector. It ignores all history before time step t − 1. To account for the history, we treat successive context vectors as a sequence and use\na modified LSTM cell to compute the new state at each time step. Specifically, we use the following set of equations to compute a diverse context at time t:\nit = σ(Widt + Uiht−1 + bi)\nft = σ(Wfdt + Ufht−1 + bf )\not = σ(Wodt + Uoht−1 + bo)\nĉt = tanh(Wcdt + Ucht−1 + bc)\nct = it ĉt + ft ct−1\ncdiverset = ct − ct T ct−1 cTt−1ct−1 ct−1 (12)\nht = ot tanh(cdiverset ) d ′\nt = ht (13)\nwhere Wi,Wf ,Wo,Wc ∈ Rl5×l4 , Ui, Uf , Uo, Uc ∈ Rl5×l4 , dt is the l4dimensional output of Equation (8); l5 is number of hidden units in the LSTM cell. This final d\n′ t from Equation (13) is then used in\nEquation (9). Note that Equation (12) ensures that state of the LSTM at time step t is orthogonal to the previous history. Figure 3 shows a pictorial representation of the model with a diversity LSTM cell. SD2: This model again uses a relaxed version of the orthogonality constraint used in D2. Specifically, we define a gating parameter gt and replace (12) above by (14) as define below:\ngt = σ(Wgdt + Ught−1 + bo)\ncdiverset = ct − gt ct T ct−1 cTt−1ct−1 ct−1 (14)\nwhere Wg ∈ Rl5×l4 , Ug ∈ Rl5×l4"

Note that there are no prior baselines on query based abstractive summarization so we could only compare with different variations of the encoder decoder models as described above. Further, we compare our diversity based attention models with existing models for diversity by suitably adapting them to this problem as described earlier. Specifically, we compare the performance of the following models:\n• Vanilla e-a-d: This is the vanilla encoderattention-decoder model adapted to the problem of abstractive summarization. It contains the following components (i) document encoder (ii) document attention model (iii) decoder. It does not contain an encoder or attention model for the query.

We used Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) as the optimization algorithm with the initial learning rate set to 0.0004, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999. We used pre-trained publicly available Glove word embeddings2 and fine-tuned them during training.

      "heading" : "7 Discussions",
      "text" : "In this section, we discuss the results of the experiments reported in Table 3. 1. Effect of Query: Comparing rows 1 and 2 we observe that adding an encoder for the query and allowing it to influence the outputs of the decoder indeed improves the performance. This is expected as the query contains some keywords which could help in sharpening the focus of the summary. 2. Effect of Query attention model: Comparing rows 2 and 3 we observe that using an attention model to dynamically compute the query representation at each time step improves the results. This suggests that the attention model indeed learns to focus on relevant portions of the query at different time steps. 3. Effect of Diversity models: All the diversity models introduced in the paper (rows 7, 8, 9, 10) give significant improvement over the nondiversity models. In particular, the modified LSTM based diversity model gives the best results. This is indeed very encouraging and Table 4 shows some sample summaries comparing the performance of different models. 4. Comparison with baseline diversity models: The baseline diversity model M1 performs at par with our models D1 and SD1 but not as good as D2 and SD2. However, the model M2 performs very poorly. We believe that simultaneously adding a constraint on the context vectors as well as attention weights (as is indeed the case with M2) is a bit too aggressive and leads to poor performance (although this needs further investigation). 5. Quantitative Analysis: In addition to the qualitative analysis reported in Table 4 we also did a quantitative analysis by counting the num-\nber of sentences containing repeated words generated by different models. Specifically for the 1268 test instances we counted the number of sentences containing repeated words as generated by different modes. Table 5 summarizes this analysis."

We also introduced a new data set and empirically verified we perform significantly better (gain of 28% (absolute) in ROUGE-L score) than applying a plain encode-attend-decode mechanism to this problem. We observe that adding an attention mechanism on the query string gives significant improvements. We also compare with a state of the art diversity model and outperform it by a good margin (gain of 7% (absolute) in ROUGE-L score). The diversification model proposed is general enough to apply to other NLG tasks with suitable modifications and we are currently working on extending this to dialog systems and general summarization."

In this work we propose a model for the query-based summarization task based on the encode-attend-decode paradigm with two key additions (i) a query attention model (in addition to document attention model) which learns to focus on different portions of the query at different time steps (instead of using a static representation for the query) and (ii) a new diversity based attention model which aims to alleviate the problem of repeating phrases in the summary. In order to enable the testing of this model we introduce a new query-based summarization dataset building on debatepedia. Our experiments show that with these two additions the proposed model clearly outperforms vanilla encode-attend-decode models with a gain of 28% (absolute) in ROUGE-L scores.ive summarization aims to generate a shorter version of the document covering all the salient points in a compact and coherent fashion.
