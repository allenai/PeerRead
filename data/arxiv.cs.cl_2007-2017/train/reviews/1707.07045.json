The key idea is to directly consider all spans in a document as potential mentions and learn distributions over possible antecedents for each. The model computes span embeddings that combine context-dependent boundary representations with a head-finding attention mechanism. It is trained to maximize the marginal likelihood of gold antecedent spans from coreference clusters and is factored to enable aggressive pruning of potential mentions. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with a gain of 1.5 F1 on the OntoNotes benchmark and by 3.1 F1 using a 5-model ensemble, despite the fact that this is the first approach to be successfully trained with no external resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 21:05:04 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07045v1", "Accepted to EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kenton lee", "luheng he", "mike lewis", "luke zettlemoyer"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07045"}
