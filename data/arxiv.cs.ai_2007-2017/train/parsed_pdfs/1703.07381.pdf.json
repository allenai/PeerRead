      "text" : "collection of documents, either multimedia or text documents is still a cumbersome task. Multimedia documents include various elements of different data types including visible and audible data types (text, images and video documents), structural elements as well as interactive elements. In this paper, we have proposed a statistical high level multimedia IR model that is unaware of the shortcomings caused by classical statistical model. It involves use of ontology and different statistical IR approaches (Extended Boolean Approach, Bayesian Network Model etc) for representation of extracted text-image terms or phrases.\nA typical IR system that delivers and stores information is affected by problem of matching between user query and available content on web. Use of Ontology represents the extracted terms in form of network graph consisting of nodes, edges, index terms etc. The above mentioned IR approaches provide relevance thus satisfying user‟s query.\nThe paper also emphasis on analyzing multimedia documents and performs calculation for extracted terms using different statistical formulas. The proposed model developed reduces semantic gap and satisfies user needs efficiently."

      "text" : "Research on multimedia information retrieval seems to be gargantuan and challenging task. Its areas are so diversified that it has lead to independent research in its own components. Firstly, there used to be human centered systems that focus on user‟s behavior and needs. Various experiments and studies were conducted in lieu of these systems. The users were asked to present a set of valuable things in daily life. It was done on similarity of users. Some of choices are same while some are different. Few of them prefer to use images instead of text caption.\nIn further experiments, it was noticed that new users were taking feedback from previous users. It leads to concept of relevance feedback module in information model. In early years, most research was done on content- based image retrieval. The existing models are of different level and scope. These models are semantically unambiguous. For e.g.: IPTC model [1] uses location fields that focus on location of data but this model also failed due to lack of statistical approach. Another metadata model was developed i.e. EXIF\n[2] to support features of images but it did not tell anything about relationship and associations between different contents of image. It also resulted in vain. The third model developed was Dublin Core [3] that deals with semantic as well as structural content of image and text but it failed to depict relationship between text and image.\nWith advancement in technology and predictions, some probabilistic and futuristic models were also developed. In following paper, statistical multimedia IR model has been proposed and compared with classical multimedia IR model."

      "text" : "Human knowledge is richest multimedia storage system. There are various mechanisms like vision, language that expresses knowledge and information obtained from them must be processed by system efficiently. There must be systems designed that interprets and process human queries, thus producing relevant results. It is often seen that users get baffled while searching results of their queries. The reasons behind this are:\n The content of information is unclear and needs user to refine that information.\n The data stored on systems may or may not be updated regularly.\n There lies lower level of interaction between user request and stored information on systems. The low-\nlevel links are called Semantic Gap.\nStatistical approaches involves retrieved documents that matches query closely in terms of statistics i.e. it must have statistical model, calculations and analysis. These approaches break given query into TERMS. Terms are words that occur in collection of documents and are extracted automatically. For reducing inconsistencies and semantic gap in multimedia information, it is necessary to remove different forms of same word because it makes user confused in choosing specific terms that lies close to query. Some IR systems extract phrases from documents. A phrase is a combination of two or more words that is found in document.\nWe have used approaches like extended Boolean approach, network model that performs structural analysis for retrieving text or image pairs. They also assign weights to given term. The weight is defined as measure of effectiveness of given term in distinguishing one document from other documents. The paper has following sections: Section 2 describes architecture of classical multimedia model. Section 3 lets reader go through proposed IR model that is implemented using statistical approaches with the use of ontology. It also requires conversion of low level features to high level features\nusing multimedia analysis. Section 4 deals with experimental analysis and calculations depicting the relevance of proposed model. Finally, Section 5 concludes about paper."

Traditional IR systems are not intelligent that they are able to produce accurate results. These systems use human perception to process query and returns results. The results may be relevant or non- relevant because these systems match query with information stored in information database.\nThe syntax of multimedia document is different from text documents. Multimedia documents do not contain any information symbols or keywords that help in expressing information. They consist of:\n Visible and Audible Data Types: - It includes text, images, graphs, videos and audio.\n Structural Elements: - They are not visible. They describe the organization of other data types.\nThe salient features of multimedia information [4] are given below:\n The information stored in document that is to be searched can be audio, visual, videos etc. They\ncommunicate variety of messages and emotions that helps to understand easily.\n Structure information gives organization and usability in performing communications.\n There is communicational gap between user and system.

      "heading" : "3.3.1 Extended Boolean Approach",
      "text" : "Problem: - The classical Boolean condition i.e. True/ False produces both relevant and non relevant results. They supply given solution in response to whole document. If some text or image terms are relevant in document and some are not relevant, then Boolean condition leads to irrelevant results because it considers whole document.\nSolution: - Extended Boolean Approach\nAnalysis: - A number of extended Boolean models have been developed to provide ranked output of results i.e. the documents that satisfies user‟s query. These models use extended Boolean operators that are called as Soft Boolean Operators for finding relevant text- image pairs. This approach assigned different weights to different terms and computes relevance.\nThe classical Boolean operators are different from Soft operators as follows:\nTable2: Classical Operators vs. Soft Operators\nClassical Boolean Operator Extended Operators (Soft Operators)\nIt evaluates its terms to return two values only i.e. True/\nFalse. The values are represented by zero (False) and 1\n(True) respectively. It is represented by truth tables\ngraphically.\nIt evaluates its items to number on basis of degree to\nwhich condition matches document i.e. If condition\nmatches document, then it returns 1 else 0. If some part\nsatisfies condition while other part does not, then the\nvalue is in fraction. It means soft operators do not leave\ndocument as irrelevant.\nExample of Extended Boolean approach is p-norm model.\nP-Norm Model: - The model performs evaluation if and only if terms satisfy user‟s query in accordance with user‟s views. The model uses two functions AND, OR for finding similar documents and terms. Consider a query that has n terms given by q1, q2, q3 ….qn-1, qn with corresponding weights wq1, wq2, wq3……..wqn-1, wqn in a given document Di. The document is also assigned weights as wd1, wd2, wd3………..wdn-1, wdn.\nFirstly, the extended Boolean function AND finds similar documents by combining (AND) query terms together. Then, terms are retrieved from those documents that satisfy user needs. AND function follows condition that all components must be present in order to return relevant (non zero) terms. If any component is absent, then it will give zero values.\n(1) SAND (d (q1, wq1) AND …………. AND (qn, wqn)) = 1 – [(∑(1-wdi) p * (wq1) p) / (∑ (wq) p)] 1/p\nWhere 1≤p≤∞ and SAND = Similar documents retrieved using AND function.\nThe Extended Boolean OR function finds similar documents with query that add (OR) the query terms together.\n(2) SOR (d (q1, wq1) OR …………. OR (qn, wqn)) = [(∑(wdi) p * (wq1) p) / (∑ (wq) p)] 1/p\nWhere 1≤p≤∞ and SOR = Similar documents retrieved using OR function\nSo, we conclude that p- norm model returns n relevant multimedia terms instead of binary terms. It reduces system time and increases performance.\nDrawbacks: Extended Boolean approach fails in extracting relevant terms from given n terms. P- norm model assigns weights to query terms as well as document terms. Both queries are treated equally because p – norm functions evaluate all term weights in a same way. It cannot distinguish between relevant and non- relevant terms. The solution to this problem lies in usage of probabilistic statistical IR approaches."

      "heading" : "3.3.2 Bayesian Probability Models / Conditional Probability Models",
      "text" : "Bayesian models give relationship between probability of random selected documents and probability that given document is relevant. In such case, we are aware of features of document (image terms, text, statistics, phrases etc) and then calculate its probability. Following are features of probabilistic models: -\n They are related to prior and posterior probabilities. Prior means finding probability as earliest as\npossible without knowing features of document. Posterior means finding probability after examining\nthe features of document. Prior Probability + Posterior Probability = 1\n Conditional Models are also called as Probability Kinematics model that is defined as flow of\nprobabilities of relevant terms to non relevant terms in whole document.\n It uses concept of Inverse Document Frequency (idf) for determining number of relevant terms by\nusing formula as:\nIdf = ln N/n where N= No of total documents, n = No of relevant documents\n Probabilistic models helps in achieving relevance on basis of values estimated for different documents.\nThe statistical probabilistic models [9] are categorized into two parts:\n(a) Binary Independence Model (BI): - The model in which each text- image term (relevant/ irrelevant) is independent of other text- image pairs in collection of documents is called BI model. So, the probability of any relevant/ irrelevant term is independent of probability of any other terms in documents.\nBI model is also called Relevance Weighting Theory. It says that each term is given weight that is used to rank documents on basis of relevance, thus extracting relevant terms. Weights are assigned by product of Term Frequency and Inverse Term Frequency i.e. (tf * idf) when we are taking random collection of documents. Term Frequency (tf) means number of terms occurred in document. So, tf varies from one document to another whereas Inverse Document Frequency (idf) measures how many times the given term occurs in document. It gives probability of terms occurred in a document.\nConsider number of finite terms tk in document di. Each term is assigned different weights wk that is to be calculated according to given formula:\nWk = log [Pk (1- Uk) / Uk (1 – Pk)] (When we are given set of data terms)\nWhere Pk = Probability of term tk occurring in relevant documents\nUk = Probability of term tk occurring in non relevant documents\nWk = Weight to each term. It is defined as measure of distinguishing relevant terms from non relevant terms. It is also called as Term Relevance Weight or Log Odds Function.\nOdd ratio is calculated on basis of likelihood of terms in relevant documents as well as in non relevant documents. Let likelihood of terms in relevant documents is X = (Pk / 1- Pk) and in non relevant documents Y = (Uk / 1-Uk). Then Wk is given by X / Y. Wk is zero if Pk = UK, Wk > 0 if Pk > Uk\nThe model concludes that the terms which occur many times in single document is relevant but if same terms occur in large\nnumber of large number of documents , then it is not relevant. So, a weight function is developed that varies from idf to Wk formula.\nLimitation of this model: - It is not able to distinguish between low frequency terms and high frequency terms in context of weights. It gives weight of low frequency terms as same as those of high frequency terms. It does not able to extract terms from multiple queries also. So, to overcome these problems, we have used Inference Network Model.\n(b) Bayesian Inference Network Model It is one of statistical approach for extraction of terms from multimedia documents with the help of constructing graph called as Inference Network Graph. Besides computing probabilities for different nodes, this model also determines concepts between various retrieved terms. It provides surety that user needs are fulfilled because it also combines multiple sources of evidence regarding relevance of document to user query.\nGraph Structure: - Inference Network is a graph that has nodes connected by edges. Nodes represent True/ false\nstatements describing term is relevant or not. A graph has following elements:\n Document Nodes (Dn) : - They are called Root Nodes\n Text Nodes (Tn): - They are child nodes of document nodes. It may include audio, video nodes,\ntext image nodes etc. So, child nodes have multiple representations of document.\n Concept Representation Nodes (CRn): - They are child of text nodes. The concepts used in terms that\nare in text nodes are represented by CR nodes. These nodes are index terms or keywords that are matched in document and retrieves relevant terms.\n Document Network: - It is network consisting of Document nodes, Text nodes, and CR nodes. It is\nnot tree as it has multiple roots and nodes. Document Network is Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) since it has no loop. The representation of document network for different documents from D1 to Dn is shown as:\n…………………….\nFigure4: Document Network (It describes concepts used in multiple terms from different documents)\n Query Network: - Since we have extracted concepts in Document Network, it is possible that different\nconcepts are used in same query nodes or different concepts in different nodes. The concepts that\ndescribe relevant terms are shown in form of results and presented to user.\nThe representation of query network for different query nodes from Q1 to Qn is shown as:\n……….............…………….………..\nQuery Nodes\nLeaf Nodes (Results)\nFigure5: Query Network (It describes generation of results (leaf nodes))\nWhen we combine document network and query network, we get inference graph. This graph computes probabilities of terms contained in child nodes of document nodes and so on. It is done by using LINK MATRIX. Each node is assigned with its weight in each row of matrix. The column represents number of possible combinations a node can have.\nIn link matrix, Number of parents = 2n Number of columns. If node has 3 parents, then there will be 8 columns. Then, probabilities and weight function are computed for all 8 columns of matrix. Each probability is multiplied by its weight and then all eight probabilities are added to get total\nprobability of their respective parents‟ node. Consider combination of 110 (1 stands for True, 0 for False). The probability for combination is calculated as P1 * P2 * (1-P3). Weight function for such combination is (W1 + W2) / (W1 + W2 + W3). Total probability is calculated as P1 * P2 * (1-P3) * (W1 + W2) / (W1 + W2 + W3)."

We have to compute probabilities of relevant and non relevant terms and hence calculate weight function for each term.\nGiven data: Total number of relevant documents (R) = 10\nDocuments with Documents without\nTerm tk ( r) = 4 Term tk (R – r) = 6\nTotal no. of documents having terms tk\nn-r + r = 9\nn = 9\nTotal number of Non relevant documents (N-r) = 15\nDocuments with Documents without Term tk (n-r) = 5 Term tk (N-r) – (n-r) = 10\nTotal no. of documents without term tk (N-r) – (n-r) + (Rr) = 16\nAccording to BI model, Total number of documents N= 25 Total number of documents with term tk (n) = 9 Total number of relevant documents (R) = 10 Total number of relevant documents with term tk (r) = 4 From above data, Pk = Probability of term tk occurring in relevant documents\n= 4/10 = 2/5\nUk = Probability of term tk occurring in non - relevant documents\n= 5/15 = 1/3\nX = Pk / (1- Pk) = (2/5)/ (3/5) = 2/3 Y = Uk / (1 – Uk)\n= (1/3) / (2/3) = ½\nOdd Ratio or Weighting Function Wk = X/Y = 4/3 Ranking function W = log (X/Y) = log (4/3) = 0.20068\nFigure6: - Computation of Probabilities of terms graphically\nOn the basis of above graph and probability values, we can find new weight function for terms from old weight function by using Rocchio Formula.\nQa (new) = x * Qa (old) + y * 1/ (RD) * ∑ wtaRD – z * 1/ (NRD) * ∑ wtaNRD\nHere Qa (old) = 4/3\nRelevant Documents (RD) = 10\nNon relevant documents (NRD) = 15\n∑ wtaRD = 4 + 6 = 10\n∑ wtaNRD = 5 + 10 = 15\nX = 1, y = (4+6) / 2 = 5, z = (5+10) / 2 = 15/2 = 7.5\nSo, Qa (new) = 1 * (4/3) + 5 * (1/10) * 10 – 7.5 * (1/15) * 15\n= 4/3 + 5 – 7.5 = - 3.7\nSince new weight function is negative, so it is discarded and old function is considered as relevance function.\nCatchy Concept: - The proposed High-Level Statistical Multimedia IR Model deals with the queries that have been expanded and refined according to user's requirements. In this way the queries can be reused. It is good idea if given queries is short. HOW THIS MODEL CAN BECOME SUITABLE FOR LONG QUERIES ALSO?\nCatchy Answer: - The answer to above question is Use of Random Variables. These variables may be continuous as well as Discrete. The terms that are found in multimedia text documents can be treated as variables. If the terms are short or finite, then it is solved using concept of Discrete Random Variables. It simply means adding product of probabilities of various terms/queries used in document. In this way, expected value [E] of term function is calculated and we can determine its relevance.\nFor long queries, the concept of Continuous Random Variables can be used. Further, long queries may have some limit or they are infinite. For queries having limit, approximation is used. The terms are integrated to particular interval and produce results proximity to user‟s requirements.\nFor infinite long queries, various methods of calculating expected value [E] like Poisson distribution, Binomial distribution are employed.\nIn this way, both short queries as well as long queries can be reused and expanded."

      "heading" : "5. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "The paper illustrates the working of proposed high level multimedia IR model consisting of various modules. Each module is described separately. This module provides extraction of relevant terms from huge collection of multimedia documents. Since multimedia documents produce information tokens that are different from text tokens, so those statistical approaches are shown in paper that analyses multimedia document and retrieves multimedia terms (text, images, and videos) from them.\nThe new model can replace ambiguities of traditional multimedia IR model that deals with information symbols only instead of maintaining relationships between them. It is beneficial in various aspects like there is module introduced in it for maintaining conceptual relationships between extracted terms and represents them using ontology. The model uses probabilistic approaches for calculating ranking of documents and retrieves optimal queries. The results are then presented to user."

    "abstractText" : "The process of retrieval of relevant information from massive collection of documents, either multimedia or text documents is still a cumbersome task. Multimedia documents include various elements of different data types including visible and audible data types (text, images and video documents), structural elements as well as interactive elements. In this paper, we have proposed a statistical high level multimedia IR model that is unaware of the shortcomings caused by classical statistical model. It involves use of ontology and different statistical IR approaches (Extended Boolean Approach, Bayesian Network Model etc) for representation of extracted text-image terms or phrases. A typical IR system that delivers and stores information is affected by problem of matching between user query and available content on web. Use of Ontology represents the extracted terms in form of network graph consisting of nodes, edges, index terms etc. The above mentioned IR approaches provide relevance thus satisfying user‟s query. The paper also emphasis on analyzing multimedia documents and performs calculation for extracted terms using different statistical formulas. The proposed model developed reduces semantic gap and satisfies user needs efficiently. Index Terms Information Retrieval (IR), OWL, Statistical Approaches (BI model, Extended Boolean Approach, Bayesian Network Model), Query Expansion and Refinement. State of Art Research on multimedia information retrieval seems to be gargantuan and challenging task. Its areas are so diversified that it has lead to independent research in its own components. Firstly, there used to be human centered systems that focus on user‟s behavior and needs. Various experiments and studies were conducted in lieu of these systems. The users were asked to present a set of valuable things in daily life. It was done on similarity of users. Some of choices are same while some are different. Few of them prefer to use images instead of text caption. In further experiments, it was noticed that new users were taking feedback from previous users. It leads to concept of relevance feedback module in information model. In early years, most research was done on contentbased image retrieval. The existing models are of different level and scope. These models are semantically unambiguous. For e.g.: IPTC model [1] uses location fields that focus on location of data but this model also failed due to lack of statistical approach. Another metadata model was developed i.e. EXIF [2] to support features of images but it did not tell anything about relationship and associations between different contents of image. It also resulted in vain. The third model developed was Dublin Core [3] that deals with semantic as well as structural content of image and text but it failed to depict relationship between text and image. With advancement in technology and predictions, some probabilistic and futuristic models were also developed. In following paper, statistical multimedia IR model has been proposed and compared with classical multimedia IR model.",
