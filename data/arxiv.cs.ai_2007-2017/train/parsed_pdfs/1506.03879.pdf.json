The array used to hold the index of the nearest higher-densitied object for each object can be transformed into a Leading Tree (LT), in which each parent node P leads its child nodes to join the same cluster as P itself, and the child nodes are sorted by their g values in descendant order to accelerate the disconnecting of root in each subtree. There are two major advantages with the LT: One is dramatically reducing the running time of assigning noncenter data points to their cluster ID, because the assigning process is turned into just disconnecting the links from each center to its parent. The other is that the tree model for representing clusters is more informative. Because we can check which objects are more likely to be selected as centers in finer grained clustering, or which objects reach to its center via less jumps. Experiment results and analysis show the effectiveness and high efficiency of the assigning process with an LT.\nKeywords: Leading Tree; Clustering; Density Peaks; Hierarchical clustering"

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Clustering is a general methodology and a rich conceptual and algorithmic framework for data analysis and interpretation, which gathers the objects into groups [1]. Clustering can be divided into two categories regarding the structure of the result returned. Flat clustering (also called partition clustering in some literature) returns the clusters just in one layer, which is efficient and conceptually simple but has some drawbacks. One case is that the number of clusters is just too large to make good sense in the perspective of human cognition. Because according to Miller's \"seven plus or minus two\" theory, there are the 7 objects in the span of attention, and the 7 digits in the span of immediate memory [2]. Too large number of clusters doesn't offer people a good understanding of the data. Another drawback is some of the real-world datasets are hierarchically structured in nature, but flat clustering is unable to reflect the truth. These limitations can be broken through by hierarchical clustering, which outputs a hierarchy, a structure that is more informative than flat clustering [3].\nDP_CLUS is a flat clustering method able to efficiently and accurately cluster datasets of any\nshape with the aid of defining two simple measures: local density ρ and the distance to the nearest neighbor with higher density δ[4]. Since it was published in June, 2014, over 30 papers have been published (some are informally) to follow this research. The majority of the citing works directly adopted DP_CLUS to the problems from specific domain, such as neuroscience [5], geoscience and remote sensing [6], molecular biology [7], computational biophysics [8], age estimation in image processing [9], finding a food soulmate [10], fundamental matrix estimation in computer vision [11], analytic chemistry [12], clustering Sentences for multi-document Summarization [13], and so forth. Among the remaining part, some ensemble DP_CLUS with other methods to deal with streaming data [14] and imbalanced dataset oversampling [15], to find nonspherical clusters [16], to resolve inverse Ising problem [17], to classify scene image combined with k means [18], etc.; Wang discussed its parameter the cut off distance dc setting [19]; Zhang extended it to cluster the datasets without density peaks [20]. There are some works only used its partial idea, such as neighbor to build a k-nearest neighborhood to explore the clusters in high dimension and large scale datasets [21]; or just mentioned it as a clustering method [22, 23].\nAmong the research works mentioned above, Teng Qiu’s [24] and our method appear somehow alike. But the differences are obvious and significant: a) Qiu constructs an In-Tree with hopping the data points to the locations of their first transfer points; but we directly transform the array Nn, which holds the index of the nearest point of higher density and are computed in DP_CLUS, into a plain tree. In this tree, each node except the root is led by its parent to join the same cluster. Thus we call this tree a Leading Tree (LT). b) Qiu evolves the In-Tree constructed into the final stars to represent the clustering result; but we remain the LT unchanged as an intermediate result permanently ready for further hierarchical clustering with arbitrary number of clusters.\nIn the paper, we present the algorithms of transforming the array Nn into an LT and performing hierarchical clustering based on the LT data structure. Experiment results and analysis find the boundary condition of using an LT to save time in hierarchical clustering with DP_CLUS, and show that the clustering results described with trees are more informative than the original approach. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews DP_CLUS. Section 3 presents the algorithms of transforming Nn into an LT and performing hierarchical clustering based on the LT. The experimental setting, datasets and efficiency evaluation and discussion are described in Section 4, and we draw a conclusion in Section 5."

      "text" : "The method proposed is mainly based on [4], so we give a brief introduction to its idea and the algorithm here. The authors firstly made a sound intuitive assumption that no matter what the shape of clusters looks like, centers are always surrounded by non-center data points with lower density, and the distance between two centers are relatively long. Then two simple measures, namely local density (denoted as ρ) and minimal distance to data points with higher density\n(denoted as δ ), are employed to accomplish the clustering job.\nThe notations used to describe the algorithms in DP_CLUS and our method are listed in\nTable 1.\nTABLE 1: Notations in DP_CLUS\nDP_CLUS takes the distance matrix of a given dataset as input, and performing the following\nsteps:\n(1) Compute 1 2 { , ,..., } N    via cut-off kernel:\n, \\{ } χ( )i i j c j I i d - d \n  , where 1, 0;\nχ( )= 0, 0.\nx x\nx\n \n (1),\ncd is the cutoff distance; or via Gaussian kernel:\n, 2( )\n\\{ }\ni j c\nd d\ni\nj I i\ne \n\n  (2).\nEquation (2) is used in the authors’ implementation.\n(2) Sort 1 2 { , ,..., } N    in descending order to get ;\n(3) Compute  via\n,\n, 2\nmin{ }, 2;\nmax{ }, 1.\ni j j\ni\ni j\nq q q\nj i q\nq q j\nd i\nd i  \n\n \n  \n\n(3),\nand write the index of the nearest neighbor with larger  in vector Nn;\n(4) Interactively choose the points with “anomalously large”  and  as centers; (5) Assign each data points to the same cluster as its nearest neighbor with larger  . This process is done by scanning the vector  only once with referring to Nn.\nThe authors use a parameter named bord_rho to distinguish core and hallo data points of a\ncluster, but for simplicity, we omit the discussion of hallo and core in this study."

Since Nn indicates its direct leading parent P for each object, then it is easy to find out the child nodes led by P. By adding the corresponding child nodes to all parent nodes, an LT is constructed. See Algorithm 2. Note that the child nodes of each parent are added in the γ- descending order, so that when a newly upgrade center is detached from its parent, we simply remove the links from the parent to its first child. Thus the construction of the LT is accelerated. See Algorithm 2. Algorithm 2. Transforming the Nn into an LT Input: Nn and SortedGammaInds Output: An LT in the form of adjacent list AL Step 1.

But the cost is the time for constructing the LT (TConstrLT). If the number of the potential layers in the hierarchy Nl is small like the datasets we tested, then TConstrLT + Nl ×TSplitLT > Nl ×TAssign. However, if Nl is so large that Equation 5 is satisfied, then using an LT to perform hierarchical clustering will save computing time.\nConsLT\nAssign SplitLT\nT Nl\nT T   (5)\nBesides, with the clusters being described by trees, users can tell the differences among the\nobjects within the same cluster. For example, as shown in Fig 2.b we can say that object No.2 is closer to the center than No.1 and No.3, because there is an object (No.12) separating them from the center. This is more informative than the original approach of DP CLUS, which treat each objects in a cluster equally, just as most of the clustering methods."

Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the LT approach is much more efficient to assign the noncenter objects in DP_CLUS than the original Nn approach, and the clusters presented with trees can provide more information on the noncenters’ potential to be selected as centers in future and on how many jumps a given object needs to reach its center. This discovery not only holds the potential to accelerate the assigning processing during the hierarchical clustering with DP_CLUS, but also provides us with a more profound understanding on the result structure of DP_CLUS."

The array used to hold the index of the nearest higher-densitied object for each object can be transformed into a Leading Tree (LT), in which each parent node P leads its child nodes to join the same cluster as P itself, and the child nodes are sorted by their g values in descendant order to accelerate the disconnecting of root in each subtree. There are two major advantages with the LT: One is dramatically reducing the running time of assigning noncenter data points to their cluster ID, because the assigning process is turned into just disconnecting the links from each center to its parent. The other is that the tree model for representing clusters is more informative. Because we can check which objects are more likely to be selected as centers in finer grained clustering, or which objects reach to its center via less jumps. Experiment results and analysis show the effectiveness and high efficiency of the assigning process with an LT.",
