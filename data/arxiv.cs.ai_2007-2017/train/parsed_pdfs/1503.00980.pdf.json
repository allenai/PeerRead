Being a useful model to formulate several relevant applications, MaxMeanDP is known to be NP-hard and thus computationally difficult. In this paper, we present a highly effective memetic algorithm for MaxMeanDP which relies on solution recombination and local optimization to find high quality solutions. Computational experiments on the set of 160 benchmark instances with up to 1000 elements commonly used in the literature show that the proposed algorithm improves or matches the published best known results for all instances in a short computing time, with only one exception, while achieving a high success rate of 100%. In particular, we improve 59 previous best results out of the 60 most challenging instances. Results on a set of 40 new large instances with 3000 and 5000 elements are also presented. The key ingredients of the proposed algorithm are investigated to shed light on how they affect the performance of the algorithm.\nKeywords: Dispersion Problem; Memetic Algorithm; Tabu Search; Heuristics."

In the related literature, a vertex v ∈ V is also called an element, and the edge weight dij ∈ D is called the distance (or diversity) between elements i and j.\nAccording to the objective function to be optimized as well as the constraints on the cardinality of subset M , several specific equitable dispersion problem can be defined. At first, if the cardinality of M is fixed to a given number m, the related equitable dispersion problems include the following four classic variants: (1) the max-sum diversity problem, also known as the maximum diversity problem (MDP), which is to maximize the sum of distances among the selected elements [1,2,7,12,15,21,24]; (2) the max-min diversity problem that aims to maximize the minimum distance among the selected elements [5,19,22,23]; (3) the maximum minsum dispersion problem (MaxMinsumDP) that aims to maximize the minimum aggregate dispersion among the selected elements [3,20]; (4) the minimum differential dispersion problem (MinDiffDP) whose goal is to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum aggregate dispersion among the selected elements to guarantee that each selected element has the approximately same total distance from the other selected elements [3,8,20]. In addition, when the cardinality of subset M is not fixed, i.e., the size of M is allowed to vary from 2 to n, the related equitable dispersion problems include the max-mean dispersion problem (MaxMeanDP) and the weighted MaxMeanDP [4,6,16,20].\nIn this study, we focus on MaxMeanDP which can be described as follows [20]. Given a set V of n elements and a distance matrix (dij)n×n where dij represents the distance between elements i and j and can take a positive or negative value, the max-mean dispersion problem consists in selecting a subset M (|M | is not fixed) from V such that the mean dispersion among the selected\nelements, i.e.,\n∑\ni,j∈M;i<j dij\n|M | , is maximized.\nMaxMeanDP can be naturally expressed as a quadratic integer program with binary variables xi that takes 1 if element i is selected and 0 otherwise [16,20], i.e.,\nMaximize f(s) =\n∑i=n−1 i=1 ∑n j=i+1 dijxixj\n∑n i=1 xi\n(1)\nSubject to n ∑\ni=1\nxi ≥ 2 (2)\nxi ∈ {0, 1}, i = 1, 2, . . . , n; (3)\nwhere the constraint (2) guarantees that at least two elements are selected.\nIn addition to its theoretical signification as a strongly NP-hard problem [20], MaxMeanDP is notable for its ability to model a variety of real-world applications, such as web pages ranks [14], community mining [25], and others mentioned in [4].\nGiven the interest of MaxMeanDP, several useful solution approaches have been proposed in the literature to deal with this hard combinatorial optimization problem. First of all, Prokopyev et al. presented a mixed-integer 0-1 linear programming formulation and solved small instances with up to 100 elements with the CPLEX solver [20]. In the same work, they also introduced a GRASP method and made a comparison between the GRASP method and the MILP method to show the superiority of GRASP. Subsequently, Martí and Sandoya proposed a GRASP with the path relinking method (GRASPPR) [16], and the computational results show that GRASP-PR outperforms the previously reported methods. Very recently, Della et al. reported a hybrid heuristic approach based on a quadratic knapsack formulation [6], and their computational experiment shows that the hybrid approach is superior to the GRASP-PR method. In another very recent work, Carrasco et al. proposed a diversified tabu search algorithm by combining a short-term tabu search procedure and a long-term tabu search procedure [4], and the computational results show that this algorithm clearly dominates the previous GRASP-PR method.\nIn this paper, we propose the first population-based memetic algorithm for solving MaxMeanDP (called MAMMDP). The proposed algorithm combines a random crossover operator to generate new offspring solutions and a tabu search method to find good local optima.\nThe performance of our algorithm is assessed on a set of 160 benchmark instances (20 ≤ n ≤ 1000) commonly used in the literature and a set of additional 40 large-sized instances that we generate (n = 3000, 5000). For the first set of existing benchmarks, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to attain, in a short or very short computing time, all current best known results established by any existing algorithms, except for one instance. Furthermore, it can even improve the previous best known result for a number of these instances. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is also verified on much larger instances of the second set with 3000 and 5000 elements.\nThe remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe in detail the general scheme and the ingredients of the proposed algorithm. In Section 3, we present the computational results based on the 200 benchmark instances and compare them with those of the existing state-of-theart algorithms from the literature. In Section 4, some important ingredients of the proposed algorithm are analyzed and discussed. Finally, we conclude the paper in the last Section."

      "heading" : "2.1 General Procedure",
      "text" : "The proposed memetic algorithm (denoted by MAMMDP) adopts the principles and guidelines of designing effective MA for discrete combinatorial problems [13]. Indeed, the overall performance of a memetic algorithm depends largely on the implementation of these two key components that need to be carefully designed according to the specific problem structure. Additionally, the proposed MAMMDP algorithm uses a population scheme which borrows from the path relinking method [11] to ensure a strong intensification search.\nThe general procedure of our MAMMDP algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1, where s∗ and sw respectively represent the best solution found so far and the worst solution in the population in terms of the objective value, and PairSet is the set of solution pairs (si, sj), which is initially composed of all the possible solution pairs (si, sj) in the population and is dynamically updated as the search progresses.\nOur MAMMDP algorithm starts with an initial population P (line 4) which includes p different solutions, where each of them is randomly generated and then improved by the tabu search procedure. After the initialization of population (Section 2.3), the algorithm enters a while loop (lines 11 to 25) to make a number of generations. At each generation, a solution pair (si, sj) is randomly selected from PairSet and then the crossover operator (line 14) is applied to the selected solution pair (si, sj) to generate a new solution so (Section 2.5). Subsequently, so is improved by the tabu search procedure (line 15) (Section 2.4). After that, a population updating rule is used to update the population (lines 20 to 24) (Section 2.6). Meanwhile, the PairSet is accordingly updated as follows: First, the solution pair (si, sj) is removed from PairSet (line 13); Then, if an offspring solution so replaces the worst solution sw in the population, all the solution pairs containing sw are removed from PairSet and all the solution pairs that can be generated by combining so with other solutions in the population are added into PairSet (lines 23 to 24). The while loop ends when PairSet becomes empty, then the population is recreated, while preserving the best solution (s∗) found so for in the new population (lines 4\nto 8), and the above while loop is repeated if the timeout limit is not reached.\nIt is worth noting that compared with the traditional random selection scheme, the proposed MAMMDP algorithm uses the set PairSet to contain the solution pairs of the population for crossover operations. This strategy ensures that every pair of solutions in the population is combined exactly once, favoring an more intensified search.\nAlgorithm 1 Memetic algorithm for Max-mean Dispersion Problem 1: Input: The set V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} of n elements and the distance matrix D =\n[dij ]n×n, the population size p, the timeout limit tout. 2: Output: the best solution s∗ found 3: repeat 4: P = {s1, . . . , sp} ← Population_Initialization(V ) /∗ Section 2.3 ∗/ 5: if it is not in the first loop then 6: sw ← arg min{f(si) : i = 1, . . . , p} 7: P ← P ∪ {s∗} \\ {sw} 8: end if 9: s∗ ← arg max{f(si) : i = 1, . . . , p} /∗ s∗ keeps the best solution found\n∗/ 10: PairSet ← {(si, sj) : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ p} 11: while PairSet 6= ∅ and time < tout do 12: Randomly pick a solution pair (si, sj) ∈ PairSet 13: PairSet ← PairSet \\ {(si, sj)} 14: so ← CrossoverOperator(si, sj) /∗ Section 2.5 ∗/ 15: so ← TabuSearch(so) /∗ Section 2.4 ∗/ 16: if f(so) > f(s∗) then 17: s∗ ← so 18: end if 19: sw ← arg min{f(si) : i = 1, . . . , p} 20: if so dose not exist in P and f(so) > f(sw) then 21: P ← P ∪ {so} \\ {sw} 22: PairSet ← PairSet \\ {(sw, sk) : sk ∈ P} 23: PairSet ← PairSet ∪ {(so, sk) : sk ∈ P} 24: end if /∗ Section 2.6 ∗/ 25: end while 26: until time ≥ tout"

In this study, we devise a tabu search (TS) method as the local optimization procedure which proves to be highly effective when when it is applied alone.\nGiven a neighborhood structure (N(s)) and a starting solution (s0), our tabu search procedure iteratively replaces the incumbent solution s by a best eligible neighboring solution (s ′\n) until the stopping condition is met, i.e., the best solution (sb) is not improved for α consecutive iterations (called the depth of TS). At each iteration of TS, the performed move is recorded in the tabu list to prevent the reverse move from being performed for the next tt iterations. Here, tt is called the tabu tenure and controlled by a special tabu list management strategy. Note that in this tabu search method a move is identified to be eligible if it is not forbidden by the tabu list or it leads to a solution better than the best solution found so far in terms of the objective function value (aspiration criterion).\nThe general scheme of our TS method is described in Algorithm 2, and the neighborhood structure employed by our TS method and the tabu list management strategy are described in the following subsections.\nAlgorithm 2 TabuSearch(s0, N(s), α)\n1: Input: Input solution s0, neighborhood N(s), search depth α 2: Output: The best solution sb found during the tabu search process 3: s ← s0 /* s is the current solution */ 4: sb ← s /* sb is the best solution found so far */ 5: d = 0 /* d counts the consecutive iterations where sb is not updated */ 6: repeat 7: Choose a best eligible neighboring solution s′ ∈ N(s) 8: s ← s′\n9: Update tabu list 10: if f(s) > f(sb) then 11: sb ← s, 12: d = 0 13: else 14: d = d+ 1 15: end if 16: until d = α 17: return sb"

Finally, the interval margins are defined by y1 = 1, yi+1 = yi + 5ai (i ≤ 15).\nThus, this function varies periodically and for each period, 15 tabu tenures are used dynamically, each being kept for a number of consecutive iterations.

In spite of its simplicity, UC has shown to be quite robust and effective in many settings.\nThe dedicated GC operator is shown in Algorithm 4. Given two parent solutions s1 and s2 whose subsets of selected elements are respectively represented by M1 and M2, we first estimate the size of the set Mo of selected elements\nfor the offspring solution so such that the Hamming distances of so to s1 as well as s2 are approximately the same, i.e., m ← |M1|+|M2|\n2 . Then a partial\nsolution is generated by preserving the common elements of M1 and M2, i.e., Mo ← M1 ∩M2. After that, we complete the offspring solution s\no in a step by step way by choosing in turn a best element from M1 \\ Mo or M2 \\ Mo and adding it to Mo. More specifically, we first choose an element (vo) that yields the largest move value from M1\\Mo and add it to Mo, then we choose another element (uo) that yields the largest move value from M2 \\ Mo and add it to Mo. We repeat these two steps until the size of Mo reaches m.\nIntuitively, UC is more disruptive than GC and thus is suitable for the purpose of diversifying the search. On the other hand, GC is more conservative and computationally more expensive. Based on the computational outcomes presented in Section 4.2, we adopt in this study the UC operator as the main crossover operator of our memetic algorithm, while using GC as a reference operator for our analysis on crossovers."

      "text" : "First, to show the effectiveness of the underlying tabu search procedure of the proposed algorithm, we carry out an additional experiment on 30 representative instances, where each instance is independently solved 20 times by the tabu search procedure with randomly generated initial solutions. The computational results are summarized in Table 3, where f ∗ and t(s) represent respectively the previous best known result and the average computing time over 20 runs, other symbols are the same as those in Table 1. Note that the improved results compared to the previous best known values fpre are indicated in bold.\nTable 3 discloses that our tabu search procedure alone is able to attain the previous best known result for the tested instances. Moreover, for all tested instances, the obtained average objective value (favg) is still better than the previous best known result (fpre) on 29 out of 30 instances. These results indicate that our tabu search method is quite effective with respect to the existing algorithms designed for MaxMeanDP. In terms of computational time, one observes that one run of the tabu search procedure takes on average less than 2 seconds for instances with n ≤ 1000, much shorter than those required\nby the state of the art algorithms [4,6,16]. To sum, this experiment shows that our tabu search procedure is highly effective compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature.\nIt should be mentioned that compared to the previous methods for MaxMeanDP, such as those in [4], the success of our tabu search method may be attributed to the combined use of the neighborhood N1, the fast neighborhood evaluation technique and its dynamic tabu list management strategy."

      "text" : "In this section, we show a study about the influence of the crossover operator on the performance of the proposed algorithm by comparing the uniform crossover (UC) operator and the greedy crossover (GC) operator. The experiment is carried out on a set of 40 large instance with n ≥ 3000, where the memetic algorithms with UC and GC are respectively performed 20 times\nfor each of the tested instances. The computational results of the both algorithms are summarized in Table 4, including the best (fbest) and average (favg) objective values obtained over 20 runs, the success rate (SR) and average computing time in seconds (t(s)) to achieve the associated fbest, where better results between these two algorithms are indicated in bold. The rows, Better, Equal, Worse denote respectively the number of instances for which an algorithm yields better, equal, worse results compared to the other algorithm. Finally, to verify whether there exists a significant difference between the two crossover operators in terms of the best and average objective values, the p-values from the non-parametric Friedman test are reported in the last row.\nOne observes from Table 4 that the UC and GC operators are comparable in the overall performance of the algorithm in terms of best and average results, which is confirmed by the Friedman test (p-values > 0.05). First, in terms of the best objective value, UC and GC yield respectively better result on 1 and 2 instances compared to another operator. Second, in terms of the average objective value, it can be found the UC operator produces a better and worse result respectively for 16 and 9 instances. As to the success rate and computing time, these two crossover operators also achieve similar performances. This experiment demonstrates that there is no dominance of one crossover over the other. Instead, they are complementary to solve different instances. One interesting future study would be to investigate the ways of using jointly these two operators with the search algorithm."

      "heading" : "4.3 Improvement of Memetic Algorithm Over the Tabu Search Procedure",
      "text" : "As shown in Section 4.1, our tabu search procedure is very competitive compared to the existing algorithms in the literature. So it is interesting to know whether our MAMMDP algorithm has a significant improvement over its underlying local optimization (the tabu search) procedure. To compare the performances of the MAMMDP algorithm and its underlying tabu search procedure, the multi-start tabu search (MTS) and MAMMDP algorithms are respectively performed 20 times for each of the 40 representative instances with n = 3000 or 5000 under the same cutoff time limits given in Section 3.2. Notice that for MTS, the tabu search procedure is run in a multi-start way with a randomly generated initial solution for each re-start until the timeout limit is reached, the tabu search procedure being re-started once the depth of tabu search α (which is set to 5× 104) is reached. The computational results of both algorithms are respectively summarized in Table 5 which is composed of two parts, where the symbols are the same with those in Table 4.\nTable 5 discloses that for the 20 instances with n = 3000 the MAMMDP\nalgorithm performs slightly better than the MTS algorithm, but the differences is small. However, for the 20 larger instances with n = 5000, the MAMMDP algorithm significantly outperforms the the MTS algorithm. First, compared with the MTS algorithm, the MAMMDP algorithm obtains better and worse results in terms of the best objective value on 11 and 2 instances respectively. Second, in terms of average objective value, the MAMMDP algorithm yields better results on 19 out of 20 instances. In addition, from the Friedman test, one observes that the obtained p-values are 1.26e− 2 (<0.05) and 5.699e− 5 (<0.05) respectively for the best and average objective values, implying there exists a significant difference between these two methods. These outcomes demonstrate that the memetic framework is particularly useful to solve large and difficult instances."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this paper, we propose the first population-based memetic algorithm (MAMMDP) for solving the NP-hard max-mean dispersion problem (MaxMeanDP). MAMMDP integrates an effective tabu search procedure and a random crossover operator while adopting an original scheme for parent selection. The computational results on a large number of 200 benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm is very competitive compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. Specifically, it improves or matches the previous best known results for all tested instances with n ≤ 1000 with an average computing time of less than 14 seconds and a success rate of 100%, with only one exception. In particular, we found new and improved best results for 59 out of the 60 most challenging instances. We also show computational results on 40 large instances with 3000 or 5000 elements which can serve as reference lower bounds for evaluating new MaxMeanDP algorithms.\nThe investigations of several important ingredients confirm that both the underlying tabu search procedure and the crossover operator of the proposed algorithm contribute to the high performance of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the population-based memetic framework is particularly suitable to solve large and difficult problem instances.\nThe proposed algorithm could be adapted to the weighted version of the maxmean dispersion problem with several small modifications. Some ideas of the proposed algorithm could be applied to other other binary optimization problems (including some dispersion problems) where no constraint is imposed on the number of variables taking the value of one."

Being a useful model to formulate several relevant applications, MaxMeanDP is known to be NP-hard and thus computationally difficult. In this paper, we present a highly effective memetic algorithm for MaxMeanDP which relies on solution recombination and local optimization to find high quality solutions. Computational experiments on the set of 160 benchmark instances with up to 1000 elements commonly used in the literature show that the proposed algorithm improves or matches the published best known results for all instances in a short computing time, with only one exception, while achieving a high success rate of 100%. In particular, we improve 59 previous best results out of the 60 most challenging instances. Results on a set of 40 new large instances with 3000 and 5000 elements are also presented. The key ingredients of the proposed algorithm are investigated to shed light on how they affect the performance of the algorithm.",
