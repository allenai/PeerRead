      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Unsupervised feature learning is the current methodology in machine learning to build features automatically from data, especially data without human labelling. Successful feature learning algorithms and their applications can be found in recent literature, e.g., RBMs [9], Autoencoders [1], Sparse Coding [18], Kmeans [2], ISA [16]. So far, most of these algorithms have succeeded in learning low-level features such as “edge” or “blob” detectors.\nThe focus of this work is to build features that detect high-level concepts in images, thereby attempting to simulate a simpler version of important neuroscientific results known as “grandmother cell.” This class of cells have been argued to exist in the brain with the role of detecting faces and hands [5] or specific people [21] (e.g., famous actress Jennifer Aniston).\nCurrent computer vision practices typically advocate the use of labeled data to achieve these high-level concepts. For example, to build a face detector, one needs a large collection of images with labeled faces and their locations. In terms of practical applications, the demand of large labeled sets renders this approach difficult to apply to problems where labeled data are rare or the number of classes is large.\nar X\niv :1\n11 2.\n62 09\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 9\nIt has been strongly hypothesized, however, that the brain approaches this problem by making an intelligent use of unlabeled data. This hypothesis is based on the following observation. A human brain typically has approximately 1014 synapses (connections) and we live around 109 seconds. Thus, even if each synapse encodes one bit of information, it would require about 1014 / 109 = 105 bits per second to figure out all connections. This amount of information surpasses the amount of labelled data we have access to via human supervisors.1 Hence, it is more likely that we learn using unsupervised principles rather than supervised principles.\nThe goal of this work is to assess the feasibility of building such high-level features from unlabeled data. A positive answer to this question can lead to two further important outcomes. First and practically, this gives us a way to develop features automatically from inexpensive unlabeled data in contrast to the conventional approach of using more expensive labeled data. More importantly, it answers a more intriguing question if certain properties of the grandmother cell can indeed be learned from a collection of unlabeled images. Informally, this means whether a baby can learn to group faces into one class because it has seen many of them and not because it is guided by supervision or rewards.\nWe conjecture that the lack of high-level features in previous work stems from the fact that it is difficult to learn high-level concepts from downsampled images. We removed this difficulty by using a large dataset consisting of random images downloaded from the internet.2 Feature representations are learned by a sparse deep autoencoder. To scale the model to large images, we use the idea of local receptive fields [23, 15] and many levels of parallelism: model parallelism (parameters are distributed across machines) and data parallelism (data are distributed across machines).\nExperimental results reveal that it is indeed possible to build high-level features with unlabeled data. In particular, using a hold-out test set consisting of faces and random distractors, we discovered a feature that is highly selective for faces. This further confirms the power of deep networks in learning invariant feature representations [7, 8]."

      "heading" : "2 Dataset constructions",
      "text" : "Our dataset is constructed by sampling frames from 10 million YouTube videos. To avoid duplicates, each video contributes only one image to the dataset. Each image has 200x200 pixels and three RGB channels. We then whiten each image by convolving it with fixed on-center off-surround kernels on each channel (similar to local contrast normalization) [13].\nThis dataset is assembled with the goal of representing the experience of a one and a half year old baby without any supervision. Specifically, if each frame represents 5 seconds then our dataset with 10 million images can be as long as 1.5 years.\nTo check the percentage of faces in the dataset, we also ran a face detector in openCV.3\n1This argument, often credited to G. Hinton and cited as motivations in [22], is somewhat widely held in neuroscience.\n2This is different from the work of [19] who trained their model on images from one class. 3http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/\nThis experiment shows that the percentage of faces is approximately 17% in the dataset. However, the positions, orientations, scales of these faces are quite diverse. In section 9, we also show a control experiment on dataset where images, that have faces, are intentionally removed."

      "heading" : "3 Algorithm",
      "text" : "Our work is inspired by recent successful algorithms in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning [20, 9, 1, 24, 18]. In particular, in their seminal work, Olshausen and Field [20] discovered sparse coding, an unsupervised learning principle, that yields receptive fields having properties like those of V1 simple cells. These properties in turn were characterized by [11, 12].\nA shortcoming of early approaches such as sparse coding [20] is that their architectures are shallow and typically shown to capture simple variations (or learned features such as edge detectors). This issue is tackled by recent work of [9, 1, 19] who extend sparse coding to build hierarchies of feature representations. In particular, Lee et al [19] have shown that a convolutional DBNs, trained on images of faces, can learn a decent face detector. This result is interesting but not striking given the fact that the training images (i.e., Caltech 101 images) are homogenous and belong to one selected category.\nOur algorithm is built upon these ideas, especially [15]. In particular, our feature learning algorithm can be viewed as a deep autoencoder with sparsity. To scale these autoencoders to large images, we use a simple idea known as local receptive fields [17, 23, 19, 15]. Specifically, each feature in the autoencoder can connect only to a small region of the lower layer. Fur-\nthermore, to achieve spatial invariances, we employ a technique known as pooling [17, 19].4\nOur deep autoencoder with pooling has three layers. The structure of one layer and its parameters are shown in Figure 1. As can be seen, this layer consists of two sublayers.\nNeurons in each sublayer only connect to a small area of the lower sublayer. In our experiments, the first sublayer has receptive fields of 18x18 and the second sublayer has receptive fields of 5x5 (also known as pooling size). The neurons in the first sublayer connect to pixels in all input channels (or maps) whereas the neurons in the second sublayer connect to pixels of only one channel (or map). The neurons on the second sublayer are also known as pooling neurons. The activation function of the first sublayer is square whereas the activation of the second sublayer is squareroot.\nThe overall network is constructed by replicating this architecture three times, resulting in 6 sublayers. This style of stacking a series of uniform structures is reminiscent of HMAX [25] and Neocognition [6] approaches.\nDuring parameter learning, the parameters of the second sublayers (H) are fixed. There are two sets of parameters associated with the first sublayer, encoding weights W1 and decoding weights W2. These two sets of weights are adjusted using the following optimization problem\nminimize W1,W2 m∑ i=1 (∥∥W2W T1 x(i) − x(i)∥∥22 + k∑ j=1 √ +Hj(W1x(i))2 ) . (1)\nThis optimization problem is also known as reconstruction Topographic Independent Component Analysis [14].5 The first term in the objective requires the features to be able to encode important information about the data, i.e., they can reconstruct input data. The second term encourages pooling features to group similar features together to achieve invariances.\nUnlike previous convolutional methods [17, 19], local receptive fields in our model are untied: the weights are different for different locations in the image. In addition to being more biologically feasible, this lets us learn more invariant features other than translational invariances [15].\nSince the weights W1,W2 and H are local, we distribute them to different machines (model parallelism). We also employ data parallelism and distribute the computation over data examples to many machines. The algorithm is implemented on a cluster with fast network hardware. We used stochastic gradient descent with a minibatch of 100 and trained the network on a cluster with 1000 machines for one week.\n4There are many types of pooling such as mean pooling, max pooling [17] and square-squareroot pooling [15] but in this work we will use the last type of pooling because it allows the learning of invariant features [13, 15]. For learned invariances when the same algorithm is trained on natural images, see http://cs.stanford.edu/∼quocle/TCNNweb/index.html\n5In [14], the encoding weights and the decoding weights are tied: W1 = W2. However, for better parallelism and better features, we used the version without tied weights."

There are 13026 faces sampled from non-aligned Labeled Faces in The Wild.6 The rest are distractor objects randomly sampled from ImageNet. These images are resized to 80x80, padded by zeros and placed in the center area of the 200x200 image. The placement is carried out such that i) all images are aligned and have the same size and ii) the central pixel of the 80x80 image is at (100,80) in the larger image (see Figure 2). In later sections, we will assess how learned features change with respect to changes in position and scale of the object within the larger image.\n6http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz\nIn Figure 4, we show the areas of the test image faces with respect to the covering areas of the receptive fields on each layer."

There are 13026 faces in the test set, so guessing all negative only achieves 64.8%. The best neuron in a one-layered network only achieves 71% accuracy. Best linear filter, among 30000 filters sampled randomly from the training set, only achieves 74%.\nWe visualize histograms of activation values for face images and random images in Figure 5. It can be seen that, even with totally unlabeled data, the neuron learns to differentiate between faces and random distractors. Specifically, when we give a face as an input image, the neuron tends to fire with activation value larger than the threshold, 10. In contrast, if we give a random image as an input image, the neuron tends to fire with activation value less than 10."

The results show that the neuron is quite robust to those changes (especially scale)."

To answer this question, we trained a simple feature learning algorithm on a large dataset of images (10 million images, each image is 200x200). The simulation is performed on a cluster of 1000 machines with fast network hardware for one week. Extensive experimental results reveal surprising evidence that such high-level concepts can indeed be learned using only unlabeled data and a simple learning algorithm.",
