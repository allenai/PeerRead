      "text" : "While multi-document summarization is wellstudied in the NLP literature (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Gillick and Favre, 2009; Lin and Bilmes, 2011; Nenkova and McKeown, 2011), single-document summarization (McKeown et al., 1995; Marcu, 1998; Mani, 2001; Hirao et al., 2013) has received less attention in recent years and is generally viewed as more difficult. Content selection is tricky without redundancy across multiple input documents as a guide and simple positional information is often hard to beat (Penn and Zhu, 2008). In this work, we tackle the single-document problem by training an expressive summarization model on a large nat-\n1Available at http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu\nurally occurring corpus—the New York Times Annotated Corpus (Sandhaus, 2008) which contains around 100,000 news articles with abstractive summaries—learning to select important content with lexical features. This corpus has been explored in related contexts (Dunietz and Gillick, 2014; Hong and Nenkova, 2014), but to our knowledge it has not been directly used for singledocument summarization.\nTo increase the expressive capacity of our model we allow more aggressive compression of individual sentences by combining two different formalisms—one syntactic and the other discursive. Additionally, we incorporate a model of anaphora resolution and give our system the ability rewrite pronominal mentions, further increasing expressivity. In order to guide the model, we incorporate (1) constraints from coreference ensuring that critical pronoun references are clear in the final summary and (2) constraints from syntactic and discourse parsers ensuring that sentence realizations are well-formed. Despite the complexity of these additional constraints, we demonstrate an efficient inference procedure using an ILPbased approach. By training our full system endto-end on a large-scale dataset, we are able to learn a high-capacity structured model of the summarization process, contrasting with past approaches to the single-document task which have typically been heuristic in nature (Daumé and Marcu, 2002; Hirao et al., 2013).\nWe focus our evaluation on the New York Times Annotated corpus (Sandhaus, 2008). According to ROUGE, our system outperforms a document prefix baseline, a bigram coverage baseline adapted from a strong multi-document system (Gillick and Favre, 2009), and a discourse-informed method from prior work (Yoshida et al., 2014). Imposing discursive and referential constraints improves human judgments of clarity of both language and referential structure—outperforming the method of\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n08 88\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n9 M\nar 2\n01 6\nYoshida et al. (2014) and approaching the clarity of a sentence-extractive baseline—and still achieves substantially higher ROUGE score than either method. These results indicate that our model has the expressive capacity to extract important content, but is sufficiently constrained to ensure fluency is not sacrificed as a result.\nPast work has explored various kinds of structure for summarization. Some work has focused on improving content selection using discourse structure (Louis et al., 2010; Hirao et al., 2013), topical structure (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), or related techniques (Mithun and Kosseim, 2011). Other work has used structure primarily to reorder summaries and ensure coherence (Barzilay et al., 2001; Barzilay and Lapata, 2008; Louis and Nenkova, 2012; Christensen et al., 2013) or to represent content for sentence fusion or abstraction (Thadani and McKeown, 2013; Pighin et al., 2014). Similar to these approaches, we appeal to structures from upstream NLP tasks (syntactic parsing, RST parsing, and coreference) to restrict our model’s capacity to generate. However, we go further by optimizing for ROUGE subject to these constraints with end-to-end learning."

      "heading" : "2 Model",
      "text" : "Our model is shown in Figure 1. Broadly, our ILP takes a set of textual units u = (u1, . . . , un) from a document and finds the highest-scoring extractive summary by optimizing over variables\nxUNIT = xUNIT1 , . . . , x UNIT n , which are binary indicators of whether each unit is included. Textual units are contiguous parts of sentences that serve as the fundamental units of extraction in our model. For a sentence-extractive model, these would be entire sentences, but for our compressive models we will have more fine-grained units, as shown in Figure 2 and described in Section 2.1. Textual units are scored according to features f and model parameters w learned on training data. Finally, the extraction process is subject to a length constraint of k words. This approach is similar in spirit to ILP formulations of multi-document summarization systems, though in those systems content is typically modeled in terms of bigrams (Gillick and Favre, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Hong and Nenkova, 2014; Li et al., 2015). For our model, type-level n-gram scoring only arises when we compute our loss function in maxmargin training (see Section 3).\nIn Section 2.1, we discuss grammaticality constraints, which take the form of introducing dependencies between textual units, as shown in Figure 2. If one textual unit requires another, it cannot be included unless its prerequisite is. We will show that different sets of requirements can capture both syntactic and discourse-based compression schemes.\nFurthermore, we introduce anaphora constraints (Section 2.2) via a new set of variables that capture the process of rewriting pronouns to make them\nexplicit mentions. That is, xREFij = 1 if we should rewrite the jth pronoun in the ith unit with its antecedent. These pronoun rewrites are scored in the objective and introduced into the length constraint to make sure they do not cause our summary to be too long. Finally, constraints on these variables control when they are used and also require the model to include antecedents of pronouns when the model is not confident enough to rewrite them."

      "heading" : "2.1 Grammaticality Constraints",
      "text" : "Following work on isolated sentence compression (McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008) and compressive summarization (Lin, 2003; Martins and Smith, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Woodsend and Lapata, 2012; Almeida and Martins, 2013), we wish to be able to compress sentences so we can pack more information into a summary. During training, our model learns how to take advantage of available compression options and select content to match human generated summaries as closely possible.2 We explore two ways of deriving units for compression: the RST-based compressions of Hirao et al. (2013) and the syntactic compressions of Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2011).\nRST compressions Figure 2a shows how to derive compressions from Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Carlson et al., 2001). We show a sentence broken into elemen-\n2The features in our model are actually rich enough to learn a sophisticated compression model, but the data we have (abstractive summaries) does not directly provide examples of correct compressions; past work has gotten around this with multi-task learning (Almeida and Martins, 2013), but we simply treat grammaticality as a constraint from upstream models.\ntary discourse units (EDUs) with RST relations between them. Units marked as SAME-UNIT must both be kept or both be deleted, but other nodes in the tree structure can be deleted as long as we do not delete the parent of an included node. For example, we can delete the ELABORATION clause, but we can delete neither the first nor last EDU. Arrows depict the constraints this gives rise to in the ILP (see Figure 1): u2 requires u1, and u1 and u3 mutually require each other. This is a more constrained form of compression than was used in past work (Hirao et al., 2013), but we find that it improves human judgments of fluency (Section 4.3).\nSyntactic compressions Figure 2b shows two examples of compressions arising from syntactic patterns (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011): deletion of the second part of a coordinated NP and deletion of a PP modifier to an NP. These patterns were curated to leave sentences as grammatical after being compressed, though perhaps with damaged fluency or semantic content.\nCombined compressions Figure 2c shows the textual units and requirement relations yielded by combining these two types of compression. On this example, the two schemes capture orthogonal compressions, and more generally we find that they stack to give better results for our final system (see Section 4.3). To actually synthesize textual units and the constraints between them, we start from the set of RST textual units and introduce syntactic compressions as new children when they don’t cross existing brackets; because syntactic compressions are typically narrower in scope, they are usually completely contained in EDUs.\nFigure 2d shows an example of this process: the possible deletion of with Aetna is grafted onto the textual unit and appropriate requirement relations are introduced. The net effect is that the textual unit is wholly included, partially included (with Aetna removed), or not at all.\nFormally, we define an RST tree as Trst = (Srst, πrst) where Srst is a set of EDU spans (i, j) and π : S → 2S is a mapping from each EDU span to EDU spans it depends on. Syntactic compressions can be expressed in a similar way with trees Tsyn. These compressions are typically smallerscale than EDU-based compressions, so we use the following modification scheme. Denote by Tsyn(kl) a nontrivial (supports some compression) subtree of Tsyn that is completely contained in an EDU (i, j). We build the following combined compression tree, which we refer to as the augmentation of Trst with Tsyn(kl):\nTcomb = (S ∪ Ssyn(kl) ∪ {(i, k), (l, j)}, πrst ∪ πsyn(kl)∪ {(i, k)→ (l, j), (l, j)→ (i, k), (k, l)→ (i, k)})\nThat is, we maintain the existing tree structure except for the EDU (i, j), which is broken into three parts: the outer two depend on each other (is a claims adjuster and . from Figure 2d) and the inner one depends on the others and preserves the tree structure from Tsyn. We augment Trst with all maximal subtrees of Tsyn, i.e. all trees that are not contained in other trees that are used in the augmentation process.\nThis is broadly similar to the combined compression scheme in Kikuchi et al. (2014) but we use a different set of constraints that more strictly enforce grammaticality.3"

Many notions of coherence are useful, including centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995) and lexical cohesion (Nishikawa et al., 2014), but one of the most pressing phenomena to deal with is pronoun anaphora (Clarke and Lapata, 2010). Cases of pronouns being “orphaned” during extraction (their antecedents are deleted) are\n3We also differ from past work in that we do not use crosssentential RST constraints (Hirao et al., 2013; Yoshida et al., 2014). We experimented with these and found no improvement from using them, possibly because we have a featurebased model rather than a heuristic content selection procedure, and possibly because automatic discourse parsers are less good at recovering cross-sentence relations.\nThis hasn’t been Kellogg’s year .\nReplacement (2.2.1): If :\nThe oat-bran craze has cost it market share.\nu1\nu2\np1 p2\np3\nAllow pronoun replacement with the predicted antecedent and add the following constraint:\nKelloggit yearit\nNo replacement necessary\nmax(p1, p2, p3) > ↵\nrelatively common: they occur in roughly 60% of examples produced by our summarizer when no anaphora constraints are enforced. This kind of error is particularly concerning for summary interpretation and impedes the ability of summaries to convey information effectively (Grice, 1975). Our solution is to explicitly impose constraints on the model based on pronoun anaphora resolution.4\nFigure 3 shows an example of a problem case. If we extract only the second textual unit shown, the pronoun it will lose its antecedent, which in this case is Kellogg. We explore two types of constraints for dealing with this: rewriting the pronoun explicitly, or constraining the summary to include the pronoun’s antecedent."

Figure 3 shows how this process works. We run the Berkeley Entity Resolution System (Durrett and Klein, 2014) and compute posteriors over possible links for the pronoun. If the coreference system is sufficiently confident in its prediction (i.e. maxi pi > α for a specified threshold α > 12 ), we allow ourselves to replace the pronoun with the first mention of the entity corresponding to the pronoun’s most likely antecedent. In Figure 3, if the system correctly determines that Kellogg is the correct antecedent with high probability, we enable the first replacement shown there, which is used if u2 is included the summary without u1.5\nAs shown in the ILP in Figure 1, we instantiate corresponding pronoun replacement variables xREF where xREFij = 1 implies that the jth pronoun in the ith sentence should be replaced in the summary. We use a candidate pronoun replacement if and only if the pronoun’s corresponding (predicted) entity hasn’t been mentioned previously in the summary.6 Because we are generally replacing pronouns with longer mentions, we also need to modify the length constraint to take this into account. Finally, we incorporate features on pronoun replacements in the objective, which helps the model learn to prefer pronoun replacements that help it to more closely match the human summaries."

Fortunately, the coreference model’s posterior probabilities have been shown to be wellcalibrated (Nguyen and O’Connor, 2015), meaning that cases where it is likely to make errors are signaled by flatter posterior distributions. In this case, we enable a more conservative set of constraints that include additional content in the summary to make the pronoun reference clear without explicitly replacing it. This is done by requiring the inclusion of any textual unit which contains\n5If the proposed replacement is a proper mention, we replace the pronoun just with the subset of the mention that constitutes a named entity (rather than the whole noun phrase). We control for possessive pronouns by deleting or adding ’s as appropriate.\n6Such a previous mention may be a pronoun; however, note that that pronoun would then be targeted for replacement unless its antecedent were included somehow.\npossible pronoun references whose posteriors sum to at least a threshold parameter β. Figure 3 shows that this constraint can force the inclusion of u1 to provide additional context. Although this could still lead to unclear pronouns if text is stitched together in an ambiguous or even misleading way, in practice we observe that the textual units we force to be added almost always occur very recently before the pronoun, giving enough additional context for a human reader to figure out the pronoun’s antecedent unambiguously."

We formulate our learning problem as a standard instance of structured SVM where our loss function is the ROUGE score of the predicted summary with respect to the reference (human) summary. We refer the reader to Smith (2011) for an introduction to structured SVM. We train the model via stochastic subgradient descent on the primal (Ratliff et al., 2007; Kummerfeld et al., 2015). In order to compute the subgradient for a given training example, we need to find the most violated constraint on the given instance through a cost-augmented decode, which generally takes the form argmaxxw\n>f(x)+`(x,y). To use ROUGE as our loss function, we take\n`(xNGRAM,y) = max x∗ ROUGE-1(x∗,y)−ROUGE-1(xNGRAM,y)\ni.e. the difference between the predicted ROUGE score and the oracle ROUGE score achievable under the model (including constraints). Here xNGRAM are indicator variables that track, for each n-gram type in the reference summary, whether that n-gram is present in the system summary. These are the sufficient statistics for computing ROUGE.\nDuring training, we use an extended version of our ILP in Figure 1 that is augmented to explicitly track type-level n-grams during inference:\nmax xUNIT,xREF,xNGRAM [∑ i [ xUNITi (w >f(ui)) ]\n+ ∑ (i,j) [ xREFij (w >f(rij)) ] − `(xNGRAM,y)  subject to all constraints from Figure 1 xNGRAMi = 1 iff an included textual unit or replacement contains the ith reference n-gram\nThese kinds of variables and constraints are common in multi-document summarization systems that score bigrams (Gillick and Favre, 2009 inter alia). Note that since ROUGE is only computed over non-stopword n-grams and pronoun replacements only replace pronouns, pronoun replacement can never remove an n-gram that would otherwise be included.\nFor all experiments, we optimize our objective using AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) with `1 regularization (λ = 10−8, chosen by grid search), with a step size of 0.1 and a minibatch size of 1. We\ntrain for 10 iterations on the training data, at which point held-out model performance no longer improves. Finally, we set the anaphora thresholds α = 0.8 and β = 0.6 (see Section 2.2).

Furthermore, we ask how many unclear pronouns references there were in the text. The Turkers do not see the original document or the reference summary, and rate each summary in isolation. Gillick and Liu (2010) showed that for linguistic quality judgments (as opposed to content judgments), Turkers reproduced the ranking of systems according to expert judgments.\nTo speed up preprocessing and training time on this corpus, we further restrict our training set to only contain documents with fewer than 100 EDUs.

We compare several variants of our system and baselines. For baselines, we use two variants of first k: one which must stop on a sentence boundary (which gives better linguistic quality) and one which always consumes k tokens (which gives better ROUGE). We also use a heuristic sentenceextractive baseline that maximizes the document counts (term frequency) of bigrams covered by the summary, similar in spirit to the multi-document method of Gillick and Favre (2009). We also compare to our implementation of the Tree Knapsack\nmethod of Yoshida et al. (2014), which matches their results very closely on the RST Discourse Treebank when discourse trees are controlled for. Finally, we compare several variants of our system: purely extractive systems operating over sentences and EDUs respectively, our grammaticallyconstrained extractive and compressive system, and our full system that further incorporates pronoun constraints and pronoun replacement.\nIn terms of content selection, we see that all of the systems that incorporate end-to-end learning (under “This work”) substantially outperform our various heuristic baselines. Our full system using the full compression scheme is substantially better on ROUGE than ablations where the syntactic or discourse compressions are removed. These improvements reflect the fact that more compression options give the system more flexibility to include key content words. Removing the anaphora resolution constraints actually causes ROUGE to increase slightly (as a result of granting the model flexibility), but has a negative impact on the linguistic quality metrics.\nOn our linguistic quality metrics, it is no surprise that the sentence prefix baseline performs the best. Our sentence-extractive system also does\nwell on these metrics. Compared to the EDUextractive system with no constraints, our constrained compression method improves substantially on both linguistic quality and reduces the number of unclear pronouns, and adding the pronoun anaphora constraints gives further improvement.

Our model selects textual units to include in the summary based on a rich set of sparse features whose weights are learned on a large corpus. We allow for the deletion of content within a sentence when that deletion is licensed by compression rules; in our framework, these are implemented as dependencies between subsentential units of text. Anaphoricity constraints then improve cross-sentence coherence by guaranteeing that, for each pronoun included in the summary, the pronoun’s antecedent is included as well or the pronoun is rewritten as a full mention. When trained end-to-end, our final system1 outperforms prior work on both ROUGE as well as on human judgments of linguistic quality.",
