      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nThe rise of machine learning and corresponding advent of various deep learning methodologies in recent years hold great promise as such methods are capable of learning rich, non-linear feature representations. Such representations have been shown to be beneficial in a variety of domains, including medicine and public health. This work is concerned with methodology applied to such areas. More specifically, our focus is on exploring different representations of geographical features that can be used to predict colorectal cancer survival curves for patients in the state of Iowa.\nTo elaborate on such a problem, consider Figure 1, which shows colorectal cancer mortality rates, spanning the years 1989 to 2013, by zipcode tabulation area (ZCTA), for the state of Iowa. First, we wish to point out that many zipcodes have mortality rates at or above 30%, which shows the importance of accurately assessing the survival outlook of patients at the time of diagnosis, which may better inform treatment decisions [1]. Secondly, Figure 1 shows that different geographic locations experience different mortality rates. In other words, location appears to have a bearing on survival outlook.\nSurvival outlook-disparity by location is, unfortunately, not unexpected. Geographic location has been shown to have an effect on health care access, thereby affecting colorectal cancer survival outlook [2]. Moreover, environmental factors found to increase the likelihood of developing colorectal cancer\ntend to be spatially grouped (e.g., houses built when leadbased paint was the norm); incorporation of such factors in predictive models have been shown to provide performance improvements\nTherefore, because of the spatially heterogeneous nature of the colorectal cancer mortality manifestation, a major challenge in accurately predicting colorectal cancer patient survival curves is to construct models that are spatially sensitive to patient locale: key factors affecting survival in large cities may be very different from those in rural areas. This work, therefore, explores two different ways of representing geography – termed simple binary representation (SBR) and rich representation – spectral analysis (RR-SA) – for use as features in constructing neural network-based predictive models.\nThe contributions of this work are enumerated as follows:\n1) We investigate whether colorectal cancer patient survival curves can be reasonably predicted for patients in the state of Iowa. 2) We examine whether geographical features improve the accuracy of survival curve predictions over models trained without the use of geographic features.\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n04 71\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n5 A\nug 2\n3) We explore a rich representation of geographical features through spectral analysis (RR-SA) of the underlying adjacency graph of the ZCTAs to address the spatial heterogeneity challenge. 4) We determine whether the simple binary representation (SBR) or richer, spectral analysis representation (RR-SA) leads to more accurate survival curve predictions. 5) We propose a new metric – area between curves (ABC) – to assess the quality of survival curve predictions.\nThe remainder of this work proceeds with an outline of our methods of representing geographical features and corresponding neural network architecture associated with each such representation (Section II). Next, we discuss our dataset, which contains 46000 Iowan patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between the years 1989 and 2012, followed by our experiments and results (Section III). Finally, we discuss related work (Section IV) prior to concluding the paper (Section V)."

      "text" : "Let {(x(i), e(i), t(i))}ni=1 be a dataset of n instances, where feature vector x(i) ∈ Rm, event label e(i) ∈ {0, 1}, and time of event occurrence t(i) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , T}. Here, t(i) represents a discrete time at which the event of interest e(i) has occurred (i.e., e(i) = 1) or the last discrete time instance i has been observed and the event has not occurred (i.e., e(i) = 0). In this latter case (e(i) = 0), when t(i) = T we know the event never occurs to the instance during the study period (spanning T discrete time periods). If, however, t(i) < T then we only know that the instance did not experience the event up to t(i), but don’t know what happened during the T − t(i) remaining time. Data having the event-time representation just described are referred to as censored data, or more specifically rightcensored data. An instance i is considered censored when e(i) = 0 and t(i) < T . Censored data, and how we handle them, are elaborated on in a subsequent subsection.\nMore concretely, t ∈ {1, . . . , T} might represent (as in our experiments) six-month patient follow-up periods, with t = 0 being the entrance of patients to the study. Entrance to the study, in this case, occurs when a patient is diagnosed with colorectal cancer. For a particular patient i, e(i) = 1 if i dies from colorectal cancer, and t(i) indicates the time of this occurrence. On the other hand, an individual may move across the country, pass away from a non-colorectal cancer related complication or, for whatever reason, lose contact prior to the end of the study period. In such cases (i.e., t(i) < T ), and when patients are not known to have died from their disease, e(i) = 0.\nEach component of instance vector x(i) represents the measurement (quantification) of a particular feature. Certain groups of these components will be referenced directly later on in this work and we therefore define notation to reference these particular groups of feature values. Let z contain the set of index values that index the geographical features that compose x(i) and let a denote the full set of index values (i.e., a = {1, . . . ,m}). These index sets will be used to reference specific components of x(i); i.e., x(i)z is the subvector of instance i containing geographical feature values, and x(i)a\\z contains non-geographical feature values.\nThe notation related in this and future sections is related, for convenience, by Table I."

      "heading" : "B. Kaplan-Meier Re-representation",
      "text" : "With our preliminary notation defined, we return to elaborating on the censored nature of the data. As mentioned, each instance i has a corresponding event label e(i) and time of event occurrence t(i). We wish, however, to transform this tuple-like representation to one that is in the form of a Kaplan-Meier survival curve (KMSC) [3]. Simply put, a KMSC associates each temporal unit – in this case the values 1, . . . , T – with a probability of event e(i) not occurring up to that particular time for instance i.\nPractically speaking, this re-representation will take the form of a vector y(i) ∈ [0, 1]T , where the indices t̃ ∈ {1, . . . , T} denote the temporal units and the entries y(i)\nt̃ the\ncorresponding probabilities.\nWe adopt the re-representation procedure outlined in Chi et al. [4] to create y(i), which can be expressed as\ny (i)\nt̃ =  1 if t̃ < t(i)\n0 if t̃ ≥ t(i) & e(i) = 1 1− P (e(i)\nt̃ = 1|e(i) t̃−1 = 0) if t̃ ≥ t (i) & e(i) = 0\n(1)\nwhere P (e(i) t̃ = 1|e(i) t̃−1 = 0) denotes the conditional probability of event e occurring at t̃ given that e has not occurred at t̃− 1. Therefore, for patients whose outcomes are known, y(i) contains values of 0 and 1 only, whereas a censored patient’s vector becomes an estimation of survival probability at the indexical location t̃ = t(i)."

      "text" : "Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to learn a hypothesis g∗ ∈ G, belonging to some [currently] arbitrarily defined hypothesis class G, that most accurately predicts patientspecific KMSCs. Formally, this problem can be written as\ng∗ = arg min g∈G\n{ L ( y(i), g(x(i)) ) : i = 1, . . . , n } (2)\nwhere L(·) denotes an arbitrary loss function that measures the disparity between the predicted y(i) (in the future denoted ŷ(i)) and the known y(i).\nIn this work, we define our hypothesis class G to be both shallow and deep neural networks, the specific architecture of which is elaborated on further in this section, with parameterization discussed in the experiments section. We characterize shallow architectures as having one hidden layer and deep architectures as having more than one hidden layer.\n1) Output Smoothing: Neural networks are constructed in layer-wise fashion, with each layer consisting of nodes. The inputs are viewed as the first layer, followed by any number of hidden layers. The last of these hidden layers is connected to the output layer. The nature of the output layer is unique to the problem of predicting KMSCs. First, the output nodes are ordered. That is, we have a predicted probability for each of the t̃ = 1, . . . , T , where nodeout\nt̃ is\nordered before nodeout t̃+1 because t̃ temporally comes before t̃ + 1. More importantly, however, the output elicited from these nodes should strictly decrease in temporal order. In other words, we expect output(i)\nt̃ ≥ output(i) t̃+1 . Intuitively,\neven though a patient may have recovered from their disease, one would never expect the probability of survival to go up. However, because the loss function L(·) typically produces a single value representing the loss across all nodes, the desired strictly decreasing output among temporally ordered output nodes cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, we define a smoothing procedure Smooth(output(i)), given by\nŷ (i) t̃+1 = min{output(i) t̃ , output (i) t̃+1 } for t̃ = 1, . . . , T (3)\nwhich guarantees that the output elicited from the use of a trained model produces strictly decreasing outputs."

      "heading" : "D. Geographic Feature Representation",
      "text" : "While we are ultimately concerned with producing a g that elicits the most accurate predictions, the niche of this work is to:\n1) Show whether geographic-based features improve the quality of predictions. 2) Determine whether a simple binary representation or a richer representation (defined shortly) leads to better predictions.\n3) Experimentally quantify the extent of such improvements.\nWe outline the details of our experiments and data in the next section, where two geographic representations will be explored: a simple binary representation (SBR) and a richer representation produced via spectral analysis (RR-SA).\n1) Simple Binary Representation: The simple binary representation (SBR) is a minimalist representation, involving only (a) determination of instance i’s discrete geographic entity membership and (b) a binary re-representation of such membership (otherwise referred to as one hot encoding), producing a sparse vector with a 1 in the indexical location corresponding to the geographic entity of which i is a member, and 0s in all other locations.\nTo be as general as possible we assume that the current geographic features for each instance i, denoted x(i)z , can be used to obtain the single discrete geographic unit of which i is a member. As an example, in our experiments, we use ZCTA (zipcode tabulation area) as our discrete geographic unit.\nTo formalize the notion of eliciting discrete geographic unit membership, let\nx (i) b = Γ(x (i) z ,M) (4)\nwhere Γ(·) is a function that transforms the geographic feature values of instance i to an ID value, denoted x(i)b , representing the single geography entity in a map M (defined shortly) that i is a member of. Depending upon the geographic information encapsulated by x(i)z , the function Γ(·) and map M may take on different forms.\nIn this work our geographic features are (lat,lon) coordinate pairs. Therefore, we provide a specific definition (Definition 1) outlining the map M that makes use of (lat,lon)-specified geography.\nDefinition 1. Define M to be a map, given by M = {(keyl, valuel)}pl=1 (5)\nwhere keyl is the unique postal code of geographic unit l and valuel is an ordered set of (lat,lon) coordinate pairs denoting the bounding geographic region of l.\nMap M is a continuous geographic region, characterized by{ ∀l∃l′ : valueql = value j l′ for l, l ′ ∈ {1, . . . , p} & l 6= l′ }\n(6)\nwhere valueql = value j l′ , (lat q l = lat j l′) ∩ (lon q l = lon j l′ ).\nGiven our definition of M,Γ(·) is a function that determines whether a point, given by x(i)z , is on the interior of each ZCTA in M. When the ZCTA having x(i)z in the interior is found, x(i)b is set equal to the ZCTA’s identifier. A binarization procedure (one hot encoding), denoted Bin, is applied to x(i)b , thus producing a sparse vector representation.\nFigure 2 illustrates the network architecture using the SBR methodology.\nWhile we expect the addition of SBR features to elicit a hypothesis having some predictive performance improvement\nover a hypothesis employing only non-geographic features, richer representations that better capture the continuous nature of the defined geographic region hold greater promise.\n2) Learning a Rich Geographic Representation: To obtain richer geographic features, we adopt a spectral clusteringbased approach (spectral analysis) to geographical feature rerepresentation. At a high level, this method first computes the geographic adjacency of the discrete entities that comprise M, thus producing an adjacency matrix. Spectral analysis is then performed on this matrix. Spectral analysis involves first solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix. Second, the top (i.e., largest) k eigenvalues are used to select the top k corresponding eigenvectors, forming a p × k matrix. The p rows correspond to the p geographic entities (one row corresponds to one of the p geographic entities). The k values associated with each entity are then used as predictive input features.\nTo express this procedure more formally, let Z = Adj (M) denote the adjacency (i.e., affinity, similarity) matrix, where the l, v-th entry corresponds to the geographic adjacency relationship between the l-th and v-th discrete geographic entities, which is given by\n[Z]l,v =\n{ 1 if Common(valuesl, valuesv) = True\n& l 6= v 0 otherwise\n(7)\nwhere the function Common(·) evaluates whether valuesl and valuesv share a common element. In the context of the M described by Definition 1, Common(·) determines whether or not valuesl and valuesv have at least one coordinate pair in common.\nSpectral clustering is performed by doing qlabel = kMeans (Qspec), where kMeans(·) assigns one of k cluster labels to each of the p column elements using the k-means clustering algorithm, and where\nQspec = Topk (Q,λ) . (8)\nThe function Topk(·) finds the largest values in λ, selects the corresponding columns in Q, and forms the Qspec ∈ Rk×p submatrix. The matrix Q, composed of eigenvectors, and vector λ, composed of eigenvalues, are obtained by solving the system of equations given by\nZQ = λQ. (9)\nPractically speaking, the column-wise elements of Qspec are used as k geographical features when learning g – this is spectral analysis – and the labels qlabel are used for visualization purposes (as in our experiments in the next section) – this is spectral clustering. In other words, instead of using a [necessarily] binarized form of the label assignment elicited from k-means clustering as features, we use the eigenvectors [on which clustering is performed], which preserves cluster composition.\nTo further differentiate spectral clustering from spectral analysis, we detail the spectral clustering procedure in Algorithm 1. Omission of the final line, highlighted in red, yields the spectral analysis procedure used to create the rich representation.\nAlgorithm 1 Spectral Clustering 1: Obtain adjacency matrix Z using (7). 2: Solve (9) for Q and λ. 3: Obtain Qspec as outlined in (8). 4: Apply kMeans clustering to Qspec to obtain qlabel.\nIn other words, spectral analysis is a sub-procedure of spectral clustering, wherein the clustering step is omitted.\nFinally, when an instance x is encountered, a procedure Enrich(xz,M,Qspec) is called that obtains the k-valued column of Qspec that corresponds to the particular geographic entity that x belongs. Enrich is outlined in Algorithm 2.\nAlgorithm 2 Enrich Geographic Features Enrich Input: xz,M,Qspec\n1: xb = Γ(xz,M) From (4). 2: Using xb find the l such that xb = keyl : l ∈ {1, . . . , p}.\nOutput: Return column vector [Qspec]l\nThe network architecture that encapsulates the spectral analysis process is shown in Figure 31."

Each instance represents a patient who has been diagnosed with colorectal cancer and whose residence at the time of diagnosis is in the state of Iowa. The dataset consists of n = 46116 patients and, initially, m = 71 features. After removing identifiers and features having a large number of instances with missing values (% missing > 50%), we were left with m = 26 distinct features (including unprocessed geographic coordinates). After binarizing discrete features, m = 386 (excluding geographic features). When using SBR geographical re-representation, m = 1364 (386 non geographic features and p = 978 binarized geographic features), and m = 386 + k when using the RR-SA geographic representation (where k is parameterized and therefore user-dependent). When the Kaplan-Meier rerepresentation is applied to the dataset, we obtain y(i) vectors having T = 53 elements, where each element represents the patient’s current vital status (alive= 1 or dead= 0), or a probability of survival when an instance becomes censored, as described by (1). Each t̃ ∈ {1, . . . , 53} represents six months.\nThe 24 distinct non-geographic features pertain to various patient-specific characteristics, which can be categorized as disease-based and demographic-based. Disease-based features include tumor grade, tumor histology and tumor marker; we show a histogram of tumor grade in Figure 4. Demographicbased features include marital status, race, and age at diagnosis; we show a histogram of age at diagnosis in Figure 5. These selected features (age and tumor grade) have been shown to be indicative of not receiving timely cancer treatment [5], which we believe will help in predicting cancer survival, although analysis of such factors is beyond the scope of this work."

      "text" : "As outlined in the introduction, we wish to address the following:\n1) On average, can colorectal cancer survival curves be reasonably predicted for patients in the state of Iowa? 2) Do geographic features improve the quality of predicted colorectal cancer survival curves for patients in the state of Iowa? 3) Do richer geographical feature representations improve predictive performance more than simpler representations?\nTo such an end, we propose to use 10-fold validation where, for each fold, we find a g∗ for each of the following types of model:\n(i) A model constructed using no geographical features (No Geo).\n(ii) A model constructed using SBR-derived geographical features, as outlined by Figure 2 (SBR).\n(iii) Models constructed using RR-SA-derived geographical features, as outlined by Figure 3, where the values k = 10, 20, 30, 40 will be explored (RR-SA).\nWe then examine two different factors:\n(a) Each model’s average survival curve prediction on the test set, taken over the 10 folds, as compared to the actual average survival curve, taken over all y(i). We devise a metric we term area between curves (ABC) that measures the area-wise disparity between the two curves. (b) Each model’s mean absolute error in the absence of the output smoothing procedure (described in Section 2.C.1).\n1) Model Parameterization: Our models are constructed using Tensorflow, employing fully connected layers, trained using sigmoidal cross entropy as the loss function L(·). The logistic activation function is used for all nodes. Each model is trained using a maximum of 2500 epochs with a 15% batch size. While the connectedness of the architecture, activation function, epochs, and batch size are all tunable parameters, we elect to focus on finding the optimal number of hidden layers and corresponding hidden nodes for each layer. Table II shows the average optimal architecture for each of the models, taken over the 10 folds.\nIn Table II we can see that, on average, the optimal architecture is relatively comparable among all models with\nthe exception of SBR (and to a degree RR-SA, k = 20). First, this suggests that the addition of rich geographic features, as defined in this work (obtained using spectral analysis), do not affect the architectural complexity of the model. However, SBR seems to significantly increase such complexity. This is somewhat expected, as SBR is represented as a large, sparse vector, which can be contrasted with the comparatively small vector of RR-SA.\n2) Average Actual vs Average Predicted Survival: The results comparing the average actual survival curve against the average predicted survival curve, by model, are presented in Figure 6. Henceforth, these curves will simply be referred to as actual and predicted. In these figures we also shade the region between the actual and predicted curves and provide a value representing the total area covered by this region. We will use this value, henceforth referred to as area between the curves (ABC for short), as a means of comparing the\npredictive quality of the six different models (where lower ABC is better). We also include the mean absolute error for each model, reported as an average over the 53 outputs.\nComparing Figure 6a with Figures 6b through 6f we first see that the addition of geographical features has uniformly improved the quality of the predictions, on average, as can be observed visually and by comparing ABC values. The MAE values in parenthesis support this conclusion.\nSecondly, comparing Figure 6b with Figures 6c through 6f, we observe that models using richer geographical representations (RR-SA) perform better (6c - 6f) than a model trained using a simple representation (6b), again in terms of both ABC and MAE.\nHowever, there are also RR-SA model performance differences depending on the parameterized k value. Interestingly, there seems to exist a non-linear relationship between k and performance, with k = 10 outperforming k = 20, and k = 30 outperforming k = 10; k = 40 performs the best out of all models. We believe this nonlinear relationship may be accounted for by the fact that higher values of k lead to more localized models, yet can also produce sparse, disjointed clusters. This point is supported by our clustering visualizations reported in Figure 8 and discussed in Section III.B.4.\nIn examining the different predicted survival curves we have a few observations, summarized as follows. First, we observe that predictive performance increases are mostly realized after the five-year mark. This is, on one hand, intuitive because predicting survival at times closer to the diagnosis is\neasier than predicting survival at later times. On the other hand, noticeable deviation of the predicted curves uniformly occurs across all models at or around this five-year mark. Therefore, model improvement wrought by using richer geographical representations is realized, by-in-large, at times beyond the five-year mark. Explanation as to why such a deviation is present in all models requires further investigation beyond the scope of this work.\nIn summary, we find that\n1) On average, colorectal cancer survival curves can be reasonably predicted for patients in the state of Iowa. 2) Geographic features do improve the quality of predicted colorectal cancer survival curves for patients in the state of Iowa by 25% (on average). 3) On average, richer geographical feature representations improve predictive performance by 15% over simpler representations.\n3) Model Errors: To further examine model performance we compare the mean absolute error of each of the models, measured at each time unit. The results comparing average error by model type are presented in Figure 7. Note that we report these error results without using the post-processing technique described in Section II.C.1 (output smoothing). We do this to provide a slightly different look at model performance over the result presented in Figure 6.\nFirst, it is clear that all models seem to follow a similar pattern in terms of the observed error by output node, which is also found when comparing average model output in Figure 6. However, further examination reveals differences in model performance. Interestingly, SBR appears to outperform the other models at certain time point predictions toward the middle and end of the study period (t̃ ≈ 30, 40). This suggests that SBR may perform better were the smoothing method to have not been used. However, practically speaking, there is no circumstance in which one would want to discontinue use of such a method, but does seem to suggest that, intuitively, optimization methodology applying greater weight/emphasis to accurately learning “earlier” output nodes over “later” nodes may be beneficial.\n4) Visualizing Geographic Cluster Assignment: Next, we briefly discuss the results of visualizing cluster assignment for\nk = 10, 20, 30, 40. These results can be observed in Figure 8, where each color represents a single cluster.\nWe first note that as k increases, the elicited geographic regions become more precise, yet maintain geographic continuity. However, we secondly observe that some ZCTAs are not adjacent to any other ZCTA having the same cluster assignment. This disjointedness stems from the use of an adjacency representation of the affinity matrix on which spectral clustering is performed and is not unexpected. As k increases it appears that the number of disjointed ZCTAs also increases. However, we see that the number of continuous regions also increases. In other words, while disjointedness seems to increase with k, the desired result of more localized continuous geographical regions is still achieved. Interestingly, when k = 40, larger Iowa cities such as Des Moines (central Iowa) and Iowa City (central-eastern Iowa) begin to emerge."

      "text" : "The topics related to and discussed throughout this work can best be categorized as disease and survival curve prediction and geographic-based predictions and representation.\nThere are many past works involving the prediction of diseases. These can be viewed as classification-based [6]– [12] and survival-based [4], [10], [13]–[16]. The focus of this work was on survival curve predictions. Such works can be examined by method, which include Cox proportional hazards model (CPH) [13], which has been historically used to make such predictions, decision trees [14], and neural networkbased models [4], [10], [15], [16], which are a more recent development. However, as Laurentiis and Ravdin [17] point out, CPH has several caveats as compared to neural networkbased approaches, including the naivety of the proportional hazards assumption and inability to capture nonlinear feature interactions. Furthermore, decision trees are constructed using greedy methodology and do not have the architectural benefits of neural networks. Hence, this work employed neural networks.\nThere are also many works focusing on geographic-based prediction and representation. These works focus on incorporating geographical features into the predictive process. One method of representing geography is by fine grain lattice (i.e., grid) [18], [19]. Such methods are akin to our SBR representation and suffer from the same shortcomings. Spatially adaptive filters [20], which can tie a single feature to geography when creating M, which may be beneficial when the selected feature is particularly indicative of survival. This method would, however, still produce a binary feature representation, having the accompanying shortcomings discussed when disclosing SBR. Spectral clustering has been used to cluster both social networks [21] and for representing geospatial features [22], [23], as in this work, and produces a rich (i.e., non-sparse) vector of features."

In this work, we use these models to explore the use of geographical features in predicting colorectal cancer survival curves for patients in the state of Iowa, spanning the years 1989 to 2012. Specifically, we compare model performance using a newly defined metric – area between the curves (ABC) – to assess (a) whether survival curves can be reasonably predicted for colorectal cancer patients in the state of Iowa, (b) whether geographical features improve predictive performance, and (c) whether a simple binary representation or richer, spectral clustering-based representation perform better. Our findings suggest that survival curves can be reasonably estimated on average, with predictive performance deviating at the five-year survival mark. We also find that geographical features improve predictive performance, and that the best performance is obtained using richer, spectral analysis-elicited features.",
