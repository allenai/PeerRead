      "text" : "In knowledge representation, it is often necessary to characterize the context associated to a statement, such as when and how it was generated, or who uttered it. However, RDF and OWL can only represent natively binary relations [12]. Many models exist for providing statements about statements, some of which are specific to a certain “dimension” of context, such as temporal validity.\nAlong these lines, in 2006, Welty and Fikes [17] proposed an ontology for describing fluents (i.e., entities whose characteristics change over time). Their approach advanced the state of the art in temporal representation, and has been used and extended in other works, but it only addresses one dimension characterizing a statement. Nonetheless, Welty and Fikes’s approach can be extended so that any number of context’s dimensions can be represented. We propose this extension through a generic ontology that can be extended to implement any specific dimension of context. In addition, we address the problem of modeling contextual datatype properties, as well as combining different contextual dimensions. This work is motivated by the need to characterize web datasets in terms of trust, provenance, and temporal validity, in the context of a question answering system within the WDAqua project.1\n1http://wdaqua.informatik.uni-bonn.de\nIn reference to the original 4dFluents ontology, we call our ontology NdFluents. We recall Welty and Fikes’s contribution in Section 2, then we present the NdFluents ontology in Section 3 together with some issues. In Section 4, we summarize guidelines for expressing contextualized statements, and apply these guidelines to a concrete use case that we published according to the Web of Data best practices. We then compare our approach to related work on representing the context of information in Section 5 before concluding."

      "text" : "Welty and Fikes [17] address the problem of representing fluents, i.e., relations that hold within a certain time interval and not in others. They address the issue from the perspective of diachronic identity (that is, how an entity looks to be different at different times), showcasing the two different ways of tackling it:\n• The endurantist (3D) view maintains a differentiation between endurants, entities that are present at all times during its whole existence, and perdurants, events affecting an entity during a definite period of time during the entity’s existence. • The perdurantist (4D) view argues that entities themselves have to be handled as perdurants, i.e., temporal parts of a four dimensional meta-entity. Instead of making an assertion about some entities, such as “Paris is the capital of France”, one should make the assertion about their temporal parts: “A temporal part of Paris (since 508 up to now) is the capital of a temporal part of France (since 508 up to now)”.\nWelty and Fikes adopt the perdurantist approach to create the 4dFluents ontology, representing entities at a time and using them as resources for their statements. The 4dFluents ontology expressed in OWL2 Functional Syntax is shown in Ontology 1.\nIn order to use the ontology for describing fluents, one has to introduce axioms at the terminological level (TBox) as well as assertions in the knowledge base (ABox). For instance, if one wants to say that “Paris is the capital of France” since 508, the relation “capital of” has to be a subproperty of fluentProperty and new individuals have to be introduced for the temporal part of Paris and of France, as shown in Ontology 2.\nWelty and Fikes argue that, although there are various other ways of modelling fluents, the 4dFluents approach has proved being efficient in projects led by the authors. Based on these observations, we in turn think that adopting a similar approach, generalized to any dimension of context, would be a sensible choice."

      "text" : "A temporal part of an entity can be viewed as an individual context dimension of the entity. A similar approach can then be used to represent different dimensions, such as provenance or confidence. Continuing with our running example, if Wikipedia states that “Paris is the capital of France”, we can articulate that fact as “A Paris as defined by Wikipedia is the capital of France as defined by Wikipedia”. Different context dimensions of an entity could then be combined if applicable, allowing to represent complex information, such as: “A temporal part Paris as defined by Wikipedia is the capital of a temporal part of France as defined by Wikipedia”.\nWe use this idea to extend the 4dFluents ontology for any context dimension in the NdFluents ontology. The ontology, shown in Ontology 3, and published in http://www.emse.fr/~zimmermann/ndfluents.html, is a direct extension from temporal parts to contextual parts.\nNote that FunctionalObjectProperty( nd:contextualExtent ) axiom is not included.

Depending on the model used to represent the information, it will be necessary to add it (see Section 3.3).\nThe NdFluents ontology is meant to be implemented for different context dimensions in a modular way. In this sense, the 4dFluents ontology can be seen as a concrete implementation of NdFluents, as we show in Ontology 4. In Figure 1 we show the representation of a statement with temporal context using this ontology. The non-dashed parts are equivalent to the original 4dFluents ontology, while the dashed parts correspond to the NdFluents extension. Other context dimensions, such as provenance, can be modeled similarly to the temporal dimension by replacing TemporalPart with ProvenancePart, temporalExtent with provenanceExtent, Interval with Provenance, and temporalPartOf with provenancePartOf. Additionally, an assertion like “Paris is the capital of France, according to Wikipedia” can be modeled following the same pattern as in Ontology 2, replacing the property and class names with their counterpart in the provenance dimension."

      "heading" : "3.3. Combining Different Context Dimensions",
      "text" : "An important scenario where NdFluents becomes relevant is when the necessity of combining two or more dimensions of context arises, such as saying that “according to Wikipedia, Paris is the capital of France since 508”. The NdFluents ontology supports different ways of representing the information. In this section we describe the most relevant models that can be used.\nContexts in Context. One possible model to represent information using different context dimensions is to relate a Contextual Part to another Contextual Part. This approach can be taken when the “first level” Contextual Parts are relevant facts of the knowledge base, and the intention is to state additional information about them. To be able to reason about different contextual levels of any entity, it is desirable for the contextualPartOf property to be transitive, which can be achieved by adding the axiom of Ontology 6.\nWhile data about different context dimensions can be more fine-grained using this model, it also grows in complexity. For example, in Figure 3 the statement capitalOf is related to the provenance dimension Contextual Part Paris@1.1. This information is in no way related to the Temporal Part Paris@1. While we could have this statement duplicated in the example, this is not possible as soon as we add another provenance Contextual Part to Paris@1.1. We believe that this model can be useful in some specific cases, but it is usually too cumbersome.\nPrefix( nd:=<http://purl.org/NET/ndfluents#> ) Ontology( <http://purl.org/NET/ndfluents/transitivecontextualpartof>\nTransitiveObjectProperty( nd:contextualPartOf )\n)\nOntology 6: Transitive axiom for NdFluents ontology\nUse Multiple Contexts for each Contextual Part. A more generic approach for representing entities with more than one contextual dimension is to have Contextual Parts with more than one Contextual Extent. Using this model, only one Contextual Part is created for a combination of context dimensions. This Contextual Part is then related to all the related contextual information, as shown in Figure 4. This model is easier to model: Relating the Contextual Part with the context dimensions is straightforward. It also avoids ambiguity when modelling contextual information related to more than one contextual dimension, and reduces the number of resources in the ontology (i.e., while the previous model needed one Contextual Part for each context dimension involved, this approach only requires one Contextual Part). Note that contextualPartOf is a functional property, which means that there cannot be a Contextual Part of more than one entity.\nCombine Different Contexts on one Contextual Extent. Finally, a third possibility is to create Contextual Extents that combine two or more context dimensions, and enforce a limit of only one Contextual Extent per Contextual Part. This model adds a layer of complexity to the previous approach, but it can be useful to require a specific combination of context dimensions on a set of Contextual Parts. This can be achieved by adding the axiom in Ontology 7.\nWe show an example of this approach on Figure 5. Note that the combined classes and properties are subclasses and subproperties of the corresponding classes and properties of the two context dimensions they are combining (e.g., Temporal+ProvenancePart is subclass of TemporalPart and ProvenancePart). As a result, querying and reasoning can be performed in an identical way as the previous approach.\nPrefix( nd:=<http://purl.org/NET/ndfluents#> ) Ontology( <http://purl.org/NET/ndfluents/functionalcontextualextent> FunctionalObjectProperty( nd:contextualExtent ) )\nOntology 7: Functional Contextual Extents axiom for NdFluents ontology"

While this can be convenient for individual cases, it is often needed for a contextual property to be related to Contextual Parts of the same dimension of context. In this case, it is necessary to add the appropriate axioms to the ontology. In Ontology 8 we show the needed axioms to include this restriction on the Temporal Parts.

      "text" : "In the previous sections, we show how to define and use NdFluents to define properties that apply to contextual parts. However, in some cases, we would rather reuse existing ontologies. It is not always possible to add a subproperty relationship between an already defined property and a contextual property because most restrictions will not hold for the contextual parts of an entity. For instance, let us suppose that the property capitalOf has domain City, and we use it as a fluent property in Figure 1. Then, it would be inferred that Paris@1 is a city, instead of Paris being inferred as a city. There might be also a problem if an InverseFunctionalObjectProperty is used in two different contextual parts of an entity with the same object (e.g., Paris@508 and Paris@2016 both being capitalOf France), because then they would be inferred to be the same entity.\nTo address this situation, instead of using the original properties, it is necessary to create new properties that are somehow related to the original. It is then necessary to model the new properties using Class Expressions for the restrictions.

This classification evolved from the historic view of animal and plant kingdoms, while more recent classifications include up to eight kingdoms.

      "text" : "In order to model a knowledge base with a number of context dimensions, it is necessary to model the ontology in the TBox, and then create the statements in the ABox using the ontology. The ontology can be modeled according to the following steps:\n1. For each context dimension, create the appropriate subclass of ContextualPart, and a subclass of Context (such as TemporalPart and Interval for temporal dimension). 2. For each context dimension, create a subproperty of contextualExtent and contextualPartOf (such as provenanceExtent and provenancePartOf for Provenance dimension). 3. If any contextual part includes datatype properties, it has to be decided whether to use the datatype restriction axioms (Ontology 5). We advise to include them to improve reasoning capabilities. 4. If there is more than one context dimension in the ontology, the model to represent the information needs to be selected (see Section 3.3). We recommend to use the second approach (use different Contexts for each Contextual Part, see Figure 4). If Contexts in Context (Figure 3) is used, the transitivity axiom to the contextualPartOf property (Ontology 6) needs to be added. If combine different contexts in Contextual Extents (third approach) is used, create the combined subclasses of ContextualPart and Context, and the combined subproperties of contextualExtent and contextualPartOf, as shown in Figure 5. 5. If there is more than one context dimension, it is possible to use the same contextual properties for every dimension or create a different subproperty of contextualProperty for each one (see Section 3.4). For the last case, the context restrictions axioms (see Ontology 8 for temporal dimension) need to be added for each dimension. We recommend to include these axioms.\nOnce the ontology is modeled, the next series of steps are needed to model the contextual statements:\n1. For each context dimension, it is necessary to create the related Context information. This is a new resource of the related Context subclass and the adequate information (interval for temporal context, provenance information for provenance\ncontext, etc.). Depending on the model you choose to represent the information, it is needed to create a different resource for each context of an entity (Figures 3 and 4), or a unique resource that combines the contexts (Figure 5).\n2. For each entity, create its related Contextual Parts. These are new resources with type the appropriate ContextualPart subclasses (e.g., TemporalPart, ProvenancePart). These resources are connected to their non-contextual entity by contextualPartOfsubproperties (temporalPartOf, provenancePartOf), and to the information related to the context, modeled as Context resources (i.e., Interval, Provenance), by contextualExtent subproperties (temporalExtent, provenanceExtent.).\nIn the following section, we present an example of a concrete use case where we follow those steps to model a knowledge base."

For this task, we use the information provided by Wikipedia3.\nWe model the TBox according to the steps defined in the previous section for the Temporal and Provenance dimensions. As the population of each period will be defined as datatype properties, we decide to include the datatype restriction axioms (Ontology 5 for temporal dimension, and similarly for the provenance dimension) in step 3. In step 4, we choose to use multiple Contexts for each Contextual Part (Figure 4) to model the information. The resulting TBox will be comprised of ontologies 3, 4, 5, and the corresponding implementation of NdFluents for provenance (equivalent to Ontology 4).\nThe contextual statements are also modeled following the steps of previous section. In step 1, we create the Intervals and the Provenance extents for every period and source. To model Intervals we use the OWL-Time ontology4, while for Provenance Extents we use the PROV-O ontology5 (along with OWL-Time and the Event ontology6 to model the Activity). In step 2, we create the contextual parts corresponding to each period and source for the Earth. Those parts are of type TemporalPart and ProvenancePart, are defined as temporalPartOf and provenancePartOf of Earth, and are connected to their corresponding Intervals and Provenance Extents by temporalExtent and provenanceExtent properties.

      "heading" : "5. Related work",
      "text" : "In this section we describe other solutions to state information about statements. A number of them rely on ontology or modeling techniques, while some others modify or extend the underlying semantic technologies.\nDescriptions and Situations ontology [3] is a work that precedes Welty and Fikes’s that tries to describe “contexts, methods, norms, theories, situations, and models at firstorder, thus allowing a partial specification of those entities”. The descriptions represent conceptual elements (like laws, norms, regulations, crime types, etc.), while the situations represent observable elements (like legal facts, cases, states of affairs, etc.) [5].\nZamborlini and Guizzardi [18] present an alternative work to 4dFluents, where they present two different alternatives to represent temporally changing information in OWL. Both approaches have a similar model to Welty and Fikes’s, where the entities are sliced for different times. The main difference is that in the first one, Individual Concepts and Rigidity, the original individuals are considered as classes. Thus, they are not described by any property, and a new slice has to be created every time that a property changes. On the other hand the second approach, “Objects and Moments”, is based on Relators and Qua-individuals [10], where the individuals are represented by an entity, and their slices inherit its properties. Then, any time a property changes, it is reflected in the original entity. The first approach is more prone to the proliferation of timeslices, and can only guarantee the immutability of original properties only by repetition on every timeslice. The second approach solves those issues at the cost of blurring the details of the changes of individual properties, and it is not clear how inheritance works in OWL.\nIn a later work [19], Zamborlini and Guizzardi focus on solving the issues of the prior approaches for representing events and properties of individuals. They maintain the fluent-like representation for events, but move to an N-ary representation (see below) for properties. However, they still not address the possibility to have more that one domain relation, nor address how inheritance is performed in OWL.\nNdFluents is not the first extension of 4dFluents. There are a number of extension for Spatio-Temporal representations. Batsakis and Petrakis [1, 2] enhance the 4dFluents mechanism with qualitative temporal expressions to represent relations between intervals, and allow the definition of new intervals using this relations. Later, they extend it with several types of qualitative spatial relations and use it for their SOWL query lan-\nguage. Milea et al. develop tOWL [11], an extension of OWL for temporal domains, on top of a 4dFluents layer. Harbelot et al. [6, 7] use tOWL and GeoSPARQL for spatiotemporal representations of entities. Welty [16] generalized later 4dFluents to Context Slices by changing the temporal part and context to contextual part and context, but does not make possible to use more than one context in the same dataset. To the best of our knowledge, NdFluents is the first generic extension of 4dFluents for any number of arbitrary context dimensions.\nKrieger [9], instead of modeling temporal information with RDF, abandon the concept of triples and use quintuples to represent temporal information, where the 4th and the 5th elements represent the starting and ending instant of the event. However, this kind of solution requires tuples with an arbitrary number of elements.\nThere are other approaches to model arbitrary contextual information about entities or statements. Reification7 is the standard W3C model to represent information about an statement, proposed in 2004. A statement is represented as an instance of rdf:statements, which relates to the original triple with the properties rdf:subject, rdf:predicate and rdf:object. However, reification lacks formal semantics to connect the original triple with the reified statement, which disallows any reasoning on the information. N-Ary relations8 were proposed in 2006 to represent relations between more than two individuals, or to describe the relation themselves. In this model, an individual is created to represent the relation, which can be used as the subject for new statements. While N-ary relation are an improvement over reification, it does not allow complete OWL inference. For instance, it is not possible to perform any reasoning involving inverse, transitive or symmetric relationships. Wikidata9 makes use of an specific implementation of N-ary relations, where each entity is related with statement, that in turn can be related to values, qualifiers, or references. The estimated word population, with temporal qualifiers for the date, and references for the provenance, is modeled using this pattern in Wikidata.10 The Singleton Property [13, 14] is a recent proposal to represent information about statements in RDF. A particular instance of the predicate is created for every triple. This instance is related to the original predicate by the singletonPropertyOf property. Then, each statement can be unequivocally referenced using its predicate for attaching additional information. The Singleton Property is an intuitive approach, but it cannot be expressed in OWL and needs to extend the RDF semantics to make reasoning possible.\nGangemi and Presutti [4] perform an empirical analysis of different patterns to represent metadata about statements in RDF and OWL. According to their results, N-ary relations and fluents have the higher reasoning capabilities and the possibility to add new arguments when needed, and also preserve the FOL relation topology. From those, however, only N-ary relations are intuitive, along with N-Quads. On the other hand N-Quads have the least impact in size while fluents have the higher. Scheuermann et al. [15], on the other side, perform a qualitative research that compares user preferences and ability for using different design patterns. In their study the fluents pattern is regarded as the most complicated and less used to model, while making a temporal slice of the predicate (which could be represented using the Singleton Property in RDF) seems more intuitive.\n7http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-mt-20140225/#reification 8https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations 9https://www.wikidata.org 10https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2#P1082\nThe N-ary pattern is the model most frequently used. The model regarded as the most user-friendly is not representable using OWL, because it requires having a predicate as an argument of another (an approximation in RDF could be using N-Quads, though)."

This is to the best of our knowledge, the first generic extension of 4dFluents for any number of arbitrary contextual dimensions. This representation is intended to be extended in a modular way for each desired context dimension in the ontology. We have discussed different possible models that can be used when combining different dimensions, possible additions to consider depending on the data we want to represent, and open issues of the ontology. We have also provided schematic guidelines for using NdFluents and a practical example. Both the ontology and the example are published for public usage. While NdFluents needs the inclusion of more triples and seems less intuitive than any of the alternatives, it allows for a more complete OWL inference within a context (with the exceptions presented in Section 3.5). In addition NdFluents is the only approach where it is possible to add contextual information not only to an statement, but to an entity. The model also allows to retrieve easily all the information within a context for the same entity.\nAs future work, we want to apply this model to real world datasets. Our goal is to exploit the context of information to make the datasets fit for question answering, as well as, determine the most relevant data sources. This includes providing additional information based on the context and helping to find the most trustworthy data for the answer. A particular challenge lies in finding the temporal validity of the facts found in the data.\nAcknowledgement: This project is supported by funding received from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie SkłodowskaCurie grant agreement No 642795."
