      "text" : "The problem of aligning taxonomies is one of the most interesting and relevant issues for knowledge engineers, since it has implications in a wide range of computational problems including file system merging, creation of operating systems distributions, catalog integration, distributed taxonomy search, and so on. The non-deterministic nature of the problem is given by the fact that not even humans are able to identify optimal alignments [6], so the process is highly subjective. This means that its boundaries often go further than the category of an engineering problem what makes difficult to find closed solutions in this area. However, the large amount of people, research groups and resources dedicated to provide solutions in this field, tells us that we are facing a key challenge in order for a convincing way to automatically integrate taxonomic knowledge to become real.\nIn the last years, the need for methods to integrate knowledge has increased. Note that the need for aligning taxonomies comes from the old field of database schema integration [16]. This field was born to work in a unified way with databases which had been developed independently. Nowadays researchers aim to make the techniques for aligning knowledge models flexible and powerful enough\nto work with all kind of database schemas, XML schemas, taxonomies, E/R models, dictionaries, and so on. Therefore, the problem we are facing consists of providing a set of correspondences between the nodes of two taxonomies about the same domain but which have been developed separately [18].\nThe major contribution of this work is the proposal of a 3-step algorithm that is able to analyze the structural information represented by means of a taxonomy. The major advantage of this analysis is that it can allow us to leverage the information inherent to the hierarchical structure of taxonomies to infer correspondences which can allow to automatically merging them in a later step. This is particular relevant in scenarios where taxonomy matching techniques exploiting textual information from the taxonomy nodes cannot operate successfully.\nFrom now on, this work is structured in the following way: The second section describes the state-of-the-art on taxonomy alignment. The third section describes the design and development of the algorithm. Case studies section provides some scenarios where our algorithm can help to solve real problems, including a brief discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal. Finally, we outline the key points of our contribution and propose future research tasks."

      "text" : "The problem of aligning taxonomies have received much attention by the research community since various knowledge based applications, including clustering algorithms, browsing support interfaces, and recommendation systems, perform more effectively when they are supported with domain describing taxonomies, which help to resolve ambiguities and provide context [3]. Furthermore, this problem is of great interest on a number of application areas, especially in scientific [6], business [1] [14], and web data integration [4] [15].\nTaxonomy alignment techniques are able to detect taxonomy concepts that are equivalent. But, when can we say that two concepts are equivalent? If we attend only to the text label for representing the concepts, we can find many examples in everyday life, for instance, lift and elevator or car and automobile seem to be equivalent concepts since they represent the same real idea or object. However, it is well known that when taxonomies are used as knowledge sources, the way users perceive the degree of likeness between pairs of concepts is highly dependent on the domain being explored [3]. Therefore, synonymy between text labels is not always an equivalence indicator, so it is necessary to\nfocus in the context the concepts are being considered.\nExisting taxonomy alignment techniques focus on different dimensions of the problem, including whether data instances are used for matching [10], whether linguistic information and other auxiliary information are available [11], and whether the match is performed for complex structures [13]. Our algorithm fits in this last category.\nAlgorithms implementing techniques for matching complex structures are mostly based on heuristics. Heuristics consider, for example, that elements of two distinct taxonomies are similar if their direct sub-concepts, and/or their direct super-concepts and/or their brother concepts are similar [17]. These structural techniques can be based on a fixed point like that proposed in [8], or can be viewed as a satisfiability problem of a set of propositional formulas [2]. There are also some proposals to align taxonomies supposed to be asymmetric from a structural point of view [5], or to create matching functions by means of a composition of various techniques designed to make best use of the characteristics of the taxonomies [17].\nDespite such advances in matching technologies, taxonomy alignments using linguistic information and other auxiliary information are rarely perfect [9]. In particular, imperfection can be due to homonyms (i.e., nodes with identical concept-names, but possibly different semantics) and synonyms (concepts with different names but same semantics). However, the major advantage of pure structural matching techniques is that finding perfect alignments is possible in many cases."

      "text" : "We approach the problem from the classic perspective, that it is to say, a taxonomy can be defined as a set of concepts that have been hierarchically organized to control the terms belonging to a vocabulary. The goal is to facilitate a number of operations on items from a repository. However, a problem occurs when two item repositories have to be merged, since it is also necessary to merge the two taxonomies which describe them.\nOur contribution to face this problem is the proposal of an efficient 3-step algorithm for the analysis of taxonomies describing such repositories. This analysis could be helpful for solving the problem of heterogeneity between the given taxonomies from a strictly structural point of view in a later step. As a collateral effect, the output data from our algorithm could be also used for exploiting any kind\nof solution involving the use of information from the structure of the given taxonomies. Use cases section will explore this in more detail.\nMore formally, we can define a mapping as an expression that can be written in the form (c, c’, n, R). Where c and c’ are concepts belonging to different taxonomies, R is the relation of correspondence and n is a real number between 0 and 1. n represents the degree of confidence for R. In our work, c and c’ will be concepts represented by means of taxonomy nodes (a.k.a. taxons) which are assigned a rank and can be placed at a particular level in a systematic hierarchy reflecting relationships. Moreover, the relation R which describe how c and c’ are related is going to be of similarity.\nThe algorithm that we propose is divided into three high level steps. The first step is optional since it is only necessary when the given knowledge model is not a taxonomy yet, but another kind of more general model like an graph or an ontology [19].\n1. To convert the knowledge model into a taxonomy (See Algorithm 1).\n2. To store the taxonomy in some parts of a special data structure (See Algorithm 2).\n3. To order and fill the data structure with complementary calculations (See Algorithm 3).\nFinally, it is necessary to call the algorithm (See Algorithm 4). The philosophy of the algorithm consists of detecting the changes in the depths of each taxon in the hierarchy. In this way, it is possible to count the different kinds of neighbors that a concept may have.\nBefore designing the algorithm, it is also necessary to define a data structure (DS) to store the data calculated by the algorithm. The data structure is a linked list with six records in each node: depth, children, brothers, brothers left, same level and name. Table 1 tells us the data type and a brief description of each of these records. In the next subsections, we are going to describe more in depth each of the main steps of the proposed algorithm."

A change to an outer taxon breaks a chain of brothers.\n4. All brothers with a previous position are on the left.\n5. Given a taxon, if the following concept has an inner depth, it is a child.\n6. A chain of children can only be broken by a change to an outer taxon.\n7. An inner taxon (grandson taxon) does not break a chain of children.\nAlgorithm 3 shows us the procedural implementation for this set of rules. The computational complexity of this procedure is low, even in the worst of cases we would have O(n2), since the most complex portion of code can be implemented by means of two simple loops.

This can be done by designing a formula that may allow us to align taxonomies from the point of view of the elements, and from the taxonomy structure. This is possible due to the fact one of the attributes (name) contains information at the element level, so it is possible to exploit this kind of information by\nusing some kind of computational method like the Levenshtein algorithm [7] which is able to calculate similarity between two text strings. In this way, if many attributes (whether structural or textual) are similar, the concepts are also supposed to be similar."

Therefore, the algorithm that we propose is valid for taxonomy alignment, but also for aligning ontologies, directory listings, file systems, operating system distributions, and in general whatever kind of model which can be transformed into a taxonomy. Our algorithm tries to leverage the inherent characteristics from taxonomies to infer correspondences which can allow us to merge them in a later step, even without text labels describing each of the nodes from the taxonomy.\nAs future work, we should work to leverage the good performance of our algorithm by designing a combined alignment strategy. In this work, we have proposed to use each of the attributes with similar weights. However, this strategy could not be optimal in some specific cases. We aim to redefine this strategy so that a preliminary study should try to automatically determine the kind of problem we are facing at a given moment, and dynamically assign higher weights to the most promising taxon attributes.\nSource Code\nAn implementation of this algorithm can be found at https://github.com/jorgemartinezgil/sift"
