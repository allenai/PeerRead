      "text" : "It is also the Classical or Boolean Logic, which has two symbol-values: truth T and falsity F.\nb) The Two Numerical-Valued Logic. It is also the Classical or Boolean Logic, which has two numerical-values: truth 1 and falsity 0. More general it is the Fuzzy Logic, where the truth (T) and the falsity (F) can be any numbers in [0,1] such that T + F = 1.\nEven more general, T and F can be subsets of [0, 1].\n2. Three-Valued Logic\na) The Three Symbol-Valued Logics:\ni) Łukasiewicz ’s Logic: True, False, and Possible. ii) Kleene’s Logic: True, False, Unknown (or Undefined). iii) Chinese philosophy extended to: Yin, Yang, and Neuter (or Femininity, Masculinity, and Neutrality) – as in Neutrosophy. Neutrosophy philosophy was born from neutrality between various philosophies. Connected with Extenics (Prof. Cai Wen, 1983), and Paradoxism (F. Smarandache, 1980). Neutrosophy is a new branch of philosophy that studies the origin, nature, and scope of neutralities, as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra. This theory considers every notion or idea <A> together with its opposite or negation <antiA> and with their spectrum of neutralities <neutA> in between them (i.e. notions or ideas supporting neither <A> nor <antiA>). The <neutA> and <antiA> ideas together are referred to as <nonA>. Neutrosophy is a generalization of Hegel's dialectics (the last one is based on <A> and <antiA> only). According to this theory every idea <A> tends to be neutralized and balanced by <antiA> and <nonA> ideas - as a state of equilibrium. In a classical way <A>, <neutA>, <antiA> are disjoint two by two. But, since in many cases the borders between notions are vague, imprecise, Sorites, it is possible that <A>, <neutA>, <antiA> (and <nonA> of course) have common parts two by two, or even all three of them as well. Such contradictions involves Extenics. Neutrosophy is the base of all neutrosophics and it is used in engineering applications (especially for software and information fusion), medicine, military, airspace, cybernetics, physics.\nb) The Three Numerical-Valued Logic:\ni) Kleene’s Logic: True (1), False (0), Unknown (or Undefined) (1/2), and uses “min” for /\\, “max” for \\/, and “1-” for negation. ii) More general is the Neutrosophic Logic [Smarandache, 1995], where the truth (T) and the falsity (F) and the indeterminacy (I) can be any numbers in [0, 1], then 0 ≤ T + I + F ≤ 3. More general: Truth (T), Falsity (F), and Indeterminacy (I) are standard or nonstandard subsets of the nonstandard interval ]-0, 1+[.\n3. Four-Valued Logic\na) The Four Symbol-Valued Logic i) It is Belnap’s Logic: True (T), False (F), Unknown (U), and Contradiction (C), where T, F, U, C are symbols, not numbers. Below is the Belnap’s conjunction operator table:\nTable 1.\nRestricted to T, F, U, and to T, F, C, the Belnap connectives coincide with the connectives in Kleene’s logic. ii) Let G = Ignorance. We can also propose the following two 4-Symbol Valued Logics: (T, F, U, G), and (T, F, C, G). iii) Absolute-Relative 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-Symbol Valued Logics [Smarandache, 1995]. Let TA be truth in all possible worlds (according to Leibniz’s definition); TR be truth in at last one world but not in all worlds; and similarly let IA be indeterminacy in all possible worlds; IR be indeterminacy in at last one world but not in all worlds; also let FA be falsity in all possible worlds; FR be falsity in at last one world but not in all worlds; Then we can form several Absolute-Relative 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-Symbol Valued Logics just taking combinations of the symbols TA, TR, IA, IR, FA, and FR.\nAs particular cases, very interesting would be to study the Absolute-Relative 4-Symbol Valued Logic (TA, TR, FA, FR), as well as the Absolute-Relative 6-Symbol Valued Logic (TA, TR, IA, IR, FA, FR).\nb) Four Numerical-Valued Neutrosophic Logic: Indeterminacy I is refined (split) as U = Unknown, and C = contradiction. T, F, U, C are subsets of [0, 1], instead of symbols; This logic generalizes Belnap’s logic since one gets a degree of truth, a degree of falsity, a degree of unknown, and a degree of contradiction. Since C = T/\\F, this logic involves the Extenics."

Seven-Valued Logic\na) Seven Symbol-Valued Neutrosophic Logic [Smarandache, 1995]: I is refined (split) as U, C, G, but T also is refined as TA = absolute truth and TR = relative truth, and F is refined as FA = absolute falsity and FR = relative falsity.

      "text" : "a) The n-Symbol-Valued Refined Neutrosophic Logic [Smarandache, 1995]. In general: T can be split into many types of truths: T1, T2, ..., Tp, and I into many types of indeterminacies: I1, I2, ..., Ir, and F into many types of falsities: F1, F2, ..., Fs,, where all p, r, s ≥ 1 are integers, and p + r + s = n.\nAll subcomponents Tj, Ik, Fl are symbols for j∈{1,2,…,p}, k∈{1,2,…,r}, and l∈{1,2,…,s}. If at least one Ik = Tj /\\ Fl = contradiction, we get again the Extenics.\nb) The n-Numerical-Valued Refined Neutrosophic Logic. In the same way, but all subcomponents Tj, Ik, Fl are not symbols, but subsets of ]-0, 1+[, for all j ∈ {1,2,…,p}, all k ∈ {1,2,…,r}, and all l ∈ {1,2,…,s}. Even more: T, I, and/or F (or any of their subcomponents Tj ,Ik, and/or Fl) can be countable or uncountable infinite sets. If all sources of information that separately provide neutrosophic values for a specific subcomponent are independent sources, then in the general case we consider that each of the subcomponents Tj, Ik, Fl is independent with respect to the others and it is in the non-standard set ]-0, 1+[. Therefore per total we have for crisp neutrosophic value subcomponents Tj, Ik, Fl that:\n1 1 1 0\np r s\nj k l j k l T I F n− + = = = ≤ + + ≤   (1)\nwhere of course n = p + r + s as above.\nIf there are some dependent sources (or respectively some dependent subcomponents), we can treat those dependent subcomponents together. For example, if T2 and I3 are dependent, we put them together as -0 ≤ T2 + I3 ≤ 1+. The non-standard unit interval ]-0, 1+[ , used to make a distinction between absolute and relative truth/indeterminacy/falsehood in philosophical applications, is replaced for simplicity with the standard (classical) unit interval [0, 1] for technical applications.\nFor at least one Ik = Tj /\\ Fl = contradiction, we get again the Extenics."

      "text" : "a) n-Norm and n-Conorm defined on combinations of t-Norm and t-Conorm\nEven more: T, I, and/or F (or any of their subcomponents Tj , Ik, and/or Fl) can be countable or uncountable infinite sets.\nThe n-norm is actually the neutrosophic conjunction operator, NEUTROSOPHIC AND (/\\n); while the n-conorm is the neutrosophic disjunction operator, NEUTROSOPHIC OR (\\/n).\nOne can use the t-norm and t-conorm operators from the fuzzy logic in order to define the n-norm and respectively n-conorm in neutrosophic logic:\nn-norm( (Tj)j={1,2,…,p}, (Ik)k={1,2,…,r}, (Fl)l={1,2,…,s} ) = (2)\n( [t-norm(Tj)]j={1,2,…,p}, [t-conorm(Ik)]k={1,2,…,r}, [t-conorm(Fl)]l={1,2,…,s} )\nand\nn-conorm( (Tj)j={1,2,…,p}, (Ik)k={1,2,…,r}, (Fl)l={1,2,…,s} ) = (3)\n( [t-conorm(Tj)]j={1,2,…,p}, [t-norm(Ik)]k={1,2,…,r}, [t-norm(Fl)]l={1,2,…,s} )\nand then one normalizes if needed.\nSince the n-norms/n-conorms, alike t-norms/t-conorms, can only approximate the interconnectivity between two n-Valued Neutrosophic Propositions, there are many versions of these approximations.\nFor example, for the n-norm:\nthe indeterminate (sub)components Ik alone can be combined with the t-conorm in a pessimistic way [i.e. lower bound], or with the t-norm in an optimistic way [upper bound];\nwhile for the n-conorm:\nthe indeterminate (sub)components Ik alone can be combined with the t-norm in a pessimistic way [i.e. lower bound], or with the t-conorm in an optimistic way [upper bound].\nIn general, if one uses in defining an n-norm/n-conorm for example the t-norm min{x, y} then it is indicated that the corresponding t-conorm used be max{x, y}; or if the t-norm used is the product x·y then the corresponding t-conorm should be x+y-x·y; and similarly if the t-norm used is max{0, x+y-1} then the corresponding t-conorm should be min{x+y, 1}; and so on.\nYet, it is still possible to define the n-norm and n-conorm using different types of t-norms and tconorms.\nb) N-norm and n-conorm based on priorities. For the n-norm we can consider the priority: T < I < F, where the subcomponents are supposed to conform with similar priorities, i.e. T1 < T2 <... < Tp < I1 < I2 < ... <Ir < F1 < F2 < ...< Fs. (4) While for the n-conorm one has the opposite priorities: T > I > F, or for the refined case:\nT1 > T2 >... > Tp > I1 > I2 > ... >Ir > F1 > F2 > ...> Fs. (5)\nBy definition A < B means that all products between A and B go to B (the bigger).\nLet’s say, one has two neutrosophic values in simple (non-refined case):\n(Tx, Ix, Fx) (6)\nand\n(Ty, Iy, Fy). (7)\nApplying the n-norm to both of them, with priorities T < I < F, we get:\n(Tx, Ix, Fx) /\\n (Ty, Iy, Fy) = (TxTy, TxIy + TyIx + IxIy, TxFy + TyFx + IxFy + IyFx + FxFy) (8)\nApplying the n-conorm to both of them, with priorities T > I > F, we get:\n(Tx, Ix, Fx) \\/n (Ty, Iy, Fy) = (TxTy + TxIy + TyIx + TxFy + TyFx, IxIy +IxFy + IyFx, FxFy). (9)\nIn a lower bound (pessimistic) n-norm one considers the priorities T < I < F, while in an upper bound (optimistic) n-norm one considers the priorities I < T < F.\nWhereas, in an upper bound (optimistic) n-conorm one considers T > I > F, while in a lower bound (pessimistic) n-conorm one considers the priorities T > F > I.\nVarious priorities can be employed by other researchers depending on each particular application.\n8. Particular Cases If in 6 a) and b) one has all Ik = 0, k = {1,2,…,r}, we get the n-Valued Refined Fuzzy Logic.\nIf in 6 a) and b) one has only one type of indeterminacy, i.e. k =1, hence I1 = I > 0, we get the n-Valued Refined Intuitionistic Fuzzy Logic.\n9. Distinction between Neutrosophic Physics and Paradoxist Physics Firstly, we make a distinction between Neutrosophic Physics and Paradoxist Physics.\na) Neutrosophic Physics. Let <A> be a physical entity (i.e. concept, notion, object, space, field, idea, law, property, state, attribute, theorem, theory, etc.), <antiA> be the opposite of <A>, and <neutA> be their neutral (i.e. neither <A> nor <antiA>, but in between). Neutrosophic Physics is a mixture of two or three of these entities <A>, <antiA>, and <neutA> that hold together. Therefore, we can have neutrosophic fields, and neutrosophic objects, neutrosophic states, etc.\nb) Paradoxist Physics. Neutrosophic Physics is an extension of Paradoxist Physics, since Paradoxist Physics is a\ncombination of physical contradictories <A> and <antiA> only that hold together, without referring to their neutrality <neutA>. Paradoxist Physics describes collections of objects or states that are individually characterized by contradictory properties, or are characterized neither by a property nor by the opposite of that property, or are composed of contradictory sub-elements. Such objects or states are called paradoxist entities.\nThese domains of research were set up in the 1995 within the frame of neutrosophy,\nneutrosophic logic/set/probability/statistics."

Goldfain);\n- the “multiplet” of elementary particles is a kind of ‘neutrosophic field’ with two or more values (E. Goldfain, 2011);\n- A \"neutrosophic field\" can be generalized to that of operators whose action is selective. The effect of the neutrosophic field is somehow equivalent with the “tunneling” from the solid physics, or with the “spontaneous symmetry breaking\" (SSB) where there is an internal symmetry which is broken by a particular selection of the vacuum state (E. Goldfain).\nEtc.\nConclusion\nMany types of logics have been presented above. For the most general logic, the n-valued refined neutrosophic logic, we presented two classes of neutrosophic operators to be used in combinations of neutrosophic valued propositions in physics.\nSimilar generalizations are done for n-Valued Refined Neutrosophic Set, and respectively nValued Refined Neutrosopjhic Probability."
