      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Boosting is successful for both binary and multi-class classification (Freund & Schapire, 1995; Schapire & Singer, 1999). Among those popular variants, we are particularly focusing on LogitBoost (Friedman et al., 1998) in this paper. Originally, LogitBoost is motivated by statistical view (Friedman et al., 1998), where boosting algorithms consists of three key components: the loss, the function model, and the optimization algorithm. In the case of LogitBoost, these are the Logit loss, the use of additive tree models, and a stage-wise optimization, respectively. There are two important factors in the LogitBoost setting. Firstly, the posterior class probability estimate must be normalised so as to sum to one in order to use the Logit loss. This leads to a coupled classifier output, i.e., the sum-to-zero classifier output. Secondly, a dense Hessian matrix arises when deriving the tree node split gain and node value fitting. It is challenging to design a tractable optimization algorithm that fully handles both these factors. Consequently, some simplification and/or approximation is needed. Friedman et al. (1998) proposes a “one scalar regression tree for one class” strategy. This breaks the coupling in the classifier output so that at each boosting iteration the model updating collapses to K independent regression tree fittings, where K denotes the number of classes. In this way, the sum-to-zero constraint is dropped and the Hessian is approximated diagonally.\nUnfortunately, Friedman’s prescription turns out to have some drawbacks. A later improvement, ABCLogitBoost, is shown to outperform LogitBoost in terms of both classification accuracy and conver-\ngence rate (Li, 2008; 2010a). This is due to ABCLogitBoost’s careful handling of the above key problems of the LogitBoost setting. At each iteration, the sum-to-zero constraint is enforced so that only K − 1 scalar trees are fitted for K−1 classes. The remaining class – called the base class – is selected adaptively per iteration (or every several iterations), hence the acronym ABC (Adaptive Base Class). Also, the Hessian matrix is approximated in a more refined manner than the original LogitBoost when computing the tree split gain and fitting node value.\nIn this paper, we propose two novel techniques to address the challenging aspects of the LogitBoost setting. In our approach, one vector tree is added per iteration. We allow a K dimensional sum-to-zero vector to be fitted for each tree node. This permits us to explicitly formulate the computation for both node split gain and node value fitting as a K dimensional constrained quadratic optimization, which arises as a subproblem in the inner loop for split seeking when fitting a new tree. To avoid the difficulty of a dense Hessian, we propose that for each of these subproblems, only two coordinates (i.e., two classes or a class pair) are adaptively selected for updating, hence the name AOSO (Adaptive One vS One) LogitBoost. Figure 1 gives an overview of our approach. In Section 2.5 we show that first order and second order approximation of loss reduction can be a good measure for the quality of selected class pair.\nFollowing the above formulation, ABC-LogitBoost, although derived from a somewhat different framework in (Li, 2010a), can thus be shown to be a special case of AOSO-LogitBoost, but with a less flexible tree model. In Section 3.1 we compare the differences between the two approaches in detail and provide some intuition\nfor AOSO’s improvement over ABC.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows: In Section 2 we first formulate the problem setting for LogitBoost and then give the details of our approach. In Section 3 we compare our approach to (ABC)LogitBoost. In Section 4, experimental results in terms of classification errors and convergence rates are reported on a range of public datasets."

      "heading" : "2. The Algorithm",
      "text" : "We begin with the basic setting for the LogitBoost algorithm. ForK-class classification (K ≥ 2), consider anN example training set {xi, yi} N i=1 where xi denotes a feature value and yi ∈ {1, . . . ,K} denotes a class label. Class probabilities conditioned on x, denoted by p = (p1, . . . , pK)\nT , are learned from the training set. For a test example with known x and unknown y, we predict a class label by using the Bayes rule: y = argmaxk pk, k = 1, . . . ,K.\nInstead of learning the class probability directly, one learns its “proxy” F = (F1, . . . , FK)\nT given by the so-called Logit link function:\npk = exp(Fk)\n∑K j=1 exp(Fj) (1)\nwith the constraint ∑K\nk=1 Fk = 0 (Friedman et al., 1998). For simplicity and without confusion, we hereafter omit the dependence on x for F and for other related variables.\nThe F is obtained by minimizing a target function on training data:\nLoss =\nN ∑\ni=1\nL(yi,F i), (2)\nwhere F i is shorthand for F (xi) and L(yi,F i) is the Logit loss for a single training example:\nL(yi,F i) = −\nK ∑\nk=1\nrik log pik, (3)\nwhere rik = 1 if yi = k and 0 otherwise. The probability pik is connected to Fik via (1).\nTo make the optimization of (2) feasible, a model is needed to describe how F depends on x. For example, linear model F = W Tx is used in traditional Logit regression, while Generalized Additive Model is adopted in LogitBoost:\nF (x) = ∑M\nm=1 fm(x), (4)\nwhere each fm(x), a K dimensional sum-to-zero vector, is learned by greedy stage-wise optimization. That is, at each iteration fm(x) is added only based on F = ∑m−1\nj=1 f j . Formally,\nfm(x) = argmin f\nN ∑\ni=1\nL(yi,F i + f(xi))\ns.t. ∑\nk\nfk(xi) = 0, i = 1, ..., N.\n(5)\nThis procedure repeats M times with initial condition F = 0. Owing to its iterative nature, we only need to know how to solve (5) in order to implement the optimization."

In this paper, we adopt a single vector tree. We further restrict that it is a binary tree (i.e., only binary splits on internal node are allowed) and the split must be vertical to coordinate axis, as in (Friedman et al., 1998) or (Li, 2010a). Formally,\nf (x) =\nJ ∑\nj=1\ntjI(x ∈ Rj) (6)\nwhere {Rj} J j=1 describes how the feature space is partitioned, while tj ∈ R K with a sum-to-zero constraint is the node values/vector associated with Rj .

      "text" : "Solving (5) with the tree model (6) is equivalent to determining the parameters {tj , Rj} J j=1 at the m-th iteration. In this subsection we will show how this problem reduces to solving a collection of convex optimization subproblems for which we can use any numerical method. Following Friedman’s LogitBoost settings, here we use Newton descent1. Also, we will show how the gradient and Hessian can be computed incrementally.\nWe begin with some shorthand notation for the node\n1We use Newtown descent as there is evidence in (Li, 2010a) that gradient descent, i.e., in Friedmans’s MART (Friedman, 2001), leads to decreased classification accuracy.\nloss :\nNodeLoss(t; I) = ∑\ni∈I\nL(yi,F i + t)\nt1 + . . .+ tK = 0, t ∈ R K\n(7)\nwhere I denotes the index set of the training examples on some either internal or terminal node (i.e., those falling into the corresponding region). Minimizing (7) is the bridge to {tj , Rj} in that:\n1. To obtain {tj} with given {Rj}, we simply take the minimizer of (7):\ntj = argmin t NodeLoss(t; Ij), (8)\nwhere Ij denotes the index set for Rj .\n2. To obtain {Rj}, we recursively perform binary split until there are J-terminal nodes.\nThe key to the second point is to explicitly give the node split gain. Suppose an internal node with n training examples (n = N for the root node), we fix on some feature and re-index all the n examples according to their sorted feature values. Now we need to find the index n′ with 1 < n′ < n that maximizes the node gain defined as loss reduction after a division between the n′-th and (n′ + 1)-th examples:\nNodeGain(n′) = NodeLoss(t∗; I)−\n(NodeLoss(t∗L; IL) +NodeLoss(t ∗ R; IR))\n(9)\nwhere I = {1, . . . , n}, IL = {1, . . . , n ′} and IR = {n′+1, . . . , n}; t∗, t∗L and t ∗ R are the minimizers of (7) with index sets I, IL and IR, respectively. Generally, this searching applies to all features. The best division resulting to largest (9) is then recorded to perform the actual node split.\nNote that (9) arises in the context of an O(N × D) outer loop, where D is number of features. However, a näıve summing of the losses for (7) incurs an additional O(N) factor in complexity, which finally results in an unacceptable O(N2D) complexity for a single boosting iteration.\nA workaround is to use a Newton descent method for which both the gradient and Hessian can be incrementally computed. Let g, H respectively be the K × 1 gradient vector and K ×K Hessian matrix at t = 0. By dropping the constant NodeLoss(0; I) that is irrelevant to t, the Taylor expansion of (7) w.r.t. t up to second order is:\nloss(t; I) = gT t+ 1\n2 tTHt\nt1 + . . .+ tK = 0, t ∈ R K\n(10)\nBy noting the additive separability of (10) and using some matrix derivatives, we have\ng = − ∑\ni∈I\ngi (11) H =\n∑\ni∈I\nHi (12)\ngi = ri − pi (13) Hi = P̂ − pip T i (14)\nwhere the diagonal matrix P̂ = diag(pi1, . . . , piK). We then use (10) to compute the approximated node loss in (9). Thanks to the additive form, both (11) and (12) can be incrementally/decrementally computed in constant time when the split searching proceeds from one training example to the next. Therefore, the computation of (10) eliminates the O(N) complexity in the näıve summing of losses.2"

      "heading" : "2.3. Properties of Approximated Node Loss",
      "text" : "To minimise (10), we give some properties for (10) that should be taken into account when seeking a solver. We begin with the sum-to-zero constraint. The probability estimate pk in the Logit loss (3) must be non-zero and sum-to-one, which is ensured by the link function (1). Such a link, in turn, means that pk is unchanged by adding an arbitrary constant to each component in F . As a result, the single example loss (3) is invariant to moving it along an all-1 vector 1. That is,\nL(yi,F i + c1) = L(yi,F i), (15)\nwhere c is an arbitrary real constant (Note that 1 is, coincidentally, the orthogonal complement to the space defined by sum-to-zero constraint). This property also carries over to the approximated node loss (10):\nProperty 1 loss(t; I) = loss(t+ c1; I).\nThis is obvious by noting the additive separability in (10), as well as that gTi 1 = 0, 1\nTH i1 = 0 holds since pi is sum-to-one.\nFor the Hessian, we have rank(H) ≤ rank(H i) by noting the additive form in (11). In (Li, 2010a) it is shown that detHi = 0 by brute-force determinant expansion. Here we give a stronger property:\n2In Real AdaBoost.MH, such a second order approximation is not necessary (although possible, cf. (Zou et al., 2008)). Due to the special form of the exponential loss and the absence of a sum-to-zero constraint, there exists analytical solution for the node loss (7) by simply setting the derivative to 0. Here also, the computation can be incremental/decremental. Since the loss design and AdaBoost.MH are not our main interests, we do not discuss this further.\nProperty 2 Hi is a positive semi-definite matrix such that 1) rank(H i) = κ− 1, where κ is the number of non-zero elements in pi; 2) 1 is the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0.\nThe proof can be found in this paper’s extended version (Sun et al., 2012).\nThe properties shown above indicate that 1) H is singular, so that unconstrained Newton descent is not applicable here, and 2) rank(H) could be as high as K − 1, which prohibits the application of the standard fast quadratic solver designed for low rank Hessians. In the following we propose to address this problem via block coordinate descent, a technique that has been successfully used in training SVMs (Bottou & Lin, 2007)."

In (Li, 2010c), b is selected only every several iterations, while in (Li, 2008), b is, intuitively, set to be the class that leads to largest loss reduction at last iteration.\nIn ABC-LogitBoost the sum-to-zero constraint is explicitly considered when deriving the node value and the node split gain for the scalar regression tree. Indeed, they are the same as (21) and (22) in this paper, although derived using a slightly different motivation. In this sense, ABC-LogitBoost can be seen as a special form of the AOSO-LogitBoost since: 1) For each tree, the class pair is fixed for every node in ABC, while it is selected adaptively in AOSO, and 2) K − 1 trees are added per iteration in ABC (using the same set of probability estimates {pi} N i=1), while only one tree is added per iteration by AOSO (and {pi} N i=1 are updated as soon as each tree is added).\nSince two changes are made to ABC-LogitBoost, an immediate question is what happens if we only make one? That is, what happens if one vector tree is added per iteration for a single class pair selected only for the root node and shared by all other tree nodes, as in ABC, but the {pi} N i=1 are updated as soon as a tree is added, as in AOSO. This was tried but unfortunately, degraded performance was observed for this combination so the results are not reported here.\nFrom the above analysis, we believe the more flexible model (as well as the model updating strategy) in AOSO is what contributes to its improvement over ABC, as seen section 4)."

Test errors at last iteration are simply reported since no obvious over-fitting is observed. By default, M = 10000, while for those large datasets (Covertype290k, Poker525k, Pokder275k, Poker150k, Poker100k) M = 5000 (Li, 2010a; 2009).

In the case of LogitBoost, these are the Logit loss, the use of additive tree models, and a stage-wise optimization, respectively. There are two important factors in the LogitBoost setting. Firstly, the posterior class probability estimate must be normalised so as to sum to one in order to use the Logit loss. This leads to a coupled classifier output, i.e., the sum-to-zero classifier output. Secondly, a dense Hessian matrix arises when deriving the tree node split gain and node value fitting. It is challenging to design a tractable optimization algorithm that fully handles both these factors. Consequently, some simplification and/or approximation is needed. Friedman et al.

    "abstractText" : "This paper presents an improvement to model learning when using multi-class LogitBoost for classification. Motivated by the statistical view, LogitBoost can be seen as additive tree regression. Two important factors in this setting are: 1) coupled classifier output due to a sum-to-zero constraint, and 2) the dense Hessian matrices that arise when computing tree node split gain and node value fittings. In general, this setting is too complicated for a tractable model learning algorithm. However, too aggressive simplification of the setting may lead to degraded performance. For example, the original LogitBoost is outperformed by ABC-LogitBoost due to the latter’s more careful treatment of the above two factors. In this paper we propose techniques to address the two main difficulties of the LogitBoost setting: 1) we adopt a vector tree (i.e., each node value is vector) that enforces a sum-to-zero constraint, and 2) we use an adaptive block coordinate descent that exploits the dense Hessian when computing tree split gain and node values. Higher classification accuracy and faster convergence rates are observed for a range of public data sets when compared to both the original and the ABC-LogitBoost implementations.
