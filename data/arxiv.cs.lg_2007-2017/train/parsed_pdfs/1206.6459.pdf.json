      "text" : "Cointegration is an important concept in time-series analysis and relates to the fact that the differences between two time-series may be more predictable than any individual time-series itself. We make two contributions to this area—first, we formulate determining whether two series are cointegrated as an instance of Bayesian inference in an associated probabilistic model. This enables us to bring modern statistical and machine learning techniques to the analysis of cointegration and also provides a useful conceptual framework to describe cointegration. The resulting regression estimation algorithm is shown to be more robust than least-squares estimation to spurious results. This is we believe an\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012.

Second, in practice two series may only be intermittently cointegrated—that is, they are only cointegrated over shorter segments of time. To date the identification of these segments has been attempted with rather limiting assumptions such as the presence of either only two or three segments (Gregory & Hansen, 1996; Hatemi-J, 2008). To address this we phrase the problem as inference in a corresponding changepoint model, placing no limitation on the number of segments. We develop an efficient specialised inference scheme for this model and demonstrate its practical applicability on real-world problems."

      "text" : "Whilst individual time-series may not be predictable, the relationships between two time-series may be more predictable. For example, series x1:T , y1:T formed by\nxt+1 = xt + t+1, yt+1 = yt + t+1, t ∼ N (0, 1)\nboth follow an unpredictable random walk. However, the future difference xt+1 − yt+1 = xt − yt, is perfectly predictable given knowledge of the current difference. In the economics and finance literature such instances are common; for example underlying mechanisms such as limited money supply may forge dependencies between time-series (Dickey et al., 1991). It is of significant interest in finance to find pairs of asset price series that are cointegrated—such estimation underpins one of the classical statistical arbitrage strategies known as ‘pairs trading’.\nFrom an individual series x1:T we can form a new series x12:T by taking the difference x 1 t = xt − xt−1. Repeating this differencing process d times, a series is order d integrated, written I(d), if the series xdt formed from repeatedly taking the difference d times yields a stationary series I(0). In our example above, both x and y are each I(1) and hence integrated. As we showed, there is a linear combination that is I(0). More generally, two series x1:T and y1:T are cointegrated\nif they are each individually integrated and a linear combination of the two is integrated with a lower order.\nFor our purposes, we define xt and yt to be cointegrated within a specified time segment if there is a linear regression relationship between the two variables that forms a stationary process. For the most simple case of a single regressor, we write such a relationship as\nyt = α+ βxt + t t = φ t−1 + ηt, ηt ∼ N ( 0, σ2 ) , |φ| < 1\nwhere α represents a constant, and β the regression coefficient. Here 1:T forms a mean-reverting, stationary process. For brevity, we focus attention on estimation in this model, however more flexible cases can easily be considered, including the case with a trend coefficient γ in which the regression is written\nyt = α+ βxt + γt+ t\nwith the same autoregression for t. Adapting our technique to more complex models with exogenous variables, and to the vector case, is also possible.\nTesting for and estimating a cointegration relationship is classically a two-step process (Granger, 1986). Firstly, the regression equation is estimated based on a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) fit to minimise∑ t(yt−α−βxt)2 (which we show is equivalent to maximum likelihood (ML) parameter optimisation assuming that φ = 0 in a corresponding model). Subsequently, a test for a unit root in the residuals is performed using the Dickey-Fuller test, see for example Harris & Sollis (2003), which tests the hypothesis that φ = 1 against the alternative |φ| < 1 (for |φ| < 1 the series is stationary and non-stationary otherwise). In the case that φ = 1, it is well-known that OLS can deliver a spurious regression (Granger & Newbold, 1974), and this problem is not limited to cointegration. The classical approach is conceptually undesirable since it makes strong, potentially conflicting assumptions about the data: in the regression part, the residuals are effectively assumed uncorrelated whilst in the subsequent unit root test, they may be determined not to be (under the null hypothesis of the test, the regression was spurious). In this work we relax the assumptions placed on φ during parameter estimation to reduce the impact of any conflicting assumptions."

First,\nwe form a generative model on observations1 y1:T and latent variables 1:T\np(y1:T , 1:T x1:T ) = ∏ t p(yt xt, t) p( t t−1) , 0 = ∅\nwhere2\np(yt xt, t) = δ(yt − α− βxt − t)\nand the transition for t is given as p( t t−1) = N ( t φ t−1, σ 2 ) .\nThe belief network (see Barber (2012) for an introduction) for this model is given in figure 1. The likelihood on the observations y1:T is given by\np(y1:T x1:T ) = ∫ 1:T p(y1:T , 1:T x1:T ) .\nThe integration distributes,\np(y1:T x1:T ) = ∫ 1:T−1 T−1∏ t=1 p(yt xt, t) p( t t−1)\n× ∫ T p(yT xT , T ) p( T T−1)\nand since we have a delta function, the final term evaluates to N ( yT − α− βxT φ T−1, σ2 ) . Iterating this yields a product of Gaussian terms\nT∏ t=2 N ( yt − α− βxt φ (yt−1 − α− βxt−1) , σ2 ) .\nFinally, applying labels according to t = yt − α− βxt,\np(y1:T x1:T ) = p( 1) T∏ t=2 N ( t φ t−1, σ 2 ) = p( 1:T ) .\nHence the likelihood p(y1:T x1:T ) is equivalent to the likelihood on the Markov chain with ‘observations’ t shown in figure 2. The log likelihood log p( 1:T ) is\nlog p( 1)− 1\n2σ2 T∑ t=2 ( t − φ t−1)2 − T − 1 2 log 2πσ2\n1Note that we make no assumption about the underlying process x; we work with the conditional relationship p(y1:T x1:T ) not the joint p(x1:T , y1:T ). As far as we are aware previous Bayesian approaches to cointegration make stronger assumptions about the underlying process, see for example Koop et al. (2006).\n2The Dirac delta distribution δ(x− a) represents a degenerate probability density function with the property that∫ x δ(x− a) f(x) = f(a) .\nand when φ = 0, maximising this degenerates to minimising the sum of squared residual terms\nT∑ t=2 2t = T∑ t=2 (yt − α− βxt)2 .\nOLS estimation for the regression parameters α and β therefore corresponds to the ML solution of this model, on the assumption that φ = 0. In the case that φ is non-zero, a different solution may be optimal in the ML sense. This is a source of potential inconsistency in the classical approach to cointegration testing."

Furthermore we wish to relate closely to the classical point estimate approach to cointegration estimation and testing.

      "text" : "For some series, cointegration may only apply for certain segments. A good example is the Interconnector gas pipeline between Bacton, UK and Zeebrugge, Belgium, which allows gas to flow between the two countries, providing a direct link in the gas price at each end. When the pipeline closes each year for maintenance, the link between the prices is temporarily broken. It was shown by Kim (2003) that classical tests for cointegration may fail to detect a relationship even though, for a part of the series, there is such a relationship. The following model seeks to detect a cointegration relationship between two series, while allowing for regions when the relationship is in fact a random walk.\n5Differing decision thresholds correspond to different widths of uniform prior for 1 in the RW model since\nlRW lC < C ⇔ l̃RW lC < 1, l̃RW ≡ lRW C .\nPrevious works in this area typically limit the number of regimes in which cointegration can occur to either only two or three segments (Gregory & Hansen, 1996; Hatemi-J, 2008). In contrast, for our model we allow time-varying φt arranged to be piecewise-constant with no a priori restriction on the number of piecewiseconstant regions. The model will switch between the cointegrated case |φt| < 1 and the alternative φt = 1, corresponding to a random walk.\nWe use the binary state switch it to denote whether there is a cointegration relationship at time t: it = 1 denotes regions of t corresponding to a random walk; alternatively when it = 0, t follows a stationary cointegration relation. In the random walk regions, we have φt = 1, which is encoded in the prior distribution p1(φt) = δ(φt − 1). We therefore specify\np(φ2 i2 = 0) = { p1(φ2) = δ(φ2 − 1) i2 = 1 p0(φ2) = U(φ2 (−1, 1)) i2 = 0\nand for the piecewise-constant transition,\np(φt φt−1, it, it−1) =  p1(φt) it = 1\nδ(φt − φt−1) it = 0, it−1 = 0 p0(φt) it = 0, it−1 = 1.\nWhilst the state transition p(it it−1) and p(i2) can also in principle be learned on the basis of ML, we\nleave these quantities to be user specified. Note that whilst φt can change with time, for computational tractability we assume that the remaining parameters α, β, σ2 are fixed throughout time. The belief network representation is given in figure 5.\nThe switching inference routine described in the following section relies on the recursive updates given in appendix A, in which we use the uniform prior for t at the start of each cointegrated segment.\n5.1. Inference of i2:T , φ2:T\nThe regime-switching model with piecewise-constant φt is an example of a changepoint model, in which a change of regime drops the dependency of the continuous latent variable φt on the past. The model is therefore an example of the ‘reset model’ as set out by Bracegirdle & Barber (2011), and we apply such results here. Exact inference is then possible by applying recursions for filtering (calculating each p(φt, it 1:t)) and correctionsmoothing (for p(φt, it 1:T )). For brevity, we show here only some of the key considerations; a full derivation is given in the supplementary material.\nIt is easy to show that both the filtered and smoothed posteriors for φt in the case that it = 1 degenerate in an intuitive way to\np(φt it = 1, 1:t) = p(φt it = 1, 1:T ) = p 1(φt) .\nFor the case it = 0, the posterior for φt is more complex because of the temporal dependency. For filtering, the posterior depends on the previous regime: in the event that it−1 = 1, a new cointegration regime has begun, and a Gaussian term is contributed to the posterior in accordance with (2); otherwise, each component is updated as for the simple cointegration case (1). We therefore see that the posterior p(φt it = 0, 1:t) is given as a truncated mixture of Gaussian components.\nFor correction smoothing, it can be difficult to derive a recursion analytically because the backwards-recursive\nstep requires a ‘dynamics reversal’ term that is calculated with the filtered posterior in the denominator. In the case that the filtered posterior is a mixture distribution, the algebra is intractable. However, we appeal to the result of Bracegirdle & Barber (2011) that by indexing the components in the filtered posterior according to the number of observations since a switch to cointegration, the smoothing recursion can be written exactly. The resulting recursion shows that, as we may expect, a subset of the Gaussian components from p(φt+1 it+1 = 0, 1:T ) are contributed to the posterior p(φt it = 0, 1:T ) without change, along with the components from filtering p(φt it = 0, 1:t) in the case that the cointegration regime ends at t.\nThe discrete filtering and smoothing components, p(it 1:t) and p(it 1:T ), are also calculated as part of the recursions. The result is an algorithm for exact inference in this switching model that scales as T 2."

First, the method in section 3 allows estimation of a linear relationship between variables and we showed that our resulting algorithm is less likely to deliver a spurious relationship than the classical OLS–unit root testing approach. The benefit of our approach is that it results in a fast O(T ) algorithm for testing cointegration. A natural extension would be to consider a more complete Bayesian analysis and marginalise over all parameters in both the cointegration and random walk models.\nSecond, we developed a switching model to detect a relationship and regimes in which that relationship is a random walk. Whilst the model has an obvious limitation (shared by other existing intermittent cointegration models) it has the benefit of fast exact inference, scaling O(T 2). A further natural extension would be to consider regimes in which the linear relationship can also vary.

Subsequently, a test for a unit root in the residuals is performed using the Dickey-Fuller test, see for example Harris & Sollis (2003), which tests the hypothesis that φ = 1 against the alternative |φ| < 1 (for |φ| < 1 the series is stationary and non-stationary otherwise).",

Classically, the test for cointegration is based on a two stage process in which first the linear relation between the series is estimated by Ordinary Least Squares. Subsequently a unit root test is performed on the residuals. A well-known deficiency of this classical approach is that it can lead to erroneous conclusions about the presence of cointegration. As an alternative, we present a framework for estimating whether cointegration exists using Bayesian inference which is empirically superior to the classical approach. Finally, we apply our technique to model segmented cointegration in which cointegration may exist only for limited time. In contrast to previous approaches our model makes no restriction on the number of possible cointegration segments.",
