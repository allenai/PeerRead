All of these algorithms are supervised learning algorithms.\nWe are evaluating performance of these algorithms on the basis of classification results as well as computational requirements in training. The application on which we are evaluating these algorithms is web spam classification.\nWeb spam is one of the key challenges for search engine industry. Web spam are the web pages that are created or manipulated to lead users from search engine result page to a target web page and also manipulate search engine ranking of the target page."

They used SVM classifier with linear kernel.\nNoi (2010) [2] proposed a combination of graph neural network and probability mapping graph self organizing maps organized into a layered architecture. It was a mixture of unsupervised and supervised learning approaches but the training time was computationally very expensive.\nErdelyi (2011) [3] achieved superior classification results in experiment using learning methods LogitBoost and RandomForest with less computation hungry content features. They used 100,000 hosts from WebspamUK2007 and 190,000 hosts from DC2010 datasets and investigated the trade-off between feature generation and spam classification accuracy. They proved that more features improve performance but complex features such as PageRank improves the classification accuracy marginally.\nAccording to Biggio (2011) [4], SVM can be manipulated in adversarial classification tasks such as spam filtering.\nSimilarly, Xiao (2012) [5] showed that injection of contaminated data in training dataset significantly degrades the accuracy of the SVM.\nThis is well known that neural network perform better with noisy data. Similar is the case of adversarial dataset of web spam."

      "text" : "An ANN is a collection of simple processing units which communicate with each other using a large number of weighted connections. Each unit receives input from neighbour units or from external source and computes output which propagates to other neighbours. There is also a mechanism to adjust weights of the connections. Normally there are 3 types of units.\n• Input Unit: which receives signal from external source. • Output Unit: which sends data out of the network. • Hidden Unit: which Receives and sends signals within the network.\nMany of the units can work parallel in the system. ANN can be adapted to take a set of inputs and produce a desired set of outputs. This process is known as learning or training. There are two kinds of training in neural network.\n• Supervised: The network is provided a set of inputs and corresponding output patterns, called training dataset, to train the network.\n• Unsupervised: The network trains itself by creating clusters of patterns. Here no prior set training data is provided to the system."

      "text" : "It is basic back-propagation algorithm. It adjusts weights in the steepest descent direction i.e. the most negative of the gradients. This is the direction in which the function is decreasing most rapidly. It is observed that although the function decreases most rapidly along the negative of the gradient direction, it does not always provide the fastest convergence. In the Conjugate Gradient algorithm a search is done in conjugate directions, which generally provides the faster convergence than the steepest descent direction[6].\nConjugate Gradient Algorithm adjusts step size in each iteration along the conjugate gradient direction to minimize performance function. It searches the steepest descent direction on the first iteration.\np0 = - g0 (6)\nThen it performs line search to determine the optimal distance to move along the current search direction by combining new steepest descent direction with the previous direction.\npk = - gk + βk pk - 1 (7)\nwhere the constant βk is\nβ1 23 4 23\n23 54 23 5 (8)\nIt is the ratio of the norm squared of current gradient to the norm squared of the previous gradient[7]."

It is also known as squashing function because it compresses an infinite input range into finite output range. The sigmoid function's slope approaches to zero as input gets large. It causes problem when we use steepest descent to train network. Because since gradient may have very small value so it may cause small changes in weights and biases even though the weight and biases are fairly far away from the optimal values.\nThe purpose of the resilient back-propagation (RB) learning is to remove the harmful effect of the magnitude of partial derivatives. It uses only the sign of the partial derivative to determine the direction of the weight update. The magnitude of the weight change is calculated as following rule [8]:\n• Values of each weight and bias are increased when the derivative of performance function with respect to that weight has same sign for two successful iterations. • Values of each weight and bias are decreased when the derivative with respect to weight changes sign from the previous iteration.\n• If the derivative is zero the values of the weights and biases are remain same. • When weights oscillate, values of weight change is reduced. • If weights continuously change in the same direction, weight change is increased."

      "text" : "It provides a numerical solution to the problem of minimizing a generally non-linear function, over a space of parameters for the function. It is popular alternative to the Gauss-Newton method of finding the minimum of a function. It approaches second order training speed without computing the Hessian Matrix [9],\nIf the performance function is of the form of a sum of squares, then Hessian matrix can be approximated as:\nH = JT J (9)\nand the gradient is:\ng = J T e (10)\nwhere J represents the Jacobian matrix containing the first derivatives of network error with respect to weights and biases, and e is the vector of network errors.\nThe Jacobian matrix can be computed through a standard back-propagation technique that is much complex than computing Hessian matrix. This approximated matrix is used in following Newton like update\nxk + 1 = xk - [ J T J + µ I ]-1 JT e (11)\nWhen the scalar µ = 0, it becomes the Newton's method on approximated Hessian matrix. When µ is large, it becomes gradient descent with small step size. The Newton's method is faster and more accurate so algorithm shifts towards it. So the µ is decreased with each successful step (i.e. when performance function reduces). It is increased when a tentative step would increase the performance function. So the performance function always reduces at each iteration. It is more powerful than conventional gradient descent technique.\nLM Algorithm is very sensitive to initial network weights. It does not consider outliers in the data which may lead to over-fitting noise. To avoid these situations, Regularization technique is used. One of such technique is Bayesian Regularization."

It allows to estimate effective number of parameters actually used by the model i.e. the number of network weights actually needed to solve a particular problem. Bayesian Regularization expands the cost function to search not only for minimal error but for minimal error using minimal weights. By using Bayesian Regularization one can avoid costly cross validation. It is particularly useful for the\nproblems that cannot, or would suffer, if a portion of available data were reserved to a validation set. Furthermore, the regularization also reduces or eliminates the need for testing different numbers of hidden neurons for a problem. Bayesian regularized ANN are difficult to be over trained and over-fit."
