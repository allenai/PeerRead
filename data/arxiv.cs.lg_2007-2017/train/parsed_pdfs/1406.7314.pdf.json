      "text" : "- 1 -\nINTRODUCTION\nIn this paper, we highlight some of key related researches, techniques and approaches that have arisen to extract the suitable feature parameters. Currently, there are two major approaches to feature extraction: modeling human voice production and modeling perception system. In the first model, the voice evolved primarily to produce speech for conversation, in the second model, hearing evolved to recognize these sounds. So we try to classify the features extraction under these two models.\nIn order to enhance performance and robustness in automatic speech recognition, pre processing and filtering in speech feature extraction are commonly used.\nIn this paper, we motivate the use of extraction feature techniques for text independent speaker identification system using the GMM supervector in a support vector machine (SVM) classifier."

      "text" : "Features extraction in ASR is the computation of a sequence of feature vectors which provides a compact representation of the given speech signal.\nProducing and perceiving speech are basin human activities, a speaker can be presented as an encoder in a speech production process and the listener can be presented as a decoder in a speech perception process.\nFigure 1 shows the complete process of producing and perceiving speech from the formulation of a message of a talker, to the creation of the speech signal, and finally to the understanding of the message by a listener.\nBetween human auditory and speech production systems, some researches believe that the auditory system came first, other researches uses the speech production model as the primary focus [URS 02].\nIt is the acoustic speech signal which mediates between the two systems. Thus, it is only natural to expect that the properties of the acoustic signal can tell us about both the human speech production system and the human auditory system.\n- 2 -\nSpeech Production Process\nSpeech Perception Process\nThis section reviews the production/perception process and the discriminates features extracted from their characteristics."

      "heading" : "1.1. Features based on speech production",
      "text" : "We elucidate in this section the production mechanisms that give rise to different kinds of features.\nSpeech production is produced by the combined motion of articulatory gestures.\nThe mechanism of speech is composed of four processes: language processing, in which the content of an utterance is represented somehow in the brain; generation of motor commands to the vocal organs; articulatory movement for the production of speech by the vocal organs based on these motor commands; and the emission of air sent from the lungs in the form of speech [HON 03].\nThese structures are able to generate and shape a wide variety of waveforms. These waveforms can be broadly categorized into voiced and unvoiced speech.\nThese features describe properties of speech production rather than the properties of the acoustic signal resulting from it.\nBased on the knowledge of the speech production mechanisms, we are able to extract a set of features which can best represent a particular phoneme. The phonemes are classified in terms of manner of articulation, (how is the vocal tract constricted), and place of articulation (where is the vocal tract constricted?) as mentioned in the table below.\nSome features are motivated from a speech point of view like articulatory features and linear predictive analysis.\n1.1.1. Articulatory features Articulatory features (AFs) have attracted interest from the speech recognition community for more than a decade for many reasons [KIN 07] [KIR 00].\nThese features describe the configuration of the human vocal tract and the properties of speech production.\nThe basic idea of this approach is to bears an affinity to the articulatory events underlying the speech signal.\nThis representation is composed of classes describing the most essential articulatory properties of speech sounds such as place, manner, voicing, liprounding, the opening between the lips, and the position of the tongue.\n1.1.2. Linear Predictive Coding - LPC\nLinear predictive analysis of speech were introduced in late 1960s and become the predominant technique for estimating the basic parameters of speech [MAK 75].\nBased on a highly simplified model for speech production, LPC provides both an accurate estimate of the speech parameters such as pitch, formants and spectra. It tries to imitate the human speech production mechanism. In addition, all the vocal tract parameters are represented in a set of LPC coefficients. The number of coefficients is typically 10 to 20 [KIN 07].\nIt is widely used because it is fast, simple and its ability to extract and store time varying formant information."

      "heading" : "1.2. Features based on perception system",
      "text" : "The auditory system is the sensory system for the sense of hearing. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how human listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand spoken language.\nThe acoustic wave is transmitted from the outer ear\n- 3 -\nto the inner ear which performs a transduction from acoustic energy to mechanical vibrations which ultimately are transferred to the basilar membrane inside the cochlea (the main component of the inner ear). The mechanical vibrations are then transuded into activity signals on the auditory nerves corresponding to a feature extraction process [KIM 99].\nThe cochlea performs the filterbank based frequency analysis on the speech signal to extract the pertinent features. Thus, most techniques are pivoting around the filterbank methodology in extracting the features. The difference in the design of the filterbank offers the extraction of different features from the signal.\nIn fact the question of the imitation of the human auditory system characteristics for ASR has been subject of discussion and some researches believe that the analysis based on the effective peripheral auditory processing is the most robust front end in noise [HER 98].\nFrom the point of view of speech perception, we can describe some of these features.\n1.2.1. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients - MFCC The most commonly used acoustic features are Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficient based on frequency domain using the Mel scale which is based on the human ear scale.\nMFCC takes human perception sensitivity with respect to frequencies into consideration.\nMFCC is based on psychoacoustic research on the pitch and the perception of different frequency bands by the human ear. These parameters are similar to ones that are used by humans for hearing speech.\n1.2.2. Perceptual Linear Prediction -PLP Hermansky [HER 90] introduced a new technique, perceptual linear predictive (PLP) analysis.\nThis technique is based on the short-term spectrum of speech. It combined several engineering approximations to selected characteristics of human hearing and approximates auditory spectra by an autoregressive all-pole model.\nPLP uses engineering approximations for three basic concepts from the psycho-acoustic of hearing: spectrum critical band spectral resolution, the equalloudness curve and intensity power low.\nLike MFCC, PLP employ an auditory based warping of the frequency axis derived from the frequency sensitivity of human hearing.\n1.3. Other speech features\n1.3.1. Dynamic features The set of features described so far capture the average frequency distribution during a frame. Important information in the speech signal is however contained in the temporal evolution of the signal, in its\ndynamics.\nOne way to capture this information is to use the dynamic properties of speech, the first and/or second order differences of static coefficients which are called the delta (speed) and delta-delta (acceleration) coefficients. The time derivative is approximated by differencing between frames after and before the current, for instance:\ndidiyi yy   (1)\nWhere y i is the feature vector at frame i, and d typically is set to 1 or 2.\nIt has become common to combine dynamic features with the basic static features. It usually results in better performance.\n1.3.2. Prosodic features Prosody is defined as any property of speech that is not limited to a specific phoneme.\nProsody is a term that refers to the suprasegmental aspects of speech, including variations in pitch (fundamental frequency), energy, loudness, duration, pause, intonation, rate, stress and rhythm.\nProsody may reflect various features of the speaker, his emotional state or speaking style.\nVery few people have done experiments which directly incorporate prosody as complementary information with ASR.\nKompe [KOM 97] is one of the few people to experiment with prosody. He reports improvements to recognition rates when prosodic information is used for recognition purposes."

We have presented the performance of this combination with different features and two different Kernels.\nThen a comparative study was made to investigate the best choice of kernel function and the best input features.\nFirst, we conclude that MFCC and LPC outperform PLP.\nWe also conclude that including the delta and acceleration coefficients has a negative affect on ASR performance excluding with LPC.\nWe therefore conclude that Rasta Filter and CMS did not improve accuracy.\nThis happens because Data in TIMIT were recorded with high-quality desktop microphones in a clean environment and does not include session variability between train and test. In this case, temporal coefficients and normalization methods remove useful information.\nIn addition, our experiments reveals that linear and RBF kernels give equal performance with a small favor for linear SVM.\nThus, as a future work, we will try to study the performance of SVM for speaker identification task by using all dialects of the TIMIT corpus and eventually extend our study to other different environments with acoustic mismatch.

In this paper, we first study a set of different features extraction methods such as linear predictive coding (LPC), mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and perceptual linear prediction (PLP) with several features normalization techniques like rasta filtering and cepstral mean subtraction (CMS). Based on this, a comparative evaluation of these features is performed on the task of text independent speaker identification using a combination between gaussian mixture models (GMM) and linear and non-linear kernels based on support vector machine (SVM).",
