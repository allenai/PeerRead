Instead, we embed semantic concepts (or synsets) as defined in WordNet and represent a word token in a particular context by estimating a distribution over relevant semantic concepts. We use the new, context-sensitive embeddings in a model for predicting prepositional phrase(PP) attachments and jointly learn the concept embeddings and model parameters. We show that using context-sensitive embeddings improves the accuracy of the PP attachment model by 5.4% absolute points, which amounts to a 34.4% relative reduction in errors.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 15:40:51 GMT  (198kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02925v1", "ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["pradeep dasigi", "waleed ammar", "chris dyer", "eduard h hovy"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.02925"}
