      "text" : "Objective: To transform heterogeneous clinical data from electronic health records into\nclinically meaningful constructed features using data driven method that rely, in part, on\ntemporal relations among data.\nMaterials and Methods: The clinically meaningful representations of medical concepts\nand patients are the key for health analytic applications. Most of existing approaches\ndirectly construct features mapped to raw data (e.g., ICD or CPT codes), or utilize some\nontology mapping such as SNOMED codes. However, none of the existing approaches\nleverage EHR data directly for learning such concept representation. We propose a new\nway to represent heterogeneous medical concepts (e.g., diagnoses, medications and\nprocedures) based on co-occurrence patterns in longitudinal electronic health records.\nThe intuition behind the method is to map medical concepts that are co-occuring closely\nin time to similar concept vectors so that their distance will be small. We also derive a\nsimple method to construct patient vectors from the related medical concept vectors.\nResults: We evaluate similar medical concepts across diagnosis, medication and\nprocedure. The results show xx% relevancy between similar pairs of medical concepts.\nOur proposed representation significantly improves the predictive modeling performance\nfor onset of heart failure (HF), where classification methods (e.g. logistic regression,\nneural network, support vector machine and K-nearest neighbors) achieve up to 23%\nimprovement in area under the ROC curve (AUC) using this proposed representation.\nConclusion: We proposed an effective method for patient and medical concept\nrepresentation learning. The resulting representation can map relevant concepts together\nand also improves predictive modeling performance."

      "text" : "Growth in use of electronic health records (EHR) in health care delivery is\nopening unprecedented opportunities to predict patient risk, understand what works best\nfor a given patient, and to personalize clinical decision-making. But, raw EHR data,\nrepresented by a heterogeneous mix of elements (e.g., clinical measures, diagnoses,\nmedications, procedures) and voluminous unstructured content, may not be optimal for\nanalytic uses or even for clinical care. While higher order clinical features (e.g., disease\nphenotypes) are intuitively more meaningful and can reduce data volume, they may fail\nto capture meaningful information inherent to patient data. We explored whether novel\ndata driven methods that rely on the temporal occurrence of EHR data elements could\nyield higher order intuitively interpretable features that both capture pathophysiologic\nrelations inherent to data and improve performance of predictive models.\nGrowth in use of EHRs is raising fundamental questions on optimal ways to\nrepresent structured and unstructured data. Medical ontologies such as SNOMED,\nRxNorm and LOINC offer structured hierarchical means of compressing data and of\nunderstand relations among data from different domains (e.g., disease diagnosis, labs,\nprescriptions). But, these ontologies do not offer the means of extracting meaningful\nrelations inherent to longitudinal patient data. Scalable methods that can detect\npathophysiologic relations inherent to longitudinal EHR data and construct intuitive\nfeatures may accelerate more effective use of EHR data in clinical care and advances in\nperformance of predictive analytics.\nThe abstract concepts inherent to existing ontologies does not provide a means to\nconnect elements in different domains to a common underlying pathophysiologic\nconstructs that are represented by how data elements co-occur in time. The data driven\napproach we developed logically organizes data into higher order constructs.\nHeterogeneous medical data were mapped to a low-dimensional space that accounted for\ntemporal clustering of similar concepts (e.g., A1c lab test, ICD-9 code for diabetes,\nprescription for metformin). Co-occurring clusters (e.g., diabetes and peripheral\nneuropathy) were then identified and formed into higher order pathophysiologic feature\nsets organized by prevalence.\nWe propose to learn such a medical concept representation on longitudinal EHR\ndata based on a state-of-the-art neural network model. We also propose an efficient way\nto derive patient representation based on the medical concept representation (or medical\nconcept vectors). We calculated for a set of diseases their closest diseases, medications\nand procedures to demonstrate the clinical knowledge captured by the medical concept\nrepresentations. We use those learned representation for heart failure prediction tasks,\nwhere significant performance improvement up to 23% in AUC can be obtained on many\nclassification models (logistic regression: AUC 0.766 to 0.791, SVM: AUC 0.736 to\n0.791, neural network: AUC 0.779 to 0.814, KNN: AUC 0.637 to 0.785)"

      "text" : "Recently, neural network based representation learning has shown success in\nmany fields such as computer vision [1] [2] [3], audio processing [4] [5] and natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) [6] [7] [8]. We discuss representation learning in NLP, in\nparticular, as our proposed method is based on Skip-gram [6] [9], a popular method for\nlearning word representations.\nMikolov et al. [6] [9] proposed Skip-gram, a simple model based on neural\nnetwork that can learn real-valued multi-dimensional vectors that capture relations\nbetween words by training on massive amount of text. The trained real-valued vectors\nwill have similar values for syntactically and semantically close words such as dog and\ncat or would and could, but distinct values for words that are not. Pennington et al. [10]\nproposed GloVe, a word representation algorithm based on the global co-occurrence\nmatrix. While GloVe and Skip-gram essentially achieve the same goal by taking different\napproaches, GloVe is computationally faster than Skip-gram as it precomputes co-\noccurrence information before the actual learning. Skip-gram, however, requires less\nnumber of hyper-parameters to tune than GloVe, and generally shows better performance\n[11].\nAs natural language text can be seen as a sequence of codes, medical records such as\ndiagnoses, medications and procedures can also be seen as a sequence of codes over time.\nIn this work, we propose a framework for mapping raw medical concepts (e.g., ICD9,\nCPT) into related concept vectors using Skip-gram and validating the utility of the\nresulting medical concept vectors."

      "text" : "Figure 2 depicts a straightforward motivation for using a better representation for\nmedical concepts. Figure 2(a) shows one-hot encoding of N unique diagnoses using N-\ndimensional vectors. It is easy to see that this is not an effective representation in that the\ndifference between Bronchitis and Pneumonia are the same as the difference between\nPneumonia and Obesity. Figure 2(b) shows a better representation in that Bronchitis and\nPneumonia share similar values compared to other diagnoses. By using Skip-gram, we\nwill be able to better represent not only diagnoses but also medications and procedures as\nmulti-dimensional real-valued vectors that will capture the latent relations between them.\nFigure 3(a) is an example of a patient medical record in a temporal order. Skip-gram\nassumes the meaning of a concept is determined by its context(or neighbors). Therefore,\ngiven a sequence of concepts, Skip-gram picks a target concept and tries to predict its\nneighbors, as shown by Figure 3(b). Then we slide the context window, pick the next\ntarget and do the same context prediction, which is shown by Figure 3(c). Since the goal\nof Skip-gram is to learn the vector representation of concepts, we need to convert medical\nconcepts to D-dimensional vectors, where D is a user-chosen value typically between 50\n(a) Patient medical records on a timeline\nand 1000. Therefore the actual prediction is conducted with vectors, as shown by Figure\n3(d), where c! is the concept at the t-th timestep, \uD835\uDC2F \uD835\uDC50! the vector that represents c!. The\ngoal of Skip-gram is to maximize the following average log probability,\n1 \uD835\uDC47 log\uD835\uDC5D \uD835\uDC50!!!|\uD835\uDC50!\n!!!!!!,!!!\n!\n!!!\n,where\n\uD835\uDC5D \uD835\uDC50!!!|\uD835\uDC50! = \uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC5D \uD835\uDC2F \uD835\uDC50!!!\n! \uD835\uDC2F \uD835\uDC50!\n\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC5D \uD835\uDC2F \uD835\uDC50 !\uD835\uDC2F \uD835\uDC50!!!!!\nwhere T is the length of the sequence of medical concepts, w the size of the context\nwindow, \uD835\uDC50! the target medical concept at timestep t, \uD835\uDC50!!! the neighboring medical concept\nat timestep t+j, \uD835\uDC2F \uD835\uDC50 the vector that represents the medical concept c, N the total number\nof medical concepts. The size of the context window is typically set to 5, giving us 10\nconcepts surrounding the target concept. Note that the conditional probability is\nexpressed as a softmax function. Simply put, by maximizing the softmax score of the\ninner product of the neighboring concepts, Skip-gram learns real-valued vectors that\nefficiently capture the fine-grained relations between concepts. It needs to be mentioned\nthat our formulation of Skip-gram is different from the original Skip-gram. In Mikolov et\nal. [9], they distinguish the vectors for the target concept and the vectors for the\nneighboring concept. In our formulation, we force the two sets of vectors to hold the\nsame values as suggested by [15]. This simpler formulation allowed faster training and\nimpressive results."

[9] was that the word vectors supported syntactically and semantically meaningful\nlinear operations that enabled word analogy calculations such that the resulting vector of\nKing – Man + Woman is closest to Queen vector.\nWe expect that the medical concept representations learned by Skip-gram will show\nsimilar properties so that the concept vectors will support clinically meaningful vector\nadditions. Then, an efficient representation of a patient will be as simple as converting all\nmedical concepts in his medical history to medical concept vectors, then summing all\nthose vectors to obtain a single representation vector, as shown in Figure 4.

We randomly chose 1,000 diagnoses from 10 uppermost\ncategories of ICD-9, which are displayed at the top of the figure. It is readily visible that\ndiagnoses are generally well grouped by their corresponding categories. However, if\ndiagnoses from the same category are in fact quite different, they should be apart.

Then we briefly mention the models to use, followed by the description of\nthe data processing steps to create the training data for all models. Lastly, the evaluation\nstrategy will be followed by implementation details.\nHeart failure prediction task: Onset of HF is associated with a high level of disability,\nhealth care costs and mortality (roughly ~50% risk of mortality within 5 years of\ndiagnosis). [20] [21] There has been relatively little progress in slowing the progression\nof HF severity, largely because it is difficult to detect before actual diagnosis. As a\nconsequence, intervention has primarily been confined to the time period after diagnosis,\nwith little or no impact on disease progression. Earlier detection of HF could lead to\nimproved outcomes through patient engagement and more assertive treatment with\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors or Angiotensin II receptor blockers\n(ARBs), mild exercise, and reduced salt intake, and possibly other options [22] [23] [24]\n[25].\nModels for performance comparison: We aim to emphasize the effectiveness of the\nmedical concept representation and the patient representation derived from it. Therefore\nwe trained four popular classifiers, namely logistic regression, MLP, SVM, and KNN\nusing both one-hot vectors and medical concept vectors.\nDefinition of Cases and Controls: Criteria for incident onset of HF, are described in [26]\nand were adopted from [27]. The criteria are defined as: 1) Qualifying ICD-9 codes for\nHF appeared as a diagnosis code in either the encounter, the problem list, or the\nmedication order fields. Qualifying ICD-9 codes are listed in the supplementary section.\nQualifying ICD-9 codes with image and other related orders were excluded because these\norders often represent a suspicion of HF, where the results are often negative; 2) a\nminimum of three clinical encounters with qualifying ICD-9 codes had to occur within 12\nmonths of each other, where the date of diagnosis was assigned to the earliest of the three\ndates. If the time span between the first and second appearances of the HF diagnostic\ncode was greater than 12 months, the date of the second encounter was used as the first\nqualifying encounter; 3) ages 50 or greater to less than 85 at the time of HF diagnosis.\nUp to ten (nine on average) eligible primary care clinic-, sex-, and age-matched\n(in 5-year age intervals) controls were selected for each incident HF case. Primary care\npatients were eligible as controls if they had no HF diagnosis in the 12-month period\nbefore diagnosis of the incident HF case. Control subjects were required to have their\nfirst office encounter within one year of the matching HF case patient’s first office visit,\nand have at least one office encounter 30 days before or any time after the case’s HF\ndiagnosis date to ensure similar duration of observations among cases and controls.\nFrom 265,336 Sutter-PAMF patients, 3,884 incident HF cases and 28,903 control\npatients were identified.\nData processing: To train the four models, we generated the dataset again from the\nencounter, medication order, procedure order and problem list records of 3,884 cases and\n28,903 controls. Based on the HF diagnosis date (HFDx) of each patient, we extracted all\nrecords from the 18-month period before the HFDx. To train the models with medical\nconcept vectors, we converted the medical records to patient vectors as shown in Figure 4.\nTo train the models with one-hot encoding, we converted the medical records to\naggregated one-hot vectors in the same fashion as Figure 4, using one-hot vectors instead\nof medical concept vectors.\nIn order to study the relation between the medical concept vectors trained with\ndifferent sizes of data and their influence on the models’ prediction performance, we used\nthree kinds of medical concept vectors: 1) The one trained with only HF cases (3,884\npatients), 2) The one trained with HF cases and controls (32,787 patients), 3) The one\ntrained with the full sample (265,336 patients). Note that medical concept vectors trained\nwith smaller number of patients cover less number of medical concepts. Therefore, when\nconverting patient records to patient vectors as Figure 4, we excluded all medical codes\nthat did not have matching medical concept vectors. All input vectors were normalized to\nzero mean and unit variance.\nEvaluation strategy: We used six-fold cross validation to train and evaluate all models,\nand to estimate how well the models will generalize to independent datasets. Prediction\nperformance was measured using area under the ROC curve (AUC), on data not used in\nthe training. We used the confidence score to calculate its AUC for SVM. Detailed\nexplanation of the cross validation is given in the supplementary section.\nImplementation details: Logistic regression and MLP were implemented with Theano\nand trained with Adadelta. SVM and KNN were implemented with Python Scikit-Learn.\nAll models were trained by the same machine used for medical concept representation\nlearning. Hyper-parameters used for training each model are described in the\nsupplementary section.\nEvaluation of Heart Failure Prediction\nFigure 6 shows the average AUC of 6-fold cross validations of various models\nand input vectors. The colors represent different training input vectors. The error bars\nindicate the standard deviation derived from the 6-fold cross evaluation. The power of\nmedical concept representation learning is evident as all models show significant\nimprovement in the HF prediction performance. Logistic regression and SVM, both being\nlinear models, show similar performance when trained with medical concept vectors,\nalthough SVM benefits slightly more from using the better representation of medical\nconcepts. MLP also benefits from using medical concept vectors, and, being a non-linear\nmodel, shows better performance compared to logistic regression and SVM. It is\ninteresting that KNN benefits the most from using the medical concept vectors, even the\nones trained on the smallest dataset. Considering the fact that KNN classification is based\non the distances between data points, this is a clear indication that proper medical concept\nrepresentation can alleviate the sparsity problem induced by the simple one-hot encoding.\nFigure 6 also tells us that medical concept representation is best learned with a\nlarge dataset as shown by Mikolov et al. [6] However, in most models, especially KNN,\neven the medical concept vectors trained with the smallest number of patients improves\nthe prediction performance. It is quite surprising given the fact that we used less amount\nof information by excluding unmatched medical codes when using medical concept\nvectors trained with a small number of patients, the models still show better prediction\nperformance. This again is a clear proof that medical concept representation learning\nprovides more effective way to represent medical concepts than one-hot encoding.\nmedical concept vectors. Considering the high-dimensionality of one-hot encoding,\ntraining the models with medical concept vectors should provide significant speed-up, as\nshown by the last row of Table 4. This shows that medical concept vectors not only\nimprove performance, but also significantly reduce the training time.\nBefore discussing future work, we would like to emphasize the fact that our entire\nexperiments were conducted completely without expert knowledge such as medical\nontologies or features designed by medical experts. Using only the medical order records,\nwe were able to produce clinically meaningful representation of medical concepts. This is\nan inspiring discovery that can be extended for numerous other medical problems."

      "heading" : "Future Work",
      "text" : "Although medical concept vectors have shown impressive results, it would be\neven more effective if deeper medical information could be embedded such as lab results\nor patient demographic information. This would enable us to represent the medical state\nof patients more accurately.\nUsing expert knowledge is another thing we should try. Even though we have\nshown impressive performance only by using medical records, this does not mean we\ncannot benefit from well-established expert medical knowledge, such as specific features\nor medical ontologies.\nAnother natural extension of our work is to address other medical problems.\nAlthough this work focused on the early detection of heart failure, our approach is very\ngeneral that it could be applied to any kind of disease prediction problem. And the\nmedical concept vectors can also be used in numerous medical applications as well."

      "heading" : "CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We proposed a new way of representing heterogeneous medical concepts as real-\nvalued vectors and constructing efficient patient representation using the state-of-the-art\nDeep Learning method. We have qualitatively shown that the trained medical concept\nvectors indeed captured medical insights compatible with our medical knowledge and\nexperience. For the heart failure prediction task, medical concept vectors improved the\nperformance of many classifiers, thus quantitatively proving its effectiveness. We\ndiscussed the limitation of our method and possible future works, which include deeper\nutilization of medical information, combining expert knowledge into our framework, and\nexpanding our approach to various medical applications."

    "abstractText" : "Objective: To transform heterogeneous clinical data from electronic health records into clinically meaningful constructed features using data driven method that rely, in part, on temporal relations among data. Materials and Methods: The clinically meaningful representations of medical concepts and patients are the key for health analytic applications. Most of existing approaches directly construct features mapped to raw data (e.g., ICD or CPT codes), or utilize some ontology mapping such as SNOMED codes. However, none of the existing approaches leverage EHR data directly for learning such concept representation. We propose a new way to represent heterogeneous medical concepts (e.g., diagnoses, medications and procedures) based on co-occurrence patterns in longitudinal electronic health records. The intuition behind the method is to map medical concepts that are co-occuring closely in time to similar concept vectors so that their distance will be small. We also derive a simple method to construct patient vectors from the related medical concept vectors. Results: We evaluate similar medical concepts across diagnosis, medication and procedure. The results show xx% relevancy between similar pairs of medical concepts. Our proposed representation significantly improves the predictive modeling performance for onset of heart failure (HF), where classification methods (e.g. logistic regression, neural network, support vector machine and K-nearest neighbors) achieve up to 23% improvement in area under the ROC curve (AUC) using this proposed representation. Conclusion: We proposed an effective method for patient and medical concept representation learning. The resulting representation can map relevant concepts together and also improves predictive modeling performance.",
