In DIRS [1], no weights don’t assign to the extracted features and weights for all features is one, although some features more effect to retrieval. Feature weighting is a feature importance ranking algorithm where weights, not only ranks, are obtained [14]. Commonly used feature weighting methods only consider the distribution of a feature in the documents and do not consider class information for the weights of the features. Several methods were reported for feature weighting to be based on such as term frequency (TF) [16], inverse document frequency (IDF) [17]. In [15], a framework for integrating multiple, heterogeneous feature spaces in the kmeans clustering algorithm is presented. In this paper, we propose a feature weighting method for increase performance of Document Image Retrieval System based on exact word matching. The proposed method weights each feature in the words according to the different role of the features during the indexing process.

A detailed survey on document image retrieval up to 1997 can be found in Doermann [7]. In [10] an overview on document image retrieval system is presented. Word level image matching and retrieval has been attempted for printed documents [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13]. Leydier et al [8] used DIP techniques to create a pattern dictionary of each document and then they performed word spotting by selecting the feature of the gradient angle and a matching algorithm.

In [4] a novel partial matching algorithm is designed for morphological matching of word form variants in a language. In [3] using of document image processing techniques extract powerful features for the description of the word images. In [6], Shijian Lu annotates word images by using a set of topological shape features including character ascenders /descenders, character holes, and character water reservoirs. With the annotated word shape codes, document images can be retrieved by either query keywords or a query document image.

      "text" : "Figure1 depicts the overall structure of the Document Image Retrieval System Base on Word Spotting [1]. This system composed of two different sections: the offline and the online operation. In the offline operation the repository of document images are examined and the results are stored in a database. This section consists of three stages. At first stage the document transports the preprocessing stage which includes a binarization with the Otsu method, a mean filter and a skeletonization operation. The word segmentation stage is following the preprocessing. Its primary goal is to detect the word blocks. This is achieved with the continuously use of vertical and horizontal projections (Recursive X-Y Cuts). In the final stage of the offline operation the features of each word are calculated and stored in the database. For each word block, a total of 7 different features in use, namely, Width to height ratio, Word area density, Center of gravity, Vertical projection, Top–bottom shape projections, Upper grid features and down grid features.\n))(( 100 IHIW\nBP E = (1)\nWhere (BP) is the number of black pixels in the word bounding box, (IW) is the width and (IH) is the height of the word bounding box in pixels. In order to calculate center of gravity, the vertical and horizontal center of gravity must be determined by the following equations:\n)0,0(\n)0,1(\nM\nM Cx =\n)0,0(\n)1,0(\nM\nM C y =\nWhere Cx is the horizontal center and Cy the vertical center of gravity and M (p, q) the geometrical moments of rank p+q:\n),()()( yxf height\ny\nwidth\nx M\nx\nq\np\nypq ∑ ∑= (4)\nThe x and y determine the image pixels. Finally, the center of the gravity feature is defined as equal to the Euclidean distance from the upper left corner of the image:\n2 22\nyx ccCOG += (5)\nThe vertical projection is defined as the number of black pixels that they are residing in each column i. This feature consists of the first twenty (20) coefficients of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of the smoothed and normalized vertical projection. The vertical projection of “performance” is depicted in figure 2.\nIn order to calculate the top shape projection, the word image is scanned from top to bottom. The first time a black pixel is found all the following pixels of the same column are converted to black. The top projection of “performance” is depicted in figure 3. This feature consists of the first 25 coefficients of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of the smoothed and normalized top projection.\nThe bottom shape projection is found similarly. The word image is scanned from bottom to top and all the pixels are converted to black until a black pixel is found. This feature consists of the first 25 coefficients of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) of the smoothed and normalized bottom projection.\nThe upper grid features (UGF) is a ten element vector with binary values extracted from the upper part of each word image. The down grid features (DGF) is a ten element vector with binary values extracted from the lower part of each word image. The online operation of the DIRS is the visible part from the user perspective. It consists of the web interface from which the users enter the query word and see the results. The creation of the word’s image, the preprocessing and features extraction stages which are the same with that in the offline operation, and finally, the matching process of the query word’s features with them in the database. The matching procedure can identify the word images of the documents that are more similar to the query word through the extracted feature vectors [1]."

      "text" : "Document Image Retrieval System\n(FWDIRS)\nThe overall structure of proposed system is displayed in figure 5. The proposed system is designed to perform weighting features based on coefficient of multiple correlations. In fact, main difference between this system and DIRS is Feature Weighting and Similarity Measurement stage. In the feature weighting stage, stored features in database weighted by its importance. In DIRS, no weights assign to the extracted features and weights for all feature equal one, although some features more effect to retrieval. This method weights each feature according to the different role of the features during the indexing process. Next section describes this method in details.\n4.1 Feature Weighting\nThe basic idea of feature weighting is inspired from weighting attributes by coefficient of multiple correlations [2]. Coefficient of multiple correlations can be used to describe the synthesized effects and correlation of each attribute (Feature). The degree of multiple correlations of several attributes and one attribute are measured by coefficient of multiple correlations. Coefficient of multiple correlations can be calculated using coefficient of single correlation and coefficient of partial correlation. Let attribute y be a function and attributes x1, x2,…, xn be\nvariables, then the coefficient of multiple correlation between y and x1, x2,…, xk (when there are k variables) is Ry,1 2···k . The formula is as follows when there are k variables:\n)1)...(1)(1(1 2 )1...(12. 2 1.2 2 1...12, −−−−−= kykyyky rrrR (6)\nIn which, ry1, ry2.1, ryk.12··· (k−1) are coefficient of single correlation and coefficient of partial correlation. If considering a selected attribute xi using the correlations between the attribute and all the other attributes - the coefficient of multiple correlations λx1,x2,… ,xk which is simply represented as λi, it reflects the ability of those attributes other than xi to replace xi. When λi = 1, xi can be removed or the weight of which should be decreased; when λi is very small, non- xi values cannot replace it and should increase its weight. Thus, |λi| −1 can be used to calculate the weight wi:\nkiW k\nj i\ni\ni ,...,2,1,\n1\n1\n1\n== ∑ = −\n−\nλ\nλ (7)\nwi is the absolute value of coefficient of multiple correlation such that 0≤wi≤1. Assume DO= {do1, do2, do3,…, don} is the array of data objects that stored in database. After calculate weights for each feature, weighted data objects are: DOi =W. DOi, i=1, 2… n.\nW=\n    \n\n    \n\nmw\nw\nw\nw\n000\n000\n000\n000\n3\n2\n1\n(8)\n4.2 Similarity Measurement\nThe matching procedure can identify the word images of the documents that are more similar to the query word through the extracted feature vectors. In this system weighted Minkowski distance between the features of the query image and the word included in the processing document is calculated:\n},...,2,1{],[),( 93\n1 niqdowqdod k kikki =−= ∑ = (9)\nWhere d (doi, q) is the Minkowski distance of the word i and query q, k is the feature which is being compared, qk is the query descriptor, doik is descriptor of word i and wk is weight of kth feature."

      "text" : "In our experiments, the evaluation of the proposed system was based on 100 document images. The database of the documents has been created automatically from various digital text documents. In order to calculate the precision and recall values 30 searches were made using random words. The precision and recall values obtained are depicted in Figure 5.\nAs shown in Figure 6, by using coefficient of multiple correlations for feature weighting, performance of DIRS in term of average prcision is increased and term of average of recall is fixed. Table 1 dpicts comparison the average precision and average recall of the approach with DIRS [1] and WDIRS [3].\nAs shown in Table 1, the average precision in WDIRS and DIRS is 55.43% and 87.8%, repectively. Also, average recall in WDIRS and DIRS is 94.78%. and 99.26%, respectively. After apply feature weighting method to DIRS the average precision is 93.23% and average recall become 98.66% respectively. Furthermore, in order to test the robustness of the proposed method to the type of fonts, the query font was changed to ‘‘Tahoma’’.\nAs shown in Figure 7, by proposed method for feature weighting, performance of DIRS in term of average precision and Recall is increased.\nTable 2 dpicts comparison the average precision and\naverage recall of the approach with DIRS [1].\nAs shown in Table 1, the average precision in DIRS is 89.44% . Also, average recall in DIRS is 88.05%. After\napply feature weighting method to DIRS the average precision is 90.5% and average recall become 91.73%.\n6.1 Validating the Weighting Algorithm\nTo evaluate the proposed feature weighting method, we cluster storing data in database without using weighted features at first. In this approach, each word is a cluster. In this problem, the cardinality of cluster is unknown. Since, we propose Improved K-means algorithm (IK-Means) for clustering data. The Improved K-means algorithm uses a specified threshold for distance between words to create a new cluster. Improved k-means can be formally defined in the following steps:\n1. Specify the cluster threshold to create new cluster. 2. create_new_cluster=true. 3. Assign d (1) to c (1). 4. For i form 2 to n\na. For all clusters do\ni. Calculate distance (d (i), c (j)).\nii. If(distance(d(i),c(j))≤threshold)\nassign d(i) to c(j) and create_new_cluster=false.\nb. If (create_new_cluster is true) then create a\ncluster, k=k+1, c (k) =d (i).\n5. Run K-Means using the found clusters, and the full\noriginal dataset.\nWhere d (i) is i th record in database and c (j) is centroid of cluster j. after clustering the stored data in the database without using the weighted features, we clustering the data with using weighted features. In order to test the performance of the weighted features based IK-Means algorithm, experiment results of both original IK-means algorithm and weighted features based IK-means algorithm, a data set with 10 data points was clustered in the experiment.\nFigure 7 shows that 2 objects which are Cluster 2 are clustered to Cluster 1. Figure 8 shows that all objects are correctly clustered to Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 respectively. Moreover, we use Typical objective functions in clustering formalize the goal of attaining high intra-cluster similarity (words within a cluster are similar) and low inter cluster similarity (words from different clusters are dissimilar). This is an internal criterion for the quality of a clustering."

    "abstractText" : "Feature weighting is a technique used to approximate the optimal degree of influence of individual features. This paper presents a feature weighting method for Document Image Retrieval System (DIRS) based on keyword spotting. In this method, we weight the feature using coefficient of multiple correlations. Coefficient of multiple correlations can be used to describe the synthesized effects and correlation of each feature. The aim of this paper is to show that feature weighting increases the performance of DIRS. After applying the feature weighting method to DIRS the average precision is 93.23% and average recall become 98.66% respectively.",
