      "text" : "It has become increasingly common within the computer vision community to treat image classification on ImageNet [37] not as an end in itself, but rather as a “pretext task” for training deep convolution neural networks (CNNs [27, 25]) to learn good general-purpose features. This practice of first training a CNN to perform image classification on ImageNet (i.e. pre-training) and then adapting these features for a new target task (i.e. fine-tuning) has become the de facto standard for solving a wide variety of computer vision problems. Using ImageNet pre-trained CNN features, impressive results have been obtained on several image classification datasets [13, 35], object detection [16, 39], action recognition [41], human pose estimation [9], image segmentation [10], optical flow [47], image captioning [12, 22] and others [26].\nOur work can be found on our website http://minyounghuh.com/papers/analysis\nGiven the success of ImageNet pre-trained CNN features, it is only natural to ask: what is it about the ImageNet dataset that makes the learnt features as good as they are? One school of thought believes that it is the sheer size of the dataset (1.2 million labelled images) that forces the representation to be general. Others argue that it is the large number (1000) of distinct object classes, which forces the network to learn a hierarchy of generalizable features. Yet others believe that the secret sauce is not just the large number of classes, but the fact that many of these classes are visually similar (e.g. many different breeds of dogs), turning this into a fine-grained recognition task, and therefore pushing the representation to work harder. But, while almost everyone in computer vision seems to have their own opinion on this hot topic, very little hard empirical evidence has so far been produced.\nIn this work, we systematically investigate which aspects of the ImageNet task are most critical for learning good general-purpose features. We evaluated the features by finetuning for object detection on PASCAL-VOC 2007 dataset (PASCAL-DET), action classification on PASCALVOC 2012 dataset (PASCAL-ACT-CLS) and scene classification on the SUN dataset (SUN-CLS); see Section 3 for more details. The following is a summary of our main findings:\n1. How many pre-training ImageNet examples are sufficient for transfer learning? Pre-training with only half the ImageNet data (500 images per class instead of 1000) results in only a small drop in transfer learning performance (1.5 mAP drop on PASCAL-DET). This drop is much smaller than the drop on the ImageNet classification task itself. See Section 4 and Figure 1 for details.\n2. How many pre-training ImageNet classes are sufficient for transfer learning? Pre-training with an order of magnitude fewer classes (127 classes instead of 1000) results in only a small drop in transfer learning performance (drop of 2.8 mAP on PASCAL-DET). Quite interestingly, we also found that for some transfer tasks, pre-training with\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n08 61\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 3\n0 A\nug 2\nfewer number of classes leads to better performance. See Section 5.1 and Figure 2 for details.\n3. How important is fine-grained recognition for learning good features for transfer learning? The above experiment also suggests that transferable features are learnt even when a CNN is pre-trained with a set of classes that do not require fine-grained discrimination. See Section 5.2 and Figure 2 for details.\n4. Given the same budget of pre-training images, should we have more classes or more images per class? Training with fewer classes but more images per class performs slightly better than training with more classes but fewer images per class. See Section 5.5 and Table 2 for details.\n5. Is more data always helpful? We found that training using 771 ImageNet classes that excludes all PASCAL VOC classes, achieves nearly the same performance on PASCALDET as training on complete ImageNet. Further experiments confirm that blindly adding more training data does not always lead to better performance and can sometimes hurt performance. See Section 6, and Table 9 for more details."

      "text" : "Understanding internal representations of CNN: For understanding what information is encoded by different CNN features, several works have developed feature visualization methods using either deconvolution [50], backpropagation[40, 52] or by training a decoder network [14]. Another line of prior work investigated questions such as how distributed are CNN representations [2, 43], what is the the effect of feature transformations such as binarization [2, 14], how do CNN features change with systematic variations in scene factors [3], how invariant are features to different viewpoints [5] and how is class specific information organized in groups of CNN units [46, 44]. An interesting observation that CNNs have “blindspots” was made by [43]. Recently, a mathematical framework for analyzing CNN features was provided by [28]. In contrast to analyzing features learned by training on the full ImageNet dataset, our paper analyzes what aspects of data are important for learning transferable features.\nFactors that affect fine-tuning: The question of whether pre-training should be terminated early to prevent overfitting and what layers should be used for transfer learning was studied by [2, 49]. A thorough investigation of good architectural choices for transfer learning was conducted by [4]. In contrast to these works, we use a fixed finetuning procedure and investigate the factors of variation in pretraining data that effect transfer performance.\nOther pre-training methods: A common assumption in supervised pre-training is that large quantity of expen-\nsive manually-supervised training data is required. The possibility of using large amounts of unlabelled data for feature learning has therefore been very attractive. Numerous methods for learning features by optimizing some auxiliary criterion of the data itself have been proposed. The most well-known such criteria are image reconstruction [7, 38, 31, 29, 34, 23] (see [6] for a comprehensive overview) and feature slowness [48, 18].\nUnfortunately, these unsupervised methods turned out not to be competitive with those obtained from supervised ImageNet pre-training. To try and force better feature generalization, more recent “self-supervised” methods use more difficult data prediction auxiliary tasks in an effort to make the CNNs “work harder”. Attempted self-supervised tasks include predictions of ego-motion [1, 20], spatial context [11, 33, 30], temporal context [45], and even color [51] and sound [32]. While features learned using these methods often come close to ImageNet performance, to date, none has been able to beat it. Therefore, in this work, we are trying to understand what is the secret to ImageNet’s continuing success."

      "text" : "The process of using supervised learning to initialize CNN parameters using the task of ImageNet classification is referred to as pre-training. The pre-trained CNN is adapted by continued training on a target dataset, this process is referred to as finetuning. All of our experiments use the Caffe [21] implementation of the a single network architecture proposed by Krizhevsky et al. [25]. We refer to this architecture as AlexNet.\nWe closely follow the experimental setup of Agrawal et al. [2] for evaluating the generalization of pre-trained features on three transfer tasks: PASCAL VOC 2007 object detection (PASCAL-DET), PASCAL VOC 2012 action recognition (PASCAL-ACT-CLS) and scene classification on SUN dataset (SUN-CLS). For PASCAL-DET, we used the PASCAL VOC 2007 train/val for finetuning using the experimental setup and code provided by FasterRCNN [36] and report performance on the test set. For PASCAL-ACT-CLS, we used PASCAL VOC 2012 train/val for finetuning and testing using the experimental setup and code provided by R*CNN [17]. For SUN-CLS we used the same train/val/test splits as used by [2]. Finetuning on SUN was performed by first replacing the FC-8 layer in the AlexNet model with a randomly initialized, and fully connected layer with 397 output units. Finetuning was performed for 50K iterations using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with an initial learning rate of 0.001 which was reduced by a factor of 10 (1/10-th) every 20K iterations.\nIn order to account for difference in performance that may result from different runs of Faster-RCNN and R*CNN, we ran each finetuning experiment 3 times to com-\npute the variance in performance. We report the performance as mean± standard deviation. Due to computational constraints we only report SUN-CLS results using a single run. As reported by [2], error bars on SUN-CLS are small, therefore having a single run should not affect the conclusions that we draw.\nIn some experiments we pre-train on ImageNet using a different number of images per class. The model with 1000 images/class uses the original ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 training set. Models with N images/class for N < 1000 are trained by drawing a random sample of N images from all images of that class made available as part of the ImageNet training set."

The variation in performance with amount of pre-training data when these models are finetuned for PASCAL-DET, PASCAL-ACT-CLS and SUN-CLS is shown in Figure 1. For PASCAL-DET, the mean average precision (mAP) for CNNs with 1000, 500 and 250 images/class is found to be 58.3, 57.0 and 54.6. A similar trend is observed for PASCAL-ACT-CLS and SUNCLS. These results indicate that using half the amount of pre-training data leads to only a marginal reduction in per-\nformance on transfer tasks. It’s important to note that the performance on the ImageNet classification task (the pretraining task) steadily increases with the amount of training data, whereas on transfer tasks, the performance increase with respect to additional pre-training data is significantly slower."

      "text" : "transfer performance\nThe 1000 classes of the ImageNet challenge [37] are derived from leaves of the WordNet tree [15]. Using this tree, it is possible to generate different class taxonomies while keeping the total number of images constant. One can generate taxonomies in two ways: (1) bottom up clustering, wherein the leaf nodes belonging to a common parent are iteratively clustered together (see Figure 3), or (2) by fixing the distance of the nodes from the root node (i.e. top down clustering). Using bottom up clustering, 18 possible\ntaxonomies can be generated. Among these, we chose 5 sets of labels constituting 918, 753, 486, 79 and 9 classes respectively. Using top-down clustering only 3 label sets of 127, 10 and 2 can be generated, and we used the one with 127 classes. For studying the effect of number of pretraining classes on transfer performance, we trained separate AlexNet CNNs from scratch using these label sets.\nFigure 2 shows the effect of number of pre-training classes obtained using bottom up clustering of WordNet tree on transfer performance. Table 1 shows the same results for 127 classes obtained from top down clustering. Using only 486 classes results in a performance drop of 1.7 mAP for PASCAL-DET, 0.8% accuracy for SUN-CLS and a boost\nof 0.6 mAP for PASCAL-ACT-CLS. Moreover, only diminishing returns in transfer performance are observed when more than 127 classes are used.\nIt can be argued that the PASCAL task requires discrimination between only 20 classes and therefore pre-training with only 127 classes should not lead to substantial reduction in performance. However, the trend also holds true for SUN-CLS that requires discrimination between 397 classes. These two results taken together suggest that although training with a large number of classes is beneficial, diminishing returns are observed beyond using 127 distinct classes for pre-training.\nFurthermore, for PASCAL-ACT-CLS and SUN-CLS, finetuning on CNNs pre-trained with class set sizes of 918, and 753 actually results in better performance than using all 1000 classes. This can indicate a few things: either having too many classes for pre-training works against learning good generalizable features, or that the original labeling set of ImageNet is suboptimal. If latter is the case, then there exists a better labeling set for ImageNet that can improve the performance on transfer tasks. Though nontrivial, it may be interesting to investigate discovering such an optimal label set."

      "text" : "transferable features?\nImageNet challenge requires a classifier to distinguish between 1000 classes, some of which are very fine-grained, such as different breeds of dogs and cats. Indeed, most humans don’t perform well on ImageNet unless specifically trained [37], and yet are easily able to perform most everyday visual tasks. This raises the question: is fine-grained\nrecognition necessary for CNN models to learn good feature representations, or is coarse-grained object recognition (e.g. just distinguishing cats from dogs) is sufficient?\nNote that the label set of 127 classes from the previous experiment contains 65 classes that are present in the original set of 1000 classes and the remainder are inner nodes of the WordNet tree. However, all these 127 classes (see supplementary materials) represent coarse semantic concepts. As discussed earlier, pre-training with these classes results in only a small drop in transfer performance (see Table 1). This suggests that performing fine-grained recognition is only marginally helpful and does not appear to be critical for learning good transferable features."

      "text" : "Earlier, we have shown that the features learned on the 127 coarse classes perform almost as well on our transfer tasks as the full set of 1000 ImageNet classes. Here we will probe this further by asking a different question: is the feature embedding induced by the coarse class classification task capable of separating the fine labels of ImageNet (which it never saw at training)? To investigate this, we used top-1 and top-5 nearest neighbors in the FC7 feature space to measure the accuracy of identifying finegrained ImageNet classes after training only on a set of coarse classes. We call this measure, “induction accuracy”. As a qualitative example, Figure 5 shows nearest neighbors for a macaque (left) and a schnauzer (right) for feature embeddings trained on ImageNet but with different number of classes. All green-border images below the dotted line indicate instances of correct fine-grain nearest neighbor retrieval for features that were never trained on that class.\nQuantitative results are shown in Figure 4. The results show that when 127 classes are used, fine-grained recognition k-NN performance is only about 15% lower compared to training directly for these fine-grained classes (i.e. baseline accuracy). This is rather surprising and suggests that\nCNNs implicitly discover features capable of distinguishing between finer classes while attempting to distinguish between relatively coarse classes."

      "text" : "Investigating whether the network learns features relevant for fine-grained recognition by training on coarse classes begs the reverse question: does training with finegrained classes induce features relevant for coarse recognition? If this is indeed the case, then we would expect\nthat when a CNN makes an error, it is more likely to confuse a sub-class (i.e. error in fine-grained recognition) with other sub-classes of the same coarse class. This effect can be measured by computing the difference between the accuracy of classifying the coarse class and the average accuracy of individually classifying all the sub-classes of this coarse class (please see supplementary materials for details).\nFigure 6 shows the results. We find that coarse semantic classes such as dogs, reptiles, clothing etc that contain visually similar sub-classes show the hypothesized effect, whereas classes such as instruments and buildings that contain visually dissimilar subclasses do not exhibit this effect. These results indicate that subclasses that share a common visual structure allow the CNN to learn features that are more generalizable. This might suggest a way to improve feature generalization by making class labels respect visual commonality rather than simply WordNet semantics."

      "text" : "Results in previous sections show that it is possible to achieve good performance on transfer tasks using significantly less pre-training data and fewer pre-training classes. However it is unclear what is more important – the number of classes or the number or examples per class. One extreme is to only have 1 class and all 1.2M images from this class and the other extreme is to have 1.2M classes and 1 image per class. It is clear that both ways of splitting the data will result in poor generalization, so the answer must lie somewhere in-between.\nTo investigate this, we split the same amount of pretraining data in two ways: (1) more classes with fewer images per class, and (2) fewer classes with more images per class. We use datasets of size 500K, 250K and 125K images for this experiment. For 500K images, we considered two ways of constructing the training set – (1) 1000 classes with 500 images/class, and (2) 500 classes with 1000 images/class. Similar splits were made for data budgets of 250K and 125K images. The 500, 250 and 125 classes for these experiments were drawn from a uniform distribution among the 1000 ImageNet classes. Similarly, the image subsets containing 500, 250 and 125 images were drawn from a uniform distribution among the images that belong to the class.\nThe results presented in Table 2 show that having more\nimages per class with fewer number of classes results in features that perform very slightly better on PASCALDET, whereas for SUN-CLS, the performance is comparable across the two settings."

      "text" : "are also present in a target task?\nIt is natural to expect that higher correlation between pretraining and transfer tasks leads to better performance on a transfer task. This indeed has been shown to be true in [49]. One possible source of correlation between pre-training and transfer tasks are classes common to both tasks. In order to investigate how strong is the influence of these common classes, we ran an experiment where we removed all the classes from ImageNet that are contained in the PASCAL challenge. PASCAL has 20 classes, some of which map to more than one ImageNet class and thus, after applying this exclusion criterion we are only left with 771 ImageNet classes.\nTable 3 compares the results on PASCAL-DET when the PASCAL-removed-ImageNet is used for pre-training against the original ImageNet and a baseline of pretraining on the Places [53] dataset. The PASCAL-removedImageNet achieves mAP of 57.8 (compared to 58.3 with the full ImageNet) indicating that training on ImageNet classes that are not present in PASCAL is sufficient to learn features that are also good for PASCAL classes."

      "heading" : "6. Does data augmentation from non-target",
      "text" : "classes always improve performance?\nThe analysis using PASCAL-removed ImageNet indicates that pre-training on non-PASCAL classes aids performance on PASCAL. This raises the question: is it always better to add pre-training data from additional classes that are not part of the target task? We investigated this question by first splitting ImageNet classes into two sets randomly: ran-split A and ran-split B (Figure 7). In order to determine if additional data helps performance for classes in split A, we pre-trained two CNNs – one for classifying all classes in split A and the other for classifying all classes in both split A and B (i.e. full dataset). We then finetuned the last layer of the network trained on the full dataset on split A only. If it is the case that additional data from split B helps performance on split A, then the CNN pre-trained with the full dataset should perform better than CNN pre-trained only on split A. Figure 9 shows the results of this experiment for both splits and confirms the intuition that additional data is indeed useful.\nHowever, under a random class split within ImageNet, we are almost certain to have extremely similar classes (e.g. two different breeds of dogs) ending up on the different sides of the split. So, what we have shown so far is that we can improve performance on, say, husky classification by also training on poodles. But we can also ask: does adding arbitrary, unrelated classes, such as fire trucks, help dog classification?\nTo test this, we constructed the “minimal” ImageNet split. The classes in minimal split A do not share any com-\nmon ancestor with minimal split B up until the nodes at depth 4 of the WordNet hierarchy (Figure 7). This ensures that any class in split A is sufficiently disjoint from split B. Split A has 522 classes and split B has 478 classes (N.B.: for consistency, random splits A and B also had the same number of classes). In order to intuitively understand the difference between min splits A and B, we have visualized a random sample of images in these splits in Figure 8. Min split A consists of mostly static images and min split B consists of living objects.\nContrary to the earlier observation, Figure 9 shows that both min split A and B performs better than the full dataset irrespective of whether we finetune only the last layer or all the layers. This result is quite surprising because it shows that, even when all layers are finetuned from a network pretrained on the full dataset, it is not possible to match the performance of a network trained on just one split.\nWhile it might be possible to recover performance with very clever adjustments of learning rates, current results suggest that training with data from unrelated classes may push the network into a local minimum from which it might be hard to find a better optima that can be obtained by training the network from scratch."

      "heading" : "7. Discussion",
      "text" : "In this work we analyzed factors that affect the quality of ImageNet pre-trained features for transfer learning. The results were quite surprising. For example, we have found that a significant reduction in the number classes or the number of images used in pre-training has only a modest effect\non transfer task performance. Indeed, we observed that the pre-trained features were surprisingly resilient to the various changes in the training data. While we do not have an explanation as to the cause of this resilience, we list some speculative possibilities that should inform further study of this topic:\n• In our experiments, we investigated only one CNN architecture – AlexNet. While ImageNet-trained AlexNet features are currently the most popular starting point for fine-tuning on transfer tasks, there exist deeper architectures such as VGG [42] and ResNet [19]. It would be interesting to see if any of our findings are consistent when applied to these deeper networks. If so, it might suggest that AlexNet capacity is less than previously though.\n• Our results might indicate that researchers have been overestimating the amount of data required for learning good general CNN features. If that is the case, it might suggest that CNN training is not as data-hungry as previously thought. It would also dash the hopes of beating ImageNet-trained features with unsupervised feature learning on a much bigger data corpus.\n• Finally, it might be that the currently popular target tasks, such as PASCAL and SUN, are all too similar to the original ImageNet task to really test the generalisation ability of the learned features. Or that generalization should be tested with much less fine-tuning (e.g. one-shot-learning) or no fine-tuning at all (e.g. nearest neighbour in the learned feature space).\nIn conclusion: the answer to the titular question “what makes ImageNet good for transfer learning?” remains elusive for the time being. But the results of the experiments performed in the present study give rise to even more tantalizing questions. We hope that this work will pique our colleagues’ curiosity and facilitate further research on this fascinating topic."

We also finetuned in this way and the results are reported in Table 1. The obtained results follow the same trend as in the main paper. The most interesting bit is that even when all layers of a network pre-trained on minimal split A+B are finetuned on a single split, it performs worse than directly training on that split.

This work provides an empirical investigation of various facets of this question: Is more pre-training data always better? How does feature quality depend on the number of training examples per class? Does adding more object classes improve performance? For the same data budget, how should the data be split into classes? Is fine-grained recognition necessary for learning good features? Given the same number of training classes, is it better to have coarse classes or fine-grained classes? Which is better: more classes or more examples per class?",
