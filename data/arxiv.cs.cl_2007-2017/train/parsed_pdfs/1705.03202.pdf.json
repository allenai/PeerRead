      "text" : "Recent years have witnessed the great thrive in artificial intelligence that has broad impacts on our daily lives. In fields like information retrieval and question answering, people are not satisfied with merely matching, but expect AI agents to have knowledge for understanding, reasoning and solving. Knowledge graphs (KGs), which provide effective wellstructured relational information between entities, are essential supporters for knowledge-based AI agents. A typical KG usually stores knowledge with triple facts like (head entity, relation, tail entity), also abridged as (h, r, t).\nThere are existing amounts of widely-utilized large-scale knowledge graphs such as Freebase [Bollacker et al., 2008], DBpedia [Auer et al., 2007] and other domain-specific KGs. However, these knowledge graphs are still far from complete\nto describe the infinite real-world facts. Conventional knowledge graph construction methods usually involve huge human supervision or expert annotation, which are extremely timeconsuming and labor-intensive. Hence, automatic mechanism and crowdsourcing take larger parts in knowledge construction, while these methods may suffer from possible noises and conflicts due to limited human supervision. For instance, the state-of-the-art relation extraction model on benchmark achieves only around 60% precision when the recall is 20% [Lin et al., 2016]. Moreover, [Heindorf et al., 2016] focuses on vandalism detection in Wikidata, which also implies the existence and problems of noises in large-scale KGs. Knowledge representation learning (KRL), which represents KGs with distributed representations, provides an effective and flexible way for using knowledge. Therefore, it is crucial to consider noises in knowledge representation learning and knowledge applications.\nWe attempt to detect possible noises and conflicts in existing knowledge graphs, while constructing noise-free knowledge representations simultaneously. Most conventional KRL methods assume that the existing KGs are absolutely correct. To address this problem, we propose a novel confidence-aware knowledge representation learning framework (CKRL) taking possible noises into consideration. More specifically, the CKRL model follows the translationbased framework proposed by [Bordes et al., 2013], and learns knowledge representations with triple confidences. We propose three kinds of triple confidences considering both local triple and global path information. With the helps of global consistency and multi-step path reasoning, we can infer whether Shakespeare writes Hamlet. To make the triple confidence more universal and flexible, we only consider the\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n03 20\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nM ay\n2 01\n7\ninternal structural information in KGs to achieve better global consistency, which correspondingly makes noise detection much more challenging due to the limited information.\nIn experiments, we evaluate our models on three tasks including knowledge graph noise detection, knowledge graph completion and triple classification. The experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve the best performances on all tasks, which confirm the capability of CKRL in noise detection and knowledge representation learning. The main contributions of this work are concluded as follows: • We propose a novel confidence-aware KRL framework\nfor knowledge graph noise detection and knowledge representation learning simultaneously, which only uses internal structural information in KGs. • We evaluate our models on different noisy knowledge\ngraphs extended from benchmark and achieve promising performances on all tasks."

      "text" : "It seems to be inevitable that noises do exist and can strongly affect knowledge acquisition [Manago and Kodratoff, 1987], so that noise detection is essential in knowledge construction and knowledge application. Most knowledge graph noise detections happen when constructing knowledge graphs. For instance, YAGO2 extracts knowledge from Wikipedia with human supervision that human judges are presented with selected facts for which they have to assess the correctness [Hoffart et al., 2013]. Wikidata also relies on a crowdsourced human curation software in which contributors can reject or approve a statement [Pellissier Tanon et al., 2016]. DBpedia creates its mappings to Wikipedia infoboxes via a world-wide crowd-sourcing effort [Lehmann et al., 2015]. These noise detections in large-scale KGs are usually involved with huge human efforts, which are extremely laborintensive and time-consuming.\nAs for automatical KG noise detection, a novel task named Wikidata vandalism, which aims to combat with deliberate destructions in knowledge graphs, has attracted wide attention [Heindorf et al., 2015]. However, most existing methods on this task mainly concentrate on feature selection from contents, users, items and revisions [Heindorf et al., 2016], and thus are constrained with the completeness of external information. There are also some efforts working on judging importance on graphs for nodes [Gyöngyi et al., 2004] or for edges [De Meo et al., 2012], but few works concentrating on the confidence of each triple. In this paper, we propose triple confidence, which mainly focuses on the internal structural information of KGs in knowledge graph noise detection and knowledge representation learning."

      "text" : "Recent years many efforts concentrate on learning distributed representations for knowledge graphs, among which the translation-based methods are both straightforward and effective with the state-of-the-art performances. TransE [Bordes et al., 2013] projects both entities and relations into a continuous low-dimensional vector space, interpreting relations\nas translating operations between head and tail entities. The translation assumption in TransE implies the equation that h+ r ' t. The energy function is defined as follows:\nE(h, r, t) = ||h+ r− t||. (1)\nTransE can well balance the effectiveness and efficiency compared to traditional methods, while the over-simplified translation assumption constrains the performance when dealing with complicated relations. Some enhanced translation-based methods attempt to solve this problem with translations on relation-specific hyperplanes [Wang et al., 2014], relationspecific entity projection [Lin et al., 2015b] and type-specific entity projection [Xie et al., 2016]. Moreover, the translation assumption only focuses on the local information in triples, which may fail to make full use of global graph information in KGs. [Lin et al., 2015a] extends TransE by encoding multistep relation path information into knowledge representation learning. However, most conventional KRL methods assume that all triples in KG share the same confidence, which is inappropriate especially for those KGs constructed automatically with less human supervision. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first embedding method to consider confidence for existing KGs in KRL. In this paper, we follow TransE to learn knowledge representations, and it is not difficult for other enhanced translation-based methods to utilize our confidence-aware KRL framework."

Given a triple fact (h, r, t), we consider the head and tail entities h, t ∈ E and the relation r ∈ R, where E and R stand for the sets of entities and relations. T represents the overall training triple facts including possible conflicts and noises.\nTo detect possible noises in knowledge graphs and learn better knowledge representations, we introduce a novel concept triple confidence for each triple fact. Triple confidence describes the likelihood of a triple to be correct, which could be measured with the favor of both internal structural information and external heterogeneous information."

Following the translation-based framework, we design our confidence-aware KRL energy function as follows:\nE(T ) = ∑\n(h,r,t)∈T\nE(h, r, t) · C(h, r, t). (2)\nThe confidence-aware energy function can be divided into two parts: E(h, r, t) = ||h + r − t|| stands for the dissimilarity between head, relation and tail, which is the same as that of TransE. A lower dissimilarity score indicates its corresponding triple could better fit the translation assumption. While differing from conventional methods, we also introduce the triple confidence C(h, r, t) as the second part of our energy function. A higher triple confidence implies that the relational knowledge in this triple is more credible.\nTriple confidence can be calculated both during and after knowledge graph construction, and from various aspects including internal information such as KG structures and external information such as textual evidence. To make our triple confidence more universal and practical, we only consider the internal structural information after KG construction in our model, and propose three kinds of triple confidences in the following sections. In training, we measure the dissimilarity as well as confidence for each triple simultaneously, and thus could get better knowledge representations."

      "text" : "We introduce the detailed training objective of our model in this section. Following TransE [Bordes et al., 2013], we formalize a margin-based score function with negative sampling as objective for training. This pair-wise score function attempts to make the scores of positive triples to be higher than those of negative triples. We have:\nL = ∑\n(h,r,t)∈T ∑ (h′,r′,t′)∈T ′ max(0, γ + E(h, r, t)\n−E(h′, r′, t′)) · C(h, r, t), (3)\nwhere E(h, r, t) is the dissimilarity score of positive triple and E(h′, r′, t′) is that of negative triple. γ > 0 is the hyperparameter of margin, and T ′ represents the negative triple set. Here the triple confidence C(h, r, t) instructs our model to pay more attention on those more convincing facts.\nFor pair-wise training, since there are no explicit negative triples in knowledge graphs, we sample negative triples complying with the following rules:\nT ′ ={(h′, r, t)|h′ ∈ E} ∪ {(h, r, t′)|t′ ∈ E} ∪ {(h, r′, t)|r′ ∈ R}, (h, r, t) ∈ T.\n(4)\nIt means that one entity or relation in a positive triple is randomly replaced by another entity or relation in the overall set. Note that differing from TransE, we also add relation replacements for better performances in relation prediction. We also confirm that the generated negative triples after replacement are not in T to make sure they are truly negative."

      "heading" : "3.3 Local Triple Confidence",
      "text" : "We first come up with the local triple confidence (LT) which only focuses on the inside of a triple. Since our CKRL framework follows the translation assumption that h + r ' t, it is straightforward to directly utilize the dissimilarity function to judge triple confidences. Moreover, the promising results of conventional translation-based methods on triple classification also confirm that positive triples should comply with the translation rule well.\nWe assume that the more a triple fits the translation rule, the more convincing this triple should be considered. To measure the local triple confidence during training, we first judge the current conformity of each triple with translation assumption. Inspired by the margin-based training strategy, we directly use the same pair-wise function to calculate the triple quality Q(h, r, t) as follows:\nQ(h, r, t) = −(γ + E(h, r, t)− E(h′, r′, t′)). (5)\nA higher score of triple quality usually indicates a better triple under the translation assumption. In training, we first initialize local triple confidence as 1. Due to the evolutionary entity and relation embeddings during training, LT should change according to its dynamic triple quality. Specifically, the local triple confidence for (h, r, t) changes as follows:\nLT (h, r, t) = { αLT (h, r, t), Q(h, r, t) 6 0. LT (h, r, t) + β, Q(h, r, t) > 0.\n(6)\nQ(h, r, t) 6 0 implies the current triple doesn’t comply with the translation rule, and thus the corresponding local triple confidence should decrease. On the contrary, Q(h, r, t) > 0 encourages the triple to have a larger local triple confidence. Here, α ∈ (0, 1) and β > 0 are hyper-parameters that control the ascend or descend pace of local triple confidence, with the assurance that LT (h, r, t) ∈ (0, 1]. Note that the local triple confidence will decrease at a geometric rate while increase with a constant addition. It is because that we urge to punish the violations of translation rule, for those triples are more likely to be noises, and thus should have smaller confidences."

Relation paths can give rich global information as supporting evidences for triples. For instance, given the relation path (h, born in city, e) and (e, in nation, t), we can infer with high confidence that (h, born in nation, t). Therefore, we propose the global path confidence to take multi-step relation paths into consideration.\nWe assume that a triple will be considered more credible if it has more reliable paths that are semantically close to the corresponding relation. In the following sub-sections, we first introduce how to quantify the relation path reliability given a triple, and then propose two strategies using co-occurrence information and learned knowledge representations to measure the semantic similarity between path and relation."

Specifically, we follow the path-constraint resource allocation (PCRA) [Lin et al., 2015a] to measure the relation path reliability. The key idea of PCRA is inspired by resource allocation [Zhou et al., 2007], which supposes there are certain resources associated with head entity h, and will flow throughout the whole knowledge graph via all relation paths. The resource amount that eventually flows to the tail entity t via a certain path p will be considered as the relation path reliability of p given the entity pair (h, t).\nFormally, given a path p = (r1, · · · , rl) and entity pair (h, t), the resource in h will flow to t through l steps. Since there are probably multiple tails given head and relation, the path is represented asE0\nr1−→ · · · rl−→ El, whereEi represents the entity set at the i-th step, E0 = h and t ∈ El. For entity e ∈ Ei, the resource Rp(e) will be calculated as follows:\nRp(e) = ∑\ne′∈Ei−1(·,e)\nRp(e ′)\n|Ei(e′, ·)| , (7)\nin whichEi−1(·, e) represents the direct predecessors of e via ri, and Ei(e′, ·) represents the direct successors of e′ via ri. All entities will be initialized with the same resource amount, and finally after l steps from h to t, the resource amountRp(t) is regarded as the relation path reliability R(h, p, t) of p with the given entity pair (h, t)."

Formally, given a triple (h, r, t) and its path set S(h,t) containing all paths between h and t, the quality of the i-th relation-path pair (r, pi) is written as follows:\nQPP (r, pi) = + (1− ) P (r, pi)\nP (pi) , (8)\nwhere P (r, pi) represents the prior probability of r and pi cooccurrence, and P (pi) represents the prior probability of pi in KG. is a hyper-parameter for smoothing. Therefore, the prior path confidence (PP) is designed as follows:\nPP (h, r, t) = ∑\npi∈S(h,t)\nQPP (r, pi) ·R(h, pi, t). (9)\nIt indicates that the prior path confidence of (h, r, t) depends on both relation-path similarities of all paths in S(h,t) and their corresponding relation path reliabilities.

To address this problem, we propose the adaptive path confidence (AP) that could flexibly learn relation-path qualities according to their learned embeddings. Following the translation assumption, given r and pi = {ri1, · · · , rik}, we define a new relation-path quality function of AP as follows:\nQAP (r, pi) = ||r− pi|| = ||r− (ri1 + · · ·+ rik)||. (10)\nSince we assume that the relation embedding should be similar as the path embedding, a lowerQAP (r, pi) implies a more convincing relation-path pair. The adaptive path confidence is then written as follows:\nAP (h, r, t) = σ( ∑\npi∈S(h,t)\nR(h, pi, t) QAP (r, pi) ), (11)\nin which σ(·) stands for the sigmoid function. Adaptive path confidence can describe triple confidences dynamically with evolutionary relation embeddings during training, making our triple confidences more flexible and precise.\nThe overall triple confidence combines with all three kinds of confidences stated above. We have:\nC(h, r, t) = λ1 · LT (h, r, t) + λ2 · PP (h, r, t) + λ3 ·AP (h, r, t),\n(12)\nwhere λ1, λ2, λ3 are hyper-parameters."

In training, all entity and relation embeddings could be either initialized randomly or pre-trained with TransE, with the local triple confidence for all triples initialized as 1. For those entity pairs that don’t have paths, we directly set their path-based confidences as 0.\nPath selection is essential in our model that will have significant impacts on the performances. Since the number of all paths grows exponentially with the increase of maximum path length, it is impractical to enumerate all paths in KG. Moreover, the path-based inference will be much weaker when the logical chain goes too far. Considering both effectiveness and efficiency, we limit the maximum length of paths to at most 2-steps. Since relations are directed edges, we also consider those reverse relations when we detect relation paths."

However, there are no explicit labelled noises or conflicts in FB15K. Therefore, we generate new datasets with different probabilities of noises based on FB15K to simulate the real-world knowledge graphs constructed automatically with less human annotation.\nInspired by the preprocessing in the evaluation task named triple classification, we construct negative triples following the same setting in [Socher et al., 2013]. Specifically, given a positive triple (h, r, t) in KG, we randomly switch one of head or tail entities to form a negative triple (h′, r, t) or (h, r, t′). The entity replacement is constrained that new entities should have appeared in the same position with relation in dataset, which means h′ should have appeared at the head position of r in positive triples (e.g. the head of relation write should be a writer). This constraint focuses on generating harder and more confusing cases, for those negative triples with mistype entities could be easily detected. We can directly utilize entity type information in Freebase or follow the local closed-world assumption [Krompaß et al., 2015] to collect entity constraint information. Following this protocol, we construct 3 noisy KGs based on FB15K with noises to be 10%, 20% and 40% of positive triples, and then discard a small number of negative triples that violate type constraints. These noisy datasets share the same entities, relations, validation and test sets with FB15K, and all generated negative triples are fused into original training set.

However, there may exist amounts of noises and conflicts in KGs, especially in those constructed automatically with less human supervision. To address this problem, we propose a novel confidence-aware knowledge representation learning framework (CKRL), which detects possible noises in KGs while learning knowledge representations with confidence simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce the triple confidence to conventional translation-based methods for knowledge representation learning. To make triple confidence more flexible and universal, we only utilize the internal structural information in KGs, and propose three kinds of triple confidences considering both local triple and global path information. We evaluate our models on knowledge graph noise detection, knowledge graph completion and triple classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our confidence-aware models achieve significant and consistent improvements on all tasks, which confirms the capability of our CKRL model in both noise detection and knowledge representation learning.",
