      "text" : "Finding words and phrases that discriminate categories of text is a common application of statistical NLP. For example, finding words that are most characteristic of a political party in congressional speeches can help political scientists identify means of partisan framing (Monroe et al., 2008; Grimmer, 2010), while identifying differences in word usage between male and female characters in films can highlight narrative archetypes (Schofield and Mehr, 2016). Language use in social media can inform understanding of personality types (Schwartz et al., 2013), and provides insights into customers’ evaluations of restaurants (Jurafsky et al., 2014).\nA wide range of visualizations have been used to highlight discriminating words– simple ranked lists of words, word clouds, word bubbles, and word-based scatter plots. These techniques have a number of limitations. For example, the difficulty\nin comparing the relative frequencies of two terms in a word cloud, or in legibly displaying term labels in scatterplots. Scattertext1 is an interactive, scalable tool which overcomes many of these limitations. It is built around a scatterplot which displays a high number of words and phrases used in a corpus. Points representing terms are positioned to allow a high number of unobstructed labels and to indicate category association. The coordinates of a point indicate how frequently the word is used in each category.\nFigure 1 shows an example of a Scattertext plot comparing Republican and Democratic political speeches. The higher up a point is on the y-axis, the more it was used by Democrats, and similarly, the further right on the x-axis a point appears, the more its corresponding word was used by Republicans. Highly associated terms fall closer to the upper left and lower right-hand corners of the chart, while stop words fall in the far upper right-hand corner. Words occurring infrequently in both classes fall closer to the lower left-hand corner. When used interactively, mousing-over a point shows statistics about a term’s relative use in the two contrasting categories, and clicking on a term shows excerpts from convention speeches used.\nThe point placement, intelligent word-labeling, and auxiliary term-lists ensure a low-whitespace, legible plot. These are issues which have plagued other scatterplot visualizations showing discriminative language. §2 discusses different views of term-category association that make up the basis of visualizations. In §3, the objectives, strengths, and weaknesses of existing visualization techniques. §4 presents the technical details behind Scattertext. §5 discusses how Scattertext can be used to iden-\n1github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n00 56\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nM ar\n2 01\n7\nInfrequent Average Frequent\nRepublican Frequency\nIn fre\nqu en\nt Av\ner ag\ne Fr\neq ue\nnt\nD em\noc ra\ntic F\nre qu\nen cy Top Democratic\nauto insurance companies auto industry pell last week pell grants affordable grants platform reduce access fair clean coverage\nTop Republican unemployment liberty olympics reagan ann founding constitution church free enterprise federal government enterprise sons boy greatness Characteristic obama romney barack mitt obamacare biden romneys hardworking bain grandkids billionaires millionaires ledbetter buenas pell noches bless dreamers congresswoman bipartisan wealthiest risked trillion republicans recession insurmountable gentlemen electing pelosi understands obama romney barack millionaires pell wealthiest trillion gentlemen fought president americans medicare prosper reagan grandparents blaming founding seniors unemployment wealthy veterans blessed rhetoric fathers restore hector olympics stake cares\nstimulus\nbacks\nfighting\ncuts\nfights\nliberty\nbridges\ninspire\nfreedom\nblame\nroosevelt\nwe\nballot\nfailing\nmichelle\ngreatest\ndeeply\nhopes\nheal\ncharlotteaffordable\ncaring\nsuccess\nbelief\nvote\nloyal\nwalks\nmayor\nbetter\nvoting\nworkers\ndetroit\ncents\nbroke\nlaid ran\nopponent\nclass\nmyth\nfair\ngrants\ndrill\nkept\npushed\nshared\njill refuse\npay\nspoke\nworry\nsolve\nloved\nprinciples\nnotion\nmove\nwon\nled\nstory\nrid\nadministration\nfiscal\ntried\npray\nthinks\ndoors\nisrael\nbreaks\ni\nliberal\nminds\niraq\neight\nmate\nthreats\njustice\nshut\nregulations\nbanks\nsupreme\ntells\nlucky\nfix forever\nlie\ntrust\naside\ngm\nyounger\nrise\nera\nwisdom\nkate\nflying\nfacts\nfear\nbegin\nque\nwalk\nhey\nauto\nescape\nhole\nhit\nmean\nhelps\nlay\ncapital\npass\nfelt\ncarefully\nlater\nplayed\ngas\nact\nownerscast\ncancer\nnations\ndefense\nsafe\ninsurance\nsimple\nfail\nbus\ntea\nfall\nedge\nwall\nloans\nchurch rich\nneither\nbeyond math con\nfill\nskills\nfive train\nfirm\nearly\nfuel\nfront\nrace\nleading\nbit\njoin street\nsent district\nre\noh hours\nfeet\naccess\nfine\ntest\nlos\npoint\ntop\nloss\nbaby\nfree\n5\nre elect\n30\n20 1\n29\n4\n42\nroll back\nok.\n2\n8\nturned around\n3 bain capital\n16\ninsurance companies\nDemocratic document count: 123; word count: 76,864 Republican document count: 66; word count: 58,138\nSearch for term   Type a word or two…  \nDownload SVG Figure 1: Scattertext visualization of words and phrases used in the 2012 Political Conventions. 2,202 points are colored r d or blue based on the association of their corresponding terms with Democrats or Republicans, 215 of which were labeled.

      "heading" : "2 On text visualization",
      "text" : "The simplest visualization, a list of words ranked by their scores, is easy to produce, interpret and is thus very common in the literature. There are numerous ways of producing word scores for ranking which are thoroughly covered in previous work. The reader is directed to Monroe et al. (2008) (subsequently referred to as MCQ) for an overview of model-based term scoring algorithms. Also of interest, Bitvai and Cohn (2015) present a method for finding sparse words and phrase scores from a trained ANN (with bag-of-words features) and its training data.\nRegardless of how complex the calculation, word scores capture a number of different measures of word-association, which can be interesting when viewed independently instead of as part of a unitary score. These loosely defined measures include: Precision A word’s discriminative power regardless of its frequency. A term that appears once in the categorized corpus will have perfect precision. This (and subsequent metrics) presuppose a balanced class distribution. Words close to the x and\ny-axis in Scattertext have high precision.\nRecall The frequency a word appears in a particular class, or P (word|class). The variance of precision tends to decrease as recall increases. Extremely high recall words tend to be stop-words. High recall words occur close to the top and right sides of Scattertext plots.\nNon-redundancy The level of a word’s discriminative power given other words that co-occur with it. If a word wa always co-occurs with wb and word wb has a higher precision and recall, wa would have a high level of redundancy. Measuring redundancy is non-trivial, and has traditionally been approached through penalized logistic regression (Joshi et al., 2010), as well as through other feature selection techniques. In configurations of Scattertext such as the one discussed at the end of §4, terms can be colored based on their regression coefficients that indicate nonredundancy.\nCharacteristicness How much more does a word occur in than the categories examined than in background in-domain text? For example, if comparing positive and negative reviews of a single movie, a logical background corpus may be reviews of other movies. Highly associated terms\ntend to be characteristic because they frequently appear in one category and not the other. Some visualizations explicitly highlight these, ex. (Coppersmith and Kelly, 2014)."

      "heading" : "3 Past work and design motivation",
      "text" : "Text visualizations manipulate the position and appearance of words or points representing them to indicate their relative scores in these measures. For example, in Schwartz et al. (2013), two word clouds are given, one per each category of text being compared. Words (and selected ngrams) are sized by their linear regression coefficients (a composite metric of precision, recall, and redundancy) and colored by frequency. Only words occurring in geq1% of documents and having Bonferroni-corrected coefficient p-values of <0.001 were shown. Given that these words are highly correlated to their class of interest, the frequency of use is likely a good proxy for recall.\nCoppersmith and Kelly (2014) also describe a word-cloud based visualization for discriminating terms, but intend it for categories which are both small subsets of a much larger corpus. They include a third, middle cloud for terms that appear characteristic.\nWord clouds can be difficult to interpret. It is difficult to compare the sizes of two nonhorizontally adjacent words, as well as the relative color intensities of any two words. By virtue of being larger, longer words can unintentionally appear more important. Sizing of words can be a source of confusion when used to represent precision, since a larger word may naturally be seen as more frequent.\nBostock et al. (2012)2 employed an interesting, interactive word-bubble visualization for exploring different word usage among Republicans and Democrats in the 2012 American Political Conventions. A bubble represents each term, and its size increases with its frequency of use. Its precision is represented by its coloring– each bubble is colored blue and red, with the blue portion proportionally colored to a term’s relative use by Democrats. Terms were manually chosen, and arranged along the x-axis based on their discriminative power. When clicked, sentences from speeches containing the word used are listed below the visualization. This bubble approach to word clouds inspired Nelson et al. (2015). 2nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/06/us/politics/conventionword-counts.html\nThe dataset used in Bostock et al. (2012) is used to demonstrate the capabilities of Scattertext in each of these figures.

MCQ’s is at the top. Ti ytext (Silge a Robinson, 2016) is below.\nMCQ present a visualization to illustrate the use of their proposed word score, log-odds-ratio with an informative Dirichlet prior (top of Figure 2). This visualization plots word-representing points along two axes. The axes are log10 recall vs. the difference in word scores z-scores. Points with a zscore difference below 1.96 are grayed-out, while the top and bottom 20 are labeled, both by each point and on the right-hand side. The side-labeling is necessary because labels are permitted to overlap, hindering their on-plot readability. The sizes of points and labels are increased proportionally to the word score. This word score encompasses precision, recall, and characteristicness since it penalizes scores of terms used more frequently in the background corpus.\nMCQ used this type of plot to illustrate the different effects of various scoring techniques intro-\nduced in the paper. However, the small number of points which are possible to label limit its utility for in-depth corpus analysis.\nSchofield and Mehr (2016) use essentially the same visualization, but plot over 100 corresponding n-grams next to an unlabeled frequency/zscore plot. While this is appropriate for publication, displaying associated terms and the shape of the score distribution, it is impossible to align all but the highest scoring points to their labels.\nThe tidytext R-package (Silge and Robinson, 2016) documentation includes a non-interactive ggplot2-based scatter plot that is very similar to Scattertext. The x and y-axes both, like in Scattertext, correspond to word frequencies in the two contrasting categories, with jitter added.3 In the example in Figure 2 (bottom), the contrasting categories are tweets from two different accounts. The red diagonal line separates words based on their odds-ratio. Importantly, compared to MCQ, less of this chart’s area is occupied by whitespace.\nWhile tidytext’s labels do not overlap each other (in contrast to MCQ) they do overlap points. The points’ semi-transparency makes labels in lessdense areas legible, the dense interior of the chart is nearly illegible, with both points and labels obscured.\n's\n@b0rk\n@benmarwick\n@coursera\n@gshotwell\nblast auto @sf99\n@seanhacks probability\ncc @daattali\n@nssdeviations @aalear\n@gaborcsardi gganimat\n@simplystats android @fody\n@nick_craver\n@onlybluefeet\n@juliasilge\n@bigkage\naccepted\nclinton's\n@hairboat\ncreated\narticles @flowingdata distribution compare simulation network advantage\nlog\nstats\nsql users\nbase\noverflow\nbroom\niffy\npit\nfacet\neffect\nyork\nfalse\ntidying df\nbaseball\nknitr beta\ndatas t\nstack\naired\n8th\ncmd\n@alexwhan\nad chapter\ncomparing adding gonna\nregression talks\nbtw\n@kwbroman\nvi\n2x\neasily\nbeat\nbc\n@jc4p\n@jasonpunyon\nchia\nfish\naccess\nform\napi\n@timelyportfolio\ntraffic\nchunk\nhurt\nclosed\nuser\nfuture\n@kara_woo\narms\nbar\nfill\nmelt\nsentiment\nframe\nscale matter\ntitle\ntweets\napril\navoid\nha\nsave\nexamples\npackages article\ncup\nfear\ncount\nanswer\nbiggest\nlines\ntech\nadvice aw\nchance\nresults\nposts\ngithub\nsell\nsan\nfail\nran\nhold\n@noamross\ndplyr\n@jhollist\nlink\nstatistics\ntidy\njoin\nadd\ndry\nhat\nvoice\nshiny\ntidytext\nggplot2\nart\nmath\nbug\nfunction\neasier\noptions line\nbased\nanalysis\nnom\nguy\ndue\num\nyep\nrest\npublic\neasy\nloved\nideas\nla\ntalking\nemail\ntable\nwrite\ncode\njam\nfan\nlearning\nnames\nsocial\nfit\n@hspter\nclose\nlist\ntweet\n3rd\nrealized\nquestion\ncooking\nage\nstore\nfine\nword\ncall\nliterally\nlive\nhope\nlibrary\nwrong\nclass\n@hadleywickham\ndog\nplay\nstop\ntalk\nhalf cool\ntaking\nscience\ntiny\nmeet\nnormal\ntrip\nperson\nwatch\nawesome\n@quominus\nwearing\nred wait\nblog\nlate\ncoming\npackage\nbuy\nsad\nhours\nwear\nfound\nstarted\nstart\nago\nsleep\nfavorite\nidea\nhot\ntomorrow\nthinking bad makes\ntotally\nyeah\nhard\nread\npost\nlol\nstuff\nreal\ndata\nsick\namazing\n#rstats\nlife\nnice\nkids\n@drob\nhappy\nhome\nbirthday\ndinner\ntonight\nnight\nweek\nlot\nschool\npretty feel\npeople\nhouse\nbaby\nday\ntime\n0.01%\n0.10%\n1.00%\n0.01% 1.00% Julia\nD av id\nFigure 3: A small cropping from an un-jittered version a the bottom of Figure 2.

      "text" : "Scattertext builds on tinytext and Rudder (2014). It plots a set of unigrams and bigrams (we will refer to these as “terms”) found in a corpus of docu-\n3This type of visualization may have first been introduced in Rudder (2014).\nments assigned to one of two categories on a twodimensional scatterplot.\nIn the following notation, user-supplied parameters are in bold typeface.\nConsider a corpus of documents C with disjoint subsets A and B s.t. A ∪B ≡ C. Let φT (t, C) be the number of times term t occurs in C, φT (t, A) be the the number of times t occurs in A. Let φD(t, . . .) refer to the number of documents containing t. Let tij be the jth word in term ti. In practice, j ∈ {1, 2}. The parameter φ may be φT or φD.4 Other feature representations (ex., tf.idf) may be used for φ.\nPr[ti] = φ(ti, C)∑\nt∈C∧|t|≡|ti|φ(t, C) . (1)\nThe construction of the set of terms included in the visualization V is a two-step process. Terms must occur at least m times, and if bigrams, appear to be phrases. In order to keep the approach language neutral, we follow Schartz et al. (2013), and use a pointwise mutual information score to filter out bigrams that do not occur far more frequently than would be expected. Let\nPMI(ti) = log Pr[ti]∏\ntij∈tiPr[Tij ] . (2)\nThe minimum PMI accepted is p. Now, we can define V as\n{t|φ(t, C) ≥m∧(|t| ≡ 1∨PMI(t) > p)} (3)\nLet a term t’s coordinates on the scatterplot be (xAt , x B t ), where A and B are the two document categories. Although xKt is proportional to φ(t,K), ma y ter s will have identical φ(t,K) values. To break ties the word that appears last alphabetically will have a larg r xKt .\nWe define rKt s.t. t ∈ V andK ∈ {A,B} as the ranks of φ(t,K), sorted in ascending order, where ties are broken by terms’ alphabetical order. This allows us to define\nxKt = rKt\nargmax rK (4)\nThis limits x values to [0, 1], ensuring both axes are scaled identically. This keeps the chart from becoming lopsided toward the corpus that had a larger number of terms. 4φD is useful when documents contain unique, characteristic, highly frequent terms. For example, names of movies can have high φT when finding differences in positive and negative film reviews. The may lead to them receiving higher scores than sentiment terms.\nThe charts in Figures 1, 4, and 5, were made with parametersm=5, p=8, and φ=φT .\nBreaking ties alphabetically is a simple but important alternative to jitter. While jitter (i.e., randomly perturbing xAt and x B t ) breaks up the stacked points shown in Figure 3, it eliminates empty space to legibly label points. Jitter can make it seem like identically frequent points are closer to an upper left or lower right corner. Alphabetic tie-breaking makes identical adjustments to both axes, leading to the horizontal (lower-left to upper-right) alignments of identically frequent points. This angle does not cause one point to be substantially closer to either of the category associated corners (the upper-left and lower-right).\nThese alignments provide two advantages. First, they open up point-free tracts in the center of the chart which allow for unobstructed interior labels. Second, they arrange points in a way that it is easy to hover a mouse over all of them, to indicate what term they correspond to, and be clicked to see excerpts of that term.\nIn the running example, 154 points were labeled when a jitter of 10% of each axis and no tie-breaking was applied. 210 points (a 36% lift) were labeled when no jitter was applied. 140 were labeled if no tie breaking was used.\nRudder (2014) observed terms closer to the lower-right corner were used frequently in A and infrequently in B, indicating they have both high recall and precision wrt category A. Symmetrically, the same relationship exists for B and the upper-right corner. We can formalize this score between a point’s coordinates and it’s respective corner. This intuition is represented by a score function sK(t) (K ∈ {A,B} and t ∈ V ) where\nsK(t) = { ‖〈1− xAt , xBt 〉‖ if K = A, ‖〈xAt , 1− xBt 〉‖ if K = B . (5)\nOther term scoring methods (e.g., regression weights or a weighted log-odd-ratio with a prior) may be used in place of Formula 5.\nMaximal non-overlapping labeling of scatterplots is NP-hard (Been et al., 2007). Scattertex’s heuristic is labeling points if space is available in one of 12 places around a point. This is performed iteratively, beginning with points having the highest score (regardless of category) and proceeding downward in score. An optimized data structure automatically constructed using Cozy (Loncaric\net al., 2016) holds the locations of drawn points and labels.\nThe top scoring terms in classes B and A (Democrats and Republicans in Figure 1) are listed to the right of the chart. Hovering over points and terms highlights the point and displays frequency statistics.\nPoint colors are determined by their scores on s. Those corresponding to terms with a high sB colored in progressively darker shades of blue, while those with a higher sA are colored in progressively darker shades of red. When both scores are about equal, the point colors become more yellow, which creates a visual divide between the two classes. The colors are provided by D3’s “RdYlBu” diverging color scheme from Colorbrewer5 via d36.\nOther point colors (and scorings) can be used. For example, Figure 4 shows coefficients of an `1 penalized log. reg. classifier on V features. Scattertext, in this example, is set to color 0-scoring coefficients light gray. Terms’ univariate predictive power are still evident by their chart position.

P-values are determined using MCQ’s difference in the weighted log-odds-ratio with an uninformative Dirichlet prior. This is the only model-based method discussed in Monroe et al. that does not rely on a large, in-domain background corpus. Since we are scoring bigrams in addition to the unigrams scored by MCQ, the size of the corpus would have to be larger to have high enough bigram counts for proper penalization.\nThis function relies the Dirichlet distribution’s parameter α, a real, positive vector of size |V |. Following MCQ, αt = 0.01. Formulas 16, 18 and 22 are used to compute z-scores, which are then converted to p-values using the Normal CDF of ζ̂A−Bw , letting y (K) t = φ(t,K) st K ∈ {A,B} and t ∈ V . As seen in Figure 5, the top Republican word related to “jobs” is “job creators”, while “workers” is the top Democratic term.\n9spacy.io"
