      "text" : "of a simplified Biped gait. This approach combines a classical dynamic modeling with an inverse kinematics’ solver based on particle swarm optimization, PSO. First, an inverted pendulum, IP, is used to obtain a simplified dynamic model of the robot and to compute the target position of a key point in biped locomotion, the Centre Of Mass, COM. The proposed algorithm, called IK-PSO, Inverse Kinematics PSO, returns and inverse kinematics solution corresponding to that COM respecting the joints constraints. In This paper the inertia weight PSO variant is used to generate a possible solution according to the stability based fitness function and a set of joints motions constraints. The method is applied with success to a leg motion generation. Since based on a precalculated COM, that satisfied the biped stability, the proposal allowed also to plan a walk with application on a small size biped robot.\nGeneral Terms Robotics, Robotic Modeling, Computational Intelligence\nKeywords Biped robotics, Gait generation, Particle Swarm Optimization, Inverse kinematics.

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "A legged system is a robotic system that has a specific mission, ensuring locomotion. Such a system could be analyzed from its kinematics aspects and also its dynamics aspects. The kinematics aspects are centered on the joints motions, constraints and limits. Forward kinematics is the mathematical relationship between the end segments of an articulated system and its joints motions. In inverse kinematics, the problem consists of computing the needed joints motion s leading a known end segment position [1].\nBiped robots are specific robotic system that combines open and close kinematics chains; in biped locomotion two key phases are important, the double support phase and the single support phase also known as stance phase and swing phase. In double support both legs are in contact with the flow the obtained articulated body tend to move its COM, Centre of mass, position to prepare the next step, in single support or swing phase a leg is used as a support while the opposite one swings forwards, this motion causes the displacement of the COM in the same direction of the swing, when the swing leg is once again in contact with the floor the COM is placed on its surface and that gives a forward step.\nThe forward kinematics model of a robot could be simply obtained using the classical Denavit-Hartenberg method [2], while the inverse kinematics problem is little bit more complex. A classical approach to inverse kinematics consist in in writing the inverse mathematical formulation of the forward model, This approach is know to be time and memory consuming. The classical inverse modeling process based on\ngeometric [3], algebraic or iterative methods is limited if the system structure is complex [4].\nMany alternative methods are proposed to solve inverse kinematics problem. To tackle the inverse kinematics modeling an ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system) methodology were introduced in [5]. Basically, ANFIS methods used a set of data representing the end points of an articulated system and the joints motions needed to produce them to generate neuro-fuzzy network able to solve inverse kinematics. Genetic and evolutionary algorithms were also investigated as possible solutions to complex inverse kinematics problems [6] [7], combination of genetic and Particle swarm optimization was also investigated [8].\nIn this work the constrain weight particle swarm algorithm is investigated to solve inverse kinematics problem with a specific focus on biped robotics, including leg motion and also walking gaits.\nThe paper is organized as follows; section2 introduced the robotic modeling with both aspects kinematics and dynamics before detailing given a brief on particle swarm optimization. Section 3, is dedicated to IK-PSO, inverse kinematics PSO with application to swing leg motion generation and walking gaits of a biped robot. Experiments and results are detailed in section 4. The paper ends by a discussion the results and further works, in section5."

      "text" : "A simplified biped robot could be observed as an articulated system with a specific configuration allowing it to be an open loop kinematics system or a closed loop kinematics one. A simplified 2D representation on the sagittal frame is showed in figure 1 (a); its equivalent inverted pendulum appears in figure1 (b).\nFor a planar robot, the kinematics modeling process consists in finding a solution to the end segments of each leg, (hip, knee and ankle) according to joints motions. Joints are supposed to produce rotations the hip joint motion is responsible of the knee position, the knee joints is in charge with the ankle end position and finally the ankle joint is responsible of the foot position.\nFor kinematic-modeling needs a set of frames are used, a key frame is the reference frame, for biped robots this frame is used to compute a specific point called, COM, centre of mass. The COM is a virtual point representing the centre of gravity of the body according to the relative position of joints and masses see figure 1 (b). A simplified dynamic model of a biped robot could be obtained using the inverted pendulum made by the COM and a virtual support leg that joined the COM to the ground. The IP model allowed an estimation of the needed torque to support the overall robot structure, see paragraph 2.2, dynamic modeling.\nAn important issue in biped robotics is the stability of the structure while walking [9]. Any motion has a direct impact on the stability and could lead to a fall down. Handling the kinematics of such a system should include both, the motion generation it self and the impact of the motion on the structure stability. The COM helps also a simple control of the stability; a biped is stable since its COM projection on the floor remains within the sustention polygon, with is the surface of foot prints wit respect to the walking cycle [10]."

      "heading" : "2.3 Particle swam optimization",
      "text" : "Particle swarm optimization, PSO, was first investigated by Eberhart and Kennedy as a computational approach to solve complex problems simply by mimic the social comportment of animals. In a group each individual is represented by a particle with a position and a target mission [12].\nIn PSO, a problem is addressed threw a search space and a fitness function; a set of particles are randomly spread on the search space, and asked to find a solution, each particle is a potential solution of the problem, while the best one is the one fitting the fitness function. The swarm is generally asked to iterate until the fitness function is satisfied or to the end of a fixed iteration number. For each iteration the particles positions on the search space are updated according to a couple of equations see equation (7) and (8). Those equations are also used to formalize the interactions that could occurs within the group, this mimic the bird folks or the fish banks global positioning in witch the group has a comment objective, individual comportments still allowed within the group global policy and has a direct impact on it. The native PSO formulation appears in equations (7) and (8).\n1 21 * ()*( ) * ()*( )i lbest i Gbesti iV V c rand x x c rand x x               (7)\n1 1i i ix x V   \n   (8)\nWhere (V) stands for the velocity, (c1) and (c2) are called acceleration factors and (x) is the particle position. The velocity is a displacement of the particle, according to its best local and to the best particle of the swarm. Setting parameter\nc1 and c2 as equal will give equivalent potential weight to the local search strategy and the global search one. The local best is elected between particle neighborhoods; a neighborhood topology should be chosen before running PSO.\nA key issue in PSO is to establish a particle representation that fits the problem formulation and to define a fitness function that ends the solving process. It is also important to remind that PSO gives always a solution, even if the fitness function is not totally satisfied, the best particle is returned as a solution within the iteration number limit.\nAccording to [12], the PSO algorithm runs as follows:\n1) Initialize a population of particles\n2) For each particle evaluate the fitness function\n3) Compare fitness function to local best particle one, and if better set the particle as local best.\n4) Compare fitness to global best particle, and if better set new global best position as current particle\nposition.\n5) Update the particles positions according to equations (4) and (5).\n6) Loop to step (2) until stop criterion is met, (fitness\nfunction satisfied or maximum iteration number achieved).\nIt is also common to control and limit the velocity within a know range by fixing the maximum amount that the velocity could achieve, Vmax. Several variations were then introduced in order to optimize the native proposal. Inertia weight PSO is one of the major variants of PSO [13], it allowed to moderate the velocity using an inertia coefficient allowing to smooth or to fasten the search procedure.\nOn the other hand PSO was investigated as an optimization technique used in conjunction with other intelligent methods such as neural networks, genetic algorithms or ant systems [14]."

This approach combines a classical dynamic modeling with an inverse kinematics’ solver based on particle swarm optimization, PSO. First, an inverted pendulum, IP, is used to obtain a simplified dynamic model of the robot and to compute the target position of a key point in biped locomotion, the Centre Of Mass, COM. The proposed algorithm, called IK-PSO, Inverse Kinematics PSO, returns and inverse kinematics solution corresponding to that COM respecting the joints constraints. In This paper the inertia weight PSO variant is used to generate a possible solution according to the stability based fitness function and a set of joints motions constraints. The method is applied with success to a leg motion generation. Since based on a precalculated COM, that satisfied the biped stability, the proposal allowed also to plan a walk with application on a small size biped robot.
