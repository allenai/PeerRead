{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Investigating Recurrence and Eligibility Traces in Deep Q-Networks", "abstract": "Eligibility traces in reinforcement learning are used as a bias-variance trade-off and can often speed up training time by propagating knowledge back over time-steps in a single update. We investigate the use of eligibility traces in combination with recurrent networks in the Atari domain.  We illustrate the benefits of both recurrent nets and eligibility traces in some Atari games, and highlight also the importance of the optimization used in the training.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper investigates the use of eligibility traces with recurrent DQN agents. As in other recent work on deep RL, the forward view of Sutton and Barto is used to make eligibility traces practical to use with neural networks. Experiments on the Atari games Pong and Tennis show that traces work better than standard Q-learning.\n\nThe paper is well written and the use of traces in deep RL is indeed underexplored, but the experiments in the paper are too limited and do not answer the most interesting questions.\n\nAs pointed out in the questions, n-step returns have been shown to work better than 1-step returns both in the classical RL literature and more recently with deep networks. [1] shows that using n-step returns in the forward view with neural networks leads to big improvements on both Atari and TORCS. Their n-step Q-learning method also combines returns of different length in expectation, while traces do this explicitly. This paper does not compare traces with n-step returns and simply shows that traces used in the forward view help on two Atari games. This is not a very significant result. It would be much more interesting to see whether traces improve on what is already known to work well with neural networks.\n\nThe other claimed contribution of the paper is showing the strong effect of optimization. As with traces, I find it hard to make any conclusions from experiments on two games with fixed hyperparameter settings. This has already been demonstrated with much more thorough experiments in other papers. One could argue that these experiments show that importance of hyperparameter values and not of the optimization algorithm itself. Without tuning the optimization hyperparameters it's hard to claim anything about the relative merits of the methods.\n\n[1] \"Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning\", ICML 2016."}, {"DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "The reviewers agree that the paper is clear and well-written, but all reviewers raised significant concerns about the novelty of the work, since the proposed algorithm is a combination of well-known techniques in reinforcement learning.
