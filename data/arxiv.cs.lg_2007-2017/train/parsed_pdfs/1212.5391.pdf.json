      "text" : "HE second most common malignant (cancerous) tumor is lung cancer. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined. Early time diagnosis of the lung cancer’s pathological type could improve patients’ treatment effect. Recently, CT-scanning has emerged as one of the essential diagnostic measures of lung cancer, due to its pattern recognition, machine learning and image process technology [1]. Feature Selection is an essential part of knowledge discovery. FS is used to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the computational time of classification algorithms. FS is divided into the supervised and unsupervised categories. When class labels of the data are available we use supervised feature selection, otherwise unsupervised feature selection is appropriate. In many data mining applications, class labels are unknown, thereby indicating the significance of unsupervised feature selection [2]. In terms of feature selection methods, they fall into filter and wrapper categories. In filter model, features are evaluated based on the general characteristics of the data without relying on any mining algorithms. On the contrary, wrapper model requires one mining algorithm and uses its performance to determine the goodness of feature sets [3]. Soft set theory was first proposed by D. Molodtsov in 1999 for dealing with uncertainties [4]. Soft Set Theory has been applied to data analysis and decision support system. Soft set is trouble-free for attribute reduction in Boolean-value information system. The proposed work exploits soft set theory based operations for feature reduction and then it is compared with rough set based unsupervised algorithms. This soft set based method selects the minimal set of attributes when compared with\nRough Set. The main purpose of the proposed algorithm is to increase the efficiency of feature selection method. The rest of the paper is structured as Sections 2 to 8. Section 2 describes the related work of feature reduction and decision making using soft sets. Section 3 describes the research motivation of this work. Section 4 explains the preprocessing steps for lung image. Section 5 describes the preliminaries of soft set theory. Section 6 explains the proposed algorithm with an example. Section 7 analyses the experimental results. Finally, conclusion is given in Section 8."

      "heading" : "2 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "In [5], a filter-based feature selection method, biomarker identifier (BMI), is adopted to analyze gene expression data that might be used to discriminate between samples with and without lung cancer. Amer et al. [6] investigated computed tomographic (CT) chest images and developed a computer-aided system to discriminate different lung abnormalities. They studied texture based features, fourier-based features and wavelet-based features. Aliferis et al. [7] explores machine learning methods for the development of computer models. These computer models used gene expression data to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor, between metastatic and non-metastatic, and between histological subtypes of lung cancer. A second goal is to identify small sets of gene predictors and study their properties in terms of stability, size, and relation to lung cancer. The idea of attribute reduction and decision making using soft set theory was first proposed by Maji et al. [8]. In [8] decision selection in given attribute is based on the maximal weighted choice value and it is similar to the Pawlak rough reduction. Herawan et al. [9] introduced a new approach for an attribute reduction in multi-valued information system using soft set. AND operation was used for attribute reduction and it was shown that the reducts obtained were equivalent with Pawla’s rough reduction.

All mentioned types of filters are applied in the noisy image. The SNR value is obtained using the equation (1) and comparing the values of SNR of each image that resulted from each filter type we get the most suitable filter that could be applied on the raw CT images [6]. The original image and the noisy image are shown in Figure 2 and the resulted images from all types of the previous filters are shown in Figure 3.

      "text" : "the new Soft Set based Unsupervised Quick Reduct algorithm, the dimensionality reduction is achieved by using AND operation in soft set theory. It starts with an empty set and finds the cardinality of the indiscernibility of the universal set. For every conditional feature, the cardinality of indiscernibility is computed. The attribute which has highest cardinality value is taken as the core attribute in the reduct set. If more than one attribute has maximum cardinality value, Sig(x) is found out and that value is taken as the core attribute. In the next step, combination of other attributes with CORE(x) attribute is taken as feature subset and the feature subset with maximum cardinality of indiscernibility is taken. This process continues until the cardinality of indiscernibility of the feature subset is equal to the cardinality of the indiscernibility of the universal set.

Worked Example: Now, let us consider the given information in table 2. The conditional attributes are {a1, a2, a3, a4}. A multi-value information system as specified in table 3 is constructed.\n(F, U) = ((F, a1), (F, a2), (F, a3), (F, a4)) (F, a1) = {{Circle=1, 4, 5}, {Square=2, 8}, {Triangle=3, 6, 7}} (F, a2) = {{Large=1, 3, 5}, {Small=2, 4, 7, 8}, {Medium=6}} (F, a3) = {{Red=1, 5}, {Green=2, 7, 8}, {Blue=3, 4, 6}} (F, a4) = {{Good=1, 4}, {Bad=2, 3, 6, 7}, {Average=5, 8}}\nStep 1: Begin. ST (U) = {(F,a1)AND(F,a2)AND(F,a3)AND(F,a4)} = F (a1 x a2 x a3 x a4) ST (U) = | {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}} | = 8 ---- (2) Step 2: Calculate the cardinality value. (F, a1) = | {1, 4, 5}, {2, 8}, {3, 6, 7}| = 3 (F, a2) = 3, (F, a3) = 3, (F, a4) = 3. Find the maximum cardinality, that attribute is the core attribute in the reduct set. Step 3: In this example, the maximum cardinality value 3 occurs four times. From the Definition 4 we can calculate Significance value. The attribute which has highest Significance value is taken as core attribute CORE (A). |A| = ST (U) = {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}}\nSimilarly, we can calculate,\nCORE (A) = {a4}, If ST (U) ≠ |R| then go to next step. Step 4: Take the combination, {a1, a4}, {a2, a4}, {a3, a4}. F (a1 x a4) = | {1, 4}, {2}, {3, 6, 7}, {5}, {8}| = 5\nSimilarly, F (a2 x a4) = 7, F (a3 x a4) = 6 Select the attribute which has maximum cardinality. R = {a2, a4}. If ST (U) ≠ |R|, then go to next step. Step 5: Take the combination, {a1, a2, a4}, {a2, a3, a4}. F (a1 x a2 x a4) = 8, F (a2 x a3 x a4) = 7 Select the attribute which has highest cardinality. R = {a1, a2, a4} ST (U) == |R|. Then the reduct set is {a1, a2, a4}. Step 6: End."

    "abstractText" : "Lung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer for both men and women. Feature selection plays a vital role in cancer classification. This paper investigates the feature selection process in Computed Tomographic (CT) lung cancer images using soft set theory. We propose a new soft set based unsupervised feature selection algorithm. Nineteen features are extracted from the segmented lung images using gray level co-occurence matrix (GLCM) and gray level different matrix (GLDM). In this paper, an efficient Unsupervised Soft Set based Quick Reduct (SSUSQR) algorithm is presented. This method is used to select features from the data set and compared with existing rough set based unsupervised feature selection methods. Then KMeans and Self Organizing Map (SOM) clustering algorithms are used to cluster the data. The performance of the feature selection algorithms is evaluated based on performance of clustering techniques. The results show that the proposed method effectively removes redundant features.",
