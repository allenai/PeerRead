      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "The container storage space allocation is a critical decision in container terminals. It influences the productivity of the unloading process, either for inbound or outbound containers. It’s a complex operation since it is highly inter-related with the routing of yard crane and truck [17]. This paper focuses on optimizing the way of allocating inbound and outbound containers in storage locations, known as the storage space allocation problem (SSAP). This problem is classified as a three dimensions bin-packing problem where containers are the items and storage spaces in the port represent the used bins. It falls into the category of NP hard problems. Generally, this problem is studied considering a single container type. However, this does not stand the problem under its real-life statement as there are multiple container types that should be considered, (refrigerated, open side, empty, dry, open top and tank). This lets the problem more complicated, as various constraints appeared, related to the container type’s requirements (e.g. refrigerated containers must be allocated to the blocks equipped by the power point, on an open top container, we cannot place a container at the top, tank container must be placed on each other, etc.) Making a storage space allocation decision for different types of containers is too complicated especially for large scale instances and it is hard, even impossible, to solve it optimally. Therefore, most of the proposed solution approaches are based on metaheuristics. A metaheuristic is a computational method seeking for a good solution in a reasonable computation time without being able to guaranty optimality. Some of these approaches are based on the gradient method, which presents some limits such as the\nfact that they are often trapped in a local optimal especially for complex optimization problems having several local optimums. Due to this restriction, other metaheuristics are developed based on simulation, to solve complex problems. They imitate natural phenomena such as the genetic algorithm inspired by biological evolutionary process [8], ant colony [5], the harmony search [7], firefly algorithm [21], cuckoo search [20]. There is a large number of metaheuristics and it is difficult to find the appropriate one for a specific problem, especially in the absence of benchmarks. One way to face this dilemma is to use multiple approaches, compare them and select the one generating the best result. In this paper a Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of storage space allocation of containers with different types. To evaluate the performance of this method, we compare his results with those generated by the genetic algorithm described in [1] and the Last In First Out algorithm. Harmony search algorithm was proposed by [7]. It was successfully applied to solve various engineering optimization problems such as vehicle routing [6], reliability [23], structural optimization [15] and function optimisation [18] The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, a literature review for the container storage problem is presented. The mathematical formulation of the problem is given, in section 3. Next in section\n4, the Harmony Search algorithm is described. Section 5 is\ndevoted to the description of the Harmony search adaptation to the SSAP. Then, some experiments and results are presented and discussed, in section 6. Section 7 included a comparative study of the proposed approach with the genetic algorithm and the Last in First out (LIFO). Finally, section 8 covers our conclusion."

      "heading" : "2. LITERATURE REVIEW",
      "text" : "The container storage space allocation is the most difficult task in container terminals since inbound and outbound containers are stacked together in the same storage area. After arrival at the terminal, each container picked up by transportation equipment and affected to one of the storage blocks. When the designated ship arrived, containers are unloaded from yard block, transported to the berth and loaded onto the vessel. The chain of operations for import containers are performed in the reverse order [10]. The container storage space allocation problem (SSAP) consists on affecting each container to the most suitable place in the storage area. The containers are often arranged with the objective of reducing the number of handling operations required later on to load/unload containers.\nIn the literature, various papers were proposed, treating different variants of the problem. Some of them will be presented in this section. Kim and Park [11] proposed a heuristic decision rule and a sub-gradient optimization technique to solve the storage space allocation for outbound containers. Their objective was to find an arrangement of the containers that exploits efficiently the storage space and loading operations. Preston and Kozan [19] proposed a genetic algorithm to solve the container location model at seaport terminals. Their objective was to reduce the transfer and the handling time of containers. This approach took the Brisbane port as a case study and generated good results in comparison to the process already used in this port. Kim [12] presented a technique to estimate the rehandlings number for the next pick-up and the total number of rehandles to pick up all inbound containers in a bay. Kim and Kim [13] proposed a cost model to estimate various cost components related to the import container handling and to determine subsequently the storage space and the number of transfer cranes required. Also, in [14], a prediction model of unloading containers times and equipment utilization is presented. Chen and col. [4] combined diverse meta-heuristics (tabu search, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms) to solve the port yard storage optimization problem. It aims to minimize the space allocated to the cargo within a time interval. Lee and col. [16] developed a heuristic algorithm to solve the yard truck scheduling and the storage allocation problems. Their objective is to minimize the weighted sum of total delay of requests and the cost of total travel time of yard trucks. Zhang and col. [22] solved the (SSAP) using a rolling-horizon approach. Both outbound and inbound containers are considered .Their aim was to minimize the total transportation distance of containers between blocks and vessel berthing locations. In [2], a harmony search algorithm is proposed to solve the SSAP where a single container type was considered. Its aim was to reduce the re-handle operations of containers. The results were compared to a genetic algorithm previously applied to the same problem in [9] and recorded good results. Bazzazi and al. [3] extended the SSAP proposed in the literature [22], where different containers types and sizes are considered simultaneously. The authors proposed a genetic algorithm to solve this problem and they supposed that the allowable blocks to which a container type can be allocated are known in advance. Ayachi and col. [1] developed a genetic algorithm to solve the problem of allocating containers of multiple types, in storage spaces in the port. The results generated by the proposed approach were compared to a Last in First out (LIFO) algorithm. In this paper, a harmony search is applied to solve the SSAP considering multiple containers types (refrigerated, open side, empty, dry, open top and tank)."

      "text" : "The harmony search algorithm is developed to imitate the musician behavior. HS is based on the analogy with the music improvisations process seeking for the best harmony. The harmony in music is analogous to the optimization solution vector, and the ideal harmony is analogous to optimal solution. The musical harmony is improved practice after practice using the set of the pitches played by each instrument. Also, the fitness function is improved iteration by iteration using the values assigned for decision variables. Figure 3 shows this analogy. HS does not require initial values for the decision variables. Additionally, it uses a stochastic random search based on the harmony memory considering rate and the pitch adjusting rate so that derivative information is unnecessary. Compared to earlier meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, the HS algorithm imposes fewer mathematical requirements. So, it can be easily adopted for various types of engineering optimization problems [15]\nThe Harmony search algorithm has been successfully applied to vehicle routing problem [6], hydrologic parameter calibration [15] and to the Storage space allocation problem [2] The HS algorithm includes five steps: parameters initialization, the harmony memory (HM) initialization, the new harmony improvisation, the harmony memory update and the check of termination criterion."

      "text" : "In order to evaluate the results generated by the harmony search approach, a comparative study with a LIFO (Last In First Out) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA) is presented. The LIFO algorithm consists on storing in first time the last placed container in a stack. This principle is applied in most port container terminals, where a manual planning based on experience and rules to assign each container to a certain storage block. The Genetic algorithm was proposed to solve the same problem (SSAP for multiple container type) by Ayachi et al., [1] This GA can be described as follows: Initially, a first generation is randomly generated. Then, a two-point crossover operator is performed to two parent selected using the roulette-wheel method. The mutation operator consists of permuting two randomly selected containers having the same type. Five studied cases are defined by varying the containers numbers and types, to verify the performance of the three approaches. Table 3 described these instances.\nFor each case, the problem is solved 15 times and the mean of fitness values (F) and execution times are calculated. In this part, it’s supposed that the population size is set to 30, Niter to 20, n1, n2 and n3= 3, Nstock_reg to 3 and Nstock_refrig to 2. The results showed in table 4 indicate that the fitness value generated by the HS algorithm is largely better for all studied cases for an execution time tolerant and lower than the execution time for GA.\nThis can be explained by the fact that the genetic algorithms evaluate simultaneously several solutions. The GA used\nselection, crossover and mutation operators to generate a better solution. Sometimes, this process is not effective enough to get optimum solution as they might not effectively preserve important patterns in chromosomes. [15] The curve shown in the following figure confirms results described in the table 4.\nHarmony search algorithm seems well suited to complex problem. It generates good results within a tolerable time even with the diversity types of containers and the appearance of many storage constraints."

      "text" : "In this study, a harmony search algorithm is applied to solve the storage space allocation problem for import containers. In real world case, there are various types of container such as refrigerated, open side, empty, dry, open top, tank... Each container type has storage constraints that must be respected in the allocation process of the storage areas, which let the problem more difficult. That is refrigerated containers must be allocated to the blocks equipped by the power point, tank\ncontainers need to be placed on each others, etc. Despite this difficult, the proposed approach generated good results in a reasonable execution time. Experimental study confirms these and shows the effectiveness of the application of harmony search in the resolution of this problem. An important extension of this research would be to formulate the problem as a dynamic storage space allocation in order to solve and to make decision in real time."
