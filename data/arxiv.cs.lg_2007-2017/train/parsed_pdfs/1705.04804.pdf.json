The structure of data could be local manifold structure [8] [9], global structure [14] [28], discriminative information [24] [12] and etc. To model the structure of data, methods like Gaussian similarity graph, or k-nearest neighbor similarity graph are very popular in machine learning research. All these similarity graphs are built based on the pairwise distance like Euclidean distance (L2 norm) or Manhattan distance (L1 norm) defined between two data samples (vectors). As we can see, the pairwise distance is crucial to the quality of indication vectors, and the success of unsupervised feature selection depends on the accuracy of these indication vectors.\nWhen the dimensional size of data becomes high, or say, for high dimensional datasets, we will meet the curse of high dimensionality issue [2]. That means the differentiating ability of pairwise distance will degraded rapidly when the dimension of data goes higher, and the nearest neighbor indexing will give\ninaccurate results [23] [1]. As a result, the description of data structure by using similarity graphs will be not precise and even wrong. This create an embarrassing chicken-and-egg problem [5] for unsupervised feature selection algorithms: “the success of feature selection depends on the quality of indication vectors which are related to the structure of data. But the purpose of feature selection is to giving more accurate data structure.”\nMost existing unsupervised feature selection algorithms use all original features [5] to build the similarity graph. As a result, the obtained data structure information will not as accurate as the intrinsic one it should be. To remedy this problem, dimensionality reduction techniques are required. For example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Random Projection (RP) are popular methods in machine learning research. However, most of them will project the data matrix into another (lower dimensional) space with the constraint to approximate the original pairwise similarities. As a result, we lose the physical meaning or original features and the meaning of projected features are unknown.\nIn this study, we proposed a graph-based approach to reduce the data dimension by removing redundant features. Without lose of generality, we categorize features into three groups [4]: relevant feature,irrelevant feature and redundant feature. A feature fi is relevant or irrelevant based on it’s correlation with indication vectors (or target vectors named in other articles) Y = {yi, i ∈ [1, k]}. For supervised feature selection algorithms [18] [20] [17], these indication vectors usually relate to class labels. For unsupervised scenario [6] [3], as we mentioned early, they follow the structure of data. Redundant features are features that highly correlated to other features, and have no contribution or trivial contribution to the target learning task. The formal definition of redundant feature is by [26] based on the Markov blanket given by [10].\nBased on the philosophy of sparse learning based MCFS algorithm, a feature could be redundant to another single feature, or to a subset of features. In this work, we propose a graph based approach to identify these two kind of redundancy at the same time. The first step is to build a Sparse Feature Graph (SFG) at feature side based on sparse representation concept from subspace clustering theory [7]. Secondly, we review the quality of sparse representation of each single feature vector and filtered out those failed ones. In the last, we defined Local Compressible Subgraphs (LCS) to represent those local feature groups that are very redundant. Moreover, a greedy local search algorithm is designed to discover all those LCSs. Once we have all LCSs, we pick the feature which has the highest node in-degree as the representative feature and treat all other as redundant features. With this approach, we obtain a new data matrix with reduced size and alleviate the curse of dimensional issues.\nTo be specific, the contribution of our study can be highlighted as:\n• We propose sparse feature graph to model the feature redundancy existing in high dimensional datasets. The sparse feature graph inherits the philosophy of sparse learning based unsupervised feature selection framework. The sparse feature graph not only records the redundancy between two features but also show the redundancy between one feature and a subset\nof features.\n• We propose local compressible subgraph to represent redundant feature groups. And also design a local greedy search algorithm to find all those subgraphs.\n• We reduce the dimensionality of input data and alleviate the curse of dimensional issue through redundant features removal. With a more accurate data structure, the chicken-and-egg problem for unsupervised feature selection algorithms are remedied in certain level. One elegant part of our proposed approach is to reduce the data dimension without any pairwise distance calculation.\n• Abundant experiments and analysis over twelve high dimensional datasets from three different domains are also presented in this study. The experiment results show that our method can obtain better data structure with reduced size of dimensionality, and proof the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\nThe rest of paper is organized as follows. The first section describe the math notation used in our work. The Section 2 introduces the background , motivation and preliminaries of our problem. In Section 3, we define the problem we are going to solve. In Section 4, we present our proposed sparse feature graph algorithm and discuss the sparse representation error problem. We also introduce the local compressible subgraph and related algorithm. The experiment results are reported in Section 5, and a briefly reviewing of related works is given in Section 6. Finally, we conclude our study in last Section 7."

Instead, the data similarity or manifold structure constructed from the whole feature space are used as criteria to select features. Among all those algorithms of unsupervised feature selection, the most famous one is MCFS. The MCFS algorithm is a sparse learning based\nunsupervised feature selection method which can be illustrated as figure 1. The core idea of MCFS is to use the eigenvectors of graph Lapalcian over similarity graph as indication vectors. And then find set of features that can approximate these eigenvectors through sparse linear regression. Let us assume the input data has number K clusters that is known beforehand (or an estimated K value by the expert’s domain knowledge). The top K non-trivial eigenvectors, Y = [y1, · · · ,yk], form the spectral embedding Y of the data. Each row of Y is the new coordinate in the embedding space. To select the relevant features, MCFS solves K sparse linear regression problems between F and Y as:\nmin αi\n‖yi − Fαi‖ 2 + β‖αi‖1, (1)\nwhere αi is a n-dimensional vector and it contains the combination coefficients for different features fi in approximating yi. Once all coefficients αi are collected, features will be ranked by the absolute value of these coefficients and top features are selected. This can be show by a weighted directed bipartite graph as following:"

This is problematic when the dimension of data vector goes higher. To be specific, the pairwise distance between any two data vectors becomes almost the same, and as a consequence of that, the obtained structural information of data is not accuracy. This observation is the motivation of unsupervised Feature Selection with Adaptive Structure Learning (FSASL) algorithm which is proposed by Du et al. [5]. The idea of FSASL is to repeat MCFS iteratively with updating selected feature sets. It can be illustrated as following: FASAL is an iterative algorithms which keeps pruning irrelevant and noisy features to obtain better manifold structure while improved structural info can help to search better relevant features. FASAL shows better performance in normalized mutual information and accuracy than MCFS generally. However, it’s very time consuming since it is an iterative algorithm includes many eigen-decompositions."

Those redundant features can not provide further performance improvement for ongoing learning task. Instead, they impair the efficiency of learning algorithm to find intrinsic data structure.\nIn this section, we describe our definition of feature redundancy. Unlike the feature redundancy defined bt Markov blanket [26] which is popular in existing research works, our definition of feature redundancy is based on the linear correlation between two vectors (the “vector” we used here could be a feature vector or a linear combination of several feature vectors.) To measure the redundancy between two vectors fi and fj , squared cosine similarity[22] is used:\nRij = cos 2(fi,fj). (2)\nBy the math definition of cosine similarity, it is straightforward to know that a higher value of Ri,j means high redundancy existing between fi and fj . For example, feature vector fi and its duplication fi will have Rii value equals to one. And two orthogonal feature vectors will have redundancy value equals to zero."

To be specific:\nProblem 1 Given a high dimensional data represented in the form of feature matrix X, how to remove those redundant features f(·) ∈ X\nT for unsupervised feature selection algorithms such as MCFS?\nTechnically, the MCFS algorithm does not involve redundant features. However, the performance of MCFS depends on the quality of indication vectors which are used to select features via sparse learning. And those indication vectors are highly related to the intrinsic structure of data which is described by the selected features and given distance metric. For example, the MCFS algorithm uses all features and Gaussian similarity to represent the intrinsic structure. This is the discussed ‘chicken-and-egg” problem [5] between structure characterization and feature selection. The redundant and noise features will lead to an inaccurate estimation of data structure. As a result, it’s very demanding to remove those redundant (and noise) features before the calculation of indication vectors."

      "text" : "The most popular way to model the redundancy among feature vectors is correlation such as Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). The correlation value is defined over two feature vectors, and it’s a pairwise measurement. However, there also exiting redundancy between one feature vector and a set of feature vectors according to the philosophy of MCFS algorithm. In this section, we present SFG, which model the redundancy not only between two feature vectors but also one feature vector and a set of feature vectors.\nThe basic idea of sparse feature graph is to looking for a sparse linear representation for each feature vector while using all other feature vectors as dictionary. For each feature vector fi in features set F = [f1, f2, · · ·, fd], SFG solves the following optimization problem:\nmin α∈Rd−1 ‖fi −Φ iαi‖ 2 2, s.t. ‖αi‖0 < L, (3)\nwhere Φi = [f1, f2, · · ·, fi−1, fi+1, · · ·, fd] is the dictionary of fi and each column of Φi is a selected feature from data matrix X. L is a constraint to limit the number of nonzero coefficients. In SFG, we set it to the number of features d. The αi is the coefficient of each atom of dictionary Φ\ni. This coefficient vector not only decides the edge link to fi but also indicates the weight of that connection. The resulted SFG is a weighted directed graph and may have multiple components.\nTo solve the optimization problem 3, we use Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) solver [25] here since the number of features in our datasets is larger than 1,000. We modify the stop criterion of OMP by checking the value change of residual instead of residual itself or the maximum number of supports. The reason is that we want the number of supports (or say, the number of edge connections) to follow the raw data property. Real world datasets are always noisy and messy. It’s highly possible that several feature vectors may fail to find a correct sparse linear representation through OMP. If we set residual or maximum of supports as criteria, we can not differentiate the successful representations and the failed ones.\nThe OMP solver and SFG algorithm can be described as following."

      "text" : "In our modified OMP algorithm 1, we set a new stop criterion of searching sparse representation solution for each feature vector fi. Instead of keep searching until arriving a minimization error, we stop running while the solver could not reduce the length of residual vector anymore. To be specific, the 2-norm of residual vector is monitored and the solver will stop once the change of this value small than a user specified threshold.\nAlgorithm 1: Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)\nInput : Φ = [f1, f2, · · ·, fi−1, fi+1, · · ·, fd] ∈ Rn×(d−1),fi ∈ Rn, ǫ.

Since the goal of SFG is not to find a correct sparse representation for every feature vectors, we utilize the new stop criterion and add a filter process in our algorithm to identify those failed sparse representation.\nTo identify those failed sparse representation, we check the angle between the original vector and the linear combination of its sparse representation. In the language of SFG, we check the angle between a node (a feature vector) and the weighted combination of its one-ring neighbor. Only the neighbors of out edges will be considered. This can be illustrated by following figure 5. As the example in Figure 5, node fi has seven one-ring neighbors. But only bmf1, bmf2,f3,f5,f6 are its sparse representation and f4 and f7 are not. Then the sparse representation error ζ is calculated by:\nf∗i = w1f1 + w2f2 + w3f3 + w5f5 + w6f6,\nζ = arccos(fi,f ∗ i ).\nOnce we have the SFG, we calculate the sparse representation errors for all nodes. A sparse representation is treated as fail if the angle ζ less than a user specified value. We will filter out these node which has failed representation by removing its out-edges."

To archive this goal, we propose a local search algorithm with seed nodes to group those highly correlated features into many subgraphs which are named as local compressible subgraphs in this study. Our local search algorithm involves two steps, the first step is to sort all nodes by the in-degree. By the definition of SFG, the node with higher in-degree means it appears more frequently in other nodes’ sparse representation. The\nsecond step is a local bread-first search approach which finds all nodes that has higher weight connections (in and out) to the growing subgraph.

Without loss of generality, the cluster structure of data is used for evaluation. To be specific, we measure the spectral clustering performance with Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Accuracy (ACC).

ACC is another metric to evaluate the clustering performance by measuring the fraction of its clustering result that are correct.

When θ equals to 30%, it means the edges of SFG that with weights (absolute value) in the highest 70% value range are removed. (It does not mean that 70% of top weights edges are removed).

How to detect and remove them is an important research topic in machine learning and data mining research. In this paper, we propose a graph based approach to find and remove those redundant features automatically for high dimensional data. Based on sparse learning based unsupervised feature selection framework, Sparse Feature Graph (SFG) is introduced not only to model the redundancy between two features, but also to disclose the group redundancy between two groups of features. With SFG, we can divide the whole features into different groups, and improve the intrinsic structure of data by removing detected redundant features. With accurate data structure, quality indicator vectors can be obtained to improve the learning performance of existing unsupervised feature selection algorithms such as multi-cluster feature selection (MCFS). Our experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed SFG and feature redundancy remove algorithm can improve the performance of unsupervised feature selection algorithms consistently.",
