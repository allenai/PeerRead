      "text" : "Recently, neural networks have achieved great success on sentiment classification due to their ability to alleviate feature engineering. However, one of the remaining challenges is to model long texts in document-level sentiment classification under a recurrent architecture because of the deficiency of the memory unit. To address this problem, we present a Cached Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (CLSTM) to capture the overall semantic information in long texts. CLSTM introduces a cache mechanism, which divides memory into several groups with different forgetting rates and thus enables the network to keep sentiment information better within a recurrent unit. The proposed CLSTM outperforms the state-of-the-art models on three publicly available document-level sentiment analysis datasets."

      "text" : "Sentiment classification is one of the most widely used natural language processing techniques in many areas, such as E-commerce websites, online social networks, political orientation analyses (Wilson et al., 2009; O’Connor et al., 2010), etc.\nRecently, deep learning approaches (Socher et al., 2013; Kim, 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016) have gained encouraging results on sentiment classification, which frees researchers from handcrafted feature engineering. Among these methods, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are one of the most\n∗ Corresponding author.\nprevalent architectures because of the ability to handle variable-length texts.\nSentence- or paragraph-level sentiment analysis expects the model to extract features from limited source of information, while document-level sentiment analysis demands more on selecting and storing global sentiment message from long texts with noises and redundant local pattern. Simple RNNs are not powerful enough to handle the overflow and to pick up key sentiment messages from relatively far time-steps .\nEfforts have been made to solve such a scalability problem on long texts by extracting semantic information hierarchically (Tang et al., 2015a; Tai et al., 2015), which first obtain sentence representations and then combine them to generate high-level document embeddings. However, some of these solutions either rely on explicit a priori structural assumptions or discard the order information within a sentence, which are vulnerable to sudden change or twists in texts especially a long-range one (McDonald et al., 2007; Mikolov et al., 2013). Recurrent models match people’s intuition of reading word by word and are capable to model the intrinsic relations between sentences. By keeping the word order, RNNs could extract the sentence representation implicitly and meanwhile analyze the semantic meaning of a whole document without any explicit boundary.\nPartially inspired by neural structure of human brain and computer system architecture, we present the Cached Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (CLSTM) to capture the long-range sentiment information. In the dual store memory model\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n04 98\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n7 O\nct 2\nproposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968), memories can reside in the short-term “buffer” for a limited time while they are simultaneously strengthening their associations in long-term memory. Accordingly, CLSTM equips a standard LSTM with a similar cache mechanism, whose internal memory is divided into several groups with different forgetting rates. A group with high forgetting rate plays a role as a cache in our model, bridging and transiting the information to groups with relatively lower forgetting rates. With different forgetting rates, CLSTM learns to capture, remember and forget semantics information through a very long distance.\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n• We introduce a cache mechanism to diversify the internal memory into several distinct groups with different memory cycles by squashing their forgetting rates. As a result, our model can capture the local and global emotional information, thereby better summarizing and analyzing sentiment on long texts in an RNN fashion. • Benefiting from long-term memory unit with a\nlow forgetting rate, we could keep the gradient stable in the long back-propagation process. Hence, our model could converge faster than a standard LSTM. • Our model outperforms state-of-the-art meth-\nods by a large margin on three document-level datasets (Yelp 2013, Yelp 2014 and IMDB). It worth noticing that some of the previous methods have utilized extra user and product information."

      "heading" : "2.1 Document-level Sentiment Classification",
      "text" : "Document-level sentiment classification is a sticky task in sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008), which is to infer the sentiment polarity or intensity of a whole document. The most challenging part is that not every part of the document is equally informative for inferring the sentiment of the whole\ndocument (Pang and Lee, 2004; Yessenalina et al., 2010). Various methods have been investigated and explored over years (Wilson et al., 2005; Pang and Lee, 2008; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Yessenalina et al., 2010; Moraes et al., 2013). Most of these methods depend on traditional machine learning algorithms, and are in need of effective handcrafted features.\nRecently, neural network based methods are prevalent due to their ability of learning discriminative features from data (Socher et al., 2013; Le and Mikolov, 2014; Tang et al., 2015a). Zhu et al. (2015) and Tai et al. (2015) integrate a tree-structured model into LSTM for better semantic composition; Bhatia et al. (2015) enhances document-level sentiment analysis by using extra discourse paring results. Most of these models work well on sentence-level or paragraph-level sentiment classification. When it comes to the document-level sentiment classification, a bottom-up hierarchical strategy is often adopted to alleviate the model complexity (Denil et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015b)."

      "heading" : "2.2 Memory Augmented Recurrent Models",
      "text" : "Although it is widely accepted that LSTM has more long-lasting memory units than RNNs, it still suffers from “forgetting” information which is too far away from the current point (Le et al., 2015; Karpathy et al., 2015). Such a scalability problem of LSTMs is crucial to extend some previous sentence-level work to document-level sentiment analysis.\nVarious models have been proposed to increase the ability of LSTMs to store long-range information (Le et al., 2015; Salehinejad, 2016) and two kinds of approaches gain attraction. One is to augment LSTM with an external memory (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Monz, 2016), but they are of poor performance on time because of the huge external memory matrix. Unlike these methods, we fully exploit the potential of internal memory of LSTM by adjusting its forgetting rates.\nThe other one tries to use multiple time-scales to distinguish different states (El Hihi and Bengio, 1995; Koutnı́k et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015). They partition the hidden states into several groups and each group is activated and updated at different frequencies (e.g. one group updates every 2 time-step, the other updates every 4 time-step). In these meth-\nods, different memory groups are not fully interconnected, and the information is transmitted from faster groups to slower ones, or vice versa.\nHowever, the memory of slower groups are not updated at every step, which may lead to sentiment information loss and semantic inconsistency. In our proposed CLSTM, we assign different forgetting rates to memory groups. This novel strategy enable each memory group to be updated at every time-step, and every bit of the long-term and shortterm memories in previous time-step to be taken into account when updating."

      "text" : "Long short-term memory network (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) is a typical recurrent neural network, which alleviates the problem of gradient diffusion and explosion. LSTM can capture the long dependencies in a sequence by introducing a memory unit and a gate mechanism which aims to decide how to utilize and update the information kept in memory cell.\nFormally, the update of each LSTM component can be formalized as:\ni(t) = σ(Wix (t) +Uih (t−1)), (1)\nf (t) = σ(Wfx (t) +Ufh (t−1)), (2)\no(t) = σ(Wox (t) +Uoh (t−1)), (3)\nc̃(t) = tanh(Wcx (t) +Uch (t−1)), (4) c(t) = f (t) c(t−1) + i(t) c̃(t), (5) h(t) = o(t) tanh(c(t)), (6)\nwhere σ is the logistic sigmoid function. Operator is the element-wise multiplication operation. i(t), f (t), o(t) and c(t) are the input gate, forget gate, output gate, and memory cell activation vector at time-step t respectively, all of which have the same size as the hidden vector h(t) ∈ RH . Wi, Wf , Wo ∈ RH×d and Ui, Uf , Uo ∈ RH×H are trainable parameters. Here, H and d are the dimensionality of hidden layer and input respectively."

      "text" : "LSTM is supposed to capture the long-term and short-term dependencies simultaneously, but when\ndealing with considerably long texts, LSTM also fails on capturing and understanding significant sentiment message (Le et al., 2015). Specifically, the error signal would nevertheless suffer from gradient vanishing in modeling long texts with hundreds of words and thus the network is difficult to train.\nSince the standard LSTM inevitably loses valuable features, we propose a cached long short-term memory neural networks (CLSTM) to capture information in a longer steps by introducing a cache mechanism. Moreover, in order to better control and balance the historical message and the incoming information, we adopt one particular variant of LSTM proposed by Greff et al. (2015), the Coupled Input and Forget Gate LSTM (CIFG-LSTM).\nCoupled Input and Forget Gate LSTM Previous studies show that the merged version gives performance comparable to a standard LSTM on language modeling and classification tasks because using the input gate and forget gate simultaneously incurs redundant information (Chung et al., 2014; Greff et al., 2015).\nIn the CIFG-LSTM, the input gate and forget gate are coupled as one uniform gate, that is, let i(t) = 1 − f (t). We use f (t) to denote the coupled gate. Formally, we will replace Eq. 5 as below:\nc(t) = f (t) c(t−1) + (1− f (t)) c̃(t) (7)\nFigure 1 gives an illustrative comparison of a standard LSTM and the CIFG-LSTM.\nCached LSTM Cached long short-term memory neural networks (CLSTM) aims at capturing the long-range information by a cache mechanism, which divides memory into several groups, and dif-\nferent forgetting rates, regarded as filters, are assigned to different groups.\nDifferent groups capture different-scale dependencies by squashing the scales of forgetting rates. The groups with high forgetting rates are short-term memories, while the groups with low forgetting rates are long-term memories.\nSpecially, we divide the memory cells into K groups {G1, · · · , GK}. Each group includes a internal memory ck, output gate ok and forgetting rate rk. The forgetting rate of different groups are squashed in distinct ranges.\nWe modify the update of a LSTM as follows.\nr (t) k = ψk σ(Wkrx(t) + K∑ j=1 Uj→kf h (t−1) j )  , (8)\no (t) k = σ(W k ox (t) + K∑ j=1 Uj→ko h (t−1) j ), (9)\nc̃ (t) k = tanh(W k cx (t) + K∑ j=1 Uj→kc h (t−1) j ), (10)\nc (t) k = (1− r (t) k ) c (t−1) k + (r (t) k ) c̃ (t) k , (11) h(t)k = o (t) k tanh(c (t) k ), (12)\nwhere r(t)k represents forgetting rate of the k-th memory group at step t; ψk is a squash function, which constrains the value of forgetting rate rk within a range. To better distinguish the different role of each group, its forgetting rate is squashed into a distinct area. The squash function ψk(z) could be formalized as:\nrk = ψk(z) = 1 K · z+ k − 1 K , (13)\nwhere z ∈ (0, 1) is computed by logistic sigmoid function. Therefore, rk can constrain the forgetting rate in the range of (k−1K , k K ).\nIntuitively, if a forgetting rate rk approaches to 0, the group k tends to be the long-term memory; if a rk approaches to 1, the group k tends to be the shortterm memory. Therefore, group G1 is the slowest, while groupGK is the fastest one. The faster groups are supposed to play a role as a cache, transiting information from faster groups to slower groups.\nBidirectional CLSTM Graves and Schmidhuber (2005) proposed a Bidirectional LSTM (B-LSTM) model, which utilizes additional backward information and thus enhances the memory capability.\nWe also employ the bi-directional mechanism on CLSTM and words in a text will receive information from both sides of the context. Formally, the outputs of forward LSTM for the k-th group is [ −→ h (1) k , −→ h (2) k , . . . , −→ h (T ) k ]. The outputs of backward LSTM for the k-th group is [ ←− h (1) k , ←− h (2) k , . . . , ←− h (T ) k ].\nHence, we encode each word wt in a given text w1:T as h (t) k :\nh (t) k =\n−→ h\n(t) k ⊕\n←− h\n(t) k , (14)\nwhere the ⊕ indicates concatenation operation.\nTask-specific Output Layer for Document-level Sentiment Classification With the capability of modeling long text, we can use our proposed model to analyze sentiment in a document. Figure 2 gives an overview of the architecture.\nSince the first group, the slowest group, is supposed to keep the long-term information and can better represent a whole document, we only utilize the final state of this group to represent a document. As for the B-CLSTM, we concatenate the state of the first group in the forward LSTM at T -th time-step and the first group in the backward LSTM at first time-step.\nThen, a fully connected layer followed by a softmax function is used to predict the probability distribution over classes for a given input. Formally, the probability distribution p is:\np = softmax(Wp × z+ bp), (15)\nwhere Wp and bp are model’s parameters. Here z is −→ h\n(T ) 1 in CLSTM, and z is [\n−→ h\n(T ) 1 ⊕\n←− h\n(1) 1 ] in B-\nCLSTM."

It shows that internal memory plays a key role in text modeling. CIFG-LSTM gives performance comparable to vanilla LSTM.\n2. With the help of bidirectional architecture, models could look backward and forward to capture features in long-range from global perspective. In sentiment analysis, if users show their opinion at the beginning of their review, single directional models will possibly forget these hints.\n3. The proposed CLSTM beats the CIFG-LSTM and vanilla LSTM and even surpasses the bidirectional models. In Yelp 2013, CLSTM achieves 59.4% in accuracy, which is only 0.4 percent worse than B-CLSTM, which reveals that the cache mechanism has successfully and effectively stored valuable information without the support from bidirectional structure.\n4.
