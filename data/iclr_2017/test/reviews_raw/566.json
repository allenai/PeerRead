{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Introducing Active Learning for CNN under the light of Variational Inference", "abstract": "One main concern of the deep learning community is to increase the capacity of representation of deep networks by increasing their depth. This requires to scale up the size of the training database accordingly. Indeed a major intuition lies in the fact that the depth of the network and the size of the training set are strongly correlated. However recent works tend to show that deep learning may be handled with smaller dataset as long as the training samples are carefully selected (let us mention for instance curriculum learning). In this context we introduce a scalable and efficient active learning method that can be applied to most neural networks, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to design an active learning selection scheme based on a variational inference for neural networks. We also deduced a formulation of the posterior and prior distributions of the weights using statistical knowledge on the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. We describe our strategy to come up with our active learning criterion. We assess its consistency by checking the accuracy obtained by successive active learning steps on two benchmark datasets MNIST and USPS. We also demonstrate its scalability towards increasing training set size.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper introduces a mechanism for active learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). I would not go as far as the authors in calling these \"deep\", seeing that they seem to have only 2 hidden layers with only 20 filters each. The active learning criterion is a greedy selection scheme based on variational free energy and a series of approximations.\n\nThe paper is sometimes hard to read, due to (a) many grammatical errors and (b) sloppy notation in some places (e.g., on page 5, line 1, f is used but never introduced before).

The motivations in the introduction, i.e., why it is difficult to do active learning in deep architectures, could be better explained, and tied to the explanation in Section 3 of the paper. For example, the authors motivated the need of (mini)batch label queries, but never mention it again in Section 3, when they describe their main methodology. \nThe related work section, although appearing systematic and thorough, is a little detached from the main body of the paper (related work section should not be a survey of the literature, but help readers locate your work in the relevant literature, and highlight the pros and cons. In this perspective, maybe the authors could shorten some explanations over the related work that are not directly related, while spending more time on discussing/comparing with works that are most related to your current work, e.g., that of Graves '11.\n\nOriginality & Significance:\nThe authors proposed an active learning training framework. The idea is to treat the network parameter optimization problem as a Bayesian inference problem (which is proposed previously by Graves) and formulate the active learning problem as that of sampling the most informative data, where the informativeness is defined by the variational free energy, which depends on the Fisher information. To reconcile the computational burden of computing the inverse of Fisher Information matrix, the authors proposed techniques to approximate it (which seems to be novel)\n\nI think that this paper initiates an interesting direction: one that adapts deep learning to label-expensive problems, via active learning. But the paper needs to be improved in terms of presentation.\n\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "19 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 2}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Proof of concept for active learning with CNNs", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper introduces a mechanism for active learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
