      "text" : "Our mobile phones produce metadata every time we send or received a text or a phone call. These metadata – recording who calls or texts who, for how long, and from where – provide a detailed view of human behavior including mobility at large-scale. This data has great potential for good but often lacks basic demographic information, which is why there has recently been a growing interest in predicting demographic information, such as age and gender, from mobile phone metadata. Previous approaches relied on standard machine learning algorithms and hand-engineered features (Sarraute et al., 2014; Frias-Martinez et al., 2010).\nConvolutional networks (ConvNets) have recently systematically outperformed existing approaches in analyses of large-scale image datasets (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014). We show in this work how a ConvNet can be used to predict demographic information such as age and gender from standard mobile phone metadata."

      "heading" : "2 TEMPORAL REPRESENTATION",
      "text" : "We focus on using the temporal information contained in mobile phone metadata. We represent the data as 8 matrices summarizing mobile phone usage on a given week with hours of the day on the x-axis and the weekdays on the y-axis (see Figure 1). These 8 matrices are combined into a tensor (less formally, a 3-dimensional matrix) with a separate ’channel’ for each of the 8 variables of interest. These 8 channels are the number of unique contacts, calls, texts and the total duration of calls for respectively incoming and outgoing interactions. We model each week separately.\n*Corresponding author: yvesalexandre@demontjoye.com\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 66\n0v 4\n[ cs\n.L G\nhttp://localhost:8888/\n1 of 1 26-May-15 22:01"

      "heading" : "3 CONVNET ARCHITECTURE",
      "text" : "Choosing the right architecture of the ConvNet for the task at hand is crucial to reaching high accuracy for the prediction task. We use a series of 5 horizontal conv. layers followed by a vertical conv. filter and 2 dense layers (see Table 1) to capture increasingly abstract patterns.\nThe ConvNet performs a prediction of the demographic attribute on each week of data using the softmax layer. These predictions are traditionally averaged to generate a single prediction for the user. We find that using the ConvNet as a feature extractor with a support vector machine (SVM) for prediction increases accuracy by 1 to 3 percentage points (see Table 2)."

      "heading" : "4 RESULTS",
      "text" : "We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on gender and age prediction. Our results are based on anonymized call detail records (CDRs) for 150.000 people in a Western European country for 15 weeks. Table 2 shows that our method achieves a high accuracy on both age and gender prediction."
