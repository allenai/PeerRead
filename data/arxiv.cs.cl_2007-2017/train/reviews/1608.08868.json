We conduct a case study of dialectal language in online conversational text by investigating African-American English (AAE) on Twitter. We propose a distantly supervised model to identify AAE-like language from demographics associated with geo-located messages, and we verify that this language follows well-known AAE linguistic phenomena. In addition, we analyze the quality of existing language identification and dependency parsing tools on AAE-like text, demonstrating that they perform poorly on such text compared to text associated with white speakers. We also provide an ensemble classifier for language identification which eliminates this disparity and release a new corpus of tweets containing AAE-like language.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 14:12:01 GMT  (80kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08868v1", "To be published in EMNLP 2016, 15 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "To be published in EMNLP 2016, 15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["su lin blodgett", "lisa green", "brendan t o'connor"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.08868"}
