      "text" : "Semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for categorizing posts in Web discussion\nforums\nKrish Perumal\nMaster of Science\nGraduate Department of Computer Science\nUniversity of Toronto\n2016\nWeb discussion forums are used by millions of people worldwide to share information belonging to a variety of domains such as automotive vehicles, pets, sports, etc. They typically contain posts that fall into different categories such as problem, solution, feedback, spam, etc. Automatic identification of these categories can aid information retrieval that is tailored for specific user requirements. Previously, a number of supervised methods have attempted to solve this problem; however, these depend on the availability of abundant training data. A few existing unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches are either focused on identifying a single category or do not report category-specific performance. In contrast, this work proposes unsupervised and semi-supervised methods that require no or minimal training data to achieve this objective without compromising on performance. A fine-grained analysis is also carried out to discuss their limitations. The proposed methods are based on sequence models (specifically, Hidden Markov Models) that can model language for each category using word and part-of-speech probability distributions, and manually specified features. Empirical evaluations across domains demonstrate that the proposed methods are better suited for this task than existing ones.\nii"

Among these, Web discussion forums are platforms where people converse with one another to collaboratively solve problems and discuss issues. These forums might encompass a wide range of topics (e.g., Yahoo Answers1) or be limited to a narrow domain (e.g., JeepForum2). The former kind of forums are typically organized into topic hierarchies, essentially reducing them to forums of the latter kind. For example, Yahoo Answers consists of topics such as Arts and Humanities, Health, Family and Relationships, etc. Further, Family and Relationships contains sub-topics such as Family, Friends, Marriage and Divorce, etc. Such a hierarchy enables easier navigation for users who wish to seek or provide information about a specific topic of their interest. Within each topic, forums consist of individual conversations, called threads, each containing multiple user messages, called posts.\n1http://answers.yahoo.com 2http://www.jeepforum.com/\n1\nChapter 1. Introduction 3\nAn example discussion forum thread is shown in Table 1.1. Here, user 15JKU (called original poster from here onward) initially asks for advice on whether 35’s model tires on 18-20-inch wheels are good for daily driving as well as mudding (a hobby of driving jeeps on muddy off-road surfaces). The user also does not want the wheels to make much noise. User mschi772 responds that the original poster is expecting too much from a single tire, and requests clarification on the user’s priorities. The original poster clarifies that he/she wants to know how loud the models of wheels and tires are, and that the priority is suitability for mudding. User mschi772 proposes another model called Nitto Trail Grapplers which are better for mudding, but would make noise and wear out quickly on streets. User JcArnold responds that he/she has 37-inch trails which work well in rock and snow. User Pedro7 joins the conversation by asking the original poster to not go for mud tires if noise is a concern. The user recommends Nittos as the best possible solution, but warns against expecting a perfect tire for every situation. Finally, the original poster provides feedback by thanking everyone and announcing that he/she is choosing Nittos.\nTable 1.1 also contains a column (which is not part of the original forum) mentioning the manually identified purpose of each post in the thread. With this information, a user seeking a solution to a similar problem need only read three out of six posts replying to the first post. Without such information, the user must read the entire thread. This problem becomes much more pronounced in cases where threads contain tens or hundreds of posts, and reading the entire thread becomes impractical (unless one participates in the thread conversation from the beginning). For example, http://www.jeepforum. com/forum/f15/mud-tires-119948/ contains more than 500 posts discussing popular brands of tires. Most of these posts involve off-topic personalized discussions. In such cases, the purpose of each post can guide the user towards useful posts (i.e., containing solutions) and away from trivial posts (i.e., containing feedback or off-topic discussions). Moreover, current information retrieval techniques return entire threads as results to search queries. But by being sensitized to these annotations, they can return targeted\nChapter 1. Introduction 4\nresults containing only relevant posts instead of entire threads. Further, user-contributed information contained in these forums can be better structured and contribute towards the development of domain-specific knowledge bases. With these motivations in mind, this work aims to automatically annotate each post in a discussion forum with its purpose in the conversation thread.\nThe problem described is neither a novel nor a neglected one in the field of computational linguistics (as will be demonstrated in the discussion of related work in the following chapter). It is closely related to the problem of dialogue act tagging, which is defined as the identification of the meaning of an utterance at the level of illocutionary force (Stolcke et al., 2000), i.e., an utterance could be identified as falling into one or more categories such as problem, solution, clarification, feedback, command, request, etc. Most of the previous work has concentrated on supervised machine learning methods which make use of manually annotated data in order to predict the annotations of unseen data. In contrast, this paper discusses novel approaches using minimal (semi-supervised) or no manually annotated data (unsupervised). Some previous work on semi-supervised and unsupervised methods exists; however, this research paper will empirically demonstrate (in section 5) that the proposed methods perform better.\nThe main contributions of this work are the following.\n• Summarizing existing work on categorizing discussion forum posts and discussing\ntheir limitations.\n• Proposing novel methods based on sequence models for categorizing discussion\nforum posts with minimal or no annotated data.\n• Developing an annotated dataset of discussion forums from a hereto neglected au-\ntomotive domain.\n• Conducting experiments to analyze the performance of existing and proposed meth-\nods on datasets belonging to different domains.\nChapter 2\nRelated Work\nThe problem of identifying the purpose or intention of each post in a discussion forum thread has been extensively tackled in previous literature. However, there is no unanimously agreed-upon set of tags to identify, because they depend on the final objective of the tagging process. For example, the objective of an answer retrieval system is better achieved by concentrating on identifying Question and Answer posts alone, whereas the objective of an answer quality assessment system is fulfilled by additionally identifying Positive/Negative Feedback posts. Most of the previous work has concentrated on tackling these kind of dialogue categories, and uses the term dialogue act tagging. Also, some previous work has named categories specific to the target domain. For example, a forum on the medical domain may typically consist of posts explaining medical conditions and those providing treatment options, hence identifying categories such as Medical Problem and Treatment, whereas a forum on the computer-related technical domain may consist of categories such as Problem: Hardware, Problem: Software, Solution: Install and Solution: Search. This research paper does not restrict itself solely to dialogue act tagging ; neither does it address the classification of categories for only a specific domain. Hence, it uses the general term forum post categorization.\n5\nChapter 2. Related Work 7"

      "text" : "Supervised machine learning methods use previously labeled data for training, in order to predict the categories assigned to unseen data. Related previous work on classification of categories of discussion forum posts has largely focused on the application of these methods. In particular, most of the work has concentrated on the computer-related technical domain. Catherine et al. (2012) employed Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to extract Answer posts in a thread (assuming that the first post in the thread is a Question). They used a number of structural and syntactic features, in addition to forum-specific features such as author authority1 and post ratings. Their methods were evaluated on a corpus of Apple discussion forums2. Bhatia et al. (2012) used supervised machine learning algorithms (i.e., SVMs, logit model classifier, naive Bayes, etc.) to classify forum posts into eight categories — Question, Repeat Question, Clarification, Further Details, Solution, Positive Feedback, Negative Feedback, and Junk. They evaluated their methods on a dataset of the Ubuntu forums3. Qu and Liu (2011) used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to classify forum posts into four categories — Problem, Solution, Good Feedback and Bad Feedback. They evaluated their methods on the Oracle database support forums4. Similarly, Wang et al. (2010) attempted to identify Problem and Solution posts in the CNET forums5 dataset, but with more fine-grained categories based on the types of Problem posts (i.e., Hardware, Software, Media, OS, Network, and Programming) and Solution posts (i.e., Documentation, Install, Search, and Support). Kim et al. (2010) worked on the same dataset, and attempted to classify posts into 12 categories that are similar to the ones used by Bhatia et al. (2012). Additionally, they tagged the links between posts, i.e., identifying which post is a reply to which other post. For both tasks,\n1According to Catherine et al. (2012), author authority is a numerical or categorical value that is indicative of an author’s level of expertise in the context of the forum.\n2https://discussions.apple.com 3http://ubuntuforums.org 4https://community.oracle.com/community/database/ 5http://forums.cnet.com\nChapter 2. Related Work 8\nthey reported the best performance using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Wang et al. (2011) went one step further by jointly classifying both posts and the links between them. They used two different methods: (1) composition of results from both tasks done separately, and (2) combination of post and link tag sets in a single task. Two other papers reported work on forums on the travel and medical domains. Ding et al. (2008) used CRFs to identify Answer posts and the context in which they answered the Question post. However, they did not attempt to identify Question posts, because they were assumed to be known beforehand. Their techniques were evaluated on a corpus of the TripAdvisor forums6. Sondhi et al. (2010) used CRFs and SVMs with various semantic and structural features to identify Medical Problem and Treatment in the HealthBoards forums7. A summary of all these methods is presented in Table 2.1. A major drawback of these approaches is that they are constrained by the requirement of manually annotated data for training, and are limited in applicability to the domains they are trained on."

      "heading" : "2.2 Unsupervised Methods",
      "text" : "Unsupervised methods identify unlabeled clusters of data, each of which could potentially be mapped to a target category that one wants to identify. These methods use a taskdependent measure of similarity to identify whether two input units should belong to the same cluster or not, and in some cases, also model the interactions between the clusters. In contrast to supervised techniques, they require no labeled data; hence, they are not limited in applicability to a specific domain. To the best of our knowledge, three unsupervised techniques have been previously proposed for categorization of posts in Web forums. Cong et al. (2008) used labeled sequential patterns to identify Question posts, followed by a graph-based propagation method to extract corresponding Answer posts. The question detection phase was supervised, whereas answer extraction was\n6http://www.tripadvisor.com/ForumHome 7http://www.healthboards.com\nChapter 2. Related Work 9\nunsupervised. The graph-based propagation used language models and author authority in order to assign scores to the links (edges) between posts (nodes). The method was evaluated on a corpus of forum threads on the travel domain. Deepak and Visweswariah (2014) identified Solution posts using a translation-based model that leverages lexical correlations between Problem and Solution posts. Joty et al. (2011) used a combination of HMMs and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) in order to classify forum posts into 12 dialogue act categories. In addition to word n-grams, they used some structural features such as the chronological position of a post in the thread, the number of tokens in the post, and author identity. Both these papers reported results on corpora of forums on the computer-related technical domain (i.e., Apple discussion forums and Ubuntu forums). Other unsupervised techniques have been employed for the related tasks of dialogue act classification in spoken dialogue systems (Crook et al., 2009) and Twitter conversations (Ritter et al., 2010). Although they worked specifically on genres of text that are very different from Web forums, they can potentially inspire future approaches tailored for Web forums. All these unsupervised approaches ignored the evaluation of category-wise classification. Instead, they reported overall accuracy measures which do not adequately reflect the technique’s performance (as will be shown in chapter 5). One major drawback of unsupervised methods is that they often generate clusters that are undesired or have no meaning in the real world. For example, clustering of forum posts on the travel domain might lead to a cluster containing posts pertaining to New York City sightseeing alone. This is a meaningful cluster in general, but it has no meaning when one aims to find clusters of post categories such as Question, Answer, Feedback, etc. Moreover, because the clusters are unlabeled, post-processing is necessary to map the clusters to the categories that are desired as the output.\nChapter 2.

To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two semi-supervised methods for categorization of posts in Web forums. One employed domain adaptation from labeled spoken dialogue datasets by means of a sub-tree pattern mining algorithm (Jeong et al., 2009). Another method extracted Answer posts in forum threads using a co-training framework (Catherine et al., 2013). However, it focused only on extracting Answer posts, with the assumption that the first post in a thread is a Question. Both methods used features such as the chronological position of a post in the thread, and post and author ratings."

      "heading" : "2.4 Methods Applied to Other Tasks",
      "text" : "There exists other previous work that is applied to tasks unrelated to forum post categorization but which inspires the development of techniques discussed in this research paper. Barzilay and Lee (2004) proposed a content model for multi-document summarization based on sentence extraction. This model consists of an HMM at the sentence level that is tailored towards identifying sentence clusters belonging to different topics. Inspired by this model, Ritter et al. (2010) suggested a ‘conversation model’ for the modeling of dialogue acts in Twitter conversations. Their model replicates Barzilay’s model but replaces sentences in a document with tweets in a Twitter conversation as units of the HMM. They used Topic Modeling (using Latent Dirichlet Allocation) along with the conversation model and reported better performance; but the evaluation was done only qualitatively. Similarly, Joty et al. (2011) applied conversation models to email and forum threads where a single post is considered an HMM unit. They further enriched this technique by using structural features from emails and forums, in addition to language\nChapter 2. Related Work 11\nmodels. They used GMMs along with their feature-enhanced conversation models, and reported better performance than using conversation models alone. The motivation for these techniques is that HMMs can model the sequential nature of dialogue acts well. For example, the fact that a Solution is more likely to follow a Problem, as opposed to any other category, can be implicitly encoded in the HMMs.\nChapter 3\nDescription of Implemented\nMethods\nThe code for existing methods (that are relevant to this work) is not available to other researchers. Also, a number of technical details that are necessary for reproduction are omitted in literature. Hence, it is important to describe the implementations of previous methods that inspire or form the basis of the proposed methods. In the process, a few enhancements are also proposed.

      "text" : "The conversation model that was introduced in the previous chapter is described here. While there are three different variants of this model (as described in the previous chapter), this work implements the originally proposed model by Barzilay and Lee (2004), while making necessary modifications for applying it to forum post categorization. The conversation model is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), in which hidden (unobserved) states correspond to post categories, and emissions (observed) correspond to bags of post\n12\nChapter 3. Description of Implemented Methods 13\nn-grams. A plate notation of the equivalent graphical model is shown in Figure 3.1 (derived from Ritter et al. (2010) and Joty et al. (2011)). Here, a thread Tk consists of a sequence of category labels, and each category label Ci emits a bag of word n-grams Ni of the ith chronological post in the thread.\nThe priors for this model are derived from a two-step process: (i) every post is represented as a vector of word n-gram frequency counts, and (ii) the vectors are clustered using hierarchical clustering. The resultant cluster labels are used to calculate the frequency counts of initial HMM states and state transitions, and hence, the corresponding probabilities. The priors are optionally calculated using an additional concept of insertion states. These are the states which contain a number of posts fewer than a fixed threshold, called state size threshold. This concept is used to account for small noise states that pertain to no meaningful target category. If used, all insertion states are merged into a single state, representing a noise state.\nThe learning algorithm (Algorithm 1) of the conversation model uses iterative Expectation Maximization (EM) to maximize the expected probability of a post given a state, repeating until convergence of the sum of all observation probabilities. During the expectation step (E-step), a word n-gram language model is constructed for each state. Using this state-specific language model, the emission probability of an observation (or\nChapter 3. Description of Implemented Methods 14\npost) can be calculated. During the maximization step (M-step), the most likely state sequence is calculated using Viterbi algorithm. All configuration parameters used in this algorithm are described in Table 3.1.

The number of dimensions of the vector is equal to the word vocabulary size of all posts.\n• cluster : Given a set of vectors, it clusters them using the complete linkage hierar-\nchical clustering algorithm with cosine distance metric, and outputs a cluster label for each vector.\n• merge small states : Given a list of states (one for each post), it merges all states\nwith fewer than stateSizeThreshold number of posts into a single state, and outputs the updated states as well as the updated number of states. This is applicable only if the mergeInsertionStates parameter is set to true.\n• language model : Constructs a word n-gram language model for the posts belonging\nto a given state.

A plate notation of the resultant model is shown in Figure 3.2. Here a thread Tk consists of a sequence of category labels, and each category label Ci and Gaussian mixture Mi emit a bag of word n-grams Ni, which corresponds to the i th chronological post in the thread.

This might better characterize the syntactic nature of the post. This is based on the assumption that posts belonging to the same category are likely to be syntactically similar. The proposed model uses POS n-gram language models in addition to word n-gram language models, and calculates the HMM emission probability of a post given its state using a linear combination of both. Here, the probability of a post Pi, given a state Sk, is calculated as shown in Equation 3.3.\np(Pi|Sk) = ∏\nj [λ× p(Wi,j|Lk) + (1− λ)× p(POSi,j|PLk)] Z\n0 ≤ λ ≤ 1\nZ = ∑ i,k [∏ j [λ× p(Wi,j|Lk) + (1− λ)× p(POSi,j|PLk)] ] (3.3)\nwhere:\nPOSi,j is the j th (in no particular order) POS n-gram in post Pi, PLk is the POS n-gram language model for state Sk, λ is the parameter that controls the proportion of probability arising from the word and POS language models (using λ = 1 is equivalent to the conversation model), and Z is the normalizing constant.\nChapter 3.

The conversation models with POS tags require the setting of a configuration parameter which decides the proportion of probability that comes from language and POS models in the linear combination. Also, this parameter value (when fixed) is used uniformly across all word and POS n-grams. However, one could estimate a parameter value that is specific to a word and POS tag pair by using frequency counts from predicted labels during the previous iteration of the EM algorithm.

In this procedure, one set of disjoint nodes of the bipartite graph corresponds to the set of predicted cluster labels, and the other set corresponds to the set of manually obtained gold labels. The weight of an edge from cluster label c to gold label g is calculated as the number of posts which are predicted as c and also have a gold label g. Joty et al. (2011) follow the same procedure.\nChapter 4\nData Collection and Annotation\nPrevious work has used forum datasets belonging to the travel and computer-related technical domains (listed in Table 4.1).\nIn addition to these, the current work attempts to observe the performance of post categorization on forums belonging to the automotive domain. For this purpose, forums that discuss Jeep and Mercedes-Benz vehicles were obtained from Verticalscope\n27\nInc.1 Around 150 threads each were randomly picked from JeepForum2 and BenzWorld3. Threads whose first posts contained advertisements or spam posts (as identified by Topic Modeling done previously) were filtered out. Also, threads which had only one post or more than 30 posts, were discarded. This resulted in a total of 93 threads in the JeepForum dataset, and 108 threads in the Benzworld dataset.\nNext, previous literature was studied in order to decide the tagset of categories to annotate the forum posts in the dataset. Kim et al. (2010) use a tagset of 12 categories — Question, Question-Add, Question-Confirmation, Question-Correction, Answer, Answer-Add, Answer-Confirmation, Answer-Correction, Answer-Objection, Resolution, Reproduction, and Other. Since this is the most fine-grained set of categories, a pilot annotation study was conducted using these. Five annotators annotated posts from six randomly picked threads in the automotive domain. Based on the quantitative results of the annotation and the feedback from annotators, it was observed that using a more\n1Verticalscope Inc.

These categories and their description are shown in Table 4.2.\nThe main annotation task was set up on CrowdFlower4, a Web platform for obtaining crowdsourced annotations. In each thread, the posts were displayed to the annotators in chronological order. Some posts contain quoted text, i.e., a span of text from a previously posted answer. These were enclosed within ‘[QUOTE]’ tags along with the username of the post which is quoted. Some posts contain URLs or images, which were displayed to the annotators using the tags ‘[URL]’ and ‘[IMG]’ respectively. In addition to providing the target set of annotation categories, the following instructions were provided to the annotators.\n4http://www.crowdflower.com/\nChapter 4. Data Collection and Annotation 30\nThe top three trusted annotators were picked from each annotation task, and gold labels were assigned to each post if at least two out of three annotators agreed. However, if there was disagreement among all annotators, the post was left unlabeled. Details of the resulting datasets, including the inter-annotator agreements and quantity of data, are shown in Table 4.3. Since the annotations were crowdsourced, there is no common set of annotators for each post. Hence, instead of using standard annotation quality measures like Scott’s π and Fleiss’s κ, Krippendorf’s α is reported, which can account for missing values (Artstein and Poesio, 2008). The values obtained (i.e., 0.62 and 0.47) are reflective of moderate to substantial agreement. In order to further confirm the validity of the annotations, two annotators randomly sampled 10% of the threads and\nChapter 4.

Stopword removal was found to degrade performance; hence, it was not used. It is important to note that forum conversations often consist of informal English language text, along with the use of domain-specific abbreviations, and non-standard special characters, such as ellipses and emoticons. Hence, some errors are introduced in all the previous steps. However, no effort was made to overcome them, and this is accepted as a limitation of the current work.\nAll methods, except those using post embeddings, require the conversion of posts to vectors of n-grams. For this purpose, both unigrams and bigrams were tried, and the former was found to produce better performance. The use of TF-IDF term weighting did\nChapter 5. Experiments 34\nnot improve performance; hence, it was ignored. The maximum number of iterations of Expectation Maximization was set to 100, which was sufficient because all experimental runs were completed in fewer than 100 iterations. The values of both smoothing parameters (i.e., delta1 and delta2 ) were varied in the range of 10−1 to 10−9. Subsequently, 10−2 and 10−9 were found to be the best values for delta1 and delta2 respectively. The value of the POS model’s λ was varied between 10−6 and 1− 10−6, and the value of 0.999 was found to be the best. Since the unigram/bigram vocabulary size is much larger than the POS tag vocabulary size, the former probability distribution is much more fine-grained. For example, each word unigram’s probability value in the Benzworld dataset is of the order of 10−4 (since the unigram vocabulary size is 5000), whereas each POS unigram’s probability value is of the order of 10−2 (since the POS vocabulary size is 42). So, the value of 0.999 for word unigrams and 0.001 for POS unigrams can be viewed as a scaling factor to ensure that both contribute almost equally towards discriminating between post categories. To provide further clarity, using a λ value of 0.5 gives rise to a predominantly POS-based model because unigram probability values are too low to make a significant difference towards identifying one category over another. The parameters, initialNumClusters and stateSizeThreshold, directly affect the resulting number of clusters. In all experimental runs, both these parameters were varied in the range of 1 to 100, and those which did not output the desired number of clusters (i.e., number of distinct gold labels) were ignored. In each case, different parameter values were best suited; however, only the best performing results are reported. For GMM-based methods, the number of Gaussian mixture components was varied from 2 to 8, and 3 was found to be the best value.

The dataset was randomly (by sampling from the uniform distribution) divided into n equal-sized folds, and the experiment was run n times. In each\nChapter 5. Experiments 35\nrun, one fold was used for initializing the priors of the models, and the remaining n− 1 folds were used for evaluation. This is in contrast to a traditional fully supervised setting, where n− 1 folds are used for training and the remaining fold is used for evaluation.\nIn the case of language models, it was observed that accuracy values differ by more than two percentage points when using unigram and bigram language models. Also, different datasets benefited from different models. Hence, experiments were run using both, and results are reported for the better performing alternative.\nA number of enhancements were proposed in section 3.2.5 with the objective of further enhancing the performance of the conversation models. However, in all cases, these led to deteriorating performance. Specifically, the use of character or skip-gram language models in isolation or in conjunction with word language and POS models lowered performance by around 2 percentage points with respect to the best performing method. The use of fractional contributions of language and POS modeling led to performance deterioration of up to 10 percentage points. Hence, these enhancements are ignored when reporting results."

The unsupervised methods include the novel application of conversation models that were previously proposed for other tasks. Although the experimental results demonstrate that they are not practically useful, they are shown to perform better than previously proposed methods.

Next, it was proposed to use a novel semi-supervised version of the earlier methods by employing a few labeled threads to guide the process. Experimental results demonstrate that these methods outperformed all the baselines. Also, an indirect comparison with a semi-supervised method proposed in previous work, demonstrates better performance.\n44\nChapter 6. Conclusions and Future Work 45"

      "text" : "Discussion forum posts often contain multiple dialogue categories , i.e., a post could start with a Solution to a previous Problem, and end with a new Problem posed for users to discuss in future posts. In such cases, the post is annotated with a single representative category. Although this might be straightforward for human annotators, the proposed methods have no intuition about this. Hence, it might be useful to employ summarization, so as to retain the overall meaning of the post, and cut out the parts that are not representative. Such methods need only classify the relevant text in the post and might perform better. This problem could also be tackled by classifying individual sentences in posts, rather than the post as a whole. This could be done in a two-tier HMM setup where the first level comprises sentence classification, and the second level comprises of post classification. However, this proposal is dependent on the availability of datasets that are annotated by category at the sentence level. Instead, majority voting or other heuristics could be employed to pool the predicted categories of individual sentences into a single post category.\nSince all the proposed methods employ first-order HMMs, they lack the knowledge of long-range dependencies between different categories. Consequently, they are unable to learn that a post can not be classified as Solution, without a Problem post before it. This problem can be addressed by using higher-order Markov chains, but it would lead to much greater run-time and space complexity. Instead, the use of heuristics to flag certain categories, based on prior post categories in the thread, could resolve this problem more efficiently.\nComparison of fine-grained and coarse-grained classification results indicates that Clarification-Request and Clarification categories are not easy to identify. Since interannotator agreement values for these two categories are also the least among all categories, it seems that manual identification is also not easy. Hence, future work should\nChapter 6.

Previously, a number of supervised methods have attempted to solve this problem; however, these depend on the availability of abundant training data. A few existing unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches are either focused on identifying a single category or do not report category-specific performance. In contrast, this work proposes unsupervised and semi-supervised methods that require no or minimal training data to achieve this objective without compromising on performance. A fine-grained analysis is also carried out to discuss their limitations. The proposed methods are based on sequence models (specifically, Hidden Markov Models) that can model language for each category using word and part-of-speech probability distributions, and manually specified features. Empirical evaluations across domains demonstrate that the proposed methods are better suited for this task than existing ones.",
