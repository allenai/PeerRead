      "text" : "Deep directed generative models have received increasing attention recently, because the top-down connections explicitly model the data generating process. Different levels of latent variables capture features (or abstractions [15]) in a coarse-to-fine manner. Compared with undirected models such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) [17], directed generative models have their own advantages. First, samples can be easily obtained by straightforward ancestral sampling without the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Second, there is no partition function issue since the joint distribution is obtained by multiplying all local conditional probabilities, which requires no further normalization. Last but most importantly, the latent variables are dependent on each other given the observations ∗Email: nies@rpi.edu. Affiliation: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA. †Email: jiq@rpi.edu.

Through their inter dependency, latent variables coordinate with each other to better explain the patterns in the visible layer.\nLearning directed models with many latent variables is challenging, mainly due to the intractable computation of the posterior probability. Although Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is a straightforward solution, the mixing stage is often too slow. To simplify the inference for deep belief networks, Hinton et al. [8] introduced a complementary prior for the latent variables which makes the posterior fully factorized. Some recent efforts for learning generative models have focused on variational methods [12, 13, 16], by introducing another distribution to approximate the true posterior and maximize a variational lower bound of the data likelihood. The approximating distribution is typically fully factorized for computational efficiency. However, the assumption of the factorized distribution sacrifices the “ explain-away” effect for efficient inference, which inevitably enlarges the distance to the true posterior, and weakens the representation power of the model. This defeats a major advantage of directed graphical models.\nIn this work, we address the problem of learning deep directed models in a different direction. We propose to use the EM algorithm with two approximations in the inference and learning phases. First, we approximate the true posterior distribution during inference by the conditional pseudo-likelihood, which preserves to certain degree the dependencies among latent variables. Second, we approximate the data likelihood using a max-out setting during the E-step of the learning to overcome the exponential number of configurations of the latent variables. As a result, the E-step requires the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, which is efficiently solved based on the pseudo-likelihood. It can also be seen as the application of iterated conditional modes (ICM) [2] to directed graphical models. In the M-step, the problem is transferred into parameter learning with complete data, which is much easier to handle."

      "text" : "The research on learning directed model with latent variables can be dated back to 1990s. A standard approach is the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, which maximizes the expected data log-likelihood for parameter learning. EM algorithm and its variants have been used for learning latent mixture of factor analyzers [6], probabilistic latent semantic indexing [10], probabilistic latent semantic analysis [11] and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [3]. Such models have a few latent variables so that the posterior probability of latent variables can be exactly computed in the E-step.\nIn the case of many latent variables, exact computation of the posterior is intractable because of the exponential number of the latent variable configurations. Patel et al. [15] make one latent variable connecting to a small patch of the input data. Therefore each patch and the corresponding latent variable form a small model, which allows exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Many other approaches have been proposed to approximate the posterior probability of latent variables along two directions.\nOne approach is to replace the true posterior distribution with a factorized distribution as an approximation. This approach was first proposed by Saul et al. [20], known as the mean field theory for learning sigmoid belief networks. A fully fac-\ntorized variational posterior is introduced to approximate the true posterior distribution of latent variables. Recently, Gan et al. [5] extended the mean field method, and proposed a Bayesian approach to learn deep sigmoid belief networks by introducing sparsity-encoraging priors on the model parameters. Alternatively, the posterior distribution can be approximated using a feed-forward network. The wake-sleep algorithm [9] augments the multi-layer belief networks with feed-forward recognition networks. Wake-sleep alternates between updating the model parameters in the wake phase and the recognition network parameters in the sleep phase. Inspired by this idea, many approaches have been proposed recently for learning directed graphical models by maximizing a variational lower bound on the data log-probability. Mnih and Gregor [13] introduced the neural variational inference and learning (NVIL) algorithm for sigmoid belief networks. A feed-forward inference network is used to obtain exact samples from the variational posterior. A neural network is introduced to reduce the variance of the samples. Kingma and Welling [12] proposed the auto-encoding variational Bayes method for continuous latent variables, in which a reparameterization is employed to efficiently generate samples from the Gaussian distribution. Similarly, Rezende et al. [16] propose a stochastic backpropagation algorithm for learning deep generative models with continuous latent variables. Gregor et al. [7] augment the directed model with an encoder, which is also kind of inference network.\nAnother direction is to make the posterior probability factorized by specifically designing a prior distribution of latent variables. Hinton et al. [8] proposed a complementary prior to ensure a factorized posterior, and proposed a fast learning algorithm for deep belief networks (DBNs), which is basically a hybrid network with a single undirected layer and several directed layers.\nIn all the above-mentioned methods, the inference typically assumes independency among latent variables due to special prior or factorized approximation in order to accelerate the inference. Because of this assumption, the inference network is not able to capture the correlations among the latent variables. Therefore the approximate posterior might differ significantly from the underlying true posterior. In this work, we intend to preserve the latent variable dependencies for better data representation. We approximate the posterior probability by the conditional pseudo-likelihood, and employ a hard version of the EM algorithm for parameter estimation."

The latent variables in LRBN are binary, and the visible variables can be continuous or discrete. Each latent variable is connected to all visible variables.

      "text" : "For discrete LRBN, both latent and observation variables are discrete. For brevity, we discuss the binary case with observation variables x ∈ Bnd and latent variables h ∈ Bnh . We assume that the latent variables h determine the patterns in data x, therefore directed links are used to model their relationships, as in a Bayesian network.\nPrior probability for latent variables is represented as a log-liner model,\nP (hj = 1) = σ(dj) , (1)\nwhere dj is the parameter defining the prior distribution for node hj ; σ(·) is the sigmoid function σ(z) = 1/(1 + e−z).\nThe conditional probability given the latent variables is, P (xi = 1|h) = σ( ∑ j wijhj + bi) , (2)\nwhere wij is the weight of the link connecting node hj and xi; bi is the offset for node xi. The joint probability is,\nPθ(x, h)= exp (∑ i,jwijxihj+ ∑ ibixi+ ∑ jdjhj− ∑ i log ( 1 + exp( ∑ j wijhj + bi) )) ∏ j(1+exp(dj)) . (3) In this case, the model becomes a sigmoid belief network (SBN) [14] with one latent layer. If more layers are added on top, the conditional probability is defined in the same way as Eq. 2. The model is named a regression model based on the nature of the conditional probability. For discrete visible node, the input to the sigmoid function is a linear combination of the latent variables; for continuous visible node, the mean of a visible node is a linear combination of its parent nodes.\nAs a similar model with undirected links, RBMs (Fig. 1 (b)) have been widely used in the literature for feature learning and data representation. The joint probability defined by a discrete RBM is,\nPRBM(x, h)= 1\nZ exp ∑ i bixi+ ∑ i,j wijxihj+ ∑ j djhj  . (4)\nComparing Eq. 3 and 4, the additional terms in the numerator captures the correlations among them. This is the reason why P (h|x) is not factorized over individual latent nodes hj in LRBN, which is the major difference from RBM. An advantage of Eq. 3 is that every term can be computed given the values of all variables, without the issue of the intractable partition function Z.\nThe discussion of hybrid LRBN is moved to a supplementary material due to the limited space."

To simplify the learning process, each component of the data is normalized to have zero mean and unit variance, therefore σi is set to 1.

However,\nthe directed model has a quadratic term hTWTWh = ∑ i (∑ j wijhj )2 , which does\nnot exist in the joint distribution of RBM.

      "heading" : "4 LRBN Inference",
      "text" : "In this section, we introduce an efficient inference method for LRBN based on conditional pseudo-likelihood. Given a LRBN model with known parameters, the goal of inference is to compute the posterior probability of the latent variables given input data, i.e., computing P (h|x).\nIn this work, we are interested in the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, which is to find the configuration of latent variables that maximizes the posterior probability given observations,\nh∗ = argmax h P (h|x) . (9)\nThe MAP inference is motivated by the observation that from the data generating point of view, the variables in one latent layer take values according to the conditional probability given its upper layer. Therefore this configuration dominates all the others in explaining each data sample. In addition, the goal of feature learning is to learn a feature h that best explains x. In this regard, we only care about the most probable states of the latent variables given the observation.\nBecause of the dependencies among elements of h, direct computing P (h|x) is computationally intractable, in particular when the dimension of h is high. According to the chain rule, the posterior probability of h is,\nP (h|x) = ∏ j P (hj |h1, . . . , hj−1, x) , (10)\nThe pseudo-likelihood replaces the conditional likelihood by a more tractable objective, i.e., P (h|x) ≈ ∏ j P (hj |h−j , x) , (11)\nwhere h−j = {h1, . . . , hj−1, hj+1, . . . , hnh} is the set of all latent variables except hj . In this approximation, we add conditioning over additional variables.\nThe conditional pseudo-likelihood can be factorized into local conditional probabilities, which can be estimated in parallel. To optimize over the pseudo-likelihood, one latent variable is updated by fixing all other variables,\nht+1j = argmax hj P (hj |x, ht−j) , 1 ≤ j ≤ nh , (12)\nwhere t denotes the tth iteration.\nTheorem 1 The updating rule (Eq. 12) guarantees that the posterior probabilityP (h|x) will only increase or stay the same after each iteration.\nP (ht+1j , h t −j |x) ≥ P (ht|x) . (13)\nThe conditional probability of one latent variable by fixing all other variables is easy to compute, since it involves the computation of the joint distribution twice.\nP (hj |x, h−j)= P (hj , x, h−j)∑ h′j P (h′j , x, h−j) . (14)\nIn general, computing the joint probability P (x, h) has complexity O(ndnh). If each latent variable is updated t times to get h∗, the overall complexity for the LRBN inference is O(tndn2h), which is much lower than the O(2\nnhndnh) complexity when computing P (h|x) directly.\nThe updating method can be seen as a coordinate ascent algorithm or the iterated conditional modes (ICM) as in inference of Markov random fields. Typically in MRF the number of neighbors for one node is limited. In the case of LRBN, one latent variable is related to all the other variables, due to the rich dependencies encoded in the structure. As discussed above, existing methods to address the inference intractability problem makes the posterior probability completely factorized, therefore sacrificing the dependencies among the latent variables. In contrast, through pseudo-likelihood, we can preserve the dependencies to certain degree.\nThe inference method requires an initialization for the hidden variables. Different initializations will end up with different local optimal points. To obtain consistent initialization, we drop the direction of the links, and treat the directed model as an undirected one. Therefore, the latent variables are independent of each other given the observations. Specifically, for binary input,\nP (hj = 1|x) = σ( ∑ i wijxi + dj) . (15)\nFor continuous input, based on Eq. 7, we drop the off-diagonal terms of matrix WTW for the sake of efficiency, resulting in a factorized distribution of the latent variables,\nP (hj = 1|x) = σ( ∑ i wijxi + dj − sj) , (16)\nwhere (s1, . . . , snh) = diag( 1 2W TW ). For the initialization, the dependency among the latent variables is ignored, and then through coordinate ascent, it is recovered by updating a subset of variables with others fixed."

In this work, we employ a max-out estimation of the data log-probability, with the following objective function,\nθ∗ = argmax θ ∑ m logmax h Pθ(x (m), h) .

A delta function must be avoided since it is also factorized, which defeats our motivation of preserving the dependency.\nWith objective function Eq. 18, the learning method becomes a hard version of the EM algorithm, which iteratively fills in the latent variables and update the parameters. In the E-step, h∗ = argmaxh P (x, h) is effectively estimated using the proposed inference method. In the M-step, the problem of parameter estimation is straightforward because now we are dealing with complete data.\nFor binary observations, the parameter learning can be decomposed into learning local CPD for each variable, by solving multiple logistic regression problems.

For each dataset, we randomly selected 100 samples from the training set to form a validation set. The joint probability on the validation set is a criterion for early stopping.\nIn this section, we first evaluate the MAP configuration of the latent variables through reconstruction.

The reconstruction error |x̃ − x|2 can evaluate how well the model fits the data.\nThe second criterion is the widely used test data log-probability. Directly computing probability P (x) is intractable due to the exponentially many terms in the summation P (x) = ∑ h P (x, h). In this work, we estimate the log-probability using the conservative sampling-based log-likelihood (CSL) method [1],\nlog P̂ (x) = logmeanh∈SP (x|h) , (34)\nwhere S is a set of samples h of the latent variables collected from a Markov chain. The expectation of the estimator is a lower bound on the true log-likelihood [1]. Because of the nature of directed models, samples can be collected from the ancestral sampling procedure.

One million samples are used to reach convergence of the estimation of log-probability, and the average of ten repetitions is reported.\nThe reconstruction error evaluates the quality of the most probable explanation of the latent variables given observations, while the data log-probability evaluates the overall quality of all configurations of latent variables.

We introduce an efficient inference method based on pseudo-likelihood and coordinate ascent. A hard EM learning method is proposed for efficient parameter learning. The proposed inference method solve the inference intractability, while preserving the dependencies among latent variables. We theoretically and empirically compare different models and learning methods. We point out that the latent variables in regression Bayesian network have strong dependencies, which can better explain the patterns in the input layer. Experiments on benchmark datasets shows the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing models in data reconstruction and achieves comparable performance for data representation."

    "abstractText" : "Deep directed generative models have attracted much attention recently due to their expressive representation power and the ability of ancestral sampling. One major difficulty of learning directed models with many latent variables is the intractable inference. To address this problem, most existing algorithms make assumptions to render the latent variables independent of each other, either by designing specific priors, or by approximating the true posterior using a factorized distribution. We believe the correlations among latent variables are crucial for faithful data representation. Driven by this idea, we propose an inference method based on the conditional pseudo-likelihood that preserves the dependencies among the latent variables. For learning, we propose to employ the hard Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, which avoids the intractability of the traditional EM by max-out instead of sum-out to compute the data likelihood. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our model against state of the art deep models on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in data representation and reconstruction.",
