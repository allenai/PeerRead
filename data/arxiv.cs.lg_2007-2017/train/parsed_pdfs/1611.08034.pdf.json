      "text" : "Language modeling is a fundamental task, used for example to predict the next word or character in a text sequence given the context. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown promising performance on this task (Mikolov et al., 2010; Sutskever et al., 2011). RNNs with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) have emerged as a popular architecture, due to their representational power and effectiveness at capturing long-term dependencies.\nRNNs are usually trained via back-propagation through time (Werbos, 1990), using stochastic optimization methods such as stochastic gradient de-\nscent (SGD) (Robbins and Monro, 1951); stochastic methods of this type are particularly important for training with large data sets. However, this approach often provides a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of model parameters. The MAP solution is a single point estimate, ignoring weight uncertainty (Blundell et al., 2015; HernándezLobato and Adams, 2015). Natural language often exhibits significant variability, and hence such a point estimate may make over-confident predictions on test data.\nTo alleviate this overfitting problem in RNNs, good regularization is known as a key factor to successful applications. In the neural network literature, Bayesian learning has been proposed as a principled method to impose regularization and incorporate model uncertainty (MacKay, 1992; Neal, 1995), by imposing prior distributions on model parameters. Due to the intractability of posterior distributions in neural networks, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) (Neal, 1995) has been used to provide sample-based approximations to the true posterior. Despite the elegant theoretical property of asymptotic convergence to the true posterior, HMC and other conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are not scalable to large training sets.\nThis paper seeks to scale up Bayesian learning of RNNs to meet the challenge of the increasing amount of “big” sequential data in natural language processing, by leveraging recent advances in stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) algorithms (Welling and Teh, 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016a). Specifically, instead of training a single network, SG-MCMC is employed to train an ensemble of networks, where each network has its parameters drawn from a shared posterior distribution. This is implemented by adding additional gradient noise during training and utilizing model\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n08 03\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 N\nov 2\n01 6\naveraging when testing. This simple procedure has the following favorable properties for training neural networks: (i) The injected noise encourages model-parameter trajectories when training to better explore the parameter space. This procedure was also empirically found effective in (Neelakantan et al., 2016). (ii) Model averaging when testing alleviates overfitting and hence improves generalization, transferring uncertainty in the learned model parameters to subsequent prediction. (iii) In theory, both asymptotic and non-asymptotic consistency properties of SG-MCMC methods in posterior estimation have been recently established to guarantee convergence (Chen et al., 2015a; Teh et al., 2016). (iv) SG-MCMC is scalable; it shares the same level of computational cost as SGD in training, by only requiring the evaluation of gradients on a small mini-batch. To the authors’ knowledge, RNN training using SG-MCMC has not been investigated previously, and is a contribution of this paper. We also perform extensive experiments on several natural language processing tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of SG-MCMC for RNNs, including character/word-level language modeling, image captioning and sentence classification."

      "text" : "Several scalable Bayesian learning methods have been proposed recently for neural networks. These come in two broad categories: stochastic variational inference (Graves, 2011; Blundell et al., 2015; Hernández-Lobato and Adams, 2015) and SG-MCMC methods (Korattikara et al., 2015;\nLi et al., 2016a). While prior work focuses on feed-forward neural networks, there has been little if any research reported for RNNs using SGMCMC.\nDropout (Hinton et al., 2012; Srivastava et al., 2014) is a commonly used regularization method for training neural networks. Recently, there has been several works on studying how to apply dropout to RNNs (Pachitariu and Sahani, 2013; Bayer et al., 2013; Pham et al., 2014; Zaremba et al., 2014; Bluche et al., 2015; Moon et al., 2015; Semeniuta et al., 2016; Gal and Ghahramani, 2016b). Among them, naive dropout (Zaremba et al., 2014) can impose weight uncertainty only on encoding weights (those that connect input to hidden units) and decoding weights (those that connect hidden units to output), but not the recurrent weights (those that connect consecutive hidden states). It has been concluded that noise added in the recurrent connections leads to model instabilities, hence disrupting the RNN’s ability to model sequences.\nDropout has been recently shown to be a variational approximation technique in Bayesian learning (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016a; Kingma et al., 2015). Based on this, (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016b) proposed a new variant of dropout that can be successfully applied to recurrent layers, where the same dropout masks are shared along time for encoding, decoding and recurrent weights, respectively. Alternatively, we focus on SG-MCMC, which can be viewed as the Bayesian interpretation of dropout from the perspective of posterior sampling (Li et al., 2016b); this also allows imposition of model uncertainty on recurrent layers, boosting performance. A comparison of naive dropout and SG-MCMC is illustrated in Fig. 1."

Our goal is to learn model parameters θ to best characterize the relationship from Xn to Yn, with corresponding data likelihood p(D|θ) =∏N n=1 p(Dn|θ). In Bayesian statistics, one sets a prior on θ via distribution p(θ). The posterior p(θ|D) ∝ p(θ)p(D|θ) reflects the belief concerning the model parameter distribution after observing the data. Given a test input X̃ (with missing output Ỹ), the uncertainty learned in training\nis transferred to prediction, yielding the posterior predictive distribution:\np(Ỹ|X̃,D)= ∫ θ p(Ỹ|X̃,θ)p(θ|D)dθ . (1)\nWhen the input is a sequence, RNNs may be used to parameterize the input-output relationship. Specifically, consider input sequence X = {x1, . . . ,xT }, where xt is the input data vector at time t. There is a corresponding hidden state vector ht at each time t, obtained by recursively applying the transition function ht = H(ht−1,xt) (specified in Section 3.2; see Fig. 1). The ouput Y differs depending on the application: a sequence {y1, . . . ,yT } in language modeling or a discrete label in sentence classification. In RNNs the corresponding decoding function is p(y|h), described in Section 3.3."

      "heading" : "3.2 RNN Architectures",
      "text" : "The transition function H(·) can be implemented with a gated activation function, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) or a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014). Both LSTM and GRU have been proposed to address the issue of learning long-term sequential dependencies.\nLong Short-Term Memory The LSTM architecture addresses the problem of learning longterm dependencies by introducing a memory cell, that is able to preserve the state over long periods of time. Specifically, each LSTM unit has a cell containing a state ct at time t. This cell can be viewed as a memory unit. Reading or writing the cell is controlled through sigmoid gates: input gate it, forget gate ft, and output gate ot. The hidden units ht are updated as follows:\nit = σ(Wixt +Uiht−1 + bi) ,\nft = σ(Wfxt +Ufht−1 + bf ) ,\not = σ(Woxt +Uoht−1 + bo) ,\nc̃t = tanh(Wcxt +Ucht−1 + bc) ,\nct = ft ct−1 + it c̃t , ht = ot tanh(ct) ,\nwhere σ(·) denotes the logistic sigmoid function, and represents the element-wise matrix multiplication operator. W{i,f,o,c} are encoding weights, and U{i,f,o,c} are recurrent weights, as shown in Fig. 1. b{i,f,o,c} are bias terms.\nVariants Similar to the LSTM unit, the GRU also has gating units that modulate the flow of information inside the hidden unit. It has been shown that a GRU can achieve similar performance to an LSTM in sequence modeling (Chung et al., 2014). We specify the GRU in the Supplementary Material.\nThe LSTM can be extended to the bidirectional LSTM and multilayer LSTM. A bidirectional LSTM consists of two LSTMs that are run in parallel: one on the input sequence and the other on the reverse of the input sequence. At each time step, the hidden state of the bidirectional LSTM is the concatenation of the forward and backward hidden states. In multilayer LSTMs, the hidden state of an LSTM unit in layer ` is used as input to the LSTM unit in layer `+1 at the same time step."

      "text" : "The proposed Bayesian framework can be applied to any RNN model; we focus on the following basic tasks to demonstrate the ideas.\nLanguage Modeling In word-level language modeling, the input to the network is a sequence of words, and the network is trained to predict the next word in the sequence with a softmax classifier. Specifically, for a length-T sequence, denote yt = xt+1 for t = 1, . . . , T − 1. x1 and yT are always set to a special START and END token, respectively. At each time t, there is a decoding function p(yt|ht) = softmax(Vht) to compute the distribution over words, where V are the decoding weights (the number of rows of V corresponds to the number of words/characters). We also extend this basic language model to consider other applications: (i) a character-level language model can be specified in a similar manner by replacing words with characters (Karpathy et al., 2016). (ii) Image captioning can be considered as a conditional language modeling problem, in which we learn a generative language model of the caption conditioned on an image (Vinyals et al., 2015).\nSentence Classification Sentence classification aims to assign a semantic category label y to a whole sentence X. This is usually implemented through applying the decoding function once at the end of sequence: p(y|hT ) = softmax(VhT ), where the final hidden state of a RNN hT is often considered as the summary of the sentence (here\nthe number of rows of V corresponds to the number of classes)."

To ease the computational burden, stochastic optimization is often employed to find the MAP solution. This is equivalent to minimizing an objective of regularized loss function U(θ) that corresponds to a (non-convex) model of interest: θMAP = argminU(θ), U(θ) = − log p(θ|D). The expectation in (1) is approximated as:\np(Ỹ|X̃,D)= p(Ỹ|X̃,θMAP) .

      "text" : "SG-MCMC and stochastic optimization are two parallel lines of work, designed for different purposes; their relationship has recently been revealed in the context of deep learning. The most basic SG-MCMC algorithm has been applied to Langevin dynamics, and is termed SGLD (Welling and Teh, 2011). To help convergence, a momentum term has been introduced in SGHMC (Chen et al., 2014), a “thermostat” has been devised in SGNHT (Ding et al., 2014; Gan et al., 2015) and preconditioners have been employed in pSGLD (Li et al., 2016a). These SG-MCMC algorithms often share similar characteristics with their counterpart approaches from the optimization literature such as the momentum SGD, Santa (Chen et al., 2016) and RMSprop/Adagrad (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012; Duchi et al., 2011). The interrelationships between SG-MCMC and optimizationbased approaches are summarized in Table 1.\nSGLD Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) (Welling and Teh, 2011) draws posterior samples, with updates\nθt = θt−1 − ηtf̃t−1 + √ 2ηtξt , (6)\nwhere ηt is the learning rate, and ξt ∼ N (0, Ip) is a standard Gaussian random vector. SGLD is the SG-MCMC analog to SGD, whose parameter updates are given by:\nθt = θt−1 − ηtf̃t−1 . (7)\nAlgorithm 1: pSGLD Input: Default hyperparameter settings:\nηt = 1×10−3, λ = 10−8, β1 = 0.99.

The additional Gaussian term in SGLD helps the learning trajectory to explore the parameter space to approximate posterior samples, instead of obtaining a local minimum.\npSGLD Preconditioned SGLD (pSGLD) (Li et al., 2016a) was proposed recently to improve the mixing of SGLD. It utilizes magnitudes of recent gradients to construct a diagonal preconditioner to approximate the Fisher information matrix, and thus adjusts to the local geometry of parameter space by equalizing the gradients so that a constant stepsize is adequate for all dimensions. This is important for RNNs, whose parameter space often exhibits pathological curvature and saddle points (Pascanu et al., 2013), resulting in slow mixing. There are multiple choices of preconditioners; similar ideas in optimization include Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011), Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) and RMSprop (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012). An efficient version of pSGLD, adopting RMSprop as the preconditioner G, is summarized in Algorithm 1, where denotes element-wise matrix division. When the preconditioner is fixed as the identity matrix, the method reduces to SGLD."

These methods improve the generalization ability of deep models, by randomly adding binary/Gaussian noise to the local units or global weights. For neural networks\nwith the nonlinear function q(·) and consecutive layers h1 and h2, dropout and dropConnect are denoted as:\nDropout: h2 = ξ0 q(θh1), DropConnect: h2 = q((ξ0 θ)h1),\nwhere the injected noise ξ0 can be binary-valued with dropping rate p or its equivalent Gaussian form (Wang and Manning, 2013):\nBinary noise: ξ0 ∼ Ber(p),\nGaussian noise: ξ0 ∼ N (1, p\n1− p ).\nNote that ξ0 is defined as a vector for dropout, and a matrix for dropConnect. By combining dropConnect and Gaussian noise from the above, we have the update rule (Li et al., 2016b):\nθt+1 = ξ0 θt − η\n2 f̃t = θt −\nη 2 f̃t + ξ ′ 0 , (8)\nwhere ξ′0 ∼ N ( 0, p(1−p)diag(θ 2 t ) )\n; (8) shows that dropout/ dropConnect and SGLD in (6) share the same form of update rule, with the distinction being that the level of injected noise is different. In practice, the noise injected by SGLD may not be enough. A better way that we find to improve the performance is to jointly apply SGLD and dropout. This method can be interpreted as using SGLD to sample the posterior distribution of a mixture of RNNs, with mixture probability controlled by the dropout rate."

      "text" : "We first test character-level and word-level language modeling. The setup for each task is as follows.\n• Following (Karpathy et al., 2016), we test character-level language modeling on the War and Peace (WP) novel. The training/validation/test sets contain 260/32/33 batches, in which there are 100 characters. The vocabulary size is 87, and we consider a 2-hidden-layer RNN of dimension 128.\n• The Penn Treebank (PTB) corpus (Marcus et al., 1993) is used for word-level language modeling. The dataset adopts the standard split (929K training words, 73K validation words, and 82K test words) and has a vocabulary of size 10K. We train LSTMs of three sizes; these are denoted the small/medium/large LSTM. All LSTMs have two layers and are unrolled for 20 steps. The small, medium and large LSTM has 200, 650 and 1500 units per layer, respectively.\nWe study the effects of different types of architecture (LSTM/GRU/Vanilla RNN) on the WP dataset, and effects of different learning algorithms on the PTB dataset. The comparison of test cross-entropy loss on WP is shown in Table 2. We observe that pSGLD consistently outperforms RMSprop. Table 3 summarizes the test set performance on PTB1. It is clear that our sampling-based method consistently outperforms the optimization counterpart, where the performance gain mainly comes from adding gradient noise and model averaging. When compared with dropout, SGLD performs better on the small LSTM model, but slightly worse on the medium and large LSTM model. This may imply that dropout is suitable to regularizing large networks, while SGLD exhibits better regularization ability on small networks, partially due to the fact that dropout may inject a higher level of noise during training than SGLD. In order to inject a higher level of noise into SGLD, we empirically apply SGLD and dropout jointly, and found that this provided the best performace on the medium and large LSTM model.\nWe study three strategies to do model averaging, i.e., forward collection, backward collection and thinned collection. Given samples (θ1, · · · ,θK) and the number of samples S used for averaging, forward collection refers to using (θ1, · · · ,θS) for the evaluation of a test function, backward collection refers to using (θK−S+1, · · · ,θK), while\n1The results reported here do not match (Zaremba et al., 2014) due to the differences of experimental setup. However, we provide a fair comparison to all methods.\nthinned collection chooses samples from θ1 to θK with interval K/S. Fig. 2 plots the effects of these strategies, where Fig. 2(a) plots the perplexity of every single sample, Fig. 2(b) plots the perplexities using the three schemes. It can be seen that only after 20 samples is a converged perplexity achieved in the thinned collection, while it requires 30 samples for forward collection or 60 samples for backward collection. This is unsurprising, because thinned collection provides a better way to select samples. Nevertheless, averaging of samples provides significantly lower perplexity than using single samples. Note that the overfitting problem in Fig. 2(a) is also alleviated by model averaging.\nTo better illustrate the benefit of model averaging, we visualize in Fig. 3 the probabilities of each word in a randomly chosen test sentence. The first 3 rows are the results predicted by 3 distinctive model samples, respectively; the bottom row is the result after averaging. Their corresponding perplexities for the test sentence are also shown on the right of each row. The 3 individual samples provide reasonable probabilities. For example, the consecutive words “New York”, “stock exchange” and “did not” are assigned with a higher probability. After averaging, we can see a much lower perplexity, as the samples can complement each other.

However, the learned uncertainty\nalleviates overfitting and results in lower errors on the validation and testing datasets.\nTo further study the Bayesian nature of the proposed approach, in Fig. 6 we choose two testing sentences with high uncertainty (i.e., standard derivation in prediction) from the TREC dataset. Interestingly, after embedding to 2d-space with tSNE (Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008), the two sentences correspond to points lying on the boundary of different classes. We use 20 model samples to estimate the prediction mean and standard derivation on the true type and predicted type. The classifier yields higher probability on the wrong types, associated with higher standard derivations. One can leverage the uncertainty information to make decisions: either manually make a human judgement when uncertainty is high, or automatically choose the one with lower standard derivations when both types exhibits similar prediction means. A more rigorous usage of the uncertainty information is left as future work."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We propose a scalable Bayesian learning framework using SG-MCMC, to model weight uncertainty in recurrent neural networks. The learn-\ning framework is tested on several tasks, including language models, image caption generation and sentence classification. Our algorithm outperforms conventional stochastic optimization algorithms, indicating the importance of learning weight uncertainty in recurrent neural networks. Our algorithm requires little additional computational overhead in training, and multiple times of forward-passing for model averaging in testing. Future works include improving the testing efficiency for the large-scale RNNs, via learning a single neural network that approximates the model averaging result (Korattikara et al., 2015)."

The hidden units ht are updated as follows:\nrt = σ(Wrxt +Urht−1 + br) , (9)\nzt = σ(Wzxt +Uzht−1 + bz) , (10)\nh̃t = tanh(Whxt +Uh(rt ht−1) + bh) , (11)\nht = (1− zt) ht−1 + zt h̃t , (12)\nwhere σ(·) denotes the logistic sigmoid function, and represents the element-wise multiply operator.

      "text" : "B.1 Standard Language Modeling\nFor an input sequence X = {x1, . . . ,xT }, where xt is the input data vector at time t, we define an output sequence Y = {y1, . . . ,yT } with yt = xt+1 for t = 1, . . . , T − 1. x1 and yT are always set to a special START and END token, respectively. The probability p(Y|X) is defined as\np(Y|X) = T∏ t=1 p(yt|x≤t) = T∏ t=1 p(yt|ht) . (13)\nAt each time t, there is a decoding function p(yt|ht) = softmax(Vht) to compute the distribution over words, where V are the decoding weights. The hidden states are recursively updated by ht = H(ht−1,xt), where H is a nonlinear function such as the LSTM or GRU defined above.\nB.2 Image Captioning\nImage caption generation is considered as a conditional language modeling problem, where image features are first extracted by residual network (He et al., 2016) as a preprocessing step, and then fed into the RNN to generate the caption. Denote z as the image feature vector, using the same notation as in standard language modeling, the probablity p(Y|X, z) is defined as\np(Y|X, z) = T∏ t=1 p(yt|x≤t, z) = T∏ t=1 p(yt|ht) .\nThe only difference with a standard language model is that at the first time step, we use the image feature vector z to update h1 = H(h0,x1, z). h0 is set to a zero vector. The hidden states at other time steps are recursively updated by ht = H(ht−1,xt), as in standard language modeling. Note that the image feature vector z is only used to generate the first word, which works better in practice than when being used at each time step of the RNN (Vinyals et al., 2015)."

      "heading" : "D Experimental Setup",
      "text" : "For RNN training, orthogonal initialization is employed on all recurrent matrices (Saxe et al., 2014). Non-recurrent weights are initialized from a uniform distribution in [−0.01, 0.01]. All the bias terms are initialized to zero. It is observed that setting a high initial forget gate bias for LSTMs can give slightly better results (Le et al., 2015). Hence, the initial forget gate bias is set to 3 throughout the experiments. Word vectors are initialized with the publicly available word2vec vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013). These vectors have dimensionality 300 and were trained using a continuous bag-of-words architecture . Words not present in the set of pre-trained words are initialized at random. Gradients are clipped if the norm of the parameter vector exceeds 5 (Sutskever et al., 2014).\nThe hyperparameters for the algorithm include stepsize, minibatch size, thinning interval, number of burn-in epochs and variance of the Gaussian priors. We explain some hyperparameters that are unique in pSGLD and list the specific values used in our experiments in Table 6. RMSprop employs the same hyperparameter setting as pSGLD. Throughout the experiments, the dropout rate is set to 0.5.\nThe learning rate for SGD and SGLD (used in the word-level language modeling) is set to 1. For\nthe small LSTM model, we halved the learning rate every epoch after the 4th. For the medium LSTM model, we decrease the learning rate by a factor of 1.2 every epoch after the 6th. For the large LSTM model, we decrease the learning rate by a factor of 1.15 every epoch after the 15th. This setup is also used in (Zaremba et al., 2014). However, we did not use the final hidden states of the current mini-batch as the initial hidden state of the subsequent mini-batch. For every sequence in every mini-batch, we initialize the hidden states to zero.\nVariance of Gaussian Prior The prior distributions on the weights of RNNs are Gaussian, with mean 0 and variance σ2. The variance of this Gaussian distribution determines the prior belief of how strongly these weights should concentrate on 0. A larger variance in the prior leads to a wider range of weight choices, thus higher uncertainty. We set σ2 to 1 throughout the experiments.\nBurn-in To obtain a good initialization for parameter samples from regions of higher probability, we dispose of samples at the beginning of an MCMC run, prior to collection, this is called “burn-in”. We provide the number of burn-in on each dataset in Table 6.\nThinning Due to the fact of high autocorrelation time between samples in SG-MCMC methods, we suggest to thin the Markov chain which leaves fewer, less correlated samples. As with conventional MCMC, these thinned samples have a lower autocorrelation time and can help maintain a higher effective sample size while reducing the computational burden."

However, traditional training of RNNs using back-propagation through time often suffers from overfitting. One reason for this is that stochastic optimization (used for large training sets) does not provide good estimates of model uncertainty. This paper leverages recent advances in stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (also appropriate for large training sets) to learn weight uncertainty in RNNs. It yields a principled Bayesian learning algorithm, adding gradient noise during training (enhancing exploration of the model-parameter space) and model averaging when testing. Extensive experiments on various RNN models and across a broad range of applications demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over stochastic optimization.",
