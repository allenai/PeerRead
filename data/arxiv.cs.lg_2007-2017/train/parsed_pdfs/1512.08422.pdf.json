      "text" : "Recognizing entailment and contradiction between two sentences (called a premise and a hypothesis) is known as natural language inference (NLI) in MacCartney (2009). Provided with a premise sentence, the task is to judge whether the hypothesis can be inferred (entailment), or the hypothesis cannot be true (contradiction). Several examples are illustrated in Table 1.\nNLI is in the core of natural language understanding and has wide applications in NLP, e.g., question answering (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006) and automatic summarization (Lacatusu et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2011a; Yan et al., 2011b). Moreover, NLI is also related to other tasks of sentence pair modeling, including paraphrase detection (Hu et al., 2014), relation recognition of discourse units (Liu et al., 2016), etc.\nTraditional approaches to NLI mainly fall into two groups: feature-rich models and formal reasoning methods. Feature-based approaches typically leverage machine learning models, but require intensive human engineering to represent lexical and syntactic information in two sentences\n∗Equal contribution. †Corresponding authors.\n(MacCartney et al., 2006; Harabagiu et al., 2006). Formal reasoning, on the other hand, converts a sentence into a formal logical representation and uses interpreters to search for a proof. However, such approaches are limited in terms of scope and accuracy (Bos and Markert, 2005).\nThe renewed prosperity of neural networks has made significant achievements in various NLP applications, including individual sentence modeling (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Mou et al., 2015) as well as sentence matching (Hu et al., 2014; Yin and Schütze, 2015). A typical neural architecture to model sentence pairs is the “Siamese” structure (Bromley et al., 1993), which involves an underlying sentence model and a matching layer to determine the relationship between two sentences. Prevailing sentence models include convolutional networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) and recurrent/recursive networks (Socher et al., 2011b). Although they have achieved high performance, they may either fail to fully make use of the syntactical information in sentences or be difficult to train due to the long propagation path. Recently, we propose a novel tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) to alleviate the aforementioned problems and have achieved higher performance in two sentence classification tasks (Mou et al., 2015). However, it is less clear whether TBCNN can be harnessed to model sentence pairs for implicit logical inference, as is in the NLI task.\nIn this paper, we propose the TBCNN-pair neural model to recognize entailment and contradiction between two sentences. We lever-\nAccpeted by ACL’16 as a short paper\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n08 42\n2v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n3 M\nay 2\n01 6\nage our newly proposed TBCNN model to capture structural information in sentences, which is important to NLI. For example, the phrase “riding bicycles on the streets” in Table 1 can be well recognized by TBCNN via the dependency relations dobj(riding,bicycles) and prep on(riding,street). As we can see, TBCNN is more robust than sequential convolution in terms of word order distortion, which may be introduced by determinators, modifiers, etc. A pooling layer then aggregates information along the tree, serving as a way of semantic compositonality. Finally, two sentences’ information is combined by several heuristic matching layers, including concatenation, element-wise product and difference; they are effective in capturing relationships between two sentences, but remain low complexity.\nTo sum up, the main contributions of this paper are two-fold: (1) We are the first to introduce tree-based convolution to sentence pair modeling tasks like NLI; (2) Leveraging additional heuristics further improves the accuracy while remaining low complexity, outperforming existing sentence encoding-based approaches to a large extent, including feature-rich methods and long short term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent networks.1"

      "text" : "Entailment recognition can be viewed as a task of sentence pair modeling. Most neural networks in this field involve a sentence-level model, followed by one or a few matching layers. They are sometimes called “Siamese” architectures (Bromley et al., 1993).\nHu et al. (2014) and Yin and Schütze (2015) apply convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the individual sentence model, where a set of feature detectors over successive words are designed to extract local features. Wan et al. (2015) build sentence pair models upon recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to iteratively integrate information along a sentence. Socher et al. (2011a) dynamically construct tree structures (analogous to parse trees) by recursive autoencoders to detect paraphrase between two sentences. As shown, inherent structural information in sentences is oftentimes important to natural language understanding.\nThe simplest approach to match two sentences, 1 Code is released on:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/tbcnninference/\nperhaps, is to concatenate their vector representations (Zhang et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2014, Arc-I). Concatenation is also applied in our previous work of matching the subject and object in relation classification (Xu et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016). He et al. (2015) apply additional heuristics, namely Euclidean distance, cosine measure, and elementwise absolute difference. The above methods operate on a fixed-size vector representation of a sentence, categorized as sentence encoding-based approaches. Thus the matching complexity is O(1), i.e., independent of the sentence length. Word-byword similarity matrices are introduced to enhance interaction. To obtain the similarity matrix, Hu et al. (2014) (Arc-II) concatenate two words’ vectors (after convolution), Socher et al. (2011a) compute Euclidean distance, and Wan et al. (2015) apply tensor product. In this way, the complexity is of O(n2), where n is the length of a sentence; hence similarity matrices are difficult to scale and less efficient for large datasets.\nRecently, Rocktäschel et al. (2016) introduce several context-aware methods for sentence matching. They report that RNNs over a single chain of two sentences are more informative than separate RNNs; a static attention over the first sentence is also useful when modeling the second one. Such context-awareness interweaves the sentence modeling and matching steps. In some scenarios like sentence pair re-ranking (Yan et al., 2016), it is not feasible to pre-calculate the vector representations of sentences, so the matching complexity is ofO(n). Rocktäschel et al. (2016) further develop a word-by-word attention mechanism and obtain a higher accuracy with a complexity order ofO(n2)."

      "text" : "We follow the “Siamese” architecture (like most work in Section 2) and adopt a two-step strategy to classify the relation between two sentences. Concretely, our model comprises two parts: • A tree-based convolutional neural network\nmodels each individual sentence (Figure 1a). Notice that, the two sentences, premise and hypothesis, share a same TBCNN model (with same parameters), because this part aims to capture general semantics of sentences. • A matching layer combines two sentences’ in-\nformation by heuristics (Figure 1b). After individual sentence models, we design a sentence matching layer to aggregate information. We use simple heuristics, including concate-\nnation, element-wise product and difference, which are effective and efficient.\nFinally, we add a softmax layer for output. The training objective is cross-entropy loss, and we adopt mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, computed by back-propagation."

      "heading" : "3.1 Tree-Based Convolution",
      "text" : "The tree-based convolutoinal neural network (TBCNN) is first proposed in our previous work (Mou et al., 2016)2 to classify program source code; later, we further propose TBCNN variants to model sentences (Mou et al., 2015). This subsection details the tree-based convolution process.\nThe basic idea of TBCNN is to design a set of subtree feature detectors sliding over the parse tree of a sentence; either a constituency tree or a dependency tree applies. In this paper, we prefer the dependency tree-based convolution for its efficiency and compact expressiveness.\nConcretely, a sentence is first converted to a dependency parse tree.3 Each node in the dependency tree corresponds to a word in the sentence; an edge a→b indicates a is governed by b. Edges are labeled with grammatical relations (e.g., nsubj) between the parent node and its children (de Marneffe et al., 2006). Words are represented by pretrained vector representations, also known as word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013a).\n2Preprinted on arXiv on September 2014 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5718v1) 3Parsed by the Stanford parser (http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml)\nNow, we consider a set of two-layer subtree feature detectors sliding over the dependency tree. At a position where the parent node is p with child nodes c1, · · · , cn, the output of the feature detector, y, is\ny = f ( Wpp+\nn∑ i=1 Wr[ci]ci + b ) Let us assume word embeddings (p and ci) are of ne dimensions; that the convolutional layer y is nc-dimensional. W ∈ Rnc×ne is the weight matrix; b ∈ Rnc is the bias vector. r[ci] denotes the dependency relation between p and ci. f is the non-linear activation function, and we apply ReLU in our experiments.\nAfter tree-based convolution, we obtain a set of feature maps, which are one-one corresponding to original words in the sentence. Therefore, they may vary in size and length. A dynamic pooling layer is applied to aggregate information along different parts of the tree, serving as a way of semantic compositionality (Hu et al., 2014). We use the max pooling operation, which takes the maximum value in each dimension.\nThen we add a fully-connected hidden layer to further mix the information in a sentence. The obtained vector representation of a sentence is denoted as h (also called a sentence embedding). Notice that the same tree-based convolution applies to both the premise and hypothesis.\nTree-based convolution along with pooling enables structural features to reach the output layer with short propagation paths, as opposed to the recursive network (Socher et al., 2011b), which is also structure-sensitive but may suffer from the problem of long propagation path. By contrast, TBCNN is effective and efficient in learning such structural information (Mou et al., 2015)."

      "heading" : "3.2 Matching Heuristics",
      "text" : "In this part, we introduce how vector representations of individual sentences are combined to capture the relation between the premise and hypothesis. As the dataset is large, we prefer O(1) matching operations because of efficiency concerns. Concretely, we have three matching heuristics: • Concatenation of the two sentence vectors, • Element-wise product, and • Element-wise difference. The first heuristic follows the most standard procedure of the “Siamese” architectures, while the latter two are certain measures of “similarity” or\n“closeness.” These matching layers are further concatenated (Figure 1b), given by\nm = [h1;h2;h1 − h2;h1 ◦ h2]\nwhere h1 ∈ Rnc and h2 ∈ Rnc are the sentence vectors of the premise and hypothesis, respectively; “◦” denotes element-wise product; semicolons refer to column vector concatenation. m ∈ R4nc is the output of the matching layer.\nWe would like to point out that, with subsequent linear transformation, element-wise difference is a special case of concatenation. If we assume the subsequent transformation takes the form of W [h1 h2]>, where W = [W1 W2] is the weights for concatenated sentence representations, then element-wise difference can be viewed as such that W0(h1−h2) = [W0 −W0][h1 h2]>. (W0 is the weights corresponding to element-wise difference.) Thus, our third heuristic can be absorbed into the first one in terms of model capacity. However, as will be shown in the experiment, explicitly specifying this heuristic significantly improves the performance, indicating that optimization differs, despite the same model capacity. Moreover, word embedding studies show that linear offset of vectors can capture relationships between two words (Mikolov et al., 2013b), but it has not been exploited in sentence-pair relation recognition. Although element-wise distance is used to detect paraphrase in He et al. (2015), it mainly reflects “similarity” information. Our study verifies that vector offset is useful in capturing generic sentence relationships, akin to the word analogy task."

Word embeddings were pretrained ourselves by word2vec on the English Wikipedia corpus and fined tuned during training as a part of model parameters. We applied `2 penalty of 3×10−4; dropout was chosen by validation with a granularity of 0.1 (Figure 2). We see that a large dropout rate (≥ 0.3) hurts the performance (and also makes training slow) for such a large dataset as opposed to small datasets in other tasks (Peng et al., 2015). Initial learning rate was set to 1, and a power decay was applied. We used stochastic gradient descent with a batch size of 50."

This verifies the rationale for using tree-based convolution as the sentence-level neural model for NLI.\nTable 4 compares different heuristics of matching. We first analyze each heuristic separately: using element-wise product alone is significantly worse than concatenation or element-wise difference; the latter two are comparable to each other.\nCombining different matching heuristics improves the result: the TBCNN-pair model with concatenation, element-wise product and difference yields the highest performance of 82.1%. As analyzed in Section 3.2, the element-wise difference matching layer does not add to model complexity and can be absorbed as a special case into simple concatenation. However, explicitly using such heuristic yields an accuracy boost of 1–2%. Further applying element-wise product improves the accuracy by another 0.5%.\nThe full TBCNN-pair model outperforms all existing sentence encoding-based approaches, in-\ncluding a 1024d gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based RNN with “skip-thought” pretraining (Vendrov et al., 2015).

However, an efficient matching approach is still important, especially to retrieval-and-reranking systems (Yan et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016). For example, in a retrieval-based question-answering or conversation system, we can largely reduce response time by performing sentence matching based on precomputed candidates’ embeddings. By contrast, context-aware matching approaches as described in Section 2 involve processing each candidate given a new user-issued query, which is timeconsuming in terms of most industrial products.\nIn our experiments, the matching part (Figure 1b) counts 1.71% of the total time during prediction (single-CPU, C++ implementation), showing the potential applications of our approach in efficient retrieval of semantically related sentences."
