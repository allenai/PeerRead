The aim of the paper is to investigate the effect of removing stopwords on the SA task. The problem is that the stopwords lists generated before were on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) which is not the common language used in OSN. We have generated a stopword list of Egyptian dialect and a corpus-based list to be used with the OSN corpora. We compare the efficiency of text classification when using the generated lists along with previously generated lists of MSA and combining the Egyptian dialect list with the MSA list. The text classification was performed using Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers and two feature selection approaches, unigrams and bigram. The experiments show that the general lists containing the Egyptian dialects words give better performance than using lists of MSA stopwords only."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Sentiment Analysis is the computational study of people’s opinions, attitudes, and emotions towards topics covered by reviews or news [1]. SA is considered also a classification process which is the task of classifying text to represent a positive or negative sentiment [2-4]. The classification process is usually formulated as a two-class classification problem; positive and negative. Since it is a text classification problem, any existing supervised learning method can be applied, e.g., Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier.\nThe web has become a very important source of information recently as it becomes a readwrite platform. The dramatic increase of OSN, video sharing sites, online news, online reviews sites, online forums and blogs has made the user-generated content, in the form of unstructured free text gains a considerable attention due to its importance for many businesses. The web is used by many languages’ speakers. It is no longer used by English speakers only. The need of SA systems that can analyze OSN in other languages than English is compulsory.\nArabic is spoken by more than 300 million people, and is the fastest-growing language on the web (with an annual growth rate of 2,501.2% in the number of Internet users as of 2010, compared to 1,825.8% for Russian, 1,478.7% for Chinese and 301.4% for English) (http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm). Arabic is a Semitic language [5] and consists of many different regional dialects. However, these dialects are true native language forms which are used in informal daily communication and are not standardized or taught in schools [6]. Despite this fact but in reality the internet users especially on OSN sites and some of the blogs and reviews site as well, use their own dialect to express their feelings. The only formal written standard for Arabic is the MSA. It is commonly used in written media and education. There is a large degree of difference between MSA and most Arabic dialects as MSA is not actually the native language of any Arabic country [7].\nThere is lack of language resources of Arabic language and most of them are under development. In order to use Arabic language in SA, there are some text processing are needed like removing stopwords or Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. There are some sources of stopword lists and POS taggers are publicly available but they work on MSA not Arabic dialect. This paper tackles the first problem of removing stopwords. Stopwords are more\ntypical words used in many sentences and have no significant semantic relation to the context in which they exist.\nIn the literature, there are some research works have generated stopword lists but as far as our knowledge no one has generated a stopword list for Arabic dialects. In [8] they have proposed an algorithm for removing stopwords based on a finite state machine. They have used a previously generated stopword list on MSA. In [9] they have created a corpus-based list from newswire and query sets and a general list using the same corpus and then compare the effectiveness of these lists on the information retrieval systems. The lists are on MSA too. In [10] they have generated a stopword list of MSA from the highest frequent meaningless words appear in their corpus.\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of removing stopwords on SA for OSN Arabic data. Since the OSN sites and the reviews sites use the simple Egyptian dialect. The creation of a stopword list of Egyptian dialect is mandatory. The data are collected from OSN sites Facebook and Twitter [11-20] on Egyptian movies. We used an Arabic review site as well that allow users to write critics about the movies (https://www.elcinema.com). The used language by the users in the review is syntactically simple with many words of Egyptian dialects included. The data from OSN is characterized by being noisy and unstructured. Abbreviations and smiley faces are frequently used in OSN and sometimes in review site too. There is a need for many preprocessing and cleaning steps for this data to be prepared for SA. The Arabic users either write with Arabic or with franco-arab (writing Arabic words in English letters) e.g. the word “maloosh” which stands for “شولام” which means “doesn’t have”. This is an Egyptian dialect word which is written in MSA as “هل سيل”. Sometimes they use English word in the middle of an Arabic sentence which must be translated.\nWe are tackling the problem of classifying reviews and OSN data about movies into two classes, positive and negative as was first presented in [2] but on Arabic language. In their work they used unigram and bigram as Feature Selection (FS) techniques. It was shown that using unigrams as features in classification gives the highest accuracy with NB. We have used the same feature selection techniques, unigrams and bigram along with NB and Decision Tree (DT) as classifiers.\nWe have proposed a methodology for preparing corpora from OSN which consists of many steps of cleaning, converting Franc-arab to Arabic words and translation of English words that appear in the middle of Arabic sentences to Arabic. We have also proposed a methodology of generating stopword lists from the corpora. The methodology consists of three phases which are: calculating the words’ frequency of occurrence, check the validity of a word to be a stopword, and adding possible prefixes and suffixes to the words generated.\nThe contribution of this paper is as follows. First, we propose a methodology for preparing corpora from OSN sites in Arabic language. Second, we propose a methodology for creating a stopword list for Egyptian dialect to be suitable for OSN corpora. Third, we prepare corpus from Facebook which was not tackled in the literature for Arabic language. Fourth, tackling OSN data in Arabic language is new as it wasn’t investigated much. Fourth, tackling DT classifier with these kinds of corpora is new as it wasn’t investigated much in the literature. Finally, the measure of classifiers’ training time and considering it in the evaluation is new in this field.\nThe paper is organized as follows; section 2 presents the methodology. The stopword list generation is tackled in section 3. The Experimental setup and results are presented in section 4. A discussion of the results and analysis of corpora is presented in section 5. Section 6 presents the conclusion and future work."

      "heading" : "2. Methodology",
      "text" : "The aim of our study is to prepare data from Twitter, Facebook, and a review site on the same topic in Arabic language for SA. We have chosen a hot topic on the recently shown movies in the theatres for the last festival in first of August 2014. The movies were:”قرزلأا ليفلا” means “The blue elephant”; “رصم ىف عنص” means “Made in Egypt”; “ةتلاتلا ةيملاعلا برحلا” means “The third world war”; and “يريم ةزاوج” means “official marriage”. We have downloaded related tweets from twitter, comments from some movies’ Facebook pages, and users’ reviews from the review site elcinema.com.\nTweets were downloaded about the movies using the regular search of Twitter as many of the sites that retrieve tweets are closed like (searchHash, topsy). We have searched using the movies’ names and downloaded all the tweets that appear at the time of search. There were many unrelated tweets downloaded as some of the movies like “رصم ىف عنص” and “ برحلا ةتلاتلا ةيملاعلا” can hold other meanings than the movies’ title. The retrieved tweets are tweets that contain the whole words or any word either in the text or by hashtag.\nThe methodology we have used is very close to what was proposed in [21]. But there are\nsome discrepancies related to the nature of the Arabic language. We have also used the\nremoving stopwords only as a text processing technique due to lack of sources especially for\nArabic dialects."

Removing comments expressed by photos only reduced them to 1415. Removing comments that contain mentions to friends with no other words reduced them to 1296. Then, after removing non-Arabic comments, they were reduced to 1261.\nThe final number of tweets downloaded was 1787 tweets. After removing the tweets that contain URLs only or advertising links or some who put links to watch the movie only, they were reduced to 1069. Some were links to certain scenes or related videos on Youtube. After removing unrelated tweets as the search on twitter was just by the movies’ names which can imply other meanings, they were reduced to 862. Removing non-Arabic tweets reduced them to 781.\nThe number of reviews downloaded from the review sites was 32. The reviews needed only two steps of preparation as shown in Figure 1.\nAfter the preprocessing, cleaning and filtering of the data, they must be annotated to be fed to the supervised classifiers. The first Experiment shows the method of annotation and the number of positive and negative data."

      "text" : "After annotation, we have applied removing stopwords text processing technique on the three\ncorpora with different alternatives of stopwords list which are:\n-A general MSA list: this list contains a combination of three published lists. The first one is\na project that generated stopwords with all possible suffixes and prefixes. The other two were\npublished in (https://code.google.com/p/stop-words/source/browse/trunk/stop-words/stop-\nwords/stop-words-arabic.txt) and (http://www.ranks.nl/stopwords/arabic) respectively.\n-A generated corpus-based list: this list is generated from the most frequent words from the\ncorpora regardless of their nature.\n-A generated Egyptian-dialect list: this list is generated from the most frequent words in the\ncorpora that can be a stopword in addition to the Egyptian dialect stopwords that appeared in\nthe corpora.\n-A combination of the Egyptian dialect list and the MSA list.\nText classification is applied on the three corpora using two feature selection techniques and\ntwo classifiers as shown in Figure 2. We have used two well known supervised learning\nclassifiers; Naïve Bayes (NB) [22] and Decision tree (DT) [23] in testing. There are many\nother kinds of supervised classifiers in the literature [24]. The two chosen classifiers represent\ntwo different families of classifiers. NB is one of the probabilistic classifiers which are the\nsimplest and most commonly used classifier. DT on the other hand is a hierarchical\ndecomposition of data space and doesn’t depend on calculating probability. The test used two\ndifferent feature selection (FS) techniques. These are; unigrams (BOWs) which depend on\nword presence; and bigrams [2]."

      "heading" : "3. Stopword list Generation",
      "text" : "Stopwords are common words that generally do not contribute to the meaning of a sentence, specifically for the purposes of information retrieval and natural language processing. The common English words that don’t affect the meaning of a sentence are like “a”, “the”, “of”…. Removing stopwords will reduce the corpus size without losing important information. In some corpora specific words could not contribute in the meaning like the word “movie” in a movie reviews corpus but means something in news corpus. This word could be considered a stopword when analyzing the movie reviews corpus.\nThe common strategy for determining a stopword list is to calculate the frequency of appearance of each word in the document collection then to take the most frequent words. The selected terms are often hand-filtered for their semantic content relative to the domain of the documents being indexed, and marked as a stopword list.\nThe English stopword list is general and contains 127 words like (all, just, being,….). In order to generate the stopword list for Arabic which is a very rich lexical language; we have done this through many steps. First, we should specify some general conditions for the word to be a stopword:\n-They give no meaning if they are used alone.\n-They appear frequently in the text.\n-They are general words and not used specifically in a certain field.\nThe methodology of generating the stopword lists are shown in Figure 3. The methodology\nconsists of three phases as illustrated in the following subsections."

After combining them together and removing the duplicates, the list of all\nwords are 4818 words. Then we have calculated the frequency of occurrence of each word\nfrom the list of all words in the three corpora combined together."

These words\nare not all general and they are domain specific like the words “دهاشملا” or “مليفلا” which means\n(The spectator, the movie) respectively. This list contains words in MSA and Egyptian dialect\nas well.\nTo generate a general list of Egyptian dialect stopwords, we have taken the most frequent 200\nwords and remove the semantically recognized words which are likely to be nouns and verbs.\nThen, to generate a general list of Egyptian dialect, we have added every word in the corpora\nin Egyptian dialect on the most frequent words that are semantically meaningless. To validate\nif the word is a stopword or not; if the word is a MSA words we check its existence in the\nMSA stopword lists. If it doesn’t exist, we check its corresponding meaning in the English\nstopword list. If the word is in Egyptian dialect, we see its correspondence in the MSA list\nand if doesn’t exist we check its correspondent meaning in the English stopword list. For\nexample the word “سب”, its correspondence in MSA is “طقف” and it has a corresponding\nmeaning in the English stopword list too which is “only”. On the contrary, the word “مزلا”\nhas no correspondence in the MSA list which should be “دبلا” but it has a correspondent\nmeaning in the English list which is the word “should”. Therefore, it is considered a\nstopword. The final list of valid unique words contains 100 words."

For example the prefix “لا” which means\n“the” change the word from indefinite to definite. The suffix “مه” gives the meaning of\npronoun “them”. We have added some frequent used prefixes to the words generated in both\nlists which are (ل ،ف ،ب ،و ،لا). If necessary we give pronoun suffixes which are ( ،ه ،مه ،ان ،ي\nاه). We have added these suffixes to possession words in Egyptian dialect like the word\n“ىعاتب” which means (mine).\nThere is also some letters are written in different forms so we write any word that contains\nthese letters’ possible forms such as (ي ،ي), (ة ،ه), (إ ،أ ،ا). The last one is according to the\nword itself. The lists are manually revised for improper words or meaningless words.\nAfter adding the prefixes and suffixes, the final corpus-based list contains 1061 words and\ncan be found in (http://goo.gl/JW0jKP). The final general Egyptian dialect list contains 620\nwords and can be found in (http://goo.gl/263J5L)."

If the entropy of the probability distribution of label choices in the tree is greater than the entropy_cutoff, then the tree is refined further. But if the entropy is lower than the entropy_cutoff, then tree refinement is halted. Entropy is the uncertainty of the outcome. As entropy approaches 1.0, uncertainty increases and vice versa. Higher values of entropy_cutoff will decrease both accuracy and training time. It was set to ‘0.8’. -Depth cutoff: used during refinement to control the depth of the tree. The final decision tree will never be deeper than the depth_cutoff. Decreasing the depth_cutoff will decrease the training time and most likely decrease the accuracy as well. It was set to ‘5’. -Support cutoff: controls how many labeled feature sets are required to refine the tree. When the number of labeled feature sets is less than or equal to support_cutoff, refinement stops, at least for that section of the tree.

The accuracy is defined as: the ratio of number of correctly classified reviews, comment, and tweets to the total number of data.\nTable 2 contains the results of the various tests we have made. The accuracy of the reviews is relatively high as the number of reviews is small and the data is highly unbalanced. The accuracy decreases when using corpus-based list on the lexically rich reviews and the general lists including Egyptian dialects give better results than the others.

The number of positive reviews represents 78% of the whole data while the\nnumber of negative reviews represents 18% of the entire data. The data are obviously\nunbalanced since the movies were successful in this season, not many users’ reviews were\nnegative.\nThe number of neutral comments on Facebook represents 68% of the whole data. These are\nnot neutral opinions on the movie. People who write in OSN are not neutral at all. The neutral\ncomments are mainly objective sentences that don’t contain any sentiments. Many were just\ndebates between users. Some were expressing their personal feelings and some were using\nadjectives without specifying on whom or what. The number of positive comments represents\n29% of the entire data and the number of negative comments represents 2% of the whole data\nwhich is an extremely small percentage.

      "heading" : "5.2 Specializations of Arabic Language",
      "text" : "Words with the same meaning could be written in different correct ways like the words “حورنح ،حورنه”. They both give the future tense of the verb “حورن” which means “we will go”. As we can notice three words in English are just written in one word in Arabic and give the same meaning. The pronouns in English are expressed in Arabic by adding a prefix letter that modify the verb especially when it is used in the middle of the sentence like “حورن ،حورا” which means (I go, we go) respectively. Some prepositions and causal words are expressed in Arabic with one letter like the words “ىنلا ،ىنا” which means (I am, because I am) respectively.\nThe many forms that the Arabic words could take are very common characteristics of MSA which make the dealing with the language is complicated. For Arabic dialects, it is a tragedy. We have a special dialect for each Arab country and different dialects in the same country. For Egyptian dialect there are many words that have no resemblance in MSA like the word “شيفم” which means (there is not). It has only a correspondent in MSA which is “دجوي لا” which are complete different words. In the OSN corpora some other dialects appear like the Moroccan word “فازب” which means (too much) and the Syrian word “حيلم” which means (good). The number of other dialects in Facebook corpus represents 1% of the whole corpus which is very small percentage. The number of other dialects in Twitter corpus represents 0.5% of the whole corpus which is extremely small percentage. There were no other dialects in reviews. They used a mix between MSA words and Egyptian dialect words as they are user reviews not formal reviews from critics.\nThe other phenomenon of Arab users is using the Franco-arab. This means that people use English letters for writing Arabic words like the word “de7k” which stands for “كحض” which means (laugh). The number of Franco-arab comments in Facebook corpus represents 18% of the whole corpus which is not a big percentage. The number of Franco-arab tweets in Twitter corpus represents 3% of the whole corpus which is a small percentage. However, we have to unify the language used for the classifier to perform well. These are not even English words that have meanings so; they must be rewritten in Arabic letter. We have used the website (www.yamli.com). They give variations for each word that have to be chosen from. Sometimes the users don’t even write correct words in Franco-arab. In this case the site translates the letters only which give funny Arabic words. This transformation was manually revised.\n5.3Results Analysis\nFigure 4 shows that removing stopwords from reviews didn’t change the accuracy when using general lists but decrease the accuracy when using the corpus-based list. It also shows that that unigrams are better FS than bigrams with NB. The training time decreases after removing stopwords and the training time of DT is higher than NB as shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 6 shows that the accuracy of DT is much bigger than NB because the data is extremely unbalanced. There is no significant difference between unigrams and bigrams in DT but unigrams is better than bigrams with NB. Using corpus-based list increase the accuracy than using the general lists with NB but the accuracies are almost the same with DT. The training time decreases after removing stopwords and the training time of DT is higher than NB as shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 8 shows that NB and DT give very close accuracies as the data is not very unbalanced.\nUnigrams are better than bigrams in case of NB. Using different lists didn’t change the accuracy much but the general lists give good performance too. The training time decreases after removing stopwords and the training time of DT is higher than NB as shown in Figure 9.\nIn case of lexically rich corpus like the reviews, using the corpus-based list decrease the accuracy of classification which is similar to what [9] has found. But in case of OSN where they were not lexically rich the three lists wasn’t varying the accuracies much but still the general lists containing Egyptian dialect stopwords give better results than using MSA stopwords only.\nDecision Tree is a hierarchical decomposition of data space and doesn’t depend on calculating probability but Naïve Bayes depends on calculating probability for the whole data. Although NB usually gives higher accuracy than DT, but this was not the case when testing these corpora. This is due to the unbalance of the data as the positive class in these cases where much bigger than the negative class. NB calculates the probability on the whole data but DT is more specifically build hierarchy decomposition of data. That is why DT is better for unbalance data as it is more specific than NB. But still DT has longer processing time than NB because it builds the hierarchical decomposition on the whole data but the difference in time is not big as the data size was not so big. In NB tests, the accuracy is better when using unigram which is similar to what [2] has found. In DT tests, unigram and bigrams give nearly similar results."

      "text" : "In this paper, we have proposed a methodology for generating a stopword list from online social network (OSN) corpora. The methodology consists of three phases: calculating the words’ frequency of occurrence, check the validity of a word to be a stopword, and adding possible prefixes and suffixes to the words generated. We have generated a stopword list of Egyptian dialect and a corpus-based list to be used with the OSN corpora. We compare them with other lists. The lists used in the comparison are: previously generated lists of MSA, the corpus-based generated list, the general generated list of Egyptian dialect, and a combination of the Egyptian dialect list with the MSA list.\nWe have also proposed a methodology to prepare corpora in Arabic language from OSN and review site for Sentiment Analysis (SA) task. It includes the translation of English words that appear in text and the transformation of Franco-arab to Arabic words. The text classification\nwas performed using Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers and two feature selection approaches, unigrams and bigram.\nWe have selected the movie reviews topic to download data about movies from three different sources (Review site, Facebook, and Twitter). The data are extremely unbalanced as the movies were successful and most of the OSN users like it and the reviewers as well. The data contain many spams like advertising URLs, debates, and using of abbreviations and smiley faces. It needed many preprocessing and cleaning steps to be prepared for classification.\nApplying removing stopwords with multiple lists show that the corpus-based list negatively affects the accuracy of classification incase of reviews. Reviews are more lexically rich than OSN corpora. It also shows that the general lists containing the Egyptian dialects words give better performance than using lists of MSA stopwords only. The results of Decision tree classifier are better than Naïve Bayes classifier for these kinds of corpora. Using unigrams give better results than bigrams.\nIn the future we plan to try more text processing techniques on Arabic OSN data like POS tagging and try to fulfill the gap of using the Arabic dialect in the OSN data as all resources are designed for MSA. We could tackle other dialects other than Egyptian."

The paper also proposes a methodology for generating a stopword list from the prepared corpora. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effect of removing stopwords on the SA task. The problem is that the stopwords lists generated before were on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) which is not the common language used in OSN. We have generated a stopword list of Egyptian dialect and a corpus-based list to be used with the OSN corpora. We compare the efficiency of text classification when using the generated lists along with previously generated lists of MSA and combining the Egyptian dialect list with the MSA list. The text classification was performed using Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers and two feature selection approaches, unigrams and bigram. The experiments show that the general lists containing the Egyptian dialects words give better performance than using lists of MSA stopwords only.",
