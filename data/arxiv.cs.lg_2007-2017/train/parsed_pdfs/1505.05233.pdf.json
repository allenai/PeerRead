      "text" : "\nAbstract—Image/video data is usually represented by multiple visual features. Fusion of multi-sources information for establishing the identity has been widely recognized. Multi-feature visual recognition has recently received attention in multimedia applications. This paper studies visual understanding via a newly proposed -norm based multi-feature jointly sharing learning framework, which can simultaneously learn the global label matrix and explicit classifiers from the labeled visual data represented by multiple feature modalities. Additionally, a multi-modal group graph manifold regularizer formed by mixed Laplacian and Hessian graph is proposed for better preserving the manifold structure of different features on the labeled data, while preserving the label consistency and improving the label prediction power via semi-supervised learning. The merits of the proposed multi-feature learning framework lie in jointly sharing the structural information from multiple features in global classifier learning phase based on a mixed graph regularizer on one hand, and an efficient alternating optimization method for fast classifier training on the other hand. Experiments on several benchmark visual datasets, such as 17-category Oxford Flower dataset, the challenging 101-category Caltech dataset, YouTube & Consumer Videos dataset and large-scale NUS-WIDE dataset for multimedia understanding all demonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art algorithms.\nIndex Terms—Visual recognition, multimedia understanding, sharing learning, multi-feature learning, semi-supervised learning\nI. INTRODUCTION\nulti-modality, multiple views and multiple features are usually used to represent multimedia content and images. For example, given a face image or a video frame, its\nvisual content can be represented by several kinds of weak modalities such as left and right periocular, mouth and nose regions [4] for robust face recognition, or different feature types such as histogram, SIFT, HSV, etc. [9] for action recognition. It therefore becomes a challenging task in multimedia analysis for improving the visual classification performance by simultaneously sharing the structural information from multiple information sources of independent or correlated feature representations.\n L. Zhang is with the College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University and the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic\nUniversity, Hong Kong (e-mail: leizhang@cqu.edu.cn).\n D. Zhang is with the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong (e-mail: csdzhang@comp.polyu.edu.hk).\nIn early, information fusion can be done at three levels: feature level, score level and decision level, whereas feature level fusion can be more discriminative than other two level-fusions [16]. Feature concatenation is a prevalent fusion method which has been used in patter recognition [18], [19]. However, it is less effective in multimedia content analysis, especially when the features are independent or heterogeneous [17], and in particular, simple feature concatenation for high dimensional feature vectors may also become inefficient and non-robust. Therefore, multi-view learning and multiple kernel learning have been developed by researchers in machine learning community to address this problem. One popular work is the two-view based support vector machine (SVM-2k) [11], [21], [22], which jointly learns SVM with two views. Another popular work is multiple kernel learning (MKL) [10], [20], which focus on the information integration from multiple features by combining multiple kernels with respective weights. Besides, the concept of multi-modal joint learning was also involved in dictionary learning and sparse representation. Some representative works under the framework of dictionary learning such as [25], [26], [27], [28], [29] have been proposed for visual recognition including face, digit, action, and object recognition, which demonstrate that training more discriminative dictionaries and jointly learning visually correlated dictionaries can effectively improve the recognition performance of the reconstruction based classifier proposed in [24]. Also, several multi-modal joint sparse representation methods were developed for face and visual recognition applications. For examples, in [3], a multi-task joint sparse representation classifier (MTJSRC) was proposed for visual classification in which group sparsity was used to combine multiple features. In [4], a multimodal joint sparse representation and kernel space multimodal sparse model were proposed for robust face recognition. In [30], a joint dynamic sparse representation classifier model was proposed for object recognition. In [48], a very efficient multi-task feature selection model (FSSI) with information sharing in low-rank solution was proposed for multimedia analysis.\nThough these multi-task/multi-view based joint learning performs better than single modality, they depend on sufficient labeled data that may conflict with real-world applications. Therefore, we focus on a semi-supervised learning mechanism that can improve the robustness of learned classifier when label information of training samples is insufficient. It’s known that among semi-supervised learning methods, manifold regularization, specifically, Laplacian graph regularization\nVisual Understanding via Multi-Feature Jointly\nSharing Learning\nLei Zhang, Member, IEEE, and David Zhang, Fellow, IEEE\nM\nlearning becomes the main stream for well exploring the geometry of the intrinsic data. Although Laplacian graph achieves good performance, it has been identified to be biased towards a constant function due to its constant null space and the not well preserved local topology, especially when there are only few labeled data. Comparatively, Hessian regularization has better extrapolating power shown in two facets [5]: first, it has a richer null space and second, it can exploit the intrinsic local geometry of the data manifold very well. For better exploitation of multiple features in classifier learning, excited by spirits of these joint learning concepts discussed above, we consider a more intuitive manner, i.e. multi-feature global label consistency based classifier learning under a mixed Hessian and Laplacian regularization based semi-supervised framework. It’s worth noting that there is no explicit mapping matrix in manifold regression during testing process, therefore, in this work, we will simultaneously learn an explicit global classifier.\nMotivated by these above concerns, a multi-feature group graph regularizer by jointly learning mixed Laplacian and Hessian regularization is proposed for visual categorization. We uniformly name the proposed algorithm as multi-feature sharing based Global Label Consistent Classifier framework (GLCC). The merits of this paper are shown as follows.\n Multiple feature modalities are jointly learned with\neffective knowledge and feature structure sharing for robust visual classification.  To better preserve the manifold structure of training data,\na multi-modal group graph regularizer based on Hessian and Laplacian regularization is presented for label\nconsistency preservation.  Considering that there is no explicit classifier in manifold\nregression, an explicit classifier for global label prediction is simultaneously learned by minimizing the weighted least square loss with global label prediction.  In the proposed method, a -norm based global classifier\nsolved with a very efficient alternating optimization in low computational cost is presented. The overview of the proposed GLCC framework is illustrated in Fig.1. The visual experiments have been conducted on the benchmark visual datasets, including the Oxford flower 17 dataset 1 from [12], the Caltech 101 dataset 2\n1http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/index.html 2http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/MKL/\nfrom [14], the YouTube & Consumer video dataset 3 from [45], and the large scale real-world NUS-WIDE web image dataset 4 from [53] for multimedia analysis. All experiments demonstrate that our GLCC method outperforms many existing multi-feature and semi-supervised learning methods.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, we review the most related works in visual recognition and multi-view graph based learning. The proposed -norm based multi-feature global label consistent classifier framework including its formulation and training algorithm is described in section III. The experiments on several benchmark datasets for visual application are employed in Section IV. The convergence and computational time analysis is briefly discussed in section V. Section VI concludes this paper."

      "text" : "As discussed previously, this work is closely related to the efforts on visual recognition and multi-modal graph based learning. In this section, we will briefly review the current prevailing approaches.\n3 http://vc.sce.ntu.edu.sg/transfer learning domain adaptation/domain adaptation home.html 4http://lms.comp.nus.edu.sg/research/NUS-WIDE.html\nA. Visual Recognition\nA number of methods have been developed for visual recognition, such as face recognition, gender recognition, age estimation, scene categories and object recognition in computer vision community. The bag-of-features (BoF) model has been a popular image categorization, but it discards the spatial order of local descriptors which limits the descriptive power of the image representation. In [2], a spatial pyramid matching (SPM) beyond bags of features was proposed for natural scene categories and object recognition. Yang et al. [40] also proposed a linear SPM based on sparse coding (ScSPM) for visual classification and obtained significant improvement. In [1], Gehler et al described several feature combination methods including average kernel support vector machine (AK-SVM), product kernel support vector machine (PK-SVM), multiple kernel learning (MKL) [23], [37], [38], column generation boosting (CG-Boost) [13], and linear programming boosting (LP-B and LP-β) [15] for object recognition. However, the common flaw of these methods is their large computational cost. Recently, Yuan et al. [3] proposed a multi-task joint sparse representation (MTJSRC) using mixed-norm for visual\nclassification, and obtained better performance by comparing with several sparse dictionary learning methods [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Zhang et al. [30] proposed a multi-observation joint dynamic sparse representation for visual recognition, and obtain comparable performance. All these works demonstrate that multi-feature joint learning has a positive effect on robust classifier learning for visual understanding."

      "text" : "Semi-supervised learning has been widely deployed in the recognition task, due to the fact that training a small amount of labeled data is prone to overfitting, while manual labeling of a large amount of precisely labeled data is tedious and time-consuming. Most related to the paper, a subspace sharing based semi-supervised multiple feature analysis method for action recognition was proposed [8], in which both the global and local structural consistency has been considered in discriminative classifier training. Zhou et al. [31] proposed a graph based semi-supervised method (LGC) for learning local and global consistency by a regularization framework. In [7], a Laplacian graph manifold based semi-supervised learning was proposed, in which a manifold assumption that the manifold structure information of the unlabeled data can be preserved was given. The assumption of consistency means that the nearby points are likely to have the same label and the points on the same cluster/manifold are likely to have the same label. Note that cluster assumption is local while manifold assumption is global. In [51], a semi-supervised feature selection algorithm SFSS for multimedia analysis based on Laplacian graph and l2,1-norm regularization was proposed. Graph manifold based algorithms make use only of the nearest neighbor information to classify the unlabeled data. Laplacian eighenmap based manifold learning was usually proposed for dimension reduction and graph embedding [6], [32], [33], [34], but all of them were implemented in single view/modality. In [36], a graph Laplacian based multi-view spectral embedding\n(MSE) method was proposed for dimension reduction. Recently, Yang et al. [9] proposed a multi-feature Laplacian graph based hierarchical semi-supervised regression (MLHR) for multimedia analysis and achieved better performance in video concept annotation. Throughout these manifold based methods presented above, Laplacian graph and single feature are the mainstream of semi-supervised learning, however, it has been identified in [5] that it suffers from the fact that the solution is biased towards a constant with weaker extrapolating power. Hessian graph exploited for semi-supervised dimension reduction [5] was proved to have a good extrapolating power. Therefore, this paper further explores a multi-feature joint learning framework into which Hessian regularization is incorporated for global label consistent classifier learning."

      "text" : "Semi-supervised learning approach holds the assumption\nthat nearby points are more likely to have the same labels. In graph based manifold learning, label consistency is embedded in data manifold structure. Inspired by [8], [35], [41], [42], [43], the multi-feature GLCC is generally formulated as follows.\n(1)\nwhere γ and λ are positive trade-off parameters, is a full one vector, F is the global prediction, is a loss function, and is a graph manifold preservation term.\nFor convenient analysis, let , the objective function of graph based manifold regression model can then be written as\n(2)\nwhere denotes the least square loss function used in this work, is a regularization parameter ( ), and\ndenotes the adjacency matrix defined as\n(3)\nwhere denotes the local set represented by k-nearest\nneighbors of xj.\nThe least square loss term of (2) is considered as a weighted\nloss function here, which can be written as\n(4)\nwhere denotes trace operator, and W is a diagonal matrix with entries Wii defined as follows: for semi-supervised use, Wii is set as a large value (e.g. 10 10 ) if the i-th sample is labeled, and 0 otherwise.\nThe second term of (2) is a manifold structure preservation term for exploring label consistency. Specifically, Laplacian graph is used in part to preserve the label information in the manifold built on the training data. It can be written in trace-form as\n(5)\nwhere is a diagonal matrix with entries , and\nis Laplacian graph matrix. As denoted in [5], the graph Laplacian based semi-supervised regression suffers from the fact that the solution is biased towards a constant and the extrapolating power is lost, and further proposed a second-order Hessian energy regularizer that shows a better extrapolation capability than Laplacian regularizer in semi-supervised learning, particularly if only few labeled points are available. Specifically, the total estimated Hessian energy is shown by\n(6)\nwhere is the Hessian energy matrix which is sparse since each data point has only contributions from its neighbors. The\ndetails of Hessian energy estimation and the computation of Hessian energy matrix are shown in Appendix A. Therefore, for exploiting the advantages of both regularizers, the manifold regression model with group graph regularizers can be represented as\n(7)\nwhere in terms of (2) and (4) can be rewritten as\n(8)\nHowever, the representation of in (8) is in single feature. In this paper, a multi-modal concept is studied. Therefore, in multi-modal learning tasks, the objective function\nconstructed with m modalities is rewritten as\n(9)\nwhere\ndenote the contribution\ncoefficients of Laplacian matrix and Hessian energy\nmatrix for the i-th feature modality,\n.\nIn this paper, we let denotes the group graph regularizer. Note that the setting of r>1 is to better exploit the complementary information of multiple modalities and avoid that case with only the best feature\nconsidered, therefore we use and instead of and . In graph based manifold regularization model (7), we observe that there is no explicit classifier to predict the label matrix F. We therefore propose to simultaneously learn the global label matrix F by multi-feature based global classifiers\nand , as formulated as (1).\nSuppose\nto be the training set with n\nsamples of the i-th feature, a multi-feature sharing based global classifier can be shown as\n(10)\nwhere 1n denotes a column vector with all ones, denotes the balance parameter (0< <1), and controls classifier complexity to avoid overfitting.\nBy combining the group graph based manifold regression model (9) and the multi-feature global classifier (10), a novel global label consistent classifier framework is formulated. In summary, the GLCC framework as shown in (1) can be specifically rewritten as follows\n(11)\nThe first term denotes the explicitly multi-modal global label prediction, the second term is to control the classifier complexity and avoid overfitting in multi-feature learning phase, the third term is a weighted least square loss function and the final term is the multi-modal group graph manifold\nregularizer for preserving the label consistency and similarity\nof labeled data. Parameters and\ndenote the weights of the\ni th feature, and r>1 denotes that it can make full use of the information of each feature, otherwise, only the best feature is selected by our method (e.g. αi=1, βj=1), such that the complementary structure information of different feature modalities cannot be exploited [36]."

The results of three cases are shown in Table VI with the mean average precision (MAP) as evaluation metric.\nFirst, we compare our GLCC method with SVMs, MKL,\nadaptive SVM (A-SVM) [46], and FR [47] methods as baseline. Note that SVM-AT denotes that the labeled training samples are from two domains (i.e. the auxiliary domain and the target domain), while SVM-T denotes that the labeled training samples are only from the target domain. From Table IV we observe that the proposed method achieves the highest MAP of\n44.92% which outperforms the state-of-the-art MKL in average as baseline. It’s worth noting that the state-of-the-art domain adaptation method reported in [45] for this dataset are not compared because our method does not belong to such transfer learning framework, and only exploit the data for research.\nSecond, FSNM, FSSI, SFSS, and MLHR are tested on this data for video event recognition. We can see that MLHR obtains the second better result 43.68% which is 1.24% lower than GLCC in average. From the numeric results of MAP in three cases (a-c) shown by GLCC, it is clear that SIFT features (case (a)) is much better than ST features (case (b)), and the multi-feature learning integrated by SIFT and ST features together (case (c)) shows comparative results as well as case (a). As can be seen from case (c), the multi-feature learning methods FSSI, MLHR and GLCC show significant higher precision than single-feature based learning, which clearly demonstrate the importance of multi-feature joint learning for robust classifier. The computational time shown in Table I V demonstrates the comparative efficiency of our GLCC.\nThe performance variation with increasing percentage of labeled training samples is described in Fig.5-(c). Generally, our method outperforms other related algorithms, except for the cases of 10% and 50% where GLCC is a litter lower than FSSI."

The learned weights of Laplacian and Hessian graphs for each feature in different datasets are provided in Table VI. It can be noted that on a particular dataset, different features have varying importance. However, the learned weights based on Laplacian graph are close to the average value (1/m, where m is the number of features), that is, for flower data the weight is around 0.14, for caltech and video data the weight is around 0.25, and for NUS-WIDE data the weight is close to 0.33. Instead, the divergence of the weights from Hessian graph is more distinguishable that automatically selects the optimal weight for each feature. Thus, the results show that in multi-feature joint learning, Hessian graph will be more flexible in trade-off among the features for pursuit of better recognition performance.\nTABLE VI LEARNED WEIGHTS OF LAPLACIAN AND HESSIAN GRAPHS FOR FOUR DATASETS\nDataset Flower 17 data Caltech 101 data YouTube&Consumer video data Large scale NUS-WIDE data\nFeature HOG HSV Sift\nInt\nSift Bdy Color Shape Texture Phow Color Phow Gray SSIM GB SIFT (l=0) SIFT (l=1) STIP (l=0) STIP (l=1)\nEDH CORR WT\nα 0.14 0.14 0.15 0.14 0.14 0.15 0.14 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.26 0.26 0.24 0.24 0.32 0.34 0.34 β 0.14 0.16 0.12 0.10 0.16 0.14 0.18 0.24 0.25 0.25 0.26 0.01 0.15 0.25 0.59 0.31 0.39 0.30"

      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a global label consistent classifier that exploits multiple feature matrices representing visual data and a joint learning for object recognition and video event recognition, respectively. First, the proposed GLCC can make full consideration of the multi-view features for better recognition performance, which is different from the simple feature concatenation that is non-robust and the structural information from different views cannot be and exploited and shared in classifier learning. Second, inspired by the semi-supervised manifold regression, a group graph manifold regularizer coupled with Laplacian and Hessian energy of multiple views on the labeled data is presented in GLCC. It holds an assumption that the label prediction for each view is consistent with the global prediction based on multiple views. Third, a -norm based global classifier with an alternating optimization method is solved. Finally, the framework has been exploited on various datasets for visual annotation. Comparisons with state of the arts demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in recognition performance and efficient in computation.\nThis paper proposes a multi-feature sharing based global classifier by exploiting a joint learning framework. In the future work, active learning and selection of the most useful feature modality without manual adjustment is an interesting topic in large scale multimedia applications."

    "abstractText" : "Image/video data is usually represented by multiple visual features. Fusion of multi-sources information for establishing the identity has been widely recognized. Multi-feature visual recognition has recently received attention in multimedia applications. This paper studies visual understanding via a newly proposed -norm based multi-feature jointly sharing learning framework, which can simultaneously learn the global label matrix and explicit classifiers from the labeled visual data represented by multiple feature modalities. Additionally, a multi-modal group graph manifold regularizer formed by mixed Laplacian and Hessian graph is proposed for better preserving the manifold structure of different features on the labeled data, while preserving the label consistency and improving the label prediction power via semi-supervised learning. The merits of the proposed multi-feature learning framework lie in jointly sharing the structural information from multiple features in global classifier learning phase based on a mixed graph regularizer on one hand, and an efficient alternating optimization method for fast classifier training on the other hand. Experiments on several benchmark visual datasets, such as 17-category Oxford Flower dataset, the challenging 101-category Caltech dataset, YouTube & Consumer Videos dataset and large-scale NUS-WIDE dataset for multimedia understanding all demonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art algorithms.",
