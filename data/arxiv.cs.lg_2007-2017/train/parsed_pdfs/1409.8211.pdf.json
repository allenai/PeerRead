However, original sequence data are often of real-valued multivariate nature, i.e. are not univariate and discrete as required by typical k-mer based sequence kernel functions.\nIn this work, we consider the problem of the multivariate sequence classification (e.g., classification of multivariate music sequences, or multidimensional protein sequence representations). To this end, we extend univariate kernel functions typically used in sequence domains and propose efficient multivariate similarity kernel method (MVDFQ-SK) based on (1) a direct feature quantization (DFQ) of each sequence dimension in the original real-valued multivariate sequences and (2) applying novel multivariate discrete kernel measures on these multivariate discrete DFQ sequence representations to more accurately capture similarity relationships among sequences and improve classification performance.\nExperiments using the proposed MVDFQ-SK kernel method show excellent classification performance on three challenging music classification tasks as well as protein sequence classification with significant 25-40% improvements over univariate kernel methods and existing state-of-the-art sequence classification methods.

For instance, given a set of positive training instances C+ and a set of negative training instances C−, the SVM [32] learns a classification function of the following form\nf(X) = ∑\nY +∈C+\nα +\nY +K(X,Y\n+ )− ∑\nY −∈C−\nα −\nY −K(X,Y\n− )\n(1) Typical k-mer-based kernel functions (e.g., mismatch or spectrum kernels, gapped and wildcard kernel functions [17, 22]) essentially rely on symbolic Hamming-distance based matching of one-dimensional (1D) k-mers (k-long substrings) in the input sequences. For example, given one-dimensional (1D) sequences X and Y over alphabet Σ (e.g., amino acid sequences with |Σ|=20), the spectrum-k kernel [18] and the mismatch-(k,m) kernel [19] measure similarity between sequences as\nK(X,Y |k,m) = 〈Φk,m(X),Φk,m(Y )〉 = ∑ γ∈Σk Φk,m(γ|X)Φk,m(γ|Y )\n= ∑ γ∈Σk (∑ α∈X Im(α, γ) )∑ β∈Y Im(β, γ)  = ∑ α∈X ∑ β∈Y ∑ γ∈Σk Im(α, γ)Im(β, γ) (2)\nwhere\nΦk,m(γ|X) = (∑ α∈X Im(α, γ) ) (3)\nis the number of occurrences (possibly with up to m mismatches) of the k-mer γ in X, and the matching/indicator function Im(α, γ) = 1 if α is in the mutational neighborhood Nk,m(γ) of γ, i.e. α and γ are at the Hamming distance of at most m. This kernel (Eq. 2) essentially amounts to a cumulative Hamming-distance based pairwise comparison of\nar X\niv :1\n40 9.\n82 11\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n3 0\nSe p\n20 14\nall k-mers α and β contained in sequences X and Y , respectively, with maximum number of mismatches m. The level of similarity of each pair of substrings (α, β) here is indicated by the number of identical substrings in the mutational neighborhoods Nk,m(α) and Nk,m(β) of α and β,∑ γ∈Σk Im(α, γ)Im(β, γ) (Eq. 2). For the spectrum kernel (m=0), this similarity level is simply the exact matching of α and β.\nOn the other hand, in many practical applications input sequences are multivariate, i.e. input data is in the form of sequences of R-dimensional real-valued feature vectors, as opposed to one-dimensional discrete strings. This is the case, for instance, in commonly used MFCC representations for music data as series of 13-dimensional MFCC feature vectors (e.g., [31, 20, 16]) extracted from short time segments, or 20-dimensional profile representations of protein sequences as series of probabilistic amino acid substitution vectors in biological sequence analysis [11, 8].\nSuch original, multivariate real-valued feature sequences are typically transformed into univariate sequences in order to apply a univariate string kernel method such as spectrum or mismatch, e.g., [23, 37, 14, 12]. For example, this transformation is frequently accomplished by applying a vector quantization (VQ) algorithm to feature vectors thus transforming a multivariate R-dim real-valued sequence into a discrete univariate codeword sequence.\nIn contrast, in this work we consider an alternative approach to real-valued multivariate sequence classification which directly exploits these richer multivariate (R-dimensional) sequences (e.g., MFCC feature sequences for music, or sequences of physico-chemical amino acid descriptors for proteins). In this approach, the R-dimensional multivariate sequences are considered as R×|X| feature - spatio/temporal matrices with rows corresponding to feature dimensions and columns corresponding to temporal or spatial coordinates. Using these representations, we propose an efficient discrete multivariate kernel method (MVDFQ-SK) based on (1) a direct feature quantization (DFQ) (Sec. 3.1) of the original multivariate sequence, and (2) novel manifold-based discrete multivariate kernel functions applied to these discrete DFQ representations (Sec. 3.2, 3.3). The developed approach is applicable to a wide range of sequence domains, both discrete- and real- valued, such as music, images, or biological sequences.\nExperiments using the new multivariate direct feature quantization kernels (MVDFQ-SK) kernels on music genre and artist recognition, as well as protein sequence classification tasks show excellent predictive performance (Sec. 4) with significant 25%-40% improvements in predictive accuracy over univariate kernel functions and a number of other stateof-the-art sequence classification methods."

      "text" : "Recently, a large variety of methods have been proposed to solve the sequence classification problem, including generative, such as HMMs, or discriminative approaches. Among the discriminative approaches, string kernel-based [32, 27] methods provide some of the most accurate results [11, 19, 29, 17, 14, 5, 23, 38] in many sequence analysis tasks.\nIn the kernel-based approaches, the similarity between sequences X and Y is frequently computed based on the cooccurrence of string features (e.g., k-mers), as in spectrum kernels [18] or substring kernels [34]. Inexact comparison\nof the sequences in this framework is typically achieved using different families of mismatch [19] or profile [11] kernels. Both spectrum-k and mismatch-(k,m) kernels directly extract string features (k-mers) from the observed sequence, X. On the other hand, the profile kernel, proposed by Kuang et al. in [11], first builds a 20 × |X|-dim profile [8] PX and then derives a similar |Σ|k-dimensional representation from PX . Such profile representations have been shown to perform well in protein sequence analysis [11, 24]. Constructing the profile for each sequence may not be practical in some application domains, since the size of the profile is dependent on the size of the alphabet set, as well as the difficulty of defining a general sequence similarity search algorithm (e.g., as PSI-BLAST) for non-biological sequence domains. While for bio-sequences |Σ| = 4 or 20, for music or text classification |Σ| can potentially be very large, on the order of tens of thousands of symbols.\nThe existing string kernel methods essentially amount to the analysis of univariate (i.e. one-dimensional) sequences over finite alphabets Σ with one-dimensional k-mers as basic sequence features. However, original input sequences are often in the form of sequences of feature vectors, i.e. each input sequence X is a sequence of identically sized (R-dim) feature vectors which could be considered as a R×|X| feature matrix.\nExamples of these multivariate feature sequences include\n• Music data. A music sequence X in the commonly used MFCC feature representation [16, 20] is a sequence of 13-dimensional MFCC feature vectors, i.e. a multivariate sequence of size 13× |X|. • Image data. An image can be considered as a multi-\nvariate sequence of feature vectors extracted from image patches (e.g., as in [23]);\n• Biological data. Protein sequences can be viewed as profiles [11], or as multivariate sequences of R-dim feature vectors describing physical/chemical properties of individual amino acids [30].\nWhile typical string kernel methods essentially use symbolic Hamming distance-based matching (as in Eq. 2), recent work in [13] introduced the so-called generalized similarity (non-Hamming) kernels that allow to incorporate general similarity metrics S(·, ·) into similarity evaluation and improve performance compared to symbolic Hamming distancebased matching [13]. In particular, most related to the current work, are the distance-preserving symbolic embedding kernels [13] which use similarity hashing [35] to obtain binary representations for sequences such that Hamming distance h(·, ·) between these binary representations is proportional to the original similarity score S(·, ·) [13]. In contrast, the direct feature quantization (DFQ) method proposed in this work results in more accurate non-binary representations that are simpler as they do not require Hamming embedding learning step as in [13], and display higher accuracy (see Experiments, Sec. 4) compared to the binary Hamming-based distance-preserving embedding.\nRelated methods for the time series classification have also been introduced and include a large variety of methods, e.g., kernels on dynamical systems [33], or alignment-based methods [6, 28] with a quadratic time complexity. We will compare in the experiments with a number of these methods for time series.\nIn this work, in contrast to kernel methods on univariate string representations, we aim at methods that directly exploit multivariate sequence representations to improve accuracy and propose a family of efficient, linear-time discrete multivariate similarity kernels (MVDFQ-SK, MVDFQM-SK) using direct feature quantization (DFQ) and manifold kernel embedding (Sec. 3.1, 3.3). We show empirically (Sec. 4) that proposed MVDFQ/MVDFQM kernels and manifold embedding (Sec. 3.3) provide effective improvements in practice over traditional univariate (1D) VQ-based sequence kernels, binary similarity-preserving embedding kernels [13], as well as other state-of-the-art sequence classification methods for a number of challenging classification problems."

Then a multivariate input sequence X, a sequence of n = |X| identically sized (realvalued) R-dimensional feature vectors,\nX = (x1, x2, . . . , xn), xi ∈ RR ∀i\nis encoded as a univariate (1D) discrete sequence c(X) of codebook IDs\nc(x) = (c1, c2, . . . , cn), ci ∈ {1 . . .

The resulting codeword sequence c(x) is essentially a discrete sequence\nover finite alphabet Σ = {1, . . . , D}. Univariate (1D) string kernels can then be used for classification with SVM.\nIn contrast to these commonly employed codebook-based univariate representations, in this work we consider an alternative multivariate direct quantization which preserves feature information for each dimension with the manifold embedding representations (MVDFQ/MVDFQM) of the original multivariate (continuous-valued) sequences.\nIn the following, we first describe the direct feature quantization (DFQ) representations (Sec. 3.1) and contrast them with vector quantization / codebook based representations. We then define a novel family of kernels on these multivariate DFQ representations (Sec. 3.2)."

In this approach, each jth feature f j , j = 1 . . . R is quantized by dividing its range (f jmin, f j max) into the finite number of intervals, B. In the simplest case, the intervals can be defined, for instance, using a uniform quantization with a pre-specified number of bins B, where the entire feature data range is divided into B equal intervals of length δ = (fmax − fmin)/B and the index of the quantized feature value Q(f) = b(f − fmin)/δc is used to represent the feature value f .\nPartitioning of the feature data range could also be obtained by using 1D clustering, e.g., k-means, to adaptively choose dicretization levels and the number of bins for each dimension. Discretization levels also can be chosen using, for example, Gaussian distribution assumption (see, e.g., [21]) as breakpoints under Gaussian curve producing equal-sized areas.\nVarying the number of quantization levels B will result in more accurate (larger B) or more coarse (smaller B) representation of the original real-valued data. Here we choose appropriate number of quantization levels B using a small scale cross-validation experiments on the subset of the training data.\nFigure 2 shows an example of a DFQ representation for the 3-dimensional time series X (R=3) where the 3-dimensional DFQ representation has been obtained using a uniform binning (B=64) along each of the three data dimensions. As can be seen from the figure, compared to the vector quantization approach, the DFQ retains feature values along each dimension, thus providing a more accurate description of the original real-valued sequence.\nWe will show in the experiments that using DFQ multivariate representations and MVDFQ kernels described below can significantly (by 25-40%) improve predictive accuracy compared to traditional 1D (univariate) kernel representations as well as other state-of-the-art approaches (Sec. 4)."

For instance, using the MVDFQ-SK string kernel with uniform direct feature quantization (MFCC only) reduces the error rate to 16.7% compared to that of 19.6% when using VQ with the univariate kernel.\nAs also can be seen from the Table 5, obtained error rates (16-17%) for ISMIR genre recognition compare well with a number of previous best results, including the recent nonnegative matrix factorization method [9](16.5% error), or complex auditory model and cortical representation of [25] (19% error)."

      "heading" : "4.6 Artist recognition",
      "text" : "We also illustrate the utility of our multivariate MVDFQSK kernels and representations on the multi-class artist identification problem using the standard artist20 dataset with 20 artists, 6 albums each (1413 tracks total). Table 6 lists results for the 6-fold album-wise cross-validation with one album per artist held out for testing. Using multivariate MVDFQ-SK kernels with the direct uniform quantization of MFCC features yields a much lower 25.7% error compared to the best error rate for 42.9% for univariate kernels (a 40% relative improvement in error)."

      "heading" : "4.7 Protein remote homology detection",
      "text" : "In Table 7, we compare our proposed multivariate DFQ string kernel method (using 20-dim BLOSUM rows as feature vectors for individual amino acids, i.e. 20× |X| multivariate sequences) with a number of state-of-the-art kernel methods for the remote homology detection including spectrum/mismatch kernels [19, 18], spatial sample kernels [14], similarity hashing kernels [13], as well as recently proposed spectrum-RBF and mismatch-RBF methods [30] which also incorporate physico-chemical descriptors.\nAs can be seen from results in Table 7, multivariate DFQ string kernel (MVDFQ) provides effective improvements over other methods. For instance, using MVDFQ spectrum and mismatch kernels with BLOSUM substitution profiles sig-\nnificantly improves average ROC50 scores from 27.91 and 41.92 to 43.29 and 49.17, respectively (relative improvements of 50% and 17%), compared to traditional univariate spectrum/mismatch approaches."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4.8 Running time",
      "text" : "In Table 8, we compare the classification performance and the running time of our method to the recent binary Hamming embedding (similarity hashing) [13], and vector quantization-based univariate kernels. We vary the dimensionality of the embedding space E, the codebook size, and the number of discretization bins B, respectively. We note that for mismatch-(k,m) kernel computation we use the linear time sufficient-statistic based algorithm from [12]) and for all other methods we use their existing state-of-the-art implementations.\nAs can be seen from Table 8, multivariate kernels with the direct feature quantization (MVDFQ) display a better performance compared to the similarity hashing [13] and traditional univariate kernels."
    }, {
      "heading" : "5. CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "We presented novel discrete multivariate direct feature quantization kernel methods (MVDFQ-SK and MVDFQSK with the manifold embedding) for data in the form of sequences of feature vectors (as in music MFCC sequences, biological sequence profiles, or image sequences). The proposed approach directly exploits original multivariate feature sequences to improve sequence classification as opposed to using univariate codeword sequences. On three music classification tasks as well as protein sequence classification this shows significant 25-40% improvements compared to the traditional codebook learning and state-of-the-art sequence classification methods."

    "abstractText" : "Kernel-based approaches for sequence classification have been successfully applied to a variety of domains, including the text categorization, image classification, speech analysis, biological sequence analysis, time series and music classification, where they show some of the most accurate results. Typical kernel functions for sequences in these domains (e.g., bag-of-words, mismatch, or subsequence kernels) are restricted to discrete univariate (i.e. one-dimensional) string data, such as sequences of words in the text analysis, codeword sequences in the image analysis, or nucleotide or amino acid sequences in the DNA and protein sequence analysis. However, original sequence data are often of real-valued multivariate nature, i.e. are not univariate and discrete as required by typical k-mer based sequence kernel functions. In this work, we consider the problem of the multivariate sequence classification (e.g., classification of multivariate music sequences, or multidimensional protein sequence representations). To this end, we extend univariate kernel functions typically used in sequence domains and propose efficient multivariate similarity kernel method (MVDFQ-SK) based on (1) a direct feature quantization (DFQ) of each sequence dimension in the original real-valued multivariate sequences and (2) applying novel multivariate discrete kernel measures on these multivariate discrete DFQ sequence representations to more accurately capture similarity relationships among sequences and improve classification performance. Experiments using the proposed MVDFQ-SK kernel method show excellent classification performance on three challenging music classification tasks as well as protein sequence classification with significant 25-40% improvements over univariate kernel methods and existing state-of-the-art sequence classification methods.",
