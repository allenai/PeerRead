In this paper, we present a detailed asymptotic analysis of model consistency of the Lasso. For various decays of the regularization parameter, we compute asymptotic equivalents of the probability of correct model selection (i.e., variable selection). For a specific rate decay, we show that the Lasso selects all the variables that should enter the model with probability tending to one exponentially fast, while it selects all other variables with strictly positive probability. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso for several bootstrapped replications of a given sample, then intersecting the supports of the Lasso bootstrap estimates leads to consistent model selection. This novel variable selection algorithm, referred to as the Bolasso, is compared favorably to other linear regression methods on synthetic data and datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Apr 2008 15:40:03 GMT  (89kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1302v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "authors": ["francis r bach"], "accepted": true, "id": "0804.1302"}
