      "text" : "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are models that learn nonlinear relationships between sequences of inputs and outputs. Applications include speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013), image generation (Gregor et al., 2015), machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014) and image captioning (Vinyals et al., 2015; Karpathy & Fei-Fei, 2015). Training large RNNs can be difficult due to exploding and vanishing gradients (Hochreiter, 1991; Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al., 2013). Researchers have therefore developed gradient-stabilizing architectures such as Long Short-Term Memories or LSTMs\n(Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Units or GRUs (Cho et al., 2014).\nUnfortunately, LSTMs and GRUs are complicated and contain many components whose roles are not well understood. Extensive searches (Bayer et al., 2009; Jozefowicz et al., 2015; Greff et al., 2015) have not yielded significant improvements. This paper takes a fresh approach inspired by dimensional analysis and functional programming.\nIntuition from dimensional analysis. Nodes in neural networks are devices that, by computing dot products, measure the similarity of their inputs to representations encoded in weight matrices. Ideally, the representation learned by a net should “carve nature at its joints”. An exemplar is the system of measurement that has been carved out of nature by physicists. It prescribes units for expressing the readouts of standardized measuring devices (e.g. kelvin for thermometers and seconds for clocks) and rules for combining them.\nA fundamental rule is the principle of dimensional homogeneity, which states that it is only meaningful to add quantities expressed in the same units (Bridgman, 1922; Hart, 1995). For example adding seconds to volts is inadmissible. In this paper, we propose to take the measurements performed by neural networks as seriously as physicists take their measurements, and apply the principle of dimensional homogeneity to the representations learned by neural nets, see section 2.\nIntuition from functional programming. Whereas feedforward nets learn to approximate functions, recurrent nets learn to approximate programs – suggesting lessons from language design are relevant to RNN design. Language researchers stress the benefits of constraints: eliminating GOTO (Dijkstra, 1968); introducing type-systems that prescribe the interfaces between parts of computer programs and guarantee their consistency (Pierce, 2002); and working with stateless (pure) functions.\nFor our purposes, types correspond to units as above. Let\nus therefore discuss the role of states. The reason for recurrent connections is precisely to introduce state-dependence. Unfortunately, state-dependent functions have side-effects – unintended knock-on effects such as exploding gradients.\nState-dependence without side-effects is not possible. The architectures proposed below encapsulate states in firmware (which has no learned parameters) so that the learnware (which encapsulates the parameters) is stateless. It follows that the learned features and gradients in strongly-typed architectures are better behaved and more interpretable than their classical counterparts, see section 3.\nStrictly speaking, the ideas from physics (to do with units) and functional programming (to do with states) are logically independent. However, we found that they complemented each other. We refer to architectures as stronglytyped when they both (i) preserve the type structure of their features and (ii) separate learned parameters from statedependence.\nOverview. The core of the paper is section 2, which introduces strongly-typed linear algebra. As partial motivation, we show how types are implicit in principal component analysis and feedforward networks. A careful analysis of the update equations in vanilla RNNs identifies a flaw in classical RNN designs that leads to incoherent features. Fixing the problem requires new update equations that preserve the type-structure of the features.\nSection 3 presents strongly-typed analogs of standard RNN architectures. It turns out that small tweaks to the standard update rules yield simpler features and gradients, theorem 1 and corollary 2. Finally, theorem 3 shows that, despite their more constrained architecture, strongly-typed RNNs have similar representational power to classical RNNs. Experiments in section 4 show that strongly-typed RNNs have comparable generalization performance and, surprisingly, lower training error than classical architectures (suggesting greater representational power). The flipside is that regularization appears to be more important for strongly-typed architectures, see experiments.\nRelated work. The analogy between neural networks and functional programming was proposed in (Olah, 2015), which also argued that representations should be interpreted as types. This paper sharpens, extends and applies Olah’s proposal. There has been prior work on typed-linear algebra (Macedo & Oliveira, 2013). However, their proposal is not intended for or suited to applications in machine learning. Many familiar RNN architectures already incorporate forms of weak-typing, see section 3.1.\nNotation. Dot-products are denoted by 〈w,x〉 or w⊺x."

Diagonalization converts type T1 into a new type, T2 → T2, that acts on T2 by coordinatewise scalar multiplication.\n1Note: πi is projection onto the ith coordinate.\nDefinition 1 is inspired by how physicists have carved the world into an orthogonal basis of meters, amps, volts etc. The analogy is not perfect: e.g. f(x) = x2 maps meters to square-meters, whereas types are invariant to coordinatewise operations. Types are looser than physical units."

      "text" : "There is a subtle inconsistency in classical RNN designs that leads to incoherent features. Consider the updates:\nvanilla RNN: ht = σ(V · ht−1 +W · xt + b). (1)\nWe drop the nonlinearity, since the inconsistency is already visible in the linear case. Letting zt := Wxt and unfolding Eq. (1) over time obtains\nht = t∑\ns=1\nVt−s · zs. (2)\nThe inconsistency can be seen via dot-products and via types. From the dot-product perspective, observe that multiplying an input by a matrix squared yields\nV2z =\n\n  v1 ... vd\n\n \n\n  \n... ...\nc1 · · · cd ... ...\n\n   z =\n\n   \n〈\n(v⊺1ci )d i=1 , z 〉\n... 〈\n(v⊺dci )d i=1 , z 〉\n\n    ,\nwhere vi refers to rows of V and ci to columns. Each coordinate of V2z is computed by measuring the similarity of a row of V to all of its columns, and then measuring the similarity of the result to z. In short, a spaghetti-like mess.\nFrom a type perspective, apply an SVD to V = PDQ⊺ and observe that V2 = PDQ⊺PDQ⊺. Each multiplication by P or Q⊺ transforms the input to a new type, obtaining\nTh DQ⊺ −−−→ Tlat1 P −→ Tlat2 ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nV\nDQ⊺\n−−−→ Tlat3 P −→ Tlat4 ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nV\n.\nThus V sends z 7→ Tlat2 whereas V 2 sends z 7→ Tlat4 . Adding terms involving V and V2, as in Eq. (2), entails adding vectors expressed in different orthogonal bases – which is analogous to adding joules to volts. The same problem applies to LSTMs and GRUs.\nTwo recent papers provide empirical evidence that recurrent (horizontal) connections are problematic even after gradients are stabilized: (Zaremba et al., 2015) find that Dropout performs better when restricted to vertical connections and (Laurent et al., 2015) find that Batch Normalization fails unless restricted to vertical connections (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015). More precisely, (Laurent et al., 2015) find that Batch Normalization improves training but not test error when restricted to vertical connections; it fails completely when also applied to horizontal connections.\nCode using GOTO can be perfectly correct, and RNNs with type mismatches can achieve outstanding performance. Nevertheless, both lead to spaghetti-like information/gradient flows that are hard to reason about.\nType-preserving transforms. One way to resolve the type inconsistency, which we do not pursue in this paper, is to use symmetric weight matrices so that V = PDP⊺ where P is orthogonal and D = diag(d). From the dotproduct perspective,\nht = t∑\ns=1\nPDt−sP⊺zs,\nwhich has the simple interpretation that z is amplified (or dampened) byD in the latent type provided byP. From the type-perspective, multiplication by Vk is type-preserving\nTh P⊺ −−→ Tlat1 dk⊙• −−−→ Tlat1 P −→ Th ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nVk\nso addition is always performed in the same basis.\nA familiar example of type-preserving transforms is autoencoders – under the constraint that the decoder W⊺ is the transpose of the encoder W. Finally, (Moczulski et al., 2015) propose to accelerate matrix computations in feedforward nets by interleaving diagonal matrices, A and D, with the orthogonal discrete cosine transform, C. The resulting transform, ACDC⊺, is type-preserving."

Similar considerations hold for LSTMs and GRUs. Fortunately, the situation is more amenable for strongly-typed architectures.

Direct computation.\nIn summary, T-RNNs compute a dynamic distribution over time steps, and then compute the expected feedforward features over that distribution. T-LSTMs store expectations in private memory cells that are reweighted by the output gate when publicly broadcast.

Evidence that side-effects are a problem for LSTMs can be found in (Zaremba et al., 2015) and (Laurent et al., 2015), which show that Dropout and Batch Normalization respectively need to be restricted to vertical connections.\nIn short, under strong-typing the learnware carves out features which the firmware uses to perform coordinatewise state updates hit = g(h i t−1, z i t−1). Vanilla RNNs allow arbitrary state updates ht = g(ht−1,xt). LSTMs and GRUs restrict state updates, but allow arbitrary functions of the state. Translated from a continuous to discrete setting, the distinction between strongly-typed and classical architectures is analogous to working with binary logic gates (AND, OR) on variables zt learned by the vertical connections – versus working directly with n-ary boolean operations.\nRepresentational power.

Let z = w⊺x be a feature of interest. Combining (Leshno et al., 1993) with the observation that aρ(bh + z + c) = ρ(abh + az + ac) for a > 0 implies that span{ρ(b · ht−1 + zt) | b, c ∈ R} = C(R2). As many weighted copies az of z as necessary are obtained by adding rows to W that are scalar multiples of w.\n2A superficially similar factorization holds for GRUs and LSTMs. However, their learnware is state-dependent, since (ft, zt,ot) depend on ht−1.\nAny set of binary functions on any collection of features can thus be approximated.

Test error was significantly worse for the strongly-typed architectures. A possible explanation for both observations is that strongly-typed architectures require more extensive regularization.\nAn intriguing result is that the T-RNN performs in the same ballpark as LSTMs, with perplexity within a factor of two. By contrast, the vanilla RNN fails to achieve competitive performance. This suggests there may be strongly-typed architectures of intermediate complexity between RNNs and LSTMs with comparable performance to LSTMs.\nThe dropout-regularized “medium” T-LSTM matches the LSTM performance reported in (Zaremba et al., 2015). The 3-layer T-LSTM obtains slightly better performance. The results were obtained with with almost identical parameters to Zaremba et al (the learning rate decay was altered), suggesting that T-LSTMs are viable alternatives to LSTMs for sequence learning tasks when properly regularized. Strongly-typed GRUs did not match the performance of GRUs, possibly due to insufficient regularization.\nRuntime. Since strongly-typed RNNs have fewer nonlinearities than standard RNNs, we expect that they should\nhave lower computational complexity.

The complicated structure of LSTMs and GRUs has led to searches for simpler alternatives with limited success (Bayer et al., 2009; Greff et al., 2015; Jozefowicz et al., 2015; Le et al., 2015; Mikolov et al., 2015). This paper introduces strong-typing as a tool to guide the search for alternate architectures. In particular, we suggest searching for update equations that learn wellbehaved features, rather than update equations that “appear simple”. We draw on two disparate intuitions that turn out to be surprisingly compatible: (i) that neural networks are analogous to measuring devices (Balduzzi, 2012) and (ii) that training an RNN is analogous to writing code.\nThe main contribution is a new definition of type that is closely related to singular value decomposition – and is thus well-suited to deep learning. It turns out that classical RNNs are badly behaved from a type-perspective, which motivates modifying the architectures. Section 3 tweaked LSTMs and GRUs to make them well-behaved from a typing and functional programming perspective, yielding features and gradients that are easier to reason about than classical architectures.\nStrong-typing has implications for the depth of RNNs. It was pointed out in (Pascanu et al., 2014) that unfolding\nhorizontal connections over time implies the concept of depth is not straightforward in classical RNNs. By contrast, depth has the same meaning in strongly-typed architectures as in feedforward nets, since vertical connections learn features and horizontal connections act coordinatewise.\nExperiments in section 4 show that strongly-typed RNNs achieve comparable generalization performance to classical architectures when regularized with dropout and have consistently lower training error. It is important to emphasize that the experiments are not conclusive. Firstly, we did not deviate far from settings optimized for classical RNNs when training strongly-typed RNNs. Secondly, the architectures were chosen to be as close as possible to classical RNNs. A more thorough exploration of the space of strongly-typed nets may yield better results.\nTowards machine reasoning. A definition of machine reasoning, adapted from (Bottou, 2014), is “algebraically manipulating features to answer a question”. Hard-won experience in physics (Chang, 2004), software engineering (Dijkstra, 1968), and other fields has led to the conclusion that well-chosen constraints are crucial to effective reasoning. Indeed, neural Turing machines (Graves et al., 2014) are harder to train than more constrained architectures such as neural queues and deques (Grefenstette et al., 2015).\nStrongly-typed features have a consistent semantics, theorem 1, unlike features in classical RNNs which are rotated across time steps – and are consequently difficult to reason about. We hypothesize that strong-typing will provide a solid foundation for algebraic operations on learned features. Strong-typing may then provide a useful organizing principle in future machine reasoning systems.\nAcknowledgements.

Unfortunately, although the most effective RNN architectures are perhaps excessively complicated, extensive searches have not found simpler alternatives. This paper imports ideas from physics and functional programming into RNN design to provide guiding principles. From physics we introduce type constraints, analogous to the constraints that disqualify adding meters to seconds in physics. From functional programming, we require that strongly-typed architectures factorize into stateless learnware and statedependent firmware, thereby ameliorating the impact of side-effects. The features learned by strongly-typed nets have a simple semantic interpretation via dynamic average-pooling on onedimensional convolutions. We also show that strongly-typed gradients are better behaved than in classical architectures, and characterize the representational power of strongly-typed nets. Finally, experiments show that, despite being more constrained, strongly-typed architectures achieve lower training error and comparable generalization error to classical architectures.",
