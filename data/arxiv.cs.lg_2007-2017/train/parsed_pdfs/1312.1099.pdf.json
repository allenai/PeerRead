      "text" : "given high-dimensional features is a challenging problem. It is important to allow not only the mean but also the variance and shape of the response density to change flexibly with features, which are massive-dimensional. We propose a multiscale dictionary learning model, which expresses the conditional response density as a convex combination of dictionary densities, with the densities used and their weights dependent on the path through a tree decomposition of the feature space. A fast graph partitioning algorithm is applied to obtain the tree decomposition, with Bayesian methods then used to adaptively prune and average over different subtrees in a soft probabilistic manner. The algorithm scales efficiently to approximately one million features. State of the art predictive performance is demonstrated for toy examples and two neuroscience applications including up to a million features."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Massive datasets are becoming an ubiquitous by-product of modern scientific and industrial applications. These data present statistical and computational challenges because many previously developed analysis approaches do not scaleup sufficiently. Challenges arise because of the ultra high-dimensionality and relatively low sample size. Parsimonious models for such big data assume that the density in the ambient space concentrates around a lower-dimensional (possibly nonlinear) subspace. A plethora of methods are emerging to estimate such lower-dimensional subspaces [25, 2].\nar X\niv :1\n31 2.\n10 99\nv1 [\nWe are interested in using such lower-dimensional embeddings to obtain estimates of the conditional distribution of some target variable(s). This conditional density estimation setting arises in a number of important application areas, including neuroscience, genetics, and video processing. For example, one might desire automated estimation of a predictive density for a neurologic phenotype of interest, such as intelligence, on the basis of available data for a patient including neuroimaging. The challenge is to estimate the probability density function of the phenotype nonparametrically based on a 106 dimensional image of the subject’s brain. It is crucial to avoid parametric assumptions on the density, such as Gaussianity, while allowing the density to change flexibly with predictors. Otherwise, one can obtain misleading predictions and poorly characterize predictive uncertainty.\nThere is a rich machine learning and statistical literature on conditional density estimation of a response y ∈ Y given a set of features (predictors) x = (x1, x2, . . . , xp)\nT ∈ X⊆ Rp. Common approaches include hierarchical mixtures of experts [16, 17], kernel methods [10, 15, 11], Bayesian finite mixture models [23, 29, 22] and Bayesian nonparametrics [13, 9, 7, 28]. However, there has been limited consideration of scaling to large p settings, with the variational Bayes approach of [29] being a notable exception. For dimensionality reduction, [29] follow a greedy variable selection algorithm. Their approach does not scale to the sized applications we are interested in. For example, in a problem with p = 1, 000 and n = 500, they reported a CPU time of 51.7 minutes for a single analysis. We are interested in problems with p having many more orders of magnitude, requiring a faster computing time while also accommodating flexible nonlinear dimensionality reduction (variable selection is a limited sort of dimension reduction). To our knowledge, there are no nonparametric density regression competitors to our approach, which maintain a characterization of uncertainty in estimating the conditional densities; rather, all sufficiently scalable algorithms provide point predictions and/or rely on restrictive assumptions such as linearity.\nIn big data problems, scaling is often accomplished using divide-and-conquer techniques. However, as the number of features increases, the problem of finding the best splitting attribute becomes intractable, so that CART, MARS and multiple tree models cannot be efficiently applied. Similarly, mixture of experts becomes computationally demanding, since both mixture weights and dictionary densities are predictor dependent. To improve efficiency, sparse extensions relying on different variable selection algorithms have been proposed [21]. However, performing variable selection in high dimensions is effectively intractable: algorithms need to efficiently search for the best subsets of predictors to include in weight and mean functions within a mixture model, an NP-hard problem [14].\nIn order to efficiently deal with massive datasets, we propose a novel multiscale approach which starts by learning a multiscale dictionary of densities. This tree is efficiently learned in a first stage using a fast and scalable graph partitioning algorithm applied to the high-dimensional observations [19]. Expressing the conditional densities f(y|x) for each x ∈ X as a convex combi-\nnation of coarse-to-fine scale dictionary densities, the learning problem in the second stage estimates the corresponding multiscale probability tree. This is accomplished in a Bayesian manner using a novel multiscale stick-breaking process, which allows the data to inform about the optimal bias-variance tradeoff; weighting coarse scale dictionary densities more highly decreases variance while adding to bias. This results in a model that borrows information across different resolution levels and reaches a good compromise in terms of the bias-variance tradeoff. We show that the algorithm scales efficiently to millions of features."

      "heading" : "2 Setting",
      "text" : "Let X : Ω → X ⊆ Rp be a p-dimensional Euclidean vector-valued predictor random variable, taking values x ∈ X , with a marginal probability distribution fX . Similarly, let Y : Ω→ Y be a target-valued random variable (e.g., Y ⊆ R). For inferential expedience, we posit the existence of a latent variable η : Ω → M ⊆ X , where M is only d “dimensional” and d p. Note that M need not be a linear subspace of X , rather, M could be, for example, a union or affine subspaces, or a smooth compact Riemannian manifold. Regardless of the nature of M, we assume that we can approximately decompose the joint distribution as follows, fX,Y,η = fX,Y |ηfη = fY |X,ηfX|ηfη ≈ fY |ηfX|ηfη. Hence, we assume that the signal approximately concentrates around a low-dimensional latent space, fY |X,η = fY |η. This is a much less restrictive assumption than the commonplace assumption in manifold learning that the marginal distribution fX concentrates around a low-dimensional latent space.\nTo provide some intuition for our model, we provide the following concrete example where the distribution of y ∈ R is a Gaussian function of the coordinate η ∈ M along the swissroll, which is embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. Specifically, we sample the manifold coordinate, η ∼ U(0, 1). We sample x = (x1, . . . , xp) T as follows\nx1 = η sin(η) ; x2 = η cos(η) ; xr ∼ N (0, 1) r ∈ {3, . . . , p}\nFinally, we sample y from N (µ(η), σ(η)). Clearly, x and y are conditionally independent given η, which is the low-dimensional signal manifold. In particular, x lives on a swissroll embedded in a p-dimensional ambient space, but y is only a function of the coordinate η along the swissrollM. The left panels of Figure 1 depict this example when µ(η) = η and σ(η) = η + 1."

      "text" : "We propose here a general modular approach which we refer to as multiscale dictionary learning for estimating conditional distributions (“Ms. Deeds”). Ms. Deeds consists of two components: (i) a tree decomposition of the space, and (ii) an assumed form of the conditional probability model.\nTree Decomposition A tree decomposition τ yields a multiscale partition of the data or the ambient space in which the data live. Let (W, ρW , FW ) be a measurable metric space, where FW is a Borel probability measure, W, and ρW : W ×W → R is a metric on W. Let BWr (w) be the ρW -ball inside W of radius r > 0 centered at w ∈ W. For example, W could be the data corpus Dn, or it could be X × Y. We define a tree decomposition as in [2, 6]. A partition tree τ of W consists of a collection of cells, τ = {Cj,k}j∈Z,k∈Kj . At each scale j, the set of cells Cj = {Cj,k}k∈Kj provides a disjoint partition of W almost everywhere. We define j = 0 as the root node. For each j > 0, each set has a unique parent node. Denote\nAj,k = {(j′, k′) : Cj,k ⊆ Cj′,k′ , j′ < j} , Dj,k = {(j′, k′) : Cj′,k′ ⊆ Cj,k, j′ > j}\nrespectively the ancestors and the descendants of node (j, k). Unlike classical harmonic theory which presupposes τ (e.g., in wavelets [8]), we choose to learn τ from the data. Previously, Chen et al. [6] developed a multiscale measure estimation strategy, and proved that there exists a scale j such that the approximate measure is within some bound of the true measure, under certain relatively general assumptions. We decided to simply partition the x’s, ignoring the y’s in the partitioning strategy. Our justification for this choice is as follows. First, sometimes there are many different y’s for many different applications. In such cases, we do not want to bias the partitioning to any specific y’s, all the more so when new unknown y’s may later emerge. Second, because the x’s are so much higher dimensional than the y’s in our applications of interest, the partitions would be dominated by the x’s, unless we chose a partitioning strategy that emphasized the y’s. Thus, our strategy mitigates this difficulty (while certainly introducing others).\nGiven that we are going to partition using only the x’s, we still face the choice of precisely how to partition. A fully Bayesian approach would construct a large number of partitions, and integrate over them to obtain posteriors. However, such a fully Bayesian strategy remains computationally intractable at scale, so we adopt a hybrid strategy. Specifically, we employ METIS [19], a wellknown relatively efficient multiscale partitioning algorithm with demonstrably good empirical performance on a wide range of graphs. Given n observations, i.e. xi = (xi1, . . . , xip)T ∈ X for i ∈ [n], the graph construction follows via computing all pairwise distances using ρ(xu, xv) = ‖x̃u − x̃v‖2, where x̃ is the whitened x (i.e., mean subtracted and variance normalized). We let there be an edge between xu and xv whenever e−ρ(xu,xv) 2\n> t, where t is some threshold chosen to elicit the desired sparsity level. Applying METIS recursively on the graph constructed in this way yields a single tree (see supplementary material for further details).\nConditional Probability Model Given the tree decomposition of the data, we place a non-parametric prior over the tree. Specifically, we define fY |X as\nfY |X = ∑ j∈Z πj,kj(x)fj,kj(x)(y|x) (1)\nwhere kj(x) is the set at scale j where x has been allocated and πj,kj (x) are weights across scales such that ∑ j∈Z πj,kj(x) = 1. We let weights in Eq. (1) be generated by a stick-breaking process [26]. For each node Cj,k in the partition tree, we define a stick length Vj,k ∼ Beta(1, α). The parameter α encodes the complexity of the model, with α = 0 corresponding to the case in which f(y|x) = f(y). The stick-breaking process is defined as\nπj,k = Vj,k ∏\n(j′,k′)∈Aj,k\n[1− Vj′,k′ ] , (2)\nwhere ∑\n(j′,k′)∈Aj,k πj′,k′ = 1. The implication of this is that each scale within a path is weighted to optimize the bias/variance trade-off across scales. We refer\nto this prior as a multiscale stick-breaking process. Note that this Bayesian nonparametric prior assigns a positive probability to all possible paths, including those not observed in the training data. Thus, by adopting this Bayesian formulation, we are able to obtain posterior estimates for any newly observed data, regardless of the amount and variability of training data. This is a pragmatically useful feature of the Bayesian formulation, in addition to the alleviation of the need to choose a scale [6].\nEach fj,k in Eq. (1) is an element of a family of distributions. This family might be quite general, e.g., all possible conditional densities, or quite simple, e.g., Gaussian distributions. Moreover, the family can adapt with j or k, being more complex at the coarser scales (for which nj,k’s are larger), and simpler for the finer scales (or partitions with fewer samples). We let the family of conditional densities for y be Gaussian for simplicity, that is, we assume that fj,k = N (µj,k, σj,k) with µj,k ∈ R and σj,k ∈ R+. Because we are interested in posteriors over the conditional distribution fY |X , we place relatively uninformative but conjugate priors on µj,k and σj,k, specifically, assuming the y’s have been whitened and are unidimensional, µj,k ∼ N (0, 1) and σj,k = IG(a, b). Obviously, other choices, such as finite or infinite mixtures of Gaussians are also possible for continuous valued data."

      "text" : "In this work we have introduced a general formalism to estimate conditional distributions via multiscale dictionary learning. An important property of any such strategy is the ability to scale up to ultrahigh-dimensional predictors. We considered simulations and real-data examples where the dimensionality of the predictor space approached one million. To our knowledge, no other approach to learn conditional distributions can run at this scale. Our approach explicitly assumes that the posterior fY |X can be well approximated by projecting x onto a lower-dimensional space, fY |X ≈ fY |η, where η ∈M ⊂ Rd, and x ∈ Rd. Note that this assumption is much less restrictive than assuming that x is close to a low-dimensional space; rather, we only assume that the part of fX that “matters” to predict y lives near a low-dimensional subspace. Because a fully Bayesian\nstrategy remains computationally intractable at this scale, we developed an empirical Bayes approach, estimating the partition tree based on the data, but integrating over scales and posteriors.\nWe demonstrate that even though we obtain posteriors over the conditional distribution fY |X , our approach, dubbed multiscale stick-breaking (MSB), outperforms several standard machine learning algorithms in terms of both predictive accuracy and computational time, as the sample size (n) and ambient dimension (p) increase. This improvement was demonstrated when theM was a swissroll, a latent subspace, a union of latent subspaces, and real data (for which the latent space may not even exist).\nIn future work, we will extend these numerical results to obtain theory on posterior convergence. Indeed, while multiscale methods benefit from a rich theoretical foundation [2], the relative advantages and disadvantages of a fully Bayesian approach, in which one can estimate posteriors over all functionals of fY |X at all scales, remains relatively unexplored.\nReferences [1] ABIDE. http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/.\n[2] W.K.

    "abstractText" : "Nonparametric estimation of the conditional distribution of a response given high-dimensional features is a challenging problem. It is important to allow not only the mean but also the variance and shape of the response density to change flexibly with features, which are massive-dimensional. We propose a multiscale dictionary learning model, which expresses the conditional response density as a convex combination of dictionary densities, with the densities used and their weights dependent on the path through a tree decomposition of the feature space. A fast graph partitioning algorithm is applied to obtain the tree decomposition, with Bayesian methods then used to adaptively prune and average over different subtrees in a soft probabilistic manner. The algorithm scales efficiently to approximately one million features. State of the art predictive performance is demonstrated for toy examples and two neuroscience applications including up to a million features.",
