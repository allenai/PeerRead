      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Many localization systems have been proposed over the years including the GPS system [4], RF-based systems [2, 27], and infrared-based systems [22]. All these systems require that the tracked entity carries a device. On the other hand, device-free (DF) passive localization [26] is based on using typical wireless networks to detect and track entities that do not carry any devices nor participate actively in the localization process. It depends on the fact that the RF signal strength is affected by human motion. DF localization can be used in many applications including smart homes, intrusion detection, medical care, and traffic estimation. A typical DF system (Figure 1) consists of signal transmitters (such as standard access points (APs)), monitoring points (MPs) (such as standard laptops or APs themselves), and an application server for processing the received signal strength from the MPs to detect and localize events.\nCurrent approaches for DF localization include radarbased systems, e.g. [25, 11, 6], computer vision based systems, e.g. [13, 9] and Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI), e.g. [23]. These systems, however, need special hardware and high installation cost. On the contrary, a\nar X\niv :1\n30 8.\n07 68\nv1 [\ncs .N\nI] 4\nA ug\n2 01\n3\nnumber of DF localization systems have been proposed that operate in standard WiFi networks, e.g. Nuzzer [16] and Rasid [8], without requiring any additional equipment. Therefore, these systems provide a value added-service on top of the wireless infrastructure, just based on the reported signal strength from the MAC layer. While these systems provide lower cost localization services, they still require a large number of streams (a data stream is the data received from one AP at one MP), which limits their applicability and accuracy in a large class of scenarios, such as in homes and small bussinesses, where usually a small number, typically one AP is installed.\nIn this paper, we introduce MonoStream as a highaccuracy limited-hardware device-free WLAN localization system. MonoStream is designed to work with a low number of streams, typically one (i.e. one AP and one MP). To compensate for the loss of information due to reducing the number of streams, MonoStream leverages the detailed physical layer information of WiFi networks. In particular, the IEEE 802.11n standard uses the OFDM modulation, where a wide channel is divided into several orthogonal sub-carriers each arriving at the location of the receiver with distinct values of phase and magnitude (denoted as Channel State Information (CSI)). This provides rich information to detect the effect of human motion on the magnitude of each subcarrier, as compared to a single signal strength value that has been used with the current approaches. In addition, the IEEE 802.11n devices use the MIMO technology, which further provides more information about each antenna pair from the transmitter to the receiver.\nTo further address the noisy wireless channel and the rich CSI information, MonoStream models the DF localization problem as an object recognition problem, where it treats the CSI profile at different locations as images and extracts novel features that can capture small variations in the effect of the human standing at different locations in the area of interest on the CSI vectors. To reduce the computational cost of the proposed techniques on the application server, MonoStream employs a joint boosting technique [19] to scale up for a large number of features and locations. Experimental evaluation, in two typical testbeds using a single access point and a single laptop, shows that MonoStream can achieve a localization accuracy of less than 0.95m. This corresponds to at least 26% enhancement in median distance error over the state-of-the-art DF localization systems using the same environment. This comes with a realtime location update rate that requires less than 23ms per location estimate.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces a brief background about the physical layer information and its properties that can be used\nto identify the human location. Following that, Section 3 presents the MonoStream system details. Section 4 describes the performance evaluation of the proposed system, comparing it to the state-of-the-art DF localization systems. Then, we present the related work in section 5, and discuss the other points related to the system in section 6. Finally, we conclude the paper and give directions for future work in section 7."

      "text" : "Many IEEE 802.11 standards (e.g. a/g/n) use OFDM modulation that transmits signals over several orthogonal frequencies called sub-carriers. Each signal transmitted on a sub-carrier has a different signal strength and phase. Typical wireless cards provide only a single received signal strength (RSS) value representing the superposition of information from all sub-carriers.\nRecently, some IEEE 802.11n standard based cards available in the market provide detailed magnitude and phase information about the different sub-carriers represented as Channel State Information (CSI). In particular, the Intel 5300 card reports the CSI for 30 groups of sub-carriers, which is about one group for every 2 sub-carriers for the 20MHz channels operating on the 2.4GHz frequency [7].\nThe IEEE 802.11n nodes also use another technology which is Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) where there are multiple transmitter and receiver antennas. Each combination of receiver and transmitter antennas can be considered as a separate virtual link/stream. Therefore, MIMO technology provides multiple virtual streams between a transmitter-receiver pair and hence has the potential of providing better accuracy."

      "heading" : "2.2 CSI Observations",
      "text" : "In this section, we show some of our observations on the CSI that we base the system components on. For space constraints, we focus on the magnitude of the received signal strength (RSS) in this paper and leave the phase information to a future paper.\nFigure 2 shows the CSI magnitude (profile) for one virtual link, i.e. a transmitter antenna-receiver antenna pair, over different packets (each packet is represented by a line) for the 30 sub-carriers. We can notice from the figure that the CSI values for each stream form one or more clusters.\nFigure 3 shows the CSI profile for the silence case\nas well as the presence of the human at two separated locations for one virtual link. The figure shows that the CSI magnitude information can be used to identify the human presence as well as determine her location.\nFigure 4 shows the CSI profile for two adjacent locations (separated by 1 meter) for one virtual link. The figure shows that there is still some difference in the CSI magnitude information between the two locations. Although the RSS distribution of each sub-carrier of each cluster at each location can be modelled by a Gaussian mixture [20, 1], the large overlap between the CSI profiles and the smoothness effect introduced by the Gaussian mixture leads to aliasing between adjacent loca-\ntions, which reduces accuracy. Instead, MonoStream takes a novel approach of treating the CSI profile of a given link at a given location (e.g. figures 2a or 2b) as an image and employs object recognition techniques with proven accuracy and efficiency to capture the small variations in the profile between adjacent locations."

This area is covered by only one AP with n MIMO antennas and one MP (e.g. a laptop) with a wireless card having m MIMO antennas. This leads to n.m virtual links between the transmitter and receiver. Using the OFDM modulation, each transmitted packet is sent using f sub-carriers on each of the n antennas. 1\n1This leads to a total of n.m.f virtual streams between each physical transmitter-receiver pair, as compared to only only stream with the traditional RSS-based techniques [16, 17].\nDuring the training phase, a human stands at each location l ∈ L and the CSI of a set of packets sent by the AP are recorded at the MP. The CSI information of all packets corresponding to location l is represented by a matrix (Figure 6) of size n.m, whose entry (i, j) represents the CSI profile (as in Figure 2) of the virtual link representing the packets from transmitter antenna i to receiver antenna j. This rich information is what allows MonsStream to achieve high accuracy with just a single AP-MP pair."

      "text" : "This section discusses our proposed CSI-based features that will be used to train the discrimination model\nused to differentiate between different locations. To capture small variations in the CSI profiles between adjacent locations, MonStream borrows techniques from the object recognition domain [10, 18], where the CSI profile of a particular virtual link at a certain location is treated as an image. Random sampling of features within these CSI-profile images is used to reduce complexity as well as increase the discrimination between adjacent locations.\nIn particular, we define a context filter on a CSI profile as a rectangular mask whose width is determined by the range of sub-carriers covered; and height determined by the range of CSI magnitude values covered (Figure 7). For example, we can define a context filter that covers sub-carriers from 3 to 12, and CSI magnitudes from 32 to 55. A set of d context filters T = {ti}; i = 1, ..., d is then defined by selecting rectangles with different random sizes (width and hight uniformly distributed over the range) over the CSI profiles in the matrix. These random filters, once selected, are then fixed over the different locations.\nLet λt be the number of packets that fall inside a CSI-context filter t ∈ T . Instead of using λt’s directly, MonoStream uses Haar-like [21] features2 to increase the feature space and hence lead to better accuracy. Specifically, for two different CSI-context filters ti, tj ∈ T , the associated feature λi,j is obtained as λi−λj . Note that there are ( d 2 ) different combinations of features to choose from, each representing a pair of filter indices (i, j). The choice of d represents a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency as quantified in the Evaluation Section. This feature space is further reduced by selecting the best features during the classifier training phase."

      "text" : "Once the features are extracted, the goal of the Classifier Training Module is to train a binary classifier for each location to differentiate it from all other fingerprint locations based on the training data. To balance computational efficiency and accuracy, we adopt an AdaBoost-based classifier [5, 12, 19]. AdaBoost is an iterative technique that adds a new simple weak classifier in each iteration. At each round, samples that are misclassified from previous rounds are assigned higher weights so that the current weak classifier focuses on disambiguating them. A weight is assigned to each classifier and the final classifier is defined as the linear combination of the classifiers from each iteration. AdaBoost can be regarded as a feature selection technique that selects the most discriminant g features, where g is the number of iterations. Therefore, this further reduces the number of features, and hence is more computa-\n2The key advantage of a Haar-like feature over other features is its calculation speed.\ntionally efficient. We adopt decision stumps as our weak binary classifiers. A decision stump is defined by three parameters: a feature that it classifies, a threshold on the feature value, and the sign of the decision (whether it takes a positive or negative value if the feature value is above the threshold). Therefore, implementing our weak classifier requires just one condition check, which is extremely efficient.\nFurthermore, instead of independently training the classifier of each location, we use a joint boosting approach that selects the best features that can be used to discriminate between the largest subset of locations [19] in each iteration. For a given performance level, joint boosting reduces the training overhead to logarithmic in the number of locations (as features are shared between locations), increases accuracy, reduces running time, and avoids over-fitting of the training samples. This last property is of specific importance in DF localization due to the noisy and dynamic nature of the wireless channel."

In addition, let cl the decision confidence of that classifier. In order to fuse the output of the different classifiers, we adopt a probabilistic approach where we want to find the location l∗ in the fingerprint L that maximizes the probability P (l|S).

The figure shows that different combinations lead to different accuracy. This is due to the noisy wireless channel and the different multipath effects encountered by the packets received at the different antennas. This means that using more antennas does not necessarily lead to better accuracy. The good news is that the SNR associated with the antennas can be used to determine the best combination. For the rest of this section, we use an-\ntennas a and c (i.e. m = 2) as they lead to the best accuracy.\n4.2.2 Effect of number of packets used in estimation (w)\nFigure 10 shows the effect of increasing the number of packets used in the estimation process. The figure shows that as the number of packets increases, the accuracy increases. However, increasing w increases the latency. Therefore, there is a tradeoff that a designer needs to balance based on her needs. Setting w = 500 gives high accuracy of 0.95m with reasonable latency.\n4.2.3 Effect of processed sub-carriers (f) Figure 11 shows the effect of increasing the number\nof sub-carriers on the median distance error. For a specific number of sub-carriers (f), we choose a number of random subsets of size f from the available 30 sub-\ncarriers and draw both the average and standard deviation of performance. The figure shows that, in general, increasing the number of sub-carriers leads to better accuracy. This due to the increased amount of available information. Therefore, a designer can tune the the accuracy-computational complexity if needed.\n4.2.4 Effect of number of averaged locations (k) Figure 12 shows the effect of increasing the number\nof averaged locations (k) for the continuous-space estimator.

      "text" : "Device-free tracking schemes have advanced over the year including: radar-based, camera-based, sensors-based, and WLAN-based systems. In the radar-based systems, pulses of radio waves are transmitted into the area of interest and based on measuring the received reflections, objects could be tracked. Several approaches have been presented in this class including ultra-wideband (UWB) systems [25], doppler radar [11], and MIMO radar systems [6]. On the other hand, camera-based tracking systems are based on analyzing a set of captured images to estimate the current locations of objects of interest [13, 9]. Sensor-based systems use especially installed sensor nodes to cover the area of interest. For example, [23] applies radio tomographic techniques to the readings of a dense array of sensors to obtain accurate DF tracking.\nAll these technologies share the requirement of in-\nstalling special hardware to be able to perform DF tracking, which reduces their scalability in terms of cost and coverage area. In contrast, WLAN DF tracking aims at exploiting the already installed WLAN. DF localization in WLANs was first introduced in [26] along with feasibility experiments in a controlled environment. Sev-\neral papers followed the initial vision to provide different techniques for detection and tracking of a single entity [14, 24, 8, 17]. Tracking multiple entities was proposed in SPOT [15] based on a probabilistic energy minimization framework that combines a conditional random field with a Markov model to capture both of spatial and temporal relations between active locations. All these techniques rely only on the reported signal strength from the MAC layer and hence require a large number of streams, i.e. APs and MPs, to provide acceptable accuracy.\nThe closest work to ours is the MonoPhy system [1] that models the CSI information using a Gaussian mixtures approach. However, since the CSI profiles in adjacent locations are usually similar, the smoothness effect of the Gaussian mixture leads to aliasing in the CSI space between adjacent locations, which reduces accuracy.\nThe novel approach adopted from the object recognition domain allows the MonoStream system to capture the small variations in RSS between adjacent locations and maintain high efficiency."

    "abstractText" : "Device-free (DF) localization is an emerging technology that allows the detection and tracking of entities that do not carry any devices not participate actively in the localization process. Typically, DF systems require a large number of transmitters and receivers to achieve acceptable accuracy, which is not available in many scenarios such as homes and small businesses. In this paper, we introduce MonoStream as an accurate single-stream DF localization system that leverages the rich Channel State Information (CSI) as well as MIMO information from the physical layer to provide accurate DF localization with only one stream. To boost its accuracy and attain low computational requirements, MonoStream models the DF localization problem as an object recognition problem and uses a novel set of CSI-context features and techniques with proven accuracy and efficiency. Experimental evaluation in two typical testbeds, with a side-by-side comparison with the state-of-the-art, shows that MonoStream can achieve an accuracy of 0.95m with at least 26% enhancement in median distance error using a single stream only. This enhancement in accuracy comes with an efficient execution of less than 23ms per location update on a typical laptop. This highlights the potential of MonoStream usage for real-time DF tracking applications.",
