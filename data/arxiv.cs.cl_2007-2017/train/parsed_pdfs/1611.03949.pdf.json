      "text" : "Understanding sentiment has always been one of the goals of AI in the decades. As a small step toward sentiment understanding, sentiment classification aims to classify sentiment to sentiment classes such as positive or negative, or more fine-grained classes such as very positive, positive, neutral, etc. There has been a variety of approaches for this purpose such as lexicon-based classification (Turney 2002), and early machine learning based methods (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002; Pang and Lee 2005), and recently neural network models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) (Kim 2014; Kalchbrenner, Grefenstette, and Blunsom 2014), recursive autoencoders (Socher et al. 2011; Socher et al. 2013), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Mikolov 2012; Chung et al. 2014; Tai, Socher, and Manning 2015; Zhu, Sobhani, and Guo 2015), and many more.\nIn spite of the great success of these neural models, there are some defects in previous studies. First, tree-structured models such as recursive autoencoders and Tree-LSTM (Tai, Socher, and Manning 2015; Zhu, Sobhani, and Guo 2015), depend on parsing tree structures and expensive phrase-level\nCopyright c© 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nannotation, whose performance drops substantially when only trained with sentence-level annotation. Second, sequence models such as CNN and recurrent network are not easy to produce competitive results as reported in the literature (Tai, Socher, and Manning 2015). Third, linguistic knowledge has not been fully employed in neural models, though (Qian et al. 2015) shows that part-of-speech tags can be quite effective for sentence-level classification.\nThe goal of this research is to developing simple sequence models but also attempts to fully employing linguistic resources to benefit sentiment classification. Firstly, we attempts to develop simple models that do not depend on parsing trees and avoid phrase-level annotation which is too expensive in real-world applications. Secondly, in order to obtain competitive performance, simple models can benefit from linguistic resources. Three types of resources can be addressed: sentiment lexicon, negation words, and intensity words. Sentiment lexicon offers the prior polarity of a word which can be useful in determining the sentiment polarity of longer texts such as phrases and sentences. Negation words are typical sentiment shifters (Zhu et al. 2014), which constantly shift sentiment expression. Intensify words such as very, and extremely change the valence degree of sentiment, which is important for fine-grained sentiment classification.\nIn order to model the linguistic role of sentiment, negation, and intensity words, and thus to generate linguistically coherent representations, our central idea is to regularize the difference between the predicted sentiment distribution of the current position, and that of the previous or next positions. For instance, if the current position is a negation word not, the current predicted distribution should be close to the transformed distribution of the next predicted distribution parameterized by the negation transformation matrix. To summarize, our contributions lie in three folds:\n• We propose several regularizers to model the linguistic role of sentiment, negation, and intensity words in sentiment classification. Experiments show that the regularizers are quite effective.\n• Due to the complexity of sentiment shifting effect of negation and intensify words, we design word-specific transformation matrices to respect the role of each word.\n• Unlike previous models depend on parsing structures and expensive phrase-level annotation, our models are simple\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n03 94\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n2 N\nov 2\n01 6\nand efficient but also obtain competitive performance."

      "text" : "Neural Networks for Sentiment Classification Recently, there are many neural networks proposed for sentiment classification. The most pioneering (perhaps) model may be the recursive autoencoder neural network which builds the representation of a sentence from subphrases recursively (Socher et al. 2011; Socher et al. 2013; Dong et al. 2014; Qian et al. 2015). Such recursive models usually depend on a tree structure of input text, and in order to obtain competitive results, usually require heavy annotation on each subphrase. Sequence models do not depend on a particular tree structure, for instance, convolutional neural network (CNN) is another type of widely used models for sentiment classification (Kim 2014; Kalchbrenner, Grefenstette, and Blunsom 2014). As used similarly in image processing, CNN defines convolution operations on a sequence of a text. Long short-term memory models are also common for learning sentence-level representation due to its capability of modeling the prefix or suffix context (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997). LSTM can be commonly applied to sequential data but also tree-structured parsing trees (Zhu, Sobhani, and Guo 2015; Tai, Socher, and Manning 2015). A complete search for optimal structures of recurrent networks and LSTMs can be seen in (Chung et al. 2014).\nApplying Linguistic Knowledge for Sentiment Classification Linguistic knowledge and sentiment resources are very helpful for sentiment analysis such as sentiment lexicons, negation words (not, never, neither, etc.), and intensity words (very, extremely, etc.).\nSentiment lexicon, such as Hu and Liu Lexicon (Hu and Liu 2004) and MPQA lexicon (Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann 2005), is widely used for sentiment classification (Pang and Lee 2008).\nNegation words play a critical role in modifying sentiment of textual expressions. Some early negation models are designed to reverse the sign of sentiment value of the modified text (Polanyi and Zaenen 2006). Since each individual negation word can affect sentiment words in different ways, the shifting hypothesis, is proposed, assuming that negators change the sentiment values by a constant amount (Taboada et al. 2011). The modified word is also an important factor on the negation effect, for instance, negation words turn positive to negative and turn negative to not negative. (Zhu et al. 2014) incorporate negation words as feature into neural network. (Kiritchenko and Mohammad 2016) incorporate negation words and other linguistic knowledge into a SVM classifier for composing opposing polarities.\nThe intensity words can change the valence degree (i.e., sentiment intensity) of the content word. Sentiment intensity of a phrase indicates the strength of associated sentiment, which is quite important for fine-grained sentiment classification or rating. (Taboada et al. 2011) directly reverse the polarity of modified words or change the sentiment strength by a fixed value. (Wei, Wu, and Lin 2011) predict the valence value for content words using a linear regression model. (Malandrakis et al. 2013) introduce a kernel function\nto combine semantic information for predicting sentiment score. In the SemEval-2016 task 7 subtask A, (Wang, Zhang, and Lan 2016) propose a learning-to-rank model with a pairwise strategy to predict sentiment intensity scores."

The forward and backward LSTMs are respectively formulated as follows:\n−→c t, −→ h t = g (LSTM)(−→c t−1, −→ h t−1, xt) (2) ←−c t, ←− h t = g (LSTM)(←−c t+1, ←− h t+1, xt) (3)\nwhere g(LSTM) is the same as that in Eq 1. Particularly, parameters in the two LSTMs are shared. The representation of the entire sentence is [ −→ h n, ←− h 1], where n is the length of the sentence.

      "text" : "The central idea of the paper is to output linguistically coherent predictions in sentiment classification by regularizing the outputs at adjacent positions of a sentence. For example, in sentence “this movie is interesting”, the predicted sentiment distributions at “this*1”, “this movie*”, and “this movie is*” should almost be the same, while the predicted sentiment distribution at “this movie is very interesting*” should be quite different from the preceeding positions since a sentiment word (“interesting”) is seen.\nMore formally, the predicted sentiment distribution (pt, based on ht, see Eq. 4) at position t should be linguistically\n1The asterisk denotes the current position.\nregularized with respect to that of the preceding (t − 1) or following (t + 1) positions. We propose a generic regularizer and three special regularizers based on the following linguistic observations:\n• Non-Sentiment Regularizer: if the two adjacent positions are all non-opinion words, the sentiment distributions of the two positions should be close to each other.\n• Sentiment Regularizer: if the word is a sentiment word found in a lexicon, the sentiment distribution of the current position should be significantly different from that of the next or previous positions.\n• Negation Regularizer: Negation words such as “not” and “never” are critical sentiment shifter (Kennedy and Inkpen 2006): usually shifts sentiment polarity from the positive side to the negative one, but sometimes highly depends on the negation word and the words they modify. The negation regularizer models this linguistic phenomena.\n• Intensity Regularizer: Intensity words such as “very” and “extremely” change the valence degree of a sentiment expression: for instance, from positive to very positive. Modeling this effect is quite important for fine-grained sentiment classification, and the intensity regularizer is designed to formulate this effect.\nIn order to enforce the model to produce coherent predictions, we propose a new loss function as follows to incorporate these regularizers:\nE(θ) = − ∑ i yi log pi + α ∑ i ∑ t Lit + β||θ||2 (4)\nwhere yi is the gold distribution, pi is the predicted distribution output from a softmax layer taking the sentence representation as input, Lit is one of the above regularizers or combination of these regularizers, α is the weight for the regularization term, and i, t is the index of sentence and position respectively."

Let’s revisit the example\n“this movie is interesting” again. At position t = 4 we see a positive word “interesting” so the predicted distribution at this position would be more positive than that at position t = 3. This is the issue of sentiment drift.\nIn order to address the sentiment drift issue, we propose a polarity shifting distribution sc ∈ RC for each sentiment class defined in a lexicon. For instance, a sentiment lexicon may have class labels like strong positive, weakly positive, weakly negative, and strong negative, and for each class, there is a shifting distribution which will be learned by the model. The sentiment regularizer states that if the current word is a sentiment word, the sentiment distribution drift should be observed in comparison to the previous position, as formulated as follows:\np (SR) t−1 = pt−1 + sc(xt) (6)\nL (SR) t = max(0, DKL(pt, p (SR) t−1 )−M) (7)\nwhere p(SR)t−1 is the drifted sentiment distribution after considering the shifting sentiment distribution corresponding to the word at position t, c(xt) is the prior sentiment class of word xt, and sc ∈ θ is a parameter to be optimized but could also be set fixed with prior knowledge. Note that in this way all words of the same sentiment class share the same drifting distribution, but in a refined setting, we can learn a shifting distribution for each sentiment word if large-scale datasets are available."

      "text" : "The negation regularizer approaches how negation words shift the sentiment distribution of its modifiers. When the input word xt is a negation word, the sentiment distribution should be shifted accordingly. However, the negation role is more complex than that by sentiment words, for example, the word “not” in “not good” and “not bad” have different roles in polarity shifting. The former changes the polarity to negative, while the latter changes to neutral instead of positive.\nTo respect such complex negation effects, we propose a transformation matrix Tm ∈ RC×C for each negation word m, and the matrix will be learned by the model. The regularizer assumes that if the current position is a negation word, the sentiment distribution of the current position should be close to that of the next or previous position with the transformation.\np (NR) t−1 = softmax(Txj × pt−1) (8)\np (NR) t+1 = softmax(Txj × pt+1) (9)\nL (NR) t = min\n{ max(0, DKL(pt, p (NR) t−1 )−M)\nmax(0, DKL(pt, p (NR) t+1 )−M)\n(10)\nwhere p(NR)t−1 and p (NR) t+1 is the sentiment distuibution after transformation, Txj ∈ θ is the transformation matrix for a negation word xj , a parameter to be learned during training.

      "heading" : "Applying Linguistic Regularizers to Bidirectional LSTM",
      "text" : "To make our model simple and elegant in a mathematical form, we do not consider the modification scope of negation and intensity word, which is a quite challenging problem in the NLP community. However, we can alleviate the problem by leveraging bidirectional LSTM.\nFor a single LSTM, we employ a backward LSTM from the end to the beginning of a sentence. This is because, at most times, the modified words of negation and intensity words are usually at the right side of the modifiers. But sometimes, the modified words are at the left side of negation and intensity words. To better address this issue, we employ bidirectional LSTM and let the model determine which side should be chosen.\nMore formally, in Bi-LSTM, we compute a transformed sentiment distribution on −→p t−1 of the forward LSTM and also that on←−p t+1 of the backward LSTM, and compute the minimum distance of the distribution of the current position to the two distributions. This could be formulated as follows:\n−→p (R)t−1 = softmax(Txj × −→p t−1) (11)\n←−p (R)t+1 = softmax(Txj × ←−p t+1) (12)\nL (R) t = min\n{ max(0, DKL( −→p t,−→p (R)t−1)−M)\nmax(0, DKL( ←−p t,←−p (R)t+1)−M)\n(13)\nwhere−→p (R)t−1 and ←−p (R)t+1 are the sentiment distributions transformed from the previous state −→p t−1 and next state ←−p t+1 respectively. Note that R ∈ {NR, IR} indicating the formulation works for both negation and intensity regularizers.\nDue to the same consideration, we redefine L(NSR)t and L (SR) t with bidirectional LSTM similarly.

In the sentiment regularizer, the sentiment shifting effect is parameterized\nwith a class-specific distribution (but could also be wordspecific if with more data). In the negation and intensity regularizers, the effect is parameterized with word-specific transformation matrices, meaning that different words have different parameters. Since the mechanism of how negation and intensity words shift sentiment expression is quite complex and highly dependent on individual words, we believe such mathematical operation will be more suitable for addressing complex linguistic roles of these words. This is a major advantage of our approach over other methods."

SST has provided phrase-level annotation on all inner nodes, but we only use the sentence-level annotation since one of our goals is to avoid expensive phrase-level annotation.\nThe sentiment lexicon contains two parts.

The second part consists of the leaf nodes of the SST dataset (i.e., all sentiment words) and there are 6, 886 polar words except neural ones. We combine the two parts and ignore those words that have conflicting sentiment labels, and produce a lexicon of 9, 750 words with 4 sentiment labels.

The baselines are listed as follows: • RNN/RNTN Recursive Neural Network over parsing\ntrees, proposed by (Socher et al. 2011) and Recursive Tensor Neural Network (Socher et al. 2013) employs tensors to model correlations between different dimensions of child nodes’ vectors.\n• LSTM/Bi-LSTM Long-short Term Memory (Cho et al. 2014) and the bidirectional variant as introduced previously.\n• Tree-LSTM Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory (Tai, Socher, and Manning 2015) introduces memory cells and gates into tree-structured neural network.\n• CNN Convolutional Neural Network (Kalchbrenner, Grefenstette, and Blunsom 2014) generates sentence representation by convolution and pooling operations. Firstly, we evaluate our model on the MR dataset and the results are shown in Table 3. As can be seen, we can make the following statements: • Both LR-LSTM and LR-Bi-LSTM outperforms their\ncounterparts substantially (81.5% vs. 77.4% and 82.1% vs. 79.3%, resp.), demonstrating the effectiveness of the linguistic regularizers.\n• LR-LSTM and LR-Bi-LSTM perform slightly better than Tree-LSTM but Tree-LSTM leverages a constituency tree structure while our model is a simple sequence model. As future work, we will apply such regularizers to treestructured models.\n• On this dataset, our model is comparable to CNN. For fine-grained sentiment classification, we evaluate our model on the SST dataset which has five sentiment classes { very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive} so that we can evaluate the sentiment shifting effect of intensity words. The experiment result is shown in Table 3. We have the following observations: • Similarly, linguistically regularized LSTM and Bi-LSTM\nare better than their counterparts. It’s worth noting that LR-Bi-LSTM (trained with just sentence-level annotation) is even comparable to Bi-LSTM trained with phraselevel annotation. That means, LR-Bi-LSTM can avoid the heavy phrase-level annotation but still obtain competitive results.\n• Our models are comparable to Tree-LSTM but our models are not dependent on a parsing tree and more simple, and hence more efficient. Further, for Tree-LSTM, the model is heavily dependent on phrase-level annotation, otherwise the performance drops substantially (from 51% to 48.1%).\n• On this dataset, our model is apparently better than CNN."

This may be due to the fact that only 14% of sentences contains negation words in the test datasets, and 23% contains intensity words, and thus we further evaluate the models on two subsets, as shown in Table 5.\nThe experiments on the subsets show that: 1) With linguistic regularizers, LR-Bi-LSTM outperforms Bi-LSTM remarkably on these subsets; 2) When the negation regularizer is removed from the model, the performance drops significantly on both MR and SST subsets; 3) Similar observations can be made regarding the intensity regularizer.\n2Kindly note that almost all sentences contain sentiment words, see Tab. 1."

Similar observations can be found with word “very”.\nThere are also many phrases maintain their sentiment. No surprisingly, for very positive/negative phrases, phrases modified by intensifiers still maintain the strong sentiment. For the left phrases, they fall into three categories: first, words modified by intensifiers are non-sentiment words, such as most of us, most part; second, intensifiers are not strong enough to shift sentiment, such as most complex (from negative to negative), most traditional (from positive to positive); third, our models fail to shift sentiment with intensifiers such as most vital, most resonant film."

    "abstractText" : "Sentiment understanding has been a long-term goal of AI in the past decades. This paper deals with sentence-level sentiment classification. Though a variety of neural network models have been proposed very recently, however, previous models either depend on expensive phrase-level annotation, whose performance drops substantially when trained with only sentence-level annotation; or do not fully employ linguistic resources (e.g., sentiment lexicons, negation words, intensity words), thus not being able to produce linguistically coherent representations. In this paper, we propose simple models trained with sentence-level annotation, but also attempt to generating linguistically coherent representations by employing regularizers that model the linguistic role of sentiment lexicons, negation words, and intensity words. Results show that our models are effective to capture the sentiment shifting effect of sentiment, negation, and intensity words, while still obtain competitive results without sacrificing the models’ simplicity.",
