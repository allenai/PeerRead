We propose here a new neural network model where each layer is associated with a set of candidate mappings. When an input is processed, at each layer, one mapping among these candidates is selected according to a sequential decision process. The resulting model is structured according to a DAG like architecture, so that a path from the root to a leaf node defines a sequence of transformations. Instead of considering global transformations, like in classical multilayer networks, this model allows us for learning a set of local transformations. It is thus able to process data with different characteristics through specific sequences of such local transformations, increasing the expression power of this model w.r.t a classical multilayered network. The learning algorithm is inspired from policy gradient techniques coming from the reinforcement learning domain and is used here instead of the classical back-propagation based gradient descent techniques. Experiments on different datasets show the relevance of this approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 10:58:17 GMT  (448kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0510v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["ludovic denoyer", "patrick gallinari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.0510"}
