      "text" : "Low-rank matrix approximation is an important ingredient of modern machine learning methods. Numerous learning tasks rely on multiplication and inversion of matrices, operations that scale cubically in the number of data points N, and therefore quickly become a bottleneck for large data. In such cases, low-rank matrix approximations promise speedups with a tolerable loss in accuracy.\nA notable instance is the Nyström method [32, 43], which takes a positive semidefinite matrix K ∈ RN×N as input, selects from it a small subset C of columns K·,C, and constructs the approximation K̃ = K·,CK†C,CKC,·. The matrix K̃ is then used in place of K, which can decrease runtimes from O(N3) to O(N|C|3), a huge savings (since typically |C| N).\nSince its introduction into machine learning, the Nyström method has been applied to a wide spectrum of problems, including kernel ICA [6, 36], kernel and spectral methods in computer vision [8, 18], manifold learning [39, 40], regularization [35], and efficient approximate sampling [1]. Recent work [2, 5, 12] shows risk bounds for Nyström applied to various kernel methods.\nThe most important step of the Nyström method is the selection of the subset C, the so-called landmarks. This choice governs the approximation error and subsequent performance of the approximated learning methods [12]. The most basic strategy is to sample landmarks uniformly at random [43]. More sophisticated non-uniform selection strategies include deterministic greedy schemes [37], incomplete Cholesky decomposition [7, 17], sampling with probabilities proportional to diagonal values [14] or to column norms [15], sampling based on leverage scores [19], via K-means [44], or using submatrix determinants [9].\nWe study landmark selection using Determinantal Point Processes (Dpp), discrete probability models that allow tractable sampling of diverse non-independent subsets [26, 31]. Our work generalizes the determinant based scheme of Belabbas and Wolfe [9].1 We refer to our scheme as Dpp-Nyström, and analyze it from several perspectives.\n1The authors do not make any connection to Dpps.\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n06 05\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n8 M\nay 2\n01 6\nA key quantity in our analysis is the error of the Nyström approximation. Suppose k is the target rank; then for selecting c ≥ k landmarks, Nyström’s error is typically measured using the Frobenius or spectral norm relative to the best achievable error via rank-k SVD Kk; i.e., we measure\n‖K− K·,CK†C,CKC,·‖F ‖K− Kk‖F or ‖K− K·,CK†C,CKC,·‖2 ‖K− Kk‖2 .\nSeveral authors also use additive instead of relative bounds. However, such bounds are very sensitive to scaling, and become loose even if a single entry of the matrix is large. Thus, we focus on the above relative error bounds.\nFirst, we analyze this approximation error. Previous analyses [9] fix a cardinality c = k; we allow the general case of selecting c ≥ k columns. Our relative error bounds rely on the properties of characteristic polynomials. Empirically, Dpp-Nyström obtains approximations competitive to state-of-the-art methods.\nSecond, we consider its impact on kernel methods. Specifically, we address the impact of Nyström-based kernel approximations on kernel ridge regression. This task has been noted as the main application in [2, 5]. We show risk bounds of Dpp-Nyström that hold in expectation. Empirically, it achieves the best performance among competing methods.\nThird, we consider the efficiency of Dpp-Nyström; specifically, its tradeoff between error and running time. Since its proposal, determinantal sampling has so far not been used widely in practice due to valid concerns about its scalability. We consider a Gibbs sampler for k-Dpp, and analyze its mixing time using a path coupling [11] argument. We prove that under certain conditions the chain is fast mixing, which implies a linear running time for Dpp sampling of landmarks. Empirical results indicate that the chain yields favorable results within a small number of iterations, and the best efficiency-accuracy traedoffs compared to state-of-art methods (Figure 6)."

      "text" : "Throughout, we are approximating a given positive semidifinite (PSD) matrix K ∈ RN×N with eigendecomposition K = UΛU> and eigenvalues λ1 ≥ . . . ≥ λN . We use Ki,· for the i-th row and K·,j for the j-th column, and, likewise, KC,· for the rows of K and K·,C for the columns of K indexed by C ⊆ [N]. Finally, KC,C is the submatrix of K with rows and columns indexed by C. In this notation, Kk = U·,[k]Λ[k],[k]U>·,[k] is the best rank-k approximation to K in both Frobenius and spectral norm. We write r(·) for the rank and (·)† for the pseudoinverse, and denote a decomposition of K by B>B, where B ∈ Rr(K)×N .\nThe Nyström Method. The standard Nyström method selects a subset C ⊆ [N] of c = |C| landmarks, and approximates K with K·,CK†C,CKC,·. The actual set of landmarks affects the approximation quality, and is hence the subject of a substantial body of research [7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 37, 44]. Besides various landmark selection methods, there exist variations of the standard Nyström method. The ensemble Nyström method [27], for instance, uses a weighted combination of approximations. The modified Nyström method constructs an approximation K·,CK†·,CKK † C,·KC,· [38]. In this paper, we focus on the standard Nyström method. Determinantal Point Processes. A determinantal point process Dpp(K) is a distribution over all subsets of a ground set Y of cardinality N that is determined by a PSD kernel K ∈ RN×N . The probability of observing a subset C ⊆ [N] is proportional to det(KC,C), that is,\nPr(C) = det(KC,C)/ det(K + I). (2.1)\nWhen conditioning on a fixed cardinality, one obtains a k-Dpp [25]. To avoid confusion with the target rank k, and since we use cardinality c = |C|, we will refer to this distribution as c-Dpp2, and\n2Note that we refer to Dpp-Nyström as kDPP in experimental parts.\nnote that\nPr(C | |C| = c) = det(KC,C)ec(K)−1J |C| = cK,\nwhere ec(K) is the c-th coefficient of the characteristic polynomial det(λI−K) = ∑Nj=0(−1)jej(K)λN−j. Sampling from a (c-)Dpp can be done in polynomial time, but requires a full eigendecomposition of K [23], which is prohibitive for large N. A number of approaches have been proposed for more efficient sampling [1, 29, 42]. We follow an alternative approach based on Gibbs sampling and show that it can offer fast polynomial-time Dpp sampling and Nyström approximations."

      "text" : "Next, we consider sampling c landmarks C ⊆ [N] from c-Dpp(K), and use the approximation K̃ = K·,CK†C,CKC,·. We call this approach Dpp-Nyström. It was essentially introduced in [9], but without making the explicit connection to Dpps. Our analysis builds on this connection and subsumes existing results that only apply to c being the rank k of the target approximation.\nWe begin with error bounds for matrix approximations:\nTheorem 1 (Relative Error). If C ∼ c-Dpp(K), then Dpp-Nyström satisfies the relative error bounds\nEC\n[ ‖K− K·C(KC,C)†KC·‖F\n‖K− Kk‖F\n] ≤ (\nc + 1 c + 1− k\n)√ N − k,\nEC\n[ ‖K− K·C(KC,C)†KC·‖2\n‖K− Kk‖2\n] ≤ (\nc + 1 c + 1− k\n) (N − k).\nThese bounds hold in expectation. An additional argument based on [33] yields high probability bounds, too (Appendix A).\nTo show Theorem 1, we exploit a property of characteristic polynomials observed in [22]. But first recall that the coefficients of characteristic polynomials satisfy ec(K) = ∑|S|=c det(B>·,SB·,S) = ec(Λ).\nLemma 2 (Guruswami and Sinop [22]). For any c ≥ k > 0, it holds that\nec+1(K) ec(K) ≤ 1 c + 1− k ∑i>k λi.\nWith Lemma 2 in hand, we are ready to prove Theorem 1.\nProof (Thm. 1). We begin with the Frobenius norm error, and then show the spectral norm result. Using the decomposition K = B>B, it holds that\nEC [ ‖K− K·CK†C,CKC·‖F ] = EC [ ‖B>B− B>B·,C(B>·,CB·,C)†B>·,CB‖F ] = EC [ ‖B>(I − B·,C(B>·,CB·,C)†B>·,C)B‖F ] = EC [ ‖B>(I −UC(UC)>)B‖F ] ,\nwhere UCΣC(VC)> is the SVD of B·,C. Next, we extend UC ∈ Rr(K)×c to an orthogonal basis [UC (UC)⊥] ∈ Rr(K)×r(K) of RN . Using that I − UC(UC)> = (UC)⊥((UC)⊥)> and applying\nCauchy-Schwartz yields\nEC [ ‖B>(I −UC(UC)>)B‖F ] = EC [ ‖B>(UC)⊥((UC)⊥)>B‖F ] = EC [√ ∑i,j(b>i (UC)⊥((UC)⊥)>bj)2 ] ≤ EC [√ (∑i,j ‖b>i (UC)⊥‖22‖b>j (UC)⊥‖22)\n] = EC [ ∑i ‖b>i (UC)⊥‖22 ] = 1 ec(K)\n∑|C|=c ∑i det(B>·,CB·,C)‖b>i (UC)⊥‖22 (a) =\n1 ec(K) ∑|C|=c ∑i/∈C det(B·,C∪{i}B>·,C∪{i})\n(b) = (c + 1) ec+1(K) ec(K) .\nIn (a), we use that (UC)⊥ projects vectors onto the null (column) space of B, and (b) uses the definition of ec. With Lemma 2, it follows that\n(c + 1) ec+1(K)ec(K) ≤ c+1\nc+1−k ∑i>k λi ≤ c+1c+1−k √ N − k √ ∑i>k λ2i = c+1c+1−k √ N − k‖K− Kk‖F.\nThe bound on the Frobenius norm immediately implies the bound on the spectral norm:\nEC [ ‖K− K·C(KC,C)†KC·‖2 ] ≤ EC [ ‖K− K·CK†C,CKC·‖F ] ≤ c + 1\nc + 1− k √ N − k‖K− Kk‖F ≤ c + 1 c + 1− k (N − k)‖K− Kk‖2\nRemarks. Compared to previous bounds (e.g., [19] on uniform and leverage score sampling), our bounds seem somewhat weaker asymptotically (since as c→ N they do not converge to 1). This suggests that there is an opportunity for further tightening our bounds, which may be worthwhile, given than in Section Sec. 6.1 our extensive experiments on various datasets with Dpp-Nyström show that it attains superior accuracies compared with various state-of-art methods."

In this section, we analyze its implications on kernel ridge regression.

(4.2)\nObserve that the bias term is matrix-decreasing (in K) while the variance term is matrix-increasing. Since the estimator (4.1) requires expensive matrix inversions, it is common to replace K in (4.1) by an approximation K̃. If K̃ is constructed via Nyström we have K̃ K, and it directly follows that the variance shrinks with this substitution, while the bias increases. Denoting the predictions from K̃ by ẑK̃, Theorem 3 completes the picture of how using K̃ affects the risk.\nTheorem 3. If K̃ is constructed via Dpp-Nyström, then\nEC [√ R(ẑK̃) R(ẑ) ] ≤ 1 + (c + 1) Nγ ec+1(K) ec(K) .\nAgain, using [33], we obtain bounds that hold with high probability (Appendix A).\nProof. We build on [2, 5]. Knowing that Var(K̃) ≤ Var(K) as K̃ K, it remains to bound the bias. Using K = B>B and K̃ = B>B·,C(B>·,CB·,C) †B>·,CB, we obtain\nK− K̃ = B>(I − B·,C(B>·,CB·,C)†B>·,C)B\n= B>(UC)⊥((UC)⊥)>B ‖B>(UC)⊥((UC)⊥)>B‖F I = √\n∑i,j(b>i (UC)⊥((UC)⊥)>bj)2 I √ (∑i,j ‖b>i (UC)⊥‖22‖b>j (UC)⊥‖22)I\n= ∑i ‖b>i (UC)⊥‖22 I = νC I,\nwhere νC = ∑i ‖b>i (UC)⊥‖22 ≤ ∑i ‖b>i ‖22 = tr(K). Since (K− K̃) and νC I commute, we have\n‖(K̃+NγI)−1(K− K̃)‖22 = ‖(K̃ + NγI)−1(K− K̃)2(K̃ + NγI)−1‖2\n≤ ν2C‖(K̃ + NγI) −2‖2 ≤ ( νC Nγ )2 .\nIt follows that\n‖(K̃+NγI)−1z− (K + NγI)−1z‖2 = ‖(K̃ + NγI)−1(K− K̃)(K + NγI)−1z‖2 ≤ ‖(K̃ + NγI)−1(K− K̃)‖2‖(K + NγI)−1z‖2\n≤ νC Nγ ‖(K + NγI)−1z‖2.\nHence, √ z>(K̃ + NγI)−2z = ‖(K̃ + NγI)−1z‖2 ≤ ‖(K + NγI)−1z‖2 + ‖(K̃ + NγI)−1z− (K + NγI)−1z‖2\n≤ (1 + νC Nγ )‖(K + NγI)−1z‖2\n= (1 + νC Nγ\n) √ z>(K + NγI)−2z.\nFinally, this inequality implies that √ bias(K̃) bias(K) ≤ (1 + νC Nγ ).\nTaking the expectation over C ∼ c-Dpp(K) yields\nEC √bias(K̃) bias(K)  ≤ 1 + EC [ νCNγ ] = 1 + (c + 1) Nγ ec+1(K) ec(K) .\nTogether with the fact that var(K̃) ≤ var(K), we obtain\nEC [√ R(ẑK̃) R(ẑ) ] = EC √bias(K̃) + var(K̃) bias(K) + var(K)  ≤ 1 + (c + 1)\nNγ ec+1(K) ec(K) (4.3)\nfor any k ≤ c.\nRemarks. Theorem 3 quantifies how the learning results depend on the decay of the spectrum of K. In particular, the ratio ec+1(K)/ec(K) closely relates to the effective rank of K: if λc > a and λc+1 a, this ratio is almost zero, resulting in near-perfect approximations and no loss in learning.\nThere exist works that consider Nyström methods in this scenario [2, 5]. Our theoretical bounds could also be tightened in this setting, possibly by a tighter bound on the elementary symmetric polynomial ratio. This theoretical exercise may be worthwhile given our extensive experiments comparing Dpp-Nyström against other state-of-art methods in Sec. 6.2 that reveal the superior performance of Dpp-Nyström."

      "heading" : "5 Fast Mixing Markov Chain Dpp",
      "text" : "Despite its excellent empirical performance and strong theoretical results, determinantal sampling for Nyström has rarely been used in applications due to the computational cost of O(N3) for directly sampling from a Dpp, which involves an eigendecomposition. Instead, we follow a different route: an MCMC sampler, which offers a promising alternative if the chain mixes fast enough. Recent empirical results provide initial evidence [24], but without a theoretical analysis3; other recent works [21, 34] do not apply to our cardinality-constrained setting. We offer a theoretical analysis that confirms fast mixing (i.e., polynomial or even linear-time sampling) under certain conditions, and connect it to our empirical results. The empirical results in Section 6 illustrate the favorable performance of Dpp-Nyström in trading off time and error. Concurrently with this paper, Anari et al. [4] derived a different, general analysis of fast mixing that also confirms our observations.\nAlgorithm 1 shows a Gibbs sampler for k-Dpp. Starting with a uniformly random set Y0, at iteration t, we try to swap an element yin ∈ Yt with an element yout /∈ Yt, according to Pr(Yt) and Pr(Yt ∪ {yout} \\ {yin}). The stationary distribution of this chain is exactly the desired k-Dpp(K).\nThe mixing time τ(ε) of the chain is the number of iterations until the distribution over the states (subsets) is close to the desired one, as measured by total variation: τ(ε) = min{t|maxY0 TV(Yt, π) ≤ e}. We bound τ(ε) via coupling techniques. Given a Markov chain (Yt) on a state space Ω with\n3The analysis in [24] is not correct.\nAlgorithm 1 Gibbs sampler for c-Dpp Input: K the kernel matrix, Y = [N] the ground set Output: Y sampled from exact c-Dpp(K) Randomly Initialize Y ⊆ Y , |Y| = c while not mixed do\nSample b from uniform Bernoulli distribution if b = 1 then\nPick yin ∈ Y and yout ∈ Y\\Y uniformly randomly q(yin, yout, Y)← det(KY∪{yout}\\{yin})\ndet KY∪{yout}\\{yin}+det(KY)\nY ← Y ∪ {yout}\\{yin} with prob. q(yin, yout, Y) end if\nend while\ntransition matrix P, a coupling is a new chain (Yt, Zt) on Ω×Ω such that both (Yt) and (Zt), if considered marginally, are Markov chains with the same transition matrix P. The key point of coupling is to construct such a new chain to encourage Yt and Zt to coalesce quickly. If, in the new chain, Pr(Yt 6= Zt) ≤ ε for some fixed t regardless of the starting state (Y0, Z0), then τ(ε) ≤ t [3].\nSuch coalescing chains can be difficult to construct. Path coupling [11] relieves this burden by reducing the coupling to adjacent states in an appropriately constructed state graph. The coupling of arbitrary states follows by aggregation over a path between the states. Path coupling is formalized in the following lemma.\nLemma 4. [11, 16] Let δ be an integer-valued metric on Ω×Ω where δ(·, ·) ≤ D. Let E be a subset of Ω×Ω such that for all (Yt, Zt) ∈ Ω×Ω there exists a path Yt = X0, . . . , Xr = Zt between Yt and Zt where (Xi, Xi+1) ∈ E for i ∈ [r− 1] and ∑i δ(Xi, Xi+1) = δ(Yt, Zt). Suppose a coupling (R, T)→ (R′, T′) of the Markov chain is defined on all pairs in E such that there exists an α < 1 such that E[δ(R′, T′)] ≤ αδ(R, T) for all (R, T) ∈ E, then we have\nτ(ε) ≤ log(Dε −1)\n(1− α) .\nThe lemma says that if we have a contraction of the two chains in expectation (α < 1), then the chain mixes fast. With the path coupling lemma, we obtain a bound on the mixing time that can be linear in the data set size N.\nThe actual mixing time depends on three quantities that relate to how sensitive the transition probabilities are to swapping a single element in a set of size c. Consider an arbitrary set S of columns, |S| = c− 1, and complete it to two c-sets R = S ∪ {r} and T = S ∪ {t} that differ in exactly one element. Our quantities are, for u /∈ R ∪ T, and v ∈ S:\np1(S, r, t, u) = min{q(r, u, R), q(t, u, T)} p2(S, r, t, u) = min{q(v, t, R), q(v, u, T)}\np3(S, r, t, v, u) = |q(v, u, R)− q(v, u, T)|. Theorem 5. Let the contraction coefficient α be given by\nα = max |S|=c−1,r,t∈[n]\\S,r 6=t ∑ u3∈S,u4 /∈S∪{r,t} p3(S, r, t, u3, u4)− ∑ u1 /∈S∪{r,t} p1(S, r, t, u1)− ∑ u2∈S p2(S, r, t, u2).\nWhen α < 1, the mixing time for the Gibbs sampler in Algorithm 1 is bounded as\nτ(ε) ≤ 2c(N − c) log(cε −1)\n(1− α) .\nProof. We bound the mixing time via path coupling. Let δ(R, T) = |R⊕ T|/2 be half the Hamming distance on the state space, and define E to consist of all state pairs (R, T) in Ω×Ω such that δ(R, T) = 1. We intend to show that for all states (R, T) ∈ E and next states (R′, T′) ∈ E, we have E[δ(R′, T′)] ≤ αδ(R, T) for an appropriate α.\nSince δ(R, T) = 1, the sets R and T differ in only two entries. Let S = R ∩ T, so |S| = c− 1 and R = S∪ {r} and T = S∪ {t}. For a state transition, we sample an element rin ∈ R and rout ∈ [n]\\R as switching candidates for R, and elements tin ∈ T and tout ∈ [n]\\T as switching candidates for T. Let bR and bT be the Bernoulli random variables indicating whether we try to make a transition. In our coupling we always set bR = bT . Hence, if bR = 0 then both chains will not transition and the distance of states remains. For bR = bT = 1, we distinguish four cases:\nCase C1 If rin = r and rout = t, we let tin = t and tout = r. As a result, δ(R′, T′) = 0.\nCase C2 If rin = r and rout = u1 /∈ S ∪ {r, t}, we let tin = t and tout = u1. In this case, if both chains transition, then the resulting distance is zero, otherwise it remains one. With probability p1(S, r, t, u1) = min{q(r, u1, R), q(t, u1, T)} both chains transition.\nCase C3 If rin = u2 ∈ S and rout = t, we let tin = u2 and tout = r. Again, if both chains transition, then the resulting distance is δ(R′, T′) = 0, otherwise it remains one. With probability p2(S, r, t, u2) = min{q(u2, t, R), q(u2, u1, T)} both chains transition.\nCase C4 If rin = u3 ∈ S and rout = u4 /∈ S ∪ {r, t}, we let tin = u3 and tout = u4. If both chains make the same transition (both move or do not move), the resulting distance is one, otherwise it increases to 2. The distance increases with probability p3(S, r, t, u3, u4) = |q(u3, u4, R)− q(u3, u4, T)|.\nWith those four cases, we can now bound E[δ(R′, T′)]. For all (R, T) ∈ E, i.e., δ(R, T) = 1:\nE[δ(R′, T′)] E[δ(R, T)] = 1 2 + Pr(C2)E[δ(R′, T′)|C2] + Pr(C3)E[δ(R′, T′)|C3] + Pr(C4)E[δ(R′, T′)|C4]\n= 1 2 + 1 2c(n− c)\n( ∑\nu1 /∈S∪{r,t} (1− p1(u1)) + ∑ u2∈S (1− p2(u2)) + ∑\nu3∈S, u4 /∈S∪{r,t}\n(1 + p3(u3, u4)) )\n= 1 2c(n− c) ( 2c(n− 1) + ∑\nu3∈S, u4 /∈S∪{r,t}\np3(u3, u4)− ∑ u1 /∈S∪{r,t} p1(u1)− ∑ u2∈S\np2(u2)− 1 ) ,\nwhere we did not explicitly write the arguments S, r, t to p1, p2, p3.

If α < 1 is fixed, then the mixing time (running time) depends only linearly on N. The coefficient α itself depends on our three quantities. In particular, fast mixing requires p3 (the difference between transition probabilities) to be very small compared to p1, p2, at least on average. The difference p3 measures how exchangeable two points r and t are. This notion of symmetry is\nclosely related to a symmetry that determines the complexity of submodular maximization [41] (indeed, F(S) = log det KS is a submodular function). This symmetry only needs to hold for most pairs r, t, and most swapping points u, v. It holds for kernels with sufficiently fast-decaying similarities, similar to the conditions in [34] for unconstrained sampling.\nOne iteration of the sampler can be implemented efficiently in O(c2) time using block inversion [20]. Additional speedups via quadrature are also possible [30]. Together with the analysis of mixing time, this leads to fast sampling methods for k-Dpps."

We subsample 4,000 points from each dataset (3,000 training and 1,000 test). Throughout our experiments, we use an RBF kernel and choose the bandwidth σ and regularization parameter λ for each dataset by 10-fold cross-validation. We initialize the Gibbs sampler via Kmeans++ and run for 3,000 iterations. Results are averaged over 3 random subsets of data.\n6.1 Kernel Approximation\nWe first explore Dpp-Nyström (kDPP in the figures) for approximating kernel matrices. We compare to uniform sampling (Unif) and leverage score sampling (Lev) [19] as baseline landmark selection methods. We also include AdapFull (AdapFull) [13] that performs quite well in practice but scales poorly, as O(N2), with the size of dataset. Although sampling with regularized leverage scores (RegLev) [2] is not originally designed for kernel approximations, we include its results to see how regularization affects leverage score sampling.\nFigure 1 shows example results on the Ailerons data; further results may be found in the appendix. Dpp-Nyström performs well, achieving the lowest error as measured in both spectral\n4http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/DataSets.html\nand Frobenius norm. The only method that is on par in terms of accuracy is AdapFull, which has a much higher running time.\nFor a different perspective, Figure 2 shows the improvement in error over Unif. Relative improvements are averaged over all data sets. Again, the performance of Dpp-Nyström almost always dominate those of other methods, and achieves an up to 80% reduction in error.\n6.2 Kernel Ridge Regression\nNext, we apply Dpp-Nyström to kernel ridge regression, comparing against uniform sampling (Unif) [5] and regularized leverage score sampling (RegLev) [2] which have theoretical guarantees for this task. Figure 3 illustrates an example result: non-uniform sampling greatly improves accuracy, with kDPP improving over regularized leverage scores in particular for a small number of landmarks, where a single column has a larger effect.\nFigure 4 displays the average improvement over Unif, averaged over 8 data sets. Again, the\nperformance of kDPP dominates RegLev and Unif, and leads to gains in accuracy. On average kDPP consistently achieves more than 20% improvement over Unif.\n6.3 Mixing of the Gibbs Markov Chain\nIn the next experiment, we empirically study the mixing of the Gibbs chain with respect to matrix approximation errors, the ultimate measure that is of interest in our application of the sampler. We use c = 50 and choose N as 1,000 and 4,000. To exclude impacts of the initialization, we pick the initial state Y0 uniformly at random. We run the chain for 5,000 iterations, monitoring how the error changes with the number of iterations. Example results on the Ailerons data are shown in Figure 5. Empirically, the error drops very quickly and afterwards fluctuates only little, indicating a fast convergence of the approximation error. Other error measures and larger c, included in the appendix, confirm this trend.\nNotably, our empirical results suggest that the mixing time does not increase much as N increases greatly, suggesting that the Gibbs sampler remains fast even for large N.\nIn Theorem 5, the mixing time depends on the quantity α. By subsampling 1,000 random sets S and column indices r, t, we approximately computed α on our data sets. We find that, as expected, α < 1 in particular for kernels with a smaller bandwidth, and in general α increases with k. In accordance with the theory, we found that the mixing time (in terms of error) too increases with k. In practice, we observe a fast drop in error even for cases where α > 1, indicating that Theorem 5 is conservative and that the iterative MCMC approach is even more widely applicable.\n6.4 Time-Error Tradeoffs\nIterative methods like the Gibbs sampler offer tradeoffs between time and error. The longer the Markov Chain runs, the closer the sampling distribution is to the desired Dpp, and the higher the accuracy obtained by Nyström. We hence explicitly show the time and accuracy trade-off of the sampler on Ailerons (of size 4,000) for up to 200 and California Housing (of size 12,000) for up to 100 iterations.\nA similar tradeoff occurs with leverage scores. For the experiments in the other sections, we computed the (regularized) leverage scores for Lev and RegLev exactly. This requires a full, computationally expensive eigendecomposition. For a fast, rougher approximation, we here compare to an approximation mentioned in [2]. Concretely, we sample p elements with probability proportional to the diagonal entries of kernel matrices Kii, and then use a Nyström-like method to construct an approximate low-rank decomposition of K, and compute scores based on this approximation. We vary p from 20 to 340 on Ailerons and 20 to 140 on California Housing to show the tradeoff for approximate leverage score sampling (AppLev) and regularized leverage score sampling (AppRegLev). We also include AdapPartial (AdapPart) [28] that approximates AdapFull and is much more efficient, and Kmeans Nyström (Kmeans) [44] that empirically perform very well in kernel approximation.\nFigure 6 summarizes and compares the tradeoffs offered by these different methods on the Ailerons and California Housing datasets. The x axis indicates time, the y axis error, so the lower left is the preferred corner. We see that AdapFull, Lev and RegLev are expensive and perform worse than kDPP. The approximate variants AdapPart, AppLev and AppRegLev have comparable efficiency but higher error. On the smaller data, Kmeans is accurate but needs more time than kDPP,\nwhile on the larger data it is dominated in both accuracy and time by kDPP. Overall, on the larger data, Dpp-Nyström offers the best tradeoff of accuracy and efficiency."

      "text" : "In this paper, we revisited the use of k-Determinantal Point Processes for sampling good landmarks for the Nyström method. We theoretically and empirically observe its competitive performance, for both matrix approximation and ridge regression, compared to state-of-the-art methods.\nTo make this accurate method scalable to large matrices, we consider an iterative approach, and analyze it theoretically as well as empirically. Our results indicate that the iterative approach, a Gibbs sampler, achieves good landmark samples quickly; under certain conditions even in a number of iteratons linear in N, for an N by N matrix. Finally, our empirical results demonstrate that among state-of-the-art methods, the iterative sampler yields the best tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy."

      "text" : "To show high probability bounds we employ concentration results on homogeneous strongly Rayleigh measures. Specifically, we use the following theorem.\nTheorem 6 (Pemantle and Peres [33]). Let P be a k-homogeneous strongly Rayleigh probability measure on {0, 1}N and f an `-Lipschitz function on {0, 1}N , then\nP( f −E[ f ] ≥ a`) ≤ exp{−a2/8k}.\nIt is known that a k-Dpp is a homogeneous strongly Rayleigh measure on {0, 1}N [4, 10], thus Theorem 6 applies to results obtained with k-Dpp. Concretely, for the bound in Theorem 1 that holds in expectation, we have the following bound that holds with high probability:\nCorollary 7. When sampling C ∼ k-Dpp(K), for any δ ∈ (0, 1), with probability at least 1− δ we have\n‖K− K·C(KC,C)†KC·‖F ‖K− Kk‖F\n≤ (\nc + 1 c + 1− k\n)√ N − k + √ 8c log(1/δ) √√√√ ∑Ni=1 λ2i ∑Ni=k+1 λ 2 i ,\n‖K− K·C(KC,C)†KC·‖2 ‖K− Kk‖2\n≤ (\nc + 1 c + 1− k\n) (N − k) + √ 8c log(1/δ) λ1λk+1 ,\nwhere λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ . . . ≥ λN are the eigenvalues of K. Proof. The Lipschitz constants of the relative errors are upper bounded by √ ∑Ni=1 λ 2 i\n∑Ni=k+1 λ 2 i\nand λ1λk+1 ,\nrespectively. Applying Theorem 6 yields the results.\nFor the bound in Theorem 3 that holds in expectation, we have the following bound that holds with high probability:\nCorollary 8. If K̃ is constructed via Dpp-Nyström, then with probability at least 1− δ, √\nbias(K̃) bias(K) is\nupper-bounded by\n1 + 1\nNγ\n( (c + 1)ec+1(K) ec(K) + √ 8c log(1/δ)tr(K) ) .\nProof. Consider the function fC(K) = νC = ∑i ‖b>i (UC)⊥‖22 ≤ ∑i ‖b>i ‖22 = tr(K). Since 0 ≤ fC(K) ≤ tr(K), it follows that the Lipschitz constant for fC is at most tr(K). Thus when C ∼ k-Dpp and δ ∈ (0, 1), by applying Theorem 6 we see that the inequality νC ≤ E [νC] + √ 8c log(1/δ)tr(K) holds with probability at least 1− δ. Hence\nEC √bias(K̃) bias(K)  ≤ 1 + E [ νC Nγ ] + √ 8c log(1/δ) tr(K) Nγ\n= 1 + 1\nNγ\n( (c + 1)ec+1(K) ec(K) + √ 8c log(1/δ)tr(K) )\nholds with probability at least 1− δ."

    "abstractText" : "The Nyström method has long been popular for scaling up kernel methods. Its theoretical guarantees and empirical performance rely critically on the quality of the landmarks selected. We study landmark selection for Nyström using Determinantal Point Processes (Dpps), discrete probability models that allow tractable generation of diverse samples. We prove that landmarks selected via Dpps guarantee bounds on approximation errors; subsequently, we analyze implications for kernel ridge regression. Contrary to prior reservations due to cubic complexity of Dpp sampling, we show that (under certain conditions) Markov chain Dpp sampling requires only linear time in the size of the data. We present several empirical results that support our theoretical analysis, and demonstrate the superior performance of Dpp-based landmark selection compared with existing approaches.",
