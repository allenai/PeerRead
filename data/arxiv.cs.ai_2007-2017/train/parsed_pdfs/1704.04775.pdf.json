      "text" : "The Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a famous NP-Complete problem [1], which consists of an assignment of Boolean variables (true or false) and some clauses formed of these variables. A clause is a disjunction of some Boolean literals and can be true if and only if any of them is true. A SAT instance is satisfied if and only if all the clauses are simultaneously true. As a generalization of SAT, the Maximum Satisfiability problem (MAX-SAT) aims to maximize the number of satisfied clauses. When every clause is associated with some weight, the MAX-SAT turns to the weighted Maximum Satisfiability problem (weighted MAX-SAT) with numerous applications arising in artificial intelligence, such as scheduling, data mining, pattern recognition, and automatic reasoning [2]. According to the computational complexity theory, there’s no polynomial time algorithm for solving weighted MAX-SAT unless NPP  [1]. Hence, many heuristic algorithms capable of finding near optimal solutions in reasonable time have been proposed for weighted MAX-SAT, including GSAT [4], GLS [5], Taboo Scatter Search [6], ACO [7], and GRASP/GRASP with path-relinking[8-9].\nAs an efficient tool for heuristic design, the backbone has attracted great attention from the\nsociety of artificial intelligence in recent years. The backbone is defined as the common parts of all optimal solutions for an instance. Since it’s usually intractable to obtain the exact backbone, many approximate backbone guided heuristics have been developed for NP-Complete problems, including 3-SAT [10], TSP [11], QAP [12], et al. For SAT or MAX-SAT, some character and algorithms of backbone are in research [10, 13, 14]. And a BGWalksat (backbone guided local\n Supported by the National Research Foundation for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China\nunder Grant No. 20070141020; the Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China under Grant\nNo.20051082; the Gifted Young Foundation of Dalian University of Technology\nsearch algorithm with Walksat operator) has been developed for MAX-SAT and achieves better performance than existing heuristics [14]. However, as to our knowledge, there is no theoretical result or backbone guided heuristics reported in the literature for weighted MAX-SAT.\nIn this paper, we investigated the computational complexity of the backbone for weighted\nMAX-SAT and developed a backbone guided local search (BGLS) algorithm. Firstly, we proved that there’s no polynomial time algorithm to retrieve the full backbone under the assumption that NPP  . In the proof, we mapped any weighted MAX-SAT instance to a biased weighted MAX-SAT instance with a unique optimal solution by slightly perturbing, which is also optimal to the original instance. Based on this proof, we indicated that it’s also intractable to retrieve a fixed fraction of the backbone, by reducing any weighted MAX-SAT instance to a series of weighted MAX-SAT instances with smaller scale. Secondly, we developed a backbone guided local search algorithm with pseudo-backbone frequencies. It consists of two phases: the sampling phase records local optima to compute pseudo-backbone frequencies and the backbone phase uses such information to guide the following local search. Experimental results demonstrated that BGLS obtained better solutions than GRASP/ GRASP with path-relinking in far less time.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we gave out the definitions to weighted MAX-SAT, the backbone and the biased weighted MAX-SAT. In Section 3, we gave the proof for the computational complexity of obtaining the backbone in weighted MAX-SAT. In Section 4, we described the backbone guided local search. The experimental results were presented in Section 5. Finally, we concluded the paper in Section 6."

Given a set of Boolean variables 1 2{ , ,..., }nV x x x , a propositional formula \nis a conjunction on a set of m clauses 1 2{ , ,..., }mC C C C . Each clause iC is a disjunction of\niC literals, where each literal ijl is either a variable or its negation. A clause is satisfied if at least one of its literals evaluates to true, and the propositional formula  is said to be satisfied if all of its clauses are satisfied. The satisfiability problem (SAT) aims to find an assignment of values to the variables such that a given propositional formula  is satisfied. Formally, a SAT instance on the set of Boolean variables V and the set of clauses C can be denoted as\n( , )SAT V C .\nDefinition 2. Given a set of Boolean variables 1 2{ , ,..., }nV x x x , a propositional weighted formula  is a conjunction on a set of m weighted clauses 1 2{ , ,..., }mC C C C . Each weighted clause is associated with a positive weight ( )iw C . The weighted maximum satisfiability problem (weighted MAX-SAT) consists of finding an assignment of values to the variables such that the sum of the weights of the satisfied clauses is maximized.

      "text" : "4.1 Framework of Backbone Guided Local Search\nIn this section, we shall present the framework of backbone guided local search (BGLS) for weighted MAX-SAT. In BGSL, the local search process is guided by the backbone frequency, a group of probabilities representing the times of solution elements appearing in global optima. Since it’s NP-hard to retrieve the exact backbone, we shall use the pseudo-backbone frequency instead, which can be computed by the approximate backbone (the common parts of local optima).\nThe framework of BGLS consists of two phases. The first phase (sampling phase) [13]\ncollects the pseudo-backbone frequencies with traditional local search and the second one (backbone phase) obtains a solution with a backbone guided local search. Every run of local search is called a try. Each of two phases uses an input parameter to control the maximum tries of local search (see Algorithm 1).\nBoth of the two phases use the same local search algorithm. However, in the sampling phase, a particular step is used to sample backbone information from local optima. And the backbone phase uses this sampling to guide the following local search. Although many local search algorithms can be used as the algorithm H in Algorithm 1, we proposed an improved Walksat in practice which is originally designed for MAX-SAT [15]. Thus, some necessary modifications should be conducted for adapting it to weighted MAX-SAT."

      "text" : "In Algorithm 2, we shall present the Walksat for weighted MAX-SAT. In contrast to Walksat for MAX-SAT, some greedy strategies have been added to Algorithm 2 to fit weighted MAX-SAT. A try of Walksat needs two parameters. One is maximum number of flips that change the value of variables from true to false or inversely. The process of Walksat seeks repeatedly for a variable and flips it. When a variable is flipped, its break-count is defined as the number of satisfied clauses becoming unsatisfied. Obviously, the value of break-count will be nonnegative. And a variable with a zero break-count means the solution will be no worse than that before flipping. The other parameter is the probability for noise pick, which is used for determining when to use\nAlgorithm 1: BGLS for weighted MAX-SAT Input: weighted MAX-SAT instance ( , )wMAX SAT V C , 1n ,\n2n , a local search algorithm H\nOutput: solution *s Begin\n//sampling phase 1. *w 2. for 1i to 1n do\n2.1 obtain a solution is with H ; 2.2 sample backbone from is ; 2.3 if * ~\n),,( wsCVw i  then ii sssCVww  *\n~ * ),,,( ;\n//backbone phase 3. for 1i to 2n do\n3.1 obtain a solution is with backbone guided H ; 3.2 if * ~\n),,( wsCVw i  then ii sssCVww  *\n~ * ),,,( ;\n4. return *s ;\nEnd\nnoise pick.\nThe Walksat for weighted MAX-SAT works as follows. After an initial assignment is generated by random values, Walksat picks a clause (clause pick) from one of the unsatisfied clauses with maximum weight randomly. Then the algorithm flips one of variables of this clause under the following rules: if there’re more than one variable of zero break-count, then flip one of them randomly, otherwise flip any of variables randomly with the probability parameter (noise pick). For the case that the probability is not satisfied, pick one variable with least break-count randomly (greedy pick). Because the diversity of solutions depends on the parameter for noise pick and the static setting of it cannot react to the solving process [16-17]. So we choose a dynamic noise setting strategy (step 2.6) to set the parameter for noise pick: if the solution quality decreases, the noise parameter p will increase to (1 )p p    , otherwise p will decrease to\n/ 2p p   , where  is a predefined constant number.\nIn summary, there’re five random actions (in step 1, 2.1, 2.3, respectively) during the whole process of the Walksat for weighted MAX-SAT. And we’ll modify them in the backbone phase of BGLS (see Section 4.4)."

In this subsection, we analyze some typical instances to investigate the difference. The distance between local optima and global optima is defined as the number of different value of variables. For comparison among different instances, this distance is normalized by the total number of variables.\nThe sampling algorithm for local optima is Walksat for weighted MAX-SAT, where maximum of flips num is set to be 200 and the noise probability p is set to be 0. For every instance, the\nsampling algorithm was run for 50 times and 50 local optima were generated.

The weight of solutions is plotted against the normalized distances to global optima. From Fig. 1, we can draw the conclusion that all the normalized distances between local optima and the global optimum are between 0.4 and 0.8. It implies that local optima and global optima have common values for most of variables. Thus, some approximate backbone can be retrieved to guide local search to find better solutions.\nFurthermore, we recorded the number of every variable value in local optima and a\nprobability of true or false being chosen for every variable can be computed. For every instance, we tested whether the variables in global optima tend to take the value with higher probability. And we found that more than 70% (74% for jnh1, 70% for jnh7, 73% for jnh209, and 73% for jnh210, respectively) of all variables in global optima take the values (true or false) with higher probabilities appearing in the local optima. It implies that a priority set of values can be made of those values with higher probability.\nTo guide the Walksat for weighted MAX-SAT, two forms of information should be recorded to construct the pseudo-backbone frequencies: the frequencies of variables and the frequencies of clauses. After obtaining any local optimum, the pseudo-backbone frequencies are updated. On one hand, the frequencies of variables record the times of the variable value appearing in local optima. On the other hand, the frequencies of clauses record the times of clauses being satisfied. The pseudo-backbone frequencies will be computed in the sampling phase (see Step 2.2 of Algorithm 1)."

An initial value of a variable can be guided by the frequencies of the values. The second random is in Step 2.1. In pseudo-backbone, the frequencies of clauses satisfied in local optima have been recorded. According to this, the probability of each clause being satisfied can be computed to direct which clause should be firstly satisfied. And then Step 2.3 includes three remaining random choices.

In this experiment, we use identical parameters for both phases with 50 tries and 400 flips.\nSince the best heuristics (GRASP/GRASP with path-relinking [8-9]) for weighted MAX-SAT are tested on distinct experimental platforms, we conducted a system performance conversion according to SPEC [19].

And the last column “Improvement” means the improvement of BGLS over GRASP, which is computed through dividing difference between the weight of BGLS and GRASP by the weight of global optima.

      "text" : "In this paper, analytical results on the backbone in weighted MAX-SAT were presented in this paper. We showed that it is intractable to retrieve the backbone in weighted MAX-SAT with any performance guarantee under the assumption that P NP . And a backbone guided local search algorithm was proposed for weighted MAX-SAT.\nResults of this paper imply a new way to incorporate the backbone in heuristics. The approximate backbone used to guide the flipping of literals in those local search based heuristics [9, 13, 14]. However, a multilevel strategy was introduced in the proof of Theorem 2. According to the proof, a new smaller weighted MAX-SAT instance could be constructed after a literal being fixed. By such a way, we can gradually reduce the original weighted MAX-SAT instance to a series of weighted MAX-SAT instances with less variables and clauses. Conversely, the solution to the original instance could be reconstructed with solutions of those reduced weighted MAX-SAT instances and fixed literals.\nMany local search operators can apply on the BGLS for adapting with different problems. For weighted MAX-SAT, we used an improved Walksat to obtain local optima. Related to the common local search, BGLS heavily depends on the backbone sampled to simplify the scale of problems and to intensify local search. The process of retrieving backbone is to collect the feature from local optima. A note to design the similar algorithm is that a backbone guided algorithm can work well if and only if the local optima and the global optimum have the certain common parts.\nIn the future work, some interesting things remain to be investigated. Firstly, it needs further work on computational complexity for retrieving the backbone in the SAT. Although weighted MAX-SAT is a generalization of the SAT, it is not straightforward to prove the NP-hardness of retrieving the backbone in the SAT. The difficulty lies on the fact that the SAT isn’t an optimization problem like weighted MAX-SAT but a typical combinatorial problem instead. For weighted MAX-SAT, we can always construct a weighted MAX-SAT instance with a unique optimal solution (i.e., the backbone) by slightly perturbing. However, such a method could not be directly applied to the SAT. Secondly, the ways for approximating the backbone are to be further explored. The backbone was approximated by the common parts of local optimal solutions [9, 13,\n14]. However, we argue that there may exist better ways for approximating the backbone in weighted MAX-SAT. A good example of approximating the backbone by novel ways can be found in the traveling salesman problem (TSP) [20]. They proposed four strategies for approximating the backbone other than by the common parts of local optimal solutions: Minimum Spanning Tree, Nearest Neighbor, Lighter Than Median, and Close Pairs. By those new strategies, they claimed that very large TSP instances can be tackled with current state-of-the-art evolutionary local search heuristics. Inspired by their work, we shall approximate the backbone in weighted MAX-SAT in the future, by some similar methods which are generally exploited by exact algorithms.\nAppendix\nAccording to Tab. 2, the performance conversion from SPEC shows as follows: SGI Altix\n3700: Intel 865P = 510/32.5 = 15.6923 > 15.69.\nTab. 2: Benchmark from SPEC\nSGI Altix 3700 Bx2 (1600 MHz 6M L3 Itaninum 2) Intel 865P (2.8 GHz Pentium D)\nCINT 2000 Rates 510 32.5"
