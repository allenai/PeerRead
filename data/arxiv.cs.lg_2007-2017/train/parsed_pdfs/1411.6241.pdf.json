      "text" : "Data clustering is a fundamental research topic that is widely used for many applications in the fields of artificial intelligence, statistics and the social sciences (Jain, Murty, and Flynn 1999)(Jain and Dubes 1988a)(Girolami 2002)(Ye, Zhao, and Liu 2007a). The purpose of clustering is to partition the original data points into various groups so that data points within the same cluster are dense while those in different clusters are far apart (Jain and Dubes 1988b)(Filippone et al. 2008a) (Chang et al. 2015).\nAmong various implementations of clustering, k-means is one of the most popular in reality because of its simplicity and effectiveness (Wu et al. 2012). The general procedure of traditional k-means (TKM) is to randomly initialize c clustering centers, assign each data point to its nearest cluster and compute a new clustering center. Current researchers claim the curse of dimensionality may deteriorate the performance of TKM (Ding and Li 2007). A straight-forward solution to this problem is to project original datasets to\nCopyright c© 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\na low-dimensional subspace by dimensionality reduction, i.e., PCA, before performing TKM. Discriminative analysis has proven effective in enhancing clustering performance (Ding and Li 2007) (la Torre, Fernando, and Kanade 2006) (Ye, Zhao, and Liu 2007b). Thus, discriminative k-means (DKM) (Ye, Zhao, and Wu 2007) is proposed as a way to incorporate discriminative analysis and clustering into a single framework to formalize clustering as a trace maximization problem. However, TKM and DKM fail to take lowdimensional manifold structure of data into consideration.\nOn a further note, spectral clustering (SC) (Yu and Shi 2003) (Filippone et al. 2008b) (Shi and Malik 2000) has gradually attracted increasing research attention for its capacity to mine intrinsic data geometric structures, which facilitates partitioning data with more complicated structures (Belkin and Niyogi 2003) (Yang et al. 2011) (Nie et al. 2009) (Wu and Schlkopf 2006) (Yang et al. 2010). The basic idea of SC is to find a cluster assignment of data points by adopting a spectrum of the similarity matrix that leverages the nonlinear and lowdimensional manifold structure of original data. Inspired by the benefits of spectral clustering, different variants of the SC method have been proposed to demonstrate its effectiveness. For example, local learning-based clustering (LLC) (Wu and Schlkopf 2006) utilizes a kernel regression model for label prediction based on the assumption that the class label of a data point can be determined by its neighbors. Similarly, self-tuning SC (Zelnik-Manor and Perona 2004) is able to tune parameters automatically in an unsupervised scenario. Normalized cuts are capable of balancing the volume of clusters for the usage of data density information (Shi and Malik 2000).\nLabel propagation has been shown effective in propagating labels through the dataset along high density areas defined by unlabeled data in (Zhu and Ghahramani 2002) (Wang and Zhang 2008). Central to label propagation is the following cluster assumption (Chapelle, Weston, and Schlkopf 2002): (1) nearby data points are likely to belong to the same cluster; and (2) data points on the same structures are likely to have the same label. Motivated by the benefits inherent to label propagation, we intend to introduce label propagation into the field of spectral clustering(Kang, Jin, and Sukthankar 2006)\n(Cao, Luo, and Huang 2008) (Cheng, Liu, and Yang 2009).\nOur proposed spectral clustering algorithm therefore combines the strengths of spectral clustering and label propagation. The main process of our algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. We first perform standard spectral clustering on our original dataset and obtain c clusters. Then, we select k data points that are respectively close to each cluster center and form label matrix Y . By way of manifold learning, we propagate labels through dense unlabeled data regions. We call the proposed method improved Spectral Clustering via embedded Label Propagation (SCLP).\nThe main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time spectral clustering and embedded label propagation have been incorporated into a single framework. We propagate the labels obtained by spectral clustering to other unlabeled data points.\n2. We integrate the advantage of manifold learning, which is capable of leveraging manifold structure among data points, into the proposed framework.\n3. A novel distance-consistent Locally Linear Embedding is proposed herein as well. Unlike a traditional Guassian graph approach, the proposed graph is parameter-free.\n4. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed spectral clustering framework (SCLP) outperforms state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.\nAfter revisiting related work on Locally Linear Embedding and spectral clustering in Section 2, we detail our SCLP algorithm in Section 3. Extensive experiments are given in Section 4 and Section 5 concludes this paper.\nRelated Work"

      "text" : "Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) (Roweis and Saul 2000) aims to identify low-dimensional global coordinates that lie on, or very near to, a manifold embedded in a highdimensional space. The purpose is to combine the data points with minimal discrepancy after completing a different linear dimensionality reduction at each point.\nThe main procedure of LLE can be summarized in three steps: (1) build a neighborhood for each data point; (2) find the weights in order to linearly approximate the data in said neighborhood; and (3) find the low-dimensional coordinates best reconstructed by those weights.\nBy way of example, given a dataset matrix X = {x1, x2, . . . , xn}, the main steps of LLE are as follows:\n1. For each data point xi, find its k nearest neighbors.\n2. Compute the weight matrix A by minimizing the residual sum of squares to reconstruct each xi from its neighbours as such:\nmin A\nn∑\ni=1\n‖xi − k∑\nj=1\nxjaij‖22, (1)\nwhere aij = 0 if xj is not one of xi’s k-nearest neighbours, and for each data point xi, ∑ j aij = 1.\n3.

The objective of clustering is to partition X into c clusters Ci|ci=1 so as to keep data points within the same cluster close to one another, while data points from different clusters remain apart. Let us denote Y = [y1, y2, . . . , yn]\nT ∈ Rn×c as the cluster indicator matrix, where yi is the cluster indicator vector for the datum xi. The j-th element of yi is 1 if xi belongs to the j-th cluster and 0 otherwise.

      "text" : "Following the work in (Karasuyama and Mamitsuka 2013), we propose leveraging manifold regularization built upon the Laplacian graph for label propagation. To begin, we first present a novel distance-consistent Local Linear Embedding (LLE).\nIntuitively, we expect close data points to have similar labels. We create a graph in which all data points are considered nodes. If xi (xj) is in k-Nearest-Neighbor of xj (xi), then the two nodes are connected. The edge between them is weighted so that the closer the nodes are in Euclidean distance, the larger the weight aij . Because we have∑\nj aij = 1, the objective function of LLE in Eq. (1) can be safely rewritten as follows:\nmin A\nn∑\ni=1\n‖[xi, . . . , xi]aij − k∑\nj=1\nxijaij‖22, (7)\nBy way of simple mathematical deduction, we can rewrite the above objective function in this manner:\nmin A\nn∑\ni=1\n‖[xi − xi1 , . . . , xi − xik ]ai‖22 (8)\n⇒ min A\nn∑\ni=1\nTr(aTi [xi−xi1 , . . . , xi−xik ]T [xi−xi1 , . . . , xi−xik ]ai)\n(9) For simplicity’s sake, we assign all the non-diagonal elements of [xi−xi1 , . . . , xi−xik ]T [xi−xi1 , . . . , xi−xik ] to zero. The above objective function is equivalent to the following:\nmin A\nn∑\ni=1\nk∑\nj=1\n‖xi − xij ‖22a2ij (10)\ns.t. k∑\nj=1\naij = 1, aij ≥ 0\nFrom the above function, we can observe that the proposed distance-consistent LLE suggests that the edge between closer nodes has a greater weight.\nThe Lagrangian function of problem of Eq. (10) can be written as\nk∑\nj=1\n‖xi − xij‖22a2ij − γ( k∑\nj=1\naij − 1), (11)\nwhere γ is a Lagrange multiplier. By setting the derivative of Eq. (11) w.r.t. aij to zero, we have\naij = γ\n2‖xi − xij‖22 . (12)\nBy substituting the resultant aij in Eq. (12) into the constraint ∑k j=1 aij = 1, we arrive at\nγ = 1\n∑k j=1\n1\n2‖xi−xij ‖ 2 2\n.

      "text" : "After initially clustering the dataset into c clusters through traditional spectral clustering, we select k data points per cluster, which are nearest to each clustering center, and mark them as labeled data points. The remaining points are marked as unlabeled data points. Note that we assume these k data points are grouped into the proper clusters. Hence, we obtain the label matrix Y ∈ Rn×c and diagonal selection matrix U ∈ Rn×n, where Yi,j = 1 if Xi is labeled, and Xi belongs to the j-th cluster. Yi,j = 0 otherwise. Uii = ∞ if\nXi is labeled and Uii = 0 otherwise. In the experiment, we use 1010 to approximate ∞. We propose propagating labels of labeled data points to unlabeled data points.\nMoreover, we denote a predicted label matrix F ∈ Rn×c for the data points in X . According to (Nie et al. 2010), F should satisfy the smoothness on both the obtained label matrix Y and the manifold structure. Hence, F can be obtained as follows (Zhu 2006):\nmin F\nTr(FTLF ) + Tr((F − Y )TU(F − Y )), (15)\nwhere Tr(·) denotes the trace operator. The purpose of this definition is to keep the predicted labels F consistent with the ground truth labels Y .\nWe further incorporate a regularization term into the objective function to correlate the features with the predicted labels. Consequently, the objective function arrives at\nmin F\nTr(FTLF ) + Tr((F − Y )TU(F − Y ))\n+ α‖XTW − F‖2F + β‖W‖2F (16)\nwhere ‖ · ‖F denotes the Frobenius norm of a matrx. Since the least square loss function is very sensitive to outliers, we employ l2,1-norm on the regularization term to handle this issue. Hence, we can rewrite the objective function as follows:\nmin F\nTr(FTLF ) + Tr((F − Y )TU(F − Y ))\n+ α‖XTW − F‖2F + β‖W‖2,1 (17)\nIt is worth noting that the proposed framework can be readily applied to out-of-sample clustering.

    "abstractText" : "Spectral clustering is a key research topic in the field of machine learning and data mining. Most of the existing spectral clustering algorithms are built upon Gaussian Laplacian matrices, which are sensitive to parameters. We propose a novel parameter-free, distanceconsistent Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). The proposed distance-consistent LLE promises that edges between closer data points have greater weight. Furthermore, we propose a novel improved spectral clustering via embedded label propagation. Our algorithm is built upon two advancements of the state of the art: 1) label propagation, which propagates a node’s labels to neighboring nodes according to their proximity; and 2) manifold learning, which has been widely used in its capacity to leverage the manifold structure of data points. First we perform standard spectral clustering on original data and assign each cluster to k-nearest data points. Next, we propagate labels through dense, unlabeled data regions. Extensive experiments with various datasets validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to current state-of-the-art spectral algorithms.",
