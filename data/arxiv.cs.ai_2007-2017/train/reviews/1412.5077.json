The problem of supplier selection on which decision maker has usually vague and imprecise knowledge is a typical example of multi criteria group decision-making problem. The conventional crisp techniques has not much effective for solving MCDM problems because of imprecise or fuzziness nature of the linguistic assessments. To find the exact values for MCDM problems is both difficult and impossible in more cases in real world. So, it is more reasonable to consider the values of alternatives according to the criteria as single valued neutrosophic sets (SVNS). This paper deal with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach and extend the TOPSIS method to MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic information. The value of each alternative and the weight of each criterion are characterized by single valued neutrosophic numbers. Here, the importance of criteria and alternatives is identified by aggregating individual opinions of decision makers (DMs) via single valued neutrosophic weighted averaging (IFWA) operator. The proposed method is, easy use, precise and practical for solving MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic data. Finally, to show the applicability of the developed method, a numerical experiment for supplier choice is given as an application of single valued neutrosophic TOPSIS method at end of this paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 18:39:06 GMT  (547kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5077v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["r{\\i}dvan \\c{s}ahin", "muhammed yi\\u{g}ider"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5077"}
