      "text" : "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the design of AQM (Active Queue Management) controllers. The purpose of these controllers is to manage the network congestion under varying loads, link delays and bandwidth. In this paper, a new AQM controller is proposed which is trained by using the SVM (Support Vector Machine) with the RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernal. The proposed controller is called the support vector based AQM (SAM) controller. The performance of the proposed controller has been compared with three conventional AQM controllers, namely the Random Early Detection, Blue and Proportional Plus Integral Controller.

INTRODUCTION\n[3]. All algorithms have their own design and different parameters with some advantages and problems. The research is being carried out to get more and more stable controller.\nSVMs are robust classifiers and can be used in variety\nof fields where classification is required. SVMs can\npredict the unknown data. This paper introduces SAM\ncontroller that actively manages the queue using SVM\nalgorithm.\nThe remaining paper is organized as follows.

Although thebandwidth has increased a lot since last decade but still the problem of congestion occurs due to the changing nature of the traffic. A major part of the network management is the design of the new queuing techniques in the router. One such technique is known as the AQM which tries to reduce the congestion problem by intelligently managing the queue. AQM plays a major role in network congestion by controlling the network congestion and actively managing the queue. Several different algorithms are introduced in the AQM literature such as RED (Random Early Detection) [1], Blue [2] and PI (Proportional Integral)\nMehran University Research Journal of Engineering & Technology, Volume 33, No. 1, January, 2014 [ISSN 0254-7821]\n(Transmission Control Protocol) window and AQM.

At the end,\nthis section provides the SVM overview and its need in\nnetwork congestion control. Section 3 describes SAM\nand its basic design.

      "text" : "It is very essential to introduce robust algorithms to control and avoid the network congestion. It is also important to analyze the performance of the controllers under various network conditions. These algorithms are largely categorized into two. One is the algorithms that are applied in TCP like TCP Reno and TCP Vegas, for adjusting the transmission rate according to congestion feedback. Other are the AQM algorithms that are applied at link nodes, such as RED, Blue and PI for deciding which arriving packets to drop under network overload conditions.\nTCP is connection oriented and reliable protocol. TCP is the dominating protocol throughout the world due its features since last two decades. It identifies the congestion only after a packet has been dropped [4]. It uses TCP window to avoid the network congestion with slow start and gradual rise in window size if acknowledgment is received and vice versa [5].\nAQM is considered as an effective way for congestion control [6]. It effectively achieves a balance between link utilization and delay [7]. It controls the queue before queue becomes full and packet drops occurs. AQM maintains the small queues and reduces the delays. AQM\nhas natural capacity to absorb packet bursts without any drops. During overflow conditions more packets drop without AQM [8].\nThe major objectives of AQM are to maintain stable and fair queues [9]. RED, FRED, Blue, SFB and CHOKe were compared and performance of RED and Blue was found better than others in link utilization and others maintained fairness [10].\nRED algorithm was introduced by Floyd and Jacobson in 1993 [1]. It is widely used AQM controller. RED maintains two queue thresholds, such as minth and maxth. No packet will be dropped when queue is less then minth, but, if it exceeds maxth the all incoming packets will be dropped. The RED controller is composed of two major parts. First is the average queue size estimation and other is the decision function to drop the packets. The marking probability will be maintained if the queue is between minimum and maximum [8].\nRED has some major issues related with its design. If it is designed aggressively it will show extremely fast response but low margin for stability. If it is designed to be more stable it has very slow response time. RED creates a relationship between queue length and loss probability which results in steady state errors [3]. RED causes oscillations and instability due to the parameter variations [11].\nBlue algorithm was introduced by Feng, et. al. [2]. The Blue AQM controller manages queue based link ideal time and packet loss instead of queue lengths. Blue maintains a single Pm (marking probability) to mark/drop packets. Blue decreases its Pm when link is idle and increases Pm\nMehran University Research Journal of Engineering & Technology, Volume 33, No. 1, January, 2014 [ISSN 0254-7821]\nwhen it finds continuously packets drop due to buffer overflow [12].\nProblems associated with Blue are large queue size cannot\nabsorb TCP Bursts and packets have to wait (Increased\nRound Trip Time). Its performance also suffers with wide\nvariation in network load [8].\nThe PI is well known controller that is widely utilized in\nthe industry. It is highly robust and easy to understand. It\nresults in good performance under instability. PI AQM\ncontroller decides for packet dropping based on its\ndropping probability. This dropping probability is\ncalculated from old probability, current difference of queue\nlength with reference queue and old difference of queue\nlength with reference queue.\nProblems associated with PI are that, it is only suitable for\nlinear and deterministic systems and signals. Internet/\nNetwork congestion is non linear and stochastic in nature.\nThe performance of PI therefore cannot be optimal. The\nlinearization introduces modeling errors. Average queue\nlength increases as number of senders increases. It mainly\ndepends on reference queue [8].\nSVMs are one of the successful classifiers in industry\nand academia. Due to their performance and accuracy to\nsolve the complex problems they are used extensively.\nThere are two major categories of SVMs, Linear and Non-\nLinear. Their models are robust to parameter deviation\nand capable to generalize the unseen data [13,14]. They\nare also well recognized in continuous adaptive learning.\nThese features are extremely necessary in network\nenvironments [13]."

      "text" : "The idea behind this controller is to actively manage the queue using machine learning algorithm. SVMs are machine learning algorithms and proven classifiers used in various fields. SAM uses SVM algorithm and its design is flexible to use different SVM kernels. This research contains only RBF kernel responses or simulation results of proposed controller with comparison to other existing controllers (RED, Blue and PI). The proposed controller uses buffer utilization (queue size) patterns for packet drop decisions. It takes the buffer utilization pattern at the time of last five packets' arrival.\nThis research also includes a method to generate the feature vector from the possible data set of buffer utilization patterns. The SAM needs model of data set after training. The SVM model is generated through training on the selected data set. The decisions of proposed controller are directly dependent on the training and provided data set for it.\nThe proposed SVM based AQM controller is written in C++ and implemented on Network Simulator - 2 (NS-2) by adding the new AQM in NS-2's queue class. This controller also uses the SVM library during execution and training. It passes model file and the queue pattern to the SVM library. SVM library classifies or decides about packet to be dropped or en-queue."

Response of Blue is the worst with lot of oscillations and high queue size than all other controllers. This causes increased round trip time. PI gradually decreases its drop rate till 110 seconds and\nremains marginally stable till the end. SAM's response is most stable and remains stable throughout the simulation.

      "text" : "This research introduces a new AQM controller based on SVM. This new controller is tested and simulated on the Network Simulator - 2 (NS-2). The proposed SVM based AQM controller is contrasted with other established AQM controllers such as RED, Blue and PI. The results show that SAM yields approximately similar performance as other AQM controllers but with an added advantage of controlled queue size. This has also been observed that SAM was stable throughout the scenario.\nFurther research can be carried out to optimize and enhance the performance of the SAM controller. In future, this AQM controller will be tested with better training models."
