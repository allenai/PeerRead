      "text" : "Sentence simplification is a standard NLP task of reducing reading complexity for people who have limited linguistic skills to read. In particular, children, non-native speakers and individuals with language impairments such as Dyslexia (Rello et al., 2013), Aphasic (Carroll et al., 1999) and Autistic (Evans et al., 2014), would benefit from the task which makes sentences easier to understand. There are two categories for the task: lexical simplification and sentence simplification. Both categories enable a paraphrasing pro-\n†Equal contribution.\ncess, turning a normal input into a simpler output while maintaining the same/similar semantics between the input and the output.\nInspired by the great achievements of machine translation, several studies treate the sentence simplification problem as monolingual translation task and achieve promising results (Specia, 2010; Zhu et al., 2010; Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2016). These studies apply the phrase-based statistical machine translation (PB-SMT) model or the syntacticbased translation model (SB-SMT). Both PBSMT and SB-SMT require high-level features or even rules empirically chosen by humans. Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) based on sequence-to-sequence model (seq2seq) (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014) shows more powerful capabilities than traditional SMT systems. NMT applies deep learning regimes and extracts features automatically without human supervision.\nWe observe that sentence simplification usually means the simple output sentence is derived from the normal input sentence with parts of terms changed, as shown in Table 1. Due to such an intrinsic character, applying machine translation methods directly is likely to generate a completely identical sentence as the input sentence, no matter standard SMT or NMT. Although MT methods indeed have advanced the research of sentence simplification tasks, there is still plenty of room for improvements. To the best of our knowledge, there are few competitive simplification models using translation models even with neural network architectures so far.\nBesides sentence-level simplification, there is lexical simplification which substitutes long and infrequent words with their shorter and more frequent synonyms by complex word identification, substitution generation, substitution selection and\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n02 31\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 7\nA pr\n2 01\n7\nother processes. Recent lexical simplification models by Horn et al. (2014), Glavaš et al. (2015), Paetzold et al. (2016) and Pavlick et al. (2016) have accumulated substantial numbers of synonymous word pairs. This makes it possible for us to simplify complex words before simplifying the whole sentence. However, even though synonyms have similar semantic meaning, they might have different usages. Replacing complex words with their simpler synonyms is an intuitive way to simplify sentences, but not always works due to potential grammatical errors after the switchings (shown in Table 1). Moreover, lexical substitution is just one way to simplify sentences. We can also simplify sentences by splitting, deletion, reordering and so on.\nFor the sentence-level simplification, we generally obtain output results with few grammar errors although it does not guarantee that they are simplified; for the lexical-level simplification, we can simplify the complicated parts of the sentences but it does not always guarantee that they are grammatically fluent. It is an intuitive and exciting idea to combine both methods together and make use of their corresponding advantages so that we can obtain simplified sentences with good readability and fluency. To be more specific, the simplification process of an input sentence is conducted in two steps. 1) We first identify complex word(s) and replace them with their simpler synonyms according to a pre-constructed knowledge base1. 2) The second step is to generate a legitimate sentence given the simplified word(s) with appropriate syntactic structures and grammar. Another key issue for the second step is that we need to maintain the same/similar semantic meaning of the input sentence. To this end, we still stick to the translation paradigm by translating the complex sentence into a simple sentence.\nIn this paper, our contributions are as follows: • We propose a two-step simplification framework to combine the advantages of both wordlevel simplification and sentence-level simplification to make the generated sentences fluent, readable and simplified. • We implement a novel constrained seq2seq model which fits our task scenario: certain word(s) are required to exist in the seq2seq process. We start from the constraint of one given word and ex-\n1A knowledge base such as PPDB contains millions of paraphrasing word pairs to change between simple words and complex words (Pavlick and Callison-Burch, 2016)\ntend the constraints to multiple given words. We evaluate the proposed method and neural model on English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia datasets. The experimental results indicate that our model achieves better results than a series of baseline algorithms in terms of iBLEU scores, Flesch readability and human judgments. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review related works, and describe our proposed method and model in Section 3. In Section 4, we describe the experimental setups and show results. In Section 5, we conclude our paper and discuss the future work."

      "text" : "In previous studies, researchers of sentence-level simplification mostly address the simplification task as a monolingual machine translation problem. Specia et al. (2010) use the standard PB-SMT implemented in Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) to translate the original sentences to the simplified ones. Similarly, Coster and Kauchak (2011) extend the PB-SMT model by adding phrase deletion. Wubben et al. (2012) make a further effort by reranking the Moses’ nbest output based on their dissimilarity to the input. Most recently, Xu et al. (2016) have proposed a SB-SMT model, achieving better performance than Wubben’s system. In general, sentence-level simplification maintains the semantic meaning and fluency but does not always guarantee the literal simplification.\nAs for word-level simplification, there are im-\npressive results as well. Horn et al. (2014) extract over 30,000 paraphrase rules for lexical simplification by identifying aligned words in English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia. Glavaš et al. (2015) employ GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) to generate synonyms for the complex words. Instead of using the parallel datasets, their approach only requires a single corpus. Paetzold et al. (2016) propose a new word embeddings model to deal with the limitation that the traditional models do not accommodate ambiguous lexical semantics. Pavlick et al. (2016) release about 4,500,000 simple paraphrase rules by extracting normal paraphrases rules from a bilingual corpus and reranking the simplicity scores of these rules by a supervised model. Thanks to their efforts, there is a large number of effective methods for identifying complex words, finding corresponding simple synonyms and selecting qualified substitutions. However, sometimes simplifying complicated words directly with simple synonyms violates grammar rules and usages.\nRecent progress in deep learning with neural networks brings great opportunities for the development of stronger NLP systems such as neural machine translation (NMT). Deep learning is heavily driven by data, requiring few human efforts to create high-level features. Specifically, the sequence-to-sequence RNN model (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Mou et al., 2015, 2016) has a remarkable ability to characterize word sequences and generate natural language sentences. However, the seq2seq NMT model still shares the problem with other MT-based methods: lack of literal simplification from time to time.\nOverall, sentence-level and word-level sentence simplification both have their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose a two-step method fusing their corresponding advantages."

Instead, we change words according to these knowpledge base and proceed to the neural sentence generation model, assuming the word substitutions are correct based on previous studies on synonym alignments. To be more specific, given an input sentence, the simplification process is conducted in two steps: • Step 1. According to previous studies on lexical substitution, we first identify complex words in the input sentence and then substitute them with their simpler synonyms; • Step 2. Given the simplified words from the first step as constraints, we propose a constrained seq2seq model which encodes the input sentence as a vector (encoder) and decodes the vector into a simplified sentence (decoder). The generation process is conditioned on the simplified word(s) and consists of both backward and forward generation.\nWe proceed to introduce the proposed constrained seq2seq model in the next section."

      "text" : "Given an input sequence x = (x1, . . . , xn), x ∈ RV and a switching word pair of a complex word xc and its simpler synonym ys, we aim to generate a simplified sentence y = (y1, . . . , ym), y ∈ RV as the output where ys is contained in y, i.e., ys ∈ y. There could be multiple constraint words and we start from the simplest situation with only one constraint word. Here n and m denote the lengths of the source and target sentences respectively, V is the vocabulary size of the source and target sentences.\nThe simpler word ys splits the output sentence into two sequences: backward sequence yb = (ys−1, . . . , y1) and forward sentence yf = (ys+1, . . . , ym). The joint probabilities of yb and yf are:\np(yb) = s−1∏ i=1 p(ys−i|ys, . . . , ys−i+1,x)\np(yf ) = m−s∏ i=1 p(ys+i|y1, . . . , ys, . . . , ys+i−1,x)\n(1) As shown in Figure 1, to generate a sequence y with a constraint ys, we first generate a sequence from ys to y1. Then, we generate a forward sequence yf conditioned on the generated sequence from y1 to ys. In this way, the output sequence is y = {y−1b , ys, yf}, where y −1 b is the reverse of yb. In our paper, we apply the bi-directional recurrent neural network (BiRNN) (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997) with gated recurrent units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014) for both the backward and forward generation process. We encode the input sequence as follows:\nzt = σ(Wzet + Uz −→ h t−1) rt = σ(Wret + Ur −→ h t−1) h̃t = tanh(Whet + Uh[rt ◦ −→ h t−1]) −→ h t = (1− zt) ◦ −→ h t−1 + zt ◦ h̃t\n(2)\nwhere et ∈ RE is the embedding vector of word xt and E denotes the word embedding dimensionality; Wz,Wr,Wh ∈ Rdim×E , Uz, Ur, Uh ∈ Rdim×dim are weight matrices2 and dim denotes the number of hidden states; −→ h t ∈ Rdim is the hidden state of BiRNN’s forward direction at time t. Likewise, the hidden state of BiRNN’s backward direction is denoted as ←− h t.\nAs last, we concatenate the bidirectional hidden states as the sentence embedding:\nht = [ −→ h>t ; ←− h>t ]> (3)\n2Bias term are omitted for simplicity\nRNN Decoder We adapt the gated recurrent unit with the attention mechanism at the decoder part, where the hidden state st ∈ Rdim is computed by:\nz ′ t = σ(W ′ ze ′ t−1 + U ′ zst−1 + Czct) r ′ t = σ(W ′ re ′ t−1 + U ′ rst−1 + Crct) s̃t = tanh(Wse ′ t−1 + U ′ s[r ′ t ◦ st−1] + Csct) st = (1− z ′ t) ◦ st−1 + z ′ t ◦ s̃t\n(4) where e\n′ t−1 ∈ RE is the embedding vector of word\nyt and E denotes the word embedding dimensionality; W ′ z,W ′ r,Ws ∈ Rdim×E , U ′ z, U ′ r, U ′ s ∈ Rdim×dim, Cz, Cr, Cs ∈ Rdim×2dim are weight matrices and dim denotes the number of hidden states. The initial hidden state s0 is computed by s0 = tanh(WshHmean), where Hmean is the mean value of all hidden states of Encoder and Wsh ∈ Rdim×dim.\nThe context vector ct is recomputed at each step by an alignment model:\nct = n∑\nj=1\nαtjhj\nαtj = exp(etj)∑n k=1 exp(etk)\n(5)\netj = a(st−1, hj)\nwhere αtj is the alignment weight implemented by a function which is an attention mechanism to align the input token xj and the output token yt. The more tightly they match each other, the higher scores they obtain.\nWith the decoder state st and the context vector ct, we approximately compute each conditional probability either in the backward sequence yb or the forward sequence yf as Eq.(7):\np(yt|y1, . . . , yt−1,x) = p(yt|yt−1, st, ct) (6)\nAccording to the Eq.(1) and Eq.(2), we in turn obtain the backward sentence yb = (ys−1, . . . , y1) and the forward sentence yf = (ys+1, . . . , ym), with the maximal estimated probability by beam search. Finally, we concatenate the reverse backward sequence yb, the simpler word ys and the forward sequence yf to output the entire sentence y = (y1, . . . ,ys, . . . , ym). Notice that ys can exist at any position in y."

We extend the single constraint into multiple constraints by a Multi-Constrained Seq2Seq model. Without loss of generosity, we define the multiple keywords as ys1,ys2, . . . , ysk and illustrate MultiConstrained Seq2Seq in Figure 2.\nWe first illustrate the situation with two simplified words, i.e., k = 2, namely ys1 and ys2. We generally take the complex word with the least term frequency as the first constrained word ys1 and use the same method as in Section 3.2 to generate the first output sentence y1 = (y11, . . . , ys1, . . . , y 1 m). In the second round of generation, we take the first output sentence y1 as the input and generate the second output sentence y2 with ys2 as the constraint. Compared with the singlepass generation with a single constraint word, we have an output sentence y2 = (y21, . . . ,ys2, . . . , ys1, . . . , y2m) with two constraint words after a two-pass generation. The relative position of ys1 and ys2 depends on the input sentence .\nWhen there are more than two constraint words, i.e., k > 2, the system architecture remains the same with more repeating passes of generation in-\ncluded (shown in Figure 2). To decode the k-th output sentence yk, we encode the output sentence yk−1 to the next word embeddings of the multiconstrained seq2seq model.\nNote that after each pass of generation, other constrained words may be deleted or simplified already. if there are complex word(s) which need to be simplified, the system will repeat the simplification process."

FK is widely used for readability. SARI evaluates the simplicity by explicitly measuring the goodness of words that are added, deleted and kept. BLEU is originally designed for MT and evaluates the output by using n-gram matching between the output and the reference. Several studies indicate that BLEU alone is not really suitable for the simplification task (Zhu et al., 2010; Štajner et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016). In many\n4The highest n-gram order of all correlation related metrics is set to 4 in our experiments\ncases of sentence simplification, the output sequence looks similar to the input sequence with only part of it simplified. Due to this situation, there is prominent insufficiency for the standard BLEU metric: even though the output sequence does not perform any simplification operations on the input sequence, it is still likely to obtain a high BLEU score. It is necessary to penalize the output sentence that is too similar to the input sentence. Therefore, the iBLEU metric is more suitable for simplification as it balances similarity and simplicity. Given an output sentence O, a reference sentence R and input sentence I , iBLEU5 is defined as:\niBLEU = α×BLEU(O,R)− (1− α)×BLEU(O, I)\n(7)\nHuman Evaluation Human judgment is the ultimate evaluation metric for all natural language processing tasks. We randomly select 120 source sentences from our test dataset and invite 20 graduate students (include native speakers) to evaluate the simplified sentences by all systems according to the source sentence. For fairness, we conduct a blind review: the evaluators are not aware which methods produce the simplification results. Following earlier studies (Wubben et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2016), we asked participants to rate Grammaticality (the extent to which the simplified sentence is grammatically correct and fluently readable), Meaning (the extent to which the simplified sentence has the same meaning as the input) and Simplicity (the extent to which the simplified sequence maintains similar meaning). All these three human evaluation metrics are in 5-points scale from lowest 0 points to highest 4 points. Note that if one generated sentence is identical to the source sentence, we rate Grammaticality with 4 points, Meaning with 4 points and Simplicity with 0 points for this target sentence."

      "text" : "The automatic evaluation results are listed in Table 2. Moses has the worst performance. It obtains a fair BLEU(O, R) score that is 28.28. But its BLEU(O, I) score is 99.62, indicating that Moses fails to simplify most of the sentences. As this failure, its FK, iBLEU and SARI scores are all quite low. SBMT has the similar performance like Moses and neither simplify the output sen-\n5α is set to 0.9 as suggested by Sun et al. (2012)\ntences nor promote the readability. The overall results of the Seq2Seq system are better than Moses and SBMT. Though its BLEU(O, R) score is little lower than Moses and SBMT, its output sentences are not mostly identical to the input sentences as its BLEU(O, I) score is only 66.94. It also achieves better FK(12.74), iBLEU(16.27) and SARI(33.16) scores than Moses and SBMT. Lexical Substitution only substitutes the complex words so that it obtains the highest BLEU(O, R) and SARI scores. But it gets the worst FK readability. In general, both Constrained Seq2Seq and Multi-Constrained Seq2Seq under our proposed framework outperform baselines. They have higher similarities to the reference and lower similarities to the input than other systems. So the iBLEU scores of our two systems are higher than baselines, which are 20.26 and 19.87 respectively. The SARI score of our two systems is also pretty high. As for FK readability, our two systems achieve the best result.\nThe human evaluation results are displayed in Table 3. Moses generates 116 sentences that are completely identical to the input sentences.\nAs the Grammaticality of the identical sentences are rated with 4 points, the Meaning with 4 points and the Simplicity with 0 points, Moses gets the highest score (3.99) both in Grammaticality and Meaning but obtains the lowest score (0.02) in Simplicity. Similar to Moses, SBMT generates 99 sentences that are not really simplified so that SBMT obtains similar results like Moses. Seq2Seq outperforms Moses and SBMT systems judged by the overall performance and obtains 3.28 in Grammaticality, 3.45 in Meaning and 0.96 in Simplicity. The results of Lexical Substitution in Meaning and Simplicity are rather high. But as shown by the score of Grammaticality, the sentences generated by Lexical Substitution contain many grammar errors which are not surprising. Our Constrained Seq2Seq and Multi-Constrained Seq2Seq outperform in Simplicity than baselines. The Meaning scores of our systems are 2.81 and 2.65. Simple English Wikipedia has a quite similar score, 2.83, which indicates that to some extent, both our systems and Simple English Wikipedia have a semantic loss when simplifying sentences. As for Grammati-\ncality, Constrained Seq2Seq is better than Lexical Substitution. Multi-Constrained Seq2Seq performs worse than Constrained Seq2Seq in Grammaticality but better in Simplicity. Judged by the overall performances, Constrained Seq2Seq and Multi-Constrained Seq2Seq outperform other off-the-shelf sentence-level simplification methods as their generated sentences are literally simplified and legitimate."

    "abstractText" : "Sentence simplification reduces semantic complexity to benefit people with language impairments. Previous simplification studies on the sentence level and word level have achieved promising results but also meet great challenges. For sentencelevel studies, sentences after simplification are fluent but sometimes are not really simplified. For word-level studies, words are simplified but also have potential grammar errors due to different usages of words before and after simplification. In this paper, we propose a two-step simplification framework by combining both the word-level and the sentence-level simplifications, making use of their corresponding advantages. Based on the twostep framework, we implement a novel constrained neural generation model to simplify sentences given simplified words. The final results on Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia aligned datasets indicate that our method yields better performance than various baselines.",
