      "text" : "Distributed representations of words or sentences have been widely used in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification [Kalchbrenner et al., 2014], question answering and machine translation [Sutskever et al., 2014] and so on. Among these tasks, a common problem is modelling the relevance/similarity of the sentence pair, which is also called text semantic matching.\nRecently, deep learning based models is rising a substantial interest in text semantic matching and have achieved some great progresses [Hu et al., 2014; Qiu and Huang, 2015; Wan et al., 2016].\nAccording to the phases of interaction between two sentences, previous models can be classified into three categories.\nWeak interaction Models Some early works focus on sentence level interactions, such as ARC-I[Hu et al., 2014], CNTN[Qiu and Huang, 2015] and so on. These models first encode two sequences with some basic (Neural Bagof-words, BOW) or advanced (RNN, CNN) components of neural networks separately, and then compute the matching\n∗Corresponding author.\nscore based on the distributed vectors of two sentences. In this paradigm, two sentences have no interaction until arriving final phase.\nSemi-interaction Models Some improved methods focus on utilizing multi-granularity representation (word, phrase and sentence level), such as MultiGranCNN [Yin and Schütze, 2015] and Multi-Perspective CNN [He et al., 2015]. Another kind of models use soft attention mechanism to obtain the representation of one sentence by depending on representation of another sentence, such as ABCNN [Yin et al., 2015], Attention LSTM[Rocktäschel et al., 2015; Hermann et al., 2015]. These models can alleviate the weak interaction problem, but are still insufficient to model the contextualized interaction on the word as well as phrase level.\nStrong Interaction Models These models directly build an interaction space between two sentences and model the interaction at different positions. ARC-II [Hu et al., 2014] and MV-LSTM [Wan et al., 2016]. These models enable the model to easily capture the difference between semantic capacity of two sentences.\nIn this paper, we propose a new deep neural network architecture to model the strong interactions of two sentences. Different with modelling two sentences with separated LSTMs, we utilize two interdependent LSTMs, called coupled-LSTMs, to fully affect each other at different time steps. The output of coupled-LSTMs at each step depends on both sentences. Specifically, we propose two interdependent ways for the coupled-LSTMs: loosely coupled model (LCLSTMs) and tightly coupled model (TC-LSTMs). Similar to bidirectional LSTM for single sentence [Schuster and Paliwal, 1997; Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005], there are four directions can be used in coupled-LSTMs. To utilize all the information of four directions of coupled-LSTMs, we aggregate them and adopt a dynamic pooling strategy to automatically select the most informative interaction signals. Finally, we feed them into a fully connected layer, followed by an output layer to compute the matching score.\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows.\n1. Different with the architectures of using similarity matrix, our proposed architecture directly model the strong interactions of two sentences with coupled-LSTMs, which can capture the useful local semantic relevances\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n05 57\n3v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n0 M\nay 2\n01 6\nof two sentences. Our architecture can also capture the multiple granular interactions by several stacked coupled-LSTMs layers.\n2. Compared to the previous works on text matching, we perform extensive empirical studies on two very large datasets. The massive scale of the datasets allows us to train a very deep neural networks. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed architecture is more effective than state-of-the-art methods."

LSTM maintains a memory cell that updates and exposes its content only when deemed necessary.\nWhile there are numerous LSTM variants, here we use the LSTM architecture used by [Jozefowicz et al., 2015], which is similar to the architecture of [Graves, 2013] but without peep-hole connections.\nWe define the LSTM units at each time step t to be a collection of vectors in Rd: an input gate it, a forget gate ft, an output gate ot, a memory cell ct and a hidden state ht. d is the number of the LSTM units. The elements of the gating vectors it, ft and ot are in [0, 1].\nThe LSTM is precisely specified as follows.\n  c̃t ot it ft   =   tanh σ σ σ  TA,b [ xt ht−1 ] , (1)\nct = c̃t it + ct−1 ft, (2) ht = ot tanh (ct) , (3)\nwhere xt is the input at the current time step; TA,b is an affine transformation which depends on parameters of the network A and b. σ denotes the logistic sigmoid function and denotes elementwise multiplication. Intuitively, the forget gate controls the amount of which each unit of the memory cell is erased, the input gate controls how much each unit is updated, and the output gate controls the exposure of the internal memory state.\nThe update of each LSTM unit can be written precisely as follows\n(ht, ct) = LSTM(ht−1, ct−1,xt).

An improved way is to introduce attention mechanism, which has\nbeen used in many tasks, such as machine translation [Bahdanau et al., 2014] and question answering [Hermann et al., 2015].\nInspired by the multi-dimensional recurrent neural network [Graves et al., 2007; Graves and Schmidhuber, 2009; Byeon et al., 2015] and grid LSTM [Kalchbrenner et al., 2015] in computer vision community, we propose two models to capture the interdependences between two parallel LSTMs, called coupled-LSTMs (C-LSTMs).\nTo facilitate our models, we firstly give some definitions. Given two sequences X = x1, x2, · · · , xn and Y = y1, y2, · · · , ym, we let xi ∈ Rd denote the embedded representation of the word xi. The standard LSTM have one temporal dimension. When dealing with a sentence, LSTM regards the position as time step. At position i of sentence x1:n, the output hi reflects the meaning of subsequence x0:i = x0, · · · , xi.\nTo model the interaction of two sentences as early as possible, we define hi,j to represent the interaction of the subsequences x0:i and y0:j .\nFigure 1(c) and 1(d) illustrate our two propose models. For intuitive comparison of weak interaction parallel LSTMs, we also give parallel LSTMs and attention LSTMs in Figure 1(a) and 1(b).\nWe describe our two proposed models as follows."

The difference between TC-LSTMs and LC-LSTMs is the dependence of information from temporal and depth dimension.\nInteraction Between Temporal Dimensions The TCLSTMs model the interactions at position (i, j) by merging the internal memory ci−1,j ci,j−1 and hidden state hi−1,j hi,j−1 along row and column dimensions. In contrast with TC-LSTMs, LC-LSTMs firstly use two standard LSTMs in parallel, producing hidden states h1i,j and h 2 i,j along row and column dimensions respectively, which are then merged together flowing next step.\nInteraction Between Depth Dimension In TC-LSTMs, each hidden state hi,j at higher layer receives a fusion of information xi and yj , flowed from lower layer. However, in LC-LSTMs, the information xi and yj are accepted by two corresponding LSTMs at the higher layer separately.\nThe two architectures have their own characteristics, TC-LSTMs give more strong interactions among different dimensions while LCLSTMs ensures the two sequences interact closely without being conflated using two separated LSTMs.\nComparison of LC-LSTMs and word-by-word Attention LSTMs The main idea of attention LSTMs is that the representation of sentence X is obtained dynamically based on the alignment degree between the words in sentence X and Y, which is asymmetric unidirectional encoding. Nevertheless, in LC-LSTM, each hidden state of each step is obtained with the consideration of interaction between two sequences with symmetrical encoding fashion."

These grid are non-overlapping. Then we select the maximum value within each grid.

We use the Stanford Natural Language Inference Corpus (SNLI) [Bowman et al., 2015]. This corpus contains 570K sentence pairs, and all of the sentences and labels stem from human annotators. SNLI is two orders of magnitude larger than all other existing RTE corpora. Therefore, the massive scale of SNLI allows us to train powerful neural networks such as our proposed architecture in this paper.\nResults Table 2 shows the evaluation results on SNLI. The 3rd column of the table gives the number of parameters of different models without the word embeddings.\nOur proposed two C-LSTMs models with four stacked blocks outperform all the competitor models, which indicates that our thinner and deeper network does work effectively.\nBesides, we can see both LC-LSTMs and TC-LSTMs benefit from multi-directional layer, while the latter obtains more gains than the former. We attribute this discrepancy between two models to their different mechanisms of controlling the information flow from depth dimension.\nCompared with attention LSTMs, our two models achieve comparable results to them using much fewer parameters (nearly 1/5).\nBy stacking C-LSTMs, the performance of them are improved significantly, and the four stacked TC-LSTMs achieve 85.1% accuracy on this dataset.\nMoreover, we can see TC-LSTMs achieve better performance than LC-LSTMs on this task, which need fine-grained reasoning over pairs of words as well as phrases.\nUnderstanding Behaviors of Neurons in C-LSTMs To get an intuitive understanding of how the C-LSTMs work on this problem, we examined the neuron activations in the last aggregation layer while evaluating the test set using TC-LSTMs. We find that some cells are bound to certain roles.\nLet hi,j,k denotes the activation of the k-th neuron at the position of (i, j), where i ∈ {1, . . . , n} and j ∈ {1, . . . ,m}. By visualizing the hidden state hi,j,k and analyzing the maximum activation, we can find that there exist multiple interpretable neurons. For example, when some contextualized local perspectives are semantically related at point (i, j) of the sentence pair, the activation value of hidden neuron hi,j,k tend to be maximum, meaning that the model could capture some reasoning patterns.\nFigure 3 illustrates this phenomenon. In Figure 3(a), a neuron shows its ability to monitor the local contextual interactions about color. The activation in the patch, including the word pair “(red, green)”, is much higher than others. This is informative pattern for the relation prediction of these two sentences, whose ground truth is contradiction. An interesting thing is there are two words describing color in the sentence “ A person in a red shirt and black pants hunched over.”. Our model ignores the useless word “black”, which indicates that this neuron selectively captures pattern by contextual understanding, not just word level interaction.\nIn Figure 3(b), another neuron shows that it can capture the local contextual interactions, such as “(walking down the street, outside)”. These patterns can be easily captured by pooling layer and provide a strong support for the final prediction.\nTable 3 illustrates multiple interpretable neurons and some representative word or phrase pairs which can activate these neurons. These cases show that our models can capture contextual interactions beyond word level.\nError Analysis Although our models C-LSTMs are more sensitive to the discrepancy of the semantic capacity between two sentences, some\nsemantic mistakes at the phrasal level still exist. For example, our models failed to capture the key informative pattern when predicting the entailment sentence pair “A girl takes off her shoes and eats blue cotton candy/The girl is eating while barefoot.”\nBesides, despite the large size of the training corpus, it’s still very different to solve some cases, which depend on the combination of the world knowledge and context-sensitive inferences. For example, given an entailment pair “a man grabs his crotch during a political demonstration/The man is making a crude gesture”, all models predict “neutral”. This analysis suggests that some architectural improvements or external world knowledge are necessary to eliminate all errors instead of simply scaling up the basic model."

We then select the pairs in which the length of questions and answers are both in the interval [4, 30], thus obtaining 220, 000 question answer pairs to form the positive pairs.\nFor negative pairs, we first use each question’s best answer as a query to retrieval top 1, 000 results from the whole answer set with Lucene, where 4 or 9 answers will be selected randomly to construct the negative pairs.\nThe whole dataset is divided into training, validation and testing data with proportion 20 : 1 : 1. Moreover, we give two test settings: selecting the best answer from 5 and 10 candidates respectively.\nResults Results of MQA are shown in the Table 4. For our models, due to stacking block more than three layers can not make significant improvements on this task, we just use three stacked C-LSTMs.\nBy analyzing the evaluation results of question-answer matching in table 4, we can see strong interaction models (attention LSTMs, our C-LSTMs) consistently outperform the weak interaction models (NBOW, parallel LSTMs) with a large margin, which suggests the importance of modelling strong interaction of two sentences.\nOur proposed two C-LSTMs surpass the competitor methods and C-LSTMs augmented with multi-directions layers and multiple stacked blocks fully utilize multiple levels of abstraction to directly boost the performance.\nAdditionally, LC-LSTMs is superior to TC-LSTMs. The reason may be that MQA is a relative simple task, which requires less reasoning abilities, compared with RTE task. Moreover, the parameters of LC-LSTMs are less than TC-LSTMs, which ensures the former can avoid suffering from overfitting on a relatively smaller corpus."

However, most of the existing methods encode two sequences with separate encoders, in which a sentence is encoded with little or no information from the other sentence. In this paper, we propose a deep architecture to model the strong interaction of sentence pair with two coupled-LSTMs. Specifically, we introduce two coupled ways to model the interdependences of two LSTMs, coupling the local contextualized interactions of two sentences. We then aggregate these interactions and use a dynamic pooling to select the most informative features. Experiments on two very large datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed architecture and its superiority to state-ofthe-art methods.",
