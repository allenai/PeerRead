      "text" : "istribution of semantic vectors is widely used in text semantic expression, including text classification, text clustering, semantic retrieval, automatic question and answer, dictionary generation, semantic disambiguation, query expansion, text advertisements and machine translation, especially for measuring semantic relevance[1, 2]. We divided the DSMs into two categories, one we called count-based models, many traditional DSMs belong to this category, the other category we call prediction-based models, which are based on neural embedding\nAmong the traditional count-based models the best know is Latent Semantic Analysis. LSA is a low dimensional semantic space for texts, and LSA derive the document vector by the use of co-occurrence information between words[3]. More recently, LDA has received more and more extensive attention, as a semantic model of DSMs[4, 5]. LDA is a three-layer Bayesian probability model proposed by Blei et al in 2003, which contains the three layers structure of document, topic and word. Document to topic subjects to Dirichlet distribution, topic to word subjects to polynomial distribution. LDA semantic model usually shows very good performance on NLP tasks, partly because it projects the document into a low-dimensional topic semantic space. Word frequencies determine the topic of calculated and deducted by LDA largely, which leads less frequent but important topics can not be effectively calculated.\nPointwise mutual information(PMI) has been extensively uesd as count-based model in distributional sematic models. Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) is the popular word co-occurrence based measure[6, 7]. PMI has a well-known tendency that it calculates too high scores for low frequency words[2]. To solve the limitation fo PMI, many variants of it have been proposed, PPMI is the simple one of the variants, in which all PMI values that below zero will be set to zero[8]. Bullinaria and Levydem demonstrate that PPMI outperforms various other weighting methods ， when measuring semantic similarity through word-context matrices.[9]. Traditional distributional Semantic Models achieve considerable effective effects on various NLP tasks, including semantic relevance and text classification. The last few years have seen the development of prediction-based neural embedding models in which words are embedded into a low dimensional space. Word embedding models can efficiently learn word vector from a large number of unstructured text, and can effectively reflect the syntactic or semantic relations between words[10]. The initial pioneering research work was started by Bengio and his colleagues, who generated word vectors in the study of the neural language model[11] and a number of subsequent research work including various word embedding models and efficient learning algorithms[12-16]. In particular, We notice a conclusion that the SGNS(skip-gram with negativesampling)model which is efficient to provides competitive results on various NLP tasks, which is concluded in a sequence of papers by Mikolov and colleagues[14, 17]. The SGNS model maximizes the conditional probability of the observed contexts given the current word when scanning through the corpus, however it is not clear what information the embedding vectors really convey, so prediction-based neural embeddings are considered opaque. The researchers have different conclusions on the various types of distributed semantic models applying to the performance of NLP tasks, some of these conclusions ————————————————  F. A.

D\n2 are the same, some are the opposite, some conclusions depend on the distributed semantic models application of specific NLP tasks . Some of the researchers have found that predictive neural embedding models have better performance than traditional counting models in calculating word similarity[9, 18], some researchers have published papers that show the traditional counting models have better performancethan than predictionbased neural embedding models on some datasets of specific NLP tasks[19-20]. So far no study has been conducted in this field about comparing the performance of count-based models and prediction neural embedding models, such as LDA, PIM(or other PMI variants) and SGNS which are representative distributional semantic models on the document classification. In this paper, We make a deep research and compare the performance of LDA, SGNS, SPPIM distributional semantic models in text categorization. The Experiment shows that whether the TSVD method or the ISVD method get the poor performance than the PPMI method in the similaraty task in the low frequency range[21]. Especially, the ISVD method get the worst results. The paper analyzed these results as that ISVD removed the latent dimension vectors which have the largest variance, that are no doubt the most important dimensions for fairly low frequent item. Inspired by the paper insight, we propose a WL-SPPIM semantic model based on SPPIM model empirically. Different with SPPIM: 1) We make some changes on one term in the formula that produces the PMI matric, by replacing the ( )P c with 3 4 ( )p c ; 2) we reweight the probility of the low frequency word by merging the probability of the high frequency words into the probility of the low frequency words. The experimental results show that, on the document classification, WL-SPPIM yields better results than LDA, SGNS, SPPIM on the accuracy and expansibility. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the LDA, SGNS, SPPIM semantic models for document classification; Section 3 describes the proposed WL-SPPIM semantic model for document classification; Section 4 presents the experiments; Section 5 discusses the result; and Section 6 conclusions the paper and suggests the future work direction."

      "text" : "The traditional way to represent words in the distributional approach is to construct a high dimensional sparse matrix M , where each row represents a word w and each column represents a context c . The value of each matrix cell ijM represents the association between the word iw and the context jc . A popular measure of thisassociation is pointwise mutual information(PMI)[6]. PMI is calculated empirically like:\n# ( , ) ( , ) lo g # ( ) # ( ) w c D PM I w c w c  g\n(4)\nD is the number of observed word and context pairs. In terms of negative PMI values may not positively contribute to model performance and sparser matrices are more computationally tractable[2], a sparse and consistent alternative is to use PPMI matric.

      "text" : "The Shifted PPMI performs slightly better than SGNS derived vectors on two datasets , but performs poorly than the latter on one dataset of text classification tasks(see section 4).\nAccording to the algorithm illustrated in[17], the negative contexts are sampled according to the formula\n3 4 3 4 #( ) cp c\nz  instead of the unigram distribution\n# ( )c z , so we modify the SPPIM formulation :\n3 4( , ) max( ( , ) log ,0)SPPMI w c PMI w c k  (8)\nThe SPPIM underperforms than the SGNS on the one dataset on text classification task(see section 4), one of the main reason is that SGNS performs weighted matrix factorization. Inspired by this, we propose the WL-SPPIM approach. The probabilities of the low frequency words are generally underestimated in terms of the lack of occurrences in the training datan, and estimating the probabilities of words that absent in corpus is simply impossible. However, these words are often important entity names that should be emphasized, so we have a idea that transform some information from high frequency words to enhance the weight of the lowfrequency words. Given a set of words\n 1 2, , , mW x x x K to be enhanced, for each word ix W , a set of words  1 2, ,i nS y y y K that are similar\nto ix is manually selected from the training data. The similarity can be defined with semantic. We assume that, for each j iy S , if there exist an n-gram of jy in the training corpora, the corresponding n-gram of ix should also have a relative higher probability of appearance.

The experiments were conducted with three datasets:20 Newsgroups dataset that was originally collected by Ken Lang1, WebKB dataset that was collected by the project of the CMU2, and Reuters dataset published by DavidD Lewis3. Table 3 lists the statistics of these three datasets. 20Newsgroups corpus contain 20 categories of English news text, which contains a total of 18846 Document. In addition,in order to improve the reliability of experiment, all repeat documents and some news heads are removed, which left 11293 and 7528 documents to the training data and testing data. Original WebKB corpus contains about 8,300 English websites, which can be divided into 7 categories. Selecting the most commonly used 4 major categories, including student, faculty, course and project categories, this text subset is called WebKB-4. In addition, in order to improve the reliability of experiment, some repeat documents are removed, which left 2756 and 1375 documents to the training set and testing set.

The shift caused by 1k  can be applied to distributional methods through shifted PPMI. SPPMI achieve good performance with lower values of k , what is due to the fact that only positive values are retained, and high values of k may cause too much loss of information[22]. Empirically, we take experiment with values of 5k  . At first, We experiment these models with different classifiers on 20newsgroups, and the results about classification accuracy are depicted in Table 2. We conduct this experiment with 50-dimension on the word vector in the SGNS and the topics in the LDA, then the dimensions of the document vectors will be 50-dimension with four approaches. We observe that KNN method outperforms the other two, when the three classifiers are compared, which the result is showed in Table 2. Nevertheless, KNN is a nonparametric method, which is not suitable for large corpus, so we choose SVM as the classifier which will be used in the following experiments.\n5\nThe second experiment compared the performances of the four models on document classification of different complexity. Figure 4 shows that text feature dimension is set at 200 dimensions, and classification complexity is increased from two-level classification to 20-level classification in 20Newsgroups dataset, and from twolevel classification to 4-level classification in WebKB\ndataset to test the performance of the classification task complexity of the four models in each classification task. For each classification task, LDA, SPPIM and WL-SPPIM should retrain parameters in corresponding training corpus, while word vector generated by word2vector tools does not depend on specific text field, so SGNS model does not retrain parameters.

      "text" : "We evaluate LDA, SGNS, SPPIM, WL-SPPIM on the text classification task. The comparison of these four models in terms of the text classification accuracy is seen in Fig 1- Fig3 , the dimensionality of the document vectors varies from 10 to 300 in our experiment . Fig1-Fig3 shows the WL-SPPIM model achieves its best performs on all the datasets, WL-SPPIM outperforms SPPIM consistently. And the SPPIM is subtly better than SGNS on R52 and WebKB datasets, the accuracy of SPPIM and SGNS are very close on 20newsgroups datasets. WL-SPPIM significantly outperforms SPPIM and SGNS, verifying that re-weighting the weight of the word vector could improve the accuracy of the document classification. Given the similar performance of SPPIM and SGNS in the text classification task, the superiority of WL-SPPIM is obvious. The accuracy of LDA is much lower than that of other methods, which may be because LDA performs better with long documents[24]. It can be learned that the accuracy of the four models in classification improves with the increase of document vector dimensions, indicating document vector dimension is larger, the classification accuracy is better. However, the classification performance of LDA in WebKB data decreases sharply with the increase of feature dimensions, which is attributed to the lack of long text training corpus in the field, difficult to meet the optimization task of LDA n high dimensional vector model.\nAs to the effects of different category, one can observe that the performance of WL-SPPIM remains stable with different categories from Figure 4 The accuracy of LDA is much lower than that of other methods, which may be due to uneven distribution of topic vector in various categories and thereby leading to differences in various categories as LDA is greatly influenced by model initial value in the establishment of topic model. As the generation of document vector by SGNS combination involves the process of mean smoothing, so it is less affected by categories changing and the classification performance is stable. Similarly, reweighting the low frequency words in WL-SPPIM model is equivalent to smoothing techniques, so multiclassification experiments shows better classification performance and higher stability.\n6\nFig. 4. Experimental results with various numbers of category on 20-newsgroups\nFig. 5. Experimental results with various numbers of category on WebKB\nFrom the results revealed in Fig4 and Fig5, we can observe that the proposed method produce good accuracy on the 20newsgroups dataset and R52 dataset, but not satisfied on the WebKB dataset. Improving the weight of low-frequency words does not enhance the classification performance of WL-SPPIM model in the WebKB dataset, which may be because the WebKB dataset is relatively small, so low frequency and high frequency words meeting the requirements of similar-pair are very few.This result confirms the effectiveness and high performance of proposed method. This method could be applied on semantic tasks in specific domain where low-frequency words need to be enhanced. The experimental results reveal that our count-based model achieve better performance than predictionbased neural embedding model on the document classification task. Furthermore, these experiments not only verify the classification performance of WL-SPPIM, but also the generalization ability of WL-SPPIM."

Comparing to SGNS, although SPPMI provides a better solution, it is not necessarily better than SGNS in text classification tasks.. Based on our analysis, SGNS takes into the consideration of weight calculation during decomposition process, so it has better performance than SPPIM in some standard datasets. Inspired by this, we propose a WL-SPPIM semantic model based on SPPIM model, and experiment shows that WL-SPPIM approach has better classification and higher scalability in the text classification task compared with LDA, SGNS and SPPIM approaches.",
