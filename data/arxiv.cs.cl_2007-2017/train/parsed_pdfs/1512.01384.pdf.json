In recent years, the use of network methods to analyze language has allowed the discovery of several interesting findings, including the proposition of novel models to explain the emergence of fundamental universal patterns. While syntactical networks, one of the most prevalent networked models of written texts, display both scale-free and small-world properties, such representation fails in capturing other textual features, such as the organization in topics or subjects. In this context, we propose a novel network representation whose main purpose is to capture the semantical relationships of words in a simple way. To do so, we link all words co-occurring in the same semantic context, which is defined in a threefold way. We show that the proposed representations favours the emergence of communities of semantically related words, and this feature may be used to identify relevant topics. The proposed methodology to detect topics was applied to segment selected Wikipedia articles. We have found that, in general, our methods outperform traditional bag-of-words representations, which suggests that a high-level textual representation may be useful to study semantical features of texts.\nPACS numbers: 89.75.Fb\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWith the ever-increasing amount of information available online, the classification of texts has established itself as one of the most relevant applications supporting the development of efficient and informative search engines [1]. As the correct categorization of texts is of chief importance for the success of any search engine, this task has been extensively studied, with significant success in some scenarios [2, 3]. However, the comprehension of texts in a human-like fashion remains a challenge, as it is the case of semantical analyses performed in disambiguating systems and sentiment analysis [4, 5]. While humans are able to identify the content and semantics conveyed in written texts in a artlessly manner, automatic classification methods fail in several aspects mainly because the lack of a general representation of world knowledge. Currently, the automatic categorization of texts stands as one of the most studied applications in information sciences. In recent years, multidisciplinary concepts have been applied to assist the classification, including those based on physical approaches [3, 6–9].\nAn important subarea of the research performed in text classification is the detection of subtopics in documents [10, 11]. This task is not only useful to an-\nalyze the set of subjects approached in the document, but also to assist computational applications, such as automatic text summarization [12] and text recommendation [13]. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle the subtopic identification problem. The most common feature employed to cluster together related sentences/paragraphs is the frequency of shared words [14, 15]. While most of the works on this area considers only the presence/absence of specific words in sentences/paragraphs, only a few studies have considered the organization of words to classify documents [16]. Specifically, in this paper, we approach the text segmentation problem using the organization of words as a relevant feature for the task. The non-trivial relationships between concepts are modelled via novel networked representations.\nComplex networks have been used to analyze a myriad of real systems [17], including several features of the human language [18]. A well-known model for text representation is the so-called word adjacency (cooccurrence) model, where two words are linked if they appear as neighbors in the text. Though seemingly simple, this model is able to capture authors’ styles [19–21], textual complexity [8, 22] and many other textual aspects [18, 23, 24]. A similar model, referred to as syntactical network, takes into account the syntactical rep-\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n01 38\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nD ec\n2 01\n5\n2 resentation of texts by connecting words syntactically related. Syntactical networks shared topological properties of other real world networks, including both scale-free and small-word behaviors. These networks have been useful for example to capture language-dependent features [25]. Unlike traditional models, in this paper, we extend traditional text representations to capture semantical features so that words are connected if they are related semantically. Here, we take the view that a given subtopic is characterized by a set of words which are internally connected, with a few external relationships with words belonging to other subjects. As we shall show, this view can be straightforwardly translated into the concept of community structure, where each semantical structure can be regarded as a different network community [26]. The proposed framework was evaluated in a set of Wikipedia articles, which are tagged according to their subjects. Interestingly, the network approach turned to be more accurate than traditional method in several studied datasets, suggesting that the structure of subjects can be used to improve the task. Taken together, our proposed methods could be useful to analyse written texts in a multilevel networked fashion, as revealed by the topological properties obtained from traditional word adjacency models and networks of networks in higher hierarchies via community analysis.\nThis manuscripts is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the proposed network representation to tackle the subtopic identification task. In Section III we present the dataset employed for the task. The results obtained are then shown in Section IV. Finally, in Section V, we conclude this paper by presenting perspectives for further research on related areas."

      "heading" : "Representing texts as networks",
      "text" : "A well-known representation of texts as networks is the word-adjacency model, where each different word is a node and links are established between adjacent words [27, 28]. This model, which can be seen as a simplification of the so-called syntactical networks [25], has been used with success to identify styles in applications related to authorship attribution, language identification and authenticity verification [29–31]. The application of this model in clustering analysis is not widespread be-\ncause traditional word adjacency networks are not organized in communities, if one considers large pieces of texts. In this paper, we advocate that there is a strong relationship between communities structures and subjects. For this reason, we modify the traditional word adjacency model to obtain an improved representation of words interactions in written texts. More specifically, here we present a threefold extension which considers different strategies of linking non-adjacent words.\nPrior to the creation of the model itself, some preprocessing are applied. First, we remove stopwords, i.e. the very frequent words conveying no semantic meaning are removed (e.g. to, have and is). Note that, such words may play a pivotal role in style identification, however in this study they are not relevant because such words are subject independent. The pre-processing step is also responsible for removing other non-relevant tokens, such as punctuation marks. Because we are interesting in representing concepts as network nodes, it is natural to consider that variant forms of the same word becomes a unique node of the network. To do so, we lemmatize the words so that nouns and verbs are mapped into their singular and infinitive forms [32]. To assist this process, we label each word according to their respective parts of speech in order to solve possible ambiguities. This part of speech labeling is done with the high-accurate maximum entropy model defined in [33, 34]. Finally, we consider only nouns and verbs, which are the main classes of words conveying semantical meanings [35, 36]. In all proposed models, each remaining word (lemmatized nouns and verbs) becomes a node. Three variations concerning the establishment of links between such words are proposed:\n• Extended co-occurence (EC) model: in this model, the edges are established between two words if they are separated by d = (ω − 1) or less intermediary words in the pre-processed text. For example, if ω = 2 and the pre-processed text comprises the sentence “w1 w2 w3 w4”, then the following set of edges is created: E = {w1 ↔ w2, w2 ↔ w3, w3 ↔ w4, w1 ↔ w3, w2 ↔ w4}. Note that, if w = 1, the traditional co-occcurrence (word adjacency) model is recovered, because only adjacent words are connected.\n• Paragraph-based (PB) model: in this model, we link in a clique the words belonging to the same paragraph. We disregard, however, edges linking words separated by more than d intermediary words in the pre-processing text. This method relies on the premise that paragraphs represents the fundamental sub-structure in which a text is organized, whose words are semantically related [37].\n• Adapted paragraph-based (APB) model: the PB model does not take into account the fact that\n3 words may co-occur in the same paragraph just by chance, as it is the case of very frequent words. To consider only significant links in the PB model, we test the statistical significance of co-occurrences with regard to random, shuffled texts [38]. Given two words vi and vj , an edge is created only if the frequency of co-occurrences (k) (i.e. the number of paragraphs in which vi and vj co-occurs) is much higher than the same value expected in a null model. The significance of the frequency k can be computed using the quantity p(k), which quantifies the probability of two words to appear in the same paragraph considering the null model. To compute the probability p(k), let n1 and n2 be the number of distinct partitions in which vi and vj occur, respectively. The distribution of probability for k, the number of co-occurrences between vi and vj , can be computed as p(k) = (N ; k, n1 − k, n2 − k) (N ;n1)(N ;n2) , where (x; y1, . . . , yn) ≡ x! x1! . . . xn! 1 (x− y1 − . . . yn)! . The above expression for p(k) can be rewritten in a more convenient way, using the notation {a}b ≡ b−1∏ i=0 (a− i), (1)\nwhich is adopted for a ≥ b. In this case, the likelihood p(k) can be written as\np(k) = {n1}k{n2}k{N − n1}n2−k {N}n2{k}k = {n1}k{n2}k{N − n1}n2−k {N}n2−k{N − n2 + k}k{k}k\n= n2−k−1∏ j=0 [ N − j − n1 N − j ] k−1∏ j=0 (n1 − j)(n2 − j) (N − n2 + k − j)(k − j) . (2)\nIf in a given text the number of co-occurrences of two words is r, the p-value p associated to r can be computed as\np(k ≥ r) = ∑ k≥r p(r), (3)\nwhere p(r) is computed according to equation 2. Now, using equation 3, the most significant edges can be selected.\nFigure 1 illustrates the topology obtained for the three proposed models representing a text with four paragraphs from Wikipedia [39]. Note that the structure of communities depends on the method chosen to create the netswork. Especially, a lower modularity has been found for the APB model in this example and for this reason the organization in communities is not so clear. As we shall show, the identification of communities of extreme importance for identifying accurately the subjects.\nFrom network communities to text subjects\nThe first step for clustering texts according to subjects concerns the computation of network communities, i.e. a region of nodes with several intra-edges (i.e. edges inside the community) and a few inter-edges (i.e. edges leaving\nthe community). Methods for finding network communities have been applied in several applications [41–43], including in text analysis [44]. The quality of partitions obtained from community structure detection methods can be obtained from the modularity Q, which is defined as\nQ = 1\n2M ∑ i ∑ j ( aij − kikj 2M ) δ(ci, cj), (4)\nwhere aij denotes an element of the adjacent matrix (i.e. aij = 1 if i and j are linked and aij = 0, otherwise), ci represents the membership of the i-th node, ki = ∑ j aij\nis the node degree, M = 1/2 ∑ i ∑ j aij is the total number of edges in the network and δ(x, y) is the Kronecker’s delta. Several algorithms use the modularity to assist the identification of partitions in networks. Note that the modularity defined in equation 4 quantifies the difference between the actual number of intra-links (i.e. the links in the same community, aijδ(ci, cj)) and the expected number of intra-links (i.e. the number of links in the same community of a random network, (kikj/2M)δ(ci, cj)). Here we use a simple yet efficient approach devised in [40], where the authors define a greedy optimization strategy for Q. More specifically, to devise a greedy optimization the authors define the quantities\neij = 1\n2M ∑ v ∑ w avwδ(cv, i)δ(cw, j), (5)\n4 (a) (b) (c)\nFIG. 1. Example of networks obtained from the following models: (a) EC, (b) PB and (c) APB. The colours represent in this case the community to which each node belongs. To obtain the partitions, we used the fast greedy algorithm [40]. Note that the organization of nodes in communities varies from model to model. While in (a) and (b) the organization in communities is clear, in (c) the modular organization is much more weak.\nwhich represents the fraction of edges that link nodes in community i and j, and\nαi = 1\n2M ∑ v kvδ(cv, i), (6)\nwhich denotes the fraction of ends of edges that are linked to nodes in community i. The authors redefine Q in equation 4 by replacing δ(cv, cw) to ∑ i δ(cv, i)δ(cw, i):\nQ = 1\n2M ∑ v ∑ w\n[ avw −\nkvkw 2M ]∑ i δ(cv, i)δ(cw, i)\n= ∑ i\n[ 1\n2M ∑ v ∑ w avwδ(cv, i)δ(cw, i)\n− 1 2M ∑ v kvδ(cv, i) 1 2M ∑ w kwδ(cw, i) ] = ∑ i (eii − α2i ). (7)\nUsing the modularity obtained in equation 7, it is possible to detect communities using an agglomerative approach. First, each node is associated to a distinct community. In other words, the partition initially comprises only singleton clusters. Then, nodes are joined to optimize the variation of modularity, ∆Qij . Thus, after the first agglomeration, a multi-graph is defined so that communities are represented as a single node in a new adjacency matrix with elements a′ij = 2Meij . More specifically, the operation of joining nodes is optimized by noting that ∆Qij > 0 only if communities i and j are adjacent. The implementation details are provided in [40]. Note that our approach does not rely on any specific\ncommunity identification method. We have specifically chosen the fast-greedy method because, in preliminary experiments, it outperformed other similar algorithms, such as the multi-level approach devised in [45] (result not shown).\nGiven a partition of the network established by the community detection method, we devised the following approach for clustering the text in ns distinct subjects. Let C = {c1, c2, . . .} and Π = {π1, π2, . . .} be the set of communities in the network and the set of paragraphs in the text, respectively. If the obtained number of communities (nc) is equal to the expect number of subjects ns, then we assign the label ci to the word that corresponds to node i in the text. As a consequence, each paragraph is represented by a set of labels L(πj) = {l(πj)1 , l (πj) 2 , . . .}, where l(πj)i ∈ C is the label associated to the i-th word of the j-th paragraph (πj). The number of occurrences of each label in each paragraph is defined as\nf(ci, πj) = ∑\nl∈L(πj)\nδ(ci, l). (8)\nThus the subject associated to the paragraph πj is\ns̃(πj) = arg max ci∈C f(ci, πj), (9)\ni.e. the most frequent label is chosen to represent the subject of each paragraph. To illustrate the application of our method, we show in Figure 2 the communities obtained in a text about cars, whose first paragraph approaches the definition and invention of cars, and the remaining paragraphs present their parts.\nThe expression in equation 9 is suitable to be applied only when nc = ns. Whenever the number of expected\n5 (b) PASSENGER REPAIR REPLACE MOTOR PARKING DRIVE COMFORT USAGE MANUFACTURE AUTO PARK CART FORD PART CAR AMERICAN ROAD MOVE INDIA NUMBER CAR TRAVEL BENEFIT PRODUCTION VEHICLE FUEL INCLUDE NATURE CHINA PLACE USAGE ROAD AUTO\n(a)\nMODEL\nFIG. 2. Example of community obtained with the following models: (a) EC; and (b) PB. As expected, most of the words belong to a unique subject, while a few words lies at the overlapping region. The visualization of communities obtained with the APB model is not as good as the ones obtained with both EC and PB methods.\nsubjects is lower than the number of network communities, we adopt a strategy to reduce the quantity of communities found. To do so, the following algorithm is applied:\nData: nc, the number of communities and ns, the number of subjects. Result: A match between communities and subjects is established. while (nc > ns) do ck = label of the community with the largest overlapping region; erase all nodes from ck; detect again the community structure of the network formed of the remaining nodes; update nc; end\nAccording to the above algorithm, if the most overlapping community is to be estimated, a measure to quantify the degree of overlapping must be defined. In the present work, we defined an overlapping index, σ, which is computed for each community. To compute σ(ci), we first recover all paragraphs whose most frequent label is the one associated to community ci. These paragraphs are represented by the subset ΠD(ci) = {π ∈ Π | s̃(π) = ci}. Next, we count how many words in ΠD(ci) are associated with the community ci. The overlapping is then\ndefined as the the amount of words in ΠD(ci) which are associated to a community cj 6= ci. Mathematically, the overlapping is defined as\nσ(ci) = 1− ∑ π∈\nΠD(ci) ∑ l∈ L(π) δ(ci, l). (10)\nTo evaluate the performance of the methods, we employed the following methodology. Let s(πi) be the subject associated to the i-th paragraph according to Wikipedia. Here, we represent each different subtopic as a integer number, so that s(πi) ∈ [1, ns]. Let s̃(πi) ∈ [1, ns] be the label associated to the i-th paragraph according to a specific clustering method, as defined in equation 9. To quantify the similarity of two sets S = {s(π1), s(π2), . . .} and S̃ = {s̃(π1), s̃(π2), . . .}, it is necessary consider all combinations of labels permutations either on S or S̃, because the same partition may be defined with distinct labels. For example, if ns = 2, S = {1, 1, 2, 2} and S̃ = {2, 2, 1, 1}, both partitions are the same, even if a straightforward comparison (element by element) yields a zero similarity. To account for distinct labelings in the evaluation, we define the operator P, which maps a sequence of labels to all possible combinations. Thus, if S = {1, 1, 2, 2}, then\nP(S) = {{1, 1, 2, 2}, {2, 2, 1, 1}}.\n6 Equivalently, the application of the P to S yields two components:\nP(S, 1) = {1, 1, 2, 2} and P(S, 2) = (2, 2, 1, 1).\nThe accuracy rate, Γ, is then defined as\nΓ = max i H(S,P(S̃, i)), (11)\nwhere H(X,Y ) is the operator that compares the similarity between two subsets X = {x1, x2, . . .} and Y = {y1, y2, . . .} and is mathematically defined as:\nH(X,Y ) = ∑ i δ(xi, yi).

      "text" : "The models we propose to cluster topics in texts relies on the ability of a network to organize itself in a modular way. For this reason, we study how the modularity of networks depends on the models parameters. The unique parameter that may affect networks modularity in our models is ω, which amounts to the distance of links in texts (see definition in the description of the EC model in Section II). Note that the distance ω controls the total number of edges of the network, so a comparison of networks modularity for distinct values of ω is equivalent to comparing networks with distinct average degrees. Because the average degree plays an important role on the computation of the modularity [26], we defined here a normalized modularity QN that only takes into account the organization of the network in modules and is not biased towards dense networks. The normalized modularity QN of a given network with modularity Q is computed as\nQN = Q− 〈QS〉, (13) where QS is the average modularity obtained in 30 equivalent random networks with the same number of nodes and edges of the original network.\nIn Figure 3, we show the values of Q, QN and QS in the dataset FGS. In the EC model, high values of modularity Q are found for low-values of ω. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a modular structure is found in a traditional word adjacency network (i.e. the EC model with ω = 1) in a relatively small network. As ω takes higher values and the network becomes more dense, the modularity Q decreases. In a similar way, the average modularity 〈QS〉 obtained in equivalent random networks also decreases when ω increases. A different behavior arises for the normalized modularity QN , as shown in Figure 3(a). The modularity 〈QS〉 initially takes a low value, reaching its maximum when ω = ωmax = 20. Note that when ω > ωmax, there is no significant gain in modularityQN . A similar behavior appears in the other two considered models (PB and APB) as the normalized modularity becomes almost constant for ω > 20. Because in all models the normalized modularity takes high values for ω = 20, we have chosen this value to construct the networks for the purpose of clustering topics. Even though a higher value of normalized\n7 modularity was found for ω > 20 in Figures 3(b)-(c), we have decided not to use larger values of ω in these models because only a minor improvement in the quality is obtained for ω > 20."

We have created two additional methods based on linguistic attributes to compare the performance of networked and non-networked methods. Both methods are based on a bag-of-words strategy [1], where each paragraph is represented by the frequency of appearance of its words. To cluster the paragraphs in distinct subjects, we used two traditional clustering methods: k-means [46] and Expectation Maximization [47]. In our results, the bag-of-words strategy based on the k-means and Expectation Mazimization algorithms are referred to as BOWK and BOW-EM, respectively.\nIn Figure 4, we show the results obtained in the dataset comprising texts whose subtopics belong to distinct major topics (CGS dataset). We classified the dataset in terms of the number of distinct subtopics in each text (ns) and the total number of paragraphs per subtopic (np) (see Section III). We first note that, in all cases, at least one networked approach outperformed both BOWK and BOW-EM approaches. In some cases, the improvement in performance is much clear (see Figure 4 (d), (e) and (f)), while in others the difference in performance is lower. When comparing all three networked approaches, the APB strategy, in average, performs better than others when the number of subtopics is ns ≤ 3. For ns = 4, both EC and PB strategies outperforms the APB method.\nIn Figure 5, we show the performance obtained in the dataset comprising texts with subtopics belonging to the same major topic (FDS dataset). When one compares the networked approaches with BOW-K and BOW-EM, we note again that at least one networked approach outperformed both non-networked strategies. This result confirms that the networked method seems to be useful especially when the subtopics are not very different from each other, which corresponds to the scenario found in most real documents. The relevance of our proposed methods is specially clear when ns = 3. A systematic comparison of all three networked methods reveals that the average performance depends on specific parameters of the dataset. In most of the cases, however, the best average performance was obtained with the EC method. The APB method also displayed high levels of accuracy, with no significant difference of performance in comparison with EC in most of the studied cases.\nAll in all, we have shown that networked approaches\nperforms better than traditional techniques that do not rely on a networked representation of texts. Interestingly, a larger gain in performance was obtained in the TSS dataset, where the difference in subtopics is much more subtle. This result suggests that the proposed networked approaches are more suitable to analyze real texts, as one expects that the changes in subjects in a given text is much more subtle than variations of subjects across distinct texts. Another interesting finding concerns the variations of performance in distinct datasets. Our results revealed that there is no unique networked approach able to outperforms strategies in all studied cases. However, we have observed that, in general, both EC and APB methods performs better than the AP approach and, for this reason, they should be tried in real applications."

      "heading" : "V. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "In this paper, we have proposed a method to find subtopics in written texts using the structure of communities obtained in word networks. Even though texts are written in a modular and hierarchical manner [48], such a feature is hidden in traditional networked text models, as it is the case of syntactical and word adjacency networks. In order to capture the topic structure of a text, we devised three methods to link words appearing in the same semantical context, whose length is established via parametrization. In preliminary experiments, we have found that the modular organization is optimized when one considers a context comprising 20 words. Above this threshold, the gain in modularity was found to be not significant. We applied our methods in a subset of articles from Wikipedia with two granularity levels. Interestingly, in all considered datasets, at least one of the proposed networked methods outperformed traditional bag-of-word methods. As a proof of principle, we have shown that the information of network connectivity hidden in texts might be used to unveil their semantical organization, which in turn might be useful to improve the applications relying on the accurate characterization of textual semantics.\nIn future works, we intend to use the proposed characterization to study related problems in text analysis. The high-level representation could be employed in a straightforwardly manner to recognize styles in texts, as one expects that distinct writing styles may approach different subjects in a very particular way. As a consequence, the proposed networked representations could be used for identifying authors in disputed documents.

    "abstractText" : "Many real systems have been modelled in terms of network concepts, and written texts are a particular example of information networks. In recent years, the use of network methods to analyze language has allowed the discovery of several interesting findings, including the proposition of novel models to explain the emergence of fundamental universal patterns. While syntactical networks, one of the most prevalent networked models of written texts, display both scale-free and small-world properties, such representation fails in capturing other textual features, such as the organization in topics or subjects. In this context, we propose a novel network representation whose main purpose is to capture the semantical relationships of words in a simple way. To do so, we link all words co-occurring in the same semantic context, which is defined in a threefold way. We show that the proposed representations favours the emergence of communities of semantically related words, and this feature may be used to identify relevant topics. The proposed methodology to detect topics was applied to segment selected Wikipedia articles. We have found that, in general, our methods outperform traditional bag-of-words representations, which suggests that a high-level textual representation may be useful to study semantical features of texts.",
