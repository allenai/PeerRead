      "text" : "Recently there has been a resurgence of new structural designs for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [1, 2, 3]. Most of these designs are derived from popular structures including vanilla RNNs, Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) [4] and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) [5]. Despite of their varying characteristics, most of them share a common computational building block, described by the following equation:\nφ(Wx+Uz + b), (1)\nwhere x ∈ Rn and z ∈ Rm are state vectors coming from different information sources, W ∈ Rd×n and U ∈ Rd×m are state-to-state transition matrices, and b is a bias vector. This computational building block serves as a combinator for integrating information flow from the x and z by a sum operation “+”, followed by a nonlinearity φ. We refer to it as the additive building block. Additive building blocks are widely implemented in various state computations in RNNs (e.g. hidden state computations for vanilla-RNNs, gate/cell computations of LSTMs and GRUs.\nIn this work, we propose an alternative design for constructing the computational building block by changing the procedure of information integration. Specifically, instead of utilizing sum operation “+\", we propose to use the Hadamard product “ ” to fuse Wx and Uz:\nφ(Wx Uz + b) (2)\nThe result of this modification changes the RNN from first order to second order [6], while introducing no extra parameters. We call this kind of information integration design a form of Multiplicative Integration. The effect of multiplication naturally results in a gating type structure, in which Wx and Uz are the gates of each other. More specifically, one can think of the state-to-state computation Uz (where for example z represents the previous state) as dynamically rescaled by Wx (where for example x represents the input). Such rescaling does not exist in the additive building block, in which Uz is independent of x. This relatively simple modification brings about advantages over the additive building block as it alters RNN’s gradient properties, which we discuss in detail in the next section, as well as verify through extensive experiments.\n∗Equal contribution.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n06 63\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n1 Ju\nn 20\nIn the following sections, we first introduce a general formulation of Multiplicative Integration. We then compare it to the additive building block on several sequence learning tasks, including character level language modelling, speech recognition, large scale sentence representation learning using a Skip-Thought model, and teaching a machine to read and comprehend for a question answering task. The experimental results (together with several existing state-of-the-art models) show that various RNN structures (including vanilla RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs) equipped with Multiplicative Integration provide better generalization and easier optimization. Its main advantages include: (1) it enjoys better gradient properties due to the gating effect. Most of the hidden units are non-saturated; (2) the general formulation of Multiplicative Integration naturally includes the regular additive building block as a special case, and introduces almost no extra parameters compared to the additive building block; and (3) it is a drop-in replacement for the additive building block in most of the popular RNN models, including LSTMs and GRUs. It can also be combined with other RNN training techniques such as Recurrent Batch Normalization [7]. We further discuss its relationship to existing models, including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [8], second order RNNs [9, 6] and Multiplicative RNNs [10]."

      "text" : "The key idea behind Multiplicative Integration is to integrate different information flows Wx and Uz, by the Hadamard product “ ”. A more general formulation of Multiplicative Integration includes two more bias vectors β1 and β2 added to Wx and Uz:\nφ((Wx+ β1) (Uz + β2) + b) (3) where β1,β2 ∈ Rd are bias vectors. Notice that such formulation contains the first order terms as in a additive building block, i.e., β1 Uht−1 + β2 Wxt. In order to make the Multiplicative Integration more flexible, we introduce another bias vector α ∈ Rd to gate2 the term Wx Uz, obtaining the following formulation:\nφ(α Wx Uz + β1 Uz + β2 Wx+ b), (4) Note that the number of parameters of the Multiplicative Integration is about the same as that of the additive building block, since the number of new parameters (α, β1 and β2) are negligible compared to total number of parameters. Also, Multiplicative Integration can be easily extended to LSTMs and GRUs3, that adopt vanilla building blocks for computing gates and output states, where one can directly replace them with the Multiplicative Integration. More generally, in any kind of structure where k information flows (k ≥ 2) are involved (e.g. RNN with multiple skip connections [11] or in feedforward models like residual networks [12]), one can implement pairwise Multiplicative Integration for integrating all k information sources."

      "text" : "The Multiplicative Integration has different gradient properties compared to the additive building block. For clarity of presentation, we first look at vanilla-RNN and RNN with Multiplicative Integration embedded, referred to as MI-RNN. That is, ht = φ(Wxt + Uht−1 + b) versus ht = φ(Wxt Uht−1 + b). In a vanilla-RNN, the gradient ∂ht∂ht−n can be computed as follows:\n∂ht ∂ht−n = t∏ k=t−n+1 UTdiag(φ′k), (5)\nwhere φ′k = φ ′(Wxk +Uhk−1 +b). The equation above shows that the gradient flow through time heavily depends on the hidden-to-hidden matrix U, but W and xk appear to play a limited role: they only come in the derivative of φ′ mixed with Uhk−1. On the other hand, the gradient ∂ht∂ht−n of a MI-RNN is4:\n∂ht ∂ht−n = t∏ k=t−n+1 UTdiag(Wxk)diag(φ ′ k), (6)\n2If α = 0, the Multiplicative Integration will degenerate to the vanilla additive building block. 3See exact formulations in the Appendix. 4Here we adopt the simplest formulation of Multiplicative Integration for illustration. In the more general\ncase (Eq. 4), diag(Wxk) in Eq. 6 will become diag(α Wxk + β1).\nwhere φ′k = φ ′(Wxk Uhk−1 + b). By looking at the gradient, we see that the matrix W and the current input xk is directly involved in the gradient computation by gating the matrix U, hence more capable of altering the updates of the learning system. As we show in our experiments, with Wxk directly gating the gradient, the vanishing/exploding problem is alleviated: Wxk dynamically reconciles U, making the gradient propagation easier compared to the regular RNNs. For LSTMs and GRUs with Multiplicative Integration, the gradient propagation properties are more complicated. But in principle, the benefits of the gating effect also persists in these models."

      "text" : "To analyze the gradient flow of the model, we divide the gradient in Eq. 6 into two parts: 1. the gated matrix products: UTdiag(Wxk), and 2. the derivative of the nonlinearity φ′, We separately analyze the properties of each term compared to the additive building block. We first focus on the gating effect brought by diag(Wxk). In order to separate out the effect of nonlinearity, we chose φ to be the identity map, hence both vanilla-RNN and MI-RNN reduce to linear models, referred to as lin-RNN and lin-MI-RNN.\nFor each model we monitor the log-L2-norm of the gradient log||∂C/∂ht||2 (averaged over the training set) after every training epoch, where ht is the hidden state at time step t, and C is the negative log-likelihood of the single character prediction at the final time step (t = 50). Figure. 1 shows the evolution of the gradient norms for small t, i.e., 0, 5, 10, as they better reflect the gradient propagation behaviour. Observe that the norms of lin-MI-RNN (orange) increase rapidly and soon exceed the corresponding norms of lin-RNN by a large margin. The norms of lin-RNN stay close to zero (≈ 10−4) and their changes over time are almost negligible. This observation implies that with the help of diag(Wxk) term, the gradient vanishing of lin-MI-RNN can be alleviated compared to lin-RNN. The final test BPC (bits-per-character) of lin-MI-RNN is 1.48, which is comparable to a vanilla-RNN with stabilizing regularizer [16], while lin-RNN performs rather poorly, achieving a test BPC of over 2.\nNext we look into the nonlinearity φ. We chose φ = tanh for both vanilla-RNN and MI-RNN. Figure 1 (c) and (d) shows a comparison of histograms of hidden activations over all time steps on the validation set after training. Interestingly, in (c) for vanilla-RNN, most activations are saturated with values around ±1, whereas in (d) for MI-RNN, most activations are non-saturated with values around 0. This has a direct consequence in gradient propagation: non-saturated activations imply that diag(φ′k) ≈ 1 for φ = tanh, which can help gradients propagate, whereas saturated activations imply that diag(φ′k) ≈ 0, resulting in gradients vanishing."

      "heading" : "3.1.2 Scaling Problem",
      "text" : "When adding two numbers at different order of magnitude, the smaller one might be negligible for the sum. However, when multiplying two numbers, the value of the product depends on both regardless of the scales. This principle also applies when comparing Multiplicative Integration to the additive building blocks. In this experiment, we test whether Multiplicative Integration is more robust to the scales of weight values. Following the same models as in Section 3.1.1, we first calculated the norms of Wxk and Uhk−1 for both vanilla-RNN and MI-RNN for different k after training. We found that in both structures, Wxk is a lot smaller than Uhk−1 in magnitude. This might be due to the fact that xk is a one-hot vector, making the number of updates for (columns of) W be smaller than U. As a result, in vanilla-RNN, the pre-activation term Wxk +Uhk−1 is largely controlled by the value of Uhk−1, while Wxk becomes rather small. In MI-RNN, on the other hand, the pre-activation term Wxk Uhk−1 still depends on the values of both Wxk and Uhk−1, due to multiplication.\nWe next tried different initialization of W and U to test their sensitivities to the scaling. For each model, we fix the initialization of U to uniform[−0.02, 0.02] and initialize W to uniform[−rW, rW] where rW varies in {0.02, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6}. Table 1, top left panel, shows results. As we increase the scale of W, performance of the vanilla-RNN improves, suggesting that the model is able to better utilize the input information. On the other hand, MI-RNN is much more robust to different initializations, where the scaling has almost no effect on the final performance."

CTC is performed on top to resolve the alignment issue in speech transcription. For comparison, we also train a baseline model (referred to as LSTM+CTC+WFST) with the same size but using vanilla LSTM.

Skip-Thought is an encoder-decoder model that attempts to learn generic, distributed sentence representations. The model produces sentence representation that are robust and perform well in practice, as it achieves excellent results across many different NLP tasks. The model was trained on the BookCorpus dataset that consists of 11,038 books with 74,004,228 sentences. Not surprisingly, a single pass through\n8[7] reports better results but they use much larger models (≈16M) which is not directly comparable.\nthe training data can take up to a week on a high-end GPU (as reported in [25]). Such training speed largely limits one to perform careful hyper-parameter search. However, with Multiplicative Integration, not only the training time is shortened by a factor of two, but the final performance is also significantly improved.\nWe exactly follow the authors’ Theano implementation of the skip-thought model9: Encoder and decoder are single-layer GRUs with hidden-layer size of 2400; all recurrent matrices adopt orthogonal initialization while non-recurrent weights are initialized from uniform distribution. Adam is used for optimization. We implemented Multiplicative Integration only for the encoder GRU (embedding MI into decoder did not provide any substantial gains). We refer our model as MI-uni-skip, with {α,β1,β2,b} initialized as {1, 1, 1, 0}. We also train a baseline model with the same size, referred to as uni-skip(ours), which essentially reproduces the original model of [25].\nDuring the course of training, we evaluated the skip-thought vectors on the semantic relatedness task, using SICK dataset, every 2500 updates for both MI-uni-skip and the baseline model (each iteration processes a mini-batch of size 64). The results are shown in Figure 2a. Note that MI-uni-skip significantly outperforms the baseline, not only in terms of speed of convergence, but also in terms of final performance. At around 125k updates, MI-uni-skip already exceeds the best performance achieved by the baseline, which takes about twice the number of updates.\nWe also evaluated both models after one week of training, with the best results being reported on six out of eight tasks reported in [25]: semantic relatedness task on SICK dataset, paraphrase detection task on Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus, and four classification benchmarks: movie review sentiment (MR), customer product reviews (CR), subjectivity/objectivity classification (SUBJ), and opinion polarity (MPQA). We also compared our results with the results reported on three models in the original skip-thought paper: uni-skip, bi-skip, combine-skip. Uni-skip is the same model as our baseline, bi-skip is a bidirectional model of the same size, and combine-skip takes the concatenation of the vectors from uni-skip and bi-skip to form a 4800 dimension vector for task evaluation. Table 2 shows that MI-uni-skip dominates across all the tasks. Not only it achieves higher performance than the baseline model, but in many cases, it also outperforms the combine-skip model, which has twice the number of dimensions. Clearly, Multiplicative Integration provides a faster and better way to train a large-scale Skip-Thought model."

Clearly, using Multiplicative Integration results in improved model performance regardless of whether Batch-Norm is used.

A direct mapping can be constructed as follows (see [28] for a similar derivation). Let U ∈ Rm×m be the state transition probability matrix with Uij = Pr[ht+1 = i|ht = j], W ∈ Rm×n be the observation probability matrix with Wij = Pr[xt = i|ht = j]. When xt is a one-hot vector (e.g., in many of the language modelling tasks), multiplying it by W is effectively choosing a column of the observation matrix. Namely, if the jth entry of xt is one, then Wxt = Pr[xt|ht = j]. Let h0 be the initial state distribution with h0 = Pr[h0] and {ht}t≥1 be the alpha values in the forward algorithm of HMM, i.e., ht = Pr[x1, ..., xt, ht]. Then Uht = Pr[x1, ..., xt, ht+1]. Thus ht+1 = Wxt+1 Uht = Pr[xt+1|ht+1] ·Pr[x1, ..., xt, ht+1] = Pr[x1, ..., xt+1, ht+1]. To exactly implement the forward algorithm using Multiplicative Integration, the matrices W and U have to be probability matrices, and xt needs to be a one-hot vector. The function φ needs to be linear, and we drop all the bias terms. Therefore, RNN with Multiplicative Integration can be seen as a nonlinear extension of HMMs. The extra freedom in parameter values and nonlinearity makes the model more flexible compared to HMMs."

Moreover, MI-RNN shares parameters across the first and second order terms, whereas the other two models do not. As a result, the number of parameters are largely reduced, which makes our model more practical for large scale problems, while avoiding overfitting. (2) Easier Optimization: In tensor decomposition methods, the products of three different (low-rank) matrices generally makes it hard to optimize [10]. However, the optimization problem becomes easier in MI, as discussed in section 2 and 3. (3) General structural design vs. vanilla-RNN design: Multiplicative Integration can be easily embedded in many other RNN structures, e.g. LSTMs and GRUs, whereas the second order RNN and MRNN present a very specific design for modifying vanilla-RNNs.\nMoreover, we also compared MI-RNN’s performance to the previous HF-MRNN’s results (Multiplicative RNN trained by Hessian-free method) in Table 1, bottom left and bottom middle panels, on Penn-Treebank and text8 datasets.

MI changes the way in which information from difference sources flows and is integrated in the computational building block of an RNN, while introducing almost no extra parameters. The new structure can be easily embedded into many popular RNN models, including LSTMs and GRUs. We empirically analyze its learning behaviour and conduct evaluations on several tasks using different RNN models. Our experimental results demonstrate that Multiplicative Integration can provide a substantial performance boost over many of the existing RNN models.",
