Evaluating their inconsistency has been a widely studied and discussed topic and several\nindices have been proposed in the literature to perform this task. Since an acceptable level of consistency is closely related with the reliability of preferences, a suitable choice of an inconsistency index is a crucial phase in decision making processes. The use of different methods for measuring consistency must be carefully evaluated, as it can affect the decision outcome in practical applications. In this paper, we present five axioms aimed at characterizing inconsistency indices. In addition, we prove that some of the\nindices proposed in the literature satisfy these axioms, while others do not, and therefore, in our view, they may fail to correctly evaluate inconsistency.\nKeywords: Pairwise comparisons, inconsistency indices, axiomatic properties, analytic hierarchy pro-\ncess."

      "text" : "Pairwise comparisons have been used in some operations research methods to represent the preferences of experts and decision makers over sets of alternatives, criteria, features and so on. For simplicity, in this paper we shall speak of alternatives only, bearing in mind that it is a reductive view. The main advantage in using pairwise comparisons is that they allow the decision maker to compare two alternatives at a time, thus reducing the complexity of a decision making problem, especially when the set under consideration is large, and serve as a starting point to derive a priority vector which is the final rating of the alternatives. Pairwise comparisons have been used in well-known decision analysis methods as, for instance, the Analytic Hierarchy\nProcess (AHP) by Saaty (1977) (see Ishizaka and Labib (2011) for an updated discussion), and its generalizations, which have been proved effective in solving many decision problems (Ishizaka et al., 2011).\nIn the literature, and in practice, it is assumed that the dependability of the decision is related to the consistency of his/her pairwise judgments. That is, the more rational the judgments are, the more likely it is that the decision maker is a good expert with a deep insight into the problem and pays due attention in eliciting his/her preferences. Similarly, if judgments are very intransitive and irrational, it is more plausible that the expert expressed them with scarce competence, since he/she would lack the ability to rationally discriminate between different alternatives. This is summarized by Irwin’s thesis claiming that “...preference is exactly as fundamental as discrimination and that if the organism exhibits a discrimination, it must also exhibit a preference and conversely” (Irwin, 1958). Following Saaty (1994) the approach to decision making based on pairwise comparisons, and the AHP in particular, is grounded in the relative measurement theory and it is in this framework that Saaty (1993) too claimed that pairwise comparisons should be ‘near consistent’ to ensure that they are a sufficiently good approximation of the decision makers’ real preferences. This seems to support the importance of having reliable tools capable of capturing the degree of inconsistency of pairwise comparisons. The importance of having reliable inconsistency indices becomes even more evident when one considers that their practical use has gone beyond the sole quantification of inconsistency. For instance, they have been employed by Lamata and Peláez (2002) and Shiraishi et al. (1999) to estimate missing comparisons, by Harker (1987) to derive ratings of alternatives from incomplete preferences and by Xu and Cuiping (1999) and Xu and Xia (2013) to improve the consistency of pairwise comparisons.\nOn this fertile ground, researchers have proposed various inconsistency indices—functions associating pairwise comparisons to real numbers representing the degrees of inconsistency of the pairwise judgments. In this paper we concern ourselves with the fact that inconsistency indices have been introduced heuristically and independently from each other, neither referring to a general definition, nor to a set of axiomatic properties. Hence, this paper introduces some axiomatic properties for inconsistency indices and shows that some indices proposed in literature fail to satisfy these axioms. This paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2 we introduce preliminary notions and the notation. In Section 3 we shortly define the inconsistency indices that are studied in this paper. Next, in Section 4 we introduce and interpret five axioms and in Section 5 we present results regarding the inconsistency indices and prove that some of them satisfy the required axioms while four others do not. For a simpler description, some proofs are given in the appendix. In Section 6, we conclude the discussion of the axioms and draw the conclusions. Throughout this paper, we refer to ‘inconsistency indices’, since what they really measure is the amount of inconsistency in pairwise comparisons. Nevertheless, in literature such indices are often referred to as ‘consistency indices’, while both expressions refer to an index which estimates the deviation from consistency."

      "text" : "Pairwise comparison matrices are convenient tools to model the decision makers’ pairwise intensities of preference over sets of alternatives. Formally, given a set of alternatives X =\n{x1, . . . , xn} (n ≥ 2), Saaty (1977) defined a pairwise comparison matrix A = (aij)n×n as a positive and reciprocal square matrix of order n, i.e. aij > 0, aijaji = 1, ∀i, j, where aij is an estimation of the degree of preference of xi over xj. A pairwise comparison matrix is consistent if and only if the following transitivity condition holds:\naik = aijajk ∀i, j, k. (1)\nProperty (1) means that preferences are fully coherent, and each direct comparison aik between xi and xk is confirmed by all indirect comparisons aijajk ∀j. If and only if A is consistent, then there exists a priority (or weight) vector w = (w1, . . . , wn) such that\naij = wi wj ∀i, j. (2)\nCrawford and Williams (1985) proved that if A is consistent, then the components of vector w can be obtained by using the geometric mean method,\nwi =\n\n\nn∏\nj=1\naij\n\n\n1 n\n∀i. (3)\nAnother method for obtaining the priorities is the eigenvector method by Saaty (1977). Namely, the priority vector w is the solution of the following equation\nAw = λmaxw , (4)\nwhere λmax is the maximum eigenvalue of A whose existence and properties refer to the PerronFrobenius theorem. If A is consistent, both methods yield the same priority vector, while they may give different vectors if A is not consistent. We define the set of all pairwise comparison matrices as\nA = {A = (aij)n×n|aij > 0, aijaji = 1 ∀i, j, n > 2}.\nSimilarly, the set of consistent pairwise comparison matrices A∗ ⊂ A is defined as\nA∗ = {A = (aij)n×n|A ∈ A, aik = aijajk ∀i, j, k}.\nSeen from this perspective, a matrix can either be consistent or non-consistent (inconsistent). However, often, degrees of inconsistency are assigned to pairwise comparison matrices so that, if the inconsistency is not too high, the judgments in the pairwise comparison matrix are taken to be as sufficiently reliable. To sum up, the idea is that a good inconsistency index should indicate ‘how much’ the pairwise comparison matrix deviates from the full consistency. Thus, an inconsistency index I is a real-valued function\nI : A → R. (5)\nAlthough the codomain of the definition is the set of real numbers, each inconsistency index I is univocally associated to a given image Im(I) ⊆ R."

      "text" : "In this section we shortly recall some inconsistency indices, giving a special emphasis to those which will be analyzed in the next section with respect to the five axioms. For a survey the reader can refer to Brunelli et al. (2013a). The first index is the Consistency Index, proposed by Saaty (1977).\nDefinition 1 (Consistency Index (Saaty, 1977)). Given a pairwise comparison matrix A, the Consistency Index is defined as\nCI(A) = λmax − n\nn− 1 , (6)\nwhere λmax is the principal right eigenvalue of A.\nFormula (6) refers to the property that the maximum eigenvalue λmax of a pairwise comparison matrix A is equal to n if and only if the matrix is consistent, and greater than n otherwise. Saaty proposed also a more suitable measure of inconsistency, called Consistency Ratio (CR),\nCR(A) = CI(A)\nRI (7)\nwhere RI, Random Index, is a suitable normalization factor.\nGolden and Wang (1989) proposed a method to compute the deviations between the entries\nof a pairwise comparison matrix and their theoretical values wi/wj .\nDefinition 2 (Index GW (Golden and Wang, 1989)). Given a pairwise comparison matrix A = (aij)n×n ∈ A, the entries of every column are normalized by dividing them by the sum of the elements of their column ∑n\ni=1 aij . Let us denote by Ā = (āij)n×n the new normalized matrix.\nEach priority vector associated (by either (3) or (4)) with A is normalized by dividing each component by the sum of the components and denoted by w̄ = (w̄1, . . . , w̄n), so that ∑n i=1 w̄i = 1. The inconsistency index GW is defined as\nGW (A) = 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\n| āij − w̄i| . (8)\nCrawford and Williams (1985), and later Aguaròn and Moreno-Jimènez (2003), proposed and refined an index that also computes distances between the decision maker’s judgments and their theoretical values obtained as ratios wi/wj .\nDefinition 3 (Geometric Consistency Index (Aguaròn and Moreno-Jimènez, 2003)). Given a pairwise comparison matrix of order n, the Geometric Consistency Index GCI is defined as follows\nGCI(A) = 2\n(n− 1)(n− 2)\nn−1∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=i+1\nln2 (\naij wj wi\n)\n, (9)\nwhere the weights are obtained by means of the geometric mean method (3).\nBarzilai (1998) formulated a normalized index based on squared errors. By using open un-\nbounded scales, he stated several relevant algebraic and geometric properties.\nDefinition 4 (Relative Error (Barzilai, 1998)). Given a pairwise comparison matrix A ∈ A, the relative error, RE, is defined as\nRE(A) = 1−\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\n(\n1 n\nn∑\nk=1\nlog aik − 1\nn\nn∑\nk=1\nlog ajk\n)2\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\n(log aij) 2\n. (10)\nfor all matrices A 6= (1)n×n, and zero if A = (1)n×n.\nPeláez and Lamata (2003) defined an inconsistency index for a pairwise comparison matrix as the average of all the determinants of its 3×3 submatrices, each containing a different transitivity of the original matrix.\nDefinition 5 (Index CI∗ (Peláez and Lamata, 2003)). Given a pairwise comparison matrix of order n, the index CI∗ is\nCI∗(A) =\nn−2∑\ni=1\nn−1∑\nj=i+1\nn∑\nk=j+1\n( aik\naijajk + aijajk aik − 2\n)/( n\n3\n)\n. (11)\nShiraishi et al. (1998) proposed the coefficient c3 of the characteristic polynomial of A as an\nindex of inconsistency. Brunelli et al. (2013b) proved that index CI∗ is proportional to c3 .\nStein and Mizzi (2007) considered the general result that the columns of a consistent pairwise comparison matrix are proportional, i.e. rank(A) = 1, if and only if A is consistent. Thus, they formulated an index which takes into account how far the columns are from being proportional to each other.\nDefinition 6 (Harmonic Consistency Index (Stein and Mizzi, 2007)). Let A be a pairwise comparison matrix and sj = ∑n i=1 aij for j = 1, . . . , n. Then, the harmonic consistency index is\nHCI(A) = (HM(A) − n)(n+ 1)\nn(n− 1) , (12)\nwhere HM(A) is the harmonic mean of (s1, . . . , sn):\nHM(A) = n\n∑n j=1 1 sj\n. (13)\nKoczkodaj (1993) and Duszak and Koczkodaj (1994) introduced a max-min based inconsis-\ntency index which was later compared with CI by Bozóki S. and Rapcsák (2008). Cavallo and D’Apuzzo (2009) characterized pairwise comparison matrices by means of Abelian linearly ordered groups and stated their inconsistency index in this general framework.\nAnother index, NIσn , was introduced by Ramı́k and Korviny (2010) to estimate the inconsistency of pairwise comparison matrices with elements expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers. Expressing judgments in such a way is popular to account for uncertainties in the decision making process. Nevertheless, pairwise comparison matrices can be seen as special cases of matrices with fuzzy entries and therefore this index can be introduced in the context of pairwise comparison matrices with real entries.\nDefinition 7 (Index NIσn (Ramı́k and Korviny, 2010)). Given a real number σ > 0 and a pairwise comparison matrix A ∈ A of order n with entries in the interval [1/σ, σ], the index NIσn is defined as\nNIσn (A) = γ σ n max\ni,j\n{∣ ∣ ∣ ∣\nwi wj − aij\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ } ,\nwhere the weights are obtained by means of the geometric mean method (3) and\nγσn =\n \n\n1\nmax\n{\nσ−σ 2−2n n ,σ2 ( ( 2n) 2 n−2−( 2n) n n−2\n)} , if σ < ( n 2 ) n n−2\n1\nmax\n{\nσ−σ 2−2n n ,σ 2n−2 n −σ\n} , if σ ≥ ( n 2 ) n n−2\nis a positive normalization factor.\nOther notable indices are the parametric method by Osei-Bryson (2006) and the ambiguity\nindex by Salo (1993)."

      "heading" : "4 Axioms",
      "text" : "In spite of the large number of indices, the question on how well they estimate inconsistency of pairwise comparisons has been left unanswered. To answer this question, in this section we introduce and justify five properties to narrow the general definition of inconsistency index given in (5) and to shed light on those indices which do not satisfy minimal reasonable requirements. Throughout this and the next sections we are going to propose some examples in order to provide numerical and visual evidence of the necessity of the following axiomatic system.\nAxiom 1: Existence of a unique element representing consistency\nWith axiom 1 (A1) we require that all the consistent matrices are identified by a unique real value of an inconsistency index. This allows to distinguish between matrices that either belong or do not to A∗. Formally, A1 is as follows.\nAxiom 1. An inconsistency index I satisfies A1, if and only if\n∃!ν ∈ R such that I(A) = ν ⇔ A ∈ A∗ (14)\nExample 1. The following inconsistency index satisfies A1 with ν = 0.\nI(A) =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\nn∑\nk=1\n|aik − aijajk| .\nFor sake of simplicity, we assume, without loss of generality, that, for every inconsistency index I(A), the value ν associated with each consistent matrix is the minimum value of the index: I(A) ≥ ν ∀A ∈ A. The assumption is that the more inconsistent is A, the greater is I(A). Some already introduced indices assume the opposite. By considering, for example, the index introduced by Shiraishi et al. (1998), it is c3(A) ≤ 0 ∀A ∈ A, while the consistency value is c3(A) = ν = 0 ∀A ∈ A ∗. Nevertheless, in such cases it is sufficient to change the sign of the index to fulfill our assumption.\nAxiom 2: Invariance under permutation of alternatives\nIt is desirable that an inconsistency index does not depend on the order in which the alternatives are associated with rows and columns of A. Therefore, an inconsistency index should be invariant under row-column permutations. To formalize this second axiom (A2), we recall that a permutation matrix is a square binary matrix P that has exactly one entry equal to 1 on each row and each column and 0’s elsewhere (see Horn and Johnson 1985). We also recall that PAPT is the matrix obtained from A through the row-column permutations associated with P.\nAxiom 2. An inconsistency index I satisfies A2, if and only if\nI ( PAPT ) = I(A) ∀A ∈ A (15)\nand for any permutation matrix P.\nExample 2. Given a pairwise comparison matrix A and a permutation matrix P\nA =\n\n \n1 2 5 1/2 1 2 1/5 1/2 1\n\n  P =\n\n \n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1\n\n \none obtains\nPAPT =\n\n \n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1\n\n \n\n \n1 2 5 1/2 1 2 1/5 1/2 1\n\n \n\n \n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1\n\n  =\n\n \n1 1/2 2 2 1 5 1/2 1/5 1\n\n \nfor which (15) is required to hold.\nAxiom 3: Monotonicity under reciprocity-preserving mapping\nUnlike the previous axioms, which were simple regularity conditions imposed to I(A), axiom 3 (A3) is more constraining. The idea is that, if preferences are intensified, then an inconsistency index cannot return a lower value. However, before we formalize it, we describe its meaning. If all the expressed preferences indicate indifference between alternatives, it is aij = 1 ∀i, j, and A is consistent. Going farther from this uniformity means having stronger judgments and this should not make their possible inconsistency less evident. In other words, intensifying the preferences (pushing them away from indifference) should not de-emphasize the characteristics of these preferences and their possible contradictions. Clearly, the crucial point is to find a transformation which can intensify preferences and preserve their structure at the same time. In the following, we are going to prove that such a transformation exists and is unique. Given A = (aij) ∈ A, we denote such transformation with âij = f(aij). The newly constructed matrix Â = (âij) obtained from A by means of f must be positive and reciprocal so that it still belongs to A. Hence\nâji = 1/âij ,\nwhich is\nf(aji) = 1/f(aij)\nf(1/aij) = 1/f(aij)\nf(aij)f(1/aij) = 1\nor, more compactly, with aij = x,\nf(x)f(1/x) = 1. (16)\nEquation (16) is a special case, for y = 1/x, of the well-known Cauchy functional equation\nf(x)f(y) = f(xy). (17)\nIn fact, by substituting x = 1 into (16), it is f(1)f(1) = 1. Since f must be positive, it follows f(1) = 1. Then, (16) can also be written in the form f(x)f(1/x) = f(x(1/x)) = f(1). Taking into account that x = aij > 0, it is therefore sufficient to assume the continuity of f in order to obtain a unique non-trivial solution of (16) (see Aczel 1966)\nf(x) = xb, b ∈ R. (18)\nTherefore, the only continuous transformation f(aij) preserving reciprocity is (18), i.e. f(aij) = abij. In the following, we will denote matrix (a b ij)n×n as A(b). Clearly, for b > 1 each entry aij 6= 1 is moved farther from indifference value 1, which represents an intensification of preferences:\nb > 1, aij > 1 ⇒ a b ij > aij > 1\nb > 1, 0 < aij < 1 ⇒ 0 < a b ij < aij < 1 .\nThe opposite occurs for 0 < b < 1, thus representing a weakening of the preferences. For b = 0 full indifference is obtained, abij = 1, while b < 0 corresponds to preference reversal. Moreover, transformation (18) is consistency-preserving, i.e. if A = (aij) is consistent, then also A(b) = (abij) is consistent. The proof is straightforward, since from aijajk = aik immediately follows abija b jk = a b ik. Furthermore, (18) is also the unique consistency-preserving transformation, the proof being similar to the one described above for reciprocity.\nTo summarize, the only continuous transformation that intensifies preferences and preserves\nreciprocity (and consistency) is f(aij) = a b ij with b > 1 and then A3 can be formalized. Axiom 3. Define A(b) = (\nabij\n)\nn×n . Then, an inconsistency index I satisfies A3 if and only if\nI(A(b)) ≥ I(A) ∀b > 1, ∀A ∈ A. (19)\nExample 3. Consider the following matrix\nA =\n\n \n1 2 1/2\n1/2 1 2\n2 1/2 1\n\n  .\nThen, modifying entries of A by means of function f with exponent b = 3 one obtains the following matrix\nA(3) =\n\n \n13 23 1/23\n1/23 13 23\n23 1/23 13\n\n  =\n\n \n1 8 1/8\n1/8 1 8\n8 1/8 1\n\n  .\nIf an inconsistency index I satisfies A3, then it must be I(A(3)) ≥ I(A). In words, if A3 holds, then A(3) cannot be judged less inconsistent than A.\nNote that transformation f(aij) = a b ij has been used for other scopes. Saaty (1977) himself proposed it in his seminal paper to show that his results on consistency were general enough to cover scales other than [1/9, 9]. Such a function was also employed by Herrera-Viedma et al. (2004) to find a suitable mapping to rescale the entries of a pairwise comparison matrix into the interval [1/9, 9] and by Fedrizzi and Brunelli (2009) to define consistency-equivalence classes.\nAxiom 4: Monotonicity on single comparisons\nLet us consider a consistent matrix with at least one non-diagonal entry apq 6= 1. If we increase or decrease the value of apq, and modify its reciprocal aqp accordingly, then the resulting matrix is not anymore consistent. In fact, in agreement with A1, the resulting matrix will have a degree of inconsistency which exceeds that of the consistent matrix. Axiom 4 (A4) establishes a condition of monotonicity for the inconsistency index with respect to single comparisons by requiring that the larger the change of apq from its consistent value, the more inconsistent the resulting matrix will be. More formally, given a consistent matrix A ∈ A∗, let Apq(δ) be the inconsistent matrix obtained from A by replacing the entry apq with a δ pq, where δ 6= 1. Necessarily, aqp must be replaced by aδqp to preserve reciprocity. Let Apq(δ ′) be the inconsistent matrix obtained from A by replacing entries apq and aqp with a δ′ pq and a δ′ qp respectively. A4 can then be formulated as\nδ′ > δ > 1 ⇒ I(Apq(δ ′)) ≥ I(Apq(δ)) δ′ < δ < 1 ⇒ I(Apq(δ ′)) ≥ I(Apq(δ)) .\n(20)\nAxiom 4 can be equivalently formalized as follows.\nAxiom 4. An inconsistency index I satisfies A4, if and only if I(Apq(δ)) is a non-decreasing function of δ for δ > 1 and a non-increasing function of δ for δ < 1, for all the A ∈ A∗ and p, q = 1, . . . , n.\nExample 4. Consider the consistent matrix\nA =\n\n \n1 2 4 1/2 1 2 1/4 1/2 1\n\n  ∈ A ∗.\nThen, choosing, for instance, entry a13 and changing its value and the value of its reciprocal accordingly, we obtain\nA′ =\n\n \n1 2 5 1/2 1 2 1/5 1/2 1\n\n  A ′′ =\n\n \n1 2 9 1/2 1 2 1/9 1/2 1\n\n  (21)\nIf an inconsistency index I satisfies A4, then I(A′′) ≥ I(A′) ≥ I(A), where the inequality between I(A) and I(A′) becomes strict if A1 holds. Note that, in this example, A′ = A13(δ) with δ = log4 5 and A ′′ = A13(δ ′) with δ′ = log4 9.\nMoreover, we note that A4 formalizes a property proved by Aupetit and Genest (1993) for Saaty’s Consistency Index and considered by the authors as a necessary property. Furthermore, the case of a potentially consistent matrix with one deviating comparison was considered by Bryson (1995) in a property that he called ‘single outlier neutralization’ and by Choo and Wedley (2004) in their comparative study of methods to elicit the weight vector. A4 is also in the spirit of other known axiomatic systems. As examples, Cook and Kress (1988) considered two matrices differing by only one comparison and Kemeny and Snell (1962) proposed a similar axiomatic assumption for the distance between rankings.\nAxiom 5: Continuity\nAs defined in (5), an inconsistency index I(A) is a function of A ∈ A. With this fifth axiom (A5), the continuity of the function is required in the set A. More precisely, an index I(A) is considered as a function of the (n 2 ) variables aij, i < j and continuity of I(A) is meant as the continuity of a function of ( n 2 ) real variables. Axiom 5 can be formalized as follows\nAxiom 5. An inconsistency index I(A) satisfies A5 if and only if it is a continuous function of the entries aij of A, with aij > 0, aijaji = 1 ∀i, j.\nThe importance of continuity in mathematical modelling has origins in the fact that it guarantees that infinitesimal variations in the input only generates an infinitesimal variation of the output, thus excluding functions with ‘jumps’."

      "text" : "Let us briefly discuss the necessity of the five axioms by showing that their violation could result in an unreasonable inconsistency measurement:\n• If A1 is violated, two perfectly consistent matrices can have two different numerical con-\nsistency evaluations.\n• If A2 is violated, different consistency evaluations could be associated to the same set of\npreferences, simply by renaming of alternatives.\n• The effect of violation of A3 is apparent from Example 3.

On the contrary, they turn out to be strictly demanding, since Propositions 5, 6, 7, and 8 will surprisingly show that they are not satisfied by four indices based on seemingly reasonable definitions."

      "heading" : "4.2 Logical consistency and independence",
      "text" : "A natural question is whether the axiomatic properties A1–A5 form an axiomatic system or not. In fact, in an axiomatic system, the axioms must be consistent (in a logical sense) and independent. The existence of, at least, one index satisfying A1–A5 proves that the axiomatic system is not logically contradictory and therefore the system is logically consistent. Another important result regards the independence of the axioms. Proving the independence would show that the axioms are not redundant, and therefore all of them shall be considered necessary.\nTheorem 1. Axiomatic properties A1–A5 are logically consistent and independent.\nProof. Propositions 1, 2 and 3 in Section 5 state that indices CI, CI∗ and GCI, respectively, satisfy all the five properties. Then, the axiomatic properties A1–A5 are logically consistent. Independence of a given axiom can be shown by providing an example of index satisfying all axioms except the one at stake. To prove the independence of A1, one can consider the following ad hoc constructed index,\nI1(A) = max {CI ∗(A)− 1, 0} .\nAs a consequence of Proposition 2, index I1 satisfies A2–A5. Nevertheless, I1 assigns value 0 also to some inconsistent pairwise comparison matrices, so that it does not satisfy A1. To prove independence of A2, one could instead consider\nI2(A) = n−2∑\ni=1\nn−1∑\nj=i+1\nn∑\nk=j+1\n( aik\naijajk + aijajk aik − 2\n)\nwijk\nwith wijk > 0 ∀ i, j, k, 0 < i < j < k ≤ n and wijk 6= wi′j′k′ for some 0 < i < j < k ≤ n and 0 < i′ < j′ < k′ ≤ n. Index I2 does not satisfy A2, due to the presence of wijk. Conversely, it satisfies all the other axioms, the proof being similar to that of Proposition 2. Independence of A3 directly follows from Proposition 7. To prove independence of A4, we propose the following index,\nI4(A) =\n(\nmax i 6=j max{aij , aji} −min i 6=j max{aij , aji}+ ǫ\n)\n× (CI∗(A))0.1 .\nIt can be proved that I4 fails to satisfy A4 for a convenient choice of ǫ > 0 and A.

Index CI∗ satisfies the five axioms A1–A5.\nProposition 3. The Geometric Consistency Index GCI satisfies the five axioms A1–A5.\nLet us now consider Barzilai’s inconsistency index RE and formulate the following interesting\nresult,\nProposition 4. Let A ∈ A and A(b) = (abij)n×n. Then RE(A) = RE(A(b)) ∀b 6= 0 and therefore RE is invariant w.r.t. f(aij) = a b ij ∀b > 0.\nProposition 4 could be seen as a restriction of A3, where an inconsistency index is required to be invariant under function f(aij) = a b ij . Clearly, this implies that index RE satisfies A3. The general result on index RE is stated by the following proposition\nProposition 5. Index RE satisfies A1–A3, but it does not satisfy A4 and A5.\nNote that Proposition 5 disproves the continuity of RE claimed in the original paper by Barzilai (1998).\nThe following proposition concerns index NIσn , introduced by Ramı́k and Korviny (2010), see\ndefinition 7. It remains unproved whether NIσn satisfies A3 or not.\nProposition 6. Index NIσn satisfies axioms A1, A2 and A5 but it does not satisfy A4.\nProof. The proof that NIσn satisfies axioms A1 and A2 is straightforward. To prove that NI σ n does not satisfy A4, let us consider the following consistent pairwise comparison matrix,\nA =\n\n   \n1 1/3 1/3 1/9 3 1 1 1/3 3 1 1 1/3 9 3 3 1\n\n    ∈ A∗. (22)\nIf entry a14 is changed, and its reciprocal a41 varies accordingly, then, the violation of A4 can be appreciated in Figure 1, where NIσn (A) is plotted as a function of a14, being n = 4 and σ = 9. In fact, A4 implies that such a function should be monotonically increasing for a14 > 1/9, but\nthis is not the case in this example, since, e.g., 2 > 0.5 but the value of NI94 (A) corresponding to a14 = 2 is smaller than the value of NI 9 4 (A) corresponding to a14 = 0.5. Continuity of NI σ n follows from continuity of max{·, ·}, so that A5 is satisfied.\nWe can only conjecture that the behavior described in Figure 1 is related with the fact, noted by Brunelli (2011), that index NIσn fails to identify the most inconsistent 3× 3 matrix.\nWe next consider another index which fails to satisfy one of the axioms: the Harmonic Con-\nsistency Index (12).\nProposition 7. Index HCI satisfies A1, A2, A4 and A5 but it does not satisfy A3.\nThe following example derives from the proof of proposition 7 and is aimed to clarify the behavior of HCI and to show the importance of A3.\nExample 5. Consider the following matrix A and its derived matrix A(b) = (\nabij\n)\nA =\n\n   \n1 4 1/2 2 1/4 1 1/4 2\n2 4 1 2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1\n\n   \nA(b) =\n\n   \n1b 4b (1/2)b 2b (1/4)b 1b (1/4)b 2b\n2b 4b 1b 2b (1/2)b (1/2)b (1/2)b 1\n\n    .\nIt is possible to illustrate the behavior of HCI(A(b)) by means of Figure 2. The index initially increases, but then it decreases and converges to full HCI-consistency as b grows.\nThe last index considered in this section is the index GW of Golden and Wang (1989) and the following proposition states the corresponding results. It remains unproved whether GW satisfies A4 or not.\nProposition 8. Index GW satisfies A1, A2 and A5. If the priority vector is computed by means of the geometric mean method, then index GW does not satisfy A3.\nThe following example derives from the proof of Proposition 8 and, similarly to example 5,\nshows the convergence to zero of the index GW .\nExample 6. Consider the pairwise comparison matrix A(b) obtained from A as\nA =\n\n   \n1 3 1/4 2 1/3 1 1/7 2\n4 7 1 6 1/2 1/2 1/6 1\n\n   \nA(b) =\n\n   \n1b 3b (1/4)b 2b (1/3)b 1b (1/7)b 2b\n4b 7b 1b 6b (1/2)b (1/2)b (1/6)b 1b\n\n   \n(23)\nand note that the third row of A contains all the greatest elements of each column. It is possible to plot the behavior of GW and obtain the graph in Figure 3, which represents the GW -inconsistency of matrix A(b) in (23).\nFinally, Table 1 summarizes the findings obtained in this section."

      "text" : "Propositions 6, 7 and 8, together with the corresponding examples, suggest that A3 and A4 are the most demanding axioms. Let us make some other remarks to clarify A3 and A4. First, we\npropose a geometrical interpretation that could be useful to emphasize the role of A4 in requiring the non-decreasing property of an inconsistency index when moving away from consistency. Let us represent a consistent matrix A ∈ A∗ as a point in the Cartesian space Rn(n−1)/2, where the dimension n(n− 1)/2 is the number of upper-diagonal elements which are necessary and sufficient to identify a pairwise comparison matrix of order n. By increasing (decreasing) entry apq, the point A departs from set A ∗ and moves in the direction of the corresponding axis. Thus, A4 requires that an inconsistency index does not decrease whenever A moves away from the initial consistent position, in any of the n(n− 1)/2 possible directions. On the other hand, by referring to the same geometrical representation in the Cartesian space, the type of translation of point A induced by A3 is different from the one induced by A4, so that the joint effect is more general than the single ones.\nIn decision problems based on pairwise comparisons there are two phases: preference elicitation and priority vector computation. In the previous sections we defined and studied five axioms characterizing the inconsistency evaluation of the preferences elicited by a decision maker independently from the method used in deriving the priority vector. Therefore, we focused on pairwise comparison matrix A and the property of transitivity aik = aijajk ∀i, j, k. Nevertheless, by considering that consistency of a pairwise comparison matrix can equivalently be characterized by property aij = wi/wj ∀i, j, it is possible and relevant to study also the relationship between the inconsistency indices and the methods used for priority vector computation. Other investigations will add new insight on the relationship between the inconsistency indices and the methods used for computing priority vectors."

The use of different methods for measuring consistency must be carefully evaluated, as it can affect the decision outcome in practical applications.
