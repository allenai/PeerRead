      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Over the past ten years, the Semantic Web wave has shown a new vision of ontology use for application integration systems. Researchers have produced several software tools for building ontologies (like Protégé [1]) and merging them two by two (like Mafra [2]) or producing alignments (like S-Match [3]). These solutions, as well as adopted ontology building methodologies, are mainly human or, as shown in [4], sometimes assisted by semi-automatic software tools. Limitations to their adoption for integration of internet and enterprise applications, among others reasons, are: (i) the lack of tools capable of extracting and acquiring information from a collection of XML files (the “de-facto” format for applications information exchange definition); (ii) the complexity of aligning and merging two or more knowledge sources, a task excessively consuming of computational time; (iii) the difficulty of validation based on background knowledge hard to produce and maintain. Janus, the tool that we have developed, implements a new approach to ontology generation capable of providing a solution to the limitations described above. It is able to automatically generate and maintain, (in a meta-model OWL compatible), a collective memory resource that facilitates the discovery of alignments for matching\nconcepts in a given domain. The knowledge source is automatically acquired from an extensible set of XSD files. The aim of this short paper is to introduce Janus, how it works and to show some different views (produced by the tool) of knowledge automatically acquired."

      "heading" : "2. JANUS ARCHITECTURE",
      "text" : "Our tool implements an adaptation of several techniques originating from text mining and information retrieval/extraction fields, applied to XML files (that we call XML Mining). XML Mining is used to pre-process simple and compound statements defining XML tags, such as XSD elements and XSD complex types. It includes clustering methods based on a Galois Lattice to quickly discovery similarities between names and structures extracted from XML schemas. Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of Janus.\nThe algorithm generating a high level representation of XML Schema information sources is composed of three main steps. The first step is the Extraction task represented by the Extract arrow and Acquisition rectangle in Figure 1. It provides the knowledge needed to generate the ontology (concepts, properties and relationships). Implemented techniques for knowledge acquisition are a combination of different types, such as: NLP (Natural Language Process) for morphological and lexical analysis, association mining for calculating term frequencies and association rules, semantics for finding synonymy, and clustering for grouping semantic and structural similar concepts. The second step is Analysis represented by the Normalisation, Build Taxonomy and Filtering blocks in Figure 1. This step focuses on the matching of retrieved information and/or alignment of two or more existing families of concepts issued from different sources. This step requires techniques already used in the first stage, as syntax and semantic measures, to establish the best similarities; it\nalso requires an analysis of concept structures to determine hierarchical relationships and identify common properties. The last step is Generation, represented by the Merging, Transform and Build View blocks in Figure 1. This step looks for concepts with evident affinities (e.g., concept fully included into another) to merge them. It transforms the meta-model used by the tool into a semantic network that can be described in RDFS or OWL. The tool can derive from the network useful views provided to users. Users can also step into the process to parameterize thresholds for refining results."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3. FUNCTIONALITIES and VIEWS",
      "text" : "The tool currently offers three visualization methods to view the acquired knowledge. The word view shows the list of terms composing the \"ontology\", and tag clouds (both in Figure 2). The table view gives detailed information about each concept (like frequencies, family attendance, source instances and direct relationships) . The graph view diplays the semantic network (Figure 3). Other views, “Concepts Social Network”, are under development.\nThe graph view can show the whole graph or only the part related to selected concepts with different layouts (hierarchical, tree, …).\nAcquired relationships, and thus visualised, are of different types: propertyOf, synonym, shared terms (compound tags with common terms like address for tender_address and post_box_address) and relatedTo (mainly merged concepts or other of type “owl:sameAs”). The graph view also provides the possibility to choose the relationships to highlight, as well as concepts classes and/or properties (Figure 4). This feature permits to analyse in details some parts of the ontology; it is useful when the ontology is too large to be browsed with the global view.\nThe tool also offers the possibility to parameterize thresholds for alignment and merging operations."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "The automatic acquisition of knowledge from XML Schema files shows encouraging results, as well as the implemented meta-model (a semantic model detailed in [5]) that looks robust enough to continue research works in this direction. Before developing a complete and automatic tool, several problems remain to be resolved. But nevertheless, the ability to acquire semantic concepts directly from the “interchange language” (XML) without the a priori definition of application ontologies, is a new approach to B2B integration. Janus provides a first implementation of this approach. We propose to demonstrate the first results of this tool applied to the analysis of 23 existing B2B standards."
