      "text" : "Minimum error rate training (MERT) is a widely used training procedure for statistical machine translation. A general problem of this approach is that the search space is easy to converge to a local optimum and the acquired weight set is not in accord with the real distribution of feature functions. This paper introduces coordinate system selection (RSS) into the search algorithm for MERT. Contrary to previous approaches in which every dimension only corresponds to one independent feature function, we create several coordinate systems by moving one of the dimensions to a new direction. The basic idea is quite simple but critical that the training procedure of MERT should be based on a coordinate system formed by search directions but not directly on feature functions. Experiments show that by selecting coordinate systems with tuning set results, better results can be obtained without any other language knowledge."

      "text" : "Statistical machine translation technologies convert a natural language into another natural language automatically by using large-scale corpus-based statistical models. From noise channel model (Brown, 1990), maximum entropy model (Och, 2002) to minimum error rate training model (Och, 2003), statistical machine translation\ndecision-making methods for obtaining translations, increasing the system performance gradually. Meanwhile, the machine translation units start to transit from words (Brown, 1990) to phrases (Koehn, 2003). For example, being the most widely used machine translation system, Moses contains two main technologies which are minimum error rate training model and statistical phrase-based translation (Koehn, 2007).\nMinimum error rate training is a method proposed by Och (2003) to obtain all weights of feature functions according to the translation error rate. Unlike log-linear model based on maximum entropy, the MERT model does not use language model, distortion model and sentence length et al. directly to evaluate translations, but evaluates translations by a standard evaluation method (such as BLEU). Experiments show that when using the same evaluation method to carry out training and evaluating, the evaluation results can get better scores (Och, 2003). Although this method is not a real optimum algorithm, it can adapt translations to different evaluation methods. So it is more beneficial than the traditional method to obtain higher scores.\nAssuming the translation e of the source\nlanguage sentence f has a reference\nsentence r .

When training parameters, greedy algorithm is used to adjust the parameters of a particular dimension by turn, while other dimensions of the parameters are constant.\nAlthough KCD can achieve a global optimum on one dimension each time, it can not guarantee that the entire feature set converge to a global optimum in all dimensions (Moore, 2008). In this paper, we introduce coordinate system selection (RSS)\ninto KCD, so that we can change search directions in order to get better weight set to reflect the real distribution of feature functions. For closed test results and open test results 1 are often consistent, closed test results are used to choose better coordinate systems (RS) for the open test.\nThe goal of this paper is to investigate the role of coordinate system selection to optimize the parameters for MERT. Section 2 introduces Koehn’s Coordinate Descent for minimum error training. Section 3 elaborates RSS-MERT including the theoretical basis of RSS and search progress. Section 4 gives the specific experimental results of three kinds of RSS. Section 5 presents the related research in recent years about improving MERT. Section 6 concludes the experiment, and gives future research directions of RSS."

The results show that when the parameter is greater than 0, the open test and closed test results are significantly better than when the parameter is less than 0. Closed test and open test are approximately consistenct: closed test results reach a highest point when the parameter is 0.3, while the open test reach a highest point when the parameter is between 0.1 and 0.3. At the time the parameters is 0.3, the BLEU score of the closed test is 15.80, and of the open test is 18.14, significantly higher than the baseline of 15.68 and 17.86.\nTable 1 and table 2 compare the best\nresults of three different kinds of search direction movements with the baseline system when n-gram is 5 and 6 respectively. Three movements including (1) move from language model direction to distortion model direction (2) move from language model direction to length model direction (3) move from distortion model direction to length model direction. As the closed test and open test evaluation results have a moderate consistency, at the best result point in the closed test, open test result also improves significantly than the baseline system.

The parameters are 0.3 and 0.1 respectively. The results are showed below.\nIt can be seen from figure 6 that while transforming the search direction of the coordinate system, there is also a corresponding movement of the weights of two related features in the coordinate system. Therefore, changing the coordinate system is actually equivalent to moving the weight values in the coordinate system. As a whole, in RSS-MERT, by changing the search direction of the coordinate system and making the minimum error rate point moved, we can avoid the training progress converge to a local optimum."

      "heading" : "5 Related Research",
      "text" : "Minimum error training (MERT) is a\nsubject that still needs to be explored further. Cer (2008) proposes regularization and random search to ease the problem of local optimum. They select random search directions based on Powell method (Press, 2007) to overcome the limitation that the assumption it uses to build up the diagonal search directions do not hold in the present context . In addition, by checking and combining the adjacent peak in a fixed window of search directions, they solve the problem that one optimal value is surrounded by several bad objective function values in minimum error rate training. Their results show that these two improved methods can significantly improve the system performance compared to traditional Powell algorithm and coordinate descent method. Machery (2008) replaces word n-best list by lattices to improve the estimates of the expected translation score. In the algorithm, they efficiently construct and represent the exact error surface of all the translations which are encoded in a phrase lattice. They use this novel method to train the feature function weights for a phrase-based statistical machine translation system. Experiments show that they obtain significant improved BLEU score over N-best MERT.\nThe optimal solution point in MERT is often related to the initial weights of feature functions. Some current studies focus on the choice of initial weights. In order to avoid getting into a bad local optimum, Koehn et al. (2007) start from different initial weights, and use multiple optimizing search methods on each set of extended hypotheses in the translation. Moore et al.(2008) use two methods to adjust the initial weight for MERT: (1) randomly select initial weight according to uniform distribution; (2) use random walk method that select the initial weight according to the local optimum\nwhich the previous iteration converges to. Their experiments also make the BLEU evaluation results of translations improved significantly."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "Statistical machine translation systems\noften contain a number of feature functions.\nSo the problem of correlated feature\nfunctions is critical that any statistical\nmachine translation system must face.\nHowever, in Koehn coordinate descent\nmethod, each search direction corresponds\nto one feature function, ignoring the\ncorrelation between the feature functions. In\nthis paper we change the search directions\nto form several coordinate systems for KCD\nso that we can get better weight points\nwhich are closer to the real distribution of\nfeature functions.\nThe weights of minimum error rate\ntraining tend to converge to a local optimum. Experiments show that the changing trends of feature function weights are the same as the moving trends of search directions. By making use of the correlation between the functions and selecting coordinate systems, we can obtain multiple weight sets that satisfy minimum error rate. For different weight sets, the closed test and open test results of BLEU evaluation are often identical. Therefore, we do not need to change the initial weights of training, instead we only need to select the best model for the closed test, so as to improve the open test results. This method overcomes the limitation of the local optimum in MERT and can get better results on the overall situation.\nWithout increasing the system’s execute time and storage space, this method is simple and convenient to be\nwidely used. Moreover, the SMT performance has a chance to be significantly improved by finding better coordinate systems. In the future, we will extend RSS-MERT methods to other models, such as phrase translation model and lexical weight model. In addition, we will also test on a larger corpus, hoping to expand such a simple way to the practical aspects."

Meanwhile, the machine translation units start to transit from words (Brown, 1990) to phrases (Koehn, 2003). For example, being the most widely used machine translation system, Moses contains two main technologies which are minimum error rate training model and statistical phrase-based translation (Koehn, 2007). Minimum error rate training is a method proposed by Och (2003) to obtain all weights of feature functions according to the translation error rate.",

    "abstractText" : "Minimum error rate training (MERT) is a widely used training procedure for statistical machine translation. A general problem of this approach is that the search space is easy to converge to a local optimum and the acquired weight set is not in accord with the real distribution of feature functions. This paper introduces coordinate system selection (RSS) into the search algorithm for MERT. Contrary to previous approaches in which every dimension only corresponds to one independent feature function, we create several coordinate systems by moving one of the dimensions to a new direction. The basic idea is quite simple but critical that the training procedure of MERT should be based on a coordinate system formed by search directions but not directly on feature functions. Experiments show that by selecting coordinate systems with tuning set results, better results can be obtained without any other language knowledge.",
