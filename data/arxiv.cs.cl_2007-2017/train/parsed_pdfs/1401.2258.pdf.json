      "text" : "The task of cross-language information retrieval is to find documents relevant to a query, where query and documents do not belong to the same language. While many systems just translate either queries or documents and then perform monolingual retrieval, better performing or less ressource intensive approaches might integrate translation knowledge as an integral part of the retrieval model. Our focus will lie on integrating knowledge from the multilingual, freely available on-line encyclopedia Wikipedia1 as a cross-language bridge for retrieval.\nDimensionality reduction techniques have traditionally been of interest for information retrieval as a means of mitigating the word mismatch problem. Cross-language information retrieval can be viewed as an extreme case of word mismatch. More general than dimensionality reduction, the term concept model is used to denote a mapping from the word space to another representation. Such a representation may, for example, be obtained by matrix approximation [Deerwester et al., 1990], by probabilistic inference [Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007] or by techniques making use of the conceptual structure of corpora such as Wikipedia [Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007].\nWhile some work has been done on multilingual concept modeling [Dumais et al., 1997, Ni et al., 2009, Mimno et al., 2009, Potthast et al., 2008, Sorg and Cimiano, 2008, 2009], most often the focus is on one method and a comparison with other methods is missing or a particularly simple instantiation is used as a base-line. One reason for this might be that concept models require adaptations for multilinguality that do not seem to be easily implemented. We will show that the adaptations can in fact be minimal and on the data side only. Another question that has not been investigated so far is how different multilingual concept models interact with each other and how they can be combined with bag-of-word models, an approach that is standard for the monolingual case.\nThe subsequent parts of this thesis are structured as follows: In chapter 2 we give a broad survey over retrieval methods and knowledge sources used for cross-language retrieval. In chapter 3 we discuss three concept models included in our experiments and especially focus on their multilingual adaptations. In chapter 4 we report experiments on three corpora. We show that for one of our adaptations much better results can be observed than reported so far. In chapter 5 we explore whether machine translation\n1http://wikipedia.org/\n3"

The most simple models of that kind work directly on bag-ofword vectors and are prone to sparseness and missing word overlap, some backing-off can be achieved by dimensionality reduction techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis [Deerwester et al., 1990] or term expansion as in the generalized vector space model [Wong et al., 1985]. In practice, many different features associated with documents can be expressed as vectors to form the basis of retrieval.\nWhile vector space retrieval models are set in a simple and precise mathematical theory, which make them immediately accessible to many other tasks such as document clustering or classification, the connection with the actual retrieval process is not very clearly represented, especially after applying term weighting functions like the empirically well-working tf.idf scheme [Salton and Buckley, 1987]. Similar starting points and theoretical properties exhibit tuned ranking functions like the popular Okapi-BM25 family [Robertson et al., 1995], which are still achieving state-of-the-art results [Armstrong et al., 2009]."

Usually the assumption is made that the probabilities of the query words are independent of each other conditioned on the model provided by the current document. The probabilistic models obtained from the documents D are in the simplest case the maximum likelihood estimates of the unigram word probabilities P (w|D). These estimates are zero for unseen words, which makes the probability of the query\nP (Q) = �\nw∈Q\nP (w|D)n(w,Q)\nzero if one query word has no evidence in the document.\nTwo different strategies are usually applied to overcome this problem. The first is to interpolate the document estimates with a naturally smoother distribution estimated from a big document collection [Hiemstra, 1998, Miller et al., 1999, Song and Croft, 1999]. The second is to smooth the estimates of either distribution by one of the many techniques originally developed for speech recognition [Chen and Goodman, 1999, Zhai and Lafferty, 2004]."

Since such models perform a sort of dimensionality reduction (for every document or query they store only the distribution of the topics) parallels can be drawn to LSA. On the other hand, in their very nature they are probabilistic, even parts can be identified that correspond directly to generative language models. Indeed, both using the topic distributions (or other parameter vectors) directly for distance comparison (as in [Hofmann, 1999, 2001, Blei et al., 2003]) as well as using them as components in a generative model (as in [Azzopardi et al., 2004, Wei and Croft, 2006]) are common practices. The two most prominent latent variable models are probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis [Hofmann, 2001], which implements the ideas of variable modeling in a straightforward way but does not define inference on documents not present in the training collection, and, developed some years later, Latent Dirichlet Allocation [Blei et al., 2003], which defines a fully generative model\n5"

Slightly different are comparable corpora, such as Wikipedia. They contain texts that have counterparts in other languages with which they are linked by dealing with the same topic. Here, it cannot in general be assumed to find corresponding phrase pairs, and it is an interesting research question how much this kind of information can contribute to effective retrieval. Also, comparable corpora are much easier to acquire, cheaper and available in more languages than parallel corpora."

Indeed, dimensionality reduction for cross-language retrieval has been dealt with in several theoretical frameworks and is still a field of ongoing research. We will now present work relevant to using comparable corpora and outline strengths and weaknesses of them as well as possible extensions and modifications. The first approach [Dumais et al., 1997] to using comparable corpora and dimensionality reduction was done with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a technique making use of lower-rank matrix approximation by singular value decomposition. As an effect, terms and documents are represented by lower-dimensional vectors, making them topically comparable [Deerwester et al., 1990]. For cross-lingual LSA, parallel or comparable documents are embedded and the weighted sum of embedded term vectors\n6"

While the method works well and is still used as a baseline [Cimiano et al., 2009], it lacks, as does monolingual LSA, a probabilistic interpretation and is hardly scalable, which becomes a major problem when it comes to embedding gigabyte-sized corpora such as Wikipedia. A more modern approach could be based on probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA Hofmann [2001]). The underlying assumption in this kind of model is that words and documents are independent conditioned on an unobserved class variable Z that can take on K different values zk ∈ {z1 · · · zK}. Therefore, in this model the following factorization of the joint probablity of a word wi occurring in document dj is possible:\nP (wi, dj) = �\nzk\nP (wi|zk)P (wj |zk)P (zk)\nAnother, equivalent factorization is\nP (wi, dj) = P (dj) �\nzk\nP (wi|zk)P (zk|dj)\nAn instance of the EM-Algorithm is used to estimate an optimal factorization. The result can be used in a probabilistic fashion or by taking the cosine of the distribution vectors p(Z|dj). No work is known to us that applies pLSA to embed multilingual documents for IR. In chapter 3.1.4 we present an adaptation of pLSA for cross-lingual IR that includes a language variable L taking on a language value ls and quantifying the amount of text in a particular language of a parallel document. Drawbacks of this method are theoretic concerns that the model is not fully generative and does therefore not include the possibility of estimating unseen documents (although ad-hoc techniques such as folding-in are used for that in practice). Another concern is that to us no large-scale implementations are known that showed positive scalability properties of pLSA to gigabyte sized collections like Wikipedia. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) overcomes some of the theoretical and practical limitations of LSA and pLSA. Still the likelihood of document–word statistics is maximized, but the documents themselves (not only the terms within them) are assumed to be generated by a probabilistic process. This model allows to overcome overfitting to some degree and defines inference on unseen data in a theoretically sound way. Secondly, approximate inference by sampling is possible, making LDA scalable without\n7"

      "text" : "losing considerable accuracy. Because of these properties LDA has gained remarkable popularity and many optimized implementations are available. LDA experiments for cross-lingual IR have been published [Cimiano et al., 2009] with disappointing outcomes compared to other techniques. These results do not convincingly show the inappropriateness of LDA, as the authors have embedded multilingual Wikipedia articles without any length normalization or model adaptation. For a method that tries to model characteristics of term statistics, the biggest increase in data-likelihood with limited model capacities should be expected by effectively capturing the predominant language vocabulary instead of doing topical modeling. An indicator that this effect might indeed be at work is that in another run of experiments, trained with in-domain data that have almost constant length ratio (because they are parallel), LDA performs as well as the other methods. Dealing with the supposed length ratio problem could be done either by processing the data accordingly or by adapting the model in a similar fashion as suggested by Ni et al. [2009] for web-page classification (see also [Mimno et al., 2009]). In chapter 3.2.4 we describe in more detail how LDA can be applied in a multilingual setting. A recently proposed similarity measure that is based on simple ideas and also uses wikipedia as a training corpus is Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) [Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007, Potthast et al., 2008, Sorg and Cimiano, 2009]). It can be applied in monolingual or cross-lingual settings. The main idea is that terms are represented as weighted vectors of documents in a training corpus. Most often, the column vectors of a tf.idf weighted document-term matrix constructed from the training corpus are used for that. Similarity between words is measured as a distance between such weight vectors. Documents and queries are represented by combining word vectors, e.g. by summing them up. The evaluation results on the method are inconsistent: while it has been found to work well on mate-retrieval tasks in a multilingual setting and is reported to surpass LDA there [Cimiano et al., 2009], in an actual query-based document retrieval setting it showed no competitive performance [Sorg and Cimiano, 2008]. These findings may be explained in different ways: for the first finding there might have been problems in how LDA was applied and compared, for the second finding, no interpolation with a word-vector based representation was undertaken, as it is usually done for dimensionality reduction techniques such as LSA and pLSA [Hofmann, 2001].

A coherent conceptual interpretation of the overall embedded matrix is hard to give, the weighting scheme is found experimentally. Cohn and Hofmann [2001] use pLSA to include as an additional source of information links to a document (from another document).

In a similar fashion, word-translation links could be interpolated with word-document counts. However, we see two problems in such an approach: First, interpretability of the model parts would not be fully consistent for the different “ontological” status a word has as a translation from a lexicon or occurring in a document. Secondly, to us it is not evident that the EM-re-estimation equations in Cohn and Hofmann [2001], while looking reasonable at a first glance, really derive from the initial problem statement. From cursory calculations, without making additional non-trivial assumptions, complexity should increase from quadratic to cubic by adding an additional dimension of included information this way. An interesting alternative based on LDA has been proposed recently by Boyd-Graber and Blei [2009]. Here, multingual pairings of words are extracted from parallel or comparable corpora in an unsupervised way and assigned to a topic. To increase the quality of the pairs, pairing priors derived from e.g. edit-distances or manually edited lexica can be included. In spite of being theoretically interesting, the authors make reservations with respect to scalability issues and evaluate only on a very small training and testing basis with inconclusive results."

General competitions like the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF, [Peters and Braschler, 2001]) as well as datasets allowing for more specific comparisons are to be taken into consideration. Two evaluation scenarios are possible and common in the research community. The first are mate retrieval experiments, performed on parallel or comparable document collections with the task of finding the corresponding counterpart of a document in another language. The second scenario consists in classical retrieval settings with queries in one language and relevance-assessed documents in another. The advantage of a mate-retrieval approach to evaluation is that there are many such corpora available having been used for evaluation, starting with the Bible (as in [Chew and Abdelali, 2007, Bader and Chew, 2008]), Wikipedia (as in [Potthast\n10"

Arguably, such settings also show a certain proximity to document clustering and recommendation (see also [Ni et al., 2009, Wu and Oard, 2008, Olsson et al., 2005]). On the other hand, it is rather an unrealistic setting to appear in real word information retrieval scenarios and a maybe too easy task as well. Also, to see that there is a lot of evaluation done on such corpora does not mean that the results are comparable. In fact, no comparable mate-retrieval results of two different research groups are known to us, unclear preprocessing and selection strategies even complicate the reproduction of experiments and results. A nicer setup is provided by IR challenges such as CLEF. Here, the evaluation is implemented in clear and replicable ways with hundreds of thousands of documents categorized by a two-stage process of pooling and human relevance-assessment. Comparison can be made immediately with state-of-the-art methods (although such an evaluation may possibly turn out unrewarding for experimental or novel approaches). Also, there are usually only a few, often just about 50 queries, making evaluation unstable to effects like missing vocabulary items. For our experiments, we evaluate on two datasets: To establish comparability with the findings on LDA and ESA in [Cimiano et al., 2009] and [Sorg and Cimiano, 2009], an evaluation on the Multext JOC corpus is undertaken. To establish comparability to generally applied retrieval methods and give a more realistic picture of performance in real world tasks an evaluation on a CLEF collection is carried out. One of the most accessible of these collections is the CLEF ad-hoc dataset from the year 2000. For the ease of processing and sanity checks, the experiments are done on the language pair German-English.\n11"

Because these representations can be made directly comparable for more than one language, such models are interesting for cross-language retrieval, especially when the training of them requires less strict properties of the training material than are required for machine translation. For all models introduced in this section comparable corpora are sufficient, while all common statistical machine translation systems need parallel training corpora.\nIn monolingual retrieval such models are usually justified by the existence two problems: The first is synonymy, the case that two words bear the same meaning while having different surface form, possibly leading to an underestimation of the similarity of two texts. The second is polysemy, possibly leading to overestimation of the similarity of documents in which the same word is used with different meanings.\nWe include three such models, two probabilistic ones, probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and one explicit concept model based on weighting schemes (Explicit Semantic Analysis). Such techniques are often referred to under the term of dimensionality reduction. While for the probabilistic techniques the parameter space in which the documents are represented is in practice indeed of lower dimensionality than the vocabulary, for Explicit Semantic Analysis the new space might be even of bigger dimensionality than the original vocabulary space. Still, the vector representation is smoother than the original one based on words, providing a gradual similarity measure for non-matching terms. In that it is not so different from pseudo-relevance feedback techniques since the connection between terms is established via strongly associated (or highly ranked) documents.\nWhile the models are applicable to any collection of so-called two-mode date (discrete two-dimensional co-occurrence counts), we will consistently use a terminology that immediately draws the connection to modeling of text collections.\n12"

The most important assumption in pLSA is that the probability distribution of words in a document is only dependent on the distribution of topics in that document. This assumption is the same in more recently developed models. For several reasons we want to discuss pLSA: It is the first latent variable model widely applied to document clustering and retrieval. Its basic architecture was influential for its successors. It is easily understandable and derivable. It can be easily adapted and implemented.

Each document is characterized by a topic distribution, words are emitted according to an emission probability dependent on a topic. The main difference to pLSA is that both topic distributions and word emission distributions are assumed to be generated by Dirichlet priors. A Dirichlet distribution with T parameters Dir(α1 · · ·αT ) (short Dir(α)) assigns a probability to a T -dimensional multinomial distribution Mult(p1 · · · pT ) giving the density:\nΓ( �\nj αj) �\nj Γ(αj)\nT �\nj=1\np αj−1 j\nwhere Γ is the gamma function. The parameters of the Dirichlet distribution determine two properties of the multinomials drawn from it: first, the expected values pi are proportional to the paramters αi; secondly, the expected variances of the pi decrease when the sum of the α’s gets bigger. When using the Dirichlet as a prior, it is common to assign the same value α = α1 = · · · = αT to all parameters and basically to direct only the “peakiness” of the multinomials drawn from it: values for α bigger than 1 favor uniform multinomials (the mode of the Dirichlet is for a uniform multinomial), values smaller than 1 punish uniform multinomials (the Dirichlet has modes at multinomials that assign all probability mass to one event).\nThe LDA model describes the process of generating text in the following way:\n1.

Later approaches concentrate on getting a sample of the assignment of words to topics instead [Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004]. We now give a short survey of the conceptual steps involved in the topic sampling process. For a more detailed description of the theory behind sampling, we refer to general text books such as [Newman and Barkema, 1999, MacKay, 2003, Bishop, 2006].\nGibbs sampling is a simple technique based on the fact that when the outcome of one variable is sampled conditioned on the previously sampled outcomes of the other variables, the overall distribution converges, when sampled iteratively, to the underlying distribution.\nFor LDA, this sampling is particularly easy because the distributions involved are multinomials conditioned on Dirichlet priors. The Dirichlet distribution is conjugate to the multinomial distribution. This means that when the inital assumption about a multinomial is that it is drawn from a Dirichlet (prior) distribution with parameters α, then, after observations x(i) (vectors indicating the outcome) generated by the multinimial are available, the most likely underlying (posterior) distribution for having generated the multinomial is again a Dirichlet distribution with parameters\nα ′ = α+\n�\ni\nx(i)\n24"

When other variational EM estimation techniques are applied, also other parameter vectors might be available and used [Cimiano et al., 2009, Blei et al., 2003]. The comparison between these vectors can be done either by taking the cosine similarity of their angles or, in case the vector is indeed a probability distribution (as for θ), by using probability divergence measures, such as the (symmetrized) Kullback Leibler divergence or the Jensen-Shannon divergence.\nFor language model based information retrieval, one is interested in the probability of a query, given a document p(q|di). Wei and Croft [2006] interpolate a language model based on LDA with a unigram language model directly estimated on the document. The LDA model gives smooth estimates for every word in the query by �\nj P (w|z =\nj)P (z = j|di). With this formulation, no latent topics are estimated for the query and therefore no θ exists that could disambiguate terms in the query based on other terms occurring in it (in contrast to topics having been sampled following a combination of word-based ψ and query-based θ).\nLDA can be easily parallelized [Newman et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2009]. Usually, the set of training documents is split and sampling is done independently in each iteration. However, the topic-per-word counts have to be updated for all processes in each iteration. Therefore, the speedup is linear for the size of the corpus, but no speedup is obtained for the vocabulary size. For large vocabularies and few documents communication costs may outweigh any speedup obtained.\nWhenever a sampling technique is used, one wants to be sure that the estimates are stable. This could be a problem when only one topic is sampled per position for short documents or queries.

A theoretically sound model does not mean that it also provides a good bridging between two languages. It is crucial [Mimno et al., 2009] how many “glue documents”, i.e. documents that indeed have counterparts in all compared languages, are available. Although the topic variables may not estimate the language, the partition of the topic space might diverge. Consider, as an extreme example, a multilingual model trained on hundreds of thousands of documents, each available in exactly one of the covered languages, and only one document providing text in all of them. It becomes obvious that this is clearly too little to align the topic spaces between the languages.In our weighting experiments in section 4.1 we show evidence that this intuition can be generalized: not only should a large number of glue documents exist, good bridging documents should optimally be of equal length. We believe, therefore, that it is a more promising approach to normalize the data suitably to fit into a standard LDA model. Moreover, this has the advantage that one of the many optimized toolkits readily available for LDA can be used out of the box, without the need to adapt their sampling schemes.\nWe give an informal argument why a standard (monolingual) LDA model trained on a normalized multilingual document collection, with all language parts in a document being of equal length, is essentially equivalent to the multilingual LDA model applied to the same collection.

Notice that in this formulation the relative term frequency is used. In effect, this is a length normalization, making all documents contribute equally strongly. We use this choice of word vectors in our experiments.\nFor the text similarity, several settings have been proposed. In [Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007] a weigting of the word vectors is used, they are multiplied with scalars equal to, again, an tf.idf weighting of the terms, and then summed up. It is however not very clearly described which exact instantiation of the tf.idf function was used in the experiments. Sorg and Cimiano [2009] explore further combination schemes, including the sum of the elements of either the multiset (considering term frequency) or of the set (not considering term frequency) of word vectors. They find that the set combination works best, yielding preliminary text vectors of the form:\nd̂ = �\nw∈d\nw\nIt is beneficial to truncate the resulting vectors at a certain threshold. The thresholding that turned out to be most successful was to retain the c biggest non-zero values of the vectors d̂. Let t be the value of the (c+ 1)th biggest component of d̂.\ndi =\n \n\nd̂i if d̂i > t,\n0 otherwise.\nHere, di refers to the ith component of d.

The German monolingual block contains the German term statistics of the remaining 1000 Wikipedia articles. Likewise, the English monolingual block contains 1000 articles, each with their counterpart in the German monolingual block.\nThe evaluation setup is as follows: For every document d(de,i) in the German monolingual block we rank the document in the English monolingual block according to the retrieval method applied and get a rank ri for the one corresponding to the German query document. A run is evaluated by its mean reciprocal rank (mrr), given by:\nmrr = 1\nN\nN �\ni=1\n1 ri\nFor the pLSA model, the whole matrix of three blocks is embedded, that is, the P (Z|di) of both the comparable and the monolingual articles were computed and used in the re-estimation iterations.

Note that the cut-off parameter is greater than the training corpus size and has therefore no influence. Again ranking is done by the cosine similarity. For the LDA model we estimated the parameters P (W |Z) with the comparable block. The highly efficient and parallel LDA implementation plda [Wang et al., 2009] was used. We used the Dirichlet parameter values suggested by Griffiths and Steyvers [2004], α = 50 (number of topics) and β = 0.1. The model was trained by doing 100 sampling iterations in order for the distributions to converge, and then averaging the sampling outcomes of further 50 iterations for the estimates of P (W |Z). For inference on unseen documents, 10 iterations were used for convergence and further 5 iterations for averaging the estimate. German and English terms were made distinguishable by adding the prefixes de and en respectively. Inference was done with this model on the documents in the monolingual blocks.

      "text" : "In the first runs we tested the multilingual pLSA model. The glue documents are the only cross-language bridge and therefore of special importance. Instead of varying the number of glue documents (which is 1000), we gave them higher weight. Both single runs as well as combined runs with concatenated parameter vectors of different dimensionalities were evaluated. Combination was only done for runs with the same weighting.\nModel combination has a major impact on performance, which is explainable by overfitting issues and convergence to local maxima. The first applied weighting scheme multiplied the term counts in the comparable block by a constant weight (we tried values of 2,4,8 and 16). As Figure 6 and Table 2 show, this improved retrieval performance drastically compared with the original model. The higher the weights are chosen, the more the P (w|z) are influenced by the comparable documents, the monolingual doc-\n36\nWikipedia-Based Cross-Language Retrieval Models Benjamin Roth\numents are then rather “pulled” in the latent spaces instead of “pulling” themselves. However, this is only true for the P (w|z) that occur also in the comparable documents. The P (w|z) for words that occur only in monolingual documents provide some transitive clues that would not be present if the model was trained on comparable data only.\nThe other weighting scheme is based on the reasoning that, instead of uniformly weighting multingual documents higher, it could be beneficial to enforce documents that are more multilingual than others. One criterion to regard documents as more\n37\nWikipedia-Based Cross-Language Retrieval Models Benjamin Roth\nmultilingual is the degree to which they are similar in length in both language parts. Therefore we formalize the weight as the geometric mean, dependent on the length of the two language sides lde and len with a small floor count c = 0.001. We call such a document weighting “dynamic”. The dynamic weight yielded the best results for pLSA, it is formalized as:\nwdyn =\n�\n(1− c) lde\nmax(lde, len) + c ·\n�\n(1− c) len\nmax(lde, len) + c\nWith the ESA model we got a score of mrr = 0.7548, which is clearly better than the pLSA model. In order to test whether the ESA model conveys distinct information to the pLSA model, we interpolated both models and multiplied the ESA vectors by a parameter α and the dynamically weighted pLSA vectors by (1 − α) and used the concatenation of both. We got an improvement by 25.7% with mrr = 0.9489 for α = 0.8. See Figure 7.\nFor LDA we performed three types of experiments: First, we sampled a model for the comparable documents with standard LDA without any length normalization, in the manner of [Cimiano et al., 2009]. In fact, it turned out that this produced the worst results of all runs conducted. To estimate whether the different length ratios were responsible for the negative effect, we constructed a new training set containing the same information, but with same length ratios. For this end we multiplied the counts of the shorter language side to match the counts of the longer one. As the\n38\nWikipedia-Based Cross-Language Retrieval Models Benjamin Roth\nsampling procedure needs integers, we rounded the new counts. Figure 8 and Table 3 show that this has a drastic impact on performance. This is in accordance with our theoretical assumptions. In another experiment on the stretched data, we multiplied (after inference was done) each sampled topic outcome with a weight according to the inverse document frequency of the word it was sampled for. The reasoning behind that was to increase the influence of discriminative terms. We found that this brought a slight improvement but it does not preserve the theoretical properties of the topic statistics.\nIn order to estimate how much different information the two latent variable models convey, we interpolated the dynamically weighted pLSA (α) model with the idf weighted stretched LDA model (1−α). We got mrr = 0.7063 for α = 0.4, which is an improvement of 8.0% with respect to the LDA run alone.\n39\nWikipedia-Based Cross-Language Retrieval Models Benjamin Roth\nFigure 9 shows topic distributions for the German and the English monolingual blocks for which inference was done with LDA models trained on either the stretched or the bare comparable block. It can never be expected that the inferred topics are the same for two text sets; in our case the monolingual documents might focus on different thematical aspects. However, for the unstretched model it is almost consistently the case that topics predominant in one language do rarely occur in the other language. We take this as evidence that such a model primarily estimates the language of a document.\nWe also tried runs that applied a tf.idf weighting to the document matrix in the pLSA setting. This weighting had a slightly negative effect on performance. Moreover, it does not integrate well in the theoretical models, therefore we will not discuss these results further."

We tried two methods: First, every document was cut off at a length of 100 words. Second, for the longer language side of an article only a random sample of size equal to the smaller language side was retained. A resizing with a scalar is not possible because the sampling process requires integer counts. We marked each word with a prefix indicating its language and retained a vocabulary size of roughly 770 thousand and 2.1 million for the cut-off method and for the downsampling method respectively.

In order to get a stable estimate, the statistics of 50 sampling iterations were averaged. Similarity in the LDA setup was measured by taking the cosine similarity between the sampling statistics.\nA drastic improvement over non-normalized LDA can be observed: while Sorg and Cimiano [2008] report a score of mrr = 0.16 for their 500-dimensional LDA model, we get mrr = 0.53 with the cut-off corpus.

For our experiments the title and description fields of the queries were used and the narrative was ignored.\nA common strategy for cross-language retrieval is first to translate the query and then to perform monolingual retrieval. While the translation process would have taken prohibitively long for the Multext corpus, we performed query translation on the CLEF2000 queries with a standard Moses translation model trained on Europarl. Retrieval with the translated queries was done by comparing the cosine of the tf.idfweighted word-vectors; we used formula (11) on page 29 to compute this weighting.\nWe evaluated both the machine translation model and the concept models trained on\n12http://www.clef-campaign.org/\n46\nWikipedia-Based Cross-Language Retrieval Models Benjamin Roth\nWikipedia.

The ESA and the cut-off LDA models with dim = 500 perform equally well for map, while the combination of LDA dimensions gets a considerably better score. This is in contrast to the findings in the mate-retrieval setup. The reason for that, we suspect, may be that the parameters of ESA have been found in order to optimize such a setting. For gmap, LDA consistently outperforms ESA. For the combined LDA-ESA model no clear improvement could be observed using the combination with α = .4 from the previous experiment. The machine translation model (map = .203) performed better than the concept models.

On page 50 we report the score that is obtained by machine translation and the increase when combined with the concept models.

It would be possible to recognize this type of error automatically. In addition, for every translated query we counted how many words in it had no semantic meaning related to the purpose of the query and were therefore useless (these words are hence called junk words). Junk words are, for example, function words not filtered by the stopword list, machine translation errors of several kinds and artefacts from the query formulation, mainly from the description part (e.g. “relevant documents contain information about...”). The junk word error type would be more difficult to detect.\nAlthough the analyzed data basis is small, we conjecture that the concept model makes such queries more robust which induce one of the two errors, while it might be less useful where a good translation is present and the terms are weighted well: In the cases where the concept models contributed there were, on average, 0.53 unknown words for machine translation and 0.24% junk words, in contrast to 0.14 unknown words and 0.04% junk words in the cases where the concept model decreased the score.

The question therefore arises how parallel text or word-to-word mappings that are less dispersing than those obtained from documentlevel co-occurrences can be replaced by information extracted from freely available knowledge sources such as Wikipedia.\nSeveral approaches in this direction have been undertaken. Often, a Wikipedia title in the source language is associated with a word and the corresponding title in the target language is used as a translation [Wentland et al., 2008, Nguyen et al., 2009]. However, Sjobergh et al. [2008] note that the vocabulary distribution of titles has a skew to certain words: 33% are normal nouns, 66% proper nouns and only 0.03% verbs. Because the titles of Wikipedia articles are specifically tailored to be unique identifiers rather than representative text samples, translations of large classes of words might introduce artefacts. Also, titles are usually in a normal form which could be problematic in highly inflecting languages or when a variation is used. Another, more general approach is to construct a parallel corpus out of a comparable corpus by finding parallel sentences [Maeda et al., 2008, Adafre and de Rijke, 2006] which can then be used to enhance the training set of a machine translation system. However, such an extraction is complicated and still requires a parallel corpus to perform well.\nAn optimal translation model based on Wikipedia should therefore fulfill the follow-\ning demands:\n• It should be based on simple ideas and easily implemented.\n• It should be based on probabilistic principles to be usable in a language modeling\nsetup.\n• The model should be text-to-text rather than title-to-title.\n• The model should only translate text it is trained for.\n51"

We use this assumption and employ P (wF , l = true|wE) for a translation model. It is important to keep in mind that l indicates the linking of the source word. Additionally, translation and linking should be independent of the document, given a source word (but not independent of each other). The translation model of a document DE is the probability distribution that can be paraphrased as:\nThe probability that a word, chosen from D, is linked and has wF as translation.\nUsing the parts defined before and simple reordering gives:\nP (wF , l = true|DE) = �\nwE\nP (wF , l = true|wE)P (wE |DE)\n= �\na\nP (wF |a, l = true) �\nwE\nP (a|l = true, wE)P (l = true|wE)P (wE |DE)\nNote that the inner sum defines P (a, l = true|DE), which similarly to ESA associates a weighting over Wikipedia articles to documents but in addition has a probabilistic\n54\nWikipedia-Based Cross-Language Retrieval Models Benjamin Roth\nsemantics.

The second, Plink′(Q|l,D), tries to account for the training basis problem by weighting all counts in the query by multiplying them with the probability that they are linked. The third, PLDA(Q|D), estimates the probability according to the estimates obtained by the LDA models, in the same way as done in [Wei and Croft, 2006] for monolingual retrieval.

Interestingly, the LDA model gives worse results when applied in a language modeling setup than when used based on sampling statistics on both the query and the document side, as done in chapter 4.3. This might be so because sampling takes the whole context in the query into account, which may be seen as a way of disambiguation of the query words. By the combination of the link models with LDA in the language modeling setup we achieve better map scores on CLEF2000 than in the best vector retrieval setup, however, the results are worse for gmap compared to the vector retrieval setup."

      "text" : "In this thesis, we compare three concept models for cross-language retrieval: First, we adapt probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) for multilingual documents. Experiments with different weighting schemes show that a weighting method favoring bridging documents of equal length in both language sides gives best results. Together with the finding that both monolingual and multilingual Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) behave alike when applied for such documents, we use a training corpus built on Wikipedia where all documents are length-normalized. Thus, we observe a considerable improvement over previously reported scores on the Multext JOC corpus for LDA.\nAnother focus of our work is on model combination. For this end we include Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) in the experiments. We observe that apart from direct translation finding, where it had been evaluated originally, ESA is not competitive with LDA in a query based retrieval task on the CLEF 2000 data set. All concept models perform significantly worse than a model based on machine translation output. However, the combination of machine translation output with concept model information increased performance by 21.1% map in comparison to machine translation alone.\nMachine translation relies on parallel corpora, which may not be available for many language pairs. Concept models like ESA or LDA only capture broad semantic relatedness on document level which might be to unspecific for proper names or other fine-grained distinctions. Therefore, we explore how much cross-lingual information can be carried over by a more specific information source in Wikipedia, namely linked text. We observe, that in a simple vector combination with LDA it already gives results comparable to, but not as good as the best result obtained in a combination run with machine translation.\n14For licensing reasons, we are not allowed to make a direct comparison, but see [Braschler, 2001] for\na survey.\n61"

The language modeling approach leaves much space for further experimentation, since combination of different models is not straightforward. The need for smoothing raises interesting questions on soundness and efficiency. Link models capture only a certain kind of information and suggest weighting schemes to emphasize particular words. For a combined model, another interesting question is therefore how to integrate different weighting schemes. Using a very simple combination scheme, we obtained values that compare favorably to results reported previously on the CLEF 2000 dataset.\nWe have shown how probabilistic techniques that work without parallel training texts can be applied to replace other cross-language retrieval methods. In principle, our methods can be employed wherever language barriers are to be overcome on text level. After all, it would be interesting to see whether our combination techniques, successful for cross-language retrieval, can also contribute to monolingual retrieval.\n62"
