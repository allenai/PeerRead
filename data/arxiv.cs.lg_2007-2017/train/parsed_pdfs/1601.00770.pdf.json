      "text" : "Extracting semantic relations between entities in text is an important and well-studied task in information extraction and natural language processing (NLP). Traditional systems treat this task as a pipeline of two separated tasks, i.e., named entity recognition (NER) (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007; Ratinov and Roth, 2009) and relation extraction (Zelenko et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2005), but recent studies show that end-to-end (joint) modeling of entity and relation is important for high performance (Li and Ji, 2014; Miwa and Sasaki, 2014) since relations interact closely with entity information. For\ninstance, to learn that Toefting and Bolton have an Organization-Affiliation (ORG-AFF) relation in the sentence Toefting transferred to Bolton, the entity information that Toefting and Bolton are Person and Organization entities is important. Extraction of these entities is in turn encouraged by the presence of the context words transferred to, which indicate an employment relation. Previous joint models have employed manual feature based structured learning. An alternative approach to this end-to-end relation extraction task is to employ automatic feature learning via neural network (NN) based models.\nThere are two ways to represent relations between entities using neural networks: recurrent/recursive neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Among these, RNNs fit well to NLP models, since they can directly represent essential linguistic structures, i.e., word sequences (Hammerton, 2001) and constituent/dependency trees (Tai et al., 2015). Despite this representation ability, for relation classification tasks, the previously reported performance using long short-term memory (LSTM) based RNNs (Xu et al., 2015b; Li et al., 2015) is worse than one using CNNs (dos Santos et al., 2015). These previous LSTM-based systems mostly include limited linguistic structures and neural architectures, and do not model entities and relations jointly. We are able to achieve improvements over state-of-the-art models via end-to-end, combined modeling of entities and relations based on richer LSTM-RNN architectures that incorporate complementary linguistic structures.\nWord sequence and tree structure are known to be complementary information for extracting relations. For instance, dependencies between words are not\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n00 77\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 5\nJ an\n2 01\nenough to predict that source and U.S. have an ORGAFF relation in the sentence “This is ...”, one U.S. source said, and the context word said is required for this prediction. Many traditional, feature-based relation classification models extract features from both sequences and parse trees (Zhou et al., 2005). However, previous RNN-based models focus on only one of these linguistic structures (Socher et al., 2012).\nWe present a novel, end-to-end entity and relation extraction model based on both bidirectional sequential (left-to-right and right-to-left) and bidirectional tree-structured (bottom-up and top-down) LSTM-RNNs, to represent both word sequence and dependency tree structures, and to allow joint modeling of entities and relations in a single model. Our model also incorporates curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009) and scheduled sampling (Bengio et al., 2015) to alleviate the problem of lowperformance entity detection in early stages of training, as well as to allow entity information to further help downstream relation extraction. On end-toend entity and relation extraction, we improve over the state-of-the-art feature-based model, with 3.5% (ACE2004) and 4.8% (ACE2005) relative error reductions in F-score. On nominal relation classification (SemEval-2010 Task 8), our model gets a 2.5% relative error reduction in F-score over the state-ofthe-art CNN-based model. Finally, we also ablate and compare our various model components, which leads to some key findings about the contribution and effectiveness of different RNN structures, input dependency relation structures, and joint learning settings."

      "text" : "LSTM-RNNs have been widely used for sequential labeling, such as clause identification (Hammerton, 2001), phonetic labeling (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005), and NER (Hammerton, 2003). Recently, Huang et al. (2015) showed that building a conditional random field (CRF) layer on the top of bidirectional LSTM-RNNs performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods in the part-of-speech (POS) tagging, chunking, and NER.\nFor relation classification, in addition to traditional feature/kernel-based approaches (Zelenko et al., 2003; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), several neu-\nral models have been proposed in the SemEval2010 Task 8 (Hendrickx et al., 2010), including embedding-based models (Hashimoto et al., 2015), CNN-based models (dos Santos et al., 2015), and RNN-based models (Socher et al., 2012). Recently, Xu et al. (2015a) and Xu et al. (2015b) showed that the shortest dependency paths between relation arguments, which were used in feature/kernelbased systems (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), are also useful in NN-based models. Xu et al. (2015b) also showed that LSTM-RNNs are useful for relation classification, but the performance was worse than CNN-based models. Li et al. (2015) compared separate sequence-based and tree-structured LSTMRNNs on relation classification, using basic RNN model structures.\nResearch on tree-structured LSTM-RNNs (Tai et al., 2015) fixes the direction of information propagation from bottom to top, and also cannot handle an arbitrary number of typed children as in a typed dependency tree. Furthermore, no RNNbased relation classification model simultaneously uses word sequence and dependency tree information. We propose several such novel model structures and training settings, investigating the simultaneous use of bidirectional sequential and bidirectional tree-structured LSTM-RNNs to jointly capture linear and dependency context for end-to-end extraction of relations between entities.\nAs for end-to-end (joint) extraction of relations between entities, all existing models are featurebased systems (and no NN-based model has been proposed). Such models include structured prediction (Li and Ji, 2014; Miwa and Sasaki, 2014), integer linear programming (Roth and Yih, 2007; Yang and Cardie, 2013), card-pyramid parsing (Kate and Mooney, 2010), and global probabilistic graphical models (Yu and Lam, 2010; Singh et al., 2013). Among these, structured prediction methods are state-of-the-art on several corpora. We present an improved, NN-based alternative for the end-to-end relation extraction."

The LSTM unit at t-th word consists of a collection of d-dimensional vectors : an input gate it, a forget gate ft, an output gate ot, a memory cell ct, and a hidden state ht. The unit receives an n-dimensional input vector xt, the previous hidden state ht−1, and the memory cell ct−1, and calculates the new vectors using the following equations:\nit = σ ( W (i)xt + U (i)ht−1 + b (i) ) , (1)\nft = σ ( W (f)xt + U (f)ht−1 + b (f) ) ,\not = σ\n(\nW (o)xt + U (o)ht−1 + b (o)\n)\n,\nut = tanh ( W (u)xt + U (u)ht−1 + b (u) ) ,\nct = it ut + ft ct−1, ht = ot tanh(ct),\nwhere σ denotes the logistic function, denotes element-wise multiplication, W and U are weight matrices, and b are bias vectors.

We assign an entity tag to each word using a commonly used encoding scheme BILOU (Begin, Inside, Last, Outside, Unit) (Ratinov and Roth, 2009), where each entity tag represents the entity type and the position of a word in the entity. For example, in Fig. 1, we assign B-PER and L-PER (which denote the beginning and last words of a person entity type, respectively) to each word in Sidney Yates to represent this phrase as a PER (person) entity type.\nWe realize entity detection on the top of the sequence layer.

      "heading" : "3.4 Dependency Layer",
      "text" : "The dependency layer represents a relation between a pair of target words in the dependency tree, and is in charge of relation-specific representations, as is shown in top-right part of Fig. 1. This layer mainly focuses on the shortest path between a pair of target words in the dependency tree (i.e., the path between the least common node and the two target words) since these paths are shown to be effective in relation classification (Xu et al., 2015a). For example, we show the shortest path between Yates and Chicago in the bottom of Fig. 1, and this path well captures the key phrase of their relation, i.e., born in.\nWe employ bidirectional tree-structured LSTMRNNs (i.e., bottom-up and top-down) to represent a relation candidate by capturing the dependency structure around the target word pair. This bidirectional structure propagates to each node not only the information from the leaves but also information from the root. This is especially important for relation extraction, which makes use of argument nodes near the bottom of the tree, and our topdown LSTM-RNN sends information from the top of the tree to such near-leaf nodes (unlike in standard bottom-up LSTM-RNNs).2 Note that the two variants of tree-structured LSTM-RNNs by Tai et al. (2015) are not able to represent our target structures which have a variable number of typed children: the Child-Sum Tree-LSTM does not deal with\n1We also tried beam search but this did not show improvements in initial experiments.\n2We also tried to use one LSTM-RNN by connecting the root (Paulus et al., 2014), but preparing two LSTM-RNNs showed slightly better performance in our initial experiments.\ntypes and the N -ary Tree assumes a fixed number of children. We thus propose a new variant of treestructured LSTM-RNN that shares weight matrices Us for same-type children and also allows variable number of children. For this variant, we calculate vectors in the LSTM unit at t-th node withC(t) children using following equations:\nit = σ W (i)xt + ∑ l∈C(t) U (i) m(l)htl + b (i)  , (4) ftk = σ\nW (f)xt + ∑ l∈C(t) U (f) m(k)m(l)htl + b (f)  , ot = σ\nW (o)xt + ∑ l∈C(t) U (o) m(l)htl + b (o)  , ut = tanh\nW (u)xt + ∑ l∈C(t) U (u) m(l)htl + b (u)  , ct = it ut +\n∑ l∈C(t) ftl ctl,\nht = ot tanh(ct),\nwhere m(·) is a type mapping function. To investigate appropriate structures to represent relations between target word pairs, we experiment with three structure options. We primarily employ the shortest path structure (SPTree), which captures the core dependency path between a target word pair and is widely used in relation extraction models, e.g., (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Xu et al., 2015a). We also try two other dependency structures: SubTree and FullTree. SubTree is the subtree under the lowest common ancestor of the target word pair. This provides additional modifier information to the path and the word pair in SPTree. FullTree is the full dependency tree. This captures context from the entire sentence. While we use one node type for SPTree, we define two node types for SubTree and FullTree, i.e., one for nodes on shortest paths and one for all other nodes. We use the type mapping function m(·) to distinguish these two nodes types."

Next, the output relation candidate vector, which is passed to the subsequent relation classification softmax layer, is constructed as the concatenation dp = [↑hpA ; ↓hp1 ; ↓hp2 ], where ↑hpA is the hidden state vector of the top LSTM unit in the bottom-up LSTM-RNN (representing the lowest common ancestor of the target word pair p), and ↓hp1 , ↓hp2 are the hidden state vectors of the two LSTM units representing the first and second target words in the top-down LSTM-RNN.4 All the corresponding arrows are shown in Fig. 1."

We also compare our tree-structured LSTMRNN (SPTree) with the Child-Sum tree-LSTM on the shortest path of Tai et al. (2015). Child-Sum performs worse than our SPTree model, but not with as big of a decrease as above. This may be because the difference in the models appears only on nodes that have multiple children and all the nodes except for the least common node have one child.\nWe further show results with two counterparts of sequence-based LSTM-RNNs using the shortest path. SPSeq is bidirectional LSTM-RNN on the shortest path. The LSTM unit receives input from the sequence layer concatenated with embeddings for surrounding dependency types and directions. We concatenate the outputs of the two RNNs for the relation candidate. SPXu is our adaptation of the shortest path LSTM-RNN proposed by Xu et al. (2015b) to match our sequence-layer based model.17 This has two LSTM-RNNs for the left and right subpaths of the shortest path. We first calculate the max pooling of the LSTM units for each of these two RNNs, and then concatenate the outputs of the pooling for the relation candidate. The comparison with these sequence-based LSTM-RNNs indicates that a tree-structured LSTM-RNN is comparable to sequence-based ones in representing shortest paths.\nOverall, the performance comparison of the LSTM-RNN structures in Table 4 shows that for relation classification, selecting the appropriate tree structure representation of the input (i.e., SPTree versus SubTree and FullTree) is more important than the choice of the LSTM-RNN structure on that input (i.e., sequential versus tree-based).\nTable 5 summarizes the contribution of several model components and training settings on SemEval relation classification. We first remove the hidden layer by directly connecting the LSTM-RNN layers to the softmax layers. We also skip the sequence layer and directly use the word and POS embeddings for the dependency layer.18 Removing one of hidden\n17This is different from the original one in that we use the sequence layer and we concatenate the embeddings for the input while the original one prepared individual LSTM-RNNs for different input and concatenated the outputs of the LSTM-RNNs.\n18Note that this setting still uses some sequence layer information since it uses the entity-related information (Pair).\nand sequence layers slightly degraded performance, and when removing of both layers, the performance significantly dropped (p<0.001). Removing entityrelated information from the sequence layer (−Pair) did not affect the performance much, but on removing it together with the sequence layer, the performance dropped significantly (p<0.05). This indicates that the sequence layer is necessary but the last words of nominals are almost enough for expressing the relations in this task.\nFinally, for the generation of relation candidates, generating only left-to-right candidates slightly degraded the performance, but the difference was small and hence the creation of right-to-left candidates was not critical. Treating the inverse relation candidate as a negative instance (Negative sampling) also performed comparably to other generation methods in our model (unlike Xu et al. (2015a), which showed a significance improvement over generating only left-to-right candidates)."

Our recurrent neural network based model stacks bidirectional sequential LSTM-RNNs and bidirectional tree-structured LSTMRNNs to capture both word sequence and dependency tree substructure information. This allows our model to jointly represent both entities and relations with shared parameters. We further encourage detection of entities during training and use of entity information in relation extraction via curriculum learning and scheduled sampling. Our model improves over the state-of-the-art feature-based model on end-to-end relation extraction, achieving 3.5% and 4.8% relative error reductions in F-score on ACE2004 and ACE2005, respectively. We also show improvements over the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network based model on nominal relation classification (SemEval-2010 Task 8), with 2.5% relative error reduction in F-score.",
