      "text" : "Deep neural networks have achieved outstanding performance (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2016b). Reducing the tendency of gradients to vanish or explode with depth (Hochreiter, 1991; Bengio et al., 1994) has been essential to this progress.\nCombining careful initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010; He et al., 2015) with batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy,\n*Authors listed alphabetically 1Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand 2Disney Research, Zürich, Switzerland. Correspondence to: David Balduzzi <dbalduzzi@gmail.com>, Brian McWilliams <brian@disneyresearch.com>.\n2015) bakes two solutions to the vanishing/exploding gradient problem into a single architecture. The He initialization ensures variance is preserved across rectifier layers, and batch normalization ensures that backpropagation through layers is unaffected by the scale of the weights (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015).\nIt is perhaps surprising then that residual networks (resnets) still perform so much better than standard architectures when networks are sufficiently deep (He et al., 2016a;b). This raises the question: If resnets are the solution, then what is the problem? We identify the shattered gradient problem: a previously unnoticed difficulty with gradients in deep rectifier networks that is orthogonal to vanishing and exploding gradients. The shattering gradients problem is that, as depth increases, gradients in standard feedforward networks increasingly resemble white noise. Resnets dramatically reduce the tendency of gradients to shatter.\nTerminology. We refer to networks without skip connections as feedforward nets—in contrast to residual nets (resnets) and highway nets. We distinguish between the real-valued output of a rectifier and its binary activation: the activation is 1 if the output is positive and 0 otherwise."

      "text" : "The first step is to simply look at the gradients of neural networks. Gradients are averaged over minibatches, depend on both the loss and the random sample from the data, and are extremely high-dimensional, which introduces multiple confounding factors and makes visualization difficult (but see section 4). We therefore construct a minimal model designed to eliminate these confounding factors. The minimal model is a neural network fW : R → R taking scalars to scalars; each hidden layer contains N = 200 rectifier neurons. The model is not intended to be applied to real data. Rather, it is a laboratory where gradients can be isolated and investigated.\nWe are interested in how the gradient varies, at initializa-\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n08 59\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.N E\n] 2\n8 Fe\nb 20\n17\ntion, as a function of the input:\ndfW dx\n(x(i)) where x(i) ∈ [−2, 2] is in a (1) 1-dim grid of M = 256 “data points”.\nUpdates during training depend on derivatives with respect to weights, not inputs. Our results are relevant because, by the chain rule, ∂fW∂wij = ∂fW ∂nj ∂nj ∂wij . Weight updates thus depend on ∂fW∂nj —i.e. how the output of the network varies with the output of neurons in one layer (which are just inputs to the next layer).\nThe top row of figure 1 plots dfWdx (x (i)) for each point x(i) in the 1-dim grid. The bottom row shows the (absolute value) of the covariance matrix: |(g − ḡ)(g − ḡ)>|/σ2g where g is the 256-vector of gradients, ḡ the mean, and σ2g the variance.\nIf all the neurons were linear then the gradient would be a horizontal line (i.e. the gradient would be constant as a function of x). Rectifiers are not smooth, so the gradients are discontinuous.\nGradients of shallow networks resemble brown noise. Suppose the network has a single hidden layer: fw,b(x) = w>ρ(x · v − b). Following Glorot & Bengio (2010), weights w and biases b are sampled from N (0, σ2) with σ2 = 1N . Set v = (1, . . . , 1).\nFigure 1a shows the gradient of the network for inputs x ∈ [−2, 2] and its covariance matrix. Figure 1d shows a discrete approximation to brownian motion: BN (t) =∑t s=1Ws where Ws ∼ N (0, 1N ). The plots are strikingly similar: both clearly exhibit spatial covariance structure. The resemblance is not coincidental: section A1 applies\nDonsker’s theorem to show the gradient converges to brownian motion as N →∞.\nGradients of deep networks resemble white noise. Figure 1b shows the gradient of a 24-layer fully-connected rectifier network. Figure 1e shows white noise given by samples Wk ∼ N (0, 1). Again, the plots are strikingly similar. Since the inputs lie on a 1-dim grid, it makes sense to compute the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the gradient. Figures 2a and 2d compare this function for feedforward networks of different depth with white and brown noise. The ACF for shallow networks resembles the ACF of brown noise. As the network gets deeper, the ACF quickly comes to resemble that of white noise.\nTheorem 1 explains this phenomenon. We show that correlations between gradients decrease exponentially 1\n2L with\ndepth in feedforward rectifier networks.\nTraining is difficult when gradients behave like white noise. The shattered gradient problem is that the spatial structure of gradients is progressively obliterated as neural nets deepen. The problem is clearly visible when inputs are taken from a one-dimensional grid, but is difficult to observe when inputs are randomly sampled from a highdimensional dataset.\nShattered gradients undermine the effectiveness of algorithms that assume gradients at nearby points are similar such as momentum-based and accelerated methods (Sutskever et al., 2013; Balduzzi et al., 2016). If dfWdnj behaves like white noise, then a neuron’s effect on the output of the network (whether increasing weights causes the network to output more or less) becomes extremely unstable\nmaking learning difficult.\nGradients of deep resnets lie in between brown and white noise. Introducing skip-connections allows much deeper networks to be trained (Srivastava et al., 2015; He et al., 2016b;a; Greff et al., 2017). Skip-connections significantly change the correlation structure of gradients. Figure 1c shows the concrete example of a 50-layer resnet which has markedly more structure than the equivalent feedforward net (figure 1b). Figure 2b shows the ACF of resnets of different depths. Although the gradients become progressively less structured, they do not whiten to the extent of the gradients in standard feedforward networks— there are still correlations in the 50-layer resnet whereas in the equivalent feedforward net, the gradients are indistinguishable from white noise. Figure 2c shows the dramatic effect of recently proposed β-rescaling (Szegedy et al., 2016): the ACF of even the 50 layer network resemble brown-noise.\nTheorem 3 shows that correlations between gradients decay sublinearly with depth 1√\nL for resnets with batch normal-\nization. We also show, corollary 1, that modified highway networks (where the gates are scalars) can achieve a depth independent correlation structure on gradients. The analysis explains why skip-connections, combined with suitable rescaling, preserve the structure of gradients."

(2006). The insight of Glorot & Bengio (2010) is that controlling the variance of the distributions from which weights are sampled allows to control how layers progressively amplify or dampen the variance of activations and error signals. More recently, He et al. (2015) refined the approach to take rectifiers into account. Rectifiers effectively halve the variance since, at initialization and on average, they are active for half their inputs. Orthogonalizing weight matrices can yield further improvements albeit at a computational cost (Saxe et al., 2014; Mishkin & Matas, 2016). The observation that the norms of weights form a random walk was used by Sussillo & Abbott (2015) to tune the gains of neurons.\nIn short, it has proven useful to treat weights and gradients as random variables, and carefully examine their effect on the variance of the signals propagated through the network. This paper presents a more detailed analysis that considers correlations between gradients at different datapoints.\nThe closest work to ours is Veit et al. (2016), which shows resnets behave like ensembles of shallow networks. We provide a more detailed analysis of the effect of skipconnections on gradients. A recent paper showed resnets have universal finite-sample expressivity and may lack spurious local optima (Hardt & Ma, 2017) but this does not explain why deep feedforward networks are harder to train than resnets. An interesting hypothesis is that skipconnections improve performance by breaking symmetries (Orhan, 2017).\nThe Shattered Gradients Problem"

      "text" : "Batch normalization was introduced to reduce covariate shift (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015). However, it has other effects that are less well-known. We investigate the impact of batch normalization at initialization (i.e. when it meancenters and rescales to unit variance).\nWe first investigate batch normalization’s effect on neural activations. Neurons are active for half their inputs on average, figure 3, with or without batch normalization. Figure 3 also shows how often neurons are co-active for two inputs. With batch normalization, neurons are co-active for 1 4 of distinct pairs of inputs, which is what would happen if activations were decided by unbiased coin flips. Without batch normalization, the co-active proportion climbs with depth, suggesting neuronal responses are increasingly redundant. Resnets with batch normalization behave the same as feeforward nets (not shown).\nFigure 4 takes a closer look. It turns out that computing the proportion of inputs causing neurons to be active on average is misleading. The distribution becomes increasingly bimodal with depth. In particular, neurons are either always active or always inactive for layer 50 in the feedforward net without batch normalization (blue histogram in figure 4a). Batch normalization causes most neurons to be active for half the inputs, blue histograms in figures 4b,c.\nNeurons that are always active may as well be linear. Neurons that are always inactive may as well not exist. It follows that batch normalization increases the efficiency with which rectifier nonlinearities are utilized.\nThe increased efficiency comes at a price. The raster plot\nfor feedforward networks resembles static television noise: the spatial structure is obliterated. Resnets (Figure 4c) exhibit a compromise where neurons are utilized efficiently but the spatial structure is also somewhat preserved. The preservation of spatial structure is quantified via the contiguity histograms which counts long runs of consistent activation. Resnets maintain a broad distribution of contiguity even with deep networks whereas batch normalization on feedforward nets shatters these into small sections."

      "text" : "This section analyzes the correlation structure of gradients in neural nets. The main ideas and results are presented, with the details provided in section A3.\nPerhaps the simplest way to probe the structure of a random process is to measure the first few moments: the mean, variance and covariance. We investigate how the correlation between typical datapoints (defined below) changes with network structure and depth. Weaker correlations correspond to whiter gradients.\nThe analysis is for fully-connected networks. Extending to convnets involves (significant) additional bookkeeping.\nProof strategy. The covariance defines an inner product on the vector space of real-valued random variables with mean zero and finite second moment. It was shown in Balduzzi et al. (2015); Balduzzi (2016) that the gradients in neural nets are sums of path-weights over active paths. The first step in the proof is to observe that path-weights are orthogonal with respect to the variance inner product. To express gradients as linear combinations of path-weights is thus to express them over an orthogonal basis.\nWorking in the path-weight basis reduces computing the covariance between gradients at different datapoints to counting the number of paths through the network that are co-active. The second step of the proof is to count co-active paths and adjust for rescaling factors (for example due to batch normalization).\nThe following assumption simplifies the analysis:\nAssumption 1 (typical datapoints). We say x(i) and x(j) are typical datapoints if half of neurons per layer are active for each and a quarter per layer are co-active for both. We assume all pairs of datapoints are typical.\nFigure 3 shows the assumption holds under batch normalization for both activations and coactivations. The initialization in He et al. (2015) assumes datapoints activate half the neurons per layer. The assumption on co-activations is implied by (and so weaker than) the assumption in Choromanska et al. (2015) that activations are Bernoulli random variables independent of the inputs.\nCorrelations between gradients. Weight updates in a neural network are proportional to\n∆wjk ∝ #mb∑\ni=1\nP∑\np=1\n∂`\n∂fp ∂fp ∂nk ∂nk ∂wjk\n( x(i) ) .\nThe derivatives ∂`∂fp and ∂nk ∂wjk do not depend on the network’s internal structure. We are interested in the middle term ∂fp∂nk , which does. Without loss of generality, pick a neuron n separated from the output by L layers.\nIt is mathematically convenient to work with the sum∑P p=1 fp over output coordinates of the network. We do so to highlight the contribution of the network’s internal structure to the gradients. Section 4 shows that our results hold for convnets on real-data with the cross-entropy loss. See also remark A2. Definition 1. Let∇i := ∑P p=1 ∂fp ∂n (x\n(i)) be the derivative with respect to neuron n given input x(i) ∈ D. For each input x(i), the derivative ∇i is a real-valued random variable. It has mean zero since weights are sampled from distributions with mean zero.

      "text" : "In this section we provide empirical evidence that the main results also hold for deep convnets using the CIFAR-10 dataset. We instantiate feedforward and resnets with 2, 4, 10, 24 and 50 layers of equivalent size. Using a slight modification of the “bottleneck” architecture in He et al. (2016a), we introduce one skip-connection for every two convolutional layers and both network architectures use batch normalization.\nFigures 5a and b compare the covariance of gradients in the first layer of feedforward and resnets (β = 0.1) with a minibatch of 256 random samples from CIFAR-10 for networks of depth 2 and 50. To highlight the spatial structure of the gradients, the indices of the minibatches were reordered according to a k-means clustering (k = 10) applied to the gradients of the two-layer networks. The same permutation is used for all networks within a row. The spatial structure is visible in both two-layer networks, although it is more apparent in the resnet. In the feedforward network the structure quickly disappears with depth. In the resnet, the structure remains apparent at 50 layers.\nTo quantify this effect we consider the “whiteness” of the gradient using relative effective rank. Let ∆ be the matrix whose columns are the gradients with respect to the input, for each datapoint x(i) in a minibatch. The effective rank is r(∆) = tr(∆>∆)/‖∆‖22 and measures the intrinsic dimension of a matrix (Vershynin, 2012). It is bounded above by the rank of ∆—a matrix with highly correlated columns and therefore more structure will have a lower effective rank. We are interested in the effective rank of the covariance matrix of the gradients relative to a “white” matrix Y of the same dimensions with i.i.d. Gaussian entries. The relative effective rank r(∆)/r(Y) measures the similarity between the second moments of ∆ and Y.\nFigure 5c shows that the relative effective rank (averaged over 30 minibatches) grows much faster as a function of depth for networks without skip-connections. For resnets, the parameter β slows down the rate of growth of the effective rank as predicted by theorem 3.\nFigure 5d shows the average `2-norm of the gradient in each coordinate (normalized by the standard deviation computed per minibatch). We observe that this quantity decays much more rapidly as a function of depth for feedforward networks. This is due to the effect of averaging increasingly whitening gradients within each minibatch. In other words, the noise within minibatches overwhelms the signal. The phenomenon is much less pronounced in resnets.\nTaken together these results confirm the results in section 3 for networks with convolutional layers and show that the gradients in resnets are indeed more structured than those in feedforward nets and therefore do not vanish when averaged within a minibatch. This phenomena allows for the training of very deep resnets."

The thinness of the architecture makes it particularly difficult for gradients to propagate at high depth. The reduction is performed by convolutional layers with strides of 2, and following the last reduction the representation is passed to a fully connected layer with 10 neurons for classification. The numbers of filters per layer of the CReLU models were adjusted by a factor of 1/ √ 2 to achieve parameter parity with the ReLU models. The Resnet version of the model is the same as the basic ReLU model with skip-connections after every two modules following He et al.

(2014) that the number of linear regions can grow exponentially with depth (but only polynomially with width). Hence deep neural networks are capable of far richer mappings than shallow ones (Telgarsky, 2016). An underappreciated consequence of the exponential growth in linear regions is the proliferation of discontinuities in the gradients of rectifier nets.\nThis paper has identified and analyzed a previously unnoticed problem with gradients in deep networks: in a randomly initialized network, the gradients of deeper layers are increasingly uncorrelated. Shattered gradients play havoc with the optimization methods currently in use2 and may explain the difficulty in training deep feedforward networks even when effective initialization and batch normalization are employed. Averaging gradients over minibatches becomes analogous to integrating over white noise – there is no clear trend that can be summarized in a single average direction. Shattered gradients can also introduce numerical instabilities, since small differences in the input can lead to large differences in gradients.\nSkip-connections in combination with suitable rescaling reduce shattering. Specifically, we show that the rate at which correlations between gradients decays changes from exponential for feedforward architectures to sublinear for resnets. The analysis uncovers a surprising and (to us at least) unexpected side-effect of batch normalization. An alternate solution to the shattering gradient problem is to design initializations that do not shatter such as the LLinit. An interesting future direction is to investigate hybrid architectures combining the LL-init with skip connections.\n2Note that even the choice of a step size in SGD typically reflects an assumption about the correlation scale of the gradients.\nThe Shattered Gradients Problem"

The derivative of the neural net with respect to its input is:\nd\ndx fw,b(x) =\n∑\nx>bi\nwi. (A2)\nIf we vary x, then the (A2) is a random walk that jumps at points sampled from a Gaussian. In contrast, discrete Brownian motion, (A1), jumps at uniformly spaced points in the unit interval.\nRelabel the neurons so the biases are ordered\nb1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ bN without loss of generality. A rectifier is active if its output is nonzero. Let A(x) = {i : x > bi} denote the vector of hidden neurons that are active for input x. Ordering the neurons by their bias terms means the derivative only depends on |A(x)|, the number of active neurons:\nd\ndx fw,b(x) =\n|A(x)|∑\ni=1\nwi.\nFinally, we can write the derivative as a function of the fraction t ∈ [0, 1] of neurons that are active:\nd\ndx fw,b(t) =\nbNtc∑\ni=1\nwi.\nThe result follows by Donsker’s theorem since the weights are sampled from N (0, 1N )."

A fundamental tool is to expand a function in terms of an orthonormal basis f(x) = ∑ k αkek(x) where the basis satisfies 〈ej(x), ek(x)〉 = 1j=k. A classical example is the Fourier expansion; a more recent example is wavelets.\nA powerful tool for analyzing random processes based on the same philosophy is the Karhunen-Loeve transform. The idea is to represent random processes as linear combinations of orthogonal vectors or functions. For example, principal component analysis is a special case of the KarhunenLoeve transform.\nThe weights of a neural network at initialization are random variables. We can therefore model the output of the neural\nThe Shattered Gradients Problem\nnetwork as a random process indexed by datapoints. That is, for each x(i) ∈ D, the output fW(x(i)) is a random variable. Similarly, the gradients of the neural network form a random process indexed by the data.\nThe main technical insight underlying the analysis below is that path-weights (Balduzzi et al., 2015; Balduzzi, 2016) provide an orthogonal basis relative to the inner product on random variables given by the covariance. The role played by path-weights in the analysis of gradients is thus analogous to the role of sin, cos and exp in Fourier analysis.\nA3.1. Covariance structure of path-sums\nLemma A2 below shows that gradients are sums over products of weights, where the products are “zeroed out” if any neuron along the path is inactive. In this section we develop a minimal mathematical model of path-sums that allows us to compute covariances and correlations between gradients in rectifier networks.\nTo keep things simple, the model is of a network of L layers each of which contains N neurons. Let W be a random (N,N,L−1)-tensor with entries given by independent random variables with mean zero and variance σ2. A path is a sequence of numbersα = (α1, . . . αL) ∈ [N ]L. The pathweight α is Wα := ∏L−1 l=1 W[αl, αl+1, l], the product of the weights along the path.\nPath-weights are random variables. The expected weight of a path is zero. Paths are uncorrelated unless they coincide exactly:\nE[Wα] = 0 and E[WαWβ] = { σ2(L−1) if α = β 0 else.\n(A3) Remark A1. Equation (A3) implies that path-weights are orthogonal under the inner product given by covariance.\nAn activation configuration A is a binary N × L-matrix. Path α is active under configurationA if all neurons along the path are active, i.e. if Aα = ∏L l=1A[αl, l] = 1, otherwise the path is inactive. The number of active paths in configurationA is\n|A| := ∑\nα∈[N ]L Aα.\nThe number of co-active paths in configurationsA andB is\n|A ∩B| := ∑\nα∈[N ]L Aα ·Bα.\nFinally, the path-sum under configuration A is the sum of the weights of all active paths:\npW(A) = ∑\nα∈[N ]L Wα ·Aα.\nLemma A1.

The setup of lemma A2 is quite specific. It is chosen for mathematical convenience. In particular, the numerical coincidence that multiplying the number of paths by the variance of the paths yields exactly one, when weights are initialized according to (He et al., 2015), makes the formulas easier on the eye.\nThe theorems are concerned with the large-scale behavior of the variance and covariance as a function of the number of layers (e.g. exponential versus sublinear decay). Their broader implications—but not the precise quantities—are robust to substantial changes to the setup.\nProof of theorem 1.\nProof. Lemma A2 implies that gradients are sums over path-weights.\na) By lemma A1 the gradient decomposes as a sum over active paths. There are NL paths through the network.\nThe Shattered Gradients Problem\nIf half the neurons per layer are active, then there are |A(xi)| = (N2 )L active paths. Each path is a product of L weights and so has covariance σ2L = ( 2N )\nL. Thus, by lemma A1\n( N\n2\n)L · ( 2\nN\n)L = L∏\nl=1\n(1) = 1.\nb) The number of coactive neurons per layer is N4 and so there are |A(xi) ∩ A(xj)| = (N4 )L coactive paths.

Covariance structure of residual path-sums\nDerivatives in resnets are path-sums as before. However, skip-connections complicate their structure. We adapt the minimal model in section A3.1 to resnets as follows.\nA residual path is a pair α̃ = (F,α) where F ⊂ [L] and α ∈ [N ]|F |. The subset F specifies the layers that are not skipped; α specifies the neurons in those layers. The length of the path is l(α̃) = |F |. Let P res denote the set of all residual paths. Let Fi denote the ith element of F , listed from smallest to largest. Given weight tensor W as in section A3.1, the weight of path α̃ is\nW̃α̃ = { 1 if F = ∅∏|F |−1 i=1 W[αi, αi+1, Fi] else.\nRemark A3. We adopt the convention that products over empty index sets equal one.\nPath α̃ is active under configurationA if Ãα̃ = 1 where\nÃα̃ =\n|F |∏\ni=1\nA[αi, Fi]\nThe residual path-sum under configurationA is\nrW(A) = ∑\nα̃∈P res W̃α̃ · Ãα̃.\nRestricting to F = [L] recovers the definitions for standard feedforward networks in section A3.1.\nThe number of co-active paths shared by configurations A andB on the layers in F is\n|A ∩B|F = ∑\nα∈[N ]|F | A[αi, Fi] ·B[αi, Fi].\nLemma A3.

The theorem is proved in the setting of lemma A2, see remark A2 for justification.\nThe Shattered Gradients Problem\nProof. a) Theorem 2 implies that each additional layer (without batch normalization) doubles the contribution to the variance of gradients, which we write schematically as vl+1 = 2vl = 2\nl, the variance of the (l+1)st layer is double the lth layer.\nBatch normalization changes the schema to\nvl+1 = vl + 1\nwhere vl is the variance of the previous layer and +1 is added to account for additional variance generated by the non-skip connection (which is renormalized to have unitvariance). The variance of active path sums through (l+ 1) layers is therefore\nvl+1 = l + 1. (A4)\nFinally the variance of gradient CresBN (xi) = vL = L. b) The above schema for batch normalization can be written\nvl+1 = vl + vl l = vl\n( 1 + 1\nl\n)\nwhere the rescaling factor 1l is the expected variance of the previous layer per Eq. (A4). Unrolling yields\nvL =\nL−1∏\nl=1\n( 1 + 1\nl\n) = L.\nTaking into account the fact that applying batchnormalization to the lth-layer rescales by 1√\nl , the resnet\nmodule can be written in expectation as\nxl+1 = xl + ρBN (W l+1xl) = xl + ρ(Wl+1xl)√ l .\nThe contribution of each (non-skip) layer to the covariance is half its contribution to the variance since we assume the two inputs are co-active on a quarter of the neurons per layer. The covariance is therefore given by\nL−1∏\nl=1\n( 1 + 1\n2 · 1 l\n) ∼ √ 2L\nas required.\nTo intuit the approximation, observe that\nL−1∏\nl=1\n( 1 + 1\n2l\n) · ( 1 + 1\n2l − 1\n) = 2L−2∏\nl=1\n( 1 + 1\nl\n) = 2L−1\nSince ( 1 + 12l ) ∼ ( 1 + 12l−1 ) , rewrite as\nL−1∏\nl=1\n( 1 + 1\n2l\n)2 ∼ 2L−2∏\nl=1\n( 1 + 1\nl\n) = 2L− 1\nand so ∏L−1 l=1 ( 1 + 12l ) ∼ √ L. Numerically we find ∏L−1 l=1 ( 1 + 12l ) ∼ √ 4 π (L+ 1) to be a good approximation for large L.\nProof of theorem 3 for general β. The theorem is proved in the setting of lemma A2, see remark A2 for justification.\nProof. a) The introduction of β-rescaling changes the schema to\nvl+1 = vl\n( 1 +\nβ2\nβ2(l − 1) + 1\n) .\nThe proof then follows from the observation that\nL−1∏\nl=1\n( 1 +\nβ2\nβ2(l − 1) + 1\n) = β2(L− 1) + 1.\nb) The covariance is given by\nL−1∏\nl=1\n( 1 + 1\n2\nβ2\nβ2(l − 1) + 1\n) ∼ β √ L\nby similar working to when β = 1.\nA3.5.

The problem has largely been overcome through the introduction of carefully constructed initializations and batch normalization. Nevertheless, architectures incorporating skip-connections such as resnets perform much better than standard feedforward architectures despite well-chosen initialization and batch normalization. In this paper, we identify the shattered gradients problem. Specifically, we show that the correlation between gradients in standard feedforward networks decays exponentially with depth resulting in gradients that resemble white noise. In contrast, the gradients in architectures with skipconnections are far more resistant to shattering decaying sublinearly. Detailed empirical evidence is presented in support of the analysis, on both fully-connected networks and convnets. Finally, we present a new “looks linear” (LL) initialization that prevents shattering. Preliminary experiments show the new initialization allows to train very deep networks without the addition of skip-connections.",
