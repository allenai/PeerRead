      "text" : "Network embedding, which aims at learning lowdimensional vector representations of a network, has attracted increasing interest in recent years. It has been shown highly effective in many important tasks in network analysis involving predictions over nodes and edges, such as node classification (Tsoumakas and Katakis 2006; Sen et al. 2008), recommendation (Tu, Liu, and Sun 2014; Yu et al. 2014) and link prediction (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg 2007).\nVarious approaches have been proposed toward this goal, typically including Deepwalk (Perozzi, Al-Rfou, and Skiena 2014), LINE (Tang et al. 2015), GraRep (Cao, Lu, and Xu 2015), and node2vec (Grover and Leskovec 2016). These models have been proven effective in several real world networks. Most of the previous approaches utilize information only from the network structure, i.e., the linkage relationships between nodes, while paying scant attention to the content of each node, which is common in real-world networks. In a typical social network with users as vertices, the user-generated contents (e.g., texts, images) will serve as rich extra information which should be important for node representation and beneficial to downstream applications.\nFigure 1 shows an example network from Quora, a community question answering website. Users in Quora can follow each other, creating directed connections in the network.\nMore importantly, users are expected to ask or answer questions, which can be treated as users’ contents. These contents are critical for identifying the characteristics of users, and thus will significantly benefit tasks like node classification (e.g. gender, location and profession). For example, we can infer from the contents of user A and user C (Figure 1) that they are likely to be female users (gender). Besides, user B is supposed to be a programmer (profession) and user D probably lives in New York (location).\nTo cope with this challenge, Yang et al. (2015) presented text-associated DeepWalk (TADW), which incorporates textual features into network embeddings through matrix factorization. This approach typically suffers from high computational cost and not scalable to large-scale networks. Besides, contents in TADW are simply incorporated as unordered text features instead of being explicitly modeled. Therefore, deeper semantics contained in the contents cannot be well captured.\nPresent work. We present a general framework for learning Content-Enhanced Network Embedding (CENE) that is capable of jointly leveraging the network structure and the contents. We consider textual contents in this study, however, our approach can be flexibly scaled to other modalities of content. Specifically, each piece of content information (e.g., a tweet one posts in twitter, a question one follows in Quora) is formalized as a document, and we integrate each document into the network by creating a special\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n02 90\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.S I]\n1 0\nO ct\n2 01\n6\nkind of node, whose representation will be computed compositionally from words. The resulting augmented network will consist of two kinds of links: the node-node link and the node-content link. By optimizing the joint objective, the knowledge contained in the contents will be effectively distilled into node embeddings.\nTo summarize, we make the following contributions:\n• We propose a novel network embedding model that captures both textual contents and network structure. Experiments on the tasks of node classification using two real world datasets demonstrate its superiority over various baseline methods.\n• We collect a network dataset which contains node attributes and rich textual contents. It will be made publicly available for research purpose."

      "text" : "In order to obtain text embeddings (e.g., sentence, paragraph), a simple and intuitive approach would be averaging the embeddings of each word in the text (Mitchell and Lapata 2010; Ferrone and Zanzotto 2013; Iyyer et al. 2015). More sophisticated models have been designed to utilize the internal structure of sentences or documents to assist the composition. For example, Socher et al. (2013) and Socher et al. (2014) use recursive neural networks over parse trees to obtain sentence representations. To alleviate the dependency on syntatic parsing, convolutional neural networks (CNN) (Blunsom, Grefenstette, and Kalchbrenner 2014; Johnson and Zhang 2015) are employed which use simple bottom-up hierarchical structures for composition. Another alternative model is the LSTM-based recurrent neural network (RNN) (Kiros et al. 2015), which is a variant of RNN that uses long short-term memory cells for capturing longterm dependencies."

      "text" : "Hoff, Raftery, and Handcock (2002) first propose to learn latent space representation of vertices in a network. Some earlier works focus on the feature vectors and the leading eigenvectors are regarded as the network representations, e.g., MDS (Borg and Groenen 2005), IsoMap (Tenenbaum, De Silva, and Langford 2000), LLE (Roweis and Saul 2000), and Laplacian Eigenmaps (Belkin and Niyogi 2001).\nRecent advancements include DeepWalk (Perozzi, AlRfou, and Skiena 2014), which learns vertex embeddings using the skip-gram model (Mikolov et al. 2013b) on vertex sequences generated by random walking on the network. Inspired by Deepwalk, walklet (Perozzi, Kulkarni, and Skiena 2016) focuses on multiscale representation learning, node2vec (Grover and Leskovec 2016) explores different random walk strategy and Ou et al. (2016) emphasises the asymmetric transitivity of a network. Some others focus on depicting the distance between vertices. LINE (Tang et al. 2015) exploits both first-order and second-order proximity in an network while Cao, Lu, and Xu (2015) expand the proximity into k-order (or k-step) and integrates global\nstructural information of the network into the learning process. These methods could also be applied to prediction tasks in heterogeneous text networks (Tang, Qu, and Mei 2015). Another attempt is based on the factorization of relationship matrix (Yang and Liu 2015). Most recently, Wang, Cui, and Zhu (2016) adopt a deep model to capture the nonlinear network structure.\nYang et al. (2015) present the first work that combines structure and content information for learning network embeddings. They show that DeepWalk is equivalent to matrix factorization (MF) and text features of vertices can be incorporated via factorizing a text-associated matrix. This method, however, suffers from the high computation cost of MF and has difficulties scaling to large-scale networks. Pan et al. (2016) instead combines DeepWalk with Doc2Vec (Le and Mikolov 2014), along with partial labels of nodes that constitutes a semi-supervised model. However, Doc2Vec is far from being expressive of the contents. Besides, it cannot generalize to other modalities of contents like images."

(Network) Let G = (V,E,C) denote a network, where V is the set of vertices, representing the nodes of the network; E ⊆ (V × V ) is the set of edges, representing the relations between the nodes; and C denotes the contents of nodes. C = {(v, doc)|v ∈ V ; doc = {Si}}, where Si denotes i-th sentence of doc and is composed of word sequence < w1, w2, . . . , wn >. Without loss of generality, we assume the structure of network to be a directed graph.1 Definition 2. (Network Embedding) Given a network denoted as G = (V,E,C), the aim of network embedding is to allocate a low dimensional real-valued vector representation ev ∈ Rd for each vertex v ∈ V , where d |V |. Let θ = (e1, e2, . . . , e|V |) denotes the embedded vectors in the latent space. θ is supposed to maintain as much topological information of the original network as possible.\nAs ev can be regarded as a feature vector of vertex v, it is straightforward to use it as the input of subsequent tasks like node classification. Another notable trait is that this kind of embedding is not task-specific so that it can be applied to different kinds of tasks without retraining."

      "text" : "To maintain the structural information of a network, we describe a general framework that minimizes the following objective:\nLg = ∑\n(u,v)∈SP\nlog p(u, v; θ) + ∑\n(u,v)∈SN\nlog (1− p(u, v; θ))\n(1) where SP is the set of positive vertex pairs and SN is negative pair set. For example, in Deepwalk based algorithms\n1Undirected networks can be readily converted to directed ones by replacing each undirected edge with two oppositely directed edges.\n(Deepwalk, walklet, node2vec), SP is the set of adjacent vertex pairs in the routes generated through random walking, and SN is the union of all negative sampling sets. p(u, v; θ) is the joint probability between vertex u and v, which means the probability of pair (u, v) existing in SP and correspondingly 1 − p(u, v; θ) is the probability that (u, v) does not exist.\nTo further utilize the content information, a simple way is to concatenate the content embedding with the node embedding, both of which are trained independently. Formally, let eu = eu ⊕ fe(Cu) be the representation of node u, where Cu = {(u, c)|(u, c) ∈ C} is the set of all contents of node u. This method, however, requires each node in the network to be associated with some contents, which is too rigid for real world networks.\nIn this paper, we introduce contents (documents) as a special kind of nodes, and then the augmented network can be represented as: Gaug = (Vn, Vc, Enn, Enc), where Vn = V is vertex set; Vc = {c|(u, c) ∈ C, u ∈ V } is the content set; Enn = E is the set of edges between vertices; and Enc = Vn×Vc is the set of edges between vertices and contents. In this way, different nodes can also interact through connection with a same content node (e.g., two Twitter users retweet the same post), which significantly alleviates the structural sparsity in Enn. The resulting framework structure is illustrated in Figure 2.\nNext, we will describe the loss functions involving nodenode links and node-content links respectively, following the notation in Eq.1."

So we splited ∀eu = (einu , eoutu ) where einu ∈ Rd/2 and eoutu ∈ Rd/2. Then p(v, u) can be computed as:\np(v, u) = σ(einv · eoutu ) = 1\n1 + exp(−einv · eoutu ) (4)"

In this paper, we further decompose each document into sentences, and model node-sentence link separately (Figure 2). We investigate three typical composition models for learning sentence representations (Figure 3).\nWord Embedding Average (WAvg). This approach simply takes the average of word vectors as the sentence embedding. Despite its obliviousness to word order, it has proved surprisingly effective in text categorization tasks (Joulin et al. 2016).\nfe(c) = 1 |c| ∑ i ewi (7)\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN). Here we use the gated recurrent unit (GRU) proposed by Cho et al. (2014). GRU is a simplified version of the LSTM unit proposed earlier (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997), with fewer parameters while still preserving the ability of capturing long-term dependencies. Instead of simply using the hidden representation at the final state as the sentence representation, we apply mean pooling over all history hidden states:\n−→ hi = GRU(ewi , hi−1); fe(c) = 1 |c| ∑ i −→ hi (8)\nBidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN). In practice, even with GRU, RNN still cannot capture very\nlong-term dependencies well. Hence, we further adopt a bidirectional variant (Schuster and Paliwal 1997) that processes a sentence in both directions with two separate hidden layers. The hidden state vectors from two directions’ GRU units at each position are then concatenated, and finally passed through a mean pooling layer. ←− hi = GRU(ewi , hi+1); fe(c) = 1\n|c| ∑ i ( −→ hi ⊕ ←− hi) (9)"

The proposed CENE consistently and significantly outperforms both structure-based and contentbased methods on all different datasets and most training rations, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.\nBesides, we have the following interesting observations:\n1. For most tasks, simple concatenation of structure-based methods and content-based methods yeilds improvements, showing the importance of both network structure and contents.\n2. Despite the simplicity, CENEWAvg obtains promising results in general, outperforming most of the baseline methods by a significant margin. Furthermore, CENERNN and CENEBiRNN perform better than WAvg in most cases.\n3. BiRNN works better than RNN in DBLP, while RNN is better in Zhihu. The main factor here is the average sentence length in DBLP (25) and Zhihu (11). As discussed earlier (the Introduction part), BiRNN is more powerful for longer sentences.\n4. Content-based methods work generally better than structure-based methods on Zhihu, but worse on DBLP. This observation implies that structural relationships are more indicative than contents in DBLP, that is, papers tend to cite papers within the same area. Zhihu, however, is an interest-driven network, and thus contents are more important for node representation.\n5. TADW performs poorly on Zhihu. This is mainly because TADW is originally designed for networks where each node has only one document. However, nodes on Zhihu networks may follow multiple questions and the contents are relatively independent.\nWe further conduct experiments on another DBLP 7 dataset used in TriDNR (Pan et al. 2016) to directly compare with it. We examine both the original semi-supervised version of TriDNR and an unsupervised version, in which the label-node relationship is discarded. Table 6 shows that CENERNN and CENEBiRNN even outperform the semisupervised TriDNR, which is really promising.\nConventional structure-based methods perform poorly on small-degree nodes (e.g., a Zhihu user may neither follow nor be followed). However, the introduction of content nodes would greatly alleviate the structural sparsity. Figure 4a shows the classification performance of CENE over\n7github.com/shiruipan/TriDNR\nnodes with different degrees on Zhihu-Gender, compared with DeepWalk. Figure 4b shows the curve of the absolute differences. We can see CENE has a significantly larger impact on small-degree nodes, which verifies our hypothesis."

For all tasks, all of the three curves converge stably when k approximates 100.\nFigure 6 shows the effect of α. Note that if α = 0, only content information will be used, and when α = 1, our model will be degenerated into a structure-based one (W2V). With α increasing, the performance of CENE in-\ncreases at first but decreases when α is big enough. There is an abrupt decrease when α grows from 0.9 to 1.0, indicating the importance of content information. Another notable phenomenon is that for the location attribute on Zhihu, performance keeps dropping as α increases.

    "abstractText" : "This paper investigates the problem of network embedding, which aims at learning low-dimensional vector representation of nodes in networks. Most existing network embedding methods rely solely on the network structure, i.e., the linkage relationships between nodes, but ignore the rich content information associated with it, which is common in real world networks and beneficial to describing the characteristics of a node. In this paper, we propose content-enhanced network embedding (CENE), which is capable of jointly leveraging the network structure and the content information. Our approach integrates text modeling and structure modeling in a general framework by treating the content information as a special kind of node. Experiments on several real world networks with application to node classification show that our models outperform all existing network embedding methods, demonstrating the merits of content information and joint learning. Introduction Network embedding, which aims at learning lowdimensional vector representations of a network, has attracted increasing interest in recent years. It has been shown highly effective in many important tasks in network analysis involving predictions over nodes and edges, such as node classification (Tsoumakas and Katakis 2006; Sen et al. 2008), recommendation (Tu, Liu, and Sun 2014; Yu et al. 2014) and link prediction (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg 2007). Various approaches have been proposed toward this goal, typically including Deepwalk (Perozzi, Al-Rfou, and Skiena 2014), LINE (Tang et al. 2015), GraRep (Cao, Lu, and Xu 2015), and node2vec (Grover and Leskovec 2016). These models have been proven effective in several real world networks. Most of the previous approaches utilize information only from the network structure, i.e., the linkage relationships between nodes, while paying scant attention to the content of each node, which is common in real-world networks. In a typical social network with users as vertices, the user-generated contents (e.g., texts, images) will serve as rich extra information which should be important for node representation and beneficial to downstream applications. Figure 1 shows an example network from Quora, a community question answering website. Users in Quora can follow each other, creating directed connections in the network. How does the shape",
