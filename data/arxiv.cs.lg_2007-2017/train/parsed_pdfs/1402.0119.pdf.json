      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Principal Component Analysis (Pearson, 1901) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (Hotelling, 1936) are two of the most popular multivariate analysis methods. They have played a crucial role in a vast array of applications since their conception a century ago.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) rotates a collection of correlated variables into their uncorrelated principal components (also known as factors or latent variables). Principal components owe their name to the following key property:\nthe first principal component captures the maximum amount of variance in the data; successive components account for the maximum amount of remaining variance in dimensions orthogonal to the preceding ones. PCA is commonly used for dimensionality reduction, assuming that core properties of a high-dimensional sample are largely captured by a small number of principal components.\nCanonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) computes linear projections of a pair of random variables such that their projections are maximally correlated. Analogous to principal components, the projections of the pair of random variables are mutually orthogonal and ordered by their amount of explained cross-correlation. CCA is widely used to learn from multiple modalities of data (Kakade & Foster, 2007), an ability particularly useful when some of the modalities are only available at training time, but keeping information about them at testing time is beneficial (Chaudhuri et al., 2009; Vapnik & Vashist, 2009).\nThe applications of PCA and CCA are ubiquitous. Some examples are feature extraction, time-series prediction, finance, medicine, meteorology, chemometrics, biology, neurology, natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision or multimodal signal processing (Jolliffe, 2002).\nDespite their success, an impediment of PCA and CCA to modern data analysis is that both reveal only linear relationships between the variables under study. To overcome this limitation, for both PCA and CCA several nonlinear extensions have been proposed. For PCA, these include Kernel Principal Component Analysis or KPCA (Schölkopf et al., 1999) and Autoencoder Neural Networks (Baldi & Hornik, 1989; Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006). For CCA, common extensions are Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis or KCCA (Lai & Fyfe, 2000; Melzer et al., 2001; Bach & Jordan, 2002) and Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (Andrew et al., 2013). However, these solutions tend to have\nar X\niv :1\n40 2.\n01 19\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 1\nF eb\nrather high computational complexity (often cubic in the sample size), are difficult to parallelize, and are not always accompanied by theoretical guarantees.\nIn a separate strand of recent research, randomized strategies have been introduced for constructing features that can help reveal nonlinear patterns in data when used in conjunction with linear algorithms (Rahimi & Recht, 2008; Le et al., 2013). For basic tasks such as regression or classification, using nonlinear random features incurs little or no loss in performance compared with exact kernel methods, while achieving dramatic savings in computational complexity (from cubic to linear in the sample size). Furthermore, random features are amenable to simple implementation and clean theoretical analysis.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to lay the foundations for nonlinear, randomized variants of PCA and CCA. Therefore, we dedicate key attention to studying the spectral properties of low-rank kernel matrices constructed as sums of random feature dot-products. Our analysis is powered by the recently developed matrix Bernstein inequality (Mackey et al., 2012). With little additional effort, our analysis extends to other popular multivariate analysis tools such as linear discriminant analysis, spectral clustering, or the randomized dependence coefficient.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed randomized methods by experimenting with several real-world data and comparing against the state-of-the-art on CCA: Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (Andrew et al., 2013). As a novel application of the presented methods, we derive an algorithm to learn using privileged information (Vapnik & Vashist, 2009). Additional numerical simulations are provided to visualize the concentration bounds derived in our theoretical analysis. Lastly, we provide an implementation of the presented algorithms in just 15 lines of R code."

On the other hand, (Avron et al., 2013) made use of randomized Walsh-Hadamard transforms to adapt linear CCA to large-scale datasets. The use of nonlinear random features is more scarce and has only appeared\ntwice in previous literature. First, McWilliams et al.

      "heading" : "2. Random Nonlinear Features",
      "text" : "Before presenting our new methods, let us first recall a few key aspects of nonlinear random features.\nConsider the class of functions Fp := { f(x) = ∫ Rd α(w)φ(xTw)dw : |α(w)| ≤ Cp(w) } , (1) over which we wish to learn. Here, α : Rd → R is a nonlinear map of “weights”, while φ : R→ R is a nonlinear map that satisfies |φ(z)| ≤ 1; x,w are vectors in Rd, p(w) is a probability density of the parameter vectors w and C is a regularizing constant. More simply, we may consider the finite version of f :\nfm(x) := ∑m\ni=1 αiφ(w\nT i x). (2)\nKernel machines, Gaussian processes, AdaBoost, and neural networks are models that fit within this function class.\nLet D = {(xi, yi)}ni=1 ⊂ Rd × R be a finite sample of input-output pairs drawn from a distribution Q(X,Y ). We seek to approximate a function f in class Fp by minimizing the empirical risk (over dataset D)\nRemp(f) := 1\nm ∑m i=1 c(fm(xi), yi), (3)\nfor a suitable loss function c(ŷ, y) that penalizes departure of fm(x) from the true label y; for us, the least-squares loss c(ŷ, y) = (ŷ − y)2 will be most convenient. Jointly optimizing (3) over (α,w1, . . . ,wm) used in defining fm, is a daunting task given the nonlinear nature of φ. The key insight of Rahimi & Recht (2008) is that we can instead randomly sample the parameters wi ∈ Rd from a data-independent distribution p(w) and construct an mdimensional randomized feature map z(X) for the input dataX ∈ Rn×d that obeys the following structure:\nw1, . . . ,wm ∼ p(w), zi := [cos(w T i x1), . . . , cos(w T i xn)] ∈ Rn,\nz(X) := [z1 · · · zm] ∈ Rn×m. (4)\nUsing the (precomputed) nonlinear random features z(X) ultimately transforms the nonconvex optimization of (3) into a least-squares problem of the form\nminα∈Rd ‖y − z(X)α‖22 , s.t. ‖α‖∞ ≤ C. (5)\nThis form remarkably simplifies computation (in practice, we actually solve a regularized version of it), while incurring only a bounded error. Theorem 1 formalizes this claim. Theorem 1. (Rahimi & Recht, 2008) Let Fp be defined as in (1). Draw D ∼ Q(X, Y ). Construct z(·) as in (4). Let c : R2 → R+ be a loss-function L-Lipschitz in its first argument. Then, for any δ > 0, with probability at least 1− 2δ there exist some α = (α1, . . . , αm) such that\nEQ [c (z(x)α, y)]−\nmin f∈Fp\nEQ[c(f(x), y)] ≤ O ((\nLC√ n + LC√ m )√ log 1δ ) .\nSolving (5) takes O(ndm+m2n) operations, while testing t points on the fitted model takes O(tdm) operations. Recent techniques that use subsampled Hadamard randomized transforms (Le et al., 2013) allow computation of the random features even faster, yieldingO(n log(d)m+m2n) operations to solve (5) and O(t log(d)m) to test t new points.\nIt is of special interest that randomized algorithms are in many cases more robust than their deterministic analogues (Mahoney, 2011). However, the nature and quantification of the implicit regularization induced by randomness remains an open question."

      "heading" : "3.1. Randomized Nonlinear PCA (RPCA)",
      "text" : "We propose RPCA, a nonlinear randomized variant of PCA. We may view RPCA as a low-rank approximation of KPCA when the latter is equipped with a shift-invariant kernel. RPCA may be thus understood as (linear) PCA on a nonlinear mapping of the data. Schematically,\n{F , z(·)} =: RPCA(X) ≡ PCA(z(X)) ≈ KPCA(X),\nwhere F ∈ Rm×m are the principal component loading vectors and z : Rn×d → Rn×m is a random feature map generated as in (4) (typically, m n). The computational complexity is O(d2n) for PCA and O(m2n) for RPCA; both are linear in the sample size n, and when m d, the latter is much cheaper. When using nonlinear features as in (4), PCA loadings are no longer linear transformations but approximations of nonlinear functions belonging to the function class Fp described in Section 2. As a consequence of Bochner’s theorem (Section 2.1), RPCA converges to KPCA as the number of random features m tends to infinity. This is because random feature dot-products converge uniformly to the exact kernel evaluations in expectation (Rahimi & Recht, 2008). Since the solution of KPCA is the eigensystem of the kernel matrixK\nfor the data matrixX ∈ Rn×d, one may study how fast the approximation K̂ made in (6) converges in operator norm toK as m grows.\nTo analyze this convergence we appeal to the recently proposed Matrix Bernstein Inequality. In the theorem below and henceforth ‖X‖ denotes the operator norm. Theorem 2 (Matrix Bernstein, (Mackey et al., 2012)). Let Z1, . . .Zm be independent d×d random matrices. Assume that E[Zi] = 0 and that ‖Zi‖ ≤ R. Define the variance parameter σ2 := max {∥∥∑ i E[ZTi Zi]\n∥∥ ,∥∥∑i E[ZiZTi ]∥∥}. Then, for all t ≥ 0,\nP (∥∥∥∑\ni Zi ∥∥∥ ≥ t) ≤ 2d · exp{ −t2 3σ2 + 2Rt } .\nFurthermore, E ∥∥∥∑\ni Zi ∥∥∥ ≤ σ√3 log(2d) +R log(2d). The convergence rate of RPCA to its exact kernel counterpart KPCA is expressed by the following theorem, which actually invokes the Hermitian matrix version of Theorem 3.1, and hence depends on d instead of 2d, and uses matrix squares when defining the variance σ2.\nTheorem 3. Assume access to the data X ∈ Rn×d and a shift-invariant, even kernel k. Construct the kernel matrix Kij := k(xi,xj) and its approximation K̂ using m random features as per (6). Then,\nE‖K̂ −K‖ ≤ √ 3n2 log n\nm +\n2n log n\nm . (7)\nProof. We follow a derivation similar to (Tropp, 2012).\nDenote by\nK̂ := 1m ∑m i=1 ziz T i = ∑m i=1 K̂(i)\nthe n × n sample kernel matrix, and by K its population counterpart such that E[K̂] =K. Note that K̂ is the sum of them independent matrices K̂(i), since our random features are sampled i.i.d. and the matrixX is defined to be constant. Consider the individual error matrices\nE = K̂ −K = ∑m\ni=1 Ei, Ei =\n1 m (K̂(i) −K),\neach of which satisfies E[Ei] = 0. Since we are using cosine features—see z(x) in (4)—it follows that there exists a constant B such that ‖z‖2 ≤ B. Thus, we see that\n‖Ei‖ = 1\nm ‖zizTi −E[zzT ]‖ ≤\n1 m (‖zi‖2+E[‖z‖2]) ≤ 2B m ,\nbecause of the triangle inequality on the norm and Jensen’s inequality on the expected value. To bound the variance\nof E, bound first the variance of each of its sumands Ei (noting that E[zizTi ] =K):\nE[E2i ] = 1 m2 E [ (ziz T i −K)2 ] = 1\nm2 E [ ‖zi‖2zizTi − zizTi K −KzizTi +K2 ] 1 m2 [ BK − 2K2 +K2 ] BK m2 .\nNext, taking all summands Ei together we obtain\n‖E[E2]‖ ≤ ∥∥∥∑m\ni=1 EE2i ∥∥∥ ≤ 1 m B‖K‖.\nWhere the first inequality follows by Jensen. We can now invoke the matrix Bernstein inequality (Theorem 3.1) on E − E[E] to obtain the bound\nE‖K̂ −K‖ ≤ √\n3B‖K‖ log n m + 2B log n m .\nObserve that random features and kernel evaluations are upper-bounded by 1; thus both B and ‖K‖ are upperbounded by n, yielding the bound (7).\nTo obtain a characterization in relative-error, we can divide both sides of (7) by ‖K‖. This results in a bound that depends on n logarithmically (since ‖K‖ = O(n)). Moreover, additional information may be extracted from the tail-probability version of Theorem . Please refer to Section 5.1 for additional discussion on this aspect.\nBefore closing this section, we mention a byproduct of our above analysis.\nExtension to Spectral Clustering. Spectral clustering (Luxburg, 2007) uses the spectrum of K to perform dimensionality reduction before applying k-means. Therefore, the analysis of RPCA can be easily extended to obtain a randomized and nonlinear variant of spectral clustering."

As will be shown, RCCA is a low-rank approximation of KCCA when the latter is equipped with a pair of shift-invariant kernels.

When performing RCCA, the basis vectors f1, . . . ,fr ∈ Rp and g1, . . . , gr ∈ Rq become the basis functions f1, . . . ,fr : Rp → R and g1, . . . , gr : Rq → R, which approximate functions in the class Fp defined in Section 2.

Hence, their expectations factorize:\nE [Ei] = 1my ( E[Â]Ky −AKy ) ,\nwhere we used E[K̂(i)y ] = Ky.

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) seeks a linear combination of the features of the data X ∈ Rn×d such that the samples become maximally separable with respect to a paired labeling y with yi ∈ {1, . . . , c}. LDA can be solved by CCA(X,T ), where Tij = I{yi = j} (Bie et al., 2005). Therefore, a similar analysis to the one of RCCA could be used to obtained a randomized nonlinear variant of LDA.\nExtension to RDC. The Randomized Dependence Coefficient or RDC (Lopez-Paz et al., 2013) is defined as the largest canonical correlation of RCCA when performed on the copula transformation of the data matrices ofX and Y .

Figures 2 and 3 show the sum of the largest canonical correlations obtained on the test set by each CCA variant, plotted against the number of random projections m (set equally for both X and Y ) used by RCCA. Running RCCA with 2000 random projections takes two minutes on a 1.8GHz single core laptop computer when using the R code provided in Appendix A. Running a twolayered DCCA on MNIST takes on the order of 10 hours with Intel-MKL C code. The number of weights required to be stored for test time for RCCA is a hundred times lower than for DCCA for MNIST. In terms of explained correlation in the test set, RCCA performs best.\nParameter Selection. Note that no parameters were tuned for RCCA, since the random projection widths are heuristically set, and regularization was automatically provided by the use of randomness. The number of random features m can be set to the maximum value that fits within the available computational budget. On the other hand, CCA has two parameters (regularizer for each view) and DCCA has ten (two autoencoder parameters for pretraining, number of hidden layers, number of hidden units and regularizers\nfor each view). These were tuned via cross-validation using the grids described in Galen et al. (2013).\nIf desired, further speed improvements for RCCA could be achieved by distributing the computation of covariance matrices over several computers, and by making use of truncated SVD (Baglama & Reichel, 2006)."

      "heading" : "5.3. Learning Using Privileged Information",
      "text" : "In Vapnik’s paradigm Learning Using Privileged Information or LUPI (Vapnik & Vashist, 2009) the learner has access to a set of additional featuresX? during training time. These features are understood as helpful high-level “teacher explanations” about each of the training samples. The challenge is to build algorithms that are able extract information from this privileged information at training time to build a better classifier for test time. We propose to use RCCA to construct a highly dependent subspace between the regular featuresX and the privileged featuresX?\nWe experiment with the Animals with Attributes dataset. In this dataset, the regular set of features X is a set of 30000 pictures of 35 different animals. The set of privileged featuresX? is a set of 85 high-level binary attributes associated with each picture (such as eats-fish or can-fly). To extract information from X? at training time, we build a feature space formed by the concatenation of the 85, fivedimensional canonical variables zx(X)F (i) 1:5 associated with each RCCA(X, [X(i)? , y]), i ∈ {1, . . . 85}. The vector y denotes the training labels.\nWe perform 15 random training/test partitions of 1000 samples each. Each partition groups a random subset of 10 animals as class “0” and a second random subset of 10 animals as class “1”. Hence, each partition is a different, challenging binary classification problem. Figure 4 shows the test classification accuracy of a linear SVM when using as features the images’ SURF features or the RCCA “semi-privileged” features. As a side note, using directly the high-level attributes yielded 100% accuracy. The cost\nparameter of the linear SVM is cross-validated on the grid [10−4, . . . , 104]. We observe an average improvement of 14% in classification when using the RCCA basis instead of the image features alone. Results are statistically significant respect to a paired Wilcoxon test on a 95% confidence interval."

      "text" : "We presented a theoretical and empirical treatment of randomized, nonlinear variants of the classical multivariate analysis methods of Principal Component Analysis and Canonical Correlation Analysis. The use of nonlinear random features significantly reduces the computational complexity of these algorithms, whilst retaining their strong predictive performance. The proposed algorithms do not present any parameters to be tuned, except for the number of random features to be used; however, this can be understood as a convenient knob to straightforwardly trade-off between speed and accuracy.\nSeveral questions of interest for further investigation remain open. For example: (i) how can we leverage knowledge from specific datasets to better design the random feature sampling distribution p(w)? (ii) how can we incorporate sparsity assumptions on the random features? (iii) can we form a hierarchy of layers of random features to build deep, more powerful component analysis methods?"

However, these techniques only reveal linear relationships in data. Although nonlinear variants of PCA and CCA have been proposed, they are computationally prohibitive in the large scale. In a separate strand of recent research, randomized methods have been proposed to construct features that help reveal nonlinear patterns in data. For basic tasks such as regression or classification, random features exhibit little or no loss in performance, while achieving dramatic savings in computational requirements. In this paper we leverage randomness to design scalable new variants of nonlinear PCA and CCA; our ideas also extend to key multivariate analysis tools such as spectral clustering or LDA. We demonstrate our algorithms through experiments on real-world data, on which we compare against the state-of-the-art. Code in R implementing our methods is provided in the Appendix.",
