      "text" : "A large number of problems in engineering and science are unapproachable with conventional schemes instead they are handled with intelligent stochastic techniques such as evolutionary, neural network, reinforcement and swarm-based algorithms. However, essential parameter for the end users of aforementioned intelligent algorithms is to yield the solutions within desirable accuracy in timely manner – which remains volatile and uncertain. Many heuristic methods exist to speed up the convergence rate of stochastic algorithms to enhance their viability for complex real-world problems. Opposite Based Computing (OBC) is one such heuristic method\nintroduced by Tizhoosh in [1]. The underlying idea is simultaneous consideration of guess and opposite guess, estimate and opposite estimate, parameter and opposite parameter & so on in order to make more educated decisions within the stochastic processes, that eventually results in yielding solutions quickly and accurately.\nIn essence, learning the relationship between an entity and its opposite entity for a given problem is a special case of apriori knowledge, which can be beneficial for computationally intelligent algorithms in stochastic setups. In context of machine learning algorithm, one may ask, why should effort be spent on extraction of the opposite relations when inputoutput relationship itself is not well defined? However, various research on this topic has shown that simultaneous analysis of entities and their opposites can accelerate the task in focus – since it allows the algorithm to harness the knowledge about symmetry in the solution domain thus allowing a better exploration of the solutions. Opposition-based Differential Evolution (ODE), however, seems to be the most successful oppositional inspired algorithm so far [2].\nThere have been two types of opposites defined in literature 1) type-I and 2) type-II. Generally, most learning algorithms have an objective function; mapping the relationship between inputs and their outputs – which may be known or unknown. In such scenario, type-I based learning algorithms deal with the relationship among input parameters, based on their values, without considering their relationship with the objective landscape. On contrary, type-II opposite requires a prior knowledge of the objective function. Until 2015, all papers published on using OBL employed the simple notion of type-I opposites which are conveniently, but naively defined on the input space only, making a latent linearity assumption about the problem domain. Tizhoosh and Rahnamayan [3] introduced the idea of “opposition mining” and evolving rules to capture oppositeness in dynamic environments.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review on OBL. Section 3 introduces the idea to use artificial neural network (ANN) to learn the opposites, and provides an overview of type-I and type-II OBL. Finally, Section 5 provides experimental results and analysis and also a comparison of the proposed ANN approach with the evolving fuzzy inference systems, a method recently proposed in [3].\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n05 12\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n6 Se\np 20\n16"

      "heading" : "2. BACKGROUND REVIEW",
      "text" : "Roughly 10 years ago, the idea of opposition-based learning (OBL) was introduced as a generic framework to improve existing learning and optimization algorithms [1]. This approach has received a modest but growing attention by the research community resulting in improving diverse optimization and learning techniques published in several hundred papers [4]. A few algorithms have been reported to employ “oppositeness” in their processing, including reinforcement learning [5, 6, 7, 8], evolutionary algorithms [9, 10, 11, 12], swarm-based methods [13, 14, 15], and neural networks [16, 17, 18].\nThe majority of learning algorithms are tailored toward approximating functions by arbitrary setting weights, activation functions, and the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The convergence would be significantly faster towards the optimal solution if these random initializations are close to the result [18]. On the contrary, if the initial estimates are far from the optimal solution – in the opposite corner of the search space, for instance, then convergence to the ideal solution will take considerably more time or can be left intractable [19]. Hence, there is a need to look simultaneously for a candidate solution in both current and opposite directions to increase the convergence speed – a learning mechanism denoted as “opposition-based learning” [1]. The concept of OBL has touched upon the various existing algorithm, and it has proven to yield better results compared to the conventional method of determining the optimal solution. A detailed survey on applications of OBL in soft-computing is discussed by AlQuanaieer et al. in [4]. The paper discusses the integration of OBL when used for reinforcement learning, neural networks, optimization, fuzzy set theory and fuzzy c-mean clustering. A review on each algorithm states that applying OBL can be beneficial when applied in an effective manner when applications use optimization algorithm, learning algorithm, fuzzy sets and image processing.\nMany problems in optimization involve minimization or maximization of some scalar parameterized objective function, with respect to all its parameters. For such problems, OBL can be used as a heuristic technique to quickly converge to the solution within the search space by generating the candidates solutions that have “opposite-correlation” instead of being entirely random.\nThe concept of “opposite-correlation” can be discussed from type-I and type-II perspectives when an unknown function y = f(x1, x2, . . . , xn) needs to be learned or optimized by relying on some sample data alone.\nDefinition 1 Type-I opposite x̆I of input x is defined as x̆I = xmax +xmin−x where xmax is the maximum and xmin is the minimum value of x.\nComputation of type-I opposites are easier due to its linear definition in the variable space. On the contrary, type-II\nopposition scheme requires to operate on the output space.\nDefinition 2 Type-II opposite x̆II of input x is defined as x̆II = {xi|y̆(xi) = ymin + ymax − y(xi)} where ymax is the maximum value, and ymin is the minimum value of y.\nType-II opposites may be difficult to incorporate in realworld problems because 1) their calculation may require apriori domain knowledge, and 2) the inverse of the function y, namely y̆, is not available when we are dealing with unknown functions y = f(x1, x2, . . . , xn). The focus of this paper is to develop a general framework to allow ANNs to learn the relationship among the inputs and their corresponding type-II opposites. Validation of the proposed approach is comprised of several benchmark functions. Validation results on the benchmark functions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as an initial step for future developments in type-II OBL approximations using neural networks."

      "heading" : "3. THE IDEA",
      "text" : "Type-II (or true) opposite of x, denoted with x̆II , is more intuitive when compared to type-I opposite in context of “non-linear” functions. When looking at function y = f(x1, x2, ..., xn) in a typical machine-learning setup, one may receive the output values y for some input variables x1, x2, . . . , xn. However, the function y = f(·) itself is usually unknown otherwise there would be little justification for resorting to machine-learning tools. Instead, one has some sort of evaluation function g(·) (error, reward, fitness, etc.) that enables to assess the quality of any guess x̂1, x̂2, . . . , x̂n delivering an estimate ŷ of the true/desired output y.\nTizhoosh and Rahnamayan introduced the idea of opposition mining as an approach to approximate type-II opposites for training the learning algorithms using fuzzy inference systems (FIS) with evolving rules in [3]. Evolving FIS has received much attention lately [20, 21] which is now being used for modeling nonlinear dynamic systems [22] and image classification and segmentation [23, 24, 25]. However, learning opposites with evolving rules are observed to be sensitive to the parameters used and encounters difficulty in generalizing a large variety of data. The proposed method in this paper uses opposition mining for training artificial neural network to approximate the relationship between the input x and its type-II opposite x̆II . This methodology can, of course, be extended for various applications; hence, if a large training dataset is available, then one can apply them at once instead of incremental changes. A graphical representation of the typeII opposites, described in Definition 2, is shown in Fig. 1: 1) Given variable x, 2) The corresponding f(x) is calculated, 3) from which the opposite of f(x), namely of(x) is determined, and 4) the opposite(s) of x are found to be: ox1, ox2 and ox3. However, there are various challenges using this approach, which include: 1) the output range of y = f(·) may not be a-priori known, thereby an updated knowledge on the\noutput range of [ymin, ymax] is needed, 2) the precise output of the type-II opposite may not be present in the given data; thereby, a method to determine gaps in the dataset is needed to estimate the relationship between the input and the output, and 3) it is difficult to generalize over a high dimension/range of data. In this paper, we put forward a concise algorithm to learn opposites via neural networks – which, as outlined in Section 5, is proven to yield better results when compared to recently introduced FIS approach."

      "text" : "Neural networks with sufficient number of hidden layers can learn any bounded degree polynomials with good accuracy [26]. Therefore, ANNs make a good candidate for learning the nonlinear relationship between the inputs x and their typeII opposites x̆II .\nIn order to learn type-II opposites, we first need to sample the (quasi-)opposites from the given input-output data. The first stage of our algorithm is opposition mining, which provides the data that can be subsequently used by ANN for performing a nonlinear regression. One generally assumes that the more data is available the better the approximation becomes for x̆II = f(x) as we have more (quasi-)opposites for training the ANN. We assume that the range of input variable is known, xi ∈ [ximin, ximax] but the range of output, yj ∈ [yjmin, yjmax], may be apriori unknown. Since we are approximating type-II opposites, we need to generate the (quasi-)opposite data from given training data. Our approach consists of two distinct stages: Opposition Mining – The training data is sampled to establish the output boundaries. Depending on a specific oppositeness scheme, all data points in training data are processed to find (quasi-)opposites of each input. At the end of the opposite mining, we have a corresponding (quasi-)opposite (approximate of type-II opposite) for every input point in training data as outlined in Algorithm 1. There are different schemes for calculating the opposition. Given a sample of random variable x ∈ [xmin, xmax] with mean x̄, the opposite of x\nAlgorithm 1 Opposition Mining Input: x inputs, y outputs & Ti opposition scheme Output: type-II opposites x̆II in same order as input x\n1: procedure OPPOSITION MINING(x, y, Ti) 2: ymax ← max(y) 3: ymin ← min(y) 4: ȳ ← mean(y) 5: for i ∈ [1, length(y)] do 6: yI ← y(i) .

Therefore, for the experiments purposes, we solved the boundary violation problem by switching the scheme to T1 whenever necessary (Algorithm 1, Line 14). It is important to note that, opposites calculated with any of the above schemes in output space when projected back on to the variable space are known as type-II (true) opposites.\nLearning the Opposites – ANN is employed to approximate the function x̆II = f(x) that maps input and its type-II opposite. The network is trained on the data collected from the opposition mining step, and can be retrained progressively as more data comes in or it can be used to predict the typeII opposites for a given input x. In the following sections, we report the results of some experiments to verify the accuracy of our algorithm, its superiority over existing FIS based technique and some discussion on the usefulness of type-II opposites for machine-learning algorithms."

      "text" : "We have performed two experiment series to test the various aspects of our algorithm including – opposition mining, learning type-II using ANN and prediction accuracy of the trained ANN model versus evolving fuzzy rules model. The experiments deal with the approximation accuracy of type-II opposites and application of type-II opposites for some standard optimization scenarios respectively. For comparing the approximation accuracy, we used the 8 benchmark functions for generating the data required for the opposition-mining and subsequent training of ANN and evolving fuzzy rules models; which are taken from [3]. It is important to note that, benchmarks function have been intentionally kept simple and mostly monotonic in defined ranges, in order avoid the surjective relationship of inputs and their (quasi-)opposites during the opposition mining stage, thus allowing to extract the most feasible patterns in the data to be used with learning algorithms. However, in order to learn the type-II opposites across any general non-monotonic functions, it would be required to decompose the function in question into monotonic piece-wise ranges and subsequently perform the type-II approximation procedure on each of the piece separately. We calculated the approximation error of our algorithm for every benchmark function against different oppositeness schemes. We compared the results against the recently published ones by approximating type-II using evolving fuzzy rules [3]."

      "text" : "The results for 8 benchmark functions (used in [3]) are summarized in Table 1. Green cells represent the performance of ANN is statistically significant with 95% confidence (unless otherwise stated), whereas red cells show the significance of evolving fuzzy rules based approach for the respective opposition scheme. Cells marked gray represent the best results achieved using any deployed method or opposition scheme for a given benchmark function. The error in approximation of the type-II opposite x̆∗II is inferred by comparing the value of the function at approximated opposite xII and true opposite value of the function y̆∗II at given input x. It is important to note that y̆∗II can be calculated if input x, opposition scheme Ti and function f are known:\nerror(x̆II) ∝ error(y̆II) = | ˘yII∗ − f(x̆II)| (4)\nThe results are reported in Table 1. Overall T1 seems to be the best oppositeness scheme. As long as ymax, ymin does not change for the given sample data, T1 and T2 schemes allow continuous training of ANN. The approximation seems to perform better overall except for the linear functions and functions with square root power. The ANN approach seems to generalize much better for the logarithm function at higher values of x where output changes much slower than change in x."

      "text" : "In this experiment, we test three standard optimization functions which are commonly used in literature of global optimization – Ackely, Bulkin and Booth functions [3].\nAckley Function – The Ackley function is given by\nf(x1, x2) = 20\n( 1− exp ( −0.2 √ 0.5(x21 + x 2 2) )) −\nexp ( 0.5 ∗ (cos(2πx1) + cos(2πx2)) ) + exp(1)\nThe global minimum is 0 at (3, 0.5) with x1, x2 ∈ [−35, 35].

This experiment enables to verify three majors points: 1.) test whether the fundamental statement of OBL holds, namely that – simultaneous consideration of a guess and opposite guess provides faster convergence to the solution in learning and optimization processes, 2.) test whether type-II opposites provides any advantage over type-I, and 3.) test if ANN based type-II approximation provides any superiority over recently introduced evolving fuzzy rule approach.\nTo conduct this experiment, we generate two random input samples xr1 and x r 2 and we calculate the error (distance from the global minimum). Then, we approximate the opposites x̆r1 and x̆ r 2 and calculate the error again. In order to find the solution, we chose the strategy that yields less error and continues the process. We should expect to have a reduction or no change in error at every iteration since we deliberately choose the outcome with the least error. We carry out the experiment for both type-I x̆rI and type-II opposites x̆rII generated by each of the candidate methods. By recording the average error after 0.1∗ns iterations for multiple runs of the experiments, we can test whether considering type-II opposite from either of the candidate methods have any statistical significance over type-I in yielding outcome closer to the global minimum. However, the focus is more on comparing the two candidate approaches for approximating type-II (proposed and evolving fuzzy rule-based), to see which one provides better estimates of type-II to bring the optimization process closer to the global optima. The results for Ackley, Booth, and Bulkin functions are shown in Table 2. The\nfirst column consists of random guesses, the second column contains type-II opposite guesses estimated by ANN, and the third column contains type-II opposite guesses using the FIS approach; the last column is type-I opposites. By performing the t-test, results of type-II opposites obtained by ANN are statistically significant compared to the FIS approach. TypeII is performing better except for the Booth function."

      "heading" : "6. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "Ten years since the introduction of opposition-based learning, the full potential of type-II opposites is still largely unknown. In this paper, we put forward a method for learning type-II opposites with ANNs. The core idea in this paper is to utilize the (quasi-)opposite data collected from opposition-mining to learn the relationship between input x and its type-II opposite x̆II using neural networks. We tested the proposed algorithms with various benchmark functions and compared it against the existing fuzzy rules-based approach. We showed the correctness of fundamental statement of OBL scheme by utilizing type-II opposites on three of the famous global optimization problems. One of the major hurdles for existing type-II approximation methods (including proposed in\nthis paper) is when the function in question is highly nonmonotonic or periodic in nature. In those circumstances, the relationship between x and x̆II becomes surjective, causing discontinuities in opposition mining. This makes it difficult for any learning algorithm difficult to fit such discontinuous data. There is a potential for improvement in future works where non-monotonic functions can be decomposed into monotonic piece-wise intervals; each of the intervals can then be trained separately."

Two types of the “opposites” have been defined in the literature, namely type-I and type-II. The former are linear in nature and applicable to the variable space, hence easy to calculate. On the other hand, type-II opposites capture the “oppositeness” in the output space. In fact, type-I opposites are considered a special case of type-II opposites where inputs and outputs have a linear relationship. However, in many real-world problems, inputs and outputs do in fact exhibit a nonlinear relationship. Therefore, type-II opposites are expected to be better in capturing the sense of “opposition” in terms of the input-output relation. In the absence of any knowledge about the problem at hand, there seems to be no intuitive way to calculate the type-II opposites. In this paper, we introduce an approach to learn type-II opposites from the given inputs and their outputs using the artificial neural networks (ANNs). We first perform opposition mining on the sample data, and then use the mined data to learn the relationship between input x and its opposite x̆. We have validated our algorithm using various benchmark functions to compare it against an evolving fuzzy inference approach that has been recently introduced. The results show the better performance of a neural approach to learn the opposites. This will create new possibilities for integrating oppositional schemes within existing algorithms promising a potential increase in convergence speed and/or accuracy.",
