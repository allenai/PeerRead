In this paper we present methods for computing the proba­ bilities of such queries using the formulation proposed in [Balke and Pearl, 1994], where the antecedent of the query is interpreted as an external action that forces the proposi­ tion A to be true. When a prior probability is available on the causal mechanisms gov­ erning the domain, counterfactual probabil­ ities can be evaluated precisely. However, when causal knowledge is specified as condi­ tional probabilities on the observables, only bounds can computed. This paper develops techniques for evaluating these bounds, and demonstrates their use in two applications: (1) the determination of treatment efficacy from studies in which subjects may choose their own treatment, and (2) the determina­ tion of liability in product-safety litigation.",
