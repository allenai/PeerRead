First, if the mixture is ide n­ tifiable - and mixtures with pdfs from the same para­ metric family are identifiable in most cases - there is still an obvious problem of multimodality in equa­ tion (27) due to the possibility of label switching. This problem can be overcome with constraints to avoid la­ bel switching in the process of finding the minimizer for equation (24). Second, there is the concern about whether Laplace regularity holds in this case. Indeed it does hold in this case at least for a large class of pdfs that includes the exponential family as well as other important parametric families.

The approximation of marginal distribu­ tions usually requires numerical integration procedures - if accurate approximations for the integration con­ stant or probabilities of regions of the distribution are needed - as well as plotting procedures. Typical applications of Laplace's method to the ap­ proximation of moments involve the computation of two minimizers for the expressions in equations (8) and (9), one of them being usually the posterior mode. Fre­ quently the second minimizer is found with only a few steps of Newton's method (1 to 3 usually) when one of the minimizers is used as the starting point for the second optimization process. Similar procedure can be used in the case of marginals, considering in these case information from previous approximations. This means that the computational effort needed to implement Laplace's method is only marginally greater than that needed for the posterior mode analysis or method of maximum likelihood. One aspect that seems critical, however, is the availability of improved computational procedures to find numerical approxi­ mations to gradients and specially to Hessians if the analytical expressions are not available. This point was stressed by Naylor [1988] and also applies to other methods in some extension (when Newton's method is used for example).",
