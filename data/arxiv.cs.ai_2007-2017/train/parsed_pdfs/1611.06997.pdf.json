      "text" : "Automatic conversational models (Winograd 1971), also known as dialogue systems, are of great importance to a large variety of applications, ranging from open-domain entertaining chatbots to goal-oriented technical support agents. An increasing amount of research has recently been done to build purely data-driven dialogue systems that learn from large corpora of human-to-human conversations, without using hand-crafted rules or templates. While most work in this area formulates dialogue modeling in a sequence-tosequence framework (similar to machine translation) (Ritter, Cherry, and Dolan 2011; Shang, Lu, and Li 2015; Vinyals and Le 2015; Sordoni et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016a; Dušek and Jurčı́ček 2016), some more recent work (Serban et al. 2016; Luan, Ji, and Ostendorf 2016) instead trains a language model over the entire dialogue as one single sequence. In our work, we empirically demonstrate that a language model is better suited to dialogue modeling, as it learns how the conversation evolves as information progresses. Sequence-to-sequence models, on the other hand, learn only how the most recent dialogue response is generated. Such models are better suited to converting the same information from one modality to another, e.g., in machine translation and image captioning.\nWe improve the coherence of such neural dialogue language models by developing a generative dynamic attention mechanism that allows each generated word to choose which related words it wants to align to in the increasing conversation history (including the previous words in the response being generated). Neural attention (or alignment) has proven very successful for various sequence-to-sequence tasks by associating salient items in the source sequence with the generated item in the target sequence (Mnih et al. 2014; Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Xu et al. 2015; Mei, Bansal, and Walter 2016a; Parikh et al. 2016). However, such attention models are limited to a fixed scope of history, corresponding to the input source sequence. In contrast, we introduce a dynamic attention mechanism to a recurrent neural network (RNN) language model in which the scope of attention increases as the recurrence operation progresses from the start through the end of the conversation.\nThe dynamic attention model promotes coherence of the generated dialogue responses (continuations) by favoring the generation of words that have syntactic or semantic associations with salient words in the conversation history. Our simple model shows significant improvements over state-ofthe-art models and baselines on several metrics (including complementary diversity-based metrics, human evaluation, and qualitative visualizations) for two benchmark datasets, the open-domain MovieTriples and closed-domain Ubuntu Troubleshoot datasets. Our vanilla RNN model with dynamic attention outperforms more complex memory models (e.g., LSTM and GRU) by allowing for long-distance and flexible memory. We also present several visualizations to intuitively understand what the attention model is learning. Finally, we also explore a complementary LDA-based method to re-rank the outputs of the soft alignment-based coherence method, further improving performance on the evaluation benchmarks."

      "text" : "A great deal of attention has been paid to developing datadriven methods for natural language dialogue generation. Conventional statistical approaches tend to rely extensively on hand-crafted rules and templates, require interaction with humans or simulated users to optimize parameters, or produce conversation responses in an information retrieval fashion. Such properties prevent training on the large human\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n06 99\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n1 N\nov 2\n01 6\nconversational corpora that are becoming increasingly available, or fail to produce novel natural language responses.\nRitter, Cherry, and Dolan (2011) formulate dialogue response generation as a statistical phrase-based machine translation problem, which requires no explicit hand-crafted rules. The recent success of RNNs in statistical machine translation (Sutskever, Vinyals, and Lee 2014; Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) has inspired the application of such models to the field of dialogue modeling. Vinyals and Le (2015) and Shang, Lu, and Li (2015) employ an RNN to generate responses in human-to-human conversations by treating the conversation history as one single temporally ordered sequence. In such models, the distant relevant context in the history is difficult to recall. Some efforts have been made to overcome this limitation. Sordoni et al. (2015) separately encode the most recent message and all the previous context using a bag-of-words representation, which is decoded using an RNN. This approach equates the distance of each word in the generated output to all the words in the conversation history, but loses the temporal information of the history. Serban et al. (2016) design a hierarchical model that stacks an utterance-level RNN on a token-level RNN, where the utterance-level RNN reduces the number of computational steps between utterances. Wen et al. (2015) and Wen et al. (2016) improve spoken dialog systems via multi-domain and semantically conditioned neural networks on dialog act representations and explicit slot-value formulations.\nOur work explores the ability of recurrent neural network language models (Bengio et al. 2003; Mikolov 2010) to interpret and generate natural language conversations while\nstill maintaining a relatively simple architecture. We show that a language model approach outperforms the sequenceto-sequence model at dialogue modeling. Recently, Tran, Bisazza, and Monz (2016) demonstrated that the neural attention mechanism can improve the effectiveness of a neural language model. We propose an attention-based neural language model for dialogue modeling that learns how a conversation evolves as a whole, rather than only how the most recent response is generated, and that also reduces the number of computations between the current recurrence step and the distant relevant context in the conversation history.\nThe attention mechanism in our model has the additional benefit of favoring words that have semantic association with salient words in the conversation history, which promotes the coherence of the topics in the continued dialogue. This is important when conversation participants inherently want to maintain the topic of the discussion. Some past studies have equated coherence with propositional consistency (Goldberg 1983), while others see it as a summary impression (Sanders 1983). Our work falls in the category of viewing coherence as topic continuity (Crow 1983; Sigman 1983). Similar objectives, i.e., generating dialogue responses with certain properties, have been addressed recently, such as promoting response diversity (Li et al. 2016a), enhancing personal consistency (Li et al. 2016b), and improving specificity (Yao et al. 2016). Concurrent with this work, Luan, Ji, and Ostendorf (2016) improve topic consistency by feeding into the model the learned LDAbased topic representations. We show that the simple attention neural language model significantly outperforms such\na design. Furthermore, we suggest an LDA-based re-ranker complementary to soft neural attention that further promotes topic coherence."

We first discuss language models for dialogue, which is the primary focus of our work, then briefly introduce the sequence-to-sequence model, and lastly discuss the use of attention methods in both models.\nThe RNN-LM models a sentence as a sequence of tokens {w0, w1, . . . , wT } with a recurrence function\nht = f(ht−1, wt−1) (1)\nand an output (softmax) function\nP (wt = vj |w0:t−1) = exp g(ht, vj)∑ i exp g(ht, vi) , (2)\nwhere the recurrent hidden state ht ∈ Rd encodes all the tokens up to t− 1 and is used to compute the probability of generating vj ∈ V as the next token from the vocabulary V .\nThe functions f and g are typically defined as\nf(ht−1, wt−1) = tanh(Hht−1 + PEwt−1) (3a)\ng(ht, vj) = O > vjht, (3b)\nwhere H ∈ Rd×d is the recurrence matrix, Ewt−1 is a column of word embedding matrix E ∈ Rde×V that corresponds to wt−1, P ∈ Rd×de projects word embedding into the space of the same dimension d as the hidden units, and O ∈ Rd×V is the output word embedding matrix with column vector Ovj corresponding to vj .\nWe train the RNN-LM, i.e, estimate the parameters H , P , E and O, by maximizing the log-likelihood on a set of natural language training sentences of size N\n` = 1\nN N∑ n=1 Tn∑ t=0 logP (wt|w0:t−1) (4)\nSince the entire architecture is differentiable, the objective can be optimized by back-propagation.\nWhen dialogue is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task, the RNN-Seq2Seq model can be used in order to predict a target sequence wT0:L = {wT0 , wT1 , . . . , wTL} given an input source sequence wS0:M = {wS0 , wS1 , . . . , wSM}. In such settings, an encoder RNN represents the input as a sequence of hidden states hS0:M = {hS0 , hS1 , . . . , hSM}, and a separate decoder RNN then predicts the target sequence token-bytoken given the encoder hidden states hS0:M ."

We then describe its advantages compared to the use of attention in sequenceto-sequence models.\nAs with the RNN-LM, the model first encodes the input into a sequence of hidden states up to word t − 1 (Eqn. 1). Given a representation of tokens up to t − 1 {r0, r1, . . . , rt−1} (which we define shortly), the attention module computes the context vector zt at step t as a weighted average of r0:t−1\nβti = b > tanh(Wht−1 + Uri) (6a)\nαti = exp(βti)/ t−1∑ i=0 exp(βti) (6b)\nzt = t−1∑ i=0 αtiri (6c)\nWe then use the context vector zt together with the hidden state ht to predict the output at time t\ng(ht, zt, vj) = O > vj (Ohht +Ozzt) (7a)\nP (wt = vj |w0:t−1) = exp g(ht, zt, vj)∑ i exp g(ht, zt, vi) , (7b)\nwhere Oh ∈ Rd×d and Oz ∈ Rd×dz project ht and zt, respectively, into the same space of dimension d.\nThere are multiple benefits of using an attention-RNN language model for dialogue, which are empirically supported by our experimental results. First, a complete dialogue is usually composed of multiple turns. A language\nmodel over the entire dialogue is expected to better learn how a conversation evolves as a whole, unlike a sequenceto-sequence model, which only learns how the most recent response is generated and is better suited to translationstyle tasks that transform the same information from one modality to another. Second, compared to LSTM models, an attention-based RNN-LM also allows for gapped context and a flexible combination of conversation history for every individual generated token, while maintaining low model complexity. Third, attention models yield interpretable results—we visualize the learned attention weights, showing how attention chooses the salient words from the dialogue history that are important for generating each new word. Such a visualization is typically harder for the hidden states and gates of conventional LSTM and RNN language models.\nWith an attention mechanism, there are multiple options for defining the token representation r0:t−1. The original attention model introduced by Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio (2015) uses the hidden units h0:t−1 as the token representations r0:t−1. Recent work (Mei, Bansal, and Walter 2016a; Mei, Bansal, and Walter 2016b) has demonstrated that performance can be improved by using multiple abstractions of the input, e.g., ri = (E>wi , h > i ) >, which is what we use in this work."

Such supervision is not commonly available, and we use unsupervised methods to learn document-level latent topics. We employ the learned topic model to select the best continuation based on document-level topic-matching.\nWe choose Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003; Blei and Lafferty 2009) due to its demonstrated ability to learn a distribution over latent topics given a collection of documents. This generative model assumes documents {w0:Tn}Nn=1 arise from K topics, each of which is defined as a distribution over a fixed vocabulary of terms, which forms a graphical structure L that can be learned from the training data.

Additionally, we also adopt BLEU score (Papineni et al. 2001), to evaluate the quality of generations produced by the models. While not perfect, we believe that BLEU score is a suitable metric for evaluating topic-concentration, as it evaluates the generated continuation by counting explicit n-gram match relative to a set of references, and because word-matching can be a reasonable proximity for topic-matching.\nFinally, we also present evaluation using the diversitybased Distinct-1 metric (proposed by Li et al. (2016a)) to measure the ability of the A-RNN to promote diversity in the generations, because typical neural dialogue models generate generic, safe responses (technically appropriate but not informative, e.g., “I dont know”). Distinct-1 is computed as the number of distinct unigrams in the generation scaled by the total number of generated tokens."

(2016) and first pretrain on a large Q-A SubTitle dataset (Ameixa et al. 2014) and then finetune on the target MovieTriples dataset. The Q-A SubTitle dataset contains approximately 5.5M question-answer pairs, from which we randomly sample 20000 pairs as the held-out set. We performed early-stopping according to the PPL score on the held-out set. We tuned the dimensionality d ∈ {200, 300, 400, 500} of the RNN hidden states, and chose d = 300. We similarly use a setting of d = 300 on the Ubuntu Troubleshoot dataset. We use Adam (Kingma and Ba 2015) for optimization in RNN back-propagation.\nWhen training the attention-RNN dialogue model, we perform early-stopping and model selection based on the PPL values on the development set, following Luan, Ji, and Ostendorf (2016). For the LDA-based re-ranker, we choose the two hyper-parameters, i.e., the number of topics K and ranking weight λ, based on the values of recall@N and BLEU score on the development set. In the end, we choose K = 10 out of K ∈ {5, 10, 20, 50} and λ = 0.45 out of λ ∈ {0.00, 0.05, . . . , 0.95, 1.00}."

      "text" : "We qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of our A-RNN model through visualizations of the output on both datasets. The A-RNN generates meaningful and topically coherent responses on the MovieTriples dataset (Fig. 6a). In comparison, the vanilla RNN tends to produce generic answers, such as “i don’t know”. On the Ubuntu Troubleshoot dataset, the A-RNN either provides promising technical solutions or follows up with useful questions (Fig. 6b)."

    "abstractText" : "We model coherent conversation continuation via RNNbased dialogue models equipped with a dynamic attention mechanism. Our attention-RNN language model dynamically increases the scope of attention on the history as the conversation continues, as opposed to standard attention (or alignment) models with a fixed input scope in a sequence-tosequence model. This allows each generated word to be associated with the most relevant words in its corresponding conversation history. We evaluate the model on two popular dialogue datasets, the open-domain MovieTriples dataset and the closed-domain Ubuntu Troubleshoot dataset, and achieve significant improvements over the state-of-the-art and baselines on several metrics, including complementary diversity-based metrics, human evaluation, and qualitative visualizations. We also show that a vanilla RNN with dynamic attention outperforms more complex memory models (e.g., LSTM and GRU) by allowing for flexible, long-distance memory. We promote further coherence via topic modeling-based reranking.",
