INTRODUCTION\nSubspace clustering is one of the most popular techniques for data analysis, which has attracted increasing interests from numerous areas, such as computer vision, image analysis, and signal processing [1]. With the assumption of highdimensional data lying in a union of low-dimensional subspaces, subspace clustering aims to seek a set of subspaces to fit a given data set and perform clustering based on the identified subspaces.\nDuring past decades, many subspace clustering methods have been proposed, which can be roughly classified into four categories: 1) iterative approaches [2]; 2) statistical approaches [3, 4]; 3) algebraic approaches [5–7]; and 4) spectral clustering-based approaches [8–20]. In recent years, spectral clustering-based approaches have achieved the state-of-the-art in subspace clustering, of which the key is finding a blockdiagonal affinity matrix, where the element of the matrix denotes the similarity between two data points and the block-\nLiangli Zhen is with the Machine Intelligence Laboratory, College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China, and the CERCIA, School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.

Xin Yao is with the CERCIA, School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. (e-mail: x.yao@cs.bham.ac.uk).\ndiagonal structure means that only the similarity among intracluster data points is nonzero.\nTo obtain a block-diagonal affinity matrix, most recent spectral clustering-based approaches measure the similarity using so-called self-expression, i.e. representing each data point as a linear combination of the whole data set and then using the representation coefficients to build the affinity matrix. The major difference of those methods is the constraints enforced on the representation coefficients. For example, sparse subspace clustering (SSC) [11] assumes that each data point can be linearly represented by a few of other points. To achieve this end, SSC adopts the ℓ1-norm constraint. Low-rank representation (LRR) [12] encourages the coefficient matrix to be low rank, such that it can capture the global structures of data. To obtain low rankness, LRR enforces the nuclearnorm constraint on the coefficients. Different from SSC and LRR, truncated regression representation (TRR) [17, 19] takes Frobenius norm instead of ℓ1- and nuclear-norm, which has shown promising performance in many real-world applications. Like most existing subspace clustering algorithms [11– 13, 21], the major disadvantage of TRR is that it may not give a satisfactory clustering result when data points cannot be linearly represented with each other. In fact, many real-world data are sampled from multiple nonlinear subspaces, which brings challenges towards TRR and limits its applications in practice.\nTo group the data drawn from multiple nonlinear subspaces, in this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear subspace clustering method, termed kernel truncated regression representation (KTRR). Our basic idea is based on the following assumption, i.e. there exists a projection space in which the data can be linearly represented. To illustrate this simple but effective idea, we give a toy example in Fig. 1. The proposed method consists of the following steps: 1) projecting the input into another space via an implicit nonlinear transformation; 2) calculating the global self-expression of the whole data set in the projection space in which the data can be linearly reconstructed; 3) eliminating the effect of errors such as Gaussian noise by zeroing trivial coefficients; 4) constructing a Laplacian graph using the obtained coefficients; 5) solving a generalized Eigen-decomposition problem and obtain clustering with kmeans. The contributions and novelty of this work could be summarized as follows:\n• We propose a novel method which can cluster the data\npoints drawn from multiple nonlinear subspaces. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonlinear extension of TRR and one of the first several nonlinear clustering approaches.\n2\n• We develop a closed-form solution to our method. This\nmakes our method very efficient, and useful for largescale data sets. • Different from most existing subspace clustering methods\nlike SSC and LRR, KTRR achieves robustness by eliminating the impact of noises in the projection space instead of input space. In other words, KTRR does not require the prior on the structure of errors, which is more competitive to handle corrupted subspaces. Extensive experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms ten other state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms regarding accuracy, robustness, and computational cost.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses some related work. Section III presents the kernel truncated regression and the new robust subspace clustering method. Section IV provides experimental results to illustrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Section V concludes the paper.\nNotations: In this paper, unless specified otherwise, lowercase bold letters represent column vectors, upper-case bold letters represent matrices, and the entries of matrices are denoted with subscripts.

Moreover, MT represents the transpose of M, M−1 denotes the inverse matrix of M, and I stands for the identity matrix. Table I summarizes some notations used throughout the paper.\nII. RELATED WORK\nDuring past decades, some spectral clustering-based methods have been proposed to achieve subspace clustering in many applications such as image clustering [21], motion segmentation [22], and gene expression analysis [23]. The key of these methods is to obtain a block-diagonal similarity matrix of which nonzero elements are only located on the connections of the points from the same subspace. There are two common strategies to compute the similarity matrix, i.e., pairwise distance-based strategy and linear representationbased strategy [16]. Pairwise distance-based strategy computes the similarity between two points according to their pairwise relationship, e.g., the original spectral clustering method adopts the Euclidean distance with Heat Kernel to calculate the similarity, i.e.,\ns(xi,xj) = e −\n‖xi−xj‖ 2\n2σ2 (1)\nwhere s(xi,xj) denotes the similarity between the data point xi and data point xj , and the parameter σ controls the width of the neighborhoods.\nAlternatively, linear representation-based approaches assume that each data point could be represented as a linear combination of some points from the intra-subspace. Based on this assumption, the linear representation coefficient can be used as a measurement of similarity and has achieved state of the art in subspace clustering [11–13, 15, 19, 24– 26] since it encodes the global structure of the whole data set into similarity.\nFor given a data matrixX = [x1,x2, . . .xn] ∈ R m×n, these methods linearly represent X and obtain the coefficient matrix C ∈ Rn×n in a self-expression manner by solving\nminℜ(C) s.t. X = XC, diag(C) = 0, (2)\nwhere diag(C) = 0 avoids the trivial solution which uses the data point to represent itself by enforcing the diagonal elements of C to be zeros. ℜ(C) denotes the adopted prior structured regularization on C and the major difference among most existing subspace clustering methods is the choice of ℜ(C). For example, SSC [11] enforces the sparsity on C by adopting ℓ1-norm via ℜ(C) = ‖C‖1, LRR [12] obtains low rankness by using nuclear norm with ℜ(C) = ‖C‖∗. To further achieving robustness, (2) is extended as follows:\nminℜ(C) + ℘(E) s.t. X = XC+E, diag(C) = 0, (3)\nwhere E stands for the errors induced by the noise and corruption, ℘(E) measures the impact of the errors. Generally, the ℘(·) = ‖E‖F and ℘(·) = ‖E‖1 are used to describe the Gaussian noise and Laplacian noise, respectively. ‖·‖F denotes the Frobenius norm\nDue to the assumption on linear reconstruction, those methods failed to achieve nonlinear subspaces clustering. To address this challenging issue, some recent works have been proposed [15, 24], however, the methods have the following two disadvantages: 1) the methods are computationally inefficient since they involve solving ℓ1- or nuclear-norm minimization problem; 2) Like SSC and LRR, the methods\n3 need the prior on the errors existed in the data sets to get the correct mathematical formulation. If the prior is inconsistent with the real situation, the methods could achieve inferior performance. To solve these issues, we propose a nonlinear subspace clustering method which is complementary to existing approaches. Noticed that, Peng at al. recently proposed to achieve nonlinearity with deep structures [27, 28], which are first works to leverage deep learning and subspace clustering. However, this has been beyond of the scope of this paper.\nIII. THE PROPOSED SUBSPACE CLUSTERING METHOD\nThis section will give the details of our proposed method, which consists of three steps: 1) calculating the kernel truncated regression representation over the whole data set. 2) eliminating the effectiveness of possible errors such as noises from the representation and then building a graph Laplacian. 3) obtaining clustering by performing the k-means algorithm on leading eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Moreover, we also give the computational complexity of the proposed method."

      "text" : "For a given data set {xi} n i=1, where xi ∈ R m, we define a matrix X = [x1,x2, . . .xn]. Let φ: R m → H be a nonlinear mapping which transforms the input into a kernel spaceH, and φ(Xi) = [φ(x1), . . . , φ(xi−1),0, φ(xi+1), . . . , φ(xn)]. After mapping X into a kernel space, the corresponding {φ(xi)} n i=1 is generally believed lying in linear subspaces [15, 24]. Based on this basic idea, we propose to formulate the objective function of our KTRR as follows:\nmin ci\n1 2 ‖φ(xi)− φ(Xi)ci‖ 2 2 + λ 2 ‖ci‖ 2 2, (4)\nwhere the first term is the reconstruction error in the kernel space, the second term serves as an ℓ2-norm regularization, and λ is a positive real number, which controls the strength of the ℓ2-norm regularization term.\nFor each transformed data representation φ(xi), solving the optimization problem (4), it gives that\nci = ( φ(Xi) Tφ(Xi) + λI )−1 φ(Xi)\nTφ(xi), (i = 1, · · · , n). (5)\nNote that it requires O(n4 + mn2) for solving the above problems of n data points with dimensionality of m.\nTo solve (4) more efficiently, we rewrite it as\nmin ci\n1 2 ‖φ(xi)− φ(X)ci‖ 2 2 + λ 2 ‖ci‖ 2 2, s.t. e T i ci = 0,\n(6)\nwhere ei is a column vector with all zero elements except the i-th element is 1, and the constraint eTi ci = 0 eliminates the trivial solution of writing a transformed point as a linear combination of itself.\nUsing Lagrangian method, we obtain that\nL(ci) = 1\n2 ‖φ(xi)− φ(X)ci‖\n2 2 +\nλ 2 ‖ci‖ 2 2 + θe T i ci, (7)\nwhere θ is the Lagrangian multiplier. Clearly,\n∂L(ci)\n∂ci = (φ(X)T φ(X) + λI)ci − φ(X) T φ(xi) + θei. (8)\nLet ∂L(ci) ∂ci = 0, we get\nci = (φ(X) T φ(X) + λI)−1(φ(X)T φ(xi)− θei). (9)\nMultiplying ei on both sides of (9), and since e T i ci = 0, it\nholds that\nθ = eTi (φ(X) T φ(X) + λI)−1φ(X)T φ(xi)\neTi (φ(X) T φ(X) + λI)−1ei\n. (10)\nSubstituting (10) into (9), the optimal solution is given as\nci = qi −P eTi qiei\neTi Pei , (11)\nwhere qi = P(φ(X) T φ(xi)), and P = (φ(X) Tφ(X)+λI)−1. One can find that the solution to (11) does not require φ(xi) to be explicitly computed, i.e. we will only need their dot products. Therefore, we can employ kernel functions for computing these dot products without explicitly performing the mapping φ. For some choices of a kernel κ(xi,xj): R\nm×Rm → R, [29] has shown that κ can get the dot product in the kernel space H induced by the mapping φ. We can combine all the dot products as a matrix K ∈ R N×N whose elements are calculated as\nKij = φ(xi) Tφ(xj) = [φ(X) Tφ(X)]ij = κ(xi,xj), (12)\nwhere φ(X) = [φ(x1), φ(x2), . . . φ(xn)]. The matrix K is the kernel matrix, which is a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix. Accordingly, (11) can be rewritten as\nc∗i = vi −U eTi viei\neTi Uei , (13)\nwhere vi = Uki, and U = (K+ λI) −1.\nIt is notable that only one pseudo-inverse operation is needed for solving the representation problems of all data points. The computational complexity of calculating the optimal solutions in (13) has decreased to O(n3 +mn2) for n data points with m dimensions.\nIt has been proved that, under certain condition, the coefficients over intra-subspace data points are larger than those over inter-subspace data points [17]. After representing the data set by the kernel matrix via (13), we handle the errors by performing a hard thresholding operator Tη(·) over ci, where Tη(·) keeps η largest entries in ci and sets other entries as zeros like TRR, i.e.,\nTη(ci) = [Tη(C1i), Tη(C2i), . . . , Tη(Cni)] T (14)\nand\nTη(Cji) =\n{\nCji, if Cji ∈ Ωi; 0, otherwise, (15)\nwhere Ωi consists of η largest elements of ci. Typically, the optimal η equals to the dimensionality of corresponding kernel\n4 subspace. In this manner, it avoids to model the impact of the noises into the optimization problem explicitly and does not need the prior knowledge about the errors."

      "text" : "In this section, we present the method to achieve subspace clustering by incorporating the KTRR into spectral clustering framework [8].\nFor a given data set X which consists of n data points in R m, we assume that these points should be lying in a union of L low-dimensional nonlinear subspaces. We propose to project the data points into another space, in which the mapped points can be linearly represented by these mapped points from the intra-subspace. From (11), we find that the representation coefficients does not require the projection function in explicit form, but are only needed in dot products. We can induce a kernel function to calculate these dot products, and obtain the representation coefficients via (13).\nMoreover, the existence of the errors in the input data set leads to some error connections among the data points from different subspaces. We propose to remove these errors through a hard thresholding on each column vector of the coefficient matrix C via (14).\nAs we claimed before, these representation coefficients can be seen as the similarities among the input data points. The similarity between two intra-subspace data points is large, and that between two inter-subspace data points is zero or very close to zero. Such that we can build a similarity matrix W based on the obtained coefficient matrix C as\nW = |CT |+ |C|.

Specifically, KTRR obtains the Accuracy around 80% under SNR = 10dB, which are much higher than all other tested algorithms, especially SC, LSA, LRR1, and LRR2.\nThe clustering quality of the compared methods on the images with randomly corruptions is shown in Fig. 5, from which we obtain that:\n• All the investigated methods perform not as well as the\ncase with white Gaussian noise. The result is consistent with a widely-accepted conclusion that non-additive corruptions are more challenging than additive ones in pattern recognition; • All of the test algorithms perform much better on COIL20\ndatabase than on ExYaleB database. The Accuracy of all algorithms are lower than 40% on ExYaleB under 20% and 25% of corrupted pixels. From the Fig. 3, we find that most pixel values of the images from COIL20 database are close to 0 or 255. This leads to some of the corruptions to be useless and weakens the impact to the final clustering results. • The KTRR algorithm is robust to the random pixel\ncorruptions. It achieves the best results under the ratio of affected pixels equals 5% to 15% on the test two databases. It obtains the Accuracy around 60% under the ratio of affected pixels equals 25% on COIL20 database,\n8 (a) (b)\nwhich is a very challenging situation that we can see in Fig. 3. However, the Accuracy of KTRR drops severely with the increase of the ratios of corrupted pixels, and lower than that of SSC under 20% and 25% of corrupted pixels. The KTRR should be improved to handle the images with salt & pepper corruptions."

The experiments are carried out on the first t classes of the database, where t increases from 10 to 100 with an interval of 10. The clustering results are shown in Fig. 6.\nFrom the results, we can see that:\n• In general, with the number of subjects increase, the\nclustering performance is decreased since the clustering difficulty is increasing with the number of subjects growth. • With increasing number of subjects, the NMI of KTRR\nis changed slightly, varying from 100% to 90%. The\npossible reason is that the NMI is robust to the data distribution (increasing subject number) [19]. • The proposed method obtains satisfactory performance on\nCOIL 100 database.

A bigger λ is suitable for highly corrupted databases, and η corresponds to the dimensionality of the corresponding subspace for the mapped data points.\nTo evaluate the impact of λ and k, we conduct the experiment on the ExYaleB and COIL20 databases. We set the λ from 10−5 to 102, and η from 1 to 50, the results are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 .\nFrom the results, we get the following observations:\n• The proposed method achieves the best clustering perfor-\nmance with λ and η as 0.1 and 5 on ExYaleB database, and 10 and 4 on COIL20 database, respectively. • The proposed method can obtain satisfactory performance\nwith λ from 0.1 to 1 on ExYaleB database, where the Accuracy, NMI , ARI , and Fscore are more than 85%, 90%, 75%, and 75%, respectively, and with λ from 0.2 to 100 on COIL20 database, where the Accuracy, NMI , ARI , and Fscore are more than 80%, 90%, 80%, and 80%. The performance of KTRR is not sensitive to the parameter of λ, which makes KTRR be suitable for the real applications. • The clustering quality with η from 3 to 10 on ExYaleB and COIL20 databases are much better than other cases.

      "heading" : "I. Different Kernel Functions",
      "text" : "The commonly used kernel functions are polynomial kernels, radial basis functions, and sigmoid kernels. To investigate the performance of the proposed method using different kernels, we study six different kernel functions. The results on\n10\nUSPS and MINIST databases are shown in Table VIII, from which we can get the following observations:\n• The kernel function κ(xi,xj) = e −\n‖xi−xj‖ 2\nσ2 achieves the\nbest performance on USPS database. While the kernel function κ(xi,xj) = (x T i xj) 2 obtains the best performance on MNIST database.\n• The kernel function κ(xi,xj) = (x T i xj) 3 outperforms\nκ(xi,xj) = (x T i xj) 2 on USPS database, which is different to that on MNIST database. It is mainly caused by the fact that the images from USPS database lie in much higher nonlinear subspaces than that from MNIST database, and the former function induced a much more nonlinear mapping. • The selection of different kernels results in a great\ndifference in the subspace clustering performance both on USPS database and MNIST database.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have incorporated the kernel technique into TRR method to achieve robust nonlinear subspace clustering. It does not need the prior knowledge about the structure of errors in the input data and remedies the drawback of the existing TRR method that it cannot deal with the data points from nonlinear subspaces. Moreover, through the theoretical analysis of our proposed mathematical model, we find that the developed optimization problem can be solved analytically, and the closed-form solution is only dependent on the kernel matrix. Theses advantages make our proposed method useful in many real-world applications. Comprehensive experiments\n11\non four real-world image databases have demonstrated the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method.\nIn the future, we plan to conduct a systematical investigation on the selection of optimal kernel for our proposed method and study how to determine the number of nonlinear subspaces automatically.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 61432012, 61329302, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) of U.K. under grant EP/J017515/1.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.

    "abstractText" : "Subspace clustering aims to group data points into multiple clusters of which each corresponds to one subspace. Most existing subspace clustering methods assume that the data could be linearly represented with each other in the input space. In practice, however, this assumption is hard to be satisfied. To achieve nonlinear subspace clustering, we propose a novel method which consists of the following three steps: 1) projecting the data into a hidden space in which the data can be linearly reconstructed from each other; 2) calculating the globally linear reconstruction coefficients in the kernel space; 3) truncating the trivial coefficients to achieve robustness and block-diagonality, and then achieving clustering by solving a graph Laplacian problem. Our method has the advantages of a closed-form solution and capacity of clustering data points that lie in nonlinear subspaces. The first advantage makes our method efficient in handling large-scale data sets, and the second one enables the proposed method to address the nonlinear subspace clustering challenge. Extensive experiments on five realworld datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with ten state-of-the-art approaches regarding four evaluation metrics.",
