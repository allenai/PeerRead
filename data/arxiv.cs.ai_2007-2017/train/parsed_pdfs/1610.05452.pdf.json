      "heading" : "1. Introduction and Motivation",
      "text" : "Cooperative path-finding - CPF [14, 23, 25] (also known as multi-agent path finding -\nMAPF [21, 22, 37, 38] or as multi-robot path planning - MRPP [18, 19] or as pebble motion\non a graph - PMG [14, 16]) is an abstraction for many real-file tasks where the goal is to\nrelocate some objects that spatially interacts with each other. In case of CPF, we are speak-\ning about mobile agents (or robots) that can be moved in a certain environment. Each agent\nstarts at a given initial position in the environment and it is assigned a unique goal position\nto which it has to relocate. The problem consists in finding a spatial-temporal path for each\nagent by which the agent can relocate itself from its initial position to the given goal with-\nout colliding with other agents (that are simultaneously trying to reach their goals as well).\nA graph theoretical abstraction, where the environment in which agents are moving is\nmodeled as an undirected graph, is often adopted [18, 20]. Agents are represented as dis-\ncrete items placed in vertices of the graph in this abstraction. Space occupancy imposed by\npresence of agents is modeled by the requirement that at most one agent resides in each\nvertex.\nMovements of agents are also greatly simplified in the abstraction. An agent can in-\nstantaneously move to a neighboring vertex assumed that the target vertex is unoccupied\n1 This is a preprint submitted to ArXiv on October 18, 2016.\nPavel Surynek 2\nand no other agent is trying to enter the same target vertex simultaneously. Note that vari-\nous versions of the problem may have different conditions on movements - sometimes it is\nfor instance allowed to move agents in a train like manner [28] or even rotate agents around\ncycle without any unoccupied vertex in the cycle [39].\nThere are many practical motivations for CPF ranging from unit navigation in computer\ngames [24] to item relocation in automated storage (see KIVA robots [13]). Interesting\nmotivations can be also found in traffic where problems like vessel avoidance at sea are of\ngreat practical importance [12]. An analogical challenge appears in the air where availabil-\nity of drones implies need for developing cooperative air traffic control mechanisms [15].\nWe suggest to solve CPF via reducing it to propositional satisfiability (SAT) [7]. Par-\nticularly we are dealing with so-called makespan optimal solving of CPF [23, 29], which\nmeans to find a solution of a makespan as short as possible. The makespan of a solution is\nthe number of steps necessary to execute all the moves of the solution. In other words, it is\nthe length of the longest path from paths traveled by individual agents. It is known that\nfinding makespan optimal solutions to CPF is a difficult problem, namely it is NP-hard\n[16, 32, 39]. Hence reducing the makespan optimal CPF to SAT is justified as both prob-\nlems are at the same level in terms of the complexity. Moreover, the reduction allows ex-\nploiting the power of modern SAT solvers [2, 3] in CPF solving. The question however is\nthe design of an encoding of the CPF problem into propositional formula. Several encod-\nings of CPF into propositional formulae are introduced in this paper. They are based on a\nso-called time expansion of the graph that models the environment [11, 26] so that the\nformula can represent all the possible arrangements of agents at all the time steps up to the\ngiven final time step. All the encodings are thoroughly experimentally evaluated with each\nother and also with alternative techniques for makespan optimal CPF solving."

      "text" : "The approach to solve CPF by reducing it to SAT has multiple alternatives. There exist\nalgorithms based on search that find makespan optimal or near optimal solutions. The sem-\ninal work in this category is represented by Silver’s WHCA* algorithm [20] which is a\nvariant of A* search where cooperation among agents is incorporated. Recent contributions\ninclude OD+ID [23], which is a combination of A* and powerful agent independence de-\ntection heuristics, and ICTS [21] which employs the concept of increasing cost tree (instead\nof makespan, the total cost of solution is optimized). Other approaches resolve conflicts\namong robot trajectories when avoidance is necessary [5, 8, 34].\nFast polynomial time algorithms for generating makespan suboptimal solutions include\nPUSH-AND-ROTATE [37, 38] and other algorithms [28]. The drawback of these algorithms\nis that their solutions are dramatically far from the optimum.\nTranslation of CPF to a different formalism, namely to answer set programming (ASP),\nhas been suggested in [9]. Integer programming (IP) as the target formalism has been also\nused [39].

      "text" : "An arbitrary undirected graph can model the environment where agents are moving. Let \uD835\uDC3A = (\uD835\uDC49, \uD835\uDC38) be such a graph where \uD835\uDC49 = {\uD835\uDC631, \uD835\uDC632, … , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC5B} is a finite set of vertices and \uD835\uDC38 ⊆ (\uD835\uDC49 2 ) is a set of edges. The configuration of agents in the environment is modeled by assigning them vertices of the graph. Let \uD835\uDC34 = {\uD835\uDC4E1, \uD835\uDC4E2, … , \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDF07} be a finite set of agents. Then, a configuration of agents in vertices of graph \uD835\uDC3A will be fully described by a location function \uD835\uDEFC: \uD835\uDC34 ⟶ \uD835\uDC49; the interpretation is that an agent \uD835\uDC4E ∈ \uD835\uDC34 is located in a vertex \uD835\uDEFC(\uD835\uDC4E). At most one agent can be located in a vertex; that is \uD835\uDEFC is a uniquely invertible function. A generalized inverse of \uD835\uDEFC denoted as \uD835\uDEFC−1: \uD835\uDC49 ⟶ \uD835\uDC34 ∪ {⊥} will provide us an agent located in a given vertex or ⊥ if the vertex is empty.\nDefinition 1 (COOPERATIVE PATH FINDING). An instance of cooperative path-finding problem (CPF) is a quadruple Σ = [\uD835\uDC3A = (\uD835\uDC49, \uD835\uDC38), \uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDEFC0, \uD835\uDEFC+] where location functions \uD835\uDEFC0 and \uD835\uDEFC+ define the initial and the goal configurations of a set of agents \uD835\uDC34 in \uD835\uDC3A respectively. □\nThe dynamicity of the model assumes a discrete time divided into time steps. A configuration \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56 at the \uD835\uDC56-th time step can be transformed by a transition action which instantaneously moves agents in the non-colliding way to form a new configuration \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56+1. The resulting configuration \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56+1 must satisfy the following validity conditions:\n ∀\uD835\uDC4E ∈ \uD835\uDC34 either \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56(\uD835\uDC4E) = \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56+1(\uD835\uDC4E) or {\uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56(\uD835\uDC4E), \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56+1(\uD835\uDC4E)} ∈ \uD835\uDC38 holds (agents move along edges or not move at all),\n ∀\uD835\uDC4E ∈ \uD835\uDC34 \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56(\uD835\uDC4E) ≠ \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56+1(\uD835\uDC4E) ⇒ \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56 −1(\uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56+1(\uD835\uDC4E)) =⊥\n(agents move to vacant vertices only), and\n ∀\uD835\uDC4E, \uD835\uDC4F ∈ \uD835\uDC34 \uD835\uDC4E ≠ \uD835\uDC4F ⇒ \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56+1(\uD835\uDC4E) ≠ \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56+1(\uD835\uDC4F) (no two agents enter the same target/unique\ninvertibility of resulting arrangement).\nThe task in cooperative path finding is to transform \uD835\uDEFC0 using above valid transitions to \uD835\uDEFC+. An illustration of CPF and its solution is depicted in Figure 1.\nDefinition 2 (SOLUTION, MAKESPAN). A solution of a makespan \uD835\uDF02 to a cooperative path finding instance Σ = [\uD835\uDC3A, \uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDEFC0, \uD835\uDEFC +] is a sequence of arrangements \uD835\uDC60 = [\uD835\uDEFC0, \uD835\uDEFC1, \uD835\uDEFC2, … , \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDF02] where \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDF02 = \uD835\uDEFC + and \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56+1 is a result of valid transformation of \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC56 for every \uD835\uDC56 = 1,2, … , \uD835\uDF02 − 1. □\nThe number |\uD835\uDC60| = \uD835\uDF02 is a makespan of solution \uD835\uDC60. It is often a question whether there exists a solution of Σ of the given makespan \uD835\uDF02 ∈ ℕ. This is known as a decision variant of CPF. It is known that the decision variant of CPF is NP-complete, hence finding makespan optimal solution to CPF is NP-hard [16]. Note that due to no-ops introduced in valid transitions, it is equivalent to ask whether there is a solution of exactly the given makespan ant to ask whether there is a solution of at most given makespan.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nPavel Surynek 4"

      "heading" : "4. Solving CPF Optimally through Propositional Satisfiability",
      "text" : "The question we are addressing is how to obtain makespan optimal solutions of CPFs in some practical manner. The approach we are suggesting here employs propositional satisfiability (SAT) [1] solving as the key technology. Note that the decision variant of CPF is in NP, hence it can be reduced to propositional satisfiability. That is, a propositional formula \uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02) such that it is satisfiable if and only if a given CPF Σ with makespan \uD835\uDF02 is solvable can be constructed. Being able to construct such a formula \uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02) one can obtain the optimal makespan for the given CPF Σ by asking multiple queries whether formula \uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02) is satisfiable with different makespan bounds \uD835\uDF02. Various strategies of choice of makespan bounds for queries exist for getting the optimal makespan. The simplest and efficient one at the same time is to try sequentially makespan \uD835\uDF02 = 1,2, … until \uD835\uDF02 equal to the optimal makespan is reached. This strategy will be further referred as sequential increasing. The sequential increasing strategy is also used in domain independent planners such as SATPLAN [11], SASE [10] and others. Pseudo-code of the strategy is listed as Algorithm 1.\nThe focus here is on SAT encoding while querying strategies are out of scope of the paper; though let us mention that in depth study of querying strategies is given in [17]. There is a great potential in querying strategies as they can bring speedup of planning process in orders of magnitude, especially when combined with parallel processing.\nThe important property of propositional encoding \uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02) is that a solution of CPF Σ of makespan \uD835\uDF02 can be unambiguously extracted from satisfying valuation of \uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02) (otherwise, equivalence between solvability of CPF Σ bounded by \uD835\uDF02 and solvability of \uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02) could be trivially established by setting \uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02) ≡ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38 in case Σ is solvable in \uD835\uDF02 time steps and \uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02) ≡ \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38 otherwise). Note that the solving process represented by Algorithm 1 is incomplete, as it does not terminate when the input instance is unsolvable. Nevertheless, the solving process can be easily made complete by checking instance solvability prior to SAT-based optimization by some fast polynomial time algorithm such as those described in [14, 28, 38].\nMakespan Optimal Solving of Cooperative Path-Finding\n5\nAlgorithm 1. SAT-based optimal CPF solving – sequential increasing strategy. The algorithm sequentially finds the smallest possible makespan \uD835\uDF02 for that a given CPF Σ = (\uD835\uDC3A, \uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDEFC0, \uD835\uDEFC+) is solvable. A question whether a solution of CPF Σ exists is constructed with respect to increasing makespans and submitted to a SAT solver.\ninput: Σ – a CPF instance output: a pair consisting of the optimal makespan and corresponding optimal solution\nfunction Find-Optimal-Solution-Sequentially (Σ = (G, \uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDEFC0, \uD835\uDEFC+)): pair 1: \uD835\uDF02 ← 1 2 loop 3: \uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02) ←Encode-CPF-as-SAT (\uD835\uDEF4, \uD835\uDF02) 4: if Solve-SAT (\uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02)) then 5: \uD835\uDC60 ← Extract-Solution-from-Valuation(\uD835\uDC39(Σ, \uD835\uDF02)) 6: return (\uD835\uDF02, \uD835\uDC60) 7: \uD835\uDF02 ← \uD835\uDF02 + 1 8: return (∞, ∅)\nThe important advantage of solving CPF as SAT is that there exist many powerful solvers for SAT [2, 3] implementing numerous advanced techniques such as intelligent search space pruning and learning. The spectrum of these techniques is so rich and so well engineered in modern SAT solvers that it is almost impossible to reach the equal level of advancement in solving CPF by own dedicated solver. Nevertheless, all the well-engineered techniques implemented in SAT solvers can be employed in CPF solving if it is translated to SAT. Note, that the effect of SAT solving techniques is indirect in CPF solving as it is mediated through the translation. Hence, the design of the encoding of CPF as SAT should take into consideration the way in which SAT solvers operate."

Assume that a solution \uD835\uDC60 = [\uD835\uDEFC0, \uD835\uDEFC1, \uD835\uDEFC2, … , \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDF02] of makespan \uD835\uDF02 of given CPF Σ exists.

Path \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 will correspond to the trajectory of agent \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56; that is, \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 = ([\uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56),0], [\uD835\uDEFC1(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56),1], …, [\uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDF02(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDF02]). The path constructed in this way is a correct path in ExpT(\uD835\uDC3A, \uD835\uDF02), since {\uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC59(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC59+1(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56)} ∈ \uD835\uDC38 or \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC59(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56) = \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC59+1(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56) for \uD835\uDC59 = 0,1, … , \uD835\uDF02 − 1; that is, ([\uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC59(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDC59], [\uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC59+1(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDC59 + 1]) ∈ \uD835\uDC38′ holds by construction of ExpT(\uD835\uDC3A, \uD835\uDF02).

The trajectory of agent \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 is set as follows: \uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56) = \uD835\uDC620, \uD835\uDEFC1(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56) = \uD835\uDC621, \uD835\uDEFC2(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56) = \uD835\uDC622, …, \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDF02(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56) = \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02. It can be easily verified that validity conditions (1) – (3) are satisfied by such a construction. Paths are vertex disjoint, so agents do not collide by following them – condition (2) is satisfied. As paths do not overlap agents either stay in a vertex or move into a vertex that was not occupied in the previous step. Altogether, validity conditions (1) – (3) are satisfied. "

Variables \uD835\uDCAF\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 represent transitions of agents among vertices. Zero value is reserved for no-movement. Half of remaining values from 1 to degG(\uD835\uDC63) represent outgoing movements from \uD835\uDC63 to some neighbor indicated by \uD835\uDCAF\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59; the other half of values represent incoming movements into \uD835\uDC63 from some of its neighbors indicated by \uD835\uDCAF\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 − degG(\uD835\uDC63). It is not straightforward to encode the above finite domain model into propositional model where finite domain state variables are replaced with bit-vectors (vectors of propositional variables) using binary encoding as we need to represent quite complex integer constraints over bit vectors. Variables \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 are modeled by a vector of ⌈log2(\uD835\uDF07 + 1)⌉ propositional variables where individual (propositional) bits will be accessed by a bit index \uD835\uDD5A ∈ {0,1, … , ⌈log2(\uD835\uDF07 + 1)⌉ − 1} denoted as \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 [\uD835\uDD5A]. Variables \uD835\uDCAF\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 are modeled by vectors of ⌈log2(2 ⋅ deg\uD835\uDC3A(\uD835\uDC63) + 1)⌉ propositional variables. Note, that typical environments are connected only locally, which means that deg\uD835\uDC3A(\uD835\uDC63) ≪ \uD835\uDF07 typically. If the represented finite domain variable has the number of states that is different from the power of 2, then extra states are forbidden.\nConstraints need to distinguish between all the 2 ⋅ degG(\uD835\uDC63) + 1 states of \uD835\uDCAF\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 variables since over bit vectors we are able to express very simple constraints only – such as an expression that a bit vector equals to a constant. Note that over \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 variables we only need to model equality between them and equality to zero which does not distinguish between too many cases. Let \uD835\uDD53: ℕ0×ℕ0 → {0,1} be a binary representation of positive integers where \uD835\uDD53(\uD835\uDC65, \uD835\uDD5A) represents value of the \uD835\uDD5A-th bit in binary encoding of \uD835\uDC65; that is \uD835\uDC65 = ∑ \uD835\uDD53(\uD835\uDC65, \uD835\uDD5A) ⋅ 2\uD835\uDD5A\uD835\uDC4F−1\uD835\uDD5A=0 .

For simplicity, we will show the proposition over finite domain variables instead of bit-vectors. The equivalence between bit vectors and finite domain variables is can be seen directly from the translation of finite domain constraints to equivalent constraints over bit vectors.\nAssume that there exists a collection of vertex disjoint paths Π = {\uD835\uDF0B1, \uD835\uDF0B2, … , \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDF07}, where \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 connects [\uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56),0] with [\uD835\uDEFC+(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDF02].

We can set \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC620 0 = \uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC621 1 = \uD835\uDC56, …, \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 \uD835\uDF02 = \uD835\uDC56.

Other paths from Π are processed in the same way. Observe that there is no conflict in setting the variables; that is, each variable is set at most once by the assignment; which is due to the fact that paths are vertex disjoin. Variables \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 and \uD835\uDCAF\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 that has not been set so far are set to 0. It is not difficult to check that constraints (4) – (6) as well as (7) – (11) are satisfied.\nOn the other hand, if there is a satisfying valuation of \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDF02−\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC49(Σ) then we are able to reconstruct required vertex disjoint paths from it.

Transition state variables \uD835\uDCAF\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 that take just one value ensure that each vertex at each time layer needs to decide if it either is connected to a neighbor or accepts a connection from a neighbor (or is connected to itself). It is ensured that no intersection between selected paths appears as otherwise a vertex must have accepted connections from at least two sources or has to branch connections to at least two neighbors, which is both forbidden. A value of \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 variable is propagated to the next time layer only through the connection of the corresponding transition state variable \uD835\uDCAF\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59. The\nPavel Surynek 12\nfact that agents were propagated to their goals ensures that there must be a paths induced by transition state variables from initial positions of agents to their goal.

For simplicity, we will work on the level of finite domain state variables. Assume that non-overlapping vertex disjoint paths \uD835\uDF0B1, \uD835\uDF0B2, … , \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDF07 exist in ExpT(\uD835\uDC3A, \uD835\uDF02). The satisfying valuation of \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC39(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) can be directly constructed from these paths. Let \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 = ([\uD835\uDC620, 0], [\uD835\uDC621, 1], [\uD835\uDC622, 2], …, [\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02, \uD835\uDF02]), \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59 ∈ \uD835\uDC49 for \uD835\uDC59 = 0,1, … , \uD835\uDF02 where \uD835\uDC620 = \uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56) and \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 = \uD835\uDEFC+(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56). Then finite domain state variables will be set as follows: ℒ\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 0 = \uD835\uDC620, ℒ\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 1 = \uD835\uDC621, …, ℒ\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 \uD835\uDF02 = \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 for every \uD835\uDC56 = 1,2, … , \uD835\uDF07. The assumptions that paths were vertex disjoint and nonoverlapping ensure that constraints (21) and (20) respectively are satisfied. Consecutive vertices in paths are connected by directed edges that correspond to edges in \uD835\uDC3A. Hence, constraints (19) are satisfied.\nAssume on the other hand that we have a satisfying valuation of \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC39(\uD835\uDF02, Σ). We can\nimmediately set \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 = ([ℒ\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 0 , 0], [ℒ\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 1 , 1], [ℒ\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 2 , 2], …, [ℒ\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 \uD835\uDF02 , \uD835\uDF02]) for every \uD835\uDC56 = 1,2, … , \uD835\uDF07. Satisfaction of constraints (19) ensures that constructed sequences of vertices are paths in ExpT(\uD835\uDC3A, \uD835\uDF02) which are moreover vertex disjoint and non-overlapping due to constraints (21) and (20). \nCPF solving via \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC39(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) satisfaction is justified by the following theorem which can be shown by combining Proposition 1 and just proven Proposition 5 (from \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC39(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) satisfaction non-overlapping vertex disjoint paths can be obtained which correspond to CPF solution).

      "text" : "We observed that vertex disjoint non-overlapping paths in time expansion graph resemble a commodity flow [1] in a network of time expansion graph where vertices and edges are assigned unit capacities. The intuition is that edges included into paths should be saturated by one unit of the flow. Such setting conveys commodity from each initial vertex to each goal vertex. However, the correspondence between paths of required properties and flow works in one direction only. The flow reflects well the requirement that paths should be vertex disjoint but does not simulate non-overlapping between paths as well as the correct interconnection between initial and goal vertex of the same agents (the flow may interconnect initial and goal vertices of two distinct agents).\nThe design of the MATCHING encoding will follow the intuition suggested by single commodity flows. It will be divided into two parts – the first part, called FLOW part, will check the existence of a flow that generates non-overlapping vertex disjoint paths. This\nPavel Surynek 16\npart can be regarded as an encoding of a relaxed CPF with anonymous agents where we care about relocation of a group of agents to a set of goal vertices but we don’t care about what particular agent arrives at particular goal vertex (generated paths may interconnect initial and goal vertices of distinct agents). The second part, called MAPPING part, of the encoding maps distinguishable agents to paths marked out by the flow, which eventually override the relaxation from the first part of the encoding. The encoding should allow fast testing of the existence of non-overlapping flow to enable using this test as a heuristic since its existence is necessary condition for existence of a solution.\nDefinition 7 (MATCHING ENCODING – \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDF02−\uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC3B \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC4A (Σ)).

We will work at the level of finite domain state variables \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 instead of bit vectors to simplify the proof.\nAssume that non-overlapping vertex disjoint paths \uD835\uDF0B1, \uD835\uDF0B2, … , \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDF07 exist so that \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 connects [\uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56),0] with [\uD835\uDEFC+(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDF02] in ExpT(\uD835\uDC3A, \uD835\uDF02). Let \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 = ([\uD835\uDC620, 0], [\uD835\uDC621, 1], [\uD835\uDC622, 2], …, [\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02, \uD835\uDF02]), with \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59 ∈ \uD835\uDC49 for \uD835\uDC59 = 0,1, … , \uD835\uDF02 where \uD835\uDC620 = \uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56) and \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 = \uD835\uDEFC+(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56). The satisfying valuation of \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC3B(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) can be easily constructed by setting \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC620 0 = \uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC621 1 = \uD835\uDC56, …, \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 \uD835\uDF02 = \uD835\uDC56. Next, variables representing flow ℳ\uD835\uDC620 0 , ℳ\uD835\uDC621 1 , …, ℳ\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 \uD835\uDF02 are set to \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38 and ℰ\uD835\uDC620,\uD835\uDC621 0 , ℰ\uD835\uDC621,\uD835\uDC622 1 , …, ℰ\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02−1,\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 \uD835\uDF02−1 are set to \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38 as well (the convention that ℰ\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59,\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59+1 \uD835\uDC59 ≡ ℰ\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59 \uD835\uDC59 if \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59 = \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59+1 is used here). Now, observe that all the constraints are satisfied. The interconnection between the FLOW and the MAPPING part (constraints (25) and (26)) is satisfied by the construction so we just need to check constraints in the FLOW part of the encoding. Propagation of the flow from edges to vertices (constraints (24)) is also ensured by the construction. The fact that original paths are vertex disjoint ensures validity of constraints (25) and (26) which together enforce selection of exactly one incoming and one outgoing edge through setting ℰ\uD835\uDC62,\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 variables for each vertex saturated by the flow indicated by ℳ\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 variable set to \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38. Finally, the non-overlapping property of paths is directly translated to satisfaction of constraints (28). Initial and goal location constraints are trivially satisfied. Altogether, \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC3B(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) is satisfied by constructed valuation of its variables. Now let us check the opposite implication. Assume that \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC3B(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) is satisfiable. Let \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 = ([\uD835\uDC620, 0], [\uD835\uDC621, 1], [\uD835\uDC622, 2], …, [\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 , \uD835\uDF02]) such that \uD835\uDC620 = \uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56) and ℰ\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59,\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59+1 \uD835\uDC59 is \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38 for each \uD835\uDC59 = 0,1, … , \uD835\uDF02 − 1. This can be done due to constraints (25) - (27) that propagate flow from the initial positions in the first time layer towards final layer. We shall verify that paths constructed in this way have required properties – are vertex disjoint non-overlapping and interconnects initial and goal positions of agents. FLOW part of the encoding ensures that constructed paths are vertex disjoint and non-overlapping. We need just to add nonoverlapping to already checked flow propagation. The non-overlapping is established by constraints (28). However, the FLOW part does not ensure that \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 = \uD835\uDEFC+(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56); satisfaction\nPavel Surynek 20\nof the FLOW part alone may result in a path that interconnects initial and goal positions of two distinct agents. This is corrected by constraints included in the MAPPING part of the encoding. These constraints propagate agent \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 along edges {\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59 , \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59+1} and eventually force it to appear in \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 where goal constraints (33) and (34) ensure that agent \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 arrives to the right vertex. \nBy combining just proven Proposition 7 and correspondence between non-overlapping\nvertex disjoint paths in ExpT(\uD835\uDC3A, \uD835\uDF02) the following theorem can be immediately obtained.\nTheorem 3 (SOLUTION OF Σ AND \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC3B(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) SATISFACTION).

      "text" : "As all the previous encodings of CPF used binary representation of agent occurrence in a vertex in some form, we also considered encoding of CPF that expresses agent occurrences in vertices directly. That is, there will be single propositional variable that encodes occurrence of a given agent in a given vertex at a given time-step. The resulting CPF encoding will be called DIRECT. While the design of variables is extremely simple in the DIRECT encoding, the set of constraints is more complex as summarized in the following definition [30].\nDefinition 9 (DIRECT ENCODING – \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC45(\uD835\uDF02, Σ)).

It can be easily observed that the vacancy of target vertex and source vertex before and after the move (constraint (41)) is quite repetitive as the right side of the implication is independent of agent \uD835\uDC4E.

It is easy to see that there are exactly (\uD835\uDF02 + 1) ∙ \uD835\uDF07 ∙ |\uD835\uDC49| variables \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E,\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 and \uD835\uDF02 ∙ |\uD835\uDC49| ℰ\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC59 variables just by calculating their index scopes which gives us the result regarding the number of propositional variables in \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC45(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) and \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDF02, Σ).\nEvery time layer and agent adds (|V| 2 ) binary clauses and one |\uD835\uDC49|-ary clause within con-\nstraints (38). Thus, we have (\uD835\uDF02 + 1) ∙ \uD835\uDF07 ∙ (|V| 2 ) binary clauses and (\uD835\uDF02 + 1) ∙ \uD835\uDF07 |\uD835\uDC49|-ary from writing constraints (38) as clauses in total. The similar calculation can be done for constraints (39); we have (\uD835\uDF07 2 ) binary clauses for each time layer and a vertex; that is, (\uD835\uDF02 + 1) ∙ |\uD835\uDC49| ∙ (\uD835\uDF07 2 ) binary clauses in total.\n} Goal locations\n(43)\n} Initial locations (42)\n(44)\n(45)\n(46)\n(47)\nPavel Surynek 22\nThere are two (degG(\uD835\uDC63) + 2)-ary clauses for every vertex \uD835\uDC63 in every time layer except the last one and for every agent from constraints (40), which in total gives \uD835\uDF02 ∙ \uD835\uDF07 (degG(\uD835\uDC63) + 2)-ary clauses for each vertex \uD835\uDC63 ∈ \uD835\uDC49. That is, \uD835\uDF02 ∙ \uD835\uDF07 ∙ |\uD835\uDC49| clauses in total. Note that each implication in constraint (41) develops into 2 ∙ \uD835\uDF07 ternary clauses. There are |\uD835\uDC38| such groups of clauses for every agent and a time layer except the last one. Thus, 2 ∙ \uD835\uDF02 ∙ \uD835\uDF072 ∙ |\uD835\uDC38| ternary clauses are needed in total for expressing constraints (41).\nAltogether, the total number of clauses in \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC45(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) is (\uD835\uDF02 + 1) ∙ (\uD835\uDF07 ∙ (( |V|\n2 ) + 1) +\n|\uD835\uDC49| ∙ (\uD835\uDF07 2 )) + 2 ∙ \uD835\uDF02 ∙ \uD835\uDF07 ∙ (|\uD835\uDC49| + \uD835\uDF07 ∙ |\uD835\uDC38|) which is \uD835\uDCAA(\uD835\uDF02 ∙ (\uD835\uDF07 ∙ |\uD835\uDC49|2 + \uD835\uDF072 ∙ |\uD835\uDC49| + \uD835\uDF072 ∙ |\uD835\uDC38|)).\nConstraints (47) develop into smaller number of clauses if compared with the original constraints (41) which they replace because of the shorter right hand side in the implication in \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDF02, Σ). Concretely, each implication from (47) develops into exactly 2 ternary clauses which gives 2 ∙ \uD835\uDF02 ∙ \uD835\uDF07 ∙ |\uD835\uDC38| ternary clauses in total. Interconnection of auxiliary variables ℰ\uD835\uDC62\n\uD835\uDC59 with their meaning requires \uD835\uDF07 binary clauses per one implication from constraint (46). There are as many as (\uD835\uDF02 + 1) ∙ |\uD835\uDC49| such interconnections which results in (\uD835\uDF02 + 1) ∙ \uD835\uDF07 ∙ |\uD835\uDC49| in total. Hence, the total number of clauses in \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) is (\uD835\uDF02 + 1) ∙ (\uD835\uDF07 ∙ (( |V| 2 ) + 1) + |\uD835\uDC49| ∙ (\uD835\uDF07 2 )) + \uD835\uDF02 ∙ \uD835\uDF07 ∙ (|\uD835\uDC49| + 2 ∙ |\uD835\uDC38|) which is \uD835\uDCAA(\uD835\uDF02 ∙ (\uD835\uDF07 ∙ |\uD835\uDC49|2 + \uD835\uDF072 ∙ |\uD835\uDC49| + \uD835\uDF07 ∙ |\uD835\uDC38|)). \nProposition 9 (PATHS AND \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC45(\uD835\uDF02, Σ)/\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) SATISFACTION).

The same hold for \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDF02, Σ). \nSketch of proof. Assume that non-overlapping vertex disjoint paths \uD835\uDF0B1, \uD835\uDF0B2, … , \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDF07 exist so that \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 connects [\uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56),0] with [\uD835\uDEFC+(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDF02] in ExpT(\uD835\uDC3A, \uD835\uDF02). We will construct a satisfying valuation of \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC45(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) from \uD835\uDF0B1, \uD835\uDF0B2, … , \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDF07.\nLet \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 = ([\uD835\uDC620, 0], [\uD835\uDC621, 1], [\uD835\uDC622, 2], …, [\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02, \uD835\uDF02]), with \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC59 ∈ \uD835\uDC49 for \uD835\uDC59 = 0,1, … , \uD835\uDF02 where\n\uD835\uDC620 = \uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56) and \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 = \uD835\uDEFC+(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), then variables \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56,\uD835\uDC620 0 , \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56,\uD835\uDC621 1 , ..., \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56,\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 \uD835\uDF02 will be set to \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38. This setup of \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E,\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 variables will be set for every \uD835\uDC56 = 1,2, … , \uD835\uDF07.\nIt is now easy to verify that all the constraints from the DIRECT encoding hold. Constraints (38) hold because each directed path \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 intersects the time layer in exactly one vertex. Constraints (39) hold since directed paths are vertex disjoint. As paths go from one time layer to the next, constraints (40) hold as well. Finally, since paths are non-overlapping constraints (41) also hold.\nSatisfying valuation of \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) requires assigning truth values to ℰ\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC59 variables in addition. Nevertheless, truth values of ℰ\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC59 are directly implied from assignment of truth values to \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E,\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 through constraints (46). Satisfaction of constraints (47) is ensured by satisfaction of constraints (41) and by transitivity of implication through the auxiliary ℰ\uD835\uDC62 \uD835\uDC59 . Connecting initial positions of agents with their goals by paths ensures satisfaction of constraints (42)-\nMakespan Optimal Solving of Cooperative Path-Finding\n23\n(45) enforcing that initial time layer and the final time layer correspond to initial and goal arrangements of agent respectively.\nIf on the other hand we have satisfying valuation of \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC45(\uD835\uDF02, Σ), non-overlapping vertex disjoint paths can be constructed from it. Paths \uD835\uDF0B1, \uD835\uDF0B2, … , \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDF07 will be constructed by following variables \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E,\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 . Let \uD835\uDF0B\uD835\uDC56 = ([\uD835\uDC620, 0], [\uD835\uDC621, 1], [\uD835\uDC622, 2], …, [\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 , \uD835\uDF02]) where \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56,\uD835\uDC620 0 , \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56,\uD835\uDC621 1 , ..., \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56,\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDF02 \uD835\uDF02 are \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38. Single path is correctly defined as in each time layer \uD835\uDC59 ∈ {0,1, … , \uD835\uDF02} and agent \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 ∈ \uD835\uDC34 there is exactly one \uD835\uDCB3\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56,\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 with \uD835\uDC63 ∈ \uD835\uDC49 set to \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38 which is ensured by constraints (38). Consecutive vertices in the path are connected by arcs which is ensured by constraints (40). If we consider all the paths together, then constraints (39) enforce that paths never intersects because two distinct agents cannot share a vertex. Finally, non-overlapping is ensured by constraints (41) since whenever non-trivial traversal between two consecutive time layers is made, no other agent can be involved in affected vertices. \nAgain, recall that non-overlapping vertex disjoint paths correspond to CPF solutions\n(Proposition 1) which together with just proven result gives the following theorem.\nTheorem 4 (SOLUTION OF Σ AND \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC45(\uD835\uDF02, Σ)/ \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) SATISFACTION).

      "text" : "Theoretical analysis of the size of encodings has been fine grained so far and it is not straightforward to see immediately how individual encodings compare with each other just by looking on expressions. Therefore, the extreme cases of all the expressions showing the number of variables and clauses have been evaluated and are shown here to provide a more complete picture.\nThe extreme cases concern the number of agents and neighborhood size in the graph \uD835\uDC3A, which is either considered to be constant or asymptotically the same as the number of vertices.\nAssumptions that the number of agents \uD835\uDF07 and the size of neighborhood in the graph asymptotically compares the number of vertices has been adopted in the space analysis in order to show the number of variables and clauses as much as possible in terms of the size of the input graph \uD835\uDC3A = (\uD835\uDC49, \uD835\uDC38).\nThus, we have following 4 scenarios (2 cases for each of 2 parameters):\n Scenario (i): The number of agents \uD835\uDF07 and the size of the neighborhood in \uD835\uDC3A is asymptotically the same as the number of vertices.\n(that is, \uD835\uDF07 ∈ Θ(|\uD835\uDC49|) and degG (\uD835\uDC63) ∈ Θ(|\uD835\uDC49|) for ∀\uD835\uDC63 ∈ \uD835\uDC49). The assumption tells that the graph is highly occupied by agents and that the graph contains many edges. The consequence of the second assumption is also that the number of edges in the graph is asymptotically quadratic with respect to the number of vertices; that is, |\uD835\uDC38| ∈ Θ(|\uD835\uDC49|2).\nPavel Surynek 24\nSpace complexities in terms of the number of variables and clauses based upon\nabove assumptions for this scenario are shown in Table 1.\nMakespan Optimal Solving of Cooperative Path-Finding\n25\nThe measure used here for comparison of encodings is that the smaller number of variables or clauses the better. This is usually a realistic measure as the search space often correlates with the number of (decision) variables when solving the propositional formula satisfiability problem by standard search procedures. Similarly, the small number of clauses means that the overall size of the propositional formula is small and thus it is easier for the overall processing. Nevertheless, such small formula preference should be considered just as an intuitive measure since sometimes lot of variables may be derivable from values of other variables (thus they do not increase size of the search space) and sometimes more clauses may improve propagation.\nPavel Surynek 26\nSeveral conclusions can be made upon asymptotic numbers of variables and clauses in individual encodings presented in Table 1 - Table 4. In cases with many agents and dense graphs (corresponding to scenario (i)), INVERSE and ALL-DIFFERENT encodings excel in a small number of clauses.\nMakespan Optimal Solving of Cooperative Path-Finding\n27\nWhen we have many agents and relatively sparse graphs (scenario (ii)), which is the most common case in practice, then INVERSE and MATCHING encodings excel in both, in the number of variables as well as in the number of clauses.\nThe remaining two scenarios (scenario (iii) and (iv)) can be regarded as non-cooperative scenarios since the number of agents is constant and hence the interaction among them is limited. The ALL-DIFFERENT encoding is the most space saving in a case with dense graphs (scenario (iii)) while INVERSE and MATCHING encodings are the most space saving on sparse graphs (scenario (iv)).\nObserve that DIRECT and SIMPLIFIED encodings do not excel in any of the suggested scenarios. This is mostly caused by the fact that no binary encoding of finite domain state variables, which significantly reduces the size of representation of the state variable using propositional variables, is used in these two encodings."

Intuitively said, a path indicating the trajectory of a given agent cannot go through vertices that there too far from the initial or the goal vertex under given time constraints. In other words, vertices at a given time layer where the distance to the initial position of the agent is larger than the time elapsed for the time layer (which equals to the position of the time layer in the time expansion graph) or where the distance to the goal vertex is larger than the time that remains for the given time layer (which equals to the position of the time layer in the time expansion graph counted from the end) can never be visited by the agent.

A fortiori, there is no path connecting [\uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), 0] and [\uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDF02(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDF02] visiting [\uD835\uDC63, \uD835\uDC59] that does not overlap and does not intersect other paths.

All the vertices [\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57 , \uD835\uDC59] with \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57 ∈ \uD835\uDC49 and \uD835\uDC59 ∈ {0,1, … , \uD835\uDF02} in ExpT(\uD835\uDC3A, \uD835\uDF02) for that distExpT(\uD835\uDC3A,\uD835\uDF02) → ([\uD835\uDEFC0(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), 0], [\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57 , \uD835\uDC59]) = ∞ or distExpT(\uD835\uDC3A,\uD835\uDF02) → ([\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57 , \uD835\uDC59], [\uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDF02(\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDF02]) = ∞ can be excluded from trajectories corresponding to agent \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 (in original graph it translates to the requirement that agent \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 cannot enter \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57 at time step \uD835\uDC59). In all the encodings, this can be done easily as follows:\nThe inequality between a bit vector and a constant is encoded as a single clause that forbids the bit vector to take that constant. That is, at least one bit must disagree with binary representation of the constant. For example, the inequality \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC63 \uD835\uDC59 ≠ \uD835\uDC50 is encoded as follows:\nIt holds that added inequalities are logical consequences of the encoded propositional formulae (that is, for example \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC49(\uD835\uDF02, Σ) ⇒ \uD835\uDC9C\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57 \uD835\uDC59 ≠ \uD835\uDC56 is a valid formula). Thus in theory, the SAT solver should be able to infer that some vertices are not reachable at certain time steps. However, it may be costly to derive such a fact for the SAT solver while the same knowledge can be obtained easily in advance and compiled directly into the formula almost without any increase of its complexity."

The number of agents ranged from 1 up to the half all the vertices in the graph.\nFor each number of agents, 10 random CPF instances were generated and their characteristics were measured. Formulae corresponding to all the suggested encodings were generated for each number of agents. The number of layers in time expansion graphs was fixed and set relatively to the size of the instance – it was 12 for 6⨯6 grid; 16 for 8⨯8 grid; and 24 for 12⨯12 grid.\nv2 v3 v4 v1\nG=(V,E)\nv5 v6 v7 obstacle\nv9 v8\nv11 v12 v13 v10\nobstacles\nPavel Surynek 30\nThe average number of propositional variables, average number of clauses, ratio between the number of clauses and variables, and average clause length were calculated for each encoding and number of agents out of 10 randomly generated instances. Partial results are shown in Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7 – preferred values of individual characteristics are listed in bold.\nThe number of variables and clauses directly correspond to the size of formulae. Preference is given to formulae that are smaller as they are expected to be easier to solve as well as easier for processing.\nThe ratio of the number of clauses and the number of variables is an important measure of the difficulty of propositional formula. Formulae that are under-constrained or overconstrained are easier to solve [7] (easily satisfiable or easily unsatisfiable respectively) and hence such situation is preferred in formulae encoding CPF.\nA very important characteristic is the average length of clause while short clauses are preferred since they support unit propagation [7], which allows deriving values for other variable without search.\nResults indicate that DIRECT and SIMPLIFIED encodings have best size characteristics with respect to the small size preference in cases with small number of agents in the instance. This result can be observed for all the sizes of the grid modeling the environment. As the neighborhood connectivity in 4-connected grids can be regarded as constant; that is, degG (\uD835\uDC63) ∈ Θ(1) for ∀\uD835\uDC63 ∈ \uD835\uDC49, the cases, where DIRECT and SIMPLIFIED encoding have best size characteristics, roughly correspond to scenario (iv). However, theoretical asymptotic formula size estimations suggest different results - DIRECT and SIMPLIFIED encodings should be same as other encodings in terms of the number of variables and worse than other encodings in terms of the number of variables. Hence, experimental evaluation has shown a surprising result in this aspect.\nMakespan Optimal Solving of Cooperative Path-Finding\n31\nIf the number of agents is higher, the MATCHING encoding dominates in the size characteristics for all the size of the grid. It has the fewest number of propositional variables as well as the fewest number of clauses. If we consider that this case roughly correspond to scenario (ii), these observations correspond to theoretical asymptotic estimations, which indicate that MATCHING encoding together with INVERSE encoding should be smallest (note, that the INVERSE encoding is the second smallest according to experimental results).\nDIRECT and SIMPLIFIED encodings excel in terms of the ratio of the number of clauses to the number of variables. Both encodings tend to be over-constrained, which intuitively suggest easier proving of unsatisfiability. The average length of clauses is shortest for the SIMPLIFIED encoding. As the number of agents increases the average clause length converges towards 2 for all the sizes of the grid (that is, most of clauses are binary in the SIMPLIFIED encoding).\nAbove observations of static characteristics of encodings indicate that MATCHING encoding and especially SIMPLIFIED encoding should perform well in CPF solving (or at least better than other encodings).\nPavel Surynek 32"

      "heading" : "5.3. Runtime Evaluation",
      "text" : "We re-implemented A*-based OD+ID CPF solving procedure [23] in C++ with the objective function for minimizing the makespan and compared it with our SAT based solving method in order to provide broader picture regarding the runtime evaluation.\nAgain, CPFs over 4-connected grids of sizes 6⨯6, 8⨯8, and 12⨯12 with 20% of vertices occupied by randomly placed obstacles were used. Initial and goal arrangements of agents were generated randomly. Runtime evaluation was done for the increasing number of agents in instances while for each number of agents 10 random instances were generated and solved. All the instances used for evaluation were solvable.\nThe timeout for single CPF instance solving was set to 256 seconds (approximately 4 minutes). The number of agents was increased until all the 10 random instances were solvable within the given timeout – that is, each solving method (encoding) is characterized by the maximum number of agents for which it is able to solve all the 10 random instances within the given timeout.\nThe average and median runtimes were calculated out of these 10 instances for all the tested methods. In the case of SAT based CPF solving methods, the runtime is a sum of the runtime of the core CPF solving procedure (corresponding to Algorithm 1) plus runtimes of all the runs of the SAT solver invoked by the core procedure.\nMakespan Optimal Solving of Cooperative Path-Finding\n33\nRuntime results together with average optimal makespan are shown in Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 91 (note that, all the methods generate solutions of the same optimal makespan).\nIt can be observed that OD+ID, although it is the fastest for small number of agents, does not scale up as the runtime quickly blows up for more agents. The SAT-based solving method with all the encodings performs better and scales up for higher number of agents. Particularly, the SIMPLIFIED encoding performs as best in all the sizes of the grid followed by MATCHING, DIRECT, ALL-DIFFERENT, and INVERSE encodings respectively.\nNote that the good performance of the SIMPLIFIED encoding has been predicted by the static analysis of encodings (particularly, it has been assumed to support unit propagation well). Another well competing MATCHING encoding had been predicted to have a good performance as well due to its small size in testing instances.\nAn interesting behavior can be observed with MATCHING encoding that start with almost the same promising performance as the SIMPLIFIED encoding for small number of agents, but it quickly degrades and it is eventually outperformed by the DIRECT encoding\n1 All the runtime measurements were done on a machine with the 4-core CPU Xeon 2.0GHz and 12GB RAM under Linux kernel 3.5.0-48. Although we used multiple cores to run experiments in parallel, the individual instances were solved in a single thread (that is, the core solving procedure and all its call to the SAT solver were run in single thread).\nPavel Surynek 34\non 6⨯6 and 12⨯12 grids for higher number of agents (in case of the 8⨯8 grid, the degradation of the MATCHING encoding can be observed as well but it is less significant – the DIRECT encoding reached the timeout before it could overtake the MATCHING encoding).\nInstances with occupancy by agents up to 62% are solvable within the given timeout in the 6⨯6 grid by using the SIMPLIFIED encoding. This figure is 46% for the 8⨯8 grid and 28% for the 12⨯12 grid for the SIMPLIFIED encoding. OD+ID method can solve instances with occupancy up to 24%, 13%, and 7% in 6⨯6, 8⨯8, 12⨯12 grids respectively. Thus, approximately 3 times more agents are solvable with SAT based method than with OD+ID in given testing instances.\nThe general conclusion from the above experimental evaluation is also that the binary encoding used for encoding finite domain state variables in the INVERSE, ALL-DIFFERENT, and MATCHING encoding contributes to the small size but it is questionable if it contributes the overall performance as these encodings clearly performed worse than the DIRECT and SIMPLIFIED encodings that did not rely on the binary encoding.\nOn the other hand, the simple design of the DIRECT and SIMPLIFIED encodings is not at the expense of the performance of their solving. The simple design of variables allowed modeling constraints using short clauses that significantly support intensive unit propagation, which is most likely the key factor for the good performance of both encodings – especially in the case of the SIMPLIFIED encoding.\nMakespan Optimal Solving of Cooperative Path-Finding\n35"

      "heading" : "5.4. Solution Quality Evaluation",
      "text" : "Although all the solutions generated by the suggested SAT based solving techniques are makespan optimal, that is, the best with respect to our objective function, they may differ in other aspects. Particularly important is the total number of moves performed by agents (also called a sum of costs) which can be regarded as the total energy consumed by agents to perform their movements. The total number of moves is also considered as an objective function in several approaches to CPF solving such as [21, 22]. Hence, it is interesting what do solutions generated by makespan optimal SAT solving look like with respect to the total number of moves despite the fact that this aspect has been completely disregarded in the design of propositional encodings of CPF.\nThe way in which a given problem is encoded into propositional formula greatly affects heuristics the SAT solver uses for selecting variables and their values. Values selected to satisfy the formula are then reflected in the CPF solution reconstructed from its satisfying valuation. Although not a rule, SAT solvers in their default settings usually prefer assigning \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38 value if it is not more advantageous than to assign value \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38. Observe that only values assigned to visible propositional variables are directly reflected in the resulting CPF solution. Visible propositional variables in the suggested encodings are either part of a directly encoded state (DIRECT and SIMPLIFIED encodings) or part of a binary encoded bit vector (INVERSE, ALL-DIFFERENT, and MATCHING encodings).\nPropositional variables within directly encoded state directly correspond to occupancy of a vertex or an edge by a fixed agent. Assignment of value \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38 to a propositional variable of the directly encoded state corresponds to no occupancy by the given fixed agent. Complete no-occupancy appears if and only if all the propositional variables directly encoding the state are set to \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38 for all the agents.\nPavel Surynek 36\nThe interpretation of bit vector propositional variables is that occupancy of a corresponding vertex or an edge appears if any of the propositional variables within the bit vector is set to \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38. No occupancy corresponds to the assignment of integer zero to the bit vector, which means to assign \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38 to all the propositional variables, which the bit vector consists of.\nIf we assume that the SAT solver tries to find a solution conservatively; that is, it prefers to assign \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38 values, then it seems that using encodings with visible variables that directly encode states results in smaller vertex and edge occupancy, which correspond to CPF solutions consisting of fewer total number of moves.\nThe reasoning behind this hypothesis assumes to have a set of agents \uD835\uDC34 and a location (vertex/edge) that is to be occupied by at most one agent from \uD835\uDC34. The occupancy of the location is modeled by directly encoded state in one scenario and as a binary encoded bit vector in the second scenario. The first scenario yields |\uD835\uDC34| propositional variables with |\uD835\uDC34| + 1 allowed assignments - one of these assignments corresponding to no occupancy of the location assigns \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38 to all the propositional variables; other allowed assignments have just a single propositional variable set to \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38. The second scenario yields log2⌈|\uD835\uDC34| + 1⌉ propositional variables - all the possible combinations of Boolean values are allowed as assignments while all the propositional variables set to \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38 correspond to no occupancy of the location. If the preference of assigning \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC38 actually results in setting strictly fewer variables to \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38 then no occupancy immediately appears in the first scenario while there is little chance that no occupancy appears in the second scenario (setting strictly fewer variables to \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38 may lead to another assignment of the bit vector with some propositional variables set to \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC48\uD835\uDC38 - that is, representing some occupancy). Results of measurement of the total number of moves generated by SAT based CPF solving with suggested encodings are presented in Figure 10, Figure 11, and Figure 12. The same set of testing instances over 4-connected grids as in the runtime measurement\nMakespan Optimal Solving of Cooperative Path-Finding\n37\nhas been used. The total number of moves generated by OD+ID is also included in the measurement.\nThe fewest number of moves in most testing instances is yielded by the SIMPLIFIED encoding. Thus, we also present sorted differences in the total number of moves between those yielded by the SIMPLIFIED encoding and other methods. It can be also observed that OD+ID generates solutions with the smallest number of moves in instances containing few agents. Unfortunately, as OD+ID does not scale up well enough it cannot show qualities of its solutions for larger number of agents.\nThere is almost no significant difference in the total number of moves generated by other methods except a marginal tendency of the DIRECT encoding to yield better solutions than methods using binary encoded bit vectors especially observable over 8⨯8 grid. Altogether, we can conclude that the hypothesis that encodings using directly encoded states is more advantageous than encodings with binary encoded bit-vectors with respect to the total number of moves."

      "text" : "Several propositional encodings of cooperative path-finding problem (CPF) have been in-\ntroduced - INVERSE, ALL-DIFFERENT, MATCHING, DIRECT, and SIMPLIFIED encodings. The\npresented encodings are based on the notion of the time expanded graph that expands the\ngraph modeling the environment over time so that arrangements of agents at all the time\nsteps up to a certain final time step can be represented. Time expanded graphs provided an\nessential step towards building propositional formulae, in which a query whether there is a\nsolution of a given CPF with the specified number of time steps is encoded. Obtaining\nmakespan optimal solution is then carried out by submitting multiple encoded queries to a\nPavel Surynek 38\nSAT solver. The reduction of CPF to SAT allows accessing all the advanced search, prun-\ning, and learning techniques of the SAT solver that can be in this way employed in CPF\nsolving.\nThe suggested encodings either use binary encoded bit vectors (INVERSE, ALL-DIFFER-\nENT, and MATCHING encoding) or directly encoded states (DIRECT and SIMPLIFIED encod-\nings) to model arrangements of agents at individual time steps. Using binary encoded bit\nvectors results in smaller formulae in terms of the number of variables and clauses. The\nadvantage of encodings with directly encoded states is on the other hand a better support\nfor Boolean constraint propagation (unit propagation) which enabled by the presence of\nmany short clauses.\nPerformed experimental evaluation indicates that CPF solving via SAT is generally the\nbest option in highly constrained situations (environments densely occupied by agents).\nSAT based CPF solving scales up for larger number of agents much better than the alter-\nnative A* based search technique.\nIf we compare solely SAT encodings, than the SIMPLIFIED encoding turned out to per-\nform as best. Instances with the highest occupancy by agents were solved only by the SIM-\nPLIFIED encoding in the given timeout. Moreover, the comparison of the quality of solutions\ngenerated by the SAT based solving in terms of the total number of generated moves also\nindicates that the SIMPLIFIED encoding generates fewest moves."

    "abstractText" : "The problem of makespan optimal solving of cooperative path finding (CPF) is addressed in this paper. The task in CPF is to relocate a group of agents in a non-colliding way so that each agent eventually reaches its goal location from the given initial location. The abstraction adopted in this work assumes that agents are discrete items moving in an undirected graph by traversing edges. Makespan optimal solving of CPF means to generate solutions that are as short as possible in terms of the total number of time steps required for the execution of the solution. We show that reducing CPF to propositional satisfiability (SAT) represents a viable option for obtaining makespan optimal solutions. Several encodings of CPF into propositional formulae are suggested and experimentally evaluated. The evaluation indicates that SAT based CPF solving outperforms other makespan optimal methods significantly in highly constrained situations (environments that are densely occupied by agents).",
