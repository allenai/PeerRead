      "text" : "Deep neural networks aim at learning multiple level of features by using larger number of hidden layers as compared to shallow networks. Using many layers, higher order features can be automatically learned without the need of any domain specific feature engineering. This makes them more generalized inference systems. They are effective at learning features from raw data which would have required much efforts to pre process in case of shallow networks, for example, a recent work (Zhang and LeCun 2015) demonstrated deep temporal convolutional networks to learn abstract text concepts from character level inputs.\nHowever, having multiple layers, deep networks are not easy to train. Few of the problems are, getting stuck in local optima, problem of vanishing gradients etc. If the hyperparameters of networks are not engineered properly, deep networks also tend to overfit. The choice of activation functions (Glorot and Bengio 2010) as well as proper initialization of weights (Sutskever et al. 2013) plays important role in the performance of deep networks.\nSeveral methods have been proposed to improve the performance of deep networks. Layer by layer training of Deep Belief Networks (Hinton et al. 2006) uses unsupervised pre-training of the component Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and further supervised fine tuning of the whole network. Similar models have been presented (Bengio and Lamblin 2007; Ranzato et al. 2007) that pre-train the network layer by layer and then fine tune using supervised techniques.\nUnsupervised pre-training is shown to effectively works as a regularizer (Erhan et al. 2009; Erhan, Courville, and Vincent 2010) and increase the performance as compared to network with randomly initialized weights.\nThis paper explores the idea of training a deep network to learn hierarchical targets in which lower level targets are learned from taps in lower hidden layers, while the highest level of target (which has highest details) is kept at the final layer of the network. The hypothesis is that this architecture should learn meaningful representation in hidden layers too, because of the branchings. This can be helpful since the same model can be used as an efficient inference system for any level of target, depending on the requirement. Also, the meaningful information content of hidden layer activations can be helpful in improving the overall performance of the network.\nThe following section presents the proposed deep network with hidden layer branchings. Section 3 provides the experimental results on 20 Newsgroups data set 1 along with the details of the network used in the experiment. Section 4 contains the concluding remarks and scope of future work is given in Section 5."

The target layers are arranged in a hierarchical fashion with the most detailed targets being farthest form the input, while trivial targets closer to the input layer.

In this, a vocabulary of words is built from the corpus, and each paragraph (or instance) is represented by a histogram of frequency of occurrence of words from the vocabulary. Although being intuitive and simple, this representation has a major disadvantage while working with neural networks. The vocabulary length is usually very large, of the order of tens of thousands, while each chunk of text in consideration has only few of the possible words, which results in a very sparse representation. Such sparse input representation can lead to poor learning and high inefficiency in neural networks. A new tool, Word2Vec 2 is used to represent words as dense vectors.\nWord2Vec is a tool for computing continuous distributed representation of\n2Python adaptation here https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html (Řeh̊uřek 2013)\nwords. It uses Continuous Bag of Words and Skip-gram methods to learn vector representations of words using a corpus (Mikolov et al. 2013b; Mikolov et al. 2013a). The representations provided by Word2Vec group similar words closer in latent space. These vectors have properties like (Mikolov, Yih, and Zweig 2013):\nv(′king′)− v(′man′) + v(′woman′) ≈ v(′queen′)\nHere, v(′word′) represents the vector of “word”. For the problem in hand, a Word2Vec model with 1000 dimensional vector output was trained using the entire dataset (removing English language stop words). For making a vector for representing each newsgroup post, all the words’ vectors in the post were averaged."

For hidden output cost function, L2 regularization was also added for weights of hidden layer 1. The training was performed using simple stochastic gradient descent using the algorithm explained in Section 2.1 with mini batch size of 256 and momentum value of 0.9.

This was performed to see the state of the losses of the network with respect to the hidden layer targets. All the three training experiments were performed with the same set of hyper-parameters and were repeated 20 times to account for the random variations. Values of mean training losses throughout the course of training were plotted using all 20 repetitions.\nThe plot of training losses for final layer target in experiment 1 and 2 is shown in Figure 2. From the plot, simultaneous training is seemingly performing better than direct training involving only target cost function minimization.\nPlot of training losses for hidden layer target in all three experiments is given in Figure 3. Here, training with only minimization of final cost is not able to generate enough effective representation of data to help in minimization of\nhidden cost function, while simultaneous training and training involving only hidden cost minimization are giving almost similar performance. The situation is clearer in Figure 4, which is plot of losses for hidden target during the fine tuning process for all the three experiments. As this graph shows, training only with final target cost in consideration is not able minimize loss well as compared to other two methods. Also, curve of simultaneous training starts with lesser loss than curve of training with hidden cost only. This depicts better updates of weights in simultaneous training as compared to training with only hidden cost.\nFigure 5 and 6 show box plots of the accuracies over the 20 repeated experiments for hidden and final targets.\nTable 2 shows the mean classification accuracy on final and hidden target for both training and testing set.

Using a hierarchy of target, the proposed architecture can form meaningful hidden representations.\nAn extended experiment can be done with many branches. Convolutional networks working on computer vision problems are ideal candidates for these tests, as it is easy to visualize the weights to find connections with the desired representations. Also, vision problems can be broken in many level of details and thus a hierarchy of outputs can be generated from single output layer.\nWhereas this paper focused on a problem involving branches from the hidden layers, an exploration can be done in which few hidden neurons directly represent the hidden targets without any branching. Further, work can be done for construction of multiple level of outputs from single output. This can be useful for computer vision problems, where different level of outputs can be practically useful."
