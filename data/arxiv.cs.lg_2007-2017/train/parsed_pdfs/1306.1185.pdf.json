      "text" : "Many clustering models rely on the minimization of an energy over possible partitions of the data set. These discrete optimizations usually pose NP-hard problems, however. A natural resolution of this issue involves relaxing the discrete minimization space into a continuous one to obtain an easier minimization procedure. Many current algorithms, such as spectral clustering methods or non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods, follow this relaxation approach.\nA fundamental problem arises when using this approach, however; in general the solution of the relaxed continuous problem and that of the discrete NP-hard problem can differ substantially. In other words, the relaxation is too loose. A tight relaxation, on the other hand, has a solution that closely matches the solution of the original discrete NP-hard problem. Ideas from the image processing literature have recently motivated a new set of algorithms [17, 18, 11, 12, 4, 15, 3, 2, 13, 10] that can obtain tighter relaxations than those used by NMF and spectral clustering. These new algorithms all rely on the concept of total variation. Total variation techniques promote the formation of sharp indicator functions in the continuous relaxation. These functions equal one on a subset of the graph, zero elsewhere and exhibit a non-smooth jump between these two regions. In contrast to the relaxations employed by spectral clustering and NMF, total variation techniques therefore lead to quasi-discrete solutions that closely resemble the discrete solution of the original NP-hard problem. They provide a promising set of clustering tools for precisely this reason.\n∗Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong (xbresson@cityu.edu.hk). †Department of Mathematics, University of California Riverside, Riverside CA 92521 (laurent@math.ucr.edu) ‡Department of Mathematics, University of San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94117 (duminsky@usfca.edu) §Department of Mathematics, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles CA 90095 (jub@math.ucla.edu)\nar X\niv :1\n30 6.\n11 85\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 5\nJ un\n2 01\nPrevious total variation algorithms obtain excellent results for two class partitioning problems [18, 11, 12, 3] . Until now, total variation techniques have relied upon a recursive bi-partitioning procedure to handle more than two classes. Unfortunately, these recursive extensions have yet to produce state-of-the art results. This paper presents a general framework for multiclass total variation clustering that does not rely on a recursive procedure. Specifically, we introduce a new discrete multiclass clustering model, its corresponding continuous relaxation and a new algorithm for optimizing the relaxation. Our approach also easily adapts to handle either unsupervised or transductive clustering tasks. The results significantly outperform previous total variation algorithms and compare well against state-of-the-art approaches [19, 20, 1]. We name our approach Multiclass Total Variation clustering (MTV-clustering)."

      "text" : "Given a weighted graph G = (V,W ) we let V = {x1, . . . ,xN} denote the vertex set and W := {wi,j}1≤i,j≤N denote the non-negative, symmetric similarity matrix. Each entry wij of W encodes the similarity, or lack thereof, between a pair of vertices. The classical balanced-cut (or, Cheeger cut) [7, 8] asks for a partition of V = A ∪ Ac into two disjoint sets that minimizes the set energy\nBal(A) := Cut(A,Ac)\nmin{|A|, |Ac|} =\n∑ xi∈A,xj∈Ac wij\nmin{|A|, |Ac|} . (1)\nA simple rationale motivates this model: clusters should exhibit similarity between data points, which is reflected by small values of Cut(A,Ac), and also form an approximately equal sized partition of the vertex set. Note that min{|A|, |Ac|} attains its maximum when |A| = |Ac| = N/2, so that for a given value of Cut(A,Ac) the minimum occurs when A and Ac have approximately equal size.\nWe generalize this model to the multiclass setting by pursuing the same rationale. For a given number of classes R we formulate our generalized balanced-cut problem as\nMinimize R∑ r=1\nCut(Ar, A c r)\nmin{λ|Ar|, |Acr|}\nover all disjoint partitions Ar ∩As = ∅, A1 ∪ · · · ∪AR = V of the vertex set.  (P) In this model the parameter λ controls the sizes of the sets Ar in the partition. Previous work [4] has used λ = 1 to obtain a multiclass energy by a straightforward sum of the twoclass balanced-cut terms (1). While this follows the usual practice, it erroneously attempts to enforce that each set in the partition occupy half of the total number of vertices in the graph. We instead select the parameter λ to ensure that each of the classes approximately occupy the appropriate fraction 1/R of the total number of vertices. As the maximum of min{λ|Ar|, |Acr|} occurs when λ|Ar| = |Acr| = N − |Ar|, we see that λ = R− 1 is the proper choice.\nThis general framework also easily incorporates a priori known information, such as a set of labels for transductive learning. If Lr ⊂ V denotes a set of data points that are a priori known to belong to class r then we simply enforce Lr ⊂ Ar in the definition of an allowable partition of the vertex set. In other words, any allowable disjoint partition Ar ∩As = ∅, A1 ∪ · · · ∪AR = V must also respect the given set of labels."

      "text" : "We derive our continuous optimization by relaxing the set energy (P) to the continuous energy\nE(F ) = R∑ r=1 ‖fr‖TV ‖fr −medλ(fr)‖ 1,λ . (2)\nHere F := [f1, . . . , fR] ∈ MN×R([0, 1]) denotes the N × R matrix that contains in its columns the relaxed optimization variables associated to the R clusters. A few definitions will help clarify the meaning of this formula. The total variation ‖f‖TV of a vertex function f : V → R is defined by:\n‖f‖TV = n∑ i=1 wij |f(xi)− f(xj)|. (3)\nAlternatively, if we view a vertex function f as a vector (f(x1), . . . , f(xN )) t ∈ RN then we can write ‖f‖TV := ‖Kf‖1. (4)\nHere K ∈MM×N (R) denotes the gradient matrix of a graph with M edges and N vertices. Each row of K corresponds to an edge and each column corresponds to a vertex. For any edge (i, j) in the graph the corresponding row in the matrix K has an entry wij in the column corresponding to the ith vertex, an entry −wij in the column corresponding to the jth vertex and zeros otherwise.\nTo make sense of the remainder of (2) we must introduce the asymmetric `1-norm, which\n‖f‖1,λ = n∑ i=1 |f(xi)|λ where |t|λ = { λt if t ≥ 0 −t if t < 0.\n(5)\nFinally we define the λ-median (or quantile), denoted medλ(f), as:\nmedλ(f) = the (k + 1) st largest value in the range of f , where k = bN/(λ+ 1)c. (6)\nThese definitions, as well as the relaxation (2) itself, were motivated by the following theorem. Its proof, found in the Appendix, relies only on using the three preceeding definitions and some simple algebra.\nTheorem 1. If f = 1A is the indicator function of a subset A ⊂ V then\n‖f‖TV ‖f −medλ(f)‖ 1,λ = 2 Cut(A,Ac) min {λ|A|, |Ac|} .\nThe preceding theorem allows us to restate the original set optimization problem (P) in the equivalent discrete form\nMinimize R∑ r=1 ‖fr‖TV ‖fr −medλ(fr)‖ 1,λ\nover non-zero functions f1, . . . , fR : V → {0, 1} such that f1 + . . .+ fR = 1V .  (P’) Indeed, since the non-zero functions fr can take only two values, zero or one, they must define indicator functions of some nonempty set. The simplex constraint f1 + . . .+ fR = 1V\nthen guarantees that the sets Ar := {xi ∈ V : fr(xi) = 1} form a partition of the vertex set. We obtain the relaxed version (P-rlx) of (P’) in the usual manner by allowing fr ∈ [0, 1] to have a continuous range. This yields\nMinimize R∑ r=1 ‖fr‖TV ‖fr −medλ(fr)‖ 1,λ\nover functions f1, . . . , fR : V → [0, 1] such that f1 + . . .+ fR = 1V .  (P-rlx) The following two points form the foundation on which total variation clustering relies: 1 — As the next subsection details, the total variation terms give rise to quasi-indicator functions. That is, the relaxed solutions [f1, . . . , fR] of (P-rlx) mostly take values near zero or one and exhibit a sharp, non-smooth transition between these two regions. Since these quasi-indicator functions essentially take values in the discrete set {0, 1} rather than the continuous interval [0, 1], solving (P-rlx) is almost equivalent to solving either (P) or (P’). In other words, (P-rlx) is a tight relaxation of (P).\n2 — Both functions f 7→ ‖f‖TV and f 7→ ‖f − medλ(f)‖1,λ are convex. The simplex constraint in (P-rlx) is also convex. Therefore solving (P-rlx) amounts to minimizing a sum of ratios of convex functions with convex constraints. As the next section details, this fact allows us to use machinery from convex analysis to develop an efficient, novel algorithm for such problems."

      "heading" : "3.1 The Role of Total Variation in the Formation of Quasi-Indicator Functions",
      "text" : "To elucidate the precise role that the total variation itself plays in the formation of quasiindicator functions, it proves useful to consider a version of (P-rlx) that uses a spectral relaxation in place of the total variation:\nMinimize R∑ r=1 ‖fr‖Lap ‖fr −medλ(fr)‖ 1,λ\nover functions f1, . . . , fR : V → [0, 1] such that f1 + . . .+ fR = 1V  (P-rlx2) Here ‖f‖2Lap = ∑n i=1 wij |f(xi) − f(xj)|2 denotes the spectral relaxation of Cut(A,Ac); it equals 〈f, Lf〉 if L denotes the unnormalized graph Laplacian matrix. Thus problem (Prlx2) relates to spectral clustering (and therefore NMF [9]) with a positivity constraint. Note that the only difference between (P-rlx2) and (P-rlx) is that the exponent 2 appears in ‖ · ‖Lap while the exponent 1 appears in the total variation. This simple difference of exponent has an important consequence for the tightness of the relaxations. Figure 1 presents a simple example that illuminates this difference. If we bi-partition the depicted graph, i.e. a line with 20 vertices and edge weights wij = 1, then the optimal cut lies between vertex 10 and vertex 11 since this gives a perfectly balanced cut. Figure 1(a) shows the vertex function f1 generated by (P-rlx) while figure 1(b) shows the one generated by (P-rlx2). Observe that the solution of the total variation model coincides with the indicator function of the desired cut whereas the the spectral model prefers its smoothed version. Note that both functions in figure 1a) and 1b) have exactly the same total variation ‖f‖TV = |f(x1)−f(x2)|+ · · ·+ |f(x19)−f(x20)| = f(x1)−f(x20) = 1 since both functions are monotonic. The total variation model will therefore prefer the sharp indicator function\nsince it differs more from its λ-median than the smooth indicator function. Indeed, the denominator ‖fr − medλ(fr)‖1,λ is larger for the sharp indicator function than for the smooth one. A different scenario occurs when we replace the exponent one in ‖ · ‖TV by an exponent two, however. As ‖f‖2Lap = |f(x1)− f(x2)|2 + · · ·+ |f(x19)− f(x20)|2 and t2 < t when t < 1 it follows that‖f‖Lap is much smaller for the smooth function than for the sharp one. Thus the spectral model will prefer the smooth indicator function despite the fact that it differs less from its λ-median. We therefore recognize the total variation as the driving force behind the formation of sharp indicator functions.\nThis heuristic explanation on a simple, two-class example generalizes to the multiclass case and to real data sets (see figure 2). In simple terms, quasi-indicator functions arise due to the fact that the total variation of a sharp indicator function equals the total variation of a smoothed version of the same indicator function. The denominator ‖fr−medλ(fr)‖1,λ then measures the deviation of these functions from their λ-median. A sharp indicator function deviates more from its median than does its smoothed version since most of its values concentrate around zero and one. The energy is therefore much smaller for a sharp indicator function than for a smooth indicator function, and consequently the total variation clustering energy always prefers sharp indicator functions to smooth ones. For bi-partitioning problems this fact is well-known. Several previous works have proven that the relaxation is exact in the two-class case; that is, the total variation solution coincides with the solution of the original NP-hard problem [8, 18, 3, 5].\nFigure 2 illustrates the result of the difference between total variation and NMF relaxations on the data set OPTDIGITS, which contains 5620 images of handwritten numerical digits. Figure 2(a) shows the quasi-indicator function f4 obtained by our MTV algorithm while 2(b) shows the function f4 obtained from the NMF algorithm of [1]. We extract the portion of each function corresponding to the digits four and nine, then sort and plot the result. The MTV relaxation leads a sharp transition between the fours and the nines while the NMF relaxation leads to a smooth transition."

The next theorem states that both B and T define convex functions on RN and furnishes an element v ∈ ∂B(f) by means of an easily computable formula. The formula for the subdifferential generalizes a related result for the symmetric case [11] to the asymmetric setting.\nTheorem 2. The functions B and T are convex.

The set C = Σ or C = Σ ∩ Λ is the convex subset of MN×R that encodes the simplex constraint (7) or the simplex constraint with labels. The corresponding function δC(F ), defined in (11), is the barrier function of the desired set. Beginning from an initial iterate F 0 ∈ C we propose the following proximal splitting algorithm:\nF k+1 := proxT k+δC (F k + ∂Bk(F k)). (14)\nHere T k(F ) and Bk(F ) denote the convex functions\nT k(F ) := R∑ r=1 ckr T (fr) Bk(F ) := R∑ r=1 dkr B(fr),\nthe constants (ckr , d k r ) are computed using the previous iterate\nckr = ∆k\nB(fkr ) and dkr =\n∆kE(fkr )\nB(fkr )\nand ∆k denotes the timestep for the current iteration. This choice of the constants (ckr , d k r ) yields Bk(F k) = T k(F k), and this fundamental property allows us to derive the energy descent estimate:\nTheorem 3 (Estimate of the energy descent). Each of the F k belongs to C, and if Bkr 6= 0 then\nR∑ r=1 Bk+1r Bkr ( Ekr − Ek+1r ) ≥ ‖F k − F k+1‖2 ∆k (15)\nwhere Bkr , E k r stand for B(f k r ), E(f k r ).\nInequality (18) states that the energies of the quasi-indicator functions (as a weighted sum) decrease at every step of the algorithm. It also gives a lower bound for how much these energies decrease. As the algorithm progress and the iterates stabilize the ratio Bk+1r /B k r converges to 1, in which case the sum, rather than a weighted sum, of the individual cluster energies decreases. The proof of Theorem 3 can be found in the Appendix.\nOur proximal splitting algorithm (14) requires two steps. The first step requires computing Gk = F k + ∂Bk(F k), and this is straightforward since theorem 5 provides the subdifferential of B, and therefore of Bk, through an explicit formula. The second step requires computing proxT k+δC (G\nk), which seems daunting at a first glance. Fortunately, minimization problems of this form play an important role in the image processing literature. Recent years have therefore produced several fast and accurate algorithms for computing the proximal operator of the total variation. As T k+δC consists of a weighted sum of total variation terms subject to a convex constraint, we can readily adapt these algorithms to compute the second step of our algorithm efficiently. In this work we use the primal-dual algorithm of [6] with acceleration. This relies on a proper uniformly convex formulation of the proximal minimization, which we detail completely in the Appendix.\nThe primal-dual algorithm we use to compute proxT k+δC (G k) produces a sequence of approximate solutions by means of an iterative procedure. A stopping criterion is therefore needed to indicate when the current iterate approximates the actual solution proxT k+δC (G\nk) sufficiently. Ideally, we would like to terminate F k+1 ≈ proxT k+δC (G\nk) in such a manner so that the energy descent property (18) still holds and F k+1 always satisfies the required constraints. In theory we cannot guarantee that the energy estimate holds for an inexact solution. We may note, however, that a slightly weaker version of the energy estimate (18)\nR∑ r=1 Bk+1r Bkr ( Ekr − Ek+1r ) ≥ (1− )‖F k − F k+1‖2F ∆k\n(16)\nholds after a finite number of iterations of the inner minimization. Moreover, this weaker version still guarantees that the energies of the quasi-indicator functions decrease as a weighted\nsum in exactly the same manner as before. In this way we can terminate the inner loop adaptively: we solve F k+1 ≈ proxT k+δC (G\nk) less precisely when F k+1 lies far from a minimum and more precisely as the sequence {F k} progresses. Overall this leads to a substantial increase in efficiency of the full algorithm.\nOur implementation of the proximal splitting algorithm also guarantees that F k+1 always satisfies the required constraints. We accomplish this task by implementing the primal-dual algorithm in such a way that each inner iteration always satisfies the constraints. This requires computing the projection projC(F ) exactly at each inner iteration. The overall algorithm remains efficient provided we can compute this projection quickly. When C = Σ the algorithm [14] performs the required projection in at most R steps. When C = Σ ∩ Λ the computational effort actually decreases, since in this case the projection consists of a simplex projection on the unlabeled points and straightforward assignment on the labeled points.\nWe may now summarize the full algorithm, including the proximal operator computation. In practice we find the choices ∆k = max{Bk1 , . . . , BkR} and any small work well, so we present the algorithm with these choices.

We compare against two previous total variation algorithms [11, 3], which rely on recursive bi-partitioning, and two top NMF algorithms [1, 19]. We use the normalized Cheeger cut versions of [11] and [3] with default parameters. We used the code available\nfrom [19] to test each NMF algorithm. All non-recursive algorithms (LSD [1], NMFR [19], MTV) received two types of initial data: (a) the deterministic data used in [19]; (b) a random procedure leveraging normalized-cut [16]. Procedure (b) first selects one data point uniformly at random from each computed NCut cluster, then sets fr equal to one at the data point drawn from the rth cluster and zero otherwise. We then propagate this initial stage by replacing each fr with (I + L)\n−1fr where L denotes the unnormalized graph Laplacian. Finally, to aid the NMF algorithms, we add a small constant 0.2 to the result (each performed better than without adding this constant). For MTV we use (a) and 30 random trials of (b) then report the cluster purity of the solution with the lowest discrete energy (P). We then use each NMF with exactly the same initial conditions and report simply the highest purity achieved over all 31 runs. This biases the results in favor of the NMF algorithms. Due to the non-convex nature of these algorithms, the random initialization gave the best results and significantly improved on previously reported results of LSD in particular.

Indeed, a straightforward computation shows\n‖f‖TV = ∑ xi∈A N∑ j=1 wij |1− f(xj)|+ ∑ xi∈Ac N∑ j=1 wij |f(xj)| = ∑ xi∈A ∑ xj∈Ac wij + ∑ xi∈Ac ∑ xj∈A wij .\nThus ‖f‖TV = 2 Cut(A,Ac) as W is symmetric. Let B(f) := ‖f −medλ(f)‖1,λ. To show that B(f) = min {λ|A|, |Ac|}, suppose first that λ|A| ≤ |Ac|. This inequality implies λ|A| ≤ N − |A|, or equivalently that |A| ≤ N/(1 + λ). Thus |A| ≤ k := bN/(1 + λ)c, and since f = 1A for |A| ≤ k it follows immediately that the (k + 1)st largest entry in the range of f equals zero. Thus medλ(f) = 0 by definition. A direct computation then yields that B(f) = ∑ i∈V |f(xi)|λ = λ|A|. In the converse case, the fact that |Ac| < λ|A| implies |A| > N/(1 + λ) ≥ k. Thus |A| ≥ k + 1 and medλ(f) = 1. Direct computation then shows that B(f) = ∑ i∈V |f(xi)− 1|λ = |Ac| as claimed.\nLemma 1. Let h ∈ RN and suppose v ∈ RN satisfies\nv(xi) ∈  λ if h(xi) > 0\n[−1, λ] if h(xi) = 0 −1 if h(xi) < 0.\n(17)\nThen v ∈ ∂‖h‖1,λ.\nProof. Note that |h(xi)|λ = v(xi)h(xi) for each xi, so that for arbitrary g ∈ RN and each xi the inequality\n|g(xi)|λ − |h(xi)|λ ≥ v(xi) (g(xi)− h(xi))\nholds. Summing both sides over all xi ∈ V then gives the claim.\nTheorem 5. The functions B and T are convex. Moreover, given f ∈ RN the vector v ∈ RN defined by\nv(xi) =  λ if f(xi) > medλ(f) n−−λn+ n0 if f(xi) = medλ(f)\n−1 if f(xi) < medλ(f) where  n0 = |{xi ∈ V : f(xi) = medλ(f)}| n− = |{xi ∈ V : f(xi) < medλ(f)}| n+ = |{xi ∈ V : f(xi) > medλ(f)}|\nbelongs to ∂B(f).\nProof. The convexity of T (f) follows directly from its definition and a straightforward computation using the definition of convexity. Due to the continuity B(f), to show convexity it suffices to establish the existence of a subdifferential at every point.\nTo this end note that medλ(f) ∈ range(f), so that in particular n0 ≥ 1 by definition. Let 1 ≤ k := bN/(1 + λ)c < N denote that entry of f so that f(xk) = medλ(f). By definition of medλ(f) there exist at most k elements of f larger than medλ(f), so that n\n+ ≤ k ≤ N/(1 + λ). As N = n− + n0 + n+ this implies λn\n+−n− n0 ≤ 1. Similarly there exist at most\nN − (k+1) elements of f smaller than medλ(f), so that n− ≤ N − (k+1) ≤ N −N/(1+λ). The fact that N = n− + n0 + n+ then implies n\n−−λn+ n0 ≤ λ. Combining this with the\nprevious inequality yields −1 ≤ n −−λn+ n0 ≤ λ.\nPut h := f −medλ(f)1, and note that the vector v defined above satisfies v ∈ ∂‖h‖1,λ by the preceeding lemma. Thus for any g ∈ RN it holds that\n||g −medλ(g)1||1,λ − ||f −medλ(f)1||1,λ ≥ 〈v, g − f + (medλ(f)−medλ(g))1〉\nby definition of the subdifferential. Note also that 〈v,1〉 = 0, so that in fact\nB(g)−B(f) = ||g −medλ(g)1||1,λ − ||f −medλ(f)1||1,λ ≥ 〈v, g − f〉\nfor g ∈ RN arbitrary. Thus v ∈ ∂B(f) by definition of the subdifferential. In particular ∂B(f) is always non-empty, so B(f) is convex.\nTheorem 6 (Estimate of the energy descent). Each of the F k belongs to C, and if Bkr 6= 0 then\nR∑ r=1 Bk+1r Bkr ( Ekr − Ek+1r ) ≥ ‖F k − F k+1‖2 ∆k (18)\nwhere Bkr , E k r stand for B(f k r ), E(f k r ).\nProof. Let V k ∈ ∂Bk(F k). Then by definition of the subdifferential it follows that\nBk(F k+1) ≥ Bk(F k) + 〈F k+1 − F k, V k〉. (19)\nAs F k+1 = proxT k+δC (F k+V k) the definition of the proximal operator implies that F k+1 ∈ C and that also F k + V k − F k+1 ∈ ∂(T k + δC)(F k+1). The definition of the subdifferential and the fact that δC(F k) = δC(F\nk+1) = 0 then combine to imply\nT k(F k) ≥ T k(F k+1) + 〈F k − F k+1, F k + V k − F k+1〉 = T k(F k+1) + ‖F k − F k+1‖2 + 〈F k − F k+1, V k〉 (20)\nAdding (19) and (20) yields\nT k(F k) + Bk(F k+1) ≥ T k(F k+1) + Bk(F k) + ‖F k − F k+1‖2,\nor equivalently that Bk(F k+1) ≥ T k(F k+1) + ‖F k − F k+1‖2 since Bk(F k) = T k(F k) by construction. Expanding this last inequality shows\nR∑ r=1 ∆k Bkr ( EkrB k+1 r − T k+1r ) ≥ ‖F k − F k+1‖2,\nwhich yields the claim after by Bk+1r in each term of the summation."
