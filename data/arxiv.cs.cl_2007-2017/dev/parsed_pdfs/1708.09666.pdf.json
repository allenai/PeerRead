      "text" : "It is an ultimate goal of video understanding to automatically generate natural language descriptions of video contents. A wide range of applications can bene t from it such as assisting blind people, video editing, indexing, searching or sharing. Drawing on the recent success of image captioning [1–4], where a sentence is generated to describe the image content, more researchers are paying a ention to the video captioning task to translate videos to natural language.\nHowever, the open domain videos are quite diverse in topics which makes generating video descriptions more complicated than the image captioning. For various topics ranging from political news to edited movie trailers, the vocabularies and expression styles vary a lot in describing the video contents. For example, for political news videos, words from the political domain occur more\n∗Corresponding author.\nfrequently. Also political news descriptions are typically in the style of somebody reporting something, which are quite di erent from descriptions for other topics such as gaming, travel, movie, and animals etc. Besides the topic diversity across videos, even in the same video, its diversity in content and video structure can result in very di erent video descriptions capturing di erent topics in the video as shown in Figure 1. erefore, the topic information is important to guide the caption model to generate be er topicoriented language expression.\nIn our previous study [5], we have utilized the prede ned topics, the category tags crawled from video meta-data during data collection, to improve the captioning performance. However, the prede ned topics are suboptimal for video captioning because: 1) e crawled information contains labelling mistakes which harms the captioning performance; 2) e exclusive topic labels do not capture the topic diversity nature inside the video; 3) e prede ned topic schema is not specially designed for the video captioning task, which may not re ect the topic distributions well. In this work, we propose the data-driven topics to deal with the drawbacks of prede ned topics. We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic mining model to automatically generate topics from the annotated video captions in training set.\nIn order to use the mined topic information in the captioning task, two questions need to be addressed: 1) how to obtain the topics automatically for testing videos; and 2) how to e ectively\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n09 66\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 3\n1 A\nug 2\n01 7\nemploy the topic information to model the di erence of sentence descriptions in di erent video topics.\nFor the rst question, we take a teacher-student learning perspective [6] to train the data-driven topic prediction model. e LDA topic mining model is viewed as the teacher to guide the student topic prediction model to learn. A video generally contains multiple modalities including image, motion, aural and speech modalities. Image modality provides rich information for understanding the video’s semantic contents such as object and scene. e motion modality presents actions of the objects and the temporal structure of videos. Aural and speech modalities provide additional information for understanding semantic topics from the sound perspective. Hence, we build one general topic prediction model that utilizes all the four modalities and another topic prediction model dedicated to speech modality as its feature representation is di erent from other modalities.\nFor the second question, we propose a novel topic-guided model (TGM) to employ the predicted topics, which is based on the encoderdecoder framework [7]. e TGM functions as an ensemble of topic-aware language decoders to learn speci c vocabularies and expressions for various video topics. We also compare the TGM with a series of caption models that we propose in this paper to exploit the topic information, including topic concatenation in encoder (TCE), topic concatenation in decoder (TCD), topic embedding addition/multiplication in decoder (TEAD/TEMD). ese compared models implicitly use topics to change the input features of the encoder or decoder, while our proposed TGM explicitly modi es the weights in the decoder according to the predicted topics to capture the sentence distributions within the topic more e ectively. e framework of the overall system for testing videos is shown in Figure 2. Experimental results on the MSR-VTT dataset demonstrate the e ectiveness of our proposed method, which can generate more comprehensive and accurate video descriptions.\nIn summary, our contributions in this work include: 1) we show that the data-driven topics are more suitable as the topic representation for video captioning than the prede ned topics, e.g. the category tags, with respect to the topic accuracy and schema; 2) to the best of our knowledge, we are the rst to use the full multimodalities especially the speech modality to successfully boost the\nvideo captioning performance; and 3) the proposed topic-guided model can exploit the topic information more e ectively to generate be er topic-oriented video descriptions.\ne rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the related work. Section 3 compares the prede ned and the datadriven topics. Our proposed topic-guided model is described in Section 4. Section 5 presents experimental results and analysis. Section 6 draws some conclusions."

      "text" : "ere are mainly two directions in previous image/video captioning works. e rst is to build rule based systems, which rst detect words by object or action recognition and then generate sentences with prede ned language constrains. For example, Lebret et al. [1] predict phrases with a bilinear model and generate descriptions using simple syntax statistics. Rohrbach et al. [8] use the Conditional Random Field to learn object and activity labels from the video. Such systems su er from the expression accuracy and exibility.\nMore recently, researches have been focusing on the second direction of encoder-decoder framework [7] which generates sentences based on image/video features in an end-to-end manner. For example, Vinyals et al. [2] utilize the LSTM to generate sentences with CNN features extracted from the image. Venugopalan et al. [9] transfer knowledge from image caption models with the encoder to perform mean pooling over frame CNN features for video captioning. Pan et al. [10] explicitly embed the sentences and the videos into a common space in addition to the video description generation.\nere are also works considering to employ semantic concepts in the encoder-decoder framework. For example, Wu et al. [11] directly generate image captions based on the detected semantic concepts. You et al. [4] propose to selectively a end to concept proposals in the decoder. Gan et al. [12] propose the semantic compositional networks (SCN) which works as an ensemble of concept-dependent language decoder. Our topic-guided model is inspired by SCN but with di erent aims of producing topic-oriented descriptions to address the topic diversity in video captioning. e reasons of using topics rather than semantic concepts are as follows: 1) ere are much more objects in a video than in an image but many\nof them might be irrelevant to the video description. 2) e topics contain more additional information than semantic objects such as from the motion, aural and speech modalities; and 3) e prediction accuracy is very important for the model as shown in [12]. e topic classi cation is much easier than object classi cation.\nFor video captioning, various video topics result in quite diverse expressions compared with image captioning. Previous works have explored generating descriptions for narrow-domain videos such as YouCook [13] and TACoS [14], whose vocabularies and expressions are similar in the dataset. However, for open-domain videos with various topics such as the MSR-VTT dataset [15], Jin et al. [5] exploit the prede ned video categories in the encoder and signi cantly improve the captioning performance, which results in their winning of the MSR video to language challenge [16]. In our work, we further analyze the qualities of the prede ned categories and propose to mine topics in a data-driven approach that leads to be er accuracy and topic schema.\nMulti-modality nature is also emphasized in video captioning. For the motion modality in videos, Yao et al. [17] explore the temporal structure with local C3D features and global temporal a ention mechanism. Venugopalan et al. [18] propose the sequence to sequence structure which utilizes the LSTM as encoder to capture the temporal dynamics of videos. Pan et al. [19] further propose the hierarchical RNN encoder as well as the temporal-spatial a ention. Aural modality has also been explored for video captioning. Jin et al. [5, 20] and Ramanishka et al. [21] integrate the visual and aural features in the encoder by early fusion and show that the multimodal fusion was bene cial to improve captioning performance. In our work, we consider more modalities in videos especially for the use of speech content modality."

Such one-hot topic representation cannot re ect the topic diversity inside the video.\n(3) Suboptimal topic schema: a) Ambiguous category de nition. For example, the ‘people’ category is too general to classify. b) Overlap between di erent categories. For example, the ‘food’ and ‘cooking’ categories cover almost similar videos. c) Large mixed categories. Some categories contain much more videos than others and are mixed with many subclasses. d) Indirect connection with captioning task. e category tags are de ned to organize videos in the wild, they are not speci cally de ned for video captioning.\nerefore, although the prede ned category tags have bene ted video captioning a lot, there is still much room for improvement by de ning a be er topic schema to represent the diversity of videos for the video captioning task."

We note that it requires no additional labelling e ort on the dataset.\nWe observe that the multiple human generated groundtruth captions sometimes do not agree with each other even for the same video. For example, Figure 1 shows an example video and its groundtruth captions which describe the video from di erent aspects including detailed frame contents, speech contents and general video contents. Such example indicates that a video usually\nTable 1: Examples of some data-driven topicswith their representativewords and their co-occurrencewith prede ned category tags.\ntopic id #videos co-occurrence with prede ned categories representative words 1 182 music:43%, people:21% people dancing group girls dance women music video dances 3 281 music:50% stage man playing singing band performing song guitar music 13 439 food:63%, cooking:29% food cooking kitchen dish person bowl ingredients pan preparing 8 864 news:15%, edu:14%, sci:13% man talking talks guy speaking person si ing giving camera\ncontains several topics, which are re ected in its multiple diverse groundtruth captions. e above observation aligns with the generation process of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model [22]: 1. the model rst draws a topic index zdi ∼ Multinomial(θd ) from the video, where θd ∼ Dirichlet(α),d = 1, ...,D. 2. the model draws the observed word wi j ∼ Multinomial(βzdi ) from the selected topic, where βk ∼ Dirichlet(η),k = 1...K . Here, we group the multiple groundtruth captions of a video into one document to mine latent topics from the training data. Stopwords are removed and the the bag-of-words representation is used as our document feature."

      "text" : "We study the relation between the prede ned topics and data-driven topics based on their co-occurrence in videos. For each video in the training set, we have its corresponding prede ned category tag and the data-driven topic distribution calculated from the LDA model. To simplify the calculation of co-occurrence, we assign each video with the most likely topic. Table 1 shows co-occurrence between some prede ned categories and data-driven topics. We can see that some prede ned categories are split into di erent topics. For example, the music category is mainly separated into topic 1 of dancing and topic 3 of singing. Some content similar categories are combined together as one topic, i.e. topic 13 consisting of food and cooking categories. And categories that are di erent but express similar content are also merged. For example, news, educations and science categories are merged into one as most of the descriptions under these categories are “somebody is talking about something”. In summary, it shows that the data-driven topics are quite promising and re ect video content distributions be er than prede ned categories."

We extract features from the C3D model [26] pretrained on the Sports-1M dataset. We extract activations from the last 3D convolution layer and max-pooling them along the spatial dimension (width and height) to obtain video features with dimensionality of 512. We then applied l2-norm on the C3D features.\nAural modality: Aural modality is complementary to visual modalities, especially for distinguishing scenes or events. We extract the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coe cients (MFCCs) [27] as the basic low-level descriptors. Two encoding strategies, Bag-of-AudioWords [28] and Fisher Vector [29], are used to aggregate MFCC frames into one video-level feature vector, with dimensionality of 1024 and 624 respectively.\nSpeech modality: Speech modality provides semantic topics and content details of the video. We use the IBM Watson API [30] for speech recognition. Since the backgrounds of the videos are noisy, we clean the speech transcriptions by removing transcriptions with less than 10 words and out-of-vocabulary words based on the training caption vocabulary. Only about half portion of the videos contain speech transcriptions a erwards and a certain amount of transcription errors still exist in the transcriptions. We use the bag-of-words representation as the speech modality feature."

      "text" : "For prede ned topics, i.e. category tag, we train a standard one hidden layer neural network with cross-entropy loss to predict. e inputs of this neural network are the multimodal features as described in the section 4.1.\nFor data-driven topics, as there is no direct topic class label, we leverage the topic distribution generated from the topic mining LDA model in section 3.2. We take a teacher-student learning perspective [6] to train the data-driven topic prediction model. To be speci c, the topic mining LDA model is viewed as the teacher and the topic prediction model is viewed as the student. e teacher, topic mining model, is trained in unsupervised style and it generates label, i.e. topic, to guide the student, topic prediction model, to learn. First, we design two topic prediction models: one is general for all multimodal features and the other one is dedicated to speech modality features. en, we ensemble predictions from these two models by averaging to get the nal prediction.\nGeneral Multimodal Topic Prediction Model: is model is designed to predict topic from the video content using all the multimodal features. In the teacher-student perspective, the student model usually learns the output distribution on labels, i.e. dark knowledge [31], rather than output label from the teacher model. Following this way, we choose to use KL-divergence as our loss function. e formulation of KL-divergence is as follows:\nDKL(P | |Q) = K∑ k=1 Pk loд Pk Qk\n(1)\nwhere P ,Q are the probability distributions of the mined topics and predicted topics respectively. e DKL(P | |Q) is di erentiable and thus can be optimized via back-propagation.\nSpeechDedicatedTopic PredictionModel: As speech modality is very informative but not always available in videos, we build a dedicate topic prediction model using speech features. Di erent from other modality features, the speech text feature is of high dimensionality with noises and is sparse. Instead of using the same architecture of the general multimodal topic prediction model, we design a very di erent architecture for the speech dedicated topic prediction model. We make a simple choice of the architecture: reusing the topic mining model for topic prediction on speech text features. As the representation of speech text features is the same as that of features used in the topic mining model, we don’t need to reinvent the wheel.\nAs to the problem of missing modalities, we only use videos that contain the corresponding speech modality in the speech dedicated topic prediction model. In general multimodal topic prediction model, the features of missing modalities are padded as zeros. In ensembling, predictions of the missing modalities are not considered in the average process."

      "text" : "Suppose we have multiple video-sentence pairs (V , y) in video captioning dataset, where y = {w1, . . . ,wNw } is the sentence with Nw words. Assume the multimodal features of the video arem1, . . . ,mNm , where Nm is the number of modalities, the multimodal encoder is a neural network that fuses the multimodal features into a dense video representation x as follows:\nx =We [m1; . . . ;mNm ] + be (2)\nwhereWe ,be are the parameters in the encoder and [·] denotes the feature concatenation. Since the captioning output is the sequential words, we utilize the LSTM [32] recurrent neural networks as our\nlanguage decoder: ht = f (ht−1,wt−1;θd ) for t = 1, . . . ,Nw (3)\nwhere f is the LSTM update function, ht is the state of LSTM and θd is the parameter in LSTM. We initialize h0 as x to condition on the video representation and w0 as the sentence start symbol. en the probability of the correct word conditioned on the video content and previous words can be expressed as:\nPr(wt |x,w0, . . . ,wt−1) = So max(Wdht + bd ) (4) whereWd ,bd are parameters. e objective function is to maximize the log likelihood of the correct description:\nlog Pr(y|x) = Nw∑ t=1 log Pr(wt |x,w0, . . . ,wt−1) (5)\nWe denote the predicted topics in Section 4.2 as z ∈ RK , where K is the number of topics. In order to e ectively exploit the topics z for video captioning, we propose the novel topic-guided model (TGM), and a series of simple yet strong caption models with topic guidance for comparison, called TCE, TCD and TEAD/TEMD for short. Detailed descriptions of these models are as follows.\nTopic Concatenation in Encoder (TCE): We fuse the topic distribution z together with multimodal features in the encoder as the topic-aware video representation x:\nx =We ([m1; . . . ;mNm ; z]) + be (6) e LSTM decoder then generates video description conditioning on the new topic-aware representation x.\nTopic Concatenation in Decoder (TCD): In the TCE model, the topic information only occurs at the rst step in the decoder, which could easily make the topic guidance “dri away”. To enhance the topic guidance, we concatenate the topic distribution z with the word embeddingwt−1 as the input to the LSTM every step, which is similar to the gLSTM proposed in [33]:\nht = f (ht−1, [wt−1; z];θd ) (7) e extra input of topic z can guide the language decoder to generate words related to the topic in every step.\nTopic EmbeddingAddition/Multiplication inDecoder (TEAD/TEMD): To generate a more comparable representation for the topic representation z compared to the word embedding, we embed each topic into a latent vector space with the same dimensionality as the word embedding:\nze =Wzz + bz (8) whereWz ,bz are topic embedding parameters. We perform addition or multiplication on the topic embedding and word embedding to generate the topic-aware input feature for the language decoder every step, which are expressed as:\nTEAD : ht = f (ht−1,wt−1 ⊕ ze ;θd ) (9) TEMD : ht = f (ht−1,wt−1 ze ;θd ) (10)\nwhere ⊕, are element-wise addition and multiplication respectively.\nTopic-GuidedModel (TGM): e above TCD and TEAD/TEMD models only implicitly using the topic information as the global guidance, which modify the inputs to the language decoder in every step and cannot take into account of the overall expressions\nwithin the topic. Inspired by Gan et al. [12], therefore, we further propose the topic-guided model (TGM) that explicitly functions as an ensemble of topic-aware language decoders to capture di erent sentence distributions for each topic. e structure of the TGM is shown in the right side in Figure 2, which can automatically modify the weight matrices in LSTM according to the topic distribution z.\nLet us take one of weight matrices in the LSTM as an example, and other parameters in LSTM cell are alike. We de ne weight Wτ ∈ Rnh×nw×K , where nh is the number of hidden units and nw is the dimension of word embedding. e Wτ can be viewed as the ensemble of K topic-speci c LSTM weight matrices. e topic-related weight matrixW (z) ∈ Rnh×nw can be speci ed as\nW (z) = K∑ k=1 zkWτ [k] (11)\nwhere zk is the k-th topic in z; Wτ [k] denote the k-th matrix of Wτ . In this way, the video topic z can automatically generate its corresponding LSTM decoders to produce the topic-oriented video descriptions. However, the parameters are increasing with K which may result in over- ing easily. So the ideas in [34] are used to share parameters by factorizingW (z) as follows:\nW (z) =Wa · diaд(Wbz) ·Wc (12)\nwhere Wa ∈ Rnh×nf , Wb ∈ Rnf ×K and Wc ∈ Rnf ×nw . nf is the number of factors. Wa andWc are shared among all topics, while Wb can be viewed as the latent topic embedding."

Since the data-driven topics on testing set are predicted as shown in Figure 5, we also use the predicted category tags for a fair comparison. e guidance from predicted data-driven topics outperforms that from the predicted category tags on all four evaluation metrics, and the Student’s t-test shows the improvement is signi cant with p-value< 0.002.

As shown in Table 6, the number of topics 20 achieves the best performance, which is the balance between the topic prediction performance and the topic guidance performance. When there is fewer number of topics, the accuracy of topic prediction is higher but it provides less guidance to generate video descriptions. When there is more number of topics, though the topic guidance becomes strong, the captioning performance su ers from the low topic prediction accuracy.

    "abstractText" : "Generating video descriptions in natural language (a.k.a. video captioning) is a more challenging task than image captioning as the videos are intrinsically more complicated than images in two aspects. First, videos cover a broader range of topics, such as news, music, sports and so on. Second, multiple topics could coexist in the same video. In this paper, we propose a novel caption model, topic-guided model (TGM), to generate topic-oriented descriptions for videos in the wild via exploiting topic information. In addition to predened topics, i.e., category tags crawled from the web, we also mine topics in a data-driven way based on training captions by an unsupervised topic mining model. We show that data-driven topics reect a beer topic schema than the predened topics. As for testing video topic prediction, we treat the topic mining model as teacher to train the student, the topic prediction model, by utilizing the full multi-modalities in the video especially the speech modality. We propose a series of caption models to exploit topic guidance, including implicitly using the topics as input features to generate words related to the topic and explicitly modifying the weights in the decoder with topics to function as an ensemble of topic-aware language decoders. Our comprehensive experimental results on the current largest video caption dataset MSR-VTT prove the eectiveness of our topic-guided model, which signicantly surpasses the winning performance in the 2016 MSR video to language challenge.",
