      "text" : "Due to the excessiveness of data, there is a need of automatic summarizer which will be capable to summarize the data especially textual data in original document without losing any critical purposes. Text summarization is emerged as an important research area in recent past. In this regard, review of existing work on text summarization process is useful for carrying out further research. In this paper, recent literature on automatic keyword extraction and text summarization are presented since text summarization process is highly depend on keyword extraction. This literature includes the discussion about different methodology used for keyword extraction and text summarization. It also discusses about different databases used for text summarization in several domains along with evaluation matrices.

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "In the era of internet, plethora of online information are\nfreely available for readers in the form of e-Newspapers,\njournal articles, technical reports, transcription dialogues etc.\nThere are huge number of documents available in above\ndigital media and extracting only relevant information from all\nthese media is a tedious job for the individuals in stipulated\ntime. There is a need for an automated system that can extract\nonly relevant information from these data sources. To achieve\nthis, one need to mine the text from the documents. Text\nmining is the process of extracting large quantities of text to\nderive high-quality information. Text mining deploys some of\nthe techniques of natural language processing (NLP) such as\nparts-of-speech (POS) tagging, parsing, N-grams,\ntokenization, etc., to perform the text analysis. It includes\ntasks like automatic keyword extraction and text\nsummarization.\nAutomatic keyword extraction is the process of selecting\nwords and phrases from the text document that can at best\nproject the core sentiment of the document without any human\nintervention depending on the model [1]. The target of\nautomatic keyword extraction is the application of the power\nand speed of current computation abilities to the problem of\naccess and recovery, stressing upon information organization\nwithout the added costs of human annotators.\nSummarization is a process where the most salient features of\na text are extracted and compiled into a short abstract of the\noriginal document [2]. According to Mani and Maybury [3],\ntext summarization is the process of distilling the most\nimportant information from a text to produce an abridged\nversion for a particular task and user. Summaries are usually\naround 17\\% of the original text and yet contain everything\nthat could have been learned from reading the original article\n[4]. In the wake of big data analysis, summarization is an\nefficient and powerful technique to give a glimpse of the\nwhole data. The text summarization can be achieved in two\nways namely, abstractive summary and extractive summary.\nThe abstractive summary is a topic under tremendous\nresearch; however, no standard algorithm has been achieved\nyet. These summaries are derived from learning what was\nexpressed in the article and then converting it into a form\nexpressed by the computer. It resembles how a human would\nsummarize an article after reading it. Whereas, extractive\nsummary extract details from the original article itself and\npresent it to the reader.\nIn this paper, reviewed the recent literature on automatic keyword extraction and text summarization. The valuable keywords extraction is the primary phase of text summarization. Therefore, in this literature, we focused on both the techniques. In keyword extraction, the literature discussed about different methodologies used for keyword extraction process and what algorithms used under each methodology as shown in Figure 1. It also discussed about different domains in which keyword extraction algorithms applied. Similarly, in the process of text summarization, literature covers all the possible process of text summarization such as document types (single or multi), summary types (generic or query based), techniques (supervised or unsupervised), characteristics of summary (abstractive or extractive), etc. Further, it includes all the possible methodologies for text summarization as shown in Figure 3. This literature also discusses about different databases used for text summarization such as DUC, TAC, MEDLINE, etc. along with differnt evaluation matrices such as precision, recall, and ROUGE series. Finally, it discusses briefly about issues and research challenges faced by researchers followed by future direction of text summarization. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review on automatic keyword extraction Section 3\npresents a review on text summarization process. A review on\nautomatic text summarization methologies are given in\nSection 4. The details about different databases are described\nin Section 5. Section 6 explains about evaluation matrices for\ntext summarization. Finally, the conclusion with future\ndirection is drawn in Section 7."

      "heading" : "2 AUTOMATIC KEYWORD EXTRACTION: A REVIEW",
      "text" : "On the premise of past work done towards automatic keyword extraction from the text for its summarization, extraction systems can be classified into four classes, namely, simple statistical approach, linguistics approach, machine learning approach, and hybrid approaches [1] as soon in Figure 1."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.1 Simple Statistical Approach",
      "text" : "These strategies are rough, simplistic and have a tendency to\nhave no training sets. They concentrate on statistics got from\nnon-linguistic features of the document, for example, the\nposition of a word inside the document, the term frequency,\nand inverse document frequency. These insights are later used\nto build up a list of keywords. Cohen [15], utilized n-gram\nstatistical data to discover the keyword inside the document\nautomatically. Other techniques in- side this class incorporate\nword frequency, term frequency (TF) [16] or term frequency-\ninverse document frequency (TF-IDF) [17], word co-\noccurrences [18], and PAT-tree [19]. The most essential of\nthem is term frequency. In these strategies, the frequency of\noccurrence is the main criteria that choose whether a word is a\nkeyword or not. It is extremely unrefined and tends to give\nvery unseemly results. An improvement of this strategy is the\nTF-IDF, which also takes the frequency of occurrence of a\nword as the model to choose a keyword or not. Similarly,\nword co-occurrence methods manage statistical information\nabout the number of times a word has happened and the\nnumber of times it has happened with another word. This\nstatistical information is then used to compute support and\nconfidence of the words. Apriori technique is then used to\ninfer the keywords."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.2 Linguistics Approach",
      "text" : "This approach utilizes the linguistic features of the words for keyword detection and extraction in text documents. It incorporates the lexical analysis [20], syntactic analysis [21], discourse analysis [22], etc. The resources used for lexical analysis are an electronic dictionary, tree tagger, WordNet, ngrams, POS pattern, etc. Similarly, noun phrase (NP), chunks (Parsing) are used as resources for syntactic analysis."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.3 Machine Learning Approach",
      "text" : "Keyword extraction can also be seen as a learning problem.\nThis approach requires manually annotated training data and\ntraining models. Hidden Markov model [23], support vector\nmachine (SVM) [24], naive Bayes (NB) [25], bagging [21],\netc. are commonly used training models in these approaches.\nIn the second phase, the document whose keywords are to be\nextracted is given as inputs to the model, which then extracts\nthe keywords that best fit the model’s training. One of the\nmost famous algorithms in this approach is the keyword\nextraction algorithm (KEA) [26]. In this approach, the article\nis first converted into a graph where each word is treated as a\nnode, and whenever two words appear in the same sentence,\nthe nodes are connected with an edge for each time they\nappear together. Then the number of edges connecting the\nvertices are converted into scores and are clustered\naccordingly. The cluster heads are treated as keywords.\nBayesian algorithms use the Bayes classifier to classify the\nword into two categories: keyword or not a keyword\ndepending on how it is trained. GenEx [27] is another tool in\nthis approach."

The complete structure of classification about evaluation measure for text summarization is given in Figure 4. To compare the performances, one used the ROUGE evaluation software package, which compares various summary results from several summarization methods with summaries generated by humans. ROUGE has been applied by the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) for performance evaluation. ROUGE includes five automatic evaluation methods, ROUGEN, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, ROUGE-S, and ROUGE-SU [24]. Each method estimates recall, precision, and f-measure between experts’ reference summaries and candidate summaries of the proposed system. ROUGE-N uses the n-gram recall between a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries.\nBased on the characterization of text summarization process as shown in Figure 2, classifications of text summarization approaches as shown in Figure 3, databases as discussed in Section 3 and performance evaluation matrices as shown in Figure 4, we bring a consolidated summary of previous studies in text summarization and is shown in Table 4.

    "abstractText" : "In recent times, data is growing rapidly in every domain such as news, social media, banking, education, etc. Due to the excessiveness of data, there is a need of automatic summarizer which will be capable to summarize the data especially textual data in original document without losing any critical purposes. Text summarization is emerged as an important research area in recent past. In this regard, review of existing work on text summarization process is useful for carrying out further research. In this paper, recent literature on automatic keyword extraction and text summarization are presented since text summarization process is highly depend on keyword extraction. This literature includes the discussion about different methodology used for keyword extraction and text summarization. It also discusses about different databases used for text summarization in several domains along with evaluation matrices. Finally, it discusses briefly about issues and research challenges faced by researchers along with future direction.",
