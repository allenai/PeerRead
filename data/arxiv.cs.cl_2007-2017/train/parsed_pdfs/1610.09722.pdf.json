Unlike previous machine reading work, we assume that while most target values will occur frequently in most clusters, they may also be missing or incorrect.\nWe introduce a novel neural architecture to explicitly model the noisy nature of the data and to deal with these aforementioned learning issues. Our models are trained end-to-end and achieve an improvement of more than 12.1 F1 over previous work, despite using far less linguistic annotation. We apply factor graph constraints to promote more coherent event analyses, with belief propagation inference formulated within the transitions of a recurrent neural network. We show this technique additionally improves maximum F1 by up to 2.8 points, resulting in a relative improvement of 50% over the previous state-of-the-art."

      "text" : "Recent work in the area of machine reading has focused on learning in a scenario with perfect in-\nformation. Whether identifying target entities for simple cloze style queries (Hermann et al., 2015; Miao et al., 2015), or reasoning over short passages of artificially generated text (Weston et al., 2015), short stories (Richardson et al., 2013), or children’s stories (Hill et al., 2015), these systems all assume that the corresponding text is the unique source of information necessary for answering the query – one that not only contains the answer, but does not contain misleading or otherwise contradictory information.\nFor more practical question answering, where an information retrieval (IR) component must first fetch the set of relevant passages, the text sources will be less reliable and this assumption must be discarded. Text sources may vary in terms of their integrity (whether or not they are intentionally misleading or unreliable), their accuracy (as in the case of news events, where a truthful but outdated article may contain incorrect information), or their relevance to the query. These characteristics necessitate not only the creation of high-precision readers, but also the development of effective strategies for aggregating conflicting stories into a single cohesive account of the event.\nAdditionally, while many question answering systems are designed to extract a single answer to a single query, a user may wish to understand many aspects of a single entity or event. In machine reading, this is akin to pairing each text passage with multiple queries. Modeling each query as an independent prediction can lead to analyses that are incoherent, motivating the need to model the dependencies between queries.\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n09 72\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\n0 O\nct 2\n01 6\nAt least 28 dead as Flight-117 out of Chicago crashed with 63 passengers aboard.\nMarch 10th. ambient temp. 28 C. visibility nominal.\nFlight-117 crash. 22 dead.d1\nd2\nd3\nd4\nd5\nDisaster over Atlanta tonight as Flight-117 burst into flames, 28 confirmed dead.\nFlight-456 crashed outside of Dallas last year killing all 48 passengers on board.\nLabels: Fatalities: 28 Passengers: 63\nMention-level Scores (4 values per document, 5 documents)\nCluster-level Scores via Aggregation (4 values per cluster, 1 cluster)\ndocuments values\nsc or\nes\nsc or\nes\n“Flight 117”\nIR\nGold Data\nDistantly Supervised Data\nTarget Flight:\ncorrect otherkey:\nFigure 1: An example news cluster.

We propose a modular architecture which decomposes the task into three fundamental sub-problems: (1) representation & scoring, (2) aggregation, and (3) global constraints.

      "text" : "Effective aggregation techniques can be crucial for identifying accurate information from noisy sources. Figure 1 depicts an example of our problem scenario. An IR component fetches sev-\neral documents based on the query, and sample sentences are shown for each document. The goal is to extract the correct value, of which there may be many mentions in the text, for each slot. Sentences in d1 express a target slot, the number of fatalities, but the mention corresponds to an incorrect value. This is a common mistake in early news reports. Documents d3 and d4 also express this slot, and with mentions of the correct value, but with less certainty.\nA model which focuses on a single highscoring mention, at the expense of breadth, will make an incorrect prediction. In comparison, a model which learns to correctly accumulate evidence for each value across multiple mentions over the entire cluster can identify the correct information, circumventing this problem. Figure 1 (bottom) shows how this pooling of evidence can produce the correct cluster-level prediction."

Representation and Scoring, in which a task-specific encoding is generated for each mention, and scored with respect to each slot.\n2. Aggregation, in which the scores of each value’s mentions are aggregated to produce a single score for each slot-value pair.\n3. Constraint, in which we model additional dependencies between pairs of values, and between pairs of slots, to promote more sensible interpretations of the event as a whole.\nWe begin by defining terminology. A news cluster c is a set of documents, {d1, ..., d|c|} ∈ c, where each document is described by a sequence of words, d = (w1, ..., w|d|). A mention is an occurrence of a value in its textual context. For each value v ∈ V , there are potentially many mentions of v in the cluster, defined as m ∈ M(v). These have been annotated in the data using Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014)."

This representation functions as a general “reading” or encoding of the mention, irrespective of the type of slots for which it will later be considered. This differs from some previous machine reading research where the model provides a query-specific reading of the document, or reads the document multiple times when answering a single query (Hermann et al., 2015). As in previous work, an embedding of a mention’s context serves as its representation.\nWe construct an embedding matrix E ∈ Re×n, using pre-trained word embeddings, where e is the dimensionality of the embeddings and n the number of words in the cluster. These are held fixed during training. All mentions are masked and receive the same one-hot vector in place of a pretrained embedding. From this matrix we embed the context using a two-layer convolutional\nneural network (CNN), with a detailed discussion of the architecture parameters provided in Section 4. CNNs have been used in a similar manner for a number of information extraction and classification tasks (Kim, 2014; Zeng et al., 2015) and are capable of producing rich sentence representations (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014).1"

We create a separate embedding, πs ∈ Rr, for each slot s, and utilize it to attend over all mentions in the cluster as follows:\nus = Rπs (1) as = softmax(us) (2)\nφmention(m, s) = a s k(m) (3)\nThe mention-level scores reflect an interpretation of the value’s encoding with respect to the slot.

This assumption does not always hold, and the resulting spurious labels are frequently cited as a source of training noise (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011). However, an aggregation over all mention scores provides a more accurate reflection of how distant supervision labels are applied to the data.\nIf one were to assign a label to each mention and construct a loss using the mention-level scores (φmention) directly, it would recreate the hard labeling of the traditional distant supervision training scenario. Instead, we relax the distant supervision assumption by using a loss on the value-level scores (φvalue), with aggregation to pool beliefs from one to the other. This explicitly models the way in which cluster-wide labels are applied to mentions, and allows for spuriously labeled mentions to receive lower scores, “explaining away” the cluster’s label by assigning a higher score to a mention with a more suitable representation.\nTwo natural choices for this aggregation are max and sum. Formally, under max aggregation the value-level scores for a value v and slot s are computed as:\nφvalue(v, s) = max m∈M(v) φmention(m, s) (4)\nAnd under sum aggregation: φvalue(v, s) = ∑\nm∈M(v)\nφmention(m, s) (5)\nIf the most clearly expressed mentions correspond to correct values, max aggregation can be an effective strategy (Riedel et al., 2010). If the data set is noisy with numerous spurious mentions, a sum aggregation favoring values which are expressed both clearly and frequently may be the more appropriate choice."

      "text" : "The aforementioned aggregation methods combine mention-level scores uniformly, but for many domains one may have prior knowledge regarding which mentions should more heavily\ncontribute to the aggregate score. It is straightforward to augment the proposed aggregation methods with a separate weight αm for each mention m to create, for instance, a weighted sum aggregation:\nφvalue(v, s) = ∑\nm∈M(v)\nαm · φmention(m, s) (6)\nThese weights may be learned from data, or they may be heuristically defined based on a priori beliefs. Here we present two such heuristic methods.\nTopic-based Aggregation News articles naturally deviate from the topical event, often including comparisons to related events, and summaries of past incidents. Any such instance introduces additional noise into the system, as the contexts of topical and nontopical mention are often similar. Weighted aggregation provides a natural foothold for incorporating topicality into the model.\nWe assign aggregation weights heuristically with respect to a simple model of discourse. We assume every document begins on topic, and remains so until a sentence mentions a nontopical flight number. This and all successive sentences are considered nontopical, until a sentence reintroduces the topical flight. Mentions in topical sentences receive aggregation weights of αm = 1.0, and those in non-topical sentences receive weights of αm = 0.0, removing them from consideration completely.\nDate-based Aggregation In the aftermath of a momentous event, news outlets scramble to release articles, often at the expense of providing accurate information.\nWe hypothesize that the earliest articles in each cluster are the most likely to contain misinformation, which we explore via a measure of information content. We define the information content of an article as the number of correct values which it mentions. Using this measure, we fit a skewed Gaussian distribution over the ordered news articles, assigning αm = ic(d), ∀m ∈ d, where ic(d) is the smoothed information content of d as drawn from the Gaussian."

      "heading" : "2.2.3 Known Unknowns",
      "text" : "A difficult machine reading problem unique to noisy text sources, where the correct values may not be present in the cluster, is determining whether to predict any value at all. A common solution for handling such missing values is the use of a threshold, below which the model returns null. However, even a separate threshold for each slot would not fully capture the nature of the problem.\nDetermining whether a value is missing is a trade-off between two factors: (1) how strongly the mention-level scores support a non-null answer, and (2) how much general information regarding that event and that slot is given. We incorporate both factors by extending the definition of R and its use in Eq. 1–Eq. 3 to include not only mentions, but all words. Each nonmention word is treated as a mention of the null value:\nφvalue(v = null, s) = ∑ d∈c ∑ w∈{d\\M} φmention(w, s)\n(7)\nwhere M is the set of mentions. The resulting null score varies according to both the cluster size and its content. Smaller clusters with fewer documents require less evidence to predict a non-null value, while larger clusters must accumulate more evidence for a particular candidate or a null value will be proposed instead.\nThe exact words contained in the cluster also have an effect. For example, clusters with numerous mentions of killed, died, dead, will have a higher φvalue(v = null, s =Fatalities), requiring the model to be more confident in its answer for that slot during training. Additionally, this provides a mechanism for driving down φmention(w, s) when w is not strongly associated with s."

Variables maintain beliefs over their values, and factors specify scores over configurations of these values for the variables they neighbor.\nWe constrain model output by applying a factor graph model to the φvalue scores it produces. The slot s taking the value v is represented in the factor graph by a Boolean variable Xv,s. Each Xv,s is connected to a local factor uv,s whose initial potential is derived from φvalue(v, s). A combinatorial logic factor, Exactly-1(Smith and Eisner, 2008), is (1) created for each slot, connected across all values, and (2) created for each value, connected across all slots. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Each Exactly-1 factor provides a hard constraint over neighboring Boolean variables requiring exactly one variable’s value to be true, therefore diminishing the possibility of duplicate predictions during inference.\nInference The resulting graph contains cycles, preventing the use of exact message passing inference. We instead treat an RNN as implementing loopy belief propagation (LBP), an iterative approximate message passing inference algorithm. The hidden state of the RNN is the set of variable beliefs, and each round of message updates corresponds to one iteration of LBP, or one recurrence in the RNN.\nThere are two types of messages: messages from variables to factors and messages from factors to variables. The message that a variable X sends to a factor f (denoted µX→f ) is defined recursively w.r.t. to incoming messages from its neighbors n(X) as follows:\nµX→f = ∏\nf ′∈n(X)6=f\nµf ′→X (8)\nand conveys the information “My other neighbors jointly suggest I have the posterior distribution µv→u(v) over my values.” In our RNN formulation of message passing the initial outgoing message for a variable Xv,s to its neighboring Exactly-1 factors is:\nµXv,s→f = sigmoid(φvalue(v, s)) (9)\nwhere the sigmoid moves the scores into probability space.\nA message from an Exactly-1 factor to its neighboring variables is calculated as:\n¬µX→f = 1.0− µX→f (10) Z = ∏ X ¬µX→f (11)\nµExactly-1→X = Z\n¬µX→f (12)\nAll subsequent LBP iterations compute variable messages as in Eq. 8, incorporating the out-going factor beliefs of the previous iteration."

Rather, it is attributable to training end-to-end with aggregation and a cluster-level loss function.\nAggregation Results With respect to aggregation, sum-based methods consistently outperform their max counterparts, indicating that exploiting the redundancy of information in news clusters is beneficial to the task. The topicbased aggregation is statistically significant im-\nprovement over standard sum aggregation (p ≤ 0.0215), and produces the highest performing unconstrained system.\nDate-based aggregation did not yield a statistically significant improvement over sum aggregation. We hypothesize that the method is sound, but accurate datelines could only be extracted for 31 % documents. We did not modify the aggregation weights (α(m) = 1.0) for the remaining documents, minimizing the effect of this approach.\nThe EE-AS Reader has the lowest overall performance, which one can attribute to pooling evidence in a manner that is poorly suited to this problem domain.

The improvements persist\nthroughout training, as shown in Figure 3.\nAdditional iterations reduce performance. This effect is largely due to the constraint assumption not holding absolutely in the data. For instance, multiple slots can have the null value, and zero is common value for a number of slots. Running the constraint inference for a single iteration encourages a 1-to-1 mapping from values to slots, but it does not prohibit it.

We belief a richer representation which combines the generalization of CNNs with the discrete signal of ngram features (Lei et al., 2015) may solve some of these issues.\nFour of the remaining errors appear to be due to aggregation errors. Specifically, the occurrence of a particular punctuation mark with far greater than average frequency resulted in it being predicted for three slots. While these could be filtered out, a more general solution may be to build a representation based on the actual mention (“Ryanair”), in addition to its context. This may reduce the scores of these mentions\nto such an extent that they are removed from consideration.\nTable 3 shows the accuracy of the model on each slot type. The model is struggles with predicting the Injuries and Survivors slots. The nature of news media leads these slots to be discussed less frequently, with their mentions often embedded more deeply in the document, or expressed textually. For instance, it is common to express s=Survivors, v = 0 as “no survivors”, but it is impossible to predict a 0 value in this case, under the current problem definition."

However, in addition to the many modeling choices we propose, the data sets used in existing work were not linked to specific events. The same denoising nature of these tasks has clear implications for automated factchecking (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014), but no comparable models currently exist.\nIn contrast, the the IDEST system of Krause et al. (2015) is an example of previous work which uses automatically constructed clusters of news articles in order to train an event embedding model. However, the focus of IDEST is to improve event clustering, not information\nextraction, which is reflected in its comparatively simple and heuristically-driven extraction method.\nAttention and Aggregation in Machine Reading In terms of reading methodology, our scoring method is a slot-specific interpretation of the attentive reader (Hermann et al., 2015), and our sum aggregation is closelyrelated to Kadlec et al. (2016), with differences described previously in Sec. 4.1. A similar method is found in the entailment model of Parikh et al. (2016), where alignment scores (between a premise and a hypothesis) are generated via attention and summed. Recent machine reading models have used an iterative attention to refine model predictions (Sordoni et al., 2016). Such methods play a role similar to our factor graph constraint, though they incorporate no prior knowledge.\nExtensions to Distant Supervision Aggregation in our framework is a means to weaken strong distant supervision assumptions, and, unlike Mintz et al. (2009), it does not assume that each mention-level occurrence of a value must express the given relation. In this respect, it exists as a fully-differentiable analog to the work of Hoffmann et al. (2011), and closely related to the “expressed at least once” constraint of Riedel et al. (2010). Both allow the model to ignore mislabeled instances in certain circumstances. Recently, Lin et al. (2016) have also proposed the use of neural mechanisms to reduce the effect of mislabeled instances, using attention to select the most useful sentences for\nrelation extraction, as we use attention to select the most informative mentions."

If an element appears repeatedly throughout the input, each occurrence is in competition not only with other elements, but also with its duplicates.\nHere the scoring and aggregation steps of our proposed architecture can together be viewed as a pointer network where there is a redundancy in the input which respects an underlying grouping.

    "abstractText" : "In order to extract event information from text, a machine reading model must learn to accurately read and interpret the ways in which that information is expressed. But it must also, as the human reader must, aggregate numerous individual value hypotheses into a single coherent global analysis, applying global constraints which reflect prior knowledge of the domain. In this work we focus on the task of extracting plane crash event information from clusters of related news articles whose labels are derived via distant supervision. Unlike previous machine reading work, we assume that while most target values will occur frequently in most clusters, they may also be missing or incorrect. We introduce a novel neural architecture to explicitly model the noisy nature of the data and to deal with these aforementioned learning issues. Our models are trained end-to-end and achieve an improvement of more than 12.1 F1 over previous work, despite using far less linguistic annotation. We apply factor graph constraints to promote more coherent event analyses, with belief propagation inference formulated within the transitions of a recurrent neural network. We show this technique additionally improves maximum F1 by up to 2.8 points, resulting in a relative improvement of 50% over the previous state-of-the-art.",
