      "text" : "In statistical machine translation, the language model, translation model, and reordering model are the three most important components. Among these models, the reordering model plays an important role in phrase-based machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003), and it still remains a major challenge in current study.\nIn recent years, various phrase reordering methods have been proposed for phrase-based SMT systems, which can be classified into two broad categories:\n(1) Distance-based RM: Penalize phrase displacements with respect to the degree of non-monotonicity (Koehn et al., 2003). (2) Lexicalized RM: Conditions reordering probabilities on current phrase pairs. According to the orientation determinants, lexicalized reordering model can further be classified into word-based RM (Tillman, 2004), phrase-based RM (Koehn et al., 2007), and hierarchical phrase-based RM (Galley and Manning, 2008).\nFurthermore, some researchers proposed a reordering model that conditions both current and previous phrase pairs by utilizing recursive auto-encoders (Li et al., 2014), which is applied into decoding step.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel neural reordering feature by including longer context for predicting orientations. We utilize a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), and directly models word pairs to predict its most probable orientation. Experimental results on NIST OpenMT12 Arabic-English and Chinese-English translation show that our neural reordering model achieves significant improvements over various baselines via 1000-best rescoring."

      "text" : "Recently, various neural network models have been applied into machine translation. Feed-forward neural language model was first proposed by Bengio et al. (2003), which was a breakthrough in language modeling. Mikolov et al. (2011) proposed to use recurrent neural network in language modeling, which can include much longer context history for predicting next word. Experimental results show that RNNbased language model significantly outperforms standard feed-forward language model.\nDevlin et al. (2014) proposed a neural network joint model (NNJM) by conditioning both source and target language context for target word predicting. Though the network architecture is a simple feedforward neural network, the results have shown significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.\nSundermeyer et al. (2014) also put forward a neural translation model, by utilizing LSTM-based RNN and Bidirectional RNN. In bidirectional RNNs, the target word is conditioned on not only the history but also future source context, which forms a full source sentence for predicting target words.\nLi et al. (2013) proposed to use a recursive auto-encoder (RAE) to map each phrase pairs into continuous vectors, and handle reordering problems with a classifier. Also, they suggested that by both including current and previous phrase pairs to determine the phrase orientations could achieve further improvements in accuracy (Li et al., 2014).\nBy far, we have noticed that this is the first time to use LSTM-RNN in reordering model. We could include much longer context information to determine phrase orientations using RNN architecture. Furthermore, by utilizing the LSTM layer, the network is able to capture much longer range dependencies than standard RNNs.\nBecause we need to record fixed history information in decoding step, we only utilize LSTM-RNN reordering model as a feature in 1000-best rescoring step. As word alignments are known after generating n-best list, it is possible to use LSTM-RNN reordering model to score each hypothesis."

We will take LR orientation for explanations, while other orientation types (MSD, MSLR) can be induced similarly.

Figure 1 shows an example of data processing.\n(1) If current target word is one-to-one alignment, then we can directly induce its orientations (left or right). (2) If current source/target word is one-to-many alignment, then we judge its orientation by considering its first aligned target/source word, and the other aligned target/source words are annotated as “<follow>” reordering type, which means these word pairs inherent the orientation of previous word pair. (3) If current source/target word is not aligned to any target/source words, we introduce a “<null>” token in its opposite side, and annotate this word pair as “<follow>” reordering type."

Then we perform a linear transformation of input layer to a projection layer. We adopt extended-LSTM as our hidden layer implementation, which consists of three gating units, i.e. input, forget and output gates. We omit rather extensive LSTM equations here, which can be found in (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005). The output layer is composed by orientation types. For e.g., in LR condition, the output layer\ncontains two units: “left” and “right” orientation. Finally, we apply softmax function to obtain normalized probabilities of each orientation."

      "text" : "We tested our approach on Arabic-English and Chinese-English translation. The training corpus selected 7M words of high quality parallel training for Arabic and 4M words for Chinese, which is selected from NIST OpenMT12. We used the SAMA tokenizer2 for Arabic word tokenization, and in-house segmenter for Chinese words. The statistics of development and test sets are illustrated in Table 1. All development and test sets have 4 references for each segment.\nThe baseline systems are built with the open-source phrase-based SMT toolkit Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). Word alignment and phrase extraction are done by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) with L0-normalization (Vaswani et al., 2012), and grow-diag-final refinement rule (Koehn et al., 2003). Monolingual part of training data is used to train a 5-gram language model using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002). Parameter tuning is done by K-best MIRA (Cherry and Foster, 2012). For guarantee of result stability, we tune every system 5 times independently, and take the average BLEU score (Clark et al., 2011). The translation quality is evaluated by case-insensitive BLEU-4 metric (Papineni et al., 2002). The statistical significance test is also carried out with paired bootstrap resampling method (Koehn, 2004) with \uD835\uDC5D < 0.001 intervals. Our models are evaluated in a 1000-best rescoring step, and all features in n-best list as well as LSTM-RNN reordering feature are retuned via K-best MIRA algorithm.\nFor neural network training, we use all parallel text in the baseline training. As a trade-off between computational cost and performance, the projection layer and hidden layer are set to 100, which is enough for our task. We use an initial learning rate of 0.01, and trained model for a total of 10 epochs. Input and output vocabulary are set to 100K and 50K respectively, and other words are mapped to a “<UNK>” token."

As we can see that, among various orientation types (LR, MSD, MSLR), our model could give consistent improvements over baseline system. The overall BLEU improvements range from 0.42 to 0.79 for Arabic-English, and 0.31 to 0.72 for Chinese-English. All results are significantly better than baselines (\uD835\uDC5D < 0.001 level). 2 https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010L01\nIn the meantime, we also find that “Left-Right” based orientation methods, such as LR and MSLR, consistently outperform MSD-based orientations. The may caused by non-separability problem, which means that MSD-based methods are vulnerable to the change of context, and weak in resolving reordering ambiguities. Similar conclusion can be found in Li et al. (2014)."

We only show the results of MSLR orientation, which is relatively superior than others according to the results in Section 5.2.\nIn Table 3, we can see that though we add a strong hierarchical phrase based reordering model in the baseline, our model can still bring a maximum gain of 0.59 BLEU score, which suggest that our model is applicable and robust in various circumstances. However, we have noticed that the gains in Ar-En system is relatively greater than that in Zh-En system. This is probably because hierarchical reordering features tend to work better for Chinese words, and thus our model will bring little remedy to its baseline."

Though notable improvements have been made in these areas, the reordering problem still remains a challenge in statistical machine translations. In this paper, we present a novel neural reordering model that directly models word pairs and alignment. By utilizing LSTM recurrent neural networks, much longer context could be learned for reordering prediction. Experimental results on NIST OpenMT12 Arabic-English and Chinese-English 1000-best rescoring task show that our LSTM neural reordering feature is robust and achieves significant improvements over various baseline systems.",
