With massive unlabeled text and quite limited labelled corpus, we propose a semisupervised learning model based on BLSTM neural network. To take advantage of traditional methods in NER such as CRF, we combine transition probability with deep learning in our model. To bridge the gap between label accuracy and F-score of NER, we construct a model which can be directly trained on F-score. When considering the instability of Fscore driven method and meaningful information provided by label accuracy, we propose an integrated method to train on both F-score and label accuracy. Our integrated model yields substantial improvement over previous state-of-the-art result."

      "text" : "With the development of Internet, social media plays an important role in information exchange. The natural language processing tasks on social media are more challenging which draw attention of many researchers (Li and Liu, 2015; Habib and van Keulen, 2015; Radford et al., 2015; Cherry and Guo, 2015). As the foundation of many downstream applications (Weissenborn et al., 2015; Delgado et al., 2014; Hajishirzi et al., 2013) such as information extraction, named entity recognition (NER) deserves more research in prevailing and challenging social media text. NER is a task to identify names in texts and to assign names with particular types (Sun et al., 2009; Sun, 2014; Sun et al., 2014; He and Sun, 2017). It is the informality of social media that discourages accuracy of NER\nsystems. While efforts in English have narrowed the gap between social media and formal domains (Cherry and Guo, 2015), the task in Chinese remains challenging. It is caused by Chinese logographic characters which lack many clues to indicate whether a word is a name, such as capitalization. The scant labelled Chinese social media corpus makes the task more challenging (Neelakantan and Collins, 2015; Skeppstedt, 2014; Liu et al., 2015).\nTo address the problem, one approach is to use the lexical embeddings learnt from massive unlabeled text. To take better advantage of unlabeled text, Peng and Dredze (2015) evaluates three types of embeddings for Chinese text, and shows the effectiveness of positional character embeddings with experiments. Considering the value of word segmentation in Chinese NER, another approach is to construct an integrated model to jointly train learned representations for both predicting word segmentations and NER (Peng and Dredze, 2016).\nHowever, the two above approaches are implemented within CRF model. We construct a semisupervised model based on B-LSTM neural network to learn from the limited labelled corpus by using lexical information provided by massive unlabeled text. To shrink the gap between label accuracy and F-Score, we propose a method to directly train on F-Score rather than label accuracy in our model. In addition, we propose an integrated method to train on both F-Score and label accuracy. Specifically, we make contributions as follows:\n• We propose a method to directly train on FScore rather than label accuracy. In addition,\nwe propose an integrated method to train on both F-Score and label accuracy.\n• We combine transition probability into our BLSTM based max margin neural network to\nform structured output in neural network.\n• We evaluate two methods to use lexical embeddings from unlabeled text in neural net-\nwork."

However, B-LSTM cannot learn sentence level label information. Huang et al. (2015) combine CRF to use sentence level label information. We combine transition probability into our model to gain sentence level label information. To combine transition probability into B-LSTM neural network, we construct a Max Margin Neural Network (MMNN) (Pei et al., 2014) based on B-LSTM. The prediction of label in position t is given as:\nyt = softmax(Why ∗ ht + by) (1)\nwhere Why are the transformation parameters, ht the hidden vector and by the bias parameter. For a input sentence c[1:n] with a label sequence l[1:n], a sentence-level score is then given as:\ns(c[1:n], l[1:n], θ) =\nn∑\nt=1\n(Alt−1lt + fΛ(lt|c[1:n]))\nwherefΛ(lt|c[1:n]) indicates the probability of label lt at position t by the network with parameters Λ, A indicates the matrix of transition probability. In our model, fΛ(lt|c[1:n]) is computed as:\nfΛ(lt|c[1:n]) = −log(yt[lt]) (2)\nWe define a structured margin loss∆(l, l) as Pei et al. (2014):\n∆(l, l) =\nn∑\nj=1\nκ1{lj 6= lj} (3)\nwhere n is the length of setence x, κ is a discount parameter, l a given correct label sequence and l a predicted label sequence. For a given training instance (xi, yi), our predicted label sequence is the label sequence with highest score:\nl∗i = argmax li∈Y (xi) s(xi, li, θ)\nThe label sequence with the highest score can be obtained by carrying out viterbi algorithm. The regularized objective function is as follows:\nJ(θ) = 1\nm\nm∑\ni=1\nqi(θ) + λ\n2 ||θ||2 (4)\nqi(θ) = max li∈Y (xi) (s(xi, li, θ)+∆(li, li))−s(xi, li, θ)\nBy minimizing the object, we can increase the score of correct label sequence l and decrease the score of incorrect label sequence l."

      "heading" : "2.2 F-Score Driven Training Method",
      "text" : "Max Margin training method use structured margin loss ∆(l, l) to describe the difference between the corrected label sequence l and predicted label sequence l. In fact, the structured margin loss ∆(l, l) reflect the loss in label accuracy. Considering the gap between label accuracy and F-Score in NER, we introduce a new training method to train directly on F-Score. To introduce F-Score driven training method, we need to take a look at the subgradient of equation (4):\n∂J ∂θ = 1 m\nm∑\ni=1\n( ∂s(x, lmax, θ)\n∂θ −\n∂s(x, l, θ)\n∂θ ) + λθ\nIn the subgradient, we can know that structured margin loss ∆(l, l) contributes nothing to the subgradient of the regularized objective function J(θ). The margin loss ∆(l, l) serves as a trigger function to conduct the training process of BLSTM based MMNN. We can introduce a new trigger function to guide the training process of neural network. F-Score Trigger Function The main criterion of NER task is F-score. However, high label accuracy does not mean high F-score. For instance, if every named entity’s last character is labeledas O, the label accuracy can be quite high, but the precision, recall and F-score are 0. We use the FScore between corrected label sequence and predicted label sequence as trigger function, which\nBLSTM BLSTM−MMNN Proposal I Proposal II 45\n50\n55\n60\n65\nModel\nF 1−\nS co\nre NAM NOM Overall\n(a) F-Score of the models.\nBLSTM BLSTM−MMNN Proposal I Proposal II 0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\nModel\nT im\ne pe\nr ite\nra tio\nn/ s\n(b) Running time of the models.\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 45\n50\n55\nO ve\nra ll\nF 1−\nsc or\ne\n(c) Overall F1-Score with different values of beta.\ncan conduct the training process to optimize the F-Score of training examples. Our new structured margin loss can be described as:\n∆̃(l, l) = κ ∗ FScore (5)\nwhere FScore is the F-Score between corrected label sequence and predicted label sequence. F-Score and Label Accuracy Trigger Function The F-Score can be quite unstable in some situation. For instance, if there is no named entity in a sentence, F-Score will be always 0 regardless of the predicted label sequence. To take advantage of meaningful information provided by label accuracy, we introduce an integrated trigger function as follows:\n∆̂(l, l) = ∆̃(l, l) + β ∗∆(l, l) (6)\nwhere β is a factor to adjust the weight of label accuracy and F-Score.\nBecause F-Score depends on the whole label sequence, we use beam search to find k label sequences with top sentece-level score s(x, l, θ) and then use trigger function to rerank the k label sequences and select the best."

Both Peng and Dredze (2015) and Peng and Dredze (2016) show the value of word segmentation to Chinese NER in social media. We present two methods to use word segmentation information in neural network model. Character and Position Embeddings To incorporate word segmentation information, we attach every character with its positional tag. This method is to distinguish the same character at different position in the word. We need to word segment the text and learn positional character embeddings from the segmented text.\nCharacter Embeddings and Word Segmentation Features We can treat word segmentation as discrete features in neural network model. The discrete features can be easily incorporated into neural network model (Collobert et al., 2011). We use word embeddings from a LSTM pretrained on MSRA 2006 corpus to initialize the word segmentation features."

      "heading" : "3.3 Results and Analysis",
      "text" : "We evaluate two methods to incorporate word segmentation information. The results of two methods are shown as Table 2. We can see that positional character embeddings perform better in neural network. This is probably because positional character embeddings method can learn word segmentation information from unlabeled text while word segmentation can only use training corpus.\nWe adopt positional character embeddings in our next four models. Our first model is a BLSTM neural network (baseline). To take advantage of traditional model (Chieu and Ng, 2002; Mccallum et al., 2001) such as CRF, we combine transition probability in our B-LSTM based MMNN. We design a F-Score driven training method in our third model F-Score Driven Model I . We propose an integrated training method in our fourth model F-Score Driven Model II .The re-\nsults of models are depicted as Figure 1(a). From the figure, we can know our models perfrom better with little loss in time.\nTable 3 shows results for NER on test sets. In the Table 3, we also show micro F1-score (Overall) and out-of-vocabulary entities (OOV) recall. Peng and Dredze (2016) is the state-of-the-art NER system in Chinese Social media. By comparing the results of B-LSTM model and B-LSTM + MTNNmodel, we can know transition probability is significant for NER. Compared with B-LSTM + MMNN model, F-Score Driven Model I improves the result of named entity with a loss in nominal mention. The integrated training model (F-Score Driven Model II) benefits from both label accuracy and F-Score, which achieves a new state-ofthe-art NER system in Chinese social media. Our integrated model has better performance on named entity and nominal mention.\nTo better understand the impact of the factor β, we show the results of our integrated model with different values of β in Figure 1(c). From Figure 1(c), we can know that β is an important factor for us to balance F-score and accuracy. Our integrated model may help alleviate the influence of noise in NER in Chinese social media."

NER is a task to identify names in texts and to assign names with particular types (Sun et al., 2009; Sun, 2014; Sun et al., 2014; He and Sun, 2017). It is the informality of social media that discourages accuracy of NER systems. While efforts in English have narrowed the gap between social media and formal domains (Cherry and Guo, 2015), the task in Chinese remains challenging. It is caused by Chinese logographic characters which lack many clues to indicate whether a word is a name, such as capitalization. The scant labelled Chinese social media corpus makes the task more challenging (Neelakantan and Collins, 2015; Skeppstedt, 2014; Liu et al., 2015). To address the problem, one approach is to use the lexical embeddings learnt from massive unlabeled text. To take better advantage of unlabeled text, Peng and Dredze (2015) evaluates three types of embeddings for Chinese text, and shows the effectiveness of positional character embeddings with experiments.",

With massive unlabeled text and quite limited labelled corpus, we propose a semisupervised learning model based on BLSTM neural network. To take advantage of traditional methods in NER such as CRF, we combine transition probability with deep learning in our model. To bridge the gap between label accuracy and F-score of NER, we construct a model which can be directly trained on F-score. When considering the instability of Fscore driven method and meaningful information provided by label accuracy, we propose an integrated method to train on both F-score and label accuracy. Our integrated model yields substantial improvement over previous state-of-the-art result.",
