      "text" : "As Intensive Care Units (ICUs) play an increasing role in acute healthcare delivery (Vincent, 2013), clinicians must anticipate patient care needs in a fast-paced, data-overloaded setting. The secondary analysis of healthcare data is a critical step toward improving modern healthcare, as it affords the study of care in the real care settings and patient populations. The widespread availability of electronic healthcare data (Charles et al., 2013; Jamoom E and E, 2016) allows new investigations into evidence-based decision support, where we can learn when patients need a given intervention. Continuous, forward-facing event prediction is particularly applicable in the ICU setting where we want to account for evolving clinical needs and information throughout the patient’s stay.\nIn this work, we focus on predicting the onset and weaning of interventions. The efficacy of interventions can vary drastically from patient to patient, and unnecessarily administering an in-\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n08 49\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\ntervention can be harmful and expensive. Any treatments come with inherent risks, and we target interventions that span a wide severity of needs in critical care— specifically, invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, colloid boluses, and crystalloid boluses. Mechanical ventilation is commonly used for breathing assistance, but has many potential complications (Yang and Tobin) and small changes in ventilation settings can have large impact in patient outcomes (Tobin, 2006). Vasopressors are a common ICU medication, but there is no robust evidence of improved outcomes from their use (Müllner et al., 2004), and some evidence they may be harmful (DAragon et al., 2015). Fluid boluses are used to improve cardiovascular function and organ perfusion. There are two bolus types: crystalloid and colloid. Both are often considered as less aggressive alternatives to vasopressors, but there are no multi-center trials studying whether fluid bolus therapy should be given to critically ill patients, only studies trying to distinguish which type of fluid should be given (Malbrain et al., 2014).\nCapturing complex relationships across many disparate data types is key for predictive performance in our tasks. To this end, we take advantage of the success of deep learning models to capture rich representations of data with little hand-engineering by domain experts. We use long short-term memory networks (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), which have been shown to effectively model complicated dependencies in timeseries data (Bengio et al., 1994). Previously, LSTMs have achieved state-of-the-art results in many different applications, such as machine translation (Hermann et al., 2015), dialogue systems (Chorowski et al., 2015) and image captioning (Xu et al., 2015). They are well-suited to our modeling tasks because clinical conditions may be spread apart over several hours. We compare the LSTM models to a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that has previously been explored for longitudinal laboratory data (Razavian et al., 2016). All models predict outcomes in a continuous manner given any patient record over vitals, labs, demographic, and notes. In doing so, we:\n1. Achieve state-of-the-art prediction results in our forward-facing, hourly prediction of clinical interventions (onset, weaning, and continuity) that could be used at the time of care. 2. Demonstrate that different data modalities and features are most important for different types of predictive tasks in our LSTM using feature occlusion. This is an important step in making models more interpretable by physicians. 3. Highlight patient trajectories that lead to the most and least confident predictions in our CNN across outcomes and features, also aiding in interpretability."

      "heading" : "2. Background and Related Work",
      "text" : "Clinical decision-making often happens in settings of limited knowledge and high uncertainty; for example, only 10 of the 72 ICU interventions evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are not associated with improved outcomes (Ospina-Tascón et al., 2008). Our goal is to gain insight from healthcare data previously collected for the primary purpose of facilitating patient care.\nRecent studies have applied recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to modeling sequential EHR data to tag ICU signals with billing code labels (Che et al., 2016; Lipton et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2015), to identify the impact of different drugs for diabetes (Krishnan et al., 2015). Razavian et al. (2016) compared CNNs to LSTMs for longitudinal outcome prediction on billing codes using lab tests. With regard to interpretability, Choi et al. (2016) used temporal attention to identify important features in early diagnostic prediction of chronic diseases from time-ordered billing codes. Others have focused on using representations of clinical notes (Ghassemi et al., 2014) or patient physiological signals to predict mortality (Ghassemi et al., 2015).\nPrevious work on interventions in ICU populations have often either focused on a single outcome or used data from specialized cohorts. Such models with vasopressors as a predictive target have achieved AUCs of 0.79 in patients receiving fluid resuscitation (Fialho et al., 2013), 0.85 in septic shock patients (Salgado et al., 2016), and 0.88 for onset after a 4 hour gap and 0.71 for weaning, only trained on patients who did receive a vasopressor (Wu et al., 2016). However, we train our models on general ICU populations in order to make them more applicable. In the most recent prior work on interventions, also on a general ICU population, the best AUC performances were 0.67 (ventilation), 0.78 (vasopressor) for vasopressor onset prediction after a 4 hour gap (Ghassemi et al., 2017). These were lowered to 0.66 and 0.74 with a longer gap time of 8 hours."

      "text" : "Clinical narrative notes were processed to create a 50-dimensional vector of topic proportions for each note using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004). These vectors are replicated forward and aggregated through time (Ghassemi et al., 2014). For example, if a patient had a note A recorded at hour 3 and a note B at hour 7, hours 3–6 would contain the topic distribution from A, while hours 7 onward would contain the aggregated topic distribution from A and B combined.\nWe compare raw physiological data to physiological words, where we categorize the vitals data by first converting each value into a z-score based on the population mean and standard deviation for that variable, and then rounding this score to the nearest integer and capping it to be between -4 and 4. Each z-score value then becomes its own column, which explicitly allows for a representation of missingness (e.g., all columns for a particular variable zeroed) that does not require imputation (Figure 7 in Appendix B) (Wu et al., 2016).\nThe physiological variables, topic distribution, and static variables for each patient are concatenated into a single feature vector per patient per hour (Esteban et al., 2016). The intervention state\nof each patient (a binary value indicating whether or not they are on the intervention of interest at each timestep) and the time of day for each timestep (an integer from 0 to 23 representing the hour) are also added to this feature vector. Using the time of day as a feature makes it easier for the model to capture circadian rhythms that may be present in, e.g., the vitals data."

      "text" : "We split each patients record into 6 hour chunks using a sliding window and make a prediction for a window of 4 hours after a gap time of 6 hours (Figure 2). When predicting ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, or vasopressors, the model classifies the prediction window as one of four possible outcomes: 1) Onset, 2) Wean, 3) Staying on intervention, 4) Staying off intervention. A prediction window is an onset if there is a transition from a label of 0 to 1 for the patient during that window; weaning is the opposite: a transition from 1 to 0. A window is classified as ”stay on” if the label for the entire window is 1 or ”stay off” if 0. When predicting colloid or crystalloid boluses, we classify the prediction window into one of two classes: 1) Onset, or 2) No Onset, since these interventions are not administered for on-going durations of time. After splitting the patient records into fixedlength chunks, we end up with 1,154,101 examples. Table 1 lists the proportions of each class for each intervention."

Our architecture consists of temporal convolutions at three different temporal granularities with 64 filters each. The dimensions of the filters are 1× i, where i ∈ {3, 4, 5}.\nWe pad the inputs such that the outputs from the convolutional layers are the same size, and we use a stride of 1. Each convolution is followed by a max pooling layer with a pooling size of 3. The outputs from all three temporal granularities are concatenated and flattened, and followed by 2 fully connected layers with dropout in between and a softmax over the output (Figure 3b)."

If there are K classes each with a per-class AUC of AUCk then the macro AUC is defined as the average of the per-class AUCS, AUCmacro = 1K ∑ k AUCk. We use the macro AUC as an aggregate score because it weights the AUCs of all classes equally, regardless of class size (Manning et al., 2008). This is important because of the large class imbalance present in the data.\nWe use L2 regularized logistic regression (LR) as a baseline for comparison with the neural networks (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

      "text" : "Because of the additional time dependencies of recurrent neural networks, getting feature-level interpretability from LSTMs is notoriously difficult. To achieve this, we borrow an idea from image recognition to help understand how the LSTM uses different features of the patients. Zeiler and Fergus (2013) use occlusion to understand how models process images: they remove a region of the image (by setting all values in that region to 0) and compare the model’s prediction of this occluded image with the original prediction. A large shift in the prediction implies that the occluded region contains important information for the correct prediction. With our LSTM model, we remove features one by one from the patients (by replacing the given feature with noise drawn from a uniform distribution in [0,1)). We then compare the predictive ability of the model with and without each feature; when this difference is large, then the model was relying heavily on that feature to make the prediction."

      "heading" : "4.5.2 CNN FILTER/ACTIVATION VISUALIZATION",

First, in order to understand how the CNN is using the patient data to predict certain tasks, we find and compare the top 10 real examples that our model predicts are most and least likely to have a specific outcome. As our gap time is 6 hours, this means that the model predicts high probability of onset of the given task 6 hours after the end of the identified trajectories.\nSecond, we generate “hallucinations” from the model which maximize the predicted probability for a given task (Erhan et al., 2009). This is done by creating an objective function that maximizes the activation of a specific output node, and backpropagating gradients back to the input image, adjusting the image so that it maximally activates the output node."

The AUCs for each of our five intervention types and 4 prediction tasks are shown for all models in Table 2.

This may be because physiological words have a smoothing effect. Since we round the z-score for each value to the nearest integer, if a patient has a heart rate of 87 at one hour and then 89 at the next, those will probably be represented as the same word. This may make the model invariant to small fluctuations in the patient’s data and more resilient to overfitting small classes. In addition, the physiological word representation has an explicit encoding for missing data. This is in contrast to the raw data that has been forward-filled and mean-imputed, introducing noise and making it difficult for the model to know how confident to be in the measurements it is given (Che et al., 2016)."

      "heading" : "5.2 Feature-Level Occlusions Identify Important Per-Class Features",
      "text" : "We are able to interpret the LSTM’s predictions using feature occlusion (Section 4.5.1). We note that vitals, labs, topics and static data are important for different interventions (Figure 4). Table 5 has a complete listing of the most probable words for each topic mentioned.\nFor mechanical ventilation, the top five important features are consistent for weaning and onset (pH, sodium, lactate, hemoglobin, and potassium). This is sensible, because all are important lab values used to assess a patient’s physiological stability, and ventilation is an aggressive intervention. However, ventilation onset additionally places importance on a patient’s Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and Topic 4 (assessing patient consciousness), likely because patient sedation is a critical part of mechanical ventilation. We also note that the scale of AUC difference between ventilation onset and weaning is the largest observed (up to 0.30 for weaning and 0.12 for onset).\nIn vasopressor onset prediction, physiological variables such as potassium and hematocrit are consistently important, which agrees with clinical assessment of cardiovascular state (Bassi et al., 2013). Similarly, Topic 3 (noting many physiological values) is also important for both onset and weaning. Note that the overall difference in AUC for onset ranges up to 0.16, but there is no significant decrease in AUC for weaning (< 0.02). This is consistent with previous work that demonstrated weaning to be a more difficult task in general for vasopressors (Wu et al., 2016). We also note that weaning prediction places importance on time of day. As noted by Wu et al. (2016), this could be a side-effect of patients being left on interventions longer than necessary.\nFor non-invasive ventilation onset and weaning the learned topics are more important than physiological variables. This may mean that the need for less severe interventions can only be detected\nfrom clinical insights derived in notes. Similarly to vasopressors, we note that onset AUCs vary more than weaning AUCs (0.14 vs 0.01), and that time of day is important for weaning.\nFor crystalloid and colloid bolus onsets, topics are all but one of the five most important features for detection. Colloid boluses in general have more AUC variance for the topic features (0.14 vs. 0.05), which is likely due to the larger class imbalance compared to crystalloids."

      "heading" : "5.3 Convolutional Filters Target Short-term Trajectories",
      "text" : "We are able to understand the CNN by examining maximally activating patient trajectories (Section 4.5.2). Figure 5 shows the mean with standard deviation error bars for four of the most differentiated features of the 10 real patient trajectories that are the highest and lowest activating for each task. The trends suggest that patients who will require ventilation in the future have higher diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate, and lower oxygen saturation — possibly corresponding to patients who are experiencing hyperventilation. For vasopressor onsets, we see a decreased systolic blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation rate. These could either indicate altered peripheral perfusion or stress hyperglycemia. Topic 3, which was important for vasopressor onset using occlusion 4, is also increased.\nIn the less invasive tasks, we saw decreased creatinine, phosphate, oxygen saturation and blood urea nitrogen for non-invasive ventilation, potentially indicating neuromuscular respiratory failure.\nFor colloid and crystalloid boluses we note general indicators of physiological decline, as boluses are given for a wide range of conditions.\n“Hallucinations” for vasopressor and ventilation onset are shown in Figure 6. While our model was not trained with any physiological knowledge or priors, we note that it identifies blood pressure drops as being maximally activating for vasopressor onset, and respiratory rate decreasing for ventilation onset. This suggests that it is still able to independently learn physiological factors that are important for intervention prediction. We note that these hallucinations give us more insight into underlying properties of the network and what it is looking for. However, since these trajectories are made to maximize the output of the model, they do not necessarily correspond to physiologically plausible trajectories."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this work, we targeted forward-facing prediction of ICU interventions covering multiple physiological organ systems. To our knowledge, our model is the first to use deep neural networks to predict both onset and weaning of interventions using all available modalities of ICU data. In our tasks, deep learning methods beat state-of-the-art AUCs reported in prior work for intervention prediction tasks — this is sensible given that prior works have focused on single targets with smaller datasets (Wu et al., 2016) or unsupervised representations prior to supervised training (Ghassemi et al., 2017). We also note that the LSTM over physiological words significantly improved perfor-\nmance in the two intervention tasks with the lowest incidence rate — possibly because this representation encodes important information about what is “normal” for each physiological value, or is more robust to missingness in the physiological data.\nImportantly, we were able to gain interpretability in both models. In the LSTMs, we examined feature importance using occlusion, and found that physiological data were important in more invasive tasks, while clinical note topics were more important for less invasive interventions. This could indicate that there is more clinical discretion at play for less invasive tasks. We also found that all weaning tasks save ventilation had less AUC variance, which could indicate that these decisions are also made with a large amount of clinical judgment.\nThe temporal convolutions in our CNN filters over the multi-channel input learnt interesting and clinically-relevant trends in real patient trajectories, and these were further mimicked in the hallucinations generated by the network. As in prior work, we found that RNNs often have similar or improved performance as compared to CNNs Razavian et al. (2016). However, it is possible that more complex models would perform better as they uncover more long and short-term dependencies.\nOur results are an interesting start to extracting interpretability from neural networks on patient data, and future work to expand this will enable these models to be adopted in real clinical settings.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was funded in part by the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data and the National Library of Medicine Biomedical Informatics Research Training grant (NIH/NLM 2T15 LM007092-22)."

In particular, we compare both long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for prediction of five intervention tasks: invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, colloid boluses, and crystalloid boluses. Our predictions are done in a forward-facing manner to enable “real-time” performance, and predictions are made with a six hour gap time to support clinically actionable planning. We achieve state-of-the-art results on our predictive tasks using deep architectures. We explore the use of feature occlusion to interpret LSTM models, and compare this to the interpretability gained from examining inputs that maximally activate CNN outputs. We show that our models are able to significantly outperform baselines in intervention prediction, and provide insight into model learning, which is crucial for the adoption of such models in practice.",
