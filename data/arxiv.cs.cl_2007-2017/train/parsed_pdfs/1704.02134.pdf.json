      "text" : "1 Overview\n1.1 What counts as an adposition?\n“Adposition” is the cover term for prepositions and postpositions. Briefly, we consider an affix, word, or multiword expression to be an adposition if it:\n• Mediates a semantically asymmetric figure–ground relation between two concepts\n1http://tiny.cc/prepwiki\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n02 13\n4v 1\n• Is a grammatical item that can mark an NP, and in some cases may mark clauses (as a subordinator) or be intransitive. We also include alwaysintransitive grammatical items whose core meaning is spatial and highly schematic, like English together, apart, and away. • Is not a differential object marker (e.g., Hebrew ’et, which marks direct objects if and only if they are definite).\n1.2 Inventory\nThe v2 hierarchy is a tree with 50 labels. They are organized into three major subhierarchies: CIRCUMSTANCE (18 labels), PARTICIPANT (14 labels), and CONFIGURATION (18 labels).\nCircumstance\nTemporal\nTime\nStartTime EndTime DeicticTime\nFrequency Duration\nLocus\nSource Goal\nPath\nDirection Extent\nMeans Manner Explanation\nPurpose\nParticipant\nCauser\nAgent\nCo-Agent\nTheme\nCo-Theme Topic\nStimulus Experiencer\nOriginator\nRecipient\nCost Beneficiary Instrument\nConfiguration\nIdentity\nSpecies\nGestalt\nPossessor Whole Characteristic\nPossession Part/Portion\nStuff\nAccompanier\nInsteadOf ComparisonRef RateUnit Quantity\nApproximator\nSocialRel\nOrgRole\n• Items in the CIRCUMSTANCE subhierarchy are prototypically expressed as adjuncts of time, place, manner, purpose, etc. elaborating an event or entity. • Items in the PARTICIPANT subhierarchy are prototypically entities functioning as arguments to an event. • Items in the CONFIGURATION subhierarchy are prototypically entities or properties in a static relationship to some entity.\n1.3 Limitations\nThis inventory is only designed to capture semantic relations with a figure–ground asymmetry. This excludes:\n• The semantics of coordination, where the two sides of the relation are on equal footing, are not captured here. (Note that sometimes a morpheme can have symmetric as well as asymmetric interpretations: e.g., Korean -wa.) • Aspects of meaning that pertain to information structure, discourse, or pragmatics.\nMoreover, this inventory only captures semantic distinctions that tend to correlate with major differences in syntactic distribution. Thus, while there are labels for locative (LOCUS), ablative (SOURCE), allative (GOAL), and PATH semantics— and analogous temporal categories—finer-grained details of spatiotemporal meaning are for the most part lexical (viz.: the difference between in the box and on the box, or temporal at, before, during, and after) and are not represented here.2\n1.4 Major changes from v1\nChanges that affect only a single label are explained below the relevant v2 labels.\n• Removed multiple inheritance. The v1 network was quite tangled. The structure is greatly simplified by analyzing some tokens as construals (Hwang et al., 2017). • Revised and expanded the CONFIGURATION subhierarchy. • Removed the locative concreteness distinction. In v1, labels LOCATION,\nINITIALLOCATION, and DESTINATION were reserved for concrete locations, and the respective supertypes LOCUS, SOURCE, and GOAL used to cover abstract locations. This distinction was found to be difficult and without apparent relevance to the English preposition system. The concrete labels were thus removed. • Removed the location/state/value distinction. The v1 scheme attempted to make an elaborate distinction between values, states, and other kinds of abstract locations. However, the English preposition system does not seem particularly sensitive to these distinctions. (We are not aware of any prepositions that mark primarily values or primarily states; rather, productive metaphors allow locative prepositions to be extended to cover\n2This is not to claim that all members of a category can be grammatical in all the same contexts: on Saturday and at 5:00 are both labeled TIME, though the prepositions are by no means interchangeable in American English. We are simply asserting that the different constructions specific to days of the week versus times of the day are minor aspects of the grammar of English.\nthese, and there are cases where teasing apart abstract location vs. state vs. value is difficult.) Therefore, STATE, INITIALSTATE, ENDSTATE, VALUE, and VALUECOMPARISON were removed.\n• Revised the treatment of comparison and related notions. • Greatly simplified the PATH subhierarchy. See §2.3. • Simplified the TEMPORAL subhierarchy. See §2.1.\n2 CIRCUMSTANCE\nMacrolabel for labels pertaining to space and time; abstract/ metaphoric locations such as states; and other categories that usually constitute semantically non-core properties of events.\nRarely, CIRCUMSTANCE is used directly for: • Contextualization\n(1) In arguing for tax reform, the president claimed that loopholes allow big corporations to profit from moving their headquarters overseas.\n(2) Bipartisan compromise is unlikely with the election just around the corner.\nFor these cases, the preposition helps situate the background context in which the main event takes place. The background context is often realized as a subordinate clause preceding the main clause.\n• Occasions\n(3) I bought her a bike for Christmas.\n(4) I had peanut butter for lunch.\nThese simultaneously express a TIME and some element of causality similar to PURPOSE. But the PP is not exactly answering a Why? or When? question. Instead, the sentence most naturally answers a question like On what occasion was X done? or Under what circumstances did X happen?. • Any other descriptions of event/state properties that are insufficiently specified to fall under spatial, temporal, causal, or other subtypes like MANNER.\n2.1 TEMPORAL\nAbstract supercategory for temporal descriptions: when, for how long, how often, how many times, etc. something happened or will happen.\nHistory. The v1 category AGE (e.g., a child of five) was a mutual subtype of TEMPORAL and ATTRIBUTE. Being quite specific and rare, for v2 it was merged with CHARACTERISTIC. Combined with the changes to TIME subcategories (see below), this reduced by 3 the number of labels in the TEMPORAL subtree, bringing it to 7.\n2.1.1 TIME\nWhen something happened or will happen, in relation to a reference time or event.\n(5) We ate in the afternoon at 2:00\non Friday\n.\n(6) Let’s talk at during lunch. (7) I will finish after tomorrow lunch\nyou (do)\n.\n(8) I will finish by tomorrow lunch .\nThe preposition since is ambiguous:\n(9) [‘after’] I grew a beard—that was since the breakup. (TIME)\n(10) [‘ever since’] I have loved you since the party where we met. (STARTTIME)\n(11) [‘because’] I’ll try not to whistle since I know that gets on your nerves. (EXPLANATION)\nHistory. In v1, point-like temporal prepositions (at, on, in, as) were distinguished from displaced temporal prepositions (before, after, etc.) which present the two times in the relation as unequal. RELATIVETIME inherited from TIME and was reserved for the displaced temporal prepositions, as well as subclasses STARTTIME, ENDTIME, DEICTICTIME, and CLOCKTIMECXN.\nFor v2, RELATIVETIME was merged into TIME: the distinction was found to be entirely lexical and lacked parallelism with the spatial hierarchy. CLOCKTIMECXN\nwas also merged with TIME, the usages covered by the former (expressions of clock time like ten of seven) being exceedingly rare and not very different semantically from prepositions like before."

[see (20a)]\n(26) I ate throughout through\ninto\nthe night.\n2.2 LOCUS\nLocation, condition, or value. May be abstract.\n(27) I like to sing at the gym in the shower on Main St. . (28) The cat is on_top_of beside near the dog. (29) the wheels on the bus\n(30) I read it in a book on a website . (31) The charge is on my credit card.\n(32) We met on a trip to Paris.\n(33) The Dow is at a new high 20,000 .\n(34) I am now off work.\n(35) She was in a coma.\nIn a phenomenon called fictive motion (Talmy, 1996), dynamic language may be used to describe static scenes. We use construal for these:\n(36) A road runs through my property. LOCUS;PATH\n(37) The road extends to the river. LOCUS;GOAL\n(38) I saw him from the roof. LOCUS;SOURCE\n2.2.1 SOURCE\nInitial location, condition, or value. May be abstract.\nPrototypical prepositions include from, off, off_of, and out_of:\n(39) The cat jumped off_of off\nfrom\nthe ledge.\n(40) I got it from off the internet. (41) people from France\n(42) The temperature is rising from a low of 30 degrees.\n(43) I have arrived from work.\n(44) She awoke from came out of a coma.\nSOURCE is prototypically inanimate, though it can be used to construe animate PARTICIPANTs (especially ORIGINATOR and CAUSER). Contrasts with GOAL.\n2.2.2 GOAL\nFinal location (destination), condition, or value. May be abstract.\nPrototypical prepositions include to, for, toward(s), into, and onto:\n(45) I ran to the store.\n(46) The cat jumped onto the ledge.\n(47) The temperature is rising to a high of 40 degrees.\n(48) I will leave for work.\n(49) She slipped into a coma.\nEnglish regularly allows canonically static locative prepositions to mark goals with motion verbs like put. We use the construal GOAL;LOCUS:\n(50) I put the lamp next_to the chair.\n(51) I’ll just hop in the shower.\n(52) I put my CV on the internet.\n(53) The cat jumped on my face.\nGOAL is prototypically inanimate, though it can be used to construe animate PARTICIPANTs (especially RECIPIENT). Contrasts with SOURCE.\n2.3 PATH\nAn intermediate space between an initial position and a final position.\n(54) The bird flew over the building.\n(55) The sun traveled across the sky.\n(56) Hot water is running through the pipes.\nSee also: INSTRUMENT, MANNER\nHistory. The v1 hierarchy distinguished many different subcategories of path descriptions. The labels TRAVERSED, 1DTRAJECTORY, 2DAREA, 3DMEDIUM, CONTOUR, VIA, TRANSIT, and COURSE have all been merged with PATH for v2.\n2.3.1 DIRECTION\nHow motion or an object is aimed/oriented.\nThis is typically used for intransitive prepositions (sometimes classified as adverbs). There may or may not be an implicit SOURCE or GOAL:\n(57) The bird flew up out\naway\n.\n(58) The price shot up.\n2.3.2 EXTENT\nThe size of a path.\nThis can be the physical distance traversed or the amount of change on a scale:\n(59) We ran for miles.\n(60) The price shot up by 10%.\n2.4 MEANS\nSecondary action or event that characterizes how the main event happens or is achieved.\nPrototypically a volitional action, though not necessarily (64). A volitional MEANS will often modify an intended result, though the outcome can be unintended as well (63).\n(61) Open the door by turning the knob.\n(62) They retaliated by shooting with shootings . (63) The owners destroyed the company by growing it too fast.\n(64) Chlorophyll absorbs the light by transfer of electrons.\nMEANS is similar to INSTRUMENT, which is used for causally supporting entities and is a kind of PARTICIPANT.\nContrast with EXPLANATION, which characterizes why something happens. I.e., an EXPLANATION portrays the secondary event as the causal instigator of the main event, whereas MEANS portrays it merely as a facilitator.\nHistory. In v1, MEANS was a subtype of INSTRUMENT, but with the removal of multiple inheritance for v2, the former was moved directly under CIRCUMSTANCE and the latter directly under PARTICIPANT.\n2.5 MANNER\nDescription of how something happens or exists that does not directly invoke a location, path, or temporal or causal relation. Often the “style” of something.\n(65) The toddler is old enough to eat by herself.\n(66) The people shouted with pleasure.\n(67) They dance in a circle. (PATH;MANNER)\n(68) The sand is in a pyramid shape.\n(69) It was written in French.\n(70) music in C major\nHistory. In v1, MANNER was positioned as an ancestor of all categories that license a How? question, including INSTRUMENT, MEANS, and CONTOUR, as in (67). This criterion was deemed too broad, so MANNER has no subtypes in v2.\n2.6 EXPLANATION\nAssertion of why something happens or is the case.\nThis marks a secondary event that is asserted as the reason for the main event or state.\n(71) I went outside because_of the smell.\n(72) The rain is due_to a cold front.\n(73) I will appoint him as since he is most qualified for the job.\nQuestion test: EXPLANATION and its subtype PURPOSE license Why? questions.\n2.6.1 PURPOSE\nSomething that somebody wants to bring about, asserted to be why something was done, is the case, or exists.\nCentral usages of PURPOSE explain the motivation behind an action. Typically the governing event serves as a means for achieving or facilitating the PURPOSE. Prototypical markers include for and infinitive marker to:\n(74) a. He rose to make a grand speech.\nb. surgery to treat a leg injury\n(75) a. He rose for a grand speech.\nb. We hired a caterer for (the party) tonight.\nSomething directly manipulated/affected can stand in metonymically for the desired event:\n(76) a. I went to the store for eggs. [understood: ‘to acquire/buy eggs’]\nb. surgery for a leg injury [understood: ‘to treat a leg injury’]\nIn contrast to the above, where the governor denotes an event, an entity can be modified to explicate an intended use or affordance. Because this can be understood as a static property of the entity—why it was created or what it is useful for (part of its qualia structure)—we use the construal CHARACTERISTIC;PURPOSE:3\n(77) CHARACTERISTIC;PURPOSE:\na. a shoulder to cry on b. The noose for the prisoner was too loose. [understood: ‘for use on the prisoner’] c. a good store for eggs [understood: ‘for acquiring/buying eggs’] d. a good book to give to young readers e. a good book for young readers [understood: ‘for giving to young readers’]\nQuestion test: EXPLANATION and its subtype PURPOSE, when used adverbially, license Why? questions. PURPOSE usually licenses an in order to or for the purpose of paraphrase.\nHistory. In v1, the usages illustrated in (77) were assigned a separate label, FUNCTION, which inherited from both ATTRIBUTE and PURPOSE. The ability to use construal removes the need for a separate label.\n3In FrameNet as of v1.7, these sorts of purposes are labeled as INHERENT_PURPOSE. See, e.g., the example “MONEY [to support yourself and your family]” in the Money frame (https: //framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/lu/lu13361.xml?mode=annotation).\n3 PARTICIPANT\nThing, usually an entity, that plays a causal role in an event.\nNot used directly—see subtypes.\n3.1 CAUSER\nInstigator of, and a core participant in, an event.\nCAUSER is applied directly to inanimate things or forces conceptualized as entities. Prototypical prepositions are by (prominently including passive-by) and of:\n(78) the devastation of the town wreaked by the fire\n(79) the devastation of the fire\nThe CAUSER is sometimes construed as a SOURCE:\n(80) a. the devastation from the fire (CAUSER;SOURCE)\nb. fatalities from cancer (CAUSER;SOURCE) c. FDR suffered from polio. (CAUSER;SOURCE)\nSee also: INSTRUMENT\n3.1.1 AGENT\nAnimate instigator of an action (typically volitional).\nPrototypical prepositions are by (prominently including passive-by) and of:\n(81) the decisive vote by of the City Council\nWhen two symmetric AGENTs are collected in a single NP functioning as a set, it is marked as a WHOLE construal:\n(82) There was a war between France and Spain.

Adpositional THEMEs are usually construed as something else:\n(86) Fill the bowl with water. (THEME;INSTRUMENT)\n(87) The mechanic made a repair to the engine. (THEME;GOAL)\n(88) a. Sheldukher searched fumbled for his laser pistol. (THEME;GOAL)\nb. There is a significant demand for new housing. (THEME;GOAL) c. They charge higher prices for goods bought by credit card.

(THEME;WHOLE)\n(94) Links between science and industry are important. (THEME;WHOLE)\nHistory. In v1, following many thematic role inventories, PATIENT was a distinct label for undergoers that were affected (undergoing an internal change of state). It was merged into THEME for v2 because the affectedness criterion can be subtle and difficult to apply.\nCompare: CO-THEME\n3.2.1 CO-THEME\nSecond semantically core undergoer that would otherwise be labeled THEME, but which is adpositionally marked in contrast with a THEME occupying a non-oblique syntactic position (subject or object).\n(95) They replaced my old tires with new ones.\nHistory. In v1, CO-PATIENT was a distinct label, and the two shared a common supertype, CO-PARTICIPANT. See note at THEME.\nSee also: INSTEADOF, CO-AGENT\n3.2.2 TOPIC\nInformation content or subject matter in communication or cognition.\nPrototypical prepositions are about and on:\n(96) I gave a presentation about on politics. (97) Try not to think about it.\nLess prototypical TOPIC markers include:\n(98) Are you interested in politics?\n(99) I was accused of treason.\n(100) I’m an expert talented at cooking.\nSee also: STIMULUS\n3.3 STIMULUS\nThat which is perceived or experienced (bodily, perceptually, or emotionally).\nSTIMULUS does not seem to have any prototypical adposition in the languages we have looked at. In English, it can be construed in several ways:\n(101) My affection for you (STIMULUS;BENEFICIARY)\n(102) Scared by the bear (STIMULUS;CAUSER)\n(103) I startled at the noise (STIMULUS;GOAL)\n(104) I care about you (STIMULUS;TOPIC)\nCounterpart: EXPERIENCER\n3.4 EXPERIENCER\nAnimate who is aware of a bodily experience, perception, emotion, or mental state.\nEXPERIENCER does not seem to have any prototypical adposition in the languages we have looked at. In English, it can be construed in several ways:\n(105) The anger of the students (EXPERIENCER;POSSESSOR)\n(106) Running is enjoyable for me (EXPERIENCER;BENEFICIARY)\n(107) It feels hot to me (EXPERIENCER;GOAL)\nElsewhere, the term cognizer is sometimes used for one whose mental state is described.\nCounterpart: STIMULUS\n3.5 ORIGINATOR\nAnimate who is the initial possessor or creator/producer of something, including the speaker/communicator of information. Excludes events where transfer/communication is not framed as unidirectional.\nA “source” in the broadest sense of a starting point/condition. Contrasts with RECIPIENT if there is transfer/communication.\nTypically construed as AGENT (with give, tell, talk to, create: subject or passiveby; adnominal by as in works by Shakespeare) or SOURCE (obtain/hear from; adnominal of as in works of Shakespeare). Occasionally construed as THEME (rob her of her life savings: direct object).\nDoes not apply to events like exchange, talk/chat with, or negotiate, which involve a back-and-forth between AGENT and CO-AGENT (or a plural AGENT).\nHistory. ORIGINATOR merges v1 labels DONOR/SPEAKER and CREATOR, which were difficult to distinguish in the case of authorship. DONOR/SPEAKER was a subtype of INITIALLOCATION, which inherited from LOCATION and SOURCE. CREATOR was a subtype of AGENT. Moving ORIGINATOR directly under PARTICIPANT puts it in a neutral position with respect to its possible construals.\n3.6 RECIPIENT\nAnimate who is the (actual or intended) final possessor of a thing or message. Excludes events where transfer/communication is not framed as unidirectional.\nA “goal” in the broadest sense of an ending point/condition. Contrasts with ORIGINATOR.\nTypically construed as GOAL (give/talk to), AGENT (with receive: subject or passive-by), or THEME (with inform: direct object).\nDoes not apply to events like exchange, talk/chat with, or negotiate, which involve a back-and-forth between AGENT and CO-AGENT (or a plural AGENT).\nHistory. In v1, RECIPIENT was the counterpart to DONOR/SPEAKER: RECIPIENT was a subtype of DESTINATION, which inherited from LOCATION and GOAL. Moving RECIPIENT directly under PARTICIPANT puts it in a neutral position with respect to its possible construals.\n3.7 COST\nAn amount (typically of money) that is linked to an item or service that it pays for/could pay for, or given as the amount earned or owed.\nThe governor may be an explicit commercial scenario:\n(108) I bought sold the book for $10. (109) The book is priced valued at $10. (110) I got a refund of $10.\nOr the COST may be specified as an adjunct with a non-commerical governor:\n(111) You can ride the bus for free $1 . COST is not used with general scenes of possession or transfer, even if the thing possessed or transferred happens to be an amount of money:\n(112) I bestowed the winner withCO-THEME $100.\nHistory. This category was not present in v1, which had the broader category VALUE. VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2017) has a similar category called ASSET; we chose the name COST to emphasize that it describes a relation rather than an entity type (it does not apply to money with a verb like possess or transfer, for instance).\n3.8 BENEFICIARY\nAnimate or personified undergoer that is (potentially) advantaged or disadvantaged by the event or state.\nThis label does not distinguish the polarity of the relation (helping or hurting, which is sometimes termed maleficiary).\n(113) Vote for against Pedro! (114) Junk food is bad for your health.\n(115) My parrot died on me.\n3.9 INSTRUMENT\nAn entity that facilitates an action by applying intermediate causal force.\nPrototypically, an AGENT intentionally applies the INSTRUMENT with the purpose of achieving a result:\n(116) a. I broke the window with a hammer.\nb. I destroyed the argument with my words.\nLess prototypically, the action could be unintentional:\n(117) I accidentally poked myself in the eye with a stick.\nThe key is that the INSTRUMENT is not sufficiently “independently causal” to instigate the event.\nHowever, to downplay the agency of the individual operating the instrument, the instrument can be placed in a passive by-phrase, which construes it as the instigator:\n(118) a. The window was broken by the hammer. (INSTRUMENT;CAUSER)\nb. My headache was alleviated by aspirin. (INSTRUMENT;CAUSER)\nNote that the examples in (118) can be rephrased in active voice with the INSTRUMENT as the subject.\nA device serving as a mode of transportation or medium of communication counts as an INSTRUMENT, but is often construed as a LOCUS or PATH:\n(119) Communicate by phone email . (INSTRUMENT) (120) Talk on the phone. (INSTRUMENT;LOCUS)\n(121) Send it over via email. (INSTRUMENT;PATH) (122) Travel by train. (INSTRUMENT)\n(123) Escape with a getaway car. (INSTRUMENT)\n(124) Escape in the getaway car. (INSTRUMENT;LOCUS)\nThis includes some expressions which incorporate the INSTRUMENT in a noun:\n(125) ride on horseback (INSTRUMENT;LOCUS)\n(126) hold at knifepoint (INSTRUMENT;LOCUS)\nOther non-prototypical instruments that can be construed as paths include waypoints from SOURCE to GOAL, and people that serve as intermediaries:\n(127) We flew to London via Paris. (INSTRUMENT;PATH)\n(128) I found out the news via Sharon. (INSTRUMENT;PATH)\nConversely, roadways count as PATHs but can be construed as INSTRUMENTs:\n(129) Escape through the tunnel. (PATH)\n(130) Escape by tunnel. (PATH;INSTRUMENT)\nCompare MEANS, which is used for facilitative events rather than entities.\n4 CONFIGURATION\nThing, usually an entity or property, that is involved in a static relationship to some other entity.\nNot used directly—see subtypes.\n4.1 IDENTITY\nA category being ascribed to something, or something belonging to the category denoted by the governor.\nPrototypical prepositions are of (where the governor is the category) and as (where the object is the category):\n(131) the state of Washington [as opposed to the city]\n(132) The liberal state of Washington has not been receptive to Trump’s message.\n(133) As a liberal state, Washington has not been receptive to Trump’s message.\n(134) I like Bob as a colleague. [but not as a friend]\n(135) What a gem of a restaurant! [exclamative idiom: both NPs are indefinite]\n(136) the idea task\nhassle\nof opening a new business\n(137) the topic issue of semantics\nSomething may be specified with a category in order to disambiguate it (131), or to provide an interpretation or frame of reference with which that entity is to be considered. In some cases, like (137), the category is a shell noun (Schmid, 2000) requiring further specification.\nCategorizations may be situational rather than permanent/definitional:\n(138) a. She appears as Ophelia in Hamlet.\nb. He is usually a bartender, but today he is working as a waiter.\nParaphrase test: “(thing) IS (category) [in the context of the event]”: “Washington is a liberal state”, “opening a new business is a hassle”, “She is Ophelia”, etc. Note that as+category may attach syntactically to a verb, as in (134) and (138), rather than being governed by the item it describes.\nHistory. Generalized from v1, where it was called INSTANCE and restricted to the “(category) of (thing)” formulation. The relevant usages of as were labeled ATTRIBUTE.\n4.2 SPECIES\nA category qualified by sort, type, kind, species, breed, etc. Includes variety, selection, range, assortment, etc. meaning ‘many different kinds’.\n(139) that sort of business\n(140) A good type of ant to keep is the red ant .\n(141) certain strains of Escherichia coli\n(142) Modern breeds of these homing pigeons return reliably\n(143) Some poor sap applied the wrong brand of paint\n(144) This store offers a wide selection of footstools\nSPECIES is not used if the sort/variety noun is the object rather than the governor:\n(145) a business ofCHARACTERISTIC that sort\n4.3 GESTALT\nGeneralized notion of “whole” understood with reference to a component part, possession, set member, or characteristic. See CHARACTERISTIC.\nGESTALT applies directly to: • The holder of a property if the property is the governor:\n(146) a. the blueness of the sky\nb. the wisdom of the crowd c. the time of the party d. the amount of time allowed [but see (195)]\n• The wearer of attire:\n(147) the uniforms of the children\n(148) the shirt on him (GESTALT;LOCUS)\n• Anything that is borderline between subcategories POSSESSOR and WHOLE See also: QUANTITY\n4.3.1 POSSESSOR\nAnimate who has something (the POSSESSION) which is not part of their body or inherent to their identity/character but could, in principle, be taken away.\nPrototypically expressed with of:\n(149) the money of the rich\nSee SOCIALREL.\n4.3.2 WHOLE\nSomething described with respect to its part, portion, subevent, subset, or set element. See PART/PORTION.\n(150) a. The new engine of the car\nb. The flaxen hair of the girl c. The 3 layers of the cake\nd. The 3 prongs of the strategy e. The remainder rest of the cake\nf. The tastiest bit of the cake\ng. The tennis matches of a series h. The interior of the shopping bag\ni. The south (region) of France j. The beginning of the party\n(151) a. The tennis matches in a series (WHOLE;LOCUS)\nb. The new engine in the car (WHOLE;LOCUS) c. the escape key on the keyboard (WHOLE;LOCUS) d. The clothes in the pile (WHOLE;MANNER)\n(152) Sets and ratios:\na. This is one of the worst better retaurants in town. (WHOLE) b. 2 in 10 American children are redheads. (WHOLE;LOCUS) c. 2 out_of 10 American children are redheads. (WHOLE;SOURCE) d. Out_of the 10 children in the class, only Mary is a redhead. (WHOLE;SOURCE) e. Among the 10 children in the class, only Mary is a redhead. (WHOLE)\nIf the governor narrows the reference to a certain amount of the WHOLE, the construal QUANTITY;WHOLE is used—see (197). Note that this only applies if the governor is a measure term; it does not apply to distinctive parts like “layers” (150c) and “prongs” (150d), even if a count is specified.\nUsed to construe geographic and temporal “containers”:\n(153) Famous castles of the valley (LOCUS;WHOLE)\n(154) a. the 15th Ides of March (TIME;WHOLE)\nb. March of 44 BC (TIME;WHOLE)\nThe prepositions between and among can impose WHOLE construals by combining two or more items in the object NP (contrast with (152e)):\n(155) The negotiations between among the parties went well. (AGENT;WHOLE) (155′) The negotiations by the parties went well. (AGENT)\n4.4 CHARACTERISTIC\nGeneralized notion of a part, feature, possession, or the contents or composition of something, understood with respect to that thing (the GESTALT).\nCan be used to construe person-to-person relationships such as kinship, whose scene role should be SOCIALREL. Labels POSSESSION, PART/PORTION, and its subtype STUFF are defined for some important subclasses.\nCHARACTERISTIC applies directly to: • A property value:\n(156) a. a car of high quality\nb. a man of honor c. a business of that sort [contrast with SPECIES, §4.2]\n• Attire:\n(157) the kid with a vest (on)\n(158) the kid in a vest (CHARACTERISTIC;LOCUS)\n• Role of a complex framal GESTALT that has no obvious decomposition into parts:\n(159) a. the restaurant with a convenient location an extensive menu\nb. a party with great music\n• That which is located in a container denoted by the governor:\n(160) a room with 2 beds\n• Anything that is borderline between subcategories POSSESSION and PART/PORTION\nTypically, one of “GESTALT {HAS, CONTAINS} CHARACTERISTIC” is entailed. This does not help to distinguish subtypes.\nHistory. The v1 label ATTRIBUTE was intended to apply to features of something, but was rather squishy.\n4.4.1 POSSESSION\nThat which some POSSESSOR (animate or personified, e.g. an institution) has, and which is not part of their body or inherent to their identity/character but could, in principle, be taken away.\nSometimes called alienable possession. The possession may be concrete or abstract, and temporary or permanent. Excludes attire: see CHARACTERISTIC.\nPrototypical prepositions are with and without:\n(161) People with money\nImmediate concrete possession uses an ACCOMPANIER construal:\n(162) Hagrid exited the shop with (= carrying) a snowy owl. (POSSESSOR;ACCOMPANIER)\nParaphrase test: “POSSESSOR POSSESSES POSSESSION”, or “POSSESSOR is IN POSSESSION OF POSSESSION”. The latter is especially appropriate for immediate concrete possession.\n4.4.2 PART/PORTION\nA part, portion, subevent, subset, or set element (e.g., an example or exception) of some WHOLE.\nAnything directly labeled with PART/PORTION is understood to be incomplete relative to the WHOLE. This includes body parts and partial food ingredients.\nPrototypical prepositions include with, without; such as, like for exemplification; and but, except, except_for for exceptions:\n(163) a. A car with a new engine\nb. A strategy with 3 prongs c. The girl with flaxen hair d. A man with a wooden leg named Smith e. A valley with a castle\nf. A quintet with 2 cellos\ng. A performance with a guitar solo h. A cake with 3 layers\ni. A sandwich with wheat bread\nj. Soup with carrots (in it)\nk. A chicken sandwich with ketchup (on it)\n(164) Bread without gluten\n(165) Strategies such as divide-and-conquer\n(166) Everyone except Bob plays trombone.\nSome can be paraphrased with INCLUDES, but this is not determinative."

STUFF is distinguished from other instances of PART/PORTION in fully covering (or “summarizing”) the aggregate whole.\nParaphrase test: “WHOLE CONSISTS OF STUFF”\n(167) a. A flock of birds\nb. A throng of tourists c. A clump of sand d. A piece of wood e. A series of tennis matches\nf. An evening of Brahms\ng. A meal of salmon\n(168) A salad of with mixed greens (169) This bottle is of beer (and that one is of wine). [but see (187)]\n(170) ORGROLE;STUFF:\na. An order of nuns b. A chamber group of with 5 players\nSee also: QUANTITY STUFF has no specific counterpart under WHOLE.\n4.5 ACCOMPANIER\nEntity that another entity is together with.\nSometimes called comitative. Prototypical prepositions are with, without, along_with, together_with, and\nin_addition_to:\n(171) I’ll have soup with without salad. (172) She’ll be with us in spirit.\nFor an “extra participant” in an activity, where two parties perform the activity together (but the nature of the activity would not fundamentally change if they each performed it independently), a CO-AGENT construal is used:\n(173) Do you want to walk with me? (ACCOMPANIER;CO-AGENT)\nBy contrast, if the nature of the scene fundamentally requires multiple participants, simple CO-AGENT is used. Often there is ambiguity:4\n(174) Do you want to talk with me?\na. [The reading: Should we have a conversation?] (CO-AGENT) b. [The reading: Do you want to join me in talking to a third party?] (ACCOMPANIER;CO-AGENT)\n(175) I fought with them to reform the regulation.\na. [The reading: I fought against them.] (CO-AGENT) b. [The reading: I was on the same side as them.] (ACCOMPANIER;COAGENT)\nIf the object denotes a item that the governor has on hand in their possession, then the construal POSSESSION;ACCOMPANIER is used:\n(176) I walked in with an umbrella. (POSSESSION;ACCOMPANIER)\nSee also: INSTRUMENT, MANNER\n4Adding together seems to favor the (b) readings: I fought together_with them, We fought together can only mean we were on the same side. Contrastive stress can also force one reading: I fought WITH them (not AGAINST them).\n4.6 INSTEADOF\nA default or already established thing for which something else stands in or is chosen as an alternative.\n(177) I ordered soup instead_of rather_than salad. (178) Instead_of ordering salad, I ordered soup.\n(179) The new shirts were gray instead_of black.\n(180) They substituted swapped my old tires for new ones.\nMay be construed spatially:\n(181) I chose soup over salad. (INSTEADOF;LOCUS)\nSee also: ACCOMPANIER, COMPARISONREF, CO-THEME\n4.7 COMPARISONREF\nThe reference point in an explicit comparison (or contrast), i.e., an expression indicating that something is similar/analogous to, different from, or the same as something else.\nThe marker of the “something else” (the ground in the figure–ground relationship) is given the label COMPARISONREF:\n(182) a. She is taller than me.\nb. She is taller than I am. c. She is taller than she is wide. d. She is better at math than at drawing. e. The shirt is more gray than black.\n(183) a. She is as tall as I am.\nb. Your face is asCHARACTERISTIC red as a rose. c. Your face is red as a rose. d. Your surname is the_same as mine.\n(184) Harry had never met anyone quite like Luna.\n(185) It was as_if like he had insulted my mother.\nThe comparison is often made with respect to some dimension or attribute, the CHARACTERISTIC, which may or may not be scalar. The comparison may be figurative, employing simile, hyperbole, or spatial metaphor (close to in the sense of ‘similar to’). The COMPARISONREF may even be a desirable or hypothetical/irrealis event or state (It was as it should have been).\nPrototypical prepositions include than, as (including the second item in the as–as construction), like, unlike. Prominent construals are to (GOAL for similarthing) and from (SOURCE for dissimilar-thing).\n4.8 RATEUNIT\nUnit of measure in a rate expression.\nThe prototypical preposition in per:\n(186) a. The cost is $10 per item.\nb. A fuel efficiency of 40 miles per gallon (of gas)\nParaphrase: The adposition can be paraphrased as “for each/every”.\nHistory. In v1, this fell under VALUE.\n4.9 QUANTITY\nSomething measured by a quantity denoted by the governor.\nThe governor may be a precise or vague count/measurement. This includes nouns like “lack”, “dearth”, “shortage”, “excess”, or “surplus” (meaning a toosmall or too-large amount).\nQuestion test: the governor answers “How much/many of (object)?” The main preposition is of. • Simple QUANTITY:\n(187) Pour me a bottle(’s worth) of beer. [but see (169)]\n(188) I have 2 years of training.\n(189) a. I ate 6 ounces a piece of cake.\nb. An ounce of compassion\n(190) There’s a dearth of cake in the house.\n(191) This cake has thousands of sprinkles.\n(192) They number in the tens of thousands.\n(193) a. I have a number handful of students.\nb. I have a lot of students. c. We did a lot of traveling. d. There is a lot of wet sand on the beach.\n(194) A pair of shoes\n• If the measure includes a word like “amount”, “quantity”, or “number”,5\nthe construal QUANTITY;GESTALT is used (because the amount of something can be viewed as an attribute):\n(195) QUANTITY;GESTALT:\na. A generous amount of time b. A large number of students\nBut if “amount”, “quantity”, etc. is used without a measure as its modifier, it is simply GESTALT: see (146d). • If the governor is a collective noun, the construal QUANTITY;STUFF is used (note that a “consisting of” paraphrase is possible):\n(196) QUANTITY;STUFF:\na. Can you outrun a herd of wildebeest? b. Put 3 bales of hay on the truck. c. A group 2 groups A throng of vacationers just arrived.\n• Otherwise, if the object refers to a specific item or set, and the quantity measures a portion of that item (whether a quantifier, absolute measure, or fractional measure), the construal QUANTITY;WHOLE is used:\n(197) QUANTITY;WHOLE:\na. I ate 6 ounces of the cake in the refrigerator. b. I ate half 50% of the cake. c. All/many/lots/a lot/ some/few/both/none of the town’s residents are students. d. I have seen all of the city. (= the whole city)\ne. A lot of the sand on the beach is wet. 5Excluding the expression “a number” meaning ‘several’, as in (193a).\nf. 2 of the children are redheads.\ng. 2 of the 10 children in the class are redheads.\nHowever, simple WHOLE is used if the portion is specified as “the rest”, “the remainder”, etc., as in (150e).\n4.9.1 APPROXIMATOR\nAn “operator” that semantically takes a measurement, quantity, or range as an argument and “transforms” it in some way into a new measurement, quantity, or range.\nFor instance:\n(198) We have about 3 eggs left.\n(199) We have in_the_vicinity_of 3 eggs left.\n(200) We have over 3 eggs left.\n(201) We have between 3 and 6 eggs left.\nSimilarly for around, under, more_than, less_than, greater_than, fewer_than, at_least, and at_most.6\n4.10 SOCIALREL\nEntity, such as an institution or another individual, with which an individual has a stable affiliation.\nTypically, SOCIALREL applies directly to relations between individuals. It does not have any prototypical adpositions. Construals include:\n(202) a. I work with Michael. (SOCIALREL;CO-AGENT)\nb. Joan has a class with Miss Zarves. (SOCIALREL;CO-AGENT)\n(203) a. Joan is the sister wife of John. (SOCIALREL;POSSESSOR)\nb. Joan is a student of Miss Zarves. (SOCIALREL;POSSESSOR)\n(204) Joan is studying under Prof. Smith. (SOCIALREL;LOCUS)\n6These constructions are markedly different from most PPs; it is even questionable whether these usages should count as prepositions. Without getting into the details here, even if their syntactic status is in doubt, we deem it practical to assign them with a semantic label in our inventory because they overlap lexically with “true” prepositions.\n(205) Joan is married to John. (SOCIALREL;GOAL)\nNote, however, that work with is ambiguous between being in an established professional relationship (202a), and engaging temporarily in a joint productive activity:\n(206) I was working withCO-AGENT Michael after lunch.\nIt is up to annotators to decide from context which interpretation better fits the context.\nHistory. Renamed from v1 label PROFESSIONALASPECT, which was borrowed from Srikumar and Roth (2013a,b). The name SOCIALREL reflects a broader set of stative relations involving an individual in a social context, including kinship and friendship. See also note under ORGROLE.\n4.10.1 ORGROLE\nOrganization or institution with which an individual has a stable affiliation, such as membership or a business relationship.\nLike its supertype SOCIALREL, ORGROLE lacks any prototypical adposition, but participates in numerous construals:\n(207) a. the chairman of the board (ORGROLE;GESTALT)\nb. the president of the U.S. (ORGROLE;GESTALT) c. I am a loyal customer of Graeter’s. (ORGROLE;GESTALT) d. employees of Grunnings (ORGROLE;GESTALT)\n(208) Mr. Dursley works for Grunnings. (ORGROLE;BENEFICIARY)\n(209) Mr. Dursley works at Grunnings. (ORGROLE;LOCUS)\n(210) Mr. Dursley is from Grunnings. (ORGROLE;SOURCE)\n(211) Mr. Dursley is with Grunnings. (ORGROLE;ACCOMPANIER)\n(212) Mr. Dursley is employed by Grunnings. (ORGROLE;AGENT)\n(213) I bank with TSB. (ORGROLE;ACCOMPANIER)\n(214) I serve on the committee. (ORGROLE;LOCUS)\nA family counts as an institution construed as a WHOLE (set of its members) or as a LOCUS:\n(215) I am the baby of the family. (ORGROLE;WHOLE)\n(216) people in my family (ORGROLE;LOCUS)\nFor a relation between a unit and a larger institution, use WHOLE:\n(217) the Principals Committee ofWHOLE the National Security Council\nSee also: STUFF\nHistory. ORGROLE is now distinguished within the broader SOCIALREL category following the precedent of the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR; Banarescu et al., 2013, 2015). In AMR, have-org-role-91 captures relations between an individual and an institution (such as an organization or family), whereas have-rel-role-91 is used for relations between two individuals.\n4 References\nLaura Banarescu, Claire Bonial, Shu Cai, Madalina Georgescu, Kira Griffitt, Ulf Hermjakob, Kevin Knight, Philipp Koehn, Martha Palmer, and Nathan Schneider.
