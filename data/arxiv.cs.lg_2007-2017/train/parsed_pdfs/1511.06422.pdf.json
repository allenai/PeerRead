      "text" : "Deep nets have demonstrated impressive results on a number of computer vision and natural language processing problems. At present, state-of-the-art results in image classification (Simonyan & Zisserman (2015); Szegedy et al. (2015)) and speech recognition (Sercu et al. (2015)), etc., have been achieved with very deep (≥ 16 layer) CNNs. Thin deep nets are of particular interest, since they are accurate and at the same inference-time efficient (Romero et al. (2015)).\nOne of the main obstacles preventing the wide adoption of very deep nets is the absence of an efficient, repeatable and general procedure for their end-to-end training. For example, VGGNet (Simonyan & Zisserman (2015)) was optimized by a four stage procedure that started by training a network with moderate depth, adding progressively more layers. Romero et al. (2015) claimed that deep and thin networks cannot be trained, unlike wide nets, by backpropagation if deeper than five layers.\nOn the other hand, He et al. (2015) showed that it is possible to train the VGGNet in a single optimization run if the network weights are initialized with a specific ReLU-aware initialization. The He et al. (2015) procedure generalizes the idea of applying correction coefficient to the output of each layers, introduce for the linear case by (Glorot & Bengio (2010)), to the ReLU non-linearity. Batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy (2015)), a technique that inserts layers into the the deep net that transform the output for the batch to be zero mean unit variance, has successfully facilitated training of the twenty-two layer GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al. (2015)). However, batch normalization adds a 30% computational overhead to each iteration.\nThe main contribution of the paper is a proposal of a simple initialization procedure that, in connection with standard SGD, leads to state-of-the-art thin and very deep neural nets1. This result highlights the importance of initialization in very deep nets. We therefore review the history of CNN initialization in Section 2, which is followed by a detailed description of the novel initialization method in Section 3. The method is experimentally validated in Section 4.\n1The code for reproducing experiments is available at https://github.com/ducha-aiki/ LSUVinit\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 42\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n9 N\nov 2\n01 5"

      "text" : "After the success of CNNs in IVSRC 2012 (Krizhevsky et al. (2012)), initialization with Gaussian noise with standard deviation set to 0.01 and adding bias equal to one for some layers become very popular. But, as mentioned before, it is not possible to train very deep network from scratch with it (Simonyan & Zisserman (2015)). The problem is caused by the activation (and/or) gradient magnitude in final layers (He et al. (2015)). If each layer (not properly initialized) scales input by k, the final scale would be kL, where L - number of layers. Values of k > 1 lead to firing extremely large values on output layers, k < 1 leads to a diminishing signal and gradient.\nGlorot & Bengio (2010) proposed a formula for estimating the standard deviation on the basis of the number of input (and/or) output channels of the layers under assumption of no non-linearity between layers. Despite invalidity of the assumption, Glorot initialization works well for many real cases. He et al. (2015) extended this formula to the ReLU (Glorot et al. (2011)) non-linearity and showed its superior performance for ReLU-based nets.\nThe Hinton et al. and Romero et al. (2015) take another approach and use training to predict teacher predictions and internal representations as better goal than plain softmax loss and good regularization. Srivastava et al. (2015) proposed LSTM-inspired gating scheme to regulate information and gradient flow through network and trained 1000-layers MLP network on MNIST. Basically, this kind of networks learns needed depth for given task.\nThe approach of layer-wise pre-training (Bengio et al. (2007)) which is still useful for multi-layerperceptron, is not popular for training discriminative convolution networks.\nIndependently, Saxe et al. (2014) showed that orthonormal matrix initialization works much better for linear networks, that gaussian noise, which is only approximate orthogonal. It also work for networks with non-linearities."

      "text" : "To the best of our knowledge, there have been no attempts to generalize Glorot & Bengio (2010) formulas to non-linearities other than ReLU, such as tanh, maxout, etc. Also, the formula does not cover max-pooling, local normalization layers Krizhevsky et al. (2012) and other types of layers which influences activations variance. Instead of theoretical derivation for all possible layer types, we propose a data-driven weight initialization.\nWe thus extend the orthonormal initialization Saxe et al. (2014) to an iterative procedure, showed in Algorithm 1. Saxe et al. (2014) could be implemented in two steps. First, fill the weights with Gaussian noise with unit variance. Second, decompose them to orthonormal basis with QR or SVDdecomposition and replace weights with one of the components.\nThe LSUV process then estimates output variance of each layer and scales the weight to make variance equal to one.\nProposed scheme can be viewed as batch normalization performed only on the first batch. Experiments show such normalization is sufficient and computationally highly efficient in comparison with full batch normalization.\nThe LSUV algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. Because of data variations, it is often not possible to normalize variance with desired precision. To eliminate infinite loop, we restricted counter of trials by Tmax.\nWe tested a variant LSUV initialization which was normalizing input activations of the each instead of output one. Normalizing the input or output is identical for nets standard feed-forward nets, but normalizing input is much more complicated for networks with maxout (Goodfellow et al. (2013)) or for networks like GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al. (2015)) which use the output of multiple layers as input. Input normalization brought no improvement of results, when tested against the LSUV algorithm Algorithm 1,\nLSUV was also tested with pre-initialization of weights with Gaussian noise instead of orthonormal matrices. The gaussian initialization led to small, but consistent, decrease in performance.\nAlgorithm 1 Layer-sequential unit-variance orthogonal initialization. L – convolution or fullconnected layer, WL - its weights, BL - its output blob., Tolvar - variance tolerance, Ti – current trial, Tmax – max number of trials.\nPre-initialize network with orthonormal matrices as in Saxe et al.

The gain on the fine-grained CIFAR-100 is much larger than on CIFAR-10. Also, note that FitNets with LSUV initialization even outperform much larger networks with as LargeAll-CNN Springenberg et al.

(2015). The most probable cause is that CNNs toleerate a from a wide variety of mediocre initialization, only the learning time increases. The differences in the final accuracy between the different initialization methods for the FitNet-1 architecture is rather small and are therefore not presented here.\nThe FitNet-4 architecture is much more difficult to optimize and thus we focus on it in the experiments presented in this section.\nWe have explored the compatibility of initializations with different activation functions in very deep networks. More specificly, ReLU, hyperbolic tangent, sigmoid, maxout and the very leaky ReLU (with negative slope equal to 0.333 which is popular in Kaggle competitions Dieleman (2015)).\nTesting was performed on CIFAR-10 and results are in Table 3 and Figure 1. One can see better performance of orthonormal-based methods to the scaled gaussian-noise approaches for all tested types of activation functions, except tanh. Proposed LSUV strategy outperforms orthonormal initialization by smaller margin, but still consistantly (see Table 3). All the methods failed to train sigmoid-based very deep network.\n2 When preparing this submission we have found recent unreviewed paper MIN Chang & Chen (2015) paper, which uses a sophisticated combination of batch normalization, maxout and network-in-network nonlinearities and establishes a new state-of-art on MNIST.\nFigure 1 shows that LSUV method not only leads to better generalization error, but also converges faster for all tested activation functions."
