{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Jun-2017", "title": "Morph-fitting: Fine-Tuning Word Vector Spaces with Simple Language-Specific Rules", "abstract": "Morphologically rich languages accentuate two properties of distributional vector space models: 1) the difficulty of inducing accurate representations for low-frequency word forms; and 2) insensitivity to distinct lexical relations that have similar distributional signatures. These effects are detrimental for language understanding systems, which may infer that 'inexpensive' is a rephrasing for 'expensive' or may not associate 'acquire' with 'acquires'. In this work, we propose a novel morph-fitting procedure which moves past the use of curated semantic lexicons for improving distributional vector spaces. Instead, our method injects morphological constraints generated using simple language-specific rules, pulling inflectional forms of the same word close together and pushing derivational antonyms far apart. In intrinsic evaluation over four languages, we show that our approach: 1) improves low-frequency word estimates; and 2) boosts the semantic quality of the entire word vector collection. Finally, we show that morph-fitted vectors yield large gains in the downstream task of dialogue state tracking, highlighting the importance of morphology for tackling long-tail phenomena in language understanding tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 16:31:20 GMT  (407kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00377v1", "ACL 2017 (Long paper)"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017 (Long paper)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ivan vulic", "nikola mrksic", "roi reichart", "diarmuid \u00f3 s\u00e9aghdha", "steve j young", "anna korhonen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.00377"}
