Yet statistical parsing has focused almost exclusively on bilexical dependencies or domain-specific logical forms. We propose a neural encoder-decoder transition-based parser which is the first full-coverage semantic graph parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). The model architecture uses stack-based embedding features, predicting graphs jointly with unlexicalized predicates and their token alignments. Our parser is more accurate than attention-based baselines on MRS, and on an additional Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) benchmark, and GPU batch processing makes it an order of magnitude faster than a high-precision grammar-based parser. Further, the 86.69% Smatch score of our MRS parser is higher than the upper-bound on AMR parsing, making MRS an attractive choice as a semantic representation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 08:50:15 GMT  (57kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07092v1", "12 pages; Accepted to ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:39:41 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07092v2", "12 pages; ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages; Accepted to ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jan buys", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07092"}
