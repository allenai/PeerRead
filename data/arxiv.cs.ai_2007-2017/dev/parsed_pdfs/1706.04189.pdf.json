      "text" : "An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) should carry out complex tasks in a limited time interval. Since existing AUVs have limited battery capacity and restricted endurance, they should autonomously manage mission time and the resources to perform effective persistent deployment in longer missions. Task assignment requires making decisions subject to resource constraints, while tasks are assigned with costs and/or values that are budgeted in advance. Tasks are distributed in a particular operation zone and mapped by a waypoint covered network. Thus, design an efficient routing-task priority assign framework considering vehicle’s availabilities and properties is essential for increasing mission productivity and on-time mission completion. This depends strongly on the order and priority of the tasks that are located between node-like waypoints in an operation network. On the other hand, autonomous operation of AUVs in an unfamiliar dynamic underwater and performing quick response to sudden environmental changes is a complicated process. Water current instabilities can deflect the vehicle to an undesired direction and perturb AUVs safety. The vehicle’s robustness to strong environmental variations is extremely crucial for its safe and optimum operations in an uncertain and dynamic environment. To this end, the AUV needs to have a general overview of the environment in top level to perform an autonomous action selection (task selection) and a lower level local motion planner to operate successfully in dealing with continuously changing situations.\nThis research deals with developing a novel reactive control architecture to provide a higher level of decision autonomy for the AUV operation that enables a single vehicle to accomplish multiple tasks in a single mission in the face of periodic disturbances in a turbulent and highly uncertain environment. The system incorporates two different\nABSTRACT\nxii\nexecution layers, deliberative and reactive, to satisfy the AUV’s autonomy requirements in high-level task-assign/routing and low-level path planning.\nThe proposed architecture encompasses a Task-Assign/Routing (TAR) approach as a high-level decision maker and a local Online Real-time Path Planner (ORPP) as a lowlevel action generator. This model can simultaneously plan the complete mission by accurate organizing the tasks to ensure a productive mission; while providing dynamic manoeuvre in dealing with uncertain variable environment. The ORPP operates concurrently, back feed the environmental condition to higher level TAR, and system makes decisions according to the raised situation. Static-dynamic current map data, uncertain dynamic-static obstacles, vehicles Kino-dynamic constraints are taken into account. The system has a cooperative and consistent manner in which the higher level mission planner handles mission scenario and gives a general overview of the terrain by cutting off the operating area to smaller beneficial zones for vehicles deployment in the feature of a global route (sequence of tasks).\nOn the other hand, path planning is an excellent strategy for guiding vehicle between two points, which accurately handles environmental changes when operating in a small scale area. Splitting the large area to smaller sections (carried out by higher level) solves the weakness of path planning methods associated with large scale operations. This leads to problem space reduction and significant reducing of the computational burden for the path planning; thus, re-planning a new trajectory requires rendering and re-computing less information.\nNumerical simulations for analysis of different situations of the real-world environment is accomplished separately for each layer and also for the entire ARMSP model at the end. Performance and stability of the model is investigated through employing meta-heuristic algorithms toward furnishing the stated mission goals. It is demonstrated by analysing the simulation results that the proposed model provides a perfect mission timing and task managing while guarantying a secure deployment during the mission.\nNOMENCLATURE\nxiii"

      "text" : "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have proven their capabilities in cost effective underwater explorations up to thousands of meters, far beyond what humans are capable of reaching, and today are the first choice to navigate autonomously and undertake various underwater missions. AUVs are largely employed for purposes such as inspection and survey [1], scientific underwater explorations [2,3], sampling and monitoring coastal areas [4], benthic habitat mapping [5], to measure turbulence and obtain related data [6,7], offshore installations and mining industries [8], and military missions [9]. AUVs generally are capable of spending long periods of time carrying out underwater missions at lower costs comparing manned vessels [10].\nAutonomous operation of AUV in a vast, unfamiliar, and dynamic underwater environment is a complicated process, specifically when the AUV is obligated to react promptly to environmental changes. An AUV thus needs to ensure safe deployment at all stages of a mission, as failure is not acceptable due to the prohibitive recovery and repair costs. On the other hand, diversity of underwater scenarios and missions necessitates robust decision-making based on proper awareness of the situation. A proper awareness of the situation is a key element in the process of decision-making. Hence, an overview of the possible environmental situations has a great impact in enhancing vehicle’s overall autonomy. However, autonomous expectation of AUVs in performing various tasks in dynamic and continuously changing environment is not\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n2\ncompletely fulfilled yet, where it is strongly necessary for the operators to remain in the loop of considering and making decisions [11]. Hence, an advanced intelligence (at the same level as human operator) is an essential prerequisite to compromise the tasks importance and the problem constraints while dealing with the environmental changes. Increasing the levels of autonomy leads to minimizing the reliance on the human supervisor. Development of such self-controlled systems tightly depends on the design of robust mission-motion planning and task allocation scheme. This research aims to increase AUV’s degree of intelligence in both high and low level taskassign/mission and motion planning."

      "text" : "An AUV should carry out complex mission in a confined time. However, it has limited battery capacity and restricted endurance, which these limitations arose the necessity of managing mission time. Obviously, a single AUV is not able to meet all specified tasks in a single mission with limited time and energy. The vehicle has to manage its resources effectively to perform effective and persistent deployment in longer missions without human interaction.\nThe tasks can have different characteristics such as priority value, risk percentage, and absolute completion time, which are known in advance by AUV. Assuming that different tasks are distributed over a specific operation area, they can be mapped by a network in which their start and ending point is presented as waypoints (a sample map is illustrated in Figure 1.1). In this way, the complication of vehicle routing in a graphlike terrain can be addressed straightforwardly.\nTask assignment is a subprocess of routing. Mission planning in this research is presented as a combination of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and task assignment-allocation, presented by Figure 1.2. The VRP is analogous to Traveller Salesman Problem (TSP), which is contiguous sequencing problem in which order of solutions is important. On the other hand, the tasks assignment with time restriction is a discrete (synthetic) natured problem analogous to Bounded Knapsack Problem (BKP), in which combination of the solutions is important. In this respect, mission\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n3\nproductivity and time management is a fundamental requirement towards mission success that tightly depends on the optimality (order and priority) of the selected tasks between start and destination point in a graph-like operation terrain.\nCHAPTER 1.

A vehicle interacts with the environment according to its observation and comprehension from surrounding area to have a safe deployment. The underwater environment can be considered from three different perspectives. First is the known environment. In this category the information about undersea environment and probable possibilities are provided by an offline map and is fed to the AUV beforehand. Second is the partially known environment in which, the vehicle has a general overview of the environment, but the details and unforeseen events remain as a hazy part of the vehicle’s observation. The third category is the unknown environment. In such conditions, the vehicle has no or little information about the surrounding environment and it is expected to observe, find out, categorise and understand the events in order to appropriately interact with the unknown phenomena. To handle the first category (known environment), several artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms such as, Case Based Reasoning (CBR) and Nearest Sequence Matching (NSM) [12-14], have been employed previously. These strategies can help vehicle to use embedded knowledge and taking an action facing similar situation based on previous experiences. This mechanism is\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n5\nhelpful for the vehicle’s interaction with environment and helps it to follow the defined tasks and goals. However, some events do not exist in the vehicle’s experience library especially when the vehicle deals with the unknown or partially known environment. In order to overcome these difficulties, the vehicle should be able to perform motion planning in real-time.\nRecent advancements in sensor technology and embedded computer systems has opened new possibilities in underwater path planning and made AUVs more capable of handling long-range operations. However, there still exist major challenges for this class of the vehicle, where the surrounding environment has a complex spatiotemporal variability and uncertainty. Water currents instabilities can strongly affect its motion and probably push it to an undesired direction. This variability can also perturb AUVs safety conditions [15]. Robustness of AUVs to this strong environmental variability is a key element to carry out safe and optimum operations. Figure 1.3 provides a general understanding of a motion planning system.\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n6\n1.2 Problem Statements and Research Motivation\nConsiderable effort has been devoted in recent years to enhancing AUV’s capability in robust motion planning, vehicle routing and efficient task assignment 1. Although some improvements have been achieved in other autonomous systems, there are still many challenges to achieve a satisfactory level of intelligence and robustness for AUV in this regard."

      "text" : "Effective routing and task priority assigning have a great impact on a vehicle’s time management as well as mission performance by appropriate selection and arrangement of the tasks sequence. The AUV should handle the mission in a bounded time and thus needs to manage its resources effectively to perform resilient operation without human interaction and to succeed in longer missions. This issue tightly depends on optimality of the selected route between start and destination point. On the other hand, quality of vehicle’s deployment is another important consideration to ensure its safety in an uncertain and dynamic environment. A mission planning strategy is capable of organizing tasks in an accurate manner to manage the available time and ensure a productive mission; however, this strategy is not designed for handling prompt changes of the environment, which is a critical concern in underwater autonomous operations.\n1.2.2 Challenges in the Scope of the AUVs’ Path Planning\nThe path planning techniques are specifically designed to deal with quality of vehicle’s motion encountering environmental characteristics and variations. As mentioned earlier, robustness of the trajectory planning to current variability and terrain uncertainties is essential to mission success and AUV’s safe deployment. Existence of a priori knowledge about the variability of the current and the environment facilitates the AUV to minimize the undesirable effects of the environment on its operation. However, present technology is only capable of forecasting limited components of the ocean variability. This limited knowledge about later conditions of the environment\n1. Literature review on the addressed scopes is provided by Chapter 2.\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n7\nreduces AUVs autonomy, safety, and its robustness. The shortcomings with the path planner specifically appears when the AUV is required to operate in a large scale terrain, as it should compute a large amount of data repeatedly and estimate dynamicity of the underwater adaptively. Proper estimation of the underwater behaviour beyond the sensor coverage is impractical and inaccurate. Moreover, path-planning strategies are designed to deal with vehicles guidance from one point to another and do not deal with mission scenario or task assignment considerations."

To fill the gaps of each strategy, the AUV needs to have a general overview of the environment in top level to perform an autonomous action selection (task selection) and a lower level local motion planner to operate successfully in dealing with continuously changing situations. This research aims to address the AUV’s requirements in both high and low level autonomy toward making AUV systems more intelligent and robust in managing its availabilities and adapting to the dynamic environment (pointed out in Section 1.3)."

      "text" : "It is important for an autonomous vehicle to operate successfully in dealing with continuously changing situations. The main goal of AUV operation is to complete mission objectives while ensuring the vehicle’s safety at all times. Appropriate mission planning and path planning strategy along with efficient synchronization between two planners maximizes the achievements of a mission. To this end, following objectives are introduced to furnish the mentioned above expectations:\n1) To develop an appropriate Task-Assign/Routing system:\na. To provide an efficient routing for AUV to take a maximum use of time\nthat battery capacity allows;\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n8\nb. To carry out an accurate task assignment by selecting the highest priority\ntasks with minimum risk percentage fitted to the available time;\nc.

To split the operating area to smaller and more useful zones for path\nplanner;\nd. To compensate any lost time during path re-planning process;\n1.4 Research Assumptions and Scope\nThe AUV is required to complete the maximum possible number of tasks of the highest priority and reach the destination on time, passing through the appropriate sequence of waypoints while considering three-dimensional underwater variations (water current or/and obstacles, etc.), problem constraints (time/battery restriction, collision avoidance constraints, etc.), and restrictions of vehicle’s kinematics. Selecting the sequence of waypoints is a very important issue in saving time and energy and satisfying the task assignment purpose of the mission. The construction of this study is defined in threefold. First attempt will be developing a task-assign/routing framework to find a time efficient route in a graph-like terrain and appropriate arranging the tasks to ensure the AUV has a plenteous journey and efficient timing. In\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n9\nthis framework, the operation network is generated in advance and different tasks are distributed to different parts of the generated map.\nThe second step will be utilizing an accurate and reliable path planning system to provide an overall situational awareness for the vehicle in dealing with unknown and uncertain events. In this framework, the path planner deals with quality and safety of deployment along the split area bounded to distance between waypoints, where persistent variation of the sub-area in proximity of the vehicle is considered simultaneously. To the purpose of this research, static and time-varying current map, kinematic of the AUV, different uncertain obstacles along with real map data are taken into account for modelling a realistic underwater environment and for improving the proposed path planner in handling real-world underwater situations.\nThe third and last endeavour of this study will be developing a modular control architecture with reactive re-planning capability to carry out the underwater missions in a large scale environment in the presence of severe environmental disturbances. The system incorporates two different execution layers, deliberative and reactive, to satisfy the AUV’s autonomy requirements in high-level mission planning and low-level path planning. In this autonomous architecture, the mission-planning framework operates at the top level as a deliberative layer, and the path planning system operates at the lower level as a reactive layer. The path planner operates concurrently and back feeds the environmental condition to higher-level mission planner and system makes decisions according to the raised situation. The operation of each module may take longer than expectation due to unexpected dynamic changes in the environment. In order to reclaim the missed time, an efficacious synchronization scheme (named “Synchron”) is added to the architecture to keep pace of modules in different layers of the system."

      "text" : " The proposed approach in this research is advantageous as it joins two disparate\naspects of vehicle autonomy, combining high-level task organization and self/environment awareness by low-level motion planning.\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n10\n The system has a cooperative and consistent manner in which the higher-level\nmission planner handles mission scenario by tasks priority assignment and gives a general overview of the terrain by cutting off the operating area to smaller beneficial zones for vehicles deployment in the feature of a global route including a sequence of tasks. On the other hand, path planning is an excellent strategy for guiding vehicle between two points, which accurately handles environmental changes when operating in a small-scale area. Splitting the large area to smaller sections (carried out by higher-level mission planner) solves the weakness of path planning methods associated with large-scale operations. This leads to problem space reduction and significantly reducing the computational burden for the path planning; thus, re-planning a new trajectory requires rendering and re-computing less information.\n Parallel execution of the higher and lower level systems speeds up the\ncomputation process, which is another reason for fast operation of the proposed approach, in which total operation time is in the range of seconds that is a remarkable achievement for such a real-time system.\n The performance of the proposed architecture is mainly independent of the\nemployed algorithms by modules, where the use of diverse algorithms (subjected to real-time performance of the algorithm) does not negatively affect the real-time performance of the system.\n The main reason for remarkable performance of this system is the fashion of\nmixing and matching two strategies from two different perspectives and constructing an accurate synchronization between them. A significant benefit of such modular construction is that the modules can employ different methods or their functionality can be upgraded without manipulating the system’s structure. This advantage specifically increases the reusability and versatility of the control architecture and eases updating/upgrading AUV’s functionalities to be compatible with other applications, and in particular implement it for other autonomous systems such as unmanned aerial, ground or surface vehicles.\nCHAPTER 1.

Detailed definitions of task-assign/routing and path planning, research contribution and structure of thesis is provided in this chapter.\nChapter 2 provides a basic definition of autonomy and its dependencies to accurate decision-making and efficient situation awareness. The relation of mission planning as a higher level decision maker and the path planning based on vehicle’s awareness from different situations, will be explained by Sections 2.3 and 2.4, respectively. A principle review of the existing methods for autonomous vehicles’ routing-task assignment problem and state of the art in autonomous vehicles motion (path-route-trajectory) planning will be provided and discussed in this chapter.\nThe mission-planning problem will be discussed and mathematically formulated by Chapter 3. A Task-Assign/Routing (TAR) system will be developed and simulated through a set of given constraints. The TAR system will be tested and evaluated on different graphs of varying complexity applying Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO), Biogeography-Based Optimisation (BBO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.\nChapter 4 provides a definition of the path-planning problem. This chapter mathematically models the underwater environment, optimization criterion and constraints, and the corresponding path-planning problem. Online Real-Time Path Planning (ORPP) system and re-planning based on changing environment will be designed and implemented in this chapter. The performance of the ORPP system in vehicle’s accurate and safe deployment will be examined and validated using Firefly Algorithm (FA), PSO, BBO, and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms.\nSubsequently, Chapter 5 addresses problems and shortcomings associated with each planner by developing a novel Autonomous Reactive Mission Scheduling Pathplanning (ARMSP) architecture with reactive re-planning capability.

      "text" : "AUVs are largely employed for various purposes such as scientific underwater explorations [1], inspection and surveys [2], sampling and monitoring coastal areas [3,4], marine biodiversity mapping [16], offshore installations and mining [9], etc. However, majority of the available AUVs operate with a pre-programmed mission scenario while all parameters for the entire mission should be defined in advance and operator’s interaction is necessary at all stages of a mission. For any of scientific, surveillance, mine, or military applications of AUV, a sequence of tasks is predefined and fed to vehicle through the series of commands (mission scenario) that limits the mission to executing a list of pre-programmed instructions and completing a predefined sequence of tasks. Accordingly, an advanced level of autonomy is an essential prerequisite to trade-off within importance of tasks and problem restrictions. An appropriate higher-level decision maker furnishes the expectation of such autonomy level.\nOn the other hand, safe and reliable deployment and handling uncertainties in constantly changing and complex undersea environments is another aspect of autonomy that needs to be addressed. Unforeseen and unpredictable conditions can enforce the mission to abort. This issue sometimes might even cause the loss of the vehicle, as occurred for Autosub2 that was lost under the Fimbul ice shell in Antarctic [17]. Failure of an AUV is not acceptable due to exorbitant expensive maintenance.\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n20\nUnexpected events may happen when operating within an unknown (partly known) environment and a vehicle must deal with these appropriately. Having a clear picture of the present situation and accurate projection of possibilities are essential requirements for safe operation and effective decision making in such an environment. For this purpose, a high level of Situation Awareness (SA) is required. SA is the process of sensing, comprehending and dealing with extremely dynamic and intricate environments. It is one of the most important factors required for facilitating the next generation of AUVs. The vehicle, thus, collects information from surrounding environment, make decisions based on such information and predefined knowledge. Afterward, it takes actions according to its decisions and then obtain feedback from the environment in response to the specific action, and update its knowledge to produce better decisions in the next step.\nCurrent research aims to develop a comprehensive structure for providing situation awareness in order to promote the autonomous decision making for AUV mission management. To this end, an accurate mission planner and task allocator is developed to carry out the higher-level decision making procedure that increases the productivity of the AUV’s operation and probability of success. On the other hand, for adapting the terrain changes during the operation, a robust motion planning approach is proposed to satisfy the situation awareness requirements of lower level operations. The following definitions are proposed in this study for clarification and to prevent confusion:\nDefinition-1: The mission planning in this study is a joint problem of discrete natured task priority assignment and contiguous natured vehicle routing toward the destination in graph-like terrain.\nDefinition-2: The path (motion) planning is a problem of guiding the vehicle between two specific points while dealing with dynamicity of the underwater environment.\nIn the rest of this chapter the importance of decision making based on situational awareness and its impact on improving vehicles autonomy is going to be discussed in Section 2.2. The relation of decision-making and autonomous mission-motion planning also will be clarified in this section. We are going to talk about what have\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n21\nbeen done for solving these problems (Definitions 1 and 2) in literature. The state of the art in mission planning including autonomous vehicle routing problem, task assignment and also challenges and shortcoming associated with these approaches is outlined in Section 2.3. Section 2.4 outlines the previous attempts in the scope of autonomous vehicles motion planning including path-route-trajectory planning and claims the existing challenges and open problems in this scope. There are several similarities between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) [18], AUVs and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in the context of the mission planning problem (Definition1), and the path planning problem (Definition-2) so we are also going to discuss the way that these problems are addressed in UAV and UGV platforms as well. Section 2.5 presents the chapter’s summary."

      "text" : "There is a big gap between concept of automatic and autonomous operations. In automatic systems, a machine follows programmed commands and it is not able to make a decision. In contrast, autonomous systems have the capability of recognizing different situations and making decision accordingly, without human interaction. Hence, developing more intelligent autonomous systems, which are capable of reconfiguring based on varying situation, and carrying out an efficient mission planning according to new situation, is one of the major fields of interest for many system designers [19].\nAutonomous robotic platforms arouse more interest and broadly used in maritime\napproaches to achieve routine and permanent access to the underwater environment. However, their operations are still restricted to particular tasks with low-level autonomy. AUVs’ communication is restricted by high latency and excessively low bandwidth. Therefore, AUV can communicate to an operator and exchange data only before or after the mission. Hence, the vehicle must be highly intelligent and trustable to carrying out the mission accurately [20].\nA major concern about an AUV is its survivability by protecting itself and recovering from faults (if applicable) as the environment changes, which helps to maintain its\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n22\noperations at a near optimal performance. Highly complex approaches with high levels of autonomy still rely on expert’s observation and control, so the platform always requires the involvement of an expert’s knowledge and suggestions. Therefore, to make AUVs truly reliable and autonomous, more advanced situational awareness is required [21]. For a successful mission, the autonomous system should continuously monitor its resources and reorder the tasks to maximize mission performance during the operation. Thus, the system should dynamically track the available time, the lost time, environmental situations; then it should be able to manage its resources by adjusting its parameters according to the new situation. Consequently, it should reorder the tasks so that to be fitted to total available time for manoeuvre. Most of today AUV applications are supervised from a support vessel, in which an operator provides higher-level decisions in critical situation. This procedure costs highly expensive during a mission (e.g. communication cost, or human precision faults) [22]. Complicated missions that cannot be defined accurately in advance will need to be resolved through intermittent communication with a human supervisor. Undoubtedly, this will restrict the applicability and accuracy of such vehicles. Higher autonomy can improve AUVs’ operation in the following areas:\n Energy consumption: optimize the power sources and vehicle’s power\nconsumption to improve its capabilities in long endurance missions.\n Risk free and optimal navigation: navigating and positioning properly\nwith minimum position calibration error.\n Robust decision making: autonomy in this discipline can be defined as the\ncapacity of sensing, interpreting and acting upon unexpected or unknown changes of environment. An autonomous vehicle should be capable of making efficient decisions when facing different challenging situations.\nAutonomy in decision-making and navigation are connected in various standpoints. An AUV’s capabilities in handling mission objectives are directly influenced by navigation system performance [23]. A fully autonomous vehicle should have capability to consider its own position as well as, its environment, to react properly to unexpected or dynamic circumstances.\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n23\nA growing attention has been devoted in recent years on increasing the ranges of missions, vehicles endurance, extending vehicles applicability, promoting vehicles autonomy to handle longer missions without supervision, and reducing operation costs [8]. Autonomous application of AUVs in performing different tasks in dynamic and continuously changing environment has not yet been completely fulfilled. In its absence, it is imperative for the operators to remain in the loop of considering and making decisions [17]. In addition, many efforts have been devoted in recent years for improving AUVs’ autonomy in mission task assignment, vehicle routing, and path/trajectory planning; however, there are still many challenges on achieving a satisfactory level of autonomy for AUVs in this regard. Accordingly, various methodologies have been discussed and worked out in the literature is divided into the following two disciplines."

      "text" : "(VRP) and Task Assignment Approach (Definition-1)\nEffective mission planning (routing-task assignment) refers to appropriate selection and arrangement of the tasks sequence considering time and other restrictions, which has a great impact on vehicle’s time management as well as mission performance. The task assignment (allocation) involves a constraint decision-making procedures for one or multiple autonomous vehicles and is usually considered as a combinatorial optimization problem [24].\nGenerally, the task assignment can be a sub process in routing or sometimes it can be defined as an individual problem. For example, in a waypoint navigation problem routing procedure’s job is to identify waypoints to derive the vehicle from its current location to destination while the task assignment can be some sub-routines that make sure point-to-point navigation is done appropriately and tasks that are mapped to different geographical areas are completed correctly. The vehicle routing and task assignment problem have been comprehensively investigated on various frameworks and different environments over the last two decades.\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n24\nSeveral strategies have been suggested for single or multiple vehicles routing-task assignment, such as graph matching algorithm [25], Tabu Search (TS) algorithm [26], partitioning method [27], and branch and cut algorithm [28]. Kwok et al., [25] used a graph based approach to maximize the utilization of a group of vehicles with a restricted sensor-coverage and restricted time, in which collaboration of the robots covers the limitation of their sensor-coverage. Higgins [26] applied TS for generalized assignment of 50000 tasks to 40 agents in a large-scale environment, in which the main focus is on controlling the CPU time for the whole process. Liu and Shell [27] also handled the similar challenge introduced in [26] for dynamic task assignment to multiple robots in which the change of location of tasks is managed applying a topdown partitioning strategy; however, solution quality is not perfectly satisfied in the simulation results.\nLysgaard et al., [29] employed branch-and-cut method to manage the cutting planes in a capacitated vehicle routing problem using different capacity criterion. Martinhon et al., [28] proposed a stronger Lagrangian-based K-tree approach for the vehicle routing problem in an undirected graph-like operation field and then applied a variable approximation based on linear programming to reduce the costs; but their proposed method does not appear competitive in computational time and cost evaluation when comparing with the recent branch and cut method in [29]. Zhu and Yang [30] developed an improved Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based approach for multi-robots dynamic task assignment in which the vehicle route planner has been integrated with capability of task assignment. Sanem and Balch [31] presented a generic framework called Distributed and Efficient Multi Robot Cooperation Framework (DEMiR-CF) for distributed task allocation and to cover a complex mission for multi-robots involving simultaneous execution of number of tasks. A special model of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms is proposed by [32] for a road network route planning system taking advantages of Q-value based dynamic programming (QVDP) to solve vehicle delay problems, in which the applied m method provides ability of learning, planning, recognizing different situations, and action selection through the trial and error mechanism; however, consistent information about the correct action is not always available.\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n25\nSadeghi and Kim [33] modelled vehicle route planning with a multi-criteria decision making mechanism and applied a generic ontology-based architecture taking the advantage of an analytic hierarchical process to determine the choice of criteria for applying an impedance function in the route finding algorithm. In the proposed strategy by [33], the domain specific ontology provides foundation for maintaining or extending the domain knowledge. An autonomous goal-based planning approach is presented by Patron and Ruiz [34] using a knowledge based framework, and service oriented architectures. The authors have shown that this methodology enables domain independent planning and capability of discovery for complex missions without experts’ involvement in which the system can handle poor and intermittent communications by predicting the intent of the other platforms to accomplish goal selection [34]. The problem associated with knowledge based (ontology-based) systems is that consistent information about the correct action and environmental situations is not always available.\nDominik et al., [35] implemented a route-plan-decision-maker for multi-agent transportation planning, where routing problem is considered with a specific time windows, cluster-dependent tour starts, and the agent decides between distributing orders to customers, traversing edges, competing vendors, increasing production, etc. The outlined studies [25-35] focused on dividing jobs between multiple robots while they are moving towards a destination point and managing the loose (break down) of any of robots in the group by reassignment of its tasks in to the closest robots; however, in these studies, only it is assumed that the environment is ideal, while there are many other uncertainties and considerations in real world. Certainly, many problems will be revealed when it comes to practical applications especially in the case of autonomous unmanned robots.\nThere have been a number of relevant investigations in the scope of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs) task-target assignment so far. Kingston [36] applied a decentralized algorithm to address task assignment path planning problem for a team of UAVs with moving targets, in which a velocity synthesis algorithm is employed for the purpose path planning. Alighanbari and How [37] presented a combinational approach of Robust Filter Embedded Task Assignment (RFETA) for robust path planning and\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n26\ndynamic task assignment of UAVs operating in an uncertain variable environment where two separate approach is proposed for vehicles’ SA-based task assignment and the path planning-replanning. Kamil Tulum et al., [38] presented a situation aware agent based approach for proactive route planning problem by finding the best order of waypoints for an UAV using A* algorithm for optimizing the distance and battery cost over the large scale operation network. This approach highlighted the relation between route planning and situation awareness; however, in this research only a restricted tactical situations are considered that is not sufficient to furnish all real world possibilities. The technique needs a pre-computation to analyse the situation due to high computational cost of the applied A*, which is a substantial deficiency for a realtime platform.\nTheopisti and Richards [39] used a modified Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for handling both task allocation, task loitering, and route planning for multiple UAVs. A multiple UAVs’ cooperative task assignment problem is efficiently addressed by Tao et al., [40] applying an improved ACO, where a task tree is applied to carry out the decision process of choosing the tasks. Kulatunga et al., [41] also introduced a solution for simultaneous task assignment and route planning of multi automated guided vehicles applying an ACO based meta-heuristic algorithm, in which ACO based approach compared with exhaustive search mechanism for small size problem to evaluate performance of the ACO in this research. Acknowledging the relevant studies in the scope of ground and aerial vehicles, the mission management becomes even further challenging considering the severity and uncertainties of underwater environment.\nThe underwater environment is generally a vast 3D area, which is rarely populated with obstacles and sparsely known in advance [23]. The challenges associated with such an uncertain environment becomes even greater in long range missions with enlargement of the operation area. Robustness of AUV to strong environmental variability is a key element to mission performance and safe deployment. Restrictions of priori knowledge about later conditions of the environment reduces AUVs autonomy and robustness.\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n27\nIn the scope of underwater operations, Karimanzira et al., [42] presented a behaviourbased controller coupled with waypoint tracking scheme for an AUV guidance in large-scale underwater environment. Yan et al., [43] developed an integrated mission planning strategy to serve the AUVs’ routing problem, while minimising total energy cost in the presence of ocean currents. Later on the proposed method in [42] is generalized by Iori and Ledesma [44] for double vehicle routing problem with multiple stacks and the AUV routing problem is modelled with a Double Traveling Salesman Problem with Multiple Stacks (DTSPMS) for a single-vehicle pickup-and-delivery problem. They studied the performance of three branch-and-cut, branch-and-price, and branch-and-price-and-cut algorithms on a wide family of benchmark test samples with different graph complexities. Chow [45] proposed an approximated algorithm based on k-means method to address task assignment problem that minimizes the travel time for multiple AUVs considering presence of constant ocean current. The approach combined the AUV dynamic model with adjusted Dubins model including ocean currents for route planning and to control the AUVs to move along the route with a constant velocity with respect to the kinematics constraint of AUVs. However, the problem is considered in a 2-D environment that would be problematic when the method is applied to accomplish the similar task in 3-D environment. Moreover, they considered a static ocean current rather than the variable current, which is not prevalent in real world application.\nLater on, Zhu et al., [46] integrated improved self-organizing map (SOM) neural network with a velocity synthesis approach for solving multiple AUVs’ dynamic task assignment and path planning problem. They considered multiple target locations in a 3-D environment in presence of dynamic current. Although the approach in [46] is capable of keeping an AUV on the desired track during the mission, but the environment is assumed ideal, while there are many other uncertainties and considerations in real world, such as static or moving obstacles and so on. Williams [47] developed an adaptive track-spacing algorithm for an AUV optimal route planning approach used in mine countermeasures mission in which the operation is framed in terms of maximizing underwater mines detection. No on-board processing\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n28\ncapability is incorporated in the route planning resulting in non-adaptiveness of the approach to dynamic changes.\nThe AUV’s routing-task assignment problem has a combinatorial nature analogous to both TSP-BKP, and categorized as a Non-deterministic Polynomial-time (NP) hard problem. Many knowledge based strategies, deterministic algorithms and graph search methods have been introduced for solving the vehicle routing or task assignment problems, as mentioned above. The deterministic methods produce better quality solutions; however, these algorithms are computationally complex [48]. Therefore, they are not appropriate approaches for real-time routing applications, especially when the search space is large or the operating network is topologically complex [48]. In contrast, the meta-heuristic methods take less computation time and obtains optimal or near optimal solutions quickly.\nSeveral studies also investigated the advantages of meta-heuristics methods on vehicle routing and task assignment. A comparative Dijkstra-GA approach is used by Sharma et al., [49] to address the vehicle routing problem in a graph like operation network. The evaluation results affirmed that both algorithms provided same solution but with different execution time as Dijkstra’s is time-consuming comparing to GA.\nA large scale route planning and task assignment joint problem related to the AUV activity has been investigated by M.Zadeh et al., [50] transforming the problem space into a NP-hard graph context. The approach used heuristic search nature of Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) and GA to find the best waypoints for AUV task assignment and risk management joint problem in a large-scale static terrain. Later on, the approach was extended by M.Zadeh et al., [51] to be implemented on semi dynamic network by taking the use of Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. The merit of the proposed solution by [50,51] is that being independent of the graph size and complexity.\nAs a modern heuristic algorithm, ACO is also widely used to solve combinatorial task assignment and routing problems. The real-time performance of the application is usually overshadowed by growth of the graph complexity or problem search space. Growth of the search space increases the computational burden that is often a\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n29\nproblematic issue with deterministic methods such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) proposed by Yilmaz et al., [52] for governing multiple AUVs. The meta-heuristic algorithms offer near-optimal solutions in faster time and with better scalability with number of tasks comparing to deterministic method such as MILP. The MILP is inaccurate in large sized problems as its computational time increases exponentially with the problem size. Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 survey different methods suggested for various autonomous aerial, ground, surface and underwater vehicles.\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n32\nAn important issue with all studies outlined in this scope is that they mostly focus on routing problem for different unmanned vehicles in which task assignment is the principle direction of these papers and quality of deployment (motion) and uncertainty of the environment have not been addressed. The vehicle’s safe and confident deployment in hazardous underwater environment is a critical factor that should be taken into consideration at all stages of the mission."

The route planning system should direct vehicle(s) to a predefined destination while providing efficient manoeuvres and managing the travel time. Effective routing has a great impact on vehicles time management as well as mission performance by appropriate selection and arrangement of the tasks sequence. Some open problems in this regard are pointed as follows:\n The real-time aspect of a route planner is extremely critical to satisfy time\nconstraints of the critical-time missions and to provide online redirection of the AUV. The complexity of the graph topology or in general problem space results extensive computational burden. Developing a fast and efficient mission planning approach for satisfying the real-time requirements of an autonomous operation is still an open area for research.\n A route or a task sequence should be generated during the mission as the vehicle\nproceeds through the dynamic environment. Majority of previous attempts resulted in developing offline mode of route planning solutions also known as pregenerative strategies.

Complicated missions such as logistic applications of an AUV, arise requisition for advance mission scheduling and task organizing strategy to maximize productivity of the mission in a restricted period of time. The system’s productivity relies on a number of factors such as vehicles autonomy in decisionmaking based on raised situation, real-time performance of the applied method to reschedule the mission if required, battery capacity and resource management. So having an intelligent mission planner for fully autonomous operations of AUVs is another area of interest for further research that is not perfectly fulfilled yet.\n The majority of research mentioned is particularly focused on task and target\nassignment and time scheduling problems without considering requirements for vehicle’s safe deployment or quality of its motion in presence of environmental disturbances. As AUV operates in an uncertain environment, there is a huge amount of uncertainty in the travel times that can have a devastating effect on mission plans and mission time. Proper time management is necessary to ensure on-time mission completion and consequently the mission success. To improve mission reliability and performance, and to avoid mission failure, environmental risks and factors should be considered at all stages of the mission for having a safe and confident deployment in a vast and uncertain environment. Therefore, in the next subsection, existing AUV trajectory/path planning approaches (Definition-2) are discussed, which are more concentrated on vehicles deployment encountering dynamicity of the ocean environment.\nCHAPTER 2.

Proper and realistic modelling of the environment, having practical assumptions, and selecting efficient searching strategy are main steps of each motion planning approach. The first step toward achieving a satisfactory operation is to find a suitable and efficient method of path planning. In general, the challenges associated with path planning can be considered from two perspectives; firstly, the motion planning methodologies being utilized (subsection 2.4.3), and secondly the competency of the techniques for real-time applications (subsection 2.4.4).

There are popular techniques for connecting the defined control points namely: Straight-line method [56], which is not flexible enough to provide a smooth transition in linkage of piece lines; Dubins categories of paths [57] that intercalate circles around the connections so that the path gets smoother in connections of control points. This method caught much interest in mobile robot path planning and it is widely used in past decade [58-60]. The Dubins-based methods are criticized for their high computational cost, which defects the real-time performance of the system especially in path re-planning process [61].\nAnother popular category of path construction methods is the spline and piecewise polynomial strategy that use just a few variables of control points’ peculiarities to construct a very flexible path curve. Obviously, dealing with small number of variables boosts the computation speed and eases the optimization process. This method is modified to be more efficient and proposed in different sub-groups such as Cubic\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n35\nHermite Spline [62]; B-splines [63-65].

Usually, travelling time and distance, minimum energy consumption, or in some cases safety options get used as important criteria for evaluation of the optimal path [68, 69].\nMany attempts have been devoted in recent years and different techniques have been suggested for autonomous robots’ motion planning. The efficiency of the path planning techniques involves two perspectives: first the techniques that mostly emphasize on optimality and resolution of the solutions; and second group of techniques majorly focus on producing feasible and probabilistically near optimal solutions with minimum computational cost.

      "text" : "Point of View\nSolutions proposed for motion planning can be categorized in to two main groups of: A) classical and graph (grid) based technique; and B) artificial intelligence and evolutionary algorithms based techniques [70].\nA) Classical and Graph Search Techniques\nThe motion planning approaches that are based on graph search techniques use a discrete optimal planning on a graph-like search space [71]. To apply graph search techniques on path planning problem, regarding the discrete nature of these algorithms, the search space should be decomposed to grid-shape or transformed to a graph format [72]. The nature of these algorithms are well suited on vehicle routing problems in which the default form of the search space is a weighted directional or bidirectional graph [72].\nVarious graph search algorithms like Dijkstra, A* or D* algorithms have been applied to the autonomous vehicles path planning problem in recent years [72-78]. In this group of algorithms, the heuristic function estimates the best cost solution and the algorithm keeps track of the solutions to determine the best possible cost equal to the estimated cost. To apply these algorithms on path planning problem, first the search space should be decomposed to a graph feature to specify the collision boundaries and forbidden sections, and then the path is produced by patching the free sections based on defined cost function.\nThe Dijkstra algorithm is a popular and efficient method for shortest path computation and graph routing problems. Eichhorn [79] implemented graph-based methods for the AUV ‘‘SLOCUM Glider’’ routing in a dynamic environment. The author employed modified Dijkstra Algorithm where the applied modification and conducted time variant cost function simplifies the determination of a time-optimal route in the geometrical graph. The Dijkstra algorithm calculates all applicable paths from the start point to the destination, so it takes long time to get to the appropriate answer when the graph size or the problem search space increases; so a large amount of computations\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n37\nare required to be repeated. This issue makes the Dijkstra computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications [49, 80].\nA* is categorized as a best-first heuristic search method and acts more efficiently because of its heuristic searching capability [74]. Carroll et al., [75] presented the operation space with quad trees and applied A* to obtain efficient paths with minimum cost. Fernandez et al., [76] and Pereira et al., [77] utilized A* method to provide a time optimal path with minimum risk for a glider path planning according to an offline data set. Pereira et al., [72] developed an A* based Risk-aware path planning method for AUVs operation in a high boat traffic areas applying current prediction models. The A* method also suffers from expensive computational cost in larger search spaces.\nD* algorithm (a variation of A*) is an alternative for AUV’s path planning problem. D* operates based on a linear interpolation-based strategy and allows frequently update of heading directions [78]. D* is incapable of posing considerable improvement on the A* computational complexity in high-dimensional problems [80].\nThe Fast Marching (FM) algorithm is another derivative of the A* approach proposed to solve the AUV path planning problem that uses a first order numerical approximation of the nonlinear Eikonal equation. Petres [81] suggested FM algorithm to capture a time optimum path taking current field and dynamic environment into account. FM is accurate but also computationally more expensive than A* [81]. An upgraded version of FM known as FM* or heuristically guided FM is employed for AUV path planning problem [82]. The FM* keeps the efficiency of the FM along with the accuracy of the A* algorithm, but it is restricted to the use of linear anisotropic cost to attain computational efficiency. Improved version of the FM* also has been developed applying the wave front expansion to determine the time optimum path from vehicles start point to the destination [83-85].\nThe grid-search-based methods are criticized due to their discrete state transitions, which restrict the vehicle’s motion to discrete set of directions. The grid-based strategies are also inefficient in cases that workspace is too large or complex. In such problems the number of cells comprehensively increases, therefore rendering of the data and solutions becomes intractable. On the other hand, graph-based techniques,\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n38\nwhich are very popular, usually look for the shortest route between two points in a network (graph). The main drawback of these methods is that their time complexity increases exponentially with increasing problem space, which is inappropriate for realtime applications. These methods are time consuming because of redundant computations. Reaching to a reasonable solution takes too long due to several recalculations of the criteria on each iteration and usually in these types of optimizers, many iterations are required, therefore computing an effective path becomes a very time consuming task [86].\nFor a group of problems in which the deterministic techniques and heuristic-grid search approaches are not capable of satisfying real-time requirements, the artificial intelligence and evolution-based methods are good alternatives with fast computational speed, specifically in dealing with multi-objective optimization problems.\nB) Artificial Potential Field Method\nOne popular approach suggested by many researches to deal with complexity of path planning problem is the Artificial Potential Field (APF) method that keeps the vehicle from crossing the collision boundaries by defining artificial potential fields for each obstacle in the terrain. This method is applied on the multi-AUV motion-planning problem where static obstacles have been considered to test the collision avoidance applicability of the method; nevertheless, static obstacles are not sufficient to model the real underwater hazardous environment [87]. The APF is also applied by Witt and Dunbabin [88], Warren [89] and Karuger et al., [90] for AUV path planning problem using a combinatorial cost function for collision avoidance involving decision factors of time, distance, collision regions, and energy consumption. Cheng et al., [91] utilized APF and velocity synthesis method for AUV path planning problem considering ocean current variations. The [91] did not consider the dynamic changes of the environment including variations of dynamic and moving obstacles. Although APF is fast, cost effective, and computationally efficient, but it produces locally optimal solutions. It is computationally inexpensive and by nature capable of handling any dynamic\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n39\nenvironment. APF does not always satisfy the shortest path criterion. It will guarantee to reach to the destination if there is not time restriction.\nC) Evolutionary Algorithms\nEvolution-based or in general the meta-heuristic algorithms are another set of approaches utilized successfully in path planning problem. Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are efficient methods in dealing with path planning problems of an NP-hard nature. For the AUV path-planning problem in a large-scale operation area, satisfying time/energy and collision constraints is more important than providing exact optimal solution; hence, having a quick acceptable path that satisfies all constraints is more appropriate rather than taking a long computational time to find the best path. Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are capable of being implemented on a parallel machine with multiple processors, which can speed up the computation process; hence, these methods are fast enough to satisfy time restrictions of the realtime applications [92].\nMeta-heuristics and evolution-based path planning also catch a lot of interests in recent years. In [68], a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is utilized by Alvarez et al., to determine an energy efficient path for an AUV encountering a strong time varying ocean current field and a grid partitioning method is applied on the search space to avoid convergence to local cost minima. Rubio and Kragelund used GA for UAVs’ optimal path re-planning according to prediction of wind velocities, in which a combination of fuel consumption characteristics and desirable relative wind speed been used in cost calculation to reduce the fuel consumption for the entire mission [93]. Zhu and Luo used an improved GA to address the shortest path problem as a combinatorial optimization problem, where the Dijkstra algorithm is applied as a local search operator to generate local shortest path trees that improves the performance of the individuals in the population [94]. Later on, an improved version of GA called Improved Niche Genetic Algorithm (INGA) is employed for carrying out the real-time route planning of a group of UAVs in a 3D environment [95]. The \uD835\uDEFF-field perturbation operator has been used to improve the local search capabilities of INGA and also\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n40\nadaptive k-means analysis method as a crowding strategy is used to generate coverage paths in the area of interest.\nRoberge et al., [92] developed an energy efficient path planner using meta-heuristic search nature of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, where timevarying ocean current is encountered in the path planning process. GA and PSO share a similar population-based search mechanism in which a set of probabilistic and deterministic rules are applied to enhance the solutions’ quality. PSO differs from GA in the sense of having a stochastic evolution mechanism that does not guarantee the best fitted solution while GA incorporates this problem using mutation and crossover operators. PSO retains particles in each iteration and just adjust their characteristics applying update rules on their velocities and positions to best fit them to the cost function. Further comparison of PSO and GA can be found in [96]. Zamuda et al., [97] also applied a Differential Evolution (DE) based path planner for underwater glider for opportunistic sampling of dynamic mesoscale ocean structures considering dynamic ocean structure.\nThe main drawback of the evolutionary algorithms is that they may quickly converge to a suboptimal solution. Although suggested evolution based approaches properly satisfy the path planning constraints for autonomous vehicles, AUV-oriented applications still require improvements."

      "text" : "View\nThe underwater environment poses several challenges for AUV deployment such as varying ocean currents, no-fly zones, and moving obstacles, which usually may not be fully known and characterized at the beginning of the mission. Obstacles may appear suddenly or change behaviour as the vehicle moves through the environment. Water current may have positive or disturbing effects on vehicle’s deployment, where an undesirable current is a disturbance itself and it also can push floating objects across the AUV’s path. However, in most research the hydrodynamic effects of underwater environment and AUV’s limited turning ability is ignored or not sufficiently\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n41\nconsidered [98-100].\nCurrent flow sometimes can be very strong that cannot be controlled by the actuator of the AUV, so that avoidance of such zones would be necessary for safe deployment. Ignoring the water current has detrimental effect on fuel consumption and even may cause serious risks for vehicle’s operation. The vehicle should be autonomous enough to cope dynamic changes over the time while it is continuing its mission objectives. Spatio-temporal wave front and sliding wave front expansion algorithm with a contiguous optimization technique has been employed by Thompson et al., [101] and Soulignac et al., [83,84] for AUVs path planning in presence of strong current fields. These methods are capable of providing optimum path for AUV according to some specific requirements and assumptions and use previous information for re-planning process, which is computationally reasonable in generating accurate local trajectory. Nevertheless, this strategy may not be appropriate in dynamic environments where the current field updates continuously during the operation. The first online obstacle avoidance is developed by [102] for path planning of a remotely operated underwater vehicle based on real-world dataset captured by multi-beam forward looking sonar. Gautam and Ramanathan [103] proposed a path planner for SLOCUM Glider operations in near-bottom ocean, in which the path planner is simulated using Qlearning technique and biologically-based GA, ACO, PSO algorithms. Despite of using realistic information, capacity of these approaches in online path planning and simultaneous mapping is not substantiated.\nThe recent investigations on path planning encountering variability of the environment have assumed that planning is carried out with perfect knowledge of probable future changes of the environment [104, 105], while in reality, environmental events such as current’s prediction or obstacles’ state variations are usually difficult to predict accurately. Ocean currents also show great variability over such durations in a large operation field. Even though available ocean predictive approaches operate reasonably well in small scales and over short time periods, they are not sufficiently accurate over long time periods in larger scales [72]. Fu et al., [106] employed Q-PSO for UAV’s path planning and obtained satisfactory outcome in this regard. However, Fu\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n42\nimplemented only off-line path planning in a static and known environment, which is not enough for representing a real world environment. Later on, the Q-PSO algorithm has been employed by Zeng and colleagues [107,108] for AUVs on-line path planning in dynamic marine environment.\nTo deal with challenges of large-scale operations, Zhang [109] investigated the hierarchical global GA based path planning approach for AUVs, which relies on decomposition of the operational environment and searching for the best path at each level. Sequeira and Ribeiro, [110,111], decreased the operational search space to a graph with limited connected nodes known as obstacle regions, in which sea currents considered in a simplistic fashion as static current with constant velocity and direction. This study [111] assigned energy costs as weight to graph edges and applied Dijkstra algorithm to address the AUV’s motion planning with minimum energy cost taking undesired current correlation in to account.\nGarau et al., [112] proposed similar consideration but restricted to motion on a 2D environment where the operation area is divided into a large and abrupt grid of connected nodes assigned with energy cost. In [112], the energy cost is calculated with respect to journey time assuming constant motion speed. Afterward, A* search algorithm is used to find the minimum cost route in the graph. Although the satisfactory results are obtained from this simulation, however, a 2D representation of a marine environment does not sufficiently embody all the information of a 3D ocean environment and vehicle motion with six degrees of freedom. Moreover, the applied method in [112] does not consider using desirable currents for vehicles motion, which is important for prolonging mission lifetimes.\nAn advanced path planning should be able to generate energy efficient trajectories by using desirable current flow and avoiding undesirable current. Desirable current can propel the vehicle on its trajectory and leads saving more energy. This issue considerably diminishes the total AUV mission costs. The importance of the ocean current in saving energy was emphasized by Alvarez et al., in which a GA based path planning was investigated for finding a safe path with minimum energy cost in a variable ocean. An A* based path planer is used by Koay and Chitreaiming to find path\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n43\nwith minimum energy consumption considering varying ocean current [113]. A nonlinear least squares optimization technique is employed by Gonzalez et al., for AUV path planning to suggest the time-optimal trajectory taking changing current into account [114]. Later on, an offline pre-generative motion planning strategy based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is proposed by Ataei et al., for a miniature AUV in 3D underwater environment [115]. They considered the path planning approach as multi objective optimization problem encountering four criteria of length of path, motion planer smoothness, margin of safety and gradient of diving. However, the proposed offline motion planner in [115] gets in to serious difficulties when the environmental situations are updated and re-planning is required.\nAlthough useful meta-heuristics have been suggested for autonomous vehicles path planning, AUV-oriented applications still has several difficulties when operating across a large-scale geographical area. The computational complexity grows exponentially with enlargement of search space dimensions. A huge data load from whole environment should be analysed continuously every time that path re-planning is required, which is computationally inefficient. Table 2.3 and Table 2.4 present survey results for the different methods proposed for AUV path planning and replanning problems.\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n46\n2.4.5 Open Problems of AUVs’ Motion Planning Approach\nA remarkable effort has been devoted in recent years to improve the level of autonomy for AUVs motion planning and extending their capability for longer operations. The previous section has discussed the current state of the art in the AUV guidance and motion-planning problem. The important issues with current AUV path planners and also critical hints for improving the level of autonomy in motion planning are concluded below:\n The existing planning studies in AUV platform are predominantly concentrated\non short-range local path planning in small-scale areas. Widening of the operating range, however, is intertwined with the appearance of new complexities, for instance propagation of uncertainty and accumulation of data that turns the underwater mission to a challenging scenario. Only a limited number of previous studies addressed the problems of long-range autonomous motion planning either in terms of vehicle routing in a graph-like network or in the path-trajectory planning. Previous emphasizes mostly approach this problem by reducing complexity of the network by setting small number of nodes (waypoints) or 2D implementation of the operation field. The problems associated with each assumption is discussed earlier in Section 2.4.3 and 2.4.4.\n Usually information about obstacles’ characteristics (position, velocity) is not\ncertain and perfect. An obstacle’s position or velocity may change over time or may appear suddenly during vehicle’s deployment. Obstacles may drift by current force or may have a self-motivated speed and direction. The moving obstacles also can be categorized as intelligent agents so that in such a case prediction of its behaviour would be impractical. Hence, to carry out collision avoidance in such an uncertain environment the vehicle requires real-time capability of path computation. Moreover, current variation can change the behaviour of moving obstacles over the time. Therefore, proper estimation of the behaviour of a largescale dynamic uncertain terrain, far-off the sensor coverage is impractical and unreliable, so any pre-planned trajectory upon predicted maps may change to be invalid or inefficient.\nCHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\n47\n The computational complexity grows exponentially with enlargement of search\nspace dimensions. This becomes even more challenging in longer missions, where a huge load of data about update of whole terrain condition should be computed repeatedly. This huge data load should be analysed continuously every time that path replanting is required. This process is computationally inefficient and unnecessary because awareness of environment in vicinity of the vehicle such that it can react to the changes, is enough.\n With respect to optimization algorithms, obtaining the optimal solutions for NP-\nhard problems is a computationally challenging issue and it is difficult to solve in practice. Bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms are diverse nature-inspired algorithms and are known as new revolution in solving complex and hard problems due to stochastic and/or deterministic nature of these algorithms. However, comparing the previously applied optimization algorithms for the purpose of AUVs’ motion planning is difficult as each of them addresses a specific aspect of this problem. Undoubtedly, there is always a significant requirement for more efficient optimization techniques in autonomous vehicle’s motion planning problem.\n There are several publications in the area of AUV path planning; however only a\nlimited number of them addressed convincing field trail results of AUVs operation in an uncertain time varying ocean environment. Thus, judgment about efficiency and reliability of the developed technologies in dealing with dynamic ocean environment is difficult and yet is dependent to complex considerations and evaluations.\n The majority of stated motion planners did not accurately address the re-planning\nprocedure as there is a significant difference between off-line operation and online motion planning. Operating in a dynamic environment requires an on-line motion planner to perform prompt reaction to raised changes. Despite some studies that addressed this issue, on-line path re-planning in longer-range operations is computationally complex due to repeated computation of a large data load.\nCHAPTER 2.

Unlike to path planning strategies, the mission planner is not designed to the purpose of copping environmental dynamic changes. However, it is capable of giving general overview of the area that AUV should fly through (general route), which means cut off the operation area to smaller beneficent zone for vehicle’s deployment that leads a remarkable reduction of computational load.

Respectively, this research contributes a novel Autonomous Reactive Mission Scheduling and Path-planning (ARMSP) architecture encompassing a Task-Assign/Routing (TAR) approach (discussed in Chapter 3) and local Online Real-time Path Planner (ORPP), given in Chapter 4, to cover shortcomings associated with each of the above mentioned strategies. This architecture contains both high-level decision making and low-level action generator, and it can simultaneously organize the mission and improve the vehicle’s manoeuvrability that results increasing autonomy for operating in a cluttered and uncertain environment and carrying out a time-efficient fruitful mission. Parallel execution of the TAR and ORPP speed up the computation process.\nThe operating field for operation of the ORPP is split to smaller spaces between pairs of waypoints; thus, re-planning a new trajectory requires rendering and re-computing less information. This process leads to problem space reduction and reducing the computational burden, which is another reason for fast operation of the proposed approach, in which total operation time is in the range of seconds that is a remarkable achievement for such a real-time system.\n50\nChapter 3"

However, today’s AUVs’ endurances still remain restricted to short ranges due to battery restrictions. In this context, a vehicle’s autonomy is strictly tied to accurate mission planning and its ability in prioritizing the available tasks in the bounded time that battery capacity allows, while the vehicle is concurrently guided towards its final destination in a complex terrain that is often modelled in a graph-like way. This problem is thus a combination of the BKP (binary knapsack) and TSP (traveling salesman) problems.\nThe mission planner aims to select the best order of tasks to effectively use the available time for a series of deployment in a long mission, which tightly depends on the optimality of the selected route between start and destination in a waypointcluttered terrain. Therefore, the vehicle starts its mission from a particular point and it should reach to the destination point after meeting adequate number of waypoints.\nMaking use of the meta-heuristic advantages in solving NP-hard graph problems, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithms are\nCHAPTER 3.

The meta-heuristic algorithm seeks for highest priority of tasks between the staring and destination point so that the metrics of optimality for the generated route are satisfied.\nTo evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach, the performance of the method is examined under a number of Monte Carlo runs. Simulation results clearly confirm that the generated mission plan is feasible and reliable enough, and applicable for an uncertain undersea environment. This process is implemented as an independent component named (Task-Assign/Mission-Planner) TAR that operates concurrently in the top layer of the architecture and synchronous to other components (more information about the architecture and other components are given in the Chapters 4 and 5). Figure 3.1 illustrates the operation diagram for the completed section (TAR block) in this chapter.\nCHAPTER 3.

Accordingly, the operating area is mapped with undirected connected weighted network denoted by G = (P, E), where P is the vertices of the graph that corresponds to waypoints and E denotes the edges of the graph in which some of the edges are assigned with a specific task, formulated as follows:\n   \n \n 1 )100,0(U~\n)10000,0(U~\n1001000010000:\n, ;,...,:)(\n;,...,:)( ),(\n,,\n,\n3\n1\n1\n\n\n \n \nMapp p\np Pp\nppe eeGE\nppGP\nmE\nkP EPG\ni\nzyxi z\ni\nyxi\nzyxD\njiij\nm\nk\n(3-2)\nwhere, k and m are the number of nodes (P) and edges (E) in the graph (G); pix,y,z is the position of an arbitrary node of the graph; eij is the edge between two nodes of pix,y,z and pjx,y,z.

The AUV is expected to visit certain points and to perform certain time dependent tasks (such as measuring sea water salt, mapping, taking pictures of underwater structure, or ecosystem), either during its travers towards those points or when it reached to them.\nFor mission planning, the autonomous vehicle needs to perceive the elements in the variable environment, comprehend the relation between perceived information and meaning of different raised situation in order to compute an optimum global route. It will use prepared information about terrain, waypoints, vehicles limitations, and environmental restrictions to compute the most appropriate route for AUV’s mission from start point to the destination.

      "text" : "The fundamental problem of an AUV system is how to find an optimum sequence of tasks considering tasks priority, hazard percentage, battery sufficiency and time efficiency within a bundled time to battery capacity. From SA point of view, some concepts should be considered regarding mission planning problem, such as “what to search?”. The second problem that should be investigated is “How to search?”. In this section, it is necessary to define some boundaries for the problem based on its important criteria to limit the search space and solutions to more specific borders. It will help in reducing the initial search space to a more reliable and feasible state that is very helpful in saving time and energy. As discussed previously, the environment is modelled by a graph including several nodes and connections in which some of the connections corresponds to a specific task. Tasks should be selected and ordered in a feasible feature using prior information of tasks and terrain and then are fed to the algorithm as the initial population. The following criteria assesses feasibility of generated solutions:\n1) Valid solution is a sequence of nodes (a route) that commenced and ended with\nindex of the predefined start and destination points.\n2) Valid solution does not include non-existent edges in the graph. 3) Valid solution does not include a specific node for multiple times, as multiple\nappearance of the same node implies wasting time repeating a task.\n4) Valid solution does not traverse an edge more than once. 5) Valid solution has total completion time smaller than the maximum range of\nmission available time.\nThe employed strategy for finding valid routes to given criteria greatly affects performance of the solutions and feasibility of the search space. Hence, a prioritybased strategy is conducted by this research to generate feasible solutions (routes), in which a randomly initialized vector is assigned to sequence of nodes in the graph. Adjacency information of the graph and provided random vector is utilized for proper node selection. The random vector is initialised with positive or negative values in the specified range of [-200,100], where each element of the vector corresponds to existing\nCHAPTER 3. AUV TASK-ASSIGN/ROUTING (TAR)\n57\nnodes in the graph. Afterward, nodes are added to the sequence one by one according to the values of the vector and adjacency connections. Visited nodes get a large negative value that prevents repeated visit of them. The traversed edges of the graph are eliminated from the adjacency matrix. This process reduces the time and memory consumption, especially when routing in large graphs. Figure 3.3 illustrates a hypothetical example of this process.\nFigure 3.3 presents an example of the route generating process according to a sample Adjacency matrix (Ad) of a graph and a random vector (Ui). To generate a feasible sequence in a graph with 18 nodes based on topological information, the first node is selected as the start position. Then from the Adjacency matrix, the connected nodes to n: 1 are considered. In graph shown in Figure 3.3, this sequence is {2,3,4,5}. The node with the highest value (from Ui) in this sequence is selected and added to the sequence as the next visited node. This procedure continue until a legitimate route is built (destination is visited). This process greatly affects performance of the solution and feasibility of the search space.\nCHAPTER 3.

The problem involves multiple objectives that should be satisfied during the optimization process. One approach in solving multi-objective problems is using multi-objective optimization algorithms. Another alternative is to transform a multiobjective optimization problem into a constrained single-objective problem.

The ViolTAR is the penalty value assigned to the mission route planner to prevent solutions from overstepping the time threshold T∇. The search space is initialized with feasible task sequences in format of global route from start to target point. To fulfil the objectives of the proposed model and solving the stated problem (explained by (3-5)), four popular meta-heuristic optimization algorithms of GA, PSO, ACO, and BBO are applied.

Former methods to solve VRP or task assignment problems (discussed in Chapter 2) require considerable computational efforts and tend to fail when the problem size grows. Previous approaches to this problem emphasize reducing the complexity of the network by setting small number of nodes (waypoints), assigning small number of edges with limited number of parameters and considerations, and then searching the resultant sparse network for finding the shortest route to the destination using different methods. In contrast, the presented strategy in this research do not require such simplification or discretization of the operation space.\nUnlike previous research on vehicle routing problems, which mostly look for the shortest possible route in a graph, this study aims to complete the maximum number of tasks for which time and distance are a function of the individual task. On the other hand, while various exact techniques have been developed over three last decades, meta-heuristic methods still remain as the most appropriate selections in real time applications with larger dimensionality. Generally, evolutionary algorithms and intelligent optimization methods have less sensitivity to size of graph so the search\nCHAPTER 3.

These algorithms are easy to implement and they are more flexible for being implemented on a parallel machine with multiple processors, which speeds up the computation process [92]. A significant distinction exists between theoretical understanding of meta-heuristics and peculiarity of different applications in contrast. This gap is more highlighted when scale (size), complexity, and nature of the problem is taken to account. Application of different optimization methods may result in diverse performances on the same problem due to specific nature of each problem. Therefore, accurate selection of the algorithm and proper matching of the algorithms functionalities and characteristics in accordance with the nature of a particular problem is a highly critical issue that should be taken into account in advance. These facts usually remain unaddressed and unsolved in most engineering and robotics frameworks in both theory and practice. Often, metaheuristic algorithms require careful and accurate modifications to appropriately accommodate a specific problem.\nWith respect to the combinatorial nature of routing and mission planning problem, which is analogous to TSP-BKP problems, this problem is categorized as a multiobjective NP-Hard problem often solved by optimization algorithms [99,116]. Obtaining the optimal solutions for NP-hard problems is a computationally challenging in practice. Obtaining the exact optimum solution is only possible for the certain cases with no uncertainty; which is not the case in this study. Meta-heuristics are appropriate approaches suggested for handling the aforementioned complexities.\nUndoubtedly, there is always a significant requirement for more efficient optimization techniques in autonomous vehicle’s mission planning problem. To fulfil the objectives of this study towards solving the stated problems, this study presents its solution by applying heuristic search nature of the GA, PSO, ACO, and BBO algorithms.\nThis chapter aims to investigate efficiency of any applied meta-heuristic algorithm for vehicles prompt route-mission planning as this approach would be foundation for the next two chapters, which is about building a hierarchal control architecture to handle environmental prompt changes along with efficient task-time management.

This algorithm is has proven very successful in solving vehicle routing problems and is scales well for task assignment due to its discrete nature [118-120]. On the other hand, the PSO is one of the most flexible optimization methods for solving a variety of complex problems and widely used in several studies in the past decades. The PSO is well adapted to multidimensional space and nonlinear functions due to its stochastic optimization nature that does not require any evolutionary operators to transmute the individuals. Due to flexible design of the PSO, it can be easily modified to fit the problem while when using DE or GA or ACO, the problem formulation should be modified to fit the way these methods formulate their evolution. GA is also a stochastic search algorithm that operates based on biological evolution and has been extensively studied and widely used on different realms of graph routing problems and similar applications [49, 50]. The GA also has a discrete nature and is well fitted with the proposed problem. The BBO is another evolutionary technique developed according to equilibrium theory of island biogeography concept [121]. The population of candidate solutions in BBO is defined by geographically isolated islands known as habitat. A special feature of the BBO algorithm is that the original population never is discarded but are modified by migration. This issue improves the exploitation ability of the algorithm.\nSeveral cost factors such as route length, travel time, task priority and task specific metrics are considered to be minimized or maximized simultaneously in order to make maximum use of the mission available time. As an AUV operates in an uncertain environment, there is a huge amount of uncertainty in the travel time that can have a devastating effect on mission plans. Proper time management of the vehicles routing operations is necessary to ensure on-time mission completion and consequently the mission success. Accurate coding of the initial population is the most important step\nCHAPTER 3. AUV TASK-ASSIGN/ROUTING (TAR)\n62\nin implementing all evolutionary algorithms.

Second benefit of these algorithms is their ability of handling non-linear cost functions. As mentioned earlier, obtaining a near optimal solution in faster computation time is more important for the purpose of this research where the modelled environment corresponds to a spatiotemporal time varying terrain with high uncertainty. The real-time performance of the applied algorithms on TAR approach is not fully known; hence, the computation time would be one of the important performance indicators for evaluating the applied methods. The TAR module in this research uses prepared information about terrain, waypoints location, tasks that are assigned to network’s adjacent connections and their characterizations, and time/battery restrictions to compute the most appropriate order of prioritized tasks to guide the AUV towards its destination. There should be a compromise among the mission available time, maximizing number of highest priority tasks, and guaranteeing reaching to the predefined destination before the vehicle runs out of battery/time. All algorithms are configured with tmax=100 iterations. In the ACO, the population is set to 70 ants. The pheromone value is initialized with τ0=1.5, the pheromone exponential and heuristic exponential weights are initialized with 1.5 and 0.9, respectively. The pheromone and heuristic factors are updated iteratively according to αt=0.99×αt-1 and βt=0.99×βt-1. The evaporation rate is assigned with 1.8. The BBO, in this circumstance, is configured with habitat population size of 70; the emigration rate, immigration rate, and maximum mutation rate are set on μ=0.2, λ=1μ, and m(S)=0.5, respectively. The GA is configured with population size of 70, crossover rate of 0.99, mutation rate of 0.8 and selection pressure of 8. The PSO is configured by 70 particles, acceleration coefficients of 1.5 and 2. The inertia weight is set to be decreased iteratively according to ω=(tmax -t)/tmax (where, tmax is the maximum number of iterations and t is the current iteration).\nCHAPTER 3. AUV TASK-ASSIGN/ROUTING (TAR)\n71\nThe problem is defined as a constraint routing in a graph-like terrain including waypoints (nodes) and connections in which each connection represents a task. Therefore, increasing number of tasks means increasing quantity of connections and nodes in the network, which means increasing the problem’s complexity (as commonly known in graph search problems like TSP). The CPU time and cost variations of the applied methods are investigated on different network topologies, in which network complexity and size increases incrementally from 30 to 150 nodes (waypoints), presented by Figure 3.4. With respect to the defined cost function for the mission planning problem (given by (3-5)), an optimum solution corresponds to a mission that takes maximum use of available time by maximizing number of completed tasks and route weight, while respects the upper bound time threshold denoted by T∇.\nCHAPTER 3. AUV TASK-ASSIGN/ROUTING (TAR)\n72\nAs presented in Figure 3.4, the employed algorithms accurately manage the complexity growth as the cost value for all graph topologies lies in the similar range over 100 iterations and the computational time increments linearly with growth of the graph nodes. The CPU time for all samples remained within the bounds of a suitable real-time solution.\nThe cost and CPU-Time variations declares that the performance of the model is almost independent of both size and complexity of the graph, whereas this is recognized as a problematic issue in many of the outlined approaches.\nAccordingly, performance of the ACO, BBO, GA, and PSO algorithms is investigated in a quantitative manner through the 150 Monte Carlo simulation runs (given by Figure 3.5 to 3.7). By analysing the result of the Monte Carlo simulations, it is possible to be confident in the robustness and efficiency of the method in dealing with random transformation of the graph size and topology.\nIn the performed simulation, number of vertexes of the graph is set to differ between 30 to 50 nodes, connection between nodes and overall graph topology is randomly changed (using a Gaussian distribution) on the problem search space in each execution. The time threshold is set on 3.42×104 (sec).\nCHAPTER 3. AUV TASK-ASSIGN/ROUTING (TAR)\n73\nCHAPTER 3. AUV TASK-ASSIGN/ROUTING (TAR)\n74\nFigures 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 compare the functionality of the applied algorithms in dealing with problem’s space deformation. It is apparent from CPU-Time variations in Figure 3.5 that all algorithms are capable of satisfying real-time requirement of the proposed problem as the variation for all algorithms is drawn in a very narrow boundary in range of seconds; however, the fastest operation belongs to GA and then PSO, BBO, and ACO, in order.\nThe appropriate case for the TAR approach is producing routes with maximum travel time limited to threshold. It is denoted from route time variations in Figure 3.5, all algorithms significantly manage the route time to approach proposed time threshold, but it seems that GA acts more cautious in constraining the route time as the variation range for GA is strictly kept far below the defined threshold. However, variations of PSO, BBO, and ACO almost placed in a same range, but no outlier is seen in PSO route time variations, which is good point for this algorithm.\nFigure 3.6 illustrates the stability of the TAR in terms of completed tasks and total obtained weight for each algorithm. It is apparent in Figure 3.6 that variation range for total obtained weight and completed tasks by GA appeared in a smaller range in comparison with outcome of others respecting the narrow range of GA route time. Three other algorithms of BBO, ACO and PSO propose almost similar performance\nCHAPTER 3. AUV TASK-ASSIGN/ROUTING (TAR)\n75\nin quantitative measurement of two significant mission metrics of route obtained weight and number of covered tasks; however, being more specific, BBO acts more efficiently as the produced results by BBO dominates two others.\nA solution gets a penalty value of ViolTAR, when the route time oversteps the total mission available time T∇. Figure 3.5 presents average variations of route cost and violation over the 150 Monte Carlo simulations. It is noteworthy to mention, the route cost is varying in a similar range for all four algorithms, almost between 0.57 to 0.62, and it is noted that average variation of route violation for Monte Carlo executions approaches zero. This confirms efficiency of the applied algorithms in satisfying\nCHAPTER 3. AUV TASK-ASSIGN/ROUTING (TAR)\n76\ndefined constraints for TAR and they are persistent against problem space deformation, as this is a challenging problem for other deterministic algorithms addressed earlier. Being more specific, the provided results also shows that the GA reveals better performance in eliminating the route violation. To compare applied meta-heuristic methods, a benchmark table is employed as presented in Table 3.1, which gives a summary of the characteristics of four aforementioned algorithms that quantitatively analysed by Figures 3.5 to 3.7.\nThe ACO and PSO has a similar feature in which both of them use three principals of the transient state, local and global updates. Local updating in ACO preserves the quality of the population in each iteration so it requires less iterations to converge the population toward the optimum solution. However, both PSO and ACO face the stagnation problem when the swarm quickly is stuck in a local optimum; hence, the algorithm is not able to promote solution quality as time progresses. The particle or ant swarm will eventually find an optimal or near optimal solution despite no estimate can be given on convergence time. The ACO also shares the similar shortcoming with the GA algorithm as there is no guarantee in random method for fast optimal solutions even though GA select a proper population at each iteration. Moreover, when complexity of graph increases the length of chromosomes or solution vectors is increased accordingly, so that mission-planning process becomes slower; nevertheless, all aforementioned algorithms operate in a competitive CPU time unlike the deterministic and heuristic methods. Hence, the evolutionary algorithms are suitable to produce optimal solutions quickly for real-time applications. Compared performance of four applied algorithms in routing and mission planning process declares the superior performance of BBO comparing others; however, there is only a slight difference between the produced results.\nCHAPTER 3.

Realistically, it is impossible for a single vehicle to cover all tasks in a single mission in a large-scale operation area. Reaching to the destination is another critical factor for the mission planner that should be taken into consideration. All tasks are distributed in the operating field and mapped in the feature of a connected network, in which some edges of the network are assigned by tasks. The tasks should be prioritized in a way that selected edges (tasks) of the network can govern the AUV to the destination. Hence, the TAR tends to find the best collection of tasks and order them in a way that AUV gets guided to the destination while it is respecting the upper time threshold (mission available time) at all times during the mission. The problem involves multiple objectives that should be satisfied during the optimization process.\nIn this chapter, a mission-planning model is introduced for AUV task assign-routing employing different evolutionary optimization algorithms, which provides a comprehensive control on mission timing, multitasking in a waypoint cluttered underwater environment to maximize productivity of a single vehicle in a single mission within a limited time interval. This approach operates at the higher level to compromise among the mission available time, maximizing number of highest priority tasks, and guaranteeing reaching to the predefined destination, which is combination of a discrete and a contiguous optimization problem at the same time (analogous to both TSP and BKP NP-hard problems). Relying on competitive performance of the meta-heuristic algorithms in handling computational complexity of NP-hard problems, different meta-heuristic methods including BBO, ACO, GA, and PSO are carefully chosen and configured according to expectation from the corresponding problem; and then used to evaluate the TAR model in finding correct and near optimal solutions in competitive time (real and CPU). The performance and stability of the model in satisfying the metrics of “obtained weight”, “number of completed tasks”, “mission cost” and “total violation of the model” is investigated and analysed in a quantitative\nCHAPTER 3.

The study aims to prove the robustness of proposed model employing any sort of algorithms with realtime performance, rather than criticizing or comparing efficiency of the applied algorithms. Relying on analysis of the simulation results, all algorithms reveal very competitive performance in satisfying addressed performance metrics. Variation of the computational time for operation of all algorithms is settled in a narrow bound in a range of seconds that confirm accuracy and real-time performance of the system. Independent of the type of meta-heuristic algorithm applied in this chapter, the proposed framework is able to achieve the mission objectives toward task-time management; and carrying out beneficial deployment for a single vehicle operation in a restricted time. The concept of this chapter is work out and published through two conference papers (Appendices A and B).\nThis framework is a foundation for improving vehicle’s autonomy in higher levels of decision making in prioritizing tasks, time management, and mission managementscheduling, which are core elements of autonomous underwater missions. However, underwater environment poses a considerable variability and uncertainty. The proposed mission planning strategy, however, is not designed efficient for the purpose of handling environment sudden changes, but it gives a general overview of the area that an AUV should fly through (general route), which means reducing the operation area to smaller operating zone for vehicle’s deployment. Thus, another benefit of such a planner is reducing the run time by splitting the operation terrain to smaller zones for the vehicles operation. The environmental risks and factors such as time-varying ocean currents, diverse static and dynamic obstacles, and uncertainty of the operation terrain should be considered when planning a transit path in smaller scale. The importance of this issue is investigated through the next chapter.\n79\nChapter 4"

It represents the possibilities for vehicles deployment during a mission in presence of different disturbances, which is a complicated procedure due to existence of the inaccurate, unknown, and varying information. Recent advancements in sensor technology and embedded computer systems has opened new possibilities in underwater path planning and made AUVs more capable for handling complicated long range underwater missions. However, there still exist major challenges for this class of the vehicles, where the surrounding environment has a complex spatiotemporal variability and uncertainty. Ocean current variability affect vehicle’s motion positively or negatively. This variability can also have a profound impact on vehicle’s battery usage and its mission duration. Current variations over time can affect moving obstacles (or waypoints in some cases) and drift them across a vehicle’s trajectory; therefore, the planned trajectory may change and become invalid or inefficient. Proper estimation of the events in such a dynamic uncertain environment in long-range operations, outside the vehicle’s sensor coverage, is impractical and unreliable. The robustness of a vehicle’s path planning to this strong environment variability is a key element to its safety and mission performance. AUV-oriented applications still have several\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n80\ndifficulties when operating across a large-scale geographical area in which a large data load of variation of whole terrain condition should be computed repeatedly any time that path replanting is required. This process is computationally inefficient and unnecessary as only awareness of environment changes in vicinity of the vehicle is enough. Figure 4.1 illustrates the operation diagram of this chapter.\nPath planning is a complicated multi-objective NP-hard problem that has a great impact on vehicle’s overall autonomy. Currently there is no polynomial time algorithm to handle a NP-hard problem of even moderate size. Furthermore, finding a pure optimum solution is only possible when the environment is fully known and no uncertainty exists. The modelled underwater environment in this chapter corresponds to a highly dynamic uncertain environment. To satisfy the addressed challenges of the path planning (discussed in Chapter 2) in a time-varying underwater environment, this chapter proposes an online real-time path planning strategy that improves a vehicle’s ability to cope with local environment changes. Although the solutions proposed by any meta-heuristic algorithm do not necessarily correspond to the optimal solution, it\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n81\nis more important to control the time, and thus relying on the previously mentioned ability of meta-heuristic algorithms, four evolutionary methods namely PSO, BBO, Differential Evolution (DE), and Firefly Algorithm (FA) are employed in the core of the proposed local path planner to find correct and near optimal solutions in competitive time (real and CPU). In this chapter, the environment is modelled to be more realistic comprising uncertainty of moving, floating/suspended objects and dynamic multiple-layered time varying ocean current. Accordingly, the path planner is facilitated with dynamic re-planning capability.\nThe objective is to synthesize and analyses of the performance and capability of the mentioned methods for guiding an AUV from an initial loitering point towards the destination point through a comprehensive simulation study. The proposed planner module entails a heuristic for refining the path considering situational awareness of environment. The planner thus needs to accommodate the unforeseen changes in the operating field such as emergence of unpredicted obstacles or variability of current field and turbulent regions. Thereafter, using a penalty function, an augmented cost function embodied all constraints is made by defining the loitering and target points as boundary conditions; static and moving obstacles as path constraints; bounds on the vehicle states associated with the limits of vehicle actuators.\nThe chapter is organized as follows. Modelling of underlying operating environment including the obstacles and current vector field is described in Section 4.2. The path planning problem formulation, mathematical model of the vehicle together with the mechanism of the online path planner are explained in Section 4.3. An overview of the utilized evolutionary methods and their implementation for the path-planning problem is discussed in Section 4.4. The discussion on simulation results are provided in Section 4.5.

To cluster the coastal areas and authorized water zones (allowed for deployment) into separate regions, k-means clustering method [125] is employed. K-means is usually applied for partitioning a data set into k groups. The method is initialized as k cluster centres and the clusters are then iteratively refined.

The utilized clustering method is capable of clustering any alternative map very efficiently in a way that the blue sections sensed as water covered zones and other sections depending on their colour range categorized as forbidden and uncertain zones. The map analysis in this study is assumed in a 2-dimensional scale, in which depth of water is not considered in the map clustering process.

The current field used in study is computed from a random distribution of 50Lamb vortices in a 350×350 grid within a 2D spatial domain according to the pixel size of the clustered map. In order to change the current parameters, Gaussian noise, in a range of 0.1~0.8, is randomly applied to update current parameters of Sio, ℓ, and ℑ given in (4-5) to (4-8).\nConfiguration of the utilized method is given below. Four different scenarios are introduced in this chapter to evaluate the performance of the applied evolutionary methods on online path planning process.\n PSO: The PSO is initialized by 100 particles (candidate paths).

The damping factor of δ is\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n102\nassigned with 0.95 to 0.97. The scaling variations is defined based on initial randomness scaling factor of α0. The parameter of randomization is set on 0.4.\n DE: Population size is set on 100, lower and upper bound of scaling factor is set\non 0.2 and 0.8, respectively. The crossover probability is fixed on 20 percent.\nMaximum number of iterations is set on tmax=100 for all algorithms. Finally, number of the path control points (ϑ) for each B-Spline path is set on 7. For the purposes of this study, the optimization problem was performed on a desktop PC with an Intel i7 3.40 GHz quad-core processor in MATLAB® R2016a.\nScenario 1: Path Planning in Spatiotemporal Ocean Flows\nTo investigate the performance of the proposed online path planning strategy, the ocean environment is modelled as a three-dimensional volume Γ3D covered by uncertain time varying ocean currents. The update of operating field includes changes in the current behaviour, continuously measured from the on-board sonar and horizontal acoustic Doppler current profiler (HADCP) sensors.\nFigure 4.7 represents the performance of the path planners in adapting ocean currents that varies within 4 time steps (various updating rate) once the AUV starts to travel from a waypoint on a loitering pattern (shown with a red circle) toward the target position (indicated by a yellow square). In this scenario, the variability of the current field is illustrated through four subplots in Figure 4.7 labelled by Time Step 1-4. The time step (time interval) for current update is determined by division of the number of iterations to current update rate (URC=4) that is initialized by the operator. In order to change the current parameters, Gaussian noise, in a range of 0.1~0.8, is randomly applied to update current parameters of Sio, ℓ, and ℑ given in (4-5) to (4-8).\nFrom Figure 4.7, it is apparent that the generated path between the starting point (red circle) and the final position (yellow square) adapts the behaviour of current in all time steps. By changing the current map, the new information of spatiotemporal current flow, collected by HADCP, is fed to the online path planner module. As can be seen\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n103\nin each mentioned subplot, the proposed path planner autonomously adapts current variations and generates a refined path that can avoid severely adverse current flows and can take advantage of favourable ones to speed up the vehicle’s motion. Being more specific in comparing the generated paths, obviously the FA method shows better performance in making use of favourable current flows.\nIn the second rank, the path generated by BBO shows significant flexibility in coping with current change specifically when the current magnitude gets sharper (more clear in turbulent given in Time Step: 3). Figure 4.8 demonstrates the variation of fitness value and the rate of solution convergence for the all evolutionary methods through this scenario. As can be seen, the convergence rate of the PSO is quite moderate and the rest of three methods are roughly identical in finding the optimal solution.\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n104\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n105\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n106\nIt is noteworthy to mention that setting lower rate for Gaussian noise parameter (i.e., in range of 0.1 to 0.8) applied to the current vector field parameters, leads towards better fitness values for the generated paths by all four algorithms. Moreover, by setting higher current update rate (where Gaussian noise parameters get greater value than 0.8), the path fitness value reduces and practically other conditions remaining constant in path execution process. Thus, in a dynamic path planning, the probability of path failure increases when the current field updating rate get significantly greater value than the path updating rate.\nScenario 2: Path Planning in a Cluttered Field with Variable Current Flow and Static Obstacles\nIn this scenario, the operating field is cluttered with the static obstacles, randomly distributed in the problem space. The variability of the current vector field is the same as the Scenario 1. In Figure 4.9(a), the planner module generates the candidate path considering the underlying current map and obstacles’ situations toward the final target position. The current map is updated in the location where the position of the vehicle is shown by the yellow triangles; these changes are obvious in Figure 4.9(b). The thin curves in Figure 4.9(b) indicate the offline initial paths generated by the proposed methods (before updating the current map), and the refined paths (online paths), are clearly shown by the thick curves in Figure 4.9(c). The utilized FA, BBO, PSO and DE algorithms are capable of generating a collision free path against the distribution of obstacles. Here again, the re-planning procedure is helpful to refine the offline path that may have not been tailored for the vehicle operation in the variable ocean flows.\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n107\nFigure 4.10 indicates the performance of the proposed methods in finding the optimal solution considering the augmented objective function in (4-17).\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n108\nReferring to Figure 4.9, it is apparent that the initial produced path by all algorithms adapts the behaviour of current and accurately handles obstacle avoidance. Being more specific, the FA shows better performance in adapting adverse or concordant current arrows and take shortest path comparing to others. As presented in Figure 4.9(b-c), the proposed online path planner is capable of re-generating the alternative trajectory according to latest update of current map, in which the regenerated path takes a detour taking the advantages of previously generated optimum path data and the desirable current flow to speed up and save more energy in its motion toward the destination. Further, it is noted from Figure 4.9(b-c) the path generated by FA shows its superior flexibility in coping with current change specifically when the current magnitude gets sharper. The path re-planning procedure reuses the history of previous paths (online re-planning) to achieve more optimized path. As can be seen in Figure 4.10, the initial solutions generated by the evolutionary methods are different, as a result of different natures and mechanisms. However, they all are capable of searching the optimization space and converge to the best possible minima. Referring to collision violation plot,\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n109\nFigure 4.10, it can be inferred that applying the re-planning strategy around 20th iteration, the violation value decreases to a great extent and at the end there is no violation over the obtained solution.\nScenario 3: Path planning in a Cluttered Field with Variable Current Flow, Uncertain Static/Moving Obstacles\nThis scenario becomes more challenging as we add the uncertain static and moving obstacles to the variable spatiotemporal current field. In Figure 3.11, the collision boundaries represented as green spheres around the obstacles computed with radius Θr~2σo indicating a confidence of 98% that the obstacle is located within this area, referring to the equations mentioned in Section 4.2.2. The obstacles employed in this\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n110\nscenario are generated with random position by the mean and variance of their uncertainty distribution and velocity proportional to the current velocity. The uncertainty over the both static and moving obstacles are linearly propagated relative to the updating time and leads to the radius growth of the static obstacles and simultaneous position and radius changes in the moving obstacles. These variations are measured using on-board sonar sensors.\nFigure 4.11 illustrates 3D-path generated by the evolutionary methods for the scenario at hand. In this figure, for having a clear visualization, just the final refined path is indicated. As can be seen in this figure, due to the linear propagation of the uncertainty with time, there exist a collision boundary encircling the objects. The safe trajectory is achieved if the vehicle manoeuvre does not have any intersection with the proposed obstacle boundary. The utilized evolutionary path planners are able to generate a collision free path that can satisfy the conditions of the proposed problem. This fact is indicated in Figure 4.12, showing the expedient convergence rate of the methods in finding optimal solution and sharp convergence rate of collision violation, as iteration goes on.\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n111\nScenario 4: Path planning in a highly uncertain realistic operating field\nIn the last scenario, the goal is to thoroughly simulate a highly uncertain cluttered realistic operating field including all possible barriers to assess the performance of the online path planner. In this scenario, the clustered map is used as an underlying environment embodied with variable ocean flows and uncertain static and moving obstacles. The coastal areas on the map are treated as no-fly zones and the planner should be aware of them. These zones in a context of offline obstacles are fed to the planner module. Although the problems complexity increases by encountering different environmental uncertain factors, it is derived from Figure 4.13 all aforementioned algorithms are able to produce efficient path to avoid collision and to adapt current variations.\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n112\nThe AUV starts to transmit from the red circle indicated on Figure 4.13 and its transition is indicated by yellow triangles. The expected time for passing this distance is assumed TƐ=1800 (sec). The AUV water-reference velocity is set on υ=2.5 (m/s). For the current flow, the vortexes radius (ℓ) and strength parameters (ℑ) are set on 2.8 m and 12 m/s, respectively [108]; the uncertain static and moving obstacles follows the same concept used in the previous scenario. No collision will occur if the trajectory does not cross inside the collision boundaries of obstacles or coastal areas on the map. The collision boundaries represented as black circles around the obstacles indicating a confidence of 98% that the obstacle is located within this area. The gradual increment of collision boundary of each obstacle is presented in Figure 4.13 in which the uncertainty propagation is assumed linear with time.\nFigure 4.13 (Time Step: 1) shows the first path generated by the evolutionary methods. The yellow triangles indicate the place where the current vector field is updated and the planner uses the new situational awareness of the environment to refine the previous path. It is noteworthy to mention that the path generated by DE, indicated by red dash line, does not collide with the neighbour coast at the start of the mission. The uncertainty of the obstacles can be clearly seen in the subsequent Time Step: 2-4. It is obvious form Figure 4.13, by increasing the complexity of the problem, all the evolutionary path planners still generate safe collision free paths satisfying the conditions of the proposed path planner.\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n113\n(a)\n(b)\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n114\n(c)\n(d)\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n115\nFigure 4.13. The path behaviour and re-planning process in a more complex scenario encountering different uncertain dynamic-static obstacles and current update in 4 time steps. Figure 4.14 demonstrates the final path time achieved by the evolutionary path planners. As can be seen, the final time is different stemming from the inherent differences in structure and mechanism of the proposed methods; however, all of them properly satisfy the assigned upper time threshold of TƐ. The associated variations of the performance index and collision violation per iteration are depicted in Figure 4.15. Again, the convergence rate of collision violation to zero is sharp due to the nature of online planning strategy. It is derived from simulation results in Figure 4.13, there is only slight difference comparing the results produced by all four algorithms and all of them accurately avoid crossing into the coastal sections of map even when the disturbing current pushes the vehicle to the undesired directions in the given operation window.\nFigure 4.14. Performance of the algorithms for time optimality criterion.\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n116\nThe cost variations of all four algorithms (given by Figure 4.15(a)) declares that the FA shows superior performance in reducing the cost within 100 iterations, while the DE and PSO do this process almost in a same accuracy. After all, BBO shows the lowest efficiency, despite its starting point even stands in a lower value C℘≈1.2 comparing others.\nIt is also noted from variation of the collision violation in Figure 4.15 (b), the violation of all four algorithms diminishes iteratively, but again the FA shows the best performance in managing solutions toward eliminating the violation.\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n117\nOn the other hand, the B-spline paths’ curvature is obtainable by the vehicle’s radial acceleration and angular velocity constraints. Hence, the behaviour of the produced path curves by FA, DE, BBO, and PSO algorithms in satisfying the vehicular constraints is presented through the Figure 4.16 and 4.17.\nCHAPTER 4.

Considering the iterative variations of surge, sway, yaw and theta rates corresponding to path splines produced by FA, BBO, DE, and PSO from the simulation given by Figure 4.17, it is evident that all generated paths accurately satisfy the defined constraints as the produced error-bars are bounded to specified violation boundaries presented with the red dashed line.

      "text" : "Efficient motion planning is identified as a critical factor to enhance vehicle’s autonomy and its resistance against various disturbances. This chapter aims to develop and evaluate an Online Real-time Path Planner (ORPP) as the lower level autonomy provider. The path planning is an NP-hard optimization problem in which the main goal is to minimize the path length, avoid crossing collision borders, and coping current variations over the time. On the one hand, existence of moving obstacles may lead to change the path conditions, as time goes on, and on the other hand, variability of ocean current components has considerable impact in drifting the vehicle from target of interest. In such a situation, adaptability of the path planner to environmental variabilities is a key element to carry out the mission safely and successfully. An efficient trajectory produced by the path planner enables an AUV to cope with adverse currents as well as exploit desirable currents to enhance the operation speed that results in considerable energy saving. To have an expedient adaptation with the variations of the underlying environment, an accurate online re-planning mechanism is developed and implemented. We mathematically formulate the realistic scenarios that AUV usually is dealing with in a large-scale undersea environment. This provides with use of a real map containing current and obstacles information; furthermore, the uncertainty of environment and navigational sensor suites are carefully taken into\nCHAPTER 4. AUV ONLINE REAL-TIME PATH PLANNING\n123\naccount by simulating imperfectness of sensory information in dealing with different types of moving objects. The path planner designed in the proceeding research simultaneously tracks the measurements of the terrain status and tends to generate the shortest collision-free trajectory by extracting eligible areas of map for vehicles deployment, carrying out obstacle avoidance and coping water current disturbance. The proposed planner is capable of refining the original path considering the update of current flows, uncertain static and moving obstacles. This refinement is not computationally expensive as there is no need to compute the path from scratch and the obtained solutions of the original path is utilized as the initial solutions for the employed methods. This leads to reduction of optimization space and accelerate the process of searching, therefore the optimal solution can be achieved in a fast manner. Having significant flexibility for approximating complex trajectories, B-Spline curves are utilized to parameterize the desired path. Applying the evolutionary methods namely PSO, BBO, DE, and FA indicate that they are capable of satisfying the path planning problem’s conditions. The combination of meta-heuristic B-Spline technique provides an effective tool to solve the AUV’s path planning problem. Considering the results of simulation, performance comparison between all applied methods is undertaken.\nFrom the simulation results given by Section 4.5 it can be concluded that all FA, DE, BBO and PSO based path planner perform with almost similar cost and great fitness encountering collision constraints and all other constraints for the corresponding numbers of iteration. In addition, they remarkably satisfy the time optimality condition that is expressed by a time threshold in this study, and constraints over the corresponding states due to the physical limitations of the vehicle. From comparison point of view, the utilized evolutionary methods generate slightly different solutions due to the inherent differences in their nature and mechanism. More specifically, in this study, the FA planner shows better performance in terms of making use of favourable current flow for AUV manoeuvrability and collision avoidance. In terms of satisfying the time optimality condition, the performance of the PSO and DE path planner is better. In summary, the simulation results confirm that the proposed online planning approach using all four meta-heuristic algorithms are efficient and fast\nCHAPTER 4.

The concept of this chapter is work out and published trough one conference and one journal papers (Appendices C and D).\nIn the next chapter, a consistent architecture will be designed to increase the autonomy in both high-level decision-making and low-level action generator by simultaneous mission scheduling (ordering the tasks), optimizing the vehicle’s manoeuvrability to provide a safe and efficient deployment.\n125\nChapter 5"

      "text" : "Providing a higher level of decision autonomy is a true challenge in development of today AUVs and promotes a single vehicle to accomplish multiple tasks in a single mission as well as accompanying prompt changes of a turbulent and highly uncertain environment, which has not been completely attained yet. Today’s AUVs operation still remains restricted to very particular tasks with restricted autonomy due to battery restrictions that necessitate them to manage endurance times. Improving the levels of autonomy facilitates the vehicle in performing long-range operations with minimum supervision in severe unknown environment. The proceeding approach builds on recent two chapters (Chapters 3 and 4) towards constructing a comprehensive structure for AUV mission planning, routing, task-time managing, and synchronic online motion planning adaptive to sudden changes of the time-variant environment. This chapter introduces an “Autonomous Reactive Mission Scheduling and Path Planning” (ARMSP) architecture and employs a set of evolutionary algorithms in layers of the proposed control architecture to investigate the efficiency of the structure towards handling the addressed objectives and prove stability of its performance in real-time\nCHAPTER 5.

Numerical simulations for analysis of different situations of the real-world environment is accomplished separately for each layer and also for the entire ARMSP model at the end. It is proven, by analysing the simulation results that the proposed model provides excellent mission timing and task managing while guaranteeing a secure deployment during the mission. The results of simulations support that the proposed architecture is reliable and robust, particularly in dealing with uncertainties. Figure 5.1 illustrates the operation diagram of the completed section in this chapter.\nThe rest of the chapter is organized in following sections: shortcomings associated with the mission-motion planning strategies are explained in Section 5.2. The main goal and motivation of this chapter in expressed by Section 5.3. The mechanism of the proposed modular architecture is provided by Section 5.4. The research assumptions and evaluation of the ARMSP in satisfying different aspects of an autonomous mission planning objectives and analysis of the simulation results is provided in Section 5.5.

First, the mechanism of the algorithms being utilized; and second the competency of the techniques for real-time applications. Additional to the addressed problems with selected strategies in both task assignment/mission planning and motion planning realm in the Chapters 3 and 4, many technical challenges are still remained unaddressed.\n Current variations over time can affect moving obstacles and drift them across a\nvehicle’s trajectory; therefore, the planned trajectory may change and become invalid or inefficient. Proper estimation of the events in such a dynamic uncertain terrain in long-range operations, outside the vehicle’s sensor coverage, is impractical and unreliable. Even though available ocean predictive approaches operate reasonably well in small scales, they produce insufficient accuracy to current prediction over long periods in larger scales. This becomes even more challenging in re-planning, when a large data load of variation of whole terrain condition should be computed repeatedly any time that path replanting is required, which is computationally inefficient and unnecessary as only awareness of environment changes in vicinity of the vehicle is enough.\n Assuming that the tasks for a specific mission are distributed in different areas of\na waypoint cluttered graph-like terrain, there should be a compromise among prioritizing the tasks according to available battery/time in a way that vehicle is guided toward the destination waypoint. As mentioned earlier, the path planning strategies principally deal with the quality of a vehicle’s motion between two points and are not provided for handling vehicle’s task assignment in a waypointcluttered terrain; so that a routing mission planning strategy is required to handle graph search constraints and carrying out the task assignment. However, vehicles routing and mission planning strategies are not accurate enough in coping with the dynamic variations of the terrain, but these approaches divide the operation area to smaller beneficent sections and give an overview of the pathway for vehicle to\nCHAPTER 5.

      "text" : "With respect to above discussion, existing approaches mainly are able to handle only a specific level of autonomy either task assignment together with time management or path planning with safety considerations (as discussed in Chapter 2). In this chapter, an autonomous reactive ARMSP control architecture encompassing a TaskAssign/Routing (TAR) approach and local Online Real-time Path Planner (ORPP) is developed to produce a reliable mission plan for a large-scale time-varying underwater environments, and to cover shortcomings associated with each of the above-mentioned strategies. The TAR module at the top level is responsible for task-assign process in a limited time interval and guiding the vehicle towards a target of interest while considering on-time termination of the mission. At the lower level, the ORPP module is in charge of generating optimal trajectories while operating in an uncertain undersea environment, where spatiotemporal variability of the operating field is taken into account. The TAR is able to reactively re-arrange the tasks based on mission/terrain updates while the low level ORPP is capable of coping unexpected changes of the terrain by correcting the old path and re-generating a new trajectory. As a result, the vehicle is able to undertake the maximum number of tasks with certain degree of manoeuvrability having situational awareness of the operating field. A constant interaction exists between high-low level modules across small and large scale. The ARMSP decides whether to carry out the path re-planning or mission re-planning procedure according to the raised situation. Mission re-planning is performed to manage the lost time in cases that the path planner process takes longer than expectation. The proposed re-planning procedure in both of the mission and path planners improve the robustness and reactive-ability of the AUV to the environmental changes and enhance its performance in accurate mission timing.\nThe proposed architecture offers a degree of flexibility for employing diverse sorts of algorithms subjected to real-time performance of them. Both of the planners operate individually and concurrently while sharing their information. The modular structure\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n129\nof this architecture provides a reusable and versatile framework that, at first, is easily upgradable and secondly is applicable to a broad group of autonomous vehicles. Parallel execution of the planners speeds up the computation process. The operating field for operation of the ORPP is split into smaller spaces between pairs of waypoints; thus, re-planning a new trajectory requires rendering and re-computing less information. This leads to problem space reduction and reducing the computational burden.\nFast and concurrent operation of the subsystems (TAR/ORPP) is the most critical factor in preserving the stability and consistency of the proposed ARMSP architecture that prevents each of TAR and ORPP components from dropping behind each other. Any delay in operation of TAR or ORPP disrupts the concurrency of the entire system. Also adding NP computational time into the equation would itself render a solution suboptimal. Relying on the previously mentioned ability of meta-heuristics in solving complex NP-hard problems, a combination of the employed algorithms by TAR and ORPP (examined in Chapters 3 and 4) is utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed ARMSP architecture in this chapter."

      "text" : "The proposed architecture is designed in separate modules running concurrently. The TAR allows the vehicle to select the best sequence of tasks in a restricted time so that the vehicle is guided towards the final destination. ORPP deals with vehicle’s guidance from one point to another taking the ocean uncertainty and variability into account. The modules interact simultaneously by back feeding the situational awareness of the surrounding operating field; accordingly, the system decides to re-plan the path or mission or continue the current mission. Hence, the “Synchron” module is designed to manage the lost time within the TAR/ORPP process and reactively adapt the system to the latest updates of the environment and the required decision parameters (e.g. remaining time). This process is frequently repeated until the AUV reaches the end point. The design of the proposed control architecture is illustrated by Figure 5.2.\n130\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n131\nOperation of the TAR and ORPP module is explained in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. Their real-time performance and accuracy also have been examined using a bunch of evolutionary algorithm. Another module will be added to the architecture to provide concurrency between operation of two TAR and ORPP modules and to recognize the requisition for either path re-planning or mission re-planning in different circumstances.\n5.4.1 Modelling of the ‘Synchron’ Module\nAfter the TAR generated a mission plan in a sequence of tasks/waypoints, the ORPP module gets this sequence along with environmental information and starts generating safe and efficient trajectory between the waypoints while the AUV concurrently executes the corresponding tasks. In this way, the AUV efficiently carries out its mission and safely is guided through the waypoints. The provided trajectory is shifted to the guidance controller to produce the guidance commands. During deployment between two waypoints, the ORPP can incorporate any dynamic changes of the environment. The ORPP repeatedly calculates the trajectory between vehicles current position and its specified target location (any time that new update of information received from the sensors). After each waypoint is visited the total path time of T℘ij is compared to expected time Tεij for traversing the corresponding distance, in which the Tεij≈tij is extracted from the mission time Tℜ given by (3-5). In a case that the T℘ ij is found to be smaller than Tεij, the current order of tasks would be valid and the vehicle can continue its mission. However, in the opposite case, when the T℘ij exceeds the Tεij, that is, a certain amount of the available time T∇ is spent for handling any probable challenge during the path planning process, the previously defined mission scenario cannot be appropriate any more. Under such conditions mission re-planning according to mission updates is necessary. This can cause a computational burden due to the mission re-planning process. Multiple traversing a specific edge (distance) is time dissipation, which means repeating a task for multiple times. To prevent this issue, the following steps should be carried out any time that mission re-planning is required:\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n132\n Update T∇\n Eliminate passed edges from the operation network (so the search space\nshrinks);\n The location of the present waypoint is considered as the new starting position\nfor both ORPP and TAR.\n TAR is to reorder the tasks and to prepare a new mission scenario based on\nnew information and the updated network topology. A computation cost is to be encountered any time that mission re-planning is required.\n This process is to be continued until vehicle arrives to the required destination\nwaypoint.\nThe trade-off between total available time and mission objectives is a critical issue that should be adaptively carried out by TAR. Hence, the main architecture should be fast enough to track environmental changes, cope with the dynamic changes, and carry out prompt path or mission re-planning based on the raised situation. The proposed synchronous architecture is evaluated according to criterion given in the next section.\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n133"

      "text" : "The ORPP operates concurrently in background of the TAR scheme. Performance of the generated local path by ORPP is evaluated by a cost function C℘ based on travel time (T℘), which is proportional to energy consumption and the distance travelled (L℘). The mission cost CTAR has direct relation to the passing distance between each pair of selected waypoints. Hence, the path cost C℘ for any appropriate local path is used in the context of the TAR. The main goal of the ARMSP module is to maximize the weight of the selected edges, which means selecting the best sequence of highest priority tasks in a limited time while guaranteeing on-time termination of the mission and safe deployment during the mission. To this end, the mission cost CTAR is defined as a combination of multiple weighted functions that should maximized or minimized.

As mentioned above, the path cost C℘ is a function of the mission cost CTAR (CTAR is affected by C℘ as presented by (5-2)). During the path planning process, traversing the corresponding distance may consume more time than what is expected. Restitution of the wasted time necessitates a mission re-planning process. The mission re-planning criteria (given by Figure 5.3) is investigated after the completion of the ORPP process (when a waypoint in the route sequence is visited). Hence, the computation time is also encountered in calculation of the total mission cost. Thus, the total cost CostTotal for the model is defined as:\n    CPUCPU\nTAR 1\nTARTotal   rep computeTCfCCost\n(5-3)\nwhere Tcompute is the mission re-planning computation time, rep is the number of time that the mission re-planning procedure is repeated. The AUV should use the available mission time as productively as possible. The TAR module is evaluated through the Monte Carlo simulation for BBO, PSO, ACO and GA algorithms in Chapter 3.\nThe ORPP module is also implemented using four evolutionary algorithms of BBO, PSO, DE, and FA, and evaluated and discussed in Chapter 4. These meta-heuristic algorithms have two inner loops through the population size of imax and number of iterations tmax (refer to pseudo-codes); thus, in the worst case, their computational complexity is O(imax2× tmax), which is linear with time. Hence, they are computationally cost effective.\nVarious combination of these algorithms is tested for evaluating the entire ARMSP model, and their performance is statistically analysed through the series of Monte Carlo simulations (discussed in Section 5.5)."

To model a realistic marine environment, a three-dimensional terrain in scale of {10×10 km (x-y), 1000 m(z)} is considered based on a realistic example map presented by Figures 5.4 and 5.5, in which the operating field is covered by uncertain static-moving objects, several fixed waypoints and variable ocean current. A k-means clustering method is employed to classify the coast, water and uncertain area of the map. To this purpose, a large map with the size of 1000×1000 pixels is conducted that presents 10×10 km square area for the TAR and a smaller part of the map in size of 350×350 pixels that corresponds to 3.5×3.5 km square is selected to implement and test the ORPP performance. In this map each pixel corresponds to 10×10 m square space.\nThe clustered map is converted to a matrix format, in which the matrix size is same to map’s pixel density. The corresponding matrix is filled with value of zero for coastal sections (forbidden area in black colour), value of (0,0.35] for uncertain sections (risky area in grey colour), and value of one for water covered area as valid zone for vehicles motion that is presented by white colour on the clustered map. The utilized clustering method is capable of clustering any alternative map very efficiently in a way that the blue sections sensed as water covered zones and other sections depending on their colour range categorized as forbidden and uncertain zones.\nCHAPTER 5.

Hence, every edge has weight and cost that is combination of tasks priority, tasks completion time, length of the edges and the time required for traversing the edges. Number of waypoint is set with a random number between 30 to 50 nodes that is calculated with a uniform distribution. The network topology also transforms randomly with a Gaussian distribution on the problem search space. A fixed set of 15 tasks, which are characterized with risk percentage, priority value, and completion time, are specified and are randomly assigned to some of the edges of the graph. The edges that are not assigned with a task are weighted with 1. The location of nodes are randomized according to {Pix,y~U(0,10000) and Piz~U(0,100)} in the water-covered area.\nIn addition to offline map, different types of static-moving obstacles are considered in this study in order to cover different possibilities of the real world situations (modelled in Chapter 4). Obstacle’s velocity vector and its coordinates can be measured by the sonar sensors with a specific uncertainty that is modelled with a Gaussian distribution; hence, each obstacle is presentable by its position (Θp), dimension (diameter Θr) and uncertainty ratio. Position of the obstacles are initialized using normal distribution of N~(0,σ2) bounded to position of two targeted waypoints by the path planner (e.g. Pax,y,z<Θp<Pbx,y,z), where σ2≈Θr. Further details on modelling of different obstacles is given by Chapter 4.\nBeside the uncertainty of operating field, which is taken into account in the modelling of the operation terrain, water current needs to be addressed thoroughly in accordance with the type and the range of the mission. For the purpose of this study, a 3D turbulent time-varying current is considered that is generated using a multiple layered 2D current maps, in which the current circulation patterns gradually change with depth. It is assumed the AUV is traveling with constant velocity |v| between two waypoints. The vehicular constraints and boundary conditions on AUV actuators and state also are taken into account for realistic modelling of the AUV operation. As discussed earlier the violation function for the path planners is defined as a combination of the vehicle’s depth, surge, sway, theta, yaw and collision violations. According to (5-1), the boundaries of the constraints are defined as follows: the zmin=0(m); zmax=100(m);\nCHAPTER 5.

      "text" : "and Efficient Operation\nThe proposed architecture offers a degree of flexibility for employing a diverse set of algorithms and can perfectly synchronize them to have a unique performance. The performance of the model, thus, is independent of the meta-heuristics employed by its different components. The reason for this advantage is to join two disparate perspective of vehicle’s autonomy in high-level task organizing and low-level self/environment awareness in motion planning in a cooperative and concordant manner in which adopting diverse algorithms by these modules are not a detriment to the real-time performance of the system. To cover shortcomings of the path planning when operating in a large scale, the operating field for operation of the ORPP is split to smaller spaces between pairs of waypoints (by higher layer TAR); thus, re-planning a new trajectory requires rendering and re-computing less information. This leads to problem space reduction and reducing the computational burden, which is another reason for fast operation of the proposed approach. Two of the tested algorithms in Chapters 3 and 4 (DE and FA) are selected arbitrarily and are employed by TAR and ORPP modules to test the performance of the ARMSP model. In the proposed ARMSP architecture, the TAR is expected to be capable of generating a time efficient route with best sequence of tasks to ensure the AUV has a beneficial operation and reaches to the destination on time, as it is obligatory requirement for vehicles safety.\nA beneficial operation is a mission that covers maximum possible number of tasks in a manner that total obtained weight by a route and its travel time is maximized but not exceed the time threshold. Along with an efficient mission planning, the ORPP in a smaller scale is expected be fast enough to rapidly react to prompt changes of the environment and generate an alternative trajectory that safely guides the vehicle through the specified waypoints optimally. Hence, the performance and stability of the\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n140\nmodel in satisfying the metrics of “obtained weight”, “number of completed tasks”, “cost of the TAR/ORPP” and “total violation of the model” is investigated. These factors are statistically analysed through 50 Monte Carlo simulation runs (presented by Figures 5.6 and 5.7).\nBased on the results presented in Figure 5.7, the cost variation for both TAR and ORPP shows the stability of the model in producing optimal solutions as its range stands in a specific interval for all experiments (mission). The ORPP gets violation if the generated path crosses the collision edges, its depth drawn outside of the vertical operating borders or when the vehicles surge, sway, yaw and pitch parameters egress the defined boundaries; and the TAR gets violation if the route time Tℜ exceeds the total available time T∇. TAR and ORPP are recalled for several times in a particular mission. Figure 5.6 shows that the model accurately satisfies all defined constraints as the violation values considerably approach zero in all 50 executions (which is negligible).\nProper coordination of the higher and lower level components of TAR and ORPP in the system is another important factor. To provide a stringent and accurate concordance between two planners and real-time implementation of the model, some other performance indexes should be highlighted additional to those which addressed above. So one critical factor for both planners is having a short computational time to provide a concurrent synchronization. Fast operation of each planner, keeps any of them from dropping behind the process of the other one, since appearance of such a delay damages concurrency of the entire system.\nAnother significant performance metric that influences the synchronism of whole system is compatibility of the value of local path time (T℘) and the expected time (Tε) in multiple operations of the ORPP. So existence of a reasonable correlation between T℘ and Tε values in each ORPP operation is critical to total performance of the ARMSP model, which means a big difference between these two parameters cause interruption in cohesion of the whole system, as it is critical for recognizing the requisition for mission re-planning. The models behaviour in satisfying these two performance metrics is also investigated in a quantitative fashion as illustrated by Figure 5.8.\n141\n142\n143\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n144\nIt is apparent from Figure 5.8 that variations of both T℘ and Tε are in a similar range (very close to each other). In this figure, the T℘ and Tε are presented with yellow transparent boxplot and blue compact boxplot, respectively. Figure 5.8 also presents the relative proportions of CPU time used for multiple runs of the ORPP compared to CPU time for TAR operations. It is noteworthy that, based on the results in Figure 5.8, both modules take a very short CPU time for all experiments that makes it highly appropriate for real-time application. It is evident that the range of variations of CPU time for both planners is almost in similar range in all experiments that proves the inherent stability of the model’s real-time performance.\nThe system aims to take the maximum use of the total available time (T∇), increase the mission productivity by collecting best sequence of tasks (fitted to T∇), and to guarantee on-time termination of the mission. The stability of the ARMSP model in time management is the most critical factor representing robustness of the architecture. To this end, the robustness of the ARMSP model in terms of mission time management is evaluated by testing 50 missions’ through individual experiments with the same initial condition that closely matches actual underwater mission scenarios, presented in Figure 5.9.\nThe most appropriate outcome for a mission is completion of the mission with the minimum residual time (TResidual), which means the vehicle took maximum use of available time and terminated its mission before running out of battery; thus, the most effective performance indicator for this model is its accuracy in mission time management. The mission time (Tℜ) is the summation of time taken for passing through the waypoints (produced by the ORPP) and completion time for covered tasks along paths. It is clear in Figure 5.9 the proposed reactive ARMSP system is capable of making full use of the available time as the Tℜ in all experiments approaches the T∇ and met the above constraints denoted by the upper bound of T∇=7.2 ×103(sec) (presented by the green line). Conversely, the TResidual has a linear relation to Tℜ that should be minimized but it should not be equal to zero and is accurately satisfied considering variations of TResidual over 50 missions. Considering the fact that reaching\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n145\nto the destination is a big concern for vehicles safety, a big penalty value is assigned to strictly prevent missions from taking longer than T∇.\nAs declared by Figure 5.9, the TResidual got a very small positive value in all missions that means no failure has occurred in this simulation. This is a remarkable achievement for having a confident and reliable mission as the failure is not acceptable for AUVs due to expensive maintenance in severe underwater environment. Obviously, the Tℜ is maximized by minimizing the TResidual, which represents that how much of total available T∇ is used for completing different tasks in each mission. Analysing the variation of the Tℜ and the TResidual confirms supreme performance of the proposed novel ARMSP model in mission reliability and excellent time management.\nFor proper visualization of the dynamic mission planning process, one of the experiments is presented in Figure 5.10 in which rearrangement of order of tasks and waypoints according to updated TResidual is presented through three re-planning procedure.\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n146\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n147\nIn the beginning of the mission, the TAR is called to generate the initial appropriate task sequence fitted to available time. Given a candidate initial route in a sequence of waypoints (edges assigned by tasks) along with environment information, the ORPP provides a trajectory to safely guide the vehicle through the waypoints. In the whole process, the TResidual that is initialized with the value equal to T∇, is counted inversely. Indeed, the TResidual is the total available time that is reduced as the mission is proceeds. The ORPP incorporates any dynamic changes of the terrain during the vehicle’s deployment between two waypoints. In some cases, process of ORPP may take longer. This means the path took longer than expected time Tε for passing the corresponding distance (occurred in passing the fifth edge in Figure 5.10).

      "text" : "heuristics: Single Run and 100 Monte Carlo Runs\nTo measure the performance optimality of the model, several performance metrics are utilized such as, total model cost and violation that involves the resultant violation of both ORPP and TAR approaches; mission profit which belongs to the number and total value of the completed tasks in a single mission; real-time performance of the system; and mission timing. The aforementioned factors are analysed in a single run for a different combination of the applied algorithms for both ORPP and TAR. The results are illustrated in Figures 5.11 to 5.13. Then, 100 runs of Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to prove the stability of the introduced model employing any meta-heuristic method, which is a remarkable advantage for a real-time autonomous system. From Figure 5.11, it is clear that computational time for any component of the system and also the whole operation of ARMSP is drawn in a reasonable interval in range of seconds. There is no remarkable difference between outcome of different combination of the proposed algorithms, which confirms ARMSP’s capability in real time handling of task assigning/reassigning and coping with the dynamic changes of the terrain.\nFigure 5.12 illustrates the comparison of elapsed time for carrying out a mission using different combination of algorithms. As mentioned earlier, it is highly critical to end the mission before vehicle runs out of battery and time. In addition, it is important for the model to take maximum use of total time and finish the mission with minimum positive residual time. Considering the variations of residual time (yellow boxes), route time (mission blue boxes), and total available time (red line over the boxes) in Figure 5.12, all missions terminated with a very small residual time and did not cross the predefined time boundary. This confirms the remarkable capability of the proposed model in mission timing which is critical for fully autonomous operations; however, it seems that the combination of ACO-DE, BBO-DE, BBO-BBO, and BBO-FA show the best timing performance between others.\n149\n150\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n151\nAlong with mentioned factors, the stability of the model in terms of managing total systems violation is also important issue that should be taken into consideration. According to results presented in Figure 5.13, the cost variation for the model and its components shows the stability of the model in producing optimal solutions as the cost variation range stands in a specific interval for all cases. Both TAR and ORPP are recalled for several times in a mission. Violation variations in Figure 5.13 shows that the model accurately satisfies all defined constraints and efficiently manages the engaged components toward eliminating the total violation regardless of the employed algorithms.\nCarrying out the Monte Carlo simulations gives more confidence about total model’s performance, stability and accuracy in dealing with random transformation of the environment or operational graph size and topology. The 100 Monte Carlo simulation runs are carried out for all applied algorithms to prove independency of the proposed strategy from the applied meta-heuristic methods, given by Figure 5.14 to 5.17.\nThe results captured from Monte Carlo simulation in Figure 5.14 also confirms that the proposed model is remarkably appropriate for real-time application as all the CPU time variations are drawn in a very narrow boundary in range of seconds for all combination of employed algorithms by TAR and ORPP. It is also noteworthy to mention from the analysis of the results in Figure 5.15 that the variation ranges of performance metrics of total obtained weight and completed tasks is almost in a same range for all applied algorithms. This shows the stability and robustness of the model in maintaining usefulness of the mission in a reasonable range when dealing with environmental changes and random deformation of the topology of operation network. Referring to Figure 5.16, the total model cost is also varying in a similar range for all applied algorithms (almost between 4.5 to 7). The results obtained from analysis of the cost variations in Figure 5.16 also confirms the inherent robustness and stability of the proposed model independent of the applied algorithm.\n152\n153\n154\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n155\nTo further prove the timing accuracy of the proposed ARMSP model in different situations and against problem space deformations, variation range of the residual time in 100 Monte Carlo executions is presented by Figure 5.17 for all applied algorithms. It is noted the residual time variations for all cases is lied in a positive scale (except some outliers denoted by red cross sign under the boxplots) and comparing to the assigned time threshold of T∇:TTotal=10800 (sec) considerably minimized and approached to zero which means maximum part of the available time is used. This achievement confirms the performance of the ARMSP model in mission timing."

This modular architecture is developed based on two mission planning (TAR) and path planning (ORPP) modules that were implemented and evaluated in two previous chapters. The ARMSP can simultaneously organize the tasks based on their priority, order, risk percentage and completion time; and ensure mission completion. In the lower level, it is also capable of enhancing vehicle’s manoeuvrability and increasing its autonomy for operating in a cluttered and uncertain environment and carrying out a fruitful mission.\nThe proposed architecture offers a degree of flexibility for employing a diverse set of algorithms and can effectively synchronize them to achieve stable performance, in so that adopting different algorithms in the modules is not detrimental to real-time performance of the system. A quantitative analyse is provided in order to examine the capability and efficiency of the proposed framework performed in MATLAB®2016b. This implementation includes the robustness assessment in terms of statistical analysis of the performance of the framework in diverse experiments to ensure its reliability and stability regardless of the applied algorithms. Synchronization between higher and lower level modules is efficiently configured to manage the mission time and to guarantee on-time termination of the mission. Real map data and different uncertain dynamic/static objects are encountered to model a realistic marine environment.\nCHAPTER 5. ARMSP ARCHITECTURE\n156\nMoreover, the impact of the time variant water current on the AUV’s motion is incorporated.\nThe most critical factor for preserving the stability and consistency of the proposed real-time ARMSP scheme is maintaining comparably fast operation for each component of the system (TAR and ORPP) to prevent any of them from dropping behind the others. The analysis of the captured results from different simulated missions indicates the model’s consistency and robustness against the problem space deformation. The results obtained from Monte Carlo analysis (presented by Figure 5.9) demonstrate the inherent robustness and efficiency of the proposed hierarchical reactive system in terms of time management and enhancing mission productivity by maximizing Tℜ while each mission is terminated before the vehicle runs out of time/energy, as in all experiment TResidual gets nonzero positive value. The results, also confirm the effectiveness of the model in providing safe and beneficial operation. The captured CPU time from the Monte Carlo simulations indicate applicability of the ARMSP for real-time implementation, which is a significant factor for an autonomous system.

As regards, existing AUVs are restricted in terms of battery capacity and endurance, they should be capable of managing mission time. Obviously, a single AUV is not able to meet all specified tasks in a single mission with confined time and energy, so the vehicle has to manage its resources effectively to perform effective persistent deployment in longer missions. In this respect, time management is a fundamental requirement toward mission success that tightly depends on the optimality of the selected tasks between start and destination point. Assuming that the tasks for a specific mission are distributed in different areas of a waypoint cluttered graph-like terrain, proposing an accurate task-assign/routing scheme and task organizer facilitates the vehicle to accurately order the tasks and to take the best use of a restricted time so that the order of tasks guide the vehicle toward the destination. Thus, design of an efficient mission-planning framework considering vehicle’s properties and resources is essential requirement for maximizing mission productivity. On the other hand, having an efficient motion planning system facilitates\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\n158\nthe vehicle to cope with environmental sudden changes as a principle safety requirement.\nIn this Thesis a synchronic modular architecture of ARMSP is introduced to address higher level of decision autonomy for AUV employing a Task-Assign/Routing (TAR) system and an adaptive Online Real-time Path Planning (ORPP) approach, which provides a comprehensive control on mission timing, multi-tasking, safe and efficient deployment in a waypoint-based, cluttered, uncertain, and varying underwater environment. The ORPP handles unforeseen changes and generates an alternative trajectory that safely guides the vehicle through the specified waypoints with minimum time/energy cost. A constant interaction exists between high and low level planners across small and large scale.\nChapter 2 provided a basic definition of autonomy and importance of resource management as principle requirements for autonomous operations. Afterward, dependencies of autonomy to accurate decision-making and efficient situation awareness are pointed out. Thus, the task-assign/routing is introduced as a higher-level decision making system for ordering the tasks execution and guiding the AUV toward the targeted location; and respectively the relation of the path (motion) planning with awareness of the vehicle from different situations is explained by Sections 2.3 and 2.4. A principle review of the existing methods for autonomous vehicles’ routing-task assignment problem and state of the art in autonomous vehicles motion (path-routetrajectory) planning is provided and discussed in this chapter.\nChapter 3 described the mission planning and formulated the problem. The reactive TAR mission planner is developed. Given a set of constraints (e.g., time) and a set of task priority values, the TAR tends to find the optimal sequence of tasks for underwater mission that maximizes the sum of the priorities and minimizes the total risk percentage while meeting the given constraints. To fulfil the objectives of this chapter toward solving the stated problems, the solution was presented in several steps to enables the vehicle to autonomously find an optimal route through the operation network, carry out the maximum number of highest priority tasks, and reach to\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\n159\ndestination on time. Novel modification was applied to route generating flow and route encoding distribution to prevent generating infeasible task sequences by reducing the possibility of loop-formation and speed up the entire process. Finally the TAR system has been simulated and evaluated on different graphs of varying complexity applying ACO, BBO, PSO and GA algorithm.\nFurthermore, a path-planning module of ORPP is designed in Chapter 4 to operate in a smaller scale and concurrently plan trajectory between waypoints included in the task sequence. The ORPP operates in the context of the ARMSP system in a manner to be fast enough to handle unforeseen changes and regenerates an alternative trajectory that safely guides the vehicle with minimum cost. All aspects of the ORPP implementation including the model of different static-dynamic obstacles, timevarying ocean currents, and map clustering were delivered by Section 4.2. The Kinodynamic model of the vehicle, B-Spline path formation, optimization criterion for the path planning problem, and online re-planning process were described in detail by Section 4.3. This chapter also provided an overview and mechanism of the applied evolutionary algorithms on ORPP process, presented in Section 4.4. In particular, path planning based on PSO, BBO, DE, and FA algorithms are developed and their performance are examined and compared through several scenarios in Section 4.5.\nAfter having discussed on different aspects of mission planning and path planning, and development of TAR and ORPP modules, subsequently, Chapter 5 addressed problems and shortcomings associated with each planner by developing a novel autonomous architecture with reactive re-planning capability. The mechanism of the proposed modular ARMSP control architecture is presented by Section 5.4. The system incorporates two different execution layers, deliberative and reactive, to satisfy the AUV’s high and low level autonomy requirements in motion planning and mission management, in which two previously developed modules of TAR and ORPP are integrated to operate in a synchronous and concurrent manner in context of the ARMSP. In addition, a ‘Synchron module’ is also designed to manage the synchronizations among higher and lower level modules and to recognize whether to carry out the mission rescheduling or path re-planning.\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\n160\nFinally, performance and stability of the ARMSP architecture in maximizing mission productivity, real-time operation, mission timing, and handling dynamicity of the terrain was evaluated using different combination of aforementioned meta-heuristic algorithms. Knowing the fact that existing approaches are mainly only able to cover a part of problem of ether motion/path planning or task assignment based on offline map, the provided framework is a remarkable contribution to improve an AUV’s autonomy in both higher and lower levels due to its comprehensive mission-motion planning capability that covers shortcomings associated with previous strategies used in this scope."

Mission planning and task priority assignment have great impact on mission time management and mission success. Assuming the tasks for a specific mission are distributed in eligible water covered sections of the map (where beginning and ending location of a task appointed with waypoints), a mission planning system of TAR is designed in the top level that simultaneously rearranges the order of tasks taking passage of time into account. Addition to important fact of prioritizing tasks and fitting them to the available time, order of tasks, so that the vehicle is guided from a start point to the destination point, is another important factor that should be taken into account. Respecting these definitions, task-assign/routing problem has a combinatorial nature analogous to both BKP and TSP NP-Hard problems. Obtaining the optimal solutions for NP-hard problems is computationally challenging issue and difficult to solve in practice.\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\n161\nMoreover, obtaining the exact optimal solution is only possible for the certain cases that the environment is completely known and no uncertainty exist; however, the modelled environment by this research corresponds to a spatiotemporal time varying environment with high uncertainty. Meta-heuristics are appropriate approaches suggested for handling above-mentioned complexities. Making use of the heuristic nature of swarm based and evolutionary algorithms in solving NP-hard graph problems, PSO, BBO, ACO, and GA are employed to evaluate the performance of TAR module toward fulfilment of the proposed objectives at this stage. For performance evaluation, the AUV operation was simulated in a three-dimension large terrain (almost 10⨯ 10 km2⨯100 m), where several prioritized tasks are distributed in different areas of the terrain. The tasks are predefined and initialized in advance with specific characteristics. Then, considering the limitations over the mission time, vehicle’s battery, uncertainty and variability of the underlying operating field, appropriate mission timing and energy management is undertaken.\nA series of Monte Carlo simulation trials are undertaken. The results of simulations demonstrate that the proposed method is reliable and robust particularly in dealing with uncertainties and problem space deformations; as a result, the proposed TAR model can significantly enhance the level of vehicle’s decision autonomy in prioritizing tasks and mission time management by providing the best sequence of tasks (waypoints) with respect to the mission objectives and relying on the capability of providing fast and feasible solutions. By doing this, the optimal deployment zone is selected and the search area is minimized.\nOperating in the turbulent and uncertain underwater environments gives many concerns for vehicle’s deployment. Thus, robustness of the vehicle to current variability and terrain uncertainties is essential to mission success and AUV safe deployment. At this stage, the TAR module, however, is designed for the purpose of mission planning and task-time management and it is not able to cover dynamic variation of the underwater environment. Thus, an online path planner of ORPP is designed to assist the higher lever TAR in coping environmental dynamic changes.\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\n162"

The path-planning scenario is defined through a highly cluttered and variable operating field. Providing a certain level of autonomy makes the vehicle and particularly path planner capable of using the favourable current flow for energy management. To have an expedient adaptation with the variations of the underlying environment, a novel online path planning module of ORPP was developed and implemented that is capable of refining the original path considering the update of current flows, uncertain static and moving obstacles. This refinement is not computationally expensive as there is no need to compute the path from scratch and the obtained solutions of the original path is utilized as the initial solutions for the employed methods. This leads to reduction of optimization space that accelerates the process of searching.\nThe proposed ORPP module entails a heuristic for refining the path considering situational awareness of environment. The planner thus needs to accommodate the unforeseen changes in the operating field such as emergence of unpredicted obstacles or variability of current field and turbulent regions. A penalty function method is utilized to combine the boundary conditions, vehicular and environmental constraints with the performance index that is expected path time (TƐ). Applying the evolutionary methods namely PSO, BBO, DE, and FA indicate that they are capable of satisfying the path planning problem’s conditions. The objective of this chapter was to synthesize and analyse the performance and capability of the mentioned methods for guiding an AUV from an initial loitering point toward the target waypoint through a comprehensive simulation study.\nThe simulation results demonstrate that this new approach along with the proposed algorithms could generate a time efficient path using the advantages of desirable current field and avoiding obstacles and no-fly zones.

This becomes even more problematic in re-planning process, when a large data load of variation of whole terrain condition should be computed repeatedly.

The subsequent Monte-Carlo test results show the significant robustness of the model against uncertainties of the operating field and variations of mission conditions.

For example, the vehicle should be able to abort the mission safely in major failures or continue the mission (considering the new restrictions) for any tolerable failure. Following diagram represents the internal components that should be checked continuously during the mission. The feedback from this block is considered and are returned to decision making system as a part of situation awareness puzzle.\nCHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\n167\nThe internal fault tolerant system includes three levels of fault detection (monitors the vehicle’s overall hardware and software availabilities), fault recognition (determines the severity of the fault and whether it is tolerable or not), and fault accommodation (deal with the raised situation by safely aborting the mission for not-tolerable faults or reconfiguring the vehicle control architecture to successfully carry out the mission if the fault is tolerable). If a vehicle is damaged or some of its components fail, mission adaptation will be required to cope with the new restricted capabilities. In fully autonomous missions, the performance of the on-board sensors and other subsystems are checked continuously during the mission. In an autonomous system if internal errors push the system outside of its normal equilibrium state (mission process) the system tends to throwback the process to the normal state (original equilibrium state).

Loos of two horizontal thrusters is tolerable for the vehicle and remaining thrusters can cover its motion in x-y plane with a careful path-planning. Thruster failure can be easily detected by monitoring thruster motor outputs.

The capability of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to fulfil the mission objectives is directly influenced by route planning and task assignment system performance. This paper proposes an efficient task-assign route planning model in a semi-dynamic operation network, where the location of some waypoints are changed by time in a bounded area. Two popular meta-heuristic algorithms named biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are adopted to provide real-time optimal solutions for task sequence selection and mission time management. To examine the performance of the method in a context of mission productivity, mission time management and vehicle safety, a series of Monte Carlo simulation trials are undertaken. The results of simulations declare that the proposed method is reliable and robust particularly in dealing with uncertainties and changes of the operation network topology; as a result, it can significantly enhance the level of vehicle’s autonomy by relying on its reactive nature and capability of providing fast feasible solutions.\nLink: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7743858/authors\n183"

Robustness of AUVs path planning to this strong variability is known as a complex NP-hard problem and is considered a critical issue to ensure vehicles safe deployment. Efficient evolutionary techniques have substantial potential of handling NP hard complexity of path planning problem as more powerful and fast algorithms among other approaches for mentioned problem. For the purpose of this research Differential Evolution (DE) technique is conducted to solve the AUV path planning problem in a realistic underwater environment. The path planners designed in this paper are capable of extracting feasible areas of a real map to determine the allowed spaces for deployment, where coastal area, islands, static/dynamic obstacles and ocean current is taken into account and provides the efficient path with a small computation time. The results obtained from analyze of experimental demonstrate the inherent robustness and drastic efficiency of the proposed scheme in enhancement of the vehicles path planning capability in coping undesired current, using useful current flow, and avoid colliding collision boundaries in a real-time manner. The proposed approach is also flexible and strictly respects to vehicle’s kinematic constraints resisting current instabilities.\nLink: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1604/1604.02523.pdf\n184"

The rendezvous problem is transformed into a Nonlinear Optimal Control Problem (NOCP) and then numerical solutions are provided. A penalty function method is utilized to combine the boundary conditions, vehicular and environmental constraints with the performance index that is final rendezvous time. Four evolutionary based path planning methods namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Firefly Algorithm (FA) are employed to establish a reactive planner module and provide a numerical solution for the proposed NOCP. The objective is to synthesize and analyze the performance and capability of the mentioned methods for guiding an AUV from an initial loitering point toward the rendezvous through a comprehensive simulation study. The proposed planner module entails a heuristic for refining the path considering situational awareness of environment, encompassing static and dynamic obstacles within a spatiotemporal current fields. The planner thus needs to accommodate the unforeseen changes in the operating field such as emergence of unpredicted obstacles or variability of current field and turbulent regions. The simulation results demonstrate the inherent robustness and efficiency of the proposed planner for enhancing a vehicle’s autonomy so as to enable it to reach the desired rendezvous. The advantages and shortcoming of all utilized methods are also presented based on the obtained results.\nLink: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1604/1604.07002.pdf\n185"

The architecture involves three main modules: The GRP module at the top level deals with the task priority assignment, mission time management, and determination of a feasible route between start and destination point in a large scale environment. The LPP module at the lower level deals with safety considerations and generates collision-free optimal trajectory between each specific pair of waypoints listed in obtained global route.

To this end, a high level reactive mission planner and a low level motion planning system are constructed. The high level system is responsible for task priority assignment and guiding the vehicle toward a target of interest considering on-time termination of the mission. The lower layer is in charge of generating optimal trajectories based on sequence of tasks and dynamicity of operating terrain. The mission planner is able to reactively re-arrange the tasks based on mission/terrain updates while the low level planner is capable of coping unexpected changes of the terrain by correcting the old path and re-generating a new trajectory. As a result, the vehicle is able to undertake the maximum number of tasks with certain degree of maneuverability having situational awareness of the operating field. The computational engine of the mentioned framework is based on the biogeography based optimization (BBO) algorithm that is capable of providing efficient solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, firstly, a realistic model of undersea environment is provided based on realistic map data, and then several scenarios, treated as real experiments, are designed through the simulation study. Additionally, to show the robustness and reliability of the framework, Monte-Carlo simulation is carried out and statistical analysis is performed. The results of simulations indicate the significant potential of the two-level hierarchical mission planning system in mission success and its applicability for real-time implementation.\nLink: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1604/1604.07898.pdf\n190"

      "text" : "Abstract—Today AUVs operation still remains restricted to very particular tasks with low real autonomy due to battery restrictions. Efficient path planning and mission scheduling are principle requirement toward advance autonomy and facilitate the vehicle to handle long-range operations. A single vehicle cannot carry out all tasks in a large scale terrain; hence, it needs a certain degree of autonomy in performing robust decision making and awareness of the mission/environment to trade-off between tasks to be completed, managing the available time, and ensuring safe deployment at all stages of the mission. In this respect, this research introduces a modular control architecture including higher/lower level planners, in which the higher level module is responsible for increasing mission productivity by assigning prioritized tasks while guiding the vehicle toward its final destination in a terrain covered by several waypoints; and the lower level is responsible for vehicle’s safe deployment in a smaller scale encountering time varying ocean current and different uncertain static/moving obstacles similar to actual ocean environment. Synchronization between higher and lower level modules is efficiently configured to manage the mission time and to guarantee on-time termination of the mission. The performance and accuracy of two higher and lower level modules are tested and validated using ant colony and firefly optimization algorithm, respectively. After all, the overall performance of the architecture is investigated in 10 different mission scenarios. The analysis of the captured results from different simulated missions confirms the efficiency and inherent robustness of the introduced architecture in efficient time management, safe deployment, and providing beneficial operation by proper prioritizing the tasks in accordance with mission time.\nLink: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1604/1604.08336.pdf\n191"

      "text" : "(RRMPP) Architecture\nAbstract— Providing a higher level of decision autonomy is a true challenge in development of today AUVs and promotes a single vehicle to accomplish multiple tasks in a single mission as well as accompanying prompt changes of a turbulent and highly uncertain environment. The proceeding approach builds on recent researches toward constructing a comprehensive structure for AUV mission planning, routing, task-time managing and synchronic online motion planning adaptive to sudden changes of the time variant environment. Respectively, an “Autonomous Reactive Mission Scheduling and Path Planning” (ARMSP) architecture is constructed in this paper and a bunch of evolutionary algorithms are employed by different layers of the proposed control architecture to investigate the efficiency of the structure toward handling addressed objectives and prove stability of its performance in real-time mission tasktime-threat management regardless of the applied metaheuristic algorithm. Static current map data, uncertain dynamic-static obstacles, vehicles Kino-dynamic constraints are taken into account and online path re-planning strategy is adopted to consider local variations of the environment so that a small computational load is devoted for re-planning procedure since the upper layer, which is responsible for mission scheduling, renders an overview of the operation area that AUV should fly thru. Numerical simulations for analysis of different situations of the real-world environment is accomplished separately for each layer and also for the entire ARMSP model at the end. Performance and stability of the model is investigated thorough employing metaheuristic algorithms toward furnishing the stated mission goals. It is proven by analyzing the simulation results that the proposed model provides a perfect mission timing and task managing while guarantying a secure deployment during the mission.\nLink: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1605/1605.01824.pdf"
