      "text" : "Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have substantially pushed the state-of-the-art in a wide range of tasks, especially in speech recognition [1, 2] and computer vision, notably object recognition from images [3, 4]. More recently, deep learning is making important strides in natural language processing, especially statistical machine translation [5, 6, 7]. Interestingly, one of the key factors that enabled this major progress has been the advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), with speed-ups on the order of 10 to 30-fold, starting with [8], and similar improvements with distributed training [9, 10]. Indeed, the ability to train larger models on more data has enabled the kind of breakthroughs observed in the last few years. Today, researchers and developers designing new deep learning algorithms and applications often find themselves limited by computational capability. This along, with the drive to put deep learning systems on low-power devices (unlike GPUs) is greatly increasing the interest in research and development of specialized hardware for deep networks [11, 12, 13].\nMost of the computation performed during training and application of deep networks regards the multiplication of a real-valued weight by a real-valued activation (in the recognition or forward propagation phase of the back-propagation algorithm) or gradient (in the backward propagation phase of the back-propagation algorithm). This paper proposes an approach called BinaryConnect\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n00 36\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nto eliminate the need for these multiplications by forcing the weights used in these forward and backward propagations to be binary, i.e. constrained to only two values (not necessarily 0 and 1). We show that state-of-the-art results can be achieved with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.\nWhat makes this workable are two ingredients:\n1. Sufficient precision is necessary to accumulate and average a large number of stochastic gradients, but noisy weights (and we can view discretization into a small number of values as a form of noise, especially if we make this discretization stochastic) are quite compatible with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the main type of optimization algorithm for deep learning. SGD explores the space of parameters by making small and noisy steps and that noise is averaged out by the stochastic gradient contributions accumulated in each weight. Therefore, it is important to keep sufficient resolution for these accumulators, which at first sight suggests that high precision is absolutely required. [14] and [15] show that randomized or stochastic rounding can be used to provide unbiased discretization. [14] have shown that SGD requires weights with a precision of at least 6 to 8 bits and [16] successfully train DNNs with 12 bits dynamic fixed-point computation. Besides, the estimated precision of the brain synapses varies between 6 and 12 bits [17].\n2. Noisy weights actually provide a form of regularization which can help to generalize better, as previously shown with variational weight noise [18], Dropout [19, 20] and DropConnect [21], which add noise to the activations or to the weights. For instance, DropConnect [21], which is closest to BinaryConnect, is a very efficient regularizer that randomly substitutes half of the weights with zeros during propagations. What these previous works show is that only the expected value of the weight needs to have high precision, and that noise can actually be beneficial.\nThe main contributions of this article are the following.\n• We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations (Section 2). • We show that BinaryConnect is a regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results on\nthe permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN (Section 3). • We make the code for BinaryConnect available 1."

      "text" : "Applying a DNN mainly consists in convolutions and matrix multiplications. The key arithmetic operation of DL is thus the multiply-accumulate operation. Artificial neurons are basically multiplyaccumulators computing weighted sums of their inputs.\nBinaryConnect constraints the weights to either +1 or −1 during propagations. As a result, many multiply-accumulate operations are replaced by simple additions (and subtractions). This is a huge gain, as fixed-point adders are much less expensive both in terms of area and energy than fixed-point multiply-accumulators [22]."

      "heading" : "2.2 Deterministic vs stochastic binarization",
      "text" : "The binarization operation transforms the real-valued weights into the two possible values. A very straightforward binarization operation would be based on the sign function:\nwb = { +1 if w ≥ 0, −1 otherwise. (1)\n1https://github.com/MatthieuCourbariaux/BinaryConnect\nWhere wb is the binarized weight and w the real-valued weight. Although this is a deterministic operation, averaging this discretization over the many input weights of a hidden unit could compensate for the loss of information. An alternative that allows a finer and more correct averaging process to take place is to binarize stochastically:\nwb = { +1 with probability p = σ(w), −1 with probability 1− p. (2)\nwhere σ is the “hard sigmoid” function:\nσ(x) = clip( x+ 1\n2 , 0, 1) = max(0,min(1,\nx+ 1\n2 )) (3)\nWe use such a hard sigmoid rather than the soft version because it is far less computationally expensive (both in software and specialized hardware implementations) and yielded excellent results in our experiments. It is similar to the “hard tanh” non-linearity introduced by [23]. It is also piece-wise linear and corresponds to a bounded form of the rectifier [24]."

      "heading" : "2.3 Propagations vs updates",
      "text" : "Let us consider the different steps of back-propagation with SGD udpates and whether it makes sense, or not, to discretize the weights, at each of these steps.\n1. Given the DNN input, compute the unit activations layer by layer, leading to the top layer which is the output of the DNN, given its input. This step is referred as the forward propagation.\n2. Given the DNN target, compute the training objective’s gradient w.r.t. each layer’s activations, starting from the top layer and going down layer by layer until the first hidden layer. This step is referred to as the backward propagation or backward phase of backpropagation.\n3. Compute the gradient w.r.t. each layer’s parameters and then update the parameters using their computed gradients and their previous values. This step is referred to as the parameter update.\nAlgorithm 1 SGD training with BinaryConnect. C is the cost function for minibatch and the functions binarize(w) and clip(w) specify how to binarize and clip weights. L is the number of layers. Require: a minibatch of (inputs, targets), previous parameters wt−1 (weights) and bt−1 (biases),\nand learning rate η. Ensure: updated parameters wt and bt.\n1. Forward propagation: wb ← binarize(wt−1) For k = 1 to L, compute ak knowing ak−1, wb and bt−1 2. Backward propagation: Initialize output layer’s activations gradient ∂C∂aL For k = L to 2, compute ∂C∂ak−1 knowing ∂C ∂ak\nand wb 3. Parameter update: Compute ∂C∂wb and ∂C dbt−1\nknowing ∂C∂ak and ak−1 wt ← clip(wt−1 − η ∂C∂wb ) bt ← bt−1 − η ∂C∂bt−1\nA key point to understand with BinaryConnect is that we only binarize the weights during the forward and backward propagations (steps 1 and 2) but not during the parameter update (step 3), as illustrated in Algorithm 1. Keeping good precision weights during the updates is necessary for SGD to work at all. These parameter changes are tiny by virtue of being obtained by gradient descent, i.e., SGD performs a large number of almost infinitesimal changes in the direction that most improves the training objective (plus noise). One way to picture all this is to hypothesize that what matters\nmost at the end of training is the sign of the weights, w∗, but that in order to figure it out, we perform a lot of small changes to a continuous-valued quantity w, and only at the end consider its sign:\nw∗ = sign( ∑ t gt) (4)\nwhere gt is a noisy estimator of ∂C(f(xt,wt−1,bt−1),yt)\n∂wt−1 , where C(f(xt, wt−1, bt−1), yt) is the value\nof the objective function on (input,target) example (xt, yt), when wt−1 are the previous weights and w∗ is its final discretized value of the weights.\nAnother way to conceive of this discretization is as a form of corruption, and hence as a regularizer, and our empirical results confirm this hypothesis. In addition, we can make the discretization errors on different weights approximately cancel each other while keeping a lot of precision by randomizing the discretization appropriately. We propose a form of randomized discretization that preserves the expected value of the discretized weight.\nHence, at training time, BinaryConnect randomly picks one of two values for each weight, for each minibatch, for both the forward and backward propagation phases of backprop. However, the SGD update is accumulated in a real-valued variable storing the parameter.\nAn interesting analogy to understand BinaryConnect is the DropConnect algorithm [21]. Just like BinaryConnect, DropConnect only injects noise to the weights during the propagations. Whereas DropConnect’s noise is added Gaussian noise, BinaryConnect’s noise is a binary sampling process. In both cases the corrupted value has as expected value the clean original value."

The real-valued weights would otherwise grow very large without any impact on the binary weights."

Moreover, we use the ADAM learning rule [27] in all of our CNN experiments. Last but not least, we scale the weights learning rates respectively with the weights initialization coefficients from [25] when optimizing with ADAM, and with the squares of those coefficients when optimizing with SGD or Nesterov momentum [28]. Table 1 illustrates the effectiveness of those tricks."

What are reasonable ways of using such a trained network, i.e., performing test-time inference on new examples? We have considered three reasonable alternatives:\n1. Use the resulting binary weights wb (this makes most sense with the deterministic form of BinaryConnect).\n2. Use the real-valued weights w, i.e., the binarization only helps to achieve faster training but not faster test-time performance.\n3. In the stochastic case, many different networks can be sampled by sampling a wb for each weight according to Eq. 2. The ensemble output of these networks can then be obtained by averaging the outputs from individual networks.\nWe use the first method with the deterministic form of BinaryConnect. As for the stochastic form of BinaryConnect, we focused on the training advantage and used the second method in the experiments, i.e., test-time inference using the real-valued weights. This follows the practice of Dropout methods, where at test-time the “noise” is removed."

Permutationinvariance means that the model must be unaware of the image (2-D) structure of the data (in other words, CNNs are forbidden). Besides, we do not use any data-augmentation, preprocessing or unsupervised pretraining. The MLP we train on MNIST consists in 3 hidden layers of 1024 Rectifier Linear Units (ReLU) [34, 24, 3] and a L2-SVM output layer (L2-SVM has been shown to perform better than Softmax on several classification benchmarks [30, 32]). The square hinge loss is minimized with SGD without momentum. We use an exponentially decaying learning rate. We use Batch Normalization with a minibatch of size 200 to speed up the training. As typically done, we use the\nlast 10000 samples of the training set as a validation set for early stopping and model selection. We report the test error rate associated with the best validation error rate after 1000 epochs (we do not retrain on the validation set).

[37, 38] do not train their DNN with Backpropagation (BP) but with a variant called Expectation Backpropagation (EBP). EBP is based on Expectation Propagation (EP) [41], which is a variational Bayes method used to do inference in probabilistic graphical models. Let us compare their method to ours:\n• It optimizes the weights posterior distribution (which is not binary). In this regard, our method is quite similar as we keep a real-valued version of the weights.\n• It binarizes both the neurons outputs and weights, which is more hardware friendly than just binarizing the weights.\n• It yields a good classification accuracy for fully connected networks (on MNIST) but not (yet) for ConvNets.\n[39, 40] retrain neural networks with ternary weights during forward and backward propagations, i.e.:\n• They train a neural network with high-precision,\n• After training, they ternarize the weights to three possible values−H , 0 and +H and adjust H to minimize the output error,\n• And eventually, they retrain with ternary weights during propagations and high-precision weights during updates.\nBy comparison, we train all the way with binary weights during propagations, i.e., our training procedure could be implemented with efficient specialized hardware avoiding the forward and backward propagations multiplications, which amounts to about 2/3 of the multiplications (cf. Algorithm 1)."

We have shown that it is possible to train DNNs with BinaryConnect on the permutation invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets and achieve nearly state-of-the-art results. The impact of such a method on specialized hardware implementations of deep networks could be major, by removing the need for about 2/3 of the multiplications, and thus potentially allowing to speed-up by a factor of 3 at training time. With the deterministic version of BinaryConnect the impact at test time could be even more important, getting rid of the multiplications altogether and reducing by a factor of at least 16 (from 16 bits single-float precision to single bit precision) the memory requirement of deep networks, which has an impact on the memory to computation bandwidth and on the size of the models that can be run. Future works should extend those results to other models and datasets, and explore getting rid of the multiplications altogether during training, by removing their need from the weight update computation."

As a result, there is much interest in research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL). Binary weights, i.e., weights which are constrained to only two possible values (e.g. -1 or 1), would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, as multipliers are the most space and powerhungry components of the digital implementation of neural networks. We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated. Like other dropout schemes, we show that BinaryConnect acts as regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.",
