      "text" : "Natural language generation plays a critical role in any spoken dialogue system. We present a new approach to natural language generation using recurrent neural networks in an encoderdecoder framework. In contrast with previous work, our model uses both lexicalized and delexicalized versions of slot-value pairs for each dialogue act. This allows our model to learn from all available data, rather than being restricted to learning only from delexicalized slot-value pairs. We show that this helps our model generate more natural sentences with better grammar. We further improve our model’s performance by initializing its weights from a pretrained language model. Human evaluation of our best-performing model indicates that it generates sentences which users find more natural and appealing."

      "text" : "Typical spoken dialogue systems (SDS) comprise a natural language understanding unit, a dialogue manager, and a natural language generator coupled together into a processing pipeline. Most traditional systems with this architecture rely on template-based, hand-crafted rules for natural language generation (NLG). Unfortunately, the required templates are cumbersome to maintain and the overall approach does not scale well to complex domains and datasets. Previous papers have explored alternative approaches such as corpus-based n-gram models Oh and Rudnicky, 2002, tree-based models Stent, Prasad, and Walker, 2004, and Reinforcement Learning models Rieser and Lemon, 2010.\nRecently, models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown promising performance in NLG. Apart from spoken dialogue systems (SDS), RNN-based models have been applied in related domains including image captioning Xu et al., 2015; Karpathy and Li, 2015 and video description Yao et al., 2015, and machine translation Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio, 2014. In the domain of SDS, RNNbased models have been used for NLG in both traditional multi-component processing pipelines Wen et al., 2015b; Wen et al., 2015a and more recent systems designed for end-to-end training Wen et al., 2016a.\nWhile RNN-based end-to-end frameworks have performed well, most systems in use today still depend on multi-component processing pipelines. Text/speech datasets annotated with specific dialogue acts are required for learning-based approaches, but such datasets are unavailable for most domains. This compels the development of effective methods for transfer learning in spoken dialogue systems. Transfer learning can extend the value of dialogue systems to domains which lack sufficient annotated data to support a strong, domain-specific model.\nExisting RNN-based models rely primarily on delexicalized slot-value pairs, while ignoring the lexicalized values. These methods thus ignore linguistic relationships among the lexicalized instances of a slot-value pair, and between lexicalized slot-value pairs and their surrounding context. As illustrated in Figure 1, this approach often leads to grammatically incorrect sentences. Yet, deep neural networks can readily capture the relevant linguistic relationships if they are allowed to learn from the lexicalized slotvalue pairs. We make two key contributions in this paper:\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n03 63\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n1 Ju\nn 20\n• We develop a recurrent encoder-decoder model which uses both lexicalized and delexicalized dialogue act slot-value pairs, and which outperforms existing approaches according to several popular evaluation metrics.\n• We show that the performance of our model can be improved further by transferring weights from a pretrained language model.\nOur model uses beam search decoding, which produces several varied sentences for the same dialogue act slot-value pairs, which is desirable in a practical spoken dialogue system. Human assessment shows that users tend to prefer the sentences generated by our models over those generated by other models.\nIn Section 2, we review related work. In Section 4, we provide a full description of our model. Section 5 describes the datasets we used while developing and testing our model, and our human assessment methodology. Section 6 presents the results of our experiments, compares the performance of our model with that of related models, and shows how pretraining our model using a language modelling task can improve its performance in domains with limited task-specific training data. We conclude in Section 7 with discussion of exciting directions for future work."

      "text" : "Traditional methods for natural language generation have typically relied on handcrafted rule-based generators or rerankers. Oh and Rudnicky (2002) explored corpus-based generation methods. They trained ngram language models for each dialogue act to generate sentences and then selected the best ones using a rule-based reranker. SPaRKy Stent, Prasad, and Walker, 2004 used a tree-based sentence plan generator and then applied a trainable sentence plan ranker. Rieser and Lemon (2010) viewed NLG as planning under uncertainty and used Reinforcement Learning to train a policy for NLG. Kondadadi, Howald, and\nSchilder (2013) used a SVM reranker to further improve the performance of systems which extract a bank of templates from a text corpus.\nLSTM-based RNNs Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997 have achieved wide-spread success in language modelling and machine translation. Bengio, Ducharme, and Vincent (2000) were some of the first to propose using RNNs for language modelling. Later, Mikolov et al. (2010) used a mixture of RNN language models and observed significant reduction in perplexity compared to state-of-the-art n-gram models. Consequently, RNNs have drawn increasing interest in the domain of NLG. Recently, Karpathy and Li (2015), and Vinyals et al. (2015) used RNNs in a multi-modal setting to generate captions for images. Donahue et al. (2015) processed per-frame features from convolutional neural networks using LSTM-RNNs to generate descriptions of videos.\nRNNs have also been successful in the domains of task-oriented and non task-oriented dialogue. Among examples of non task-oriented dialogue, Vinyals and Le (2015) used previous sentences in a conversation as context and trained a model to generate the next sentence using the sequence-to-sequence framework Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le, 2014. Lowe et al. (2015) additionally encoded an unstructured textual knowledge source along with previous responses and context to generate a response for technical support queries.\nFor task-oriented dialogue systems, Wen et al. (2015b) used RNNs to learn to generate delexicalized responses from dialogue-acts. The authors augmented a forward RNN generator with a convolutional neural network sentence reranker to ensure that all the slots in the dialogue-act were generated, and a backward RNN reranker to select the best output sentence. In other work, Wen et al. (2015a) proposed a semantically-controlled LSTM (sc-LSTM) unit for RNNs with a separate “reading” gate that modulates a dialogue act vector to ensure all slots are generated. They used forward and backward RNNs for\nreranking. A recurring problem in such systems is that sufficient domain-specific annotated data is often unavailable. Wen et al. (2016b) trained an out-ofdomain model on counterfeited data (using semantically similar slots from the target domain in place of the slots belonging to the out-of-domain dataset). They found that by fine-tuning the target domain on the out-of-domain trained model, they were able to get satisfactory performance with a small amount of in-domain data.\nEnd-to-end approaches contrasting with the traditional modular approach have grown in popularity. Serban et al. (2016) proposed an end-to-end trainable, hierarchical, recurrent encoder-decoder model for non-goal driven dialogue. Wen et al. (2016a) proposed an approach based on training an end-to-end neural model for a goal-driven SDS which still has modular components. Their model produced delexicalized slots. Their belief tracker was trained separately from the rest of the model using a dedicated supervision signal and their dataset was annotated as part of a novel dataset collection pipeline.\nMost NLG papers in the recent SDS literature compare performance in terms of BLEU scores Papineni et al., 2002 due to lack of a better metric. However, Liu et al. (2016) showed that the BLEU metric does not correlate well with human judgement for domainspecific NLG in dialogue systems. The BLEU score has been widely used in Machine Translation tasks since the corresponding datasets usually provide multiple ground truth sentences and BLEU has high correlation with human judgement in this case. BLEU also tends to correlate better with human judgement when domains are more constrained. We evaluate and compare the performance of our models on BLEU4 Papineni et al., 2002, METEOR Lavie and Agarwal, 2007, ROUGE L Lin, 2004, and CIDEr Vedantam, Zitnick, and Parikh, 2015 metrics. In addition to these automated metrics, we perform human evaluation of our models as described in Section 5.2."

      "heading" : "3 Problem Description",
      "text" : "We decompose each sentence in a dialogue into one or more dialogue acts such as request and inform. Each of these dialogue acts can contain slots such as area, food, and pricerange. Each slot may be assigned a specific value. E.g., the dialogue act in-\nform with slot-value pair pricerange=cheap might correspond to the sentence “it is cheap”. Roughly speaking, a dialogue act corresponds to some way in which a dialogue can be moved forward, e.g. by conveying specific information. A slot corresponds to, e.g. what type of information will be conveyed. The value of a slot is then, e.g. the specific information conveyed. In this paper, we represent a dialogue act slot-value pair as (dialogue act + slot, value) where the first term is delexicalized and the second term is the lexicalized value of the slot. The first term can be derived from simple one-hot representations of the dialogue act and slot type. The second term is more difficult to represent due to its less-restricted, natural form. We will use a parametric model for this term."

At each time-step t, the encoder receives an input vector zt which is formed by concatenating\n1lexicalized delexicalized - semantically controlled - LSTM\nvectors mt and et. The vector mt is a one-hot encoding of the dialogue act slots present in the examples. The vector et is formed by taking the mean of the word embeddings of all the words corresponding to the slot represented by mt. Figure 2 illustrates how the encoder input is created for a given dialogue act. Each turn of the dialogue is composed of one or more such dialogue act slot-value pairs which are input at each time-step to the encoder.\nWe use the LSTM implementation described by Zaremba, Sutskever, and Vinyals (2014):\nit = σ(Wzizt +Whiht−1) (1)\nft = σ(Wzfzt +Whfht−1) (2)\not = σ(Wzozt +Whoht−1) (3)\ngt = tanh(Wzgzt +Whght−1) (4)\nct = ft ct−1 + it gt (5) ht = ot tanh(ct), (6)\nwhere it is the input gate, ft is the forget gate, ot is the output gate, ct is the cell state, ht is the hidden state, zt is the input to the LSTM at time-step t, and indicates element-wise product.\nThe hidden states ht of the forward and backward LSTMs are concatenated and their mean across all the time-steps is fed to the decoder as its input."

As shown by Wen et al. (2015a), the Dialogue Act vector in the sc-LSTM can function similarly to a memory that remembers which slots are yet to be generated. We set the initial value of the Dialogue Act vector d0 as follows:\nd0 =\nM∑\nt=1\nmt, (10)\nwhere M is the number of encoder time-steps. This sum is expressed over all of the one-hot dialogue act slot vectors and is thus a binary vector over all of the dialogue act slots which should be present in our natural language output.\nThe mean hidden state from the encoder called the “context” x is used to initialize h0 and c0 in the decoder,\nh0 = tanh(Whxx+ bhx) (11)\nc0 = tanh(Wcxx+ bcx) (12)\nThe word embedding of the word output in the previous time-step is also an input to the decoder sc-LSTM. For the first time-step, we use a special symbol 〈bos〉 which signifies the beginning of a sentence. The hidden states of the sc-LSTM are passed to softmax layers which produce a word or a delexicalized slot at each time-step. Later, the slots are replaced with their values. The model produces words up to a predefined maximum length or until it produces the special symbol 〈eos〉. At the time of training, we use the ground truth word for the previous time-step instead of the predicted output. At test time, we use beam search to over-generate several candidate responses. The decoder is trained to output delexicalized slots and we later fill in the values of the corresponding slots.\nOur encoder-decoder ld-sc-LSTM model is summarized in Figure 3."

We evaluated our model with several popular metrics used in the NLP and MT literature, and also asked humans to evaluate the generated responses. Our model consistently outperformed existing RNN-based approaches on the CF restaurant domain dataset and the publicly available DSTC2 dataset. Our transfer learning experiments showed that bootstrapping with weights from a pretrained language model can result in the generation of better\nresponses. As could be expected, exposing the deep neural network to the complete data (lexicalized and delexicalized) led to a more powerful model.\nIn the future, we plan to use an attention model over the recurrent encoder. Attention models are more intuitive for variable-length sequential input, do not lose information due to pooling, and can be visualized to see where the model focuses during the generation process. This could remove the need for the sc-LSTM unit and the Dialogue Act vector. To reduce the encoder slot value vocabulary size in our models when scaling to larger datasets, it would make sense to tokenize some word categories like proper nouns, singular integers, plural integers, etc. in the slot values. It would be insightful to more rigorously explore the effect of using out-of-domain corpora for transfer learning, and incorporating a backward reranker may also improve performance, as has been observed for other models in the literature."

We present a new approach to natural language generation using recurrent neural networks in an encoderdecoder framework. In contrast with previous work, our model uses both lexicalized and delexicalized versions of slot-value pairs for each dialogue act. This allows our model to learn from all available data, rather than being restricted to learning only from delexicalized slot-value pairs. We show that this helps our model generate more natural sentences with better grammar. We further improve our model’s performance by initializing its weights from a pretrained language model. Human evaluation of our best-performing model indicates that it generates sentences which users find more natural and appealing.",
