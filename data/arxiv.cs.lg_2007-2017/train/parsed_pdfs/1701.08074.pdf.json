The practicality of a direct model-based approach is compromised by two challenges, namely scalability due to the large dimensionality of the problem and the system identification required to identify an accurate model. To help in mitigating these problems, this paper leverages on recent developments in reinforcement learning in combination with a market-based multi-agent system to obtain a scalable solution that obtains a significant performance improvement in a practical learning time. The control approach is applied on a scenario comprising 100 thermostatically controlled loads connected to a radial district heating network supplied by a central combined heat and power plant.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "A District Heating Network (DHN) offers the opportunity to provide the collective heat demand of a cluster of geographically concentrated buildings through a set of central heat sources. This allows the use of centralized production techniques with an efficiency exceeding that of distributed production. Combined Heat and Power plants (CHPs) are a prominent example, as 80- 90% of the primary energy is converted to heat and electricity [1, 2, 3]. But also heat from a geothermal source [4] or excess heat resulting from an industrial process can be used as primary heat source. The heat from the sources is transported through a network of pipes using water as a medium. At each building, heat is extracted in a local substation, resulting in water at a lower temperature, being transported back to the different heat sources. A typical operational model at the production side is to modulate the power of the heat sources to keep the supply temperature close to a design setting. This basically results in the thermal supply following the thermal demand. Heat storage however, can provide demand flexibility enabling flexibility at the production side through demand response approaches. This flexibility allows operational opportunities for cost reduction, examples being peak shaving/valley filling [5] and energy arbitrage by selling the electricity production of the CHP on the wholesale market [1, 2, 6]. Well referenced embodiments of local heat storage are Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs) [7] such as a hot water storage tank [8] where the heat is stored directly in the water, but also the building envelope [1, 7, 9, 10]\n1Bert J. Claessens is currently working at REstore and can be contacted at bert.claessens@restore.eu\ncan be used to store heat. From an operational point of view, controlling a cluster of TCLs connected to a DHN can be considered as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty. One well studied control paradigm for operational management of a DHN is that of Model Predictive Control (MPC) [11, 12]. When projected on the setting of TCLs connected to a DHN, this requires defining control actions for the central sources as well as for all individual TCLs. Developing a practical implementation requires one to tackle the problem of scalability, as the state dimensionality and number of control variables quickly result in an intractable optimization problem. This is complicated further by non-linear system dynamics. A second important challenge is that of system identification [13] as identifying an accurate model of both the DHN and all TCLs requires significant amounts of not readily available data and expert knowledge.\nThis work contributes in mitigating operational control challenges for TCLs connected to a DHN by working on these two problems.\nScalability: To obtain scalability, a heuristic dispatch approach as described in [14], is applied to the setting of TLCs connected to a DHN. Instead of calculating an individual control action for each TCL, this approach calculates a collective control action for the entire cluster of TCLs. A market-based dispatch algorithm is used to translate the collective control action into individual control actions.\nSystem identification: Driven by recent developments in Batch Reinforcement Learning (BRL) [15, 16], a blind modelfree approach is considered. As a BRL technique needs no prior information on the system dynamics, this strongly relaxes the system identification requirements, at the cost of a learning time\nPreprint submitted to Energy and Buildings February 27, 2017\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n08 07\n4v 2\n[ cs\n.S Y\n] 2\n4 Fe\nb 20\n17\nand sub-optimal performance. In Section 2, an overview is given on related research regarding the control of large clusters of TLCs and model based controllers for DHN. In Section 3, the decision-making problem is formalized as a Markov Decision Problem (MDP). In Section 4, the control approach as used in this work, is described in detail. In Section 5, an evaluation of the controller performance is provided based upon a simulation scenario comprising 100 TCLs connected to a DHN. The simulation scenario is sufficiently complex to evaluate the contributions of the control approach, but also comprehensibly enough to allow for an analysis which is not obfuscated by complexity of the scenario. Finally in Section 6, the conclusions are provided, as is a discussion on the results."

      "text" : "The curse of dimensionality [17] lurks around the corner when managing the flexibility present in a large cluster of TCLs. This is attributed to the dimensionality of the state space and the large amount of control variables. To this end, significant recent work [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] has focused on providing computationally tractable solutions for large clusters of TCLs. In [23], a cluster of flexibility carriers represented by generic tank models is considered with the objective of providing day-ahead modulation services to a transmission system operator. Even though all models are linear, a formal branch and bound based optimization approach quickly becomes intractable. The main contribution of the work is a heuristic method including a state dependent dispatch algorithm in combination with an iterated local search technique. High quality solutions to a test problem are presented, obtained within a practical calculation time. The results of a related approach applied in an actual field test comprising 54 heat pumps has been presented in [21]. Here an aggregated model of reduced dimensionality was used to determine power set points for the entire cluster in a MPC approach. A heuristic dispatch algorithm was used to convert the aggregated set points to local control actions in the portfolio. In [22] a data-driven decision framework has been developed using a meta-heuristic optimization technique. An approach from the same solution class is presented in [13]. Here a problem of energy arbitrage with a large cluster of TCLs is presented. An aggregated system model is used in the form of a state bin transition model [24]. All TCLs are clustered, based upon their position within their dead-band, resulting in a state vector containing the fraction of TCLs in each state bin. A linear state bin transition model describes the dynamics of this state vector, the dimensionality of which is independent of the number of TCLs in the cluster. This model is used in an MPC resulting in a control action for each state bin. A simple heuristic is used to dispatch the control signals to individual control\nactions at device level. Although a simplified first order TCL model has been used, the results presented in [13] show that careful system identification is required. Moreover, in [25] it was argued that a first order TCL model is found lacking, further complicating system identification. A different approach is that of distributed optimization [26, 27], where the centralized optimization problem is decomposed over distributed agents who interact through virtual prices. For example in [28], distributed MPC through dual decomposition was presented as a means for energy arbitrage of a large cluster of TCLs subjected to a coupling constraint related to an infrastructure limitation. Although mathematical performance guarantees can be provided under sufficient assumptions, the method heavily relies on the accuracy of local models and has stringent communication and computation requirements due to its iterative character. An example of how an MPC controller can be used at building level is detailed in [12]."

      "text" : "When implementing a model-based control approach for a DHN, be it centralized or distributed, one is confronted with (1) the non-linearities in the dynamics of a DHN, and (2) the slow time scales compared to e.g. an electric network [29]. Taking these effects into account is essential for a good performance of the controller. Several model-based optimization approaches have been identified in literature, explicitly incorporating the dynamics of the DHN. For example in [11] a simplified model has been derived that is used together with sequential quadratic programming. In [30] approximate dynamic programming [31] has been used taking advantage of permutational symmetries of the DHN dynamics. A model-based approach using fuzzy direct matrix control to mitigate non-linearities of the DHN dynamics can be found in [32]. Although model-based solutions can have excellent performance, accurate models of the DHN and the consumers coupled to the DHN are required, tuning and shaping these models is considered an expert task making a generic roll-out of this technology challenging [33].\nA scalable model-free solution solution is presented in [34], here a market-based multi-agent system is used to match thermal and electric demand and supply. Although this approach is scalable, it does not take into account the DHN dynamics and follows a myopic control strategy. An approach combining an auction-based multi-agent system with a central optimization, taking into account a forecast of the total heat demand can be found in [1]."

In a first step, (1) all relevant (and practically available) state information is collected, e.g. the temperature information from the TCLs. From this information a limited set of features [17] is extracted, resulting in a low-dimensional representation of the system state.

Furthermore measurements of the outside air temperature Tout,t are assumed available, as is the water temperature from a subset of nodes in the supply side of the DHN, i.e. Tn,t,∀n ∈ Ns ⊂ N and the return side4 Tn,t,∀n ∈ Nr ⊂ N . This information is further aggregated, formally this can be seen as a feature extraction [17], which reduces the dimensionality of the decision-making process. In this work, the feature extraction is handcrafted, resulting in the following effective state vector xt.\nxt = ( 〈 T at 〉 ,Tout,t,Ts,Tr) (17)〈\nT at 〉 = ∑ d∈D T ad,t |D| (18)\nTs = ∑\nn∈Ns Tn,t |Ns|\n(19) Tr = ∑\nn∈Nr Tn,t |Nr |\n(20)\nAlthough, more generic dimension reduction techniques such as autoencoders can be used [44], the aim of this work is to understand what performance can be obtained starting from this limited state description. Alternatively, a convolutional neural network as presented by the the authors in [45] could be used to automatically extract relevant state-time features, allowing to add historic observations to the state [16, 17].\nTo facilitate the dispatch step as explained in Section 4.3, a bid-function is defined for every TCL [5, 14, 46]. In [5], the bid function of a device is expressed as the electric power consumed versus a heuristic (pr). Above a corner value pc,d the bid\n4Only temperatures at a limited set of nodes are assumed available.\nfunction is zero:\npc,d = 1 − S oC = T\na d − T ad,t T a d − T ad . (21)\nDetermining this heuristic is considered relatively straightforward as it requires only the air temperature as measured by the thermostat and the upper and lower temperature bound. Defining the thermal power extracted from the DHN by a TCL when switched on, is less so [29]. To relax this requirement we assume an estimate of the flowrate (Ld) when switched on is available. The flowrate Ld is defined as follows. First the set temperature of the indoor heat supply system, which is a function of the outdoor temperature, is calculated. Then, a model for the substation heat exchanger is used to determine the flow rate extracted from the DHN, by which the outlet temperature of the heat exchanger meets the set temperature. Using this value instead of the actual power results in the following bid function for building d:\nbd(pr) = Ld(1 − H(pr + S oC − 1)), (22)\nhere H corresponds to the heaviside function.\nAlgorithm 1 Overview fitted Q-iteration Input: FD = { (xls , uls , cls , x ′ ls ), ls = 1, ..., ns } , regression algo-\nrithm [47]. 1: let Q̂0 be zero everywhere on X × U 2: repeat 3: for ls = 1, ..., ns do 4: Q′l+1,ls ← rls + minu′ Q̂l(x ′ ls , u′) 5: end for 6: use regression to obtain Q̂l+1 from{(\n(xls , uls ),Q ′ l+1,ls\n) , ls = 1, ..., ns } 7: until Q̂l+1 is satisfactory 8: return Q̂ = Q̂l+1"

The control action ut is selected for the entire cluster which is projected onto individual control actions as described in Section 4.3. One of the main goals of this work is to explore to what extent (model-free) reinforcement learning can be used to determine π. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a model-free control approach that learns a policy by interaction with the system [40]. In recent literature, RL (mainly in the form of Q-learning [48, 49, 50]) has been presented as an effective model-free learning approach for DR applications. The practicality however, suffers from slow convergence [15, 40] and the curse of dimensionality [17]. These challenges can be partially mitigated by using past interactions and appropriate function approximators in a BRL strategy [40, 51]. A popular BRL approach is that of Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI) introduced by Ernst et al. in [52], especially in combination with extremely randomized trees as regression technique [47]. In\n[42] the authors conclude that especially for non-linear control problems, FQI can be a valuable alternative to MPC approaches with the extra advantage that FQI is a blind technique. Moreover, FQI and MPC can strengthen each other [42, 53]. Although several BRL techniques have been proposed in the literature [36, 52, 44], this work focuses on FQI using extremely randomized trees as regression algorithm [47]. Comparison to the performance of other BRL approaches is considered outside the scope of this work.\nFollowing [52], an approximation of the state-action value function Q(xt, ut), Q̂(xt, ut) is built on a daily basis5 from a batch of four-tuples FD:\nFD = { (xls , uls , cls , x ′ ls ), ls = 1, ..., ns } .

To this end, a Proportional Integrator (PI) controller (at a central level) managing the flow rates at the different buildings is used. Since hydraulic effects occur nearly instantaneous in a DHN, this will have a direct effect on the flow rate at the source, influencing the power at the source side as the supply setpoint is assumed to be constant in the simulations [29].

The energy prices are taken from the Belgian day-ahead market [56], the gas price is set at 38.6e/MWh [57]. As day-ahead prices can be predicted with a reasonable accuracy [58], these are considered deterministic in this evaluation. Furthermore, the off line policy calculation (Algorithm 1) is performed only on a daily basis6, and the simulation period covers up to 80 days. The results of this numerical experiment are depicted in Figure 5. In the upper\n6 This is for practical reasons as the calculation of a policy typically takes 20 minutes on a Intel, 2.5 GHz, 8GB RAM\nrow, the daily cost is depicted, both for the approach presented in this paper and a default controller. The default controller applies a hysteresis controller at every building and a fixed DHN inlet temperature [29]. The cumulative cost is depicted in the second row. It can be observed that initially the daily cost obtained with the BRL controller is similar to the cost of the default controller. However, as the BRL controller starts gathering more interactions, its daily cost for energy starts decreasing. To evaluate the performance during colder days, the first 20 days with a lower average outside temperature where repeated, with a policy constructed with all data. These results are depicted in the right column. The performance is significantly improved, and the daily cost is decreased with about 20%. Although these results are positive, they do not provide an objective metric of the quality of the control approach, since this percentage is biased by the actual price profiles. To this end, a lower bound on the daily cost is provided by taking the total energy consumed during each day and distributing this over those hours with the highest price assuming the CHP running at full capacity. This is considered an over-optimistic benchmark. In the third row of Figure 5 the following metric is depicted:\nM = FQI − DC LB − DC , (27)\nwith DC the daily cost of the default controller, LB the lower bound on the daily cost and FQI the daily cost obtained with the solution presented in this work. A metric of 0 corresponding to the same performance as the default controller, whilst a metric of 1 corresponding to the lower bound solution. From Figure 5 it is observed that the performance metric gradually increases to a value of around 60-70%, also for the colder days as depicted in the right column.\nA snapshot of the daily power profiles of a mature controller\ncompared to the default controller is depicted in Figure 6. It can be seen that the controller produces heat when energy prices are high. It is meaningful to understand that a default controller already has a reasonable performance as the heat demand is typically largest when also the wholesale price is highest. This correlation is however expected to decrease as more renewable energy comes in the production mix, making wholesale prices more volatile."

      "heading" : "5.4. peak shaving",
      "text" : "In the second experiment, peak shaving is considered. The summarizing results are depicted in Figure 7. In the top graph one can see the daily peak in thermal power obtained with the default controller and the BRL approach. The second graph gives the average daily ambient temperature. The daily maximum power peak indeed reduces with time. To make the performance more visible, also the load duration curves are plotted for the first and the last 50 days, both for the BRL approach and the default controller. The first 50 days there is limited improvement over the default controller, however for the subsequent period one can clearly observe the effect of the controller from the load duration curves. A lower bound is depicted by plotting the average power corresponding to the daily energy consumed by the default control approach. Note, on day seven (top graph in Figure 7), the profile obtained with BRL results a high peak power, which is attributed to an exploration step (24). The final performance is visualized more clearly in Figure 8 where the power profile is plotted for a mature controller. Indeed, the thermal power follows a constant profile compared to the default control case. A visualization of the policy obtained by the BRL controller is presented in Figure 9, here the average power set point is plotted versus the initial indoor temperature state and the expected average daily outdoor temperature. As is conceived logical, the setpoint decreases with increasing outside temperature and average air temperature."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusions and future work",
      "text" : "In this work the control problem of a cluster of thermostatically controlled loads connected to a district heating network is addressed by assessing the performance of a control approach comprising a model-free reinforcement learning technique in combination with a market-based multi-agent system. The performance of the controller has been evaluated for two distinct scenarios, i.e. energy arbitrage and peak shaving. In the evaluation a detailed district heating network model has been used including hydraulic and thermal dynamics. For the energy arbitrage scenario, solutions are obtained that reach over 65% of the available optimization potential after a learning period of 40 to 60 days. Knowing that the policy is updated on a daily base, this is considered a promising result. Also for\nIn si\nd e\nT em\np er\nat u\nre [ ° C\n]\nOutside Temperature [° C]\nset point [kW]\n0 5 10 15\n19.5\n19.55\n19.6\n19.65\n19.7\n19.75\n19.8\n19.85\n19.9\n19.95\n20\n600\n650\n700\n750\n800\n850\n900\nFigure 9: Policy map as obtained with the BRL approach for the peak shaving/valley filling scenario.\nthe peak shaving/valley filling scenario, promising results have been obtained, since a clear performance improvement is observed. These results support a practical implementation and coming of age of reinforcement learning techniques.\nTo understand the potential of completely model-free control a direct implementation of fitted Q-iteration as presented in [40] has been used. However as discussed in [42], combining general domain knowledge with a model-free approach is expected to result in an improved performance at a reduced learning time. This domain knowledge can be incorporated through e.g. information regarding the shape of the policy [40] or through using a model similar as in [53]. A second point of future research is directed at more automated feature extraction techniques such as autoencoders [16], which is also expected to result in a reduced learning time."

The practicality of a direct model-based approach is compromised by two challenges, namely scalability due to the large dimensionality of the problem and the system identification required to identify an accurate model. To help in mitigating these problems, this paper leverages on recent developments in reinforcement learning in combination with a market-based multi-agent system to obtain a scalable solution that obtains a significant performance improvement in a practical learning time. The control approach is applied on a scenario comprising 100 thermostatically controlled loads connected to a radial district heating network supplied by a central combined heat and power plant. Both for an energy arbitrage and a peak shaving objective, the control approach requires 60 days to obtain a performance within 65% of a theoretical lower bound on the cost.",
