A soft onstraint is a fun tion de ned on a olle tion of variables whi h asso iates some measure of desirability with ea h possible ombination of values for those variables. However, the ru ial question of the omputational omplexity of nding the optimal solution to a olle tion of soft onstraints has so far re eived very little attention. In this paper we identify a lass of soft binary onstraints for whi h the problem of nding the optimal solution is tra table. In other words, we show that for any given set of su h onstraints, there exists a polynomial time algorithm to determine the assignment having the best overall ombined measure of desirability. This tra table lass in ludes many ommonly-o urring soft onstraints, su h as \\as near as possible\" or \\as soon as possible after\", as well as risp onstraints su h as \\greater than\". Finally, we show that this tra table lass is maximal, in the sense that adding any other form of soft binary onstraint whi h is not in the lass gives rise to a lass of problems whi h is NP-hard."

      "text" : "The onstraint satisfa tion framework is widely a knowledged as a onvenient and eÆ ient way to model and solve a wide variety of problems arising in Arti ial Intelligen e, in luding planning (Kautz & Selman, 1992) and s heduling (van Beek, 1992), image pro essing (Montanari, 1974) and natural language understanding (Allen, 1995).\nIn the standard framework a onstraint is usually taken to be a predi ate, or relation, spe ifying the allowed ombinations of values for some xed olle tion of variables: we will refer to su h onstraints here as risp onstraints. A number of authors have suggested that the usefulness of the onstraint satisfa tion framework ould be greatly enhan ed by extending the de nition of a onstraint to in lude also soft onstraints, whi h allow di erent measures of desirability to be asso iated with di erent ombinations of values (Bistarelli et al., 1997, 1999). In this extended framework a onstraint an be seen as a fun tion,\n2004 AI A ess Foundation. All rights reserved.\nmapping ea h possible ombination of values to a measure of desirability or undesirability. Finding a solution to a set of onstraints then means nding an assignment of values to all of the variables whi h has the best overall ombined desirability measure.\nExample 1.1 Consider an optimization problem with 2n variables, v\n1\n; v\n2\n; : : : ; v\n2n\n, where\nwe wish to assign ea h variable an integer value in the range 1; 2; : : : ; n, subje t to the following restri tions:\nEa h variable v\ni\nshould be assigned a value that is as lose as possible to i=2.\nEa h pair of variables v\ni\n, v\n2i\nshould be assigned a pair of values that are as lose as\npossible to ea h other.\nTo model this situation we might impose the following soft onstraints:\nA unary onstraint on ea h v\ni\nspe i ed by a fun tion\ni\n,\nwhere\ni\n(x) = (x i=2)\n2\n.\nA binary onstraint on ea h pair v\ni\n; v\n2i\nspe i ed by a fun tion Æ\nr\n,\nwhere Æ\nr\n(x; y) = jx yj\nr\nfor some r 1.\nWe would then seek an assignment to all of the variables whi h minimizes the sum of all of these onstraint fun tions,\n2n\nX\ni=1\ni\n(v\ni\n) +\nn\nX\ni=1\nÆ\nr\n(v\ni\n; v\n2i\n):\nThe ost of allowing additional exibility in the spe i ation of onstraints, in order to model requirements of this kind, is generally an in rease in omputational diÆ ulty. In the ase of risp onstraints there has been onsiderable progress in identifying lasses of\nonstraints whi h are tra table, in the sense that there exists a polynomial time algorithm to determine whether or not any olle tion of onstraints from su h a lass an be simultaneously satis ed (Bulatov, 2003; Feder & Vardi, 1998; Jeavons et al., 1997). In the ase of soft onstraints there has been a detailed investigation of the tra table ases for Boolean problems (where ea h variable has just 2 possible values) (Creignou et al., 2001), but very little investigation of the tra table ases over larger nite domains, even though there are many signi ant results in the literature on ombinatorial optimization whi h are learly relevant to this question (Nemhauser & Wolsey, 1988).\nThe only previous work we have been able to nd on the omplexity of non-Boolean soft onstraints is a paper by Khatib et al. (2001), whi h des ribes a family of tra table soft temporal onstraints. However, the framework for soft onstraints used by Khatib et al. (2001) is di erent from the one we use here, and the results are not dire tly omparable. We dis uss the relationship between this earlier work and ours more fully in Se tion 5.\nIn this paper we make use of the idea of a submodular fun tion (Nemhauser & Wolsey, 1988) to identify a general lass of soft onstraints for whi h there exists a polynomial time solution algorithm. Submodular fun tions are widely used in e onomi s and operational resear h (Fujishige, 1991; Nemhauser & Wolsey, 1988; Topkis, 1998), and the notion of submodularity provides a kind of dis rete analogue of onvexity (Lov asz, 1983).\nSubmodular fun tions are usually de ned (Nemhauser & Wolsey, 1988) as real-valued fun tions on sets (whi h may be viewed as Boolean tuples), but we onsider here the more general ase of fun tions on tuples over an arbitrary nite domain (as in Topkis, 1978). We also allow our fun tions to take in nite values. By establishing a new de omposition result for binary submodular fun tions of this kind, we obtain a ubi time algorithm to nd the optimal assignment for any set of soft onstraints whi h an be de ned using them (su h as the onstraints in Example 1.1). Be ause our algorithm is spe ially devised for submodular fun tions that are expressed as a ombination of binary fun tions, it is mu h more eÆ ient in this ase than existing general algorithms for submodular fun tion minimization (S hrijver, 2000; Iwata et al., 2001).\nWe give a number of examples to illustrate the many di erent forms of soft onstraint that an be de ned using binary submodular fun tions, and we also show that this lass is maximal, in the sense that no other form of binary onstraint an be added to the lass without sa ri ing tra tability."

      "text" : "To identify a tra table lass of soft onstraints we will need to restri t the set of fun tions that are used to spe ify onstraints. Su h a restri ted set of possible fun tions will be alled a soft onstraint language.\nDe nition 2.1 Let D and E be xed sets. A soft onstraint language over D with evaluations in E is de ned to be a set of fun tions, , su h that ea h 2 is a fun tion from D k to E, for some k 2 N, where k is alled the arity of .\nFor any given hoi e of soft onstraint language, , we de ne an asso iated soft onstraint satisfa tion problem, whi h we will all sCSP( ), as follows.\nDe nition 2.2 Let be a soft onstraint language over D with evaluations in E. An instan e P of sCSP( ) is a triple hV;D;Ci, where:\nV is a nite set of variables, whi h must be assigned values from the set D.\nC is a set of soft onstraints. Ea h 2 C is a pair h ; i where: is a list of variables, of length j j, alled the s ope of ; and is an element of of arity j j, alled the evaluation fun tion of .\nThe evaluation fun tion will be used to spe ify some measure of desirability or undesirability asso iated with ea h possible tuple of values over .\nTo omplete the de nition of a soft onstraint satisfa tion problem we need to de ne how the evaluations obtained from ea h evaluation fun tion are ombined and ompared, in order to de ne what onstitutes an optimal overall solution. Several alternative mathemati al approa hes to this issue have been suggested in the literature:\nIn the semiring based approa h (Bistarelli et al., 1997, 1999), the set of possible evaluations, E, is assumed to be an algebrai stru ture equipped with two binary operations, satisfying the axioms of a semiring. One example of su h a stru ture is the real interval [0; 1℄, equipped with the operations min and max, whi h orresponds\nto the onjun tive fuzzy CSP framework (Rosenfeld et al., 1976; Ruttkay, 1994). Another example is the set f0; 1; 2; : : :g[f1g, equipped with the operations max and plus, whi h orresponds to the weighted CSP framework (Bistarelli et al., 1999).\nIn the valued CSP approa h (Bistarelli et al., 1999), the set of possible evaluations E is assumed to be a totally ordered algebrai stru ture with a top and bottom element and a single monotoni binary operation known as aggregation. One example of su h a stru ture is the set of multisets over some nite ordered set together with a top element, equipped with the operation of multiset union, whi h orresponds to the lexi ographi CSP framework (Bistarelli et al., 1999).\nFor our purposes, we require the same properties as the valued CSP approa h, with the additional requirement that the aggregation operation has a partial inverse, su h that evaluations other than the top element may be \\ an elled\" when o urring on both sides of an inequality. For simpli ity, we shall assume throughout this paper that the set of evaluations E is either the set of non-negative integers together with in nity, or else the set of nonnegative real numbers together with in nity 1 . Hen e, throughout this paper the bottom element in the evaluation stru ture is 0, the top element is 1, and for any two evaluations\n1\n;\n2\n2 E, the aggregation of\n1\nand\n2\nis given by\n1\n+\n2\n2 E. Moreover, when\n1\n2\nwe also have\n1\n2\n2 E. (Note that we set 1 1 =1).\nThe elements of the set E are used to represent di erent measure of undesirability, or penalties, asso iated with di erent ombinations of values. This allows us to omplete the de nition of a soft onstraint satisfa tion problem with the following simple de nition of a solution to an instan e.\nDe nition 2.3 For any soft onstraint satisfa tion problem instan e P = hV;D;Ci, an assignment for P is a mapping t from V to D. The evaluation of an assignment t, denoted\nP\n(t), is given by the sum (i.e., aggregation) of the evaluations for the restri tions of t\nonto ea h onstraint s ope, that is,\nP\n(t) =\nX\nhhv\n1\n; v\n2\n; : : : ; v\nk\ni; i2C\n(t(v\n1\n); t(v\n2\n); : : : ; t(v\nk\n)):\nA solution to P is an assignment with the smallest possible evaluation, and the question is to nd a solution.\nExample 2.4 For any standard onstraint satisfa tion problem instan e P with risp onstraints, we an de ne a orresponding soft onstraint satisfa tion problem instan e b P in whi h the range of the evaluation fun tions of all the onstraints is the set f0;1g. For ea h\nrisp onstraint of P, we de ne a orresponding soft onstraint b of\nb P with the same s ope;\nthe evaluation fun tion of b maps ea h tuple allowed by to 0, and ea h tuple disallowed by to 1.\nIn this ase the evaluation of an assignment t for\nb P equals the minimal possible evalu-\nation, 0, if and only if t satis es all of the risp onstraints in P .\n1. Many of our results an be extended to more general evaluation stru tures, su h as the stri tly monotoni\nstru tures des ribed by Cooper (2003), but we will not pursue this idea here.\nExample 2.5 For any standard onstraint satisfa tion problem instan e P with risp onstraints, we an de ne a orresponding soft onstraint satisfa tion problem instan e P # in whi h the range of the evaluation fun tions of all the onstraints is the set f0; 1g. For ea h\nrisp onstraint of P , we de ne a orresponding soft onstraint\n#\nof P\n#\nwith the same\ns ope; the evaluation fun tion of\n#\nmaps ea h tuple allowed by to 0, and ea h tuple\ndisallowed by to 1.\nIn this ase the evaluation of an assignment t for P\n#\nequals the number of risp on-\nstraints in P whi h are violated by t. Hen e a solution to P\n#\norresponds to an assignment\nwhi h violates the minimal number of onstraints of P , and hen e satis es the maximal number of onstraints of P. Finding assignments of this kind is generally referred to as solving the Max-CSP problem (Freuder & Walla e, 1992; Larrosa et al., 1999).\nNote that the problem of nding a solution to a soft onstraint satisfa tion problem is an NP optimization problem, that is, it lies in the omplexity lass NPO (see Creignou et al., 2001 for a formal de nition of this lass). If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm whi h\nnds a solution to all instan es of sCSP( ), then we shall say that sCSP( ) is tra table. On the other hand, if there is a polynomial-time redu tion from some NP- omplete problem to sCSP( ), then we shall say that sCSP( ) is NP-hard.\nExample 2.6 Let be a soft onstraint language over D, where jDj = 2. In this ase sCSP( ) is a lass of Boolean soft onstraint satisfa tion problems.\nIf we restri t even further, by only allowing fun tions with range f0;1g, as in Example 2.4, then sCSP( ) orresponds pre isely to a standard Boolean risp onstraint satisfa tion problem. Su h problems are sometimes known as Generalized Satisfiability problems (S haefer, 1978). The omplexity of sCSP( ) for su h restri ted sets has been ompletely hara terised, and it has been shown that there are pre isely six tra table\nases (S haefer, 1978; Creignou et al., 2001).\nAlternatively, if we restri t by only allowing fun tions with range f0; 1g, as in Example 2.5, then sCSP( ) orresponds pre isely to a standard Boolean maximum satis ability problem, in whi h the aim is to satisfy the maximum number of risp onstraints. Su h problems are sometimes known as Max-Sat problems (Creignou et al., 2001). The omplexity of sCSP( ) for su h restri ted sets has been ompletely hara terised, and it has been shown that there are pre isely three tra table ases (see Theorem 7.6 of Creignou et al., 2001).\nWe note, in parti ular, that when ontains just the single binary fun tion\nXOR\nde ned by\nXOR\n(x; y) =\n0 if x 6= y 1 otherwise\nthen sCSP( ) orresponds to the Max-Sat problem for the ex lusive-or predi ate, whi h is known to be NP-hard (see Lemma 7.4 of Creignou et al., 2001).\nExample 2.7 Let be a soft onstraint language over D = f1; 2; : : : ;Mg, where M 3, and assume that ontains just the set of all unary fun tions, together with the single binary fun tion\nEQ\nde ned by\nEQ\n(x; y) =\n0 if x = y 1 otherwise.\nEven in this very simple ase it an be shown that sCSP( ) is NP-hard, by redu tion from the Minimum 3-terminal Cut problem (Dahlhaus et al., 1994). An instan e of this problem onsists of an undire ted graph (V;E) in whi h ea h edge e 2 E has an asso iated weight, together with a set of distinguished verti es, fv\n1\n; v\n2\n; v\n3\ng V , known as terminals.\nThe problem is to nd a set of edges with the smallest possible total weight whose removal dis onne ts ea h possible pair of terminals. Su h a set is known as a minimum 3-terminal\nut.\nTo obtain the redu tion to sCSP( ), let I be an instan e ofMinimum 3-Terminal Cut\nonsisting of the graph hV;Ei with terminals fv\n1\n; v\n2\n; v\n3\ng. We onstru t a orresponding\ninstan e P\nI\nof sCSP( ) as follows. The variables of P\nI\norrespond to the set of verti es V .\nFor ea h edge fv\ni\n; v\nj\ng 2 E, add a binary soft onstraint with s ope hv\ni\n; v\nj\ni and evaluation\nfun tion\nEQ\n, as above. Finally, for ea h terminal v\ni\n2 fv\n1\n; v\n2\n; v\n3\ng, add a unary onstraint\non the variable v\ni\nwith evaluation fun tion\ni\n, de ned as follows:\ni\n(x) =\n0 if x = i jEj+ 1 otherwise\nIt is straightforward to he k that the number of edges in a minimum 3-terminal ut of I is equal to the evaluation of a solution to P\nI\n.\nThe examples above indi ate that generalizing the onstraint satisfa tion framework to in-\nlude soft onstraints does indeed in rease the omputational omplexity, in general. For example, the standard 2-Satisfiability problem is tra table, but the soft onstraint satisfa tion problem involving only the single binary Boolean fun tion,\nXOR\n, de ned at the\nend of Example 2.6, is NP-hard. Similarly, the standard onstraint satisfa tion problem involving only risp unary onstraints and equality onstraints is learly trivial, but the soft\nonstraint satisfa tion problem involving only soft unary onstraints and a soft version of\nthe equality onstraint, spe i ed by the fun tion\nEQ\nde ned in Example 2.7, is NP-hard.\nHowever, in the next two se tions we will show that it is possible to identify a large lass\nof fun tions for whi h the orresponding soft onstraint satisfa tion problem is tra table."

It is lear from Remark 4.2 that the table of values for a real-valued binary submodular fun tion is a Monge matrix, and onversely, every square Monge matrix an be viewed as a table of values for a binary submodular fun tion.\nIt was shown by Rudolf and Woeginger (1995) that an arbitrary Monge matrix an be de omposed as a sum of simpler matri es. We now obtain a orresponding result for binary submodular fun tions, by showing that any binary submodular fun tion an be de omposed as a sum of generalized interval fun tions. (The result we obtain below is slightly more general than the de omposition result for Monge matri es given by Rudolf and Woeginger (1995), be ause we are allowing submodular fun tions to take in nite values.) Using this de omposition result, we will show that the set of unary and binary submodular fun tions is a tra table soft onstraint language.\nTo obtain our de omposition result, we use the following te hni al lemma.\nLemma 4.4 Let D be a totally ordered set and let : D\n2\n! E be a binary submodular\nfun tion. For any a; b; 2 D su h that a b , if there exists e 2 D with (e; b) = 0, then for all x 2 D we have (x; b) max( (x; a); (x; )).\nProof: Assume that (e; b) = 0.\nIf x > e then, by the submodularity of , we have (x; b) (x; b) + (e; a)\n(x; a) + (e; b) = (x; a)\nIf x < e then, by the submodularity of , we have (x; b) (x; b) + (e; )\n(e; b) + (x; ) = (x; ).\nIf e = x then (x; b) = 0.\nHen e, in all ases the result holds.\nLemma 4.5 Let D be a totally ordered nite set. A binary fun tion, : D\n2\n! E is\nsubmodular if and only if it an be expressed as a sum of generalized interval fun tions on D. Furthermore, a de omposition of this form an be obtained in O(jDj 3 ) time.\nProof: By the observations already made, any fun tion whi h is equal to a sum of generalized interval fun tions is learly submodular.\nTo establish the onverse, we use indu tion on the tightness of , denoted ( ), that is,\nthe number of pairs for whi h the value of is non-zero.\nAssume that is a binary submodular fun tion. If ( ) = 0, then is identi ally zero, so the result holds trivially. Otherwise, by indu tion, we shall assume that the result holds for all binary submodular fun tions that have a lower tightness.\nTo simplify the notation, we shall assume that D = f1; 2; : : : ;Mg, with the usual order-\ning.\nWe will say that a value a 2 D is in onsistent if, for all y 2 D, (a; y) = 1. If every a 2 D is in onsistent, then all values of are 1, so it is equal to the generalized interval fun tion 1\n[1;M ℄\n, and the result holds. Otherwise, if there exists at least one in onsistent\nvalue, then we an nd a pair of values a; b 2 D, with ja bj = 1, su h that a is in onsistent and b is not in onsistent.\nNow de ne the fun tion\n0\nas follows:\n0\n(x; y) =\n(x; y) if x 6= a (b; y) if x = a\nIt is straightforward to he k that\n0\nis submodular and (x; y) =\n0\n(x; y) +\n1 [a;a℄ (x; x).\nSin e (\n0\n) ( ), it now suÆ es to show that the result holds for\n0\n.\nBy repeating this pro edure we may assume that has no in onsistent values, and\nby symmetry, that the reversed fun tion\nT\n, de ned by\nT\n(x; y) = (y; x), also has no\nin onsistent values.\nWe will say that a value a 2 D is penalized if, for all y 2 D, (a; y) > 0. If a is penalized,\nthen we set\na\n= minf (a; y)jy 2 Dg. If\na\n=1, then a is in onsistent, so we may assume\nthat\na\n<1, and de ne a new fun tion\n0\nas follows:\n0\n(x; y) =\n(x; y) if x 6= a (x; y)\na\nif x = a:\nAgain it is straightforward to he k that\n0\nis submodular and (x; y) =\n0\n(x; y)+\na\n[a;a℄\n(x; x).\nSin e (\n0\n) ( ), it now suÆ es to show that the result holds for\n0\n.\nBy repeating this pro edure we may assume that neither nor\nT\nhas any in onsistent\nor penalized values.\nNow if, for all a; b 2 D, we have (a;M) = (M; b) = 0, then, by submodularity, for all a; b;2 D, (a; b) = (a; b) + (M;M) (a;M) + (M; b) = 0, so is identi ally 0, and the result holds trivially. Otherwise, by symmetry, we an hoose a to be the largest value in D su h that (a;M) 6= 0. Sin e a is not penalized, we an then hoose r to be the largest value in D su h that (a; r) = 0. By the hoi e of a, we know that r < M , and so we an de ne b = r + 1. This situation is illustrated in Figure 3.\nFor any x; y 2 D su h that x a and y b, we have:\n(x; y) = (x; y) + (a; r) ( (a; r) = 0)\n(x; r) + (a; y) (submodularity)\n= (x; r) + max( (a; y); (a; r)) ( (a; r) = 0)\n(x; r) + (a; b) (Lemma 4.4) (a; b)\nHen e we an now de ne a fun tion\n0\nas follows:\n0\n(x; y) =\n8 <\n:\n(x; y) if x > a _ y < b 0 if x = a ^ y = b\n(x; y) (a; b) otherwise.\nIt is straightforward to he k that (x; y) =\n0\n(x; y) +\n(a;b)\n[b;a℄\n(y; x).

    "abstractText" : "Many resear hers in arti ial intelligen e are beginning to explore the use of soft onstraints to express a set of (possibly on i ting) problem requirements. A soft onstraint is a fun tion de ned on a olle tion of variables whi h asso iates some measure of desirability with ea h possible ombination of values for those variables. However, the ru ial question of the omputational omplexity of nding the optimal solution to a olle tion of soft onstraints has so far re eived very little attention. In this paper we identify a lass of soft binary onstraints for whi h the problem of nding the optimal solution is tra table. In other words, we show that for any given set of su h onstraints, there exists a polynomial time algorithm to determine the assignment having the best overall ombined measure of desirability. This tra table lass in ludes many ommonly-o urring soft onstraints, su h as \\as near as possible\" or \\as soon as possible after\", as well as risp onstraints su h as \\greater than\". Finally, we show that this tra table lass is maximal, in the sense that adding any other form of soft binary onstraint whi h is not in the lass gives rise to a lass of problems whi h is NP-hard.",
