Samples may only be weakly atypical individually, whereas they may be strongly atypical when considered jointly. What makes this group anomaly detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify the subset of samples and subset of features that jointly specify an anomalous cluster. We apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect BotNet and peer-to-peer flow clusters. Unlike previous studies, our approach captures and exploits statistical dependencies that may exist between the measured features. Experiments on real world network traffic data demonstrate the advantage of our proposed system, and highlight the importance of exploiting feature dependency structure, compared to the feature (or test) independence assumption made in previous studies.\nIndex Terms\nBonferroni correction, group anomaly detection, Gaussian Mixture Model, p-value, network intru-\nsion detection, BotNet, dependence tree\nThis work supported in part by a Cisco Systems URP gift.\nNovember 4, 2015 DRAFT\n2 I. INTRODUCTION\nGroup anomaly detection has recently attracted much attention, with applications in astronomy [14], social media [15], disease/custom control [9][3] and network intrusion detection [11][5][4]. In this work, we focus on group anomaly detection applied to network intrusion detection, where the anomalous groups are either distributed Botnet (Zeus) or peer-to-peer (P2P) nodes generating traffic that deviates from the normal (Web traffic) behavior. Many existing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) only make sample-wise anomaly detections, e.g., in [12], the samples which deviate most from a normal (reference) model are flagged as anomalies/outliers. However, such an approach does not identify anomalous groups (e.g., a collection of BotNet flows), whose samples all exhibit similar behavior. Identifying such groups could be essential for mounting some form of system response or defense. Moreover, individual samples may only be weakly atypical. Thus, a sample-wise IDS may either fail to detect most of the anomalous samples, or may incur high false positives when a low detection threshold is used. By contrast, (weakly) anomalous samples whose anomalies are all “similar to each other” may be strongly atypical when considered in aggregate, i.e. jointly. For example, for an N = 100-dimensional feature space, suppose there is a sizeable collection of samples in the captured data batch that are all (even only weakly) atypical with respect to the same feature or the same (small) feature subset. There is a low probability that this occurs by chance, (i.e.,under the null). Thus, such clusters of anomalies, each defined by a sample subset and a feature subset, may be strongly atypical, and hence more convincing anomalies, than individual sample anomalies. It should be noted that there is an enormous number of candidate anomalous clusters, considering the conjoining of all possible sample subsets and all possible feature subsets. Thus, a GAD scheme will require some type of heuristic search over this huge space, aiming to detect the most statistically significant cluster candidates. In the sequel, we propose such a GAD scheme. Rather than assuming individual features or outlier events are statistically independent under the null as in [9], [5], in our approach, as in [10], we capture and exploit statistical dependencies amongst the features defining a candidate cluster. Compared to previous works, as shown in our experiments, the proposed scheme is more effective in detecting group anomalies.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II defines the problem and elaborates on related works. Section III describes the proposed model. Section IV evaluates the system performance,\nNovember 4, 2015 DRAFT\n3 and compares with some recent works. We then discuss some extensions of our system and future works in section V, followed by conclusions."

      "text" : "We assume there is a batch of normal web traffic available at the outset as training set, i.e. Xl = {x̃i, i = 1, ..., Tl, x̃i ∈ R D}, where x̃i is a D-dimensional feature vector representing the i-th training traffic flow1, and where we assume the number of training flows Tl is large enough to learn an accurate reference model (null hypothesis). These traffic flows can either be generated and captured in a sandbox environment, or sampled from a domain of interest (data warehouse, enterprise network) in real time under normal operating conditions. Given a model of normal network traffic learned based on Xl, our goal is to interrogate a capture batch of unknown traffic flows Xu = {xi, i = 1, ..., Tu, xi ∈ R D}2, seeking to identify latent groups of Botnet or P2P traffic, with the flows in each such group exhibiting similar behavior. This has been previously considered in [5], where the authors used the samples in Xl to estimate bivariate Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), on all feature pairs, representing the null hypothesis. These bivariate GMMs were used to evaluate mixture-based p-values3 for all pairs of features. Assuming the features (tests) are statistically independent, a joint significance score function was defined for a given candidate cluster, specified by its sample subset and feature subset, with a Bonferroni correction used to account for multiple testing. Instead of exhaustively searching over feature subset candidates at order K 4, the authors proposed to trial-add individual features only to the top-ranking candidate feature subsets (in terms of the Bonferroni corrected score) at order K − 1. Furthermore, the authors showed that the computational complexity of determining the optimal (in terms of the joint score) sample subset given the feature subset fixed is linear in Tu, once the samples in a given feature subset are ranked by their aggregate p-values. However, the independent test assumption used in [5] becomes grossly invalid as more and more features are included in a cluster, which limits the proposed model’s detection accuracy for increasing K. A related framework was also proposed in [9], albeit assuming categorical attributes. Here, the\n1A flow is a bidirectional communication sequence between a pair of nodes in a network. 2Unknown in the sense that we do not know which if any of these flows represent outliers or attacks. 3A p-value is the probability that an event is more extreme than the given observation. 4We use “order” to denote the maximum feature dimension considered.\nNovember 4, 2015 DRAFT\n4 authors built a single, global null hypothesis Bayesian network based on Xl. They then assigned categorical-based p-values to samples in Xu, with a cross entropy based scoring criterion used to efficiently search for the best feature and sample subset candidates. A limitation of this approach is that the statistical tests are again assumed to be independent.\nWe herein describe and experiment with a method of anomaly detection that extends [9], [5] and is closely related to [10]. The method captures dependencies between the features in a candidate cluster by a dependence tree structure, and uses this model to help evaluate joint p-values for cluster candidates. As in [5], the Bonferroni corrected score is used as the objective function for evaluating the best cluster candidates (defined by their sample and feature subsets). The candidate with the best such score is detected as a cluster of anomalies. Whereas in [9] a single global (null model) Bayesian network is used to assess candidate clusters, in [10] and in the current work a local, customized cluster-specific dependence tree model is used to assess each candidate cluster."

However, it does not allow comparing pairs of cluster candidates with any configurations of (Tc, Nc), because all possible feature subset configurations at a given order, Nc, have not yet been properly multiple-testing corrected. Also, (2) requires evaluation of the joint p-value P [ ∩ j∈Jc (I (j) i ) = 1]), ∀i ∈ Ic, which in general depends on the joint density function for (Xj1, Xj2, ..., XjNc ), jm ∈ Jc, m = 1, ..., Nc. When D is large, it is not practically feasible to learn and store these ( D\nNc\n)\njoint null density functions, i.e., for all\npossible combinations of features up to order Nc.

An obvious temptation is to assume that I (j) i and I (j′) i are statistically independent ∀j, j′ ∈ Jc, j′ 6= j. But this is a very poor assumption, consistent with assuming the features are independent.\nTo address the above problems, we seek to modify (2) in two respects. First, we propose to multiple test correct both for the different sample and the different feature subsets, given\nNovember 4, 2015 DRAFT\n7 a cluster candidate with (Tc, Nc). In this approach, instead of the exponent being the number of combinations, it becomes the product of combinations on samples and combinations on features. Based on the Bonferroni approximation of (2), we have the joint score function\nS(Ic, Jc) =\n(\nD Nc\n)(\nT Tc\n)\n∏\ni∈Ic P [ ∩ j∈Jc (I\n(j) i ) = 1]). For this joint significance measure, we can\nefficiently determine the optimal sample subset, given a fixed feature subset, by greedy sequential sample inclusion, in sorted joint p-value order. This is due to the unimodality of this Bonferroni approximated joint significance measure, as a function of the number of samples included in a cluster’s sample subset (see next subsection).\nSecond, a rich, tractable, joint probability mass function model that does capture statistical dependencies is a restricted form of Bayesian network, based exclusively on first and second order distributions, i.e., the dependence tree (DT), which factorizes the joint distribution P [ ∩ j∈Jc (I (j) i ) = 1]) as a product of first and second order probabilities [2]. In [2], it was shown that, even though there is an enormous number of unique dependence tree structures, one can efficiently find the globally optimal dependence tree, over all such structures, maximizing the dataset’s loglikelihood, by realizing that this can be recast as a maximum weight spanning tree problem, with the pairwise weights defined as the mutual information between the pairs of random variables. The maximum weight spanning tree can be efficiently solved via Kruskal’s algorithm, with complexity O(N2c log(Nc)). Hence, given any candidate feature subset Jc, Kruskal’s algorithm can be applied to determine the DT that maximizes the likelihood measured on Xl, i.e., the null hypothesis is determined, consistent with the given candidate feature subset Jc.\nBased on a given DT structure, P [ ∩ j∈Jc\n(I (j) i ) = 1]) factorizes as a product of first and second\norder distributions, i.e., ∀i ∈ Ic:\nP [ ∩ j∈Jc\n(I (j) i )] = P [I (j1) i ]P [I (j2) i |I (j1) i ]...P [I (jNc) i |I (jNc−1) i ], (3)\nwhere we use j1 to denote the root node of the DT representing Jc.\nIt is apparent from (3) that, for any feature subset, one can represent the joint p-value of a given sample by its first and second order mixture p-values. That is, for any feature pair (j, k), P [I (j) i |I (k) i ] = P [I (j) i ,I (k) i ]\nP [I (k) i ]\n. The numerator and denominator are, respectively, the second and first\norder mixture-based p-values that we defined earlier. Also note that, in order to evaluate the first order mixture p-value P [I(k)i ], we marginalize feature j from the bivariate GMM for the feature pair (j, k). This gives us the GMM for feature k.\nNovember 4, 2015 DRAFT\n8 C.

Specifically, a marginal-consistent collection of univariate and bivariate density functions should satisfy the following: if we consider any feature pairs (i, j) and (j, k), marginalizing out feature i from the (i, j) bivariate density and marginalizing out feature k from the (j, k) bivariate density should lead to the same marginal density for feature j. However, when the univariate and bivariate distributions are Gaussian mixtures, with a non-convex log-likelihood function (and with BIC-based model order selection separately applied to choose the number of components for each GMM), separate application of EM-plus-BIC to learn each GMM density function does not ensure a set of marginal-consistent distributions. This property is not centrally important here, however, since our main concern is only to learn marginal and pairwise density functions that allow accurate assessment of p-values. Accordingly, in this work we will apply EM-plus-BIC separately, to learn each low-order GMM.\nOne approach to obtain marginal-consistent low-order distributions is to simply learn the single GMM for the joint distribution on the full feature vector, X . This determines (via marginalization) all lower-order distributions (which are also GMMs, and which are guaranteed to be marginal-consistent). However, this strategy suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Alternatively, we refer the interested reader to [10], where a procedure for directly, jointly learning a marginal-consistent set of low-order GMMs is elaborated.\nNovember 4, 2015 DRAFT\n9 modestly sized (D). We start by sweeping over feature subset candidates at low orders and, for tractability, only the “most promising” candidates at higher orders, with candidate feature subsets at order K formed by “accreting” new features to the best-scoring candidates at order K − 1. For each candidate feature subset Jc, its DT is first learned and its associated, optimal subset Ic is then determined using the method described in section III.C. Evaluating all candidates at all feature subset orders, the one with the best score function value at each order Nc is recorded. The cluster with smallest Bonferroni-corrected score S(Ic, Jc) is then forwarded as detected. Its samples are then removed from the test batch. Subsequent cluster detections can then be made following the same procedure. Cluster detections are thus made (in general) in order of decreasing joint significance."

In the case of P2P, nodes often communicate in a bidirectional manner, exchanging relatively large packets in both directions. Normal/background Web traffic, on the other hand, tends to involve server-to-client communications.\nHence, we seek to preserve the bidirectional packet size sequence information as feature representation for different traffic flows. This feature representation was previously considered in [5], [11]. The authors used the first N (we set N = 10 in our experiments) packets after the threeway hand shake of each TCP flow. Then a feature vector of dimension 2N is defined, specified by the sizes and directionalities of these N packets. Traffic are assumed to be alternating between client-to-server (CS) and server-to-client (SC). A zero packet size is thus inserted between two consecutive packets in the same direction to indicate an absence of a packet in the other direction. For example, if the bidirectional traffic is strictly SC, a zero will be inserted after each SC packet size. This 2N-dimensional feature representation preserves bidirectional information of a given TCP flow, which is essential for discriminating between P2P, Zeus and normal Web traffic."

These samples will be sequentially removed from the test batch, with the system then continuing to extract groups until the test set is depleted. Then we sweep out an ROC curve based on these rank-ordered detected samples. A larger area under the ROC curve indicates earlier detections of anomalous groups, which implies the effectiveness of the intrusion detection system. We compare our system’s performance with a GMM based anomaly detector, trained by normal samples, on the whole feature space. For this detector, we rank the test samples based on their data likelihood under the GMM, and sweep out an ROC curve. We also compare with the approach presented in [5], which assumes significance tests are independent (denoted “Independence tests”), and with the recent work presented in [9] with a slight modification – instead of discretizing feature values consistent with [9], we use a single dependence tree null distribution learned on Xl and our proposed joint p-value for continuous features, P [ ∩ j∈Jc (I (j) i ) = 1]. We denote this variation on the approach in [9] by “single Bayesian Net.” There are two generalization performance measures of interest on the test set: one is the aforementioned ROC area under curve (ROC AUC) as a function of the maximum feature subset size for a cluster, Kmax.

Lastly, instead of exhaustively searching over all feature subsets at order K, we trialadd individual features to the top candidate feature subsets from order K − 1. At each order K, starting from order 2, we only consider the top 500 candidates from order K − 1.\nTwo different sets of experiments were performed, one on synthetic data, and the other on the network data mentioned earlier. In the synthetic dataset experiment, we used one unimodal Gaussian with 10 dimensions to generate normal samples and two additional unimodal Gaussians to generate two distinct anomalous clusters. The two anomalous clusters use the same distribution as the normal distribution for nine of the ten features. Thus, they deviate from the normal (null) distribution only on a single feature dimension (this “informative” feature dimension was different for the two clusters). Their corresponding sample subsets consist of 2.5% of the whole data batch Xu (so the proportion of anomalous samples in Xu is 5% of the total). The variance of the informative features was chosen to be the same as that of the normal features, σ2n. Moreover the mean of the informative feature under an anomalous cluster was chosen to be two standard deviations away from the mean under the normal class, i.e. |µn − µa| = 2σn, where we use subscripts n and a to denote ‘normal’ and ‘anomalous’, respectively. Thus, if we consider only the informative feature dimension, the Bayes error rate in discriminating normal from anomalous is 15.87%. After generating the synthetic data batch (with a size of ten thousand samples), we randomly chose 20% of normal samples as ground-truth and used them to train the null hypothesis. The remaining normal samples were used as part of the test batch, along with the samples from the two anomalous clusters. This was repeated 10 times, with the performance averaged.\nFor the network data, all the normal web flows from the three files were combined, making nearly ten thousand normal web flows. We randomly selected 20% of these flows as groundtruth normal samples to train the null, and treated the remaining normal flows as part of the test batch, combined with either P2P or Zeus anomalous flows. We separately experimented with P2P and Zeus flows. There were roughly 5 % of either P2P or Zeus flows in a given test batch.

The first captured cluster (sample subset) consists of more than 95% anomalous samples on average. However, as the maximum feature subset order increases, the “independence tests” approach drops significantly in performance. This is because too many (assumed to be independent) pairwise tests create many redundant features that are all used to evaluate cluster anomalousness; use of these redundant features de-emphasizes, within the score function, the important (low-order) feature subset. Also, we see an early advantage of using cluster-specific DTs, compared to the single Bayesian Net approach. It appears that if an anomalous process is strictly generated from a low order subspace and normal in other feature dimensions (as is the case in this experiment) our cluster-specific DT approach outperforms a single Bayesian Net approach.\nIn Figure 3 a), we show the performance for normal-P2P discrimination.

Samples may only be weakly atypical individually, whereas they may be strongly atypical when considered jointly. What makes this group anomaly detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify the subset of samples and subset of features that jointly specify an anomalous cluster. We apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect BotNet and peer-to-peer flow clusters. Unlike previous studies, our approach captures and exploits statistical dependencies that may exist between the measured features. Experiments on real world network traffic data demonstrate the advantage of our proposed system, and highlight the importance of exploiting feature dependency structure, compared to the feature (or test) independence assumption made in previous studies.",
