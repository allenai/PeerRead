South America presents a prominent context with mixed culture and social predisposition. In 2012, civil, academic and governmental parties started elaborating the \"Common Vocabulary of Social Participation\" (\\vcps\\ from the Brazilian name \\emph{Vocabul\\'ario Comum de Participa\\c{c}\\~ao Social}), as a public and online process. By May, 2013, first reference documents were publicized, together with a preliminary \\owl\\ code, logos, and a diagram of a general \"public consultation\". The \\corais\\ platform kept online records of the process, like discussions and preparation of texts. This article exposes this material and proposes an elementary unfolding: the \"Social Participation Ontology\" (\\ops\\ from the Brazilian name \\emph{Ontologia de Participa\\c{c}\\~ao Social}). To exhibit this new ontology, these steps were considered: correction of ontological contradictions and \\owl\\ protocol use errors; completion of \\vcps\\ \\owl\\ code into a preliminary version of the \\ops; translations and standardizations; enhancements of class names and labels in Portuguese, Spanish and English; a toy expansion of the ontology by further specifying classes; linked data examples regarding dereferencing, a \\sparql\\ endpoint and participatory instances; use cases by researchers and public managers. Ongoing work involves further adoption of \\ops\\ by the official Brazilian federal portal of social participation, further adoption by civil participative organizations, and linkage to other participative ontologies. \\ops\\ is being used as an upper ontology, and all classes linked further to \\foaf\\ and \\bfo\\ as higher upper ontologies.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 14:33:23 GMT  (954kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02662v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 03:10:57 GMT  (954kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02662v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 30 Oct 2017 18:28:50 GMT  (1029kb,AD)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02662v3", "See ancillary for table of terms, OPS code and figures.
