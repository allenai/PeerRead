      "text" : "Deep neural networks have shown great success in several application domains with a large amount of labeled data available. However, the availability of such large data from which training signals can be extracted have been prerequisite. Furthermore the standard deep neural networks lack an ability to incrementally learn new concepts on the fly, without forgetting the old knowledge.\nIn contrast, humans can rapidly learn and generalize from one or two examples of the same concept. Humans are also very good at incremental (i.e. continual) learning. These abilities are mostly explained by the meta learning (i.e. learning to learn) process in the brain (Harlow, 1949).\nPrevious work on meta learning has formulated the problem as a two-level learning, a slow learning of a meta-level model performing across tasks and a rapid learning of a base-level model acting within each task (Mitchell et al., 1993; Vilalta & Drissi, 2002). The goal of the meta-level learner is to acquire generic knowledge of different tasks. The knowledge can then be transferred to the base-level\n1University of Massachusetts, MA, USA.

The base and the meta-level models can be framed in a single learner (Schmidhuber, 1993) or in separate learners (Bengio et al., 1990; Hochreiter et al., 2001).\nIn this work we introduce a meta learning model called MetaNet (for Meta Networks) that supports meta-level continual learning by allowing neural networks to learn and to generalize new task or new concept from a single example on the fly. The overall architecture of MetaNet is shown in Figure 1. MetaNet consists of two main learning components, a base learner and a meta learner, and is equipped with an external memory. Learning occurs at two levels in separate spaces (i.e. meta space and task space). The base learner performs in the input task space whereas the meta learner operates in a task-agnostic meta space. By operating in the abstract meta space, the meta learner supports continual learning and performs meta knowledge acquisition across different tasks. To this end, the base learner first analyzes the input task. It then provides the meta learner with a meta-level information that explains the base learner’s status in the current task space. Based on the meta information, the meta learner rapidly parameterizes both itself and the base learner so that the MetaNet model can recognize the new concepts of the input task. Specifically the training weights of MetaNet evolves at different timescales: standard slow weights updated through a learning algorithm (i.e. backpropagation), task-level fast weights ar X iv :1 70 3.\n00 83\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nM ar\n2 01\n7\nupdated within the scope of each task, and example-level fast weights updated for a specific input example. Finally MetaNet equipped with the external memory allows for such rapid learning and generalization.\nUnder the MetaNet framework, it is important to define types of the meta information which can be derived from the base learner. While other types of the meta information are also applicable, here we used the gradient of the base learner as meta information for an end-to-end training of MetaNet via backpropagation. We extensively studied its performance and characteristics on one-shot learning problems, under varying settings. Our proposed method not only improves the state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also shows some interesting properties relating to generalization and continual learning."

      "text" : "Our work connects different threads of research in order to allow neural networks for rapid learning and generalization. The rapid learning and generalization refers to a one-shot learning scenario where a learner is introduced to a sequence of tasks, each with a single or few labeled examples of many classes. A key challenge in this setting is that the classes or concepts vary across the tasks. Due to this, one-shot learning problems have been widely addressed by generative models and metric learning methods. One notable success is reported by a probabilistic programming approach (Lake et al., 2015). They used specific knowledge of how pen strokes are composed to produce characters of different alphabets. Koch (2015) applied Siamese Networks to perform one-shot classification. Recently, Vinyals et al. (2016) unified the training and testing of a one-shot learner under the same procedure and developed an end-to-end differentiable nearest neighbor method for one-shot learning. Santoro et al. (2016) proposed a memory-based approach and trained Neural Turing Machines (Graves et al., 2014) for one-shot learning, although the meta-learner and the one-shot learner in this work are not separable explicitly. Their training procedure adapted the work of Hochreiter et al. (2001) in which they used LSTMs as the meta-level model. More recently an LSTMbased one-shot optimizer was proposed (Ravi & Larochell, 2017). By taking in the loss, the gradient and the parameters of the base learner, the meta optimizer was trained to update the parameters for one-shot classification.\nThere is a line of work on building meta optimizers (Hochreiter et al., 2001; Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Li & Malik, 2017). As the main interest here is to train an optimization algorithm within the meta learning framework, the previous research have mainly focused on tasks with large datasets. In contrast, with the absent of large datasets, we emphasize the difficulties to optimize a neural network\nwith a large number of parameters to generalize with limited examples of new concept. Our work instead proposes a novel rapid parameterization approach by employing the meta information. By following the success of the previous work (Mitchell et al., 1993; Younger et al., 1999; Andrychowicz et al., 2016; Ravi & Larochell, 2017), we studied the meta information in the form of the loss gradient of neural nets. The ideas of fast weights and generating parameters for one neural network with another have been explored individually in separate contexts. Hinton & Plaut (1987) suggested the usage of fast weights for rapid learning. Ba et al. (2016) recently used fast weights to replace soft attention mechanism. Fast weights have also been used to implement recurrent nets (Schmidhuber, 1992). Those usages of fast weights are well motivated by the fact that synapses have dynamics at many different time-scales.\nThe approach proposed by Gomez & Schmidhuber (2005) is more closely related to our work. They used recurrent nets to generate fast weights for a single-layer network controller. De Brabandere et al. (2016) used one network to generate slow filter weights for a convolutional neural net whereas more recently David Ha & Le (2017) generated slow weights for recurrent nets. Our MetaNet generates fast weights at two time-scales by operating in meta space. To integrate the fast weights with the slow weights, we propose a novel layer augmentation approach.\nFinally, we note that our MetaNet equipped with an external memory can be seen as a memory augmented neural network (MANN). MANNs have shown promising results on a range of tasks starting from small programming problems (Graves et al., 2014) to large-scale language tasks (Weston et al., 2015; Munkhdalai & Yu, 2017)."

      "text" : "The base learner denoted as b is a function or a neural net that maps an input example x (i.e. image) to an output y (i.e. label). However, unlike standard neural net b is parameterized by slow weightsW and example-level fast weights W ∗. The slow weights are updated via a learning algorithm\nduring training whereas the fast weights are generated for every input.\nBy using some sort of meta information the base learner should be able to explain its setting in the current task space in order for the meta learner to generate the fast weights. We obtain such meta information in the form of the gradient by first performing a forward pass and then backpropagating as follows:\nLi = lossb(b(W,xi), yi) (1)\n∇i = ∇WLi (2)\nwhere Li is the loss for input and label pair {xi, yi}Ni=1. N is the number of support examples in the task set which usually contains a single instance per class in one-shot setup. ∇i is the loss gradient with respect to parameters W and is our meta information. Note that the loss function lossb is generic and for one-shot classification we use cross-entropy loss. Now the meta learner takes in the gradient information and generates the fast parameters W ∗. We will describe this later.\nAssuming that the fast weights W ∗j for input xj is defined, the base learner performs the one-shot classification as:\nP (yj |xj ,W,W ∗j ) = b(W,W ∗j , xj) (3)\nwhere {xj}Lj=1 is an example drawn from the current task set. To train MetaNet, we use another L number of labeled examples other than the support set and minimize the crossentropy loss."

      "text" : "The meta learner processes the meta information along with the task support set and generates the fast weights.\nParticularly it transforms the loss gradient {∇i}Ni=1 to a set of fast weights {W ∗i }Ni=1:\nW ∗i = m(Z,∇i) (4)\nwhere m is a neural network with parameter Z. The fast weights are then stored in a memory M = {W ∗i }Ni=1. The memory M is indexed with task dependent representations R = {ri}Ni=1 of the support set {xi}Ni=1, obtained by a dynamic key embedding function u. The embedding function u is a neural net parameterized by slow weights Q and task-level fast weights Q∗:\nri = u(Q,Q ∗, xi) (5)\nwhere the parameters Q and Q∗ are integrated using the layer augmentation method. Note that the fast weights Q∗ are generated per task basis to perform a task-specific embedding of input. Therefore Q∗ is defined as:\nLt = lossu(u(Q, xt), yt) (6)\n∇t = ∇QLt (7)\nQ∗ = mLSTM (G,∇t) (8)\nwhere mLSTM is LSTM and G is the LSTM parameters. First, we sample T examples (possibly T = N ) {xt, yt}Tt=1 from the support set and obtain the loss gradient as meta information. Then LSTM observes the gradient corresponding to each sampled example and summarizes into the task specific parameter. Thus the order of LSTM input does not matter and alternatively we can take summation or average of the gradients and use a MLP. However, in our preliminary experiment we observed that the latter results in a poor convergence. In a similar way defined in the Equation 6-8, we can also parameterize the base learner with task-level fast weights. We will report an ablation experiment on different variation of MetaNet in Section 4.\nThe loss, lossu does not need to align with the base learner’s loss, but it should be able to capture a good representation learning objective. We use cross-entropy loss when the support set has only a single example per class. However, when there are more than one examples per class available, contrastive loss (Chopra et al., 2005) is a natural choice for lossu since both positive and negative samples can be formed. In this case, we randomly draw T number of pairs to observe the gradients and the loss is\nLt = lossu(u(Q, x1,t), u(Q, x2,t), lt) (9)\nwhere\nlt = { 1, if y1,t = y2,t 0, otherwise\n(10)\nOnce the parameters are stored in the memory M and the memory index R is constructed, the meta learner parameterizes the base learner with the fast weights Wj∗. First it embeds the input xj in the task space:\nrj = u(Q,Q ∗, xj) (11)\nand then reads the memory with soft attention:\naj = attention(R, rj) (12)\nWj∗ = softmax(aj)>M (13)\nwhere attention calculates similarity between the memory index and the input embedding and we use cosine similarity as attention.\nThe meta learner fully parameterize its embedding function and the base learner and thus the shape of Wj∗ and Qj∗ are same as Wj and Q. The embedding function u can be seen as a dynamic embedding network that changes its parameters within the scope of the current input task. The training parameters of MetaNet θ consists of the slow weights W and Q and the meta weights Z and G (i.e. θ = {W,Q,Z,G}) and jointly updated via a training algorithm such as backpropagation to minimize the crossentropy loss (Equation 3). Note that lossb and lossu in Equations 1 and 6 are calculated to obtain the gradient by using the support set during both training and testing for the rapid parameterization and these losses are not used for θ parameter updates."

      "text" : "A slow weight layer in the base learner is extended with its corresponding fast weights for rapid generalization. An example of the layer augmentation approach applied to a MLP with single hidden layer is shown in Figure 2. Input to each layer is first transformed by both slow and fast weights and then it is passed through a non-linearity (i.e. ReLU ) resulting in two separate activation vectors. Finally the activation vectors are aggregated by an element-wise vector addition. For the last softmax layer, we first aggregate two transformed inputs and then normalize for classification output.\nOverall the layer augmentation building block is similar to that of ResNet architecture (He et al., 2016). However, ResNet has an identity transformation of a preceding activation (i.e. shortcut connection) and a non-linearity after the element-wise additive aggregation while our layer augmented net has a fast weight mapping which captures the input task prior and a non-linearity before the aggregation. Intuitively, the fast and slow weights in the layer augmented neural net can be seen as feature detectors operating in two distinct numeric domains. The application of the non-linearity maps them into the same domain, which\nis [0,∞) in the case of ReLU so that the activations can be aggregated and processed further. Our aggregation function here is element-wise sum."

It also comes with a standard split of 30 training and 20 evaluation alphabets. Following (Santoro et al., 2016), we augmented the data set through 90, 180 and 270 degrees rotations.

First we split the Omniglot data into training and test sets consisting of two disjoint classes. We then formulate a series of tasks from the training set. Each task has a support set of N images and N different classes, resulting an N-way one-shot classification problem. In addition to the support set, we also include L number of labeled examples in each task set to update the parameters θ during training. For testing, we follow the same procedure to form a set of test tasks from the disjoint classes. However, now MetaNet assigns class labels toL examples based only on the labeled support set of each test task.\nFor the one-shot benchmarks reported in the following sections, we used a CNN as base learner b. This CNN has 5 convolutional layers, each of which is a 3 x 3 convolution with 64 filters, followed by a ReLU non-linearity and a 2 x 2 max-pooling and additional two layers of a fully connected (FC) layer and a softmax layer. Another CNN with the same architecture is used define the dynamic embedding function u and we take the output of the FC layer as the task dependent representation r. For the networks mLSTM and m, we used a single-layer LSTM with 20 hidden units and a three-layer MLP with 20 hidden units and ReLU non-linearity. As in Andrychowicz et al.

The first group of methods are the previously published models. The next group is MetaNet variations. MetaNet is the main architecture described in Section 3. MetaNet- is a variant without task-level fast weights Q∗ in the embedding function u whereas MetaNet+ has additional task-level weights for the base learner in addition to W ∗. Our MetaNet model improves the previous best results by 0.5% to 2% accuracy. As the number of classes increases (moving from 5-way\nto 20-way classification), overall the performance of the one-shot learners decreases. MetaNet’s performance drop is relatively small and it is around 2% while the drop for the other models ranges from 3% to 15%. As a result, our model shows an absolute improvement of 2% on 20-way one-shot task.\nComparing different MetaNet variations, the additional task-level weights in the base learner did not seem to help and even this model (MetaNet+) has shown a decreasing result. MetaNet- however performed surprisingly well but still falls behind the MetaNet model as it lacks the dynamic embedding function.

To handle this, we inserted a softmax layer into the base learner during evaluation and then augmented it with the fast weights generated by the meta learner. If the meta learner is generic enough, it should be able to parameterize the new softmax layer on the fly. The new layer weights remained fixed since no parameter update was performed for this layer. The K-way test tasks were formed from the 423 unseen classes in the test set.\nThe MetaNet models were trained on one of 5, 10, 15 and 20-way one-shot tasks and evaluated on the rest.

The MetaNet model trained on 5-way tasks obtained 93.07% of 20-way test accuracy which is still a closer match to Matching Network and higher than Siamese Net trained 20-way tasks. An interesting finding is that when N is smaller than K, i.e. the model is trained on easier tasks than test ones, we observe a decreasing performance. Conversely the models skilled on harder tasks (i.e. N > K) achieved increasing performances when tested on the easier tasks and the performance is even higher than the ones that were applied to the tasks with the same level difficulty (i.e. N = K). For example, the model skilled on 20-way classification improved the 5-way one-shot baseline by 0.6% showing a ceiling performance in this setting. We also conducted a preliminary experiment on more extreme test-time classification. MetaNet trained on 10-way task achieved around 65% on 100-way one-shot classification task.\nThis flexibly in MetaNet is crucial because one-shot learning usually involves an online concept identification scenario. By looking at the results, we can empirically obtain a performance lower or upper bound. Particularly the test performance obtained on the tasks with the same level difficulty that the model was skilled on can be used as a performance lower or an upper bound depending on a scenario under which the model will be deployed in the future. For\nexample, for the MetaNet model that will deployed under the N > K scenario, we can obtain the performance lower bound by testing it on the N = K tasks."

A decreasing performance indicates that the meta weights Z and G of the neural nets m and mLSTM are prone to catastrophic forgetting and MetaNet therefore does not support the continual learning. An increasing performance means MetaNet supporting a reverse transfer learning and the continual learning.\nWe allocated separate parameters for the weights W and Q when we switched the problems so the only meta weights were updated. We used two three-layer MLPs with 64 hidden units as the embedding function and the base learner. The MNIST image and classes were augmented by randomly permuting the pixels. We created 50 different random shuffles and thus the training set for the second oneshot problem consisted of 500 classes. We conducted multiple runs and increased the MNIST training trials by multiples of 400 (i.e. 400, 800, 1200...) in each run giving more time to MetaNet to adapt its meta weights on the second problem so MetaNet may forget the knowledge about Omniglot. Each run was repeated five times and we reported the average statistics. For every run, the network and the optimizer were reinitialized and the training started from scratch.\nIn Figure 5, we plotted the accuracy difference between two Omniglot test performances obtained before and after training on the MNIST task. The performance improvement (y-axis) after skilled on the MNIST tasks ranges from -1.7% to 1.24% depending on the training time (x-axis).

At the same time, it skilled on MNIST one-shot classification. The MNIST training accu-\nracy already reached over 72% after seeing 2400 MNIST trials.

      "heading" : "5. Discussion and Future Work",
      "text" : "One-shot learning in combination with meta learning framework can be a useful approach to address certain neural network drawbacks relating to the rapid generalization with small data and the continual learning. We present a novel meta learning model, Meta Networks (MetaNet), that performs a generic knowledge acquisition in a meta space and shifts the parameters and the inductive bias via fast parameterization for the rapid generalization.\nUnder the MetaNet framework, an important consideration is the type of meta information that can be extracted from the model operating on a new task. We require that the meta information should be generic and problem independent. It should also be expressive enough to explain the model setting in the current task space. We explored the loss gradient in this work. As shown in the results, using the gradient as meta information seems to be a promising direction. We evaluated the MetaNet model on the image one-shot classification problems. MetaNet obtained the-state-of-the art results on several benchmarks and has shown to be very flexible in the online setups. It supported continual learning up to a certain point. It must be interesting to challenge a similar setup on two very different tasks, such as image classification versus text classification. We leave this for the future evaluation. It might of a long term interest to come up with a new type of meta information that is more robust and expressive. One could take inspiration from the meta learning process in the brain and ask whether the brain operates on some kind of meta information to generalize across tasks and acquire new skills.\nThe rapid parameterization approach presented here has been shown to be a good alternative to the direct optimization methods that learn to update network parameters for one-shot generalization. However, a problem this approach poses is the integration of slow and fast weights. As a solution to this, we presented a simple layer augmentation method. Although the layer augmentation worked reasonably well, this method is questionable when a neural net has many types of parameters operating in multiple different time-scales. An example of this is that the base learner equipped with three types of weights (slow, example-specific, and task-level weights) integrated under\nthe layer augmentation paradigm could not perform as well as a simpler one. Therefore, a potential extension would be to train MetaNet so it can discover its own augmentation schema for efficiency.\nIn this work, we applied the fast parameterization approach to CNNs and MLPs. The fast parameterization of sequential models such as RNNs have yet to be explored and this would have many useful applications of sequence modeling and language-based conversational tasks.\nIt was observed that neural nets with the fixed slow weight can perform well for new task inputs when augmented with the fast weights. When the slow weights are updated during training, it encodes the domain bias resulting in even better performance. However, one could expect a higher performance from the fixed weight network when aiming for one-shot generalization across very distinct domains.\nFinally, important components of MetaNet are the dynamic key embedding function and the external memory. Indeed, similar modules can also be found in the previous models such as Matching Net and memory based Siamese Net. The differences are that MetaNet learns to parameterize this embedding network as a response to the new task inputs yielding a dynamic attention and the MetaNet memory temporary stores neural net weights generated."

However, there are major drawbacks of the neural networks that are related to rapid generalization with small data and continual learning of new concepts without forgetting. We present a novel meta learning method, Meta Networks (MetaNet), that acquires a meta-level knowledge across tasks and shifts its inductive bias via fast parameterization for the rapid generalization. When tested on the standard oneshot learning benchmarks, our MetaNet models achieved near human-level accuracy. We demonstrated several appealing properties of MetaNet relating to generalization and continual learning.",
