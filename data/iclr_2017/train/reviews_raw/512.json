{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Nonparametrically Learning Activation Functions in Deep Neural Nets", "abstract": "We provide a principled framework for nonparametrically learning activation functions in deep neural networks. Currently, state-of-the-art deep networks treat choice of activation function as a hyper-parameter before training. By allowing activation functions to be estimated as part of the training procedure, we expand the class of functions that each node in the network can learn. We also provide a theoretical justification for our choice of nonparametric activation functions and demonstrate that networks with our nonparametric activation functions generalize well. To demonstrate the power of our novel techniques, we test them on image recognition datasets and achieve up to a 15% relative increase in test performance compared to the baseline.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper describes an approach to learning the non-linear activation function in deep neural nets.

The paper suggests two stage optimization to learn the weights of the network, and the non linearity weights.\n\nsignificance:\n\nThe paper introduces a nice idea, and present nice experimental results. however  I find the theoretical analysis not very informative, and  distractive from the main central idea of the paper. \n \nA more thorough experimentation with the idea using different basis and comparing it to wider networks (equivalent to the number of cosine basis used in the leaned one ) would help more supporting results in the paper. \n\n\nComments: \n\n- Are the weights of the non -linearity learned shared across all units in all layers ? or each unit has it is own non linearity?\n\n- If all weights are tied across units and layers. One question that would be interesting to study , if there is an optimal non linearity. \n\n- How different is the non linearity learned if the hidden units are normalized or un-normalized.  In other words how does the non linearity change if you use or don't use batch normalization? \n\n- Does normalization affect  the conclusion that polynomial basis fail? \n\n\n\n\n\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "15 Dec 2016 (modified: 16 Dec 2016)", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "No Title", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper describes an approach to learning the non-linear activation function in deep neural nets.
