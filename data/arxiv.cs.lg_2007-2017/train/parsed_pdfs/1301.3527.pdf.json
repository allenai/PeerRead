In particular, we are interested in matrix factorizations which impose the following requirements:\n• nonnegativity • low-rankedness • sparsity\nNonnegativity is a natural constraint when modeling data with physical constraints such as chemical concentrations in solutions, pixel intensities in images and radiation dosages for cancer treatment. Low-rankedness is useful for learning a lower dimensionality representation. Sparsity is useful for modeling the conciseness of the representation or that of the\nar X\niv :1\n30 1.\n35 27\nv1 [\ncs .L\nlatent features. Imposing all these requirements on our matrix factorization leads to the sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) problem.\nSNMF enjoys quite a few formulations [10, 9, 7, 20, 13, 22, 23] with successful applications to single-channel speech separation [24] and micro-array data analysis [13, 22].\nHowever, algorithms [10, 7] for solving SNMF which utilize the mixed norm of L1/L2 as their sparsity measure are slow and do not scale well to large datasets. Thus, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem and has the following ingredients:\n• An exact projection operator to enforce the user-defined sparsity as opposed to the previous heuristic approach [10]. • Novel sequential updates which provide the bulk of our speedup compared to the previously employed batch methods [10, 7]."

      "text" : "In this section, we give an introduction to the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and SNMF problems. Also, we discuss some widely used algorithms from the literature to solve them.\nBoth these problems share the following problem and solution structure. At a high-level, given a nonnegative matrix X of size m × n, we want to approximate it with a product of two nonnegative matrices W,H of sizes m× r and r × n, respectively:\nX ≈WH.(1)\nThe nonnegative constraint on matrix H makes the representation a convex combination of features given by the columns of matrix W. In particular, NMF can result in sparse representations, or a parts-based representation, unlike other factorization techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and vector quantization (VQ). A common theme in the algorithms proposed for solving these problems is the use of alternating updates to the matrix factors, which is natural because the objective function to be minimized is convex in W and in H, separately, but not in both together. Much effort has been focused on optimizing the efficiency of the core step of updating one of W,H while the other stays fixed."

      "text" : "Factoring a matrix, all of whose entries are nonnegative, as a product of two low-rank nonnegative factors is a fundamental algorithmic challenge. This has arisen naturally in diverse areas such as image analysis [16], micro-array data analysis [13], document clustering [25], chemometrics [15], information retrieval [8] and biology applications [2]. For further applications, see the references in the following papers [1, 4].\nWe will consider the following version of the NMF problem, which measures the reconstruction error using the Frobenius norm [17]:\nmin W,H\n1\n2 ‖X−WH‖2F s.t. W ≥ 0, H ≥ 0, ‖Wj‖2 = 1, ∀j ∈ {1, · · · , r}(2)\nwhere ≥ is element-wise. We use subscript to denote column elements. Simple multiplicative updates were proposed by Lee and Seung to solve the NMF problem. This is attractive for the following reasons:\n• Unlike additive gradient descent methods, there is no arbitrary learning rate parameter that needs to be set.\n• The nonnegativity constraint is satisfied automatically, without any additional projection step.\n• The objective function converges to a limit point and the values are non-increasing across the updates, as shown by Lee and Seung [17].\nAlgorithm 1 is an example of the kind of multiplicative update procedure used, for instance, by Lee and Seung [17]. The algorithm alternates between updating the matrices W and H (we have only shown the updates for H—those for W are analogous).\nAlgorithm 1 nnls-mult(X,W,H)\nrepeat\nH = H W >X\nW>WH .\nuntil convergence Output: Matrix H.\nHere, indicates element-wise (Hadamard) product and matrix division is also elementwise. To remove the scaling ambiguity, the norm of columns of matrix W are set to unity. Also, a small constant, say 10−9, is added to the denominator in the updates to avoid division by zero.\nBesides multiplicative updates, other algorithms have been proposed to solve the NMF problem based on projected gradient [18], block pivoting [14], sequential constrained optimization [3] and greedy coordinate-descent [11]."

      "text" : "The nonnegative decomposition is in general not unique [6]. Furthermore, the features may not be parts-based if the data resides well inside the positive orthant. To address these issues, sparseness constraints have been imposed on the NMF problem.\nSparse NMF can be formulated in many different ways. From a user point of view, we can split them into two classes of formulations: explicit and implicit. In explicit versions of SNMF [10, 7], one can set the sparsities of the matrix factors W ,H directly. On the other hand, in implicit versions of SNMF [13, 22], the sparsity is controlled via a regularization parameter and is often hard to tune to specified sparsity values a priori. However, the algorithms for implicit versions tend to be faster compared to the explicit versions of SNMF.\nIn this paper, we consider the explicit sparse NMF formulation proposed by Hoyer [10]. To make the presentation easier to follow, we first consider the case where the sparsity is imposed on one of the matrix factors, namely the feature matrix W—the analysis for the symmetric case where the sparsity is instead set on the other matrix factor H is analogous. The case where sparsity requirements are imposed on both the matrix factors is dealt with in the Appendix. The sparse NMF problem formulated by Hoyer [10] with sparsity on matrix W is as follows:\nmin W,H\nf(W ,H) = 1\n2 ‖X−WH‖2F s.t. W ≥ 0,H ≥ 0,\n‖Wj‖2 = 1, sp(Wj) = α, ∀j ∈ {1, · · · , r}(3) Sparsity measure for a d-dimensional vector x is given by:\nsp(x) = √ d− ‖x‖1/‖x‖2√\nd− 1 (4)\nThe sparsity measure (4) defined above has many appealing qualities. Some of which are as follows:\n• The measure closely models the intuitive notion of sparsity as captured by the L0 norm. So, it easy for the user to specify sparsity constraints from prior knowledge of the application domain.\n• Simultaneously, it is able to avoid the pitfalls associated with directly optimizing the L0 norm. Desirable properties for sparsity measures have been previously explored [12] and it satisfies all of these properties for our problem formulation.\n• The above sparsity measure enables one to limit the sparsity for each feature to lie in a given range by changing the equality constraints in the SNMF formulation (3)\nto inequality constraints. This could be useful in scenarios like fMRI brain analysis, where we have prior knowledge on the sizes of brain regions. Our proposed algorithm can handle this formulation but we will not explore it further in this version.\nA gradient descent-based algorithm called Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Sparseness Constraints (NMFSC) to solve SNMF was proposed [10]. Multiplicative updates were used for optimizing the matrix factor which did not have sparsity constraints specified. Heiler and Schnörr[7] proposed two new algorithms which also solved this problem by sequential cone programming and utilized general purpose solvers like MOSEK (http://www.mosek.com). We will consider the faster one of these called tangent-plane constraint (TPC) algorithm. However, both these algorithms, namely NMFSC and TPC, solve for the whole matrix of coefficients at once. In contrast, we propose a block coordinatedescent strategy which considers a sequence of vector problems where each one can be solved in closed form efficiently."

Second, we describe our sequential approach (Algorithm 3) to solve the subproblem of SNMF. This uses the routine we developed in the previous step.

This problem has been previously considered [10], and a heuristic to solve it was proposed which we will henceforth refer to as the Projection-heuristic. Observation 1. For any i, j, we have that if bi ≥ bj, then yi ≥ yj.\nLet us first consider the case when the vector b is sorted. Then by the previous observation, we have a transition point p that separates the zeros of the solution vector from the rest.\nObservation 2. By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on y and the all ones vector, we get p ≥ k2.\nThe Lagrangian of the problem (5) is :\nL(y, µ, λ) = b>y + µ ( m∑ i=1 yi − k ) + λ 2 ( m∑ i=1 y2i − 1 ) Setting the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian to zero, we get by observation 1:\nm∑ i yi = k, m∑ i y2i = 1\nbi + µ(p) + λ(p)yi = 0,∀i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , p} yi = 0,∀i ∈ {p+ 1, · · · ,m}\nwhere we account for the dependence of the Lagrange parameters λ, µ on the transition point p. We compute the objective value of problem (5) for all transition points p in the range from k2 to m and select the one with the highest value. In the case, where the vector b is not sorted, we just simply sort it and note down the sorting permutation vector. The complete algorithm is given in Algorithm 2. The dominant contribution to the running time of Algorithm 2 is the sorting of vector b and therefore can be implemented in O(m logm) time.\nAlgorithm 2 Sparse-opt(b, k)\n1: Set a = sort(b) and get the mapping π such that ai = bπ(i) and aj > aj+1 for all valid i, j. 2: Compute values of µ(p), λ(p) and obj(p) for p from dk2e to m as follows:\nλ(p) = −\n√ p ∑p i=1 a 2 i − ( ∑p i=1 ai) 2\n(p− k2) µ(p) = − ∑p i=1 ai p − k p λ(p)\nobj(p) = −λ(p)(p− k2) + k\n∑p i=1 ai\np\n3: Set p∗ = arg maxp obj(p). 4: Set xi = −ai+µ(p ∗) λ(p∗) ,∀i ∈ {1, · · · , p ∗} and to zero otherwise. 5: Output: Solution vector y where yπ(i) = xi."

      "text" : "Previous approaches for solving SNMF [10, 7] use batch methods to solve for sparsity constraints. That is, the whole matrix is updated at once and projected to satisfy the constraints. We take a different approach of updating a column vector at a time. This gives us the benefit of being able to solve the subproblem (column) efficiently and exactly. Subsequent updates can benefit from the newly updated columns resulting in faster convergence as seen in the experiments.\nIn particular, consider the optimization problem (3) for a column j of the matrix W while fixing the rest of the elements of matrices W,H:\nmin Wj≥0\nf̃(Wj) = 1\n2 g‖Wj‖22 + u>Wj s.t. ‖Wj‖2 = 1, ‖Wj‖1 = k\nwhere g = H>j Hj and u = −XH>j + ∑ i 6=jWi(HH >)ij . This reduces to the problem (5) for which we have proposed an exact algorithm (Algorithm 2). We update the columns of the matrix factor W sequentially as shown in Algorithm 3. We call it sequential for we update the columns one at a time. Note that this approach can be seen as an instance of block coordinate descent methods by mapping features to blocks and the Sparse-opt projection operator to a descent step.\nAlgorithm 3 sequential-pass(X,W,H)\nC = −XH> + WHH> G = HH> repeat for j = 1 to r (randomly) do Uj = Cj −WjGjj t = Sparse-opt(−Uj , k).

The routine in Algorithm 3 converges and the rate of convergence is at least E[f(W τ ,H l)] − f(W ∗,H l) ≤ Cτ where τ is number of outer iterations (or equivalently number of matrix updates) for some constant C. The expectation is taken over the random choices of the column vectors in W and l is count of number of matrix updates to H.\nProof: To apply Theorem 5 from Nesterov’s paper [21], we note the following transformations: Q = ⊗ri=1Qi where Qi ∈ Rm and Qi = {‖Wj‖2 ≤ 1 ∩ ‖Wj‖1 = k ∩W ≥ 0}. Note that Qi are closed and convex sets. Also, the function f given in equation (3) is smooth and satifies the smoothness condition because the Hessian is constant. So, applying theorem 5 on our problem where C is a constant dependent on {W l,H l}, we have the following:\nE[f(W T ,H l)]− f(W ∗,H l) ≤ rT rT + T (C)\n= C\nT + 1\nIf we assume strong convexity, we can get a better rate of convergence."

Our experience with TPC was not encouraging on bigger datasets and hence we show its performance only on the synthetic dataset. It is possible that the performance of TPC can be improved by changing the default settings but we found it non-trivial to do so.\nSSNMF versus NMFSC: To ensure fairness, we removed logging information from NMFSC code [10] and only computed the objective for equivalent number of matrix updates as SSNMF. We do not plot the objective values at the first iteration for convenience of display. However, they are the same for both algorithms because of the shared initialization . We ran the SSNMF and NMFSC on the ORL face dataset. The rank was fixed at 25 in both the algorithms. Also, the plots of running times versus objective values are shown in Figure 3 corresponding to sparsity values ranging from 0.1 to 0.7.

Finally, we evaluate the performance of our exact projection operator Sparse-opt versus the Projection-heuristic of Hoyer on the high-dimensional natural images dataset.

So, we conclude that the speedup is mainly due to the sequential nature of the updates (Algorithm 3).\nAlso, we converge faster than NMFSC for fewer number of matrix updates. This can be seen by noting that the plotted points in Figures 3 and 4 are such that the number of matrix updates are the same for both SSNMF and NMFSC.

[22] (nsNMF) and Peharz and Pernkopf [23].\nWe note that our sparsity measure has all the desirable properties, extensively discussed by Hurley and Rickard [12], except for one (“cloning”). Cloning property is satisfied when two vectors of same sparsity when concatenated maintain their sparsity value. Dimensions in our optimization problem are fixed and thus violating the cloning property is not an issue. Compare this with the L1 norm that satisfies only one of these properties (namely “rising tide”). Rising tide is the property where adding a constant to the elements of a vector decreases the sparsity of the vector. Nevertheless, the measure used in Kim and Park is based on the L1 norm. The properties satisfied by the measure in Pascual-Montano et al. are unclear because of the implicit nature of the sparsity formulation.\nPascual-Montano et al. [22] claim that the SNMF formulation of Hoyer, as given by problem (3) does not capture the variance in the data. However, some transformation of the sparsity values is required to properly compare the two formulations [10, 22]. Preliminary results show that the formulation given by Hoyer is able to capture the variance in the data if the sparsity parameters are set appropriately. Peharz and Pernkopf [23] propose to tackle the L0 norm constrained NMF directly by projecting from intermediate unconstrained solutions to the required L0 constraint. This leads to the well-known problem of getting stuck in local minima. Indeed, the authors re-initialize their feature matrix with an NNLS solver to recover from the local suboptimum. Our formulation avoids the local minima associated with L0 norm by using a smooth surrogate."

The speed up is mainly because of the sequential nature of the updates in contrast to the previously employed batch updates of Hoyer. Also, we presented an exact and efficient algorithm to solve the problem of maximizing a linear objective with a sparsity constraint, which is an improvement over the heuristic approach in Hoyer.\nOur approach can be extended to other NMF variants [9].

    "abstractText" : "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a ubiquitous tool for data analysis. An important variant is the sparse NMF problem which arises when we explicitly require the learnt features to be sparse. A natural measure of sparsity is the L0 norm, however its optimization is NP-hard. Mixed norms, such as L1/L2 measure, have been shown to model sparsity robustly, based on intuitive attributes that such measures need to satisfy. This is in contrast to computationally cheaper alternatives such as the plain L1 norm. However, present algorithms designed for optimizing the mixed norm L1/L2 are slow and other formulations for sparse NMF have been proposed such as those based on L1 and L0 norms. Our proposed algorithm allows us to solve the mixed norm sparsity constraints while not sacrificing computation time. We present experimental evidence on real-world datasets that shows our new algorithm performs an order of magnitude faster compared to the current state-of-the-art solvers optimizing the mixed norm and is suitable for large-scale datasets.",
