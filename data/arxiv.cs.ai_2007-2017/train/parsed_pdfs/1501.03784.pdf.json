INTRODUCTION\nGRAPH Neuron (GN) is an approach for memorizingpatterns of generic sensor stimuli for later template matching. It is based on the hypothesis that a better associative memory resource can be created by changing the emphasis from high speed sequential CPU processing to parallel network-centric processing [2], [3]. In contrast to contemporary machine learning approaches, GN allows introduction of new patterns in the learning set without the need for retraining. Whilst doing so, it exhibits a high level of scalability i.e. its performance and accuracy do not degrade as the number of stored patterns increases over time.\nVector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) [4] are a bio-inspired method of representing concepts and their meaning for modeling cognitive reasoning. It exhibits a set of unique properties which make it suitable for implementation of artificial general intelligence [5], [6], [7], and so, creation of complex systems for sensing and pattern recognition without reliance on complex computation. In the biological world, extremely successful applications of these approaches can be found. One example is the ordinary house fly.

Another interesting biological example is the compound eyes of arthropods. These compound eyes consist of large number of sensors with limited and localized processing capabilities for performing relatively complex sensing tasks [9].\nThis article presents contributions in two domains: organization of associative memory and properties of connectionist distributed representation. In the first area the article introduces a novel bio-inspired architecture, called Holographic Graph Neuron (HoloGN), for one-shot pattern learning, which is build upon Graph Neuron’s flexible input encoding abstraction and strong reasoning capabilities of the VSA representation. In the second area this article extends understanding of the performance proprieties of distributed representation, which opens a way for new applications.\nThe article is structured as follows. Section II presents an overview of the work related to the matter presented in this article.

      "text" : "Associative memory (AM) is a sub-domain of artificial neural networks, which utilises the benefits of content-addressable memory (CAM) [10] in microcomputers. The AM concept was originally developed in an effort to utilise the power and speed of existing computer systems for solving large-scale and computationally intensive problems by simulating biological neurosystems.\nThe Hierarchical Graph Neuron (HGN) approach [2] is a type of associative memory which signifies the hierarchical structure in its implementation. Hierarchical structures in associative memory models are of interest as these have been shown to improve the rate of recall in pattern recognition applications. The distributed HGN scheme also allows for better control of the network resources. This scheme compares well with contemporary approaches such as Self-Organizing Map and Support Vector Machine in terms of speed and accuracy.\n1In [8], a house fly’s properties are compared and contrasted with an advanced fighter plane as follows: “Whereas the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the most advanced fighter plane in the world, takes a few measurements - airspeed, rate of climb, rotations, and so on and then plugs them into complex equations, which it must solve in real time, the fly relies on many measurements from a variety of sensors but does relatively little computation.”\nar X\niv :1\n50 1.\n03 78\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 5\nJa n\n20 15\n2 Vector Symbolic Architectures [5] are a class of connectionist models that use hyper-dimensional vectors (i.e. vectors of several thousand elements) to encode structured information as distributed or holographic representation. In this technique structured data is represented by performing basic arithmetic operations on field-value tuples. Distributed representations of data structures are an approach actively used in the area of cognitive computing for representing and reasoning upon semantically bound information [4], [11].\nIn [12] a VSA-based knowledge-representation architecture is proposed for learning arbitrarily complex, hierarchical, symbolic relationships (patterns) between sensors and actuators in robotics. Recently the theory of hyper-dimensional computing, and VSA in particular, were adopted for implementing novel communication protocols and architectures for collective communications in machine-to-machine communication scenarios [13], [14]. The first work demonstrates unique reliability and timing properties essential in the context of industrial machineto-machine communications. The latter work shows the feasibility of implementing collective communications using current radio technology. This article presents an algorithmic ground for further design of the distributed HoloGN on top of the architecture presented in [13]."

      "text" : "Figure 1 illustrates the Hierarchical Graph Neuron approach. Consider only the bottom layer of the construction without the hierarchy of upper nodes; this bottom level is the original flat network of Graph Neurons [2]. Each GN is a model for a set of generic sensory values. When seen as a network, graph neurons can be modeled by an array where columns are individual GNs and rows are possible symbols, which a neuron can recognize. For example, if there are only two possible symbols, say “X” and “Y”, in the alphabet of a pattern, then only two rows are needed to represent those symbols. The number of columns2 in the GN array determines the size of patterns, which it can analyse.\nAn input pattern is defined as a stimulus produced within the network. In Figure 1, each GN can analyse a symbol (“X” or “Y”) of a pattern comprising of five elements. In each GN (column) only the element with matching value (a row ID) would respond. For example, if the pattern is “YXYYX”, then in the second column “X” element will be activated as response to this input stimulus. If a particular element in the GN-column is activated it sends a report to all adjacent GNs. The report contains the activated GN’s element ID (the row index). Otherwise, it simply ignores the stimulus and returns to the idle state.\nDuring the next phase, all GNs communicate the indices of the activated elements with the adjacent columns at their level, and additionally communicate the stored bias information to\n2In this articles words “column” and GN are used interchangeably and refer to a single Graph Neuron.

The procedure continues in an ascending manner until the collective bias information reaches the top of the hierarchy. The higher level GNs can thus provide a more authoritative assessment of the input pattern. The accuracy of HGN was demonstrated to be comparable to the accuracy of Neural Network with back-propagation [2]."

      "text" : "Vector Symbolic Architecture is an approach for encoding and operations on distributed representation of information. VSA has previously been used mainly in the area of cognitive computing for representing and reasoning upon semantically bound information [4], [15].\nThe fundamental difference between distributed and localist representations of data is as follows: in traditional (localist) computing architectures each bit and its position within a structure of bits are significant (for example, a field in a database has a predefined offset amongst other fields and a symbolic value has unique representation in ASCII codes); whereas in a distributed representation all entities are represented by binary random vectors of very high dimension. These representations are also called Binary Spatter Codes (BSC), though for the remainder of the article we use term HD-vector when referring to BSC codes, for reasons of brevity. High dimensionality refers to that fact that in HDvectors, several thousand positions (of binary numbers) are used for representing a single entity; [4] proposes the use of vectors of 10000 binary elements. Such entities have the following useful properties:\n1) Randomness: Randomness means that the values on each position of an HD-vector are independent of each other, and \"0\" and \"1\" components are equally probable. In very high dimensions, the distances from any arbitrary chosen HD-vector to more than 99.99 % of all other vectors in the representation space are concentrated around 0.5 Hamming distance. Interested readers are referred to [4] and [16] for comprehensive analysis of probabilistic properties of the hyperdimensional representation space.\n3 Denote the density of a randomly generated HD-vector (i.e. the number of ones in a HD-vector) as k. The probability of picking a random vector of length d with density k, where the probability of 1’s appearance equals p is described by described by the binomial distribution (1):\nPr(k, d, p) = ( d\nk\n) pk(1− p)d−k. (1)\nWhen d is in the range of several thousand binary elements, the calculation of the binomial coefficient requires sophisticated computations. The following equations use an approximation of the binomial distribution, via the de MoivreLaplace theorem:\nPr(k, d, p) ≈ e −(k−dp)2 2dp(1−p)√\n2πdp(1− p) (2)\n2) Similarity metric: A similarity between two binary representation is characterized by Hamming distance, which (for two vectors) measures the number of positions in which they differ:\n∆H(A,B) = ‖A⊗B‖1 d = ∑d−1 i=0 ai⊗bi d ,\nwhere ai, bi are bits on positions i in vectors A and B of dimension d, and where ⊗ denotes the bit-wise XOR operation.\n3) Generation of HD-vectors: Random binary vectors with the above properties can be generated with Zadoff-Chu sequences [17], a method widely used in telecommunications to generate pseudo-orthogonal preambles. Using this approach a sequence of K vectors, which are pseudo-orthogonal to a given initial random HD-vector A (i.e. Hamming distance between them approximately equals 0.5) are obtained by cyclically shifting A by i positions, where 1 < i ≤ K ≤ d. Further in the article this operation is denoted as Sh(A, i). The cyclic shift operation has the following properties: • it is invertible, i.e. if B = Sh(A, i) then A = Sh(B,−i); • it is associative in the sense that Sh(B, i + j) =\nSh(Sh(B, i), j) = Sh(Sh(B, j), i); • it preserves Hamming weight of the result: ‖B‖1 = ‖Sh(B, i)‖1; and • the result is dissimilar to the vector being shifted: ‖B⊗Sh(B,i)‖1 d ≈ 0.5. Note that the cyclic shift is a special case of the permutation operation [4]. In the context of VSA, permutations were previously used to encode sequences of semantically bound elements.\n4) Bundling of vectors: Joining several entities into one structure is done by the bundling operation; it is implemented by a thresholded sum of the HD-vectors representing the entities. A bit-wise thresholded sum of n vectors results in 0 when n/2 or more arguments are 0, and 1 otherwise. Furthermore terms \"thresholded sum\" and \"majority sum\" are used interchangeably and denoted as [A+B+C]. The relevant properties of the majority sum are: • the result is a random vector, i.e. the number of ‘1’\ncomponents is approximately equal to the number of ‘0’ components;\nThe algebra on VSA includes other operations e.g., binding, permutation [4]. Since we do not use them in this article, we omit their definitions and properties."

      "text" : "The common steps in both recall modes is the procedure for the time-efficient search over an (unsorted) list of HoloGN records. Recall that all manipulations with VSAencoded entities are done using simple bit-wise arithmetic operations as well, and calculations to obtain the Hamming distance between entities. However, for this article we assume no particular optimized implementation of VSA’s bit-wise operations; this is because such operations are tailored to the architectures of specific microprocessors, which operate with words of substantially lower dimensionalities (typically 32 or 64 bits). Therefore, adopting these methods for implementing the bit-wise operations on words of thousands of bits would be cumbersome. Instead, an easily analyzable computational model is adopted in this article, which could also be adapted to an implementation on specialized computing architectures.\nIn what follows, each HoloGN pattern hi is modelled as a row vector of d elements. The list of stored HoloGN patterns\nis therefore modelled as an l×d matrix, where l is the number of the learned (stored) HoloGN patterns. Denote this matrix as H. The task of recalling a pattern with a target accuracy of ξ (ξ < 0.5) is formulated as finding the rows hi in H with Hamming distance to the query pattern hq less than or equal to ξ.\nThe conventional way of computing Hamming distance between vectors would be to perform the following sequence of computations for each row in H: 1) perform an elementwise XOR with the vector query; 2) sum up all elements in the intermediate result; and then 3) divide the result by the dimensionality of the vectors. The performance of the two implementations of this method using Matlab’s repmat and bxfun functions are shown by the top two curves in Figure 3. The curves demonstrate linear but rapid increase in the recall time with the increase in the number of the stored patterns. The lowest curve in the figure shows the performance of matrixvector multiplication of the same size, which is chosen as the reference case. The results were obtained on a Intel Core i73520M 2.9 GHz machine with Windows 7 operating system using one processor.\n1) Binary spatter codes as complex numbers: In order to improve the efficiency of calculating Hamming distances over a vast number of HoloGN patterns, we propose representing HoloGN patterns using complex numbers, where a binary 0 would be represented by √ −1 (i.e. the complex number) and a binary 1 would remain 1. The intuition behind this transformation is simple: multiplication of bits in the same position should produce three outcomes: −1 = j×j, 1 = 1×1 and j = 1 × j. That is, the multiplication of two similar bits would produce a real number and the multiplication of two different bits produces a imaginary number. In this way the sum of the imaginary parts over all positions in the resulting vector, divided by dimensionality d, will correspond to the Hamming distance between the two vectors. Thus, the suggested method allows us to implement the calculation of Hamming distance through the standard method of matrixvector multiplication, as illustrated below:\nH× hq =  √ −1 1 · · · √ −1 1 1 · · · √ −1\n... ... . . . ...√\n−1 √ −1 · · · 1 ×  √ −1 1 ...√ −1  =\n=  254 + 1633j 617 + 3824j\n... 548 + 4952j\n . (4)\nThe performance of the proposed method is illustrated by the red dashed curve in Figure 3. It demonstrates that the calculation of the Hamming distance is only two times slower than the usual matrix-vector multiplication. Specifically, to compute Hamming distance from the target vector to each of 20 000 stored patterns takes approximately 200 ms on the test machine. Further optimization of the matrix multiplication and execution on parallel architectures hint on realistic bounds on the recall time over extremely large numbers of patterns.\n5"

      "text" : "The first usage of HoloGN is probing the existence of the target query pattern amongst the previously memorized patterns. The perfect match in this case would be indicated by a Hamming distance of zero. The deviation from zero, therefore, reflects the degree of proximity of the query to one or several stored HoloGN patterns. In the following example the accuracy of the HoloGN recall was compared to the performance of the original HGN approach. For the sake of fair comparison the 7 by 5 pixels letters of the Roman alphabet (as in [2]) were used.\nIn the memorizing phase a set of noise-free images of letters illustrated in Figure 4 was presented to both architectures. In the recall phase images of the same letters distorted with different levels of random distortions (between 1 bit corresponding to a distortion of 2.9% of the pattern’s size and 5 bits equivalent to 14.3% distortion) were presented to the architectures for the recall. An example of a noisy input is presented in Figure 5. In the case of HoloGN the pattern with the lowest Hamming distance to the presented distorted pattern was returned as the output.\nFigure 6 presents the results of the accuracy comparison between the recall results for the HoloGN approach and the reference HGN architecture. To obtain the results 1000 distorted images of each letter for every level of distortion were presented for recall. The charts show the percentage of the\ncorrect recall output.

While establishing formal relationships to the framework of artificial neural networksis outside the scope of this work, this section presents the results of the pattern recognition accuracy of the HoloGN architecture under the supervised learning. In this case the HoloGN is presented with a series of randomly distorted patterns for each letter with different level of distortion (between 3% and 43%) as exemplified in Figure 5. In the experiments up to 500 patterns for each letter and every level of distortion were presented for memorizing. For the particular level of distortion i all e presented patterns of the particular letter Li were bundled to a single HoloGN representation as\nh(L) = [ e∑\ni=1\n(HGN(Li))].

In the recall phase for each distortion level HoloGN was presented with 500 new distorted patterns of each letter. The accuracy of the recall was measured as the percentage of the correctly recognized letters averaged over the alphabet.\nFigure 7 illustrates the obtained results: 90% accurate recall was observed when learning symbols distorted up to 15%.

This subsection provides a method for the quantitatively measuring the number of overlapping elements as a function of their relative Hamming distance. Denote m and n as lengths of two patterns, m <= n, and denote c as the number of common elements in these patterns. Let M be a c× d matrix of common elements where each row contains a random HDvector of dimension d encoding element ci. Denote an arbitrary column of matrix M as C. Since rows in M are independent, the density of ones in each column also follows the binomial distribution with p = 0.5 and length c. Denote the number of ones in column C as ||C||1.\nIn order to calculate the Hamming distance between the distributed representations of two patterns with known m, n and c, consider all possible cases when bits in the same position are different. The Hamming distance between two patterns can be estimated with equation (10):\n∆H = p(c,m, n) = c∑ ||C||1=0\n( c ||C||1 ) 2c · (p1(m, c, ||C||1)·\n·p0(n, c, ||C||1)+p0(m, c, ||C||1) · p1(n, c, ||C||1));\n(10)\nwhere pi(j, c, ||C||1) stands for the probability of having i (0 or 1), when the representation consists of j = m or j = n atomic vectors and c of these vectors are overlapped.\nDue to the symmetry in the calculation of probabilities, pi(j, c, ||C||1) is presented only for the case of p1(m, c, ||C||1).

The problem with practical application of this method, however, comes with the rapid convergence of the Hamming distance indicator to 0.5, making the difference between analyzable patterns indistinguishable as illustrated in Figure 12. For example, for HoloGN representations of patterns with 15 elements, sub-patterns of 3 overlapped elements are robustly detected, while patterns with fewer overlapped elements are indistinguishable. Thus, the minimal number of overlapped elements in two patterns which can be robustly detected using the Hamming distance indicator is called bundle’s sensitivity.\nThe analysis of the sensitivity is similar to the analysis of the capacity of VSA representation in section VI-B. For two patterns of length m and n elements, and c overlapped components, the sensitivity is calculated by (13):\nSensitivity(d, thr,m, n) =\nmin c\n(k+(d, p(c, n,m), thr) <= k−(d, 0.5, thr)) (13)\nFigure 13 demonstrates the development of the sensitivity threshold with the number of elements in the compared patterns. The results show that the number of components for robust detection grows linearly with the size of pattern. Patterns with more than 500 elements should contain at least 14 % overlapped elements to be robustly detected by the proposed method."

      "text" : "This article presented Holographic Graph Neuron - a novel approach for memorizing patterns of generic sensor stimuli. HoloGN is built upon the previous Graph Neuron algorithm and adopts a Vector Symbolic representation for encoding of the Graph Neuron’s states. The adoption of the Vector Symbolic representation ensures a one-layered design for the approach, which implies the computational simplicity of the operations. The presented approach possesses the number of\n9\nuniques properties. Prior to all, it enables a linear (with respect to the number of stored entries) time search for an arbitrary sub-pattern. While maintaining the previously reported properties of Hierarchical Graph Neuron, HoloGN is also improving the noise resistance of the architecture by this substantially improving the accuracy of pattern recall."
