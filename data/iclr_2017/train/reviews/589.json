{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Structured Sequence Modeling with Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks", "abstract": "This paper introduces Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN), a deep learning model able to predict structured sequences of data. Precisely, GCRN is a generalization of classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) to data structured by any arbitrary graph. Such structured sequences can be series of frames in videos, spatio-temporal measurements on a network of sensors, or random walks on a vocabulary graph for natural language modeling.The proposed model combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) on graphs to identify spatial structures and RNN to find dynamic patterns. We study two possible architectures of GCRN, and apply the models to two practical problems: predicting moving MNIST data, and modeling natural language with the Penn Treebank dataset. Experiments show that exploiting simultaneously graph spatial and dynamic information about data can improve both precision and learning speed.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The authors address the problem of modeling temporally-changing signal on a graph, where the signal at one node changes as a function of the inputs and the hidden states of its neighborhood, the size of which is a hyperparameter.

The two key ideas are: (i) a graph convolutional layer is used to extract features which are then fed in an RNN, and (ii) matrix multiplications are replaced by graph convolution operations. (i) is applied to language modelling, yielding lower perplexity on Penn Treebank (PTB) compared with LSTM. (ii) outperformed LSTM + CNN on the moving-MNIST.\n\nBoth two models/ideas are actually trivial and in line with the current trend of combining different architectures. For instance, the idea of replacing matrix multiplications by graph convolution is a small extension for Shi et al.\n\nRegarding to the experiment on PTB (section 5.2), I'm skeptical about the way the experiment carried out. The reason is that, instead of using the given development set to tune the models, the authors blindly used an available configuration which is for a different model.\n\nPros: \n- good experimental results\n\nCons:\n- ideas are quite trivial \n- the experiment on PTB was carried out improperly ", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "19 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Evaluation could be improved", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper investigates the  modeling of graph sequences . Authors propose Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GRCN)  that extends convLSTM  (Shi et al. 2015) for data having an unregular graph structure at each timestep. They replace the 2D convolution with a graph convolutional operator from (Defferrad et al., 2016).\nAuthors propose two variations of the GRCN model. In Model 1,  the graph convolution is only applied on the input data. In Model 2, the graph convolution  is applied on both  input data and the previous hidden states. They evaluate their approaches on two different tasks, video generation using the movingMNIST dataset and world-level language modelling using Penntreebank.\n\nOn movingMNIST authors show that their GRCN 2 improves upon convLSTM. However, they evaluate only with one-layer convLSTM, while Shi et al. report better results with 3 layers (also not as good as  GRCN) . It would be nice to evaluate GCRCN in that setting as well.\nWhile the authors show an improvement of GRCN relatively to convLSTM, GRCN on this task seems relatively weak compared to recent works such as the Video Pixel Networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016). It contradicts the claim that \"Model 2 has shown good performance in the case of video prediction\" in the conclusion.\n\nFor the Penntreebank experiments, author compares  their model 1 with FC-LSTM, with or without dropout. However, the results in (Zaremba et al., 2014) still seems different than the one reported here. In (Zaremba et al., 2014), they  reports a test perplexity of 78.4 for the large regularized LSTM in their table 1 which outperforms the score of the GRCN. Also, following works such as variational dropout or zoneout have since improve upon Zaremba results. Is there some differences in the experimental setting?  It would be nice to have results that are directly comparable to previous work.\n\n\nPros:\n- Interesting model, \nCons:\n- Overall, the proposed contribution is relatively incremental compared to (Shi et al. 2015) and (Defferrad et al., 2016). \n- Weak results of GRCN relatively to previous works in the experiments, that do not convince of the GRCN advantages.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "16 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "Lacks technical novelty", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The authors address the problem of modeling temporally-changing signal on a graph, where the signal at one node changes as a function of the inputs and the hidden states of its neighborhood, the size of which is a hyperparameter.
