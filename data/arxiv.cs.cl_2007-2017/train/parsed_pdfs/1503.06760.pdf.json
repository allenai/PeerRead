      "text" : "Unsupervised POS induction is the problem of assigning word tokens to syntactic categories given only a corpus of untagged text. In this paper we explore the effect of replacing words with their vector space embeddings1 in two POS induction models: the classic first-order HMM (Kupiec, 1992) and the newly introduced conditional random field autoencoder (Ammar et al., 2014). In each model, instead of using a conditional multinomial distribution2 to generate a word token wi ∈ V given a POS tag ti ∈ T , we use a conditional Gaussian distribution and generate a d-dimensional word embedding vwi ∈ Rd given ti.\n1Unlike Yatbaz et al. (2014), we leverage easily obtainable and widely used embeddings of word types.\n2Also known as a categorical distribution.\nOur findings suggest that, in both models, substantial improvements are possible when word embeddings are used rather than opaque word types. However, the independence assumptions made by the model used to induce embeddings strongly determines its effectiveness for POS induction: embedding models that model short-range context are more effective than those that model longer-range contexts. This result is unsurprising, but it illustrates the lack of an evaluation metric that measures the syntactic (rather than semantic) information in word embeddings. Our results also confirm the conclusions of Sirts et al. (2014) who were likewise able to improve POS induction results, albeit using a custom clustering model based on the the distancedependent Chinese restaurant process (Blei and Frazier, 2011).\nOur contributions are as follows: (i) reparameterization of token-level POS induction models to use word embeddings; and (ii) a systematic evaluation of word embeddings with respect to the syntactic information they contain."

      "text" : "Word embeddings represent words in a language’s vocabulary as points in a d-dimensional space such that nearby words (points) are similar in terms of their distributional properties. A variety of techniques for learning embeddings have been proposed, e.g., matrix factorization (Deerwester et al., 1990; Dhillon et al., 2011) and neural language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2011; Collobert and Weston, 2008).\nFor the POS induction task, we specifically need embeddings that capture syntactic similarities.\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n06 76\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 M\nar 2\nTherefore we experiment with two types of embeddings that are known for such properties:\n• Skip-gram embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) are based on a log bilinear model that predicts an unordered set of context words given a target word. Bansal et al. (2014) found that smaller context window sizes tend to result in embeddings with more syntactic information. We confirm this finding in our experiments.\n• Structured skip-gram embeddings (Ling et al., 2015) extend the standard skip-gram embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) by taking into account the relative positions of words in a given context.\nWe use the tool word2vec3 and Ling et al.

      "text" : "The hidden Markov model with multinomial emissions is a classic model for POS induction. This model makes the assumption that a latent Markov process with discrete states representing POS categories emits individual words in the vocabulary according to state (i.e., tag) specific emission distributions. An HMM thus defines the following joint distribution over sequences of observations and tags:\np(w, t) = ∏̀ i=1 p(ti | ti−1)× p(wi | ti) (1)\nwhere distributions p(ti | ti−1) represents the transition probability and p(wi | ti) is the emission probability, the probability of a particular tag generating the word at position i.5\n3https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ 4https://github.com/wlin12/wang2vec/ 5Terms for the starting and stopping transition probabilities\nare omitted for brevity.\nWe consider two variants of the HMM as baselines:\n• p(wi | ti) is parameterized as a “naı̈ve multinomial” distribution with one distinct parameter for each word type.\n• p(wi | ti) is parameterized as a multinomial logistic regression model with hand-engineered features as detailed in (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010).\nGaussian Emissions. We now consider incorporating word embeddings in the HMM. Given a tag t ∈ T , instead of generating the observed word w ∈ V , we generate the (pre-trained) embedding vw ∈ Rd of that word. The conditional probability density assigned to vw | t follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean µt and covariance matrix Σt:\np(vw;µt,Σt) = exp\n( −12(vw − µt) >Σ−1t (vw − µt) )√\n(2π)d|Σt| (2)\nThis parameterization makes the assumption that embeddings of words which are often tagged as t are concentrated around some point µt ∈ Rd, and the concentration decays according to the covariance matrix Σt.6\nNow, the joint distribution over a sequence of observations v = 〈vw1 ,vw2 . . . ,vw`〉 (which corresponds to word sequence w = 〈w1, w2, . . . , w`, 〉) and a tag sequence t = 〈t1, t2 . . . , t`〉 becomes:\np(v, t) = ∏̀ i=1 p(ti | ti−1)× p(vwi ;µti ,Σti)\nWe use the Baum–Welch algorithm to fit the µt and Σti parameters. In every iteration, we update µt∗ as follows:\nµnewt∗ =\n∑ v∈T ∑ i=1...` p(ti = t\n∗ | v)× vwi∑ v∈T ∑ i=1...` p(ti = t ∗ | v) (3)\nwhere T is a data set of word embedding sequences v each of length |v| = `, and p(ti = t∗ | v) is the\n6“essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful” – George E.

It is a scalable family of models for feature-rich learning from unlabeled examples. The model conditions on one copy of the structured input, and generates a reconstruction of the input via a set of interdependent latent variables which represent the linguistic structure of interest. As shown in Eq. 5, the model factorizes into two distinct parts: the encoding model p(t | w) and the reconstruction model p(ŵ | t); where w is the structured input (e.g., a token sequence), t is the linguistic structure of interest (e.g., a sequence of POS tags), and ŵ is a generic reconstruction of the input. For POS induction, the encoding model is a linearchain CRF with feature vector λ and local feature functions f .\np(ŵ,t | w) = p(t | w)× p(ŵ | t)\n∝ p(ŵ | t)× expλ · |w|∑ i=1 f(ti, ti−1,w) (5)\nIn (Ammar et al., 2014), we explored two kinds of reconstructions ŵ: surface forms and Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992), and used “stupid multinomials” as the underlying distributions for regenerating ŵ.\nGaussian Reconstruction. In this paper, we use d-dimensional word embedding reconstructions ŵi = vwi ∈ Rd, and replace the multinomial distribution of the reconstruction model with the multivariate Gaussian distribution in Eq. 2. We again use the Baum–Welch algorithm to estimate µt∗ and Σt∗ similar to Eq. 3.

To train the POS induction models, we used the plain text from the training sections of the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) (for Danish and Turkish), the CoNLL 2007 shared task (Nivre et al., 2007) (for Arabic, Basque, Greek, Hungarian and Italian), and the Ukwabelana corpus (Spiegler et al., 2010) (for Zulu). For evaluation, we obtain the corresponding gold-standard POS tags by deterministically mapping the language-specific POS tags in the aforementioned corpora to the corresponding universal POS tag set (Petrov et al., 2012). This is the same set up we used in (Ammar et al., 2014).\nSetup. In this section, we used skip-gram (i.e., word2vec) embeddings with a context window size = 1 and with dimensionality d = 100, trained with the largest corpora for each language in (Quasthoff et al., 2006), in addition to the plain\n7We use the configuration with best performance which reconstructs Brown clusters.\ntext used to train the POS induction models.8 In the proposed models, we only show results for estimating µt, assuming a diagonal covariance matrix Σt(k, k) = 0.45∀k ∈ {1, . . . , d}.9 While the CRF autoencoder with multinomial reconstructions were carefully initialized as discussed in (Ammar et al., 2014), CRF autoencoder with Gaussian reconstructions were initialized uniformly at random in [−1, 1]. All HMM models were also randomly initialized. We tuned all hyperparameters on the English PTB corpus, then fixed them for all languages.\nEvaluation. We use the V-measure evaluation metric (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) to evaluate the predicted syntactic classes at the token level.10\nResults. The results in Fig. 1 (left) clearly suggest that we can use word embeddings to improve POS induction. Surprisingly, the feature-less Gaussian HMM model outperforms the strong feature-\n8We used the corpus/tokenize-anything.sh script in the cdec decoder (Dyer et al., 2010) to tokenize the corpora from (Quasthoff et al., 2006). The other corpora were already tokenized. In Arabic and Italian, we found a lot of discrepancies between the tokenization used for inducing word embeddings and the tokenization used for evaluation. We expect our results to improve with consistent tokenization.\n9Surprisingly, we found that estimating Σt significantly degrades the performance. This may be due to overfitting (Shinozaki and Kawahara, 2007). Possible remedies include using a prior (Gauvain and Lee, 1994).\n10We found the V-measure results to be consistent with the many-to-one evaluation metric (Johnson, 2007). We only show one set of results for brevity.\nrich baselines: Multinomial Featurized HMM and Multinomial CRF Autoencoder. One explanation is that our word embeddings were induced using larger unlabeled corpora than those used to train the POS induction models. The best results are obtained using both word embeddings and feature-rich models using the Gaussian CRF autoencoder model. This set of results suggest that word embeddings and hand-engineered features play complementary roles in POS induction. It is worth noting that the CRF autoencoder model with Gaussian reconstructions did not require careful initialization.11"

      "text" : "Standard skip-gram vs. structured skip-gram. On Gaussian HMMs, structured skip-gram embeddings score moderately higher than standard skipgrams. And as the context window size gets larger the gap widens. The reason may be that structured skip-gram embeddings give each position within the context window its own project matrix, so the smearing effect is not as pronounced as the window grows when compared to the standard embeddings. However the best performance is still obtained when the window is small.12\n11In (Ammar et al., 2014), we found that careful initialization for the CRF autoencoder model with multinomial reconstructions is necessary.\n12In preliminary experiments, we also compared standard skip-gram embeddings to SENNA embeddings (Collobert et al., 2011) (which are trained in a semi-supervised multi-task learning setup, with one task being POS tagging) on a subset of the English PTB corpus. As expected, the induced POS tags\nDimensions = 20 vs. 200. We also varied the number of dimensions in the word vectors (d ∈ {20, 50, 100, 200}). The best V-measure we obtain is 0.504 (d = 20) and the worst is 0.460 (d = 100). However, we did not observe a consistent pattern as shown in Fig. 3.\nWindow size = 1 vs. 16. Finally, we varied the window size for the context surrounding target words (w ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}). w = 1 yields the best average V-measure across the eight languages as shown in Fig. 2. This is true for both standard and structured skip-gram models. Notably, larger window sizes appear to produce word embeddings with less syntactic information. This result confirms the observations of Bansal et al. (2014)."

      "heading" : "4.3 Discussion",
      "text" : "We have shown that (re)generating word embeddings does much better than generating opaque word types in unsupervised POS induction. At a high level, this confirms prior findings that unsupervised word embeddings capture syntactic properties of words, and shows that different embeddings capture more syntactically salient information than others. As such, we contend that unsupervised POS induction can be seen as a diagnostic metric for assessing the syntactic quality of embeddings.\nTo get a better understanding of what the multivariate Gaussian models have learned, we conduct a hill-climbing experiment on our English dataset. We\nare much better when using SENNA embeddings, yielding a Vmeasure score of 0.57 compared to 0.51 for skip-gram embeddings. Since SENNA embeddings are only available in English, we did not include it in the comparison in Fig. 1.\nseed each POS category with the average vector of 10 randomly sampled words from that category and train the model. Seeding unsurprisingly improves tagging performance. We also find words that are the nearest to the centroids generally agree with the correct category label, which validate our assumption that syntactically similar words tend to cluster in the high-dimensional embedding space. It also shows that careful initialization of model parameters can bring further improvements.\nHowever we also find that words that are close to the centroid are not necessarily representative of what linguists consider to be prototypical. For example, Hopper and Thompson (1983) show that physical, telic, past tense verbs are more prototypical with respect to case marking, agreement, and other syntactic behavior. However, the verbs nearest our centroid all seem rather abstract. In English, the nearest 5 words in the verb category are entails, aspires, attaches, foresees, deems. This may be because these words seldom serve functions other than verbs; and placing the centroid around them incurs less penalty (in contrast to physical verbs, e.g. bite, which often also act as nouns). Therefore one should be cautious in interpreting what is prototypical about them."

We find the performance from a simple Gaussian HMM competitive with strong feature-rich baselines. We\nfurther show that substituting the emission part of the CRF autoencoder can bring further improvements. We also confirm previous findings which suggest that smaller context windows in skip-gram models result in word embeddings which encode more syntactic information. It would be interesting to see if we can apply this approach to other tasks which require generative modeling of textual observations such as language modeling and grammar induction."

We also analyze the effect of various choices while inducing word embeddings on “downstream” POS induction results.",
