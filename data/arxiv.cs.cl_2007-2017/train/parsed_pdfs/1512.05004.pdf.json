The alignment function is not\nrequired to be bijective: multiple topics from M1 may map to the same topic in M2 (not injective) and not all topics in M2 are required to have an analog in M1 (not surjective).\nBasic Alignment — The basic alignment simply computes the Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) between each topic and all topics in M2. Each topic is simply matched to the closest topic, regardless of whether that topic in M2 is matched to another topic in M1.\nMathematically, this function is neither injective nor surjective, so an inverse alignment from M2 to M1 is not guaranteed to produce identical results.\nNaı̈ve Alignment — The naı̈ve alignment also computes JSD between each topic and all topics in M2. However, if the closest match in M2 has already been selected by a topic in M1, the algorithm proceeds to the next closest topic until it finds one that has not yet been selected.\nMathematically, for equal numbers of topics in M1 and M2, the naı̈ve alignment is bijective."

      "text" : "In this preliminary study, we examined five areas of the LCCO. These five areas were selected to give examples in arts, humanities, sciences, and engineering and at different levels of granularity. For each subject area, three classes of models were trained at k = {20, 40, 60, 80}:\n1. LDA topic modeling was applied to all volumes in the subject area to generate the reference model. 2. Additional models were trained over all volumes to generate multiple spanning models. 3. Models were trained over random samples of the subject area to generate subcorpus models. A basic alignment was performed between each spanning or subcorpus model to the reference model. Each alignment’s fitness score is calculated as the average Jensen-Shannon distance [14] between the word distribution of each topic pair. The results of the alignment are plotted against the sample size in Figure 2 for nb: Art Sculpture. Figure 3 shows the alignments for all five subject areas for k = {20, 40, 60, 80}.\nUsing the basic alignment, multiple topics in the spanning or subcorpus model may map to the same topic in the reference model and not all topics in the reference model need have an analog in the spanning or subcorpus model. We calculate the percentage of reference model topics captured by a basic alignment of the spanning or subcorpus model. Figure 4 shows topic capture for all five subject areas."

      "heading" : "Discussion and Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this preliminary study we wished to answer “Do random samples from within given LCCO categories yield significantly different TMs?” We find that the approach of principled subsampling can work, based on the existence of subcorpus models that have topic distances less than or equal to spanning models, relative to a reference model.\nWe highlight several phenomena for further investigation: 1. Topic distance decreases with sample size. (See Figures 2 and 3.) 2. Topic overlap increases with sample size. (See Figure 4.) 3. Different areas may have different characteristics, so a single sample size proportion may not be\npossible. (See Figures 3 and 4.) In particular, the behavior of different areas may be tied to the “cognitive extent” of the discipline [15]. While we only used five subject areas, Figure 4 suggests differing levels of cognitive extent. We hypothesize that in fields such as Art Sculpture, History of Ethics, and Bridge Engineering, a canon has emerged that is common to the structure of many foundational textbooks in the discipline. For example, discussions of the History of Ethics are likely to discuss Aristotle, Kant, Hume, and Mill, regardless of the specific speciality. Discussions of Art Sculpture are very likely to discuss Michelangelo and Rodin, regardless of other influences. Discussions of bridge engineering are likely to start with a review of classical mechanics before diving into the equations necessary for a suspension bridge. If this hypothesis is true, there may be two types of classifications: those for emergent fields, and those for canonized fields. This is a new empirical question only made possible by corpora the size of the HathiTrust."
