      "text" : "Transition-based dependency parsing formalizes the parsing problem as a series of decisions that read words sequentially from a buffer and combine them incrementally into syntactic structures (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre, 2003; Nivre, 2004). This formalization is attractive since the number of operations required to build any projective parse tree is linear in the length of the sentence, making transition-based parsing computationally efficient relative to graph- and grammarbased formalisms. The challenge in transitionbased parsing is modeling which action should be taken in each of the unboundedly many states encountered as the parser progresses.\nThis challenge has been addressed by development of alternative transition sets that simplify the modeling problem by making better attachment\ndecisions (Nivre, 2007; Nivre, 2008; Nivre, 2009; Choi and McCallum, 2013; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012), through feature engineering (Zhang and Nivre, 2011; Ballesteros and Nivre, 2014; Chen et al., 2014; Ballesteros and Bohnet, 2014) and more recently using neural networks (Chen and Manning, 2014; Stenetorp, 2013).\nWe extend this last line of work by learning representations of the parser state that are sensitive to the complete contents of the parser’s state: that is, the complete input buffer, the complete history of parser actions, and the complete contents of the stack of partially constructed syntactic structures. This “global” sensitivity to the state contrasts with previous work in transitionbased dependency parsing that uses only a narrow view of the parsing state when constructing representations (e.g., just the next few incoming words, the head words of the top few positions in the stack, etc.). Although our parser integrates large amounts of information, the representation used for prediction at each time step is constructed incrementally, and therefore parsing and training time remain linear in the length of the input sentence. The technical innovation that lets us do this is a variation of recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory units (LSTMs) which we call stack LSTMs (§2), and which support both reading (pushing) and “forgetting” (popping) inputs.\nOur parsing model uses three stack LSTMs: one representing the input, one representing the stack of partial syntactic trees, and one representing the history of parse actions to encode parser states (§3). Since the stack of partial syntactic trees may contain both individual tokens and partial syntactic structures, representations of individual tree fragments are computed compositionally with recursive (i.e., similar to Socher et al., 2014) neural networks. The parameters are learned with backpropagation (§4), and we obtain state-of-the-art results on Chinese and English dependency parsing tasks (§5).\nar X\niv :1\n50 5.\n08 07\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n9 M\nay 2\n01 5"

      "text" : "LSTMs are a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) designed to cope with the vanishing gradient problem inherent in RNNs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013). RNNs read a vector xt at each time step and compute a new (hidden) state ht by applying a linear map to the concatenation of the previous time step’s state ht−1 and the input, and passing this through a logistic sigmoid nonlinearity. Although RNNs can, in principle, model long-range dependencies, training them is difficult in practice since the repeated application of a squashing nonlinearity at each step results in an exponential decay in the error signal through time. LSTMs address this with an extra memory “cell” (ct) that is constructed as a linear combination of the previous state and signal from the input.\nLSTM cells process inputs with three multiplicative gates which control what proportion of the current input to pass into the memory cell (it) and what proportion of the previous memory cell to “forget” (ft). The updated value of the memory cell after an input xt is computed as follows:\nit = σ(Wixxt +Wihht−1 +Wicct−1 + bi)\nft = σ(Wfxxt +Wfhht−1 +Wfcct−1 + bf )\nct = ft ct−1+ it tanh(Wcxxt +Wchht−1 + bc),\nwhere σ is the component-wise logistic sigmoid function, and is the component-wise (Hadamard) product.\nThe value ht of the LSTM at each time step is controlled by a third gate (ot) that is applied to the result of the application of a nonlinearity to the\nmemory cell contents:\not = σ(Woxxt +Wohht−1 +Wocct + bo)\nht = ot tanh(ct).\nTo improve the representational capacity of LSTMs (and RNNs generally), LSTMs can be stacked in “layers” (Pascanu et al., 2014). In these architectures, the input LSTM at higher layers at time t is the value of ht computed by the lower layer (and xt is the input at the lowest layer).\nFinally, output is produced at each time step from the ht value at the top layer:\nyt = g(ht),\nwhere g is an arbitrary differentiable function."

      "text" : "Conventional LSTMs model sequences in a leftto-right order.1 Our innovation here is to augment the LSTM with a “stack pointer.” Like a conventional LSTM, new inputs are always added in the right-most position, but in stack LSTMs, the current location of the stack pointer determines which cell in the LSTM provides ct−1 and ht−1 when computing the new memory cell contents.\nIn addition to adding elements to the end of the sequence, the stack LSTM provides a pop operation which moves the stack pointer to the previous element (i.e., the previous element that was extended, not necessarily the right-most element). Thus, the LSTM can be understood as a stack implemented so that contents are never overwritten, that is, push always adds a new entry at the end of the list that contains a back-pointer to the previous top, and pop only updates the stack pointer.2 This control structure is schematized in Figure 1.\nBy querying the output vector to which the stack pointer points (i.e., the hTOP), a continuous-space “summary” of the contents of the current stack configuration is available. We refer to this value as the “stack summary.”\nWhat does the stack summary look like? Intuitively, elements near the top of the stack will\n1Ours is not the first deviation from a strict left-toright order: previous variations include bidirectional LSTMs (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005) and multidimensional LSTMs (Graves et al., 2007).\n2Goldberg et al. (2013) propose a similar stack construction to prevent stack operations from invalidating existing references to the stack in a beam-search parser that must (efficiently) maintain a priority queue of stacks.\ninfluence the representation of the stack. However, the LSTM has the flexibility to learn to extract information from arbitrary points in the stack (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).\nAlthough this architecture is to the best of our knowledge novel, it is reminiscent of the Recurrent Neural Network Pushdown Automaton (NNPDA) of Das et al. (1992), which added an external stack memory to an RNN. However, our architecture provides an embedding of the complete contents of the stack, whereas theirs made only the top of the stack visible to the RNN."

We preserve the standard data structures of a transition-based dependency parser, namely a buffer of words (B) to be processed and a stack (S) of partially constructed syntactic elements. Each stack element is augmented with a continuous-space vector embedding representing a word and, in the case of S, any of its syntactic dependents. Additionally, we introduce a third stack (A) to represent the history of actions taken by the parser.3 Each of these stacks is associated with a stack LSTM that provides an encoding of their current contents. The full architecture is illustrated in Figure 3, and we will review each of the components in turn.\n3The A stack is only ever pushed to; our use of a stack here is purely for implementational and expository convenience."

At each time step, the parser computes a composite representation of the stack states (as determined by the current configurations of B, S, andA) and uses that to predict an action to take, which updates the stacks. Processing completes whenB is empty (except for the empty-stack symbol), S contains two elements, one representing the full parse tree headed by the ROOT symbol and the other the empty-stack symbol, andA is the history of operations taken by the parser.\nThe parser state representation at time t, which we write pt, which is used to is determine the transition to take, is defined as follows:\npt = max {0,W[st;bt;at] + d} ,\nwhere W is a learned parameter matrix, bt is the stack LSTM encoding of the input buffer B, st is the stack LSTM encoding of S, at is the stack LSTM encoding of A, d is a bias term, then passed through a component-wise rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearity (Glorot et al., 2011).4\nFinally, the parser state pt is used to compute\n4In preliminary experiments, we tried several nonlinearities and found ReLU to work slightly better than the others.\nthe probability of the parser action at time t as:\np(zt | pt) = exp\n( g>ztpt + qzt ) ∑\nz′∈A(S,B) exp ( g>z′pt + qz′ ) ,\nwhere gz is a column vector representing the (output) embedding of the parser action z, and qz is a bias term for action z.

For example, when S is empty and words remain in B, a SHIFT operation is obligatory (Sartorio et al., 2013).\nWhy arc-standard? Arc-standard transitions parse a sentence from left to right, using a stack to store partially built syntactic structures and a buffer that keeps the incoming tokens to be parsed. The parsing algorithm chooses an action at each configuration by means of a score. In arc-standard parsing, the dependency tree is constructed bottom-up, because right-dependents of a head are only attached after the subtree under the dependent is fully parsed. Since our parser recursively computes representations of tree fragments, this construction order guarantees that once a syntactic structure has been used to modify a head, the algorithm will not try to find another head for the dependent structure. This means we can evaluate composed representations of tree fragments incrementally; we discuss our strategy for this below (§3.4)."

A\nlinear map (V) is applied to the resulting vector and passed through a component-wise ReLU,\nx = max {0,V[w; w̃LM; t] + b} .\nThis mapping can be shown schematically as in Figure 4.\nThis architecture lets us deal flexibly with outof-vocabulary words—both those that are OOV in both the very limited parsing data but present in the pretraining LM, and words that are OOV in both. To ensure we have estimates of the OOVs in the parsing training data, we stochastically replace (with p = 0.5) each singleton word type in the parsing training data with the UNK token in each training iteration.\nPretrained word embeddings. A veritable cottage industry exists for creating word embeddings, meaning numerous pretraining options for w̃LM are available. However, for syntax modeling problems, embedding approaches which discard order perform less well (Bansal et al., 2014); therefore we used a variant of the skip n-gram model introduced by Ling et al. (2015), named “structured skip n-gram,” where a different set of parameters is used to predict each context word depending on its position relative to the target word. The hyperparameters of the model are the same as in the skip n-gram model defined in word2vec (Mikolov\net al., 2013), and we set the window size to 5, used a negative sampling rate to 10, and ran 5 epochs through unannotated corpora described in §5.1."

We follow this previous line of work in embedding dependency tree fragments that are present in the stack S in the same vector space as the token embeddings discussed above.\nA particular challenge here is that a syntactic head may, in general, have an arbitrary number of dependents. To simplify the parameterization of our composition function, we combine headmodifier pairs one at a time, building up more complicated structures in the order they are “reduced” in the parser, as illustrated in Figure 5. Each node in this expanded syntactic tree has a value computed as a function of its three arguments: the syntactic head (h), the dependent (d), and the syntactic relation being satisfied (r). We define this by concatenating the vector embeddings of the head, dependent and relation, applying a linear operator and a component-wise nonlinearity as follows:\nc = tanh (U[h;d; r] + e) .\nFor the relation vector, we use an embedding of the parser action that was applied to construct the relation (i.e., the syntactic relation paired with the direction of attachment)."

Using the dimensions discussed in the next section, we required between 8 and 12 hours to reach convergence on a held-out dev set.6\nParameter optimization was performed using stochastic gradient descent with an initial learning rate of η0 = 0.1, and the learning rate was updated on each pass through the training data as ηt = η0/(1 + ρt), with ρ = 0.1 and where t is the number of epochs completed. No momentum was used. To mitigate the effects of “exploding” gradients, we clipped the `2 norm of the gradient to 5 before applying the weight update rule (Sutskever et al., 2014; Graves, 2013). An `2 penalty of 1× 10−6 was applied to all weights.\nMatrix and vector parameters were initialized with uniform samples in ± √ 6/(r + c), where r and c were the number of rows and columns in the structure (Glorot and Bengio, 2010).\nDimensionality. The full version of our parsing model sets dimensionalities as follows. LSTM hidden states are of size 100, and we use two layers of LSTMs for each stack. Embeddings of the parser actions used in the composition functions have 16 dimensions, and the output embedding size is 20 dimensions. Pretained word embeddings have 100 dimensions (English) and 80 dimensions (Chinese), and the learned word embeddings have\n6Software for replicating the experiments is available from https://github.com/clab/lstm-parser.\n32 dimensions. Part of speech embeddings have 12 dimensions.\nThese dimensions were chosen based on intuitively reasonable values (words should have higher dimensionality than parsing actions, POS tags, and relations; LSTM states should be relatively large), and it was confirmed on development data that they performed well.7 Future work might more carefully optimize these parameters; our reported architecture strikes a balance between minimizing computational expense and finding solutions that work."

The one exception to this is the −POS condition for the Chinese parsing task, which in which we underperform their baseline (which used gold POS tags), although we do still obtain reasonable parsing performance in this limited case. We note that predicted POS tags in English add very little value—suggesting that we can think of parsing sentences directly without first tagging them. We also find that using composed representations of dependency tree fragments outperforms using representations of head words alone, which has implications for theories of headedness. Finally, we find that while LSTMs outperform baselines that use only classical RNNs, these are still quite capable of learning good representations.\nEffect of beam size. Beam search was determined to have minimal impact on scores (absolute improvements of ≤ 0.3% were possible with small beams). Therefore, all results we report used greedy decoding—Chen and Manning (2014) likewise only report results with greedy decoding. This finding is in line with previous work that generates sequences from recurrent networks (Grefenstette et al., 2014), although Vinyals et al. (2015) did report much more substantial improvements with beam search on their “grammar as a foreign language” parser.10"

      "heading" : "6 Related Work",
      "text" : "Our approach ties together several strands of previous work. First, several kinds of stack memories have been proposed to augment neural architectures. Das et al. (1992) proposed a neural network with an external stack memory based on recurrent neural networks. In contrast to our model, in which the entire contents of the stack are summarized in a single value, in their model, the network could only see the contents of the top of the stack. Mikkulainen (1996) proposed an architecture with a stack that had a summary feature, although the stack control was learned as a latent variable.\nA variety of authors have used neural networks to predict parser actions in shift-reduce parsers. The earliest attempt we are aware of is due to Mayberry and Miikkulainen (1999). The resurgence of interest in neural networks has resulted\n10Although superficially similar to ours, Vinyals et al. (2015) is a phrase-structure parser and adaptation to the dependency parsing scenario would have been nontrivial. We discuss their work in §6.\nin in several applications to transition-based dependency parsers (Weiss et al., 2015; Chen and Manning, 2014; Stenetorp, 2013). In these works, the conditioning structure was manually crafted and sensitive to only certain properties of the state, while we are conditioning on the global state object. Like us, Stenetorp (2013) used recursively composed representations of the tree fragments (a head and its dependents). Neural networks have also been used to learn representations for use in chart parsing (Henderson, 2004; Titov and Henderson, 2007; Socher et al., 2013a; Le and Zuidema, 2014).\nLSTMs have also recently been demonstrated as a mechanism for learning to represent parse structure.Vinyals et al. (2015) proposed a phrasestructure parser based on LSTMs which operated by first reading the entire input sentence in so as to obtain a vector representation of it, and then generating bracketing structures sequentially conditioned on this representation. Although superficially similar to our model, their approach has a number of disadvantages. First, they relied on a large amount of semi-supervised training data that was generated by parsing a large unannotated corpus with an off-the-shelf parser. Second, while they recognized that a stack-like shiftreduce parser control provided useful information, they only made the top word of the stack visible during training and decoding. Third, although it is impressive feat of learning that an entire parse tree be represented by a vector, it seems that this formulation makes the problem unnecessarily difficult.\nFinally, our work can be understood as a progression toward using larger contexts in parsing. An exhaustive summary is beyond the scope of this paper, but some of the important milestones in this tradition are the use of cube pruning to efficiently include nonlocal features in discriminative chart reranking (Huang and Chiang, 2008), approximate decoding techniques based on LP relaxations in graph-based parsing to include higherorder features (Martins et al., 2010), and randomized hill-climbing methods that enable arbitrary nonlocal features in global discriminative parsing models (Zhang et al., 2014). Since our parser is sensitive to any part of the input, its history, or its stack contents, it is similar in spirit to the last approach, which permits truly arbitrary features."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We presented stack LSTMs, recurrent neural networks for sequences, with push and pop operations, and used them to implement a state-of-theart transition-based dependency parser. We conclude by remarking that stack memory offers intriguing possibilities for learning to solve general information processing problems (Mikkulainen, 1996). Here, we learned from observable stack manipulation operations (i.e., supervision from a treebank), and the computed embeddings of final parser states were not used for any further prediction. However, this could be reversed, giving a device that learns to construct context-free programs (e.g., expression trees) given only observed outputs; one application would be unsupervised parsing. Such an extension of the work would make it an alternative to architectures that have an explicit external memory such as neural Turing machines (Graves et al., 2014) and memory networks (Weston et al., 2015). However, as with those models, without supervision of the stack operations, formidable computational challenges must be solved (e.g., marginalizing over all latent stack operations), but sampling techniques and techniques from reinforcement learning have promise here (Zaremba and Sutskever, 2015), making this an intriguing avenue for future work."

Our primary innovation is a new control structure for sequence-to-sequence neural networks— the stack LSTM. Like the conventional stack data structures used in transitionbased parsing, elements can be pushed to or popped from the top of the stack in constant time, but, in addition, an LSTM maintains a continuous space embedding of the stack contents. This lets us formulate an efficient parsing model that captures three facets of a parser’s state: (i) unbounded look-ahead into the buffer of incoming words, (ii) the complete history of actions taken by the parser, and (iii) the complete contents of the stack of partially built tree fragments, including their internal structures. Standard backpropagation techniques are used for training and yield state-of-the-art parsing performance.",
