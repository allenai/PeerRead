      "text" : "1 Introduction\nOver the past few years, there has been a growing in terest in the problem of planning under uncertainty. Markov decision processes (MDPs) have received much attention as a basic semantics for this problem. An MDP represents the domain via a set of states, with actions inducing stochastic transitions from one state to another. The key problem with this type of rep resentation is that, in virtually any real-life domain, the state space is quite large. However, many large\nMDPs have significant internal structure, and can be modeled very compactly if that structure is exploited by the representation. In factored MDPs, a state is de scribed implicitly as an assignment of values to some set of state variables. A dy namic Bay esian network (DEN) [7] can then allow a compact representation of the transition model, by exploiting the fact that the transition of a variable often depends only on a small number of other variables. The momentary rewards can often also be decomposed as a sum of rewards re lated to individual variables or small clusters of vari ables.\nWhile these representations allow very large, com plex MDPs to be represented compactly, they do not help address the planning problem. Standard algo rithms for solving MDPs require the representation and manipulation of value functions - functions from the exponentially many states to values. Unfortu nately, structure in a factored MDP rarely induces any type of structure in the value function.\nAn obvious solution is to restrict attention to ap proximate value functions that can be represented compactly [3]. One very useful approach is to use lin ear value functions - functions that are weighted lin ear combinations of some small number of basis func tions. In recent work, there has been some success in using this approach to address the policy evaluation problem - determining the value function for a fixed policy. Generally, sampling is used to avoid explicit manipulation of the entire state space [5, 10]. In [9] (KP hereafter), we presented an approach based on approximate dynamic programming. The key to our approach was the use of factored linear value functions, where each basis function is restricted to some small subset of the domain variables. We showed that, for a factored MDP and factored value functions, the ap proximate dynamic programming steps can be imple mented in closed form without enumerating the entire state space.\nAll of these methods compute a linear value function that minimizes error in a weighted least squares sense,\nUNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000 327\nwhere the (squared) approximation error is weighted by the stationary distribution of the Markov chain induced by the current policy. This means that fre quently visited states will have high priority, while in frequently visited states will have only a slight influ ence on the value function. In a pure prediction con text, this is a very natural approximation. However, it is very poorly suited to the task of policy improvement, as the weights can result in very misleading estimates of value in states that are outside the range of the current policy, leading to poor choices in the policy improvement phase.\nOur first key result in this paper is a new approach for computing linear value functions that removes the dependence of the error metric on the stationary dis tribution. In Section 4, we present a closed form set of linear equations whose solution minimizes the Bell man error relative to any set of weights1 . By divorcing the value determination algorithm from the stationary distribution of the current policy, we can pick an error metric that is more conducive to policy search. Thus, we finally have the capability of using linear value func tions for policy iteration.\nFor the case of factored value functions and a fac tored MDP, the techniques of KP can be used to gener ate the equations efficiently, thereby providing an effi cient implementation of the value determination step. To construct a full policy iteration algorithm, we must also deal with the issue of representing and manipulat ing policies over very large state spaces. In Section 7 we show that, for factored value functions and factored MDPs, we can represent the one-step greedy policy compactly as a decision list, and compute its value effectively. The computational cost depends on natu ral structural parameters of the MDP and the value functions.\nWhen approximately solving an MDP, it is impor tant to evaluate how far our proposed solution is from the optimal. There are known results that allow us to bound this error, but they depend on a max- norm bound on the Bellman residual. In Section 8, we present an algorithm that exploits the problem struc ture to compute max-norm bounds on the Bellman error of a factored value function. This algorithm can be used to bound the overall max-norm error of our approximate value function, and thereby provide guid ance on how to adjust our approximation to provide\n1 We note that there are two interpretations of the least squares solution to the Bellman equations. The first is as the direct minimization of the mean-squared Bellman residual error as in [1], while the second is as the fixed point of a Bellman iteration with a least-squares projection of the value function, i.e., the standard linear temporal difference approximation method. We adopt the latter approach in this paper, although our methods can be used for direct minimization of the Bellman residual error as well.\nbetter results.\n2 Markov Decision Processes\nA Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined as a 4- tuple (S, A, R, P) where: S is a set of N states; A is a set of actions; R is a reward function R : S t--t IR, such that R(s) represents the reward obtained by the agent in state s; and P is a transition model where Pa(s' Is) represents the probability of going from state s to state s' with action a.\nA policy 1r for an MDP is a mapping from S to A. It is associated with a value function v1r : S t--t IR, where v1r ( s) is the total cumulative value that the agent gets if it starts at state s. We will be assuming that the MDP has an infinite horizon and that future rewards are discounted exponentially with a discount factor f. Thus, v1r is defined using the fixed point equation:\nV1r(s) = R( s) + 1 LP1r(s' I s)V1 r(s1).\ns'\nIt is useful to view this computation from the perspec tive of matrices and vectors. If we view v1r and R as N-vectors, and P7r as an N x N matrix, we have the equation (I) This is a system of linear equations with one equation for each state, and can be solved easily for small N.\nThere are several ways to find the optimal policy 1r*. A commonly used method is policy iteration which repeats the following steps until convergence:\n• For our current policy 1r, compute v1r. • For each action a, compute the function Qa:\nQ a = R + 1 Pa v1r (2)\n• Redefine 1r(s) := argmaxaQa(s).\nThe new policy is called \"greedy\" with respect to the previous policy and value function because it looks a single step into the future through the Qa functions. In practice, this process often converges in a very small number of iterations, making it the preferred method for solving MDPs if v1r can be computed efficiently.\n3 Linear Value Functions\nIn many domains, our state space is very large, and we want to approximate our value functions with more compact ones that can be maintained more easily. A very popular choice is to approximate a value function using linear regression. Here, we define our space of allowable value functions V � JR8 via a set of basis functions H = { h1 , . . . , hk}. A linear value function\n328 UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000\nover H is a function V that can be written as V = L:;=l Wjhj for some coefficients w = (w1 , . .. , wk)· It is often useful to define an N x k matrix A whose columns are the k basis functions, viewed as vectors. Our approximate value function is then Aw.\nFor a given value function V, we are often interested in finding the value function V = Aw that most closely approximates V. The notion of distance that is compu tationally most convenient is weighted L2 norm, where we try to minimize L:s p(s)(V(s)- V( s))2 for some set of non-negative weights p that sum to 1 (weighted least squares). We can find the optimal V using a simple projection process. Roughly speaking, we define each weight Wi by taking the weighted dot product with the corresponding basis function, and then correcting for the fact that our basis is not orthonormal. More precisely, the projection operation consists of comput ing w =(AT AA)-1 AT AV, where A is a weight matrix with diagonal entries equal to our projection weights p. This operation computes the least-squares projec tion of V onto the linear space defined by H. This computation can be implemented via the weighted dot product operation (f • g)p , defined as L:s p(s)f(s)g(s): The entries of our correction matrix AT AA are simply (hi • hj)p , and the entries of the vector AT AV are (hi • V)p · Thus, an efficient implementation of the weighted dot product is the key to the feasibility of this computation.\nNow, consider the task of evaluating some policy 1r. In this case, our goal is to approximate the true value function vn. unfortunately, we typically do not have vn; hence, we usually try to find v that minimizes the Bellman error: V - (/'Pn V + R). In KP, we provided an iterative algorithm for approximate value determi nation; this approach was aimed at factored MDPs, but applies to the general setting. Let P n be the tran sition model defined by the policy 1r. The iterative value determination equation is\nv(t+l) = 'YP1r v<tl + R (3)\nA used a weighted least-squares approximation to Eq. (3) is:\nUnder certain assumptions, this process converges to a fixed point which a bounded distance from the weighted projection of the true value function. One of the key assumptions is that the projection weights p must be very close to the stationary distribution of P n (in relative error). This assumption was necessary to ensure a contraction of the iterative algorithm. A sim ilar assumption is also crucial to the other (sampling based) approaches to the problem [5, 9, 10]. In gen eral, the stationary-weights least-squares approxima-\ntion has been the only type of approximation error for which theoretical convergence results could be shown.\nThis approximation is natural in a purely predictive context since it emphasizes the most frequently visited states. However, value determination is often primar ily a stepping stone to our ultimate goal, which is the construction of a good policy. Unfortunately, although weighted least-squares is a suitable approximation for predicting the performance of a given policy, it can be extremely unreliable when used as the value determi nation phase of a policy iteration algorithm.\nTo understand this issue, consider an MDP with the four states {so, . . . , s3} and the two actions L and R. The R action moves \"right\" - from si to Si+I (if available) - with probability 0. 9; with probability 0. 1 it fails and moves left. The L action has the op posite effect. The two middle states s1 and s2 have reward + 1. We specify policies as a string of let ters 7r(s0)1r(s1 )1r(s2)7r(s3). The optimal policy for this problem is RRLL.\nSuppose that we try to perform policy iteration using weighted least squares approximate value functions, with the basis functions: h1(sx) = 1, h2(sx) = x, and h3 ( sx) = x2• If we view value functions as continuous functions over the reals (with Bx representing x) , our approximate value functions span the space of parabo las.\nAssume we start with the policy RRRR, and com pute the approximate value function that minimizes the Bellman error relative to the stationary distribu tion of this policy. The value function is shown in Figure 1. At first, it looks like a reasonable approxima tion, but it has some critical flaws: The approximation is much better for states 2 and 3 than for states 0 and 1. The reason is that states 0 and 1 are visited very in frequently: for policy RRRR, the stationary distribu tion is p = [0. 00113, 0. 01096, 0. 09913, 0.88879], giving states 0 and 1 very little significance in the weighted least squares fit. The more serious problem is quali-\nUNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000 329\ntative. The shape of the value function is lost, giving state 0 a higher value than state 1. The greedy pol icy for this value function is LLLL. Symmetrically, the greedy policy for LLLL is RRRR and, thus, policy iter ation oscillates between these two suboptimal policies. This phenomenon is not specific to this problem; it has been observed by several researchers on a variety of problems (see, e.g., [2]).\nIn general, we would prefer to have a V that mini mizes maximum norm error. Since it is difficult to con struct such approximations, a uniform-weighted (un weighted) projection often serves as a tractable substi tute. Indeed, Figure 1 also shows the the results of a uniform-weighted value function projection for the pol icy RRRR. The value function correctly assigns state 0 a lower value than state 1. This leads to a greedy pol icy of RLLL and the optimal policy of RRLL is found in the following iteration.\n4 Value determination\nAs discussed above, all of the approximate value de termination procedures proposed so far have relied on the use of stationary-weights least-squares projection to guarantee convergence to a fixed point. In particu lar, the iterative approximate DP process we used in KP relies on this assumption. In this section, we pro vide a new approach for computing an approximate linear value function for a given policy 1r. The key in sight is that an iterative process is not required; we can find the fixed point directly by writing an approximate version of Eq. (1) and solving it:\nAw ATAAw\nw >:::;j f'P11\"Aw + R >:::;j AT A(!'P11\"Aw + R) >:::;j (AT AA)-1 AT A(!'P11\"Aw + R) (4)\nLetting B =!'(AT AA)-1 AT AP11\"A, Eq. (4) is equiva lent to (I- B)w =(AT AA)-1 AT AR. As B is a k x k matrix, we can solve this equation easily if I - B is invertible. Surprisingly, this is almost always the case:\nTheorem 4.1: For B = !'(AT AA)-1 AT AP11\"A and 1' < 1, I- B is invertible for all but finitely many I'·\nProof: The determinant of I - B is a polynomial function in /'i therefore, it is either uniformly 0 for all 1' or has only finitely many roots. I - B is invertible for 1' = 0. Hence, the determinant of I - B is not uniformly 0. Therefore, B can fail to be invertible for at most finitely many 1'- I\nCorollary 4.2: Eq. (4) has a unique solution, which can be computed in closed form.\nThus, systems without solutions are extremely rare and that if the solution does not exist, a perturbation\nin 1' will make the system solvable. Of course, some care must be taken to avoid numerical instability and large errors when inverting matrices that are slightly perturbed from singular matrices.\nIt is important to point out that the existence con ditions for our direct solution are much weaker than the convergence conditions for iterative approximate dynamic programming methods; an iterative solution to Eq. ( 4) may diverge for almost all starting points even though a unique fixed point solution exists.\nThe major advantage of our closed form solution is that it can be used to find a weighted least-squares approximation for any weighting p. Thus, we are free to choose our projection weights to minimize the prob lem described in Section 3, where using weights corre sponding to the stationary distribution of the current policy always misleads us about the value of rarely visited states. In other words, by allowing different projection weights, we can more evenly distribute our function approximation error and largely overcome the main obstacle to using factored value functions for pol icy iteration.\nThis closed form solution defines a computation each of whose operations- the dot product steps- seem to grow linearly with the number of states in the sys tem. Hence, it might appear that this procedure is not particularly helpful: If our state space is small enough to make this computation feasible, it is also small enough to allow an exact solution to the MDP. In the next section, we show that for factored MDPs and factored linear value functions, the relevant dot product operations can be executed exactly in closed form, without an exhaustive enumeration of the (ex ponentially large) state space.\n5 Factored MDPs\nIn a factored MDP, the set of states is described via a set of random variables X= {X1, .. . , Xn}, where each X; takes on values in some finite domain Dom(X;). A state x defines a value Xi E Dom(Xi) for each variable Xi. Thus, the set of states S = Dom(X) is expo nentially large, making it impractical to represent the transition model explicitly as matrices. Fortunately, the framework of dy namic Bay esian networks (DENs) gives us the tools to describe the transition model and reward function concisely.\nA Markovian transition model T defines a probabil ity distribution over the next state given the current state. Let Xi denote the variable Xi at the current time and XI the variable at the next step. The tran sition graph of a DBN is a two-layer directed acyclic graph Gr whose nodes are {XI. ... , Xn, X{, ... , X�}. For simplicity of exposition in the rest of the paper, we assume that Parentsr(XI ) � X; in graphical terms, all\n330 UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000\nFigure 2: A simple DBN with 5 state variables.\narcs in the DBN are between variables in consecutive time slices. This assumption can be relaxed, but our algorithm becomes somewhat more complex. We de note the parents of XI in the graph by Parentsr(XI). Each node XI is associated with a conditional proba bility distribution (CPD) Pr(XI I Parentsr(XI)). The transition probability Pr(x' I x) is then defined to be rt Pr(X� I Ui ) , where Ui is the value in X of the vari ables in Parentsr(XI). Figure 2 shows a DBN with 5 binary state variables. We will use this extremely simple DBN throughout the paper to illustrate some of the concepts we introduce.\nWe can define the transition dynamics of an MDP by defining a separate DBN model Ta = (Ga, Pa) for each action a. However, in many cases, different ac tions have very similar transition dynamics, only dif fering in their effect on some small set of variables. In particular, in many cases a variable has a default evolution model, which only changes if an action af fects it directly [4]. We therefore use the notion of a default transition model Td = (Gd, Pd)· For each action a, we define Effects[a ] � X' to be the vari ables in the next state whose local probability model is different from Td, i.e., those variables XI such that Pa(XI I Parentsa(XI)) f:. Pd(XI I Parentsd(XI)). (We note that d can be an action in our model, in which case Effects[d] = 0.) In our example DBN, we will define 5 actions, a1 . . . a5 and a default ac tion, d. Action ai changes the CPD of variable XI, so Effects[ai] ={XI}.\nFinally, we need to provide a compact representation of the reward function. We assume that the reward function is factored additively into a set of localized re ward functions, each of which only depends on a small set of variables. For this, and for other reasons, the following definition turns out to be crucial:\nDefinition 5.1: We say that a function f is restricted to a domain C � X if : Dom(C) H JR. If f is restricted toY and Y C Z, we will use f (z) as short hand for f(y) where y is the part of the instantiation z that corresponds to variables in Y. I\nLet R1, . . . , Rr be a set of functions, where each Ri is restricted to a cluster of variables W; C {X1 , . . . , Xn} · The reward function associated with the state x is then defined to be L:�=l Ri(x) E JR. For simplicity of nota tion, we assume that there is a single reward function R that has bounded domain W. (Since our methods are linear, this assumption is totally innocuous.)\nOne might be led to believe that factored transi tion dynamics and rewards would result in a structured value function. Unfortunately, this usually is not the case, as shown by KP in Example 2.1. In general, the value function will eventually depend, in an unstruc tured manner, on all of the variables that have any influence whatsoever, direct or indirect, on a reward.\n6 Factored value functions\nIn KP, we observed that, although value functions are not structured, there are many domains where they are \"close\" to structured. Hence, we might be able to approximate value functions well as a linear combina tion of functions each of which refers only to a small number of variables. More precisely, we define a value function to be a factored (linear) value function if it is a linear value function over the basis h1 , . . . , hk, where each hi is restricted to some subset of variables Ci (as in Definition 5. 1). In our simple example DBN, we might have 5 basis functions, h1 . . . h5 , restricted to X1 , . . . , X5 respectively. The function hi would evalu ate to 1 if X ; is true and 0 otherwise.\nFactored value functions provide the key to doing efficient computations over the exponential-size state sets that we have in factored MDPs. The key insight is that restricted domain functions (including our basis functions) allow certain basic operations to be imple mented very efficiently. We now describe these compu tational building blocks, that are central to our later development.\nThe first operation is the dot product. Assume that f is restricted to Y and g is restricted to Z, and let\nW = Y U Z. It can easily be shown that\nIDom(X)I \"' (! • g) = IDom(W)I L.., f (w ) . g(w )\nw\nThis computation can be done in time which is lin ear in IDom(W)I. Assuming that W is substantially smaller than X, this cost is exponentially lower than the straightforward exhaustive enumeration. In our example, W = {X1 , X2} for (h1 · h2), so there are 4 terms in the summation.\nNext, consider a factored transition model Pr de fined via a DBN (Gr.Pr)· A key operation is to back project a function f through Pr. In linear algebra notation, we want to compute Pr f, where we view Pr as an N x N matrix (for N = lSI) and f as an N-\nUNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000 331\nvector. The result is a function over S. Assume that f is restricted to Y. We define the back-projection of Y through r as the set of parents of Y' in the transition graph Gr; more precisely:\nNow, we can compute\n(Pr f )(x)\nL Pr(x' I x) f (x' ) x'\nx'\nL Pr(Y1 I x)f(y') L Pr(u' I x) y' u' Ex' -y'\ny'\nwhere z is the value of r r (Y) in x. Thus, we see that (Pr f) is a function whose domain is restricted to r r(Y). Note that the cost of the computation de pends linearly on IDom(r r (Y)) I, which in turns de pends both on Y, the domain of f, and on the com plexity of the process dynamics. In our example DBN, the domain of Prh2 is Parentsr(XD = {X1,X2}.\nWe can extend this idea to compute the weighted version of these operations, assuming our weights are represented in a factored way. Assume that X is par titioned into a set of disjoint clusters E1, ... , Eq, such that the weights p can be represented as a product of factors ( marginals) p1 , . .. , p k , where each Pi is a factor (distribution) over Ei. It is easily verified that (f •p) = Lyf(y)p(y). We can easily compute p(y) as follows: let Yi denote the part of y that overlaps with variables in the cluster Ei. We compute Pi(Yi) by a simple marginalization process, and then multiply the results for all i = 1, ... , q. We can now use this sub routine for doing the weighted projection, simply by noting that (f • g)p = ((! • g) • p).\n7 Policy Iteration for Factored MDPs\nIn this section, we show how to implement policy it eration using factored value functions. To make this process tractable, we need to address two fundamen tal issues. We need to represent policies over an ex ponentially large space, and we need to show how to perform the computation required for our closed form value determination efficiently. As we now show, we can address both of these issues within the context of our framework.\n7.1 Policy representation\nAssume that we have computed a factored value func tion V over our basis H. Initially, this computation\nwill not be a problem: we can start from some default policy that takes a fixed action a0 in every state, and solve Eq. ( 4) for Pa0, as described in the previous sec tion. If w is the result, the V = Aw is our factored value function.\nBased on V, we can easily compute Qa as in Eq. (2): Q a = 'YPaAw + R. As discussed in Section 6, FaA can be computed efficiently; it consists of a set of k func tions with restricted domains fa(Ci)· Thus, PaAw is a weighted combination of restricted domain functions. We can compute this Qa function for every action, in cluding the default transition model d.\nWe now have a set of linear Q-functions which im plicitly describes a policy 1r. It is not immediately obvious that these Q functions will result in a com pactly expressible policy. The key insight is that most of the components in the weighted combination will be identical in FaA and in FdA· Intuitively, a component corresponding to basis function hi will only be differ ent if the action a influences one of the variables in Ci. More formally, recall that\nc�\nwhere z is the value of r a(Ci) in X. Now, assume that Effects[a] n Ci = 0. In this case, all of the variables in Ci have the Same transition model in Ta and Td, SO that Pa(c� I z) = Pd(c� I z) and [Pahi](x) = [Pd hi](x). Let Ia be the set of indices i such that Effects[a ] n Ci -:1 0. These are the indices of those basis functions whose back-projection differs in Pa and Pd. In our example DBN, actions and basis functions involve single vari ables, so Ia; = i.\nWe can now define 8a(s) = Q a(s) - Qd(s). Our analysis shows that 8a ( s) is a function whose domain is restricted to Ta = UiEiar a(Ci)· In our example DBN, Ta2 = {X 1,X2}.\nIntuitively, we now have a situation where we have a \"baseline\" value function Qd(s) which defines a value for each state s. Each action a changes that baseline by adding or subtracting an amount from each state. The key point is that this amount depends only on T a, so that it is the same for all states in which the variables in T a take the same values.\nWe can now define the optimal policy relative to our Q functions. For each action a, define a set of conditionals (t, a, 8), where each t is some assignment of values to the variables Ta, and 8 is 8a(t). Now, sort all of the conditionals for all of the actions by order of decreasing 8:\n(5)\nConsider our optimal action in a state x. We would like to get the largest possible \"bonus\" over the default\n332 UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000\nvalue. If x is consistent with t1 , we should clearly take action a1, as it will give us bonus 61 . If not, then we should try to get 62; i.e., we should check if x is consistent with t2, and if so, take a2. In general, we can view Eq. (5) as a decision list representation of a policy, where the optimal action to take in state x is the action aj corresponding to the first event tj in the list with which x is consistent.\nTheorem 7.1 : The optimal one-step lookahead pol icy for a factored value function V has the form of a decision list as in Eq. (5).\nNote that the number of conditionals in the list is La JDom(Ta )l ; Ta, in turn, depends on the set of basis function clusters that intersect with the effects of a. Thus, the size of the policy depends in a natural way on the interaction between the structure of our process description and the structure of our basis functions. In our example DBN, the number of conditionals is 18: 2 from a1 and 4 each from a2 • • . a5.\n7.2 Value determination for decision-list policies\nThe second issue that we must resolve in order to \"close the loop\" is the computation of the value func tion for a given policy 1r.\nThe computational ideas described in the previous section allow us to provide an efficient implementa tion for the value determination algorithm described in Section 4, assuming both the process dynamics and the value function basis are factored. To understand why, consider a factored process Pr and a matrix A representing our basis. Recall that the main operation in the value determination process is computing the k x k matrices AT AA and AT APr A· We can compute the former by performing k2 weighted dot product op erations (h; • hj )A; we can compute the latter by per forming the k2 dot product operations ( h; • Pr hi) A.\nThe cost of these dot product operations depends on the overlap of the domains of the two functions. (For simplicity of notation, we ignore the weights in our analysis from here on.) More precisely, we define the structural cost cost(A, Pr) to be\nmax[�axJDom(Ci U Cj)J, ma_.xjDom(rr(C;) U Cj)IJ. t,J t,J\nThis expression measures the worst-case cost of com puting the dot-product of one of our basis functions with another, or with the back-projection of another. It depends on the extent to which the domains of ba sis functions overlap, and the extent to which back projection causes them to entangle. (Note that if X; is always a parent of XI, the second term in the max is no smaller than the first.) In our example DBN, the structural cost is 8 since Dom(rr(C;) U Cj) can contain at most 3 binary variables.\nWe want to apply this idea to the optimal one-step lookahead policy 1r defined in Eq. (5). In other words, we want to solve our fixed point Eq. ( 4) for a tran sition model Prr. In order to apply our efficient dot product operations, the transition model Prr must be factored as a DBN. Unfortunately, even with a decision list policy, Prr does not have the appropriate structure. Specifically, Prrhi may not have a restricted domain. The solution to this problem is based on the observa tion that PrrA is a combination of Pa,A for the different conditionals in the list (tt, a1, 61), with the proportions of the different conditionals being the number of states in which we apply this conditional. As we now show, there is enough structure in Prrhi that we can directly compute entries of AT PrrA efficiently.\nWe do this by computing (h;)T Prr(hj) for each pair of basis functions h;, hj:\nX\nwhere [Prrhj](x) is the back-projection of hi through Prr, evaluated at x. We can partition the states accord ing to the conditionals that are taken in the decision list. For l = 1, . . . , L, let St be the set of states in which the conditional (t1, a1, 61) is taken. Thus,\nL (h;fPrrhj = L L h;(x)[Pa,hj](x).\nl=l xESz\nConsider one of the terms in LxESz h;(x)[Pa,hj](x). Recall that Pa, hj is a restricted domain function whose domain is r a, ( C i). The basis function h; is also re stricted domain, with domain C;. We can now define Za, ,i ,i = r a, ( C i) U C; and rewrite the summation:\nL (h;f Prrhj = L L h;(z)[Pa,hj](z) 1\nl=l zEZa1,;,; zESz: Za1 ,i,j (x)=z\nLet f a,,i ,j(z) be the function h;(z)[Pa,hj](z). This is the product of two restricted domain functions and can be computed easily using our techniques in time at most cost(A, Pa1). The innermost summation simply counts the number of states in the current partition that are consistent with z. Define this as Na,,i ,j = i{x E S1 : Za,,i ,j(x) = z}J. Putting it together, we get:\nL (h;)T Prrhj = L L\nl=l zEZa1 ,i,j N · ·f · ·(z) a,,t,J a,,l,J · (6)\nIt remains only to compute Na, ,i,j. To understand this task, consider the simpler one of counting the number of states in S1. The states in S1 are the ones where we used the l'th conditional for selecting our action.\nUNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000 333\nThese are states that are consistent with t1, and which are not consistent with t1, ... , tt-l· Each tm is an as signment of values to some set of variables; x can be in consistent with tm by being inconsistent with any one of these values. Thus, inconsistency with the previous conditionals can be expressed logically as the conjunc tion of a set of disjunctions, i.e., a CNF formula. It is fairly straightforward to show, based on this obser vation, that computing Na1,i,j is #P-complete (and therefore NP-hard).\nFortunately, this problem will inherit some of its structure from the DBN describing the transition model, and we can use the tools of Bayes net infer ence to make this computation more tractable. In ef fect, we can view each statement - that x does not agree with tm for i = 1, . . . , l - 1, that x does agree with t1, and that x agrees with z - as a constraint on x. Our goal is to count the number of satisfying instances to this constraint satisfaction problem. Each of these constraints is local, and depends only on a few variables. The constraint on tm depends only on the variables in T a�, whereas the constraint on z depends only on the variables in Za1,i,j· We can compute Na1,i,j in time which is exponential in the induced width of this constraint graph. In our DBN example, we will have one cluster of size 3, arising from the constraint for Za1 ,i,j which involves a pair of variables for r az (Xj) and one variable for Xi, and a chain structure for the constraints on each of the previous action tests. The maximal clique size in a clique tree for this graph is also 3, so that the induced width of resulting constraint graph is at most 2. In general, if each action affects a single variable and the domain of each basis function is also a single variable, then the constraint graph has exactly the same structure as the original DBN (which has the same structure for all actions in this case).\nThis analysis shows that we can compute the matrix AT P1rA· We have already shown how to compute the other parts of Eq. (4), which do not vary with 1r. Our result in Theorem 4.1 now applies, so we can compute the value function that is the least-squares approxi mation to Eq. (4). This value function is factored, allowing us to compute its one-step lookahead policy, thereby closing the loop. Thus, we have shown that we can do policy iteration over these factored value functions and the policies they induce.\n8 Error Bounds\nSo far, we have shown how to compute value functions that minimize the (weighted) mean squared Bellman error and then how to use these value functions to select policies in policy iteration. To compute error bounds using standard methods, we need to compute the max-norm error in our value function, which we\nthen can use to bound the distance from our policy to the optimal policy. When we have reached policy 7r1, which is the greedy policy for v1r, we compute the maximum Bellman residual error as:\nBellmanErr(V7r) = max max[Qa(x) - V7r(x)] a x\nwhere Qa is the one-step greedy Q-function for v1r as in Section 7. v1r and each Qa are sums of restricted domain functions. Hence each inner maximization is over a linear combination of functions, each of which is restricted to some small subset of variables. This type of optimization problem is a cost network [8], and can be solved using standard variable elimination algorithms. The computational cost, as for other re lated structures, is exponential in the induced width of the graph induced by the hyper-edges consisting of the function domains.\nFor BellmanErr(V7r) :S t, we get [11]:\nI IV1r· - v7r ' lloo :::; -1 2t _,\nThus, the true value of following 1r1 is bounded by a function of the maximum Bellman error of v1r.\nThe above computation gives us a method of com puting the worst-case policy loss for any policy we produce through policy iteration. In general, policy iteration with approximate value functions can pro duce a sequence of policies of increasing quality. How ever, approximate policy iteration differs from the ex act case in that it can get trapped, repeatedly oscillat ing through a family of policies without ever finding the globally optimal policy. The loss of the worst pol icy in this family can be bounded as a function of the worst-case error in the corresonding value functions. [2]. Thus, it is also useful to compute the maximum Bellman error in our policy evaluation phase:\nBellmanErr1r(V) = max[V(x) - ('y(P1r V)(x) + R(x))]. X This can be computed using a combination of the cost network method and the policy evaluation method de scribed in Section 7. We omit the details for lack of space.\nThe maximum Bellman error during the policy eval uation phase can be used to catch potentially mislead ing value functions and help correct them. In addi tion to yielding the maximum Bellman error, the cost network computation tells us the state at which the Bellman error is maximized. If the Bellman error is large, we may wish to change our basis functions, e.g., by adding a basis function that can capture some im portant correlation. As an alternative, if we are using factored projection weights, we might simply adjust the weights to give the offending state greater impor tance in the least-squares approximation. Thus, we\n334 UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000\ncould gradually adjust our weights with the aim of minimizing the max-norm error in our policy evalua tion phase. These methods provide a means of moni toring the quality of the value function approximation during policy iteration, a guide for adjusting the ap proximation, if necessary, and a means of evaluating any final policy that is selected in comparison to the optimal policy.\n9 Discussion and future work\nIn this paper, we have provided a new policy iteration algorithm for factored MDPs, using a factored linear approximation to the value function. A key compo nent of our algorithm is a closed-form value determi nation method using weighted least squares with ar bitrary weights, rather than the stationary distribu tion weights This method is justified by a theorem showing that the fixed point solution to the approxi mate dynamic programming equation exists for almost any discount factor. The second key component of our algorithm is the observation that the basic opera tions can be done effectively in closed form for factored value functions, despite the fact that they are functions over an exponentially large space. This observation also permits the efficient computation of error bounds which, if desired, can be used to adjust the projec tion weights and evaluate the quality of the resulting policy.\nAn important theme that recurs throughout our work is the systematic way in which the algorithm exploits the structure of the model. The structure is utilized in many ways: in the operations used for basic value determination, in the compact representa tion of our decision-list policies, in the counting argu ment that allowed us to perform value determination for these decision-list policies, and in the computation of the Bellman error. In all of these cases, we saw the same structural features playing the key role: the clusters defined by the domains of the basis functions, their back-projections (for the dynamic programming step) and their forward projections (for the effects of actions). The complexity of our algorithm is deter mined by the size of these clusters, and by the extent to which they interact with each other: the joint size of overlapping clusters, and the induced width of the graph defined by these clusters. This is a very natu ral structural property that incorporates properties of the transition dynamics as well as of our chosen basis functions.\nThis paper opens up many interesting avenues for future work. In one direction, it is clear that we can extend our idea of doing closed-form computations to other MDP solution algorithms, such as linear pro gramming. In a very different direction, we believe\nthat we can extend this approach to exploit various other types of structure in the model, including struc tured action spaces, where at each stage several actions are taken in parallel, and the context-sensitivity uti lized by [3, 6]. As a more ambitious goal, we would also like to extend it to deal with the much harder problem of planning in Partially Observable MDPs.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Xavier Boyen for an insightful discussion that led to Theorem 4.1 and Carlos Guestrin, Uri Lerner and Simon Tong for useful discussions.

    "abstractText" : "Many large MDPs can be represented compactly using a dynamic Bayesian network. Although the structure of the value function does not re­ tain the structure of the process, recent work has suggested that value functions in factored MDPs can often be approximated well using a factored value function: a linear combination of restr icted basis functions, each of which refers only to a small subset of variables. An approximate fac­ tored value function for a particular policy can be computed using approximate dynamic pro­ gramming, but this approach (and others) can only produce an approximation relative to a dis­ tance metric which is weighted by the station­ ary distribution of the current policy. This type of weighted projection is ill-suited to policy im­ provement. We present a new approach to value determination, that uses a simple closed-form computation to compute a least-squares decom­ posed approximation to the value function for any weights directly. We then use this value de­ termination algorithm as a subroutine in a pol­ icy iteration process. We show that, under rea­ sonable restrictions, the policies induced by a factored value function can be compactly repre­ sented as a decision list, and can be manipulated efficiently in a policy iteration process. We also present a method for computing error bounds for decomposed value functions using a variable­ elimination algorithm for function optimization. The complexity of all of our algorithms depends on the factorization of the system dynamics and of the approximate value function.",
