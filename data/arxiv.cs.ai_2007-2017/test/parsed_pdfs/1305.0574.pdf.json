      "text" : "Today, SAT has gained a considerable audience with the advent of a new generation of solvers able to solve large instances encoding real-world problems, and the demonstration that these solvers represent important low-level building blocks for many important fields, e.g., SAT modulo theory (SMT), Model checking, Quantified boolean formulas (QBF) , Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), Pseudo boolean (PB), Knowledge compilation (KC), etc. In addition to the traditional applications of SAT to hardware and software formal verification, this impressive progress led to increasing use of SAT technology to solve new real-world applications such as planning, bioinformatics, cryptography and data mining. However, these impressive progress mainly concern the decision problem and some of its extensions (e.g. SMT, Max-SAT, QBF). In this paper, we deal with the problem of enumerating all the models of a CNF formula. This problem has been identified to be important in many application domains such as unbounded model checking, knowledge compilation, etc. Comparatively to other issues in SAT, enumerating all models or even models with some properties (e.g. preferred models) has not received much attention worthy of their theoretical and practical interests. Most of the recent proposed model enumeration approaches are built on the top of modern SAT solvers. These implementations are usually based on the use of additional clauses, called blocking clauses, to ensure an enumeration of all solutions without repetition [15,4,16,11]. Its naive form consists in adding the negation of the current found model. This concept is completely different from the notion of blocked clauses defined in [13]. Other improvements have been proposed to this bocked-clause based enumeration solvers (e.g. [11,16]). The goal is to find the smallest partial assignment satisfying the formula and covering the model found by the solver. A partial assignment of size k on a formula containing n variables represents 2n−k models, and its associated blocking clause will prevents the enumeration of such a set of models. ar X iv :1 30 5. 05 74 v1 [ cs .A\nI] 2\nM ay\n2 01\n3\nAll these blocking clauses based enumeration solvers are designed on the top of CDCL based SAT solvers. The main motivation is to benefit from the practical efficiency of SAT solvers for finding a single model. However, these kind of approaches are clearly impractical. Indeed, in addition to classical clauses learned form conflicts, one might add an exponential number of blocking clauses in the worst case.\nOur study is primarily motivated by our recent works on SAT-based data mining [5], and the crucial need for efficient techniques to enumerate all models of a given CNF theory. Recently, Luc De Raedt et al. [19] initiated an important research issue on the use of constraint programming (CP) to model and solve classical data mining problem (e.g. [20,12]). This new framework offers a declarative and flexible representation model. New constraints often require new implementations in specialized approaches, while they can be easily integrated in such a CP framework. It allows data mining problems to benefit from several generic and efficient CP solving techniques. The authors show how some typical constraints (e.g. frequency, maximality, closeness, monotonicity) used in itemset mining can be formulated for use in CP [9]. On these kind of problems, most of the constraints involve Booelan variables. This motivated the recent use of SAT-based approaches for both itemset mining [10] and sequence mining [5]. These new applications for SAT provide us with a new challenging issue: the design of efficient SAT enumeration algorithms.\nIn this paper, we give our first results on this important problem. We propose an extension of modern SAT solvers to enumerate all the models of a CNF formula. Our approach is based on a combination of DPLL-like procedure with CDCL based SAT solvers. To evaluate our proposed approach, we consider our encoding of the problem of enumerating frequent patterns in a sequence with wildcards. We also conducted extensive experiments of our proposed SAT enumeration solver on satisfiable SAT instances taken from the last SAT challenge. The experimental results, clearly show that our proposed model enumeration algorithm is significantly better than those based on CDCL-based solvers with blocking clauses."

      "text" : "Let P be a propositional language of formulas FP built in the standard way, using usual logical connectives (∨, ∧, ¬, ⇒, ⇔) and a set of propositional variables. Using linear Tseitin encoding, any Boolean formula f ∈ FP can be translated to CNF (f), a formula in conjonctive normal form. A CNF formula Φ is a set (interpreted as a conjunction) of clauses, where a clause is a set (interpreted as a disjunction) of literals. A literal is a positive (x) or negated (¬x) propositional variable. The two literals x and ¬x are called complementary. We denote by l̃ the complementary literal of l. More precisely, if l = x then l̃ is ¬x and if l = ¬x then l̃ is x.\nA unit clause is a clause containing only one literal (called unit literal). An empty clause, noted ⊥, is interpreted as false (unsatisfiable), whereas an empty\nCNF formula, noted >, is interpreted as true (satisfiable). We define Φ|x = {c | c ∈ Φ, {x,¬x} ∩ c = ∅} ∪ {c\\{¬x} | c ∈ Φ,¬x ∈ c} as the formula obtained from Φ by assigning the value trueto x. Φ∗ denotes the formula Φ closed under unit propagation, defined recursively as follows: (1) Φ∗ = Φ if Φ does not contain any unit clause, (2) Φ∗ =⊥ if Φ contains two unit clauses {x} and {¬x}, (3) otherwise, Φ∗ = (Φ|x)∗ where x is the literal of a unit clause of Φ. An assignment I of Φ is a function which associates a value I(x) ∈ {false, true} to some of the variables of Φ. I is complete if it assigns a value to every variable of Φ, and partial otherwise. A model of a formula Φ is an assignment that makes the formula true. The SAT problem consists in determining if a Boolean formula expressed in CNF admits a model or not. For an extensive overview about SAT and SAT solvers, we refer the reader to [3]."

      "text" : "In this section, we describe our simple extension of modern SAT solvers to deal with the problem of enumerating all models of a CNF theory. As mentioned in the introduction, the first naive way to extend modern SAT solvers to solve the problem of enumerating all modes of a CNF formula consists in adding a blocking clause each time a model is found. We call this first extension BC-Enum, for blocking clause based enumeration solver. The enumeration solver BC-Enum and its improved variants admit several drawbacks. The first problem is that the space complexity of BC-Enum-like algorithm is exponential in the worst case. Indeed, in addition to the clauses learned at each conflict by the CDCL-based SAT solver, the number of added blocking clauses remains very important on problems with a huge number of models. The second problem is related to the use of VSIDS variable ordering heuristic more suitable for finding a single model or proving that such a model does not exist. It is well known that the ordering used for enumerating all models may change radically the computational complexity [6]. In [7], Dechter and Itai have shown that enumerating all models of a given theory can be performed in time proportional to the product of the number of models and the effort needed to generate each model in isolation. Consequently, one possible way to improve such enumeration process is to search for all the models near the model found at a given iteration.\nMotivated by the above observations, we propose in this paper a simple extension to CDCL based solvers in order to enumerate all models of a CNF formula. Our algorithm, called BR-Enum (for Backtrack with Reason), is obtained from CDCL based SAT solver S in the following way:\n1. Search for the first model using S without any modification 2. After finding the first model, run S while inhibiting the restart (without\nrestart) 3. Let < x1, x2 . . . xn > be the sequence of decision literals of the branch asso-\nciated to the current model. The algorithm backtrack to the decision level n− 1 and propagate the literal x̃n thanks to the reason (x̃1 ∨ x̃2 ∨ · · · ∨ x̃n).\nOur proposal aims to eliminate the main limitations of the BC-Enum algorithm identified previously."

      "text" : "We here give a description of the problem of enumerating all frequent patterns with a wildcards in a sequence. The definitions and notations that we use are according to [17,18,1].\nLet Σ be a finite set of items, called alphabet. A sequence s over Σ is a successive sequence of symbols s0 . . . sn−1 belonging to Σ. The length of s is denoted by |s| (|s| = n). Furthermore, we denote by Ps the set {0 . . . |s| − 1} of all the locations of the symbols of s. A wildcard (or don’t care) is an additional symbol ◦ not belonging to Σ (◦ /∈ Σ). This symbol matches any symbol of the alphabet including itself.\nDefinition 1 (Pattern). A pattern over Σ is a sequence p0 . . . pm−1, where p0 ∈ Σ, pm−1 ∈ Σ, and pi ∈ Σ ∪ {◦}.\nNote that the first and the last locations of a pattern must both contain symbols in the alphabet, i.e. p1 6= ◦ and pm 6= ◦.\nDefinition 2 (Inclusion). A pattern p = p1 . . . pm is included in a sequence s = s1 . . . sn at the location l ∈ Ps, denoted p ⊆l s, if ∀i ∈ {0 . . .m−1}, pi = sl+i or pi = ◦.\nThe cover of a pattern p in a sequence s is defined as the set Ls(p) = {l ∈ Ps|p ⊆l s}. Moreover, the support of p in s is defined as the value |Ls(p)|. We write p ⊆ s if there exists a location l in Ps such that p ⊆l s.\nDefinition 3 (Motif/Frequent pattern). Let s be a sequence, p a pattern and λ a minimal support threshold such that λ > 1. we say that p is a motif (or frequent pattern) in s w.r.t. λ if its support is greater or equal to λ (|Ls(p)| > λ).\nWe denoted by Mλs the set of all the motifs of s w.r.t. λ.\nFor instance, let us consider the sequence s = abbabcabca and the pattern p = a ◦ ◦b. We have Ls(p) = {0, 3, 6} since p ⊆0 s, p ⊆3 s and p ⊆6 s,. In this case, if we consider that the minimal support threshold is equal to 3, then the pattern p is a motif of s.\nDefinition 4 (EMS). Let s be a sequence and λ > 1 a minimal support threshold (a quorum). The problem of Enumerating all Motifs in a Sequence (EMS) consists in enumerating all the elements ofMλs ."

      "text" : "We now describe the SAT-based encoding for EMS proposed in [5]. It follows the constraint programing (CP) based approach proposed by Luc De Raedt et al. in [19] for itemset mining. The SAT and CP based approaches in data mining are proposed in order to offer declarative and flexible frameworks. Indeed, new constraints require often new implementations in specialized approaches, while they can be easily integrated in such frameworks.\nLet Σ = {a0, . . . , al−1} be an alphabet, s a sequence over Σ of length n and λ a minimal support threshold. One can easily see that the length of each motif is smaller or equal to m = n− λ + 1. In this context, we set the length of each candidate pattern to the upper bound m and we complete the sequence s on the right hand side with m− 1 wildcards.\nLet p = p0 . . . pm−1 be a candidate pattern. We associate to each pi (0 6 i 6 m − 1) a set of |Σ| + 1variables {pi = a0, . . . , pi = aj . . . pi = al−1, pi = ◦}. In the sequel, for simplicity reason, we note the literal ¬(pi = aj) as pi 6= aj .\nDomain Constraint In the following constraint we encode the fact that for all i ∈ {0, . . . ,m− 1}, pi ∈ Σ ∪ {◦}:\nm−1∧ i=0 [pi = ◦ ∨ |Σ|−1∨ j=0 (pi = aj)] (1)\nm−1∧ i=0 [ ∧ 06j<k6|Σ|−1 (pi 6= aj ∨ pi 6= ak) ∧ ∧ 06j6|Σ|−1 (pi 6= ◦ ∨ pi 6= aj)] (2)\nIn the domain constraint, the two formulas correspond to the at least and at most constraints.\nSince the first symbol must be an element of the alphabet, one adds the following unary constraint (unit clause):\np1 6= ◦ (3)\nLocation Constraint The following constraint, denoted by loc(k, p, s), expresses that p is located in s at position k (p ⊆l s):\n(p0 = sk) ∧ [ m−1∧ i=1 (pi = ◦ ∨ pi = sk+i−1)] (4)\nSupport Constraint The following constraint allows us to capture the locations where the candidate pattern is included in the sequence s:\nn−1∧ k=0 (bk ⇔ loc(k, p, s)) (5)\nwhere b0 . . . bn−1 are n new Boolean variables. Note that bk = true if the pattern p is located at the position k in s; false otherwise.\nFrequency Constraint In the problem of enumerating all the frequent patterns in s w.r.t. λ, we need to express that the candidate pattern occurs at least λ times. This property is expressed by the following cardinality constraint:\nn−1∑ k=0 bk > λ (6)\nThe frequency constraint corresponds to a boolean cardinality constraint. In the literature, there are several polynomial encodings of this kind of constraints into a CNF formula. The first linear encoding of the general linear inequalities to CNF have been proposed by J. P. Warners [22]. Recently, efficient encoding of the cardinality constraint to CNF have been proposed and most of them try to improve the efficiency of constraint propagation (e.g; [2,21])."

      "heading" : "5 Experiments",
      "text" : "In this section, an experimental evaluation of our approach on large real world instances is given. We compare both BR-Enum and BC-Enum implemented on the top of the state of the art SAT solver MiniSAT 2.2 1.\nWe conducted two kind of experiments. In the first one, we considered the satisfiable SAT instances taken from the SAT Challenge 2012 2 . After 4 hours time limit, only few instances are solved i.e. all the models are found. On the majority of the instances, the number of models is very huge, or the formula contains a small number of models and the proof of the unsatisfiability takes a long time. The results are depicted in Table 1. As we can see on the solved instances, BR-Enum significantly outperform BC-Enum. What is surprising, is that BR-Enum is even better for proving the unsatisfiability after finding the single model of the instance. We recall that both approaches perform the same search until finding the first model. In Table 2, we report on a sample of instances, the number of models computed by both approaches under the time limit of 1 hour. Again the number of models computed by BR-Enum is significantly higher than the number of models computed by BC-Enum.\nIn the second experiment, we consider our SAT-Based encoding of the sequence mining problem (EMS). The datasets are taken from two application domains:\n– Bioinformatics: proteinic data encoded as a sequence of amino-acid 3. – Computer security: user data drawn from the command histories of UNIX\ncomputer users4 [14].\nThis experiment aims to analyze the behavior of our proposed algorithm on SAT instances encoding real world enumeration problems.

As we can see, on both Bioinformatics (left side) or Computer security (right side) instances, BR-Enum approach leads to important improvements in terms of CPU time.\nIn Table 3 we give more detailed results on some instances. As expected, higher is the number of models, better are the performances of BR-Enum."

Our extension aims to benefit from the efficiency of SAT solvers for finding a single model, while avoiding the main limitations behind the use of blocking clauses to avoid enumerating the same models. We have shown that our proposed approach outperform blocking clause based enumeration techniques with several orders of magnitude on both satisfiable instances taken from the last SAT challenge and also on the SAT instances encoding the sequence mining problem. In a future work, a first improvement to our new BR-Enum algorithm consists in integrating, when a model is found, the best simplification techniques to derive the smallest possible sub-sequence of decisions that can be extended to the current model by unit propagation. We also plan, to compare our approach with other model enumeration algorithms [8,23]."
