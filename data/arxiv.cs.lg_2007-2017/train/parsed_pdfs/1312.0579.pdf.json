      "text" : "In real-world applications, we are often forced to trade-off between accurate predictions and the computation time needed to make them. In many problems, structured prediction algorithms are necessary to obtain accurate predictions; however, this class of techniques is typically more computationally demanding over simpler locally independent predictions. Furthermore, under limited computational resources we may forced to make a prediction after a limited and unknown amount of time. Therefore, we require an approach that is efficient while also capable of returning a sensible prediction when requested at any time. Furthermore, as the inference procedure is given more time, we should expect the predictive performance to also increase.\n∗agrubb@cmu.edu †dmunoz@cs.cmu.edu ‡dbagnell@cs.cmu.edu §hebert@cs.cmu.edu\nar X\niv :1\n31 2.\n05 79\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\nThe contribution of this work is an algorithm for making anytime structured predictions. As detailed in the following sections, our approach accounts for both inference and feature computation times while automatically trading-off cost for accuracy, and vice versa, in order to maximize predictive performance with respect to computation time. Although our approach is applicable towards a variety of different structured prediction problems, we analyze its efficacy on the challenging problem of scene understanding in computer vision. Our experiments demonstrate that we can learn an efficient, anytime predictor whose classification performance improves towards state-of-the-art while automatically selecting what features to compute and where to compute them with respect to time."

      "text" : "A canonical approach for incorporating computation time during learning is a cascade of feed-forward modules, where each module becomes more sophisticated but also more computationally expensive the further it is down the cascade [26]. One drawback of the cascade approach is that the procedure is trained for a specific sequence length and is not suited for interruption. For example, stopping predictions after one module in a long cascade will generally perform much worse than a predictor that was trained in isolation. Recent works [9, 12, 29, 14] have investigated techniques for learning locally independent predictors which balance feature computation time and inference time during learning; however, they are not immediately amenable to the structured prediction scenario.\nIn the structured setting, Jiang et al. [13] proposed a technique for reinforcement learning that incorporates a user specified speed/accuracy trade-off distribution, and Weiss and Taskar [27] proposed a cascaded analog for structured prediction where the solution space is is iteratively refined/pruned over time. In contrast, we are focused on learning a structured predictor with interruptible, anytime properties which is also trained to balance both the structural and feature computation times during the inference procedure. Recent work in computer vision and robotics [23, 5] has similarly investigated techniques for making approximate inference in graphical models more efficient via a cascaded procedure that iteratively prunes subregions in the scene to analyze. We similarly incorporate such structure selection in our approach; however, we also account for feature computation time and avoid the early hard commitments required with a cascaded approach. This allows for early predictions to be as accurate as possible, as they do not have to be made conservatively as in the cascade approach."

      "text" : "In the structured prediction setting, we are given inputs x ∈ X and associated structured outputs y ∈ Y. The goal is to learn a function f : X → Y that minimizes some risk R[f ], typically evaluated pointwise over the inputs:\nR[f ] = EX [l(f(x))]. (1)\nWe will further assume that each input and output pair has some underlying structure, such as the graph structure of graphical models, that can be utilized to predict portions of the output locally. Let j index these structural elements. We then assume that a final structured output y can be represented as a variable length vector (y1, . . . , yJ), where each element yj lies in some vector space yj ∈ Y ′. For example, these outputs could be the probability distribution over class labels for each pixel in an image, or distributions of part-of-speech labels for each word in a sentence. Similarly we can compute some features xj representing the portion of the input which corresponds to a given output, such as features computed over a neighborhood around a pixel in an input image.\nAs another example, consider labeling tasks such as part-of-speech tagging. In this domain, we are given a set of input sentences X , and for each word j in a given sentence, we want to output a vector ŷj ∈ RK containing the scores with respect to each of the K possible part-of-speech labels for that word. This sequence of vectors for each word is the complete structured prediction ŷ. An example loss function for this domain would be the multiclass log-loss, averaged over words, with respect to the ground truth parts-of-speech.\nAlong with the encoding of the problem, we also assume that the structure can be used to reduce the scope of the prediction problem, as in graphical models. One common approach to generating predictions on these structures is to use a policy-based or iterative decoding approach, instead of probabilistic inference over a graphical model [3, 4, 25, 21, 20]. In order to model the contextual relationships among the outputs, these iterative approaches commonly perform a sequence of predictions, where each update relies on previous predictions made across the structure of the problem.\nLet N(j) represent the locally connected elements of j, such as the locally connected factors of a node j in a typical graphical model. For a given node j, the predictions over the neighboring nodes ŷN(j) can then be used to update the prediction for that node. For example, in the character recognition task, the predictions for neighboring characters can influence the prediction for a given character, and be used to update and improve the accuracy of that prediction.\nIn the iterative decoding approach a predictor φ is iteratively used to update different elements ŷj of the final structured output:\nŷj = φ(xj , ŷN(j)). (2)\nA complete policy then consists of a strategy for selecting which elements of the structured output to update, coupled with the predictor for updating the\ngiven outputs. Typical approaches include randomly selecting elements to update, iterating over the structure in a fixed ordering, or simultaneously updating all predictions at all iterations. As shown by Ross et al. [20], this iterative decoding approach can is equivalent to message passing approaches used to solve graphical models, where each update encodes a single set of messages passed to one node in the graphical model."

Minimizing this functional can be viewed as performing gradient descent in function space [18, 8]. Assuming the loss function is of the form given in (Eq. 1), the functional gradient, ∇ = ∇fR[f ], is a function of the form\n∇(x) = ∂l(f(x)) ∂f(x) . (4)\nThe weak predictor h that best minimizes the projection error of the functional gradient is selected at each iteration:\nht = arg max h∈H\n〈∇R[ft−1], h〉, (5)\nαt = arg min α∈R\nR[ft−1 + αht]. (6)\nMinimizing this projection error can be equivalently performed through the least squares minimization\nht = arg min h∈H\nEX [ ‖∇(x)− h(x)‖2 ] . (7)\nExtending this framework, Grubb and Bagnell [12] introduce an anytime prediction method that modifies the standard boosting criterion to automatically trade-off the loss of a weak predictor, h, with its cost c(h) ∈ R+. They do this by using a cost-greedy selection criterion that selects the weak predictor which gets the best improvement in loss per unit cost,\nht, αt = arg max h∈H,α∈R R [ft−1]−R [ft−1 + αh] c(h) . (8)\nHence, for some fixed number of iterations T , the total cost of the learned function is c(fT ) = ∑T t=1 c(ht). The learned predictor can easily adjust to any new budget of costs by evaluating the sequence until the budget is exhausted. Grubb and Bagnell prove that this SpeedBoost algorithm updates the resulting predictions at an increasing sequence of budgets that is competitive with any other sequence which uses the same weak predictors for a wide range of budgets [12]."

To accomplish this, we will adapt the policy-based iterative decoding approach to use an additive policy instead of one which replaces previous predictions.\nIn the iterative decoding described previously, recall that we have two components, one for selecting which elements to update, and another for updating the predictions of the given elements. Let St be the set of components selected for updating at iteration t. For current predictions yt we can re-write the policy for computing the predictions at the next iteration of the iterative decoding procedure as:\nŷt+1j =\n{ φ(xj , ŷ t N(j)) if j ∈ S t\nŷtj otherwise . (9)\nThe additive version of this policy instead uses weak predictors h, each of which maps both the input data and previous structured output to a more refined structured output, h : X × Y → Y:\nŷt+1 = ŷt + h(x, ŷt). (10)\nWe can build a weak predictor h which performs the same actions as the previous replacement policy by considering weak predictors with two parts: a function hS which selects which structural elements to update, and a predictor hP which runs on the selected elements and updates the respective pieces of the structured output.\nThe selection function hS takes in an input x and previous prediction ŷ and outputs a set of structural nodes S = {j1, j2, . . .} to update. For each structural element selected by hS, the predictor hP takes the place of φ in the previous policy, taking (xj , ŷN(j)) and computing an update for the prediction ŷj .\nReturning to the part-of-speech tagging example, possible selection functions would select different chunks of the sentence, either individual words or multiword phrases using some selection criteria. Given the set of selected elements, a prediction function would take each selected word or phrase and update the predicted distribution over the part-of-speech labels using the features for that word or phrase.\nUsing these elements we can write the weak predictor h, which produces a structured output (h(·)1, . . . , h(·)J), as\nh(x, ŷt)j =\n{ hP(xj , ŷ t N(j)) if j ∈ hS(x, ŷ)\n0 otherwise , (11)\nor alternatively we can write this using an indicator function:\nh(x, ŷt)j = 1(j ∈ hS(x, ŷt))hP(xj , ŷtN(j)). (12)\nThe adapted cost model for this weak predictor is then simply the sum of the cost of evaluating both the selection function and the prediction function,\nc(h) = c(hS) + c(hP). (13)"

In practice, these algorithms are generated by varying the complexities of the algorithm, e.g., depths in a decision tree predictor.\nGiven a fixed selection function hS and current predictions ŷ, we can build a dataset appropriate for training weak predictors hP as follows.

In practice, this can be alleviated by adapting the concept of stacking [28], which has demonstrated to be useful in other structured prediction work [3, 19]. Conceptually, the idea is that we do not want to use the same f we are currently learning to generate ŷ for use in the next boosting iteration. Concretely, we can instead split our entire training set Ω into two disjoint subsets, Ω = A∪B, A∩B = ∅. At training time, we learn three separate structured predictors f, fA, fB over datasets Ω, A,B, respectively. Let hP, h A P , h B P be the prediction functions for the structured predictors f, f\nA, fB , respectively. When training hP over x ∈ Ω, the predictions ŷ are generated from held-out predictions: for x ∈ A, ŷ = fB(x), and for x ∈ B, ŷ = fA(x). Now we need to train fA and fB in the same hold-out manner: when training hAP over x ∈ A, ŷ = fB(x), and when training hBP over x ∈ B, ŷ = fA(x). This interleaving process is solely done at training time to induce less-overfit predictions ŷ when training structured predictor f . Since f is trained over all the training data, we use solely its prediction at test-time and discard fA and fB . In practice, we follow this procedure using 10 folds instead of just two."

While random fields provide a clean interface between modeling and inference, recent works [25, 19, 21, 6] have demonstrated alternative approaches that achieve equivalent or improved performances with the additional benefit of a simple, efficient, and modular inference procedure.\nInspired by the hierarchical representation used in the state-of-the-art scene understanding technique from Munoz et al. [19], we apply StructuredSpeedBoost to the scene understanding problem by reasoning over differently sized regions in the scene. In the following, we briefly review the hierarchical inference machine (HIM) approach from [19] and then describe how we can perform an anytime prediction whose structure is similar in spirit."

By incorporating multiple different segmentations, this representation addresses the problem of scale ambiguity in images. Instead of performing (approximate) inference on a large random field defined over the regions, inference is broken down into a sequence of predictions. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a predictor f is associated with each level in the hierarchy that predicts the probability distribution of classes/objects contained within each region. These predictions are then used by the subsequent predictor in the next level (in addition to features derived from the image statistics) to make refined predictions on the finer regions; and the process iterates. By passing class distributions between predictors, contextual information is modeled even though the segmentation at any particular level may be incorrect. We note that while Fig. 1 illustrates a topdown sequence over the hierarchy, in practice, the authors iterate up and down the hierarchy which we also do in our comparison experiments."

Hence, interrupting the procedure before then would\nresult in final predictions over coarse regions that may severely undersegment the scene. Second, the amount of computation time at each step of the procedure is invariant to the current performance. Because the structure of the sequence is predefined, the inference procedure will predict multiple times on a region as it traverses over the hierarchy, even though there may be no room for improvement. Third, the input to each predictor in the sequence is a fixed feature descriptor for the region. Because these input descriptors must be precomputed for all regions in the hierarchy before the inference process begins, there is a fixed initial computational cost.

By using a hierarchical segmentation of the scene that produces many segments/regions, we can consider each resulting region or segment of pixels S in the hierarchy as one possible set of outputs to update. Intuitively, there is no need to update regions of the image where the predictions are correct at the current inference step. Hence, we want to update the portion of the scene where the predictions are uncertain, i.e., have high entropy H. To achieve this, we use a selector function that selects\nregions that have high average per-pixel entropies in the current predictions,\nhS(x, ŷ) = S ∣∣∣∣∣∣ 1|S| ∑ j∈S H(q(ŷ)j) > θ  , (20) for some fixed threshold θ. In practice, the set of predictors HS used at training time is created from a diverse set of thresholds θ.\nAdditionally, we assume that the features ψj used for each pixel in a given selected region are drawn from the entire region, so that if a given scale is selected features corresponding to that scale are used to update the selected pixels. For a given segment S, call this feature vector ψS .\nGiven the above selector function, we use (Eq. 14) to find the next best predictor function, as in Algorithm 1, optimizing\nh∗P = arg min hP ∑ S∈hS(x,ŷ) ∑ j∈S ‖∇(x)j − hP(ψS)‖2.

To this end, we utilize the SpeedBoost cost model (Eq. 13) to automatically select the most computationally efficient features.\nThe features used in this application, drawn from previous work [11, 16] and detailed in the following section, are computed as follows. First, a set of base feature descriptors are computed from the input image data. In many applications it is useful to quantize these base feature descriptors and pool them together to form a set of derived features [2]. We follow the soft vector quantization approach in [2] to form a quantized code vector by computing distances to multiple cluster centers in a dictionary.\nThis computation incurs a fixed cost for 1) each group of features with a common base feature, and 2) an additional, smaller fixed cost for each actual feature used. In order to account for these costs, we use an additive model similar to Xu et al. [29]. Formally, let φ ∈ Φ be the set of features and γ ∈ Γ be the set of feature groups, and cφ and cγ be the cost for computing derived feature φ and the base feature for group γ, respectively. Let Φ(f) be the set of features used by predictor f and Γ(f) the set of its used groups. Given a current predictor ft−1, its group and derived feature costs are then just the costs of any new group and derived features and have not previously been computed:\ncΓ(hP) = ∑\nγ∈Γ(hP)\\Γ(ft−1)\ncγ , (23)\ncΦ(hP) = ∑\nφ∈Φ(hP)\\Φ(ft−1)\ncφ.

This approach augments the least-squares regression tree impurity function with a cost\nregularizer:\nED [ wD‖yD − hP(xD)‖2 ] + λ (cΓ(hP) + cΦ(hP)) , (27)\nwhere λ regularizes the cost.

    "abstractText" : "Structured prediction plays a central role in machine learning applications from computational biology to computer vision. These models require significantly more computation than unstructured models, and, in many applications, algorithms may need to make predictions within a computational budget or in an anytime fashion. In this work we propose an anytime technique for learning structured prediction that, at training time, incorporates both structural elements and feature computation trade-offs that affect test-time inference. We apply our technique to the challenging problem of scene understanding in computer vision and demonstrate efficient and anytime predictions that gradually improve towards state-of-the-art classification performance as the allotted time increases.",
