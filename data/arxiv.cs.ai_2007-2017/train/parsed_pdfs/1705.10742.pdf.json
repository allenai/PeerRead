      "text" : "The business model behind modern communication systems (email services or messaging services provided by social networks) is incompatible with end-to-end message encryption. The providers of these services can afford to offer them free of charge because most of their users agree to receive “targeted ads” (ads that are especially chosen to appeal to each user, based on the needs the user has implied through their messages). This model works as long as users communicate mostly in the clear, which enables service providers to make informed guesses about user needs.\nThis situation does not prevent users from encrypting a few sensitive messages, but it does take away some of the benefits of confidentiality. For instance, imagine a scenario where two users want to exchange forbidden ideas or organize forbidden events under an authoritarian regime; in a world where most communication happens in the clear, encrypting a small fraction of messages automatically makes these messages—and the users who exchange them—suspicious.\nWith this motivation in mind, we want to design a system that enables two users to exchange encrypted messages, such that a passive adversary that reads the messages can determine neither the original content of the messages nor the fact that the messages are encrypted.\nWe build on linguistic steganography, i.e., the science of encoding a secret piece of information (“payload”) into a piece of text that looks like natural language (“stegotext”). We propose a novel stegosystem, based on a neural network, and demonstrate that it combines high quality of output (i.e., the stegotext indeed looks like natural language) with the highest capacity (number of bits encrypted per word) published in literature.\nIn the rest of the paper, we describe existing linguistic stegosystems along with ours (§2), provide details on our system (§3), present preliminary experimental results on Twitter and email messages (§4), and conclude with future directions (§5)."

      "text" : "Traditional linguistic stegosystems are based on modification of an existing cover text, e.g., using synonym substitution (Topkara et al., 2006; Chang and Clark, 2014) and/or paraphrase substitution (Chang and Clark, 2010). The idea is to encode the secret information in the transformation of the cover text, ideally without affecting its meaning or grammatical correctness. Of these systems, the most closely related to ours is CoverTweet (Wilson et al., 2014), a state-of-theart cover modification stegosystem that uses Twitter as the medium of cover; we compare to it in our preliminary evaluation (§4).\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n10 74\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n3 0\nM ay\n2 01\n7\nCover modification can introduce syntactic and semantic unnaturalness (Grosvald and Orgun, 2011); to address this, Grovsald and Orgun proposed an alternative stegosystem where a human generates the stegotext manually, thus improving linguistic naturalness at the cost of human effort (Grosvald and Orgun, 2011).\nMatryoshka (Safaka et al., 2016) takes this further: in step 1, it generates candidate stegotext automatically based on an n-gram model of the English language; in step 2, it presents the candidate stegotext to the human user for polishing, i.e., ideally small edits that improve linguistic naturalness. However, the cost of human effort is still high, because the (automatically generated) candidate stegotext is far from natural language, and, as a result, the human user has to spend significant time and effort manually editing and augmenting it.\nVolkhonskiy et al. have applied Generative Adversarial Networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) to image steganography (Volkhonskiy et al., 2017), but we are not aware of any text stegosystem based on neural networks."

      "heading" : "2.2 Our Proposal: Steganographic LSTM",
      "text" : "Motivated by the fact that LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) constitute the state of the art in text generation (Jozefowicz et al., 2016), we propose to automatically generate the stegotext from an LSTM (as opposed to an n-gram model). The output of the LSTM can then be used either directly as the stegotext, or Matryoshka-style, i.e., as a candidate stegotext to be polished by a human user; in this paper, we explore only the former option, i.e., we do not do any manual polishing. We describe the main components of our system in the paragraphs below; for reference, Fig. 1 outlines the building blocks of a stegosystem (Salomon, 2003).\nSecret data. The secret data is the information we want to hide. First, we compress and/or encrypt the secret data (e.g., in the simplest set-\nting using the ASCII coding map) into a secretcontaining bit string S. Second, we divide S into smaller bit blocks of length |B|, resulting in a total of |S|/|B|1 bit blocks. For example, if S = 100001 and |B| = 2, our bit-block sequence is 10, 00, 01. Based on this bit-block sequence, our steganographic LSTM generates words.\nKey. The sender and receiver share a key that maps bit blocks to token sets and is constructed as follows: We start from the vocabulary, which is the set of all possible tokens that may appear in the stegotext; the tokens are typically words, but may also be punctuation marks. We partition the vocabulary into 2|B| bins, i.e., disjoint token sets, randomly selected from the vocabulary without replacement; each token appears in exactly one bin, and each bin contains |V |/2|B| tokens. We map each bit block B to a bin, denoted by WB . This mapping constitutes the shared key.\nEmbedding algorithm. The embedding algorithm uses a modified word-level LSTM for language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2010). To encode the secret-containing bit string S, we consider one bit block B at a time and have our LSTM select one token from bin WB; hence, the candidate stegotext has as many tokens as the number of bit blocks in S. Even though we restrict the LSTM to select a token from a particular bin, each bin should offer sufficient variety of tokens, allowing the LSTM to generate text that looks natural. For example, given the bit string “1000011011” and the key in Table 1, the LSTM can form the partial sentence in Table 2. We describe our LSTM model in more detail in the next section.\n1If |B|6 | |S|, then we leave the remainder bit string out of encryption.\nDecoder. The decoder recovers the original data deterministically and in a straightforward manner: it takes as input the generated stegotext, considers one token at a time, finds the token’s bin in the shared key, and recovers the original bit block.\nCommon-token variant. We also explore a variant where we add a set of common tokens, C, to all bins. These common tokens do not carry any secret information; they serve only to enhance stegotext naturalness. When the LSTM selects a common token from a bin, we have it select an extra token from the same bin, until it selects a noncommon token. The decoder removes all common tokens before decoding. We discuss the choice of common tokens and its implication on our system’s performance in Section 4."

Classic LSTMs generate words as follows (Sutskever et al., 2011): Given a word sequence (x1, x2, . . . , xT ), the model has hidden states (h1, . . . , hT ), and resulting output vectors (o1, . . . , oT ). Each output vector ot has length |V |, and each output-vector element o(j)t is the unnormalized probability of word j in the vocabulary. Normalized probabilities for each candidate word are obtained by the following softmax activation function:\nsoftmax(ot)j := exp(o (j) t ) /∑ k exp(o (k) t ).\nThe LSTM then selects the word with the highest probability P [xt+1 |x≤t] as its next word.\nText generation in our LSTM. In our steganographic LSTM, word selection is restricted by the shared key. That is, given bit block B, the LSTM has to select its next word from bin WB . We set P [x = wj ] = 0 for j /∈ WB , so that the multinomial softmax function selects the word with the highest probability within WB .\nCommon tokens. In the common-token variant, we restrict P [x = wj ] = 0 only for j /∈ (WB∪C), where C is the set of common tokens added to all bins."

      "heading" : "3.2 Evaluation Metrics",
      "text" : "We use perplexity to quantify stegotext quality; and capacity (i.e., encrypted bits per output word) to quantify its efficiency in carrying secret information. In Section 4, we also discuss our stegotext quality as empirically perceived by us as human readers.\nPerplexity. Perplexity is a standard metric for the quality of language models (Martin and Jurafsky, 2000), and it is defined as the average per-word log-probability on the valid data set: exp(−1/N ∑ i ln p[wi]) (Jozefowicz et al., 2016). Lower perplexity indicates a better model. In our steganographic LSTM, we cannot use this metric as is: since we enforce p[wi] = 0 for wi /∈WB , the corresponding ln p[wi] becomes undefined under this vocabulary.\nInstead, we measure the probability of wi by taking the average of p[wi] over all possible secret bit blocks B, under the assumption that bit blocks are distributed uniformly. By the Law of Large Numbers (Révész, 2014), if we perform many stegotext-generating trials using different random secret data as input, the probability of each word will tend to the expected value, ∑ p[wi, B]/2\n|B|, Hence, we set p[wi] := ∑ p[wi, B]/2\n|B| instead of p[wi] = 0 for wi /∈WB .\nCapacity. Our system’s capacity is the number of encrypted bits per output word. Without common tokens, capacity is always |B| bits/word (since each bit block of size |B| is always mapped to one output word). In the common-token variant, capacity decreases because the output includes common tokens that do not carry any secret information; in particular, if the fraction of common tokens is p, then capacity is (1− p) · |B|."

We normalized the content by replacing usernames and URLs with a username token (<user>) and a URL token (<url>), respectively. We used 600 thousand tweets with a total of 45 million words and a vocabulary of size 225 thousand.\nFor Enron, we cleaned and extracted email message bodies (Zhou et al., 2007) from the Enron dataset, and we tokenized the messages into words and punctuation marks.

Model training was done on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X.\nFor Twitter, we used a 2-layer LSTM with 600 units, unrolled for 25 steps for back propagation. We clipped the norm of the gradients (Pascanu et al., 2013) at 0.25 and applied 20% dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014).

Table 3 shows the relationship between capacity (bits per word), and quantitative text quality (perplexity). It also compares models with and without adding common tokens using perplexity and bits per word.\nTable 4 shows example output texts of LSTMs with and without common tokens added. To reflect the variation in the quality of the tweets, we represent tweets that are good and poor in quality3.\nWe replaced <user> generated by the LSTM with mock usernames for a more realistic presentation in Table 4. In practice, we can replace the <user> tokens systematically, randomly selecting followers or followees of that tweet sender, for example.\nRe-tweet messages starting with “RT” can also be problematic, because it will be easy to check whether the original message of the retweeted message exists. A simple approach to deal with this is to eliminate “RT” messages from training (or at generation). Finally, since we made all tweets lower case in the pre-processing step, we can also post-process tweets to adhere to proper English capitalization rules."

Assuming 16.04 words per tweet5, our 4-bin system hides 32 bits per tweet, over 11 times higher than (Wilson and Ker, 2016).\nWe hypothesize that the subjective quality of our generated tweets will be comparable to tweets produced by CoverTweet (2014). We present some examples6 in Table 6 to show there is potential for a comparison. This contrasts the previous conception that cover generation methods are fatally weak against human judges (Wilson et al., 2014). CoverTweet was tested to be secure against human judges. Formal experiments will be necessary to establish that our system is also secure against human judges.\nOur system also offers flexibility for the user to freely trade-off capacity and text quality.

We presented our steganographic model based on existing language modeling LSTMs, and demonstrated that our model produces realistic tweets and emails while hiding information.\nIn comparison to the state-of-the-art steganographic systems, our system has the advantage of encoding much more information (around 2 bits per word). This advantage makes the system more usable and scalable in practice.\nIn future work, we will formally evaluate our system’s security against human judges and other steganography detection (steganalysis) methods (Wilson et al., 2015; Kodovsky et al., 2012). When evaluated against an automated classifier, the setup becomes that of a Generative Adversarial Network (Goodfellow et al., 2014), though with additional conditions for the generator (the secret bits) which are unknown to the discriminator, and not necessarily employing joint training. Another line of future research is to generate tweets which are personalized to a user type or interest group, instead of reflecting all twitter users. Furthermore, we plan to explore if capacity can be improved even more by using probabilistic encoders/decoders, as e.g. in Matryoshka (Safaka et al., 2016, Section 4).\nUltimately, we aim to open-source our stegosystem so that users of open communication systems (e.g. Twitter, emails) can use our stegosystem to communicate private and sensitive information."
