      "text" : "Natural Language Processing (NLP) models suffer considerably when applied in the wild. The distribution of the test data is typically very different from the data used during training, causing a model’s performance to deteriorate substantially. Domain adaptation is a prominent approach to transfer learning that can help to bridge this gap; many approaches were suggested so far (Blitzer et al., 2007; Daumé III, 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Ma et al., 2014; Schnabel and Schütze, 2014). However, most work focused on one-toone scenarios. Only recently research considered using multiple sources. Such studies are rare and typically rely on specific model transfer approaches (Mansour, 2009; Wu and Huang, 2016).\nInspired by work on curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009; Tsvetkov et al., 2016), we instead propose—to the best of our knowledge—the first model-agnostic data selection approach to trans-\nfer learning. Contrary to curriculum learning that aims at speeding up learning (see §6), we aim at learning to select the most relevant data from multiple sources using data metrics. While several measures have been proposed in the past (Moore and Lewis, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011; Van Asch and Daelemans, 2010; Plank and van Noord, 2011; Remus, 2012), prior work is limited in studying metrics mostly in isolation, using only the notion of similarity (Ben-David et al., 2007) and focusing on a single task (see §6). Our hypothesis is that different tasks or even different domains demand different notions of similarity. In this paper we go beyond prior work by i) studying a range of similarity metrics, including diversity; and ii) testing the robustness of the learned weights across models (e.g., whether a more complex model can be approximated with a simpler surrogate), domains and tasks (to delimit the transferability of the learned weights).\nThe contributions of this work are threefold. First, we present the first model-independent approach to learn a data selection measure for transfer learning. It outperforms baselines across three tasks and multiple domains and is competitive with state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches. Second, prior work on transfer learning mostly focused on similarity. We demonstrate empirically that diversity is as important as— and complements—domain similarity for transfer learning. Finally, we show—for the first time— to what degree learned measures transfer across models, domains and tasks."

      "text" : "Transfer learning generally involves the concepts of a domain and a task (Pan and Yang, 2010). A domain D consists of a feature space X and a marginal probability distribution P (X) over X ,\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n05 24\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n7 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nwhere X = {x1, · · · , xn} ∈ X . For document classification with a bag-of-words, X is the space of all document vectors, xi is the i-th document vector, and X is a sample of documents.\nGiven a domainD = {X , P (X)}, a task T consists of a label space Y and a conditional probability distribution P (Y |X) that is typically learned from training data consisting of pairs {xi, yi}, where xi ∈ X and yi ∈ Y .\nFinally, given a source domain DS , a corresponding source task TS , as well as a target domain DT and a target task TT , transfer learning seeks to facilitate the learning of the target conditional probability distribution P (YT |XT ) in DT with the information gained from DS and TS where DS 6= DT or TS 6= TT . We will focus on the scenario where DS 6= DT assuming that TS = TT , commonly referred to as domain adaptation. We investigate transfer across tasks in §5.3.\nExisting research in domain adaptation has generally focused on the scenario of one-to-one adaptation: Given a set of source domains A and a set of target domains B, a model is evaluated based on its ability to adapt between all pairs (a, b) in the Cartesian product A×B where a ∈ A and b ∈ B (Remus, 2012). However, adaptation between two dissimilar domains is often undesirable, as it may lead to negative transfer (Rosenstein et al., 2005). Only recently, many-to-one adaptation (Mansour, 2009; Wu and Huang, 2016) has received some attention, as it replicates the realistic scenario of multiple source domains where performance on the target domain is the foremost objective."

While this has been shown to work empirically (Moore and Lewis, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011; Plank and van Noord, 2011; Van Asch and Daelemans, 2010; Remus, 2012), using a pre-existing metric leaves us unable to adapt to the characteristics of our task T and target domain DT and foregoes additional knowledge that may be gleaned from the interaction of different metrics. For this reason, we propose to learn the following linear domain similarity measure S as a linear combina-\ntion of feature values:\nS = φ(X) · wᵀ (1)\nwhere φ(X) ∈ Rn×l are the similarity and diversity features further described in §3.2 for each training example, with l being the number of features, while w ∈ Rl are the weights learned by Bayesian Optimization.\nWe aim to learn weights w in order to optimize the objective function J of the respective task T on a small number of validation examples of the corresponding target domain DT ."

      "text" : "As the learned measure S should be agnostic of the particular objective function J , we cannot use gradient-based methods for optimization. Similar to Tsvetkov et al. (2016), we use Bayesian Optimization (Brochu et al., 2010), which has emerged as an efficient framework to optimize any function. For instance, it has repeatedly found better settings of neural network hyperparameters than domain experts (Snoek et al., 2012).\nGiven a black-box function f : X → R, Bayesian Optimization aims to find an input x̂ ∈ argminx∈X f(x) that globally minimizes f . For this, it requires a prior p(f) over the function and an acquisition function ap(f) : X → R that calculates the utility of any evaluation at any x.\nBayesian Optimization then proceeds iteratively. At iteration t, 1) it finds the most promising input xt ∈ argmax ap(x) through numerical optimization; 2) it then evaluates the surrogate function yt ∼ f(xt)+N (0, σ2) on this input and adds the resulting data point (xt, yt) to the set of observations Ot−1 = (xj , yj)j=1...t−1; 3) finally, it updates the prior p(f |Ot) and the acquisition function ap(f |Ot).\nFor data selection, the black-box function f looks as follows: 1) It takes as input a set of weights w that should be evaluated; 2) the training examples of all source domains are then scored and sorted according to Equation 1; 3) the model for the respective task T is trained on the top n samples; 4) the model is evaluated on the validation set according to the evaluation measure J and the value of J is returned.\nGaussian Processes (GP) are a popular choice for p(f) due to their descriptive power (Rasmussen, 2006). We use GP with Monte Carlo acquistion and Expected Improvement (EI)\n(Močkus, 1974) as acquisition function as this combination has been shown to outperform comparable approaches (Snoek et al., 2012).1"

      "text" : "Existing work on data selection for domain adaptation selects data based on its similarity to the target domain. Several measures have been proposed in the literature (Van Asch and Daelemans, 2010; Plank and van Noord, 2011; Remus, 2012), but were so far only used in isolation.\nOnly selecting training instances with respect to the target domain also fails to account for instances that are richer and better suited for knowledge acquisition. For this reason, we consider—to our knowledge for the first time—whether intrinsic qualities of the training data accounting for diversity are of use for domain adaptation in NLP.\nSimilarity We use a range of similarity metrics. Some metrics might be better suited for some tasks, while different measures might capture complementary information. We thus use the following measures as features for learning a more effective domain similarity metric.\nWe define similarity features over probability distributions in accordance with existing literature (Plank and van Noord, 2011). Let P be the representation of a source training example, while Q is the corresponding target domain representation. Let furtherM = 12(P +Q), i.e. the average distribution between P and Q and let DKL(P ||Q) =∑n\ni=1 pi log pi qi , i.e., the KL divergence between the two domains. We do not use DKL as a feature as it is undefined for distributions where some event qi ∈ Q has probability 0, which is common for term distributions. Our features are:\n• Jensen-Shannon divergence (Lin, 1991): 1 2 [DKL(P ||M) + DKL(Q||M)]. JensenShannon divergence is a smoothed, symmetric variant of DKL that has been successfully used for domain adaptation (Plank and van Noord, 2011; Remus, 2012). • Rényi divergence (Rényi, 1961):\n1 α−1 log( ∑n i=1\npαi qα−1i ). Rényi divergence re-\nduces to DKL if α = 1. We set α = 0.99 following Van Asch and Daelemans (2010).\n1We also experimented with FABOLAS (Klein et al., 2017), but found its ability to adjust the training set size during optimization to be inconclusive for our relatively small training sets.\n• Bhattacharyya distance (Bhattacharya, 1943): ln( ∑ i √ PiQi) • Cosine similarity (Lee, 2001): P ·Q‖P‖ ‖Q‖ . We can treat the distributions alternatively as vectors and consider geometrically motivated distance functions such as cosine similarity as well as the following. • Euclidean distance (Lee, 2001):√∑ i(Pi −Qi)2. • Variational dist. (Lee, 2001): ∑ i |Pi −Qi|.\nWe consider three different representations for calculating the above domain similarity measures:\n• Term distributions (Plank and van Noord, 2011): t ∈ R|V | where ti is the probability of the i-th word in the vocabulary V . • Topic distributions (Plank and van Noord,\n2011): t ∈ Rn where ti is the probability of the i-th topic as determined by an LDA model (Blei et al., 2003) trained on the data and n is the number of topics. • Word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013):\n1 n ∑ i vwi √ a p(wi) where n is the number of words with embeddings in the document, vwi is the pre-trained embedding of the i-th word, p(wi) its probability, and a is a smoothing factor used to discount frequent probabilities. A similar weighted sum has recently been shown to outperform supervised approaches for other tasks (Arora et al., 2017). As embeddings may be negative, we use them only with the latter three geometric features above.\nDiversity For each training example, we calculate its diversity based on the words in the example. Let pi and pj be probabilities of the word types ti and tj in the training data and cos(vti , vtj ) the cosine similarity between their word embeddings. We employ measures that have been used in the past for measuring diversity (Tsvetkov et al., 2016):\n• Number of word types: #types. • Type-token ratio: #types#tokens . • Entropy (Shannon, 1948): − ∑ i pi ln(pi).\n• Simpson’s index (Simpson, 1949): − ∑\ni p 2 i .\n• Rényi entropy (Rényi, 1961): 1 α−1 log( ∑ i p α i ) • Quadratic entropy (Rao, 1982):∑ i,j cos(vti , vtj )pipj ."

We use the n examples with the highest score as determined by the learned data selection measure for training our models.2 We show statistics for all datasets in Table 1.\nSentiment Analysis For sentiment analysis, we evaluate on the Amazon reviews dataset (Blitzer et al., 2006). We use tf-idf-weighted unigram and bigram features and a linear SVM classifier (Blitzer et al., 2007). We set the vocabulary size to 10,000 and the number of training examples n = 1600 to conform with existing approaches (Bollegala et al., 2011) and stratify the training set.\nPOS tagging For POS tagging and parsing, we evaluate on the coarse-grained POS data (12 universal POS) of the SANCL 2012 shared task (Petrov and McDonald, 2012). Each domain— except for WSJ—contains around 2000-5000 labeled sentences and more than 100,000 unlabeled sentences. In the case of WSJ, we use its dev and test data as labeled samples and treat the remaining sections as unlabeled. We set n = 2000 for POS tagging and parsing to retain enough examples for the most-similar-domain baseline.\nTo evaluate the impact of model choice, we compare two models: a Structured Perceptron (inhouse implementation with commonly used features pertaining to tags, words, case, prefixes, as well as prefixes and suffixes) trained for 5 iterations with a learning rate of 0.2; and a state-of-theart Bi-LSTM tagger (Plank et al., 2016) with word and character embeddings as input. We perform early stopping on the validation set with patience of 2 and use otherwise default hyperparameters3 as provided by the authors.\nParsing For parsing, we evaluate the state-ofthe-art Bi-LSTM parser by Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016) with default hyperparameters.4 We use the same domains as used for POS tagging, i.e., the dependency parsing data with gold POS as made available in the SANCL 2012 shared task.5\n2All code is available at https://github.com/ sebastianruder/learn-to-select-data.\n3https://github.com/bplank/bilstm-aux 4https://github.com/elikip/bist-parser 5We leave investigating the effect of the adapted taggers\non parsing for future work."

      "heading" : "5 Results",
      "text" : "Sentiment analysis We show results for sentiment analysis in Table 2. First of all, the baselines show that the sentiment review domains are clearly delimited. Adapting between two similar domains such as Book and DVD is more productive than adaptation between dissimilar domains,\ne.g. Books and Electronics, as shown in previous work (Blitzer et al., 2007). This explains the strong performance of the most-similar-domain baseline. In contrast, selecting individual examples based on a domain similarity measure performs only as good as chance. Thus, when domains are more clear-cut, selecting from the closest domain is a stronger baseline than selecting from the entire pool of source data.\nIf we learn a data selection measure using Bayesian Optimization, we are able to outperform the baselines with almost all feature sets. Performance gains are considerable for all domains with individual feature sets (term similarity, word embeddings similarity, diversity and topic similarity), except for Books were improvements for some single feature sets are smaller. Term distributions and topic distributions are the best-performing representations for calculating similarity, with term distributions performing slightly better across all domains. Combining term distribution-based and topic distributionbased features only provides marginal gains over the individual feature sets, demonstrating that most of the information is contained in the similarity features rather than the representations.\nDiversity features perform comparatively to the best similarity features and outperform them on two domains. Furthermore, the combination of diversity and similarity features yields another sizable gain of around 1 percentage point for almost all domains over the best similarity features, which shows that diversity and similarity features capture complementary information. Term distribution and topic distribution-based similarity features in\nconjunction with diversity features finally yield the best performance, outperforming the baselines by 2-6 points in absolute accuracy.\nFinally, we compare data selection to training on all available source data (in this setup, 6,000 instances). The result complements the findings of the most-similar baseline: as domains are dissimilar, training on all available sources is detrimental.\nPOS tagging Results for POS tagging are given in Table 3. Using Bayesian Optimization, we are able to outperform the baselines with almost all feature sets, except for a few cases (e.g., diver-\nsity and word embeddings similarity, topic and term distributions). Overall term distributionbased similarity emerges as the most powerful individual feature. Combining it with diversity does not prove as beneficial as in the sentiment analysis case, however, often yields the second-best results.\nNotice that for POS tagging/parsing, in contrast to sentiment analysis, the most-similar domain baseline is not effective, it often performs only as good as chance, or even hurts. In contrast, the baseline that selects instances (JS – examples) rather than a domain performs better. This makes sense as in SA topically closer domains express sentiment in more similar ways, while for POS tagging having more varied training instances is intuitively more beneficial. In fact, when inspecting the domain distribution of our approach, we find that the best SA model chooses more instances from the closest domain, while for POS tagging instances are more balanced across domains. This suggests that the Web treebank domains are less clear-cut. In fact, training a model on all sources, which is considerably more and varied data (in this setup, 14-17.5k training instances) is beneficial. This is in line with findings in machine translation (Mirkin and Besacier, 2014), which show that similarity-based selection works best if domains are very different. Results are thus less pronounced for POS tagging, and we leave experimenting with larger n for future work.\nTo gain some insight into the optimization procedure, Figure 1 shows the development accuracy for the Structured Perceptron for an example domain. The top-right and bottom graphs show the hypothesis space exploration of Bayesian Optimization for different single feature sets, while the\ntop-left graph displays the overall best dev accuracy for different features. We observe again that term similarity is among the best feature sets and results in a larger explored space (more variance), in contrast to the diversity features whose development accuracy increases less and results in an overall less explored space. Exploration plots for other features/models looks similar.\nParsing The results for parsing are given in Table 3. Diversity features are stronger than for POS tagging and outperform the baselines for all except the Reviews domain. Similarly to POS tagging, term distribution-based similarity as well as its combination with diversity features yield the best results across most domains."

In practice, a metric can be learned using a model that is cheap to evaluate and serves as proxy for a state-of-the-art model, in a way similar to uptraining (Petrov et al., 2010). For this, we employ the data selection features learned using the Structured Perceptron model for POS tagging and use them to select data for the Bi-LSTM tagger. The results in Table 4 indicate that cross-model transfer is indeed possible, with most transferred feature sets achieving similar results or even outperforming features learned with the Bi-LSTM. In particular, transferred diversity significantly outperforms its in-model equivalent. This is encouraging, as it allows to learn a data selection metric using less complex models."

Feature sets like Similarity or Diversity trained on Books outperform the strong JS – D baseline in all 6 cases, for Electronics and Kitchen in 4/6 cases (off-diagonals for box 2 and 3 in Table 5). In some cases, the transferred weights even outperform the data selection metric learned for the respective domain, such as on D->E with sim and sim+div features and by almost 2 pp on E->D.\nTransferred similarity+diversity features mostly achieve higher performance than other feature sets, but the higher number of parameters runs the risk of overfitting to the domain as can be observed with two instances of negative transfer with sim+div features.\nAs a reference, we also list the performance of the state-of-the-art multi-domain adaptation approach (Wu and Huang, 2016), which shows that task-independent data selection is in fact competitive with a task-specific, heuristic state-of-the-art domain adaptation approach. In fact our transferred similarity+diversity feature (E->D) outperforms the state-of-the-art (Wu and Huang, 2016) on DVD.

      "heading" : "6 Related work",
      "text" : "Most prior work on data selection for transfer learning focuses on phrase-based machine translation. Typically language models are leveraged via perplexity or cross-entropy scoring to select target data (Moore and Lewis, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011; Duh et al., 2013; Mirkin and Besacier, 2014). A recent study investigates data selection for neural machine translation (van der Wees et al., 2017). Perplexity was also used to select training data for dependency parsing (Søgaard, 2011), but has been found to be less suitable for tasks such as sentiment analysis (Ruder et al., 2017). In general, there are fewer studies on data selection for other tasks, e.g., constituent parsing (McClosky et al., 2010), dependency parsing (Plank and van Noord, 2011; Søgaard, 2011) and sentiment analysis (Remus, 2012). Work on predicting task accuracy is related, but can be seen as complementary (Ravi et al., 2008; Van Asch and Daelemans, 2010).\nMany domain similarity metrics have been proposed. Blitzer et al. (2007) show that proxy A distance can be used to measure the adaptability between two domains in order to determine examples for annotation. Van Asch and Daelemans (2010) find that Rényi divergence outperforms other metrics in predicting POS tagging accuracy, while Plank and van Noord (2011) observe that topic distribution-based representations with Jensen-Shannon divergence perform best for data selection for parsing. Remus (2012) apply JensenShannon divergence to select training examples for sentiment analysis. Finally, Wu and Huang (2016) propose a similarity metric based on a sentiment graph. We test previously explored similarity metrics and complement them with diversity.\nVery recently interest emerged in curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009). It is inspired by human active learning by providing easier examples at initial learning stages (e.g., by curriculum strategies such as growing vocabulary size). Curriculum learning employs a range of data metrics,\nbut aims at altering the order in which the entire training data is selected, rather than selecting data. In contrast to us, curriculum learning is mostly aimed at speeding up the learning, while we focus on learning metrics for transfer learning. Other related work in this direction include using Reinforcement Learning to learn what data to select during neural network training (Fan et al., 2017).\nThere is a long history of research in adaptive data selection, with early approaches grounded in information theory using a Bayesian learning framework (MacKay, 1992). It has also been studied extensively as active learning (El-Gamal, 1991). Curriculum learning is related to active learning (Settles, 2012), whose view is different: active learning aims at finding the most difficult instances to label, examples typically close to the decision boundary. Confidence-based measures are prominent, but as such are less widely applicable than our model-agnostic approach.\nThe approach most similar to ours is by Tsvetkov et al. (2016) who use Bayesian Optimization to learn a curriculum for training word embeddings. Rather than ordering data (in their case, paragraphs), we use Bayesian Optimization for learning to select relevant training instances that are useful for transfer learning in order to prevent negative transfer (Rosenstein et al., 2005). To the best of our knowledge there is no prior work that uses this strategy for transfer learning."
