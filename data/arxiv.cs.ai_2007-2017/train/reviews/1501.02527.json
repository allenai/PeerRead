In this study, we specifically used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model on a dataset of Yelp reviews to classify restaurants based off of their reviews. Furthermore, we hypothesize that within a city, restaurants can be grouped into similar \"clusters\" based on both location and similarity. We used several different clustering methods, including K-means Clustering and a Probabilistic Mixture Model, in order to uncover and classify districts, both well-known and hidden (i.e. cultural areas like Chinatown or hearsay like \"the best street for Italian restaurants\") within a city. We use these models to display and label different clusters on a map. We also introduce a topic similarity heatmap that displays the similarity distribution in a city to a new restaurant.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 03:10:01 GMT  (8884kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02527v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["harini suresh", "nicholas locascio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.02527"}
