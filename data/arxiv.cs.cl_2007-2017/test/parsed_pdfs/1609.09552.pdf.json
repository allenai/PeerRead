      "text" : "Since its first use for machine translation (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), the encoder-decoder approach has demonstrated great success in many other sequence generation tasks including image caption generation (Vinyals et al., 2015b; Xu et al., 2015), parsing (Vinyals et al., 2015a), dialogue response generation (Li et al., 2016a; Serban et al., 2016) and sentence summarization (Rush et al., 2015; Chopra et al., 2016). In particular, in this paper we focus on sentence summarization, which as its name suggests, consists of generating shorter versions of sentences for applications such as document\n∗This work was done when the author was at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology.\n1Available at https://github.com/kiyukuta/lencon.\nsummarization (Nenkova and McKeown, 2011) or headline generation (Dorr et al., 2003). Recently, Rush et al. (2015) automatically constructed large training data for sentence summarization, and this has led to the rapid development of neural sentence summarization (NSS) or neural headline generation (NHG) models. There are already many studies that address this task (Nallapati et al., 2016; Ayana et al., 2016; Ranzato et al., 2015; Lopyrev, 2015; Gulcehre et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Chopra et al., 2016).\nOne of the essential properties that text summarization systems should have is the ability to generate a summary with the desired length. Desired lengths of summaries strongly depends on the scene of use, such as the granularity of information the user wants to understand, or the monitor size of the device the user has. The length also depends on the amount of information contained in the given source document. Hence, in the traditional setting of text summarization, both the source document and the desired length of the summary will be given as input to a summarization system. However, methods for controlling the output sequence length of encoderdecoder models have not been investigated yet, despite their importance in these settings.\nIn this paper, we propose and investigate four methods for controlling the output sequence length for neural encoder-decoder models. The former two methods are decoding-based; they receive the desired length during the decoding process, and the training process is the same as standard encoderdecoder models. The latter two methods are learning-based; we modify the network architecture to receive the desired length as input.\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n09 55\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\n0 Se\np 20\nIn experiments, we show that the learning-based methods outperform the decoding-based methods for long (such as 50 or 75 byte) summaries. We also find that despite this additional length-control capability, the proposed methods remain competitive to existing methods on standard settings of the DUC2004 shared task-1."

      "text" : "Text summarization is one of the oldest fields of study in natural language processing, and many summarization methods have focused specifically on sentence compression or headline generation. Traditional approaches to this task focus on word deletion using rule-based (Dorr et al., 2003; Zajic et al., 2004) or statistical (Woodsend et al., 2010; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2010; Filippova and Strube, 2008; Filippova and Altun, 2013; Filippova et al., 2015) methods. There are also several studies of abstractive sentence summarization using syntactic transduction (Cohn and Lapata, 2008; Napoles et al., 2011) or taking a phrase-based statistical machine translation approach (Banko et al., 2000; Wubben et al., 2012; Cohn and Lapata, 2013).\nRecent work has adopted techniques such as encoder-decoder (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014) and attentional (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015) neural network models from the field of machine translation, and tailored them to the sentence summarization task. Rush et al. (2015) were the first to pose sentence summarization as a new target task for neural sequence-to-sequence learning. Several studies have used this task as one of the benchmarks of their neural sequence transduction methods (Ranzato et al., 2015; Lopyrev, 2015; Ayana et al., 2016). Some studies address the other important phenomena frequently occurred in humanwritten summaries, such as copying from the source document (Gu et al., 2016; Gulcehre et al., 2016). Nallapati et al. (2016) investigate a way to solve many important problems capturing keywords, or inputting multiple sentences.\nNeural encoder-decoders can also be viewed as statistical language models conditioned on the target sentence context. Rosenfeld et al. (2001) have\nproposed whole-sentence language models that can consider features such as sentence length. However, as described in the introduction, to our knowledge, explicitly controlling length of output sequences in neural language models or encoder-decoders has not been investigated.\nFinally, there are some studies to modify the output sequence according some meta information such as the dialogue act (Wen et al., 2015), user personality (Li et al., 2016b), or politeness (Sennrich et al., 2016). However, these studies have not focused on length, the topic of this paper."

      "text" : "As we already mentioned in Section 1, the most standard setting in text summarization is to input both the source document and the desired length of the summary to a summarization system. Summarization systems thus must be able to generate summaries of various lengths. Obviously, this property is also essential for summarization methods based on neural encoder-decoder models.\nSince an encoder-decoder model is a completely data-driven approach, the output sequence length depends on the training data that the model is trained on. For example, we use sentence-summary pairs extracted from the Annotated English Gigaword corpus as training data (Rush et al., 2015), and the average length of human-written summary is 51.38 bytes. Figure 1 shows the statistics of the corpus. When we train a standard encoder-decoder model and perform the standard beam search decoding on the corpus, the average length of its output sequence is 38.02 byte.\nHowever, there are other situations where we want summaries with other lengths. For example, DUC2004 is a shared task where the maximum length of summaries is set to 75 bytes, and summarization systems would benefit from generating sentences up to this length limit.\nWhile recent NSS models themselves cannot control their output length, Rush et al. (2015) and others following use an ad-hoc method, in which the system is inhibited from generating the end-of-sentence (EOS) tag by assigning a score of−∞ to the tag and\nh t\nc t\nc t h t\nAttender\nmt\nst\nyt\ns̃t\n<s> yt 1\nh t\nc t\nc t h t\nAttender\nmt\nst\nyt\ns̃t\n<s> yt 1\nlength\nbc\nat at\nFigure 2: The encoder-decoder architecture we used as a base model in this paper.\ngenerating a fixed number of words2, and finally the output summaries are truncated to 75 bytes. Ideally, the models should be able to change the output sequence depending on the given output length, and to output the EOS tag at the appropriate time point in a natural manner."

Typically, this conditional probability is factorized as the product of conditional probabilities of the next word in the sequence:\np(y|x) = M∏ t=1 p(yt|y<t,x),\nwhere y<t = (y1, y2, y3, ..., yt−1).

During the encoding process, the BiRNN computes both forward hidden states ( −→ h 1, −→ h 2, ..., −→ hN ) and backward hidden states ( ←− h 1, ←− h 2, ..., ←− hN ) as follows:\n−→ h t = g( −→ h t−1, xt), ←− h t = g( ←− h t+1, xt).\nWhile g can be any kind of recurrent unit, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) networks that have memory cells for both directions (−→c t and←−c t).\nAfter encoding, we set the initial hidden states s0 and memory-cell m0 of the decoder as follows:\ns0 = ←− h 1, m0 = ←−c 1."

      "heading" : "4 Controlling Length in Encoder-decoders",
      "text" : "In this section, we propose our four methods that can control the length of the output in the encoderdecoder framework. In the first two methods, the decoding process is used to control the output length without changing the model itself. In the other two methods, the model itself has been changed and is trained to obtain the capability of controlling the length. Following the evaluation dataset used in our experiments, we use bytes as the unit of length, although our models can use either words or bytes as necessary.\n4.1 fixLen: Beam Search without EOS Tags\nThe first method we examine is a decoding approach similar to the one taken in many recent NSS methods that is slightly less ad-hoc. In this method, we inhibit the decoder from generating the EOS tag by assigning it a score of −∞. Since the model cannot stop the decoding process by itself, we simply stop the decoding process when the length of output sequence reaches the desired length. More specifically, during beam search, when the length of the sequence generated so far exceeds the desired length, the last word is replaced with the EOS tag and also the score of the last word is replaced with the score of the EOS tag (EOS replacement).\n4.2 fixRng: Discarding Out-of-range Sequences\nOur second decoding method is based on discarding out-of-range sequences, and is not inhibited from generating the EOS tag, allowing it to decide when to stop generation. Instead, we define the legitimate range of the sequence by setting minimum and maximum lengths. Specifically, in addition to the normal beam search procedure, we set two rules:\n• If the model generates the EOS tag when the output sequence is shorter than the minimum length, we discard the sequence from the beam.\n• If the generated sequence exceeds the maximum length, we also discard the sequence from the beam. We then replace its last word with the EOS tag and add this sequence to the beam\n(EOS replacement in Section 4.1).3\nIn other words, we keep only the sequences that contain the EOS tag and are in the defined length range. This method is a compromise that allows the model some flexibility to plan the generated sequences, but only within a certain acceptable length range.\nIt should be noted that this method needs a larger beam size if the desired length is very different from the average summary length in the training data, as it will need to preserve hypotheses that have the desired length.\n4.3 LenEmb: Length Embedding as Additional Input for the LSTM\nOur third method is a learning-based method specifically trained to control the length of the output sequence. Inspired by previous work that has demonstrated that additional inputs to decoder models can effectively control the characteristics of the output (Wen et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016b), this model provides information about the length in the form of an additional input to the net. Specifically, the model uses an embedding e2(lt) ∈ RD for each potential desired length, which is parameterized by a length embedding matrix Wle ∈ RD×L where L is the number of length types. In the decoding process, we input the embedding of the remaining length lt as additional input to the LSTM (Figure 3). lt is initialized after the encoding process and updated during the decoding process as follows:\nl1 = length,\nlt+1 = { 0 (lt − byte(yt) ≤ 0) lt − byte(yt) (otherwise),\nwhere byte(yt) is the length of output word yt and length is the desired length. We learn the values of the length embedding matrix Wle during training. This method provides additional information about the amount of length remaining in the output sequence, allowing the decoder to “plan” its output based on the remaining number of words it can generate.\n3This is a workaround to prevent the situation in which all sequences are discarded from a beam.\nh t\nc t\nc t h t\nAttender\nmt\nst\nyt\ns̃t\n<s> yt 1\nh t\nc t\nc t h t\nAttender\nmt\nst\nyt\ns̃t\n<s> yt 1\nlength\nbc\nat at\nFigure 4: LenInit: initial state of the decoder’s memory cell m0 manages output length.\n4.4 LenInit: Length-based Memory Cell Initialization\nWhileLenEmb inputs the remaining length lt to the decoder at each step of the decoding process, the LenInit method inputs the desired length once at the initial state of the decoder. Figure 4 shows the architecture of LenInit. Specifically, the model uses the memory cell mt to control the output length by initializing the states of decoder (hidden state s0 and memory cell m0) as follows:\ns0 = ←− h 1,\nm0 = bc ∗ length, (1)\nwhere bc ∈ RH is a trainable parameter and length is the desired length.\nWhile the model of LenEmb is guided towards the appropriate output length by inputting the remaining length at each step, this LenInit attempts to provide the model with the ability to manage the output length on its own using its inner state. Specifically, the memory cell of LSTM networks is suitable for this endeavour, as it is possible for LSTMs\nto learn functions that, for example, subtract a fixed amount from a particular memory cell every time they output a word. Although other ways for managing the length are also possible,4 we found this approach to be both simple and effective."

In this task, summarization systems are required to create a very short summary for each given document. Summaries over the length limit (75 bytes) will be truncated and there is no bonus for creating a shorter summary.

Hence, when we calculate the scores of LenEmb and LenInit, we impose a hard constraint on length to make the comparison fair (i.e. LenEmb(0,L) and LenInit(0,L) in the table). Specifically, we use the same beam search as that for fixRng with minimum length of 0.\nFor the purpose of showing the length control capability of LenEmb and LenInit, we show at the bottom two lines the results of the standard beam search without the hard constraints on the length6. We will use the results of LenEmb(0,∞) and LenInit(0,∞) in the discussions in Sections 6.2 and 6.3.\nThe results show that the learning-based meth-\n6 fixRng is equivalence to the standard beam search when we set the range as (0,∞).\nods (LenEmb and LenInit) tend to outperform decoding-based methods (fixLen and fixRng) for the longer summaries of 50 and 75 bytes.

However, previous work has not investigated situations in which we would like to control the length of encoder-decoder outputs. This capability is crucial for applications such as text summarization, in which we have to generate concise summaries with a desired length. In this paper, we propose methods for controlling the output sequence length for neural encoder-decoder models: two decoding-based methods and two learning-based methods.1 Results show that our learning-based methods have the capability to control length without degrading summary quality in a summarization task.",
