Despite that treebanks may belong to different languages or have different annotation schemes, they contain syntactic knowledge that is potential to benefit each other. This paper presents an universal framework for exploiting these multi-typed treebanks to improve parsing with deep multitask learning. We consider two kinds of treebanks as source: the multilingual universal treebanks and the monolingual heterogeneous treebanks. Multiple treebanks are trained jointly and interacted with multi-level parameter sharing. Experiments on several benchmark datasets in various languages demonstrate that our approach can make effective use of arbitrary source treebanks to improve target parsing models."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "As a long-standing central problem in natural language processing (NLP), dependency parsing has been dominated by data-driven approaches with supervised learning for decades. The foundation of data-driven parsing is the availability and scale of annotated training data (i.e., treebanks). Numerous efforts have been made towards the construction of treebanks which established the benchmark research on dependency parsing, such as the widelyused Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993). However, the heavy cost of treebanking typically limits the existing treebanks in both scale and coverage of languages.\nTo address the problem, a variety of authors have proposed to exploit existing heterogeneous treebanks with different annotation schemes via grammar conversion (Niu et al., 2009), quasisynchronous grammar features (Li et al., 2012) or shared feature representations (Johansson, 2013) for the enhancement of parsing models. Despite their effectiveness in specific datasets, these methods typically require manually designed rules or features, and in most cases, they are limited to the data resources that can be used. Furthermore, for the majority of world languages, such heterogeneous treebanks are not even available. In these cases, crosslingual treebanks may lend a helping hand.\nIn this paper, we aim at developing an universal framework that can exploit multi-typed source treebanks to improve parsing of a target treebank. Specifically, we will consider two kinds of source treebanks, that are multilingual universal treebanks and monolingual heterogeneous treebanks.\nCross-lingual supervision has proven highly beneficial for low-resource language parsing (Hwa et al., 2005; McDonald et al., 2011), implying that different languages have a great deal of common ground in grammars. But unfortunately, linguistic inconsistencies also exist in both typologies and lexical representations across languages. Figure 1(a) illustrates two sentences in German and English with universal dependency annotations. The typological differences (subject-verb-object order) results in the opposite directions of the dobj arcs, while the rest arcs remain consistent.\nSimilar problems also come with monolingual heterogeneous treebanks. Figure 1(b) shows an En-\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 16\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\nJ un\n2 01\nglish sentence annotated with respectively the universal dependencies which are content-head and the CONLL dependencies which instead take the functional heads. Despite the structural divergences, these treebanks express the syntax of the same language, thereby sharing a large amount of common knowledge that can be effectively transferred.\nThe present paper proposes a simple and effective framework that aims at making full use of the consistencies while avoids suffering from the inconsistencies across treebanks. Our framework effectively ties together the deep neural parsing models with multi-task learning, using multi-level parameter sharing to control the information flow across tasks. More specifically, learning with each treebank is maintained as an individual task, and their interactions are achieved through parameter sharing in different abstraction levels on the deep neural network, thus referred to as deep multi-task learning. We find that different parameter sharing strategies should be applied for different typed source treebanks adaptively, due to the different types of consistencies and inconsistencies (Figure 1).\nWe investigate the effect of multilingual treebanks as source using the Universal Dependency Treebanks (UDT) (McDonald et al., 2013). We show that our approach improves significantly over strong supervised baseline systems in six languages. We fur-\nther study the effect of monolingual heterogeneous treebanks as source using UDT and the CONLL-X shared task dataset (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006). We consider using UDT and CoNLL-X as source treebanks respectively, to investigate their mutual benefits. Experiment results show significant improvements under both settings. Moreover, indirect comparisons on the Chinese Penn Treebank 5.1 (CTB5) using the Chinese Dependency Treebank (CDT)1 as source treebank show the merits of our approach over previous work."

      "heading" : "2 Related Work",
      "text" : "The present work is related to several strands of previous studies.\nMonolingual resources for parsing. Exploiting heterogeneous treebanks for parsing has been explored in various ways. Niu et al. (2009) automatically convert the dependency-structure CDT into the phrase-structure style of CTB5 using a trained constituency parser on CTB5, and then combined the converted treebanks for constituency parsing. Li et al. (2012) capture the annotation inconsistencies among different treebanks by designing several types of transformation patterns, based on which they introduce quasi-synchronous grammar features (Smith and Eisner, 2009) to augment the baseline parsing models. Johansson (2013) also adopts the idea of parameter sharing to incorporate multiple treebanks. They focused on parameter sharing at feature-level with discrete representations, which limits its scalability to multilingual treebanks where feature surfaces might be totally different. On the contrary, our approach are capable of utilizing representation-level parameter sharing, making full use of the multi-level abstractive representations generated by deep neural network. This is the key that makes our framework scalable to multityped treebanks and thus more practically useful.\nAside from resource utilization, attempts have also been made to integrate different parsing models through stacking (Torres Martins et al., 2008; Nivre and McDonald, 2008) or joint inference (Zhang and Clark, 2008; Zhang et al., 2014).\nMultilingual resources for parsing. Crosslingual transfer has proven to be a promising way of\n1catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T05\ninducing parsers for low-resource languages, either through data transfer (Hwa et al., 2005; Tiedemann, 2014; Rasooli and Collins, 2015) or model transfer (McDonald et al., 2011; Täckström et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2015; Zhang and Barzilay, 2015).\nDuong et al. (2015b) and Ammar et al. (2016) both adopt parameter sharing to exploit multilingual treebanks in parsing, but with a few important differences to our work. In both of their models, most of the neural network parameters are shared in two (or multiple) parsers except the feature embeddings,2 which ignores the important syntactical inconsistencies of different languages and is also inapplicable for heterogeneous treebanks that have different transition actions. Besides, Duong et al. (2015b) focus on low resource parsing where the target language has a small treebank of ∼ 3K tokens. Their models may sacrifice accuracy on target languages with a large treebank. Ammar et al. (2016) instead train a single parser on a multilingual set of richresource treebanks, which is a more similar setting to ours. We refer to their approach as shallow multitask learning (SMTL) and will include as one of our baseline systems (Section 4.2). Note that SMTL is a special case of our approach in which all tasks use the same set of parameters.\nBilingual parallel data has also proven beneficial in various ways (Chen et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2009; Burkett and Klein, 2008), demonstrating the potential of cross-lingual transfer learning.\nMulti-task learning for NLP. There has been a line of research on joint modeling pipelined NLP tasks, such as word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing (Hatori et al., 2012; Li et al., 2011; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012). Most multi-task learning or joint training frameworks can be summarized as parameter sharing approaches proposed by Ando and Zhang (2005). In the context of neural models for NLP, the most notable work was proposed by Collobert and Weston (2008), which aims at solving multiple NLP tasks within one framework by sharing common word embeddings. Henderson et al. (2013) present a joint dependency parsing and semantic role labeling model with the Incremental Sigmoid Belief Networks (ISBN) (Henderson and Titov, 2010).\n2Duong et al. (2015b) used L2 regularizers to tie the lexical embeddings with a bilingual dictionary.\nMore recently, the idea of neural multi-task learning was applied to sequence-to-sequence problems with recurrent neural networks. Dong et al. (2015) use multiple decoders in neural machine translation systems that allows translating one source language to many target languages. Luong et al. (2015) study the ensemble of a wide range of tasks (e.g., syntactic parsing, machine translation, image caption, etc.) with multi-task sequence-to-sequence models.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we present the first work that successfully integrate both monolingual and multilingual treebanks for parsing, with or without consistent annotation schemes."

      "heading" : "3.1 Transition-based Neural Parsing",
      "text" : "Neural models for parsing have gained a lot of interests in recent years, particularly boosted by Chen and Manning (2014). The heart of transition-based parsing is the challenge of representing the state (configuration) of a transition system, based on which the most likely transition action is determined. Typically, a state includes three primary components, a stack, a buffer and a set of dependency arcs. Traditional parsing models deal with features extracted from manually defined feature templates in a discrete feature space, which suffers from the problems of Sparsity, Incompleteness and Expensive feature computation. The neural network model proposed by Chen and Manning (2014) instead represents features as continuous, low-dimensional vectors and use a cube activation function for implicit feature composition. More recently, this architecture has been improved in several different ways (Dyer et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015; Andor et al., 2016). Here, we employ the LSTM-based architecture enhanced with character bidirectional LSTMs (Ballesteros et\nal., 2015) for the following major reasons:\n• Compared with Chen & Manning’s architecture, it makes full use of the non-local features by modeling the full history information of a state with stack LSTMs.\n• By modeling words, stack, buffer and action sequence separately which indicate hierarchical abstractions of representations, we can control the information flow across tasks via parameter sharing with more flexibility (Section 3.2).\nBesides, we did not use the earlier ISBN parsing model (Titov and Henderson, 2007) due to its lack of scalability to large vocabulary. Figure 2 illustrates the transition-based parsing architecture using LSTMs. Bidirectional LSTMs are used for modeling the word representations (Figure 3), which we refer to as Char-BiLSTMs henceforth. CharBiLSTMs learn features for each word, and then the representation of each token can be calculated as:\nx = ReLU(V[Ð→w;←Ðw; t] + b) (1)\nwhere t is the POS tag embedding. The token embeddings are then fed into subsequent LSTM layers to obtain representations of the stack, buffer and action sequence respectively referred to as st,bt and\nat (The subscript t represents the time step). Note that the subtrees within the stack and buffer are modeled with a recursive neural network (RecNN) as described in Dyer et al. (2015). Next, a linear mapping (W) is applied to the concatenation of st,bt and at, and passed through a component-wise ReLU:\npt = ReLU(W[st;bt;at] + d) (2)\nFinally, the probability of next action z ∈ A(S,B) is estimated using a softmax function:\np(z∣pt) = exp(g⊺zpt + qz)\nΣz′∈A(S,B) exp(g⊺z′pt + qz′) (3)\nwhere A(S,B) represents the set of valid actions given the current content in the stack and buffer.\nWe apply the non-projective transition system originally introduced by Nivre (2009) since most of the treebanks we consider in this study has a noticeable proportion of non-projective trees. In the SWAP-based system, both the stack and buffer may contain tree fragments, so RecNN is applied both in S and B to obtain representations of each position."

      "text" : "Multi-task learning (MTL) is the procedure of inductive transfer that improves learning for one task by using the information contained in the training signals of other related tasks. It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation. A good overview, especially focusing on neural networks, can be found in Caruana (1997).\nWe illustrate our multi-task learning architecture in Figure 4. As discussed in previous sections, multiple treebanks, either multilingual or monolingual heterogeneous, contain knowledge that can be mutually beneficial. We consider the target treebank processing as the primary task, and the source treebank as a related task. The two tasks are interacted through multi-level parameter sharing (Section 3.2.1). Inspired by Ammar et al. (2016), we introduce a task-specific vector et (task embedding) which is first combined with st,bt,at to compute pt, and then further concatenated with pt to compute the probability distribution of transition actions.

The key of multi-task learning is parameter sharing, without which the correlation between tasks will not be exploited. Conventional multi-task learning models typically share a small proportion of parameters across tasks. For example, Collobert and Weston (2008) only shares word embeddings, and Dong et al. (2015) shares the encoder of sequence-to-sequence models. In this work, we use more sophisticated parameter sharing strategies according to the linguistic similarities and differences between the tasks."

      "text" : "Deep neural networks automatically learn features for a specific task with hierarchical abstractions, which gives us the flexibility to control parameter sharing in different levels accordingly.\nIn this study, different parameter sharing strategies are applied according to the source and target treebanks being used. We consider two different scenarios: MTL with multilingual universal treebanks as source (MULTI-UNIV) and MTL with monolingual heterogeneous treebanks as source (MONOHETERO). Table 1 presents our parameter sharing strategies for each setting.\nMULTI-UNIV MONO-HETERO\nShared LSTM(S) LSTM(B) RecNN WA,WS ,WB Epos,Erel,Eact LSTM(S) LSTM(B) BiLSTM(chars) RecNN WA,WS ,WB Epos,Echar\nTaskspecific LSTM(A) BiLSTM(chars) g Echar, e t LSTM(A) g Erel,Eact, e t\nTable 1: Parameter sharing strategies for MULTI-UNIV and MONO-HETERO.

Multilingual universal treebanks are annotated with the same set of POS tags (Petrov et al., 2012), dependency relations, and thus share the same set of transition actions. However, the vocabularies (word, characters) are language-specific. Additionally, linguistic typologies such as the order of subject-verb-object and adjective-noun (Figure 1(a)) also varies across languages, which result in the divergence of inherent grammars of transition actions. Therefore, it makes sense to share the lookup tables (embeddings) of POS tags (Epos), relations (Erel) and actions (Eact), but separate the character embeddings (Echar) as well as the CharBiLSTM (BiLSTM(chars)), and also the LSTM modeling action sequence (LSTM(A))\nMONO-HETERO. Monolingual heterogeneous treebanks instead share the same lexical representations, but have different POS tags, structures and relations (Figure 1(b)) due to the different annotation schemes. Hence the transition actions set varies across treebanks. For simplicity reasons, we convert the language-specific POS tags in the heterogeneous treebanks into universal POS tags (Petrov et al., 2012). Consequently, Echar and BiLSTM(chars), Epos are shared across tasks, but Erel, Eact, LSTM(A) are separated.\nBesides, the LSTM parameters for modeling the stack and buffer (LSTM(S), LSTM(B)), the RecNN for modeling tree compositions, and the weights from S, B, A to the state pt (WA,WB,WS) are shared for both MULTI-UNIV and MONO-HETERO.\nAs standard in multi-task learning, the weights at the output layer (g) are task-specific in both settings."

CAS yields slightly better performance than SUP, especially for SV (+1.52% UAS and +2.04% LAS), indicating that pre-training with EN training data indeed provides a better initialization of the parameters for cascaded training. SMTL in turn outperforms CAS overall (comparable for IT), which implies that training two treebanks jointly helps even with an unique model.\nFurthermore, with appropriate parameter sharing, our deep multi-task learning approach (MTL) outperforms SUP overall and achieves the best performances in five out of six languages. An exception is Swedish. As we can see, both CAS and SMTL outperforms MTL by a significant margin for SV. The underlying reasons we suggest are two-fold.\n1. SV morphology is similar to EN with less inflections, encouraging the morphology-related parameters like BiLSTM(chars) to be shared.\n2. SV has a much smaller treebank compared with EN (1:9). Intuitively, SMTL and CAS work better in low resource setting.\nTo verify the first issue, we conduct tests on SMTL without sharing Char-BiLSTMs. As shown in Table 4, the performance of SMTL decreases significantly (-0.73 in UAS). This observation also indicates that MTL has the potential to reach higher performances through language-specific tuning of parameter sharing strategies.\nTo verify the second issue, we consider a low resource setup following Duong et al. (2015b), where the target language has a small treebank (3K tokens). We train our models on identical sampled dataset\nshared by Duong et al. (2015b) on DE, ES and FR. As we can find in Table 5, while all the models outperform SUP, both CAS and SMTL work better than MTL, which confirms our assumption. Although not the primary focus of this work, we find that SMTL and MTL can be significantly improved in low resource setting through weighted sampling of tasks during training. Specifically, in the training procedure (Section 3.2.2), we sample from the source language (EN) which has a much richer treebank with larger probability of 0.9, while sample from the target language with probability of 0.1. In this way, the two tasks are encouraged to converge at a similar rate. As shown in Table 5, both SMTL and MTL benefit from weighted task sampling."

Despite that treebanks may belong to different languages or have different annotation schemes, they contain syntactic knowledge that is potential to benefit each other. This paper presents an universal framework for exploiting these multi-typed treebanks to improve parsing with deep multitask learning. We consider two kinds of treebanks as source: the multilingual universal treebanks and the monolingual heterogeneous treebanks. Multiple treebanks are trained jointly and interacted with multi-level parameter sharing. Experiments on several benchmark datasets in various languages demonstrate that our approach can make effective use of arbitrary source treebanks to improve target parsing models.",
