This paper focuses on IC (information content) computing methods and IC measures, which estimate the semantic similarities between concepts by exploiting the topological parameters of the taxonomy. Based on analyzing representative IC computing methods and typical semantic similarity measures, we propose a new hybrid IC computing method.

An experiment based on WordNet “is a” taxonomy has been designed to test representative measures and our measure on benchmark dataset R&G, and the results show that our measure can obviously improve the similarity accuracy. We evaluate the proposed approach by comparing the correlation coefficients between five measures (the proposed approach, four other similarity methods) and the artificial data.

The computation of concept semantic similarities is the fundamental for estimating textual semantic similarities because the concept is the smallest unit of semantic computing and the basis of information resource matching [2]. Utilizing the uniqueness of ontology concept and linguistic independence, polysemy and synonym of the concept can be effectively eliminated [3].\nWordNet and the Wikipedia Category Graph (WCG) are both reference ontology in the\ncomputation of concept semantic similarity. WordNet is a universal semantic lexicon and common ontology, which developed by the Cognitive Science Laboratory of Princeton University [4].

The WCG is the other resources in some works, including in works of Hadj Taieb et al. [5, 6] and Zesch [7]. The WCG is different from WordNet because it is proposed by volunteers, and the categories of WCG do not include specifying the type in semantic relations. In the paper, we adopt WordNet as the reference ontology [1].\nIn this paper, we propose a new comprehensive approach based on taxonomical parameters\nwhich are extracted from WordNet “is a” taxonomy, the taxonomical parameters including subsumer and implicating hyponyms, the depth ratio and the deepest common hypernym between the two concepts concerned by the semantic similarity task [1]. We utilize the proposed approach for computing the semantic similarities between words.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In part 2, we will analyze some related works,\nincluding typical semantic similarity measures and representative IC computing models. In part 3, we will improve existed IC model, propose our semantic similarity approach and apply this measure to benchmark dataset. In part 4, we will design an evaluation metrics to evaluate semantic similarity measures. In part 5, we will make an experiment to estimate the semantic similarities and compare the correlation coefficient of several similarity measures and artificial discrimination. In part 6, we will discuss the results of experiment and the contrast of the correlation. In part 7, we will take a conclusion to this paper and make a plan for future works. 2 Related works\nNowadays, some scholars at home and abroad have carried on extensive exploration and\nresearch on the concept similarity computation, and proposed many semantic similarity methods. Representative methods included IC-based measures, distance-based measures, feature-based measures and hybrid measures. The measure of IC-based computed concept similarity by examining the information content contained in the word pairs [8]. The measure of distance-based calculated concept similarity by the semantic distance (the number of edges linking two concepts) between words, and then transformed the distance into similarity value [9]. The measure of feature-based estimated the semantic similarities between words according to the structural feature of taxonomy, which included nodes and edges [10]. Hybrid measures computed the similarities between words by merging the advantages of other measures conceived [11].\nIn this paper, we focus on IC-based semantic similarity measures [12–15], which include two\nparts: computing IC method and IC-based similarity measures [10]."

Resnik proposed the equation as follows [12]:\nIC( c ) log( p( c ))  (1)\nHere, c is a concept node, and p(c) is the probability that \uD835\uDC50 appears in a given corpus. From equation (1), we can see that the more frequency of concept appeared, the less message of the concept transferred. Each term appeared in the corpus was counted as an occurrence rate of concept which included the term in ontology taxonomy. Then, Freq(c) is computed as follows:\nWord( c ) Freq( c ) Count( )      (2)\nHere, Word(c) is a set of words subsumed by c, and Count(ω) represents the frequency of the word ω appeared in the corpus.

They\ndiscovered that the IC of concept subsumed more child nodes was fewer and the IC of each of its leaf nodes was larger in a classification tree.

[18] proposed a new model, which adopted subsumers of leaf\nnode to calculate the value of IC. The equation was as follows:\nDavid\ncommonness( c ) IC ( c ) log\ncommonness( root )\n     \n  (5)\nWhere the function commonness(c) equals ∑commonness(n), and commonness(n) equals 1/subsumers(n).

In WordNet 3.0 each word was described by a set of concepts that express the possible meanings of the concerned word. The taxonomy “is-a” was mainly semantic relations and was used to compute the semantic similarity degree between words, which were more important in semantic computing. In WordNet 3.0, because noun reached the 75 percent, so our measure used the nominal “is a” taxonomies of WordNet in this paper.\nR&G dataset included 63 word pairs, which were judged by 51 professional people. We\nchose 30 word-pairs, and the range of similarity was from irrelevant to identity. According to the similarity degree between words, artificial scoring range was in [0.0-4.0].\nWe computed the semantic similarity in WordNet 3.0 by an accepted website, which includes\nJiang & Conrath’s, Resnik’s, Lin’s, Wu & Palmer’s, Leacock & Chodorow’s measures and so on [24]. Considering the situation that each word corresponds to a number of concepts in WordNet and R&G dataset only include words, so we need to transform seeking concept into seeking word. We assumed word w1 owns m concepts and w2 owns n concepts. When calculating the similarities of w1 and w2, we could get m×n similarity values. Wherein, we adopted the largest value of a word as the concept semantic similarity. We gave a specific model for seeking conceptual similarities as follows:\n1 2 1i 2 j ( i , j )\nsim( w ,w ) max[ sim( c ,c )] (16)\nHere, c1i is the concept of w1, and c2j is the concept of w2. 4.2 Evaluation metrics\nSeeking the correlation coefficient of similarity measure and artificial data is an important\nbench mark for evaluating similarity measure. We evaluated our approach by the equation (17) (two-sided 0.05 level Pearson correlation measurement) [6, 25]:\nn\ni ii 1 xy\nn 2 2 i ii 1\n( x x )( y y ) r\n( x x ) ( y y )\n\n\n  \n \n  (17)\nHere, X represents similarity value computed by a similarity measure in R&G and Y represents similarity value derived from artificial data in R&G, and Y is used in the benchmark data to evaluate similarity measures.

Similarly, (yi-y) is the difference between yi and mean of yi, and yi represents each term of set Y.

Testing results of Poisson correlation coefficient showed as follows:\nLeacock & Chodorow Measure 0.792\nOur Measure 0.823\nIn Table 2, Poisson correlation coefficient represents the correlation score between each machine generated measure and artificial data. 6 Discussions\nThere were four aspects of our work have to be addressed. Firstly, we rewrote the IC model\nwhich we took into account the taxonomy structure and information theory, and converted the old computing IC method (based ontology intrinsic structure) to a new hybrid computing IC method. Based on the new IC model, we proposed a novel semantic similarity approach, which computed the similarities between words based on the comprehensive factors instead of relying on the path and depth. In this similarity approach, we adopted the parameters lch and dhyp, which validated the estimation of semantic similarity degree between words.\nSecondly, the results of Table 1 show that our quantification approach owned better\nperformance than other methods in set of 30 term pairs of R&G dataset. This performance is very desirable because WordNet is a common ontology and the intrinsic IC models of ontology-based own better independence than domain corpora. In fact, the intrinsic IC models are efficient and easily applicable to different domains because the IC models of corpora-based are hampered by corpora used [1].\nThirdly, the parameter range is an important benchmark for the dispersion degree of\nmeasures. In Table 1, the last row showed that the range of our measure reachs 1.5380, and this meant that the dispersion degree of our measure is better than Wu & Palmer’s, Jiang & Conrath’s, Lin’s measures. The dispersion degree of our measure is lower than Leacock & Chodorow’s measure (W&P measure range=0.6923, L&C measure range=2.5652, Lin measure range=1.0000, J&C measure r=1.0000). This is due to the smallest similarity of word reached the 1.2040 in Leacock & Chodorow’s measure, but the smallest similarity of word equaled 0.2188 in proposed measure (Leacock & Chodorow measure “noon-string” =1.2040, our measure “autograph-shore” =0.2188).\nThe last point, based on evaluation metrics equation (17), if correlation score was bigger,\ntesting measure and artificial data are closer related. In Table 2, the measures based on path and depth owned good correlations than pure IC-based measures (W&P measure r=0.678, L&C measure r=0.792; Lin measure r=0.543, J&C measure r=0.389). When we introduced our hybrid IC model, the correlation coefficient of our measure reached 0.823. This means the fitting degree of our measure is better than others. 7 conclusion and future works\nIn this paper, our works included three aspects. Firstly, after analyzing representative IC\nmodels and typical semantic similarity measures, we proposed an improved computing IC model. Our model has been considered information theory and intrinsic ontology structure factors (hypernym, hyponym, depth, node number), which owned significant weight on computing accurately information content of concepts. Secondly, based on the improved IC model we put forward a new comprehensive measure for estimating concept semantic similarity. Thirdly, we\ntested our approach in set of 30 term pairs of R&G benchmark dataset and compared the correlation coefficient between existed measures, our measure and artificial data. The results showed our measure was effective. In future, we will improve the proposed approach by considering the more spatial structure of ontology and proof-test this approach in some widely datasets.

    "abstractText" : "Computation of semantic similarity between concepts is an important foundation for many research works. This paper focuses on IC (information content) computing methods and IC measures, which estimate the semantic similarities between concepts by exploiting the topological parameters of the taxonomy. Based on analyzing representative IC computing methods and typical semantic similarity measures, we propose a new hybrid IC computing method. Through adopting the parameter dhyp and lch, we utilize the new IC computing method and propose a novel comprehensive measure of semantic similarity between concepts. An experiment based on WordNet “is a” taxonomy has been designed to test representative measures and our measure on benchmark dataset R&G, and the results show that our measure can obviously improve the similarity accuracy. We evaluate the proposed approach by comparing the correlation coefficients between five measures (the proposed approach, four other similarity methods) and the artificial data. The results show that our proposal outperforms the previous measures.",
