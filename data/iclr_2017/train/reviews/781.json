{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Dynamic Partition Models", "abstract": "We present a new approach for learning compact and intuitive distributed representations with binary encoding. Rather than summing up expert votes as in products of experts, we employ for each variable the opinion of the most reliable expert. Data points are hence explained through a partitioning of the variables into expert supports. The partitions are dynamically adapted based on which experts are active. During the learning phase we adopt a smoothed version of this model that uses separate mixtures for each data dimension. In our experiments we achieve accurate reconstructions of high-dimensional data points with at most a dozen experts.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper proposes a new kind of expert model where a sparse subset of most reliable experts is chosen instead of the usual logarithmic opinion pool of a PoE.\nI find the paper very unclear.

I read all the responses provided by authors to reviewer's questions and re-read the paper again and I still do not fully understand the setting and thus can't really evaluate the contributions of these work. The related work section does not exist and instead the analysis of the literature is somehow scattered across the paper. There are no derivations provided.
