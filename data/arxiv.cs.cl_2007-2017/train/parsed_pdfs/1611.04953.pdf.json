      "text" : "Recently, sentence ordering task attracts more focus in NLP community (Chen et al., 2016; Agrawal et al., 2016; Li and Jurafsky, 2016) as its importance on many succeed applications such as multi-document summarization, etc.\nThe goal of sentence ordering is to arrange a set of sentences into a coherent text in a clear and consistent manner (Grosz et al., 1995; Van Berkum et al., 1999; Barzilay and Lapata, 2008).\nMost of previous researches of sentence ordering are pair-wise models. Chen et al. (2016) and Agrawal et al. (2016) proposed pair-wise models\n1https://github.com/fudannlp 2http://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/data/ ∗Jingjing Gong and Xinchi Chen contributed equally to this\nwork.\nfollowed by a beam search decoder to seek the ground truth sentence order. Li and Jurafsky (2016) additionally employed the graph based method (Lapata, 2003) to rank sentences. However, their methods could be easily affected by the performance of independent sentence pairs without their contextual sentences.\nIn this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural sentence ordering approach based on the pointer network (Ptr-Net) (Vinyals et al., 2015). Pointer network can deal with some combinatorial optimization problems with attention mechanism, such as sorting the elements of a given set. Our proposed model can take as input a set of random sorted sentences, and generate an ordered sequences. With pointer network, our proposed model could utilize the whole contextual information to specify the sort order. In addition, we further evaluate the robustness of our model by adding unrelated noisy sentence to the sentence set, which is nontrivial for pair-wise models. Experimental results on two datasets show that proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance even it only works with the greedy decoding.\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n1. Instead of pair-wise sentence ordering, we propose an end-to-end neural approach to generate the order of sentences, which could exploit the contextual information and alleviate the error propagation problem. 2. We perform extensive empirical experiments and achieve the state-of-the-art performance even it only works with the greedy decoding. 3. We design a new and harder experiment to eval-\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n04 95\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n5 N\nov 2\nuate the robustness of our model.

The pairwise scores of this example are: P = 1/6, R = 1/3, F = 2/9.\nLongest Sequence Ratio Longest sequence ratio (LSR) calculates the radio of longest correct sub-sequence (consecutiveness is not necessary, and higher is better).

Since there is no noisy sentence here and the number of output sentences is the same as inputs, three scores of PM and LSR are the same in this table. Thus, we only use PM and LSR to denote the same P,R, F values. As we can see, our model outperforms previous works, and achieves the state-of-theart performance. Our model with LSTM sentence encoder reaches 40.00% in PMR, which means that 2/5 texts in test set of arXiv dataset are ranked exactly right, 6.57% boosted compared with work of Chen et al. (2016).\nMoreover, we investigate the performance of our model when sentence number varies. As Chen et al. (2016) did not evaluate their results on LSR metrics, we only compare with them on PM and PMR. As shown in Figure 2, our model with CNN and LSTM sentence encoders outperforms the work of (Chen et al., 2016). Although the accuracy of our model drops as the number of sentences increases, we could find that our model performs better on text with more sentences compared to pair-wise model.\nSince first and last sentences are more special, we also evaluate the accuracy of finding the first and last sentences. As shown in Table 3, we also achieve significant boost compared to work of (Chen et al., 2016).\nAccording to the experimental results above, we could find that Ptr-Net with LSTM sentence encoder always outperforms the one with CBoW or CNN\nsentence encoder. Thus, we mainly focus on evaluating our model with LSTM sentence encoder in the rest of this paper."

      "heading" : "4.5 Visualization",
      "text" : "To further understand how our model works, we do some visualizations of Ptr-Net with CNN and LSTM sentence encoders. As shown in Table 5, the left side (first three columns) blue terms are input sentences. They are firstly encoded by sentence encoder (CNN or LSTM sentence encoder), then sent to the decoder of Ptr-Net. The right side (last column) red term is the first sentence that our model predicts. After that, this red item is encoded and sent to Prt-Net decoder to generate the 2nd sentence. This visualization shows how important each word is in generating the 2nd sentence. The more important the words are, the darker the color is. As we can see, by using CNN sentence encoder, the model focuses more on individual words, like “first”, “second”, which give strong signal for ordering. Contrastly, the model with LSTM sentence encoder trends to find a specific pattern (or compositional features). In this case, the model emphasizes the pattern “Our X question regarding”, where X could be ordinal numbers like first and second here. However, both of them have some signals like words “indices”, “algorithm”, which might be disturbances and hard to interpret.\nThere still a question remains. How could we determine the importance of each word (the color)? Inspired by the back-propagation strategy (Erhan et al., 2009; Simonyan et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016), which measures how much each input unit contributes to the final decision, we can approximate the importance of words by their first derivatives. Formally, we aim to rank n sentences in gold order s1, . . . , sn. Assuming the predicted order would be ô and we are predicting the i-th sentence sôi , the importance of each word w j k (k-th word in j-th sentence sôj ) is:\nA(wjk) = ∣∣∣∣∣∂P (ôi|ôi−1, . . . , ô1, s)∂wjk ∣∣∣∣∣ , (26)\nwhere wjk is word embedding of word w j k. Function | · | is the second order normalization operation. P (ôi|ôi−1, . . . , ô1, s) is detailed in Eq. 5. For\nCBoW sentence encoder, the gradients of words in a sentence are the same for the simple average operation. Thus, we only visualize Ptr-Net with CNN and LSTM sentence encoders."

      "heading" : "4.6 Noisy Sentences",
      "text" : "Interestingly, we find our model could deal with the case well when additional noisy sentence exists. To evaluate the performance of our model on noisy sentences, we compare three different strategies in adding noises: (1) 0 noisy sentence (0 noise); (2) 1 noisy sentence (1 noise); (3) 1 noisy sentence with 50% probability (0/1 noise). All noisy sentences come from own datasets. Since all texts in SIND dataset contain 5 sentences, it is easy for model to tell if there is noisy sentence. Thus, we only evaluate our model on arXiv dataset as shown in Table 6. As mentioned above, we only use the model with LSTM sentence encoder to evaluate the ability of our model on disambiguating noisy sentences, since it always performs better than the one with CBoW or CNN sentence encoder.\nAlthough 0 noise version seems the same as the case in Table 4, they are actually different with each other. In this section, 0 noise version do not constrain the length of predicted sequence to be the same with input. In addition, the P,R, F values of PM and LSR of 0 noise and 1 noise version are not the same actually, and very little difference exists (4 numbers after decimal point). It is because that our model is very good at eliminating the noise terms on 0 noise and 1 noise cases.\nAs we can see, our model performs best on 0 noise case, which implies that it is easier than 1 noise and 0/1 noise cases for our model. However, it is hard to say which one is more difficult among 1 noise and 0/1 noise cases, as the performance on different metrics are not consistent."

Barzilay and Elhadad (2002) proposed two naive sentence ordering techniques, such as majority ordering and chronological ordering, in the context of multi-document summarization. Lapata (2003) proposed a probabilistic model that assumes the probability of any given sentence is determined by its adjacent sentence and learns constraints on sentence order from a corpus of domain specific texts. Okazaki et al. (2004) improved chronological ordering by resolving antecedent sentences of arranged sentences and combining topical segmentation. Bollegala et al. (2010) presented a bottom-up approach to arrange sentences extracted for multi-document summarization.\nRecently, increasing number of researches studied sentence ordering using neural models (Agrawal et al., 2016; Li and Jurafsky, 2016; Chen et al., 2016). Chen et al. (2016) framed sentence ordering as an isolated task and firstly applied neural methods on sentence ordering. In addition, they designed an interesting task of ordering the coherent sentences from academic abstracts. Agrawal et al. (2016) focused on a very similar ordering task which ranks image-caption pairs, additionally considering the image information. Li and Jurafsky (2016) mainly applied neural models to judge if a given text is coherent.\nDespite of their success, they are all pair-wise based models, lack of contextual information. Unlike these work, we propose an end-to-end neural model based on Ptr-Net to address sentence ordering problem."

However, it is nontrivial for pairwise models to incorporate the contextual sentence information. In addition, error prorogation could be introduced by using the pipeline strategy in pair-wise models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural approach to address the sentence ordering problem, which uses the pointer network (Ptr-Net) to alleviate the error propagation problem and utilize the whole contextual information. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed model. Source codes1 and dataset2 of this paper are available.",
