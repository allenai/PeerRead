      "text" : "Learning sparse representations has important applications in many areas of science and engineering. The use of an ℓ0-norm regularizer leads to a sparse solution, however the ℓ0-norm regularized optimization problem is challenging to solve, due to the discontinuity and non-convexity of the ℓ0-norm regularizer. The ℓ1-norm regularizer, a continuous and convex surrogate, has been studied extensively in the literature (Tibshirani, 1996; Efron et al., 2004) and has been applied successfully to many applications including signal/image processing, biomedical informatics and computer vision (Shevade & Keerthi, 2003; Wright et al., 2008; Beck & Teboulle, 2009; Wright et al., 2009; Ye & Liu, 2012). Although the ℓ1norm based sparse learning formulations have achieved great success, they have been shown to be suboptimal in many cases (Candes et al., 2008; Zhang, 2010b; 2012), since the ℓ1-norm is a loose approximation of the ℓ0-norm and often leads to an over-penalized problem. To address this issue, many non-convex regularizers, interpolated between the ℓ0-norm and\nthe ℓ1-norm, have been proposed to better approximate the ℓ0-norm. They include ℓq-norm (0 < q < 1) (Foucart & Lai, 2009), Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) (Fan & Li, 2001), Log-Sum Penalty (LSP) (Candes et al., 2008), Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP) (Zhang, 2010a), Geman Penalty (GP) (Geman & Yang, 1995; Trzasko & Manduca, 2009) and Capped-ℓ1 penalty (Zhang, 2010b; 2012; Gong et al., 2012a).\nAlthough the non-convex regularizers (penalties) are appealing in sparse learning, it is challenging to solve the corresponding non-convex optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST) algorithm for a large class of non-convex penalties. The key step of the proposed algorithm is to compute a proximal operator, which has a closed-form solution for many commonly used non-convex penalties. In our algorithm, we adopt the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) rule (Barzilai & Borwein, 1988) to initialize the line search step size at each iteration, which greatly accelerates the convergence speed. We also use a non-monotone line search criterion to further speed up the convergence of the algorithm. In addition, we present a detailed convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments on largescale real-world data sets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

We first present a lemma which guarantees that the monotone line search criterion in Eq. (3) is satisfied. This is a basic support for the convergence of Algorithm 1.\nLemma 1 Let the assumptions A1-A3 hold and the constant σ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then for any integer k ≥ 0, the monotone line search criterion in Eq. (3) is satisfied whenever t(k) ≥ β(l)/(1− σ).\nProof Since w(k+1) is a minimizer of problem (2), we have\n〈∇l(w(k)),w(k+1) −w(k)〉+ t(k)\n2 ‖w(k+1) −w(k)‖2\n+ r(w(k+1)) ≤ r(w(k)).

(3) is satisfied whenever (t(k) − β(l))/2 ≥ σt(k)/2, i.e., t(k) ≥ β(l)/(1− σ). This completes the proof the lemma.\nNext, we summarize the boundedness of t(k) in the following lemma.\nLemma 2 For any k ≥ 0, t(k) is bounded under the monotone line search criterion in Eq. (3).\nProof It is trivial to show that t(k) is bounded from below, since t(k) ≥ tmin (tmin is defined in Algorithm 1). Next we prove that t(k) is bounded from above by contradiction. Assume that there exists a k ≥ 0, such that t(k) is unbounded from above. Without loss of generality, we assume that t(k) increases monotonically to +∞ and t(k) ≥ ηβ(l)/(1−σ). Thus, the value t = t(k)/η ≥ β(l)/(1 − σ) must have been tried at iteration k and does not satisfy the line\nsearch criterion in Eq. (3). But Lemma 1 states that t = t(k)/η ≥ β(l)/(1 − σ) is guaranteed to satisfy the line search criterion in Eq. (3). This leads to a contradiction. Thus, t(k) is bounded from above.\nRemark 2 We note that if Eq. (3) holds, Eq. (4) is guaranteed to be satisfied. Thus, the same conclusions in Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 also hold under the the non-monotone line search criterion in Eq. (4).\nBased on Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we present our convergence result in the following theorem.\nTheorem 1 Let the assumptions A1-A3 hold and the monotone line search criterion in Eq. (3) be satisfied. Then all limit points of the sequence { w(k) }\ngenerated by Algorithm 1 are critical points of problem (1).\nProof Based on Lemma 1, the monotone line search criterion in Eq.

Let w⋆ be a limit point of the sequence { w(k) }\n, that is, there exists a subsequence K such that\nlim k∈K→∞\nw(k) = w⋆.\nSince f is bounded from below, together with the fact that { f(w(k)) } is monotonically decreasing, limk→∞ f(w (k)) exists. Observing that f is continuous, we have\nlim k→∞ f(w(k)) = lim k∈K→∞ f(w(k)) = f(w⋆).\nTaking limits on both sides of Eq. (3) with k ∈ K, we have\nlim k∈K→∞\n‖w(k+1) −w(k)‖ = 0.

(7), we obtain\n0 ∈ ∇l(w⋆) + ∂r1(w ⋆)− ∂r2(w ⋆),\nTherefore, w⋆ is a critical point of problem (1). This completes the proof of Theorem 1.\nBased on Eq. (7), we know that limk∈K→∞ ‖w (k+1) − w(k)‖2 = 0 is a necessary optimality condition of Algorithm 1. Thus, ‖w(k+1) − w(k)‖2 is a quantity to measure the convergence of the sequence {w(k)} to a critical point. We present the convergence rate in terms of ‖w(k+1) −w(k)‖2 in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2 Let {w(k)} be the sequence generated by Algorithm 1 with the monotone line search criterion in Eq.

Then all limit points of the sequence { w(k) } generated by Algorithm 1 are critical points of problem (1).\nNote that Theorem 1/Theorem 3 makes sense only if {\nw(k) }\nhas limit points. By considering one more mild assumption:\nA4 f(w) → +∞ when ‖w‖ → +∞,\nwe summarize the existence of limit points in the following theorem (the proof is omitted):\nTheorem 4 Let the assumptions A1-A4 hold and the monotone/non-monotone line search criterion in Eq.

One commonly used approach to solve problem (1) is the Multi-Stage (MS) convex relaxation (or CCCP, or DC programming) (Zhang, 2010b; Yuille & Rangarajan, 2003; Gasso et al., 2009). It equivalently rewrites problem (1) as\nmin w∈Rd f1(w)− f2(w),\nwhere f1(w) and f2(w) are both convex functions. The MS algorithm solves problem (1) by generating a sequence {w(k)} as\nw(k+1) =argmin w∈Rd f1(w)− f2(w (k))\n− 〈s2(w (k)),w −w(k)〉, (8)\nwhere s2(w (k)) denotes a sub-gradient of f2(w) at w = w(k). Obviously, the objective function in problem (8) is convex. The MS algorithm involves solving a\nsequence of convex optimization problems as in problem (8). In general, there is no closed-form solution to problem (8) and the computational cost of the MS algorithm is k times that of solving problem (8), where k is the number of outer iterations. This is computationally expensive especially for large scale problems.\nA class of related algorithms called iterative shrinkage and thresholding (IST), which are also known as different names such as fixed point iteration and forward-backward splitting (Daubechies et al., 2004; Combettes & Wajs, 2005; Hale et al., 2007; Beck & Teboulle, 2009; Wright et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009), have been extensively applied to solve problem (1). The key step is by generating a sequence {w(k)} via solving problem (2). However, they require that the regularizer r(w) is convex and some of them even require that both l(w) and r(w) are convex. Our proposed GIST algorithm is a more general framework, which can deal with a wider range of problems including both convex and non-convex cases.\nAnother related algorithm called a Variant of Iterative Reweighted Lα (VIRL) is recently proposed to solve the following optimization problem (Lu, 2012a):\nmin w∈Rd\n{\nf(w) = l(w) + λ\nd ∑\ni=1\n(|wi| α + ǫi) q/α\n}\n,\nwhere α ≥ 1, 0 < q < 1, ǫi > 0. VIRL solves the above problem by generating a sequence {w(k)} as\nw(k+1) = argmin w∈Rd l(w(k)) + 〈∇l(w(k)),w −w(k)〉\n+ t(k)\n2 ‖w−w(k)‖2 +\nλq\nα\nd ∑\ni=1\n(|wki | α + ǫi) q/α−1|wi| α.\nIn VIRL, t(k−1) is chosen as the initialization of t(k). The line search step in VIRL finds the smallest integer ℓ with t(k) = t(k−1)ηℓ (η > 1) such that\nf(w(k+1)) ≤ f(w(k))− σ\n2 ‖w(k+1) −w(k)‖2 (σ > 0).\nThe most related algorithm to our propose GIST is the Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) proposed by Lu (2012b). SCP solves problem (1) by generating a sequence {w(k)} as\nw(k+1) = argmin w∈Rd l(w(k)) + 〈∇l(w(k)),w −w(k)〉\n+ t(k)\n2 ‖w−w(k)‖2 + r1(w) − r2(w (k))− 〈s2,w−w (k)〉,\nwhere s2 is a sub-gradient of r2(w) at w = w (k). Our algorithm differs from SCP in that the original regularizer r(w) = r1(w) − r2(w) is used in the proximal\noperator in problem (2), while r1(w) minus a locally linear approximation for r2(w) is adopted in SCP. We will show in the experiments that our proposed GIST algorithm is more efficient than SCP."

    "abstractText" : "Non-convex sparsity-inducing penalties have recently received considerable attentions in sparse learning. Recent theoretical investigations have demonstrated their superiority over the convex counterparts in several sparse learning settings. However, solving the non-convex optimization problems associated with non-convex penalties remains a big challenge. A commonly used approach is the Multi-Stage (MS) convex relaxation (or DC programming), which relaxes the original non-convex problem to a sequence of convex problems. This approach is usually not very practical for large-scale problems because its computational cost is a multiple of solving a single convex problem. In this paper, we propose a General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST) algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization problem for a large class of non-convex penalties. The GIST algorithm iteratively solves a proximal operator problem, which in turn has a closed-form solution for many commonly used penalties. At each outer iteration of the algorithm, we use a line search initialized by the BarzilaiProceedings of the 30 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 2013.
