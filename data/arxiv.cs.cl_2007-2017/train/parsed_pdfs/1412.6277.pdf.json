      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Text document classification aims at assigning a text document to one or more classes. Successful methods are traditionally based on bag-of-words (BOW). Finding discriminative keywords is, in general, good enough for text classification. Given a dictionary of words D to consider, documents are represented by a |D|-dimensional vector (the bag of its words). Each dimension is either a binary value (present or not in the document) or a word occurrence frequency. Some term weightings (e.g. the popular td-idf) have also been defined to reflect how discriminative a word is for a document. These are considered as features for training a classifier. Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are often the first choices. One limitation of the bag-of-words model is that the discriminative words are usually not the most frequent ones. A large dictionary of words needs to be defined to obtain a robust model. Classifiers then have to deal with a huge number of features, and thus become time-consuming and memory-hungry.\nSome techniques have been proposed to reduce the dimensionality and represent documents in a low-dimensional semantic space. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) uses the term-document matrix and a singular value decomposition (SVD) to represent terms and documents in a new low-dimensional space. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) is a generative probabilistic model of a corpus. Each document is represented as a mixture of latent topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words. By defining K topics,\n∗All research was conducted at the Idiap Research Institute, before Ronan Collobert joined Facebook AI Research.\ndocuments can then be represented as K-dimensional vectors. Pessiot et al. (2010) also proposed probabilistic models for unsupervised dimensionality reduction in the context of document clustering. They make the hypothesis that words occuring with the same frequencies in the same document are semantically related. Based on this assumption, words are partioned into word topics. Document are then represented by a vector where each feature corresponds to a word-topic representing the number of occurrences of words from that word-topic in the document. Other techniques have tried to improve text document clustering by taking into account relationships between important terms. Some have enriched document representations by integrating core ontologies as background knowledge (Staab & Hotho, 2003), or with Wikipedia concepts and category information (Hu et al., 2009). Part-of-speech tags have also been used to disambiguate words (Sedding & Kazakov, 2004).\nAll these techniques are based on words alone, which raises another limitation. A collection of words cannot capture phrases or multi-word expressions, while n-grams have shown to be helpful features in several natural language processing tasks (Tan et al., 2002; Lin & Wu, 2009; Wang & Manning, 2012). N -gram features are not commonly used in text classification, probably because the dictionary Dn tends to grow exponentially with n. Phrase structure extraction can be used to identify only n-grams which are phrase patterns, and thus limit the dictionary size. However, this adds another step to the model, making it more complex. To overcome these barriers, we propose that documents be represented as a bag of semantic concepts, where n-grams are considered instead of only words. Good word vector representations are obtained very quickly with many different recent approaches (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Mnih & Kavukcuoglu, 2013; Lebret & Collobert, 2014; Pennington et al., 2014). Mikolov et al. (2013a) also showed that simple vector addition can often produce meaningful results, such as king - man + woman ≈ queen. By leveraging the ability of these word vector representations to compose, representations for n-grams are easily computed with an element-wise addition. Using a clustering algorithm such as K-means, those representations are grouped into K clusters which can be viewed as semantic concepts. Text documents are now represented as bag of semantic concepts, with each feature corresponding to the presence or not of n-grams from the resulting clusters. Therefore, more information is captured while remaining in a low-dimensional space. As Mikolov et al’s Skip-gram model and K-means are highly parallelizable, this model is much faster to compute than LSA or LDA. The same classifiers as with BOW-based models are then applied on these bag of semantic concepts. We show that such model is a good alternative to LSA or LDA to represent documents and yields even better results on movie review tasks."

Leveraging recent models, such as the Skip-gram (Mikolov et al., 2013b) or GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) models, they are trained over a large corpus of unlabeled data in an efficient manner. These models are indeed highly parallelizable, which helps to obtain these representations very quickly. Word representations are then summed to generate n-gram representations:\n1\nn\nn ∑\ni=1\nxwi .

First, each n-gram is embedded into a common vector space by averaging its word vector representations. The resulting n-grams representations are assigned to clusters using the centroids γk defined by the K-means clustering. Documents di are then represented by a vector of K features, fi ∈ RK . Each entry fki usually corresponds to the frequency of n-grams from the k th cluster within the document di. The set of text documents is then defined as D̂ = {(fi, yi)| fi ∈ R\nK , yi ∈ {−1, 1}} L i=1.\nWith NB features. For certain type of document, such as movie reviews, the use of Naive Bayes features can improve the general performance (Wang & Manning, 2012). Success in sentiment analysis relies mostly on the capability of the models to detect negative and positive n-grams in a document. A proper normalization is then calculated to determine how important each n-gram is for a given class y. We denote ngm = (ngm1, . . . , ngmN) a set of count vectors for all n-grams contained in D, ngmi ∈ RL. ngmit represents the number of occurence of the n-gram t in the training document di. Defining count vectors as p = 1 + ∑\ni:yi=1 ngmi and q = 1 +\n∑\ni:yi=−1 ngmi, a\nlog-count ratio is calculated to determine how important n-grams are for the classes y:\nr = log\n(\np/||p||1 q/||q||1\n)\n, with r ∈ RN . (3)\nBecause n-grams are in clusters, we extract the maximum absolute log-count ratio for every cluster:\nf̃ki = argmax rt |rt| , ∀t ∈ k, ngm i t > 0 (4)\nThese document representations can then be used for several NLP tasks such as classification or information retrieval. As for BOW-based models, this model is particulary suitable for linear SVM."

To evaluate the benefit of adding n-grams for sentiment analysis, we define semantic concepts with different combinations of n-grams: (1) only 1-grams (i.e. clusters of words), (2) only 2-grams, (3) only 3-grams, (4) with 1-grams and 2-grams, and (5) with 1-grams, 2-grams and 3-grams.

We train the K-topics LDA model using the code released by Blei et al. (2003)6. We leave the LDA hyperparameters at their default values. Like our model, LDA extracts K topics (i.e. semantic concepts) and assigns words to these topics. Considering only the words in documents, we thus apply the method described in Section 2.3 to get document representations.

Good performance is achieved even with only 100 clusters, where LSA needs more clusters to improve. We also denote that our approach performs well on a small dataset, where LDA fails. A significant increase is observed when using 2-grams instead of 1-grams. However, using only 3-grams hurts the performance. The best results are obtained using a combination of n-grams, which confirms the benefit of the method. That also means that word vector representations can be combined while keeping relevant semantic information. This is illustrated in Table 3 where semantically close n-grams are in the same cluster. We can see that the model is furthermore able to clearly separate antonyms, which is a good asset for sentiment classification. The results are also very competitive with a traditional BOW-model. Using the same 1-gram dictionary and a linear SVM classifier with the naive bayes features, BOW-model achieves 83% accuracy for Pang and Lee’s dataset, and 88.58% for Maas et al’s dataset.

      "heading" : "3.4 COMPUTATION TIME",
      "text" : "The bag of semantic concepts model can leverage information coming from n-grams to improve sentiment classification of documents. This model has also the nice property to build document representations in an efficient and timely manner. The most time-consuming and costly process step in the model is the K-means clustering, especially when dealing with millions of n-gram representations. However, this step can be done very quickly with low memory by using mini-batch K-means method. Computation times for generating 300-dimensional representations are reported in Table 2. All experiments have been run on single CPU core Intel i7 2600K 3.4 GHz. Despite the fact that single CPU has been used for this benchmark, the three steps of the model are highly parallelizable. The recorded times could thus be divided by the number of CPUs available. We see that representations can be computed in less than one minute with only 1-gram dictionary. About 10 minutes are necessary when adding 2-grams, and about 40 minutes by adding 3-grams. In comparison, LDA needs six hours for extracting 100 topics and three days for 300 topics. Our model is also very competitive with LSA which takes 540 seconds to generate 300-dimensional document representations. However, adding 2-grams and 3-grams to perform a LSA would be extremely time-consuming and memory-hungry while our model can handle it.\n3.5 INFERRING SEMANTIC CONCEPTS FOR UNSEEN n-GRAMS\nAnother drawback of classical models is that they cannot deal with unseen words. Only words present in the training documents are used to infer representation for a new text document. Unlike these models, our model can easily assign semantic concepts for new n-grams. Because n-gram representations are based on its word vector representations, a new n-gram vector representation can be calculated if a representation is available for each of its words. This new representations is then assigned to the nearest centroid γk, which determines its semantic concept. With a small training set, this is a valuable asset when compared to other models."

N -grams with different length n can then be embedded in a same dimensional vector space with a simple element-wise addition. This makes it possible to compute distances between n-grams, which can have many applications in natural language processing. We therefore proposed a bag of semantic concepts model to represent documents in a low-dimensional space. These semantic concepts are obtained by performing a K-means clustering which partition all n-grams into K clusters. This model has several advantages over classical approaches for representing documents in a low-dimensional space: it leverages semantic information coming from n-grams; it builds document representations with low resource consumption (time and memory); it can infer semantic concepts for unseen n-grams. Furthermore, we have shown that such model is suitable for document classification. Competitive performance has been reached on binary sentiment classification tasks, where this model outperforms traditional approaches. It also attained similar results to traditional bag-ofwords with considerably less features."

Part-of-speech tags have also been used to disambiguate words (Sedding & Kazakov, 2004). All these techniques are based on words alone, which raises another limitation. A collection of words cannot capture phrases or multi-word expressions, while n-grams have shown to be helpful features in several natural language processing tasks (Tan et al., 2002; Lin & Wu, 2009; Wang & Manning, 2012). N -gram features are not commonly used in text classification, probably because the dictionary D tends to grow exponentially with n. Phrase structure extraction can be used to identify only n-grams which are phrase patterns, and thus limit the dictionary size. However, this adds another step to the model, making it more complex. To overcome these barriers, we propose that documents be represented as a bag of semantic concepts, where n-grams are considered instead of only words. Good word vector representations are obtained very quickly with many different recent approaches (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Mnih & Kavukcuoglu, 2013; Lebret & Collobert, 2014; Pennington et al., 2014).

This generally involves a huge number of features. Some techniques, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have been designed to summarize documents in a lower dimension with the least semantic information loss. Some semantic information is nevertheless always lost, since only words are considered. Instead, we aim at using information coming from n-grams to overcome this limitation, while remaining in a low-dimension space. Many approaches, such as the Skip-gram model, provide good word vector representations very quickly. We propose to average these representations to obtain representations of n-grams. All n-grams are thus embedded in a same semantic space. A K-means clustering can then group them into semantic concepts. The number of features is therefore dramatically reduced and documents are then represented as bag of semantic concepts. We show that this model outperforms LSA and LDA on a sentiment classification task, and yields similar results than a traditional BOW-model with far less features.",
