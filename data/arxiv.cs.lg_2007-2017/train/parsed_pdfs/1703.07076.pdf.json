      "text" : "Neural networks and deep learning has shown interesting application successes, such as image classification1, and speech recognition2. One of the issues that limits their general applicability in the QSAR domain may be the limited sizes of the labeled datasets available, although successes do appear3. Limited datasets necessitates harsh regularization or shallow and narrow architectures. Within image analysis and classification, data augmentation techniques has been used with excellent results4-7. As an example, a dataset of labeled images can be enlarged by operations such as mirroring, rotation, morphing and zooming. The afterwards trained network gets more robust towards such variations and the neural network can recognize the same object in different versions. Neural networks has also been used on molecular data, where the input may be calculated descriptors3, neural network interpretation of the molecular graph8 or also SMILES representations.9 Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is a single line text based molecular notation format.10 A single molecule has multiple possible SMILES strings, which has led to the definition of a canonical SMILES,11 which ensures that a molecule corresponds to a single SMILES string. The possibilities for variation in the SMILES strings of simple molecules are limited. Propane has two possibilities CCC and C(C)C. But as the molecule gets larger in size and more complex in branching, the number of possible SMILES strings grows rapidly. Toluene with seven atoms, has seven possible SMILES strings (Figure 1).\nHere data augmentation of molecular structures with SMILES enumeration for QSAR studies will be investigated using long short term memory (LSTM) cell neural networks inspired by networks used for Twitter tweets sentiment analysis.12"

      "text" : "SMILES enumeration was done with a Python script utilizing the cheminformatics library RDKit.13 The atom ordering of the molecule is scrambled randomly by converting to molfile format14 and changing the atom order, before converting back to the RDKit mol format. A SMILES is then generated using RDKit with the default option of producing canonical SMILES set to false, where different atom orderings lead to different SMILES. The SMILES strings is then compared and possible added to a growing set of unique SMILES strings. The process is repeated a predefined number of times. The python functions are available on github: https://github.com/Ebjerrum/SMILES-enumeration"

      "text" : "The dataset was obtained from Sutherland et al 2003.15 It consists of 756 dihydrofolate inhibitors with P. carinii DHFR inhibition data. The dataset was split in test and a training set in a 1:9 ratio. It was expanded with SMILES enumeration and the SMILES strings were padded with spaces to fixed length of 74, which is one characters longer than the longest SMILES in the dataset. It was subsequently vectorized by one-hot encoding the characters into a bit matrix with one bit set for the corresponding character in each row using a generated char to int dictionary. Molecules where the associated affinity was not a number were removed. The associated IC50 data was converted to log IC50 and normalized to unit variance and mean zero with utilities from Scikit-learn.16"

      "heading" : "Results",
      "text" : "Filtering, splitting and SMILES enumeration resulted in a canonical SMILES dataset with 602 train molecules and 71 test molecules, whereas the enumerated dataset had 79143 and 9412 rows for train and test, respectively. This corresponds to an augmentation factor of approximately 130. Each molecule had on average 130 alternative SMILES representations.\nOptimization of the architecture yielded two different best configurations of hyper parameters, depending on the dataset used. The best hyper parameters found for each dataset are shown in Table 2.\nThe train history is shown in Figure 2. The best neural network trained on the canonical dataset had a loss of 0.44 including regularization penalty and a mean square error of 0.22 and 0.41 for train and test set, respectively. The curves for the training using the canonical dataset are very noisy (Figure 2A). The best neural network trained on the enumerated dataset loss of 0.18 including regularization penalty and a mean square error of 0.09 and 0.30 for train and test set, respectively. The training curve is significantly less noisy than for the canonical dataset (Figure 2B).\nBoth neural networks were used to predict the IC50 values from the canonical and enumerated datasets, and the scatter plots are shown in Figure 3. The correlation coefficients and root mean square deviation (RMS) are tabulated in Table 3. The combination with the worst performance was predicting the test set molecules is using enumerated SMILES neural network model trained on the canonical dataset. Which\nhas a correlation coefficient of 0.26 and an RMS of 0.84. The bad correlation is clearly visible from Figure 3 plot C. The best performance predicting the test set, was seen with the combination of the enumerated model and the enumerated SMILES. Here the correlation coefficient is 0.66 and the RMS 0.55. The two other combinations, canonical model-canonical SMILES and enumerated model, canonical SMILES are close in performance (Table 3).\nFigure 4 show a scatter plot of the average prediction for each molecule obtained with the enumerated model. The calculated correlation coefficient is 0.68 for the test set and the RMS is 0.52."

      "heading" : "Discussion",
      "text" : "The results clearly suggest that SMILES enumeration as a data augmentation technique for molecular data has benefits. The model trained on canonical data is not able to predict many of the alternative SMILES of the train and test set as is evident for Figure 3 plot C, where the bad generalization to non canonical SMILES strings are evident. Instead the best performance was observed by taking the average for each molecule of the predictions of the enumerated SMILES using the enumerated model (Figure 4), which shows that the SMILES enumeration can also be of value in the sampling phase.\nThe canonical model needed a lot more epochs to train, but here it must be considered that the dataset contained 130 times fewer examples. Thus each epoch in the training was only 3 mini batches leading to 3 updates of the weights, whereas the enumerated dataset had approximately 360 updates of the weights of the neural network per epoch. The curves in Figure 2 thus represents 3000 and 18000 updates of the weights. The higher overhead of running more epochs however led to approximately the same wall clock time in training.\nThe hyper parameters found during the optimization of the network architecture and amount of regularization was not entirely as expected. The expectation was that the canonical dataset would prefer a smaller and simpler network with a larger regularization. Instead the canonical dataset has a larger amount of LSTM cells (128) with no dropout, but a much larger regularization of the final weights to the input neuron (L1 and L2 maxed out at 0.2). The enumerated model had fewer LSTM cells (64) and thus fewer connections, but nevertheless found dropout on the input to the LSTM cells to be beneficial. To test if the differences were due to the Bayesian optimization getting trapped in a local minimum, the network architecture found for the enumerated dataset was test trained with the dataset with the canonical SMILES only. The first try with a learning rate of 0.005 failed (results not shown), but lowering the learning rate to the one found for the canonical SMILES (0.0001), gave a model with a correlation coefficient of 0.5 and RMS of 0.68 on the train set. The predictive performance was even lower with 0.45 and 0.69, for R2 and RMS respectively. The differences in hyper parameters after optimization of using the two different datasets thus seems justified.\nThe study lacks the division into train, test and validation set, where the hyper parameters are tuned on the test set, but the final performance evaluated on the validation set. The observed prediction performance of the LSTM-QSAR models are thus likely overestimated to some degree. However, this study is focused on the gains of using SMILES enumeration and not on producing the optimal DHFR QSAR model. The performance on both the train and test set are lower for the canonical model. If the differences in performance had been due to to over-fitting, the smaller dataset would probably have had an advantage.\nThe use of SMILES as descriptors for QSAR is not new, as at least one example of usage in toxicological QSAR models exists21 and is implemented in the CORAL software.22 The approach is however very different from the one in this study. CORAL software breaks down the SMILES into single atoms, double atoms and triple atoms (Sk, SSk and SSSk) as well as some extra manually coded extracted features such as BOND, NOSP, HALO and PAIR.21,22 The approach seems close to using a mixture of topological torsions23 with one, two and three atoms and atom-pair24 fingerprints. The LSTM-QSAR used in this approach directly uses the SMILES string and supposedly let the model best extract the features from the SMILES strings that best fit with the task at hand. A 1:1 benchmark of the approaches on multiple datasets could be an interesting future study.\nSMILES were also used recently in an application of a neural network based auto-encoder.9 Here the SMILES are used as input to a neural network with the task of recreating the input sequence. The information is passed through a “bottle-neck” layer in between the encoder and the decoder, which limits the direct transfer of information. The bottle neck layer thus ends up as a more continuous floating point vector representation of the molecule, which can be used to explore the chemical space near an input molecule, interpolate between molecules and link the vector representation to physicochemical properties. The amount of unlabeled molecules for the study already surpassed the needed amount, but could in principle be expanded even more with the SMILES enumeration technique described here. SMILES enumeration could possible allow the autoencoder to be trained with smaller and more focused datasets of biological interest. Additionally, tt would be interesting to see if different\nSMILES of the same molecule ends up with the same vector representation or in entirely different areas in the continuous molecular representations.\nLSTM networks have also been used in QSAR applications demonstrating learning transfer from large datasets to smaller.25 Here the input was however not SMILES strings but rather molecular graph convolution layers26 working directly on the molecular graph representation. The approach thus more directly reads in the topology of the molecular model, rather than indirectly letting the network infer the topology from the SMILES branching and ring closures defined by the brackets and numbering in the SMILES strings."
