      "text" : "Towards a Reliable Framework of Uncertainty-based Group Decision Support System\nJunyi CHAI and James N.K. LIU Department of Computing,\nThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, SAR { csjchai, csnkliu }@comp.polyu.edu.hk\nAbstract--This study proposes a framework of Uncertainty-based Group Decision Support System (UGDSS). It provides a platform for multiple criteria decision analysis in six aspects including (1) decision environment, (2) decision problem, (3) decision group, (4) decision conflict, (5) decision schemes and (6) group negotiation. Based on multiple artificial intelligent technologies, this framework provides reliable support for the comprehensive manipulation of applications and advanced decision approaches through the design of an integrated multi-agents architecture.\nKeywords: Knowledge Management; Uncertainty; MCDM; GDSS\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNowadays, since companies are usually working in a rapidly changing and uncertain business environment, more timely and accurate information are required for decision-making, in order to improve customer satisfaction, support profitable business analysis, and increase their competitive advantages. In addition to the use of data and mathematical models, some managerial decisions are qualitative in nature and need judgmental knowledge that resides in human experts. Thus, it is necessary to incorporate such knowledge in developing Decision Support System (DSS). A system that integrates knowledge from experts is called a Knowledge-based Decision Support System (KBDSS) or an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) [1]. Moreover, two kinds of situations significantly increase the complexity of decision problem: (1) multiple participants involved in decision process; (2) decision-making under uncertainty environment.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework of Uncertainty-based Group Decision Support System (UGDSS). Unlike existing DSS designs, this framework is based on multiagent technology and standalone knowledge management process. Through the adoption of agent technologies, this design provides an integrated system platform to resolve the uncertainty problem in support of group Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). Firstly, we provide a general model of group MCDM. Then, we carry out an analysis on uncertainty-based group MCDM, and present our designing basis of UGDSS. Thirdly, we propose the architectures and structures of UGDSS, including other two kinds of knowledge-related system components: (1) Decision Resource MIS and (2) Knowledge Base Management System (KBMS).\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the general problem model of Group MCDM. Section 3 gives the uncertainty analysis of group decision environment. Section 4 presents the framework of UGDSS, including two knowledge-related system components. Section 5 shows our conclusion and outlines for future work."

At the same time, Kuhn and Tucker [3] introduced the concept of Vector Optimization. Then, Charnes and Cooper [4] studied the model and application of Linear Programming in decision science. In 1972, the International Conference on MCDM held by Cochrane and Zeleny [5] remarked that the normative MCDM theory had been developed as the mainstream of decision science. More recently, many applicable MCDM approaches have been used to design Decision Support System for solving specific domain problems.\nThe MCDM with certain information and under certain environment is called Classic MCDM. Major methods of Classic MCDM can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Multiple Criteria Utility Theory, (2) Outranking Relations, (3) Preference Disaggregation."

In order to facilitate the establishment and development of MCDM support system, we carry out an analysis of group MCDM to form a general model.\nFig. 1 shows our proposed general problem model for group MCDM. It generally contains three decision sets: alternative sets ( iY ), decision maker sets ( ke ) and criterion sets ( jG ). It involves two kinds of weights: decision maker weights ( kw ) and criterion weights ( jω ). Decision makers provide their individual decision matrix ( )kijd and the weights ( jω ) of every criterion. In this figure, individual decision information is represented with a decision-plane ( kP ) including black points ( ( )k ijd ) and grey points ( ( )kjω ). Therefore, the group aggregation process can be shown as a plane-projection from individual decision plane kP to group-integrated decision plane ( )P K ."

      "text" : "Although Classic MCDM already has quite a complete theory by now, it still cannot solve most MCDM problems in real world. One main reason is that the decision information are usually not provided completely, clearly or precisely in reality. In most cases, people have to make decisions in uncertainty environment. Therefore, many researchers pay more attention on this research branch of Uncertainty MCDM.\nUncertainty MCDM is non-classic, and can be treated as the extension of Classic MCDM. We can generally divide the uncertainty problems into three categories: (1) Stochastic type (2) Fuzzy type (3) Rough type. A comparison of these uncertainty types is shown in Table I. Accordingly, Uncertainty MCDM also has three research directions: Stochastic MCDM, Fuzzy MCDM and Rough MCDM. Recently, many approaches have been developed to solve these problems (e.g. [15]). This paper will adopt this classification method to establish the framework of UGDSS including its subsystems, several intelligent agents and other functional applets.\nFuzzy type The membership of objects is uncertainty (not clarity)\nThe value of decision attribute in decision problem Fuzzy sets (Intuitionistic Fuzzy, Linguistic Fuzzy, … )\nRough type The granularity of objects is uncertainty (not accuracy)\nDecision schemes Rough sets (Variable Precision RSs, Dominance Based RSs, … )"

Then, Bernoulli [16] introduced the concept of Utility and Expected Utility Hypothesis Model. von Neumann and Morgenstern [17] concluded the Expected Utility Value Theory, proposed the axiomatic of Expected Utility Model, and mathematically proved the results of maximized Expected Utility for decision maker. Wald [18] established the basis of statistical decision problem, and applied them in the selection of stochastical decision schemes. Blackwell and Girshich [19] integrated the subjective probability with the utility theory into a clear process to solve decision problems.

Atanassov and Gargov [23][24] extended Zadeh’s Fuzzy Sets concept into the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFSs), and then as in the following, they extended IFSs into the Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IVIFSs), which are described by a membership degree and a non-membership degree whose values are intervals rather than real numbers. Based on these pioneering works, theories of IFSs and IVIFSs have received much attention from researchers. Until recently, some basic theorems such as Calculation Operators and Fuzzy Measures, have just been founded for various applications[25][26].\nIn Chai and Liu’s earlier work [15], a novel Fuzzy MCDM approach is proposed based on the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFSs) theory to solve the real problem in Supply Chain Management (SCM). It firstly applies IFSs to define and represent the fuzzy natural language terms which are used to describe the individual decision values and the weights for decision criteria and decision makers. And then six main steps of this approach are presented to solve uncertainty group MCDM problem. This work enriches the method base of solving fuzzy MCDM problem, and can be implemented in the proposed UGDSS."

Since 1992, the annual International Conference on Rough Sets has been playing a very important role in\npromoting the development of Rough sets in theory extension and various applications. More recently, Greco [30] proposed a Dominance based Rough Sets theory which produces the decision rules with stronger applicability. By now, Rough Sets theory has been applied in decision analysis, process control, knowledge discovery, machine learning, pattern recognition, etc. In UGDSS, the rough MCDM approaches are mainly implemented by various subsystems with specific function modules, key intelligent agents, and other deployable applets."

This process provides a mechanism to address the three kinds of complexities and group conflict, which consist of six analysis stages:\nDecision Environment Analysis Decision Problem Analysis Decision Group Analysis Decision Scheme Analysis Decision Conflict Analysis Group Coordination and Decision Analysis\nFrom decision-makers’ view, these stages have the basic logical sequence. Suppose there is a MCDM problem with complex internal structure involving multiple participants. We firstly need to analyze the existing internal and external environments, and figure out what are the decision conditions; whether the decision information is complete, certain and quantizable; what kinds of uncertainty type it belongs to. Secondly, the specific decision problems need to be analyzed, including ontological investigation, problem representation and decomposition, etc. Thirdly, an ontological group analysis is required to reduce the complexity of human organizational structure. Fourthly, people need to establish problem-solving solutions which may be derived from various resources including previous problem-solving schemes in knowledge bases, decision schemes from domain experts, or results of group discussion, etc. Fifthly, we need to integrate those\ndispersive, multipurpose, individual or incomplete decision opinions into one or a set of applicable final decision results. Besides, the six stages mentioned above can momentarily call Negotiation Support System in conflict analysis stage for possible decision conflicts.\nFrom the view of system process, each stage consists of several subsystems with different functions. For\nexample, we adopt the ontological problem analysis tools to represent, scrutinize and decompose the complex decision problem. These subsystems are integrated in the UGDSS platform with supports of interface technologies and intelligent agent technologies. In this design, parallel computation in subsystems and middleware is quite important, which can produce better system efficiency."

In this system, different kinds of information, knowledge, models and data interact together and provide the supports to the whole UGDSS.\nData Base Management System (DBMS) Generally, DSS needs a standalone database. Especially, this DSS is required to solve the complex uncertainty group decision problems. Therefore, DBMS is a necessary component in UGDSS, which consists of a DSS database and a Data Mining System. A database is created, accessed, and updated by a DBMS. And Data Mining System is used to discover knowledge from data resources. Many technologies are applicable to mining data, such as statistical approaches (Bayes’s theorem, cluster analysis, etc), case-based reasoning, neural computing, genetic algorithms, etc. These technologies are developed as intelligent agents located in the second layer in Fig. 2.\nModel Base Management System (MBMS)\nMBMS mainly includes Model Base and Model Analysis System. Model base contains routines and special statistics, financial forecasting, management science, and other quantitative models which provide the resources for Model Analysis System. Turban [1] divided the models into four major categories: Strategic, Tactical, Operational, and Analytical. In addition, there are model building blocks and routines. Based on these model resources, Model Analysis System is used to build blocks; generate the new routines and reports; update and change model; and manipulate model data, etc.\nKnowledge Base Management System (KBMS) There are three kinds of knowledge which will be used in decision-making: (1) structure (2) semi-structure (3) non-structure. The structural knowledge is usually reorganized in available models and stored in model base. Much semi-structural and non-structural knowledge are so complex that they cannot be easily represented and reorganized. Therefore, more professional knowledge processing system called KBMS is required to enhance the capability of knowledge management. In next section, we present a detailed knowledge management process in\nKBMS.

There are three activities to refine and explain the acquired knowledge: (1) selection, (2) generation, (3) assimilation. In selection activity, systems select knowledge from information resources and making it suitable for subsequent use.\nKnowledge Generation ： In this activity, knowledge is produced based on the decision incident by either discovery or derivation from existing knowledge.\nKnowledge Assimilation ： In assimilation activity, this knowledge refinement and explanation system alter the state of the decision makers’ knowledge resources by distributing and storing the acquired, selected, or generated knowledge [33].\nInference Engine ： In knowledge base, knowledge has been organized properly and represented in a machine-understandable format. The inference engine can then use the knowledge to infer new conclusions from existing facts and rules. There are many different ways of representing human knowledge, including Production rules, Semantic networks, Logic statement, and Uncertainty information representation, etc. Here, knowledge is recognized and restored in knowledge base which also conducts the communication with other DRMISs.\nKnowledge Emission：This activity embeds knowledge into the outputs of KBMS, and input the useful knowledge of specific decisional episode into UGDSS for further decisional knowledge manipulation activities including knowledge leadership, control and measurement."
