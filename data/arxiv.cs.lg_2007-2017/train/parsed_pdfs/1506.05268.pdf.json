INTRODUCTION\nCurrent statistical parametric speech synthesis typically uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to represent probability densities of speech trajectories given text [1]. This is a well-established method and it is straightforward to apply this framework for new languages. It also offers interesting advantages in terms of flexibility and compact footprint [2, 3, 4, 5]. It is known, however, that speech synthesized from statistical models still sounds somehow artificial and less natural compared to speech synthesized by the best unit selection systems.\nIt is often said that averaging in statistical synthesis systems partly removes spectral fine structure of natural speech, and thus there is room for the improving the segmental quality. A stochastic postfilter approach [6] proposes to use a deep neural network (DNN) to model the conditional probability of the spectral differences between natural and synthetic speech. The approach is able to reconstruct the spectral fine structure lost during modeling and has achieved significantly quality improvement for synthetic speech [6]. In this experiment, the HMM-based speech synthesiser was trained in the mel-cepstral domain, while the DNN-based postfiler was trained in the spectral domain.\nThis indicates that the current statistical parametric speech synthesis suffers from quality loss due to statistical averaging in the melcepstral domain, but also due to conversion from high-dimensional spectral features to lower dimensional mel-cepstral parameters and hence this brings us a new question: are current intermediate representations such as mel-cepstral coefficients appropriate for statistical training of acoustic models? Can we automatically find a more appropriate intermediate representation that suits acoustic modelling and results in better quality of synthetic speech?\nThe first author performed this work while at the National Institute of Informatics, Japan.\nThis work was supported in part by EPSRC through Programme Grant EP/I031022/1 (NST) and EP/J002526/1 (CAF). Shinji Takaki was supported in part by NAVER Labs.\nTo answer this question, this paper proposes a DNN-based feature extraction method. More specifically we propose to use a deep denoising auto-encoder technique as a non-linear robust feature extractor for speech synthesis and apply it to high-dimensional spectral features obtained from STRAIGHT vocoder [7]. We compare this data-driven, unsupervised feature extraction approach with the conventional mel-cepstral analysis, which is based on a linear discrete cosine transform of the log spectrum.\nThis paper is organised as follows: in Section 2, we outline related DNN-based approaches and in Section 3 we describe the proposed deep denoising auto-encoder technique. In Section 4, we mention how we train the model and the experimental conditions and evaluation results are shown in Section 5. Discussions and the summary of our findings are given in Section 6.\n2. RELATED WORK USING DNN AND AUTO-ENCODER\nThis section overviews related work using DNN and/or auto-encoder in the speech information processing field. DNN has been applied for acoustic modelling of speech synthesis. For instance [8] uses DNN to learn the relationship between input texts and the extract features instead of decision tree-based state tying. Restricted Boltzmann machines or deep belief networks have been used for modelling output probabilities of HMM states instead of GMMs [9]. Recurrent neural network or long-short term memory was used for prosody modelling [10] or acoustic trajectory modelling [11].\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use deep denoising auto-encoder for speech synthesis, but, deep auto-encoder based bottleneck features are used by several groups for ASR [12, 13] and deep denoising auto-encoder is also verified for noise-robust ASR [14] or reverberant ASR tasks [15, 16].\nTechniques that are closely related to this paper are a spectral binary coding approach using deep auto-encoder proposed by Deng et al [17] and a speech enhancement approach using deep denoising auto-encoder where they try to reconstruct clean spectrum from noisy spectrum [18]. The approach proposed here is also related to heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis (HLDA) [19, 20] and probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) [21, 22, 23]. Our key idea is however different from these as we use deep auto-encoder based continuous bottleneck features calculated from spectrum to reconstruct high-quality synthetic speech.\n3. AUTO-ENCODER"

      "heading" : "3.1. Basic Auto-encoder",
      "text" : "Auto-encoder is an artificial neural network that is used generally for learning a compressed and distributed representation of a dataset. It consists of the encoder and the decoder. The encoder maps a input\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n05 26\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.S D\n] 1\n7 Ju\nn 20\n15\nvector x to a hidden representation y as follows:\ny = fθ(x) = s(Wx+ b), (1)\nwhere θ = {W,b}. W and b represent a m × n weight matrix and a bias vector of dimensionality m respectively, where n is the dimension of x. The function s is a non-linear transformation on the linear mapping Wx+ b. Frequently s is a sigmoid, a tanh, and a relu function. y, the output of the encoder, is then mapped to z, the output of the decoder. The mapping is performed by a linear function alone that employs a n ×m weight matrix W ′ and a bias vector of dimensionality n as follows:\nz = gθ′(y) = W ′y + b′, (2)\nor a linear mapping followed by a non-linear transformation t,\nz = gθ′(y) = t(W ′y + b′), (3)\nwhere θ′ = {W′,b′}. The weight for the decoding is set as the transpose of the encoding weight [24] in order to allow more layers to be stacked together and be fine-tuned with stochastic gradient descend (SGD).\nIn general, the output z should be interpreted as a function of parameters {θ, θ′} as z = gθ′(fθ(x)). The parameters {θ, θ′} are optimized such that the reconstructed z is as close as possible to the original x and maximizes P (x|z). A typical loss function used is the mean square error (MSE), i.e. L(x, z) = 1\nn |x− z|2."

      "text" : "The denoising auto-encoder is a variant of the basic auto-encoder. It is reported that the denoising auto-encoder can extract features more robustly than the basic auto-encoder [25]. In the denoising auto-encoder, the original data x is first corrupted to x̃ before it is mapped to a higher representation fθ(x̃) by an encoder. The decoder then maps the higher representation to the output z for reconstructing the original x. The denoising auto-encoder is trained such that the reconstructed z is as close as possible to the original data x. Note that it is only during training that the denoising auto-encoder is used to reconstruct the original x from the corrupted x̃."

[26] shows that deeper architecture produces better high-level features compared to the shallow architecture up to 4 encoding and 4 decoding layers. For constructing a deep auto-encoder pre-training is widely used. In pre-training, the number of layers in a deep auto-encoder increases twice as compare to a deep neural network (DNN) when stacking each pre-trained unit. It is reported that fine-tuning with back-propagation through a deep auto-encoder is ineffective due to vanishing gradients at the lower layers [27]. To over come this issue we restrict the decoding weight as the transpose of the encoding weight following [24], that is, W′ = WT where WT denotes transpose of W. We describe the detail of training a deep auto-encoder in the next session.\n4. TRAINING A DEEP DENOISING AUTO-ENCODER"

We have evaluated the proposed auto-encoder method in the context of analysis-by-synthesis condition and text-to-speech conditions.

For comparison of the proposed method, we extracted mel-cepstral coefficients that use the same dimensions as that of auto-encoder. All other acoustic features such as log F0 and 25 aperiodicity band energies are the same for all the systems."

The training subset was used as training data for building the auto-encoder, the validation subset was used as a stopping criteria during training to prevent overfitting, and the test subset was used for measuring log-spectral distortion and listening test.\nFigure 4 shows the original and reconstructed spectra using each technique (mel-cepstral analysis, deep auto-encoder, deep denoising auto-encoder). We can clearly see that the deep auto-encoders reconstruct high-frequency parts more precisely than mel-cepstral analysis. Figure 5 shows log spectral distortion between the original spectra and reconstructed spectra, calculated on the test subset. We can observe that the deep auto-encoder has reduced the distortion significantly compared to the mel-cepstral analysis and denoising version further reduced the distortion. Figure 6 shows subjective preference scores of these methods. The number of listeners\nthat performed this test were seven. They have participated in two preference tests. In the first preference test, they were asked to compare deep auto-encoder (DA) with mel-cepstral analysis (MCEP). In the second preference test, they were asked to compare deep autoencoder with deep denoising autoencoder (DDA). From the figure, we can see that deep auto-encoder based speech samples sound more natural than mel-cesptral analysis based speech samples. Deep denoising auto-encoder reduced the distortion, however, perceptual difference between clean and denoising auto-encoder is not statistically significant."

For the HMM-based speech synthesis, we have used a hidden semi-Markov model and the observation vectors for the spectral and excitation parameters contained static, delta and delta-delta values, with one stream for the spectrum, three streams for F0 and one for the bandlimited aperiodicity. The context-dependnet labels are built using the\npronunciation lexicon Combilex [30]. For the DNN-based speech synthesis, we have trained a five-hidden-layer DNN for mapping between linguistic contexts and auto-encoder-based or mel-cepstral acoustic features. The number of units in each of the hidden layers was set to 512. Random initialisation was used in a similar way to [8]. Figure 7 shows subjective preference scores where we have compared the proposed auto-encoder feature with the conventional mel-cepstral feature in each of the HMM-based speech synthesis and the DNN-based speech synthesis systems. Listeners are the same as those for Figure 6. We can see that synthetic speech using the proposed feature sound more natural than the conventional mel-cepstral features in both the synthesis methods. The proposed feature seems to suit the DNN-based speech synthesis better, but, this requires further investigation.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have proposed the deep denoising auto-encoder technique to extract better acoustic features for speech synthesis. We have compared the new stochastic feature extractor with the conventional mel-cepstral analysis in the analysis-by-synthesis and text-tospeech experiments and have confirmed that the proposed method can increase the quality of synthetic speech in both the conditions.\nOur future work includes the improvement of the deep denoising auto-encoder. In this paper, we have used the simplest noise, i.e. masking and the improvement was observed only from objective evaluation. We shall use or design different types of noises to improve the deep denoising auto-encoder for speech synthesis further.\n7. REFERENCES\n[1] H. Zen, K. Tokuda, and A. W.
