      "text" : "language interface allows users to communicate fluently with a computer system with very little preparation. Databases are often hard to use in cooperating with the users because of their rigid interface. A good NLIDB allows a user to enter commands and ask questions in native language and then after interpreting respond to the user in native language. For a large number of applications requiring interaction between humans and the computer systems, it would be convenient to provide the end-user friendly interface. Punjabi language interface to database would proof fruitful to native people of Punjab, as it provides ease to them to use various e-governance applications like Punjab Sewa, Suwidha, Online Public Utility Forms, Online Grievance Cell, Land Records Management System, legacy matters, e-District, agriculture, etc. Punjabi is the mother tongue of more than 110 million people all around the world. According to available information, Punjabi ranks 10 th from top out of a total of 6,900 languages recognized internationally by the United Nations. This paper covers a brief overview of the Natural language interface to database, its different components, its advantages, disadvantages, approaches and techniques used. The paper ends with the work done on Punjabi language interface to database and future enhancements that can be done."

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "A natural language interface to a database (NLIDB) is a system that translates a sentence in natural language (e.g. Punjabi) into a database query. (Androutsopoulos et al.,1995 [1] ) .NLIDB bridge the gap between the languages used by humans and the computer systems as by using this, a person with no knowledge of database languages can easily and conveniently access the database. NLIDB can be considered as a classical problem in the field of natural language processing. [11] A person with no knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL) may find himself or herself handicapped while\nextracting data from a Data Base Management System (DBMS) such as MS Access, Oracle and others. Therefore, Companies like Elfsoft(English Language Frontend Software) has developed SQL Tutor for people to interact with the database in simple English instead of learning the syntax of the query language. These products make the extraction from databases much easier. Therefore, the uses of the natural languages save time to learn the rigid syntax of query languages. NLIDB belong to the domain of information extraction as after grasping the input sentence, it extracts the requested information from data stores."

This approach is based on statistical analysis as well as other data driven analysis, of raw data which is in the form of text corpora. The empirical or corpus based methods automate the acquisition of much of the complex knowledge required for NLP by training on suitably annotated natural language corpora, e.g. tree-banks of parsed sentences. Various statistical techniques like hidden Markov models, probabilistic context free grammars etc are employed by most of the empirical NLP methods."

      "text" : "Since human language capabilities are based\non neural network in the brain, Artificial Neural Network provides on essential starting point for modeling language processing. Instead of symbols, the approach is based on distributed representations that correspond to statistical regularities in language. However, there has been relatively little recent language research using sub-symbolic learning, although some recent systems have successfully employed decision trees transformation rules and other symbolic methods. SHRUTI system developed by John Carter Wendelken is a neutrally inspired system for event modeling and temporal processing at a connectionist level."

Syntax-based systems use a grammar that describes the possible syntactic structures of the user’s questions. The main advantage of using syntax based approaches is that they provide detailed information about the structure of a sentence. Eg: LUNAR system. [1]"

The main drawback of this approach is it requires some prior- knowledge of the elements in the domain, therefore making it difficult to port to other domains. A parse tree in this system has specific structures and unique node labels, which could hardly be useful for other applications. Eg: LADDER system. [6]"

The logical query is then translated to an expression in the database’s query language, and evaluated against the database.(SQL)\nExample of intermediate representation language architecture is Masque/sql[1]."

It is domain dependent and uses only few tables and simple selection queries. In future, the existing Punjabi language interface to database system developed by Thapar University, Patiala [3] can be extended to perform the following tasks:\n It can execute Queries that involves joining\nof tables and handle various clauses\n It can be made domain independent\n It can be extended to handle more complex\nqueries\n Development of an interface for administrator\n This existing system accepts queries only in a\nparticular format. So to make the system to\naccept all the queries, we can use Punjabi\nparser"
