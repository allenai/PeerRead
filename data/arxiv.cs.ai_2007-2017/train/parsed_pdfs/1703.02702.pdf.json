While this training data can be easily obtained for tasks like games (e.g., Doom, Montezuma’s Revenge) (Mnih et al., 2015), data-collection and policy learning for real-world physical tasks are significantly more challenging.\nThere are two possible ways to perform policy learning for real-world physical tasks:\n• Real-world Policy Learning: The first approach is to learn the agent’s policy in the real-world. However, training in the real-world is too expensive, dangerous and time-intensive leading to scarcity of data. Due to scarcity of data, training is often restricted to a limited set of training scenarios, causing overfitting. If the test scenario is different (e.g., different friction coefficient), the learned policy fails to generalize. Therefore, we need a learned policy that is robust and generalizes well across a range of scenarios. • Learning in simulation: One way of escaping the data scarcity in the real-world is to transfer a policy learned in a simulator to the real world. However the environment and physics of the simulator are not exactly the same as the real world. This reality gap often results in unsuccessful transfer if the learned policy isn’t robust to modeling errors (Christiano et al., 2016; Rusu et al., 2016).\nBoth the test-generalization and simulation-transfer issues are further exacerbated by the fact that many policylearning algorithms are stochastic in nature. For many hard physical tasks such as Walker2D (Brockman et al., 2016), only a small fraction of runs leads to stable walking policies. This makes these approaches even more time and data-intensive. What we need is an approach that is significantly more stable/robust in learning policies across different runs and initializations while requiring less data during training.\nSo, how can we model uncertainties and learn a policy robust to all uncertainties? How can we model the gap between simulations and real-world? We begin with the insight that modeling errors can be viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system (Başar & Bernhard, 2008). For example, high friction at test time might be modeled as extra forces at contact points against the direction of motion. Inspired by this observation, this paper\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n02 70\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 8\nM ar\n2 01\n7\nproposes the idea of modeling uncertainties via an adversarial agent that applies disturbance forces to the system. Moreover, the adversary is reinforced – that is, it learns an optimal policy to thwart the original agent’s goal. Our proposed method, Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (RARL), jointly trains a pair of agents, a protagonist and an adversary, where the protagonist learns to fulfil the original task goals while being robust to the disruptions generated by its adversary.\nWe perform extensive experiments to evaluate RARL on multiple OpenAI gym environments like InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah, Swimmer, Hopper and Walker2d (see Figure 1). We demonstrate that our proposed approach is: (a) Robust to model initializations: The learned policy performs better given different model parameter initializations and random seeds. This alleviates the data scarcity issue by reducing sensitivity of learning. (b) Robust to modeling errors and uncertainties: The learned policy generalizes significantly better to different test environment settings (e.g., with different mass and friction values)."

      "text" : "Our goal is to learn a policy that is robust to modeling errors in simulation or mismatch between training and test scenarios. For example, we would like to learn policy for Walker2D that works not only on carpet (training scenario) but also generalizes to walking on ice (test scenario). Similarly, other parameters such as the mass of the walker might vary during training and test. One possibility is to list all such parameters (mass, friction etc.) and learn an ensemble of policies for different possible variations (Rajeswaran et al., 2016). But explicit consideration of all possible parameters of how simulation and real world might differ or what parameters can change between training/test is infeasible.\nOur core idea is to model the differences during training and test scenarios via extra forces/disturbances in the system. Our hypothesis is that if we can learn a policy that\nis robust to all disturbances, then this policy will be robust to changes in training/test situations; and hence generalize well. But is it possible to sample trajectories under all possible disturbances? In unconstrained scenarios, the space of possible disturbances could be larger than the space of possible actions, which makes sampled trajectories even sparser in the joint space.\nTo overcome this problem, we advocate a two-pronged approach:\n(a) Adversarial agents for modeling disturbances: Instead of sampling all possible disturbances, we jointly train a second agent (termed the adversary), whose goal is to impede the original agent (termed the protagonist) by applying destabilizing forces. The adversary is rewarded only for the failure of the protagonist. Therefore, the adversary learns to sample hard examples: disturbances which will make original agent fail; the protagonist learns a policy that is robust to any disturbances created by the adversary.\n(b) Adversaries that incorporate domain knowledge: The naive way of developing an adversary would be to simply give it the same action space as the protagonist – like a driving student and driving instructor fighting for control of a dual-control car. However, our proposed approach is much richer and is not limited to symmetric action spaces – we can exploit domain knowledge to: focus the adversary on the protagonist’s weak points; and since the adversary is in a simulated environment, we can give the adversary “super-powers” – the ability to affect the robot or environment in ways the protagonist cannot (e.g., suddenly change a physical parameter like frictional coefficient or mass)."

      "text" : "Our goal is to learn the policy of the protagonist (denoted by µ) such that it is better (higher reward) and robust (generalizes better to variations in test settings). In the standard reinforcement learning setting, for a given transition function P , we can learn policy parameters θµ such that the expected reward is maximized where expected reward for policy µ from the start s0 is\nρ(µ; θµ,P) = E [ T∑ t=0 γtr(st, at)|s0, µ,P ] . (1)\nNote that in this formulation the expected reward is conditioned on the transition function since the the transition function defines the roll-out of states. In standard-RL settings, the transition function is fixed (since the physics engine and parameters such as mass, friction are fixed). However, in our setting, we assume that the transition function will have modeling errors and that there will be differences between training and test conditions. Therefore, in our general setting, we should estimate policy parameters θµ such that we maximize the expected reward over different possi-\nble transition functions as well. Therefore,\nρ(µ; θµ) = E P\n[ E [ T∑ t=0 γtr(st, at)|s0, µ,P ]] . (2)\nOptimizing for the expected reward over all transition functions optimizes mean performance, which is a risk neutral formulation that assumes a known distribution over model parameters. A large fraction of policies learned under such a formulation are likely to fail in a different environment. Instead, inspired by work in robust control (Tamar et al., 2014; Rajeswaran et al., 2016), we choose to optimize for conditional value at risk (CVaR):\nρRC = E [ρ|ρ ≤ Qα(ρ)] (3)\nwhere Qα(ρ) is the α-quantile of ρ-values. Intuitively, in robust control, we want to maximize the worst-possible ρvalues. But how do you tractably sample trajectories that are in worst α-percentile? Approaches like EP-Opt (Rajeswaran et al., 2016) sample these worst percentile trajectories by changing parameters such as friction, mass of objects, etc. during rollouts.\nInstead, we introduce an adversarial agent that applies forces on pre-defined locations, and this agent tries to change the trajectories such that reward of the protagonist is minimized. Note that since the adversary tries to minimize the protagonist’s reward, it ends up sampling trajectories from worst-percentile leading to robust controllearning for the protagonist. If the adversary is kept fixed, the protagonist could learn to overfit to its adversarial actions. Therefore, instead of using either a random or a fixed-adversary, we advocate generating the adversarial actions using a learned policy ν. We would also like to point out the connection between our proposed approach and the practice of hard-example mining (Sung & Poggio, 1994; Shrivastava et al., 2016). The adversary in RARL learns to sample hard-examples (worst-trajectories) for the protagonist to learn. Finally, instead of using α as percentileparameter, RARL is parameterized by the magnitude of force available to the adversary. As the adversary becomes stronger, RARL optimizes for lower percentiles. However, very high magnitude forces lead to very biased sampling and make the learning unstable. In the extreme case, an unreasonably strong adversary can always prevent the protagonist from achieving the task. Analogously, the traditional RL baseline is equivalent to training with an impotent (zero strength) adversary."

      "text" : "In our adversarial game, at every timestep t both players observe the state st and take actions a1t ∼ µ(st) and a2t ∼ ν(st). The state transitions st+1 = P(st, a1t , a2t )\nand a reward rt = r(st, a1t , a 2 t ) is obtained from the environment. In our zero-sum game, the protagonist gets a reward r1t = rt while the adversary gets a reward r 2 t = −rt. Hence each step of this MDP can be represented as (st, a 1 t , a 2 t , r 1 t , r 2 t , st+1).\nThe protagonist seeks to maximize the following reward function,\nR1 = Es0∼ρ,a1∼µ(s),a2∼ν(s)[ T−1∑ t=0 r1(s, a1, a2)]. (4)\nSince, the policies µ and ν are the only learnable components, R1 ≡ R1(µ, ν). Similarly the adversary attempts to maximize its own reward: R2 ≡ R2(µ, ν) = −R1(µ, ν). One way to solve this MDP game is by discretizing the continuous state and action spaces and using dynamic programming to solve. (Perolat et al., 2015; Patek, 1997) show that notions of minimax equilibrium and Nash equilibrium are equivalent for this game with optimal equilibrium reward:\nR1∗ = min ν max µ R1(µ, ν) = max µ min ν R1(µ, ν) (5)\nHowever solutions to finding the Nash equilibria strategies often involve greedily solving N minimax equilibria for a zero-sum matrix game, with N equal to the number of observed datapoints. The complexity of this greedy solution is exponential in the cardinality of the action spaces, which makes it prohibitive (Perolat et al., 2015).\nMost Markov Game approaches require solving for the equilibrium solution for a multiplayer value or minimax-Q function at each iteration. This requires evaluating a typically intractable minimax optimization problem. Instead, we focus on learning stationary policies µ∗ and ν∗ such that R1(µ∗, ν∗)→ R1∗. This way we can avoid this costly optimization at each iteration as we just need to approximate the advantage function and not determine the equilibrium solution at each iteration."

Similarly, when the cart is moving swiftly and the pole is vertical (bottom row), the adversary applies a force in the direction of the cart’s motion. The pole will fall unless the cart speeds up further (which can also cause the cart to go out of bounds). Note that the naive policy of pushing in the opposite direction would be less effective since the protagonist could slow the cart to stabilize the pole.\nSimilarly for the Hopper task in Figure 9, the adversary applies horizontal forces to impede the motion when the Hopper is in the air (left) while applying forces to counteract gravity and reduce friction when the Hopper is interacting with the ground (right)."

An overview of recent advances in deep RL is presented in (Li, 2017) and (Kaelbling et al., 1996; Kober & Peters, 2012) provide a comprehensive history of RL research.\nLearned policies should be robust to uncertainty and parameter variation to ensure predicable behavior, which is essential for many practical applications of RL including robotics. Furthermore, the process of learning policies should employ safe and effective exploration with improved sample efficiency to reduce risk of costly failure. These issues have long been recognized and investigated in reinforcement learning (Garcıa & Fernández, 2015) and have an even longer history in control theory research\n(Zhou & Doyle, 1998). These issues are exacerbated in deep RL by using neural networks, which while more expressible and flexible, often require significantly more data to train and produce potentially unstable policies.\nIn terms of (Garcıa & Fernández, 2015) taxonomy, our approach lies in the class of worst-case formulations. We model the problem as an H∞ optimal control problem (Başar & Bernhard, 2008). In this formulation, nature (which may represent input, transition or model uncertainty) is treated as an adversary in a continuous dynamic zero-sum game. We attempt to find the minimax solution to the reward optimization problem. This formulation was introduced as robust RL (RRL) in (Morimoto & Doya, 2005). RRL proposes a model-free an actor-disturber-critic method. Solving for the optimal strategy for general nonlinear systems requires is often analytically infeasible for most problems. To address this, we extend RRL’s modelfree formulation using deep RL via TRPO (Schulman et al., 2015) with neural networks as the function approximator.\nOther worst-case formulations have been introduced. (Nilim & El Ghaoui, 2005) solve finite horizon tabular MDPs using a minimax form of dynamic programming. Using a similar game theoretic formulation (Littman, 1994) introduces the notion of a Markov Game to solve tabular problems, which involves linear program (LP) to solve the game optimization problem. (Sharma & Gopal, 2007) extend the Markov game formulation using a trained neural network for the policy and approximating the game to continue using LP to solve the game. (Wiesemann et al., 2013) present an enhancement to standard MDP that provides probabilistic guarantees to unknown model parameters. Other approaches are risk-based including (Tamar et al., 2014; Delage & Mannor, 2010), which formulate various mechanisms of percentile risk into the formulation. Our approach focuses on continuous space problems and is a model-free approach that requires explicit parametric formulation of model uncertainty.\nAdversarial methods have been used in other learning problems including (Goodfellow et al., 2015), which leverages adversarial examples to train a more robust classifiers and (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Dumoulin et al., 2016), which uses an adversarial lost function for a discriminator to train a generative model. In (Pinto et al., 2016) two supervised agents were trained with one acting as an adversary for selfsupervised learning which showed improved robot grasping. Other adversarial multiplayer approaches have been proposed including (Heinrich & Silver, 2016) to perform self-play or fictitious play. Refer to (Buşoniu et al., 2010) for an review of multiagent RL techniques.\nRecent deep RL approaches to the problem focus on explicit parametric model uncertainty.

    "abstractText" : "Deep neural networks coupled with fast simulation and improved computation have led to recent successes in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). However, most current RL-based approaches fail to generalize since: (a) the gap between simulation and real world is so large that policy-learning approaches fail to transfer; (b) even if policy learning is done in real world, the data scarcity leads to failed generalization from training to test scenarios (e.g., due to different friction or object masses). Inspired from H∞ control methods, we note that both modeling errors and differences in training and test scenarios can be viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper proposes the idea of robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), where we train an agent to operate in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that applies disturbance forces to the system. The jointly trained adversary is reinforced – that is, it learns an optimal destabilization policy. We formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum, minimax objective function. Extensive experiments in multiple environments (InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah, Swimmer, Hopper and Walker2d) conclusively demonstrate that our method (a) improves training stability; (b) is robust to differences in training/test conditions; and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of the adversary.",
