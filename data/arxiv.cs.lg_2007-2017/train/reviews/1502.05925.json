We propose a novel random forest algorithm to minimize prediction error for a user-specified {\\it average} feature acquisition budget. While random forests yield strong generalization performance, they do not explicitly account for feature costs and furthermore require low correlation among trees, which amplifies costs. Our random forest grows trees with low acquisition cost and high strength based on greedy minimax cost-weighted-impurity splits. Theoretically, we establish near-optimal acquisition cost guarantees for our algorithm. Empirically, on a number of benchmark datasets we demonstrate superior accuracy-cost curves against state-of-the-art prediction-time algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Feb 2015 16:42:40 GMT  (530kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05925v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["feng nan", "joseph wang", "venkatesh saligrama"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.05925"}
