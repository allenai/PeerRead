      "text" : "Introduction With the growing of large collection of electronic texts, much attention has been given to topic modeling of textual corpora, designed to identify representations of the data and learn thematic structure from large document collections without human supervision. Topic models have been applied to a variety of applications, including information retrieval (Wei and Croft 2006), collaborative filtering (Marlin 2003), authorship identification (Rosen-Zvi et al. 2004) and opinion extraction (Lin et al. 2012), etc. Existing topic models (Griffiths and Tenenbaum 2004; Mcauliffe and Blei 2008; Blei 2012) are built based on the assumption that each document is represented by a mixture of topics, where each topic defines a probability distribution over words. These models, including the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann 1999) model and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003) model, can be viewed as graphical models with latent variables. Some nonparametric extensions to these models have also been quite successful (Teh et al. 2006; Steyvers and Griffiths 2007).\nNevertheless, exact inference for these model is computationally hard, so one has to resort to slow or inaccurate approximations to compute the posterior distribution over topics. New undirected graphical model approaches, including the Replicated softmax model (Hinton and Salakhutdinov 2009), are also successfully applied to exploring the topics of the text, and in particular cases they outperform LDA (Srivastava, Salakhutdinov, and Hinton 2013).\nA major limitation of these topic models and many of their extensions is the bag-of-word assumption, which assumes that document can be fully characterized by bag-ofword features. This assumption is favorable in the computational point of view, but loses the ordering of the words and cannot properly capture the semantics of the context. For example, the phrases “the department chair couches offers” and “the chair department offers couches” have the same unigram statistics, but are about quite different topics. When deciding which topic generated the word “chair” in the first sentence, knowing that it was immediately preceded by the word “department” makes it much more likely to have been generated by a topic that assigns high probability to words related to university administration (Wallach 2006).\nThere has been little work on developing topic models where the order of words is taken into consideration. To remove the assumption that the order of words is negligible, Gruber, Weiss, and Rosen-Zvi (2007) propose modeling the topics of words in the document via a Markov chain. Wallach (2006) explores a hierarchical generative probabilistic model that incorporates both n-gram statistics and latent topic variables. Even though they consider the order of words to some extent, their model is still not capable of characterizing the semantics of words. For example, the integer representation of the words “teacher” and “teach” are completely unrelated, even if we know they have strong semantic connections and are very likely belonging to the same topic. To seek a distributed way of representing words that capture semantic similarities, several Neural Probabilistic Language Models (NPLMs) have been proposed (Mnih and Hinton 2009; Mnih and Teh 2012; Mnih and Kavukcuoglu 2013; Mikolov et al. 2013; Le and Mikolov 2014). Nevertheless, the dense word embeddings learned by previous NPLMs cannot be directly interpreted as topics. This is because that word embeddings are usually considered opaque, in the sense that it is difficult to assign meanings to the the vector ar X iv :1 50 2.\n03 63\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n2 Fe\nb 20\n15\nrepresentation. In this paper, we proposed a novel topic model called the Gaussian Mixture Neural Topic Model (GMNTM). The work is inspired by the recent neural probabilistic language models (Mnih and Hinton 2009; Mnih and Teh 2012; Mnih and Kavukcuoglu 2013; Mikolov et al. 2013; Le and Mikolov 2014). We represent the topic model as a Gaussian mixture model of vectors which encode words, sentences and documents. Each mixture component is associated with a specific topic. We present a method that jointly learns the topic model and the vector representation. As in NPLM methods, the word embeddings are learnt to optimize the predictability of a word using its surrounding words, with an important constraint that the vector representations are sampled from the Gaussian mixture which represents topics. Because the semantic meaning of sentences and documents are incorporated to infer the topic of a specific word, in our model, words with similar semantics are more likely to be clustered into the same topic, and topics of sentences and documents are more accurately learned. It potentially overcomes the weaknesses of the bag-of-word method and the bag-of-n-grams method, both of which don’t use the order of words or the semantic of the context. We conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model on two widely used publicly available datasets. The experiment results show that our model substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of perplexity, document retrieval quality and document classification accuracy."

      "text" : "In the past decade, a great variety of topic models have been proposed, which can extract interesting topics in the form of multinomial distributions automatically from texts (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003; Griffiths and Tenenbaum 2004; Blei 2012; Gruber, Weiss, and Rosen-Zvi 2007; Hinton and Salakhutdinov 2009). Among these approaches, LDA (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003) and its variants are the most popular models for topic modeling. The mixture of topics per document in the LDA model is generated from a Dirichlet prior mutual to all documents in the corpus. Different extensions of the LDA model have been proposed. For example, Teh et al. (2006) assumes that the number of mixture components is unknown a prior and is to be inferred from the data. Mcauliffe and Blei (2008) develops a supervised latent Dirichlet allocation model (sLDA) for document-response pairs. Recent work incorporates context information into the topic modeling, such as time (Wang and McCallum 2006), geographic location (Mei et al. 2006), authorship (Steyvers et al. 2004), and sentiment (Yang et al. 2014b; 2014a), to make topic models fit expectations better.\nRecently, there are several undirected graphical models being proposed, which typically outperform LDA. Mcauliffe and Blei (2008) present a two-layer undirected graphical model, called “Replicated Softmax”, that can be used to model and automatically extract low-dimensional latent semantic representations from a large unstructured collection of document. Hinton and Salakhutdinov (2009) extend “Replicated Softmax” by adding another layer of hidden\nunits on top of the first with bipartite undirected connections. Neural network based approaches, such as Neural Autoregressive Density Estimators (DocNADE) (Larochelle and Lauly 2012) and Hybrid Neural Network-Latent Topic Model (Wan, Zhu, and Fergus 2012), are also shown outperforming the LDA model.\nHowever, all of these these topic models employ the bagof-words assumption, which is rarely true in practice. The bag-of-word assumption loses the ordering of the words and ignore the semantics of the context. There are several previous literature taking the order of words into account. Wallach (2006) explores a hierarchical generative probabilistic model that incorporates both n-gram statistics and latent topic variables. They extend a unigram topic model so that it can reflect properties of a hierarchical Dirichlet bigram model. Gruber, Weiss, and Rosen-Zvi (2007) propose modeling the topic of words a Markov chain. Florez and Nachman (2014) exploits the semantics regularities captured by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in text documents to build a recommender system. Although these methods captures the ordering of words, none of them them consider the semantics, thus they cannot capture the semantic similarities between words such as “teach” and “teacher”. In contrast, our model is inspired by the recent work in learning vector representations of words which are proved to capture the semantics of texts (Mnih and Hinton 2009; Mnih and Teh 2012; Mnih and Kavukcuoglu 2013; Mikolov et al. 2013; Le and Mikolov 2014). Our topic model captures both the ordering of words and the semantics of the context. As a consequence, semantically similar words are more likely having similar topic distribution (e.g., “Jesus” and “Christ” )."

      "text" : "We assume there are W different words in the vocabulary and there are D documents in corpus. For each word w ∈ {1, . . . ,W} in vocabulary, there is an associated V - dimensional vector representation vec(w) ∈ RV for the word. Each document in corpus with index d ∈ {1, . . . , D} also has a vector representation vec(d) ∈ RV . If all the documents contain S sentences, then these sentences are indexed by s ∈ {1, . . . , S}. The sentence with index s is associated with a vector representation vec(s) ∈ RV .\nThere are T topics in the GMNTM model, where T is designated by the user. Each topic corresponds to a Gaussian mixture component. The k-th topic is represented by a V -dimensional Gaussian distribution N (µk,Σk) with mixture weight πk ∈ R, where µk ∈ RV , Σk ∈ RV×V , and∑T\nk=1 πk = 1. The parameters of the Gaussian mixture model are collectively represented by\nλ = {πk, µk,Σk} k = 1, . . . , T (1)\nGiven the collection of parameters, we use\np(x|λ) = T∑\ni=1\nπiN (x|µi,Σi) (2)\nto represent the probability distribution for sampling a vector x from the Gaussian mixture model.\nWe describe the procedure that the corpus is generated. Given the Gaussian mixture model λ, the generative process is described as follow: for each word w in the vocabulary, we sample its topic z(w) from the multinomial distribution π := (π1, π2, . . . , πT ) and sample its vector representation vec(w) from distribution N (µz(w),Σz(w)). Equivalently, the vector vec(w) is sampled from the Gaussian mixture model parameterized by λ. For each document d and each sentence s in the document, we sample their topics z(d), z(s) from distribution π and sample their vector representations, namely vec(d) and vec(s), also from the Gaussian mixture model. Let Ψ be the collection of latent vectors associated with all the words, sentences and documents in the corpus,\nΨ := {vec(w)} ∪ {vec(d)} ∪ {vec(s)} (3)\nFor each word slot in the sentence, its word realization is generated according to the document’s vector vec(d), the current sentence’s vector vec(s) as well as at most m previous words in the same sentence. Formally, for the i-th location in the sentence, we represent its word realization by wi. The probability distribution of wi is defined by:\np (wi = w|d, s, wi−m, . . . , wi−1)\n∝ exp(awdoc + awsen + m∑ t=1 awt + b) (4)\nwhere adoc, asen and at are influences from the document, the sentence and the previous word, respectively. They are defined by\nawdoc = 〈uwdoc, vec(d)〉 (5) awsen = 〈uwsen, vec(s)〉 (6) awt = 〈uwt , vec(wi−t)〉 (7)\nHere, uwdoc, u w sen, u w t ∈ RV are parameters of the model, and they are shared across all slots in the corpus. We use U to represent this collection of vectors,\nU := {udoc, usen} ∪ {ut|t ∈ 1, 2, . . . ,m}} (8)\nCombining the equations above, the probability distribution of wi is defined by a multi-class logistic model, where the features come from the vectors associated with the document, the sentence and the m previous words. By estimating the model parameters, we learn the word representations that make one word predictable from its previous words and the context. Jointly, we learn the distribution of topics that words, sentences and documents belong to.\nGiven the model parameters and the vectors for documents, sentences and words, we can infer the posterior probability distribution of topics. In particular, for a document d with vector representation vec(d), the posterior distribution\nof its topic, namely q(z(d)), is easy to calculate. For any z ∈ 1, 2, . . . , T , we have\nq(z(d) = z) = πzN (vec(d)|µz,Σz)∑T\nk=1 πkN (vec(d)|µk,Σk) . (9)\nSimilarly, for each sentence s in the document d, the posterior distribution of its topic is\nq(z(s) = z) = πzN (vec(s)|µz,Σz)∑T\nk=1 πkN (vec(s)|µk,Σk) . (10)\nFor each word w in the vocabulary, the posterior distribution of its topic is similarly calculated as\nq(z(w) = z) = πzN (vec(w)|µz,Σz)∑T\nk=1 πkN (vec(w)|µk,Σk) (11)\nFinally, for each word slot in the document, we also want to explore its topic. Since the topic of a particular location in the document is affected by its word realization and the sentence/document it belongs to, we define the probability of it belonging to topic z proportional to the product of q(z(w) = z), q(z(s) = z) and q(z(d) = z), where w, s, and d are the word, the sentence and the document that this word slot associates with."

      "text" : "We estimate the model parameters λ, U and Ψ by maximizing the likelihood of the generative model. The parameter estimation consists of two stages. In Stage I, we maximize the likelihood of the model with respect to λ. Since λ characterizes a Gaussian mixture model, this procedure can be implemented by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. In Stage II, we maximize the model likelihood with respect to U and Ψ , this procedure can be implemented by stochastic gradient descent. We alternatively execute Stage I and Stage II until the parameters converge. The algorithm in this section is summarized in Algorithm 1.\nStage I: Estimating λ In this stage, the latent vector of words, sentences and documents are fixed. We estimate the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model λ = {πk, µk,Σk}. This is a classical statistical estimation problem which can be solved by running the EM algorithm. The reader can refer to the book (Bishop 2006) for the implementation details.\nStage II: estimatingU and Ψ When λ is known and fixed, we estimate the model parameters U and the latent vectors Ψ by maximizing the log-likelihood of the generative model. In particular, we iteratively sample a location in the corpus, and consider the log-likelihood of the observed word at this location. Let the word realization at location i be represented by wi. The log-likelihood of this location is equal to\nJi(U, Ψ) = log(p(Ψ |λ)) + awidoc + a wi sen + m∑ t=1 awit + b\n− log (∑\nw\nexp(awdoc + a w sen + m∑ t=1 awt + b) ) (12)\nAlgorithm 1 Inference Algorithm • Inputs: A corpus containing D documents, S sentences,\nand a vocabulary containing W distinct words • Initialize parameters\n– Randomly initialize the vectors Ψ . – Initialize parameters U with all-zero vectors. – Initialize Gaussian mixture model parameters with the\nstandard normal distribution N (0,diag(1)). • Repeat until converge\n– Fixing parameters U and Ψ , run the EM algorithm to estimate the Gaussian mixture model parameters λ.\n– Fixing the Gaussian mixture model λ, run stochastic gradient descent to maximize the log-likelihood of the model with respect to parameters U and Ψ .\nwhere p(Ψ |λ) is the prior distribution of parameter Ψ in the Gaussian mixture model, defined by equation (2). The quantities awdoc, a w sen and a w t are defined in equations (5), (6), and (7). The objective function Ji(U, Ψ) involves all parameters in the collections (U, Ψ). Taking the computation efficiency into consideration, we only update the parameters associated with the word wi. Concretely, we update\nvec(wi)← vec(wi) + α ∂Ji(U, Ψ)\n∂vec(wi) (13)\nuwit ← u wi t + α\n∂Ji(U, Ψ)\n∂uwit (14)\nwith α as the learning rate. Similarly, we update vec(s), vec(d) and uwdoc, u w sen using the same gradient step, as they are parameters associated with the current sentence and the current document. Once the gradient update is accomplished, we sample another location to continue the update. The procedure terminates when there are sufficient number of updates performed, so that bothU and Ψ converge to fixed values."

For the RCV1-v2 data set, we use independent logistic regression for each label. The evaluation metric is Mean Average Precision.\nWe summarize the experiment results with 128 topics in Table 3.

Our model further improves the classification result to 73.1%. On RCV1-v2 dataset, we observe the similar results. The mean average precision increases from 0.401 (Over-Replicated Softmax) to 0.445 (our model).\nQualitative inspection of topic specialization\nSince topic models are often used for the exploratory analysis of unlabeled text, we also evaluate whether meaningful semantics are captured by our model. Due to the space limit, we only illustrate four topics extracted by our model and LDA which are topics about religion, space, sports and security. These topics are also captured as (sub)categories in the 20 Newsgroups dataset. Table 3 shows the 4 topics learnt by the GMNTM model and the corresponding topics learnt by LDA. In each topic, we visualize it using 10 words with the largest weights. The 4 topics shown in Table 3 for both models are easy for interpretation according to the top words. However, we see that the topics found by the two models are different in nature. GMNTM finds topics that consist of the words that are consecutive in the document or the words having similar semantics. For example, in the GMNTM model, “Christ” and “christian” share the same topics, mainly because they have strong semantic connections, even though they don’t co-occur that often, which makes LDA unable to put them in the same topic. On the other hand, LDA often find some general words such as “would” and “accept” for the religion topic, which are unhelpful for interpreting the topics."

The model learns better topics and disambiguates words that belong to different topics. Comparing to state-of-the-art topic modeling approaches, the GMNTM outperforms in terms of perplexity, retrieval accuracy and classification accuracy.\nIn future works, we will explore using non-parametric\nmodels to cluster word vectors. For example, we look forward to incoporating infinite Dirichelet process to automatically detect the number of topics. We can also use hierarchical model to further capture the subtle semantics of the text. As another promising direction, we consider building topic models on popular neural probabilistic methods, such as the Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNNLM). The GMNTM model has appplications to several tasks in natural language processing, including entity recognition, information extraction and sentiment analysis.

Mcauliffe and Blei (2008) develops a supervised latent Dirichlet allocation model (sLDA) for document-response pairs.",

In most previous work, the “bag-of-words” assumption is usually made which ignores the ordering of words. This assumption simplifies the computation, but it unrealistically loses the ordering information and the semantic of words in the context. In this paper, we present a Gaussian Mixture Neural Topic Model (GMNTM) which incorporates both the ordering of words and the semantic meaning of sentences into topic modeling. Specifically, we represent each topic as a cluster of multi-dimensional vectors and embed the corpus into a collection of vectors generated by the Gaussian mixture model. Each word is affected not only by its topic, but also by the embedding vector of its surrounding words and the context. The Gaussian mixture components and the topic of documents, sentences and words can be learnt jointly. Extensive experiments show that our model can learn better topics and more accurate word distributions for each topic. Quantitatively, comparing to state-of-the-art topic modeling approaches, GMNTM obtains significantly better performance in terms of perplexity, retrieval accuracy and classification accuracy.",
