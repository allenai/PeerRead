      "text" : "Given a embedding model mapping words to n dimensional vectors, every document can be represented as a finite subset of Rn. Comparing documents then amounts to comparing such subsets. While previous work shows that the Earth Mover’s Distance (Kusner et al., 2015) or distance between the weighted average of word vectors (Arora et al., 2017) provides information that is useful for classification tasks, we wish to go a step further and investigate whether useful information can also be found in the ‘shape’ of a document in word embedding space.\nPersistent homology is a tool from algebraic topology used to compute topological signatures (called persistence diagrams) on compact metric\n∗*The indicated authors contributed equally to this work.\nspaces. These have the property of being stable with respect to the Gromov-Haussdorff distance (Gromov et al., 1981). In other words, compact metric spaces that are close, up to an isometry, will have similar embeddings. In this work, we examine the utility of such embeddings in text classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has been performed on using topological representations for traditional NLP tasks, nor has any comparison been made with state-ofthe-art approaches.\nWe begin by considering a document as the set of its word vectors, generated with a pretrained word embedding model. These form the metric space on which we build persistence diagrams, using Euclidean distance as the distance measure. The diagrams are a representation of the document’s geometry in the metric space. We then perform clustering on the Twenty Newsgroups dataset with the features extracted from the persistence diagram. We also evaluate the method on sentiment classification tasks, using the Cornell Sentence Polarity (CSP) (Pang and Lee, 2005) and IMDb movie review datasets (Maas et al., 2011).\nAs suggested by Zhu (2013), we posit that the information about the intrinsic geometry of documents, found in the persistence diagrams, might yield information that our classifier can leverage, either on its own or in combination with other representations. The primary objective of our work is to empirically evaluate these representations in the case of sentiment and topic classification, and assess their usefulness for real-world tasks."

      "heading" : "2.2 Gromov-Haussdorff Distance",
      "text" : "Given a dictionary of word vectors of dimension n, we can represent any document as a finite subset of Rn. The Haussdorff distance gives us a way to evaluate the distance between two such sets. More precisely, the Haussdorff distance dH between two finite subsets A,B of Rn is defined as:\ndH(A,B) = max(sup a∈A d(a,B), sup b∈B d(b, A))\nwhere d(x, Y ) = infy∈Y ‖x − y‖2 is the distance of point x from set Y .\nHowever, this distance is sensitive to translations and other isometric2 transformations. Hence, a more natural metric is the Gromov-Haussdorff distance (Gromov et al., 1981), simply defined as\ndGH(A,B) = inf f∈En dH(A, f(B))\nwhere En is the set of all isometries of Rn. Figure 1 provides an example of practical Gromov-Haussdorff (GH) distance computation between two sets of three points each. Both sets are embedded in R2 (middle panel) using isometries i.e the distance between points in each set is conserved. The Haussdorff distance between the two embedded sets corresponds to the length of the black segment. The GH distance is the minimum Haussdorff distance under all possible isometric embeddings.\nWe want to compare documents based on their intrinsic geometric properties. Intuitively, the GH distance measures how far two sets are from being isometric. This allows us to define the geometry of a document more precisely:\nDefinition 1 (Document Geometry) We say that two documents A, B have the same geometry if dGH(A,B) = 0, ie if they are the same up to an isometry.\nMathematically speaking, this amounts to defining the geometry of a document as its equivalence class under the equivalence relation induced by the GH distance on the set of all documents.\n1https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/ 2f : Rn −→ Rn is isometric if it is distance preserving, ie ∀x, y ∈ Rn, ‖f(x)−f(y)‖2 = ‖x−y‖2. Rotations, translations and reflections are examples of (linear) isometries.\nComparison to the Earth Mover Distance : Kusner et al. (2015) proposed a new method for computing a distance between documents based on an instance of the Earth Mover Distance (Rubner et al., 1998) called Word Mover Distance (WMD). While WMD quantifies the total cost of matching all words of one document to another, the GH distance is the cost, up to an isometry, of the worst-case matching."

      "heading" : "2.3 Persistence diagrams",
      "text" : "Efficiently computing the GH distance is still an open problem despite a lot of recent work in this area (Mémoli and Sapiro, 2005; Bronstein et al., 2006; Mémoli, 2007; Agarwal et al., 2015).\nFortunately, Carrière et al. (2015) provides us with a way to derive a signature which is stable with respect to the GH distance. More specifically, given a finite point cloud A ⊂ Rn, the persistence diagram of the Vietori-Rips filtration on A, Dg(A), can be computed. This approach is inspired by persistent homology, a subfield of algebraic topology.\nThe rigorous definition of these notions is not the crux of this paper and we will only present them informally. The curious reader is invited to refer to Zhu (2013) for a short introduction. More details are in Delfinado and Edelsbrunner (1995); Edelsbrunner et al. (2002); Robins (1999).\nA persistence diagram is a scatter plot of 2-D points representing the appearance and disappearance of geometric features3 under varying resolutions. This can be imagined as replacing each point by a sphere of increasing radius.\nWe use the procedure described in Carrière et al.\n3such as connected components, holes or empty hulls\n(2015) to derive fixed-sized vectors from persistence diagrams. These vectors have the following property: if A and B are two finite subsets of Rn, Dg(A) and Dg(B) are their persistence diagrams, N = max(|Dg(A)|, |Dg(B)|) and VA, VB ∈ R N(N−1) 2 , then\n‖VA − VB‖2 6 √ 2N(N − 1)dGH(A,B)\nIn other words, the resulting signatures VA and VB are stable with respect to the GH distance. The size of the vectors are dependent on the underlying sets A and B. However, as is argued in Carrière et al. (2015), we can truncate the vectors to a dimension fixed across our dataset while preserving the stability property (albeit losing some of the representative ability of the signatures)."

We then use Dionysus (Morozov, 2008– 2016), a C++ library for computing persistence diagrams, and form the signatures described in 2.3. We will subsequently refer to these diagrams as Persistent Homology (PH) embeddings. Once we have the embeddings for each document, they can be used as input to standard clustering or classification algorithms.\nAs a baseline document representation, we use the average of the word vectors for that document (subsequently called AW2V embeddings).\nFor clustering, we experiment with K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) on a subset4 of the Twenty Newsgroups dataset. The subset was selected to ensure that most documents are from related topics, making clustering nontrivial, and the documents are of reasonable length to compute the representation.\n4alt.atheism, sci.space and talk.religion.misc categories\nFor classification, we perform both sentencelevel and document-level binary sentiment classification using logistic regression on the CSP and IMDb corpora respectively."

To further assess the utility of PH embeddings, we concatenate them with AW2V to obtain a third representation, AW2V+PH.\nWith GMM and AW2V+PH, the F1-Score of clustering is 0.499. In terms of F1 and precision, we see that tf-idf representations perform better than PH, for reasons that we will discuss in later sections. In terms of recall, PH as well as AW2V perform fairly well. Importantly, we see that all the metrics for PH are significantly above the random baseline, indicating that some valuable information is contained in them."

We compare our results with the paragraph-vector approach (Le and Mikolov, 2014). We observe that PH embeddings perform poorly on this dataset. Similar to the CSP dataset, AW2V embeddings give acceptable results. The combined representation performs slightly better, but not by a margin of significance."

      "heading" : "5 Discussion and Analysis",
      "text" : "As seen in Figure 3, the PH representation does not outperform tf-idf or AW2V, and in fact often doesn’t perform much better than chance.\nOne possible reason is linked to the nature of our datasets: the computation of the persistence diagram is very sensitive to the size of the documents. The geometry of small documents, where the number of words is negligible with respect to the dimensionality of the word vectors, is not very rich. The resulting topological signatures are very sparse, which is a problem for CSP as well as documents in IMDb and Twenty Newsgroups that contain only one line. On the opposite side of the spectrum, persistence diagrams are intractable to compute without down-sampling for very long documents (which in turn negatively impacts the representation of smaller documents).\nWe performed an additional experiment on a subset of the IMDb corpus that only contained documents of reasonable length, but obtained similar results. This indicates that the poor performance of PH representations, even when combined with other features (AW2V), cannot be explained only by limitations of the data.\nThese observations lead to the conclusion that, for these datasets, the intrinsic geometry of documents in the word2vec semantic space does not help text classification tasks."

However, such techniques have not been used in NLP, primarily because the theory is inaccessible and suitable applications are scarce. Zhu (2013) offers an introduction to using persistent homology in NLP, by creating representations of nursery-rhymes and novels, as well as highlights structural differences between child and adolescent writing. However, these techniques have not been applied to core NLP tasks."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "Based on our experiments, using persistence diagrams for text representation does not seem to positively contribute to document clustering and sentiment classification tasks. There are certainly merits to the method, specifically its strong mathematical foundation and its domain-independent, unsupervised nature. Theoretically, algebraic topology has the ability to capture structural context, and this could potentially benefit syntaxbased NLP tasks such as parsing. We plan to investigate this connection in the future."

In this work, we evaluate the utility of these topology-based document representations in traditional NLP tasks, specifically document clustering and sentiment classification. We find that the embeddings do not benefit text analysis. In fact, performance is worse than simple techniques like tf-idf, indicating that the geometry of the document does not provide enough variability for classification on the basis of topic or sentiment in the chosen datasets.",
