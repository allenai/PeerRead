The noisy­ MAX, a generalization of the noisy-OR gate, is used to model causal independence in a BN with multi valued variables. We describe the use of leak probabilities to enforce the closed-world assumption in our model. We present Netview, a visualization tool based on causal independence and the use of leak probabilities. The Netview software allows knowledge engineers to dynamically view subnetworks for knowledge engineering, and it provides version control for editing a BN. Netview generates sub-networks in which leak probabilities are dynamically updated to reflect the missing portions of the network.",
