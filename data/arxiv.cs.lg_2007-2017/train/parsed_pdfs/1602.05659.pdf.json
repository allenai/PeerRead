      "text" : "Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data (Mohri et al., 2012). The achievements of supervised learning rely on labeled data bases, like LFW (Huang et al., 2007), ImageNet (Fei-Fei, 2010) and Microsoft COCO (Lin et al., 2014). Humans academically called ”crowds” (Attenberg et al., 2011; Burton et al., 2012), who label the data in practice, greatly contribute to the development of machine learning. However, labeling data artificially is not a completely ideal strategy, especially when data erupt. There are two harsh\nProceedings of the 33 rd International Conference on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016. JMLR: W&CP volume 48. Copyright 2016 by the author(s).\nfacts:\n• In practice, the scale of un-labeled data is far larger than that of labeled data, and the un-labeled data are substantially produced at any time.\n• Labeling data by humans is too expensive when the scale of data increases.\nGenerally, using abundant data could improve the performance especially generalization of supervised learning models. Based on the above two harsh facts and the benefit of abundant data, we carried out the preliminary research on utilizing un-labeled data to train classical supervised classification models without any internal change, in both theory and practice.\nWe present a universal method named ”Boost Picking” to train supervised classification models mainly by un-labeled data. Boost Picking just adds external modules rather than creates internal changes in the traditional models. Furthermore, the external modules are just two weak classifiers to estimate and correct the error of supervised models. We use two weak classifiers to train a strong classifier by unlabeled data (section 3.1) as well as a classifier trained by 100% labeled data. Boost Picking would work effectively only if the sum of the two weak classifiers precisions is greater than one (section 3.2). Precisions of the two weak classifiers determine whether Boost Picking works effectively. And the efficiency of Boost Picking is affected by both precisions and recalls of the two weak classifiers (section 3.3).\nBased on Boost Picking, we present a new way named ”Test along with Training, (TawT)” (section 4) to improve\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n05 65\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\nthe generalization of supervised classification models. Data to be classified are un-labeled, as a result, before classifying these data, train the supervised model using these unlabeled data by Boost Picking. The effect of TawT is theoretically analyzed in section 4.\nThe structure of Boost Picking refers to ”P-N Learning” in ”Tracking-Learning-Detection” (Kalal et al., 2012). Kalal’s work inspired Boost Picking (summarized in section 2). P-N Learning ignores the bias between the estimated labels and the true labels of examples in training data set. But the assumption of Boost Picking is looser and easier. Our contributions are listed as follows.\n• Theoretically prove the establishment condition of Boost Picking.\n• Present a theoretical guide on designing the weak classifiers to improve the efficiency of Boost Picking.\n• Theoretically analyze the generalization improvement of the supervised models when they are used as TawT.\nBoost Picking involves a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of un-labeled data in training the supervised learning models. This peculiarity is as same as that of Semi-supervised learning (Chapelle et al., 2006). Different from previous semi-supervised learning works like (Zhu, 2005; Zhu & Goldberg, 2009; Fazakis et al., 2015), Boost Picking, a universal method on training traditional supervised models using un-labeled data, adopts no internal change and has no limitation on the supervised models. Logistic regression (Hosmer Jr & Lemeshow, 2004), neural network (Haykin & Network, 2004), support vector machine (SVM) (Suykens & Vandewalle, 1999) and Adaboost (Rätsch et al., 2001) are all tested with varied data sets in experiments (section 5). Using Boost Picking, these models can be trained by 75% un-labeled data as effectively as same models trained by 100% labeled data. And TawT could improve generalizations of these models. Boost Picking can be regard as a universal method on converting supervised classification to semi-supervised classification."

      "text" : "This section introduces Kalal’s works. In TLD (Kalal et al., 2012), P-N Learning is an online learning method to learn the new form of the tracked object. It adopts two classifiers, which are named P-expert and N-expert respectively, to evaluate the error of the detector (a classifier) and correct it. P-expert estimates the false negatives from the negative outputs of the detector, while N-expert estimates the false positives from the positive outputs. Boost Picking refers to this thought.\nKalal theoretically proved that P-N Learning could train a detector whose error converges into zero (Kalal et al., 2010; 2012). Define −−→ d(k) as the errors in kth iteration,\n−−→ d(k) = [α(k), β(k)]T (1)\nwhere α(k) represents false positives and β(k) represents false negatives in outputs of the detector.\nDefine P+,R+ as the precision and the recall of P-expert respectively. Similarly, define P−,R− as the precision and the recall of N-expert. The recursive equations are as equation (2) (Kalal et al., 2012). α(k + 1) = α(k)−R− · α(k) + 1− P + P+ R+ · β(k) β(k + 1) = β(k)−R+ · β(k) + 1− P −\nP− R− · α(k)\n(2)\nReconstruct equation (1) and (2),\n−→ d (k + 1) =M −→ d (k) (3)\nwhere M = [ 1−R− 1−P\n+\nP+ R +\n1−P− P− R\n− 1−R+ ].\nKalal concludes that d will converge to zero only if eigenvalues of the transformation matrix M are all smaller than one (Kalal et al., 2010). It should be noted that P-N Learning try training a classifier without error, d → 0. In practice, it is difficult for the error to converge into zero, because the classifier almost cannot be trained to be errorless even through P-N experts could find out all false positives and false negatives from the outputs. The conclusion in Kalal’s works is based on an assumption that the trained classifier can perfectly classify the data in training set. P-N Learning ignores the bias of the classifier in training set."

      "text" : "The structure of Boost Picking is showed as Fig 1. Supposing x is an example from a feature-space X, and y is its corresponding label from a label space Y = {1,−1}, the training set of Boost Picking is composed by a labeled set Xl with its label Ll and an unlabeled set Xu. Supposing that Lu are the true labels of Xu (do not exist in fact), define F : x → y as an supervised learning model trained by 100% labeled data set X(100%) = {Xl, Xu} with L(100%) = {Ll, Lu}. The goal of Boost Picking is to train an effective model f → F by Xl, Ll and Xu.\nFirst, the supervised model is trained by labeled data Xl, which is named ”initialization” ( 1© in Fig 1). Through this step, the model is initialed as f0.\nSecond, the un-labeled dataXu are classified by the trained model ( 2© in Fig 1).\nyk = fk−1(x), x ∈ Xu, (4)\nwhere yk is the estimated label in kth iteration and fk−1 is the result of the k-1th iteration.\nThen use two classifiers, FP Finder and FN Finder, to estimate the error in the outputs. Here, functions of FP Finder and FN Finder are similar with N-expert and P-expert. FP Finder detects the false positives in positive outputs and FN Finder detects the false negatives in negative outputs.{\nXf+ = FP (X+) Xf− = FN(X−) (5)\nwhere X+ = {x ∈ Xu|f(x) = 1} and X− = {x ∈ Xu|f(x) = −1}\nAnd then, the supervised learning model is re-trained by a new data set. The new data set is composed by randomly selected labeled data and the results of FP Finder and FN Finder. Xnew = {Xran, Xf+, Xf−}, where Xran ⊂ Xl. In the new data set, labels of FP Finder results are set as -1 and labels of FN Finder results are set as 1.\nThe first step ”initialization” ( 1© in Fig 1) is executed only one time. And the second step ( 2© in Fig 1) is circularly executed until satisfying the convergence condition. The establishment condition of Boost Picking is theoretically proved in section 3.2\nIn implement, one of the convergence conditions is that there is almost no difference between current outputs and last outputs, which can be written as equation (6).\nsum(|yki − yk−1i |)/2Nu < θdiff (6)\nwhere Nu is the size of Xu. Another convergence condition is that the classification results of part of labeled data\nAlgorithm 1 Boost Picking Input: data Xl with label Ll, data Xu Initialize trainset = Xl, Ynow = 0 repeat\nTrain f with trainset Ypre = Ynow Ynow = f(Xu) Xf+ = FP (X+), Xf− = FN(X−) Xran = randomselect(Xl) trainset = {Xran, Xf+, Xf−} con1 = sum(|Ynow − Ypre|)/2Nu < θdiff Xran = randomselect(Xl) con2 = sum(|Lran − f(Xran)|)/2Nran < θbias\nuntil con1 + con2 == 2\nhas a relatively small bias.\nsum(|lran − f(xran)|)/2Nran < θbias (7)\nwhere xran ∈ Xran and Nran is the scale of Xran. It should be noted that each Xran including the one in Xnew is randomly selected from Xl anew.\nUnlike the equation (6), equation (7) is an empirical solution for the problem that FP Finder and FN Finder might be designed so poor that the establishment condition cannot be always satisfied just like our experiments (section 5.2). In section 3.2.3, why this condition is needed is detailed. Algorithm 1 is the format pseudocode of Boost Picking in practice."

      "text" : "The conclusion in prior work (section 2) is established based on an assumption that the trained model could perfectly classify the data in training set. Under most conditions, this assumption cannot be established. However, when Boost Picking aims to train f → F by Xl, Ll and\nXu, the assumption can be looser. Here, the conclusion that f → F only if the eigenvalues of the transformation matrix M are smaller than one is derived.\nWhat should be paid attention is that both f and F are a same model and all their parameters are same. The only difference between f and F is the training data set (section 3.1). Define XT is the data set where examples in X100% can be correctly classified by F , and XF is the data set where examples cannot be correctly classified by F ,{\nXT = {x ∈ X100%|F (x) = l} XF = {x ∈ X100%|F (x) 6= l}\n(8)\nwhere l is the true label of x. Define 4e as the difference between f and F , and4e is valued by the number of examples whose classification results by f and F are different.{\n4ei = |f(xi)− F (xi)|, xi ∈ X100% 4e = ∑ 4ei/2N\n(9)\nwhere N is the size of X100%.\n4e can be reconstructed as\n4 e = d+ b (10)\nwhere di = |f(xi) − F (xi)|, xi ∈ XT , d = ∑ di/2N\nand bi = |f(xi) − F (xi)|, xi ∈ XF , b = ∑ bi/2N . d means the number of examples that can be correctly classified by F but cannot be correctly classified by f . b means the number of examples that can be correctly classified by f but cannot be correctly classified by F . Define biasi = |li − F (xi)|, xi ∈ X100% and bias =∑ biasi/2N . bias represents the bias between the labels estimated by F and the true labels. When xi ∈ XT ,biasi = 0. In contrast, when xi ∈ XF ,biasi = 2.\nbi = 0 when xi ∈ XF ∩ f(xi) 6= li and bi = 2 when xi ∈ XF ∩ f(xi) = li, as a result, b = ∑ |l − F (x)|/2N, x ∈ XF ∩ f(x) = l. Based on the above conclusion, bias can be reconstructed as equation (11).\nbias = b+ n (11)\nwhere ni = |l − F (xi)|, xi ∈ XF ∩ f(xi) 6= l and n =∑ ni/2N .\nGenerally, bias can be reduced by increasing the complexity of models, while it will be almost constant if the model is determined (including the model’s parameters). Define ei = |l − f(xi)|, xi ∈ X100% and e = ∑ ei/2N . e represents the ”error” between the labels estimated by f and the true labels.\ne = bias+4e− 2b = d+ bias− b ≤ d+ bias (12)\nTable 1 shows the relationship among 4ei, di, bi, biasi ni and ei. Take bi for instance, bi appears in (f(xi) = li, F (xi) 6= li), and this means that ∀xi ∈ X100%, if f(xi) = li&F (xi) 6= li, bi = 2. As for the quadrants where bi does not exit, bi is not defined or equal to zero. 4ei, di, biasi ni and ei are similar. From Table 1, equation (10), (11) and (12) can be easily derived.\nAs above mentioned, b represents the improvement between the performance of f and the performance of F in training set X100%. b might be the cost to make the model F avoid being over-fitting. However, because f and F are a same model (b is relatively small) and f is un-fitting in early iteration, we temporarily ignore the negative impact of b on the generalization and regard b is helpful for model improvement. Furthermore, even if b harms the generalization, section 4 details how to improve the generalization of the supervised learning models using Boost Picking.\nAs for d, it can be proved that d→ 0 as section 2, because xi can be perfectly classified (F (xi) = li) when xi ∈ XT .\n−→ d (k + 1) =M −→ d (k) (13)\nd → 0 when the eigenvalues of transformation matrix M are smaller than 1.\nAs a result, if b = 0, d→ 0,4e = 0, and f → F ; if b 6= 0, d → 0,4e = b, and f is better than F , as least in training set. This part gets the conclusion that f could be trained by Xl, Ll and Xu as effectively as F trained by X100% and L100%, only if eigenvalues of M are smaller than one."

Fig 3 shows that no matter what the recalls of the two classifiers are, the maximal eigenvalue is definitely equal to one when P+ + P− = 1. And the maximal eigenvalue is smaller than one when P+ + P− > 1.\nAs a result, the sum of precisions of FP Finder and FN Finder determines whether Boost Picking can train f as effectively as F . Under the condition that recalls of the two\nweak classifiers are neither equal to zero, the differences between f and F will drop to zero in the iteration process only if P+ + P− > 1.\nHere, based on the above theoretical anlysis and Fig 2 3, it is concluded that if recalls of the two weak classifiers are both greater than zero and sum of precisions is greater than one, Boost Picking could train an effective supervised classification models mainly by un-labeled data as effectively as the same model trained by all labeled data."

Larger P+ or P− makes λ2 more likely to be greater than zero, because C = 0 is closer to (1,1) when P+ or P− is larger and that means more area where C > 0 (shown in Fig 4(b,c)); the smaller |P+ − P−| is, the less likely (λ1λ2 > 0) (shown in Fig 4(d)).\nBased on equation (14) and relationship between λ1λ2 and C(R+, R−),\n|λ1|+ |λ2| =\n{ 2−R+ −R−,C(R+, R−) ≥ 0√\n4,C(R+, R−) < 0 (24)\nWhen C(R+, R−) ≥ 0, |λ1| + |λ2| will decrease if R+ + R− increases.

Boost Picking only adopts two weak classifiers to estimate and correct the error. It is theoretically proved that Boost Picking could train a supervised model mainly by un-labeled data as effectively as the same model trained by 100% labeled data, only if recalls of the two weak classifiers are all greater than zero and the sum of precisions is greater than one. Based on Boost Picking, we present ”Test along with Training (TawT)” to improve the generalization of supervised models. Both Boost Picking and TawT are successfully tested in varied little data sets.",
