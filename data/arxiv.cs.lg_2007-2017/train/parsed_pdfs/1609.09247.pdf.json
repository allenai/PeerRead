      "text" : "Traditional supervised approaches for structural classification assume full annotation (FA), meaning that the training instances have complete manually-labeled structures. In the case of dependency parsing, FA means a complete parse tree is provided for each training sentence. However, recent studies suggest that it is more economic and effective to construct labeled data with partial annotation (PA). A lot of research effort has been attracted to obtain partially-labeled data for different tasks via active learning (Sassano and Kurohashi, 2010; Mirroshandel and Nasr, 2011; Li et al., 2012; Marcheggiani and Artières, 2014; Flannery and Mori, 2015; Li et al., 2016), cross-lingual syntax projection (Spreyer and Kuhn, 2009; Ganchev et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2010; Li et al., 2014), or mining natural annotation implicitly encoded in web pages (Jiang et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Nivre et al., 2014; Yang and Vozila, 2014). Figure 1 gives an example sentence partially annotated with two dependencies.\nHowever, there still lacks systematic study on how to train structural models such as dependency parsers with PA. Most previous works listed above rely on ad-hoc strategies designed for only basic dependency parsers. One exception is that Li et al. (2014) convert partial trees into forests and train a log-linear graph-based dependency parser (LLGPar) with PA based on a forest-base objective, showing promising results. Meanwhile, it is still unclear how PAs can be used to train state-of-the-art linear graphbased (LGPar) and transition-based parser (LTPar). Please refer to Section 6 for detailed discussions of previous methods for training parsers with PA.\nThis paper aims to thoroughly study this issue and make systematic comparison on different approaches of training parsers with PA. In summary, we make the following contributions.\n• We present a general framework for directly training state-of-the-art LGPar and LTPar with PA based on constrained decoding. The basic idea is to use the current feature weights to parse the sentence under the PA-constrained search space, and use the best parse as a pseudo gold-standard\n∗Correspondence author\nreference for feature weight update during perceptron training. We also implement the forestobjective based approach of Li et al. (2014) for LLGPar.\n• We have made thorough comparison among different directly-train approaches under three different settings for simulating PA, i.e., random dependencies, most uncertain dependencies, and dependencies with divergent outputs from the three parsers. We have also compared the proposed directlytrain approaches with the straightforward complete-then-train approach.\n• Extensive experiments on Penn Treebank lead to several interesting and clear findings."

      "text" : "Given an input sentence x = w0w1...wn, dependency parsing builds a complete dependency tree d rooted at w0, where w0 is an artificial token linking to the root of the sentence (Kübler et al., 2009). A dependency tree comprises a set of dependencies, namely d = {h y m : 0 ≤ h ≤ n, 1 ≤ m ≤ n}, where h y m is a dependency from a head word h to a modifier word m. A complete dependency tree contains n dependencies, namely |d| = n, whereas a partial dependency tree contains less than n dependencies, namely |d| < n. Alternatively, FA can be understood as a special form of PA. For clarity, we denote a complete tree as d and a partial tree as dp. The decoding procedure aims to find an optimal complete tree d∗:\nd∗ = arg max d∈Y(x) Score(x,d;w) Score(x,d;w) = w · f(x,d) (1)\nwhere Y(x) defines the search space containing all legal trees for x; Score(x,d;w) is a score/probability of d; f(x,d) is a sparse accumulated feature vector corresponding to d; w is the feature weight vector."

      "text" : "As described in Li et al. (2014), LLGPar can naturally learn from PA based on the idea of ambiguous labeling, which allows a sentence to have multiple parse trees (forest) as its gold-standard reference (Riezler et al., 2002; Dredze et al., 2009; Täckström et al., 2013). First, a partial tree dp is converted in to a forest by adding all possible dependencies pointing to remaining words without heads, with the constraint that a newly added dependency does not violate existing ones in dp. The forest can be formally defined as F(x,dp) = {d : d ∈ Y(x),dp ⊆ d}, whose conditional probability is the sum of probabilities of all trees that it contains:\np(dp|x;w) = ∑\nd∈F(x,dp)\np(d|x;w) (5)\nThen, we can define an forest-based training objective function to maximize the likelihood of training data as described in Li et al. (2014).\nLGPar can be extended to directly learn from PA based on the idea of constrained decoding, as shown in Algorithm 1, which has been previously applied to Chinese word segmentation with partially labeled sequences (Jiang et al., 2010). The idea is using the best tree d+ in the constrained search space Y(xj ,d p j ) (line 6) as a pseudo gold-standard reference for weight update. In traditional perceptron training, d+ would be a complete parse tree provided in the training data. It is trivial to implement constrained decoding for graph-based parsers, and we only need to disable some illegal combination operations during dynamic programming.\nLTPar can also directly learn from PA in a similar way, as shown in Algorithm 1. Constrained decoding is performed to find a pseudo gold-standard reference (line 7). It is more complicate to design constrained decoding for transition-based parsing than graph-based parsing. Fortunately, Nivre et al. (2014) propose a procedure to enable arc-eager parsers to decode in the search space constrained by some given dependencies. We ignore the details due to the space limitation."

Original bracketed structures are converted into dependency structures using Penn2Malt with default head-finding rules. We build a CRF-based bigram part-of-speech (POS) tagger to produce automatic POS tags for all train/dev/test data (10-way jackknifing on training data), with tagging accuracy 97.3% on test data. As suggested by an earlier anonymous reviewer, we further split the training data into two parts. We assume that the first 1K training sentences are provided as a small-scale data with FA, which can be obtained by a small amount of manual annotation or through cross-lingual projection methods. We simulate PA for the remaining 39K sentences. Table 1 shows the data statistics.\nWe train LLGPar with stochastic gradient descent (Finkel et al., 2008). We set the beam size to 64 during both training and evaluation of LTPar. Following standard practice established by Collins (2002), we adopt averaged weights for evaluation of LGPar and LTPar and use the early-update strategy during training LTPar.\nSince we have two sets of training data, we adopt the simple corpus-weighting strategy of Li et al. (2014). In each iteration, we merge train-1K and a subset of random 10K sentences from train-39K , shuffle them, and then use them for training. For all parsers, training terminates when the peak parsing accuracy on dev data does not improve in 30 consecutive iterations. For evaluation, we use the standard unlabeled attachment score (UAS) excluding punctuation marks.\n4.2 Three settings for simulating PA on train-39K\nIn order to simulating PA for each sentence in train-39K , we only keep α% gold-standard dependencies (not considering punctuation marks), and remove all other dependencies. We experiment with three simulation settings to fully investigate the capability of different approaches in learning from PA.\nRandom (30% or 15%): For each sentence in train-39K , we randomly select α% words, and only keep dependencies linking to these words. With this setting, we aim to purely study the issue without biasing to certain structures. This setting may be best fit the scenario automatic syntax projection based on bitext, where the projected dependencies tend to be arbitrary (and noisy) due to the errors in automatic source-language parses and word alignments and non-isomorphism syntax between languages.\nUncertain (30% or 15%): In their work of active learning with PA, Li et al. (2016) show that the marginal probabilities from LLGPar is the most effective uncertainty measurement for selecting the most informative words to be annotated. Following their work, we first train LLGPar on train-1K with FA, and then use LLGPar to parse train-39K and select α% most uncertain words to keep their heads.\nFollowing Li et al. (2016), we measure the uncertainty of a word wi according to the marginal probability gap between its two most likely heads h0i and h 1 i .\nUncertainty(x, i) = p(h0i y i|x)− p(h 1 i y i|x) (6)\n.\nThe intuition is that the smaller the probability gap is, the more uncertain the model is about wi. The marginal probability of a dependency is the sum of probabilities of all legal trees that contain the dependency.\np(h y m|x) = ∑\nd∈Y(x):hym∈d\np(d|x) (7)\nThis setting fits the scenario of active learning, which aims to save annotation effort by only annotating the most useful structures. From another perspective, this settings may tend to bias to LLGPar by keeping structures that are most useful for LLGPar.\nDivergence (13.68%): We train all three parsers on train-1K , and use them to parse train-39K . If their output trees do not assign the same head to a word, then we keep the gold-standard dependency pointing to the word, leading to 13.68% remaining dependencies. Different from the uncertain setting, this setting does not bias to any parser."

Table 3 shows the results.\nComparing the three parsers, we have several clear findings. (1) LLGPar achieves best performance over all settings and is very effective in learning from PA. (2) The accuracy gap between LGPar and LLGPar becomes larger with PA than with FA, indicating LGPar is less effective in learning from PA than LLGPar. (3) LTPar lags behind LLGPar by large margin and is ineffective in learning from PA.\nFA (random) vs. PA (random): from the results in the two major columns, we can see that LLGPar achieves higher accuracy by about 0.5% when trained on sentences with α% random dependencies than when trained on α% random sentences with FA. This is reasonable and can be explained under the assumption that LLGPar can make full use of PA in model training. In fact, in both cases, the training\ndata contains approximately the same number of annotated dependencies. However, from the perspective of model training, given some dependencies in the case of PA, more information about the syntactic structure can be derived.1 Taking Figure 1 as an example, “I1” can only modify “saw2” due to the singleroot and single-head constraints; similarly, “Sarah3” can only modify either “saw2” or “with2”; and so on. Therefore, given the same amount of annotated dependencies, random PA contains more syntactic information than random FA, which explains why LLGPar performs better with PA than FA.\nIn contrast, both LGPar and LTPar achieve slight lower accuracy with PA than with FA. This is another evidence that LGPar and LTPar is less effective than LLGPar in learning from PA.\nPA (random) vs. PA (uncertain): we can see that all three parser achieves much higher accuracy in the latter case.2 The annotated dependencies in PA (uncertain) are most uncertain ones for current statistical parser (i.e., LLGPar), and thus are more helpful for training the models than those in PA (random). Another phenomenon is that, in the case of PA (uncertain), increasing α% = 15% to 30% actually doubles the number of annotated dependencies, but only boost accuracy of LLGPar by 93.02 − 92.44 = 0.58%, which indicates that newly added 15% dependencies are much less useful since the model can already well handle these low-uncertainty dependencies.\nPA (uncertain, 15%) vs. PA (divergence): we can see that the all three parsers achieve similar parsing accuracies. This indicates that uncertainty measurement based on LLGPar can actually discovers useful dependencies to be annotated without particularly biasing towards itself.\nIn summary, we can conclude from the results that LLGPar can effectively learn from PA, whereas LGPar is slightly less effective and LTPar is ineffective at all."

The idea is first using an existing parser to complete partial trees in train-39K into full trees based on constrained decoding, and then training the target parser on train-1K with FA and train-39K with completed FA.\nResults of completing via constrained decoding: Table 4 reports UAS of the completed trees on train-39K using two different strategies for completion. “No constraints (0%)” means that train-39K has no annotated dependencies and normal decoding without constraints is used.

For example, LLGPar-1K+39K trained on random (30%) is employed to complete the same data by filling the remaining 70% dependencies.\nComparing the three parsers trained on train-1K , we can see that constrained decoding has similar effects on all three parsers, and is able to return much more accurate trees. Numbers in parenthesis show the accuracy gap between normal (0%) and constrained decoding. This suggests that constrained decoding itself is not responsible for the ineffectiveness of Algorithm 1 for LTPar.\nComparing the results of LLGPar-1K and LLGPar-1K+39K (numbers in parenthesis showing the accuracy gap), it is obvious that the latter produces much better full trees since the fine-trained LLGPar can make extra use of PA in train-39K during training.\nResults of training on completed FA: Table 5 compares performance of the three parsers trained on train-1K with FA and train-39K with completed FA, from which we can draw several clear and interesting findings. First, different from the case of directly training on PA, the three parsers achieve very similar parsing accuracies when trained on data with completed FA in both completion settings. Second, using parsers coarsely-trained on train-1K for completion leads to very bad performance, which is even much worse than those of the directly-train method in Table 3 except for LTPar with uncertain (30%). Third, using the fine-trained LLGPar-1K+39K for completion makes LGPar and LTPar achieve nearly the same accuracies with LLGPar, which may be because LLGPar provides complementary effects during completion, analogous to the scenario of co-training."

The most important difference is that in line 4-7 of Algorithm 1, LGPar uses dynamic programming based exact search algorithm to find the highest-scoring tree according to the current model, whereas LTPar use approximate beam search\nalgorithm. The approximate search procedure may cause the optimal tree drops off the beam too soon and thus the returned a+ may cause the model be updated to bias to certain wrong structures, which cannot be further covered due to the lack of sufficient supervision in the scenario of PA.\nWe have tried three strategies to enhance LTPar so far though little progress has been made. First, we set the beam size to 32/64/128/256, and hope LTPar may learn better from PA with larger beam. Second, as suggested by an earlier anonymous reviewer, we use k-best a+ and a− instead of the 1-best outputs for feature weight update. We try to use the averaged feature vector of k-best a+ and/or k-best a− in line 9. Third, we also try a conservative update strategy. The idea is that first we obtain a− (corresponding to a tree d−) in line 5. Then, for each dependency in d− that is compatible with those in the partial tree dpj , we temporarily insert it into d p j . We use the enlarged d p j in line 7. In this way, the returned d+ is more similar to d− so that less risk is taken during model update. So far, the results for all three strategies are negative.

Particularly, we focus on the realistic scenario where we have a small-scale training dataset with FA and a largescale training dataset with PA. We experiment with three settings for simulating PA. We compare several directly-train and complete-then-train approaches with three mainstream parsers, i.e., LLGPar, LGPar, and LTPar. Finally, we draw the following important conclusions. (1) For the complete-thentrain approach, using parsers coarsely trained on small-scale data with FA for completion leads to unsatisfactory results. (2) LLGPar is able to make full use of PA for training. In contrast, LGPar is slightly inferior and LTPar performs badly in learning from PA. (3) The complete-then-train approach can make LGPar and LTPar on par with LLGPar in terms of parsing accuracy if using LLGPar fine trained on all data with both FA and PA for completion.\nFor future, we will further investigate the reason behind the ineffectiveness of LTPar in learning from PA, and try to propose effective strategies to solve the issue. Our next plan is to employ the dynamic programming-enhanced beam search by merging equivalent states proposed by Huang and Sagae (2010), which allows the parser to explore larger search space during decoding. Moreover, we also plan to consider more constraints beyond dependencies. For example, Nivre et al. (2014) propose a constrained decoding procedure which can also incorporate bracketing constraints, i.e., a certain span forming a single-root subtree, which would be interesting yet challenging for graph-based parsers due to the complexity of designing dynamic programming based algorithms."

However, there still lacks a systematic study on how to train statistical models with partial annotation (PA). Taking dependency parsing as our case study, this paper describes and compares two straightforward approaches for three mainstream dependency parsers. The first approach is previously proposed to directly train a log-linear graph-based parser (LLGPar) with PA based on a forest-based objective. This work for the first time proposes the second approach to directly training a linear graph-based parse (LGPar) and a linear transition-based parser (LTPar) with PA based on the idea of constrained decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on Penn Treebank under three different settings for simulating PA, i.e., random dependencies, most uncertain dependencies, and dependencies with divergent outputs from the three parsers. The results show that LLGPar is most effective in learning from PA and LTPar lags behind the graphbased counterparts by large margin. Moreover, LGPar and LTPar can achieve best performance by using LLGPar to complete PA into full annotation (FA).",
