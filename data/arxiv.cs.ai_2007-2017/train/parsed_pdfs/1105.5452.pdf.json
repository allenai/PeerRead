      "text" : "Unifying Class-Based Representation Formalisms\nDiego Calvanese alvanese dis.uniroma1.it Maurizio Lenzerini lenzerini dis.uniroma1.it Daniele Nardi nardi dis.uniroma1.it Dipartimento di Informati a e Sistemisti a Universit a di Roma \\La Sapienza\" Via Salaria 113, I-00198 Roma, Italy\nAbstra t\nThe notion of lass is ubiquitous in omputer s ien e and is entral in many formalisms for the representation of stru tured knowledge used both in knowledge representation and in databases. In this paper we study the basi issues underlying su h representation formalisms and single out both their ommon hara teristi s and their distinguishing features. Su h investigation leads us to propose a unifying framework in whi h we are able to apture the fundamental aspe ts of several representation languages used in di erent ontexts. The proposed formalism is expressed in the style of des ription logi s, whi h have been introdu ed in knowledge representation as a means to provide a semanti ally well-founded basis for the stru tural aspe ts of knowledge representation systems. The des ription logi\nonsidered in this paper is a subset of rst order logi with ni e omputational hara teristi s. It is quite expressive and features a novel ombination of onstru ts that has not been studied before. The distinguishing onstru ts are number restri tions, whi h generalize existen e and fun tional dependen ies, inverse roles, whi h allow one to refer to the inverse of a relationship, and possibly y li assertions, whi h are ne essary for apturing real world domains. We are able to show that it is pre isely su h ombination of onstru ts that makes our logi powerful enough to model the essential set of features for de ning lass stru tures that are ommon to frame systems, obje t-oriented database languages, and semanti data models. As a onsequen e of the established orresponden es, several signi ant extensions of ea h of the above formalisms be ome available. The high expressiveness of the logi we propose and the need for apturing the reasoning in di erent ontexts for es us to distinguish between unrestri ted and nite model reasoning. A notable feature of our proposal is that reasoning in both ases is de idable. We argue that, by virtue of the high expressive power and of the asso iated reasoning apabilities on both unrestri ted and nite models, our logi provides a ommon ore for lass-based representation formalisms."

      "text" : "In many elds of omputer s ien e we nd formalisms for the representation of obje ts and\nlasses (Mots hnig-Pitrik & Mylopoulous, 1992). Generally speaking, an obje t denotes an element of the domain of interest, and a lass denotes a set of obje ts with ommon hara teristi s. We use the term \\ lass-based representation formalism\" to refer to a formalism that allows one to express several kinds of relationships and onstraints (e.g., sub lass onstraints) holding among the lasses that are meaningful in a set of appli ations. Moreover,\nlass-based formalisms aim at taking advantage of the lass stru ture in order to provide various information, su h as whether a lass is onsistent, i.e., it admits at least one obje t, whether a lass is a sub lass of another lass, and more generally, whether a given onstraint\n1999 AI A ess Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers. All rights reserved.\nholds between a given set of lasses. From the above hara terization, it should be lear that the formalisms referred to in this paper deal only with the stru tural aspe ts of obje ts and lasses, and do not in lude any features for the spe i ation of behavioral properties of obje ts.\nThree main families of lass-based formalisms are identi ed in this paper. The rst one omes from knowledge representation and in parti ular from the work on semanti networks and frames (see for example Lehmann, 1992; Sowa, 1991). The se ond one originates in the eld of databases and in parti ular from the work on semanti data models (see for example Hull & King, 1987). The third one arises from the work on types in programming languages and obje t-oriented systems (see for example Kim & Lo hovsky, 1989).\nIn the past there have been several attempts to establish relationships among the various families of lass-based formalisms (see Se tion 6 for a brief survey). The proposed solutions are not fully general and a formalism apturing both the modeling onstru ts and the reasoning te hniques for all the above families is still missing. In this paper we address this problem by proposing a lass-based representation formalism, based on des ription logi s (Bra hman & Levesque, 1984; S hmidt-S hau & Smolka, 1991; Donini, Lenzerini, Nardi, & S haerf, 1996), and by using it for omparing other formalisms.\nIn des ription logi s, stru tured knowledge is des ribed by means of so alled on epts and roles, whi h denote unary and binary predi ates, respe tively. Starting from a set of atomi symbols one an build omplex on ept and role expressions by applying suitable\nonstru tors whi h hara terize a des ription logi . Formally, on epts are interpreted as subsets of a domain and roles as binary relations over that domain, and all onstru ts are equipped with a pre ise set-theoreti semanti s. The most ommon onstru ts in lude boolean operations on on epts, and quanti ation over roles. For example, the on ept Person u 8 hild.Male, denotes the set of individuals that are instan es of the on ept Person and are onne ted through the role hild only to instan es of the on ept Male, while the on ept 9 hild denotes all individuals that are onne ted through the role hild to some individual. Further onstru ts that have been onsidered important in lude more general forms of quanti ation, number restri tions, whi h allow one to state limits on the number of onne tions that an individual may have via a ertain role, and onstru ts on roles, su h as interse tion, on atenation and inverse. A des ription logi knowledge base, expressing the intensional knowledge about the modeled domain, is built by stating in lusion assertions between on epts, whi h have to be satis ed by the models of the knowledge base. The assertions are used to spe ify ne essary and/or ne essary and suÆ ient onditions for individuals to be instan es of ertain on epts. Reasoning on su h knowledge bases in ludes the dete tion of in onsisten ies in the knowledge base itself, determining whether a on ept\nan be populated in a model of the knowledge base, and he king subsumption, i.e., whether all instan es of a on ept are ne essarily also instan es of another on ept in all models of the knowledge base.\nIn this paper we propose a des ription logi alled aluni, whi h is quite expressive and in ludes a novel ombination of onstru ts, in luding number restri tions, inverse roles, and in lusion assertions with no restri tions on y les. Su h features make aluni powerful enough to provide a uni ed framework for frame systems, obje t-oriented languages, and semanti data models. We show this by establishing a pre ise orresponden e with a framebased language in the style of the one proposed by Fikes and Kehler (1985), with the\nEntity-Relationship model (Chen, 1976), and with an obje t-oriented language in the style of the one introdu ed by Abiteboul and Kanellakis (1989). More spe i ally, we identify the most relevant features to model lasses in ea h of the ited settings and show that a spe i ation in any of those lass-based formalisms an be equivalently expressed as a knowledge base in aluni. In this way, we are able to identify whi h are the ommonalities among the families and whi h are the spe i ities of ea h family. Therefore, even though there are spe i features of every family that are not addressed by aluni, we are able to show that the formalism proposed in this paper provides important features that are\nurrently missing in ea h family, although their relevan e has often been stressed. In this sense, our unifying framework points out possible developments for the languages belonging to all the three families.\nOne fundamental reason for regarding aluni as a unifying framework for lass-based representation formalisms is that reasoning in aluni is hard, but nonetheless de idable, as shown by Calvanese, Lenzerini, and Nardi (1994), Calvanese (1996 ). Consequently, the language features arising from di erent frameworks to build lass-based representations are not just given a ommon semanti a ount, but are ombined in a more expressive setting where one retains the apability of solving reasoning tasks. The ombination of onstru ts in luded in the language makes it ne essary to distinguish between reasoning with respe t to\nnite models, i.e., models with a nite domain, and reasoning with respe t to unrestri ted models. Calvanese (1996 ) devises suitable te hniques for both unrestri ted and nite model reasoning, that enable for reasoning in the di erent ontexts arising from assuming a nite domain, as it is often the ase in the eld of databases, or assuming that a domain an also be in nite. In the paper, we dis uss the results on reasoning in aluni, and ompare them with other results on reasoning in lass-based representation formalisms.\nSummarizing, our framework provides an adequate expressive power to a ount for the most signi ant features of the major families of lass-based formalisms. Moreover, it is equipped with suitable te hniques for reasoning in both nite and unrestri ted models. Therefore, we believe that aluni aptures the essential ore of the lass-based representation formalisms belonging to all three families mentioned above.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next se tion we present our formalism and in Se tions 3, 4, and 5 we dis uss three families of lass-based formalisms, namely, frame languages, semanti data models, and obje t-oriented data models, showing that their basi features are aptured by knowledge bases in aluni. The nal se tions ontain a review of related work, in luding a dis ussion of reasoning in aluni and lass-based formalism, and some on luding remarks."

      "text" : "In this se tion, we present aluni, a lass-based formalism in the style of des ription logi s (DLs) (Bra hman & Levesque, 1984; S hmidt-S hau & Smolka, 1991; Donini et al., 1996; Donini, Lenzerini, Nardi, & Nutt, 1997). In DLs the domain of interest is modeled by means of on epts and roles, whi h denote lasses and binary relations, respe tively. Generally speaking, a DL is formed by three basi omponents:\nA des ription language, whi h spe i es how to onstru t omplex on ept and role expressions (also alled simply on epts and roles), by starting from a set of atomi\nsymbols and by applying suitable onstru tors. It is the set of allowed onstru ts that\nhara terizes the des ription language.\nA knowledge spe i ation me hanism, whi h spe i es how to onstru t a DL knowledge base, in whi h properties of on epts and roles are asserted.\nA set of basi reasoning tasks provided by the DL.\nIn the rest of the se tion we des ribe the spe i form that these three omponents assume in aluni.\n2.1 The Des ription Language of aluni\nIn the des ription language of aluni, alled ALUNI, on epts and roles are formed a -\nording to the syntax shown in Table 1, where A denotes an atomi on ept, P an atomi\nrole, C an arbitrary on ept expression, R an arbitrary role expression, and n a nonnegative integer. To in rease readability of on ept expressions, we also introdu e the following abbreviations:\n> A t :A; for some atomi on ept A\n? A u :A; for some atomi on ept A\n9R 9\n1\nR\n9\n=n\nR 9\nn\nR u 9\nn\nR\nCon epts are interpreted as subsets of a domain and roles as binary relations over that domain. Intuitively, :A represents the negation of an atomi on ept, and is interpreted as the omplement with respe t to the domain of interpretation. C\n1\nu C\n2\nrepresents the\nonjun tion of two on epts and is interpreted as set interse tion, while C\n1\ntC\n2\nrepresents\ndisjun tion and is interpreted as set union. Consequently, > represents the whole domain,\n1. ℄S denotes the ardinality of a set S.\nand ? the empty set. 8R.C is alled universal quanti ation over roles and is used to denote those elements of the interpretation domain that are onne ted through role R only to instan es of the on ept C. 9 n R and 9 n R are alled number restri tions, and impose on their instan es restri tions on the minimum and maximum number of obje ts they are\nonne ted to through role R. P , alled the inverse of role P , represents the inverse of the\nbinary relation denoted by P .\nMore formally, an interpretation I = (\nI\n;\nI\n) onsists of an interpretation domain\nI\nand an interpretation fun tion\nI\nthat maps every on ept C to a subset C\nI\nof\nI\nand\nevery role R to a subset R\nI\nof\nI\nI\na ording to the semanti rules spe i ed in Table 1.\nThe sets C\nI\nand R\nI\nare alled the extensions of C and R respe tively.\nExample 2.1 Consider the on ept expression\n8enrolls.Student u 9\n2\nenrolls u 9\n30\nenrollsu\n8tea hes .(Professor t GradStudent) u 9\n=1\ntea hes u\n:AdvCourse\nspe ifying the onstraints for an obje t to be a university ourse. The expression re e ts the fa t that ea h ourse enrolls only students, and restri tions on the minimum and maximum number of enrolled students. By using the role tea hes and the inverse onstru tor we\nan state the property that ea h ourse is taught by exa tly one individual, who is either a professor or a graduate student. Finally, negation is used to express disjointness from the\non ept denoting advan ed ourses.\n2.2 Knowledge Bases in aluni\nAn aluni knowledge base, whi h expresses the knowledge about lasses and relations of the modeled domain, is formally de ned as a triple K = (A;P;T ), where A is a nite set of atomi on epts, P is a nite set of atomi roles, and T is a nite set of so alled in lusion assertions. Ea h su h assertion has the form\nA\n_\nC\nwhere A is an atomi on ept and C an arbitrary on ept expression. Su h an in lusion assertion states by means of the on ept C ne essary properties for an element of the domain in order to be an instan e of the atomi on ept A. Formally, an interpretation I satis es the in lusion assertion A _ C if A I C I . An interpretation I is a model of a knowledge base K if it satis es all in lusion assertions in K. A nite model is a model with nite domain.\nExample 2.1 ( ont.) The assertion\nCourse\n_\n8enrolls.Studentu 9\n2\nenrollsu 9\n30\nenrolls u\n8tea hes .(Professort GradStudent) u 9\n=1\ntea hes\nmakes use of a omplex on ept expression to state ne essary onditions for an obje t to be an instan e of the on ept Course.\nIn aluni no restri tions are imposed on the form that the in lusion assertions may assume. In parti ular we do not rule out y li assertions, i.e., assertions in whi h the\non ept expression on the right hand side refers, either dire tly or indire tly via other assertions, to the atomi on ept on the left hand side. In the presen e of y li assertions di erent semanti s may be adopted (Nebel, 1991). The one de ned above, alled des riptive semanti s, a epts all interpretations that satisfy the assertions in the knowledge base, and hen e interprets assertions as onstraints on the domain to be modeled. For in lusion assertions, des riptive semanti s has been laimed to provide the most intuitive results (Bu hheit, Donini, Nutt, & S haerf, 1998). Alternative semanti s whi h have been proposed are based on xpoint onstru tions (Nebel, 1991; S hild, 1994; De Gia omo & Lenzerini, 1994b), and hen e allow to de ne in a unique way the interpretation of on epts.\nIn general, y les in the knowledge base in rease the omplexity of reasoning (Nebel, 1991; Baader, 1996; Calvanese, 1996b) and require a spe ial treatment by reasoning pro edures (Baader, 1991; Bu hheit, Donini, & S haerf, 1993). For this reason, many DL based systems assume the knowledge base to be a y li (Bra hman, M Guinness, Patel-S hneider, Alperin Resni k, & Borgida, 1991; Bres iani, Fran oni, & Tessaris, 1995). However, this assumption is unrealisti in pra ti e, and y les are de nitely ne essary for a orre t modeling in many appli ation domains. Indeed, the use of y les is allowed in all data models used in databases, and, as shown in the following se tions, in order to apture their semanti s in aluni the possibility of using y li assertions is fundamental.\nBesides in lusion assertions, some DL based systems also make use of equivalen e assertions (Bu hheit et al., 1993), whi h express both ne essary and suÆ ient onditions for an obje t to be an instan e of a on ept. Although this possibility is ruled out in aluni, this does not limit its ability of apturing both frame based systems and database models, where the onstraints that an be expressed orrespond naturally to in lusion assertions.\n2.3 Reasoning in aluni\nThe basi tasks we onsider when reasoning over an aluni knowledge base are on ept\nonsisten y and on ept subsumption:\nCon ept onsisten y is the problem of de iding whether a on ept C is onsistent in a knowledge base K (written as K 6j= C ?), i.e., whether K admits a model I su h that C I 6= ;.\nCon ept subsumption is the problem of de iding whether a on ept C\n1\nis subsumed by\na on ept C\n2\nin a knowledge base K (written as K j= C\n1\nC\n2\n), i.e., whether C\nI 1\nC\nI 2\nfor ea h model I of K.\nThe in lusion of number restri tions and inverse roles in ALUNI and the ability in aluni of using arbitrary, possibly y li in lusion assertions allows one to onstru t a knowledge base in whi h a ertain on ept is onsistent but has ne essarily an empty extension in all nite models of the knowledge base. Similarly, a subsumption relation between two\non epts may hold only if in nite models of the knowledge base are ruled out and only nite\nmodels are onsidered.\nExample 2.2 Let K\neven\nbe the knowledge base shown in Figure 1. Intuitively, the asser-\ntions in K\neven\nstate that for ea h number there is an even number whi h doubles it, and\nthat all numbers whi h double it are even. Ea h even number is a number, doubles at most one number, and doubles only numbers. Observe that for any model I of K\neven\n, the univer-\nsal quanti ations together with the fun tionality of doubles in the assertions imply that ℄Even I ℄Number I , while the dire t in lusion assertion between Even and Number implies that ℄Even I ℄Number I . Therefore, the two on epts have the same ardinality, and sin e one is a sub- on ept of the other, if the domain is nite, their extensions oin ide. This does not ne essarily hold for in nite domains. In fa t, the names we have hosen suggest already an in nite model of the knowledge base in whi h Number and Even are interpreted di erently. The model is obtained by taking the natural numbers as domain, and interpreting Number as the whole domain, Even as the even numbers, and doubles as the set f(2n; n) j n 0g.\nThe example above shows that aluni does not have the nite model property, whi h states that if a on ept is onsistent in a knowledge base then the knowledge base admits a nite model in whi h the on ept has a nonempty extension. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between reasoning with respe t to unrestri ted models and reasoning with respe t to nite models. We all (unrestri ted) on ept onsisten y (written as K 6j=\nu\nC\n?) and (unrestri ted) on ept subsumption (written as K j=\nu\nA C) the reasoning tasks\nas des ribed above, i.e., arried out without restri ting the attention to nite models. The\norresponding reasoning tasks arried out by onsidering nite models only, are alled nite on ept onsisten y (written as K 6j=\nf\nC ?) and nite on ept subsumption (written as\nK j=\nf\nA C).\nExample 2.2 ( ont.) Summing up the previous onsiderations, we an say that Number is not subsumed by Even in K\neven\n, i.e., K\neven\n6j=\nu\nNumber Even, but is nitely subsumed, i.e.,\nK\neven\nj=\nf\nNumber Even. Equivalently Numberu:Even is onsistent in K\neven\n, i.e., K\neven\n6j=\nu\nNumberu:Even ?, but is not nitely onsistent, i.e., K\neven\nj=\nf\nNumberu:Even ?.\nA distinguishing feature of aluni is that reasoning both in the nite and in the unrestri ted ase is de idable. In parti ular, unrestri ted on ept satis ability and on ept subsumption are de idable in deterministi exponential time (De Gia omo & Lenzerini,\n1994a; Calvanese et al., 1994), and sin e reasoning in stri t sublanguages of aluni is already EXPTIME-hard (Calvanese, 1996 ), the known algorithms are omputationally optimal. Finite on ept onsisten y in aluni is also de idable in deterministi exponential time while nite on ept subsumption (in the general ase) is de idable in deterministi double exponential time (Calvanese, 1996 ). A more pre ise dis ussion on the methods for reasoning in aluni is provided in Se tion 6.2, while a detailed a ount of the adopted algorithms and an analysis of their omputational omplexity is presented by Calvanese (1996 ).\nIn the next se tions we show how the two forms of reasoning with respe t to unrestri ted and nite models, apture the reasoning tasks that are typi ally onsidered in di erent formalisms for the stru tured representation of knowledge."

      "text" : "Frame languages are based on the idea of expressing knowledge by means of frames, whi h are stru tures representing lasses of obje ts in terms of the properties that their instan es must satisfy. Su h properties are de ned by the frame slots, that onstitute the items of a frame de nition. Sin e the 70s a large number of frame systems have been developed, with di erent goals and di erent features. DLs bear a lose relationship with the kl-one family of frame systems (Woods & S hmolze, 1992). However, here we would like to onsider frame systems from a more general perspe tive, as dis ussed for example by Karp (1992), Karp, Myers, and Gruber (1995), and establish the orresponden e with aluni knowledge bases in this ontext.\nWe remark that we are restri ting our attention to those aspe ts that are related to the taxonomi stru ture. Moreover, as dis ussed below, we onsider assertional knowledge bases, where intensional knowledge is hara terized in terms of in lusion assertions rather than de nitions. In addition, we do not onsider those features that annot be aptured in a rst-order framework, su h as default values in the slots, atta hed pro edures, and the spe i ation of overriding inheritan e poli ies. Some of the issues on erning the modeling of these aspe ts in DLs are addressed by Donini, Lenzerini, Nardi, Nutt, and S haerf (1994), Donini, Nardi, and Rosati (1995), within a modal nonmonotoni extension of DLs."

Fikes and Kehler (1985) mention several reasoning servi es asso iated with frames, su h as:\nConsisten y he king, whi h amounts to verifying whether a frame F is satis able in a knowledge base. In parti ular, this involves both reasoning on ardinalities and\nhe king whether the ller of a given slot belongs to a ertain frame.\nInheritan e, whi h, in our ase, amounts to the ability of identifying whi h of the frames are more general than a given frame, sometimes alled all-super-of (Karp et al., 1995). All the properties of the more general frames are then inherited by the more spe i one. Su h a reasoning is therefore based on the more general ability to\nhe k the mutual relationhips between frame des riptions in the knowledge base.\nThese reasoning servi es are formalized in the rst-order semanti s as follows.\nDe nition 3.3 Let F be a frame knowledge base and F a frame in F . We say that F is\nonsistent in F if the rst-order senten e F ^9x.F (x) is satis able. Moreover, we say that\na frame des ription E is more general than F in F if F j= 8x.(F (x)! E(x)).\n3.3 Relationship between Frame Based Systems and aluni\nThe rst-order semanti s given above allows us to establish a straightforward relationship between frame languages and aluni. Indeed, we now present a translation from frame knowledge bases to aluni knowledge bases.\nWe rst de ne the fun tion that maps ea h frame expression into an ALUNI on ept\nexpression as follows:\nEvery frame name F is mapped into an atomi on ept (F ).\nEvery slot name S is mapped into an atomi role (S).\nEvery slot onstraint is mapped as follows\n(UNION H\n1\nH\n2\n) is mapped into (H\n1\n) t (H\n2\n):\n(INTERSECTION H\n1\nH\n2\n) is mapped into (H\n1\n) u (H\n2\n):\n(NOT H) is mapped into : (H):\nEvery frame expression of the form\nSuperClasses : F\n1\n; : : : ; F\nh\nMemberSlot : S\n1\nValueClass : H\n1\nCardinality.Min : m\n1\nCardinality.Max : n\n1\nMemberSlot : S\nk\nValueClass : H\nk\nCardinality.Min : m\nk\nCardinality.Max : n\nk\nis mapped into the lass expression\n(F\n1\n) u u (F\nh\n) u\n8 (S\n1\n). (H\n1\n) u 9\nm\n1\n(S\n1\n) u 9\nn\n1\n(S\n1\n) u\n8 (S\nk\n). (H\nk\n) u 9\nm\nk\n(S\nk\n) u 9\nn\nk\n(S\nk\n):\nThis mapping allows us to translate a frame knowledge base into an aluni knowledge base, as spe i ed in the following de nition.\nDe nition 3.4 The aluni knowledge base (F) = (A;P;T ) orresponding to a frame knowledge base F is obtained as follows:\nA onsists of one atomi on ept (F ) for ea h frame name F in F .\nP onsists of one atomi role (S) for ea h slot name S in F .\nT onsists of an in lusion assertion\n(F )\n_\n(E)\nfor ea h frame de nition\nFrame : F in KB F E\nin F .\nExample 3.2 ( ont.) We illustrate the translation on the frame knowledge base in Figure 2. The orresponding aluni knowledge base is shown in Figure 3.\nThe orre tness of the translation follows from the orresponden e between the settheoreti semanti s of aluni and the rst-order interpretation of frames (see for example Hayes, 1979; Borgida, 1996; Donini et al., 1996). We an observe that inverse roles are in fa t not ne essary for the formalization of frames. Indeed, the possibility of referring to the inverse of a slot has been rarely onsidered in frame knowledge representation systems (Some ex eptions are reported in Karp, 1992). Due to the absen e of inverse roles the distin tion between reasoning in nite and unrestri ted models is not ne essary 3 . Consequently, all the above mentioned forms of reasoning are aptured by unrestri ted on ept onsisten y and on ept subsumption in aluni knowledge bases. This is summarized in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.5 Let F be a frame knowledge-base, F be a frame in F , E be a frame des ription, and (F), (F ), and (E) be their translations in aluni. Then the following hold:\nF is onsistent in F if and only if (F) 6j=\nu\n(F ) ?.\nE is more general than F in F if and only if (F) j=\nu\n(F ) (E).\nProof. The laim dire tly follows from the semanti s of frame knowledge bases and the translation into DLs that we have adopted.\nBy Theorem 3.5 it be omes possible to exploit the methods for unrestri ted reasoning on aluni knowledge bases in order to reason on frame knowledge bases. Sin e the problem of reasoning, e.g., in KEE is already EXPTIME- omplete, we do not pay in terms of omputational omplexity for the expressiveness added by the onstru ts of aluni. In fa t, by resorting to the orresponden e with aluni it be omes possible to add to frame systems useful features, su h as the possibility of spe ifying the inverse of a slot (Karp, 1992), and still retain the ability to reason in EXPTIME."

      "text" : "Semanti data models were introdu ed primarily as formalisms for database s hema design. They provide a means to model databases in a mu h ri her way than traditional data models supported by Database Management Systems, and are be oming more and more important be ause they are adopted in most of the re ent database design methodologies and Computer Aided Software Engineering tools.\nThe most widespread semanti data model is the Entity-Relationship (ER) model introdu ed by Chen (1976). It has by now be ome a standard, extensively used in the design phase of ommer ial appli ations. In the ommonly a epted ER notation, lasses are alled entities and are represented as boxes, whereas relationships between entities are represented as diamonds. Arrows between entities, alled ISA relationships, represent in lusion assertions. The links between entities and relationships represent the ER-roles, to whi h number restri tions are asso iated. Dashed links are used whenever su h restri tions are re ned for more spe i entities. Finally, elementary properties of entities are modeled by attributes,\n3. If we eliminate from ALUNI inverse roles, then the resulting DL has the nite model property.\nwhose values belong to one of several prede ned domains, su h as Integer, String, or Boolean.\nThe ER model does not provide onstru ts for expressing expli it disjointness or disjun - tion of entities, but extensions of the model allow for the use of generalization hierar hies whi h represent a ombination of these two onstru ts. In order to keep the presentation simple, we do not onsider generalization hierar hies in the formalization we provide, although their addition would be straightforward. Similarly, we omit attributes of relations.\nWe now show that all relevant aspe ts of the ER model an be aptured in aluni, and thus that reasoning on an ER s hema an be redu ed to reasoning on the orresponding aluni knowledge base. Sin e aluni is equipped with apabilities to reason on knowledge bases, both with respe t to nite and unrestri ted models (see Se tion 6.2), the redu tion shows that reasoning on the ER model, and more generally on semanti data models, is de idable.\nAs in the ase of frame-based systems, we restri t our attention to those aspe ts that onstitute the ore of the ER model. For this reason we do not onsider some features, su h as keys and weak entities, that have been introdu ed in the literature (Chen, 1976), but appear only in some of the formalizations of the ER model and the methodologies for\non eptual modeling based on the model. A proposal for the treatment of keys in des ription\nlogi s is presented by Borgida and Weddell (1997).\nIn order to establish the orresponden e between the ER model and aluni, we present\nformal syntax and semanti s of ER s hemata."

If not stated otherwise, min\nS\n(E;R;U) is assumed to be 0 and\nmax\nS\n(E;R;U) is assumed to be 1.\nBefore spe ifying the formal semanti s of ER s hemata we give an intuitive des ription of\nthe omponents of a s hema. The relation\nS\nmodels the ISA-relationship between entities.\nWe do not need to make any spe ial assumption on the form of\nS\nsu h as a y li ity\nor inje tivity. The fun tion att\nS\nis used to model attributes of entities. If for example\natt\nS\nasso iates the A\nS\n-labeled tuple [A\n1\n: Integer; A\n2\n: String℄ to an entity E, then E has\ntwo attributes A\n1\n; A\n2\nwhose values are integers and strings respe tively. For simpli ity we\nassume attributes to be single-valued and mandatory, but we ould easily handle also multivalued attributes with asso iated ardinalities. The fun tion rel\nS\nasso iates a set of roles\nto ea h relationship symbol R, determining impli itly also the arity of R, and for ea h role U in su h set a distinguished entity, alled the primary entity for U in R. In a database satisfying the s hema only instan es of the primary entity are allowed to parti ipate in the relationship via the role U . The fun tion ard\nS\nspe i es ardinality onstraints, i.e.,\nonstraints on the minimum and maximum number of times an instan e of an entity may parti ipate in a relationship via some role. Sin e su h onstraints are meaningful only if the entity an e e tively parti ipate in the relationship, the fun tion is de ned only for the sub-entities of the primary entity. The spe ial value 1 is used when no restri tion is posed on the maximum ardinality. Su h onstraints an be used to spe ify both existen e dependen ies and fun tionality of relations (Cosmadakis & Kanellakis, 1986). They are often used only in a restri ted form, where the minimum ardinality is either 0 or 1 and the maximum ardinality is either 1 or 1. Cardinality onstraints in the form onsidered here have been introdu ed already by Abrial (1974) and subsequently studied by Grant and Minker (1984), Lenzerini and Nobili (1990), Ferg (1991), Ye, Parent, and Spa apietra (1994), Thalheim (1992).\nExample 4.2 Figure 4 shows a simple ER s hema modeling a state of a airs similar to the one represented by the KEE knowledge base in Figure 2. We have used the standard graphi notation for ER s hemata, ex ept for the dashed link, whi h represents the re nement of a ardinality onstraint for the parti ipation of a sub-entity (in our ase AdvCourse) in a relationship (in our ase ENROLLING)."

Entity satis ability amounts to he king whether a given entity an be populated in some legal database state (Atzeni & Parker Jr., 1986; Lenzerini & Nobili, 1990; Di Battista & Lenzerini, 1993), and orresponds to the notion of on ept onsisten y in DLs. Dedu ing inheritan e amounts to verifying whether in all databases that are legal for the s hema, every instan e of an entity is also an instan e of another entity. Su h implied ISA relationships an arise for di erent reasons. Either trivially, through the transitive losure of the expli it ISA relationships present in the s hema, or in more subtle ways, through spe i patterns of ardinality restri tions along y les in the s hema and the requirement of the database state to be nite (Lenzerini & Nobili, 1990; Cosmadakis et al., 1990).\nExample 4.4 Figure 5 shows an ER s hema modeling the same situation as the knowledge base of Example 2.2. Arguing exa tly as in that example we an on lude that the two entities Number and Even denote the same set of elements in every nite database legal for the s hema, although the ISA relation from Number to Even is not stated expli itly. It is implied, however, due to the y le involving the relationship and the two entities and due to the parti ular form of ardinality onstraints.\n4.3 Relationship between Entity-Relationship S hemata and aluni\nWe now show that the di erent forms of reasoning on ER s hemata are aptured by nite\non ept onsisten y and nite on ept subsumption in aluni. The orresponden e between the two formalisms is established by de ning a translation from ER s hemata to aluni knowledge bases, and then proving that there is a orresponden e between legal database states and nite models of the derived knowledge base.\nDe nition 4.5 Let S = (L\nS\n;\nS\n; att\nS\n; rel\nS\n; ard\nS\n) be an ER s hema.

We illustrate the translation on the ER s hema of Figure 4. The aluni knowledge base that aptures exa tly its semanti s is shown in Figure 6, where for brevity the disjointness assertions (7) are omitted, and assertions with the same on ept on the left hand side are ollapsed.\nThe translation makes use of both inverse attributes and number restri tions to apture the semanti s of ER s hemata. We observe that, by means of the inverse onstru tor, a binary relationship ould be treated in a simpler way by hoosing a traversal dire tion and mapping the relationship dire tly to a role. Noti e also that the assumption of a y li ity of the resulting knowledge base is unrealisti in this ase, and in order to exploit the orresponden e for reasoning in the ER model, we need te hniques that an deal with inverse attributes, number restri tions, and y les together. As shown in Example 2.2, the ombination of these fa tors auses the nite model property to fail to hold, and we need to resort to reasoning methods for nite models.\nIn fa t, we an redu e reasoning in the ER model to nite model reasoning in aluni knowledge bases. For this purpose we de ne a mapping between database states orresponding to an ER s hema and nite interpretations of the knowledge base derived from it. Due to the possible presen e of relations with arity greater than 2, this mapping is however not one-to-one and we rst need to hara terize those interpretations of the knowledge base that dire tly orrespond to database states.\nDe nition 4.6 Let S = (L\nS\n;\nS\n; att\nS\n; rel\nS\n; ard\nS\n) be an ER s hema and (S) be de ned\nas above. An interpretation I of (S) is relation-des riptive, if for every relationship R 2 R\nS\n, with rel\nS\n(R) = [U\n1\n:E\n1\n; : : : ; U\nk\n:E\nk\n℄, for every d; d\n0\n2 ( (R))\nI\n, we have that\n(\n^\n1 i k\n8d\n00\n2\nI\n. ((d; d\n00\n) 2 ( (U\ni\n))\nI\n$ (d\n0\n; d\n00\n) 2 ( (U\ni\n))\nI\n))! d = d\n0\n: (8)\nIntuitively, the extension of a relationship in a database state is a set of labeled tuples, and su h a set does not ontain the same element twi e. Therefore it is impli it in the semanti s of the ER model that there annot be two labeled tuples onne ted through all roles of the relationship to exa tly the same elements of the domain. In a model of the aluni knowledge base orresponding to the ER s hema, on the other hand, ea h tuple is represented by a new individual, and the above ondition is not impli it anymore. It also\nannot be imposed in aluni by suitable assertions. The following lemma, however, shows that we do not need su h an expli it ondition, when we are interested in reasoning on an aluni knowledge base orresponding to an ER s hema. This is due to the fa t that we an always restri t ourselves to onsidering only relation-des riptive models.\nLemma 4.7 Let S be an ER s hema, (S) be the aluni knowledge base obtained from S a ording to De nition 4.5, and C be a on ept expression of (S). If C is nitely onsistent in (S), then there is a nite relation-des riptive model I of (S) su h that C I 6= ;.\nProof. Let I\n0\nbe a nite model of (S) su h that C\nI\n6= ;. We an build a nite relation-\ndes riptive model I\n0\nby starting from I\n0\nand applying the following onstru tion on e for\nea h relationship in R\nS\n.\nLet I be the model obtained in the previous step and let R 2 R\nS\nwith rel\nS\n(R) =\n[U\n1\n:E\n1\n; : : : ; U\nk\n:E\nk\n℄ be the next relationship to whi h we apply the onstru tion. We on-\nstru t from I a model I\nR\nsu h that ondition 8 is satis ed for relationship R.\nGiven an individual r 2 ( (R))\nI\n, we denote by U\ni\n(d), i 2 f1; : : : ; kg the (unique)\nindividual e su h that (r; e) 2 ( (U\ni\n))\nI\n. For e\ni\n2 ( (E\ni\n))\nI\n, i 2 f1; : : : ; kg we de ne\nX\n(U\n1\n:e\n1\n;:::;U\nk\n:e\nk\n)\n= fr 2 ( (R))\nI\nj U\ni\n(d) = e\ni\n; for i 2 f1; : : : ; kgg. We all on i t-set\na set X\n(U\n1\n:e\n1\n;:::;U\nk\n:e\nk\n)\nwith more than one element. From ea h on i t-set X\n(U\n1\n:e\n1\n;:::;U\nk\n:e\nk\n)\nwe randomly hoose one individual r, and we say that the others indu e a on i t on (U\n1\n: e\n1\n; : : : ; U\nk\n: e\nk\n). We all Conf the ( nite) set of all obje ts indu ing a on i t on some\n(U\n1\n: e\n1\n; : : : ; U\nk\n: e\nk\n).\nWe de ne an interpretation I\n2\nConf\nas the disjoint union of 2\n℄Conf\nopies of I, one opy,\ndenoted by I\nZ\n, for every set Z 2 2\nConf\n.

Thus we are using an open semanti s for re ords, whi h is typi al of obje t-oriented data models (Abiteboul & Kanellakis, 1989).\nIn order to hara terize obje t-oriented data models we onsider the instan es that are\nadmissible for the s hema.\nDe nition 5.4 Let S = (C\nS\n;A\nS\n;D\nS\n) be an obje t-oriented s hema. A database instan e\nJ of S is said to be legal (with respe t to S) if for ea h de laration\nClass C is-a C\n1\n; : : : ; C\nn\ntype-is T\nin D\nS\n, it holds that C\nJ\nC\nJ i for ea h i 2 f1; : : : ; ng, and that J (C J ) T J .\nTherefore, for a legal database instan e, the type expressions that are present in the s hema determine the ( nite) set of a tive values that must be onsidered. The onstru tion of su h values is limited by the depth of type expressions.\n5.3 Relationship between Obje t-Oriented S hemata and aluni\nWe establish now a relationship between aluni and the obje t-oriented language presented above. This is done by providing a mapping from obje t-oriented s hemata into aluni knowledge bases. Sin e the interpretation domain for aluni knowledge bases onsists of atomi obje ts, whereas ea h instan e of an obje t-oriented s hema is assigned a possibly stru tured value (see the de nition of V\nO\n), we need to expli itly represent some of the\nnotions that underlie the obje t-oriented language. In parti ular, while there is a orresponden e between on epts and lasses, one must expli itly a ount for the type stru ture of ea h lass. This an be a omplished by introdu ing in aluni on epts Abstra tClass, to represent the lasses, and Re Type and SetType to represent the orresponding types. The asso iations between lasses and types indu ed by the lass de larations, as well as the basi hara teristi s of types, are modeled by means of roles: the (fun tional) role value models the asso iation between lasses and types, and the role member is used for spe ifying the type of the elements of a set. Moreover, the on epts representing types are assumed to be mutually disjoint, and disjoint from the on epts representing lasses. These onstraints are expressed by adequate in lusion assertions that will be part of the knowledge base we are going to de ne.\nWe rst de ne the fun tion that maps ea h type expression into an ALUNI on ept\nexpression as follows:\nEvery lass C is mapped into an atomi on ept (C).\nEvery type expression Union T\n1\n; : : : ; T\nk\nEnd is mapped into (T\n1\n) t t (T\nk\n).\nEvery type expression Set-of T is mapped into SetType u 8member. (T ).\nEvery attribute A is mapped into an atomi role (A), and every type expression Re ord A\n1\n:T\n1\n; : : : ; A\nk\n:T\nk\nEnd is mapped into\nRe Type u 8 (A\n1\n). (T\n1\n) u 9\n=1\n(A\n1\n) u u\n8 (A\nk\n). (T\nk\n) u 9\n=1\n(A\nk\n):\nUsing we de ne the aluni knowledge base orresponding to an obje t-oriented s hema.\nDe nition 5.5 The aluni knowledge base (S) = (A;P;T ) orresponding to the obje toriented s hema S = (C\nS\n;A\nS\n;D\nS\n) is obtained as follows:\nA = fAbstra tClass; Re Type; SetTypeg [ f (C) j C 2 C\nS\ng.\nP = fvalue; memberg [ f (A) j A 2 A\nS\ng.\nT onsists of the following assertions:\nAbstra tClass\n_\n9\n=1\nvalue\nRe Type\n_\n8value.?\nSetType\n_\n8value.? u :Re Type\nand for ea h lass de laration\nClass C is-a C\n1\n; : : : ; C\nn\ntype-is T\nin D\nS\n, an in lusion assertion\n(C)\n_\nAbstra tClassu (C\n1\n) u u (C\nn\n) u 8value. (T ):\nFrom the above translation we an observe that inverse roles are not ne essary for the formalization of obje t-oriented data models. Indeed, the possibility of referring to the inverse of an attribute is generally ruled out in su h models. However, this strongly limits the expressive power of the data model, as pointed out in re ent papers (see for example Albano, Ghelli, & Orsini, 1991; Cattell, 1994). Note also that the use of number restri tions is limited to the value 1, whi h orresponds to existen e onstraints and fun tionality, whereas union is used in a more general form than for example in the KEE system.\nExample 5.2 ( ont.) We illustrate the translation on the fragment of obje t-oriented s hema in Figure 7. The orresponding aluni knowledge base is shown in Figure 8.\nBelow we dis uss the e e tiveness of the translation . First of all observe that the aluni knowledge base (S) resulting from the translation of an obje t-oriented s hema S may admit models that do not have a dire t ounterpart among legal database instan es of S. More pre isely, both an interpretation of (S) and a database instan e of S an be viewed as a dire ted labeled graph: In the ase of an interpretation, the nodes are domain individuals and the ar s are labeled with roles. In the ase of a database instan e, the nodes are either obje t identi ers or a tive values, and an ar either onne ts an obje t identi er to its asso iated value (in whi h ase it is labeled with value), or is part of the sub-stru ture representing a set or re ord value (in whi h ase it is labeled with member or with an attribute, in a ordan e with the type of the value). In a legal database instan e of S, a value v is represented by a sub-stru ture that has the form of a nite tree with v as root, set and re ord values as intermediate nodes, and obje ts identi ers as leaves. Clearly, su h a substru ture does not ontain y les. Conversely, in a model of (S), there may be y les involving only nodes that are instan es of SetType and Re Type and in whi h all roles are di erent from value. We all su h y les bad. A model ontaining bad y les\nannot be put dire tly in orresponden e with a legal database instan e. Also, due to the open semanti s of re ords one annot adopt a di erent translation for whi h bad y les in the model are ruled out.\nExample 5.6 Consider the obje t-oriented s hema S, ontaining a single lass de laration\nClass C type-is Re ord a\n1\n: Re ord a\n2\n: Re ord a\n3\n: C End End End\na\n3\nvalue\nwhi h is translated to\nC\n_\nAbstra tClass u 8value.(Re Type u 9 =1 a\n1\nu 8a\n1\n.(Re Type u 9\n=1\na\n2\nu 8a\n2\n.(Re Type u 9\n=1\na\n3\nu 8a\n3\n.C))):\nFigure 9 shows a model of (S) represented as a graph. For larity, we have named the instan es of C, and hen e of Abstra tClass, with o and the instan es of Re Type with v. Observe the two di erent types of y les in the graph. The y le involving individuals o\n2\n; v\n3\n; v\n4\n, and v\n5\ndoes not ause any problems sin e it ontains an ar labeled with value,\nwhi h is not part of the stru ture onstituting a omplex value.

On the other hand, due to the bad y le involving v\n1\nand\nv\n2\n, individual v1 represents (together with o\n2\nonne ted via a\n3\nto v\n1\n) a re ord of in nite\ndepth.\nWe an nevertheless establish a orresponden e from nite models of (S) possibly ontaining bad y les to legal instan es of the obje t-oriented s hema S. This an be a hieved by unfolding the bad y les in a model of (S) to in nite trees. Obviously, the unfolding of a y le into an in nite tree, generates an in nite number of nodes, whi h would orrespond to an in nite database state. However, we an restri t the dupli ation of individuals to those that represent set and re ord values, and thus are instan es of SetType and Re Type. The instan es of Abstra tClass, instead, are not dupli ated in the pro ess of unfolding, and therefore their number remains nite. Moreover, sin e the set of possible a tive values asso iated with ea h obje t identi er is bound by the depth of the s hema, we\nan in fa t blo k the unfolding of bad y les to the nite tree of depth equal to the depth\nof the s hema.\nLet us rst formally de ne the depth of an obje t-oriented s hema S.\nDe nition 5.7 For a type expression T we de ne depth(T ) indu tively as follows:\ndepth(T ) =\n8 > > <\n> > :\n0; if T = C. max\n1 i k\n(depth(T\ni\n)); if T = Union T\n1\n; : : : ; T\nk\nEnd.\n1 + depth(T\n0\n); if T = Set-of T\n0\n.\n1 + max\n1 i k\n(depth(T\ni\n)); if T = Re ord A\n1\n:T\n1\n; : : : ; A\nk\n:T\nk\nEnd.\nThe depth of an obje t-oriented s hema S is de ned as the maximum of depth(T ) for a type expression T in S.\nvalue\na\na\na\na\na\n3\nWe an now introdu e the notion of unfolding of an aluni interpretation.\nDe nition 5.8 Let S be an obje t-oriented s hema, (S) its translation in aluni and I a nite interpretation of (S). We all unfolded version of I the interpretation obtained from I as follows: For ea h individual v that is part of a bad y le, unfold the bad y le into an (in nite) tree having v as root, by generating new individuals only for the instan es of Re Type and SetType.

Based on Proposition 5.9, we an show that these forms of reasoning are fully aptured by nite on ept\nonsisten y and nite on ept subsumption in aluni knowledge bases.\nTheorem 5.10 Let S be an obje t-oriented s hema, T; T\n0\ntwo type expressions in S, and\n(S) the translation of S. Then the following holds:\n1. T is onsistent in S if and only if (S) 6j=\nf\n(T ) ?.\n2. T is a subtype of T\n0\nin S if and only if (S) j=\nf\n(T ) (T\n0\n).\nProof. The proof is analogous to the proof of Theorem 4.9, but it makes use of Proposition 5.9 instead of Proposition 4.8.\nAgain, the orresponden e with aluni established by Theorem 5.10 allows us to make use of the reasoning te hniques developed for aluni to reason on obje t-oriented s hemas. Observe that reasoning in obje t-oriented models is already PSPACE-hard (Bergamas hi & Nebel, 1994) and thus the known algorithms are exponential. However, by resorting to aluni, it be omes possible to take into a ount for reasoning also various extensions of the obje t-oriented formalism. Su h extensions are useful for on eptual modeling and have already been proposed in the literature (Cattell & Barry, 1997). First of all, the same\nonsiderations developed for the ER model with regard to the use of arbitrary boolean onstru ts on lasses an be applied also in the obje t-oriented setting, whi h provides disjun tion but does not admit any form of negation. Additional features that an be added to obje t oriented models are inverses of attributes, ardinality onstraints on set-valued attributes, and more general forms of restri tions on the values of attributes."

The analysis makes it lear that several diÆ ulties arise in identifying a ommon framework for the formalisms developed in di erent areas. Some re ent papers address this problem. For example, an analysis of the relationships between frame-based languages and types in programming languages has been arried out by Borgida (1992), while Bergamas hi and Sartori (1992), Piza, S hewe, and S hmidt (1992) use frame-based languages to enri h the dedu tive apabilities of semanti and obje t-oriented data models.\nArtale, Cesarini, and Soda (1996) study reasoning in obje t-oriented data models by presenting a translation to DLs in the style of the one dis ussed in Se tion 5.

The\norresponden e, whi h has rst been pointed out by S hild (1991), relies on a substantial similarity of the interpretative stru tures of both formalisms, and allows one to exploit the reasoning te hniques developed for PDLs to reason in the orresponding DLs. In parti ular, sin e ALUNI, the des ription language of aluni, in ludes the onstru t for inverse roles, for the orresponden e one has to resort to onverse-PDL, a variant of PDL that in ludes\nonverse programs (Kozen & Tiuryn, 1990). However, be ause of the presen e of number restri tions in ALUNI whi h have no dire t orresponden e in PDLs, we annot rely on traditional te hniques for reasoning in PDLs.

Reasoning in onverse-PDL is de idable in EXPTIME (Kozen & Tiuryn, 1990), and sin e the en oding is polynomial (De Gia omo & Lenzerini, 1994a) we obtain an EXPTIME de ision pro edure for unrestri ted on ept onsisten y and on ept subsumption in aluni knowledge bases.

Indeed, the PDL formula orresponding to an aluni knowledge base\nontains onstru ts both for onverse programs ( orresponding to inverse roles) and for fun tionality of dire t and inverse programs, and thus is a formula of a variant of PDL whi h does not have the nite model property (Vardi, 1985). However, after en oding fun tionality, one obtains a onverse-PDL formula, and sin e onverse-PDL has the nite model property (Fis her & Ladner, 1979), this formula is satis able if and only if it is\nnitely satis able. This shows that the en oding of number restri tions (and in parti ular the en oding of fun tionality), while preserving unrestri ted satis ability does not preserve\nnite satis ability (De Gia omo & Lenzerini, 1994a).\nFor nite model reasoning in aluni one an adopt a di erent te hnique, whi h is based on the idea of separating the reasoning pro ess in two distin t phases (see Calvanese, 1996 , for full details). The rst phase deals with all onstru ts ex ept number restri tions, and builds an \\expanded knowledge base\" in whi h these onstru ts are embedded impli itly in the on epts and roles. In the se ond phase the assertions involving number restri tions are used to derive from this expanded knowledge base a system of linear inequalities. The system is de ned in su h a way that its solutions of a ertain type (a eptable solutions) are dire tly related to the nite models of the original knowledge base. In parti ular, from ea h a eptable solution one an dire tly dedu e the ardinalities of the extensions of all on epts and roles in a possible nite model. The proposed method allows one to establish for aluni EXPTIME de idability for nite on ept onsisten y and for spe ial ases of nite on ept subsumption. By resorting to a more ompli ated en oding one an obtain a 2EXPTIME de ision pro edure for nite on ept subsumption in aluni in general (Calvanese, 1996a, 1996 ).\nReasoning with respe t to nite models has also been investigated in the ontext of dependen y theory in databases. As shown by Casanova, Fagin, and Papadimitriou (1984) for the relational model, when fun tional and in lusion dependen ies intera t, the dependen y impli ation problem in the nite ase di ers from the one in the unrestri ted ase. While the impli ation problem for arbitrary fun tional and in lusion dependen ies is unde idable (Chandra & Vardi, 1985; Mit hell, 1983), for fun tional and unary in lusion dependen ies it is solvable in polynomial time, both in the nite and the unrestri ted ase (Cosmadakis et al., 1990).\nConsisten y with respe t to nite models of s hemata expressed in an enri hed EntityRelationship model with ardinality onstraints has been shown de idable in polynomial time by Lenzerini and Nobili (1990). Calvanese and Lenzerini (1994b) extend the de idability result to in lude also ISA relationships, and Calvanese and Lenzerini (1994a) show EXPTIME de idability of reasoning in an expressive obje t-oriented model. An algorithm for omputing a re nement ordering for types (the analogue to a on ept hierar hy) in the framework of the O\n2\nobje t oriented model in dis ussed by Le luse and Ri hard (1989).\nReasoning in the stri t sublanguage of aluni obtained by omitting inverse roles and number restri tions is already EXPTIME-hard (Calvanese, 1996b). Therefore, the known algorithms for de iding unrestri ted on ept onsisten y and subsumption and nite on ept\nonsisten y are essentially optimal."

In this sense, the work reported here not only provides a ommon powerful representation formalism, but may also ontribute to signi ant developments for the languages belonging to all the three families. For example, the usage of inverse roles in on ept languages greatly enhan es the expressivity of roles, while the ombination of ISA, number restri tions, and union enri hes the reasoning apabilities available in semanti data models.\nSe ondly, the omparison of lass-based formalisms from the elds of knowledge representation and on eptual data modeling makes it feasible to address the development of reasoning tools to support on eptual modeling (Calvanese et al., 1998). In fa t, reasoning apabilities be ome espe ially important in omplex s enarios su h as those arising in heterogenous database appli ations and Data Warehousing. This line of work was among the motivations for developing systems based on expressive des ription logi s (Horro ks, 1998; Horro ks & Patel-S hneider, 1999), and has lead to further extending the language of des ription logi s to support Information Integration and, more spe i ally, the on eptual modeling of Data Warehouses (Calvanese, De Gia omo, Lenzerini, Nardi, & Rosati, 1998).\nReferen es\nAbiteboul, S., Kanellakis, P., Ramaswamy, S., & Waller, E.

    "abstractText" : "The notion of lass is ubiquitous in omputer s ien e and is entral in many formalisms for the representation of stru tured knowledge used both in knowledge representation and in databases. In this paper we study the basi issues underlying su h representation formalisms and single out both their ommon hara teristi s and their distinguishing features. Su h investigation leads us to propose a unifying framework in whi h we are able to apture the fundamental aspe ts of several representation languages used in di erent ontexts. The proposed formalism is expressed in the style of des ription logi s, whi h have been introdu ed in knowledge representation as a means to provide a semanti ally well-founded basis for the stru tural aspe ts of knowledge representation systems. The des ription logi onsidered in this paper is a subset of rst order logi with ni e omputational hara teristi s. It is quite expressive and features a novel ombination of onstru ts that has not been studied before. The distinguishing onstru ts are number restri tions, whi h generalize existen e and fun tional dependen ies, inverse roles, whi h allow one to refer to the inverse of a relationship, and possibly y li assertions, whi h are ne essary for apturing real world domains. We are able to show that it is pre isely su h ombination of onstru ts that makes our logi powerful enough to model the essential set of features for de ning lass stru tures that are ommon to frame systems, obje t-oriented database languages, and semanti data models. As a onsequen e of the established orresponden es, several signi ant extensions of ea h of the above formalisms be ome available. The high expressiveness of the logi we propose and the need for apturing the reasoning in di erent ontexts for es us to distinguish between unrestri ted and nite model reasoning. A notable feature of our proposal is that reasoning in both ases is de idable. We argue that, by virtue of the high expressive power and of the asso iated reasoning apabilities on both unrestri ted and nite models, our logi provides a ommon ore for lass-based representation formalisms.",
