      "text" : "Recent works on word representations mostly rely on predictive models. Distributed word representations (aka word embeddings) are trained to optimally predict the contexts in which the corresponding words tend to appear. Such models have succeeded in capturing word similarities as well as semantic and syntactic regularities. Instead, we aim at reviving interest in a model based on counts. We present a systematic study of the use of the Hellinger distance to extract semantic representations from the word co-occurrence statistics of large text corpora. We show that this distance gives good performance on word similarity and analogy tasks, with a proper type and size of context, and a dimensionality reduction based on a stochastic low-rank approximation. Besides being both simple and intuitive, this method also provides an encoding function which can be used to infer unseen words or phrases. This becomes a clear advantage compared to predictive models which must train these new words."

      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Linguists assumed long ago that words occurring in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings (Harris, 1954, Firth, 1957). Using the word co-occurrence statistics is thus a natural choice to embed similar words into a common vector space (Turney and Pantel, 2010, Pennington et al., 2014). Common approaches calculate the frequencies, apply some transformations\n(tf-idf, PPMI), reduce the dimensionality and calculate the similarities (Lowe, 2001). Considering a fixedsized word dictionary D and a set of words W to embed, the co-occurrence matrix C is of size |W| × |D|. C is then dictionary size-dependent. One can apply a dimensionality reduction operation to C leading to C̄ ∈ R|W|×d, where d |D|. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are widely used (e.g. LSA (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), ICA (Väyrynen and Honkela, 2004)). In Bullinaria and Levy (2007, 2012), the authors provide a full range of factors to use for properly extracting semantic representations from the word cooccurrence statistics of large text corpora. While word co-occurrence statistics are discrete distributions, an information theory measure such as the Hellinger distance seems to be more appropriate than the Euclidean distance over a discrete distribution space. In this respect, Lebret and Collobert (2014) propose to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of the word cooccurrence probability matrix to represent words in a lower dimensional space, while minimizing the reconstruction error according to the Hellinger distance. In practice, they just apply a square-root transformation to the co-occurrence probability matrix, and then perform the PCA of this new matrix. They compare the resulting word representations with some well-known representations on named entity recognition and movie review tasks and show that they can reach similar or even better performance.\nThis paper proposes an extension of the work of Lebret and Collobert (2014) by investigating the impact of different factors. Mikolov et al. (2013b) show that a subsampling approach to imbalance between the rare and frequent words improves the performance. Recent approaches for word representation have also shown that large windows of context are helpful to capture semantic information (Mikolov et al., 2013b, Pennington et al., 2014). While, in Lebret and Collobert (2014), only the 10,000 most frequent words from the dictionary W are considered as context dictionary D, we\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n49 30\nv2 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n8 A\npr 2\n01 5\nRehabilitation of Count-based Models for Word Vector Representations\ninvestigate various types of context dictionaries, with only frequent words or rare words, or a combination of both. In this previous work, the co-occurrence counts to build C are based on a single context word occurring just after the word of interest. In this paper, we analyse various sizes of context, with both symmetric and asymmetric windows. For deriving lowdimensional vector representations from the word cooccurrence matrix C, PCA can be done by eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix CTC or SVD of C. Covariance-based PCA of high-dimensional matrices can lead to round-off errors, and thus fails to properly approximate these high-dimensional matrices in low-rank matrices. And SVD will generally requires a large amount of memory to factorize such huge matrices. To overcome these barriers, we propose a dimensionality reduction based on stochastic low-rank approximation and show that it outperforms the covariance-based PCA.\nRecently, distributed approaches based on neural network language models have revived the field of learning word embeddings (Collobert and Weston, 2008, Huang and Yates, 2009, Turian et al., 2010, Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013, Mikolov et al., 2013a). Such approaches are trained to optimally predict the contexts in which words from W tend to appear. Baroni et al. (2014) present a systematic comparison of these predictive models with the models based on co-occurrence counts, which suggests that context-predicting models should be chosen over their count-based counterparts. In this paper, we aim at showing that count-based models should not be buried so hastily. A neural network architecture can be hard to train. Finding the right hyperparameters to tune the model is often a challenging task and the training phase is in general computationally expensive. Counting words over large text corpora is on the contrary simple and fast. With a proper dimensionality reduction technique, word vector representations in a low-dimensional space can be generated. Furthermore, it gives an encoding function represented by a matrix which can be used to encode new words or even phrases based on their counts. This is a major benefit compared to predictive models which will need to train vector representations for them. Thus, in addition to being simple and fast to compute, count-based models become a simple, fast and intuitive solution for inference."

Keeping this famous quote in\nmind, word co-occurrence probabilities are computed by counting the number of times each context word c ∈ D (where D ⊆ W) occurs around a word w ∈ W:\np(c|w) = p(c, w) p(w) = n(c, w)∑ c n(c, w) , (1)\nwhere n(c, w) is the number of times a context word c occurs in the surrounding of the word w. A multinomial distribution of |D| classes (words) is thus obtained for each word w:\nPw = {p(c1|w), . . . , p(c|D||w)} . (2)\nBy repeating this operation over all words from W, the word co-occurrence matrix C is thus obtained:\nC =  p(c1|w1) · · · p(c|D||w1) p(c1|w2) · · · p(c|D||w2) ... . . .\n... p(c1|w|W|) · · · p(c|D||w|W|)\n =  Pw1 Pw2\n...

Because we are facing discrete probability distributions, the Hellinger distance seems appropriate to calculate similarities between these word representations. The square-root transformation is then applied to the probability distributions Pw, and the word co-occurrence matrix is now defined as:\nC̃ =  √ Pw1√ Pw2 ...√\nPw|W|  = √C . (4)"

Considering two discrete probability distributions P = (p1, . . . , pk) and Q = (q1, . . . , qk), the Hellinger distance is formally defined as:\nH(P,Q) = 1√ 2 √√√√ k∑ i=1 ( √ pi − √ qi)2 , (5)\nwhich is directly related to the Euclidean norm of the difference of the square root vectors:\nH(P,Q) = 1√ 2 ‖ √ P −\n√ Q‖2 .

However, performance dramatically drop with this window size on the latter. It seems that a limited window size helps to find syntactic similarities, but a large window is needed to detect the semantic aspects. The best results are thus obtained with a symmetric window of 10 words on the semantic analogy questions task. This intuition is confirmed by looking at the nearest neighbors of certain rare words with different sizes of context. In Table 1, we can observe that a window of one context word brings together words that occur in a same syntactic structure, while a window of ten context words will go beyond that and add semantic information. With only one word of context, Lake Baikal is therefore neighbor to other lakes, and the word special-needs is close to other words composed of two words. With ten words of con-\ntext, the nearest neighbors of Baikal are words in direct relation to this location, i.e. these words cannot match with other lakes, like Lake Titicaca. This also applies for the word special-needs, where we find words related to the educational meaning of this word. This could explain why the symmetric window of one context word gives the best results on the word similarity and syntactic tasks, but performs very poorly on the semantic task. Finally, the use of a symmetric window instead of an asymmetric one always improves the performance."

An in-between situation with words whose appearance frequency is greater than 10−6 gives also quite similar performance. Secondly, discarding the most frequent words from the context distributions helps, in general, to increase performance. The best performance is indeed obtained with scenarios (3) and (4). But all rare words are not necessarily essential to achieve good performance, since results with words whose appearance frequency is less than 10−5 and greater than 10−6 are not significantly lower. These two observations might be explained by the sparsity of the probability distributions. Counts in Table 2 show significant differences in terms of sparsity depending on the type of context. Similarities between words seem to be easier to find with sparse distributions. The average number of context words (i.e. features) whose appearance frequency is less than 10−5 and greater than 10−6 with a symmetric window of size 1 is extremely low (132). Performance with these parameters are still highly competitive on syntactic tasks. Within this framework, it then becomes a good option for representing words in a low and sparse dimension."

The average number of context words is much larger within these parameters, which justifies the need of dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, this analysis show that a large number of context words is not necessary to achieve significant improvements. Good performance on syntactic and similarity tasks can be reached with the\nRehabilitation of Count-based Models for Word Vector Representations\n10,000 most frequent words as context.

We thus analyse the impact of the number of dimensions using the Hellinger PCA of the cooccurrence matrix from scenario (1) with a symmetric context of five and ten words. Figure 2 reports performance on the benchmark datasets described in Section 3.2 for different numbers of dimensions. The ability of the PCA to summarize the information compactly leads to improved results on the word similarity tasks, where performance is better than with no dimensionality reduction. On the WS-353 and RG-65 datasets, we observe that the gain in performance tends to stabilize between 300 and 1,200 dimensions. The increase in di-\nmension leads to a small drop after 100 dimensions on the RW dataset. However, adding more and more dimensions helps to increase performance on word analogy tasks, especially for the semantic one.

Experiments with symmetric window of five and ten context words are run to embed word representations in a d-dimensional vector, with d = {100, 200, 300}. All results are reported in Table 3. Except for some isolated results, performance is always much better with the stochastic low-rank approximation approach than with a Hellinger PCA approach. Calculating the reconstruction error of both approaches confirms that the PCA fails somehow to properly reduce the dimensionality. For a reduction from 10,000 to 100 dimensions, the PCA reconstruction error is 532.2 compared with 440.3 for the stochastic low-rank approximation. This result is not really surprising, since it is wellknown that standard PCA is exceptionally fragile, and\nthe quality of its output can suffer dramatically in the face of only a few grossly corrupted points (Jolliffe, 1986). Covariance-based PCA as proposed in Lebret and Collobert (2014) is thus not an approach offering a complete guarantee of success. An approach to robustifying PCA must be considered. This is what we propose with the stochastic low-rank approximation which, moreover, ensures a low memory consumption. For a given dimension, a window of ten context words outperforms, in general, a window of five context words. This confirms once again the benefit of using a larger window of context. Performance are globally better with 300 dimensions, but performance with 200 dimensions is just slightly lower, or even better in certain cases. Finally, using a distribution of rare words instead of frequent words (i.e. scenario (4) instead of scenario (1) here) has only an impact on the semantic word analogy task."

Distributed word representations (aka word embeddings) are trained to optimally predict the contexts in which the corresponding words tend to appear. Such models have succeeded in capturing word similarities as well as semantic and syntactic regularities. Instead, we aim at reviving interest in a model based on counts. We present a systematic study of the use of the Hellinger distance to extract semantic representations from the word co-occurrence statistics of large text corpora. We show that this distance gives good performance on word similarity and analogy tasks, with a proper type and size of context, and a dimensionality reduction based on a stochastic low-rank approximation. Besides being both simple and intuitive, this method also provides an encoding function which can be used to infer unseen words or phrases. This becomes a clear advantage compared to predictive models which must train these new words.",
