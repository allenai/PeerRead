      "text" : "For many language technology applications such as speech recognition [1] and machine translation [2], a high quality Language Model (LM) is considered to be a key component to success. Traditionally, LMs aim to predict probable sequences of predefined linguistic units, which are typically words. These predictions are guided by the semantic and syntactic properties that are encoded by the LM.\nThe recent advances in neural network-based approaches for language modeling led to a significant improvement over the standard N -gram models [3, 4]. This is mainly due to the continuous word representations they provide, which typically overcome the exponential growth of parameters that N -gram models require. The NN-based LMs were first introduced by Bengio et al. [5], who proposed a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model as an alternative to N -grams. Although FNNs were shown to perform very well for different tasks [6, 7], their fixed context (word history) size constraint was a limiting factor for their performance. In order to overcome this constraint, Mikolov et al. [8, 9] proposed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which allows context information to cycle in the network. Investigating the inherent shortcomings of RNNs led to the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based LMs [10], which explicitly control the longevity of context information in the network. This chain of novel NN-based LMs continued with more complex and advanced models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [11] and autoencoders [12], to name a few.\nThis research was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of SFB 1102.\nLMs performance has been shown to significantly improve using model combination. This is typically done by either 1) designing deep networks with different architectures at the different layers, as it was done in [11], which combines LSTM, CNN and a highway network, or by 2) combining different models at the output layer, as it is done in the maximum entropy RNN model [13], which uses direct N -gram connections to the output layer, or using the classical linear interpolation [14]. While the former category, requires a careful selection of the architectures to combine for a well-suited feature design, and can be difficult/slow to train, the second category knows a significant increase in the number of parameters when combining multiple models.\nMotivated by the work in [13], we have recently proposed a Sequential Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN) [15], which combines FFN information and RNN. In this paper, we continue along this line of work by proposing a generalized framework to combine different heterogeneous NN-based architectures in a single mixture model. More particularly, the proposed architecture uses 1) a hidden feature layer to, separately, learn each of the models to be combined, and 2) a hidden mixture layer, which combines the resulting model features. Moreover, this architecture uses a single word embedding matrix, which is learned from all models, and a single output layer. This framework is, in principle, able to combine different NN-based LMs (e.g., FNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.) with no direct constraints on the number of models to combine or their configurations.\nWe proceed as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the basic NN-based LMs. Section 3 introduces the proposed neural mixture model. Then, Section 4 evaluates the proposed network in comparison to different state-of-the-art language models for perplexity on the PTB and the LTCB corpus. Finally, we conclude in Section 5."

This category typically leads to a significant increase in the number of parameters when combining multiple models.\nIn a first attempt to circumvent these problems, we have recently proposed an SRNN model [15], which combines FFN information and RNN through additional sequential connections at the hidden layer. Although SRNN was successful and did not noticeably suffer from the aforementioned problems, it was solely designed to combine RNN and FNN and is, therefore, not well-suited for other architectures. This paper continues along this line of work by proposing a general architecture to combine different heterogeneous neural models with no direct constraints on the number or type of models."

The latter are independent of the sizes of the mixture models. In doing so, this model does not suffer from the significant parameter growth when increasing the number of models in the mixture. We can also see that this architecture does not impose any direct constraints on the number of models to combine, their size or their type. Hence, we can combine, for instance, models of the same type but with different sizes/configurations, as we can combine heterogeneous models such as recurrent and non-recurrent models, in a single mixture.\nMoreover, the mixture models can also be deep architectures with multiple hidden layers."

More particularly, the error at the output layer is propagated to all models in the mixture. At this stage, each model receives a network error, updates its parameters, and propagates its error to the shared word embedding (input) layer. We should also mention here that recurrent models can be “unfolded” in time, independently of the other models in the mixture, as it is done for standard networks. Once each model is updated, the continuous word representations are then updated as well while taking into account the individual network errors emerging from the different models in the mixture (see illustration in Fig. 1).\nThe joint training of the mixture models is expected to lead to a “complementarity” effect. We mean by “complementarity” that the mixture models perform poorly when evaluated separately but lead to a much better performance when tested jointly. This is typically a result of the models learning and modeling, eventually, different features. Moreover, the joint learning is also expected to lead to a richer and more expressive word embeddings."

We use a model dropout technique, which is inspired by the standard dropout regularization [16] that is widely used to train neural networks. The idea here is to have “models” replace “neurons” in the standard dropout. Therefore, for each training example, a model is to be dropped with a probability pd. Then, only models that are selected contribute to the mixture and have their parameters and mixing weights Sm updated. Similarly to standard dropout, model dropout is applied only to non-recurrent models in the mixture."

      "text" : "We evaluated the proposed architecture on two different benchmark tasks. The first set of experiments was conducted on the Penn Treebank (PTB) corpus using the standard division, e.g. [9, 17]; sections 0-20 are used for training while sections 21-22 and 23-24 are used for validation and testing. The vocabulary was limited to the 10k\nmost frequent words while the remaining words were all mapped to the token <unk>. In order to evaluate how the proposed approach scales to large corpora, we run a set of experiments on the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) [18]. This corpus is based on the enwik9 dataset which contains the first 109 bytes of enwiki-20060303-pages-articles.xml. We adopted the same trainingtest-validation data split and pre-processing from [17]. The vocabulary was limited to the 80k most frequent words. Details about the sizes of these two corpora and the percentage of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words that were mapped to <unk> can be found in Table 1.\nThe results reported below compare the proposed Neural Mixture Model (NMM) approach to the baseline NNLMs. In particular, we compare our model to the FNN-based LM [5], the full RNN [9] (without classes) as well as RNN with maximum entropy (RNNME) [13]. We also report results for the LSTM architecture [10], and the recently proposed SRNN model [15].\nAlthough the proposed approach was not designed for a particular mixture of models, we only report results for different combinations of FNN, RNN and LSTM, which are considered to be the baseline NNLMs. For clarity, an NMM result is presented as F\nN1,··· ,Nf S1,··· ,Sf +RS1,··· ,Sr + LS1,··· ,Sl , where f is the number of FNNs in the mixture, Sm,m = 1, · · · , f are their corresponding hidden layer sizes (that are fed to the mixture) and Nm,m = 1, · · · , f are their fixed history sizes. The same notation holds for RNN and LSTM, where r and l are the number of RNNs and LSTMs in the mixture, respectively, and Nr, Nl = 1. The number of models in the mixture is given by f + r + l. Moreover, the notation F\nNb−Ne Sf means that this model combines Ne −Nb +1 consecutive FNN models with respective history sizesNb, Nb+1, · · · , Ne, with all models having the same hidden layer size Sf ."

      "text" : "For the PTB experiments, all models have a hidden layer size of 400, with FFNN and SRNN using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) i.e., f(x) = max(0, x) as activation function and having 2 hidden layers. ReLu is also used as activation function for the mixture layer in NMMs, which use a single hidden layer. The embedding size is 100 for SRNN and NMMs, whereas it is set to 400 for RNN and 200 for FNN and LSTM. The training is performed using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a mini-batch size of 200. the learning rate is initialized to 0.4, the momentum is set to 0.9, the weight decay is fixed at 4x10−5, the model dropout is set to 0.4 and the training is done in epochs. The weights initialization follows the normalized initialization proposed in [19]. Similarly to [8], the learning rate is halved when no significant improvement in the log-likelihood of the validation data is observed. The BPTT was set to 5 time steps for all recurrent models. In the tables below, the results are reported in terms of perplexity (PPL), Number of model Parameters (NoP) and the Parameter Growth (PG) for NMM, which is defined as the relative increase in the number of parameters of NMM w.r.t. the baseline model in the table. In order to demonstrate the power of\nthe joint training, we also report the perplexity PPL and NoP of the Linearly Interpolated (LI) models in the mixture after training them separately. In this case, each model learns its own word embedding and output layer.\nThe PTB results reported in Table 2 show clearly that combining different small-size models with a reduced word embedding size results in a better perplexity performance compared to the baseline models, with a significant decrease in the NoP required by the mixture. More particularly, we can see that adding a single FNN model to a small size LSTM or RNN is sufficient to outperform the baseline models while reducing the number of parameters by 24% and 36%, respectively. The same conclusion can be drawn when combining an RNN with an LSTM. We can also see that adding more FNN models to each of these mixtures leads to additional improvements while keeping the number of parameters significantly small. Table 2 also shows that training the small size models (in the mixture) separately, and then linearly interpolating them, results in a slightly worse performance compared to the mixture model with a noticeable increase in the NoP. This conclusion emphasizes the importance of the joint training. Moreover, we can also see that mixing RNN and FNNs leads to a comparable performance to SRNN, which was particularly designed to enhance RNN with FNN information. The proposed approach, however, does not particularity encode the individual characteristics of the models in the mixture, which reflects its ability to include different types of NNLMs. We can also conclude that combining FNN with recurrent models leads to a more significant improvement when compared to mixtures of FNNs. This conclusion shows, similarly to other work e.g. [15, 13], that recurrent models can be further improved using N-gram/feedforward information, given that they model different linguistic features.\nFig. 2 is an extension of Table 2, which shows the change in the perplexity and NoP of different NMMs when iteratively adding more FFN models to the mixture. This figure confirms that combining heterogeneous models (combining LSTM or RNN with FNNs) achieves a better performance compared to combining only FNN models. We can also conclude from this figure that the improvement becomes very slow after adding 4 FNN models to each mixture."

      "heading" : "4.3. LTCB Experiments",
      "text" : "The LTCB experiments use the same PTB setup with minor changes. The results shown in Table 3 follow the same experimental setup used in [15]. More precisely, these results were obtained without usage of momentum, model dropout or weight decay whereas the\nmini-batch size was set to 400. The FNN architecture contains 2 hidden layers of size 600 whereas RNN, LSTM, SRNN and NMM have a single hidden layer of size 600.\nThe LTCB results shown in Table 3 generally confirm the PTB conclusions. In particular, we can see that combining recurrent models, with half (third for RNN) their original size, with a single FNN model leads to a comparable performance to the baseline models. Moreover, increasing the mixture models size (for LSTM) or increasing the number of FNNs (for RNN) improves the performance further with no noticeable increase in the NoP. Similarly to the PTB, we can also see that NMM achieves the same performance as the WISRNN model with a NoP reduction of 31% compared to the original RNN model. The FFN mixture results show a more significant improvement when combining multiple small-size (100) models compared to mixing few large models (600). This conclusion shows that the strength of mixture models lies in their ability to combine the learning capabilities of different models, even with small sizes."

This paper presents a novel framework, which shows that a significant improvement can be achieved by combining different existing heterogeneous models in a single architecture. This is done through 1) a feature layer, which separately learns different NN-based models and 2) a mixture layer, which merges the resulting model features. In doing so, this architecture benefits from the learning capabilities of each model with no noticeable increase in the number of model parameters or the training time. Extensive experiments conducted on the Penn Treebank (PTB) and the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) corpus showed a significant reduction of the perplexity when compared to state-of-the-art feedforward as well as recurrent neural network architectures.",
