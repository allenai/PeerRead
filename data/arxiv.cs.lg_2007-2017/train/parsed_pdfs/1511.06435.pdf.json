      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Deep learning methods have recently influenced several application domains, namely computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Russakovsky et al., 2014), speech recognition (Ding et al., 2014; Hannun et al., 2014), and nature language processing (Collobert et al., 2011b), where they have enjoyed significant performance improvements compared to state-of-art methods in the respective domains. For the latest list of domains and challenges on benchmark datasets where deep learning performed better than the existing state-of-art, see http://deeplearning4j.org/accuracy.html. Most of the successful deep learning architectures are composed of a combination of different types of layers such as fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent layers and are usually trained with a variant of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm along with various regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay (Bengio et al., 2015). As the popularity of the deep learning methods have increased over the last few years, several deep learning software frameworks have appeared to enable efficient development and implementation of these methods. The list of available frameworks includes, but is not limited to, Caffe, DeepLearning4J, deepmat, Eblearn, Neon, PyLearn, Theano, Torch, etc. Different frameworks try to optimize different aspects of training or deployment of a deep learning algorithm. For instance, Caffe emphasises ease of use where standard layers can be easily configured without hard-coding while Theano provides automatic differentiation capabilities which facilitates flexibility to modify architecture for research and development. Several of these frameworks have received wide attention from the research community and are well-developed allowing efficient training of deep networks with billions of parameters, thanks to their strong GPU backends. Developers have constantly improved these frameworks by adding more features (e.g. by adding support for different types of convolution algorithms) and speed improvements to attract\nmore users and foster research (Bergstra et al., 2011; Collobert et al., 2011a; Vasilache et al., 2014; Bastien et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2014). Recently, the efficacy of several deep learning frameworks have been evaluated in Chintala (2015a). However, the comparison is only focused on speed performance of the convolutional frameworks. Hence, this paper expands on the previous benchmarks and evaluates four deep learning frameworks, namely: Caffe, Neon, Theano, and Torch. Among the available software frameworks, Caffe, Theano, and Torch are indeed the top three well developed and widely used frameworks by the deep learning community. The reason for including Neon in this study is its recently reported state-of-the-art performance for training several deep learning architectures (Chintala, 2015a). We evaluate these frameworks from the perspective of practitioners, on the following aspects:\n• Extensibility: Their capability to incorporate different types of deep learning architectures (convolutional, fully-connected, and recurrent networks), different training procedures (unsupervised layer-wise pre-training and supervised learning), and different convolutional algorithms (e.g. FFT-based algorithm).\n• Hardware utilization: Their capability to incorporate hardware resources in either (multithreaded) CPU or GPU setting.\n• Speed: Their speed performance from both training and deployment perspectives.\nThe study will provide the users and enterprises a broad picture of the strengths and (current) limitations of the studied deep learning frameworks to enable them to assess suitability in the context of their requirements. Moreover, the discussions highlight the current limitations of the respective frameworks which can be addressed in their future developments 1. We plan to make the code for all the frameworks public in the near future.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a brief overview of the software frameworks we focus on in this paper; Section 3 describes the benchmarking set up which is followed by results and conclusions in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively."

      "heading" : "2 OVERVIEW OF THE DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORKS",
      "text" : "With deep learning methods gaining popularity in many applications domains over the last few years, there have been quite a lot of interest from many academic (e.g. Univ. of California Berkeley,\n1Note that most of these frameworks have very active community support that keeps adding new features/functionalities quickly making some of our observations obsolete in the near future.\nNYU) and industry groups (e.g. Google, Facebook) to develop software frameworks (e.g. Theano, Caffe) that help easily create and test various deep architectures. At the time this paper was written, some of the widely used software frameworks for deep learning were: Caffe, Theano, Torch, Neon, Chainer, DeepLearning4J, deepmat, Eblearn, MXNet, etc. (for a more complete list of Deep Learning Softwares see http://deeplearning.net/software_links/). Many of these frameworks are mature already as of today and are very fast in training deep networks with billions of parameters thanks to their strong CUDA backends. Today, almost every group training deep networks use Graphical Processing Units (GPU) to accelerate the training process and this has led to joint development of software libraries (e.g. cuDNN) between academic (e.g. Berkeley, NYU) and industry players (e.g. Nvidia). Table 1 shows the number of users in Google groups and the number of contributors2 for each of the frameworks in their corresponding GitHub repositories. It is clear that the top three widely developed and supported deep learning frameworks are Caffe, Theano, Torch, and are thus selected in this paper for the benchmarking purposes. We also evaluate the Neon framework from Nervana as it has recently shown the state-of-the-art performance for training convolutional networks (Chintala, 2015a). Table 2 shows the general properties of these four deep learning frameworks. Note that, for this paper, we restrict ourselves to frameworks built for single node (with potentially multiple GPUs) but not distributed deep learning frameworks like DeepLearning4J. For a brief review of the selected frameworks see Appendix."

      "text" : "We use two evaluation metrics for benchmarking the four software frameworks to obtain a holistic understanding of their performance under various system scenarios and application domains. Specifically we clock the speeds of these frameworks for the following operations:\n• Forward Time: We measure the time it takes for an input batch of a pre-selected batch size, for a given dataset and network, to flow through the entire network and produce the corresponding output. This is important as it indicates the latency of a deep network when deployed in real-world.\n• Gradient Computation Time: We also measure the time it takes to get the gradients for each measurable parameter in the deep network for a given input batch. This is an important indicator of the training time. Note that, for most of the cases (e.g. Torch), this gradient computation time is the summation of the times spent in calling the corresponding forward and backward functions as these two functions should be called consecutively to compute the gradients. But for Theano, this gradient computation time is measured by calling a Theano function that is compiled to generate the gradients given the inputs to the networks which implicitly performs the forward and backward steps through computational graphs. It should be noted that the gradient computation time we report, does not include the time taken to update the network parameters, such as computation of learning rate, weight decay, momentum term, etc."

Note that the evaluation metrics can\n2We only report the number of the contributors in the main repository of the framework. The numbers do not include any other relevant repositories.\nvary drastically based on the CUDA package used along with the native software. For example, in Torch, one can perform the convolution operations using Nvidia cuDNN library or cunn library (a CUDA backend for the nn package) or fbcunn library (deep learning CUDA extensions from Facebook AI Research containing FFT based fast convolutions). In Theano, it is also straightforward to perform convolution using cuDNN or conv-fft. The conv-fft is a FFT-based implementation of convolution operation on Theano. Hence we try to use as many libraries as possible for each of the cases and measure the performance to present the inherent tradeoffs with each of the libraries. We use the same blas library for Caffe, Theano, and Torch which performs majority of the computations when CPU is used. Neon uses its own CPU/GPU backend. Moreover, wherever applicable, we measure the speeds with both GPU and CPU (single and multi-threaded) so as to understand the hardware specific behaviours of these frameworks from both training and deployment perspectives. We perform several iterations of warm-ups before timing the operations. The timing reported here are average of at 20-1000 iterations and are controlled to have small standard deviations."

      "heading" : "4.1 LENET",
      "text" : "The first benchmark is a slightly modified LeNet neural network on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al., 1998) where the sigmoid activations are replaced with ReLU units and softmax logistic loss layer is used instead of the RBF network. It consists of two convolutionpooling layers with the tanh activation functions and two fully connected layers. For Caffe, the network is available in the Caffe model repository. For Theano, the code is adopted from LISA Lab (2014). For Torch, we used the “mnist” package for easily loading the dataset and wrote our own script for timing purposes. For Neon3, we adopted the code from the Neon GitHub repository. Neon requires the kernel size of convolutional layers and mini-batch size to be multiples of 4 and 32, respectively when employed on GPU. Thus the second convolution layer for Neon implementation is chosen to have 52 filters instead of 50 filters used in the other frameworks.\nTable 3 shows the averaged processing time for gradient computation as well as the time for a forward step obtained by the four frameworks on both CPU and GPU using batch size of 64. For CPU timings, the number of threads used in each experiment is also reported. It should be noted that Neon cannot be configured to use multiple CPU threads and thus its performance on CPU is only reported with one thread. On the other hand, Caffe can be configured only during installation to run on a pre-determined number of threads (12 here) and thus it’s performance on CPU is only reported with 12 threads. Theano and Torch are flexible in selecting the number of threads and thus their performances on CPU are reported with multiple settings. We report results for six and twelve threads since our system has six physical cores which can also be used with twelve threads using Hyper-Threading. When GPU is used, the underlying convolution library (e.g. cuDNN) is mentioned along with the framework. Neon uses its own GPU/CPU backend as mentioned before. The processing times clearly show the advantage of GPU over CPU (at least 20×) for training deep convolutional networks. This advantage would be more significant when training more complex models with larger data as will be shown later in this section. Torch results in best performance when comparing CPU times while Neon results in the worst performance on CPU. It is seen in the GPU experiments that cuDNN is faster for this network compared to the conv-fft. In general, the performance gain of using the FFT-based approach is highly dependent on the size of the input and kernel sizes (Mathieu et al., 2013). Theano results in best performance for the gradient computation on GPU while Torch and Theano achieve the best GPU performance for deployment. It should be noted that MNIST is a relatively small dataset and fits on the CPU host memory or the GPU device memory. Therefore, when Theano, Torch, or Neon is employed on GPU, the data is entirely copied into the GPU memory once before the training starts to avoid possible delays caused by communications between GPU and host for copying mini-batches. This is done on Theano using shared variables, on Torch by calling the :cuda() function, and on Neon using the DataIterator class. Copying of the entire dataset into the memory can also be done for Caffe using MemoryData layer. Here we used the data layer of Caffe that supports efficient LMDB database since the MNIST data is readily available in LMDB format from Caffe repository. The communication overhead for Caffe is not significant. The combined averaged forward and backward computational time of the data layer of LeNet in Caffe is about 1/1220 (1/30) of the total computational time of the batch when using CPU (GPU). This includes the time to rescale the images of the batch to the unit range.\n3We directly call the fprop and get cost functions to time the forward pass. Similarly, the get errors and bprop functions are used to time the backward pass.\nFigure 1 shows the gradient computation time and forward step time of the four frameworks on GPU using different batch sizes. It is seen that Theano has the best gradient computation time for small batches while Neon has the best performance for large batches. Theano consistently has the minimum forward time, specially for the large batch sizes. It is seen that Torch and Caffe performances drop more rapidly as the batch size increases."

      "heading" : "4.2 ALEXNET",
      "text" : "In this section, we train the AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) on the ImageNet dataset. Note that there have been many recent, larger networks like GoogleNet, OxfordNet, etc. but we stick with AlexNet as it is the first network that significantly improved performance on ImageNet and is very popular. The network consists of five convolution layers, out of which three of them use grouping which restrict the connectivity of filters, and two have local response normalization (LRN) layers. The networks also has three pooling layers, two fully connected layers with ReLU activation units and dropout, and a softmax logistic loss. Each image is cropped to have dimension of 224. The data augmentation using random cropping or transformation is not performed. For Caffe, the network is available in the Caffe model repository and data is accessed using the LMDB database. For Neon, we adopted the code from the Neon GitHub repository where the data is accessed in a pipelined fashion through the ImgMaster class that reads the batch data into the memory. Neon currently does not support grouping and LRN layers. For Theano, the code of Ding et al. (2014) is adopted without performing data parallelization. This implementation uses Hickle to access data files in HDF5 formats. The Theano implementation does not use the standard convolution function of Theano (conv.conv2d) as it does not implement the type of padding used in AlexNet, usually known as “same” padding. Thus, it is not possible to perform the AlexNet Theano experiment on CPU or using conv-fft as they can be accessed through the conv2d function. The convolution on GPU on Theano is performed by calling either the dnn.dnn conv function from cuDNN library or the corresponding function from pylearn2 cuda-convent wrapper. The latter is referred as cuconv in the results. The cuda-convnet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) is a fast implementation of convolution but has some restrictions on input and kernel shapes, and has a different memory layout for the input than the Theano standard convolution operator. We updated the implementation in (Ding et al., 2014) to avoid unnecessary dimshuffle operations. For Torch, we utilize a multithreaded data loader provided in Chintala (2015b) that creates a pre-specified number of threads for parallel data loading from disk. In addition to cuDNN library, we report the timings of Torch on GPU using both the cunn and fbcunn libraries which contain different algorithms for the spatial convolution operations. Note that fbcunn uses a FFT-based implementation and currently does not support stride lengths greater than 1. So when reporting fbcunn results, we use the cuDNN-based convolution for the first layer of AlexNet and fbcunn-based convolutions for the rest. Furthermore, cunn and fbcunn do not support grouping. In addition to reporting the results for the exact AlexNet implementation, we also report\nthe results for all the libraries without the LRN layers and with grouping set to one to make the comparison transparent.\nTable 4 shows the performance of the four frameworks on the AlexNet using batch size of 256.To have a better performance comparison across the frameworks, the time required for data loading and processing (mean normalization) in each batch is excluded from time of forward and backward steps in all our experiments. In the CPU setting, Torch results in the best performance, similar to the LeNet results. The speed-up obtained by using GPU instead is more significant (at least 25×) here compared to the LeNet. When employed on GPU, Torch results in the best performance on the exact AlexNet implementation. When LRN layers are dropped and grouping are set to one, Torch using fbcunn results in the best gradient computation performance while Neon results in the best forward pass performance followed closely by Torch. Figure 2 shows the performance of the four frameworks on GPU using different batch sizes when no LRN layers are used here and grouping for all convolutional layers are set to one. Note that Neon and Torch have consistent superior performances for different batch sizes for the forward pass but Neon results in best performance for the gradient computation time. We also noticed from our experiments that the LMDB database used in Caffe has significantly better performance than the other data access layers used in other frameworks as it supports concurrent reads. Caffe also uses pre-fetching to eliminates IO latency. This can be an area of future developments for Neon, Theano, and Torch to make the LMDB database (or other efficient databases) and pre-fetching available in their frameworks. Pre-fetching and multi-thread processing can also be implemented in Torch as has been done for the Imagenet example in Chintala (2015b)."

      "heading" : "4.3 STACKED AUTOENCODERS",
      "text" : "To benchmark a scenario with layer-wise pre-training procedure,we choose stacked autoencoders. This also provides a better picture of the performances of different frameworks when only fullyconnected layers are used. We train three autoencoders (AEs) where each AE has a encoder and a corresponding decoder layer with tied weights, i.e. the decoder weights are transpose of the encoder weights.The sigmoid activation functions are used. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset in two steps: layer-wise unsupervised training and supervised fine-tuning. The unsupervised layerwise training step is performed similar to the procedure in Bengio et al. (2007) using mean squared loss function. The AE1 is first trained on the raw images and then its weights are fixed. The AE2 is then trained on the resulting outputs of the first encoder and this procedure is repeated until all AEs are trained. Note that once an AE is trained, its encoder outputs are not computed and recorded for the entire dataset in the memory to be used for the following AE4, rather each batch is separately\n4Saving the outputs of trained encoder for the entire input would improve computational time but is not a memory-efficient procedure, specially for large datasets, and therefore is not employed here.\nprocessed. Thus the forward pass for AE2, for example, includes a pass from raw image data to the first encoder and AE2 before loss is computed. In the supervised fine-tuning step, the training is performed on the stacked encoders (SE) of each AE with a softmax layer of size 10 and a cross entropy loss function. The decoders are not present in this fine-tuning step.\nThe above pre-training and fine-tuning steps are implemented in Theano LISA Lab (2014) and Torch. For Caffe, pre-training step is implemented using a few tricks. We have four configuration files in which three of them handle training of the individual AEs and one handles the fine-tuning step on the SE. We set the learning rates of the layers that should not be updated during pre-training step to zero. For example, when training the second AE, the learning rate for the weights of first encoder are set to zero. It should be noted that the Caffe detects the zero learning rates and does not perform unnecessary calculations. One can use PyCaffe and a procedure referred in Caffe documentation as net surgery to transfer the learned weights of each trained AE to the following AE. This is not performed here as we are only interested in the computational performance. It should be noted that Caffe does not yet support tied weights and thus, different from our Theano and Torch implementations, we use independent parameters for the encoder and decoder of each AE in Caffe. Our Neon implementation is very similar to Caffe implementation. Multiple optimizers are used to set the learning rates of the layers that should not get updated to zero. Similarly, independent encoder and decoder weights are used for each AE as Neon does not support tied weights. The performance of the four frameworks are shown in Table 5 where the encoders of the three AE layers have 400, 200 and 100 hidden layers, respectively. It is seen that Torch and Theano results in superior performance and Neon results in the worst performance for both CPU and GPU settings. We have also evaluated the frameworks in a different setting, where the number of hidden layers of encoders of AE1, AE2 and AE3 are 800, 1000 and 2000, respectively. For this larger network, Caffe results in better performance compared to Theano on GPU but Torch again achieves the best performance. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 7 in the Appendix."

      "heading" : "4.4 LSTM",
      "text" : "In this section, we train a LSTM network (Graves et al., 2012) for the task of sentiment analysis on IMDB dataset. In this task, each sentence is considered as a (varying-length) sequence of words. The network architecture is the same as the one used in LISA Lab (2014). It consists of an embedding layer followed by an LSTM layer. The outputs of the LSTM layer are then averaged and fed to a linear fully connected layer with softmax logistic regression for binary classification. The sequences within each batch are padded to have the same size as the largest sequence within the batch and a masking array is used to make sure the recursive computations of the LSTM layer remain valid. For Torch, there are no libraries which support masking operations which are necessary to process\nvarying length input sequences. So, we use the LSTM layer from the “rnn” package Leonard (2015) and provide each of the input sequences within a batch separately.5 Caffe does not yet officially support cyclic architectures, and in particular LSTM, and thus its performance is not reported here6. While Neon has LSTM layers and has the option to pad data to fixed sizes, the LSTM layer does not accept variable length inputs within a batch and thus is not used here. It should be noted that one of the main advantages of the recurrent networks are their capabilities in handling variable length inputs without the need to make the window size constant (Graves et al., 2012).\nWe used 124 iterations, one entire epoch, to average the computational time for different padding sizes. Also shuffling is not performed on the training set to make sure different frameworks receive the same sequence of batches and thus have the same number of flops. As the dataset is small, it is initially loaded into the device or host memory. Table 6 shows the performance of Theano and Torch for the LSTM network.As with previous cases, Torch performs best for CPU but with a GPU, Theano results in better performance; this could partly be due to non-masked implementation of Torch which forces it to work with each input sequence separately rather than a batch."

Such mathematical expressions can be rapidly coded in Theano using a high-level description language similar to a functional language that can be compiled and executed on either a CPU or a GPU.\nTheano uses CUDA library to define arrays located on an Nvidia GPU memory with Python bindings. Theano includes many custolllrrm C and CUDA code generators tailored for different types, sizes, and shapes of inputs which optimizes the computation of the complicated tensor computations. Theano benefits from a large user community that contribute to its development partly due to the ease of development offered by Python language and its scientific computing stack. Examples of the deep learning algorithms implemented using Theano can be found at LISA Lab (2014). In the latest version of the Theano used here (Theano 0.7), the convolution operation automatically uses the optimized Nvidia cuDNN library, if installed, to perform the convolution. It also provides two additional implementations for the convolution operation, an FFT-based implementation (Mathieu et al., 2013) and an implementation based on the open-source code of Alex Krizhevsky (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).While Theano is a general mathematical expression library and may have a relatively steep learning curve for writing efficient code and debugging, several libraries (e.g. Pylearn2, Keras, and Lasagne) have been developed on top it which are specifically tailored for deep learning algorithm providing building blocks for fast experimentation of the well-known methods."
