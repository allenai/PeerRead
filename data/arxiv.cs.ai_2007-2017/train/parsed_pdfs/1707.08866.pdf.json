      "text" : "Relation extraction is the task of predicting attributes and relations for entities in a sentence (Zelenko et al., 2003; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; GuoDong et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2017). For example, given a sentence “Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.”, a relation classifier aims at predicting the relation of “bornInCity”. Relation extraction is the key component for building relation knowledge graphs, and it is of crucial significance to natural language processing applications such as structured search, sentiment analysis, question answering, and summarization.\nA major issue for relation extraction is the lack of labeled training data. In recent years, distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al.,\n2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012) emerges as the most popular method for relation extraction— it uses knowledge base facts to select a set of noisy instances from unlabeled data. Among all the machine learning approaches for distant supervision, the recently proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) model (Zeng et al., 2014) achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Following their success, Zeng et al. (2015) proposed a piece-wise max-pooling strategy to improve the CNNs. Various attention strategies (Lin et al., 2016; Shen and Huang, 2016) for CNNs are also proposed, obtaining impressive results. However, most of these neural relation extraction models are relatively shallow CNNs—typically only one convolutional layer and one fully connected layer were involved, and it was not clear whether deeper models could have benefits on distilling signals from noisy inputs in this task.\nIn this paper, we investigate the effects of training deeper CNNs for distantly-supervised relation extraction. More specifically, we designed a convolutional neural network based on residual learning (He et al., 2016)—we show how one can incorporate word embeddings and position embeddings into a deep residual network, while feeding identity feedback to convolutional layers for this noisy relation prediction task. Empirically, we evaluate on the NYT-Freebase dataset (Riedel et al., 2010), and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance using deep CNNs with identify mapping and shortcuts. In contrast to popular beliefs in vision that deep residual network only works for very deep CNNs, we show that even with a moderately deep CNNs, there are substantial improvements over vanilla CNNs for relation extraction. Our contributions are three-fold:\n• We are the first to consider deeper convolutional neural networks for weakly-supervised\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n08 86\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n7 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nrelation extraction using residual learning;\n• We show that our deep residual network model outperforms CNNs by a large margin empirically, obtaining state-of-the-art performances;\n• Our identity mapping with shortcut feedback approach can be easily applicable to any variants of CNNs for relation extraction."

Following (Zeng et al., 2014), a PF is the combination of the relative distances of the current word to the first entity e1 and the second entity e2. For instance, in the sentence ”Steve Jobs is the founder of Apple.”, the relative distances from founder to e1 (Steve Job) and e2 are 3 and -2, respectively. We then transform the relative distances into real valued vectors by looking up one randomly initialized position embedding matrices Vp ∈ Rdp×‖P‖ where P is fixed-sized distance set. It should be noted that if a word is too far from entities, it may be not related to the relation. Therefore, we choose maximum value emax and minimum value emin for the relative distance.\nIn the example shown in Figure 1, it is assumed that dw is 4 and dp is 1. There are two position embeddings: one for e1, the other for e2. Finally, we concatenate the word embeddings and position\nembeddings of all words and denote a sentence of length n (padded where necessary) as a vector\nv = v1 ⊕ v2 ⊕ ...⊕ vn where⊕ is the concatenation operator and vi ∈ Rd (d = dw + dp × 2)."

We fine tune our model using validation on the training data. The word embedding is of size 50. The input text is padded to a fixed size of 100. Training is performed with tensorflow adam optimizer, using a mini-batch of size 64, an initial learning rate of 0.001. We initialize our convolutional layers following (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). The implementation is done using Tensorflow 0.11. All experiments are performed on a single NVidia Titan X (Pascal) GPU. In Table 1 we show all parameters used in the experiments. We experiment with several state-of-the-art baselines and variants of our model.\n• CNN-B: Our implementation of the CNN baseline (Zeng et al., 2014) which contains one convolutional layer, and one fully connected layer.\n• CNN+ATT: CNN-B with attention over instance learning (Lin et al., 2016).\n• PCNN+ATT: Piecewise CNN-B with attention over instance learning (Lin et al., 2016).\n• CNN: Our CNN model which includes one convolutional layer and three fully connected layers.\n• CNN-x: Deeper CNN model which has x convolutional layers. For example, CNN-9 is a model constructed with 9 convolutional layers (1 + 4 residual cnn block without identity shortcut) and three fully connected layers.\n• ResCNN-x: Our proposed CNN-x model with residual identity shortcuts.\nWe evaluate our models on the widely used NYT freebase larger dataset (Riedel et al., 2010). Note that ImageNet dataset used by the original ResNet paper (He et al., 2016) has 1.28 million training instances. NYT freebase dataset includes 522K training sentences, which is the largest dataset in relation extraction, and it is the only suitable dataset to train deeper CNNs."

      "heading" : "3.2 NYT-Freebase Dataset Performance",
      "text" : "The advantage of this dataset is that there are 522,611 sentences in training data and 172,448 sentences in testing data and this size can support\nus to train a deep network. Similar to previous work (Zeng et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2016), we evaluate our model using the held-out evaluation. We report both the aggregate curves precision/recall curves and Precision@N (P@N).\nIn Figure 2, we compare the proposed ResCNN model with various CNNs. First, CNNs with multiple fully-connected layers obtained very good results, which is a novel finding. Second, the results also suggest that deeper CNNs with residual learning help extracting signals from noisy distant supervision data. We observe that overfitting happened when we try to add more layers and the performance of CNN-9 is much worse than CNN. We find that ResNet can solve this problem and ResCNN-9 obtains better performance as compared to CNN-B and CNN and dominates the precision/recall curve overall.\nWe show the effect of depth in residual networks in Figure 3. We observe that ResCNN-5 is worse than CNN-5 because the ResNet does not work well for shallow CNNs, and this is consis-\ntent with the original ResNet paper. As we increase the network depth, we see that CNN-9 does overfit to the training data. With residual learning, both ResCNN-9 and ResCNN-13 provide significant improvements over CNN-5 and ResCNN-5 models. In contradictory to popular beliefs that ResNet only works well for very deep networks, we found that even with 9 layers of CNNs, using identity mapping could significantly improve the performance learning in a noisy input setting.\nThe intuition of ResNet help this task in two aspect. First, if the lower, middle, and higher levels learn hidden lexical, syntactic, and semantic representations respectively, sometimes it helps to bypass the syntax to connect lexical and semantic space directly. Second, ResNet tackles the vanishing gradient problem which will decrease the effect of noise in distant supervision data.\nIn Table 2, we compare the performance of our models to state-of-the-art baselines. We show that our ResCNN-9 outperforms all models that do not select training instances. And even without piecewise max-pooling and instance-based attention, our model is on par with the PCNN+ATT model.\nFor the more practical evaluation, we compare the results for precision@N where N is small (1, 5, 10, 20, 50) in Table 3. We observe that our ResCNN-9 model dominates the performance when we predict the relation in the range of higher probability. ResNet helps CNNs to focus on the highly possible candidate and mitigate the noise effect of distant supervision. We believe that residual connections actually can be seen as a form of renormalizing the gradients, which prevents the model from overfitting to the noisy distant supervision data.\nIn our distant-supervised relation extraction experience, we have two important observations: (1) We get significant improvements with CNNs adding multiple fully-connected layers. (2) Resid-\nual learning could significantly improve the performance for deeper CNNs."

ResNet has won the ImageNet ILSVRC 2015 classification task, and achieved state-of-theart performances in many computer vision tasks. However, the effect of residual learning on noisy natural language processing tasks is still not well understood. In this paper, we design a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual learning, and investigate its impacts on the task of distantly supervised noisy relation extraction. In contradictory to popular beliefs that ResNet only works well for very deep networks, we found that even with 9 layers of CNNs, using identity mapping could significantly improve the performance for distantly-supervised relation extraction.",
