      "text" : "In recent years, recommender systems are widely used in most web applications to improve user experience. Although numerous recommendation algorithms have been proposed, there are still some well-known issues remaining open, such as data sparsity and cold start. Towards these problems, a lot of researchers propose to leverage additional information to help modeling users and items, such as contents [1, 2], tags [3, 4], social information [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] or multiple feedback of users [12, 13, 14].\nPreprint submitted to Information Sciences May 9, 2017\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n01 76\n0v 2\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 8\nM ay\nWith the development of social media, trust-aware recommendation algorithms attracts more and more attentions recently. Based on the phenomenon that users’ tastes are often influenced by their friends [15, 16], there are numerous works been proposed to integrate trust information into recommender system [10, 8, 6, 5]. Their results demonstrate that the trust relationships are effective to help modeling user preference and improving recommendation performance.\nAlthough existing works propose different ways to incorporate trust information into recommendation, there are still two critical issues with these trust-aware algorithms. First, most of them model the trust relationships with shallow model and ignore the high-order interactions among each users’ friends; it is possible for a user to take all the opinions of his friends into account and then come out his own thinking rather than linearly combine all of them. Second, the trust relationships are also facing the sparse problem as well as ratings. This may limits the improvement of trust-aware algorithms and make it difficult to utilize deep model to learn high-order information from trust data.\nBased on these motivations, we propose a novel deep model TDAE to tackle top-N recommendation task. In this model, we attempt to model user preferences in two perspectives: representations based on rating and trust data. Inspired of the idea of Auto-Encoder that reconstruct input data through a narrow neutral network, we build the TDAE model with a narrow shared layer which fuse userspecific preferences and user representations from rating and trust data. Moreover, to prevent from overfitting, we also consider the correlations between user-specific preference and these representations, and then improve the performance of recommendation.\nIn summary, the contributions in this paper is demonstrated as following:\n• In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model to learn user preferences from rating and trust data. Toward the big challenge of data sparse for this problem, the TDAE model is built by fusing two denoising autoencoders with a weighted layer, which is used to balance the importance of rating and trust data. This model can also easily be extended for other recommendation tasks with additional information.\n• To keep away from overfitting, we further propose a correlative regularization to constraint the learning process. Since we model user preferences in two perspectives, we argue that they can be used to predict each other to a certain degree. This motivate us to propose the Correlative regularization to build relations between the layers in same level. This regularization can efficient improve the effectiveness and robust of TDAE model.\n• We conduct comprehensive experiments with two datasets to compare our approach with state-of-the-art algorithms on Top-N recommendation task. There are several works show clearly that Top-N recommendation is more close to real application scenarios than rating prediction. So we adopt ranking-sensitive metrics to evaluate the TDAE model, i.e., MAP and NDCG. The results demonstrate that our model significant outperform other comparisons, and is further improved by incorporating correlative regularization."

Specially, Jamali and Ester propose the SocialMF model by leveraging trust propagation mechanism to model user preference and integrating with matrix factorization for recommendation [5]. Ma et al. then propose a SoReg method by exactly modeling the influence and propagation mechanism between users [6]. Based on the observation that a user demonstrate different preference with roles of truster and trustee, Yang et al. proposed the TrustMF algorithm to further improve performance [8]. To handle the sparse problem of ratings and trust relationships, the TrustSVD model is proposed by taking both explicit and implicit feedback of user trust and ratings into account for rating prediction [10].\nHowever, all these methods utilize trust data in shallow level and ignore the factor that trust relationships are very complex. To learn high-order information from these data, a big challenge is that trust relationships are very sparse and not sufficient to support deep model. Towards this problem, we propose a deep model to learn high-order representations by taking both feedback of ratings and trust relationships into account. First, we propose a TDAE by connecting two AutoEncoders and user-specific preference with a weighted hidden layer to fuse these user preferences in two perspectives.

      "text" : "In recent years, with the rapidly development of deep learning techniques in computer vision and neutral language processing domains, it raise a question that how to utilize deep learning techniques for recommender systems? This problem attracts more and more attentions recently and has become a hot topic in the field of recommender systems.\nThere are numerous works have been proposed to tackle this problem, and they can roughly be categorized into two classes: rating-based methods and auxiliary data based methods. Rating-based methods focus on utilizing deep learning model for recommendation solely based on ratings [17, 18, 19]. These methods leverage the denoising autoencoder (DAE) to learn compact representations of users or items from sparse rating data for recommendation. Their results demonstrate great improvement compare with previous linear models, such as matrix factorization. Auxiliary data based methods propose to learn compact representations from auxiliary data such as content, tag or images, and then combined with traditional matrix factorization method for recommendation [20, 21, 3, 22]. By leveraging these data with deep model, these methods can further push the performance of recommendation to a higher level.\nHowever, all these above existing works focus on utilizing neural networks to learn representations from only one kind of information, such as ratings [17], contents [21], tags [3], or images [22]. In practice, there are numerous works been proposed to learn multiple features from different views [23, 24, 25, 26]. This motivate us to raise a question: how to utilize Auto-Encoder model to learn representations from two kinds of information for recommendation?\nIn this paper, we propose to utilize deep learning model to learn user preferences from both rating and trust data simultaneously. Compared with those aforementioned methods, the TDAE model are consist of two Auto-Encoders to model two kinds of data. They are tied together with a weighted hidden layer, which fuses user preferences of two perspectives. Moreover, inspired of the idea of multimodal deep learning [23], we further propose a novel correlative regularization to build relation between these user preferences for improving performance."

However, in most scenarios, the goal of recommender systems are to predict a item list for each user to satisfy his/her taste. Therefore, a number of works have been\nproposed to tackle the top-N recommendation problem, which is more suitable for real application [28, 29, 30, 11, 19].\nFor example, in [28], a ranking-oriented approach has been proposed to measure confidence for each user-item pair and improve the matrix factorization method for top-N recommendation. Specially, a Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) [29] algorithm is proposed to direct learn the ranking relation based on implicit feedback for top-N recommendation. More recently, the Collaborative Denoising Auto-Encoders (CDAE) [19] is proposed to utilize the technique of Denoising Auto-Encoders (DAE) to further improve performance. In this paper, the authors propose to predict item list for each user based on user-specific vector and implicit feedback of users. Compared with precious works, this method demonstrates significantly improvement.\nIn this paper, inspired of the CDAE model, we propose an novel Auto-Encoder structure to learn user preferences based on rating and trust data. Compared with CDAE, we focus on the combination of these two kinds of information.

However, most existed works focus on utilizing Auto-Encoder model for only one kind of information, such as ratings, contents or tags. This motivate us to propose the TDAE model, which utilizes Denoising Auto-Encoder model to learn exactly user preferences from both of rating and trust data.\nThe graphical model of TDAE is demonstrated in figure 1. We can see that this network is started with a encoder layer, followed by a weighted layer and then ended with a decoder layer. Essentially, we tackle the problem that how to learn representations from two kind of sparse information through a weighted layer to balance contributions and a correlative regularization to exchange information.\nIn our approach, we utilize the idea of DAE model described in section 3.2 to build TDAE model. The basic idea of DAE is to reconstruct data from their corrupted version through a narrow network. The most commonly choices are Gaussian noise and drop-out noise. We employ the drop-out noise in our model, which is also used in [19] for top-N recommendation. For each entry x of inputs R and T , the corresponding corrupted version x̃ is defined by:\nP (x̃ = 0) = q\nP (x̃ = δx) = 1− q (2)\nWhere q is the probability that randomly drop out a unit; δ is used to bias the corruptions, which set the clean inputs to δ = 1/(1 − q) times their original values.\nAs shown in figure 1, we first map the rating and trust inputs into low-dimensional space with a encoder layer, which is given by:\nZRu = f(W T R̃u + b) ZTu = f(V T T̃u + c)\n(3)\nWhere R̃u and T̃u denote the corrupted version of rating and trust data; ZRu and ZTu represent the latent user preferences of u that learn from rating and trust data, respectively; R̃u and T̃u denote the corrugated rating and trust data for user u; Parameters W ∈ Rm×k, V ∈ Rn×k, b ∈ Rm×1, c ∈ Rn×1 with dimension of k are training to learn user preferences; f(·) is a element-wise mapping function (e.g., identity function f(x) = x or sigmoid function f(x) = 1/(1 + e−x)), which we adopt sigmoid function in this paper.\nThen we propose a weighted layer to integrate these two kinds of representations. A straightforward approach is to direct concatenate representations from rating and trust data for each user. However, the correlations between ratings and trust data are highly non-linear with different distribution [23]. It means that the information with higher variance may have stronger impact on the outputs, even if the other one may contains important information.\nTo balance the influences of these two kinds of data in TDAE, we develop a weighted hidden layer to fuse these representations. By this way, we can easily tune the contributions of these information for modeling user preference.\nPu = αZ R u + (1− α)ZTu (4)\nWhere Pu denotes the integrated user preference of user u; α is a hype-parameter\nto balance the influences of ZRu and Z T u .\nAt last, the TDAE network is followed by two decoder layers to reconstruct original inputs from corrupted data. These two layers are formulated by:\nR̂u = g(W ′TPu + b ′)\nT̂u = g(V ′TPu + c ′) (5)\nWhere R̂u and T̂u are the prediction value of rating and trust for each user; Parameters W ′ ∈ Rm×k, V ′ ∈ Rn×k, b′ ∈ Rm×1, c′ ∈ Rn×1 are training to reconstruct inputs; g(·) is also a element-wise mapping function, and we utilize sigmoid function in this paper.\nTo learn compact representations, we take both reconstruction errors of ratings and trust relationships into account, where existed works mostly ignore the trust relationship. Then we have the objective function of TDAE to minimize as following:\nLT = l(R, R̂) + l(T, T̂ ) + λT 2 Ω(W,W ′, V, V ′, b, b′, c, c′) (6)\nWhere l(·) denotes the loss function to compute reconstruction errors; Ω(·) is a regularization term that make use of l2 norm and defined by:\nΩ(·) =||W ||2F + ||W ′||2F + ||V ||2F + ||V ′||2F +||b||2F + ||b′||2F + ||c||2F + ||c′||2F\n(7)\nWhere λT is a hype-parameter to control the model complexity. Specially, we utilize a element-wise cross entropy loss for l(·) in this paper, which demonstrated to be most suitable for top-N recommendation situation in [19]. Since g(·) is a sigmoid function, the cross entropy loss is equal to the logistic loss which is defined by:\nl(y, ŷ) = −ylog(ŷ)− (1− y)log(1− ŷ) (8)"

To improve the recommendation accuracy against sparse problem, we propose a novel correlative regularization term to build relations between the two kinds of information in TDAE.\nIntuitively, since representations ZRu and Z T u represent user preferences for user u in different perspectives, there should exist implicit relation between these two representations. This motivate us to propose a novel regularization term to bridge a relationship between them to exchange information and thus enhance the robust for sparse problem.\nInspired by the idea of Auto-Encoder that reconstruct data from itself through a neural network, we argue that the correlative representations can be predicted by each other through a reconstruction function. Based on this idea, we propose a novel Correlative regularization term to build the relation between the rating and trust data, which is given by:\nLC = ||ZRu − θ0ZTu ||2F + ||ZTu − θ1ZRu ||2F (9)\nWhere parameters {θ1, θ2} denote the parameters to reconstruct data from its corresponding layer, where we use a linear map function here. Note that any other neutral networks can also be used to build the relations.\nFinally, we have the improved version of TDAE, which taking explicit corrections between hidden layers in TDAE into account to enhance robust.

We then drop those users and items with less than 5 ratings [29].\nWe conduct a 5-fold cross-validation for training and testing.

TDAE learns high-order correlations from rating and trust data through two stacked denoising autoencoders which is united by a shared layer. Moreover, a robust Correlative regularization is proposed to build the relationship between hidden layers in TDAE. The results of several experiments demonstrate that TDAE significantly outperforms stateof-the-art algorithms. We also compare the performance of TDAE and TDAE+ model to evaluate the effectiveness of correlative regularization and demonstrate\nthat it can not only improve the performance but also increase stability of TDAE. The TDAE is a flexible model and easily extended to learn compact representations from other kinds of information.\nFor future works, we intended to further develop the TDAE model for at least three directions but not limited. Firstly, since the rating and trust data are both very sparse, we intend to introduce information of items (such as images or videos) to improve recommendation performance and make use of the recent proposed methods [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. Secondly, different from that in computer vision field, the data used in recommender systems are very spare and not suitable for most existing deep learning framework (e.g., Caffe, Theano, Torch or TensorFlow). This attract us to utilize multi-core CPU / many-core GPU power [43, 44, 45] for sparse inputs in the future works. Thirdly, the TDAE is a flexible model and can easily be extended to learn representations from other kinds of information. We intend to extend the proposed method for some other applications, such as CAD/CAM [46, 47, 48, 49, 50], social computing [51, 52, 53] and intelligent computing [54, 55, 56]"

    "abstractText" : "Both feedback of ratings and trust relationships can be used to reveal users’ tastes for improving recommendation performance, especially for cold users. However, both of them are facing data sparsity problem, which may severely degrade recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose to utilize the idea of Denoising Auto-Encoders (DAE) to tackle this problem. Specially, we propose a novel deep learning model, the Trust-aware Collaborative Denoising AutoEncoder (TDAE), to learn compact and effective representations from both rating and trust data for top-N recommendation. In particular, we present a novel neutral network with a weighted hidden layer to balance the importance of these representations. Moreover, we propose a novel correlative regularization to bridge relations between user preferences in different perspectives. We also conduct comprehensive experiments on two public datasets to compare with several state-of-theart approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms other comparisons for top-N recommendation task.",
