Current approaches generally focus on relatively shallow semantics and do not account for numeric quantities. Our approach uses language models grounded in numbers within the text. Such groundings are easily achieved for recurrent neural language model architectures, which can be further conditioned on incomplete background knowledge bases. Our evaluation on clinical reports shows that numerical grounding improves perplexity by 33% and F1 for semantic error correction by 5 points when compared to ungrounded approaches. Conditioning on a knowledge base yields further improvements.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Aug 2016 22:34:22 GMT  (256kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04147v1", "accepted to EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted to EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["georgios p spithourakis", "isabelle augenstein", "sebastian riedel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.04147"}
