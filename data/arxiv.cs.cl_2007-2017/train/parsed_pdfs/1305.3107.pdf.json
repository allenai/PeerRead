      "text" : "In recent years, research on Twitter has attracted a lot of interest, primarily due to its open API that enables easy collection of data. The belief that tweets contain useful information has lead to them being used to predict many real-world quantities. For example, tweets have been used to predict elections (Tumasjan et al., 2010; O’Connor et al., 2010), stock market movement (Bollen et al., 2011), and even flu outbreaks (Ritterman et al., 2009). Twitter forbids distribution of raw tweets and their terms of service insist that any tweet collection must honor post-hoc deletion requests. That is, at any point in the future a user can issue a request to Twitter to delete a tweet. Predicting when a tweet is likely to be retracted by a user has important applications:\n• Security. Twitter has become so ubiquitous that users often do not consider the potential confidentiality implications before they tweet.\n• Regret. Users might post an inappropriate or offensive tweet in the heat of the moment, only to regret it later.\n• Public scrutiny. High profile politicians at times tweet content that they later withdraw.\nHere we report on the first results of automatically predicting if tweets will be deleted in the future. We also analyse why tweets are deleted."

      "text" : "Predicting deleted messages has been previously addressed in the context of\nemails (Dabbish et al., 2003; Dabbish et al., 2005). For example, (Dabbish et al., 2003) found that the most important factors affecting the chances of an email being deleted are the past communication between the two parties and the number of recipients of the email. However, it should be clear that people use tweets in very different ways to using email. The most similar work to ours is the recent analysis of censorship in Chinese social media (Bamman et al., 2012). The problem examined there is that of the government deleting posts in the Chinese social media site Sina Weibo (Chinese equivalent of Twitter). The authors analyze different terms that are indicative of a tweet being deleted and the difference between appearance of certain political terms on Twitter and on Sina Weibo. However, they make no attempt to predict what will be deleted and only briefly touch upon deleted messages in Twitter. While the main reason for deletion in Sina Weibo seems to be government censorship,1 there is no known censorship on Twitter, and thus the reasons for deletion will be quite different. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first analysis of deleted messages on Twitter."

      "heading" : "3 Task Description",
      "text" : "There are several ways in which a tweet can be deleted. The most obvious way is when its author explicitly deletes it (this is usually done by clicking on a Delete button available in most Twitter clients). Another way that a tweet becomes effectively deleted is when a user decides to make his tweets protected. Although the user’s tweets are still available to read for his friends, no one else has access to them any more (unless the user decides to make them public again). Finally, the user’s whole account might be deleted (either by their own choice or by Twitter), meaning that all of his tweets are also deleted. In the public streaming API, Twitter does not differentiate between these different scenarios, so we collapse them all into a single task: for each tweet predict if it will be deleted, by either of the aforementioned ways.\n1These results were also confirmed in (Tschang, 2012)."

      "text" : "Table 1 shows some examples of the various types of deleted tweets that we have discussed (identifiable information has been replaced by ***). Although we can never be sure of the true reason behind someone deleting a tweet, a lot of the time the reason is fairly obvious. For example, it is very likely that tweet 1 was deleted because the author regretted posting it due to its somewhat inappropriate content. On the other hand, tweet 2 was most likely posted by a spammer and got deleted when the author’s account was deleted. Tweet 3 is probably an example of deleting a tweet out of privacy concerns – the author posted his email publicly which makes him an easy target for spammers. The fourth tweet is an example of a deleted tweet authored by a Canadian politician (obtained from the website politwitter.ca/page/deleted). Finally, tweet 5 is an example of a false rumour on Twitter. This tweet was retweeted many times right after it was posted, but once it became clear that the news was not true, many users deleted their retweets."

This data consists of 75 million tweets, split into a training set of 68 million tweets and a test set of about 7.5 million more recent tweets (corresponding roughly to tweets written during the last three days of January 2012). A tweet is given the label 1, meaning it was deleted, if the notice about its deletion appeared in the streaming API at any time up to 29th February 2012. Otherwise we consider that the tweet was not deleted. In total, 2.4 million tweets in our dataset were deleted before the end of February."

Additionally, we include the number of hashtags, mentions, and links in the tweet under social features, even though they are not strictly “social”. We do this because these features are dense, and thus much more similar to other dense features (the “real” social features) than to sparse features like the author and text features.\n• Author features: user IDs,\n• Text features: all the words in the tweet.\nBecause of the user IDs and lexical features, the feature set we use is fairly large. In total, we have over 47 million features, where 18 million features are user IDs, and the rest are lexical features (social features account for only about a dozen of features). We do not use features like user’s time zone or the hour when the tweet was written. This is because our preliminary experiments showed that these features did not have any effect on prediction performance, most likely because the author and text features that we use already account for these features (e.g., authors in different time zones will use different words, or tweets written late at night will contain different words from those written in the morning)."

      "heading" : "4.3 Learning Algorithm",
      "text" : "In all our experiments we use a support vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) implemented in Liblinear (Fan et al., 2008). We note that while SVMs are generally found to be very effective for a wide range of problems, they are not well suited to largescale streaming problems. A potential limitation is the fact that they require batch training, which can be prohibitive both in terms of space and time when dealing with large datasets. Because of this, we also explored the use of the passive-aggressive (PA) algorithm (Crammer et al., 2006), which is an efficient, online, max-margin method for training a linear classifier. Thus, we also present results for PA as an alternative for cases where the data is simply too big for an SVM to be trained."

      "heading" : "4.4 Results",
      "text" : "We formulate predicting deletions as a binary classification task – each tweet is assigned a label 0 (will not be deleted) or 1 (will be deleted). Because the two classes are not equally important, i.e., we are normally more interested in correctly predicting when something will be deleted than correctly predicting when something will not be deleted, we use the F1 score to measure performance. F1 score is standard, e.g., in information retrieval, where one class (relevant documents) is more important than the other.\nResults are shown in Table 2. The random baseline randomly assigns one of the two labels to every tweet, while the majority baseline always assigns label 1 (will be deleted) to every tweet. We can see from the absolute numbers that this is a hard task, with the best F1 score of only 27.0. This is not very surprising given that there are many different reasons why a tweet might be deleted. Additionally, we should keep in mind that we work on all of the crawled data, which contains tweets in nearly all major languages, making the problem even harder (we are trying to predict whether a tweet written in any language will be deleted). Still, we can see that the machine learning approach beats the baselines by a very large margin (this difference is statistically significant at p = 0.01). Further improving perfor-\nmance in this task will be the focus of future work and this should enable researchers to distribute more stable Twitter datasets.\nWe mentioned before that using an SVM might be prohibitive when dealing with very large datasets. We therefore compared it to the PA algorithm and found that PA achieves an F1 score of 22.8, which is 4.2 points lower than the SVM (this difference is significant at p = 0.01) However, the SVM’s gain in performance might be offset by its additional computational cost – PA took 3 minutes to converge, compared to SVM’s 8 hours, and its memory footprint was two orders of magnitude smaller. Because efficiency is not our primary concern here, in the rest of the paper we will only present results obtained using SVM, but we note that the results for PA showed very similar patterns.\nTo get more insight into the task, we look at how different feature types affect performance. We can see from the last three rows of Table 2 that social features alone achieve very poor performance. This is in contrast to other tasks on Twitter, where social features are usually found to be very helpful (e.g., (Petrović et al., 2011) report F1 score of 39.6 for retweet prediction using only social features). Lexical features alone achieved reasonable performance, and the best performance was achieved using user ID features. This suggests that some users delete their tweets very frequently and some users almost never delete their tweets, and knowing this alone is very helpful. Overall, it is clear that there is benefit in using all three types of features, as the final performance is much higher than performance using any single feature group.\nWe performed ablation experiments where we re-\nmoved social features from the full set of features one at a time and measured the change in performance. We found that the only two features that had an impact greater than 0.1 in F1 were the number of tweets that the user has posted so far (removing this feature decreasedF1 by 0.2), and is the tweet a retweet (removing this feature decreased F1 by 0.16). This is interesting because the number of statuses is usually not found to be helpful for other prediction tasks on Twitter, while the followers number is usually a very strong feature, and removing it here only decreased F1 by 0.07.\nThe number of followers a user has is often considered one of the measures of her popularity. While it is certainly not the only one or the “best” one (Cha et al., 2010), it is still fairly indicative of the user’s popularity/influence and much easier to collect than other ones (e.g., number of mentions). In the next experiment, we are interested in seeing how well our system predicts what popular users (those with at least a certain number of followers) will delete. In addition, we look at how well our system works for verified users (celebrities). Arguably, predicting whether a celebrity or a user with 10,000 followers will delete a tweet is a much more interesting task than predicting if a user with 3 followers will do so. To do this, we run experiments where we only train and test on those users with the number of followers in a certain range, or only on those users that are verified. We can see from Table 3 that the situation between groups is very different. While for users with less than 1,000 followers the performance goes down, our system does much better on users that have lots of followers (it is also interesting to note that the baseline is much higher for users with more followers, which means that they are more likely to delete tweets in the first place). In fact, for users with more than 10,000 followers our system achieves very good performance that it could actually be applied in a real scenario. For celebrities, results are somewhat lower, but still much higher than for the whole training set."

      "text" : "One of the fundamental questions concerning deleted tweets is why are they deleted in the first place.

The third column shows our results for named groups. The last column shows the number of users in the test set that fall into each category.\ncome from active Twitter users who change their mind about posting a tweet (for one reason or another)? Or are tweets deleted by Twitter because they are sent by spammers? Here we try to answer these questions by looking at profiles of users who deleted tweets.\nWe take the 200000 deleted tweets from the test set and query Twitter’s API to retrieve the account status of their author. There are three possible outcomes: the account still exists, the account exists but it is protected, or the account does not exist any more. Deleted tweets from the first type of user are tweets that users manually delete and are probably the most interesting case here. Deleted tweets from users who have made their accounts protected are probably not really deleted, but are only available to read for a very small group of users. The third case involves users who have had their entire accounts deleted and thus none of their tweets are available any more. While it is possible for a user to delete his account himself, it is much more likely that these users are spammers and have had their accounts deleted by Twitter. Statistics about these three types of deletions are shown in Table 4. Most of the deleted tweets are genuine deletions rather than a consequence of deleting spammers, showing that there is much more to predicting deletions than simply predicting spam tweets.\nGiven this classification of deletions, we are interested in finding out how our approach performs across these different groups. Is it the case that some deletions are easier to predict than others? In order to answer this question, we test the performance of our system on the deleted tweets from these three groups. Because each of the three test sets now contains only positive examples, we measure performance in terms of accuracy instead of F1 score. Note also that in this case accuracy is the same as recall. The third column of Table 4 shows that i) predicting deletions that are a result of deleted accounts (i.e., spotting spammers) is much easier than predicting genuine deletions, and ii) predicting which tweets will become protected is the hardest task.\nOur manual analysis of the tweets discovered that a lot of deleted tweets contained curse words, leading us to examine the relationship between cursing and deletion in more detail. Curse words are known to express negative emotions (Jay, 2009), which lead us to hypoth-\nDeletion type % of tweets in test set Accuracy\nManual deletion 85.2 18.8 Protected 12.2 17.5 Account deleted 2.6 29.5\nTable 4: Proportion of different types of deletions and performance of our algorithm across these types.\nesize that tweets which contain curse words are more likely to be deleted. In order to test this hypothesis, we calculate the probabilities of a tweet being deleted conditioned on whether it contains a curse word. We use a list of 68 English curse words, and only consider English tweets from the test set. We find that the probability of deletion given that the tweet contains a curse word is 3.73%, compared to 3.09% for tweets that do not contain curse words. We perform a two-sample ztest and find that the difference is statistically significant at p = 0.0001, which supports our hypothesis."
