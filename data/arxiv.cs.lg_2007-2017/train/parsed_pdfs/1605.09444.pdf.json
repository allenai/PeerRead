INTRODUCTION\nransmission lines are protected by digital relays which operate accurately and reliably as compared to their solid state counterparts. Digital relay are invariably based on signal processing techniques. Faults occurring in transmission lines need to be detected, classified, and located fastly and accurately for keeping faulty part isolated from the healthy part thereby, ensuring minimum damage and disturbance. The speed, accuracy and reliability of digital protective relays are dependent on underlying techniques used in design. Fault classification task is an important task after the detection of fault for isolating the faulty section from healthy one, thus reducing damages to power systems [1]-[2]. The FACTS employed in modern power system achieve enhancement in transmittable power, improvement in the system stability, reduction in transmission losses and more flexibility in power control.

However, it acts non-linearly during faults and increases the complexity of the protection problem. Due to resonance between the system inductance and series capacitor, non fundamental decaying components as well as decaying DC components are present in the voltage and current signals. Odd harmonics are due to MOV conduction during faults and sub-synchronous frequencies having frequency components varying around half the fundamental frequency value, high frequency components (which results from resonance between line capacitance and line inductance) are present in addition to fundamental components of the steady state fault current. Thus, these signals are not processed very accurately with conventional methods such as full cycle DFT/half cycle DFT (FCDFT/HCDFT) or least square error (LSE) technique; thereby cause large error in estimation of the fundamental phasor. In light of these issues, the fault classification task is complicated in the presence of TCSC [3]-[4]. Techniques based on fuzzy logic, adaptive Kalman filtering, neural network, wavelet transform and support vector machine have been addressed in research studies for fault classification task [5-14]. In [5], Kalman filtering based technique has been used for fault classification task. However, the validity of the proposed method had been tested on a limited number of test cases. Classification technique based on artificial neural network (ANN) in a series compensated transmission lines is addressed in [6]-[8]. However, ANN involves empirical risk minimization and suffers from drawbacks like over fitting and trapping in local minima. Further in [6]-[8], the performance of the classification schemes have not been investigated over extensive test cases and the compensation level was kept constant. In [9]-[10], authors have suggested classification schemes based on wavelet transformation. Also, in [9]-[10], the proposed technique was validated only for limited cases. Some techniques based on fuzzy logic have also been presented for fault classification applications in [11]- [13]. A hybrid approach based on wavelet transform and fuzzy logic is proposed in [11]-[12]. Combination of fuzzy logic and higher order statistics (HOS) has been investigated in [13] for classification task considering a wide variation in the system conditions. Recently, support vector machine (SVM) based technique has been proposed for fault classification [14]-[17].\nA Novel Fault Classification Scheme Based on Least Square SVM\nH.C. Dubey1, A.K.

DOI: 10.1109/SCES.2012.6199047\nThe presence of FACTS devices in transmission line influence pre-fault as well as post-fault current signals thereby making the task of fault classification a complicated one. In spite of research studies done, fault classification in series compensated transmission lines still remains a challenge in terms of accurate and reliable classification with reduced computational burden and number of data sets for sake of online implementation. One of the most promising approach used for fault classification applications in a transmission line as reported [13, 15] is SVM. SVMs are classifiers based on structural risk minimization. An improved version of SVM is least square SVM (LSSVM) that retains all advantages of SVM with lesser computational burden. This paper proposes a novel scheme for accurate classification of faults in a series compensated transmission line based on LSSVM classifier using modular topology. The use of modular topology reduces the computational burden and time complexity of the proposed classification technique. The novelty of the work is three fold. First, the fault classification is studied in a series compensated transmission line rather a normal transmission line. Second, the introduction of LSSVM is new to fault classification task. Third, the modular topology of binary LSSVM classifier improves the performance. The proposed classifier is trained with input and output data-sets generated using Simulink model of studied power system in MATLAB environment. The rest of the paper is presented as follows; the LSSVM is briefly described in section II, proposed scheme is discussed in section III, followed by simulation and results in section IV. Finally, conclusions based on simulation results are given in section V.\nII. LEAST SQUARE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE\nSupport vector machines (SVMs) are statistical learning systems based on structural risk minimization used for pattern recognition. But, the computational complexity of SVMs is related to the number of training samples. As the sample size increases, the solution of the corresponding quadratic programming problem becomes complex resulting in slow computing speed. Least square SVM (LSSVM) is an improvement over SVM without losing its advantages [18]-[19]. LSSVM technique for classification and non-linear regression are characterized by linear Karaush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems [19]. Sparseness can be imposed in LSSVM using pruning as known in NNs. Non-linear SVM for classification and regression problems involves convex quadratic programming. The LSSVM as a classifier differs from conventional SVM in two ways; firstly it uses equality constraints and secondly, a squared loss function is taken as error variable [19].\nGiven a training data set of N points ( , )k kx y ,\nk=1,2,…,n where nkx R∈ is the k-th input data-set and\nky R∈ is the k-th output data-set. The SVM based classifier\ninvolves a decision function which is given by Ty w x b= + . Using the kernel function, the non-linear SVM becomes:\n1\n( ) ( , ) (1) N\nk f k k y x K x x bα = = +∑ The optimal separation of hyperplane is shown in Fig.1. LSSVM aims to build a classifier which is chracterized by following optimization problem:\n2\n, , 1\n1 1( , , ) (2) 2 2min N T LS k w b e k J w b e w w eγ = = + ∑\nSubject to the equality constraints\n, 1 ,2,..., (3)Tk k ky w x b e k n= + + =\nWhere ke are slack variable and γ is a positive real constant known as regularization parameter.

The selection of regularization parameter γ and the kernel parameter 2σ is very important for the classifiers. This work uses grid-search to decide appropriate regularization parameter γ and the kernel parameter 2σ . Grid-search is easy and direct as each pairparameter J,V is independent and it can be sorted in parallel. This classifier finds the optimal parameters in the objective function with cross-validation until the best parameters with high precision are found.\nIII. PROPOSED SCHEME\nThis section presents the application LSSVM to develop the modular multiclass classifier [20]. The block diagram of proposed scheme for fault classification and section identification is shown in Fig.2. The LSSVM based classifier are found to perform better when trained on lesser data sets thus enabling better accuracy with lesser training data sets [18]-[19]."
