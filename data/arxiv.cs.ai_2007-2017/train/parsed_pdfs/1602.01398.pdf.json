INTRODUCTION A lot of raw data is recorded during the monitoring of the energy efficient buildings [1]. In order to find the different aspect of the buildings performance the data is analyzed at later stages. The experts in the field usually analyze the data using different visualization tools [2]. The huge amount of data recorded makes it difficult for the experts to have a detailed performance analysis of buildings, thus making it hard to capture the different patterns, hence may lead to faults in the different components of building, reducing the energy efficiency.\nThe use of different data mining techniques can help in finding the different patterns in the buildings data, particularly clustering [3]–[5]. The automatic extraction of different patterns in large data set reduces the burden on experts in finding the different patterns in the data manually and helps in detailed analysis of the data. Therefore, the process of finding different patterns in the data can be feasible and less labor extensive [3], [4], [6].\nIn this paper an approach for automatically finding the different patterns in the building components operation has been proposed. In order to validate the outcomes, the proposed method has been applied to a data of adsorption chiller and compared to another approach called dynamic time warping (DTW). In first the ON/OFF cycle of the chiller is detected using the K-Means clustering algorithm, as the behavior of the\nchiller varies in these two different states. The patterns during the ON (operational) cycle is of greater importance for finding the performance of chillers and faults detection and diagnosis (FDD), therefore the data having ON cycle is considered in the proposed approach. Moreover, neglecting the OFF cycle will reduce the amount of data as well. The normalized ON cycles are discretized by using symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX). These discretized values are symbols or words. After transformation of the ON cycles to words, a histogram for each ON cycle is created called as bag of words representation (BoWR). Then the BoWR of ON cycles are clustered using hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, the results of the BoWR method with hierarchical clustering and DTW with hierarchical clustering are compared using cophenetic correlation. The cophenetic correlation demonstrates that the cluster tree have a strong correlation with the distances between objects in the distance vector [7].\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section II the relevant research work is discussed. Section III describes the system design while Section IV explains the methodology of the proposed method. Section V explains the results and outcomes applied to real life data. Finally, the conclusion and future directions is given in Section VI.\nII. STATE OF THE ART The advancement in sensors technology has made it feasible to record huge amount of data in commercial buildings. The huge amount of data storage makes it manually impossible to analyze it in detail. There are different tools used by experts in the field to visualize the data, which will further require manual analysis for performance of buildings. This process can be time extensive and there is always a chance to overlook some areas of interest [2].\nThere are different procedures available for faults detection and diagnosis (FDD) in buildings components e.g. HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning). Although, use of the earlier knowledge about the system can help in finding some of the faults with the first hand principles but still need more sophisticated techniques to find the different aspects of buildings performance. Black box models are available that are heavily dependent on the behavior or process of the system, which is generally captured from the historical data [8], [9]. Furthermore, the different machine learning algorithms can be used to detect faults in buildings by using the installed electricity consumption meter [10], [11]. Additionally, there are some parameters that can be useful for the prediction of electricity consumption for each of the HVAC component.\nThese parameters can be calculated by using multivariate analysis [12].\nThe key feature of data driven techniques in buildings is the focus on extracting knowledge from recorded data without detailed involvement of an expert. There are several popular unsupervised learning for extracting information. Such as, clustering can be used for finding the similar daily performance [3], [13], detecting the abnormal performance [14], and enhancing the performance optimization algorithms [15]. Moreover, wavelet transformations and clustering can be used in large scale for the classification of electrical demand profiles of buildings [16].\nThe data recorded for buildings are usually saved as time series data. There are different methods available for representing the time series data, thus will help in finding the similarity between the data having same behavior. The similarities can be found by using simple Euclidean distance between two time series data, but the problem will be even a slighter shift of data can lead to erroneous results [6]. There is another method called dynamic time warping (DTW) which overcomes the problem by using dynamic programming technique with defining the best alignment in data [17]. In [6] the comparison of algorithms (Euclidean, DTW, wavelets) with hierarchical cluster for finding different time series is done. They have also suggested the bag of patterns representation (BoPR) approach used for finding similarities in the time series data.\nThe bag of words model is used in several fields for classification [18]. The bag of words model can also be used with clustering to enhance the algorithm for finding the similarities between the time series data [6].\nThe time series data can be represented with a symbolic representation by using Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX). The use of SAX improve the speed and usability of several analysis techniques. SAX is a category of Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) representation and is used extensively in various applications [19].\nThere are several clustering algorithms available, which can be used for finding the different states of buildings energy. For example, clustering can be used to detect the state of machine for ON/OFF cycle as data vary in these two different states. The [20] used the X-Means clustering algorithm for automatically detecting the system states (ON/OFF), to examine the operational data of adsorption. The ON/OFF state information can also be used for finding outliers in the data [21]–[23].\nIII. SYSTEM DESIGN This section describes the system that has been used for the proposed method in this paper. The brief description of adsorption chiller is given along with data description used for the analysis of the paper."

As the data varies a lot in the two states (ON/OFF) of chiller, therefore we can cluster the data in two clusters. The K-Means clustering with two cluster and Euclidean distance setting is used to detect the ON and OFF state. After the detection of ON/OFF state at each point of time, the consecutive ON state are marked as one ON cycle. The same process is done for all consecutive ON/OFF states. The ON status is of more importance than OFF cycle, for finding the performance of the chiller."

      "heading" : "C. Hierarchical Clustering",
      "text" : "The hierarchical clustering is applied with Dynamic time warping and proposed method of bag of words representation (BoWR) method. Figure 6 shows the results of clustering with DTW and Figure 7 is describing the results with BoWR. Both methods have classified the cycles correctly. The first advantage of BoWR over DTW is the dimension reduction, as each cycle is represented with significantly less data. Secondly, for comparing the clustering performance with both methods the cophenetic coefficients [7] has been calculated for hierarchical clustering. The cophenetic correlation demonstrates that the cluster tree have a strong correlation with the distances between objects in the distance vector. Table 3 shows the cophenetic coefficients with different hierarchical clustering methods for BoWR and DTW techniques. The BoWR has strong correlation with distance with all other objects in all clustering method. The best results for BoWR are attained with ‘Average’ method for hierarchical clustering.\nVI. CONCLUSION A bag of word representation (BoWR) method with hierarchical clustering is proposed in this paper for finding the\ndifferent patterns in the chiller performance. First a K-Means clustering is used to find the ON (operational) cycles of the chiller. These ON cycles are represented with symbols by using symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) method. Furthermore, the symbolic representation is transformed to BoWR, which is provided to hierarchical clustering for detection of bad, average and good Carnot coefficient of performance (COP).\nThe Dynamic time warping (DTW) is also implemented with hierarchical clustering and results are compared with the proposed method. The important points during comparison are following:\n• The cophenetic coefficients have shown that the BoWR has produced better results as compared to DTW.\n• The other benefit of using BoWR is the reduction in dimension as a large amount of ON cycle is represented with less details.\nIn future, the current research can be used in the field of automatic detection and diagnostics of faults (FDD) in buildings, as the current research helps in finding the different performance patterns. This would help the experts in the field to look only for those areas where the performance is bad. The further research is needed to find intelligent way of diagnosing the faults"

    "abstractText" : "The understanding of the buildings operation has become a challenging task due to the large amount of data recorded in energy efficient buildings. Still, today the experts use visual tools for analyzing the data. In order to make the task realistic, a method has been proposed in this paper to automatically detect the different patterns in buildings. The K-Means clustering is used to automatically identify the ON (operational) cycles of the chiller. In the next step the ON cycles are transformed to symbolic representation by using Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) method. Then the SAX symbols are converted to bag of words representation for hierarchical clustering. Moreover, the proposed technique is applied to real life data of adsorption chiller. Additionally, the results from the proposed method and dynamic time warping (DTW) approach are also discussed and compared.
