INTRODUCTION\nBSAICS of neuroeconomist emerged from a prevailedparadigm that keeps encouraging interdisciplinary studies particularly hose fields which can reciprocally affect each other. During the 90s , after a great deal of endeavour and effort, several fields and disciplines including neuroscience, experimental and behavioural economics, and cognitive and social psychology joined together in order to form a new interdisciplinary field named neuroeconomics[1]. Neuroeconomics aims at understanding Human decision making and the way the brain processes multiple alternatives. In other words, it aims to understand how the brain adopts an optimal course of action. Moreover, the relationship between Neuroscience and each of the fields mentioned above is reciprocal. That is, neuroeconomics can provide us with novel insights into how the brain processes decision making on one hand and on the other hand neuroscience , computer, mathematics and cognitive psychology can provide great insight in determining economic decisions and models.(Similar to the group done on Telecom auction in the UK which remarkably increased corresponding profits)\nBefore neuroeconomics appeared among high level scientific fields, many people had come up with different models to provide a good explanation for the familiar\nK.

These theories such as ”Revealed Preference Theory” or ”Prospect Theory” had been expanded upon by Tversky and Kahnemen[3]. Despite the variety of the problems dealt with in neuroeconomics, they share a two common factors, i.e. the decision making process and joint interaction of agent systems in the environment. Since we know there is a loose relationship between decision making and the learning algorithm depending on the problem, we could proceed with different learning algorithms that shed some lights on the decision making processes[2].\nFrom a behavioural economist viewpoint, problems like inefficient choice behaviour and maximizing utility have so far been elaborated upon by some models emerging from neuroeconomics namely, ’dual processes’ and ’evolutionary heuristics’ which appeal to cognitive psychologists and economists alike[1][4]. But within the field of cognitive psychology and neuroscience, we are more likely to encounter problems related do with the neural substrate of decision making particularly in the brain and its concatenated components like risk taking, expectation and the reward which are interrelated with neural information processing through many important mechanisms (particularly changes in neurotransmitters like Dopamine or Serotonin). Here we are interested in offering a new algorithm for these cognitive aspects of the decision making problem given the novel machine learning methods.\nSince neuroeconomics takes into account a bundle of vital factors such as risk, reward, expectation and uncertainty (all of them originated from neural information processing), we need the theories which can explain the ongoings in the brain when people make a choice under different conditions already mentioned. One of the best examples that illustrates the interaction between brain studies and machine learning is the case that is tightened with this study too. A model called ”reward prediction error” based on the Rescolar-Wagner algorithm drawn from classical conditioning, 4V = αβ(λ −∑ V ), estimates neural activities of Dopamine releasing . Such studies led both neuroeconomists and neuroscientists to believe that human behaviour in decision making is widely controlled by Dopamine activity mediating reward system, chiefly through different brain regions such as the substantia nigra, the ventral tegmental area(VTA) and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus[4]. The appeal of this theory comes from\nar X\niv :1\n40 1.\n35 79\nv2 [\ncs .G\nT ]\n2 2\nFe b\n20 14\nthe fact that Dopamine could describe the difference between ”how rewarding an event is and how rewarding it was expected to be”[4]. This dramatic finding also revealed that Dopamine activity could be successfully modelled by Reinforcement Learning Algorithm and Optimal Control Theory."

      "text" : "It has been proposed that there exists ”a rather direct mapping of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms onto the brain”, in which Dopamine serves as a teaching signal to train values or policies by controlling synaptic plasticity in targets such as the ventral and dorsolateral striatum. In addition , It has been depicted that the Brain puts into effect these models to make choice under uncertainty and Dopamine releasing is along with the quantities akin to the temporal difference prediction error mostly refer to as TD algorithm. Besides, there is another family of adaptive algorithm called Actor-critic which is applied to approximate the value function given by TD. I am willing to focus my work on the latter one, namely, this very adaptive actor-critic algorithm.\nBy far and large , the problem we would like to tackle is to find and develop novel algorithms to implement how the beliefs ruling our decision making behaviour are shaped. In other words, we strive to measure the desirability of a state so that we could say ”how much a state is wanted and how much it is liked”[1]. These behaviours are related to two unobservable or latent variables : rewards and beliefs. We will attempt to grasping a novel algorithm based on actor-critic algorithm using a vast set of data, and a ”dopamine release function” δ : M −→ R where r is the reward function. Basically, the set of data is defined in terms of a metric space including generic element z ∈ Zn. The set of all possible choices is defined over Z. Mathematically the support of Z is defined as :\nΛ(z) = p ∈ Λ|pz > 0 (1)\nwhere p ∈ Λ is the generic element of the choices set. Existing publications suggest relationships among variables, some of which are observed in behaviour. For instance we want to calculate values like utility based on parameters like risk aversion which could be defined as a mapping comprised of the reward and belief system. Ultimately, we want to show how these risk parameters could be drawn from our articulated actor-critic algorithms which could explain Dopamine releasing as well.\nSince we assume , Dopamine activity turns us into goal directed agents, it could be gathered that understanding utility could consequently be achieved through evaluating a set of goal directed actions that ends us finding a policy which defines these goal directed actions[5]. Many algorithms have been offered based on different methods of learning but there remain some obstacles in the way ahead. Firstly,\nbecause of some underlying parameters that associate with unobservable states and furthermore the static essence of the system-regardless of dynamical demeanour of its two main sections-this type of algorithms are bound to stay out of evolution as time passes by. Secondly, the problem with model-based prediction and control is its complexity that leads the necessary calculations to compute values produce error. One way around at least some of this complexity is to break the total anticipated value of future state transitions by using the computational process of ”caching” to store the results of this tree search. Strictly the aim of this study is to solve the first problem by modifying and articulating of general version of actor-critic algorithm."

      "text" : "To make predictions about future punishments or rewards an agent could use a model of the world. This model should signify the probability with which the subject will transit from one state to the next, perhaps depending on what actions it takes, and what the likely outcomes of the states are, which in turn may depend on the actions. Psychologically speaking, since these values depend on the expected outcomes and their modelled utilities, this sort of control is considered to be goal-directed. The model should depict not only the best action but the expected utility of the outcomes. The main problem is that since the working memory is limited and we are dealing with a huge amount of data, computing the values and processing the necessary information would prove a difficult task[6]."

      "text" : "First of all, we shall note that a goal directed choice is a choice based on a pair of actions a, b ∈ A, where A is called action space beside state space comprising the states or choices. To make the right choice the goal directed agents need a suitable policy but before that, they must assign values to actions that are proportional to the amount of reward expected. After that , the agent needs to choose the action which has been assigned the highest value. This process of value assignment could be denoted as follows:\nUa = ∑ x p(s)r(oa(S)) (2)\nwhere oa(S) is the outcome generated by action a.\nNow we want to divide these assigned values(because of the huge amount of data) into learning about the states(classical conditioning) and learning about the actions(instrumental learning). After computing the state values\nV (s) = R(s) + ∑ a ∑ s′ π(s, a)T (s, a, πs ′ )V (s ′ ) (3)\nwhere policy π(s, a) represents choosing action a in state s. We can now compute the prediction error(Dopamine releasing), i.e. δt = rt + V̂ (st+1) − V̂ (st). These V̂ (st)\nvalues are technically called critics and we can define another separate module called actor(which evaluates actions instead of states denoted by Q(s, a). Now we can compute the advantage of our system concerning action a which equals the difference between the future value of taking action a and the future value averaged over actions : A(s, a) = Q(s, a)−V (s).\nProposed Algorithm\nIn general, this actor/critic approach could indicate the best action and policy to carry out Pavlovian conditioning. Even so, since this method includes two computational processes, when we are dealing with a huge amount of data , are likely to encounter some errors and more importantly limited working memory. To avoid these problem, we will use the utility function Ux = ∑ x p(s)r(ox(S)) to help the algorithm work properly by turning the algorithm into the supervised actor critic algorithm. In this algorithm the supervisor Ux adds structure to our algorithm with a feedback controller that is easily designed yet sub-optimal, and a human operator monitoring the actors choices. During the experiment, the supervisor provides the actor with hints about which actions may or may not be promising for the current situation, thereby altering the exploratory nature of the actor’s trial-and-error learning.\nTaken together,the actor, the supervisor and the gain scheduler form a ’composite’ actor that dispatches a composite action to the environment. The environment responds to this action with a transition from the current state, s, to the next state, s ′ . The environment also supply an evaluation called the immediate reward,r[7]. The task of the critic is to observe states and rewards and to build a value function, V (s), that accounts for both immediate and future rewards received under the composite policy, . This value function is recursively defined as :\nV π(s) = ∑ a UaR(s ′ ) + γV π(s ′ ) (4)\nwhere γ ∈ [0, 1] is a factor that discounts the value of the next state. Here we focus on deterministic policies, although this process also generalizes to the stochastic case where π represents a distribution for choosing actions probabilistically. At last, the Temporal Difference in this algorithm or the amount of Dopamine as such, could be written as following:\nδ = r + γV (s ′ )− V (s) (5)\nnow inserting the parametrized function U in the (3), will lead us to derive a new form of delta error as follows:\nδ = r2 + (γV (s ′ )− V (s))2 (6)\nThe resulting modified algorithm was implemented as the movements of an agent in choice making. We took ’Grid Sailing Task’ as our task in which the agent should takes a step (through moving a cursor) towards the goal in a grid from the left side to the far end of the right side of the grid(that shapes our state space). We associate a reward to\neach action given the state it resides in. So the agent is asked to reach a goal directed (reward associated) state on the other side of the grid. Here a value function (V ) is computed along with each movement in the way our agent learns to value the states neighbouring to the reward, and then incrementally learns to come after the optimal pathway which is the midway (bold straight line) in grid. To initialize the program , we randomize a parametrized policy first and define the state space as a matrix of the size 3 by 5 and run the program for 8 times to measure the average time that takes to obtain optimal reward.\nIn the following figures, you could see the final result where the agent received a permanent reward and found an optimal pathway that is the straight mid-line as such. The plot of action values, Q, in addition to the time execution, ’te’, is shown."

      "heading" : "IV. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "The present study suggests an algorithm which takes into account a different type of value inspired by Pavlovian conditioning that assigns a value to a state-as well as action selection which affects choice making processes. Although, these values are not associated with actions, they however can affect behaviour in different manners; most importantly these values can manipulate choice, seemingly by transforming information about the likelihood of paying off by an action regarding its particular result. It is worth noting that all we have done so far to offer this algorithm - that is a modified version of actor/critic algorithm-was lean on neurophysiological findings-you can find out more in [8]- that on the whole demonstrate that those functions that are to execute choice making processes are liaised to reward related circuity that holds an interaction between cortex and straitum and also this reward based network is consisted of two distinct processes(goal directed and habitual trends) similar to what we did here to assign actor and critic mechanisms to both of them respectively. Besides this all, we knew that the incoming neural information should be first represented so as to get processed then. Since there exists various ways to represent the value functions and also since a probabilistic structure is involved too , we may wish to try to fit this all into a Bayesian framework through which at least two important elements such as finding its maximum and utility could be taken as tantamount to reward and value functions. Finally, because we are dealt with priors when it comes to make a choice , we can not only finesse our model in terms of Bayesian elements but we can further our knowledge about information processing in striatum, amygdala, and dopaminergic pathways.\nAPPENDIX IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS\nThe time execution was calculated as t = 7.862453 after 8 trials."
