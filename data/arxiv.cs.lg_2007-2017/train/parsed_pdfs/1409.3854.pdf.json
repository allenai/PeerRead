      "text" : "Clustering, the unsupervised classification of patterns into groups, is one of the most important tasks in exploratory data analysis [58]. Primary goals of clustering include gaining insight into, classifying, and compressing data. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific disciplines including anthropology, biology, medicine, psychology, statistics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science. As a result, numerous clustering algorithms have been proposed since the early 1950s [57].\nClustering algorithms can be broadly classified into two groups: hierarchical and partitional [58]. Hierarchical algorithms recursively find nested clusters either in a top-down (divisive) or bottom-up (agglomerative) fashion. In contrast, partitional algorithms find all the clusters simultaneously as a partition of the data and do not impose a hierarchical structure. Most hierarchical algorithms have time complexity quadratic or higher in the number of data points [110] and therefore are not suitable for large data sets, whereas partitional algorithms often have lower complexity.\nGiven a data set X = {x1,x2, . . . ,xN} ⊂ R D, i.e., N points (vectors) each with D attributes (components), hard partitional algorithms divide X into K exhaustive and mutually exclusive clusters C = {C1, C2, . . . , CK}, ⋃K\ni=1 Ci = X , Ci ∩ Cj = ∅ for 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ K. These algorithms usually generate clusters by optimizing a criterion function [47]. The most intuitive and frequently used criterion function is the Sum of Squared Error (SSE) given by\nSSE =\nK ∑\ni=1\n∑\nxj∈Ci\n‖xj − ci‖ 2\n2 , (1)\nwhere\nci = 1\n|Ci|\n∑\nxj∈Ci\nxj (2)\nand\n‖xj‖2 =\n(\nD ∑\nd=1\nx2jd\n)1/2\n(3)\ndenote the centroid of cluster Ci (with cardinality |Ci|) and the Euclidean (ℓ2) norm of vector xj = (xj1, xj2, . . . , xjD), respectively.\nThe number of ways in which a set of N objects can be partitioned into K non-empty groups is given by Stirling numbers of the second kind\nS(N,K) = 1\nK!\nK ∑\ni=0\n(−1)K−i ( K\ni\n)\niN , (4)\nwhich can be approximated by KN/K! It can be seen that a complete enumeration of all possible clusterings to determine the global minimum of (1) is clearly computationally prohibitive except for very small data sets. In fact, this non-convex optimization problem is proven to be NP-hard even forK = 2 [30, 4] or D = 2 [105, 78]. Consequently, various heuristics have been developed to provide approximate solutions to this problem [101]. Most of the early approaches [38, 60, 77, 97, 99, 12, 52, 76] were simple procedures based on the alternating minimization algorithm [28]. In contrast, recent approaches are predominantly based on various metaheuristics [93, 29] that are capable of avoiding bad local minima at the expense of significantly increased computational requirements. These include heuristics based on simulated annealing [69], evolution strategies [10], tabu search [3], genetic algorithms [84], variable neighborhood search [50], memetic algorithms [89], scatter search [88], ant colony optimization [49], differential evolution [90], and particle swarm optimization [90]. Among all these heuristics, Lloyd’s algorithm [76], often referred to as the (batch) k-means algorithm, is the simplest and most commonly used one. This algorithm starts with K arbitrary centers, typically chosen uniformly at random from the data points. Each point is assigned to the nearest center and then each center is recalculated as the mean of all points assigned to it. These two steps are repeated until a predefined termination criterion is met. K-means can be expressed in algorithmic notation as follows:\n1. Choose the initial set of centers c1, c2, . . . , cK arbitrarily. 2. Assign point xj (j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}) to the nearest center with respect to\nℓ2 distance, that is\nxj ∈ Cı̂ ⇐⇒ ı̂ = argmin i∈{1,2,...,K}\n‖xj − ci‖ 2\n2 .\n3. Recalculate center ci (i ∈ {1, 2, . . . ,K}) as the centroid of Ci, that is\nci = 1\n|Ci|\n∑\nxj∈Ci\nxj .\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\nK-means is undoubtedly the most widely used partitional clustering algorithm [58, 110, 15, 17, 85, 40, 57, 109, 47]. Its popularity can be attributed to several reasons. First, it is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Virtually every data mining software includes an implementation of it. Second, it is versatile, i.e., almost every aspect of the algorithm (initialization, distance function, termination criterion, etc.) can be modified. This is evidenced by hundreds of publications over the last fifty years that extend k-means in a variety of ways. Third, it has a time complexity that is linear in N , D, and K (in general, D ≪ N and K ≪ N). For this reason, it can be used to initialize more expensive clustering algorithms such as expectation\nmaximization [81], fuzzy c-means [16, p. 35], DBSCAN [31], spectral clustering [107, 27], ant colony clustering [83], and particle swarm clustering [104]. Furthermore, numerous sequential [91, 65, 35, 71, 48, 62, 34] and parallel [45, 108, 56, 26, 14, 5, 73, 70] acceleration techniques are available in the literature. Fourth, it has a storage complexity that is linear in N , D, and K. In addition, there exist disk-based variants that do not require all points to be stored in memory [20, 37, 87, 61]. Fifth, it is guaranteed to converge [96] at a quadratic rate [18]. Finally, it is invariant to data ordering, i.e., random shufflings of the data points.\nOn the other hand, k-means has several significant disadvantages. First, it requires the number of clusters, K, to be specified in advance. The value of this parameter can be determined automatically by means of various internal/relative cluster validity measures [106, 9, 6]. Second, it can only detect compact, hyperspherical clusters that are well separated. This can be alleviated by using a more general distance function such as the Mahalanobis distance, which permits the detection of hyperellipsoidal clusters [79, 80]. Third, due its utilization of the squared Euclidean distance, it is sensitive to noise and outlier points since even a few such points can significantly influence the means of their respective clusters. This can be addressed by outlier pruning [111] or by using a more robust distance function such as the city-block (ℓ1) distance [98, 59, 36]. Fourth, due to its gradient descent nature, it often converges to a local minimum of the criterion function [96]. For the same reason, it is highly sensitive to the selection of the initial centers [25]. Adverse effects of improper initialization include empty clusters, slower convergence, and a higher chance of getting stuck in bad local minima [23]. Fortunately, except for the first two, these drawbacks can be remedied by using an adaptive initialization method (IM).\nA large number of IMs have been proposed in the literature [92, 53, 23, 32, 25]. Unfortunately, many of these have time complexity superlinear in N [72, 8, 52, 67, 74, 1, 94, 2, 21, 64], which makes them impractical for large data sets (note that k-means itself has linear time complexity). In contrast, linear IMs are often random and/or order-sensitive [38, 60, 77, 11, 103, 99, 19, 7], which renders their results unreliable. In this study, we investigate the empirical performance of six linear, deterministic (non-random), and orderinvariant k-means IMs on a large and diverse collection of data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\nThe rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of linear, deterministic, and order-invariant k-means IMs. Section 3 describes the experimental setup. Section 4 presents and discusses the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 gives the conclusions."

      "text" : "In this study, we focus on IMs that have time complexity linear in N . This is because k-means itself has linear complexity, which is perhaps the most important reason for its popularity. Therefore, an IM for k-means should not diminish this advantage of the algorithm. Accordingly, the following six linear, deterministic, and order-invariant IMs are investigated.\nThe maximin (MM) method [46] chooses the first center c1 arbitrarily from the data points and the remaining (K − 1) centers are chosen successively as follows. In iteration i (i ∈ {2, 3, . . . ,K}), the ith center ci is chosen to be the point with the greatest minimum ℓ2 distance to the previously selected (i−1) centers, i.e., c1, c2, . . . , ci−1. This method can be expressed in algorithmic notation as follows:\n1. Choose the first center c1 arbitrarily from the data points. 2. Choose the next center ci (i ∈ {2, 3, . . . ,K}) as the point x̂ that satisfies\n̂ = argmax j∈{1,2,...,N}\n(\nmin k∈{1,2,...,i−1}\n‖xj − ck‖ 2\n2\n)\n.\n3. Repeat step 2 (K − 1) times.\nDespite the fact that it was originally developed as a 2-approximation to the K-center clustering problem1, MM is commonly used as a k-means initializer2. In this study, the first center is chosen to be the centroid of X given by\nx̄ = 1\nN\nN ∑\nj=1\nxj . (5)\nNote that c1 = x̄ gives the optimal SSE when K = 1. Katsavounidis et al.’s method (KK) [66] is identical to MM with the exception that the first center is chosen to be the point with the greatest ℓ2 norm 3, that is, the point x̂ that satisfies\n1 Given a set of N points in a metric space, the goal of K-center clustering is to find K representative points (centers) such that the maximum distance of a point to a center is minimized [51, p. 63]. A polynomial-time algorithm is said to be a δ-approximation algorithm for a minimization problem if for every instance of the problem it delivers a solution whose cost is at most δ times the cost of the optimal solution (δ is often referred to as the “approximation ratio” or “approximation factor”) [54, p. xv]. 2 Interestingly, several authors including Thorndike [102], Casey and Nagy [22], Batchelor and Wilkins [13], Kennard and Stone [68], and Tou and Gonzalez [103, pp. 92–94] had proposed similar (or even identical) methods decades earlier. Gonzalez [46], however, was the one to prove the theoretical properties of the method. 3 This choice was motivated by a vector quantization application.\n̂ = argmax j∈{1,2,...,N}\n‖xj‖ 2\n2 . (6)\nThe PCA-Part (PP) method [100] uses a divisive hierarchical approach based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [63]. Starting from an initial cluster that contains the entire data set X , the method successively selects the cluster with the greatest SSE and divides it into two subclusters using a hyperplane that passes through the cluster centroid and is orthogonal to the principal eigenvector of the cluster covariance matrix. This iterative cluster selection and splitting procedure is repeated (K − 1) times. The final centers are then given by the centroids of the resulting K subclusters. This method can be expressed in algorithmic notation as follows:\n1. Let Ci be the cluster with the greatest SSE and ci be the centroid of this cluster. In the first iteration, C1 = X and c1 = x̄. 2. Let p be the projection of ci on the principal eigenvector vi of Ci, i.e., p = ci · vi, where ‘·’ denotes the dot product. 3. Divide Ci into two subclusters Ci1 and Ci2 according to the following rule: For any xj ∈ Ci, if xj · vi ≤ p, then assign xj to Ci1 ; otherwise, assign it to Ci2 . 4. Repeat steps 1–3 (K − 1) times.\nThe Var-Part (VP) method [100] is an approximation to PP, where, in each iteration, the covariance matrix of the cluster to be split is assumed to be diagonal. In this case, the splitting hyperplane is orthogonal to the coordinate axis with the greatest variance. In other words, the only difference between VP and PP is the choice of the projection axis.\nFigure 1 [24] illustrates VP on a toy data set with four natural clusters [95][67, p. 100]. In iteration 1, the initial cluster that contains the entire data set is split into two subclusters along the Y axis using a line (i.e., a one-dimensional hyperplane) passing through the mean point (92.026667). Between the resulting two clusters, the one above the line has a greater SSE. In iteration 2, this cluster is thus split along the X axis at the mean point (66.975000). In the final iteration, the cluster with the greatest SSE, i.e., the bottom cluster, is split along the X axis at the mean point (41.057143). In Figure 1(d), the centroids of the final four clusters are denoted by stars.\nThe maxisum (MS) method4 is a recent modification of MM. It can be expressed in algorithmic notation as follows:\n1. Determine the attribute with the greatest absolute coefficient of variation (ratio of the standard deviation to the mean), that is, the attribute x.d1 that satisfies\nd1 = argmax d∈{1,2,...,D}\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ sd md ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ,\nwhere\n4 Erişoğlu et al., Pattern Recognition Letters 32(14), 1701–1705 (2011)\nmd = 1\nN\nN ∑\nj=1\nxjd\nand\ns2d = 1\nN − 1\nN ∑\nj=1\n(xjd −md) 2\ndenote the mean and variance of the dth attribute x.d, respectively. 2. Determine the attribute with the least Pearson product-moment correla-\ntion with x.d1 , that is, the attribute x.d2 that satisfies\nd2 = argmin d∈{1,2,...,D}\nN ∑\nj=1\n(xjd1 −md1)(xjd −md)\n√\nN ∑\nj=1\n(xjd1 −md1) 2\n√\nN ∑\nj=1\n(xjd −md)2\n. (7)\nNote that since we calculated the mean and standard deviation of each attribute in step 1, the following expression can be used in place of (7) to save computational time:\nd2 = argmin d∈{1,2,...,D}\nN ∑\nj=1\n(\nxjd1 −md1 sd1\n)(\nxjd −md sd\n)\n. (8)\n3. Let Y = {y1,y2, . . . ,yN} ⊂ R 2 be the projection ofX = {x1,x2, . . . ,xN} ⊂\nR D onto the two-dimensional subspace determined in steps 1 and 2. In\nother words, yj = (xjd1 , xjd2 ) for j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}. 4. Choose the first center c1 as the point farthest from the centroid ȳ of Y\nwith respect to ℓ2 distance, that is, the point ŷ that satisfies\n̂ = argmax j∈{1,2,...,N}\n‖yj − ȳ‖ 2\n2 .\n5. Choose the next center ci (i ∈ {2, 3, . . . ,K}) as the point with the greatest cumulative ℓ2 distance from the previously selected (i − 1) centers, that is, the point ŷ that satisfies\n̂ = argmax j∈{1,2,...,N}\ni−1 ∑\nk=1\n‖yj − ck‖2 .\n6. Repeat step 5 (K − 1) times.\nNote that steps 1 and 2 above provide rough approximations to the first two PCs and that steps 4 and 5 are performed in the two-dimensional subspace spanned by the attributes determined in steps 1 and 2.\nClearly, MS is a derivative of MM. Differences between the two methods are as follows:\n⊲ MM chooses the first center arbitrarily from the data points, whereas MS chooses it to be the point farthest from the mean of the projected data set. ⊲ MM chooses the remaining (K − 1) centers iteratively based on their minimum distance from the previously selected centers, whereas MS uses a cumulative distance criterion. Note that while the selection criterion used in MM provides an approximation guarantee of factor 2 for the K-center clustering problem (see footnote 1 on page 5), it is unclear whether or not MS offers any approximation guarantees. ⊲ MM performs the distance calculations in the original D-dimensional space, whereas MS works in a two-dimensional subspace. A serious drawback of the projection operation employed in MS is that the method disregards all attributes but two and therefore is likely to be effective only for data sets in which the variability is mostly on two dimensions. Unfor-\ntunately, the motivation behind this particular projection scheme is not given by Erişoğlu et al.\nInterestingly, MS also bears a striking resemblance to a method proposed by DeSarbo et al. [33] almost three decades earlier. The latter method differs from the former in two ways. First, it works in the original D-dimensional space. Second, it chooses the first two centers as the pair of points with the greatest ℓ2 distance. Unfortunately, the determination of the first two centers in this method leads to a time complexity quadratic in N . Therefore, this method was not included in the experiments. More recently, Glasbey et al. [42] mentioned a very similar method within the context of color palette design.\nWe also experimented with a modified version of the MS method (MS+), which is identical to MS with the exception that there is no projection involved. In other words, MS+ operates in the original D-dimensional space.\nFor a comprehensive overview of these methods and others, the reader is referred to a recent article by Celebi et al. [25]. It should be noted that, in this study, we do not attempt to compare a mix of deterministic and random IMs. Instead, we focus on deterministic methods for two main reasons. First, these methods are generally computationally more efficient as they need to be executed only once. In contrast, random methods are inherently unreliable in that the quality of their results is unpredictable and thus it is common practice to perform multiple runs of such methods and take the output of the run5 that produces the best objective function value. Second, several studies [100, 24, 25] demonstrated that despite the fact that they are executed only once, some deterministic methods are highly competitive with well-known and effective random methods such as Bradley and Fayyad’s method [19] and k-means++ [7]."

Two commonly used normalization schemes are linear scaling to unit range (min-max normalization) and linear scaling to unit variance (z-score normalization). Several studies revealed that the former scheme is preferable to the latter since the latter is likely to eliminate valuable between-cluster variation [82, 43, 44]. As a result, we used the min-max normalization scheme to map the attributes of each data set to the [0, 1] interval."

      "heading" : "3.3 Performance Criteria",
      "text" : "The performance of the IMs was quantified using two effectiveness (quality) and one efficiency (speed) criteria:\n⊲ Initial SSE (IS): This is the SSE value calculated after the initialization phase, before the clustering phase. It gives us a measure of the effectiveness of an IM by itself. ⊲ Final SSE (FS): This is the SSE value calculated after the clustering phase. It gives us a measure of the effectiveness of an IM when its output is refined by k-means. Note that this is the objective function of the k-means algorithm, i.e., (1). ⊲ Number of Iterations (NI): This is the number of iterations that kmeans requires until reaching convergence when initialized by a particular IM. It is an efficiency measure independent of programming language, implementation style, compiler, and CPU architecture. Note that we do not report CPU time measurements since on most data sets that we tested each of the six IMs completed within a few milliseconds (gcc v4.4.5, Intel Core i7-3960X 3.30GHz).\nThe convergence of k-means was controlled by the disjunction of two criteria: the number of iterations reaches a maximum of 100 or the relative improvement in SSE between two consecutive iterations drops below a threshold [75], i.e., (SSEi−1 − SSEi) /SSEi ≤ ǫ, where SSEi denotes the SSE value at the end of the ith (i ∈ {2, . . . , 100}) iteration. The convergence threshold was set to ǫ = 10−6."

      "heading" : "4 Experimental Results and Discussion",
      "text" : "Tables 2–4 give the performance measurements for each method (the best values are underlined). Since the number of iterations fall within [0, 100], we can directly obtain descriptive statistics such as minimum, maximum, mean, and median for this criterion over the 24 data sets. In contrast, initial/final SSE values are unnormalized and therefore incomparable across different data sets. In order to circumvent this problem, for each data set, we calculated the percent SSE of each method relative to the worst (greatest) SSE. For example, it can be seen from Table 2 that on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin data set the initial SSE of MM is 498, whereas the worst initial SSE on the same data set is 596 and thus the ratio of the former to the latter is 0.836. This simply means that on this data set MM obtains 100(1− 0.836) ≈ 16% better initial SSE than the worst method, KK. Table 5 gives the summary statistics for the normalized initial/final SSE’s obtained in this manner and those for the number of iterations. As usual, min (minimum) and max (maximum) represent the best and worst case performance, respectively. Mean represents the aver-\nage case performance, whereas median quantifies the typical performance of a method without regard to outliers. For example, with respect to the initial SSE criterion, PP performs, on the average, about 100− 21.46 ≈ 79% better than the worst method.\nFor convenient visualization, Figure 2 shows the box plots that depict the five-number summaries (minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum) for the normalized initial/final SSE’s calculated in the aforementioned manner and the five-number summary for the number of iterations. Here, the bottom and top end of the whiskers of a box represent the minimum and maximum, respectively, whereas the bottom and top of the box itself are the 25th percentile (Q1 ) and 75th percentile (Q3 ), respectively. The line that passes through the box is the 50th percentile (Q2 ), i.e., the median, while the small square inside the box denotes the mean.\nWith respect to effectiveness, the following observations can be made:\nWith respect to computational efficiency, the following observations can be made:\n⊲ An average (or typical) run of KK lead to the fastest k-means convergence. ⊲ An average (or typical) run of PP lead to the second fastest k-means convergence. ⊲ An average run of MS lead to the slowest k-means convergence. ⊲ A typical run of MM lead to the slowest k-means convergence.\nIn summary, our experiments showed that VP and PP performed very similarly with respective to both effectiveness criteria and they outperformed the\nremaining four methods by a large margin. The former method has a time complexity of O(ND), whereas the latter one has a complexity of O(ND2) when implemented using the power method [55]. Therefore, on high dimensional data sets, the former method might be preferable. On the other hand, on low dimensional data sets, the latter method might be preferable as it often leads to faster k-means convergence. The main disadvantage of these two methods is that they are more complicated to implement due to their hierarchical formulation. As for the remaining four methods, when compared to MM, KK was significantly worse in terms of initial SSE, slightly better in terms of final SSE, and significantly better in terms of number of iterations. Interestingly, despite its similarities with MM, the most recent method that we examined, i.e., MS, often gave the worst results. It was also demonstrated that by eliminating the 2-dimensional projection step, the performance of MS can be substantially improved with respect to final SSE. This, however, comes at the expense of a performance degradation with respect to initial SSE. Consequently, in either of its forms, the MS method rediscovered recently by Erişoğlu et al. does not appear to outperform the classical MM method or the more recent hierarchical methods VP and PP. This is not surprising given that MS can easily choose two nearby points as centers provided that they each have a large cumulative distance to the remaining centers [42]."

These included the popular maximin method and three of its variants and two relatively unknown divisive hierarchical methods. Experiments on a large and diverse collection of real-world data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository demonstrated that the hierarchical methods outperform the remaining four methods with respect to two objective effectiveness criteria. These hierarchical methods can be used to initialize k-means effectively, particularly in time-critical applications that involve large data sets. Alternatively, they can be used as approximate clustering algorithms without additional k-means refinement. Our experiments also revealed that the most recent variant of the maximin method performs surprisingly poorly."

    "abstractText" : "Over the past five decades, k-means has become the clustering algorithm of choice in many application domains primarily due to its simplicity, time/space efficiency, and invariance to the ordering of the data points. Unfortunately, the algorithm’s sensitivity to the initial selection of the cluster centers remains to be its most serious drawback. Numerous initialization methods have been proposed to address this drawback. Many of these methods, however, have time complexity superlinear in the number of data points, which makes them impractical for large data sets. On the other hand, linear methods are often random and/or sensitive to the ordering of the data points. These methods are generally unreliable in that the quality of their results is unpredictable. Therefore, it is common practice to perform multiple runs of such methods and take the output of the run that produces the best results. Such a practice, however, greatly increases the computational requirements of the otherwise highly efficient k-means algorithm. In this chapter, we investigate the empirical performance of six linear, deterministic (non-random), and order-invariant k-means initialization methods on a large and diverse collection of data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results demonstrate that two relatively unknown hierarchical initialization methods due to Su and Dy outperform the remaining four methods with respect to two objective effectiveness criteria. In addition, a recent method due to Erişoğlu et al. performs surprisingly poorly. M.
