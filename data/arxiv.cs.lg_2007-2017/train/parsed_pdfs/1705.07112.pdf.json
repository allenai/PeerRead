      "text" : "We propose an approximation method for thresholding of singular values using Chebyshev polynomial approximation (CPA). Many signal processing problems require iterative application of singular value decomposition (SVD) for minimizing the rank of a given data matrix with other cost functions and/or constraints, which is called matrix rank minimization. In matrix rank minimization, singular values of a matrix are shrunk by hard-thresholding, softthresholding, or weighted soft-thresholding. However, the computational cost of SVD is generally too expensive to handle high dimensional signals such as images; hence, in this case, matrix rank minimization requires enormous computation time. In this paper, we leverage CPA to (approximately) manipulate singular values without computing singular values and vectors. The thresholding of singular values is expressed by a multiplication of certain matrices, which is derived from a characteristic of CPA. The multiplication is also efficiently computed using the sparsity of signals. As a result, the computational cost is significantly reduced. Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our method through several image processing applications based on matrix rank minimization with nuclear norm relaxation in terms of computation time and approximation precision.\nIndex Terms\nChebyshev polynomial approximation, nuclear norm relaxation, singular value thresholding\nI.

In such applications, the low-rank structure is incorporated into a minimization problem involving the rank function or its continuous relaxation. The problem is solved using some iterative algorithms, with which the thresholding of singular values is usually required at each iteration. We refer to this methodology as matrix rank minimization.\nThere are two representative approaches of matrix rank minimization. One is the exact method. It is an ideal formulation, but the resulting problem is very difficult to solve due to the non-convexity and combinatorial nature of the rank function. The other is the nuclear norm relaxation [22]. Since the nuclear norm, the sum of the singular values of a matrix, is the tightest convex relaxation of the rank function, we can efficiently solve the resulting problem via convex optimization techniques. Weighted nuclear norm relaxation [23], [24] has recently been proposed as a non-convex but continuous approximation of the rank function.\nEssentially, both of the above methods require the thresholding of singular values, which we call singular value shrinkage, at each iteration of certain optimization methods (Fig. 1). That is, most methods for matrix rank minimization must carry out singular value decomposition (SVD) many times. This is a serious problem in terms of computational cost when we handle large matrices, even with high-spec computers.\nSeveral methods have been proposed to tackle this issue [25]–[27]. The basic concept of [25], [26] is to approximately compute partial singular values and/or vectors. These methods can drastically reduce the computation time of singular value shrinkage but would not be suitable for the matrix rank minimization. Since the number of singular values above a threshold is not identified without the full decomposition, many singular values above a threshold are reduced to zero in each iteration. As a result, large approximation errors are produced, which results in an unstable convergence in the matrix rank minimization. With the other method [27], singular value shrinkage is carried out by computing neither singular values nor vectors, but the reduction in the computation time is still\nMay 22, 2017 DRAFT\n3 limited. This is because the method requires a complete orthogonal decomposition [28] and the calculation of the inverse of a large matrix. It also leads to large approximation errors, i.e., an unstable convergence in the matrix rank minimization. We consider a method similar to that by Cai and Osher [27]: We only need a “processed” matrix with thresholded singular values.\nIn this paper, we propose a fast singular value shrinkage method for reducing the computational cost in the matrix rank minimization of high dimensional matrices. Note that the proposed method computes neither singular values nor vectors during the process of singular value shrinkage, similar to the method by Cai and Osher [27]. Furthermore, our method maintains computational precision to lead matrix rank minimization algorithms to stable convergence. The two key tools of our method are described as follows.\n• Chebyshev polynomial approximation (CPA) [29]–[31]: This tool is often used for designing filters in signal\nprocessing [32], [33] and is a key tool for reducing computational cost. The applications of CPA have been studied by Saad et al. [34]–[37]. With the applications by Saad et al., CPA is used to calculate a vector after being transformed by a matrix with singular value shrinkage. That is, it requires the iterative multiplications of a matrix and vector to derive the Chebyshev polynomials. The concept of the applications has recently been used for improving the performance of image filtering methods such as bilateral filter, non-local means, and BM3D [38]–[40]. In contrast, we propose a method to obtain a matrix whose singular values are processed by using CPA. Since CPA results in truncation errors, such as ripples in the lower-order approximations, we also investigate the designs of thresholding functions and appropriate approximation order for reducing approximation errors. • Sparsity of signals: By using CPA, our method can represent singular value shrinkage as a multiplication\nof matrices. Since the multiplication can be computed efficiently when the matrices are sparse, our method exploits the inherent sparsity of signals in their frequency domain for further acceleration.\nSince matrix rank minimization plays a central role in various signal processing tasks, our method offers many promising applications. For this study, we validated the proposed method by using two image processing applications: image inpainting [12] and background modeling [14]–[18]. In these applications, target problems are formulated as convex optimization problems involving the nuclear norm so that they can be efficiently solved using the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) [41] with our method.\nAlthough the ADMM is widely known as a robust method for computation errors in each iteration, optimization methods (including the ADMM) with the other fast singular value shrinkage methods [25]–[27] do not converge well due to their large approximation errors. In contrast, our CPA-based singular value shrinkage method leads optimization methods to stable convergence. We validated this advantage experimentally by comparing our method with the other fast singular value shrinkage methods in several image processing tasks and a synthetic data.\nThe preliminary version of this study, without using signal sparsity, analysis of our method, and new applications,\nhas previously been published [42].\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II defines notations and preliminaries. We discuss our CPA-based singular value shrinkage method, which is the main contribution in this paper, in Section III. We discuss an\nMay 22, 2017 DRAFT\n4 approximation order of CPA for reducing the size of approximation errors in Section IV and verification of our method through applications in Section V. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section VI.\nII. NOTATIONS AND PRELIMINARIES"

The CPA is applied to H(B>B)x to quickly derive x̂ in [35]. In contrast, our method is focused on deriving the matrix in (16) itself. When the matrix, whose singular values are shrunk using CPA, is represented as BH(B>B), the explicit SVD of B can be avoided. However, deriving the matrix, not the vectors, usually requires enormous computation time because of multiplication of dense matrices. To accelerate the calculation, the sparseness of a matrix is exploited with our method, as indicated below.\nAssume that B is a matrix composed of an inherently sparse signal. Let T∈Rn×n be an arbitrary orthogonal matrix that efficiently sparsifies B, e.g., T is considered as the discrete Fourier transform [43], discrete cosine transform (DCT) [44], and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [45]. Note that the matrix T is the forward transform, i.e., when let y ∈ Rn be a column vector, the forward transform is represented as Ty. From the above, (14) is further rewritten with T as\nG(B) = BT>H(TB>BT>)T = BT>H(Φ)T, (18)\nwhere Φ := TB>BT> for simplicity. With the CPA-based eigenvalue shrinkage function Ĥ(·) in (6) and (11), H(Φ) in (18) is efficiently approximated as\nĤ(Φ) = TV diag ( ĥ(σ21), . . . , ĥ(σ 2 n) ) V>T>. (19)\nThe form of (19) enables us to use the sparsity of a signal in its frequency domain.\nFor further enhancing the sparsity of Φ, its components are thresholded as\nΦij = Φij if |Φij | ≥ ε,0 otherwise, (20) where Φij and Φij are the i-th row and j-th column of Φ and its truncated coefficient, and ε∈R is an arbitrary small value. We show that this truncation has little effect on the performance of our method and provides recommended settings of ε in Section V. As a result, the CPA-based eigenvalue shrinkage of Ĥ(Φ) is approximately given by\nĤ(Φ) ≈ Ĥ (Φ) .

It is clear that hard-shrinkage has a sharp transition band (see Fig. 3(a)); therefore, CPA, which is computed as a linear combination of cosine functions, may not approximate it well. In contrast, one can expect that a response that has a smooth transition band is suitable for CPA. To verify this numerically, the approximated responses were compared among hard-shrinkage, weighted soft-shrinkage, and soft-shrinkage. In this experiment, ρ=0.002 was used. For weighted soft-shrinkage, w(x)=0.5 and 1.5 were used.

Regarding the total computation times of Bricks and Office windows, our method with the 5th-order and 10th-order approximations was slower than with the 15th-order approximations.

      "text" : "The selections of a transform matrix T in (22) and a thresholding value ε in (20) affect computation time and size of approximation error. In this subsection, we indicate these effects experimentally by using the image inpainting method for Bricks. In all experiments, the 15th-order approximation was used for our method.\n1) Effects of Selected Transform Matrix: We compared the DWT with the DCT and the block diagonal forms of the DCT (block DCT) [32] whose block size was 8× 8 for indicating the differences among chosen transform matrices T in (22). The threshold values in (20) were fixed to ε = 250 for the DCTs. The other experimental conditions were the same as those discussed in Section V-C.\nThe results of the proposed method in Table III show the performance comparisons. Our method with the DWT is as fast as that with the block DCT in the total computation time, though the singular value shrinkage with our method with the DWT takes more time than the others. This is because the maximum iteration of our method with the DWT is only 83, whereas those of our method with the block DCT and DCT are 101 and 97, respectively. Therefore, the DWT leads our method to be stable convergence. However, our method with the DWT indicates a higher RMSE than the others since all the high frequency components were removed in it. The fact is not fatal\nMay 22, 2017 DRAFT\n19\nproblem because the images derived by using our method with the DWT were very similar to that of the exact one as shown in the previous section. Additionally, the block DCT can substantially sparsify an image compared to the DWT and DCT. Therefore, our method with the block DCT is faster than the others. In spite of fast computation, the results with the block DCT shows an RMSE as low as that of the DCT.\n2) Effects of Thresholding Value: When ε is an excessively large value, our method becomes fast but matrix rank minimization cannot converge well due to the errors w.r.t. the reduction in the number of components. For achieving the fast computation and stable convergence, we present a recommended guideline on the thresholding values.\nLet Et be an error at the t-th iteration of the ADMM, i.e., Et = ‖lt − lt−1‖/‖lt‖ from Appendix A-A and K(X, k) be a function that returns the k-th largest element in a matrix X, where K(X, k) is used as the threshold. Basically, when Et is a large value, a small k does not have any problem to decrease the error. In contrast, when Et is a small value, i.e., the optimization almost converges, k should be large for a stable convergence. For this purpose, we recommend the thresholding percentage for K(|Φ|, k) as\nε(Et) =  K ( |Φ|, (0.5×10−4)n2 ) if Et>E`, K ( |Φ|, (1.5×10−4)n2 ) if E`≥Et>Em, K ( |Φ|, (0.5×10−3)n2 ) otherwise,\n(35)\nwhere E` := 0.3×10−1 and Em := 6×10−4. This was determined experimentally. Recall that the size of Φ is n×n. To verify (35), it was compared with fixed threshold. Four values k1 = (0.5×10−4)n2, k2 = (1.5×10−4)n2, k3 = (0.5×10−3)n2, and k4 = n2 were used for this comparison, where k4 means that all components of a matrix are retained. Additionally, the DCT was exploited for the sparsifying matrix.\nThe results are listed in Table IV. The adaptive method was faster than the fixed method. Our method with k1 was the fastest but it did not converge well for the large size of approximation errors, where k1 is considered as the limitation of the thresholding percentage in our method. In addition, the singular value shrinkage of our CPA-based method by thresholding the matrix components was about five times faster than that by maintaining those."

To illustrate the advantage of our method, we compared it with the singular value shrinkage by using the exact PSVD, fast randomized singular value shrinkage (FRSVS) [25], singular value shrinkage by using the Nyström method (NSVS) [26], and the fast singular value shrinkage without the exact SVD (FSVS) [27]. The experiments were conducted using the image inpainting method for Bricks and a synthetic data. The synthetic data is constructed as a block diagonal matrix whose number of the main diagonal blocks is equal to its rank. Let D ∈ R1000×1000 be the matrix form of the synthetic data with rank n, and this is defined as D := J−blkdiag(Ds, n), where J := 110001>1000, Ds := 0.511000/n1>1000/n and blkdiag(Ds, n) := diag(Ds,Ds, . . . ,Ds︸ ︷︷ ︸\nn\n).

To restore the corrupted data, the optimization problem in (32) was solved without using the average term, i.e., ave ( vec(M) ) = ave ( vec(M∂) ) , because the matrices M and M∂ can hardly be defined for the random corruption. The function svdsechon11 was used for carrying out the exact PSVD, and the 500 largest singular values were calculated for Bricks. All preferences of the FRSVS [25] was determined in the original code12 provided by the authors. In the FRSVS, the 550 largest singular values were approximately derived for Bricks, whose number of singular values was experimentally determined for carrying out precise and fast singular value shrinkage. In addition, the 200 largest singular values were derived for the synthetic data in the exact PSVD and the FRSVS. The partial singular values derived in the exact PSVD and the FRSVS were soft-thresholded: The ith partial singular value σpi is shrunk to max(σpi − 1/ρ, 0). Since the Nyström method requires a square matrix to derive partial eigenvalues, it was applied to X>X, as in the EVD-based method. The 500 and 200 largest eigenvalues were calculated for the Bricks and the synthetic data, respectively. Those eigenvalues were then shrunk in the same way as with the EVD-based method, whose number of calculated eigenvalues was experimentally determined from the same reason as the FRSVS.

Note that the experiments of the existing methods were stopped at the 80th iterations since these methods did not converge. The concept of the FSVS is similar to our method, but it requires longer computation time as shown in Table III and does not converge. For the FRSVS and NSVS, although their average computation times are slightly less than ours, they result in much larger errors. This would be because many singular values or eigenvalues above the threshold 1/ρ were reduced to zero, so that the exact PSVD, FRSVS, and NSVS produced the large errors in each iteration leading to unstable convergence. In contrast, our method is stable and does not affect the convergence of the optimization method because the CPA-based method can shrink the entire singular values.\nFigure 9 shows the comparison of errors in the case of the synthetic data in several conditions according to the reduction rate of data elements and the matrix rank. The optimization methods using the existing methods do not converge well when the matrix rank is 500. This is because many singular values above 1/ρ are discarded, i.e., enormous computation errors are produced in each iteration. From the results, the matrix rank of target data should be estimated beforehand, and then the numbers of partial singular values and vectors should be estimated to be larger than the matrix rank, in order to make the optimization method converged. In contrast, our method can lead the optimization method to stable convergence. It certainly generates some approximation errors, but it can process all singular values, which means that most singular values above 1/ρ are remained.\nMay 22, 2017 DRAFT\n22"

Moreover, we studied the approximation order for reducing the size of approximation errors. The experimental results revealed that our method was much faster than the exact methods with high approximation precision in the case of a large data size.

Many signal processing problems require iterative application of singular value decomposition (SVD) for minimizing the rank of a given data matrix with other cost functions and/or constraints, which is called matrix rank minimization. In matrix rank minimization, singular values of a matrix are shrunk by hard-thresholding, softthresholding, or weighted soft-thresholding. However, the computational cost of SVD is generally too expensive to handle high dimensional signals such as images; hence, in this case, matrix rank minimization requires enormous computation time. In this paper, we leverage CPA to (approximately) manipulate singular values without computing singular values and vectors. The thresholding of singular values is expressed by a multiplication of certain matrices, which is derived from a characteristic of CPA. The multiplication is also efficiently computed using the sparsity of signals. As a result, the computational cost is significantly reduced. Experimental results suggest the effectiveness of our method through several image processing applications based on matrix rank minimization with nuclear norm relaxation in terms of computation time and approximation precision.",
