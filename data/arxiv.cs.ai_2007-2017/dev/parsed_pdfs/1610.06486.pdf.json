      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nMathematical forecasting of data sequences (time series) is nowadays well studied and there is a large number of publications on this topic. There are many methods for solving this task: regression, correlation, spectral analysis, exponential smoothing, etc., and more advanced intellectual systems that sometimes require rather complicated mathematical methods and high user’s qualification. The problem becomes more complicated when analyzed time series are non-stationary and nonlinear and contain unknown behavior trends, quasiperiodic, stochastic and chaotic components. The best results are shown by nonlinear forecasting models based on mathematical methods of computational intelligence [1-3], and, first of all, neuro-fuzzy systems [4-5] due to their approximating and extrapolating properties, learning abilities, transparency and results’ interpretability. The models to be especially noted are the so-called NARX-models [6] which have the form\n          ˆ 1 , ..., , 1 , ...,y xy k f y k y k n x k x k n     (1) where  ŷ k is an estimate of forecasted time series at discrete time 1, 2, ...k  ;  f  stands for a certain nonlinear transformation implemented by a neuro-fuzzy system,  x k is an observed exogenous factor that defines a behavior of  y k . It can be noticed that popular Box–Jenkins AR-, ARX-, ARMAX-models as well as nonlinear NARMAmodels can be described by the expression (1). These models have been widely studied; there are many architectures and learning algorithms that implement these models, but it is assumed that models’ orders yn , xn are given a priori. These orders are previously unknown in a case of structural non-stationarity for analyzed time series, and they also have to be adjusted during a learning procedure. In this case, it makes sense to use evolving connectionist systems [7-10] that adjust not only their synaptic weights and activation-membership functions, but also their architectures. There are many algorithms that implement these learning methods both in a batch mode and in a sequential mode. The problem becomes more complicated if data are fed to the system with high frequency in the form of a data stream [11]. Here, the most popular evolving systems turn out to be too cumbersome for learning and information processing in an online mode.\nAs an alternative, a rather simple and effective architecture can be considered. It’s the so-called ANARX-model (Additive NARX) that has the form [12, 13]\n           \n          1 2\n1\nˆ 1 , 1 2 , 2 ...\n... , , n\nn l l\ny k f y k x k f y k x k\nf y k n x k n f y k l x k l \n      \n      (2)\n(here  max ,y xn n n ), an original task of the forecasting system’s synthesis is decomposed into many local tasks of parametric identification for node models with two input variables  y k l ,  x k l , 1, 2, ..., , ...l n .\nAuthors [12, 13] used elementary Rosenblatt perceptrons with sigmoidal activation functions as such nodes. The ANARX-model provided high forecasting quality, but generally speaking it requires a large number of nodes in its architecture [14].\nSome synthesis problems of forecasting neuro-fuzzy [15] and neo-fuzzy [15-17] systems based on the ANARXmodels are considered in this work. These systems avoid the above mentioned drawbacks.\nSince we consider a case of stochastic nonlinear dynamic signals in this article, the basic novelty has to do with defining a model’s delay order in an online mode.\nII. A NEURO-FUZZY-ANARX-MODEL An architecture of the ANARX-model is shown in Fig.1. It is formed by two lines of time delay elements 1z     1 1z y k y k   and n nodes [ ]lN which are simultaneously learned. These nodes are tuned independently\nfrom each other. And adding new nodes or removing unnecessary ones doesn’t have any influence on other neurons, i.e. the evolving process for this system is implemented by changing a number of the nodes.\nIt’s recommended to use a neuron with two inputs (its architecture is shown in Fig.2) as a node of this system instead of the elementary Rosenblatt perceptron.\nAs one can see, this node is the Wang–Mendel neuro-fuzzy system [18] with two inputs. It possesses universal approximation capabilities and is actually the zero-order Takagi–Sugeno–Kang system [19, 20]. A two-dimensional vector of input signals       T,lz k y k l x k l   is fed to an input of the node [ ]lN , 1, 2, ..., , ...l n . The first layer contains 2h membership functions   iy y k l  ,   ix x k l  and fulfills fuzzification of the input variables by calculating membership levels   0 1iy y k l   ,   0 1ix x k l   . The Gaussian functions can be used as membership functions\n      2\n2exp 2 iy\niy iy\ny k l c y k l\n           ,\n      2\n2exp 2 ix\nix ix\nx k l c x k l\n          \n(here iyc , ixc stand for parameters that define centers of these membership functions; iy , ix are width parameters) or other bell-shaped functions with infinite support for avoiding “gaps” which appear in the fuzzified space.\nThe second layer of the node provides aggregation of the membership levels that were computed in the first layer. Outputs of the second layer form h aggregated signals\n       li iy ixz k y k l x k l    . The third layer contains synaptic weights that are adjusted during a learning procedure. Outputs of the third layer\nare values        l l li iy ix i iw y k l x k l w z k     .\nThe fourth layer is formed by two summation units and calculates sums of the output signals in the second and the third layers correspondingly. Outputs of the fourth layer are signals\n       \n        1 1 1 1\n,\n.\nh h l l l i iy ix i i\ni i h h\nl iy ix i\ni i\nw y k l x k l w z k\ny k l x k l z k\n \n \n \n \n               \nDefuzzification (normalization) is implemented in the fifth (output) layer. Finally, the output signal of the node       ˆ ,l ly k f y k l x k l   is computed:\n       \n       \n     \n1\n1\nT\n1 1\n1\nˆ\nh l i iy ix\nl i h\niy ix i lh h il l l l l\ni i ih li i i\ni\nw y k l x k l y k\ny k l x k l\nz k w w k w k\nz k\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n   \n \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere         T1 2, , ...,l l l lhk k k k    ,       1\n1\nh l l l i i i\ni k z k z k\n\n\n         ,  T1 2, , ...,l l l lhw w w w .\nConsidering that the output signal  ˆ ly k of each node depends linearly on the adjusted synaptic weights liw , one can use conventional algorithms of adaptive linear identification [21] for their tuning which are based on the quadratic learning criterion.\nIf a training data set is non-stationary [22], one can use either the exponentially weighted recurrent least squares method\n              \n                 \n     \n1\n1 1 ,\n1\n1\n1 1 , 0 1,\n1\nl l\nl lT l l\nlT l l\nl l\nl l lT l\nlT l l\nw k w k\nk y k w k k k\nk k k\nk k\nk k k k k k k\n \n  \n  \n  \n                            \n(3)\nor the Kaczmarz–Widrow–Hoff optimal gradient algorithm (in a case of the “rapid” non-stationarity)\n               1 1 lT l l l l lT l y k w k k w k w k k k k          . (4)\nIn fact, it is possible to tune 4h membership functions’ parameters iyc , ixc , iy , ix of each node, but taking\ninto consideration the fact that the signal  ˆ ly k depends nonlinearly on these parameters, a learning speed can’t be sufficient for non-stationary conditions in this case.\nIII. A NEO-FUZZY-ANARX-MODEL\nIf a large data set to be processed is given (within the “Big Data” conception [23] when data processing speed and computational simplicity come to the forefront, it seems reasonable to use neo-fuzzy neurons that were proposed by T. Yamakawa and his co-authors [15-17] instead of the neuro-fuzzy nodes in the ANARX-model. An architecture of the neo-fuzzy neuron as a node of the ANARX-model is shown in Fig.3. The neo-fuzzy neuron’s advantages are a high learning speed, computational simplicity, good approximating properties and abilities to find a global minimum of a learning criterion in an online mode.\nStructural elements of the neo-fuzzy neuron are nonlinear synapses yNS , xNS that implement the zero order\nTakagi–Sugeno fuzzy inference, but it’s easy to notice that the neo-fuzzy neuron is much simpler constructively than the neuro-fuzzy node shown in Fig.2.\nAn output value of this node is formed with the help of input signals  y k l ,  x k l\n        \n   1\n1\nˆ h\nl l l l y x iy iy\ni h\nl ix ix\ni\ny k k k w y k l\nw x k l\n  \n\n\n\n    \n \n\n (5)\nand an output signal of the ANARX-model can be written down in the form\n        1 1 1\nˆ n h h\nl l iy iy ix ix l i i y k w y k l w x k l    \n      \n     ,\nwhich means that since the neo-fuzzy neuron is also an additive model [24], the ANARX-model based on the neofuzzy neurons is twice additive.\nTriangular membership functions are usually used in the neo-fuzzy neuron. They meet the unity partitioning conditions\n   1\n1 h\niy i y k l    ,    1\n1 h\nix i x k l    , which make it possible to simplify the node’s architecture by excluding the normalization layer from it.\nIt was proposed to use B-splines as membership functions for the neo-fuzzy neuron [25]. They provide a higher approximation quality and also meet the unity partitioning conditions. A B-spline of the q  th order can be written down:\n  \n \n    \n    \n1,\n1\n1,\n, 1 1,\n, 1,\n1, if , for 1 0 otherwise\n, for 1\n1, ..., ,\niy i y\niy q iy\ni q y iyq iy\ni q y q i y\ni q y i y\nc y k l c q\ny k l c y k l\nc c y k l\nc y k l y k l q\nc c\ni h q\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n \n            \n    \n            \n  \n \n    \n    \n1,\n1\n1,\n, 1 1,\n, 1,\n1, if , for 1 0 otherwise\n, for 1\n1, ..., .\nix i x\nix q ix\ni q x ixq ix\ni q x q i x\ni q x i x\nc x k l c q\nx k l c x k l\nc c x k l\nc x k l x k l q\nc c\ni h q\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n \n            \n    \n            \nIt should be mentioned that B-splines are a sort of generalized membership functions: when 2q  one gets traditional triangular membership functions; when 4q  one gets cubic splines, etc.\nIntroducing a vector of variables               T1 1, ..., , , ...,l y hy x hxk y k l y k l x k l x k l         ,  T1 1, ..., , , ...,l l l l ly hy x hxw w w w w , the expression (5) can be rewritten in the form    Tˆ l l ly k w k .\nEither the algorithms (3), (4) or the procedure [26]                        1 T T 1 1 1 , 0 1, l l l l l l l l l l w k w k r k y k w k k k r k r k k k                   (6)\ncan be used for the neo-fuzzy neuron’s learning. This procedure possesses both filtering and tracking properties. It should also be noticed that when 1  the equation (6) coincides completely with the Kaczmarz–Widrow–Hoff optimal algorithm (4).\nEvolving systems based on the neo-fuzzy neurons demonstrated its effectiveness for solving different tasks (especially forecasting tasks [25-30]). The twice additive system is the most appropriate choice for data processing in Data Stream Mining tasks [11] from a point of view of implementation simplicity and a processing speed.\nIV. A WEIGHTED NEURO-NEO-FUZZY-ANARX-MODEL Considering that every node [ ]lN of the ANARX-model is tuned independently from each other and represents\nan individual neuro(neo)-fuzzy system, it is possible to use a combination of neural networks’ ensembles [31] in order to improve a forecasting quality. This approach results in an architecture of a weighted neuro-neo-fuzzyANARX-model (Fig.4).\nAn output signal of the system can be written in the form\n     T 1\nˆˆ ˆ n\nl l l y k c y k c y k \n  \nwhere         T1 2ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ, , ..., ny k y k y k y k ,  T1 2, , ..., nc c c c is a vector of adjusted weight coefficients that define proximity of the signals  ˆ ly k to the forecasted process  y k and meet the unbiasedness condition\nT\n1 1\nn\nl n l c c I   \nwhere nI is a  1n -vector of unities. The method of undetermined Lagrange multipliers can be used for finding the vector с in a batch mode. So, a\nsequence of forecasting errors\n                    \nT T T\nT T\nˆ ˆˆ ˆ n\nn\nv k y k y k y k c y k c I y k c y k\nc I y k y k c V k\n      \n  \n \n ,\nthe Lagrange function        \n \nT T T\nT T\n, 1\n1\nn k\nn\nL c c V k V k c c I\nc Rc c I\n \n\n   \n  \n (7)\n(here  is an undetermined Lagrange multiplier,    T k R V k V k  stands for an error correlation matrix) and the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker system of equations\n  T , 2 0,\n1 0\nс n\nn\nL c Rc I L c I            \n\n(8)\nare introduced. A solution of the system (8) can be written down in the form\n  11 T 1 T 1 ,\n2\nn n n\nn n\nc R I I R I\nI R I\n \n      \n(9)\nwhere a value of the Lagrange function (7) at the saddle point is\n    1T 1* , n nL c I R I  .\nAn implementation procedure of the algorithm (9) can meet some problems in a case of data processing in an online mode and high level of correlation between the signals  ˆ ly k that leads to the ill-conditioned matrix R which has to be inverted at every time step k .\nThe Lagrange function (7) can be written down in the form\n        2T Tˆ, 1n k L c y k c y k c I      and a gradient algorithm for finding its saddle point based on the Arrow–Hurwicz procedure [27, 32] can be written in the form\n       \n       \n1 , ,\n, 1\nc cc k c k k L c\nL c k k k\n \n   \n\n          \nor      \n                      \n        \nT\nT\n1\nˆ ˆ2 1 1\nˆ1 2 1 ,\n1 1\nc\nn\nc n\nn\nc k c k k\ny k c k y k y k k I\nc k k v k y k k I\nk k k c k I\n\n\n \n  \n                               \n(10)\nwhere  c k ,  k are learning rate parameters. The Arrow–Hurwicz procedure converges to the saddle point with rather general assumptions on the values  c k ,  k , but these parameters can be optimized to speed up the learning process as that is particularly\nimportant in Data Stream Mining tasks.

EXPERIMENTS In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed system, a number of experiments should be carried out."

Prediction results of the ANARX and weighted ANARX\nsystems are in Fig.5 and Fig.6 correspondingly (signal values are marked with a blue color; prediction values are marked with a magenta color; and prediction errors are marked with a grey line).\nWe used for comparison multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), radial-basis function neural networks (RBFNs), ANFIS and two proposed systems ANARX and weighted ANARX (both based on neo-fuzzy nodes). Since MLP can’t work in an online mode, it processed data in two different modes. It had just one epoch in the first case (something similar to an online case), and it had 5 epochs in the second case (the MLP architecture had almost the same number of adjustable parameters when compared to the proposed systems). A number of MLP inputs was equal to 4 and a number of hidden nodes was equal to 7 in both cases. A total number of parameters to be tuned was 43 in both modes. It took about two times more time to compute the result in the second case but prediction quality was like almost two times higher. MLP (case 2) demonstrated the best result in this experiment.\nSpeaking of RBFNs, we also had two cases. The first-case RBFN was taken really close in the sense of parameters’ number to our systems and the second-case RBFN’s architecture was chosen to show the best performance. In the first case, RBFN had 3 inputs and 7 kernel functions. In the second case, it had 3 inputs as well but 12 kernel functions which generally led to higher prediction quality (+30% precision compared to RBFN in the first case) but took longer to compute the result. A number of parameters to be tuned was 36 in the first case and 61 in the second case.\nANFIS showed one of the best prediction qualities in this experiment. It had 4 inputs, 55 nodes and it was processing data during 5 epochs. It contained 80 parameters to be tuned.\nThe proposed ANARX system based on neo-fuzzy nodes had 2 inputs, 2 nodes, 9 membership functions, and its  parameter was equal to 0.62.
