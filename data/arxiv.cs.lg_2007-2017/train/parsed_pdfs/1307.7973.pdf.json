      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Information extraction (IE) aims at generating structured data from free text in order to populate Knowledge Bases (KBs). Hence, one is given an incomplete KB composed of a set of triples of the form (h, r , t); h is the left-hand side entity (or head), t the right-hand side entity (or tail) and r the relationship linking them. An example from the Freebase KB1 is (/m/2d3rf ,<director-of>, /m/3/324), where /m/2d3rf refers to the director “Alfred Hitchcock\" and /m/3/324 to the movie “The Birds\".\nThis paper focuses on the problem of learning to perform relation extraction (RE) under weak supervision from a KB. RE is sub-task of IE that considers that entities have already been detected by a different process, such as a named-entity recognizer. RE then aims at assigning to a relation mention m\n1www.freebase.com\n(i.e. a sequence of text which states that some relation is true) the corresponding relationship from the KB, given a pair of extracted entities (h, t) as context. For example, given the triplet (/m/2d3rf ,“wrote and directed\", /m/3/324), a system should predict <director-of>. The task is said to be weakly supervised because for each pair of entities (h, t) detected in the text, all relation mentions m associated with them are labeled with all the relationships connecting h and t in the KB, whether they are actually expressed by m or not.\nOur key contribution is a novel model that employs not only weakly labeled text mention data, as most approaches do, but also leverages triples from the known KB. The model thus learns the plausibility of new (h, r , t) triples by generalizing from the KB, even though this triple is not present. A ranking-based embedding framework is used to train such a model. Thereby, relation mentions, entities and relationships are all embedded into a common low-dimensional vector space, where scores are computed. We show that our system can successfully take into account information from a largescale KB (Freebase: 4M entities, 23k relationships) to improve over existing systems, which are only using text features.\nPrevious work Learning under weak supervision is common in Natural language processing, especially for tasks where the annotations costs are important such as semantic parsing (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Liang et al., 2009; Bordes et al., 2010; Matuszek et al., 2012). This is also naturally used in IE, since it allows to train large-scale systems without requiring to la-\nbel numerous texts. The idea was introduced by (Craven et al., 1999), which matched the Yeast Protein Database with PubMed abstracts. It was also used to train open extractors based on Wikipedia infoboxes and corresponding sentences (Wu and Weld, 2007; Wu and Weld, 2010). Large-scale open IE projects (Banko et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010) also rely on weak supervision, since they learn models from a seed KB in order to extend it.\nWeak supervision is also a popular option for RE: Mintz et al. (2009) used Freebase to train weakly supervised relational extractors on Wikipedia, an approach generalized by the multiinstance learning frameworks (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012). All these works only use textual information to perform extraction.\nRecently, Riedel et al. (2013) proposed an approach to model jointly KB data and text by relying on collaborative filtering. Unlike our model, this method can not directly connect text mentions and KB relationships, but does it indirectly through joint learning of shared embeddings for entities in text and in the KB. We did not compare with this recent approach, since it uses a different evaluation protocol than previous work in RE."

      "heading" : "2 Embedding-based Framework",
      "text" : "Our work concerns energy-based methods, which learn low-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) of atomic symbols (words, entities, relationships, etc.). In this framework, we learn two models: one for predicting relationships given relation mentions and another one to encode the interactions among entities and relationships from the KB. The joint action of both models in prediction allows us to use the connection between the KB and text to perform relation extraction. One could also share parameters between models (via shared embeddings), but this is not implemented in this work. This approach is inspired by previous work designed to connect words and Wordnet (Bordes et al., 2012).\nBoth submodels end up learning vector embeddings of symbols, either for entities or relationships in the KB, or for each word/feature of the vocabulary (denoted V). The set of entities and relationships in the KB are denoted by E and R, and nv , ne and nr\ndenote the size of V , E and R respectively. Given a triplet (h, r , t) the embeddings of the entities and the relationship (vectors in Rk ) are denoted with the same letter, in boldface characters (i.e. h, r, t)."

      "heading" : "2.1 Connecting text and relationships",
      "text" : "The first part of the framework concerns the learning of a function Sm2r (m, r), based on embeddings, that is designed to score the similarity of a relation mention m and a relationship r .\nOur approach is inspired by previous work for connecting word labels and images (Weston et al., 2010), which we adapted, replacing images by mentions and word labels by relationships. Intuitively, it consists of first projecting windows of words into the embedding space and then computing a similarity measure (the dot product in this paper) between this projection and a relationship embedding. The scoring function is then:\nSm2r (m, r) = f(m) ⊤ r\nwith f a function mapping a window of words into R k , f(m) = W⊤Φ(m); W is the matrix of Rnv×k containing all word embeddings w; Φ(m) is the (sparse) binary representation of m (∈ Rnv ) and r ∈ Rk is the embedding of the relationship r .\nThis approach can be easily applied at test time to score (mention, relationship) pairs. Since this learning problem is weakly supervised, Bordes et al. (2010) showed that a convenient way to train it is by using a ranking loss. Hence, given a data set D = {(mi , ri ), i = 1, ... , |D|} consisting of (mention, relationship) training pairs, one could learn the embeddings using constraints of the form:\n∀i , ∀r ′ 6= ri , f(mi ) ⊤ ri > 1 + f(mi ) ⊤ r ′ , (1)\nwhere 1 is the margin. Given any mention m one can predict the corresponding relationship r̂(m) with:\nr̂(m) = arg max r ′∈R\nSm2r (m, r ′) = arg max\nr ′∈R\n( f(m)⊤r′ ) .\nLearning Sm2r (·) under constraints (1) is well suited when one is interested in building a a permention prediction system. However, performance metrics of relation extraction are sometimes measured using precision recall curves aggregated for all mentions concerning the same pair of entities,\nas in (Riedel et al., 2010). In that case the scores across predictions for different mentions need to be calibrated so that the most confident ones have the higher scores. This can be better encoded with constraints of the following form:\n∀i , j , ∀r ′ 6= ri , f(mi ) ⊤ ri > 1 + f(mj) ⊤ r ′ .\nIn this setup, scores of pairs observed in the training set should be larger than that of any other prediction across all mentions. In practice, we use “soft” ranking constraints (optimizing the hinge loss), and enforce a (hard) constraint on the norms of the columns of W and r, i.e. ∀i , ||Wi ||2 ≤ 1 and ∀j , ||rj ||2 ≤ 1. Training is carried out by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), updating W and r at each step. See (Weston et al., 2010; Bordes et al., 2013) for details."

      "heading" : "2.2 Encoding structured data of KBs",
      "text" : "Using only weakly labeled text mentions for training ignores much of the prior knowledge we can leverage from a large KB such as Freebase. In order to connect this relational data with our model, we propose to encode its information into entity and relationship embeddings. This allows us to build a model which can score the plausibility of new entity relationship triples which are missing from Freebase. Several models have been recently developed for that purpose (e.g. in (Nickel et al., 2011; Bordes et al., 2011; Bordes et al., 2012)): we chose in this work to use the approach of (Bordes et al., 2013), which is simple, flexible and has shown very promising results on Freebase data.\nGiven a training set S = {(hi , ri , ti ), i = 1, ... , |S|} of relations extracted from the KB, this model learns vector embeddings of the entities and of the relationships using the idea that the functional relation induced by the r -labeled arcs of the KB should correspond to a translation of the embeddings. Hence, this method enforces that h + r ≈ t when (h, r , t) holds, while h+ r should be far away from t otherwise. Hence such a model gives the following score for the plausibility of a relation:\nSkb(h, r , t) = −||h+ r− t|| 2 2 .\nA ranking loss is also used for training Skb. The ranking objective is designed to assign higher scores\nto existing relations versus any other possibility:\n∀i , ∀h′ 6= hi , Skb(hi , ri , ti ) ≥ 1 + Skb(h ′, ri , ti), ∀i , ∀r ′ 6= ri , Skb(hi , ri , ti ) ≥ 1 + Skb(hi , r ′, ti ), ∀i , ∀t ′ 6= ti , Skb(hi , ri , ti ) ≥ 1 + Skb(hi , ri , t ′).\nAs in section 2.1 we use soft constraints, enforce constraints on the norm of embeddings, i.e. ∀h,r ,t , ||h||2 ≤ 1, ||r ||2 ≤ 1, ||t||2 ≤ 1, and training is performed using SGD, as in (Bordes et al., 2013).\nAt test time, one may again need to calibrate the scores Skb across entity pairs. We propose a simple approach: we convert the scores by ranking all relationships R by Skb and instead output:\nS̃kb(h, r , t) = Φ (\n∑\nr ′ 6=r\nδ(Skb(h, r , t) > Skb(h, r ′, t))\n)\n,\ni.e. a function of the rank of r . We chose the simplified model Φ(x) = 1 if x < t and 0 otherwise."

      "heading" : "2.3 Implementation for relation extraction",
      "text" : "Our framework can be used for relation extraction in the following way. First, for each pair of entities (h, t) that appear in the test set, all the corresponding mentions Mh,t in the test set are collected and a prediction is performed with:\nr̂h,t = argmax r∈R\n∑\nm∈Mh,t\nSm2r (m, r) .\nThe predicted relationship can either be a valid relationship or NA – a marker that means that there is no relation between h and t (NA is added to R during training and is treated like other relationships). If r̂h,t is a relationship, a composite score is defined:\nSm2r+kb(h, r̂h,t , t)= ∑\nm∈Mh,t\nSm2r (m, r̂h,t)+S̃kb(h, r̂h,t , t)\nHence, the composite model favors predictions that agree with both the mentions and the KB. If r̂h,t is NA, the score is unchanged."

      "text" : "We use the training and test data, evaluation framework and baselines from (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012).\nNYT+FB This dataset, developed by (Riedel et al., 2010), aligns Freebase relations with the New York Times corpus. Entities were found using the Stanford named entity tagger (Finkel et al., 2005), and were matched to their name in Freebase. For each mention, sentence level features are extracted which include part of speech, named entity and dependency tree path properties. Unlike some of the previous methods, we do not use features that aggregate properties across multiple mentions. We kept the 100,000 most frequent features.There are 52 possible relationships and 121,034 training mentions of which most are labeled as no relation (labeled “NA”) – there are 4700 Freebase relations mentioned in the training set, and 1950 in the test set.\nFreebase Freebase is a large-scale KB that has around 80M entities, 23k relationships and 1.2B relations. We used a subset restricted to the top 4M entities (with the largest number of relations in a preprocessed subset) for scalability reasons. We used all the 23k relationships. To make a realistic setting, we did not choose the entity set using the NYT+FB data set, so it may not overlap completely. For that reason, we needed to keep the set rather large. Keeping the top 4M entities gives an overlap of 80% with the entities in the NYT+FB test set. Most importantly, we then removed all the entity pairs present in the NYT+FB test set from Freebase, i.e. all relations they are involved in independent of the relationship. This ensures that we cannot just memorize the true relations for an entity pair – we have to learn to generalize from other entities and relations.\nAs the NYT+FB dataset was built on an earlier version of Freebase we also had to translate the deprecated relationships into their new variants (e.g. “/p/business/company/place_founded ” → “/organization/organization/place_founded”) to make the two datasets link (the 52 relationships in NYT+FB are now a subset of the 23k from Freebase). We then trained the Skb model on the remaining triples.\nModeling Following (Bordes et al., 2013) we set the embedding dimension k to 50. The learning rate for SGD was selected using a validation set: we obtained 0.001 for Sm2r , and 0.1 for Skb. For the calibration of Ŝkb, t = 10 (note, here we are ranking all 23k Freebase relationships). Training Sm2r took\n5 minutes, whilst training Skb took 2 days due to the large scale of the data set.\nResults Figure 1 displays the aggregate precision / recall curves of our approach WSABIEM2R+FB which uses the combination of Sm2r+Skb, as well as WSABIEM2R , which only uses Sm2r , and state-ofthe-art: HOFFMANN (Hoffmann et al., 2011)2, MIMLRE (Surdeanu et al., 2012). RIEDEL (Riedel et al., 2010) and MINTZ (Mintz et al., 2009).\nWSABIEM2R is comparable to, but slightly worse than, the MIMLRE and HOFFMANN methods, possibly due to its simplified assumptions (e.g. predicting a single relationship per entity pair). However, the addition of extra knowledge from other Freebase\n2There is an error in the plot from (Hoffmann et al., 2011), which we have corrected. The authors acknowledged the issue.\nentities in WSABIEM2R+FB provides superior performance to all other methods, by a wide margin, at least between 0 and 0.1 recall (see bottom plot)."
