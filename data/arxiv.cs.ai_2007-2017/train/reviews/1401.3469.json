Here we focus on permutations of the variables consisting of one single cycle. We propose a procedure that takes advantage of these symmetries by interacting with a continuous constraint solver without interfering with it. A key concept in this procedure are the classes of symmetric boxes formed by bisecting a n-dimensional cube at the same point in all dimensions at the same time. We analyze these classes and quantify them as a function of the cube dimensionality. Moreover, we propose a simple algorithm to generate the representatives of all these classes for any number of variables at very high rates. A problem example from the chemical and#64257;eld and the cyclic n-roots problem are used to show the performance of the approach in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:27:27 GMT  (388kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3469v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vicente ruiz de angulo", "carme torras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3469"}
