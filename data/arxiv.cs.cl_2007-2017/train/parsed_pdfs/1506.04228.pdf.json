      "text" : "Lemmatization is a fundamental natural language processing (NLP) task which automates the process of word normalization. The correct identification of the normalized form of a word is of particular importance for several other NLP tasks and can improve the accuracy of tasks like information extraction and information retrieval. The implementation of a lemmatizer can be a challenging task, especially in cases of highly inflectional languages such as the Bulgarian language. For example, the Bulgarian adjective 'рядък' râdǎk - 'rare') has 9 inflected word forms (Table 1).\nFaculty of Mathematics & Natural Sciences – FMNS 2015\nрядко râdko neuter singular indefinite no\nрядкото râdkoto neuter singular definite no\nредки redki – plural indefinite no\nредките redkite – plural definite no\nредки redki masculine singular – yes"

      "heading" : "2. IMPLEMENTATION",
      "text" : "The BGLemmatizer package is part of the BGLangTools project. For the implementation of the BGLemmatizer, we decided to reuse freely available lexical resources. We focused on two projects - BG Office1 and Bulgarianlanguage Wiktionary2. We implemented support in BGLangTools for automatic retrieval of all lemmas provided by these projects and automatic word form generation for the lemmas having inflected forms.\nThe word forms of lexemes are generated by means of inflectional paradigms. In the Bulgarian language there are 187 inflectional paradigms (types), which cover almost all words with inflected forms [2]. To inflect all word forms of a lemma, we only need to know the inflectional paradigm to which the lemma belongs. In a nutshell, we need to know the lemma type. For example, to retrieve a list of all word forms of the Bulgarian adjective 'рядък' (<i>râdǎk</i> - 'rare'), which is of type \"83\", we will use the following code:\nWordEntry[] forms;\nforms = BgWordFormGenerator.generateWordForms(\"рядък\", \"83\");\nSince BG Office and Bulgarian-language Wiktionary projects are work in progress and it is expected that the provided lexical resources will grow in time, BGLangTools provides an option to scan the projects data and import the newly added lemmas in its database. Currently, the dictionary contains 65 376 lemmas and 1 017 595 inflected forms. The number of inflected forms will grow, because at the time this paper was written the inflection of verbs has been partially implemented - only the most frequently used word forms could be generated. Note that in the Bulgarian language a verb can have up to 2000 word forms [3].\nMost of the currently available part-of-speech (POS) taggers for Bulgarian use the BulTreeBank tagset (BTB-TS) scheme [4] to annotate words with POS tags. For efficiency reasons, in BGLangTools the grammatical information about a word entry is stored in a 32-bit integer, but\n1 http://bgoffice.sourceforge.net 2 http://bg.wiktionary.org\nfor interoperability purposes, we implemented support for converting a BTBTS POS tag to a 32-bit integer value and vice versa.\n2.1. Retrieving a list of lemmas from the BG Office project\nThe goal of the BG Office project is to add spell check support for Bulgarian in various open source projects like OpenOffice (openoffice.org) and Mozilla (mozilla.org). BG Office provides software packages for developers1, which contain lexical resources for Bulgarian, where the lemmas are sorted according to inflectional type and stored in separate files.\nIn the latest version (4.1) of the developers package the lexical resources are located in the 'data' directory. In this directory and its sub-directories, there are several files with .dat extension whose names start with 'bg', followed by a number and an optional one-letter suffix. The number with the optional suffix designates the inflectional type of the lemmas contained in the file.\nBGLangTools provides support for retrieval of all lemmas from a BG Office developers package. For every lemma the corresponding inflectional forms are generated and added to the dictionary. This can be done by means of the following code:\nString bgofficePath = \"/packages/bgoffice-4.1/\";\nBgDictionary dict = new BgDictionary();\nBgOfficeScanner.getInstance().scan(bgofficePath, dict);\nThe bgofficePath variable specifies the absolute path to the top level directory of the BG Office package.\n2.2. Retrieving a list of lemmas from the Bulgarian-language Wiktionary project\nThe goal of the Wiktionary project is to provide a complete international dictionary under a free license. The backup dumps of the content are available for free download2.\nThe support for processing the Bulgarian-language Wiktionary dump file3 is implemented in BGLangTools by using the Bliki engine4. The following code can be used to process the specified dump file, retrieve all lemmas, generate the corresponding inflectional forms and import them to the specified dictionary:\n1 http://sourceforge.net/projects/bgoffice/files/For%20Developers/ 2 http://dumps.wikimedia.org/ 3 http://dumps.wikimedia.org/bgwiktionary/latest/bgwiktionary-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2 4 https://code.google.com/p/gwtwiki/\nFaculty of Mathematics & Natural Sciences – FMNS 2015\nString dump;\ndump = \"/dumps/bgwiktionary-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2\";\nBgDictionary dict = new BgDictionary();\nBgWiktionaryScanner.getInstance().scan(dump, dict);\nThe dump variable specifies the absolute path to the Wiktionary dump file.\n2.3. Using the built-in dictionary\nAt the time this article was written, BGLangTools kept in internal format 1 082 971 tokens, retrieved from the BG Office project and the Bulgarianlanguage Wiktionary project. In order to load the internally stored tokens with their grammatical information, one can use the following code:\nBgDictionary dict = BGLangTools.loadBuiltinDictionary();"

      "text" : "GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering) is a mature language processing framework capable of handling various text processing tasks1. It is an open source project with over 15 years of development. We implemented support for running BGLemmatizer as GATE plugin.\nPart-of-speech information is required for every token so that the BGLemmatizer plugin can work properly. This information can be automatically obtained by POS taggers like the LingPipe POS tagger, which is also available as GATE plugin. An example configuration of the BGLemmatizer plugin is shown in Figure 1, where the plugin is configured to retrieve the POS tag of a token from the 'category' feature of the 'Token' annotation and to set the resulting lemma as a 'lemma' feature in the same annotation.\n1 http://gate.ac.uk/"

      "text" : "We plan to integrate the BGLemmatizer with other linguistic software tools. One of our aims is to achieve better results and accuracy of part-ofspeech annotation of Bulgarian texts with high levels of grammatical errors, which is the case with texts written by people learning Bulgarian as a foreign language. Further, we plan to extend BGLangTools with APIs, which will be useful in the fields of automatic text generation and information extraction."
