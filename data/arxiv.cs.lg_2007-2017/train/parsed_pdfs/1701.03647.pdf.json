      "text" : "Hinton and Sejnowski[1] proposed a learning algorithm for general Boltzmann machine which has hidden-to-hidden and visible-to-visible connections, but in practice it was too slow to be used. Then, the restricted Blotzmann machine (RBM) was proposed by[2] in 1986, which has no lateral connections among nodes in each layer, so the learning procedure becomes much more efficient than general Blotzmann machine. There has been extensive research into the RBM since Hinton proposed fast learning algorithms[3],\nJielei Chu, Hongjun Wang, Hua Meng and Tianrui Li are with the School of Information Science and Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 611756, Sichuan, China. e-mail: jieleichu@home.swjtu.edu.cn, wanghongjun@swjtu.edu.cn, huameng@swjtu.edu.cn, trli@swjtu.edu.cn. Peng Jin is with the School of Computer Science, Leshan Normal University, 614000, Leshan, China. e-mail: jandp@pku.edu.cn\n[4] by contrastive divergence (CD) learning algorithm. Several power and tractability deep networks was proposed, including deep belief networks[5], deep autoencoder[6], deep Boltzmann machine[7], deep dropout neural net[8]. Until now, a large number of successful applications built on the RBMs have appeared, e.g., classification[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], feature learning[14], facial recognition[15], collaborative filtering[16], topic modelling[17], speech recognition[18], natural language understanding[19], computer vision[20], dimensionality reduction[21], voice conversion[22], musical genre categorization[23], real-time key point recognition[24] and periocular recognition[25].\nThe classic RBM has great ability of extracting hidden features from original data. More and more researchers proposed variant RBMs and their deep networks which were based on classic RBM, e.g., fuzzy restricted Boltzmann machine(FRBM)[26], classification RBM[27], spikeand-slab restricted Boltzmann machine (ssRBM)[28], Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machines (GRBMs)[29], sparse restricted Boltzmann machine (SRBM)[30], over-replicated softmax model[31], temporal restricted Boltzmann machines (RTRBMs)[32], circle convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (CCRBM)[33], adaptive restricted Boltzmann machine[34], relevance restricted Boltzmann machine (ReRBM)[35], theta-restricted Boltzmann machine (thetaRBM)[36], disjunctive factored four-way conditional restricted Boltzmann machine (DFFW-CRBM)[37], centered convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines (CCRBM)[38], social restricted Boltzmann machine (SRBM)[39], temperature based restricted Boltzmann machines (TRBMs)[40] and deep feature coding architecture[41].\nHowever, since the learning procedures of classic RBM and its variants are unsupervised methods, their processes of feature extraction are non-directional and conducted under no guidance. To remedy these weakness, this paper proposes a pairwise constraints restricted Blotzmann machine with Gaussian visible units (pcGRBM) and corresponding learning algorithm, where the learning procedure is guided by pairwise constraints which come from labels. In pcGRBM model, the pairwise constraints which is instance-level prior knowledge guide the process of encoding, some pairwise hidden features of pcGRBM flock together and another part of them are separated by the guidances, then the process of feature extraction is no longer non-directional. Then, the background knowledge of instance-level pairwise constraints are encoded in hidden\n2 layer features of pcGRBM. In order to testify the availability of pcGRBM, we design three structures of clustering ,in which the features of the hidden layer of the pcRBM are used as input ‘data’ for unsupervised clustering algorithms. The experimental results show that the clustering performance of K-means, SP and AP algorithms based on pcGRBM model are significantly better than traditional RBMs. In addition, the pcGRBM model for clustering is better performance than some semi-supervised algorithms (Cop-Kmeans[42], SemiSpectral clustering (Semi-SP)[43] and semi-supervised affinity propagation (Semi-AP)[44]).\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we outline the related work and provide the preliminary in section III, which includes pairwise constraints, RBM and Gauss visible units. The proposed pcGRBM model and its learning algorithm are introduced in section IV. Next, the remarkable performance of the pcGRBM model is affirmed by the task of clustering on MSRA-MM in section V. Finally, Section VI summarizes our contributions."

      "text" : "Due to the outstanding performance, more and more variants of RBM have been proposed by researchers. There are several common methods to develop standard RBM such as adding connections information between the visible units and the hidden units, changing the value type of visible or hidden units, expanding the relationships of the units between visible layer and hidden layer from constant to variable by fuzzy mathematics, constructing deep network based on autoencoder[21] by pairwise constraints.\nTo add connections information between the visible units into RBM is a kind of methods for developing standard RBM. Osindero and Hinton proposed a semi-restricted Boltzmann machines (SRBM)[45] which has lateral connections between the visible units, but these lateral connections are unit-level semi-supervised information. The learning procedure includes two stages: the first one is the visible to hidden connections which is same as a classic RBM and the second one is the lateral connections which is applied the same learning procedure as the first one. In order to enforce hidden units to be pairwise uncorrelated and to maximize entropy, Tomczak[46] proposed to add penalty term to the log-likelihood function. His framework of learning informative features is unit-level pairwise and for classification problem, while our model is instance-level pairwise and for clustering task. Zhang et al.[47] built deep belief network based on SRBM for classification. Given the hidden units, the visible units of the SRBM form a Markov random field. However, the main weakness of the SRBM is that there are massive parameters for highdimensional data, if every pairs of visible units have relations. Sutskever and Hinton proposed temporal restricted Boltzmann machine (TRBM)[48] by adding directed connections between previous and current states of the visible and hidden units. There are three kinds of connections of the full TRBM, e.g., connections between the visible units, connections between the hidden and visible units and connections between the hidden units. Furthermore, they proposed the recurrent TRBM\n(RTRBM)[32]. It is easy to compute the gradient of the loglikelihood and infer exactly. Mnih and Hinton proposed the conditional restricted Boltzmann machines (CRBMs)[49] by adding conditioning vector which determines increments to the biases of the visible and hidden layer of the traditional RBM.\nBy changing hidden units with relevancy is another kind of methods for developing standard RBM. Courville et al.[28] developed the spike-and-slab restricted Boltzmann machine (ssRBM). The ssRBM is defined as having each hidden unit associated with the product of a binary “spike” latent variable and a real-valued “slab” latent variable. In order to keep learning efficiency, as a model of natural images, the binary hidden units of the ssRBM maintain the simple conditional independence structure when they encode the conditional covariance of visible units by exploiting real-valued slab variables.\nIn general, the relationships of the units between the visible layer and the hidden layer are restricted to be constants. In order to break through this restrictions, Chen et al.[26] proposed a fuzzy restricted Boltzmann machine (FRBM) to enhance deep learning capability which can avoid the flaw. The FRBM model parameters are replaced by fuzzy numbers and the regular RBM energy function is given by fuzzy free energy functions. Moreover, the deep networks are designed by the fuzzy RBMs to boost deep learning. Nie et al.[20] proposed to theoretically extend the conventional RBMs by introducing another term in the energy function to explicitly model the local spatial interactions in the input data.\nConventional RBM defines the units of visible and hidden layer to be binary, but this limitation cannot meet the needs in practice. Then one common way is to replace them by means of Gaussian linear units, that is Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines (GBRBMs)[50]. The GBRBMs have the ability to learn meaningful features both in modeling natural images and in a two-dimensional separation task. But, as we know, it is difficult to learn the GBRBMs. So, Cho et al.[51] proposed a novel method to improve their learning efficiency. The new method includes three parts, e.g., changing energy function by different parameterizations to facilitate learning, parallel tempering learning and adaptive learning rate. Moreover, the deep networks of Gaussian-Bernoulli deep Boltzmann machine (GDBM)[52], [53] has been developed by the GBRBM in recent years. The GDBM is designed by adding multiple layer of hidden units and applied to continuous data.\nFurthermore, Zhang et al. proposed a mixed model named as supervision guided autoencoder (SUGAR)[54] which includes three components: main network, auxiliary network and bridge. The main network is a sparsity-encouraging variant of the autoencoder[21], that is the unsupervised autoencoder. The auxiliary network is constructed by pairwise constraints, that is the supervised learning. The two heterogeneous networks are designed and each of which encodes either unsupervised or supervised data structure respectively. The main network and auxiliary network are connected by the bridge which is used to enforce the correlation of the parameters. Comparing SUGAR with supervised learning and supervised deep networks, it\n3 has flexible utilization of supervised information and better balances the numerical tractability.\nIn the work of [55], Chen proposed a deep network structure based on RBMs which is the most related to our work. Both the work of [55] and our work aim to solve the similar problems, e.g., how to obtain suitable features for clustering by non-linear mapping and how to use pairwise constraints during learning process, but the model and the solution are different. They use RBMs to initialize connection weights with CD learning, learning process is still unsupervised method, then the learned weights are used to incorporate pairwise constraints in features space by maximum margin techniques. However, our pcGRBM model is based on RBMs with Gaussian visible units. Its learning process is no longer unsupervised method, but guided by pairwise constraints."

There are two types of instance-level pairwise constraints: One is cannotlink constraints which instances should not be grouped together and the other is must-link constraints which instances should be grouped together. The must-link and cannot-link constraints define an instance-level relation of transitive binary. Consequently, two types of constraints may be derived from background knowledge about data set or labeled data. In this paper, we select labeled data from different groups randomly and ensure each group has the same ratio of labeled data to be selected. Then, the must-link constraints are produced by the selected same group labeled data and the cannot-link constraints are produced by the selected different group labeled data."

      "text" : "Original RBMs were developed by binary stochastic units for the hidden and visible layers[3]. To deal with real-valued data such as natural images, one solution is that the binary visible units are replaced by linear units with independent Gaussian noise, but the hidden units remain binary, which is first suggested by[57]. The negative log probability is given by the following energy function:\n− logp(v,h) = E(v,h) = ∑\ni∈visible\n(vi − ai) 2\n2σ2i −\n∑\nj∈hidden\nbjhj − ∑\ni,j\nvi σi hjwij (10)\nwhere σi is the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise for visible unit i.\nFor each visible unit, it is easy to learn the variance of the noise, but it is difficult using CD1 because of taking long time[50][58]. Therefore, in many applications, it is easy to normalise the data to have unit variance and zero mean[50][59][60][61]. Then the reconstructed value of Gaussian visible units is equal to its input from the binary hidden units plus its bias."

From all above results, it is obvious that the pcGRBM is better than RBM for clustering.\n10"

(22)\nwhere R̂i. is the rank sum of the jth algorithm, R̂.j is the rank sum of the ith data set, D is the number of data set and G is the number of algorithm. In our experiments, all pairwise constraints come from labels information. We choose 1% to 10% pairwise constraints in steps of 1%. The average rank value is smaller the algorithm is better. As we can see from Table III, the average rank of K-means, SP, AP, Cop-Kmeans, Semi-SP, Semi-AP, Kmeans.grbm, SP.grbm, AP.grbm, Kmeans.pcgrbm, SP.pcgrbm and AP.pcgrbm algorithms are 97.5625, 154.0625, 124.4375, 95.2500, 151.6250, 121.6250, 105.5625, 96.9375, 108.8750, 33.1875, 36.0625 and 32.8125, respectively. It is easy to know that the least average rank is AP.pcgrbm algorithm with a value of 32.8125. From results on Table III, we can see that Kmeans.pcgrbm, SP.pcgrbm, AP.pcgrbm algorithms which based on pcGRBM are better than other nine algorithms.

      "heading" : "6 CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "In this paper, we proposed a novel pcGRBM model, the learning procedure of which is guided by the pairwise constraints and the process of encoding is conducted under guidance. Then, some pairwise hidden features of pcGRBM flock together and another part of them are separated by the guidances. In the process of learning pcGRBM, CD learning is used to approximate ML learning and pairwise constraints are iterated transitions between visible and hidden units. Then, the background of pairwise constraints are encoded in hidden layer features of pcGRBM. In order to testify the availability of pcGRBM, the features of the hidden layer of the pcGRBM are used as input ‘data’ for clustering tasks. The experimental results showed that the performance of the Kmeans.pcgrbm, SP.pcgrbm and AP.pcgrbm algorithms which based on pcGRBM for clustering tasks are better than their classic unsupervised clustering algorithms (K-means, SP, AP), semi-supervised clustering algorithms( Cop-kmeans, Semi-SP, Semi-AP) and even better than Kmeans.grbm, SP.grbm and AP.grbm which based on RBM with Gaussian visible units without guiding of pairwise constraints.\nThere are several interesting questions in our future studies. For example, how to design deep networks based on the pcGRBM. How to strengthen pairwise constraints information when the layer of the deep network becomes deeper and deeper. How many dimensions in hidden layer can enhance the performance for clustering.\n11"

    "abstractText" : "Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their variants are usually trained by contrastive divergence (CD) learning, but the training procedure is an unsupervised learning approach, without any guidances of the background knowledge. To enhance the expression ability of traditional RBMs, in this paper, we propose pairwise constraints restricted Boltzmann machine with Gaussian visible units (pcGRBM) model, in which the learning procedure is guided by pairwise constraints and the process of encoding is conducted under these guidances. The pairwise constraints are encoded in hidden layer features of pcGRBM. Then, some pairwise hidden features of pcGRBM flock together and another part of them are separated by the guidances. In order to deal with real-valued data, the binary visible units are replaced by linear units with Gausian noise in the pcGRBM model. In the learning process of pcGRBM, the pairwise constraints are iterated transitions between visible and hidden units during CD learning procedure. Then, the proposed model is inferred by approximative gradient descent method and the corresponding learning algorithm is designed in this paper. In order to compare the availability of pcGRBM and traditional RBMs with Gaussian visible units, the features of the pcGRBM and RBMs hidden layer are used as input ‘data’ for K-means, spectral clustering (SP) and affinity propagation (AP) algorithms, respectively. A thorough experimental evaluation is performed with sixteen image datasets of Microsoft Research Asia Multimedia (MSRA-MM). The experimental results show that the clustering performance of K-means, SP and AP algorithms based on pcGRBM model are significantly better than traditional RBMs. In addition, the pcGRBM model for clustering task shows better performance than some semi-supervised clustering algorithms.",
