{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading", "abstract": "Lipreading is the task of decoding text from the movement of a speaker's mouth. Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing or learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading approaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman, 2016a). However, existing work on models trained end-to-end perform only word classification, rather than sentence-level sequence prediction. Studies have shown that human lipreading performance increases for longer words (Easton & Basala, 1982), indicating the importance of features capturing temporal context in an ambiguous communication channel. Motivated by this observation, we present LipNet, a model that maps a variable-length sequence of video frames to text, making use of spatiotemporal convolutions, a recurrent network, and the connectionist temporal classification loss, trained entirely end-to-end. To the best of our knowledge, LipNet is the first end-to-end sentence-level lipreading model that simultaneously learns spatiotemporal visual features and a sequence model. On the GRID corpus, LipNet achieves 95.2% accuracy in sentence-level, overlapped speaker split task, outperforming experienced human lipreaders and the previous 86.4% word-level state-of-the-art accuracy (Gergen et al., 2016).", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "UPDATE:  I have read the authors' responses.

This is a nice result to know about--yet another example of a really nice result that one can get the first time one applies such methods to an old task--and all of the work that went into getting it looks solid (and likely involved some significant engineering effort).  However, this in itself is not sufficiently novel for publication at ICLR.  The paper also needs to be revised to better represent prior work, and ideally remove some of the vague motivational language.  Some specifics on what I think needs to be revised:\n\n- First, the claim of being the first to do sentence-level lipreading.  As mentioned in a pre-review comment, this is not true.  The paper should be revised to discuss the prior work on this task (even though much of it used data that is not public).  Ideally the title should also be changed in light of this.\n\n- The comparison with human lipreaders needs to be qualified a bit.  This task is presumably very unnatural for humans because of the unusual grammar, so perhaps what you are showing is that a machine can better take into account the strong contraints.  This is great, but not a general statement about LipNet vs. humans.\n\n- The paper contains some unnecessary motivational platitudes.  We do not need to invoke Easton and Basala 1982 to motivate modeling context in a linguistic sequence prediction task, and prior work using older sequence models (e.g. HMMs) for lipreading has modeled context as well.  The McGurk effect does not show that lipreading plays a crucial role in human communication.\n\n- It is worth noting that even without the spatial convolution, your Baseline-2D already does extremely well.  So I am not sure about the \"importance of spatiotemporal feature extraction\" as stated in the conclusion.\n\nSome more minor comments, typos, etc.:\n\n- citations for LSTMs, CTC, etc. should be provided the first time they are mentioned.\n- I did not quite follow the justification for upsampling.\n- what is meant by \"lip-rounding vowels\"?  They seem to include almost all English vowels.\n- Did you consider keeping the vowel visemes V1-V4 separate rather than collapsing them into one?  Since you list Neti et al.'s full viseme set, it is worth mentioning why you modified it.\n- \"Given that the speakers are British, the confusion between /aa/ and /ay/...\" -- I am not sure what this has to do with British speakers, as the relationship between these vowels exists in other English dialects as well (e.g. American).\n- The discussion about confusions within bilabial stops and within alveolar stops is a bit mismatched with the actual confusion data in Fig. 3(b,c).  For example, there does not seem to be any confusion between /m/ and /b/ or between /m/ and /p/.\n- \"lipreading actuations\":  I am not sure what \"actuations\" means in this context\n- \"palato-alvealoar\" --> \"palato-alveolar\"\n- \"Articulatorily alveolar\" --> \"Alveolar\"?", "IS_META_REVIEW": true}, {"TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 pcs", "comments": "Let me start by saying that your area chair does not read Twitter, Reddit/ML, etc. The metareview below is, therefore, based purely on the manuscript and the reviews and rebuttal on OpenReview.\n \n The goal of the ICLR review process is to establish a constructive discussion between the authors of a paper on one side and reviewers and the broader machine-learning community on the other side. The goal of this discussion is to help the authors leverage the community for improving their manuscript.\n \n Whilst one may argue that some of the initial reviews could have provided a more detailed motivation for their rating, there is no evidence that the reviewers were influenced (or even aware of) discussions about this paper on social or other media --- in fact, none of the reviews refers to claims made in those media. Suggestions by the authors that the reviewers are biased by (social) media are, therefore, unfounded: there can be many valid reasons for the differences in opinion between reviewers and authors on the novelty, originality, or importance of this work. The authors are free to debate the opinion of the reviewers, but referring to the reviews as \"absolute nonsense\", \"unreasonable\", \"condescending\", and \"disrespectful\" is not helping the constructive scientific discussion that ICLR envisions and, frankly, is very offensive to reviewers who voluntarily spend their time in order to improve the quality of scientific research in our field.\n \n Two area chairs have read the paper. They independently reached the conclusion that (1) the reviewers raise valid concerns with respect to the novelty and importance of this work and (2) that the paper is, indeed, borderline for ICLR. The paper is an application paper, in which the authors propose the first\u00caend-to-end sentence level lip reading using deep learning. Positive aspects of the paper include:\n \n - A comprehensive and organized review about previous work.\n - Clear description of the model and experimental methods.\n - Careful reporting of the results, with attention to detail.\n - Proposed method appears to perform better than the prior state-of-the-art, and generalizes across speakers.\n \n However, the paper has several prominent negative aspects as well:\n \n - The GRID corpus that is used for experimentation has very substantial (known) limitations. In particular, it is constructed in a way that leads to a very limited (non-natural) set of sentences.\u00ca(For every word, there is an average of just 8.5 possible options the model has to choose from.)\n - The paper overstates some of its claims. In particular, the claim that the model is \"outperforming experienced human lipreaders\" is questionable: it is not unlikely that model achieves its performance by exploiting unrealistic statistical biases in the corpus that humans cannot / do not exploit. Similarly, the claims about the \"sentence-level\" nature of the model are not substantiated: it remains unclear what aspects of the model make this a sentence-level model, nor is there much empirical evidence that the sentence-level treatment of video data is helping much (the NoLM baseline is almost as good as LipNet, despite the strong biases in the GRID corpus).\n - The paper makes several other statements that are not well-founded. As one of the reviewers correctly remarks, the McGurk effect does not show that lipreading plays a crucial role in human communication (it merely shows that vision can influence speech recognition). Similarly, the claim that \"Bi-GRUs are crucial for efficient further aggregation\" is not supported by empirical evidence.\n \n A high-level downside of this paper is that, while studying a relevant application of deep learning, it presents no technical contributions or novel insights that have impact beyond the application studied in the paper.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"TITLE": "Reply to reviewers", "OTHER_KEYS": "Nando de Freitas", "comments": "We strongly request that our paper be reviewed for its contents, contributions, significance, originality, and impact. We also would like to highlight the following three points to reviewers and readers. \n\n(i) Claim of \"sentence-level\" lipreading: This was the main concern of reviewers 1 and 2, and likely why they gave us the surprisingly low scores of 4 (7 being borderline for acceptance). Our claim is that we proposed the first \"end-to-end sentence-level\" lipreading approach, and we have edited the paper to make this precise. The phrase \u201cend-to-end\u201d is very important. The previous few attempts at sentence-level lipreading used heuristic pipelines and obtained poor results. LipNet, on the other hand, is fully end-to-end and achieves state-of-the-art results by a significant margin. on the largest available public dataset  (with over 24 hours of video, making it far from trivial). Given the removal of the phrase sentence-level, the reviews of reviewers 1 and 2 regarding prior work are not longer applicable.\n\n(ii) Is the dataset too simple? GRID despite all its shortcomings, is the largest available public dataset with over 24 hours of video (more than 2,000,000 frames and 64,000 possible sentences), making it more comparable to ImageNet than to say MNIST or CIFAR-10. May deep learning papers have used simplified versions of this dataset (eg restrictions to speaker-dependent recognition, or classification only) and even then obtained worse results. Moreover, we have embarked on more commercial datasets with success as reported in this keynote by NVIDIA's CEO at CES (177,393 attendees).

The primary novelty is the end-to-end nature of the system for lipreading, with the sentence-level prediction also differentiating this with prior work. The described neural network architecture contains convolutional and recurrent layers with a CTC sequence loss at the end, and beam search decoding with an LM is done to obtain best results. Performance is evaluated on the GRID dataset, with some saliency map and confusion matrix analysis provided as well.\n\nOverall, the work seems of high quality and clearly written with detailed explanations. The final results and analysis appear good as well. One gripe is that that the novelty lies in the choice of application domain as opposed to the methods. Lack of word-level comparisons also makes it difficult to determine the importance of using sentence-level information vs. choices in model architecture/decoding, and finally, the GRID dataset itself appears limited with the grammar and use of a n-gram dictionary.

The results \nare very nice for the small vocabulary grammar task defined by the GRID corpus. The engineering here is clearly very good, will be interesting to see the performance on large vocabulary LM tasks. Comparison to human lip reading performance for conversational speech will be very interesting here.\n\n- Traditional AV-ASR systems which apply weighted audio/visual posterior fusion reduce to pure lip reading when all the weight is on the visual, there are many curves showing performance of this channel in low audio SNR conditions for both grammar and LM tasks.\n\n- Traditional hybrid approaches to AV-ASR are also sentence level sequence trained with fMPE/MPE/MMI etc. objectives (see old references), so we cannot say here that this is the first sentence-level objective for lipreading model (analogous to saying there was no sequence training in hybrid LVCSR ASR systems before CTC). \n\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "16 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "A nice result, but with limited novelty", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "UPDATE:  I have read the authors' responses.
