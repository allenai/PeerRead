      "text" : "GeoGebra is an educational mathematics software tool, with millions of users. In 2005, its founder Markus Hohenwarter broadened its software development into an open source project. GeoGebra’s features (including dynamic geometry, computer algebra, spreadsheets and function investigation) primarily focus on facilitating student experiments in Euclidean geometry, and not on formal reasoning. Including automated deduction tools in GeoGebra’s dynamic geometry system (DGS) could introduce a whole new range of learning and teaching scenarios.\nSince automated theorem proving (ATP) in geometry has reached a rather mature stage, in 2010 some ATP experts agreed on starting a project of incorporating and testing a number of different automated provers for geometry in GeoGebra. This collaboration was initiated by Tomás Recio. Since the initial kickstart this project reached the following milestones:\n1. A workshop for theoretical planning took place in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, February 2011.\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n01 22\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2. A second workshop for implementation planning took place in Alcalá de Henares, Spain, January 2012.\n3. A prototype implementation was presented in Alcalá de Henares in June 2012 by demonstrating 44 test cases using 5 different theorem prover methods [2, 12].\n4. First public release in GeoGebra 5.0 in October 2014 with 60 test cases [4].\n5. Full documentation and fixing several issues according to users’ feedback in July 2015 in [15].\n6. Extension of the set of the translated dynamic geometry construction tools to cover 200 test cases.\nIn this paper we report about the last milestone. In section 2 we give a comprehensive overview about the first milestones. Section 3.1 summarizes our results by focusing on the general improvements in GeoGebra. Section 3.2 shows some tables concerning our test results. Section 4 sketches up our next planned steps for another milestone in the implementation."

      "text" : "An interactive prover system designed mainly for secondary school students can differ from expert prover systems in some aspects. For example, GCLC [9] and OpenGeoProver [19] process a program code written in its special language and print the output as a precise report about the computation details. By contrast, a DGS tool should collect all pieces of information about the relationships of the objects purely by analyzing the construction being created by point-and-click edits and possibly some other input parameters for the prover commands; finally the output is typically a yes/no answer and eventually some extra prescribed conditions to avoid degeneracy cases.\nThere is a plenty of literature on reports on successful applications of DGS by extending one with an ATP subsystem. Among them, here we mention GeoProof [18] and LADucation [1] which are open-sourced, and thus it is possible to continue their efforts by external researchers also. A publicly available variant of LADucation was already able to import a GeoGebra construction and set up an equation system which was solved by an external computer algebra system (CAS). Other systems including JGEX [24] and Cinderella [11] are not opensourced, but built upon a similar approach: visualizations in the DGS must be supported by ATP computations.\nOur project harnessed GeoGebra’s success in the classrooms and tried to address some problems of the existing DGS/ATP prototypes including small distribution, being unmaintained or incomplete operation. In our solution in GeoGebra a user creates a dynamic geometry construction which contains free\npoints and dependent points as usual. All dependent points are already determined by the free points, however, all free points can be dragged by the user as desired. When a free point is dragged, some dependent points will also be changed by following the definitions in the construction steps. In such a way geometric theorems can be visualized by experiment.\nThis technique is well known in the world of DGS. Going one step forward, an ATP subsystem can give a more sound answer whether the visually obvious facts (for example, if three dependent points in a given construction are always collinear) generally hold. GeoGebra’s command line interface with its Prove and ProveDetails commands and the graphical Relation Tool [16] introduce a higher level interface to investigate the problem setting by using an ATP subsystem.\nProving Euclidean elementary geometry theorems was introduced in GeoGebra with its version 5 in September 2014. A report [4] shows a benchmark about 60 theorems which can be directly checked with the Prove and ProveDetails commands in GeoGebra. More details are shown in [14] about how the prover subsystem is embedded to GeoGebra’s user interface intuitively by using and extending the Relation Tool.\nThere are several approaches to compute a proof internally by using GeoGebra’s portfolio prover [13], including\n• Wu’s method [23] by using OpenGeoProver externally, and also\n• the area method [6] (via OpenGeoProver), moreover\n• Recio’s exact check method [12] and\n• the Gröbner basis method [10, 17].\nIn our present work we focused on the internally implemented Gröbner basis method which translates the geometric objects to algebraic equations directly and manipulates on the algebraic equation system by eliminating the dependent variables. Our work could be however used for Wu’s method also, since we just defined a set of equations to translate geometric construction tools into an algebraic approach. We used complex algebraic geometry in our computations which is a standard way to set up a Euclidean geometry question (see [7, chapter 6])."

      "text" : "GeoGebra’s geometry tools have been classified by [20, p. 104] as “easy to use”, “middle” and “difficult to use”. Preiner defines two criteria for a tool to be easy (p. 121):\n1. The tool does not depend on already existing objects, or just requires existing points which can also be created ‘on the fly’ by clicking on the drawing pad. The order of actions is irrelevant and no additional keyboard input is required.\n2. The tool directly affects only one type of existing object or all existing objects at the same time and requires just one action. Again, the order of actions is irrelevant and no additional keyboard input is required.\nThe basic concept in our work was to implement theorem proving features for the easier tools in GeoGebra. Also it was important that the usually discussed classroom theorems can be quickly constructed by using the easier tools. The classroom theorems usually require points, segments, rays, lines and circles, and angles. For some more advanced topics tangents, parabolas, ellipses and hyperbolas may be needed."

      "heading" : "3.1.1 Translating geometry to algebra",
      "text" : "Implementing angles and conics may have theoretical difficulties in our approach. For angles, we refer to the fact that it is not possible to define only the interior bisector of an angle: we always need to work together with internal and external angles at the same time (cf. [5, p. 40]). This is a consequence of handling angles: there is no way to check equality unless one computes the tangent of them, that is, instead of checking α = β one verifies tan(α) = tan(β) and these formulas are equivalent only if we set up some restrictions, say 0 ≤ α, β < π. In this sense we cannot distinguish 0o and 180o.\nFor conics, ellipses and hyperbolas must also be handled as nondistinguishable objects, because using the synthetic approach we need to define them with their foci, and the defining relations are the same. More precisely, given foci A and B and conic point C, another point P is an element of the conic if and only if AC + CB = AP + PB in the case of an ellipse and |AC −CB| = |AP −PB| (that is, (AC −CB)2 = (AP −PB)2) in the case of a hyperbola. Since the lengths in these equations are non-negative quantities, we either need to add constraints AC ≥ 0, CB ≥ 0, AP ≥ 0 and PB ≥ 0 (which are not possible in complex algebraic geometry due to lack of inequalites), or we need to use the squared quantities AC2, CB2, AP 2 and PB2 and express these equations exclusively by them. In this second case we need to eliminate the nonsquared quantities from the equation. With the help of the following computer algebra command we learn that for both the ellipse and the hyperbola we get the same product of 8th degree (here we used Giac [14] for computations):\n>> factor(eliminate([AC+CB=AP+PB,AC^2=ac^2,CB^2=cb^2,AP^2=ap^2,PB\n^2=pb^2],[AC,CB,AP,PB]))\nreturns\n[(ac-cb-ap-pb)*(ac-cb-ap+pb)*(ac-cb+ap-pb)*(ac-cb+ap+pb)*(ac+cb-\nap-pb)*(ac+cb-ap+pb)*(ac+cb+ap-pb)*(ac+cb+ap+pb)]\nwhich has the same result as for the input\n>> factor(eliminate([(AC-CB)^2=(AP-PB)^2,AC^2=ac^2,CB^2=cb^2,AP\n^2=ap^2,PB^2=pb^2],[AC,CB,AP,PB]))\nInterpreting the result, it is only possible to define the set AC±CB = ±AP±PB in the complex algebraic geometry sense which consists of 8 theoretical curves:\n1. AC + CB = AP + PB, the ellipse,\n2. AC + CB = AP − PB ⇔ AC + CB + BP = AP , which—according to the triangle inequality—is possible only in a degenerate case when A, B and C (and also P ) are collinear,\n3. AC+CB = −AP +PB ⇔ PA+AC+CB = PB, similar to the previous collinear case,\n4. AC + CB = −AP − PB ⇔ AC + CB + AP + PB = 0 which is possible only in a degenerate case when A = B = C = P ,\n5. AC − CB = AP + PB ⇔ CA + AP + PB = CB, similar to the former collinear cases,\n6. AC − CB = −AP + PB, one branch of the hyperbola,\n7. AC − CB = AP − PB, the other branch of the hyperbola,\n8. AC − CB = −AP − PB ⇔ CA + AP + PB = CB, again similar to the former collinear cases.\nThat is, we indeed obtained that an ellipse and a hyperbola cannot be distinguished in this model (but all other non-degenerate curves can be distinguished from them). This issue will give some limitations to investigate special features of conics, but still enable investigating some common features of them. For example, the following generalization of Pascal’s hexagon theorem for conics holds (see Fig. 1):\nTheorem 1. Let c be the union of an ellipse and a hyperbola, both defined with foci A, B and circumpoint C. Let a denote line AB and let the perpendicular bisector of a be b. Let C ′ be the reflection of C to the line a and C ′′ to b. Also let us take an arbitrary point D on c and by reflection to a and b, respectively, obtain points D′ and D′′. Now the intersections of CD and C ′′D′′, CD′ and C ′C ′′, moreover C ′D and D′D′′ will be collinear.\nA consequence of this example that some formulas can also be difficult to distinguish, and may require further investigation by using elimination and factorization with the help of a CAS.\nIn general, when a construction is given, it is important to identify geometrical hypotheses which are non-distinguishable from other geometrical hypotheses because they are translated with the same algebraic formula. When the prover disproves the respective statement in the algebraic translation, it should not be interpreted that the geometry statement was false. This is the case when attempting to prove that the internal bisectors of a triangle are concurrent: the algebraic translation actually disproves that the union of the internal and external angle bisectors are concurrent.\nAlso it is important to identify geometrical theses which are nondistinguishable from other geometrical theses because they are translated with the same algebraic formula. When the prover proves the respective statement in the algebraic translation, it should not be interpreted that the geometry statement was true."

      "text" : "Theorem 2. Let c be a circle with center A and circumpoint B. Let a be a line through B and C. Now—not considering some degenerate cases—reflecting line a about c the image is a circle, that is, for arbitrary point D ∈ a its reflection D′ about c always lies on the same circle (which is the circumcircle of points A, B′(= B) and C ′, where B′ and C ′ are the mirror images of B and C about c, respectively).\nIn other words, an inversion translates lines to circles in general. To use GeoGebra’s Relation Tool (see Fig. 2) one needs to set up the construction as described in the Algebra View on the left (either by selecting tools from the top, or by using commands in the Input Bar on the bottom). Finally one has to\nselect the Relation Tool from the top and choose point D′ and line d (or enter the command Relation[D,d] in the Input Bar). GeoGebra now numerically checks if D ∈ d, the answer is yes, and the user can request a symbolical check by clicking on “More. . .”. Finally GeoGebra concludes that—under some nondegeneracy conditions—the statement is generally true.\nFrom the computational point of view, GeoGebra here uses the Gröbner basis method.

Since A = (0, 0), B = (v3, v4) and C = (v5, v6), this clearly means that the two non-degeneracy conditions being shown are “A differs from B” (that is, circle c is non-degenerate) and “A, B and C are not collinear” (that is, such a line must be chosen for a which is not going through the center of c).\nFinally, GeoGebra concludes that\n19:48:26.714 Statement is GENERALLY TRUE 19:48:26.714 Benchmarking: 487 ms\n19:48:26.717 OUTPUT for ProveDetails: null = {true, {\"AreCollinear[A,B,C]\", \"AreEqual[A,B ]\"}}\nThis computation is done faster than half of a second.1"

Our theorem corpus has a significant number of test cases. Cf. [22].\n• The best performing theorem prover—when using our corpus—is the complex algebraic geometry prover via Singular [8]. Here the [7, chapter 6, §4] algorithm was used. Timing is remarkably under one second in most test cases.\n• The table can be misleading when investigating other columns. Actually, there is no implementation for intersections with conics in GeoGebra for Recio’s method. Also E2/Giac can use a different algorithm with better (but slightly slower) results. Some GeoGebra commands are not yet implemented in the communication layer between GeoGebra and OpenGeoProver, that is, columns E3a and E3b show only a limited amount of positive test cases.\n• For the end user the significant case is the last column, since Singular is disabled by default to ensure the same behavior on offline and online runs."

Now they can be proven with GeoGebra’s help, that is, at least a yes/no answer is provided for many theorems, including:\n• The Pythagorean theorem. The intercept theorem. The geometric mean and cathetus theorems. Thales’ theorem.\n• Concurrency of medians, bisectors, altitudes. Euler line. The midline theorem, Varignon’s theorem. The nine points circle. Simson’s theorem.\n• The angle bisector theorem.\n• Basic properties of translations and rotations.\n• Basic properties of reflections about a point, a line or a circle.\n• Ceva’s theorem, Menelaus’ theorem. Desargues’s theorem, Pappus’ theorem.\n• Basic properties of conic sections (including tangents).\nThe underlined theorems can be proven with the internal complex algebraic geometry prover in GeoGebra by using the enhancements implemented in the last milestone in our work."

[21]).\n• Improve Gröbner bases computations in Giac to implement transcendent coefficients (see [7, chapter 6, §4]). This would speed up computations in a number of cases which are currently infeasible: an indirect reduction of variables would be achieved in this way.\n• GeoGebra’s LocusEquation command is capable of computing algebraic loci [3]. It would be possible to unify the code base for the locus and the prover subsystem, and the unified system could be maintained and improved easier.\nAlso implementing conic sections for Recio’s exact check method would speed up GeoGebra’s proofs significantly."
