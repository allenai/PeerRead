      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Generating natural language descriptions for images and videos is a long-standing problem, in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Solving the problem requires developing powerful models capable of extracting visual information about various objects in an image, while deriving semantic relationships between them in natural language. For video captioning, the models are additionally required to find compact representations of the video which capture the temporal dynamics across image frames.\nThe recent advances in training deep neural architectures have significantly improved in the state-of-the-art across computer vision and natural language understanding. With impressive results in object detection and scene understanding, Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) [23] have become the staple for extracting feature representations from images. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) [15] units or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)[10], have similarly emerged as generative models of choice for dealing with sequences in domains ranging from language modeling, machine translation to speech recognition. Advancements in these fundamental problems make tackling challenging problems, like captioning [16, 45], dialogue [32] and visual question answering [1] more viable.\nDespite the fundamental complexities of these problems, there has been increasing interest in solving them. A common underlying approach in these proposed models is the notion of ”attention mechanisms”, which refers to selectively focusing on segments of sequences [3, 47] or images [35] to generate corresponding outputs. Such attention based approaches are specially attractive for captioning problems, since they allow the network to focus on patches of the image conditioned on the previously generated tokens [45, 16], often referred to as spatial attention.\nModels with spatial attention, however cannot be readily used for video description. For instance, in the Youtube2Text dataset, a video clip stretches around 10 sec-\n1\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n06 49\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n0 N\nov 2\n01 6\nonds, or around 150 frames. Applying attention on patches in these individual frames provides the network with local spatial context. This however, does not take ordering of the frame sequence or events ranging across frames, into consideration. To incorporate this temporal attention into the model, [47, 49, 27] extend this soft alignment to video captioning. Most of these approaches, treat the problem of video captioning in the sequence-to-sequence paradigm [37] with attentive encoders and decoders. This requires them to find a compact representation of the video, which is passed as context to the RNN decoder.\nHowever, we identify two primary issues with these approaches. For one, applying attention sequentially provides the model with local context at the generative decoder [46]. As a result the decoder would be unable to deal with longterm dependencies while captioning videos of longer duration. Secondly, these models jointly learn the multimodal embedding in a visual-semantic space [28, 49] at the RNN decoder. With the annotated sentences being the only supervisory signal, learning a mapping from a sequence of images to a sequence of words, is difficult. This is specially true for dealing with video sequences, as the underlying probability distribution is distinctively multimodal. While [28] tries to address this issue with an auxiliary loss, the model suffers from the first drawback.\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we introduce a model which generalizes Key-Value Memory Networks [25] to a multimodal setting for video captioning. The proposed model, naturally tackles the problem of maintaining long-term temporal dependencies in videos, by explicitly providing all image frames for selection at each time step. We also propose a novel key-addressing scheme (see Section 4), which keeps track of previous attention distributions, allowing us to exploit temporal structure at multiple hierarchies and provide a global context. At the same time, the framework provides an effective way to deal with the complex transformation from the visual to language domain. Using a pre-trained model to explicitly transform individual frames (keys) to semantic embedding (values), we construct memory slots with each slot being a tuple (key, value). This allows to provide a weighted pooling of textual features as context to the decoder RNN, which is closer to the language model.\nIn summary, our key contributions are following :\n• We generalize Key-Value Memory Networks (KVMemNN) in a multimodal setting to generate natural descriptions for videos, and more generally deal with sequence-to-sequence models.\n• We propose a novel key-addressing schema, conditioning on the previous time-step attention distributions for the key-value pairs. This allows us to exploit spatial and temporal structure at multiple hierarchies.\n• The proposed model is evaluated on the YouTube dataset [7], where we outperform strong baselines while reporting competitive results against state-of-art models.\nThe remaining part of paper is organized as following. Section 2 provides a brief literature review of related work. In Section 3 we present details of our proposed model with recurrent key-addressing. Section 4 demonstrates the advantages of the model with experimental details and empirical analysis, followed by discussions and conclusions in Section 5."

      "text" : "Following the success of end-to-end neural architectures and attention mechanisms, there is a growing body of literature for captioning tasks, in images and more recently videos. To deal with the multimodal nature of the problem, classical approaches relied on manually engineered templates [19, 11]. And while some recent approaches in this direction show promise [13], the models lack generalization to deal with complex scenes, videos.\nAs an alternative approach, [14, 18] suggest learning a joint visual-semantic embedding, effectively a mapping from the visual to language space. The motivation of our work is strongly aligned with [31], who generate semantic representations for images using CRF models, as context for the language decoder. However, our approach significantly differs in the essence that we capture spatio-temporal dynamics in videos while generating the text description.\nBuilding on this, and Encoder-Decoder [3, 9] models for machine translation , [42, 41] develop models which compute average fixed-length representations (for images, videos respectively) from image features. These context vectors are provided at each time step to the decoder language model, for generating descriptions. The visual representations for the images are usually transferred from pretrained convolution networks [33, 38].\nAn immediate drawback of the above approach is collapsing features across image frames to fixed vector by mean-pooling. For one, this loses the temporal structure across frames by treating them as ”bag-of-images” model. Addressing this, [37] propose Sequence-to-Sequence models for accounting for the temporal structure, and [40] extend it to a video-captioning setting. However, passing a fixed vector as context at each time step, creates a bottleneck for the flow of gradients using Backpropagate Through Time (BPTT) [43] at the encoder.\nMeanwhile, the notion of visual attention, has a rich literature in Psychology and Neuroscience, and has recently found application in Computer Vision [26] and Machine Translation [3]. Allowing the network to selectively focus on the patches of images or segments of the input se-\nquences, representative works [45, 47, 16, 4, 49, 27, 28] have significantly pushed the state-of-the-art in individual domain. In essence, with the decoder output selectively conditioned on the encoder states the issues of fixed length representation and gradient bottleneck are largely solved:\np(yi|yi−1, ..., y1, x) = g(yi−1, si, ci) (1)\nwhere,yi is the readout, ci is the context from the encoder and si = f(si−1, yi−1, ci), is the hidden state of decoder RNN (See [3] for details).\nHowever, as discussed in Section 1, sequential attention provides the decoder with local context [46]. Additionally, providing a semantic input which is closer to language space, as context to the decoder significantly improves on the capability of the model [48]. Our work closely brings these advances together in a Memory Networks framework [44, 36, 20]. While we introduce Key-Value Memory Networks [25] in a multimodal setting, there are several other key differences from previous works. For one, to our knowledge this is the first work which introduces video captioning in light of Memory Networks. This automatically deals with problems of maintaining long-term dependencies in the input stream by explicitly storing image representations. Meanwhile we also tackle the ”vanishing gradient problem” typical with training RNN Encoder-Decoder modules for long input sequences.\nKey-Value MemNNs [25] are originally proposed for QA task in the language domain, providing the last timestep hidden state, as input to the classifier. In this work, we address a more complex problem of video captioning by proposing a novel key-addressing scheme (details in Section 4) and (key, value) setup for exploiting the hierarchical spatio-temporal structures. The model tracks the attention distribution at previous time steps, thereby providing a strong context on where to attend on the complete video sequence. This implicitly provides a global temporal structure\nat each readout. While similar in motivation to [48, 30], the model architecture and domain of application, especially on capturing global temporal dynamics in videos as opposed to images or entailment, is significantly different."

As we are dealing with videos (sequence of images), we define two different encoders to achieve the mapping.\nCNN Encoder: Given an input image It ∈ RNxM , the CNN encoders learn a mapping f : RNxM → RD , if we consider the output of fully-connected layers in standard ConvNet architectures [33]. In case of convolution outputs, the encoders learn f : RNxM → RLxD, where L is the number of context vectors of dimensionality D.\nRNN Encoder: Consider an input sequence of length T . The RNN encoder processes the input X sequentially, generating hidden states ht at each time step, where\nht = g(f(It), gt−1) (2)\nWhile maintaining temporal dependencies, this allows us to map variable length sequences to fixed length context vector. In this work we use modified version of an LSTM [15] unit, as proposed in [50] to implement g.\nLearning a good representation for the keys is imperative to good performance of the model.

      "text" : "The model is built around a Key-Value Memory Network [25] with memory slots as vector pairs (k1, v1), ..., (kn, vn). The keys and values serve the purpose of transforming visual space context into language space, and effectively capture the relationships between the video features and textual descriptions. The memory definition, addressing and reading schema is outlined below :\nKeys (K): In our model, feature vectors for each frame It of the video are extracted using CNN Encoders. To incorporate sequential structure (video being a sequence of images), these appearance feature vectors are passed through a RNN Encoder, and hidden state at each timestep is extracted as key kt.\nkt = g(f(It), kt−1) (3)\nThis allows the model to capture the temporal variation between frames, and take the ordering of actions and events into consideration. Implicitly this also helps, preserving high level information about motion in the video [4].\nValues (V ): Jointly learning visual-semantic embedding with supervisory signal only from annotated descriptions in Encoder-Decoder models is difficult [48]. To mitigate this, and to improve the context provided to the language model at decoder, we explicitly precompute semantic embedding corresponding to individual frames in the video.\nFor each image frame It we generate a semantic embedding vt, which represents the textual meaning of that frame. This could be obtained from any pretrained model which jointly models visual and semantic embedding for images [45, 16, 42]. In this work we use a pretrained DenseCap model [16], to obtain semantic embedding corresponding to every image. Therefore,\nvi = ψ(It) (4)\nwhere, ψ is the intermediate visual-semantic embedding from a pretrained image captioning model. This gives for each frame in the video a key-value memory slot (kt, vt).\nKey Hashing: This refers to retrieving a subset of the relevant memory slots for a given query vector q. For each video clip (typically with 120-240 frames), key-value pairs of T equally spaced image frames are extracted using pretrained models and are stored in the memory.\nKey Addressing: This corresponds to the soft-attention mechanism deployed to assign a relevance probability αi to each of the retrieved memory slots. These relevant probabilities are used for value reading (details in Section 4).\nValue Reading: The value reading from the memory slots, returns the weighted sum of the key-value feature vectors: φt(K) and φt(V ) at each time step. φt(K) is used for key addressing at the next time step and φt(V ) is taken as input to the decoder RNN for generating the next word.\nφt(V ) = N∑ i=1 α (t) i vi (5)"

      "text" : "The joint probability over generating the output sequence can be decomposed as:\np(y|x1, ..., xT ) = N∏ t=1 p(yt|hT , y1, .., yt−1) (6)\nwhere hT is the context vector representing X = {x1, ..., xT } and y = {y1, ..., yN} is the output sequence. To train the network, the overall objective is therefore to maximize the log-likelihood of the output word sequence.\nTo this effect, Recurrent Neural Networks have been widely used for natural language generation tasks like Machine Translation, Image Captioning and Video Description generation. Vanilla RNNs are difficult to train for long range dependencies as they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem [5]. Thus, we use Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) [15] as they are known to memorize context for longer period of time using controllable memory units.\nThe LSTM model has a memory cell ct in addition to the hidden state ht of RNNs, which effectively summarizes the information observed up to that time step. There are primarily three gates which control the flow of information i.e (input, output, forget). The input gate it controlling the current input xt, forget gate ft adaptively allowing to forget old memory and output gate ot deciding the extent of transfer of cell memory to hidden state. The recurrences at the decoder are defined as:\nit = σ(Wiht−1 +Uixt +Aiφt(V ) + bi) (7) ft = σ(Wfht−1 +Ufxt +Afφt(V ) + bf ) (8) ot = σ(Woht−1 +Uoxt +Aoφt(V ) + bo) (9) c̃t = tanh(Wcht−1 +Ucxt +Acφt(V ) + bc) (10) ct = it c̃t + ft ct−1 (11) ht = ot ct (12)\nwhere is an element wise multiplication, σ is the sigmoidal non-linearity. Wi,Ux,Ax and bx, are the weight matrices for the previous hidden state, input, value context and bias respectively. Here φt(V ) represents the context vector to the decoder at each time step.\nFollowing standard sequence-to-sequence models with generative decoders, we apply a single layer network con-\nditioned on the hidden state ht.\nst = tanh(Ws[ht, xt, φt(V )] + bs) (13) pt = softmax(Upst + bp) (14)\nHere st refers to the pre-softmax hidden representation with concatenated inputs ht, xt, φt(V ) and pt is the probability distribution over the vocabulary for sampling the current word."

      "text" : "Soft attention mechanism have recently been successful in Image Captioning[45] and Video Description Generation [47] tasks because they help to focus on relevant parts of the features rather than mean pooling. In [41], the feature vectors were simply averaged, leading to loss of the temporal relationships between frames of the video. Soft attention mechanism weights each frame allowing to exploit the temporal structure in video. They were also used in the Key-Value Memory Networks[25] to focus on more relevant keys and reads the weighted sum of values.\nWe propose a recurrent key addressing mechanism which looks at the previous attention distribution over keys to obtain the new relevance scores. This helps to exploit multiple hierarchies in sequence-to-sequence architectures as the model is selecting relevant frames based on the key distribution seen so far and the previously generated words. There is a Key Addressing RNN (referred to as Memory LSTM in Fig. 4) to keep track of the previous attention distributions over keys and uses the hidden state to find the new attention weights αi. The current hidden state of the Memory LSTM takes as input the previous relevance distribution over keys φt−1(K):\nhkt = f k(φt−1(K), h k t−1) (15)\nwhere fk is the recurrent unit. The relevance distribution on the memory slots is evaluated using a query vector q, which summarizes the frames seen so far and the output generated. The query vector q is a weighted combination of the decoder and key-addressing hidden states.\nq =Wkh k t +Wdht−1 (16)\nFor obtaining the attention weights, the relevance score eti of i-th temporal feature is obtained using the decoder RNN hidden state ht−1, key addressing RNN hidden state hkt and the i-th key vector ki:\neti = wt tanh(q+Uaki) (17)\nwhere wt, Wd, Wk and Ua are parameters of the model. This allows us take into consideration the previously generated words, the attention distribution on previous time steps and the individual key representations.\nThese relevance scores are normalised using a softmax function which gives the attention distribution αti using:\nαti = exp{eti}∑N j=1 exp{etj}\n(18)\nThe proposed model is flexible, because it allows multiple hops for iterative inference just like in the original framework. The query vector q at initial time step is a mean-pooled average of all the keys ki. The segregation of the vision and language components into key-value pairs provides a better context for the RNN decoder. Also, the explicit memory structure provides access to the image frames at all time steps allowing the model to assign weights to the key-frames without losing information."

We simply average over a feature map which results in a feature of length C and are then used as keys. The visual features extracted from the pool5/7x7 s1 layer of GoogLeNet is a 1024 dimensional vector and are also used as keys.\nThe values are generated from a pre-trained image captioning module following [45, 16], which identifies salient regions in an image, and generates a caption for each of these regions. Densecap jointly models the task of object localization as well as description using a Fully Convolutional Localization Network (FCLN). After passing the image through CNN and Localization layers, Recognition network is used which is essentially a fully connected layer. We extract output from this layer which is encoded as region codes of size BxD, where B is the number of salient regions or boxes, and D is the representation with dimension 4096. Along with the features, a score S is assigned to each of the regions which denotes its confidence.

We test our proposed model in the basic setting with visual features extracted from a pretrained VGG-16 [33] and GoogLeNet[38] models, as depicted by the first two lines of Table 1. The key addressing in these models, follows the basic approach as in [25], i.e without tracking the last time steps. These models are able to outperform the baselines of S2VT [40], and the Basic Encoder-Decoder model introduced in [47] on all three metrics. Using the recurrent key-addressing, we see further boost in performance. We observe that using features from pretrained GoogleNet rather than VGG-16 improves on the results, following [42].\nt-KeyAddressing refers to using only the last time attention distribution over keys in the query vector. Using GoogleNet to extract features, we achieve significantly better results compared to the temporal attention introduced by [47], where they do not utilize attention distribution from previous time steps further in the model. Additionally, [47]\nuse 3D Convolution Networks to extract local temporal features, while we work directly on the individual frame features.\nUsing a recurrent addressing scheme; an LSTM for storing previous attention distributions, leads to huge improvement on all the metrics and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This model, referred to as m-KeyAddressing, outperforms strong baselines from [27] by a significant margin on BLEU@4. While the improvements on METEOR are significant compared to tKeyAddressing, [27] learns a hierarchical representation of the video, thereby performing slightly better. In the current setting, our model is unable to outperform [49] which uses a stacked LSTM at the decoder and generates more granular descriptions. A possible approach for improvement in this direction is using more sophisticated regularizers for training the decoder, as proposed in [2, 21].\nIn Table 5.1 we provide comparison on whether the models use finetuning on the CNN encoder (represented by Fine) or if they use external features, like on action recognition, optical flow (represented by Feat). It is to be noted, that we do not finetune the encoder, or the image captioning module as compared to [4] which finetunes the encoder CNN on UCF101 action recognition set[34]. Also, no additional features are extracted for gaining more information about motion, actions etc. as in [49], [4], [40].\nIn Fig 4, we show examples of some of the input frames and generated outputs, with ground truths. Some of the examples demonstrate the fact that the model is able to infer the activities from the video frames, like ”swimming”, ”riding” and ”flying” which is often distributed across multiple frames."

    "abstractText" : "Deep Neural Network architectures with external memory components allow the model to perform inference and capture long term dependencies, by storing information explicitly. In this paper, we generalize Key-Value Memory Networks to a multimodal setting, introducing a novel keyaddressing mechanism to deal with sequence-to-sequence models. The advantages of the framework are demonstrated on the task of video captioning, i.e generating natural language descriptions for videos. Conditioning on the previous time-step attention distributions for the key-value memory slots, we introduce a temporal structure in the memory addressing schema. The proposed model naturally decomposes the problem of video captioning into vision and language segments, dealing with them as key-value pairs. More specifically, we learn a semantic embedding (v) corresponding to each frame (k) in the video, thereby creating (k, v) memory slots. This allows us to exploit the temporal dependencies at multiple hierarchies (in the recurrent keyaddressing; and in the language decoder). Exploiting this flexibility of the framework, we additionally capture spatial dependencies while mapping from the visual to semantic embedding. Extensive experiments on the Youtube2Text dataset demonstrate usefulness of recurrent key-addressing, while achieving competitive scores on BLEU@4, METEOR metrics against state-of-the-art models.",
