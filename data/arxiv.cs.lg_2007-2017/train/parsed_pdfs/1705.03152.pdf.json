However, the phonetic information has been largely overlooked by most of existing neural LID models, although this information has been used in the conventional phonetic LID systems with a great success. We present a phone-aware neural LID architecture, which is a deep LSTM-RNN LID system but accepts output from an RNN-based ASR system. By utilizing the phonetic knowledge, the LID performance can be significantly improved. Interestingly, even if the test language is not involved in the ASR training, the phonetic knowledge still presents a large contribution.

      "text" : "Language identification (LID) lends itself to a wide range of applications, e.g., mix-lingual (code-switching) speech recognition. Early methods are based on statistical models of phonetic or acoustic units [1, 2, 3]. Recent methods are based on probabilistic acoustic modeling, among which the i-vector model is perhaps the most successful [4, 5].\nRecently, deep neural models have attracted much attention in LID. Lopez-Moreno et al. [6] proposed a DNN-based approach which uses a DNN to discriminate different languages at the frame-level, and the language posteriors of an utterance are generated by a simple average of all the frame-level posteriors of the utterance. An RNN-based approach was later proposed by Gonzalez-Dominguez et al. [7], and better performance was obtained with much less parameters compared to the DNN-based model. Due to the advantage in temporal modeling, the RNN approach has been followed by a number of researchers, e.g., [8, 9]. Other neural model structures were also investigated, e.g., CNN [10, 11] and TDNN [12, 13]. Compared to the i-vector approach that is based on a probabilistic model, these pure neural methods show clear advantage in short utterances (e.g., 2∼3 seconds) [6, 7, 9]. The main advantage of the neural-based methods, compared to the i-vector model, is that they are discriminative and can learn complex decision bounds between languages, provided that sufficient data is provided. Moreover, the power of feature learning associated with deep neural nets often provides better robustness against noise and speaker variation, which is highly important for LID.\nDeep neural models are also used in a hybrid way, i.e., to generate features [14] or alignment [15, 16] for an i-vector model. In this case, the phonetic DNN/RNN model is trained for phone discrimination as in automatic speech recognition (ASR). This model is then used to produce bottle-neck features or acoustic alignment for constructing the i-vector model. By using the phonetic information that is directly related to LID, the i-vector model can be consistently improved.\nThe above two-approaches have their own disadvantages. For the pure neural approach, the entire system relies on raw features, ignoring any phonetic information that is known to be important from the beginning of LID research [2]; for the hybrid system, it is still based on a probabilistic model that (1) involves a strong Gaussian assumption that is not suitable for dealing with complex class (here, language) boundaries; (2) requires relatively more speech frames to estimate a reliable i-vector, which is not applicable to many real applications that require quick identification, e.g., code-switch ASR.\nIn this paper, we follow the pure neural model scheme, and enhance the existing models by introducing phonetic information as an auxiliary feature. Due to the clear advantage of the LSTM-RNN in both ASR and LID, we adopt this model in the study, though the idea of leveraging phonetic information is applicable to any neural models. The architecture is illustrated in Figure 1, which involves a phonetic RNN that is trained to discriminate phones as in ASR and produces phonetic features once the training is done, and an LID RNN which receives the phonetic features and uses them together with the raw acoustic feature to perform LID. This model has the following properties:\n• The phonetic RNN can be trained with flexible objectives. It can be discriminant for phones (as in ASR) or for both phones and languages, following the multi-task learning principle [17].\n• The phonetic RNN can be trained independently from the LID RNN. This means that it can be trained using data of any languages that are totally different from the target languages of the LID task. This is particularly attractive when the LID task is to discriminate lowresource languages.\n• The phonetic feature extraction and propagation is flexible. It can be extracted from any place of the phonetic RNN, and can be propagated to any place of the LID RNN.\nThis architecture is a reminiscence of the early phonetic recognition and language modeling (PRLM) approach [18], where a phone recognizer is used as a front-end to decode phonetic units, followed by a phonetic LM to perform scoring. The two RNNs in our architecture can be regarded as corresponding to the phone recognizer and the LM respectively, although the structure is much more flexible than the historic model. In fact, if the phonetic features are derived from the output layer of the phonetic RNN and are propagated to the input layer of the LID RNN, and if the raw feature is omitted, we obtain a PRLM system where the LID RNN is essentially an RNN-based phone LM. This architecture was recently studied by Salamea et al. [19].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: the model structure is described in Section 2 and the experiments are re-\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n03 15\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nM ay\n2 01\n7\nMultilingual input\nLID output\nLSTM LSTM\nASR output\nported in Section 3, followed by some conclusions and future work in Section 4."

One reason for the choice is that LSTM-RNN has been demonstrated to perform well in both the pure neural approach [7] and the hybrid approach [16]. Another reason is that this structure (phonetic feature plus RNN LID) is in accordance with our motivation to model the phonetic dynamics as in the old PRLM approach [18]. This section first describes the LSTM-RNN structure used in the study, and then presents the phone-aware LID system."

Although the phonetic features can be extracted from any places of the phonetic RNN, we choose to use the output of the recurrent projection layer. Similarly, the receiver of the phonetic features is also flexible and we will investigate the performance of difference choices. The configure shown in Figure 3 uses the non-linear function g(·) as the receiver. With this configure, most computation of the LID RNN remains the same, except that the cell value should be updated as follows:\nct = ft ct−1 + it g(Wcxxt +Wcrrt−1 +W ′crr′t + bc)\nwhere r′t is the phonetic feature propagated from the phonetic RNN.\nIn this study, all the RNN models use the same configuration that the LSTM layer consists of 1, 024 cells, and the dimensionality of both the recurrent and non-recurrent projections is set to 256. The natural stochastic gradient descent (NSGD) algorithm [21] is employed to train the model."

In this paper, we chose speech data of four languages from the Babel corpus to conduct the study: Assamese, Georgian, Bengali, and Turkish. For each language, a training dataset and a development dataset were officially provided. Training dataset contains both conversational speech and scripted speech and development dataset only has conversational speech. We used the entire training set of each language in the model training, but randomly selected 2, 000 utterances from the development set of each language to perform the test.

      "text" : "As the first step, we build three RNN baseline systems using the speech data of two languages: Assamese and Georgian. The three RNN baselines are: multilingual ASR system (AG-ASR), LID system (AG-LID), ASR-LID multi-task system (AG-MLT). For the AG-ASR, the phone sets of the two languages are merged and the softmax group involves all the state targets, which is 3, 349 in our experiment. The ASR performance in terms of word error rate (WER) is 68.2% and 65.5% for Assamese and Georgian on the whole development dataset, respectively. The training and decoding follow the standard WSJ s5 nnet3 recipe of Kaldi. For the AG-LID, the output layer consists of two units, corresponding to the two languages respectively. The training procedure is similar to the one used for training the AG-ASR model. The AG-MLT model involves two groups of targets, and the training utilizes the labels of both phones and languages.\nThe LID for Assamese and Georgian can be conducted by either AG-LID or AG-MLT, using the language posteriors they produce. The performance results with these two systems, in terms of Cavg and equal error rate (EER), are shown in Table 1. Both the frame-level performance and the utterance-level performance are reported. For the utterance-level results, the frame-level posteriors are averaged to produce the utterancelevel posterior, with which the LID is conducted.\nThe results in Table 1 indicates that both the LID RNN and the multi-task LID RNN are capable of language discrimination, and the multi-task RNN performs better. This is expected\n1Language collection release IARPA-babel102b-v0.5a. 2Language collection release IARPA-babel404b-v1.0a. 3Language collection release IARPA-babel103b-v0.4b. 4Language collection release IARPA-babel105b-v0.5.\nas the ASR targets can help to regularize the model training and alleviate the impact of variability factors such as noise and speaker."

Specifically, 20 test utterances are randomly selected from the test set for each language, and these utterances are fed into the phonetic RNN frame by frame. For each frame, the phonetic feature is read from the recurrent projection layer of the tested RNN, and then is projected into the 2-dimensional space by PCA. Figure 4 presents the distribution of the features for Assamese and Georgian, the two languages ‘known’ in the model training. Figure 5 shows the distribution for Bengali and Turkish, two language that are ‘unknown’ in the model training. Figure 6 shows the distribution of the features of all the four languages. It can be observed that all the three RNNs possess certain discriminative capability for both the known and unknown languages. Comparing the three models, the features generated by the ASRbased RNN is clearly worse, and the features generated by the multi-task RNN looks more discriminative. Note that the phonetic features of Assamese and Bengali are highly overlapped, no matter which phonetic RNN is used. This means that the four-language LID task will be highly difficult, as we will see shortly."

Compared to the results with the baseline RNNs (Table 1), introducing the phonetic feature leads to clear performance improvement, on both the frame-level and the utterance-level, in terms of both Cavg and EER.\nThen we use the AG-ASR and AG-LID models as the phonetic RNNs with only the best configurations above, that is, the g function or output gate as the receiver. The AG-ASR results in better performance than both the baseline and AG-LID, which further confirms our conjecture that phonetic information is valuable for neural-based LID.\nTable 2: Results of phone-aware LID on known languages (Assamese and Georgian).\nCavg EER% Phonetic RNN Inf. receiver Fr.

Specifically, we use the feature to help discriminate two new languages, i.e., the languages that are unknown during the phonetic RNN training, which are Bengali and Turkish in our experiment. To test the gain with the phonetic feature, the LID RNN trained with the two target languages, Bengali and Turkish, denoted by BT-LID, is used as the baseline. For simplicity, we only test the scenario where the AG-MLT is used as the phonetic RNN, and the g function is used as the feature receiver.\nThe results are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that although the phonetic RNN has no knowledge of the two target languages, the phonetic feature it produces is still highly valuable for the LID task. This is understandable as the phonetic units are often shared by human languages, and so the phonetic\ninformation the phonetic RNN provides is generally valuable. This in fact demonstrates that the phonetic RNN can be trained very flexibly, by using speech data of any languages. This is particulary interesting for languages with too little training data to obtain a reasonable phonetic RNN."

      "text" : "We presented a phone-aware LSTM-RNN model for language identification. Our argument is that phonetic information is important for LID. This information has been successfully used in the historical phonetic models such as the famous PRLM system, but it has been largely ignored by the present pure acoustic methods, either the i-vector model or the pure neural model. Particularly with the LSTM-RNN model, the inherent power on modeling temporal dynamics with this model has been largely wasted without phonetic information involved. The phoneaware architecture we proposed in the paper employs a deep neural model to produce phonetic features and these features are propagated to the vanilla LSTM-RNN LID system. Our experiments conducted on the data of four languages of the Babel corpus demonstrated that the phone-aware model can dramatically improve performance of the LSTM-RNN LID system. In the future, we will test the phone-aware approach on more languages and under more complex conditions. Particularly, we expect that with the phonetic information, the RNN-based LID may be significantly improved on long utterances, by providing the phonetic normalization."

However, the phonetic information has been largely overlooked by most of existing neural LID models, although this information has been used in the conventional phonetic LID systems with a great success. We present a phone-aware neural LID architecture, which is a deep LSTM-RNN LID system but accepts output from an RNN-based ASR system. By utilizing the phonetic knowledge, the LID performance can be significantly improved. Interestingly, even if the test language is not involved in the ASR training, the phonetic knowledge still presents a large contribution. Our experiments conducted on four languages within the Babel corpus demonstrated that the phone-aware approach is highly effective.",
