      "text" : "Developing tools for processing many languages has long been an important goal in NLP (Rösner, 1988; Heid and Raab, 1989),1 but it was not until many researchers adopted statistical methods that it became economical to train multilingual NLP models. Although most NLP models still focus on English, a growing number of researchers develop and evaluate their models on more languages. The mainstream approach for multilingual NLP is to design language-specific models. For each language of interest, the resources necessary for training the model are created, and separate parameters are fit for each language separately. This approach is simple, effective and grants the flexibility\n1As of 2007, the total number of native speakers of the hundred most popular languages only accounts for 85% of the world’s population (Wikipedia, 2016).\nof customizing the model or features to the needs of each language independently, but it is suboptimal for theoretical as well as practical reasons. Theoretically, the study of linguistic typology tells us that many languages share morphological, phonological, and syntactic phenomena (Bender, 2011). Practically, it is painful to deploy multilingual NLP tools because, for each language of interest, we need to configure, train, tune, monitor and occasionally update the model. Code-switching or codemixing (mixing more than one language in the same discourse) presents a challenge for monolinguallytrained NLP models, exacerbated on social media outlets (Barman et al., 2014).\nIn parsing, the availability of homogeneous syntactic dependency annotations in many languages (McDonald et al., 2013; Nivre et al., 2015b; Agić et al., 2015; Nivre et al., 2015a) presents the opportunity to develop a language-universal dependency parser: one that is capable of parsing sentences in multiple languages of interest. Such language-universal parser can potentially replace an array of language-specific monolingually-trained parsers (for languages with a treebank). The same parser may also be used to parse languages for which no treebank is available, as explored by Cohen et al. (2011), McDonald et al. (2011), Zhang and Barzilay (2015), and Guo et al. (2016). Although multilingual dependency treebanks have been available for a decade via the 2006 and 2007 CoNLL shared tasks (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007), the treebank of each language was annotated independently and used inconsistent annotation conventions.\nWe propose a parsing architecture that takes as input a sentence in any language that meets our resource requirements.2 The parser is trained on the union of available universal dependency treebanks in different languages. Our approach integrates and critically relies on several recent developments in the field including universal POS tags (Petrov et al., 2012), multilingual word clusters (Täckström et al., 2012), universal dependency treebanks (McDonald et al., 2013), neural network architectures for transitionbased parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014; Dyer et al., 2015), character-based embeddings (Ballesteros et al., 2015), multilingual word embeddings and language embeddings. We show that our language-universal parser outperforms (1) individual monolingually-trained parsers, and (2) previous multi-source model transfer methods used to parse low-resource languages. Our language-universal parser is publicly available at http://bit.ly/1SJGUKi."

We also optionally use language-specific fine-grained POS tags when available.\nIn the fully supervised scenario (i.e., Lt ⊆ Ls), the mainstream approach has been to train one monolingual parser per target language and route\n2The minimum requirements are: (i) a coarse part-of-speech tagger, (ii) a bilingual dictionary or parallel corpus that “connects” it (perhaps transitively) to a language with a treebank in the training dataset.\nsentences of a given language to the corresponding parser at test time. In contrast, our approach is to train one parsing model with the union of treebanks in all source languages, then use this single trained model to parse text in any of the target languages. This approach is expected to perform well if the model uses a similar representation for words and other syntactic elements across languages, so that data from each language informs parsing in all the others."

      "heading" : "3.1 Transition-based Parsing with S-LSTMs",
      "text" : "Dyer et al.’s S-LSTM parser, like most transitionbased parsers, can be understood as the sequential manipulation of three data structures: a buffer B (from which we read the token sequence), a stack S (which contains partially-built parses), and a list A of actions previously taken by the parser. In particular, we use the arc-standard parsing algorithm (Nivre, 2004).3\nAt each timestep t, a transition action is applied that alters these data structures according to Table 1, which is reproduced from Dyer et al. (2015).\nAlong with the discrete transitions above, the parser calculates a vector representation of the states of B, S, and A; at time t these are denoted by bt, st, and at, respectively. The parser state at time t is given by:\npt = max {0,W[st;bt;at] + d} (1)\nwhere the matrix W and the vector d are learned parameters. This continuous-state representation pt is\n3Since the arc-standard transition system assumes projectivity, we use pseudo-projective transformations (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005) of non-projective trees in the training treebanks.\nused to decide which action z to apply next, updating B, S, and A accordingly. The probability of an action z is defined to be:\np(z | pt) = exp\n( g⊤z pt + qz )\n∑ z′∈A(S,B) exp ( g⊤ z′ pt + qz′ )\nwhere A(S,B) is the set of actions which meet the preconditions in Fig. 1, and gz and qz are parameters associated with each action type z.\nWe train the model by maximizing the loglikelihood of correct actions. At test time, the parser greedily chooses the most probable action in every time step until a complete parse tree is produced. Dyer et al. (2015) provide more details on the core parser.\nOptimization. Instead of updating the parameters with the gradient of each sentence, we use a mini-batch which includes one sentence sampled uniformly from each language. This prevents one source language with plenty of training data (e.g., German) from dominating source languages with small training data (e.g., Swedish). Therefore, each epoch updates the model a number of times equal to the size of the smallest training treebank used (Swedish). We use the stochastic optimization algorithm “adam” (Kingma and Ba, 2014) to fit model parameters, and use early stopping based on the UAS score on a development set.\nToken representation. For monolingual parsing, we represent each token by concatenating four vectors: a learned word embedding, a fixed pretrained word embedding, a coarse POS embedding and, when available, a fine-grained POS embedding. For language-universal parsing, we start with a delexicalized model where the token representation only consists of the coarse POS embedding. Most of the modifications we discuss in subsequent subsections\nprovide the parser with multilingually-defined information at the token level to help make better predictions."

      "heading" : "3.2 Lexical Embeddings",
      "text" : "Previous work has shown that sacrificing lexical features in dependency parsing amounts to a substantial decrease in the performance of a dependency parser (Cohen et al., 2011; Täckström et al., 2012; Tiedemann, 2015; Guo et al., 2015). We use two kinds of multilingually-defined lexical features to improve our language-universal parser.\nBefore training the parser, we estimate Brown clusters of English words and project them via word alignments to words in other languages. This is similar to the projected clusters of Täckström et al. (2012). To go from Brown clusters to embeddings, we ignore the hierarchy within Brown clusters and assign a unique parameter vector to each cluster.\nWe also use Guo et al.’s (2016) multilingual robust projection method to pretrain embeddings of words in all source and target languages. In this method, we start by learning embeddings for English words using the skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013). The next step computes an embedding of each word in the other languages as the weighted average of English word embeddings, using word alignment probabilities as weights. The last step computes an embedding of words for which we did not already compute an embedding by averaging the embeddings of all words within an edit distance of 1 in the same language."

      "heading" : "3.3 Language Embeddings",
      "text" : "While many languages, especially ones that belong to the same family, exhibit some similar syntactic phenomena (e.g., all languages have subjects, verbs,\nand objects), different languages often exhibit substantial syntactic differences. Some of these differences are easy to characterize (e.g., subject-verbobject vs. verb-subject-object, prepositions vs. postpositions, adjective-noun vs. noun-adjective), while others are subtle (e.g., number and positions of negation morphemes).\nConsequently, training a language-universal parser on treebanks in multiple source languages requires caution. While exposing the parser to a diverse set of syntactic patterns across many languages has the potential to improve its performance in each, dependency annotations in one language will, in some ways, contradict those in typologically different languages.\nFor instance, consider a context where the next word on the buffer is a noun, and the top word on the stack is an adjective, followed by a noun. Treebanks of languages where postpositive adjectives are typical (e.g., French) will often teach the parser to predict REDUCE-LEFT, while those of languages where prepositive adjectives are typical (e.g., English) will teach the parser to predict SHIFT.\nInspired by Naseem et al. (2012), we address this problem by informing the parser about the input language it is currently parsing. Given a vector embedding of the language of the input, l, we apply a squashed (tanh) affine transformation and feedin to the token and action representations, as well as directly to the parser state:\npt = max {0,W[st;bt;at; l] + d}\nWe used three language descriptors in l: a one-hot representation of the input language, one-hot representations of word-order properties of the input language,4 and smoothed values of all WALS typological features of the input language.5\n4The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS; Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013) is an online portal documenting typological properties of 2,679 languages (as of July 2015). We use the same set of WALS features used by Zhang and Barzilay (2015), namely 82A (order of subject and verb), 83A (order of object and verb), 85A (order of adposition and noun phrase), 86A (order of genitive and noun), and 87A (order of adjective and noun).\n5Since WALS features are not annotated for all languages, we use the average value of all languages in the same genus."

However, those fine-grained POS tagsets are defined monolingually and are only available for a subset of the languages with universal dependency treebanks.\nWe extend the token representation to include a fine-grained POS embedding (in addition to the coarse POS embedding). We stochastically dropout the fine-grained POS embedding with 50% probability (Srivastava et al., 2014) so that the parser can make use of fine-grained POS tags when available but stays reliable when the fine-grained POS tags are missing."

For each language, the strong baseline we use is a monolingually-trained S-LSTM parser with a token representation which concatenates: pretrained word embeddings (50 dimensions),8 learned word embeddings (50 dimensions), coarse POS tag embeddings (12 dimensions), fine POS tag embeddings (12 dimensions), and Brown cluster embeddings (12 dimensions). All embeddings are learned for each language independently, except the pretrained word embeddings. The parser uses a two-layer S-LSTM for each of S, B, and A. This parser is denoted monolingual.\nLanguage universal models. The training set concantenates the training sections of all languages, while the development set concatenates the first 300 sentences of the dev section of each language. We do not tune the hyperparameters of the S-LSTM parser, and use the same values used for training the monolingual baselines.\nThe first language-universal parser only uses coarse POS embeddings as the token representation. As shown in Table 3, this parser consistently performs much worse (12.5 LAS points on average) than the monolingual baselines.\nAdding lexical embeddings to the token representation as described in §3.2, +lexical substantially improves the performance of language-universal models, recovering 83% of the LAS gap between monolingual and language-universal on average. +language ID further improves the performance using language embeddings as described in\n8These embeddings are treated as fixed inputs to the parser, and are not optimized towards the parsing objective.

The other two language descriptors we considered, full typology and word order, also outperform the previous model (+lexical) and give an average LAS of 82.5 and 83.2, respectively.\nFinally, our best model is +fine-grained POS, which uses fine-grained POS embeddings when available (for English, Italian, Portuguese and Swedish). Surprisingly, adding fine-grained POS embeddings improve the performance even for languages where fine-grained POS tags are not available (i.e., German, Spanish and French). This model outperforms monolingual in five (out of seven) target languages, and wins on average by 0.3 LAS points. We emphasize that this model is only trained once on all languages, and the same model is used to parse the test set of each language, which simplifies the deployment of multilingual parsers in production systems."

      "text" : "Our work builds on many past ideas about parsing low-resource languages with no or few tree annotations. Zeman and Resnik (2008) pioneered the model transfer approach by training a parser on a source language treebank then applying it to parse sentences in a target language. Cohen et al. (2011) and McDonald et al. (2011) used treebanks in multiple source languages for training unlexicalized parsers applied to target languages. To add lexical information, Täckström et al. (2012) used multilingual word clusters, while Xiao and Guo (2014), Guo et al. (2015) and Guo et al. (2016) used multilingual word embeddings. Naseem et al. (2012), Täckström et al. (2013), and Zhang and Barzilay (2015) used language typology to improve model transfer.\nAnother popular approach for cross-lingual parsing is to project tree annotations from the source language to the target language via a parallel corpus (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hwa et al., 2005)\nor via automatically-translated sentences (Tiedemann et al., 2014). Ma and Xia (2014) used entropy regularization to learn from both parallel data (with projected annotations) and unlabeled data in the target language. Rasooli and Collins (2015) trained an array of target-language parsers on fully annotated trees, by iteratively decoding sentences in the target language with incomplete annotations."
