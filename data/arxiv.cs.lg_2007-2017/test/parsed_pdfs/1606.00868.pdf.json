      "text" : "In business applications such as opinion monitoring on social media, accurately predicting the proportion of each opinion class is more important than predicting each individual opinion accurately. Understanding the customer intent to watch a movie before and after the release of a trailer, for example, requires accurate quantification of the class proportions that may exhibit high variation day to day and be completely different than training-time proportions. Naively aggregating standard classifier probability outputs, in general, produces severely biased estimates of class proportions whenever test and training class distributions significantly differ, precisely when something interesting happens. In that\ncase, probability outputs are not optimal for classification either, because the assumed prior class probabilities, namely the training proportions, no longer match the actual priors corresponding to test class proportions.\nThe goal of quantification is to yield accurate estimates of the test class proportions regardless of the training class proportions. These estimates can then be used to adjust classifier probability outputs. The benefits are more pronounced when classes are less separable, and test and training distributions are more divergent. Obviously, a perfect classifier is also a perfect quantifier. Despite all the advances in machine learning, however, we do not often have access to perfect classifiers (Hand, 2006), especially when training data is scarce.\nOur main contribution here is unifying major quantification approaches mentioned in the literature under a single framework. In this unified view, all the major quantification approaches share a multivariate constrained regression model, and differ only in their choice of feature transformation and loss functions. This unification not only offers conceptual clarity and simplicity around the topic of quantification, but has practical benefits as well. By outlining the mathematical programming solutions for the constrained regression model for different loss functions, we extend existing binary-only quantification approaches to multi-class settings. Existing major quantification approaches will be explained next, before we detail the constrained regression framework. ar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n00 86\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nJ un\n2 01"

      "text" : "Although its history goes back to at least 1966 (Gart and Buck, 1966), quantification, as a name, first occurred in a series of papers by Forman (Forman, 2005; Forman, 2007; Forman, 2008). Forman identified the importance of the problem at HP, as they needed to monitor the fast diverging prevalence of support issues over time by analyzing support log data.\nIn a binary setting, the classical quantification method is to first estimate the true positive rate (tpr) and false positive rate (fpr) using a classifier with cross-validation. Then by using an adjustment formula on naive proportion prediction p ′ , the adjusted class proportion p is estimated as:\np = max(min( p ′−fpr\ntpr−fpr , 1), 0)\nForman introduces variations of this idea by using different cut-off thresholds in calculating p ′ , tpr and fpr. The threshold determines the class decision boundary, and directly affects the class assignments; hence p ′ , tpr and fpr. The following methods based on threshold choices are described in his papers:\n1. The standard threshold of 0.5 is called adjusted count (AC)\n2. The threshold that maximizes the tpr − fpr is called Max\n3. The threshold where tpr = 1− fpr is called X\n4. The threshold where tpr = 0.5 is called T50\n5. Using every quantized threshold first and then taking the median of the estimates is called Median Sweep (MS)\nWhile these thresholds are empirically chosen, Friedman uses the optimum threshold that minimizes the variance of proportion estimates (Friedman, 2014). Friedman’s optimum threshold is dynamic and for a given class corresponds to its training proportion.\nForman also introduces a mixture model, where he seeks to combine classifier score distributions per class obtained via cross-validation with test class\nproportions to obtain the test classifier score distribution. Test class proportions that minimize the difference (using a loss function called PP-Area that corresponds to minimizing L1-norm) between the predicted test CDF and actual CDF then becomes his solution. A similar idea is used by (Gonzalez-Castro et al., 2013) in their HDy method with basically two differences: they replace Forman’s PP-Area metric with Hellinger distance, and use probability mass function (PMF) instead of the CDF to characterize the distributions. The method used by (Bella et al., 2010) can also be viewed as a mixture model. Instead of using a PMF or CDF, they use the mean value of the probability distributions in the mixture model. Friedman, on the other hand, utilizes a mixture model with PMF in setting up a diagnostic test for concept drift, i.e. whether the distribution of features per class is still the same in training and test, but does not utilize it in predicting the proportions.\nThe quantification approach by (Hopkins and King, 2010) is different from the above-mentioned methods in that it does not require a classifier to come up with the class proportion estimates. Yet this method can be seen as quite similar to the mixture model approach mentioned above with the exception that instead of classifier probabilities, feature distributions are used directly with a feature sampling strategy. Feature distribution is modeled as a univariate multinomial distribution with 2N possible outcomes (N=sampled feature size), each of which is a possible feature profile. The HDx method outlined in (Gonzalez-Castro et al., 2013) similarly works directly with features without a classifier.\nA completely different approach is pursued in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2015) and (Barranquero et al., 2015). They replace the standard loss function used in training with one that targets proportion estimation directly. These methods do not use any post-adjustment and directly use the classifier output for quantification. A recent study, (Tasche, 2016), claims that “quantification without adjustments” methods work only in the degenerate case, i.e. when the class distributions in training and test are the same or nearly the same. We exclude these type of methods from our unification framework.\nAll of these approaches, with the exception of Friedman, and Hopkins & King, limit their focus to binary classification, and leave the multi-class case\nfor future work. Both Friedman, and Hopkins & King introduce standard constrained least squares as their solution methodology for multi-class settings. Friedman, in addition, demonstrates the infeasibility of “one vs. rest” approaches in extending quantification from binary to multi-class settings."

Because the framework is multi-variate, existing binary-only approaches are automatically extended to the multi-class setting under this modeling.\nWe assume that the distribution of features given a class is identical in test and training data. Any quantification task that does not largely satisfy this fundamental assumption is beyond the scope of this paper."

      "text" : "The general constrained regression model for quantification is:\ny = Xπ̂F +\ns.t. π̂F >= 0 and ∑ π̂F = 1\nExisting quantification approaches differ from each other simply by adopting either a different feature transformation function, fl(x), or a different loss function for the regression.\nHopkins & King use a feature transformation function that directly targets approximating the distribution of features via repeated random sampling. Roughly, they produce vectors, by first sampling n features, tabulating all existing permutations and\nnormalizing them to derive a distribution. GonzálezCastro in their HDx method, on the other hand, derive a distribution for each feature separately. In these two methods maximum value of the subscript l refers to the number of repeated samples, and number of features respectively.\nThe remaining approaches use a feature transformation function that operates on the probability output, Pr(y = cl|x), (L = K) of a base classifier. Because the probability output is only affected by the same variables, the distribution of probability output given a class is also the same in test and training data by an extension of the fundamental assumption (see (Friedman, 2014) for an illustration).\nThe specific fl(x) choice for each quantification approach, derived simply from definitions, is shown in Table 1 along with abbreviations we will be using in the rest of the paper.\nNote that, we abuse the notation slightly, when fl(x) returns a vector output as in the approaches that use the bin function. In those cases the X and y should be flattened to change their row size from L to L × B. We also consider a subset of Forman’s methods that have clear interpretations in multi-class settings. The T50, X and Max methods, for example, are binary specific and need a new definition for multi-class; therefore they are excluded.\nIt is also important to note that approaches using a base classifier need to use cross-validation to estimate the fl(x). Repeating the cross-validation multiple times, and averaging the results increases the stability of the final estimate. As in Hopkins & King, the regression can be performed until a convergence criterion is reached. It is also possible to stack the data from many trials and solve one final regression problem."

The accuracy of RNTN and logistic regression in this task was 44%, and 38% respectively. This was a practical choice for us, because performing cross-validations would take a lot longer if we used RNTN. It is also a test to see if we can get good results with average classifiers.

Each horizontal line corresponds to an experiment, and each color in that\nline is category whose length is its proportion. The punctuated nature of the graphs is due to the ordering of categories for easier comparability.\nIn Figure 2, the post-quantification accuracy densities are displayed for the best performing methods.

Apart from its intrinsic value as an aggregate statistic, quantification output can also be used to optimize classifier probabilities, thereby increasing classification accuracy. We unify major quantification approaches under a constrained multi-variate regression framework, and use mathematical programming to estimate class proportions for different loss functions. With this modeling approach, we extend existing binary-only quantification approaches to multi-class settings as well. We empirically verify our unified framework by experimenting with several multi-class datasets including the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and CIFAR-10.",
