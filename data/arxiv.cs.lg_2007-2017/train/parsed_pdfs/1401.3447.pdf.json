      "text" : "Traditionally, machine learning algorithms have focused on the induction of models with low expected error. In many real-word applications, however, several additional constraints should be considered. Assume, for example, that a medical center has decided to use machine learning techniques to build a diagnostic tool for heart disease. The comprehensibility of decision tree models (Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman, 2001, chap. 9) makes them the preferred choice on which to base this tool. Figure 1 shows three possible trees. The first tree (upper-left) makes decisions using only the results of cardiac catheterization (heart cath). This tree is expected to be highly accurate. Nevertheless, the high costs and risks associated with the heart cath procedure make this decision tree impractical. The second tree (lower-left) dispenses with the need for cardiac catheterization and reaches a decision based on a single, simple, inexpensive test: whether or not the patient complains of chest pain. Such a tree would be highly accurate: most people do not experience chest pain and are indeed healthy. The tree, however, does not distinguish between the costs of different types of errors. While a false positive prediction might result in extra treatments, a false negative prediction might put a person’s life at risk. Therefore, a third tree (right) is preferred, one that attempts to minimize test costs and misclassification costs simultaneously.\nc©2008 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nFinding a tree with the lowest expected total cost is at least NP-complete.1 As in the cost insensitive case, a greedy heuristic can be used to bias the search towards low-cost trees. Decision Trees with Minimal Cost (DTMC), a greedy method that attempts to minimize\n1. Finding the smallest consistent tree, which is an easier problem, is NP-complete (Hyafil & Rivest, 1976).\nboth types of costs simultaneously, has been recently introduced (Ling, Yang, Wang, & Zhang, 2004; Sheng, Ling, Ni, & Zhang, 2006). A tree is built top-down, and a greedy split criterion that takes into account both testing and misclassification costs is used. The basic idea is to estimate the immediate reduction in total cost after each split, and to prefer the split with the maximal reduction. If no split reduces the cost on the training data, the induction process is stopped.\nAlthough efficient, the DTMC approach can be trapped into a local minimum and produce trees that are not globally optimal. For example, consider the concept and costs described in Figure 2 (left). There are 10 attributes, of which only a9 and a10 are relevant. The cost of a9 and a10, however, is significantly higher than the others. Such high costs may hide the usefulness of a9 and a10, and mislead the learner into repeatedly splitting on a1−8, which would result in a large, expensive tree. The problem would be intensified if a9 and a10 were interdependent, with a low immediate information gain (e.g., a9 ⊕ a10). In that case, even if the costs were uniform, a local measure might fail to recognize the relevance of a9 and a10.\nDTMC is appealing when learning resources are very limited. However, it requires a fixed runtime and cannot exploit additional resources to escape local minima. In many real-life applications, we are willing to wait longer if a better tree can be induced (Esmeir & Markovitch, 2006). For example, the importance of the model in saving patients’ lives may convince the medical center to allocate 1 month to learn it. Algorithms that can exploit additional time to produce better solutions are called anytime algorithms (Boddy & Dean, 1994).\nThe ICET algorithm (Turney, 1995) was a pioneer in non-greedy search for a tree that minimizes test and misclassification costs. ICET uses genetic search to produce a new set of costs that reflects both the original costs and the contribution of each attribute in reducing misclassification costs. Then it builds a tree using the EG2 algorithm (Nunez, 1991) but with the evolved costs instead of the original ones. EG2 is a greedy cost-sensitive algorithm that builds a tree top-down and evaluates candidate splits by considering both the information gain they yield and their measurement costs. It does not, however, take into account the misclassification cost of the problem.\nICET was shown to significantly outperform greedy tree learners, producing trees of lower total cost. ICET can use additional time resources to produce more generations and hence widen its search in the space of costs. Because the genetic operations are randomized, ICET is more likely to escape local minima – into which EG2 with the original costs might be trapped. Nevertheless, two shortcomings limit ICET’s ability to benefit from extra time. First, after the search phase, it uses the greedy EG2 algorithm to build the final tree. But because EG2 prefers attributes with high information gain (and low test cost), the usefulness of highly relevant attributes may be underestimated by the greedy measure in the case of hard-to-learn concepts where attribute interdependency is hidden. This will result in more expensive trees. Second, even if ICET overcomes the above problem by randomly reweighting the attributes, it searches the space of parameters globally, regardless of the context in the tree. This imposes a problem if an attribute is important in one subtree but useless in another. To better understand these shortcomings, consider the concept described by the tree in Figure 2 (right). There are 10 attributes with similar costs. The value of a1 determines whether the target concept is a7⊕a9 or a4⊕a6. The interdependencies result in\na low gain for all attributes. Because ICET assigns costs globally, the attributes will have similar costs as well. Therefore, ICET will not be able to recognize which one is relevant in which context. If the irrelevant attributes are cheaper, the problem is intensified and the model might end up relying on irrelevant attributes.\nRecently, we have introduced the cost-insensitive LSID3 algorithm, which can induce more accurate trees when allocated more time (Esmeir & Markovitch, 2007a). The algorithm evaluates a candidate split by estimating the size of the smallest consistent tree under it. The estimation is based on sampling the space of consistent trees, where the size of the sample is determined in advance according to the allocated time. LSID3 is not designed, however, to minimize test and misclassification costs. In this work we build on LSID3 and propose ACT, an anytime cost-sensitive tree learner that can exploit additional time to produce lower-cost trees. Applying the sampling mechanism in the cost-sensitive setup, however, is not trivial and imposes three major challenges: (1) how to produce the sample, (2) how to evaluate the sampled trees, and (3) how to prune the induced trees. In Section 3 we show how these obstacles may be overcome.\nIn Section 4 we report an extensive set of experiments that compares ACT to several decision tree learners using a variety of datasets with costs assigned by human experts or automatically. The results show that ACT is significantly better for the majority of problems. In addition, ACT is shown to exhibit good anytime behavior with diminishing returns."

      "text" : "Offline concept learning consists of two stages: the learning stage, where a set of labeled examples is used to induce a classifier; and the classification stage, where the induced classifier is used to classify unlabeled instances. These two stages involve different types of costs (Turney, 2000). Our primary goal in this work is to trade learning speed for a reduction in test and misclassification costs. To make the problem well defined, we need to specify: (1) how misclassification costs are represented, (2) how test costs are calculated, and (3) how we should combine both types of cost.\nTo answer these questions, we adopt the model described by Turney (1995). In a problem with |C| different classes, a misclassification cost matrix M is a |C|× |C| matrix whose Mi,j entry defines the penalty of assigning the class ci to an instance that actually belongs to the class cj . Typically, entries on the main diagonal of a classification cost matrix (no error) are all zero.\nWhen classifying an example e using a tree T , we propagate e down the tree along a single path from the root of T to one of its leaves. Let Θ(T, e) be the set of tests along this path. We denote by cost(θ) the cost of administering the test θ. The testing cost of e in T is therefore tcost(T, e) = ∑ θ∈Θ cost(θ). Note that we use sets notation because tests that appear several times are charged for only once. In addition, the model described by Turney (1995) handles two special test types, namely grouped and delayed tests.\nGrouped Tests. Some tests share a common cost, for which we would like to charge only once. Typically, the test also has an extra (possibly different) cost. For example, consider a tree path with tests like cholesterol level and glucose level. For both values to be measured, a blood test is needed. Taking blood samples to measure the cholesterol level clearly lowers\nthe cost of measuring the glucose level. Formally, each test possibly belongs to a group.2 If it’s the first test from the group to be administered, we charge for the full cost. If another test from the same group has already been administered earlier in the decision path, we charge only for the marginal cost.\nDelayed Tests. Sometimes the outcome of a test cannot be obtained immediately, e.g., lab test results. Such tests, called delayed tests, force us to wait until the outcome is available. Alternatively, Turney (1995) suggests taking into account all possible outcomes: when a delayed test is encountered, all the tests in the subtree under it are administered and charged for. Once the result of the delayed test is available, the prediction is at hand. One problem with this setup is that it follows all paths in the subtree, regardless of the outcome of non-delayed costs. Moreover, it is not possible to distinguish between the delays different tests impose: for example, one result might be ready after several minutes while another only after a few days. In this work we do not handle delayed tests, but we do explain how ACT can be modified to take them into account.\nAfter the test and misclassification costs have been measured, an important question remains: How should we combine them? Following Turney (1995), we assume that both cost types are given in the same scale. A more general model would require a utility function that combines both types. Qin, Zhang, and Zhang (2004) presented a method to handle the two kinds of cost scales by setting a maximal budget for one kind of cost and minimizing the other one. Alternatively, patient preferences can be elicited and summarized as a utility function (Lenert & Soetikno, 1997).\nNote that the algorithm we introduce in this paper can be adapted to any cost model. An important property of our cost-sensitive setup is that maximizing generalization accuracy, which is the goal of most existing learners, can be viewed as a special case: when accuracy is the only objective, test costs are ignored and misclassification cost is uniform."

      "heading" : "3. The ACT Algorithm",
      "text" : "ACT, our proposed anytime framework for induction of cost-sensitive decision trees, builds on the recently introduced LSID3 algorithm. LSID3 adopts the general top-down scheme for induction of decision trees (TDIDT): it starts from the entire set of training examples, partitions it into subsets by testing the value of an attribute, and then recursively builds subtrees. Unlike greedy inducers, LSID3 invests more time resources for making better split decisions. For every candidate split, LSID3 attempts to estimate the size of the resulting subtree were the split to take place. Following Occam’s razor (Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler, & Warmuth, 1987; Esmeir & Markovitch, 2007b), it favors the one with the smallest expected size.\nThe estimation is based on a biased sample of the space of trees rooted at the evaluated attribute. The sample is obtained using a stochastic version of ID3 (Quinlan, 1986), which we call SID3. In SID3, rather than choosing an attribute that maximizes the information gain ∆I (as in ID3), we choose the splitting attribute semi-randomly. The likelihood that an attribute will be chosen is proportional to its information gain. Due to its randomization,\n2. In this model each test may belong to a single group. However, it is easy to extend our work to allow tests that belong to several groups.\nrepeated invocations of SID3 result in different trees. For each candidate attribute a, LSID3 invokes SID3 r times to form a sample of r trees rooted at a, and uses the size of the smallest tree in the sample to evaluate a. Obviously, when r is larger, the resulting size estimations are expected to be more accurate, improving the final tree. Consider, for example, a 3-XOR concept with several additional irrelevant attributes. For LSID3 to prefer one of the relevant attributes at the root, one of the trees in the samples of the relevant attributes must be the smallest. The probability for this event increases with the increase in sample size.\nLSID3 is a contract anytime algorithm parameterized by r, the sample size. Additional time resources can be utilized by forming larger samples. Figure 3 lists the procedure for attribute selection as applied by LSID3. Let m = |E| be the number of examples and n = |A| be the number of attributes. The runtime complexity of LSID3 is O(rmn3). LSID3 was shown to exhibit good anytime behavior with diminishing returns. When applied to hard concepts, it produced significantly better trees than ID3 and C4.5.\nACT takes the same sampling approach as LSID3. The three major components of LSID3 that need to be replaced in order to adapt it for cost-sensitive problems are: (1) sampling the space of trees, (2) evaluating a tree, and (3) pruning a tree."

      "text" : "LISD3 uses SID3 to bias the samples towards small trees. In ACT, however, we would like to bias our sample towards low-cost trees. For this purpose, we designed a stochastic version of the EG2 algorithm, which attempts to build low cost trees greedily. In EG2, a tree is built top-down, and the test that maximizes ICF is chosen for splitting a node, where,\nICF (θ) = 2∆I(θ) − 1\n(cost (θ) + 1)w .\n∆I is the information gain (as in ID3). The parameter w ∈ [0, 1] controls the bias towards lower cost attributes. When w = 0, test costs are ignored and ICF relies solely\non the information gain. Larger values of w strengthen the effect of test costs on ICF. We discuss setting the value of w in Section 3.5.\nIn stochastic EG2 (SEG2), we choose splitting attributes semi-randomly, proportionally to their ICF. Because SEG2 is stochastic, we expect to be able to escape local minima for at least some of the trees in the sample. Figure 4 formalizes the attribute selection component in SEG2. To obtain a sample of size r, ACT uses EG2 once and SEG2 r − 1 times. EG2 and SEG2 are given direct access to context-based costs, i.e., if an attribute has already been tested, its cost is zero and if another attribute that belongs to the same group has been tested, a group discount is applied."

Occam’s razor states that given two consistent hypotheses, the smaller one is likely to be more accurate. Following Occam’s razor, LSID3 uses the tree size as a preference bias and favors splits that are expected to reduce its final size.\nIn a cost-sensitive setup, however, our goal is to minimize the expected total cost of classification. Therefore, rather than choosing an attribute that minimizes the size, we would like to choose one that minimizes the total cost. Given a decision tree, we need to come up with a procedure that estimates the expected cost of using the tree to classify a future case.

      "heading" : "3.2.2 Estimating Misclassification Costs",
      "text" : "How to go about estimating the cost of misclassification is not obvious. The tree size can no longer be used as a heuristic for predictive errors. Occam’s razor allows the comparison of two consistent trees but provides no means for estimating accuracy. Moreover, tree size is measured in a different currency than accuracy and hence cannot be easily incorporated in the cost function.\nRather than using the tree size, we propose a different estimator: the expected error (Quinlan, 1993). For a leaf with m training examples, of which s are misclassified, the expected error is defined as the upper limit on the probability for error, i.e., EE(m, s, cf) = U bincf (m, s), where cf is the confidence level and U\nbin is the upper limit of the confidence interval for binomial distribution. The expected error of a tree is the sum of the expected errors in its leaves.\nOriginally, the expected error was used by C4.5’s error-based pruning to predict whether a subtree performs better than a leaf. Although lacking a theoretical basis, it was shown experimentally to be a good heuristic. In ACT we use the expected error to approximate the misclassification cost. Assume a problem with |C| classes and a misclassification cost matrix M . Let c be the class label in a leaf l. Let ml be the total number of examples in l and mil be the number of examples in l that belong to class i. When the penalties for predictive errors are uniform (Mi,j = mc), the estimated misclassification cost in l is\nm̂cost (l) = EE(ml, ml − m c l , cf) · mc.\nIn a problem with nonuniform misclassification costs, mc should be replaced by the cost of the actual errors the leaf is expected to make. These errors are obviously unknown to the learner. One solution is to estimate each error type separately using confidence intervals for multinomial distribution and multiply it by the associated cost:\nm̂cost (l) = ∑\ni6=c\nUmulcf (ml, m i l, |C|) · mc.\nSuch approach, however, would result in an overly pessimistic approximation, mainly when there are many classes. Alternatively, we compute the expected error as in the uniform case and propose replacing mc by the weighted average of the penalty for classifying an instance as c while it belongs to another class. The weights are derived from the proportions\nmi l\nml−m c\nl\nusing a generalization of Laplace’s law of succession (Good, 1965, chap. 4):\nm̂cost (l) = EE(ml, ml − m c l , cf) ·\n∑\ni6=c\n( mil + 1\nml − m c l + |C| − 1\n· Mc,i\n) .\nNote that in a problem with C classes, the average is over C − 1 possible penalties because Mc,c = 0. Hence, in a problem with two classes c1, c2 if a leaf is marked as c1, mc\nwould be replaced by M1,2. When classifying a new instance, the expected misclassification cost of a tree T built from m examples is the sum of the expected misclassification costs in the leaves divided by m:\nm̂cost(T ) = 1\nm\n∑\nl∈L\nm̂cost(l),\nwhere L is the set of leaves in T . Hence, the expected total cost of T when classifying a single instance is:\n̂total(T, E) = ̂tcost(T, E) + m̂cost(T ).\nAn alternative approach that we intend to explore in future work is to estimate the cost of the sampled trees using the cost for a set-aside validation set. This approach is attractive mainly when the training set is large and one can afford setting aside a significant part of it."

To illustrate this let us consider a two-class problem with mc = 100$ (uniform) and 6 attributes, a1, . . . , a6, whose costs are 10$. The training data contains 400 examples, out of which 200 are positive and 200 are negative.\nAssume that we have to choose between a1 and a2, and that r = 1. Let the trees in Figure 7, denoted T1 and T2, be those sampled for a1 and a2 respectively. The expected error costs of T1 and T2 are: 3\nm̂cost(T1) = 1\n400 (4 · EE (100, 5, 0.25)) · 100$ =\n4 · 7.3\n400 · 100$ = 7.3$\nm̂cost(T2) = 1\n400 (2 · EE (50, 0, 0.25) · 100$ + 2 · EE (150, 50, 0.25) · 100$)\n= 2 · 1.4 + 2 · 54.1\n400 · 100$ = 27.7$\nWhen both test and error costs are involved, ACT considers their sum. Since the test cost of both trees is identical (20$), ACT would prefer to split on a1. If, however, the cost\n3. In this example we set cf to 0.25, as in C4.5. In Section 3.5 we discuss how to tune cf .\nof a1 were 40$, as in Figure 8, tcost(T1) would become 50$ and the total cost of T1 would become 57.3$, while that of T2 would remain 47.7$. Hence, in this case ACT would split on a2.\nTo illustrate how ACT handles nonuniform error penalties, let us assume that the cost of all attributes is again 10$, while the cost of a false positive (FP) is 1$ and the cost of a false negative (FN) is 199$. Let the trees in Figure 9, denoted T1 and T2, be those sampled for a1 and a2 respectively. As in the first example, only misclassification costs play a role because the test costs of both trees is the same. Although on average the misclassification\ncost is also 100$, ACT now evaluates these trees differently:\nm̂cost(T1) = 1\n400 (2 · EE (100, 5, 0.25) · 1$ + 2 · EE (100, 5, 0.25) · 199$)\n= 2 · 7.3 · 1$ + 2 · 7.3.1 · 199$\n400 = 7.3$\nm̂cost(T2) = 1\n400 (2 · EE (50, 0, 0.25) · 199$ + 2 · EE (100, 50, 0.25) · 1$)\n= 2 · 1.4 · 199$ + 2 · 54.1 · 1$\n400 = 1.7$\nTherefore, in the nonuniform setup, ACT would prefer a2.

Chickering, Meek, and Rounthwaite (2001) introduced several techniques for generating a small number of candidate split points dynamically with little overhead.

      "heading" : "3.4 Cost-Sensitive Pruning",
      "text" : "Pruning plays an important role in decision tree induction. In cost-insensitive environments, the main goal of pruning is to simplify the tree in order to avoid overfitting the training data. A subtree is pruned if the resulting tree is expected to yield a lower error.\nWhen test costs are taken into account, pruning has another important role: reducing test costs in a tree. Keeping a subtree is worthwhile only if its expected reduction in misclassification costs is larger than the cost of the tests in that subtree. If the misclassification cost is zero, it makes no sense to keep any split in the tree. If, on the other hand, the misclassification cost is much larger than the test costs, we would expect similar behavior to the cost-insensitive setup.\nTo handle this challenge, we propose a novel approach for cost-sensitive pruning. As in error-based pruning (Quinlan, 1993), we scan the tree bottom-up. Then we compare the expected total cost of each subtree to that of a leaf. If a leaf is expected to perform better, the subtree is pruned.\nThe cost of a subtree is estimated as described in Section 3.2. Formally, let E be the set of training examples that reach a subtree T , and let m be the size of E. Assume that s examples in E do not belong to the default class.4 Let L be the set of leaves in T . We\n4. If misclassification costs are uniform, the default class is the majority class. Otherwise, it is the class that minimizes the misclassification cost in the node.\nprune T into a leaf if:\n1\nm · EE(m, s, cf) · mc ≤ ̂tcost(T, E) +\n∑\nl∈L\nm̂cost(l).\nThe above assumes a uniform misclassification cost mc. In the case of nonuniform penalties, we multiply the expected error by the average misclassification cost.\nAn alternative approach for post-pruning is early stopping of the growing phase. For example, one could limit the depth of the tree, require a minimal number of examples in each child (as in C4.5), or prevent splitting nodes when the splitting criterion fails to exceed a predetermined threshold (as in DTMC). Obviously, any pre-pruning condition can also be applied as part of the post-pruning procedure. The advantage of post-pruning, however, is its ability to estimate the effect of a split on the entire subtree below it, and not only on its immediate successors (horizon effect).\nConsider for example the 2-XOR problem a ⊕ b. Splitting on neither a nor b would have a positive gain and hence the growing would be stopped. If no pre-pruning is allowed, the optimal tree would be found and would not be post-pruned because the utility of the splits is correctly measured. Frank (2000) reports a comprehensive study about pruning of decision trees, in which he compared pre- to post-pruning empirically in a cost-insensitive setup. His findings show that the advantage of post-pruning on a variety of UCI datasets is not significant. Because pre-pruning is computationally more efficient, Frank concluded that, in practice, it might be a viable alternative to post-pruning. Despite these results, we decided to use post-pruning in ACT, for the following reasons:\n1. Several concepts not represented in the UCI repository may appear in real-world problems. For example, parity functions naturally arise in real-world problems, such as the Drosophila survival concept (Page & Ray, 2003).\n2. When costs are involved, the horizon effect may appear more frequently because high costs may hide good splits.\n3. In our anytime setup the user is willing to wait longer in order to obtain a good tree. Since post-pruning takes even less time than the induction of a single greedy tree, the extra cost of post-pruning is minor.\nIn the future we plan to add a pre-pruning parameter which will allow early stopping when resources are limited. Another interesting direction for future work would be to postprune the final tree but pre-prune the lookahead trees that form the samples. This would reduce the runtime at the cost of less accurate estimations for the utility of each candidate split."

      "text" : "In addition to r, the sample size, ACT is parameterized by w, which controls the weight of the test costs in EG2, and cf , the confidence factor used both for pruning and for error estimation. ICET tunes w and cf using genetic search. In ACT we considered three different alternatives: (1) keeping EG2’s and C4.5’s default values w = 1 and cf = 0.25, (2) tuning\nthe values using cross-validation, and (3) setting the values a priori, as a function of the problem costs.\nWhile the first solution is the simplest, it does not exploit the potential of adapting the sampling mechanism to the specific problem costs. Although tuning the values using grid search would achieve good results, it may be costly in terms of runtime. For example, if we had 5 values for each parameter and used 5-fold cross-validation, we would need to run ACT 125 times for the sake of tuning alone. In our anytime setup this time could be invested to invoke ACT with a larger r and hence improve the results. Furthermore, the algorithm would not be able to output any valid solution before the tuning stage is finished. Alternatively, we could try to tune the parameters by invoking the much faster EG2, but the results would not be as good because the optimal values for EG2 are not necessarily good for ACT.\nThe third approach, which we chose for our experiments, is to set w and cf in advance, according to the problem specific costs. w is set inverse proportionally to the misclassification cost: a high misclassification cost results in a smaller w, reducing the effect of attribute costs on the split selection measure. The exact formula is:\nw = 0.5 + e−x,\nwhere x is the average misclassification cost (over all non-diagnoal entries in M) divided by TC, the cost if we take all tests. Formally,\nx =\n∑ i6=j Mi,j\n(|C| − 1) · |C| · TC .\nIn C4.5 the default value of cf is 0.25. Larger cf values result in less pruning. Smaller cf values lead to more aggressive pruning. Therefore, in ACT we set cf to a value in the range [0.2, 0.3]; the exact value depends on the problem cost. When test costs are dominant, we prefer aggressive pruning and hence a low value for cf . When test costs are negligible, we prefer to prune less. The same value of cf is also used to estimate the expected error. Again, when test costs are dominant, we can afford a pessimistic estimate of the error, but when misclassification costs are dominant, we would prefer that the estimate be closer to the error rate in the training data. The exact formula for setting cf is:\ncf = 0.2 + 0.05(1 + x − 1\nx + 1 )."

Nevertheless, to gain a wider perspective, we have developed an automatic method that assigns costs to existing datasets. The method is parameterized with:\n1. cr, the cost range.\n2. g, the number of desired groups as a percentage of the number of attributes. In a problem with |A| attributes, there are g · |A| groups. The probability for an attribute to belong to each of these groups is 1g·|A|+1 , as is the probability for it not to belong to any of the groups.\n3. d, the number of delayed tests as a percentage of the number of attributes.\n4. ϕ, the group discount as a percentage of the minimal cost in the group (to ensure positive costs).\n5. ρ, a binary flag which determines whether costs are drawn randomly, uniformly (ρ = 0) or semi-randomly (ρ = 1): the cost of a test is drawn proportionally to its information gain, simulating a common case where valuable features tend to have higher costs. In this case we assume that the cost comes from a truncated normal distribution, with the mean being proportional to the gain.\nUsing this method, we assigned costs to 25 datasets: 20 arbitrarily chosen UCI datasets6 and 5 datasets that represent hard concepts and have been used in previous research. Appendix A gives detailed descriptions of these datasets.\nDue to the randomization in the cost assignment process, the same set of parameters defines an infinite space of possible costs. For each of the 25 datasets we sampled this space 4 times with\ncr = [1, 100], g = 0.2, d = 0, ϕ = 0.8, ρ = 1.\nThese parameters were chosen in an attempt to assign costs in a manner similar to that in which real costs are assigned. In total, we have 105 datasets: 5 assigned by human experts and 100 with automatically generated costs.7\nCost-insensitive learning algorithms focus on accuracy and therefore are expected to perform well when testing costs are negligible relative to misclassification costs. However, when testing costs are significant, ignoring them would result in expensive classifiers. Therefore, evaluating cost-sensitive learners requires a wide spectrum of misclassification costs. For each problem out of the 105, we created 5 instances, with uniform misclassification costs mc = 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000. Later on, we also consider nonuniform misclassification costs."

However, the original pseudo-code does not support continuous attributes and multiple class problems. We added support to continuous attributes, as in C4.5’s dynamic binary-cut discretization, with the cost reduction replacing gain ratio for selecting cutting points. The extension to multiple class problems was straightforward. Note that DTMC does not post-prune the trees but only pre-prunes them.\n• ICET : ICET has been reimplemented following the detailed description given by Turney (1995). To verify the results of the reimplementation, we compared them with those reported in the literature. We followed the same experimental setup and used the same 5 datasets. The results are indeed similar: the basic version of ICET achieved an average cost of 50.8 in our reimplementation vs. 50 reported originally. One possible reason for the slight difference may be that the initial population of the genetic algorithm is randomized, as are the genetic operators and the process of partitioning the data into training, validating, and testing sets. In his paper, Turney introduced a seeded version of ICET, which includes the true costs in the initial population, and reported it to perform better than the unseeded version. Therefore, we use the seeded version for our comparison. The other parameters of ICET are the default ones."

To overcome these problems, Turney suggests normalizing the average cost of classification by dividing it by the standard cost. Let TC be the cost if we take all tests. Let fi be the frequency of class i in the data. The error if the response is always class i is therefore (1 − fi). The standard cost is defined as\nTC + mini (1 − fi) · maxi,j (Mi,j) .\nThe standard cost is an approximation for the maximal cost in a given problem. It consists of two components: the maximal test cost and the misclassification cost if the classifier achieves only the baseline accuracy (e.g., a majority-based classifier when error costs are uniform). Because some classifiers may perform even worse than the baseline accuracy, the standard cost is not strictly an upper bound on real cost. In most of our experiments, however, it has not been exceeded."

No significant difference was found in the remaining runs. In this setup ACT was able to produce very small trees, sometimes consisting of one node; the accuracy of the learned model was ignored in this setup. ICET, on the contrary, produced, for some of the datasets, larger and more costly trees. DTMC achieved the best results, and outperformed ACT 14 times. The Wilcoxon test also indicates that DTMC is better than ACT and that ACT is better than ICET. Further investigation showed that for a few datasets ACT produced unnecessarily larger trees. We believe that a better tuning of cf would improve ACT in this scenario by making the pruning more aggressive.\nAt the other extreme, when misclassification costs dominate (mc = 10000), the performance of DTMC is worse than ACT and ICET. The t-test indicates that ACT was significantly better than ICET 24 times and significantly worse only 7 times. According to the Wilcoxon test with α = 5%, the difference between ACT and ICET is not significant. Taking α > 5.05%, however, would turn the result in favor of ACT. Observe that DTMC, the winner when mc = 100, becomes the worst algorithm when mc = 10000. One reason\nfor this phenomenon is that DTMC, as introduced by Ling et al. (2004), does not perform post-pruning, although doing so might improve accuracy in some domains.\nThe above two extremes are less interesting: for the first we could use an algorithm that always outputs a tree of size 1 while for the second we could use cost-insensitive learners. The middle range, where mc ∈ {500, 1000, 5000}, requires that the learner carefully balance the two types of cost. In these cases ACT has the lowest average cost and the largest number of t-test wins. Moreover, the Wilcoxon test indicates that it is superior. ICET is the second best method. As reported by Turney (1995), ICET is clearly better than the greedy methods EG2, IDX, and CSID3.\nNote that EG2, IDX, and CSID3, which are insensitive to misclassification cost, produced the same trees for all values of mc. These trees, however, are judged differently with the change in misclassification cost.\nFigure 11 illustrates the differences between ICET and ACT for mc = 100, 1000, 10000. Each point represents one of the 105 datasets. The x-axis represents the cost of ICET while the y-axis represents that of ACT. The dashed line indicates equality. As we can see, the\nmajority of points are below the equality line, indicating that ACT performs better. For mc = 10000 we can see that there are points located close to the x-axis but with large x value. These points represent the difficult domains, such as XOR, which ICET could not learn but ACT could."

      "text" : "When misclassification costs are low, an optimal algorithm would produce a very shallow tree. When misclassification costs are dominant, an optimal algorithm would produce a highly accurate tree. As we can see, ACT’s normalized cost increases with the increase in misclassification cost. While it is relatively easy to produce shallow trees, some concepts are not easily learnable and even cost-insensitive algorithms fail to achieve perfect accuracy on them. Hence, as the importance of accuracy increases, the normalized cost increases too because the predictive errors affect it more dramatically.\nTo learn more about the effect of misclassification costs on accuracy, we compare the accuracy of the built trees for different misclassification costs. Figure 12 shows the results. An important property of DTMC, ICET, and ACT is their ability to compromise on accuracy when needed. They produce inaccurate trees when accuracy is insignificant and much more accurate trees when the penalty for error is high. ACT’s flexibility, however, is more noteworthy: from the second least accurate method it becomes the most accurate one.\nInterestingly, when accuracy is extremely important, both ICET and ACT achieve even better accuracy than C4.5. The reason is their non-greedy nature. ICET performs an implicit lookahead by reweighting attributes according to their importance. ACT performs lookahead by sampling the space of subtrees before every split. Of the two, the results indicate that ACT’s lookahead is more efficient in terms of accuracy. DTMC is less accurate than C4.5. The reason is the different split selection criterion and the different pruning mechanism.\nIn comparison to our anytime cost insensitive algorithm LSID3, ACT produced less accurate trees when mc was relatively low. When mc was set to 5000, however, ACT achieved comparable accuracy to LSID3 and slightly outperformed it for mc = 10000. Statistical tests found the differences between the accuracy of the two algorithms in this\ncase to be insignificant. ACT’s small advantage on some of the datasets indicates that, for some problems, expected error is a better heuristic than tree size for maximizing accuracy."

      "text" : "Both ICET and ACT, like other typical anytime algorithms, perform better with increased resource allocation. ICET is expected to exploit the extra time by producing more generations and hence better tuning the parameters for the final invocation of EG2. ACT can use the extra time to acquire larger samples and hence achieve better cost estimations.\nTo examine the anytime behavior of ICET and ACT, we ran them on 4 problems, namely Breast-cancer-20, Monks-1, Multi-XOR, and XOR5, with exponentially increasing time allocation. mc was set to 5000. ICET was run with 2, 4, 8, . . . generations and ACT with a sample size of 1, 2, 4, . . .. As in the fixed-time comparison, we used 4 instances for each problem. Figure 13 plots the results averaged over the 4 instances. We also included the results for the greedy methods EG2 and DTMC.\nThe results show good anytime behavior of both ICET and ACT: generally it is worthwhile to allocate more time. ACT dominates ICET for the four domains and is able to produce less costly trees in shorter time.\nOne advantage of ACT over ICET is that it is able to consider the context in which an attribute is judged. ICET, on the contrary, reassigns the cost of the attributes globally: an\nattribute cannot be assigned a high cost in one subtree and a low cost in another. The MultiXOR dataset exemplifies a concept whose attributes are important only in one sub-concept. The concept is composed of four sub-concepts, each of which relies on different attributes (see Appendix A for further details). As we expected, ACT outperforms ICET significantly because the latter cannot assign context-based costs. Allowing ICET to produce more and more generations (up to 128) does not result in trees comparable to those obtained by ACT."

As explained in Section 3, the ACT algorithm can also handle complex misclassification cost matrices where the penalty for one type of error might be higher than the penalty for another type. Our next experiment examines ACT in the nonuniform scenario. Let FP denote the penalty for a false positive and FN the penalty for false negative. When there are more than 2 classes, we split the classes into 2 equal groups according to their order (or randomly if no order exists). We then assign a penalty FP for misclassifying an instance that belongs to the first group and FN for one that belongs to the second group.\nTo obtain a wide view, we vary the ratio between FP and FN and also examine different absolute values. Table 3 and Figure 15 give the average results. Table 4 lists the number of t-test significant wins each algorithm achieved. It is easy to see that ACT consistently outperforms the other methods.\nInterestingly, the graphs are slightly asymmetric. The reason could be that for some datasets, for example medical ones, it is more difficult to reduce negative errors than positive ones, or vice versa. A similar phenomenon is reported by Turney (1995).\nThe highest cost for all algorithms is observed when FP = FN because, when the ratio between FP and FN is extremely large or extremely small, the learner can easily build a small tree whose leaves are labeled with the class that minimizes costs. When misclassification costs are more balanced, however, the learning process becomes much more complicated."

      "heading" : "5. Related Work",
      "text" : "In addition to the works referred to earlier in this paper, several related works warrant discussion here.\nCost-sensitive trees have been the subject of many research efforts. Several works proposed learning algorithms that consider different misclassification costs (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, & Stone, 1984; Pazzani, Merz, Murphy, Ali, Hume, & Brunk, 1994; Provost & Buchanan, 1995; Bradford, Kunz, Kohavi, Brunk, & Brodley, 1998; Domingos, 1999; Elkan, 2001; Zadrozny, Langford, & Abe, 2003; Lachiche & Flach, 2003; Abe, Zadrozny, & Langford, 2004; Vadera, 2005; Margineantu, 2005; Zhu, Wu, Khoshgoftaar, & Yong, 2007; Sheng & Ling, 2007). These methods, however, do not consider test costs and hence are appropriate mainly for domains where test costs are not a constraint.\nDavis, Ha, Rossbach, Ramadan, and Witchel (2006) presented a greedy cost-sensitive decision tree algorithm for forensic classification: the problem of classifying irreproducible events. In this setup, they assume that all tests that might be used for testing must be acquired and hence charged for before classification.\nOne way to exploit additional time when searching for a less costly tree is to widen the search space. Bayer-Zubek and Dietterich (2005) formulated the cost-sensitive learning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and used a systematic search algorithm based on the AO* heuristic search procedure to solve the MDP. To make AO* efficient, the algorithm uses a two-step lookahead based heuristic. Such limited lookahead is more informed than immediate heuristics but still insufficient for complex domains and might cause the search to go astray (Esmeir & Markovitch, 2007a). The algorithm was shown to output better diagnostic policies than several greedy methods using reasonable resources. An optimal solution, however, could not always be found due to time and memory limits. A nice property of the algorithm is that it can serve as an anytime algorithm by computing\nthe best complete policy found so far. Its anytime behavior, nevertheless, is problematic because policies that are optimal with respect to the train data tend to overfit. As a result, the performance will eventually start to degrade.\nArnt and Zilberstein (2005) tackled the problem of time and cost sensitive classification (TCSC). In TCSC, the utility of labeling an instance depends not only on the correctness of the labeling, but also the amount of time it takes. Therefore the total cost function has an additional component, which reflects the time needed to measure an attribute. Typically, is has a super-linear form: the cost of a quick result is small and fairly constant, but as the waiting time increases, the time cost grows at an increasing rate. The problem is further complicated when a sequence of time-sensitive classification instances is considered, where time spent administering tests for one case can adversely affect the costs of future instances. Arnt and Zilberstein suggest solving these problems by extending the decision theoretic approach introduced by Bayer-Zubek and Dietterich (2005). In our work, we assume that the time it takes to administer a test is incorporated into its cost. In the future, we intend to extend our framework to support time-sensitive classification, both for individual cases and for sequences.\nFan, Lee, Stolfo, and Miller (2000) studied the problem of cost-sensitive intrusion detection systems (IDS). The goal is to maximize security while minimizing costs. Each prediction (action) has a cost. Features are categorized into three cost levels according to amount of information needed to compute their values. To reduce the cost of an IDS, high cost rules are considered only when the predictions of low cost rules are not sufficiently accurate.\nCosts are also involved in the learning phase, during example acquisition and during model learning. The problem of budgeted learning has been studied by Lizotte, Madani, and Greiner (2003). There is a cost associated with obtaining each attribute value of a training example, and the task is to determine what attributes to test given a budget.\nA related problem is active feature-value acquisition. In this setup one tries to reduce the cost of improving accuracy by identifying highly informative instances. Melville, SaarTsechansky, Provost, and Mooney (2004) introduced an approach in which instances are selected for acquisition based on the accuracy of the current model and its confidence in the prediction.\nGreiner, Grove, and Roth (2002) were pioneers in studying classifiers that actively decide what tests to administer. They defined an active classifier as a classifier that given a partially specified instance, returns either a class label or a strategy that specifies which test should be performed next. Greiner et al. also analyzed the theoretical aspects of learning optimal active classifiers using a variant of the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) model. They showed that the task of learning optimal cost-sensitive active classifiers is often intractable. However, this task is shown to be achievable when the active classifier is allowed to perform only (at most) a constant number of tests, where the limit is provided before learning. For this setup they proposed taking a dynamic programming approach to build trees of at most depth d.\nOur setup assumed that we are charged for acquiring each of the feature values of the test cases. The term test strategy (Sheng, Ling, & Yang, 2005) describes the process of feature values acquisition: which values to query for and in what order. Several test strategies have been studied, including sequential, single batch and multiple batch (Sheng et al., 2006),\neach of which corresponds to a different diagnosis policy. These strategies are orthogonal to our work because they assume a given decision tree.\nBilgic and Getoor (2007) tackled the problem of feature subset selection when costs are involved. The objective is to minimize the sum of the information acquisition cost and the misclassification cost. Unlike greedy approaches that compute the value of features one at a time, they used a novel data structure called the value of information lattice (VOILA), which exploits dependencies between missing features and makes it possible to share information value computations between different feature subsets possible. VIOLA was shown empirically to achieve dramatic cost improvements without the prohibitive computational costs of comprehensive search."

      "text" : "Machine learning techniques are increasingly being used to produce a wide range of classifiers for complex real-world applications that involve nonuniform testing and misclassification costs. The increasing complexity of these applications poses a real challenge to resource management during learning and classification. In this work we introduced a novel framework for operating in such complex environments. Our framework has four major advantages:\n• It uses a non-greedy approach to build a decision tree and therefore is able to overcome local minima problems.\n• It evaluates entire trees during the search; thus, it can be adjusted to any cost scheme that is defined over trees.\n• It exhibits good anytime behavior and allows learning speed to be traded for classification costs. In many applications we are willing to allocate more time than we would allocate to greedy methods. Our proposed framework can exploit such extra resources.\n• The sampling process can easily be parallelized and the method benefit from distributed computer power.\nTo evaluate ACT we have designed an extensive set of experiments with a wide range of costs. Since there are only a few publicly available cost-oriented datasets, we designed a parametric scheme that automatically assigns costs for existing datasets. The experimental results show that ACT is superior to ICET and DTMC, existing cost-sensitive algorithms that attempt to minimize test costs and misclassification costs simultaneously. Significance tests found the differences to be statistically strong. ACT also exhibited good anytime behavior: with the increase in time allocation, the cost of the learned models decreased.\nACT is a contract anytime algorithm that requires its sample size to be predetermined. In the future we intend to convert ACT into an interruptible anytime algorithm by adopting the IIDT general framework (Esmeir & Markovitch, 2007a). In addition, we plan to apply monitoring techniques (Hansen & Zilberstein, 2001) for optimal scheduling of ACT and to examine other strategies for evaluating subtrees."

Multiplexer: The multiplexer task was used by several researchers for evaluating classifiers (e.g., Quinlan, 1993). An instance is a series of bits of length a + 2a, where a is a positive integer. The first a bits represent an index into the remaining bits and the label of the instance is the value of the indexed bit. In our experiments we considered the 20-Multiplexer (a = 4). The dataset contains 500 randomly drawn instances.\n2. Boolean XOR: Parity-like functions are known to be problematic for many learning algorithms. However, they naturally arise in real-world data, such as the Drosophila survival concept (Page & Ray, 2003). We considered XOR of five variables with five additional irrelevant attributes.\n3. Numeric XOR: A XOR based numeric dataset that has been used to evaluate learning algorithms (e.g., Baram, El-Yaniv, & Luz, 2003). Each example consists of values for x and y coordinates. The example is labeled 1 if the product of x and y is positive, and −1 otherwise. We generalized this domain for three dimensions and added irrelevant variables to make the concept harder.\n4. Multi-XOR / Multi-AND-OR: These concepts are defined over 11 binary attributes. In both cases the target concept is composed of several subconcepts, where the first two attributes determines which of them is considered. The other 10 attributes are used to form the subconcepts. In the Multi-XOR dataset, each subconcept is an XOR, and in the Multi-AND-OR dataset, each subconcept is either AND or OR."

Typically, entries on the main diagonal of a classification cost matrix (no error) are all zero. When classifying an example e using a tree T , we propagate e down the tree along a single path from the root of T to one of its leaves. Let Θ(T, e) be the set of tests along this path. We denote by cost(θ) the cost of administering the test θ. The testing cost of e in T is therefore tcost(T, e) = ∑ θ∈Θ cost(θ).

The increasing complexity of these applications poses a real challenge to resource management during learning and classification. In this work we introduce ACT (anytime cost-sensitive tree learner), a novel framework for operating in such complex environments. ACT is an anytime algorithm that allows learning time to be increased in return for lower classification costs. It builds a tree top-down and exploits additional time resources to obtain better estimations for the utility of the different candidate splits. Using sampling techniques, ACT approximates the cost of the subtree under each candidate split and favors the one with a minimal cost. As a stochastic algorithm, ACT is expected to be able to escape local minima, into which greedy methods may be trapped. Experiments with a variety of datasets were conducted to compare ACT to the state-of-the-art cost-sensitive tree learners. The results show that for the majority of domains ACT produces significantly less costly trees. ACT also exhibits good anytime behavior with diminishing returns.",
