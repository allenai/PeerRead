      "text" : "Non-sentential utterances (NSUs) are utterances that lack a complete sentential form but whose meaning can be inferred from the dialogue context, such as “OK”, “where?”, “probably at his apartment”. The interpretation of non-sentential utterances is an important problem in computational linguistics since they constitute a frequent phenomena in dialogue and they are intrinsically context-dependent. The interpretation of NSUs is the task of retrieving their full semantic content from their form and the dialogue context.\nNSUs also come in a wide variety of forms and functions and classifying them in the right category is a prerequisite to their interpretation. The first half of this thesis is devoted to the NSU classification task. Our work builds upon Fernández et al. (2007) which present a series of machine-learning experiments on the classification of NSUs. We extended their approach with a combination of new features and semi-supervised learning techniques. The empirical results presented in this thesis show a modest but significant improvement over the state-of-the-art classification performance.\nThe consecutive, yet independent, problem is how to infer an appropriate semantic representation of such NSUs on the basis of the dialogue context. Fernández (2006) formalizes this task in terms of “resolution rules” built on top of the Type Theory with Records (TTR), a theoretical framework for dialogue context modeling (Ginzburg, 2012). We argue that logic-based formalisms, such as TTR, have a number of shortcomings when dealing with conversational data, which often include partially observable knowledge and nondeterministic phenomena. An alternative to address these issues is to rely on probabilistic modeling of the dialogue context. Our work is focused on the reimplementation of the resolution rules from Fernández (2006) with a probabilistic account of the dialogue state. The probabilistic rules formalism (Lison, 2014) is particularly suited for this task because, similarly to the framework developed by Ginzburg (2012) and Fernández (2006), it involves the specification of update rules on the variables of the dialogue state to capture the dynamics of the conversation. However, the probabilistic rules can also encode probabilistic knowledge, thereby providing a principled account of ambiguities in the NSU resolution process. In the second part of this thesis, we present our proof-of-concept framework for NSU resolution using probabilistic rules.\nv"

      "text" : "The past two years have been utterly intense, but beautiful nonetheless. In all my wandering around the Earth, first in Melbourne then in Oslo, I have learned an incredible amount of things and met as many interesting people. I have studied hard, explored the world, suffered homesickness and experienced many wonderful moments. It has been an exiting time and now, at the finishing line, I am walking towards the end with a smile on my face. For those opportunities I am grateful to my alma mater Sapienza which, despite all the difficulties, gave me also many positive memories.\nThis thesis is the product of the period I spent at University of Oslo under the supervision of Dr. Pierre Lison. Pierre has not only been a great supervisor but he has also been my mentor. He has taught me an uncountable number of things. He introduced me to the research on dialogue and proposed the topic of non-sentential utterances in the first place. My collaboration with Pierre has also led to my very first scientific publication at the SemDial 2015 in Göteborg. I can safely say that writing this thesis would not have been possible without his guidance. For these and many other reasons I want to thank him and wish him all the best. I also want to thank all the Language Technology Group at University of Oslo for their hospitality and for the many (or perhaps too few) happy days we spent together.\nA thankful note to all my friends too, who support me everyday of my life, even (and especially) when I am not around. In particular, a big thank you to all my friends and colleagues from the course in Engineering in Computer Science with whom I walked side by side for all these years. However, a special thanks goes to my estimate colleague Alessandro Ronca who has practically been my moral supporter as well as my personal reviewer.\nLast but not least, I want to express my gratitude to my parents and all my family who have always encouraged me to go beyond my own limits (even if sometimes I went perhaps too far away) and never stopped believing in me.\nRome, 22th of October 2015\nPaolo Dragone\nvii"

      "text" : "In dialogue, utterances do not always take the form of complete sentences. Utterances may sometimes lack some constituents – subject, verb or complements – because they can be understood from the previous utterances or other contextual information. These fragmentary utterances are often called non-sentential utterances (NSUs). The following are some examples from the British National Corpus:\n(1.1) a: How do you actually feel about that?\nb: Not too happy.\n[BNC: JK8 168–169]1\n(1.2) a: They wouldn’t do it, no.\nb: Why?\n[BNC: H5H 202–203]\n(1.3) a: So will the tape last for the whole two hours?\nb: Yes, apparently.\n[BNC: J9A 76–77]\n(1.4) a: Right disk number four?\nb: Three.\n[BNC: HDH 377–378]\nWe can understand without effort the meaning of the NSUs in the short dialogues above, even though they do not have the form of full sentences. We can easily make sense of them by extrapolating their meaning from the surrounding context, which for the above examples is given by the preceding utterance. Other possible contextual factors that affect the intended meaning of the NSUs are, for instance, the history of the dialogue, the shared environment of the conversational participants, their common knowledge and so on. From a computational linguistic perspective, making sense of this kind of utterances is a difficult problem because it involves the formalization of a robust theory of dialogue context.\n1This notation indicates the file name and the line numbers of the portion of dialogues in the British National Corpus.\n1\nMoreover, NSUs are a large variety of phenomena that need to be treated in different ways. Fernández and Ginzburg (2002) identify 15 different types of NSUs. One of the problems that must be addressed to make sense of NSUs is determining their type. One possible way is to classify NSUs using machine learning, as previously experimented by Fernández et al. (2007).\nTo interpret a given NSU, one also has to resolve its meaning i.e. construct an highlevel semantic representation of the NSU by extracting the relevant information from the dialogue context. To select the right resolution procedure for the given NSU, one needs first to determine its type. That is why the two task are connected. However, they can still be formalized and employed independently."

      "heading" : "1.1 Motivation",
      "text" : "Non-sentential utterances are interesting in many ways. First of all, they are very frequent in dialogue. According to Fernández and Ginzburg (2002) and related works, the frequency of NSUs in the dialogue transcripts of the British National Corpus is about 10% of the total number of utterances. However, this number may vary greatly if one takes into account a larger variety of phenomena or different dialogue domains e.g. Schlangen (2003) estimates the frequency of NSUs to be 20% of the total number of utterances.\nDespite their ubiquity, the semantic content of NSUs is often difficult to extract automatically. Non-sentential utterances are indeed intrinsically dependent on the dialogue context. It is impossible to make sense of them without accessing to the surrounding context. Their high context-dependency makes their interpretation a difficult problem from both a theoretical and computational point of view.\nNSUs form a wide range of linguistic phenomena that need to be considered in the formulation of a theory of dialogue context. Only few previous works tackled this problem directly and the majority of them take place in theoretical semantics of dialogue without addressing the possible applications. This means that the interpretation of NSUs is still an understudied problem, making them possibly an even more interesting subject."

      "text" : "Our work follows two parallel paths. On one hand we address the problem of the classification of NSUs by extending the work of Fernández et al. (2007). On the other hand we propose a novel approach to the resolution of NSUs using probabilistic rules (Lison, 2015).\nThe classification task is needed to select the resolution procedure but it is nonetheless an independent problem and it can arise in many different situations. Our contribution to this problem is a small but significant improvement over the accuracy of the previous works as well as the exploration of one way to tackle the scarcity of labeled data.\n2\nOur work on the resolution of NSUs takes inspiration from Fernández (2006) and Ginzburg (2012) which provide the theoretical background for our study. Their framework is however purely logic-based therefore it can have some drawbacks in dealing with raw conversational data which often contains hidden or partially observable variables. To this end a probabilistic account of the dialogue state is preferable. In our work we implemented a new approach to NSU resolution based on the probabilistic rules formalism of Lison (2015). Probabilistic rules are similar, in some way, to the rules formalized by Ginzburg (2012), as both express updates on the dialogue state given a set of conditions. However, probabilistic rules can also take into account probabilistic knowledge, thereby making them more suited to deal with the uncertainty often associated with conversational data. Our work does not aim to provide a full theory of NSU resolution but rather be a proof-of-concept for the resolution of NSUs via the probabilistic rules formalism. Nevertheless we detail a large set of NSU resolution rules based on the probabilistic rules formalism and provide an actual implementation of a dialogue system for NSU resolution using the OpenDial toolkit (Lison and Kennington, 2015), which can be the baseline reference for future developments.\nOur work for this thesis has produced the following publications:\n• Paolo Dragone and Pierre Lison.

We discuss briefly the Type Theory with Records, the semantic representation of utterances and the update rules on the dialogue context.

      "text" : "From a linguistic perspective, Non-Sentential Utterances – also known as fragments – has been historically an umbrella term for many elliptical phenomena that often take place in dialogue. In order to give a definition of Non-Sentential Utterances ourselves, we shall start by quoting the definition given by Fernández (2006):\n“In a broad sense, non-sentential utterances are utterances that do not have the form of a full sentence according to most traditional grammars, but that nevertheless convey a complete sentential meaning, usually a proposition or a question.”\nThis is indeed a very general definition, whereas a perhaps simpler approach is taken by Ginzburg (2012) which defines NSUs as “utterances without an overt predicate”. The minimal clausal structure of a sentence in English (as in many other languages) is composed of at least a noun phrase and a verb phrase. However, in dialogue the clausal structure is often truncated in favor of shorter sentences that can be understood by inferring their meaning from the surrounding context. We are interested in those utterances that, despite the lack of a complete clausal structure, convey a well-defined meaning given the dialogue context.\nThe context of an NSU can comprise any variable in the dialogue context but it usually suffice to consider only the antecedent of the NSU. The “antecedent” of an NSU is the utterance in the dialogue history that can be used to infer its underspecified semantic content. For instance, the NSU in (2.1) can be interpreted as “Paul went to his apartment” by extracting its semantic content from the antecedent. Generally, it is possible to understand the meaning of an NSU by looking at its antecedent.\n(2.1) a: Where did Paul go?\nb: To his apartment.\n5\nIt is often the case that an NSU and its antecedent present a certain grade of parallelism. Usually the meaning of an NSU is associated to a certain aspect of the antecedent. As described in Ginzburg (2012), the parallelism between an NSU and its antecedent can be of syntactic, semantic or phonological nature. The NSU in (2.1) presents syntactic parallelism – the use of “his” is syntactically constrained by the fact that Paul is a male individual – as well as semantic – the content of an NSU is a location as constrained by the where interrogative. This parallelism is one of the properties of NSUs that can be exploited in their interpretation (more details in Chapter 4). Even though it is often the case, the antecedent of an NSU is not always the preceding utterance, especially in multi-party dialogues."

      "heading" : "2.1.1 A taxonomy of NSUs",
      "text" : "As we briefly mentioned in Chapter 1, non-sentential utterances come in a large variety of forms. We can categorize NSUs on the basis of their form and their intended meaning. For instance NSUs can be affirmative or negative answers to polar questions, requests for clarification or corrections.\nIn order to classify the NSUs, we use a taxonomy defined by Fernández and Ginzburg (2002). This is a wide-coverage taxonomy resulting from a corpus study on a portion of the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000). Table 2.1 contains a summary of the taxonomy with an additional categorization of the classes by their function, as defined by Fernández (2006) then refined by Ginzburg (2012).\nOther taxonomies of NSUs are available from previous works by e.g. Schlangen (2003), but we opted for the one from Fernández and Ginzburg (2002) because it has been used in an extensive machine learning experiment by Fernández et al. (2007) and it is also used in the theory of Ginzburg (2012), which is our reference for the resolution part of our investigation. A detailed comparison of this taxonomy and other ones is given by Fernández (2006), which also details the corpus study on the BNC that led to the definition of this taxonomy.\nFollows a brief description of all the classes with some examples.

One way to interpret NSUs is developed by Fernández (2006), in turn based on Schlangen (2003), and it is formed by to consecutive steps, namely the classification and the resolution of the NSUs. The first step for the interpretation of an NSU is its classification i.e. finding its class according to the taxonomy described in Section 2.1.1. As demonstrated in Fernández et al. (2007), we can infer the class of an NSU using machine learning, i.e. we can train a classifier on the corpus detailed in Section 2.1.2 and use it to classify unseen NSU instances. The type of an NSU is used to determine the right resolution procedure to use. The resolution of an NSU is the task of recovering the full clausal meaning from their incomplete form on the basis of contextual information. Fernández (2006) describes a resolution procedure in terms of rules that, given some preconditions on the antecedent and other elements of the dialogue states, builds the semantic representation of the NSU. This approach to the resolution of NSUs has been the basis of several implementations of dialogue systems handling the resolution of NSUs such as Ginzburg et al. (2007) and Purver (2006).\nExtending the interpretation problem to raw conversational data we need also a way to “detect” an NSU i.e. decide whether an utterance should be considered as an NSU in the first place. Since this is not our direct concern, we employ in our experiments a simple set of heuristics to distinguish between NSU and non-NSU utterances (see Section 3.5.1)."

Rules that are particularly interesting with respect to our work are those that handle queries and assertions as well as the ones that describe the dynamics of QUD and Facts.\nThe following rule describes how QUD is incremented when a question is posed: pre : q : Question LatestMove = Ask(spkr, addr, q) : IllocProp  effects : [ qud = 〈 q, pre.qud 〉 : poset(Question) ] \n15\nAs argued above, issues are also raised by assertions, as realized by the following rule: pre : p : Prop LatestMove = Assert(spkr, addr, p) : IllocProp  effects : [ qud = 〈 p?, pre.qud 〉 : poset(Question) ] \nThe act of answering to a question is nothing else than asserting a proposition that resolves such a question. As a consequence the other speaker can either raise another issue related to the previous one or accept the fact that the issue has been resolved. The acceptance move is realized in the following way: pre :  p : Prop LatestMove = Assert(spkr, addr, p) : IllocProp qud = 〈p?, pre.qud 〉 : poset(Question)  effects :  spkr = pre.addr : Ind addr = pre.spkr : Ind\nLatestMove = Accept(spkr, addr, p) : IllocProp\n  The speaker can also query the addressee with a Check move in order to ask for an explicit acknowledgment (Confirm) to a question-resolving assertion5. Acceptance and confirmation lead to an update of Facts and to a “downdate” of the QUD i.e. the removal of the resolved questions in QUD: pre :  p : Prop LatestMove = Accept(spkr, addr, p) ∨ Confirm(spkr, addr, p) : IllocProp qud = 〈p?, pre.qud 〉 : poset(Question)  effects :\nfacts = pre.facts ∪ { p } : Set(Prop) qud = NonResolve(pre.qud, facts) : poset(Question) \n\nWhile QUD represents the unresolved issues that have been introduced in the dialogue, Facts contains all the issues that have been resolved instead. That is why their update rules are closely related. The function NonResolve in the above rule checks for any resolved issues by the just updated facts and leave the unresolved ones into QUD.\n5The rules for the Check and Confirm moves are omitted for brevity.\n16"

This is partially the reason why we explored this strategy as well as other advantages that will be discussed in Chapter 4.\nWe based our work on the probabilistic rules formalism developed by Lison (2012).

A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph i.e. a direct graph that does not contain cycles (two random variables cannot be mutually dependent). Given the random variables X1, . . . , Xn in a Bayesian network, we are interested in the joint probability distribution P (X1, . . . , Xn) of those variables. In general, the size of the joint distribution is exponential in the number n of variables therefore it is difficult to estimate when n grows. In the case of Bayesian networks we can exploit the conditional independence to reduce the complexity of the joint distribution. Given three random variables X, Y and Z, X and Y are said to be conditionally independent given Z if and only if (for all combinations of values) P (X,Y |Z) = P (X|Z)P (Y |Z). We can define for a variable Xi in X1, . . . , Xn the set parents(Xi) such that if there is a direct edge from Xj to Xi then Xj ∈ parents(Xi). Given a topological ordering7 of the variables (nodes) of the Bayesian network, a variable Xi is conditionally independent from all its predecessor that are not in parents(Xi) therefore the joint probability distribution can be defined as follows:\nP (X1, . . . , Xn) = n∏ i=1 P (Xi|parents(Xi))\nFor each variable Xi, P (Xi|parents(Xi)) is the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of Xi. The CPDs together with the directed graph fully determine the joint distribution of the Bayesian network.\n6A type of probabilistic models represented by graphs. 7A topological ordering is an ordering of the nodes such that for every two nodes u and v connected by a directed edge from u to v, u appears before v in such ordering. A topological ordering can only be defined on directed acyclic graphs.\n17\nThe network can be used for inference by querying the distribution of a subset of variables, usually given some evidence. Given a subset of variables Q ⊂ X and an assignment of values e of the evidence variables, the query is the posterior distribution P (Q|e). To compute the posterior distribution one needs an inference algorithm. Such algorithm can be exact – such as the variable elimination algorithm (Zhang and Poole, 1996) – or approximate – such as the loopy belief propagation algorithm (Murphy et al., 1999).\nThe distributions of the single variables can be learned from observed data using maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian learning."

While we make use of both types of rules in our work, here we concentrate only on the probability rules which are the ones used for the resolution of the NSUs.\nLet c1, . . . , cn be a sequence of logical conditions and P (E1), . . . , P (En) a sequence of categorical probability distributions8 over mutually exclusive effects. A probability rule r is defined as follows:\nr :\n∀x if c1 then P (E1 = e1,1) = p1,1 . . .\nP (E1 = e1,m1) = p1,m1\nelse if c2 then P (E2 = e2,1) = p2,1 . . .\nP (E2 = e2,m2) = p2,m2\nelse P (En = en,1) = pn,1 . . .\nP (En = en,mn) = pn,mn\n8A categorical distribution is a probability distribution of an event having a finite set of outcomes with defined probability.\n18\nThe random variable Ei encodes a range of possible effects ei,1, . . . , ei,mi , each one with a corresponding probability pi,j . The conditions and effects of a rule may include underspecified variables, denoted with x, which are universally quantified on the top of the rule. The effects are duplicated for every possible assignments (grounding) of the underspecified variables.\nEach pair of condition and probability distribution over the effects 〈ci, P (Ei)〉 is a branch bri of the rule. Overall, the rule is a sequence of branches br1, . . . , brn. The rule is “executed” by running sequentially through the branches. Only the first condition satisfied triggers the corresponding probabilistic effect, the subsequent branches are ignored (as in programming languages).\nThe dialogue state is represented as a Bayesian network containing a set of nodes (random variables). At each state update, rules are instantiated as nodes in the network. For each rule, the input edges of the node come from the condition variables whereas the output edges go towards the effect variables. The probability distribution of the rule is extracted by executing it. The probability distribution of the effect variables are then retrieved by probabilistic inference. Lison (2014) details the rules and update procedure.\nThe probabilistic rules are useful in at least three ways:\n• They are expressly designed for dialogue modeling. They combine the expressivity of both probabilistic inference and first order logic. This is an advantage in dialogue\nmodeling where one has to describe objects that relate to each other in the dialogue domain and, at the same time, handle uncertain knowledge of the state variables.\n• They can cope with the scarcity of training data of most dialogue domains by exploiting the internal structure of the dialogue models. By using logical formulae\nto encode the conditions for a possible outcome, it is possible to group the values of the variables into partitions, reducing the number of parameters needed to infer the outcome distribution and therefore the amount of data needed to learn the distribution.\n• The state update is handled with probabilistic inference therefore they can operate under uncertain settings which is often needed in dialogue modeling where variables\nare best represented as belief states, continuously updated by observed evidence.\nThe probabilistic rules formalism has also been implemented into a framework called OpenDial (Lison and Kennington, 2015). OpenDial is a Java toolkit for developing spoken dialogue systems using the probabilistic rules formalism. Using an XML-based language it is possible to define in OpenDial the probabilistic rules to handle the evolution of the dialogue state in a domain-independent way. OpenDial can either work on existent transcripts or as an interactive user interface. OpenDial can also learn parameters from small amounts of data using either supervised or reinforcement learning.\n19"

An SVM is a binary classifier that uses a representation of the instances as points in a m-dimensional space, where m is the number of attributes. Assuming that the instances of the two classes are linearly separable1, the goal of SVMs is to find an hyperplane that separates the classes with the maximum margin. The task of finding the best hyperplane that separates the classes is defined as an optimization problem. SVMs can also be formulated to have “soft margins” i.e. allowing some points of a class to lay in the opposite side of the hyperplane in order to find a better solution. The SVM algorithm we use regularizes the model through a single parameter C.\nThe SVMs can also be used with non-linear (i.e. non linearly separable) data using the so called kernel method. A kernel function maps the points from the input space into an highdimentional space where they might be linearly separable. A popular kernel function is the (Gaussian) Radial Basis Function (RBF) which maps the input space into an infinitedimensional space. Its popularity is partially due to the simplicity of its model which involves only one parameter γ.\nEven though SVMs are defined as binary classifiers, they can be extended to a multiclass scenario by e.g. training multiple binary classifiers using a one-vs-all or a one-vs-one classification strategy (Duan and Keerthi, 2005).\nThe Weka toolkit contains an implementation of SVMs that uses the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm (Platt et al., 1999). In all our experiments we use the SMO algorithm with an RBF kernel."

Coordinate ascent is based on the idea of maximizing a multivariable function f(X) along one direction at a time, as apposed to e.g. gradient descent which follows the direction given by the gradient of the function. Our implementation detects the ascent direction by lookup of the function value. The Algorithm 1 contains a procedure to maximize a function f along the direction k while Algorithm 2 performs the coordinate ascent. The step-size values decay at a rate given by the coefficient α. The minimum step-sizes determine the stopping conditions for the maximize function, instead the coordinateAscent algorithm stops as soon as the found values do not change between two iterations therefore the maximum is found. The latter algorithm can be easily modified to account for a stopping condition given by a maximum number of iterations.\n1An hyperplane can be drawn in the space such that the instances of one class are all in one side of the hyperplane and the instances of the other class are in the other side.\n2Also known as coordinate descent which is the minimization counterpart (distinguished only by changing the sign of the function).\n24\nWe implemented this algorithm ourselves because, for technical reasons, it was easier than rely on a third-party API. Its simplicity is one of its advantages but it is more prone to be stuck on local maximums than more sophisticated techniques such as gradient ascent.\nFor all our experiments we use the described algorithm to find the parameters that yield the maximum accuracy of the classifiers (using 10-fold cross-validation).

There are many classification tasks, such as ours, in which it is hard or costly to label a large amount of instances while instead it is relatively cheap to extract unlabeled ones. The empirical question is whether the use of unlabeled data is useful to improve the classification performances. Semi-Supervised Learning techniques deal with this issue. They exploit the combination of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to try improve the classification accuracy.

Perhaps more challenging is the selection of an antecedent for the NSU. As pointed out in Section 2.1, the antecedent of an NSU is not always the preceding utterance. Nevertheless, as proved in the corpus study of Fernández (2006), the percentage of the utterances whose antecedent is not the preceding utterance is rather low. Another result of the aforementioned work is that the case in which the antecedent is an utterance at distance greater than one is far more probable in a multi-party dialogue context. In light of the above considerations, we restrict the instances we extract to only those from two-party dialogues and we always consider the preceding utterance as the antecedent of an NSU. While there has been some previous work towards using machine learning techniques for the detection of the antecedent of NSUs in multi-party dialogue (Schlangen, 2005), we consider sufficient the amount of unlabeled data we can extract following the previous rule.\nIn order to maximize the quality of the unlabeled data that we extract we also enforce some rules over the antecedent utterance:\n• The number of words in the antecedent must be greater than the number of words in the NSU;\n• The antecedent must have a complete clausal form i.e. at least a verb phrase and a noun phrase.\nUsing the whole set of heuristics we extracted in total 3 198 new unlabeled NSU instances from the BNC (checked not to be already in the corpus)."

Therefore, similarly to the standard SVM, TSVM tries to find the hyperplane that maximizes the unlabeled data margin i.e. considering unlabeled points as labeled ones. To decide whether an unlabeled point should be considered of one class or the other, clustering techniques are used e.g. k-nearest neighbors (the class of the majority of the neighbors or some other variant).\nWe will not go into mathematical details so we recommend the interested reader to Vapnik (1998), Collobert et al.

An idea to ease this problem is to let the learning algorithm choose which instance could be the most informative (i.e. the most difficult to predict) then annotate it manually. This technique has the advantage of reducing the cost of manual annotation of the instances by making informed guesses over the instances to label and discarding the redundant ones.\nThis kind of techniques is typically employed to cope with the scarcity of labeled data. In our case, the lack of sufficient training data is especially problematic due to the strong class imbalance between the NSU classes.\n34\nThe Active Learning (AL) scheme, which is a special case of semi-supervised learning, trains the model over the available labeled data then queries the user for the label of one (or few more) instances then retrain the model and so on until convergence criteria are met, e.g. the wanted number of new instances is reached.\nThere can be different query strategies, some of them are:\n• Uncertainty Sampling: queries the least confident instance (according to the probability of the prediction). A variant of that uses entropy to determine the most\ninformative instance.\n• Query-by-committee: uses many different classifiers to predict unlabeled data then formulates the most informative query as the instance about which they most dis-\nagree.\n• Expected Model Change: selects the instance that would impart the greatest change to the model, according to a decision-theoretic approach.\n• Expected Error Reduction: Another decision-theoretic approach that aims to minimize the risk, that is the expected future error. The instances are selected on the\nbasis of how much the model generalization error is likely to be reduced. A variant of this approach considers only the output variance of the model.\nThe particular active learning algorithm we employed in our experiments is a pool-based method5 with uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Catlett, 1994). The sampling relies on entropy as measure of uncertainty. Given a particular (unlabeled) instance with a vector of feature values f , we use the existing classifier to predict the class C of the instance, and derive the probability distribution P (C = ci|f) for each possible output class ci. We can then determine the corresponding entropy of the class C:\nH(C) = − ∑ i P (C=ci|f) logP (C=ci|f)\nAs seen in section 3.2.1, entropy indicates the “unpredictability” of a random variable and also how much information it carries. The higher the entropy of the class of an instance the more information we gain by knowing it. The algorithm we employ (Algorithm 3) selects the instances with highest entropy as the most informative ones. As argued in Settles (2010), entropy sampling is especially useful when there are more than two classes, as in our setting. In practice, we applied the JCLAL active learning library6 to extract and annotate 100 new instances of NSUs, which were subsequently added to the existing training data.\n5That involves drawing labeled instances from a “pool” that remains the same over the iterations, as opposed of stream-based ones in which sampling is done over a stream of data.\n6cf. https://sourceforge.net/projects/jclal.\n35\nAlgorithm 3: entropySampling(Γ,U, k)\nInput: The classifier Γ; the unlabeled data U; the sample size k.

To assess that the performances of one classifier being higher than a second one is not due to the randomness associated with the data manipulation but to a statistically significant difference between the classifiers one needs to prove with high confidence that the null hypothesis is false. The null hypothesis is a statement that is assumed to be true until evidence indicates otherwise. When comparing two learning systems, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the performances of the two learning systems. To prove that a classifier performs better than another we need to disprove the null hypothesis with a high degree of confidence. For this purpose we employ a Student’s ttest, a widespread method to compare two sets of data. The t-test can be used to find the probability p of the performance values of the two classifiers being drawn from the same mean.\nTo run the t-test, we compare the differences δi among the performance values of the two classifiers over the n independent samples. We first compute the mean of the differences:\nδ̄ = 1\nn n∑ i=1 δi\n37\nThen we compute the t-statistic:\nt = δ̄√\n1 n(n−1) ∑n i=1(δi − δ̄)2\nFrom the t-statistic we can derive the p-value from a Student’s t-distribution with n − 1 degree of freedom. A small p-value means that it is unlikely that the samples show such a t-statistic by chance therefore we can assess that the difference in performance between the two classifiers is statistically significant.\nIn our case we use a paired t-test on the accuracy values of the 10-fold cross-validation over the dataset (thus n = 10). By convention, an acceptable p-value is p ≤ 0.05. For our experiments we rely on the t.test function from the R project, a framework for statistical computing (R Core Team, 2015)."

The results on the test set show that the inclusion of the active learning data is only beneficial when combined with the extended feature set.\nWe also performed an evaluation of the various settings using 10-fold cross-validation over the full dataset. The evaluation results based on the active learning procedure (AL) refer to the performance of the system after the inclusion of all newly annotated instances. The novel data was added to the training set of each fold.\nWe compare the results of the various settings using the J48 algorithm (Table 3.8) and SMO algorithm (Table 3.9). The use of active learning was successful and, in the end, the use of the SMO classifier with the extended feature set and the inclusion of the AL instances constitutes our final approach.\nThe results show a significant improvement of the classification performance between the baseline and the final approach. Using a paired t-test with a 95% confidence interval between the baseline and the final results (as detailed in Section 3.6.1), the improvement in classification accuracy is statistically significant with a p-value of 6.9× 10−3.\nThe SVM algorithm does not perform particularly well with the baseline feature set but scales better than the J48 classifier after the inclusion of the additional features. Overall, the results demonstrate that the classification can be improved using a modest amount of additional training data combined with an extended feature set. However, we can observe from Table 3.10 that some NSU classes remain difficult to classify even with the insertion of additional training data. For instance, Helpful Rejections are still the most difficult classes to classify, even with the addition of 21 new instances. One of the problems with\n40\nHelpful Rejections is that they are connected to their antecedents mainly at the semantic level. Consider the following example of Helpful Rejection that is hard to classify:\n(3.6) a: There was one which you said Ernest Morris was born in 1950.\nb: Fifteen. [BNC: J9A 372–373]\nIt is clear that, for the Helpful Rejection in (3.6), morpho-syntactic and lexical features, such as the ones we employ, are of little use in classifying this utterance. Most of the connection is at the semantic level therefore we would need to use features that exploit semantic patterns. At the same time, the use of this type of features would add several layers of complexity at the feature extraction process. Other examples of difficult classes are the Repeated Affirmative Answers and Repeated Acknowledgments. They are highly ambiguous because they can be misclassified between each other, with their respective non-repeated classes and sometimes with other NSU classes. An example of ambiguous Repeated Acknowledgment can be the following:\n(3.7) a: Selected period.\nb: Selected period, right, Andrew?9\n[BNC: JK8 114–115]\nThe instance in (3.7) contains also a question therefore it is often misclassified with other question denoting NSU classes. It is clear that handling these type of NSU requires to perform a deeper semantic analysis of the connection with their antecedents then design appropriate semantic features. The extraction of additional labeled data is also especially important for both the feature engineering and the learning process of the classifiers. This two approaches may be the starting points of any future work on this task.\n9In the dialogue, the speaker B is asking the same question to many people in turns.\n41\n42\n43\n44"

This task is formulated as a machine learning problem and we follow and extend the work of Fernández et al. (2007). We use their corpus as a goldstandard and a replica of their approach as a baseline. The data, the machine learning algorithm used and the feature set of the baseline were discussed respectively in Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3. The two main problems we faced in our work have been the scarcity of the labeled data and the imbalance in the distribution of the classes. To address these problems we extended the baseline approach in two ways: using a larger feature set (detailed in Section 3.4) and employing semi-supervised learning techniques to exploit the abundance of unlabeled data. We described in Section 3.5 the semi-supervised learning techniques that we employed, namely: Self Training, Transductive SVM and Active Learning. Section 3.6 shows the empirical results we got from our experiments. While the extended feature set alone did not make an improvement on the performances of the classifiers, its use in combination with Active Learning made a modest but significant difference.\n45\nChapter 4"

      "text" : "As introduced in Chapter 2, the resolution of an NSU is the task of reconstructing its meaning from the dialogue context. Fernández (2006) proposes a set of rules to resolve NSUs based on TTR, the logical framework from Cooper (2004) further developed then in Ginzburg (2012). One limitation of logical frameworks such as TTR is their inability to directly represent (and reason over) uncertain knowledge. Moreover, many dialogue domains contain variables that are only partially observable. We have to take into account a certain degree of stochastic behavior when modeling dialogue since we still have an imperfect understanding of its dynamics. The stochastic component is especially important in dealing with NSUs since they do not have a precise meaning by themselves and, as argued in Ginzburg (2012), they are in principle highly ambiguous.\nFor this reason we propose a new approach to the resolution of NSUs that takes probabilistic account of the variables involved and the procedures used. We employ the probabilistic rules formalism of Lison (2015) (detailed in Section 2.3) to encode the NSU resolution procedures as probabilistic rules. Probabilistic rules are similar, to a certain extent, to the update rules developed by Ginzburg (2012) (described in Section 2.2). For this reason probabilistic rules are particularly suited for our purpose since, in this way, we could reuse many theoretical aspects from Ginzburg (2012) and Fernández (2006). We reinterpreted the variables in the dialogue state as random variables and straightforwardly “converted” the resolution rules into probabilistic rules.\nIn the next sections we explain how we represented the variables in the dialogue state and how we translated the rules from Fernández (2006) into probabilistic rules. First we describe the theoretical aspects from Ginzburg (2012) we employ in our approach. We present then the design of our dialogue context and the rules to resolve the NSUs.\nWe surely take a much simpler approach than Ginzburg (2012) in the modeling of the dialogue state, abstracting intentionally from many details that would add complexity to the modeling. Indeed there are a number of issues that arise in the resolution of NSUs\n47\nthat need to be treated with proper lexical and semantic resources that we did not include. However, in the end our goal for this work is not to formulate a complete theory of NSU resolution but rather to provide a proof-of-concept implementation for the resolution of the NSUs in the dialogue context with the probabilistic rules formalism.\nThis framework has also been implemented and tested with the OpenDial toolkit. We developed a dialogue system able to update the dialogue state probabilistically with update rules similar to the ones from Ginzburg (2012). The system is also able to resolve toy examples in an interactive way. A detailed example of the behavior of the system is given in Section 4.5. More high-level details about the rules for the state update (complementary to the rules for the NSU resolution) can be found in the Appendix A1."

More precisely, let ua and nsua represent respectively the word word sequence making up the NSU and its type according to the taxonomy presented in Section 2.1.1. We also assume MaxQUD to be a high-level semantic representation of the antecedent, as mentioned in Section 2.2.2. Through a resolution procedure, we want to extract aa i.e. the high-level semantic representation of the NSU. The right resolution procedure is selected on the basis of the type of the NSU. In our case the value of nsua is retrieved using the classifier developed in Chapter 3 which takes as input the raw NSU and the antecedent. Figure 4.1 shows a schema of the task just defined. Indeed this is the simplest way to define the task. The resolution procedure may also be dependent of other variables in the dialogue state such as the Facts. In principle, the resolution task is defined independently from the actual semantic representation of the utterances. It is also defined independently from the rules used to update the variables in the dialogue state such as QUD and Facts. In practice, define a set of rules that are generic enough to handle every possible case and behave independently from the state update rules is a difficult task and still an open research problem.\n1For more technical details about the implementation and examples of interaction visit: https://github.com/paolodragone\n48"

In the theory of Ginzburg (2012), this concept is named Partial Parallelism2. Partial Parallelism is one way to categorize NSU classes according to the relation with their antecedents. NSU classes are categorized as +/-ParPar in order to find the right way to treat them. An NSU class categorized as +ParPar involves the access to one or more sub-utterances from its antecedent. On the contrary, -ParPar NSU classes do not need to know the internal structure of their antecedents to be resolved.

This means that the positive answer “yes” to a polar question is equivalent to the assertion of a proposition with the same content as the polar question.\nFor Plain Rejections, R is the relation Neg. Neg indicates the negation of a proposition p although it is sensitive to the polarity of p, meaning that, when p is positive, Neg(p) is the negation of p (denoted with p̄) whereas, when p is negative, Neg(p) is p itself. This rule is needed to account for the asymmetry in the meaning of negative answers to negative questions. A negative answer to a negative question does not equate a positive one, as exemplified in (4.2) (rephrased from Ginzburg (2012)).\n(4.2) a: Did Paul not leave?\nb: No. (= Paul did not leave.)\nFor Propositional Modifiers, R is a relation PropRel which applies different modalities on the basis of the lexical meaning of the word used as modifier, e.g. “probably” would have a different modality than “clearly”."

The FECs are relevant constituents in the elements of QUD that may be used to resolve NSUs. Consider the following example:\n(4.3) a: A friend is coming to the party.\nb: Who?\n3The concept was previously formalized by Fernández (2006) as topical constituents.\n50\nThe noun phrase “A friend” in the first sentence of (4.3) is the one which the following Sluice is referring to. Roughly the Sluice can be resolved in such a manner: “Who is your friend that is coming to the party?”. It is clear that the aforementioned sub-utterance has to be contextually available to allow the resolution of the subsequent Sluice. In this we follow Ginzburg (2012), who defines a set of rules to follow to make FECs contextually available. In particular we are interested in the following ones:\n• The FEC associated with a wh-interrogative is the wh-phrase4 itself:\n(4.4) a: Who is organizing the party?\nb: Paul.\n• The FEC associated with a polar interrogative or declarative utterance can be any (quantified) noun phrases:\n(4.5) a: A friend is organizing a party and many people are coming.\nb: Who?\n• The FEC associated with a clarification request is the sub-utterance that has to be clarified i.e. any sub-utterance in the antecedent:\n(4.6) a: Is Paul organizing a party?\nb: Paul? / Organizing? / A party?"

Despite this difference, we assume that Plain Acknowledgments are used to show acceptance, therefore the use of a Plain Acknowledgments also downdates the QUD.

Asking a query is the act of posing questions and they are piled up in the QUD until they are resolved by an answer. The act of answering to a query corresponds, in the case of a wh-interrogative, to finding the valid arguments to the variables of the question. In case of a polar question, the answer is derived simply by its truth status, denoted by the presence of the same predicate in the Facts.

At our disposal we have the full power of probabilistic modeling which enables us to encode max-qud as a random variable with a prior that gives more probability to the highest element in qud.

However, these rules will only take place at the level of action selection and context update therefore it is still possible to resolve this kind of NSUs in a general way, as previously explained in Section 4.2.2.\nAn example of lexicalized rule for updating the context in the presence of a modified proposition can be the following.\nfactsIncrementPropRel :\n∀ p,y if (ab=Accept(PropRelprobably(p)(y))) then{ P (facts← facts ∪ {p(y)} ∪ new-fec) = 0.75 else if (ab=Accept(PropRelunlikely(p)(y))) then{ P (facts← facts ∪ {p(y)} ∪ new-fec) = 0.25\n59\nThis rule handles the update of the facts variable when the addressee decides to accept a proposition modified by a “probably” relation or by an “unlikely” relation. The latter is realized by updating facts with a high probability while the former updates facts with a low probability.\nWhile the above rule has handcrafted probabilities, they can in principle be learned from actual data. Of course this would be only possible given a corpus containing NSU instances annotated with the dialogue acts and state updates at each step. When an instance of Propositional Modifier is encountered, the probabilities of the effects are updated according to the relative state update move."

Furthermore, the meaning of wh-words can be modified in many ways, e.g. “how many”, “how long”, “who else”, “what about”. This would require an extensive treatment for this kind of NSUs that we do not attempt to elaborate.\n61\nNevertheless we will show some rules to treat simple direct Sluices like the ones in (4.16) and (4.17).\n(4.16) b: A friend is coming to the party.\na: Who?\n(4.17) b: Paul is throwing a party.\na: When?\nThe context of the Sluices is a MaxQUD with at least one variable (raised by either a wh-question or a proposition with some undefined reference). The Sluice is used to request some kind of information regarding one of the FECs of the antecedent. The requested information as well as the context generated by the resolution depend on the lexical meaning of the wh-word. For instance, the following rule treats the Sluice “who?”.\nsluicewho :\n∀ q, x,y, pi,yi if (nsua=Sluice ∧ “who”∈ua ∧ qud[max-qud].q=q(x,y) ∧\n{p1(x,y1), . . . , pn(x,yn)}⊆qud[max-qud].fec) thenP  aa ← Ask(named(x, x̂)), new-fec← {p1(x,y1), . . . , pn(x,yn)} ∪ {person(x)}  = 1 where x̂ is a newly created variable. Such a Sluice asks about the identity (here simplified by the name) of a person which is referred to in the antecedent.\nWe can use as example the transcript (4.16). The context before the application of the rule is:\nmax-qud = 1\nqud[max-qud].q = comingToParty(X1)\nqud[max-qud].fec = {friend(IND2,X1)}\nnsua = Sluice\nAfter the application of the rule we have:\naa = Ask(named(X1))\nnew-fec = {friend(IND2,X1),person(X1)}\nAn interesting result of this rule in combination with the probabilistic inference employed in OpenDial is how the ambiguity in the FECs is handled. As argued in Ginzburg (2012), the antecedent of a Sluice can contain more than one potential FEC as exemplified by the following transcript.\n(4.18) b: A friend of mine is organizing a party for his girlfriend.\na: Who? (= Who is your friend? / Who is his girlfriend?)\n62\nThe resolution of this kind of ambiguities is automatically handled in a probabilistic fashion. In (4.18) the representation of the antecedent (MaxQUD) would be the following:\nqud[max-qud].q = organizingPartyFor(X1,X2) qud[max-qud].fec = {friend(IND1,X1), girlfriend(X2,X1)}\nIn this case, the above rule would be applied to both variables X1 and X2, resulting in two possible assignments of aa and new-fec with 0.5 probability:\naa = Ask(named(X1,X3)) with probability 0.5Ask(named(X2,X3)) with probability 0.5 new-fec =\n{friend(IND1,X1),person(X1)} with probability 0.5{girlfriend(X2,X1),person(X2)} with probability 0.5 Without any prior, the probabilistic inference over the dialogue state would assign equal probability to each possible assignment of aa. A more sophisticated approach may use some notion of saliency as a prior to adjust the probabilities of each focal constituent. For example one could adjust the probability according to whether the constituent is a subject or an object in the antecedent. In the previous example the friend would have had more probability mass (e.g. 0.8) and the girlfriend less probability mass (e.g. 0.2). It is also possible that the prior saliency could depend on other variables such as the Facts or other contextual factors. Moreover, the parameters of the saliency function could also be learned from data."

These systems have a complex structure formed of many different parts, however they are usually formed by the following major components:\n• Natural language understanding (NLU), maps the textual utterances into a high-level semantic representation;\n• Dialogue management, updates the dialogue state and plans the actions to perform;\n• Natural language generation (NLG), generates the linguistic realization of the planned actions or dialogue acts;\nThe resolution of NSUs is closely related to the NLU task and to the dialogue management in presence of such utterances. For its proper operation, our implementation indeed includes also shallow NLU and NLG modules as well as a very simple action selection procedure. Figure 4.2 shows the work-flow of the system. The system takes as input a user utterance uu. The NLU module generates the semantic representation of the utterance au, the NSU resolution takes place at this stage and involves the recovery of the right semantic form for the incomplete utterance using the information available in the dialogue context. The classifier, right before the resolution, generates the content of the variable nsuu. The action selection module decides what to do with the user utterance, producing a semantic representation of the action to perform am (or dialogue act of the sentence to be uttered). The NLG module transforms am into its linguistic form um. Throughout the process the context is updated by rules triggered by au, am and um.\n65"

The user answers to the questions posed by system, often using NSUs such as Short Answers, Affirmative Answers and Rejections. It is clear that this example covers only few of the available NSU classes but still it suffice at explaining the overall behavior of our implementation. More elaborate examples would have been complicated to understand and to read therefore we address the interested reader to the actual implementation9 to have a more detailed look at the behavior of the system.\nWe want to stress that the predicates we use are simple and handcrafted. A much more sophisticated NLU module would be required to automatize the process of extracting those predicates from the sentences which is a completely different problem from the one we addressed in this work.\nThe following is a step-by-step explanation of the systems behavior through the updates of the dialogue state. The process is intrinsically probabilistic, for every move there are many updates with a certain probability but, for readability, we avoid to show each possible probabilistic update and we show the most probable one instead.\n9cf. https://github.com/paolodragone\n66\n1. The system greets and asks for the the travel plans of the user, updating the QUD\nwith the new question:\num = [. . . ] What are your travel plans?\nam = Ask(travelPlans(x1, x2, x3))\nqud[1].q = travelPlans(x1, x2, x3)\nmax-qud = 1\n2. The user asserts its travel plans resolving the current issue under discussion:\nuu = I’d like to travel from Columbus Ohio to Phoenix Arizona on\nThursday October 5th.\nau = Assert(travelPlans(C1,C2,D1)) new-fec = {city(C1,Columbus), city(C2,Phoenix),date(D1, 05-10)}\nThe system then accepts the assertion and resolves the issue:\nfacts = {travelPlans(C1,C2,D1),\ncity(C1,Columbus), city(C2,Phoenix),date(D1, 05-10)}\nmax-qud = 0\n3. The system asks for time of departure, a new issue arises:\nuu = What time do you want to leave Columbus?\nau = Ask(departTime(x1))\nqud[1].q = departTime(x1)\nmax-qud = 1\n4. The user resolves the issue with a Short Answer. The meaning of this NSU is inferred\nfrom the MaxQUD: the departure time must be before the given hour. The Short Answer resolution rule gives the following result:\nuu = Before 6 P.M.\nnsuu = ShortAns\nau = Assert(departTime(T1)) new-fec = {before(T1,T2), time(T2, 18:00)}\nThe system again acknowledges the answer of the user inserting his assertion in the set of Facts and downdates the QUD with the resolved issue:\n67\nfacts = {travelPlans(C1,C2,D1),\ncity(C1,Columbus), city(C2,Phoenix), date(D1, 05-10), departTime(T1), before(T1,T2), time(T2, 18:00)}\nmax-qud = 0\n5. The system asks again a question about the preferred airline of the user. This time\nit is a polar question (notice the absence of a variable in the question predicate).\num = Do you have a preferred airline?\nam = Ask(havePreferredAirline(user))\nqud[1].q = havePreferredAirline(user)\nmax-qud = 1\n6. The user gives a negative answer to the previous question using an NSU. Again the\nmeaning is inferred from the MaxQUD: the user does not have a preferred airline. From Section 4.4.3 we recall that the resolution rule in this case applies the Neg function to the predicate to indicate its negative form.\nuu = No.\nnsuu = Reject\nau = Assert(Neg(havePreferredAirline)(user))\nAgain the answer of the user is inserted in the Facts:\nfacts = {travelPlans(C1,C2,D1),\ncity(C1,Columbus), city(C2,Phoenix), date(D1, 05-10),\ndepartTime(T1), before(T1,T2), time(T2, 18:00), Neg(havePreferredAirline)(user)}\nmax-qud = 0\n7. The system summarizes the pieces of information gained so far and queries the user\nfor their correctness. A check question like this can be represented as asking the first proposition as a polar question in the following way:\num = I have you going . . . Is that correct?\nam = Ask(travelPlans(C1,C2,D1))\nqud[1].q = travelPlans(C1,C2,D1) qud[1].fec = {city(C1,Columbus), city(C2,Phoenix), date(D1, 05-10)}\nmax-qud = 1\n68\n8. The user confirms the information stored by the system with an Affirmative Answer.\nWe recall that an Affirmative Answer is equivalent to stating the polar question in MaxQUD as it is:\nuu = Yes.\nnsuu = AffAns\nau = Assert(travelPlans(C1,C2,D1)) new-fec = {city(C1,Columbus), city(C2,Phoenix),date(D1, 05-10)}\nThe system acknowledges the answer by downdating the QUD but leaving Facts as it is since no additional information was included.\nmax-qud = 0\n9. The system asks a new question about a possible return flight.\num = Will you return to Columbus from Phoenix?\nam = Ask(return(C2,C1))\nqud[1].q = return(C2,C1) qud[1].fec = {city(C1,Columbus), city(C2,Phoenix)}\nmax-qud = 1\n10. The user says that he will not return from its destination.\nuu = No.\nau = Assert(Neg(return)(C2,C1)) facts = {travelPlans(C1,C2,D1),\ncity(C1,Columbus), city(C2,Phoenix), date(D1, 05-10),\ndepartTime(T1), before(T1,T2), time(T2, 18:00),\nNeg(havePreferredAirline)(user),\nNeg(return)(C2,C1)}\nmax-qud = 0\n11. The system asks one last question about a its final destination.\num = Is Phoenix your final destination?\nam = Ask(finalDest(C2))\nqud[1].q = finalDest(C2) qud[1].fec = {city(C2,Phoenix)}\nmax-qud = 1\n69\n12. The user confirms that Phoenix is his last destination.\nuu = Yes.\nau = Assert(lastDest(C2)) facts = {travelPlans(C1,C2,D1),\ncity(C1,Columbus), city(C2,Phoenix), date(D1, 05-10),\ndepartTime(T1), before(T1,T2), time(T2, 18:00),\nNeg(havePreferredAirline)(user),\nNeg(willReturn)(user),\nlastDest(C2)}\nmax-qud = 0\n13. After gathering up all the information needed, contained in the Facts, the system\nstarts checking the availability of the flights for the user.\nA possible continuation would be that the system finds some alternative flights to show to the user and ask him which one he or she prefers. The understanding in the dialogues in not always perfect though. It often happens that the system asks for repetition or even that the user resets or interrupts the conversation. This makes the dialogue transcripts from the Communicator dataset very unpredictable and a good starting poin to evaluate the benefits and limitations of probabilistic approaches to NSU resolution.\nThis example gives enough detail to understand the basic behavior of the system in this particular dialogue domain. It is of course limited in many ways and extensions could be sought in different directions. Testing the system on a different domain covering other types of NSUs should be perhaps the first way to check the validity of the rules. However, a complete evaluation would require the manual annotation of several dialogue transcripts, which is not an easy task.\nBesides, the behavior of the rules rely on a fixed semantics that is highly domain-dependent. To make the system scalable to different domains one needs to integrate other grammatical and lexical resources to make the semantics as generic as possible. It is clear though that a complete domain independent framework would be difficult to achieve.\nOur system is of course still a prototype of a complete dialogue system for NSU interpretation. There are many improvement needed to achieve a working system. For instance the inclusion of rules to handle the NSU classes not covered by our work. A more general theory of grounding is also needed to properly account for the clarification requests. Extend every other assumption we made to simplify the development is another important goal for possible future works. Furthermore, to enhance the capabilities of the system, the integration of other natural language understanding modules is needed as well. Anaphora Resolution (Mitkov, 2014) and Named Entity Recognition (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007) are just a few of the problems concerning the correct interpretation of NSUs.\n70"

As previously argued throughout this thesis, the use of a purely logic-based formalism, such as TTR, has some disadvantages in dealing with partially observable inputs and stochastic events when compared to a probabilistic approach. We showed how to reformulate the rules from Fernández (2006) using the probabilistic rules formalism (Lison, 2014) in order to include a probabilistic account of the dialogue state. We made use of a portion of the dialogue context theory from Ginzburg (2012) to encode the basic elements of the dialogue state needed for the resolution of the NSUs (see Section 2.2). We presented in Section 4.4 the probabilistic rules for the resolution of the NSUs. In Section 4.5 we also described a stepby-step example of the usage of the rules.

      "text" : "In this thesis we described our research work regarding non-sentential utterances. NSUs are utterances that do not have a complete sentential form but convey a full meaning. However, they require to be “interpreted” i.e. their meaning must be extracted from the context of the dialogue. Our experiments concerned two separate aspects of the interpretation of the NSUs, namely:\n• The classification of NSUs given their context;\n• The resolution of the semantic content of the NSUs from the dialogue context;\nIn Chapter 2 we presented the background knowledge needed to the development of our work. We discussed in Section 2.1 the concept of non-sentential utterance, referring to Fernández (2006) as our theoretical basis. From the aforementioned work we employ the same taxonomy and corpus of NSUs. We then explain our methodology for the interpretation of NSUs, also based on the theory from Fernández (2006). To interpret an NSU, we first classify it according to the aforementioned taxonomy using machine learning then we “resolve” its meaning from the dialogue context through a resolution procedure dependent on its type.\nFernández (2006) develops a set of resolution procedures based on Type Theory with Records (Cooper, 2004; Ginzburg, 2012). In Section 2.2 we briefly describe the aspects of TTR and the theory of dialogue context from Ginzburg (2012) that we needed in our work.\n73\nIn this thesis we argue that a purely logical framework such as TTR may have disadvantages in dealing with the uncertain nature of the NSUs. In our view a proper alternative is a probabilistic approach to the resolution of NSUs. To this end we employ the probabilistic rules formalism and the theory from Lison (2014) as probabilistic representation of the dialogue state and the NSU resolution procedures. We detail the basic aspects of the theory from Lison (2014) in Section 2.3. In Lison (2014) the dialogue state is represented as a Bayesian network and its dynamics are described by probabilistic rules. Probabilistic rules are if . . . then . . . else . . . constructs that map logical conditions to probabilistic effects.\nThe focus of Chapter 3 is on the classification of NSUs, which is the task of inferring the type of a given NSU from its context. The context of a NSU is formed by its “antecedent”, the preceding utterance that holds its hidden meaning. Our work on the classification of NSUs is based on Fernández et al. (2007). We replicated their approach and set it as our baseline, as explained in Section 3.3. In Section 3.4 we describe the new features we use to extend the baseline feature set. The extended feature set alone was not enough to achieve an improvement of the classification performances. The major problems in this respect were the scarcity of labeled data and the class imbalance. To address those problems we employed semi-supervised learning techniques that we detail in Section 3.5. Our experiments show that the combination of the extended feature set and new training instances labeled with Active Learning led to a significant improvement of the classification accuracy. Nevertheless we argue that further analysis and testing need a larger amount of labeled data to be carried out properly. In Dragone and Lison (2015a) we present our findings in the classification of NSUs using Active Learning.\nIn Chapter 4 we detail the resolution of NSUs. The NSU resolution is the task of extracting the meaning of a given NSU from the dialogue context. We explain the process that we employ for the NSU resolution in Section 4.1. In Section 4.2 we describe the theoretical concepts we need from Ginzburg (2012). The description of our theory starts in Section 4.3 where we explained the design of the dialogue context. To model our dialogue context we take inspiration from Ginzburg (2012), however we reinterpret its constructs as random variables. The random variables in the dialogue state interact with each other through the probabilistic rules. The resolution rules that we developed are explained in Section 4.4. Finally, in Section 4.5, we show a detailed example of the use of the resolution rules over a transcript from the Communicator dataset (Walker et al., 2001).\nOur approach to the resolution of NSUs is intended to be a proof-of-concept for this task. We showed how we could reuse many concepts from the theory of Fernández (2006) and Ginzburg (2012) and “translate” the resolution rules based on TTR into probabilistic rules. The works on classification and interpretation carried out in this thesis were also presented in Dragone and Lison (2015b).\n74"

      "text" : "In our work on the classification of NSUs we experimented many different approaches in seeking an improvement of the classification accuracy. However, there are many other paths that we did not explore or aspects in our approaches that can be improved. Here we discuss a few of the possible extension of our work.\nThere are classes of NSU that are intrinsically difficult to predict such as Helpful Rejections and other pairs of classes that are difficult to discriminate such as Repeated Acknowledgments and Repeated Affirmative Answers. A common issue in trying to predict those classes is that the parallelism with their antecedent is almost entirely at the semantic level. This requires deeper understanding of the phenomena and the use of features that exploit semantic relations in the NSU instances. We did not use any semantic feature since it would have added a non-trivial amount of complexity to our feature extraction algorithms. The deeper understanding of “difficult” classes and the use of such features may be a good starting point to any feature work on this topic.\nUsing additional features does not avoid the problem of class imbalance in the dataset. Many techniques could be experimented to try to mitigate this issue. An example may be an over-sampling technique such as SMOTE 1 (Chawla et al., 2002). The aforementioned work shows that the combination of SMOTE and majority class under-sampling leads to better classification performances on certain domains.\nPerhaps the most difficult issue to overcome is the scarcity of labeled data. Our work shows that additional training data is indeed useful to improve the classification performances but we still lack enough data to run proper evaluations. We did not use the instances labeled with Active Learning as test data. Additional data for the gold standard should be composed of high-quality, manually annotated instances extracted within a corpus study that closely follows the original one from Fernández and Ginzburg (2002).\nIncorporate additional elliptical phenomena\nThe corpus study from Fernández and Ginzburg (2002) is focused on data extracted from the British National Corpus therefore confined to only certain kind of dialogue domains.

Another point that may be considered is that some classes include large variety of forms and functions such as Short Answers and Helpful Rejections. A possible development could be to increase the granularity of such classes to try to capture more subtle differences."

      "text" : "Our study on the resolution of NSUs pioneers a rule-based approach that involves a probabilistic dynamics of the dialogue state. There are still many issues to address:\n• Increase the coverage of the rules to all the classes that were not covered by our work: Factual Modifiers, Helpful Rejections and so on.\n• Develop a proper mechanism of rule adaptation in the presence of lexical modifiers e.g. for Sluices such as “For how long?”.\n• Include grammatical and lexical resources to extract more complex meanings. A simple Short Answer that would not be covered by our rules is:\n(5.1) a: Who is coming tomorrow?\nb: Nobody.\n• Properly evaluate the rules on testing data from different dialogue domains.\nThe last point, perhaps the most important one, would require the development of a corpus of dialogue transcripts annotated with each semantic move and state update. In turn this would require to develop a generic representation of the semantic content of the utterances which is a non-trivial task by itself. A possibility could be to use TTR as semantic representation and reformulate the rules accordingly. Using TTR as basic semantic formalism it could be an interesting challenge to develop probabilistic rules to address a larger set of linguistic phenomena besides NSUs."

      "text" : "For our work on the NSU resolution we develop a rule-based approach based on a probabilistic representation of the dialogue state. It bares similarities with statistical approaches for the resolution such as Raghu et al. (2015). Their work is concentrated on follow-up NSU questions such as:\n(5.2) a: How much for this model?\nb: . . .\na: For this other one?\nTheir approach is based on the combination of keywords from the follow-up question and the original one. From the combination of keywords they build possible meaningful “completions” of the NSU e.g. a completion for the NSU at the third line in (5.2) would\n76\nbe “How much for this other model?”. After generating each possible completions they rank them according to some score and pick the best one.\nDifferently from ours, their approach does not use a high-level semantic representation of the utterances. It would be interesting to try to combine their statistical approach to our probabilistic rule-based one.\nCompare our approach with other existing systems\nAnother useful comparison, and perhaps integration, should be made with the systems originally developed on the theory of Fernández (2006), namely SHARDS (Ginzburg et al., 2007) and one of its extensions CLARIE (Purver, 2006). The former is a system for ellipsis resolution that can handle Short Answer, Sluices and Affirmative Answers. The latter is a dialogue system developed to deal with clarification requests and, among them, Clarification Ellipsis, implementing the theory of Ginzburg and Cooper (2004) on top of the GoDiS dialogue system (Larsson et al., 2000). Both are based on the HPSG2 framework from Ginzburg and Sag (2000), which is substantially different from our current design. Our framework lacks a grammar and other lexical resources that are indeed needed to build a functional system. It would be interesting to further develop our approach taking advantage from aspects of those systems and perhaps even integrate them into our architecture based on probabilistic rules.\n2Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar.\n77"

      "text" : "In this appendix we provide an overview of the probabilistic rules used for updating the context that have been implemented in the dialogue system for the testing of the resolution rules. As described in Section 4.5, the dialogue system that we implemented is focused on conversation of the human-machine kind therefore we will be using the notations am and um to refer respectively to the dialogue act performed by the system and the corresponding raw utterance. Following the aforementioned interaction model, the dialogue context is only representing the pieces of information known by the system. The context update rules are needed in order to make the dialogue context evolve along with the user acts and relative system reactions. In particular we need the rules for updating the QUD and the Facts variables. These rules are inspired by, but not limited to, Ginzburg (2012). Section 2.2 gives the background knowledge for the rules from Ginzburg (2012).\nThe rules shown in this appendix are not meant to give an extensive look on the system architecture but rather an high-level insight on the behavior of the system. These rules may differ from the actual implementation due to technicalities but still they fit for the purpose of the explanation. We will not talk about other modules of the system that we used in the implementation (i.e. NLU, NLG and action selection) because they have been implemented merely for toy examples of interaction on simple domains and they are not directly concerning the interpretation of NSUs. Follows a description of each context update rule."

For this reason we concentrate on “machine-driven” conversations such as the one used in Section 4.5. We assume that in this type of dialogues issues are raised only by the system while the user limits to answer. In this scenario is common to find NSUs uttered by the users, as it often happens in the Communicator dataset.\n79\nGiven this setting, we update the QUD only when the system raises a new issue and we downdate it only when the system accepts a user assertion which resolves the maximal element. We also take into account that asking a question and asserting a proposition may have different probabilities to update the QUD. In the rules below we encode the asking with full probability and the asserting with a probability of 0.75, although, as remarked many times throughout this thesis, those probabilities may actually be estimated on real data.\nqud-increment :\n∀ q,x if (am=Ask(q(x))) thenP  qud[qud.size + 1].q← q(x), qud[qud.size + 1].utt← um,\nqud.size← qud.size + 1  = 1 else if (am=Assert(q(x))) thenP  qud[qud.size + 1].q← q(x), qud[qud.size + 1].utt← um,\nqud.size← qud.size + 1  = 0.75 The rule below handles the update of the FEC of the newly added QUD element.

For this reason probabilistic rules are particularly suited for our purpose since, in this way, we could reuse many theoretical aspects from Ginzburg (2012) and Fernández (2006). We reinterpreted the variables in the dialogue state as random variables and straightforwardly “converted” the resolution rules into probabilistic rules. In the next sections we explain how we represented the variables in the dialogue state and how we translated the rules from Fernández (2006) into probabilistic rules. First we describe the theoretical aspects from Ginzburg (2012) we employ in our approach. We present then the design of our dialogue context and the rules to resolve the NSUs. We surely take a much simpler approach than Ginzburg (2012) in the modeling of the dialogue state, abstracting intentionally from many details that would add complexity to the modeling.",

    "abstractText" : "Non-sentential utterances (NSUs) are utterances that lack a complete sentential form but whose meaning can be inferred from the dialogue context, such as “OK”, “where?”, “probably at his apartment”. The interpretation of non-sentential utterances is an important problem in computational linguistics since they constitute a frequent phenomena in dialogue and they are intrinsically context-dependent. The interpretation of NSUs is the task of retrieving their full semantic content from their form and the dialogue context. NSUs also come in a wide variety of forms and functions and classifying them in the right category is a prerequisite to their interpretation. The first half of this thesis is devoted to the NSU classification task. Our work builds upon Fernández et al. (2007) which present a series of machine-learning experiments on the classification of NSUs. We extended their approach with a combination of new features and semi-supervised learning techniques. The empirical results presented in this thesis show a modest but significant improvement over the state-of-the-art classification performance. The consecutive, yet independent, problem is how to infer an appropriate semantic representation of such NSUs on the basis of the dialogue context. Fernández (2006) formalizes this task in terms of “resolution rules” built on top of the Type Theory with Records (TTR), a theoretical framework for dialogue context modeling (Ginzburg, 2012). We argue that logic-based formalisms, such as TTR, have a number of shortcomings when dealing with conversational data, which often include partially observable knowledge and nondeterministic phenomena. An alternative to address these issues is to rely on probabilistic modeling of the dialogue context. Our work is focused on the reimplementation of the resolution rules from Fernández (2006) with a probabilistic account of the dialogue state. The probabilistic rules formalism (Lison, 2014) is particularly suited for this task because, similarly to the framework developed by Ginzburg (2012) and Fernández (2006), it involves the specification of update rules on the variables of the dialogue state to capture the dynamics of the conversation. However, the probabilistic rules can also encode probabilistic knowledge, thereby providing a principled account of ambiguities in the NSU resolution process. In the second part of this thesis, we present our proof-of-concept framework for NSU resolution using probabilistic rules.",
