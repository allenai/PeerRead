INTRODUCTION\nMany machine learning algorithms require computing distances between input data points, be it for clustering, classification, or search. Selecting the distance measure is, therefore, an important concern; though the answer is task specific. When supervised or weakly supervised information is available, selection of the distance function can itself be cast as a learning problem called “metric learning” [1, 2].\nIn its most common form, metric learning seeks to learn a Euclidean metric. An abstract approach is to take input data in Rn and learn a linear map Φ : Rn → Rm, so that the Euclidean distance ‖Φ(x) − Φ(y)‖ can be used to measure the distance between points x,y ∈ Rn. More generally, the map Φ can also be nonlinear.\nThe problem of learning linear maps was introduced in [3] as “Mahalanobis metric learning.” Since then metric learning has witnessed a sequence of improvements both in modeling and algorithms (see related work). More broadly, the idea of linearly transforming input features is a bigger theme across machine learning and statistics; encompassing whitening transforms, linear dimensionality reduction, Euclidean metric learning, and more [1, 4].\nWe revisit the task of learning a Euclidean metric. Like most Euclidean metric learning methods, we also seek to learn a Mahalanobis distance1\ndA(x,x ′) = (x− x′)TA(x− x′), (1)\nwhere x,x′ ∈ Rd are input vectors, and A is a d × d real, symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix2. Like other metric learning approaches we also assume weak-supervision, which\nPourya Habib Zadeh and Reshad Hosseini are with the School of ECE, College of Engineering, University of Tehran.

The true metric is √ dA; but in accord\nwith metric learning literature we call (1) a distance. 2Do not confuse SPD with positive semi-definite matrices.\nis provided through the sets of pairs\nS := {(xi,xj) | xi and xj are in the same class} D := {(xi,xj) | xi and xj are in different classes}.\nUnlike other Euclidean metric learning methods, however, we follow a much simpler yet fresh new approach.\nSpecifically, we make the following main contributions:\n– Formulation. We formulate Euclidean metric learning from first principles following intuitive geometric reasoning; we name our setup “Geometric Mean Metric Learning” (GMML) and cast it as an unconstrained smooth, strictly convex optimization problem.\n– Solution & insights. We show that our formulation admits a closed form solution, which not only also enjoys connections to the Riemannian geometry of SPD matrices (and thus explains the name GMML) but also has important empirical consequences.\n– Validation. We consider multi-class classification using the learned metrics, and validate GMML by comparing it against widely used metric learning methods. GMML runs up to three orders of magnitude faster while consistently delivering equal or higher classification accuracy."

      "text" : "We recall below some related work to help place GMML in perspective. We omit a discussion of nonlinear methods, and other variations of the basic Euclidean task outlined above; for these, we refer the reader to both kernelized metric learning [5] and other techniques as summarized in the recent surveys of Kulis [1] and Bellet et al. [6].\nProbably the earliest work to formulate metric learning is [3], sometimes referred to as MMC. This method minimizes the sum of distances over similar points while trying to ensure that dissimilar points are far away from each other. Using the sets S and D, MMC solves the optimization problem\nmin A 0\n∑\n(xi,xj)∈S\ndA(xi,xj)\nsuch that ∑\n(xi,xj)∈D\n√ dA(xi,xj) ≥ 1. (2)\nXing et al. [3] use √ dA instead of the distance dA because under dA, problem (2) has a trivial rank-one solution. To optimize (2), they use a gradient-descent algorithm combined with a projection onto the set of positive semi-definite matrices. The term ∑\n(xi,xj)∈S dA(xi,xj) is also used in the other metric\nlearning methods like LMNN [2] and MCML [7] as a part of their cost functions.\n2 Information-Theoretic Metric Learning (ITML) [5], aims to satisfy the similarity and dissimilarity constraints while staying as “close” as possible to a predefined matrix. This closeness is measured using the LogDet divergence Dld(A,A0) := tr(AA−10 ) − log det(AA−10 ) − d; and ITML is formulated as follows:\nmin A 0 Dld(A,A0)\nsuch that dA(x,y) ≤ u, (x,y) ∈ S, dA(x,y) ≥ l, (x,y) ∈ D,\n(3)\nwhere u, v ∈ R are threshold parameters, chosen to encourage distance between similar points to be small and between dissimilar points be large. Similar to ITML, Meyer et al. [8] propose the formulation\nmin A 0\n∑\n(xi,xj)∈S\nmax ( 0 , l − dA(xi,xj) )2\n+ ∑\n(xi,xj)∈D\nmax ( 0 , dA(xi,xj)− u )2 ,\n(4)\nfor which they use Riemannian techniques to minimize the cost function. Although (4) does not use any regularizer, the authors observed good classification performance.\nThere exist several attempts for achieving high scalability with both the dimensionality and the number of constraints in the metric learning methods; some examples include [9, 10, 11, 12].\nHowever, the focus of our paper is different: we are concerned with the formulation of Euclidean metric learning. Remarkably, our new formulation admits a closed form solution, which turns out to be 3 orders of magnitude faster than established competing methods."

      "text" : "As discussed above, the guiding idea behind Euclidean metric learning is to ultimately obtain a metric that yields “small” distances for similar points and “big” ones for dissimilar ones. Different metric learning methods try to fulfill this guideline either implicitly or explicitly.\nThe main idea that we introduce below is in how we choose to include the impact of the dissimilar points. Like one of earliest metric learning methods MMC, we propose to find a matrix A that decreases the sum of distances over all the similar points, but unlike all previous methods, instead of treating dissimilar points asymmetrically, we propose to measure their interpoint distances using A−1, and to add their contribution to the overall objective. More precisely, we propose the following novel objective function:\n∑\n(xi,xj)∈S\ndA(xi,xj) + ∑\n(xi,xj)∈D\ndA−1(xi,xj). (5)\nIn the sequel, we write d̂A ≡ dA−1 for brevity.\nA. Insights\nLet us provide some intuition behind our proposed objective (5). These insights are motivated by the idea that we may increase the Mahalanobis distance between dissimilar\npoints dA(x,y) by decreasing d̂A(x,y). The first idea is the simple observation that the distance dA(x,y) increases monotonically in A, whereas the distance d̂A(x,y) decreases monotonically in A. This observation follows from the following well-known result:\nProposition 1. Let A,B be (strictly) positive definite matrices such that A ≻ B. Then, A−1 ≺ B−1.\nThe second idea (which essentially reaffirms the first) is that the gradients of dA and d̂A point in nearly opposite directions. Therefore, infinitesimally decreasing dA leads to an increase in d̂A. Indeed, the (Euclidean) gradient of dA(x,y) is\n∂dA ∂A = uuT ,\nwhere u = x − y; this is a rank-one positive semi-definite matrix. The gradient of d̂A(x,y) is\n∂d̂A ∂A = −A−1uuTA−1,\nwhich is a rank-one matrix with a negative eigenvalue. It is easy to see that the inner product of these two gradients is negative, as desired."

Rewriting the Mahalanobis distance using traces, we turn (5) into the optimization problem\nmin A≻0\n∑\n(xi,xj)∈S\ntr(A(xi − xj)(xi − xj)T )\n+ ∑\n(xi,xj)∈D\ntr(A−1(xi − xj)(xi − xj)T ). (6)\nWe define now the following two important matrices:\nS := ∑\n(xi,xj)∈S\n(xi − xj)(xi − xj)T ,\nD := ∑\n(xi,xj)∈D\n(xi − xj)(xi − xj)T , (7)\nwhich denote the similarity and dissimilarity matrices, respectively. The matrices S and D are scaled second sample moments of the differences between similar points and the differences between dissimilar points. In the rest of this subsection, we assume that S is a SPD matrix, which is a realistic assumption in many situations. For the cases where S is just a positive semi-definite matrix, the regularized version can be used; we treat this case in Section II-C.\nUsing (7), the minimization problem (6) yields the basic optimization formulation of GMML, namely\nmin A≻0\nh(A) := tr(AS) + tr(A−1D). (8)\nThe GMML cost function (8) has several remarkable properties, which may not be apparent at first sight. Below we highlight some of these to help build greater intuition, as well as to help us minimize it.\nThe first key property of h(A) is that it is both strictly convex and strictly geodesically convex. Therefore, if ∇h(A) = 0\n3 has a solution, that solution will be the global minimizer. Before proving this key property of h, let us recall some material that is also helpful for the remainder of the section.\nGeodesic convexity is the generalization of ordinary (linear) convexity to (nonlinear) manifolds and metric spaces [13, 14]. On Riemannian manifolds, geodesics are curves with zero acceleration that at the same time locally minimize the Riemannian distance between two points. The set of SPD matrices forms a Riemannian manifold of nonpositive curvature [15, Ch. 6]. We denote this manifold by S+. The geodesic curve joining A to B on the SPD manifold is denoted by\nA♯tB = A 1/2\n( A−1/2BA−1/2 )t A1/2, t ∈ [0, 1].\nThis notation for geodesic is customary, and in the literature, γ(t) is also used. Moreover, the entire set of SPD matrices is geodesically convex, as there is a geodesic between every two points in the set. On this set, one defines geodesically convex functions as follows.\nDefinition 2. A function f on a geodesically convex subset of a Riemannian manifold is geodesically convex, if for all points A and B in this set, it satisfies\nf(A♯tB) ≤ tf(A) + (1− t)f(B), t ∈ [0, 1].\nIf for t ∈ (0, 1) the above inequality is strict, the function is called strictly geodesically convex.\nWe refer the reader to [16] for more on geodesic convexity for SPD matrices. We are ready to state a simple but key convexity result.\nTheorem 3. The cost function h in (8) is both strictly convex and strictly geodesically convex on the SPD manifold.\nProof: The first term in (8) is linear, hence convex, while the second term is strictly convex [17, Ch. 3], viewing SPD matrices as a convex cone [see 18, Thm. 2.6]. Thus, strict convexity of h(A) is obvious. Therefore, we concentrate on proving its strict geodesic convexity. Using continuity, it suffices to show midpoint strict convexity, namely\nh(A♯1/2B) < 1 2h(A) + 1 2h(B).\nIt is well-known [15, Ch. 4] that for two distinct SPD matrices, we have the operator inequality\nA♯1/2B ≺ 12A+ 12B. (9)\nSince S is SPD, is immediately follows that\ntr ( (A♯1/2B)S) < 1 2 tr(AS) + 1 2 tr(BS). (10)\nFrom the definition of ♯t, a brief manipulation shows that\n(A♯tB) −1 = A−1♯tB −1.\nThus, in particular for the midpoint (with t = 1/2) we have\ntr ( (A♯1/2B) −1D) < 12 tr(A −1D) + 12 tr(B −1D). (11)\nAdding (10) and (11), we obtained the desired result.\nSolution via geometric mean. The optimal solution to (8) will reveal one more reason why we invoke geodesic convexity. Since the constraint set of (8) is open and the objective is strictly convex, to find its global minimum, it is enough to find a point where the gradient ∇h vanishes. Differentiating with respect to A, this yields\n∇h(A) = S −A−1DA−1.\nSetting this gradient to zero results in the equation\n∇h(A) = 0 =⇒ ASA = D. (12)\nEquation (12) is a Riccati equation whose unique solution is nothing but the midpoint of the geodesic joining S−1 to D (see e.g., Bhatia [15, 1.2.13]). Indeed,\nA = S−1♯1/2 D = S −1/2(S1/2DS1/2)1/2S−1/2.\nObserve by construction this solution is SPD, therefore, the constraint of optimization is satisfied.\nIt is this fact that the solution to GMML is given by the midpoint of the geodesic joining the inverse of the second moment matrix of similar points to the second moment matrix of dissimilar points, which gives GMML its name: the midpoint of this geodesic is known as the matrix geometric mean and is a very important object in the study of SPD matrices [15, Ch. 6]."

      "text" : "We have seen that the solution of our method is the geometric mean between S−1 and D. However, in practice the matrix S might sometimes be non-invertible or near-singular. To address this concern, we propose to add a regularizing term to the objective function. This regularizer term can also be used to incorporate prior knowledge about the distance function. In particular, we propose to use\nmin A≻0\nλDsld(A,A0) + tr(AS) + tr(A −1D), (13)\nwhere A0 is the “prior” (SPD matrix) and Dsld(A,A0) is the symmetrized LogDet divergence: Dld(A,A0) + Dld(A0,A), which is equal to\nDsld(A,A0) := tr(AA −1 0 ) + tr(A −1A0)− 2d, (14)\nwhere d is the dimensionality of the data. Interestingly, using (14) and following the argument as above, we see that the minimization problem in (13) with this regularizer also has a closed form solution. After straightforward computations, we obtain the following solution\nAreg = (S + λA −1 0 ) −1♯1/2 (D + λA0), (15)\nthe regularized geometric mean of suitably modified S and D matrices. Observe that as the regularization parameter λ ≥ 0 increases, Areg becomes more similar to A0.\n4 S+ γ(t) S−1 D +A\nFig. 1.

      "heading" : "D. Extension to weighted geometric mean",
      "text" : "The geodesic viewpoint is also key to deciding how one may assign different “weights” to the matrices S and D when computing the GMML solution. This viewpoint is important because merely scaling the cost in (8) to change the balance between S and D is not meaningful as it only scales the resulting solution A by a constant.\nGiven the geometric nature of the GMML’s solution, we replace the linear cost in (8) by a nonlinear one guided by Riemannian geometry of the SPD manifold. The key insight into obtaining a weighted version of GMML comes from a crucial geometric observation. The minimum of (8) is also the minimum to the following optimization problem:\nmin A≻0\nδ2R(A,S −1) + δ2R(A,D), (16)\nwhere δR denotes the Riemannian distance\nδR(X,Y ) := ‖log(Y −1/2XY −1/2)‖F for X,Y ≻ 0, on SPD matrices and ‖·‖F denotes the Frobenius norm.\nOnce we identify the solution of (8) with that of (16), the generalization to the weighted case becomes transparent. We introduce a parameter that characterizes the degree of balance between the cost terms of similarity and dissimilarity data. The weighted GMML formulation is then\nmin A≻0\nht(A) := (1− t) δ2R(A,S−1) + t δ2R(A,D), (17)\nwhere t is a parameter that determines the balance. Unlike (8), which we observed to be strictly convex as well as strictly geodesically convex, problem (17) is not (Euclidean) convex. Fortunately, it is still geodesically convex, because δR itself is geodesically convex. The proof of the geodesic convexity of δR is more involved than that of Theorem 3, and we refer the reader to [15, Ch. 6] for complete details.\nIt can be shown, see e.g., [15, Ch. 6] that the unique solution to (17) is the weighted geometric mean\nA = S−1♯t D, (18)\nthat is, a point on the geodesic from S−1 and D.

In the cases where t = 1/2, it is equal to (15). This solution is our final and complete proposed solution to the linear metric learning problem. The summary of our GMML algorithm for metric learning is presented in Algorithm 1. Empirically, we have observed that the generalized solution (with free t) can significantly outperform the ordinary solution.\nThere are several approaches for fast computation of Riemannian geodesics for SPD matrices, for instance, CholeskySchur and scaled Newton methods [19]. We use CholeskySchur method in our paper to expedite the computation of Riemannian geodesics."

The LMNN method does not have this number of constraints parameter and we used a new version of its toolbox that uses Bayesian optimization for optimizing the model hyper-parameters. We use the default parameters used in ITML and FlatGeo, except we also use a minimum iterations of 104 for the FlatGeo method, because we observed that sometimes FlatGeo stops prematurely leading to a very poor performance. ITML has a regularization parameter that is set by using crossvalidation.\nFigure 2 reports the results for the smaller datasets. The datasets are obtained from the well-known UCI repository [20]. In the plot, the baseline of using Euclidean distance for classification is shown in yellow. It can be seen that GMML outperforms the other three metric learning methods.\nThe figure reports 40 runs of a two-fold splitting of the data. In each run, the data is randomly divided into two equal sets. The regularization parameter λ is set to zero for most of the datasets. We only add a small value of λ when the similarity matrix S becomes singular. For example, since the similarity matrix of the Segment data is near singular, we use the regularized version of our method with λ = 0.1 and A0 equals to the identity matrix.\nWe use five-fold cross-validation for choosing the best parameter t. We tested 18 different values for t in a two-step method. In the first step the best t is chosen among the values {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9}. Then in the second step, 12 values of t are tested within an interval of length 0.02 in the window around the previously selected point.\nFigure 3 shows the effect of the parameter t on the average accuracy of k-NN classifier for five datasets. These datasets are also appeared in Figure 2. It is obvious that in some datasets, going from the ordinary version to the extended version can make the GMML’s performance substantially better.
