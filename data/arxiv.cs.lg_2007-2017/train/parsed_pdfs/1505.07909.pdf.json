      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Intelligence is the ability or capacity that enables the individuals to deal with real situations and profit intellectually from sensory experience. A test of intelligence is designed to formally study the success of an individual in adapting to a specific situation under certain conditions. The most famous test is the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) test, which was first proposed about 100 years ago [29]. Common IQ tests measure various types of abilities such as verbal, mathematical, spatial and reasoning skills. These tests have been widely used in the study of psychology, education, career development, etc. Although a high IQ might not be a necessary condition for a successful life, people would still tag the individual with high IQ by labels of smart or clever.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is the human-like intelligence exhibited by machines or software, which was first activated by the famous Turing test [32] and has attracted a lot of people to study afterwards. The main task of AI is to study and design intelligent agents that perceive the environment and take actions to maximize the chances of success. With the fast development of artificial intelligence, agents have been invented to fulfill many interesting and challenging tasks like face recognition, speech recognition, handwriting recognition, robot soccer, question answering, chess, and natural language processing. However, as far as we know, there are very limited studies of developing an agent to solve IQ tests yet, which in some sense is more challenging, since even common human beings could not always succeed in the tests. Considering that IQ tests have been widely considered as a measure of intelligence, we think it is worth making further investigations whether we can develop an agent that can beat human on solving IQ tests.\nThe commonly used IQ tests contain a few types of questions, among which a significant proportion (around 40%)\nar X\niv :1\n50 5.\n07 90\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n9 M\nay 2\nare verbal questions [8]. The recent progress on deep learning for natural language processing (NLP), such as word embedding technologies, has advanced the ability of machines (or AI agents) to understand the meaning of words and the relations among words. This inspires us to solve the verbal questions in IQ tests by leveraging the word embedding technologies. However, our attempts show that a straightforward application of the word embedding technologies could not result in satisfactory performances. This is actually understandable. Standard word embedding technologies learn one embedding vector for each word based on the co-occurrence information in a text corpus. However, verbal comprehension questions in IQ test usually consider the multiple senses of a word (and often focus on the rare senses), and the complex relations among (polysemous) words. This has clearly exceeded the capability of standard word embedding technologies.\nTo tackle the aforementioned challenge, we propose a novel framework which consists of three components.\nFirst, we build a classifier to recognize the specific type of verbal questions. According to previous studies [8], verbal questions usually include sub-types like analogy, classification, synonym, and antonym. For different types of questions, different kinds of relationships need to be considered and the solvers could have different forms. Therefore, with an effective question type classifier, we may solve the questions in a divide-and-conquer manner and achieve high accuracy.\nSecond, we obtain distributed representations of words and relations by leveraging a novel word embedding method that considers the multi-sense nature of words and the relational knowledge among words (or their senses) contained in dictionaries. In particular, for each polysemous word, we retrieve its number of senses from a dictionary, and conduct clustering on all its context windows in the corpus. Then we attach the example sentences for every sense in the dictionary to the clusters, such that we can tag the polysemous word in each context window with a specific word sense. On top of this, instead of learning one embedding vector for each word, we are able to learn one vector for each pair of wordsense. Furthermore, in addition to learning the embedding vectors for words, we also learn the embedding vectors for relations (e.g., synonym and antonym) at the same time, by incorporating relational knowledge into the objective function of the word embedding learning algorithm. That is, the learning of word-sense representations and relation representations interacts with each other, to effectively incorporate the relational knowledge obtained from dictionaries.\nThird, for each specific type of questions, we propose a simple yet effective solver based on the obtained distributed word-sense representations and relation representations. For example, for analogy questions, we find the answer by minimizing the distance between word-sense pairs in the question and the word-sense pairs in the candidate answers; for antonym questions, we calculate the offset between the representation of the question word of every sense and the representation of each candidate word with every of their possible senses, and then we find the answer by minimizing the distance between the antonym relation representation and the above offsets.\nWe have conducted experiments using a combined IQ test set to test the performance of our proposed framework. The experimental results show that our method can significantly\noutperform several baseline methods for verbal comprehension questions in IQ test. We further deliver the questions in the test set to human beings through Amazon Mechanical Turk1. To our surprise, the average performance of the human beings is even a little lower than that of our proposed method. This is highly encouraging, which somehow shows that with appropriate uses of the deep learning technologies, we could be a further step closer to the true human intelligence."

      "text" : "Intelligence Quotient Test was proposed by William Stern as a scoring method for human intelligence about a century ago [29]. Usually, such tests contain tens of questions for human to complete within a limited time, and then an IQ score is calculated according to the correctness of the answers and several other factors like the age of the human, the time to complete the test, and the behaviors the human perform during the test. Currently, in the mainstream IQ tests, the median raw score of the norming sample is defined as 100 IQ points and the scores each standard deviation up or down are defined as 15 IQ points greater or less. By this definition, approximately 95% of the population scores an IQ between 70 and 130, which is within two standard deviations of the mean.\nCommon IQ tests mainly contain three categories of questions [8]: verbal comprehensive questions, mathematical questions, and logic questions. Verbal questions include several types like analogy, classification, synonym, and antonym, which will be introduced with more details in Section 3. Mathematical questions include several types like algebra, number sequence, and math logic. For example, the task of number sequence problems is to extrapolate some finite sequences of integers. Logic questions often appear in pictorial matrices, the task of which is to identify the missing element that completes the pattern of a pictorial matrix.\nThere has been very few efforts to develop automatic methods to solve IQ tests. Sanghi and Dowe [26] presented a fairly elementary WWW-based computer program that can solve a variety of IQ tests, regularly obtains a score close to the purported average human score of 100. Strannegard et al. [30] proposed an anthropomorphic method for number sequence solvers that targets performance on the level of human role models, and they also presented a method [30] for solving progressive matrix problems in logic questions. Recently, Kushmany et al. [19] proposed an approach for automatically learning to solve algebra word problems, Seo et al. [27] proposed a method to automatically solve geometry problems, and Hosseini et al. [16] proposed an approach to learning to solve simple arithmetic word problems.\nBesides the above efforts, there are also some debates on whether IQ tests are appropriate for evaluating the intelligence of machines or measuring the progress in AI [13], because some IQ test questions might be easily hacked and then correctly answered by some simple tricks. However, we think that these tricks are not principle methods and they cannot be generalized to more novel questions. We would like to do more exploration on using automatical algorithms to solve the IQ test problems.\n1http://www.mturk.com/"

      "text" : "Building distributed word representations [2], a.k.a. word embeddings, has attracted increasing attention in the area of machine learning. Different with conventional one-hot representations of words or distributional word representations based on co-occurrence matrix between words such as LSA [14] and LDA [5], distributed word representations are usually low-dimensional dense vectors trained with neural networks by maximizing the likelihood of a text corpus. Recently, to show its effectiveness in a variety of text mining tasks, a series of works applied deep learning techniques to learn high-quality word representations. For example, Collobert et al. [10, 11] proposed a neural network that can learn a unified word representations suited for several NLP tasks simultaneously. Furthermore, Mikolov et al. proposed efficient neural network models for learning word representations, i.e. word2vec [21]. Under the assumption that similar words yield similar context, the word2vec model maximizes the log likelihood of each word given its context words within a sliding window. The learned word representations show that they can indicate both syntactic and semantic regularities among words.\nNevertheless, since the above works learn word representations mainly based on the word co-occurrence information, it is quite difficult to obtain high quality embeddings for those words with very little context information; on the other hand, large amount of noisy or biased context could give rise to ineffective word embeddings either. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce extra knowledge into the learning process to regularize the quality of word embedding. Some efforts have paid attention to learn word embedding in order to address knowledge base completion and enhancement [7, 28, 34]; however, they did not investigate the other side of the coin, i.e. leveraging knowledge to enhance word representations. Recently, there have been some early attempts on this direction. For example, Luong et al. [20] proposed a neural network model to learn word representations by leveraging morphological knowledge on words. Yu et al. [37] proposed a new learning objective that incorporates both a neural language model objective and a semantic prior knowledge objective to learn improved word representations. Bian et al. [3] recently proposed to leverage morphological, syntactic, and semantic knowledge to advance the learning of word embeddings. Particularly, they explored these types of knowledge to define new basis for word representations, provide additional input information, and serve as auxiliary supervision in the learning process.\nMoreover, all the above models assume that one word has only one embedding no matter whether the word is polysemous or monosemous, which might bring some confusion for the polysemous words. To solve the problem, Huang et al. [17] leveraged the global context information to train an initial word embedding and then proposed a clustering based method to produce multi-sense word embeddings for polysemous words. Recently, Tian et al. [31] proposed to model word polysemy from a probabilistic perspective and integrate it with the word2vec model. However, these models do not leverage any extra knowledge (e.g., relational knowledge) to enhance word representations.\nIn contrast to all the aforementioned works, in this paper, we present a novel method that can produce multi-sense word embeddings powered by relational knowledge, which is more effective to solve the verbal comprehension questions."

      "text" : "In common IQ tests, a large proportion of questions are verbal comprehension questions, which play an important role in deciding the final IQ scores. For example, in Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [33], which is among the most famous IQ test systems, the full-scale IQ is calculated from two IQ scores: Verbal IQ and Performance IQ, and around 38% questions in a typical test are verbal comprehension questions. In another popular system named WoodcockJohnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities [35], the final IQ score is derived from three tests including the Verbal Comprehension Test. Verbal questions can test not only the verbal ability (e.g., understanding polysemy of a word), but also the reasoning ability and induction ability of an individual. According to previous studies [8], verbal questions mainly have the following types: analogy, classification, synonym, and antonym, which are elaborated in detailed as below."

Isotherm is to temperature as isobar is to?

Since different types of questions usually have their unique ways of expressions, the classification task is relatively easy, and we therefore take a simple approach to fulfill the task.

Then we train an SVM [12] classifier with linear kernel on a portion of labeled question data, and apply it to other questions. The question labels include Analogy-I, Analogy-II, Classification, Synonym, and Antonym. We use the one-vs-rest training strategy [4] to obtain a linear SVM classifier for each question type."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4.2 Embedding of Word-Senses and Relations",
      "text" : "The second component of our framework leverages deep learning technologies to learn distributed representations for words (i.e. word embedding). Note that in the context of verbal question answering, we have some specific requirements on this learning process. Verbal questions in IQ test usually consider the multiple senses of a word (and focus on the rare senses), and the complex relations among (polysemous) words. Figure 1 shows an example on the multisense of words and the relations among word senses. We can see that irrational have three senses. Its first sense has an antonym relation with the second sense of rational, while its second sense has a synonym relation with nonsensical and an antonym relation with the first sense of rational.\nThe above challenge has exceeded the capability of standard word embedding technologies. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that considers the multisense nature of words and integrate the relational knowledge among words (or their senses) into the learning process. In particular, our approach consists of two steps. The first step aims at labeling a word in the text corpus with its specific sense, and the second step employs both the labeled text corpus and the relational knowledge contained in dictionaries to simultaneously learn embeddings for both word-sense pairs and relations.\n4.2.1 Multi-Sense Identification While word embedding has shown its success in many\ntext mining applications, one common limitation of existing studies is the assumption of single-sense representation. In practice, many words have multiple senses, which can be wildly different from each other. Thus, learning one single embedding vector for each word simply cannot capture the different senses of polysemous words. Several previous studies [25, 17, 31] have proposed using multiple representations to capture the different senses of a word. In this framework, we present a way, similar to [17], of using pre-learned singlesense embeddings to represent each context window, which can then be clustered to perform word sense discrimination. Beyond the method in [17], we also take advantages of additional knowledge in online dictionaries to regularize the word sense discrimination.\nFirst, we learn a single-sense word embedding by using the skip-gram method in word2vec [21] (see Figure 2). In particular, a sliding window is employed on the input text stream to generate the training samples. In each sliding window, the model tries to use the central word as input to predict the surrounding words. Given a sequence of training text stream w1, w2, w3, ..., wK , the objective of the skip-gram model is to maximize the following average log probability:\nL = 1\nK K∑ k=1 ∑ −N≤j≤N,j 6=0 log p (wk+j | wk) , (1)\nwhere wk is the central word, wk+j is a surrounding word, K is the length of the training text stream, and N indicates the context window size is 2N + 1. The conditional probability p(wk+j |wk) is defined in the following softmax function:\np (wk+j | wk) = exp\n( v ′ wk+j T vwk ) ∑V\nw=1 exp ( v′w T vwk ) , (2) where vw and v ′ w are the input and output latent variables,\ni.e. the input and output representation vectors of w, and V is the vocabulary size.\nSecond, we gather the context windows of all occurrences of a word used in the skip-gram model, and represent each context by a weighted average of the pre-learned embedding vectors of the context words. We use TF·IDF to define the weighting function, where we regard each context window of the word as a short document to calculate the document frequency. Specifically, for a word w0, each of its context window can be denoted by (w−N , · · · , w0, · · · , wN ). Then we represent the window by calculating the weighted average of the pre-learned embedding vectors of the context words as below,\nξ = 1\n2N N∑ i=−N,i 6=0 gwivwi , (3)\nwhere gwi is the TF·IDF score of wi, and vwi is the prelearned embedding vector of wi. After that, for each word, we use spherical k-means to cluster all its context representations, where cluster number k is set as the number of senses of this word in the online dictionary.\nThird, we match each cluster to the corresponding sense in the dictionary. On one hand, we represent each cluster by the average embedding vector of all those context windows included in the cluster. For example, suppose word w0 has k senses and thus it has k clusters of context windows, we denote the average embedding vectors for these clusters as ξ̄1, · · · , ξ̄k. On the other hand, since the online dictionary uses some descriptions and example sentences to interpret each word sense, we can represent each word sense\nby the average embedding of those words including its description words and the words in the corresponding example sentences. Here, we assume the representation vectors (based on the online dictionary) for the k senses of w0 are ζ1, · · · , ζk. After that, we consecutively match each cluster to its closest word sense in terms of the distance computed in the word embedding space, i.e.,\n(ξ̄i′ , ζj′) = argmin i,j=1,··· ,k d(ξ̄i, ζj), (4)\nwhere d(·, ·) calculates the Euclidean distance and (ξ̄i′ , ζj′) is the first matched pair of window cluster and word sense. Here, we simply take a greedy strategy. That is, we remove ξ̄i′ and ζj′ from the cluster vector set and the sense vector set, and recursively run (4) to find the next matched pair till all the pairs are found. Finally, each word occurrence in the corpus is relabeled by its associated word sense, which will be used to learn the embeddings for word-sense pairs in Section 4.2.2.\n4.2.2 Co-Learning Word-Sense Pair Representations and Relation Representations\nAfter relabeling the text corpus, different occurrences of a polysemous word may correspond to its different senses, or more accurately word-sense pairs. We then learn the embeddings for word-sense pairs and relations (obtained from dictionaries, such as synonym and antonym) simultaneously, by integrating relational knowledge into the objective function of the word embedding learning model like skip-gram.\nInspired by some recent work on multi-relation model [6, 36] that builds relationships between entities by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional representations of the entities, we propose to use a function Er as described below to capture the relational knowledge.\nSpecifically, the existing relational knowledge extracted from dictionaries, such as synonym, antonym, etc., can be naturally represented in the form of a triplet (head, relation, tail) (denoted by (hi, r, tj) ∈ S, where S is the set of relational knowledge), which consists of two word-sense pairs (i.e. word h with its i-th sense and word t with its j-th sense), h, t ∈ W (W is the set of words) and a relationship r ∈ R (R is the set of relationships). To learn the relation representations, we make an assumption that relationships between words can be interpreted as translation operations and they can be represented by vectors. The principle in this model is that if the relationship (hi, r, tj) exists, the representation of the word-sense pair tj should be close to that of hi plus the representation vector of the relationship r, i.e.\nhi + r; otherwise, hi + r should be far away from tj . Note that this model learns word-sense pair representations and relation representations in a unified continuous embedding space.\nAccording to the above principle, we define Er as a marginbased regularization function over the set of relational knowledge S, Er = ∑\n(hi,r,tj)∈S ∑ (h ′ ,r,t ′ )∈S′\n(hi,r,tj)\n[ γ + d(hi + r, tj) − d(h ′ + r, t ′ ) ] + .\nHere [X]+ denotes the positive part of X, γ > 0 is a margin hyperparameter, and d(·, ·) is the distance measure for the words in the embedding space. For simplicity, we again define d(·, ·) as the Euclidean distance. The set of corrupted triplets S ′ (h,r,t) is defined as:\nS ′ (hi,r,tj) =\n{ (h ′ , r, t) }⋃{ (h, r, t ′ ) } , (5)\nwhich is constructed from S by replacing either the head word-sense pair or the tail word-sense pair by another randomly selected word with its randomly selected sense.\nNote that the optimization process might trivially minimize Er by simply increasing the norms of word-sense pair representations and relation representations. To avoid this problem, we use an additional constraint on the norms, which is a commonly-used trick in the literature [7]. However, instead of enforcing the L2-norm of the representations to 1 as used in [7], we adopt a soft norm constraint on the relation representations as below:\nri = 2σ(xi)− 1, (6)\nwhere σ(·) is the sigmoid function σ(xi) = 1/(1 + e−xi), ri is the i-th dimension of relation vector r, and xi is a latent variable, which guarantees that every dimension of the relation representation vector is within the range (−1, 1).\nBy combining the skip-gram objective function and the regularization function derived from relational knowledge, we get the following combined objective Jr that incorporates relational knowledge into the word-sense pair embedding calculation process,\nJr = αEr − L, (7)\nwhere α is the combination coefficient. Our goal is to minimize the combined objective Jr, which can be optimized using back propagation neural networks. Figure 3 shows the structure of the proposed model. By using this model, we can obtain the representations for both word-sense pairs and relations simultaneously."

      "heading" : "4.3 Solver for Each Type of Questions",
      "text" : "In this subsection, we define solvers for all types of verbal questions, by leveraging the embedding vectors for wordsense pairs and relations learned above.\n4.3.1 Analogy-I For the Analogy-I questions like “A is to B as C is to\n?”, Mikolov et al. [21] showed that such analogical relations can be reflected by word vector offsets between each pair of words. For example, in Man is to woman as king is to queen, we have v(woman) − v(man) ≈ v(queen) − v(king). Inspired by this, we answer such questions by optimizing:\nD = argmax ib,ia,ic,id′ ;D ′∈T cos(v(B,ib) − v(A,ia) + v(C,ic), v(D′,id′ )),\n(8) where T contains all the candidate answers, cos means cosine similarity, and ib, ia, ic, id′ are the indexes for the word senses of B,A,C,D′ respectively. Finally D is selected as the answer.\n4.3.2 Analogy-II As the form of the Analogy-II questions is like “A is to ?\nas C is to ?” with two lists of candidate answers, we can apply an optimization method as below to select the best (B,D) pair,\nargmax ib′ ,ia,ic,id′ ;B ′∈T1,D′∈T2 cos(v(B′,ib′ ) − v(A,ia) + v(C,ic), v(D′,id′ )), (9) where T1, T2 are two lists of candidate words. Thus we get the answers B and D that can form an analogical relation between word pair (A, B) and word pair (C, D) under a certain specific word sense combination.\n4.3.3 Classification For the Classification questions, we leverage the property\nthat words with similar co-occurrence information are distributed close to each other in the embedding space. As there is one word in the list that does not belong to others, it does not have similar co-occurrence information with other words in the training corpus, and thus this word should be far away from other words in the word embedding space.\nAccording to the above discussion, we first calculate a group of mean vectorsmiw1 ,··· ,iwN of all the candidate words with any possible word senses as below,\nmiw1 ,··· ,iwN = 1\nN ∑ wj∈T v(wj ,iwj ), (10)\nwhere T is the set of candidate words, N is the capacity of T , wj is a word in T ; iwj (j = 1, · · · , N ; iwj = 1, · · · , kwj ) is the index for the word senses of wj , and kwj (j = 1, · · · , N) is the number of word senses of wj . Therefore, the number\nof the mean vectors is M = ∏N\nj=1 kwj . As both N and kwj are very small, the computation cost is acceptable. Then, we choose the word with such a sense that it is the farthest away from one of the mean vectors in the embedding space as the answer, i.e.,\nw = argmax iwj ;wj∈T ;l=1,··· ,M d(v(wj ,iwj ),ml). (11)\n4.3.4 Synonym For the Synonym questions, we empirically explored two\nsolvers. For the first solver, we also leverage the property\nthat words with similar co-occurrence information are located closely in the word embedding space. Therefore, given the question word wq and the candidate words wi, we can find the answer by the following optimization problem.\nw = argmin iwq ,iwj ;wj∈T d(v(wj ,iwj ), v(wq,iwq )), (12)\nwhere T is the set of candidate words. The second solver is based on the minimization objective of the translation distance between entities in the relational knowledge model (5). Specifically, we calculate the offset vector between the embedding of question word wq and each word wj in the candidate list. Then, we set the answer w as the candidate word with which the offset is the closest to the representation vector of the synonym relation rs, i.e.,\nw = argmin iwq ,iwj ;wj∈T ∣∣|v(wj ,iwj ) − v(wq,iwq )| − rs∣∣. (13) In practice, we found the second solver performs better (the results are listed in Section 5).2\n4.3.5 Antonym Similar to solving the Synonym questions, we explored\ntwo solvers for Antonym questions as well. That is, the first solver (14) is based on the small offset distance between semantically close words whereas the second solver (15) leverages the translation distance between two words’ offset and the embedding vector of the antonym relation. One might doubt on the reasonableness of the first solver given that we aim to find an answer word with opposite meaning for the target word (i.e. antonym). We explain it here that since antonym and its original word have similar co-occurrence information, based on which the embedding vectors are derived, thus the embedding vectors of both words with antonym relation will still lie closely in the embedding space.\nw = argmin iwq ,iwj ;wj∈T d(v(wj ,iwj ), v(wq,iwq )), (14)\nw = argmin iwq ,iwj ;wj∈T ∣∣|v(wj ,iwj ) − v(wq,iwq )| − ra∣∣, (15) where T is the set of candidate words and ra is the representation vector of the antonym relation. Again we found that the second solver performs better. Similarly, for skip-gram, only the first solver is applied."

      "text" : "5.1.1 Training Set for Word Embedding In our experiments, we trained word embeddings on a pub-\nlicly available text corpus named wiki2014 3, which is a large text snapshot from Wikipedia. After being pre-processed\n2For our baseline embedding modes skip-gram, since it does not assume the relation representations explicitly, we use the first solver for it. 3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_ download\nby removing all the html meta-data and replacing the digit numbers by English words, the final training corpus contains totally more than 3.4 billion word tokens, and the number of unique words, i.e. the vocabulary size, is about 2 million.\n5.1.2 IQ Test Set According to our study, there is no online dataset specifi-\ncally released for verbal comprehension questions, although there are many online IQ tests for users to play with. In addition, most of the online tests only calculate the final IQ scores but do not provide the correct answers. Therefore, we only use the online questions to train the verbal question classifier described in Section 4.1. Specifically, we manually collected and labeled 30 verbal questions from the online IQ test Websites4 for each of the five types (i.e. AnalogyI, Analogy-II, Classification, Synonym, and Antonym) and trained an one-vs-rest SVM classifier for each type. The total accuracy on the training set itself is 95.0%. The classifier was then applied in the test set below.\nWe collected a set of verbal comprehension questions associated with correct answers from the published IQ test books, such as [8, 9, 23, 18], and we used this collection as the test set to evaluate the effectiveness of our new framework. In total, this test set contains 232 questions with the corresponding answers.5 The statistics of each question type are listed in Table 1.\n5.1.3 GRE Antonym Set Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is a standardized\ntest that is required in the admission process of most graduate schools in the United States, which can reflect students’ advanced verbal ability. In our experiments, we applied our framework to a public GRE Antonym Dataset [22] containing 162 questions."

      "heading" : "5.2 Compared Methods",
      "text" : "In the following experiments, we compare our new relation knowledge powered model to several baselines. Random Guess Model (RG). Random guess is the most straightforward way for an agent to solve questions. In our experiments, we used a random guess agent which would select an answer randomly regardless what the question was. To measure the performance of random guess, we ran each task for 5 times and calculated the average accuracy.\nHuman Performance (HP). Since IQ tests are designed to evaluate human intelligence, it is quite natural to leverage human performance as a baseline. To collect human answers on the test questions, we delivered them to human beings through Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing Internet marketplace that allows people to participate Human Intelligence Tasks. In our study, we published\n4E.g., http://wechsleradultintelligencescale.com/ 5It can be downloaded from http://research.microsoft. com/en-us/um/beijing/events/DL-WSDM-2015/ VerbalQuestions.zip.\nfive Mechanical Turk jobs, one job corresponding to one specific question type. The jobs were delivered to 200 people. During this study, we collected the information of the participants’ age and education background, and also measured the accuracy with respect to different age range or education background, separately.\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation Model (LDA). This baseline model leveraged one of the most classical distributional word representations, i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [5]. In particular, we trained word representations using LDA on wiki2014 with the topic number 1000.\nSkip-Gram Model (SG). In this baseline, we applied the word embedding trained by skip-gram [21] (denoted by SG-1). In particular, when using skip-gram to learn the embedding on wiki2014, we set the window size as 5, the embedding dimension as 500 and 1000, the negative sampling count as 3, and the epoch number as 3. In addition, we also employed a pre-trained word embedding by Google6 with the dimension of 300 (denoted by SG-2). Multi-Sense Model (MS). In this baseline, we applied the multi-sense word embedding models proposed in [17] and [31] (denoted by MS-1 and MS-2 respectively). For MS-1, we directly used the published multi-sense word embedding vectors by the authors7, in which they set 10 senses for the top 5% most frequent words. For MS-2, we adopted the same configurations as MS-1.\nRelation Knowledge Powered Model (RK). This is our proposed method in Section 4. In particular, when learning the embedding on wiki2014, we set the window size as 5, the embedding dimension as 500, the negative sampling count as 3 (i.e. the number of random selected negative triples in S′), and the epoch number as 3. We adopted the online Longman Dictionary as the dictionary used in multisense clustering. We used a public relation knowledge set, WordRep [15], for relation training.8"

      "heading" : "5.3 Experimental Results",
      "text" : "5.3.1 Accuracy of Question Classifier We applied the question classifier trained in Section 5.1.2\non the test set in Table 1, and got the total accuracy 93.1%.\n6https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ 7http://ai.stanford.edu/~ehhuang/ 8Note that Sanghi et al. [26] built an IQ test solver using WWW-based computer program. However, they only introduced the solution to the Classification question but did not discuss the solutions to the other types of verbal questions. Thus, we will not compare our model with this approach.\nIn RG and HP, the question classifier was not needed. In SG and RK, the wrongly classified questions were also sent to the corresponding wrong solver to find an answer. If the solver returned an empty result (which was usually caused by invalid input format, e.g., an Analogy-II question was wrongly input to the Classification solver), we would randomly select an answer.\n5.3.2 Participants for Measuring Human Performance We delivered the test questions to human beings through\nAmazon Mechanical Turk to collect human answers on the test questions. To gain a better understanding on the performance of human, we summarized the statistics of the participants to measure the human performance.\nTable 2 shows the statistics of the distribution of participants’ age over each type of test questions. From this table, we can find that most of the participants are in the age of 18-39 for every type of test questions. Some specific question types, such as Classification and Antonym, tend to attract more younger participants compared with elder ones.\nTable 3 reports the statistics of the distribution of participants’ education background over each type of test questions. From this table, we can observe that, for every test question type, more than 80% participants hold either high school or bachelor as their highest education levels, while the others hold even higher education degrees. Such statistics ensure that our participants might represent the normal human intelligence.\nquestions by using all the approaches mentioned in Section 5.2. From this table, we can find that our RK model can achieve the best overall accuracy than all the other methods. In particular, our model can raise the overall accuracy by about 6% over HP. We can also observe that, even without using any extra knowledge but context co-occurrence, the SG and MS models can significantly outperform RG. These results are quite impressive, indicating the great potential of using machine to comprehend human knowledge and even achieve the comparable level of human intelligence. In addition, we can observe that our RK model is empirically superior than the two multi-sense algorithms MS-1 and MS2, demonstrating that it is important to adopt less model parameters and use online dictionary in building the multisense embedding model.\n5.3.4 Accuracy in Different Question Types Table 4 also reports the accuracy of answering various\ntypes of verbal questions by each comparing method. From the table, we can observe that the SG and MS models can achieve competitive accuracy on some certain question types (like Synonym) compared with HP. After incorporating knowledge into learning word embedding, our RK model can improve the accuracy over all question types. Moreover, the table shows that our RK model can result in a big improvement over HP on the question types of Synonym and Classification, while its accuracy on the other question types is not so significant as these two types.\n5.3.5 Comparison with Different Human Age In addition to the comparison in terms of overall accu-\nracy, Table 4 illustrates the accuracy of answering verbal questions by human with different age segments. From the table, we can find that elder people tend to achieve better overall accuracy than younger groups, while such trend may not be consistent under some certain question types like Antonym. This table also reveals that our RK model can reach the competitive performance of the human under the age from 40 to 60, which indicates the great potential of the word embedding to comprehend human knowledge and form up certain intelligence.\nquestions by human with different education background. From the table, we can find that people with higher education degrees tend to achieve better accuracy in terms of any question type than those with lower degrees. This is consistent to the common sense. This table also reveals that our RK model can reach the intelligence level between the people with the bachelor degrees and those with the master degrees, which also implies the great potential of the word embedding to comprehend human knowledge and form up certain intelligence.\n5.3.7 Accuracy in GRE Antonym Question Table 5 demonstrates the accuracy of solving GRE Antonym\nquestions by using all the approaches mentioned in Section 5.2. This table shows that our RK model performs better than the RG, SG, and MS models. Also, RK can achieve better accuracy than the human under the age from 18 to 29 and people with high school degree, though not achieve a better performance than the human overall accuracy. This result further demonstrates the effectiveness of our RK method since GRE is assumed to be much more difficult than the verbal questions in standard IQ test."

      "heading" : "6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK",
      "text" : "In this paper, we investigated how to automatically solve verbal comprehension questions in the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) Test by using AI technologies, especially the deep learning techniques that are recently developed and successfully applied in text mining and natural language processing. To fulfill the challenging task, especially in terms of the multiple senses of words and the complex relations among words, we proposed a novel framework consisting of three components: (i) the first component is a classifier that aims to recognize the specific type of a verbal comprehension question; (ii) the second component leverages a novel deep learning technique to co-learn the representations of both word-sense pairs and relations among words (or their senses); (iii) the last component is comprised of dedicated solvers, based on the obtained word-sense pair representations and relation representations, for addressing each of the specific types of questions. Experimental results have illustrated that this\nnovel framework can achieve better performance than existing methods for solving verbal comprehension questions and even exceed the average performance of human beings.\nWhile this work is a very early attempt to solve IQ Test using AI techniques, the evaluation results are highly encouraging and indicate that, with appropriately leveraging the deep learning technologies, we could be a further step closer to the true human intelligence. In the future, we plan to leverage more types of knowledge from the knowledge graph, such as Freebase9, to enhance the power of obtaining word-sense and relation embeddings. Moreover, we will explore new frameworks based on deep learning or other AI techniques to solve other parts of IQ tests beyond verbal comprehension questions."

    "abstractText" : "Intelligence Quotient (IQ) Test is a set of standardized questions designed to evaluate human intelligence. Verbal comprehension questions appear very frequently in IQ tests, which measure human’s verbal ability including the understanding of the words with multiple senses, the synonyms and antonyms, and the analogies among words. In this work, we explore whether such tests can be solved automatically by artificial intelligence technologies, especially the deep learning technologies that are recently developed and successfully applied in a number of fields. However, we found that the task was quite challenging, and simply applying existing technologies (e.g., word embedding) could not achieve a good performance, mainly due to the multiple senses of words and the complex relations among words. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework consisting of three components. First, we build a classifier to recognize the specific type of a verbal question (e.g., analogy, classification, synonym, or antonym). Second, we obtain distributed representations of words and relations by leveraging a novel word embedding method that considers the multi-sense nature of words and the relational knowledge among words (or their senses) contained in dictionaries. Third, for each specific type of questions, we propose a simple yet effective solver based on the obtained distributed word representations and relation representations. According to our experimental results, our proposed framework can not only outperform existing methods for solving verbal comprehension questions but also exceed the average performance of human beings. The results are highly encouraging, indicating that with appropriate uses of the deep learning technologies, we could be a further step closer to the true human intelligence.
