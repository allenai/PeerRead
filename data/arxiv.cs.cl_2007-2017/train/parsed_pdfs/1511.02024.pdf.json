      "text" : "Distributional semantic models [12], also called count models [1] have been popular in the computational linguistics literature for several decades. In the last few years, however, predict models such as the Skip-Gram model and Continuous Bag-Of-Words model have become the de facto standard for word modeling [5, 6]. These methods have origins in neural language modeling [7], where the goal was to improve classic language models. A recent evaluation study [1] suggested that the predict models are superior to the count models on a range of word similarity tasks. Newer work, however, attributes a large amount of the differences in performance between count and predict models to a lack of proper\n∗Cloud & Information Services Lab, Microsoft, Mountain View, CA 94043 †Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853 ‡Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin,\nAustin, TX 78712\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n02 02\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 6\nN ov\nhyperparameter optimization [4]. This has prompted the need for understanding the differences between the two types of models.\nTo this end, Levy and Goldberg [2] made an interesting connection between two key models: a traditional count model based on pointwise mutual information (PMI) and a predict model, namely the skip-gram model with negative sampling (SGNS). The key result is that the SGNS model is equivalent to a shifted version of the PMI method, where all values get shifted by a factor of log k. However, the proof assumes that the input and output dimensions are the same; hence the word vectors will still be of the size of the vocabulary. As we show in our analysis, this assumption has important implications for subsequent steps, such as dimensionality reduction methods like singular value decomposition (SVD).\nThe aim of this paper is to analyze connections between count and predict models in a more detailed fashion. In particular, we investigate the differences between SGNS and PMI methods more deeply. We make several observations that help this understanding. The first useful result is that the Shifted PMI model comes out as an explicit version of SGNS in which the context word vectors are fixed at their one-hot representations. We point out two differences between the Shifted PMI model and the SGNS model from an optimization perspective. First, SGNS usually works in lower dimensions, making it possible for all word vectors two interact. Second, as count models have usually more parameters, this might cause them to overfit on the data.\nWe use the insight from our analysis to propose several interesting extensions to classic word embedding models. For example, our analysis allows regularization to be added into PMI methods in a systematic way. We also propose a new convex word vector model based on CBOW which offers interpretability and a well-defined training objective.\nIn short, we draw connections between existing count and prediction models and augment them in several ways. However, in order to fully understand the factors that differentiate various methods, a comprehensive set of experiments is needed. We plan to carry out these experiments as part of future work."

Note that w and c are integers taking values from 1 to |V|.\nEach word and context word has a vectorial representation. We will use w ∈ Rm and c ∈ Rn to denote the word vector and context vector corresponding to word w and context word c. For vector x, xi will denote the i-th component of x.

      "text" : "An important design choice in count models is the definition of context. The definition of context determines which co-occurrences get considered when creating a model, along with the importance of single co-occurrences. A common way of defining context is based on choosing a window around each occurrence of a word w in D. There are many options to customize this window; for example, it can either be symmetric or asymmetric around w. There could also exist weights (e.g., dependent on the relative positions of w and c) associated with each (w, c) occurrence in D. One may also include down-weighting of common words, possibly for both for the current word w as well as for the context words c1. All these choices determine the value of #(w, c). Note that since the weightings can be real, #(w, c), #(w, ·) and #(·, c) can take non-negative real values in general.\nIf the window is symmetric around w and as well as the weighting functions are symmetric, then\n1. #(w, c) is symmetric, i.e., #(w, c) = #(c, w) and\n2. #(w, ·) = #(·, c) if w and c denote the same word\nWe will refer to this as the symmetry condition. In Section 3.2.1 we will revisit this condition and see that it helps our understanding of non-uniqueness and interchangeability of word vectors and context word vectors.\nExample. Consider an asymmetric window K that includes l words to the left and r words to the right of a word w. In other words,\nK = (−l, · · · ,−1, 1, . . . , r).\nTake one (word, context word) pair (wt, wt+i), where i ∈ K. Let P (wt) be the probability with which word wt is chosen for inclusion into the training set. For example, Mikolov et al [6] suggest the following down-sampling probability:\nP1(w t) = 1−\n√ τ\nf(wt) (1)\nwhere f(wt) is the frequency of word wt in the corpus D, and τ is a threshold. Let P2(w\nt+i) be the weight associated with wt+i as context word. Here again we may want to down-sample frequent words similar to (1). Let P3(i) be the weight associated with the position of the context word wt+i in the context\n1Mikolov et al [6] used down-weighting of common words. It is unclear if Levy and Goldberg [2] used it.\nwindow. Using all these individual weights we can define the overall weight for the (wt, wt+i) pair:\nP (wt, wt+i) = P1(w t)P2(w t+i)P3(i) (2)\nAccumulating all this info over the entire corpus gives us the total value for (word, context word) pairs:\n#(w, c) = ∑\n{(t,i):wt=w,wt+i=c}\nP (wt, wt+i) (3)\nNow #(w, ·) and #(·, c) can be formed using #(w, c) as described in the beginning of this section."

As the name implies, the key quantity in these models is Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI). Its definition and MLE estimate from data are given by\nPMI(w, c) = log P (w, c) P (w)P (c) ≈ log #(w, c) · |D| #(w, ·) ·#(·, c) , (4)\nwhere #(w, c) is the simple count function. For a given word w, PMI represents w by forming a vector whose components are PMI(w, c) for all c ∈ V .\nNote that PMI is not defined when #(w, c) = 0. To circumvent this problem, Positive PMI (PPMI) replaces all negative values, i.e.,\nPPMI(w, c) = max(PMI(w, c), 0).\nMore recently, Levy and Goldberg [2] have defined shifted variants of PMI and the PPMI metrics. Shifted PMI (SPMI) is just defined as PMI(w, c)− log k, and Shifted Positive PMI (SPPMI) is defined as max(SPMI(w, c), 0) where k is some positive integer. PMI and PPMI are, respectively, special cases of Shifted PMI and Shifted PPMI, with k set to 1. We will return to Shifted PMI and Shifted PPMI in the next section, where we talk about the equivalence of certain methods.\nAs all vectors produced by PMI have the vocabulary size as the dimensionality, dimensionality reduction techniques are often applied to the original matrix to decrease the memory and computational requirements."

      "text" : "SGNS [6] is a popular predict model that aims to predict which word w occurs with a context word c. One can derive the SGNS [6] model from a binary classification setting where the target variable y specifies whether a word w occurs with context word c. SGNS tries to solve this task with the logistic loss applied to the input score x = w · c.\nRemember that our corpus D is a sequence of words, D = {wt}|D|t=1. To make notation easier, here we assume that the context is defined by all the words within a window Ct around each word wt. Let the corresponding sequence of sets of context words be {Ct}Tt=1. To construct the training set for the SGNS model, one forms one training example for each t and each context word ct ∈ Ct. For each ct ∈ Ct, a set of k negative context words, N tct is chosen at random and, the logistic loss function f(wt, ct;N tct) is applied. This loss is the aggregation of losses for one positive example and k negative examples. More formally, the loss of one training example `(wt, Ct) is:\n`(wt, Ct) = ∑\nct∈Ct f(wt, ct;N tct) def = L(wt · ct, 1) + ∑ c∈N t\nct\nL(wt · c,−1), (5)\nwhere L(w ·c, y) is the logistic loss corresponding to the word-context pair (w, c) and target y ∈ {1,−1}. The loss over the entire corpus is then the sum of all individual losses:\n`(W,C) = |D|∑ t=1 `(wt, Ct). (6)\nLet us refer to this way of writing the training objective (sum over occurrences in the corpus) as the corpus format.\nLevy and Goldberg [2] showed that, by accumulating data over co-occurrences of words and context words, the objective function in (6) can be rewritten as2:\n`(W,C) = ∑ w∈V ∑ c∈V `w,c(w, c) (7)\n`w,c(w, c) = #(w, c)L(w · c, 1) + k · #(w, ·) ·#(·, c)\n|D| L(w · c,−1) (8)\nLet us refer to this (equivalent) way of writing the training objective as the cooccurrence format. Note that in the co-occurrence format, we do not compute losses for each token individually, but instead compute a loss for each unique (w, c) pair.\nIn (8) we will from now on also consider other loss functions L(x, y) apart from the logistic loss like in the original formulation. We consider general loss functions, L(x, y) (here y ∈ {1,−1} is the target variable) with the logistic loss\n2Levy and Goldberg [2] write the problem as the maximization of likelihood; hence the ` here and the one in [2] are negatives of each other.\nbeing a special case. This generalization allows us to define custom loss functions that can incorporate domain knowledge or other side information. Table 1 lists a set of popular loss functions.\nObservation 1 Unlike SGNS, not all models can be reduced to the co-occurrence format - an example is the CBOW model [5]. In fact, even with the skip-gram model, the reduction to the co-occurrence format is not possible if we use the traditional softmax or hierarchical softmax [7] approach to speed up training. In general, models reducible to the co-occurrence format have to only be based on counts of words, context words and their co-occurrences. That property makes them have close relations with count models [1, 2, 10]. Another model that can be expressed in co-occurrence form is Glove [9]."

Then (C∗, W∗) is also a minimizer of `; in other words, at optimality, if the word vectors and context word vectors are completely swapped, optimality still holds. Thus, depending on how the numerical optimization of (7) initialized, W∗ and C∗ can end up being completely swapped.\nSimilar swap properties can be given for other models in the co-occurrence format, e.g., Glove [9].\nObservation 3 Note that Observation 2 does not mean that W = C. If ` had been a convex function, then, using the fact that any convex combination of optimal solutions is also optimal, one can show the existence of an optimal solution with W = C. However, the objective function ` in (7) is far from convex. Such non-convex objectives are usually associated with optima in which the symmetric components take very different values. In general, even when the symmetry condition does not hold, this discussion indicates that SGNS can end up at different optima depending on the initialization of the optimization process.\nObservation 4 Mikolov et al. [6] derive (7) starting from the problem of predicting a context word given a word. However, when using negative sampling, the symmetry condition implies that we get exactly the same formulation and solution as for a model where we would predict a word given a context word. It is useful to note that this comment does not hold if traditional softmax or hierarchical softmax [7] or noise-contrastive estimation [8] is used to model probabilities with the associated negative likelihood loss."

As Levy and Goldberg showed, it turns out that the closed-form solution of the SGNS objective is equivalent to a solution constructed by the Shifted PMI model. In contrast to Levy and Goldberg, we apply approximate quadratic analysis to the SGNS objective to give a more detailed insight for a broad class of loss functions.\nThe central idea of the analysis is to assume that, given a sufficient number of dimensions, each score x = w · c can be minimized independently of all other scores. Let us define\nρw,c(x) = `w,c(w, c) = ρw,c(w · c).

Consider the expressions for x∗w,c in Table 2 to verify this. This issue does not arise for SGNS because it operates with reduced dimensional embeddings of words and context words in which information associated with various (word, context word) pairs interact heavily. We believe that this is a crucial difference between SGNS and PMI methods.\nObservation 6 For building semantic representations that are used for computing similarity, it is often not desirable to have negative components in the word vectors. PosCondition in the last column of Table 2 checks when this case occurs. This condition turns out to be the same for all losses, which is interesting. There is no difference between squared loss, squared hinge loss and Huber loss. This is because, in the interval x ∈ [−1, 1], all these losses have identical ρw,c(·) and the minimizer of ρw,c always occurs in [−1, 1]. These three losses have an expression for x∗w,c that is quite different from that for the logistic loss. Hinge loss prefers to set x∗w,c at the extremes: 1 or −1."

This is interesting since they all consider the same input data – namely the co-occurrences of words in text. What are the reasons for this? Although the previous section pointed out a strong connection between SGNS and PMI methods (with Observation 7 even indicating a near equivalence), we believe there are two main differences between the two methods pertaining (a) the dimension of the embeddings, and (b) C being fixed as the one-hot representation. Let us now expand on the two factors.\nObservation 8 Dimension of embeddings. As already mentioned in Observation 5, the small embedding dimension used by SGNS for words can be crucial for learning good word vectors. For example, co-occurring words can influence each other. The full dimension used by PMI methods does not allow this to happen; the full dimension also has the disadvantage of suffering from overfitting due to an excessive number of variables.\nObservation 9 One-hot representation for C. Similar to the previous observation, there is a difference in which variables are optimized. SGNS operates with both, W and C as variables. As shown in Subsection 4.2, PMI methods, on the other hand, correspond to using a fixed one-hot representation for C. An important consequence of such a representation is that it does not allow close context words to influence each other. Future work should empirically investigate the role of this factor."

This is equivalent to a modified SGNS method in which during negative sampling examples not satisfying the PosCondition, i.e., those with PMI− log k < 0 are left out.\nThere is two issues with the above approach. First, we no longer can guarantee optimality for this solution. Second, this also seems inconsistent with the main idea behind negative sampling, which is to sample from unobserved (w, c) pairs. Levy and Goldberg [2] make the following statement in the second paragraph of Section 5.1 of their paper: “We observe that Shifted PPMI is indeed a near-perfect approximation of the optimal solution, even though it discards a lot of information when considering only positive cells.” However, this does not explain the role of the discarded terms.

      "text" : "Motivated by the analysis in Section 4.1, we develop a new and simple convex formulation for determining word vectors. Similar to the skip-gram model, we phrase our model as the task of predicting a word conditioned on context. However, instead of learning representations for both words and their context words, we fix the context vectors to a one-hot representation. This makes our objective function convex. Another advantage is that this results in intelligible models – each vector entry refers to a weight given to a context word. Also, to obtain compact representations, we instead use L1 regularization on the word vectors instead of learning embeddings in lower-dimensional spaces like traditional predict models.\nLet us describe the formulation in some more detail. Let m denote the dimension of the vector representation of context. Depending on the context modeling employed, m can be one to several times of |V|. Let z ∈ Rm denote the context representation. z is a function of the context, C, written as z(C). The weight vectors {w} are also points in Rm. The score of a positive example is w ·z(C). Remember that the input corpus D is a sequence of words, {wt}Tt=1. Let the corresponding sequence of contexts be {Ct}Tt=1. We solve the following minimization problem.\nmin W |V|∑ w=1 λ‖w‖1 + 1 T T∑ t=1 f(wt; z(Ct)) (24)\nIn the above, λ > 0 is a regularization constant4 which can be tuned to balance sparsity of W and performance; f includes the effect of positive as well as negative examples. Other forms of regularization are also possible, for example a combination of L1 and L2 regularization (Generalized Elastic net).\nContext. We can define context in several ways. Here are a few possibilities:\n1. A simple way is to have a context z ∈ R|V|, with each dimension corresponding to one word in the vocabulary V . Similar to the SGNS model, we only assume individual interactions between words and context pairs, i.e., each z will exactly contain one non-zero entry. This way, we can rewrite the objective in the co-occurrence form and obtain all vectors in closed form by accumulating the statistics for each (word, context word) pair.\n2. We can do better than option 1 above and pair a word with a window of context words simultaneously, i.e., z can now have multiple non-zero entries. A bag-of-words representation z ∈ R|V| can be used to represent the context input using the context words. For example, we can set zc = ρ(c, w) if c occurs in the context window and zero otherwise, where ρ(c, w) is some weighting that is a function of how far c is from w.\n3. If we want to make use of word order, we can define L×|V| context inputs where L is the length of the context window and one block of |V| inputs is used for each context word, and blocks concatenated in the proper order of occurrence in the window.\n4. Depending on the purpose for which the word vectors are developed we can also use dependency-tree based context features [3]. Again, we can use one-hot representations of these features.\nLearning. Except option 1, aggregating at the individual (w, c) level (to convert the objective into the co-occurrence form (7)) as well as forming a closed form solution, is in general infeasible. This means we have to train our model\n4One can also think of schemes for making λ dependent on w, for example, make λw dependent on the number of context words to which word w is attached.\nusing the objective in corpus format. To do the training, we can choose from various optimization strategies. We can employ: (a) proper softmax over all words; (b) hierarchical softmax [7]; (c) Noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) [8]; or, (d) negative sampling like in SGNS [5].\nWe now present examples for two of the four optimization strategies mentioned above. With softmax, our objective is\nf(wt; z(Ct)) = −wt · z(Ct) + log (∑ w w · z(Ct) ) . (25)\nLet us now consider optimization via Negative Sampling. Let {wjneg}kj=1 denote a randomly sampled set of negative examples. Then\nf(wt; z(Ct)) = − log σ(wt · z(Ct))− k∑\nj=1\nlog σ(−wjneg · z(Ct)), (26)\nwhere σ(x) = 1/(1 + e−x).\nObservation 12 One of the advantages of the convex formulation described above is interpretability. If the rth component of some w is large and positive, it can be directly translated to the role played by the rth context term of z(C). This direct interpretability also means that domain knowledge may be easy to infuse into the formulation by specification of constraints and extra regularization on the weights.\nObservation 13 The model developed in this section is in between conventional low-dimensional word embeddings (no interpretability, allows for higherorder effects) and distributional word representations (full interpretability, no higher-order effects). Here, the term “higher-order effects” refers to the effects (influences) that occur during the joint optimization of context and word representations, e.g, two words can be made similar because they occur in contexts that are also similar."

      "text" : "In this report, we showed how to explicitly solve the SGNS objective for a broad range of loss functions. This step allowed us to connect Shifted PMI models to SGNS models under general loss functions. Furthermore, we pointed out two important differences between the Shifted PMI model and SGNS model. First, in the SGNS model, far fewer embeddings are used in practice, making the SGNS model less prone to overfitting. Second, in the PMI model, the context vectors are fixed; hence, there is also no interaction between context vectors and word vectors.\nFinally, we proposed two extensions to existing models. First, we showed how we can incorporate regularization into PMI models to alleviate overfitting.\nSecond, we presented a new embedding model that not only has a convex objective, but also results in intelligible embeddings. Future work is needed to empirically validate our proposed methods and extensions."
