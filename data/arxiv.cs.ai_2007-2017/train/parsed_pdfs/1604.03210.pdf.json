Fuzzy Logic\n1.1.1. Concept of fuzzy logic\nFuzzy logic has its real significance in several aspect such as fuzzy language, fuzzy control theory, information processing, computer science, medical diagnosis and so on.\nThis fuzzy logic has been developed since making the classical binary logic vague. For a long time, mathematical logic has been existed as a pure theory, but in the late of 1930’s the practical value appeared obviously. First, it was used in design of switch circuit and then became the important basis of computer science and automatic control theory as computer developed. However, because a preposition in binary logic has only 2 values: true and false, it is inconvenient for emulation of the human thinking.\nObjective things are not absolutes only with true and false, and there is much transitional state between true and false and this shows vagueness. Because human being have intelligence processing the objects with vagueness smoothly, so they can think generally and parallel and then they have ability applying the summarization, abstraction, intuition and thinking creatively. Therefore the task to search the formulation problem of natural language was suggested and under this premise fuzzy logic also has been developed.\nFuzzy logic is the branch that generalized the use of connection operation in mathematical logic and selection of value in truth table, and its development shows its powerful vitality by combined with the computer science. In computer manufacturing, mainly 《minimization of logic operation》 is studied and in\nprogram, mainly study on approximation reasoning is used in artificial intelligence.\nThe characteristics of fuzzy logic are as follows: ① Truth value is vague, that is a proposition may have any value between\nrange [0, 1].\n② Truth value can be generated by given grammar. ③ Using truth value can have meaning according to the grammatical rule. ④ It has meaning that the truth value can be changed as local logic. ⑤ Reasoning rule is natural, not certain. Here, ② and ③ are the problems related with fuzzy language, and ①， ④ and ⑤ are the one related with fuzzy logic, so we have to understand the meaning considering the contents described in fuzzy logic.\n1.1.2. Fuzzy Proposition\nIn binary logic, each proposition has only two values: true 《1》 and false 《0》. A proposition is expressed with the symbol and formulas having the standing rules, so study on formulation of logic proposition has became to convert to the change of certain symbols and formulas.\nFuzzy proposition is a kind of symbolic logic and can be said the generalization of general proposition. In fuzzy logic, the value which a fuzzy proposition has doesn’t express the 《true》 and 《false》, but expresses the degree of them. Therefore, the truth value can be all the real number ranging in interval [0, 1]. And fuzzy logic is widely used in controlling the complicated production process, using the switch theory, information process, approximation reasoning, and fuzzy\nlanguage.\n[Definition 1.1.1] Fuzzy proposition is the sentence having the vagueness. In\nother words, proposition is defined as the proposition which truth value is in [0, 1].\nIn general, proposition is expressed in the form of 《x is A》, where x is called subject, and A is called predicate. The difference between the fuzzy proposition and general proposition is that the its predicate is expressed in the form of fuzzy set.\nFuzzy proposition is denoted as symbols . ,,, ~~~ RQP\n(Example 1.1.1)\n： 《x is a small positive number》 ~ P\n~ Q ： 《Miss. Pak is very strong.》\n~R ： 《It is very hot today》\nIn the above example, 《is a small positive number》, 《is very strong》 and 《is very hot》 are all the fuzzy concepts and they are expressed as fuzzy set. Therefore fuzzy proposition is corresponded to the fuzzy set.\nArithmetic of truth value of fuzzy proposition is the one of the membership\nfunction.\nFuzzy union , fuzzy intersection   and complement  are defined as\n(1.1.1), (1.1.2) and (1.1.3).\n),max( ~~~~ QPQP  (1.1.1)\n),min( ~~~~ QPQP  (1.1.2)\n.1 ~~ PP  (1.1.3)\nThen we can obtain the following result for the logic operations . ,,  \nHere, we refer to the fuzzy proposition having value in [0, 1], and\ndenote to ·,\nP Q R~ ~ ~, ,\n  to －.\n① Commutativity\n~~~~~~~~ , PQQPPQQP  (1.1.4)\n② Idempotency\n~~~~~~ , PPPPPP  (1.1.5)\n③ Involution\n~~ PP  (1.1.6)\n④ Associativity\n~~~~~~ )()( RQPRQP  (1.1.7)\n~~~~~~ )()( RQPRQP  (1.1.8)\n⑤ Absorption\n~~~~~~~~ )( ,)( PQPPPQPP  (1.1.9)\n⑥ Distributivity\n~~~~~~~ )( RPQPRQP  (1.1.10)\n).()()( ~~~~~~~ RPQPRQP  (1.1.11)\n⑦ De Morgan’s law\n~~~~~~~~ )( ,)( QPQPQPQP  (1.1.12)\n⑧ Zero element\n00 ,0 ~~~  PPP (1.1.13)\n⑨ Identity\n~~~ 1 ,11 PPP  (1.1.14)\n⑩ Complementary law\n0 ,1 ~~~~  PPPP (1.1.15)\nIn some cases, we may denote the complementary law as\n2 1 , 2 1 ~~~~  PPPP (1.1.16)\nFrom the above equations, the following equations are held.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~ )( QPPQPPQQPPPP  (1.1.17)\n)()()( ~~~~~~~~~~~~ QPPQPPQQPPPP  (1.1.18)\nIf the truth value of fuzzy proposition on each point of object set X is not\nless than\n~ P\n , that is\n~P (1.1.19)\nthen fuzzy proposition is defined as ~P  always true proposition where\n]1,0[ .\nEspecially when 1 , it becomes the always true proposition.\n1.1.3. Basic knowledge of fuzzy reasoning.\nIn binary logic, reasoning sentence 《If ~ then ~》 is the conditional proposition\nand is denoted as symbol 《 》. P Q\nThe truth value is as follows.\nP 1 1 0 0\nQ\nP Q\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\nBecause the truth value table of proposition 《 》 and the 《 》 are\nthe same, (1.1.20) is held.\nP Q  P Q\nQP  QP (1.1.20)\nWhen and are fuzzy proposition, is called approximation\nreasoning sentence (fuzzy reasoning sentence).\n~P Q~ P Q~ ~\nFor example, if\nP~ : 《It is clear.》\nQ ~ : 《It is warm．》\n, then 《 》 means 《If it is clear, it is warm》, and 《Q 》 means 《If\nit is warm, it is clear.》\nP Q~ ~~ P~ ~~\nP Q   P Q\nGeneralizing the P Q   P Q as the fuzzy proposition,\nP Q~ ~   P Q~ ~\nTherefore, when proposition 《x change the litmus paper into red color》 is\nexpressed using the set by using a syllogistic; we should consider the objective space to two factors: one is 《chemical property》 and the other is 《color》.\nNow, consider the approximation reasoning (fuzzy reasoning) related with two\nobject space X Y,\n~~ QP  (1.1.21)\nTo simplify, first consider the general proposition . We can consider\nrelation on\nP Q\nP Q X Y . The characteristic function is\n))(1())()((),)(( xPyQxPyxQP  (1.1.22)\nwhere YyXx  , , and and have only 0 or 1. )(xP )(yQ\nGeneralizing this equation in the form of fuzzy reasoning is the fuzzy\nrelation on\n~~ QP \nX Y and its membership function is expressed as (1.1.22).\n))(1())()((),)(( ~~~~~ xPyQxPyxQP  (1.1.22)\nwhere\n]1,0[)(),( ~~ yQxP .\n(Example 1.1.2) Two fuzzy propositions\n《 is small.》 and 《 is large.》 xP ~ : yQ : ~\n~~ QP  means 《If x is small, then y is large》.\nRefer the object space to }5 ,4 ,3 ,2 ,1{ YX , and 《small》 and 《large》\nare the fuzzy sets on two object space.

And complement term with\nall the variables is called complement minimum term.\nFor example, term 3221 xxxx  on is complement minimum term, but V3\n221 xxx  is not complement minimum term.\nGiven two fuzzy logic expressions and , when the following (1.2.2) is held for any element a, we can describe that contains , and equation (1.2.3) is\nheld.\n1F 2F\n1F F2\n)()( 21 aFaF  (1.2.2) 21 FF  (1.2.3)\nEspecially, in (1.2.2), when  and  are terms, Iff every character in  is in ,  contains  . Therefore, when  contains  ,   and  can\nbe omitted.\nFor example,\n32121321 xxxxxxxx \nFor any fuzzy logic function F, the formula obtained by expanding all complement terms as the sum of complement minimum terms is called fuzzy main addition normal form of F.\nFor example, fuzzy logic function on 3V\n32122121 xxxxxxxxF \n, 221 xxx  are complement terms. This can be expanded as the sum of the complement minimum terms as\n3221322133221221 )( xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \nTherefore,\n321213213221322121 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxF \nThis is fuzzy main addition normal form of F. Refer F to fuzzy logic function, and  to term, and when the (1.2.4) is held\nfor each element a of , term nV  is called fuzzy closure of F. Especially, when  omitted any character is not fuzzy closure of F,  is called fuzzy item. This is denoted as FPI.\n)() aFa(  (1.2.4)\nThe form with the least characters among the addition normal form of fuzzy\nlogic functions is called fuzzy simplest form.\nHere, the following property is held. When F is the fuzzy main addition normal form, all single items in F are the FPI of\nF.\nBy using the above property, given the fuzzy addition normal form , we can\nfind FPI of single item . That is, if single item\nF\nF  in isn’t contained in\nother single item, it has already been FPI of . So, it is the problem to find the FPI of complement item. For this, we introduce the fuzzy consistency.\nF\nF\nRefer  , to item respectively, fuzzy consistency set of  and \n),(  is defined as follows. FC\nGiven a certain variable , when xi )(),( 0000     iii xxx ix or\n)),( 000 (0      iii xxx ix\n1° If 00   is complement item, then ),(00  FC\n2° If 00   is simple term, then )(),,(00 ijFCxx ij     \n3° ),( FC consists of only complement items of 1° and 2°.\nAnd the same character is replicated as fuzzy consistency, replicated characters\nshould be omitted.\nFor instance, refer  , to the items on . 3V ① If 2121 , xxxx   , then },{),( 2211 xxxxFC  ② If 2121 , xxxx   , then },{),( 33111 xxxxxFC  ③ If 11, xx   , then },{),( 3322 xxxxFC  Then, the following properties are held. If fuzzy addition normal form nF   21 consists of sum of all FPI\nof F,\n1° Item contained in the other item doesn’t exist. 2° Either fuzzy consistency of any two items doesn’t exist, or it is contained in\nother item ),1( nii  .\nFrom the above property, refer F to any fuzzy logic function, we can obtain\ncomputing algorithm obtaining all FPI of F.\nComputing algorithm 1° Expand F as the fuzzy addition normal form.． 2° Omit all items contained other item. 3° Obtain the fuzzy consistency for any two items. In case whether fuzzy consistency doesn’t exist or is contained in other item, add the obtained fuzzy consistency and go to 2° .\n4° The obtained formula is the sum of all FPI． (Example 1.2.2) Calculate FPI of fuzzy logic function on 4V\n4321142113211 xxxxxxxxxxxxxF  .\nFirst, for step 1°, F is the fuzzy addition normal form. For step 2°, an item\ncontained in the other term doesn’t exist.\nNext, refer\n432113\n42112\n32111 xxxxx xxxx xxxx      \nand obtain the fuzzy consistency according to the step 3°, then\n}{),( }{),(\n),(\n321131\n421131\n21\nxxxxFC xxxxFC\nFC\n \n\n \n\nBecause these fuzzy consistencies are not contained in other item, the following\nequation is held, adding them to F.\n32114211\n4321142113211 xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxF  \nRepeating the same step for F, x x x1 1 2  are obtained as FPI. As we can see on the above consideration, one fuzzy logic function is expressed as FPI to decrease the number of characters. That is, fuzzy simplest form is expressed as the sum of FPI.\nThere are two cases in FPI of fuzzy logic function F, one is in simplest form of F, and the other is not in any simplest form. Some properties related with this are described as follows.\nIf FPI  is in all simplest form of fuzzy logic function F,  is called\nindispensable item and the other is called dispensable item.\nFrom this definition, the following 2 properties are held. 1° If a certain single item  is FPI of fuzzy logic function F,  is\nindispensable item of F.\n2° If  is fuzzy consistency of  and  when single items  ,  and complement item  are FPI of fuzzy logic function F, then  is dispensable\nitem of F.\nFrom the above properties, we can realize that it is not necessary to obtain the fuzzy consistency of single items to obtain the simplest form of fuzzy logic function.\nComputing algorithm 1° Obtain all FPIs obtained by calculating the fuzzy consistency of items which\nat least one is complement item, and refer them to n ,,, 21  .\n2° Calculate the fuzzy main addition normal form. Refer the single item to m ,,, 21  , and find the minimum combination containing the complement minimum items l ,,, 21  in n ,,, 21  , and then refer it s  ,,, 21  .\n3° smF    2121 is the simplest form of F.

For example, word such as dog, horse, white, beautiful and so on are all original words.\nCompound words can be made from words, and it was composed by applying the logic operations 《》, 《 and 《 》 to the language in the view of mathematical logic. And operations 《》, 《 and 《 》 are corresponding to 《 》, 《 》 and 《  》 in set theory. So it is possible to make the compound word with words and decompose the compound word into words. Compound words can be expressed in the way of bracketing the words as follows.\nWhite horse＝[horse] [white]， \nEast north＝[east] [north]，\nbrothers＝[elder brother] [younger brother]， \ndesk and chair＝[desk] [chair]， \nnonmetal＝[metal]\nHedge of language can be done by introducing the concept of operator on the basis of set theoretical expression of language. For example, we can consider 《extremely》, 《very》, 《comparatively》, 《quite》, 《more or less》, 《almost》,\n《probably》 and so on as operators.\n1.3.2. Language variable\nLanguage variable is the generalized concept of fuzzy variable. Fuzzy variable is characterized as the three dimensional pair , where X is the name of variable，U is the set of objects, and is the restriction. Restriction\nis the fuzzy set in U determined by fuzzy variable X. If is general\nset, then it becomes the variable that has been used in mathematics. Like this, fuzzy variable is the generalization of variable.\n( , , ( : ))X U R X u\nR X u( : )\nR X u( : ) R X u( : )\nLanguage variable is denoted as , where restriction is the whole\nof various fuzzy subsets in object set.\n( , , ( : ))X U R X u\nFor example, consider the adjective 《pretty》. This is the word that indicates the external characteristics of a certain object. This is considered as an expression of fuzzy set restricting the fuzzy variable named 《pretty》. Applying rhetoric such as 《very》, 《not》, 《extremely》, 《quite》 and so on to the fuzzy set 《pretty》, new fuzzy sets such as 《very pretty》, 《extremely pretty》, 《not pretty》 and 《quite pretty》. Such fuzzy sets are the values of language variables such as fuzzy\nset 《pretty》.\nA main characteristic of language variable is that language variable selects the\nfuzzy variable as its value.\nFor example, language variable 《age》, expressing the age, can have the following values. 《young》, 《not young》, 《old》, 《very old》, 《not young and not old》 and 《quite old》. Here 《young》 is the name of fuzzy variable\nreflecting the meaning 《young》, and 《old》 is meaning 《old》.\nReferring X to the name of fuzzy variable, restriction decided by X is the\nmeaning of X.\nFor example, restriction decided by fuzzy variable 《old》 is the fuzzy set\ndefined in like (1.3.1). U  [ , ]0 100\nR u u u U( ) ,old      \n \n   \n \n 1 505 2 50\n100 1\n(1.3.1)\nFuzzy set expressed by can be considered that it has the meaning\n《old》.\nR(old)\nThe other characteristic of language variable is that it is combined according to\nthe following two rules.\nS① yntactic rule: this means the algorithm for generating the name of value of\nvariable.\nS② emantic rule: this is the rule to decide the algorithm for calculating the\nmeaning of each value.\nThese rules are the essential parts reflecting the characteristics of structural\nvariable.\nLanguage variable is characterized as 5 dimensional pair as follows.\n),,),(,( MGUNTN (1.3.2)\nIn (1.3.2), N is the name of variable, and is the noun set of N, that is,\nthe syntactic rule for generating the value name X of N.\n)(NT\nM is the semantic rule for expressing the meaning of X as the fuzzy set in U.\nEspecially, X that is the name generated by grammar G is called noun. Noun that has a function, composed with one or more words is called basic\nnoun, and noun consisted of one or more basic words is called compound noun.\nReferring to the nouns of T, T is denoted as follows. X X1 2, , \nT X X  1 2 \nWhere T may be expressed as when it is necessary that T was generated by grammar G. The meaning of noun X is defined as (1.3.3) so as to be the restriction decided by fuzzy variable X. T G( ) M X( ) R X( )\n)(xM  )(XR (1.3.3)\nThis means that is the fuzzy set representing the meaning of X. R X( )\n(Example 1.3.1) Consider the language variable 《Age》.\nLanguage value of 《Age》 may be 《old》 and 《old》 is the basic noun. And it has the other value 《very old》, which is compound noun. Besides this, there are many elements of noun set of 《Age》.\nT(Age)=old + very old + not old + more or less young + quite young + not\nvery old and not very young+ …\nwhere each noun is the name of fuzzy variable in U  [ , ]0 100 . Then the meaning of\n《old》 is given as (1.3.4).\nuuM 1100\n50\n2\n5 501)old(\n\n   \n\n           (1.3.4)\nOr simply,\nuu 1100\n50\n2\n5 501old\n\n   \n\n           (1.3.5)\nSimilarly, the meaning of language value of 《very old》 can be described as\nfollows.\nuuM 2100\n50\n2\n5 501oldveryold)(very\n\n   \n\n           (1.3.6)\n(Example 1.3.2) Consider the language variable 《Number》. Language\nvariable is as follows.\nmanyseveralfew(Number) T\n1021  U\nwhere 《few》 , 《several》 and 《many》 are fuzzy variables defined in . 1021  U\n0.4/41/30.8/20.4/1few \nseveral 0.5/8,+.8/706/11/50.8/40.5/3= \nmany /1019/9.00.8/80.6/70.4/6= \nThat language variable 《Number》 has 《few》 as its value is denoted as\nfollows.\nfewNumber \nNext, consider the structural language variable. When given language variable N, its noun set and M is characterized\nalgorithmically, the language variable N is called structural language variable.\n)(NT\nIn this sense, syntactic rule combined with the structural language variable can\nbe considered as the algorithm for calculating the meaning of each noun in . )(NT\n(Example 1.3.3) Consider the role of syntactic and semantic rules of structural\nlanguage variable using the language variable 《Age》.\nNouns of 《Age》 are 《old》, 《very old》, 《very very old》. Therefore,\nnoun set of 《Age》 can be denoted as follows.\nT(Age)=old + very old + very very old + …\nIt is certain that in the simple case, each noun of is one of 《old》 or\n《very old》.\n(Age)T\nInduct this rule in general way. Denote the connection of x and y as yx  . If old,very  yx , then\n. oldveryxy\nIf are the sets of rows, that is A B,\n\n  \n21\n21 yyB xxA\n, then connection of A and B is denoted as AB, and is defined as the following set.\n ij ji yxyyxxAB ))(( 2121 \nFor example, if oldveryold,very  BA , then\noldveryveryoldveryold)veryvery(old AB\nUsing such expression method, we can make the solution of the\nfollowing equation.\n(Age)T\nT=old + very T (1.3.7)\n(1.3.7) can be solved using the following recursion equation.\n,2,1,0,veryold1  iTT ii (1.3.8)\nSetting the initial value of Ti to empty set 0,\n\noldveryvery+oldvery+old oldvery+old\nold 0\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n\n\n T T T T\n(1.3.9)\nAs result, solution of equation is as follows.\n  oldveryveryoldveryoldTT (1.3.10)\nIn this example, syntactic rule is expressed by (1.3.7) and its solution is\nobtained as follows.\nConsidering that (1.3.7) is algebraic expression, syntactic rule can be expressed\nas the following generation system.\noldT (1.3.11) oldveryT (1.3.12)\nIn this case, noun of T is obtained using the above generation rule. That is, if T\nis very T and, if T is old in very T, then noun very old is obtained.\noldvery veryvery veryvery veryveryveryvery  TTTT .\n(1.3.13)\nNext, consider the semantic rules for 《Age》. To compute the meaning of noun such as very … very old, first it is necessary to know the meaning old and very, where noun old is the initial value. That is, to compute the meaning of compound noun in T, at least the meaning of old must be characterized as the initial data.\nNoun very has the role of modification. Suppose that very has the rule of\nconcentration operator, the approximation of very is expressed as follows.\nvery old = CON(old) = old2 (1.3.14)\nAs result, semantic rule of Age is expressed as follows.\nM (very … very old)  old2n\nwhere n is the number of very in very … very old. If basic noun old is\nuu 1100 50 2 5 501old                  (1.3.15)\n, then\nM(very … very old) uu n2100\n50\n2\n5 501\n\n   \n\n           ， ,2,1n (1.3.16)\nThis equation offers the semantic rule for computing the meaning of compound\nnoun that basic noun old is generated by equation T=old + very T by modifier very.\nNext, consider the boolean language variable used very conveniently in\napplication.\nBoolean language variable is the following type of language variable. That is, X\nis the boolean expression of variables that has the type of ， or hX, where\nh is language modifier, is noun, and hX is the name of fuzzy set obtained by\napplying h to X.\npX phX\nXp\nnot very young and not very old\nFor example, in the above expression, h is very, is young and old.\nSimilarly, in very very young, h is very very, and is young.\nXp\nXp\n(Example 1.3.4) Refer Age to the boolean language variable having the\nfollowing noun set.\nT(Age)=young + not young +old +not old + very young + not young and not\nold + young or old + young or( very young and not very old ) + … Then, the meaning of typical value of Age can be described as follows.\nM (not young) = T(young), M (not very young) = T (young2), M (not very young and not very old) = T (young2) T (old 2), M (young or old) = T(young old) \nThese expressions show that the meaning of compound noun is expressed by\nthe meaning of basic nouns. So If young and old are as follows,\nyoung uuu  \n  \n\n          \n100\n25\n1225 0 5 251/1 (1.3.17)\nold uu \n  \n\n           100 50\n12\n5 501 (1.3.18)\nThen\nM(young or old)    \n\n           \n\nuuu 50\n25\n1225 0 5 251/1\nuuu 12100\n50\n12\n5 501 5 251\n\n  \n\n                           (1.3.19)\n1.3.3 Language Hedge\nWe explain the language hedge as the operator converting one fuzzy set such as\n《very》 to the other fuzzy set for example modifier named as much, more or\nless, rather.\nTo discuss the language hedge, we must consider the operations about fuzzy set, which is square operation, concentration, dilatation, contrast, standardization, fuzzification and so on. We describe these operations.\n[Definition 1.3.1] Referring fuzzy set in Y to A, and  to real number,\nsquare as the expansion of algebraic product for fuzzy set is defined as (1.3.20).\nA\n   )()( yyA AA  (1.3.20)\nAnd If  is positive number, scalar product A is defined as follows.\n)()( yyA AA   \n(Example 1.3.5) If 3/81.02/25.01/64.0 A , then are\ncalculates as follows.\nAAA 5.0,, 5.02\n3/41.02/125.01/32.05.0 ,3/9.02/5.01/8.0\n,3/66.02/06.01/41.0 5.0\n2\n \n A A A\n[Definition 1.3.2] Concentration CON(A) for fuzzy set A is defined as follows.\n2 CON )()( yy A  (1.3.21)\nThis means CON(A)  A2 .\n[Definition 1.3.3] Dilatation for fuzzy set A is denoted as DIL(A), and is\ndefined as follows.\n5.0)(DIL AA  (1.3.22)\nNamely,\n)()()( 5.0)(DIL yyy AAA   (1.3.23)\n[Definition 1.3.4] Contrast for fuzzy set A, and is defined as follows.\nINT(A) (1.3.24) \n  \n\n \n1)(5.0,)1(21\n5.0)(0,2 2\n2\nyA\nyA\nA\nA\n\n\nNamely,\n\n  \n\n \n1)(5.0,))(1(21\n5.0)(0,)(2 )(\n2\n2\n)INT( yy\nyy y\nAA\nAA A\n\n  (1.3.25)\nCON and INT satisfy the following property.\n)(CON)(CON)(CON BABA   (1.3.26) )(CON)(CON)(CON BABA   (1.3.27) )(CON)(CON)(CON BAAB  (1.3.28)\n)(INT)(INT)(INT BABA   (1.3.29) )(INT)(INT)(INT BABA   (1.3.30) )(INT)(INT)(INT BAAB  (1.3.31)\n(Example 1.3.6) If 5/2.04/4.03/6.02/8.01/1 A , then\n5/04.04/16.03/36.02/64.01/1)(CON A\n5/45.04/63.03/77.02/89.01/1)(DIL A 5/08.04/32.03/68.02/92.01/1)(INT A\nReferring the maximum membership of membership function A of fuzzy set\nA in Y,\n)(yAyA  \nIf A  1 , then A is standard fuzzy set.

Applying the fuzzy variable to this language hedge, we can get effectiveness of\nlanguage hedge.\n1.4 Fuzzy Language and Fuzzy Grammar\n1.4.1 Fuzzy language\nIn order that the computer simulates the human’s thinking better, natural language must be combined with the current formulated algorithm language. By inserting the natural language to the algorithm language, computer will be able to deal with the fuzzy concept and serve better for the human, comprehending the human intelligence. Such a computer language is called fuzzy algorithm language.\nTo make a computer understand and process the fuzzy concept, we must select\nthe object space first of all.\nIn general, we select the set of real number or its subset as the object space and\ndefine basic word such as 《small》, 《large》, 《long》, 《short》, 《heavy》 and 《light》 on the object space. And then by adding the fuzzy modification operators, we obtain 《very large》, 《quite light》, 《more or less small》 and so on, and adding fuzzy set operators 《》 and 《》, obtain 《neither large nor small》, 《larger or comparatively large》 and so on.\nProgramming these concepts, we can obtain value setting statements and\nprogram the fuzzy condition statements.\nSometimes, the result computed using the fuzzy algorithm language may be fuzzy, and in this case, it is possible to convert the fuzzy result to the definite one, by using the  level set.\nWe consider the fuzzy algorithm language FSTDS (Fuzzy Set Theory Data\nSystem).\nThere are 52 kinds of operation symbols in FSTDS and they can be divided into\n8 kinds.\nO① peration symbol configuring the set There are 《Set》 and 《Fset》.\n《Set》 configures the general set and 《Fset》 does fuzzy set.

Premise 2: This tomato is very red.\nConsequent: This tomato is well ripe. Like this, it is very interesting to formulize the method that can do fuzzy\nreasoning mechanically in the view of natural language processing.\nBut, such reasoning is difficult by using the classical reasoning rule of binary logic. Therefore, new reasoning rule, compositional rule of reasoning was formulated and on the basis on it, fuzzy reasoning (approximate reasoning) was introduced.\nFuzzy reasoning is the reasoning deriving a certain new fuzzy proposition from\nseveral fuzzy propositions, and it is similar to the reasoning of human, so it can be applied to various branches such as fuzzy control, expert system, decision making and so on.\nReasoning is done by using the logic phenomenon such as 《If P then Q》\n(this is called implication.) (P Q )\nFirst, consider the logic operation . P Q\nIn case of binary logic,\nP 1 1 0 0\nQ 1 0 1 0\nP Q\n1 0 1 1\nQP   QP\nwhere the truth value of is denoted as , then is P Q, |||,| QP | P Q |\n|or||||)|1(|| QPQPQP  (1.5.1)\nIn case of infinite value logic system,\n1|)|||1(||  QPQP (1.5.2)\nAt this time, using the boundary sum operation of fuzzy set  , the following\nequation becomes as follows.\n|||||| QPQP \nFrom the (1-1) and (1-2), we can know that that is true P Q\nmeans . |||| QP \nPBecause if rQ  || , then (1.5.2) is written as follows.\n1|)|||1(  QPr\nAnd if 1r , then\n|)|||1(1|)|||1(1 QPQP \n, and finally || Q|| P  is satisfied.\nIn the reasoning using , there are 《modus ponens》 and 《modus\ntollens》.\nP Q\nModus P① onens It is the method that reasons in case 《If P then Q》 is true, if P is true then Q is\nalso true.\nThis is expressed as (1.5.3).\nQ\nP QP\n\n\n\n3\n2 1 \n(1.5.3)\nIn this equation, is called conditional sentence, P of is condition of conditional sentence, Q is conclusion, P of is antecedent, and Q of 3゜ is consequent.

That is, adding a certain condition is for distinction between the other conditions, and furthermore besides them, results express the others.\nTherefore, accommodation 《If x is A, then y is B》 has no meaning by\ncombining the with the other condition.\nSo, consider the accommodation 《If x is A, then y is no》.\n《is no》 is expresses as the whole set V which element is y. then 《x is A y is\nB》 is analyzed as follows.\n《 x is is B 》 or 《 x is yA   A y is V 》 ＝ 《 is\n》\n),( yx\n( )A B ( A )V\nmR\n \nWe can understand that using as , fuzzy relation of the right of the\nabove equation is .\ncR BA \nIn fuzzy modus ponens, there are two kinds, direct method and indirect method,\nconsider only direct method.\nDirect method is the method reasoning the B directly from .
