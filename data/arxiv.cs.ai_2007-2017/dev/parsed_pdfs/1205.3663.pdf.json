      "text" : "Answer-set programming (ASP) is a popular framework to describe concisely search and combinatorial problems [14, 16]. It has been successfully applied in crypto-analysis, code optimization, the semantic web, and several other fields [18]. Problems are encoded by rules and constraints into disjunctive logic programs whose solutions are answer-sets (stable models). The complexity of finding an answer-set for a disjunctive logic program is ΣP2 -complete [4]. However this hardness result does not exclude quick solutions for large instances if we can exploit structural properties that might be present in real-world instances.\nRecently, Fichte and Szeider [5] have established a new approach to ASP based on the idea of backdoors, a concept that originates from the area of satisfiability [20]. Backdoors exploit the structure of instances by identifying sets of atoms that are important for reasoning. A backdoor of a disjunctive logic program is a set of variables such that any instantiation of the variables yields a simplified logic program that lies in a class of programs where the decision problem we are interested in is tractable. By means of a backdoor of size k for a disjunctive logic program we can solve the program by solving all the\n2k tractable programs that correspond to the truth assignments of the atoms in the backdoor. For each answer set of each of the 2k tractable programs we need to check whether it gives rise to an answer set of the given program. In order to do this efficiently we consider tractable programs that have a small number of answer sets (e.g., stratified programs [9]).\nWe consider target classes based on various notions of acyclicity on the directed/undirected dependency graph of the disjunctive logic program. A cycle is bad if it contains an edge that represents an atom from a negative body of a rule. Since larger target classes facilitate smaller backdoors, we are interested in large target classes that allow small backdoors and efficient algorithms for finding the backdoors.\nContribution\nIn this paper, we extend the backdoor approach of [5] using ideas from Zhao [23]. We enlarge the target classes by taking the parity of the number of negative edges or vertices on bad cycles into account and consider backdoors with respect to such classes. This allows us to consider larger classes that also contain nonstratified programs. Our main results are as follows:\n1. For target classes based on directed bad even cycles, the detection of backdoors of bounded size is intractable (Theorem 1).\n2. For target classes based on undirected bad even cycles, the detection of backdoors is polynomial-time tractable (Theorem 3).\nThe result (2) is a non-uniform polynomial-time result since the order of the polynomial depends on the backdoor size. An algorithm is uniform polynomialtime tractable if it runs in timeO(f(k)·nc) where f is an arbitrary function and c is a constant independent from k. Uniform polynomial-time tractable problems are also known as fixed-parameter tractable problems [3]. We provide strong theoretical evidence that result (2) cannot be extended to uniform polynomialtime tractability. Further, we establish that result (2) generalizes a result of Lin and Zhao [13]."

We denote the sets of atoms occurring in a rule r or in a program P by at(r) = H(r) ∪ B(r) and at(P ) = ⋃\nr∈P at(r), respectively. A rule r is normal if |H(r)| = 1.

M is an answer-set (or stable set) of a program P if M is a minimal model of PM . We denote by AS(P ) the set of all answer-sets of P .

      "text" : "Backdoors are small sets of atoms which can be used to simplify the considered computational problems in ASP. They have originally been introduced by Williams, Gomes, and Selman [20, 21] as a concept to the analysis of decision heuristics in propositional satisfiability [6]. Fichte and Szeider [5] have recently adapted backdoors to the field of ASP. First, we define a reduct of a program with respect to a given set of atoms. Subsequently, we give the notion of strong backdoors. In the following we refer to C as the target class of the backdoor.\nDefinition 1. Let P be a program, X a set of atoms, and τ ∈ ta(X). The truth assignment reduct of P under τ is the logic program Pτ obtained by\n1. removing all rules r with H(r) ∩ τ−1(1) 6= ∅ or H(r) ⊆ X;\n2. removing all rules r with B+(r) ∩ τ−1(0) 6= ∅;\n3. removing all rules r with B−(r) ∩ τ−1(1) 6= ∅;\n4. removing from the heads and bodies of the remaining rules all literals v,¬v with v ∈ X.\nDefinition 2. A set X of atoms is a strong C-backdoor of a program P if Pτ ∈ C for all truth assignments τ ∈ ta(X). We define the problem of finding strong backdoors as follows: k-Strong C-Backdoor Detection: given a program P , find a strong C-backdoor X of P of size at most k, or report that such X does not exist.\nExample 1. Consider the program P = {b ← a; d ← a; b ← ¬c; a ← d,¬c; a∨ c ← d,¬b; d}. The set X = {b, c} is a strong Horn-backdoor since the truth assignment reducts Pb=0,c=0 = P00 = {← a; d ← a; a ← d; d}, P01 = {← a; d ← a; d}, P10 = {d ← a; a ← d; d}, and P11 = {d ← a; d} are in the target class Horn.\nDefinition 3. Let P be a program and X a set of atoms. We define\nAS(P,X) = {M ∪ τ−1(1) : τ ∈ ta(X ∩ at(P )),M ∈ AS(Pτ ) } .\nLemma 1 ([5]). AS(P ) ⊆ AS(P,X) holds for every program P and every set X of atoms.\nFigure 1 illustrates how we can exploit backdoors to find answer sets of a program. Once we have found a strong C-backdoor X , we can simplify the program P to programs which belong to the target class C. Then we consider all |ta(X)| truth assignments to the atoms in the backdoor X . We compute the answer sets AS(Pτ ) for all τ ∈ ta(X). Finally, we obtain the answer set AS(P ) by checking for each M ∈ AS(Pτ ) whether it gives rise to an answer-set of P .\nExample 2. We consider the program of Example 1. The answer-sets of Pτ are AS(P00) = {{a, d}}, AS(P01) = {{d}}, AS(P10) = {{a, d}}, and AS(P11) = {{d}}. Thus AS(P,X) = {{a, d}, {c, d}, {a, b, d}, {b, c, d}}, and since {c, d} and {a, b, d} are answer-sets of P , we obtain AS(P ) = {{a, b, d}, {c, d}}.\nDefinition 4. A class C of programs is enumerable if for each P ∈ C we can compute AS(P ) in polynomial time."

The definition gives rise to deletion backdoors and the problem of finding deletion backdoors, which is in some cases easier to solve than the problem of finding strong backdoors.\nDefinition 5 (Deletion C-backdoor). Let C be a class of programs. A set X of atoms is a deletion C-backdoor of a program P if P − X ∈ C.

      "heading" : "2.3 Target Classes",
      "text" : "As explained above, we need to consider target classes of programs that only have a small number of answer sets. There are two causes for a program to have a large number of answer sets: (i) disjunctions in the heads of rules, and (ii) certain cyclic dependencies between rules. Disallowing both causes yields socalled stratified programs [9]. In the following we require normality and consider various types of acyclicity to describe target classes. In order to define acyclicity we associate with each normal program P its directed dependency graph DP [1], and its undirected dependency graph UP [11]. DP has as vertices the atoms of P and a directed edge (x, y) between any two atoms x, y for which there is a rule r ∈ P with x ∈ H(r) and y ∈ B(r); if there is a rule r ∈ P with x ∈ H(r) and y ∈ B−(r), then the edge (x, y) is called a negative edge. UP is obtained from Dp by replacing each negative edge e = (x, y) with two undirected edges {x, ve}, {ve, y} where ve is a new negative vertex, and by replacing each remaining directed edge (u, v) with an undirected edge {u, v}. By an (un)directed cycle of P we mean an (un)directed cycle in DP (UP ). An (un)directed cycle is bad if it contains a negative edge (a negative vertex), otherwise it is good.\nIn recent research, Fichte and Szeider [5] have considered target classes that consist of normal programs without directed bad cycles (no-DBC), without undirected bad cycles (no-BC), without directed cycles (no-DC), and without undirected cycles (no-C). no-DBC is exactly the class that contains all stratified programs [1]. Fichte and Szeider have examined the problems k-Strong C-Backdoor Detection and k-Deletion C-Backdoor Detection on the target classes C ∈ {no-C,no-BC,no-DC,no-DBC}.\nExample 3. The set X = {a, b} is a deletion no-DBEC-backdoor of the program P of Example 1, since the simplification P −X = {d; ← ¬c; ← d,¬c} is in the target class no-DBEC. We observe easily that there exists no deletion no-DBEC-backdoor of size 1."

      "heading" : "3.1 Computing Answer-Sets",
      "text" : "First, we discuss the connection between the problem of finding bad even cycles in signed graphs and even cycles in graphs. A signed (directed) graph is a graph whose edges are either positive (unlabeled) or negative. We construct the unlabeled directed graph G′ of a signed directed graph G = (V,E) as follows: we replace in G each positive edge e = (u, v) ∈ E by two edges (u, ve), (ve, v) where ve is a new vertex. Then we remove the labels from the negative edges. Analogously, we construct the unlabeled undirected graph where we ignore the direction of the edges. The following connection was already observed by Aracena, Gajardo, and Montalva [15].\nLemma 2 ([15]). A signed (un)directed graph G has an even cycle if and only if its unlabeled (un)directed graph G′ has a cycle of even length.\nProof. Let G = (V,E) be the signed directed graph and G′ = (V ′, E′) its unlabeled directed graph. Since every positive edge e ∈ E corresponds to two edges e1, e2 ∈ E′ and every negative edge e ∈ E corresponds to one edge e ∈ E′, a cycle in G with an even number of negative edges gives a cycle of even length in G′. Conversely, let G′ = (V ′, E′) be an unlabeled directed graph that contains a cycle of even length. Then G contains an even cycle since every two edges e1, e2 ∈ E′ correspond either to two negative edges or no negative edge. The proof works analogously for undirected graphs.\nThe well-founded reduct of a program P under an interpretation τ is the logic program PWFτ we obtain by removing all rules r ∈ P where some at(r) ∈ τ\n−1(0), and removing from all rules r ∈ P all literals x ∈ at(r) where x ∈ τ−1(1). We obtain the program P+ (P−) by removing all rules from P where B+(r) 6= ∅ (B−(r) 6= ∅ respectively). The well-founded model WFM(P ) of a program P is the least fixed point of the sequence of interpretations where τ0 := ∅, τ −1 k+1(1) consists of the least model of P+(PWFτ ) and τ −1 k+1(0) consists of the atoms of P+(PWFτ ) that are not in the least model.\nLemma 3. The target classes no-DBEC,no-BEC,no-DEC,no-EC are enumerable.\nProof. Zhao [23] has shown that a program without a bad even cycle has either no answer-set or the well-founded model is its answer-set. Since in the definition of the well-founded model the sequence of τ0, τ1, . . . is monotone for a normal program, there is a least fixed point and it can be computed in polynomial time [7, 8]. Thus the answer sets can be computed in polynomial time. Let P be a program and DP (UP ) its (un)directed dependency graph. Since every bad even cycle in DP is also a bad even cycle in UP , this holds for the undirected case. Considering the fact that every bad even cycle in DP is also an even cycle in DP , the lemma sustains for the target class no-DEC. Since every bad even cycle in DP is also an even cycle UP , it prevails for the remaining target class no-EC.\nProposition 1. The problems Consistency, Credulous and Skeptical Reasoning, AS Counting and AS Enumeration are all polynomial-time solvable for programs with strong C-backdoor of bounded size, C ∈ {no-DBEC, no-BEC,no-DEC,no-EC}, assuming that the backdoor is given as an input.\nProof. Let X be the given backdoor. By Lemma 3 each target class C is enumerable. Since we have |AS(P,X)| ≤ 2|X|, we can solve each listed problem by making at most 2|X| polynomial checks.\nIf the problem of determining backdoors is also polynomial-time solvable with respect to the fixed size of a smallest strong C-backdoor, then the ASP problems are polynomial-time solvable.\nLemma 4. For all target classes C ∈ {no-DBEC,no-BEC,no-DEC,no-EC} every deletion C-backdoor is also a strong C-backdoor.\nProof. We show the statement by proving that Pτ ⊆ P −X for every τ ∈ ta(X) and for every program P ∈ C. Let P be a program and X a set of atoms of P . We choose arbitrarily a truth assignment τ ∈ ta(X). For a rule r ∈ P if H(r) ∩ τ−1(1) 6= ∅ or H(r) ⊆ X or B+(r) ∩ τ−1(0) 6= ∅ or B−(r) ∩ τ−1(1) 6= ∅, then r is removed from P by the truth assignment reduct of P under τ . However removing all literals x,¬x with x ∈ X from the head H(r) and the body B(r) yields a new rule r′ ∈ P − X . Thus r′ /∈ Pτ and r′ ∈ P − X where r′ ⊆ r. If the conditions (1), (2), and (3) of Definition 1 above do not apply, then all literals v,¬v with v ∈ X are removed from the heads H(r) and bodies B(r) by the truth assignment reduct of P under τ . This is also done by P −X . Hence Pτ ⊆ P −X ."

In this section we consider the problems k-Strong C-Backdoor Detection and k-Deletion C-Backdoor Detection for the target classes C ∈ {no-DEC,no-DBEC}.\nFor an unlabeled directed graph G = (V,E) and fixed vertices s,m, t ∈ V we define the program Ps,m,t(G) as follows: For each edge e = (v, w) ∈ E where v, w ∈ V and w 6= m we construct a rule re: v ← w. For the edges e′ = (v′,m) where v′ ∈ V we construct a rule re′ : v′ ← ¬m. Then we add the rule rs,t: t ← ¬s.\nLemma 5. Let G = (V,E) be a directed graph and s,m, t three distinct vertices of G. Then G has a simple path from s to t via m if and only if Ps,m,t(G) /∈ no-DBEC.\nProof. Let G be a graph and and p = (s, s1, . . . , sk,m, t1, . . . , tl, t) a path in G where s 6= m,m 6= t, s 6= t. The construction Ps,m,t gives rules {s ← s1; s1 ← s2; . . . sk ← ¬m; m ← t1; t1 ← t2; . . . t ← t; t ← ¬s} ∈ Ps,m,t(G). Since DP contains the cycle c = (s, s1, . . . , sk,m, t1, . . . , t, s) and c contains an even number of negative edges, the program Ps,m,t(G) /∈ no-DBEC.\nConversely, let Ps,m,t(G) ∈ no-DBEC, then Ps,m,t(G) contains a bad even cycle c. Since the construction of Ps,m,t(G) gives only negative edges (t, s) ∈ DPs,m,t(G) and (v,m) ∈ DPs,m,t(G) where v ∈ at(Ps,m,t(G)), the cycle c must have the vertices s,m, and t. Further every rule re ∈ Ps,m,t(G) corresponds to an edge e ∈ E. It follows that there is a simple path s, . . . ,m, . . . , t.\nTheorem 1. The problems k-Strong no-DBEC-Backdoor Detection and k-Deletion no-DBEC-Backdoor Detection are co-NP-hard for every constant k ≥ 0.\nProof. Let k ≥ 0. Let G be a given directed graph and t,m, s vertices of G. It was shown by Lapaugh and Papadimitriou [12] that deciding whether G contains a simple path from s to t via m is NP-complete. By Lemma 5, such a path exists if and only if Ps,m,t(G) /∈ no-DBEC, hence recognizing no-DBEC is co-NPhard. Let Gk denote the graph obtained from G by adding k disjoint bad even cycles. Clearly Gk has a deletion no-DBEC-Backdoor of size ≤ k if and only if Ps,m,t(Gk) ∈ no-DBEC, hence k-Deletion no-DBEC-Backdoor Detection is co-NP-hard. Similarly, Gk has a strong no-DBEC-Backdoor of size ≤ k if and only if Ps,m,t(Gk) ∈ no-DBEC, and so k-Strong no-DBECBackdoor Detection is co-NP-hard as well.\nTheorem 2. Let k > 0 be a constant. The problems k-Deletion no-DECBackdoor Detection and k-Strong no-DEC-Backdoor Detection are polynomial-time tractable.\nProof. By Lemma 2, we can reduce to the problem of finding a cycle of even length in the unlabeled dependency graph. Vazirani and Yannakakis [19] have shown that finding a cycle of even length in a directed graph is equivalent to finding a Pfaffian orientation of a graph. Since Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas [17] have shown that a Pfaffian orientation can be found in polynomial time. For each possible backdoor of size k we need to test ( n\nk\n)\n≤ nk subsets S ⊆ V of size k whether DP − S contains a cycle of even length, respectively DPτ for τ ∈ ta(S). Since we can do this in polynomial time for each fixed k, the theorem follows.\nIn Theorem 2 we consider k as a constant. In the following proposition we show that if k is considered as part of the input, then the problem k-Strong no-DEC-Backdoor Detection is polynomial-time equivalent to the problem Hitting Set and k is preserved. An instance of this problem is a pair (S, k) where S = {S1, . . . , Sm} is a family of sets and k is an integer. The question is whether there exists a set H of size at most k which intersects with all the Si; such H is a hitting set. Note that there is strong theoretical evidence that the problem Hitting Set does not admit uniform polynomial-time tractability [3].\nProposition 2. The problem k-Strong no-DEC-Backdoor Detection is polynomial-time equivalent to the problem Hitting Set.\nProof. The proof is very similar to the proof for target classes without respecting the parity by Fichte and Szeider [5]. We construct a program P as follows. As atoms we take the elements of S = ⋃m\ni=1 Si and new atoms a j i and b j i for\n1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ k + 1. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ j ≤ k + 1 we take two rules rji , s j i where H(r j i ) = {a j i}, B −(rji ) = Si∪{b j i}, B +(rji ) = ∅; H(s j i ) = {b j i}, B−(sji ) = {a j i}, B\n+(sji ) = S. We show that S has a hitting set of size at most k if and only if P has a strong no-DEC-backdoor of size at most k. Let S be a family of sets and H an hitting set of S of size at most k. Choose arbitrarily an atom si ∈ at(P ) ∩S and a truth assignment τ ∈ ta(H). If si ∈ τ−1(0), then B+(s j i ) ∩ τ −1(0) 6= ∅\nfor 1 ≤ j ≤ k + 1. Thus sji /∈ Pτ . If si ∈ τ −1(1), then B−(rji ) ∩ τ −1(1) 6= ∅ for 1 ≤ j ≤ k+ 1. Thus rji /∈ Pτ . Since H contains at least one element e ∈ S from each set S ∈ S, the truth assignment reduct Pτ ∈ no-DEC. We conclude that H is a strong no-DEC-backdoor of P of size at most k.\nConversely, letX be a strong no-DEC-backdoor of P of size at most k. Since the directed dependency graphDP contains k+1 directed even cycles (a j i , b j i , a j i ) and aji (respectively b j i ) is contained in exactly one rule r j i (respectively s j i ), | ⋃\naji | > k and | ⋃ bji | > k. Hence we have to select atoms from Si. Since Si ⊆ B−(r j i ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ j ≤ k + 1, we have to select at least one element from each Si into the backdoor X . Thus we have established that X is a hitting set of S, and so the theorem follows."

Let P be some program. If P has at most k bad even cycles, we can construct a no-DBEC-backdoor X for P by taking one element from each bad even cycle into X . Thus there is a function f such that k ≤ f(l). If a program P has a no-DBEC-backdoor of size 1, it can have arbitrary many even cycles that run through the atom in the backdoor.

We have shown that the backdoor approach with parity target classes generalize a result of Lin and Zhao [13]. Since Theorem 1 states that target classes based on directed even cycles are intractable, we think these target classes are of limited practical interest. The results of this paper give rise to research questions that are of theoretical interest. For instance, it would be stimulating to find out whether the problem k-Strong C-Backdoor Detection is uniform polynomial-time solvable (fixed-parameter tractable) for the classes no-BC and no-BEC, which is related to the problems parity feedback vertex set and parity subset feedback vertex set."
