Introduction\nNew advances on science are developed on what was previously discovered. These are the foundations for introducing new progress and knowledge. At this respect, researchers have to establish differences among what is known and what is still to investigate. In this paper, a collection of abstracts is considered as what is known and thereby the starting point. This collection was created by downloading each paper (or abstract) individually from scientific databases. Later, by applying several statistical methods, it was possible to handle this large dataset and extract relevant information from it. Multidimensional methods as correspondence analysis and factorial analysis are applied for obtaining intriguing conclusions.\nThis paper provides a global vision of the scientific publications related with the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), taking as starting point article abstracts. Through the time, abstracts have been evolving towards higher complexity on used terminology, which makes necessary the use of sophisticated statistical methods and answering questions including: how vocabulary is evolving through the time? Which ones are most influential articles? And which one are the articles that introduced new terms and vocabulary? To answer these, we analyze a dataset composed by 506 abstracts and downloaded from 115 different journals and cover a 18 year-period.\nMoreover, it is illustrated how two types of multivariate analysis for integrating the year of publication of each abstract, and finding out changes on topics and vocabulary, are applied. The analysis presented on further pages allowed us to identify trends and changes in the vocabulary through the passing of the years, which later are presented on didactic and easy-to-understand visual representations. On next section materials and methods are presented. The obtained results on section 3 are discussed. Finally conclusions and further lines of research on section 4 are provided.\n2.

      "text" : "We focus our attention on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, known as SLE or simply “Lupus”. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a disease on which the immune system attacks cells and tissue of the body, resulting in inflammation and damage. There is not cure for SLE and its course is unpredictable. On figure 1, the most common manifestations of SLE are displayed and more information related with its symptoms on http://www.lupusuk.org.uk/ can be found.\nAs documented below, the literature available on SLE has dramatically increased over the past 20 years. The criteria for selecting the abstracts included on the study are based on guidelines provided by the specialized SLE research group of the Hospital Clinic at Barcelona, Spain. Basically, abstracts must show two features in order to be included on this research: first, the name “SLE” should be on the title and each abstract should refer to clinical trials. Only English written documents were considered. Implementing these criteria in our search engines produced 506 abstracts which were published between January 1994 and December 2012. All documents were downloaded from MEDLINE\nAs additional measures of standardization, all the included abstracts should observe title, authors, journal name and year of publication. In this way, the total number of abstracts represents our object of study, and therefore we apply several statistical methods, including correspondence analysis and multiple factor analysis for contingency, on it. On Figure 2A the collected abstracts are classified by year of publication. Figure 2B shows the same abstracts classified by the journal of publication. Note that the year with the biggest number of publications is 2007, equal to 42 articles. Only eight journals have published more than 10 articles concerning this topic. Five journals, Arthritis and Rheumatism, Lupus, The Journal of Rheumatology, Rheumatology Oxford, England and Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, concentrate the 60 % of the articles."

      "text" : "Content-based bibliographic studies is a discipline that attempts to detect main topics in a research domain. By making use of associations or distinctions, researchers might track changes, advances and novelties on big textual datasets. Under this perspective, counting words for topic identification makes sense because it is inferred that documents using the same words are closely related on topic and field (Benzécri, 1981). At this respect, correspondence analysis (CA) techniques (Benzécri, 1973, 1981; Lebart, L., Salem, A., & Berry, 1998; Murtagh, 2005) have proved to be a suitable tool for seeking similarities among documents by identifying words co-occurrences. The above makes the CA a useful tool to be applied on text mining (Bansard et al., 2007; Kerbaol, Bansard, & Coatrieux, 2006; Kerbaol & Bansard, 2000; Morin & Rennes, 2006; Rouillier, Bansard, & Kerbaol, 2002; Šilić, Morin, Chauchat, & DalbeloBašić, 2012).\nWhen doing textual mining, it is identified that progress on science takes place by establishing a link among pioneer words of the first publications, which later are complemented or enriched by further authors. This progress is expressed on how the vocabulary evolves over the time, and how the introduced words are adopted on further research. To track the evolution, a time-oriented viewpoint is adopted, but the word co-occurrence approach is maintained. Multiple factor analysis for contingency tables (MFACT; (Bécue-Bertaut & Pagès, 2004, 2008) are applied on these purposes. Maps of words and abstracts, which takes into account both chronology and co-occurrences, are utilized for disclosing the evolutions on vocabulary by the passing of the years. In other words, by taking advantage of the features of MFACT for comparing chronology and vocabulary on the abstracts, novelties are spotted. MFACT is also a powerful tool for identifying abrupt changes on vocabulary or periods characterized by a flat use of words."

      "text" : "From a content point of view, correspondence analysis (CA) is an essential statistical method for performing text mining (Benzécri, 1981; Lebart, 1998; Murtagh, 2005). At first, the corpus has to be encoded into a lexical table, on which rows are the abstracts while words are the columns. The weights for row-abstracts and column-words are automatically handled on the CA analysis. The proportionality among the margins of the lexical table, the length of abstracts and word counts are also managed during the analysis. In similar way, rows and columns spaces, which are given by the chi-square distances, are used for computing the principal axes on each chart. As result, abstracts are mapped closer when they use a similar vocabulary, and words are mapped closer when they are more frequently present on the same abstract. This demonstrates the suitability of CA for retrieving synonym-relationships without introducing external information on the dataset. That is to say, abstracts whose content is closer on meaning, but expressed on different words, are plotted closer together. Additionally, CA allows us to plot elements of the corpus on a particular way, on which hidden relations among words and abstracts are uncovered. Consequently, it identifies similarities and differences between abstracts in terms of vocabulary or content (Lebart, L., Salem, A., & Berry, 1998). Basically three types of useful information is obtained from the CA.\n Similarities among abstracts based on their verbal content.\n Similarities among words based on their distribution.\n Associations among words, based on their context.\n Mutual associations among abstracts and words through a simultaneous representation of rows and columns, respectively.\nRegarding with its interpretation, CA seeks, axis by axis, the “metakeys” and “metadocs” which better characterize similarities among abstracts based on their verbal content. For example, on a given axis, a “metakey+”/”metakey” is defined by the set of words which most contribute the inertia and simultaneously, is projected on the positive/negative part of the axis (Kerbaol et al., 2006). Therefore, two “metakeys” or two “metadocs” characterize each axis depending on the word/abstract configuration. The highest contributory word/abstracts are projected at only one axis. With this, it is evident that words belonging to the same metakey are frequently used on the same abstracts and, consequently, they relate to the same topic. It is to say that one particular word is used on two or more different contexts. Note that a different context is associated with different meaning. For instance, the word “manifestations” may be referred to the declarations that somebody makes about a particular topic. In contrast, the same word might be used as synonym of “symptoms” observed on the patient. Likewise, the words included on high number of metakeys, known as high dimensional words, provide an important weight to differentiate topics on the corpus. A “metadoc” and a “metakey” which are characterized on the same axis, are quantitatively related through CA. The abstracts that belong to the same “metadoc” use words associated with the same “matekey”. In this\nway, abstracts related with the same topic, are rapidly clustered by identifying their associated metakeys."

The abstracts are described by both the vocabulary and the chronology. MFACT gives an active role to both vocabulary and chronology, but balances their influence in the global analysis. If a relationship does exist between chronology and vocabulary, then the given axis will be highly correlated with them. On Bécue-Bertaut et al., (2008) a detailed explanation of how MFACT are applied on text mining is provided."

Illustrative columns can be introduced and displayed on the principal graphs. Year-in-categories and journal, both considered as categorical illustrative variables, are of interest. Yearin-categories is built from the quantitative variable publication year, with the different years as the categories of this variable.

This observation\nprovides evidence about the content of the abstracts of the period.\n The characteristic increments or words whose frequency significantly increases in a period compared to the previous periods.

Words and\nchronology, that differs from the first principal axis obtained in the separate analysis of the words\n(that is, in CA). With regard to the words, MFACT conserves a small proportion of the total inertia\non the first axes as CA applied to short texts. However, because the first MFACT axis retains a\nproportion of inertia of the word cloud relatively close to the proportion of inertia explained by the\nfirst CA axis. This can be considered as a relevant dispersion direction for the cloud. Regarding to\nchronology, the high correlation of the MFACT first axis with publication year (corr = 0.94) suggests\nthat this axis accounts for the variability of the vocabulary related to time.\nFigure 6 shows the global representation of the words and abstracts on the first principal plane. In\nthis figure, the abstracts are differentiated by three time periods (1994–2000; 2001–2006; 2007–\n2012). These time divisions are justified in Section 2.5.2. This first axis opposes words related to\netiology from two different points of view: genetic aspects and hormonal aspects (on the positive\nside) and symptoms and drugs (on the negative side).

The categories-years (or group of years) are\nprojected as illustrative on the first axis at the centroid of the abstracts published during this period,\nfrom the global point of view.

Changes in lexicon are due mainly to clinic symptoms, their etiology and the presence\nof new developed medications.\nFigure 6 shows how the studies in medical sciences related to SLE have diversified from 1994 to\n2012. In the 1994–2000 period, the main issue was “symptomatoly” and the treatments were almost\nexclusively based on “anti-malaric” (chloroquine and hydrochloroquine) and “antiinflammatory”\n(methotrexate and cyclophosphamide) drugs. Both 2001 and 2002 introduced many new words\nwithout remarkable changes until 2006, when novelties in genetic and etiology were introduced, as\nwell as the use of glucocorticoids (prednisone) and immune-supressive (azathropine and prasterone)\nas partial treatment. In the 2007–2012 period, research focused on genetic and hormonal aspects.\nSome biological therapies have been used (rituximab and belimumab) in this period of time.\nThe words introduced in 2007 showed an increasing interest for the researchers. This year some\ncohort and case-control were performed and new issues about etiology were also studied. Although\ntopics of interest prior to 2001 remain in the following years, there is a more noticeable homogeneity\nin the vocabulary observed from 2001–2012 than from 1994–2006, as it is shown by the greater\nnumber of chronologically characteristic words relative to 2001–2012 in comparison to 1994–2006.\nThis observation is reinforced by the strong similarity between the lexical increments observed in\n2001–2006 and 2007–2012. For instance, Belimumab appears from 2001–2006 (2 citations) and its\nusage increases from 2007–2012 (55).
