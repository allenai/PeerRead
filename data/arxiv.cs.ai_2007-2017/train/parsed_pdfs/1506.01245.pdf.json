      "text" : "represent the semantic distance between concepts in the edge-based semantic similarity measures. In the past, the edge counting is considered to be the default method for the path computation, which is simple, intuitive and has low computational complexity. However, a large lexical taxonomy of such as WordNet has the irregular densities of links between concepts due to its broad domain but. The edge counting-based path computation is powerless for this non-uniformity problem. In this paper, we advocate that the path computation is able to be separated from the edge-based similarity measures and form various general computing models. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of non-uniformity of concept density in a large taxonomic ontology, we propose a new path computing model based on the compensation of local area density of concepts, which is equal to the number of direct hyponyms of the subsumers of concepts in their shortest path. This path model considers the local area density of concepts as an extension of the edge-based path and converts the local area density divided by their depth into the compensation for edge-based path with an adjustable parameter, which idea has been proven to be consistent with the information theory. This model is a general path computing model and can be applied in various edge-based similarity algorithms. The experiment results show that the proposed path model improves the average correlation between edge-based measures with human judgments on Miller and Charles benchmark from less than 0.8 to more than 0.85, and has a big advantage in efficiency than information content (IC) computation in a dynamic ontology, thereby successfully solving the non-uniformity problem of taxonomic ontology.

      "text" : "The measurement of semantic similarity between concepts or words is an important fundamental research topic in natural language processing. It can be widely applied in the fields of intelligent retrieval [1], word sense disambiguation [2], machine learning [3], word spelling error detection and correction [4], machine translation [5] and text segmentation [6], and so on. In the late eighties and early nineties of last century, semantic similarity have been proven to be useful in some specific applications of computational intelligence and a number of semantic similarity methods have been proposed and developed [1,4,6,7,8,9], these methods can be divided into two groups [18]: One is edge counting-based methods, which uses the minimum number of edges of linking the corresponding ontological nodes for measuring similarity [11], and they are applied in some specific applications of computational intelligence with highly constrained taxonomies, such as medical semantic nets. Another group is information theory-based methods, which are based on a large-scale statistic corpus and utilizes the concept’s information content (IC) that depends on the\n*Corresponding author Email addresses: zxh429@263.net\nprobability of encountering an instance of the concept in a corpus to measure semantic similarity between concepts [12]. These methods can be adapted to a particular application that has an approximate area with the corpus.\nWith the emergence and development of large online semantic dictionary of WordNet [13], the researches on semantic similarity have turned to the more general applications, such as information extraction [14] and semantic annotation [15]. Through the continuous efforts of researchers, the methods of semantic similarity measures have been constantly improved and many new approaches are emerging, for example, the depth of concepts have been introduced into the edge counting-based methods [16], and a comprehensive IC intrinsic measurement approach has been proposed [27], which is connected only to the hierarchical structure of an ontology. Moreover, the feature-based measures [34] and hybrid approaches [35] have been proposed in succession.\nAt present, the edge-based and information content-based approaches are still the research focus of semantic similarity. Edge is an important component of the hierarchical structure of a taxonomic ontology, so the edge-based semantic similarity metric is intuitive, easy to understand and has low computational complexity. However, a large lexical taxonomy may has the irregular densities of links between concepts due to its broad domain [18], which would cause the same concept paths in the different density areas of a taxonomic ontology represent different semantic distance. At present this problem can’t be effectively solved in the edge-based approaches, the excellent edge-based similarity approaches only get an about 0.8 correlation degree with human judgments in Miller & Charles (MC30) benchmark [4, 11, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Though, the non-uniformity problem of taxonomic ontology can be better corrected by the information content-based approaches combined with the depth of concept in taxonomy hierarchy, they can get an about 0.85 correlation degree with human judgments in MC30 benchmark [17, 22]. But information content computation require to count the number of all hyponyms of the concept in the taxonomy [17,22], this is a complex computing process in a large taxonomic ontology, so information content-based similarity metric has a drawback of high computational complexity, which may prevent the popularization and application of this approach in a dynamic ontology. Now most of IC calculations assume that the number of hyponyms of each concept is well-known a priori and store them in the hash table of a file enabling an immediate computation in each measurement. However, in the big data era of rapid updating of information, the development trend of taxonomic ontology is online and real-time updates such as the Dbpedia Knowledge Base[37] based on Wikipedia, which represents real community agreement and automatically evolves as Wikipedia changes; as a result, the assumption of priori taxonomic ontology would not be true. Therefore, it is very important and urgent to find out a similarity approach that is equivalent to the performance of IC-based similarity metric and has lower computational complexity.\nIn this paper, we advocate that the path computation is able to be separated from the edge-based similarity measures to form various general computing models, as the information content computation can be isolated from the information theory-based similarity measures; and we exploit the local area density of concepts to establish a new path computing model based on the edge counting, which aim is to better correct the uneven density distribution in WordNet with less computational overhead. This model is a general path computing model and can be applied in most of edge-based similarity algorithms. The experiment results show that our path model can greatly improve the measurement accuracy of various edge-based similarity algorithms and has a huge advantage in computational complexity than the information content computation.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview about the popular similarity approaches related to our study. Section 3 reorganizes the two existing edge-based path computing models and initially explores the approach for solving the\nnon-uniformity problem of density of concepts in the taxonomic ontology. Section 4 proposes a new path computing model based on the local area density of concepts according to a widespread phenomenon in similarity measures and uses the information theory to prove its feasibility. Section 5 evaluates our path computing model from two aspects of performance and efficiency. Section 6 gives several conclusions according to the experiment results."

      "text" : "Currently the semantic dictionaries WordNet [13], VerbNet [23], FrameNet [24] and MindNet [25] can be used as the taxonomic ontology for similarity measures, and most of the popular similarity approaches are implemented and evaluated by using WordNet as the underlying reference ontology because of its clear concept hierarchy and abundant vocabulary. Here we introduce some popular similarity approaches related to our study.\n2.1 Path-based approaches\nThe shortest path distance between concepts has a close relationship with their similarity. Actually, shortest concept path and concept similarity are the different forms of the same characteristics between a pair of concepts, in which a simple corresponding relationship can be created.\nRada et al. [11] exploited the shortest path length connecting two concepts via is-a links to measure their similarity. They defined the similarity between the concepts c1 and c2 as Eq. (1):\nada 1 2( , ) 2Rsim c c MAX P   (1)\nWhere MAX is the maximum path length between concepts in the hierarchy of the taxonomic ontology, and P is the shortest path length between the concepts c1 and c2, which is equal to the number of “is a” links from c1 and c2.\nLeacock and Chodorow [19] mapped the shortest path length between two concepts into a similarity score using a logarithmic function. The similarity between the concepts c1 and c2 was defined as Eq. (2):\n1 2 1 2\n( , ) ( , ) log\n2 LC\nlength c c sim c c\nD   (2)\nWhere D is the depth of the taxonomy hierarchy, it is used to scale the shortest path length.\nHirst and St-Onge [20] defined the similarity between concepts according to their path\ndistance as Eq. (3):\n1 2( , ) *HSsim c c C d k n   (3)\nWhere d is the shortest path length between the concepts c1 and c2, and n is the number of changes of direction in the path. C and k are the constant parameters, respectively let C equal to 8 and k equal to 1. When the path between the concepts c1 and c2 does not exist, which means that there is no similarity between them and their similarity is given as 0. However, this method is mainly used in the measurement of the two concepts relatedness.\n2.2 Path and depth-based approaches\nWu and Palmer [16], in their study on lexical selection problems in machine translation,\nproposed a new Path and depth-based approach on measuring semantic similarity. They defined the similarity between two concepts c1 and c2 as Eq. (4):\n1 2\n1 2\n2 ( , )\n2 WP\nd sim c c\nd p p    (4)\nWhere p1 and p2 are respectively to represent the path length from the concept c1 or c2 to their least common subsumer, d represents the path length from their least common subsumer to the root node, which is equal to the number of “is a” links from the least common subsumer to the root node.\nLiu et al. [4] proposed a different method to measure concept semantic similarity based on path and depth. Their fundamental idea is to simulate the process of human judgment, which is based on the ratio of common features and different features between two concepts in the taxonomy hierarchy. They presented the following two equations:\n1 1 2( , )Liu d\nsim c c d p     \n(5)\n2 1 2\n1 ( , )\n2\nd\nLiu d p sim c c e\ne e\n\n  \n \n  (6)\nWhere α and β are the smoothing factors for depth and path (0<α, β<1), the p is the shortest path length between the concepts c1 and c2, and the d is the depth of their least common subsumer in the taxonomy hierarchy. The experiments showed that when the parameters α and β were respectively taken 0.5, 0.55 in Eq. (5) and 0.25, 0.25 in Eq. (6), the measured similarity scores were closest to human judgments.\nLi and Mclean [18] overcame the weakness of relying alone on the shortest path length between two concepts, and proposed a non-linear function to measure semantic similarity between two concepts. The proposed function is as Eq. (7):\n1 2( , ) d d p LM d d e e sim c c e\ne e\n  \n \n \n (7)\nWhere α and β are the smoothing factors, its purpose is to scale the contribution of the p and d (0<α, β<1). The p is the shortest path length between the concepts c1 and c2, and the d is the depth of their least common subsumer in the taxonomy hierarchy.\nHao et al. [21] attempted to imitate the thought process of human, and proposed a new\nmethod to compute the similarity between concepts. They defined the similarity formula as Eq. (8):\n1 2( , ) (1 ) ( ) / 2 Hao\np d sim c c\np d p d        (8)\nWhere α and β are the smoothing factors, the p is the shortest path length between the concepts c1 and c2, and the d is the depth of their least common subsumer in the taxonomy hierarchy. The experiments showed that when α=0, β=1.0, the measured similarity scores were closest to human judgments.\nSussna [26] proposed an edge weight-based method for measuring semantic similarity. He first computes the minimum distance between all adjacent nodes in the shortest path between the concepts c1 and c2, and then the semantic distance between the concept c1 and c2 is equal to the sum of these minimum distances. The distance formula is as Eq. (9):\n1 2 1 2dis( , ) ( , ) , in | path(c ,c )c c MinDist x y x y  (9) Where x and y are the adjacent nodes in the shortest path between the concept c1 and c2, MinDist(x, y) is the minimum distance between two adjacent nodes x and y. In the MinDist(x, y), the minimum distance isn’t simply representing the number of edge between concepts, but each edge is assigned a weight, then Susssna exploits the depth-relative scaling\nof weight to calculate the MinDist(x, y). The minimum distance is defined as Eq. (10):\n'( ) ( )( , ) 2max[ ( ), ( )] r rw x y w x yMinDist x y depth x depth y     (10)\nWhere →r is a relation of type r (synonym, hypernymy, hyponymy, holonymy, meronymy or\nantonymy), the →r' is the inverse relation of type r, for example, the type r represent hypernymy, and the type r' represent hyponymy. The weight of two adjacent nodes x and y is dedined as Eq. (11):\nmax min ( ) max\n( )\nr r r r\nr\nw x y n x\n    (11)\nWhere nr(x) is the number of relations of type r, leaving x. When the type r is hypernymy, hyponymy, holonymy or meronymy relation, the minr=1 and maxr=2. When the type r is synonym and antonymy relations, the weight is equal to 0 and 2.5, respectively.\n2.3 Information content-based approaches"

      "text" : "Our proposed model is derived from such a widespread phenomenon in similarity measures: In Fig.1, Suppose that the set of subsumers of concept c1 or cl in their shortest path, including their Least Common Subsumer (LCS) and Si, are represented by a function of LocalSubsumers (c1,c2), when the number of direct hyponyms of LocalSubsumers(c1,c2) increases(from Fig. 1.(a) to Fig. 1.(b)), i.e. the density of LocalSubsumers(c1,c2) becomes greater, the information content of LCS(c1,c2) becomes smaller and the information content of concepts c1 and c2 are unchanged, so the similarity between c1 and c2 will decline in IC-based similarity measures according to the equation (12), (13) or equation (14). However, as the density of LocalSubsumers (c1, c2) becomes greater, due to the shortest path between concepts c1and c2 and the depth of their LCS are not changed, so the similarity between c1 and c2 will not change in edge-based similarity measures. This phenomenon reflects the main differences between the measures IC-based and edge-based. In order to make up the deficiencies of edge-based similarity measures in this phenomenon, we propose a path compensation model based on local area density with less computing time overhead.\nDefinition 1. Let C be the set of concepts in the taxonomic ontology, we define the local density of a concept as:\n( ) |{ | ( )}|Density c h C h Sons c   (25)\nWhere, Sons(c) refer to the set of direct hyponyms of the concept c. Note that, the density of concept is only equal to the number of its direct hyponyms, which is directly linked by it, but not all the hyponyms.\nDefinition 2. Let the operation of subsumption ≤ be a binary relation: C×C, C refer to the set of concepts in the ontology. We define the set of the subsumers of concept c1 or c2 in their shortest path as the local area subsumers of concepts c1 and c2; and it is computed as follows:\n1 2 1 2 1 2( , ) { | ( c s) s in path(c ,c )}AreaSubsumers c c s C c s      (26)\nWhere the expression c≤s means that c is a hierarchical specialization of the concept s, path(c1,c2) refer to the shortest path between concepts c1 and c2.\nDefinition 3. We define the local area density of concepts c1 and c2 as:\n1 21 2 ( , ) ( , ) ( )s AreaSubsumers c cAreaDensity c c density s (27)\nDefinition 4.

(27), we consider the local area density of concepts as an extension of the\nedge-based path, and convert the local area density divided by their depth into the compensation for edge-based path with an adjustable parameter, which is based on two such axioms: the semantic distance between concepts monotonically increases according to their local area density, and monotonically decreases according to the average depth of the local area where the concepts lie. Here we use the information theory to prove them, as shown in Table 2 and Table 3.\nProposition 1. a,b,x,y∈C| IC(a)= IC(x) ∧ IC(b)=IC(y) ∧ AreaDensity(a,b)> AreaDensity (x,y) => Distance(a,b) > Distance(x,y).\nProposition 2. a,b,x,y∈C| IC(a)= IC(x) ∧ IC(b)=IC(y) ∧ AreaDensity(a,b)=AreaDensity\n(x,y) ∧ AreaDepth( a ,LCS(a, b), b) > AreaDepth( x, LCS(x, y),y) => Distance(a,b) < Distance(x,y).\n4.2 Application in edge-based measures\nOur proposed method is a generic path computing model and can be applied on various edge-based similarity algorithms. The specific steps are: the original structure of the algorithm formulas remains unchanged, we just use our path model to replace the edge counting-based path computation in the algorithm formulas, and the depth still is computed according to edge counting.\nIn Eq. (30), the adjustable compensation factor λ is an important parameter, which determines the scale in which density converts path length. The λ is an empirical value and is related to the training sets, taxonomic ontology and specific similarity algorithms. We chose six edge-based similarity algorithms to combine with our path computing model and measure the MC30 and RG65 datasets with different values of the parameter λ. Fig. 2 demonstrates how the Pearson correlation coefficients between computer-based measurements and human judgment are changed with the adjustable compensation factor λ. From Fig. 2, we observed that as λ=0.3, the Pearson correlation coefficients are at or near maximum in six selected similarity algorithms (as shown in Table 4). Though the initial correlations in different edge-based algorithms (λ=0) is not the same, but most of their best correlations on MC30 meet or exceed 0.85 by taking different values of the parameter λ for their path compensations(as shown in Table 5). This shows that our path model has the specific function to remedy the structural differences in edge-based similarity algorithms.\nIn summary, we can use the following two ways to apply our model: (1) General way. When the parameter λ is equal to 0.3 in Eq. (30), six edge-based algorithms combined with our model have achieved better correlations on the MC30\nand RG65 datasets, as shown in Table 4. In order to fit all solution, we take λ= 0.3 as a general way of our model. (2) Best way. In order to obtain the best correlations of each method on MC30 or RG65 dataset, we can take the different values of parameter λ for different edge-based\nalgorithm, as shown in Table 5."

In comparison experiments, we exploited WordNet 3.0 as the taxonomic ontology and adopt the JWI (Java WordNet Interface) [33] to query relate data in WordNet3.0 database, which was presided and wrote by Mark Alan.Finlayson who was from Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.\nTable 6 shows the correlations of six edge-based measures combined with different path models respectively, three IC-based measures combined with different IC computations respectively, three feature-based measures and two hybrid measures on MC30 and RG65 datasets. Table 7 shows the similarity scores for each word pair of MC30 in several similarity measures.\nWord 1 Word 2\nMC30 (normali zation)\nWu( path computed\nas edge\ncounting)\nWu (path\ncomputed as in Eq.

      "text" : "Efficiency is an important indicator to assess the usefulness of a method. IC-based similarity measures require to count the number of all hyponyms of the concepts in the taxonomy it average time complexity is O(Max_Nodes) in theory (in WordNet3.0, the Max_Nodes is equal to 82115); while edge-based similarity measures only needs to search the branch where the concepts lie, its average time complexity is O(Max_Depth) in theory (in WordNet3.0, the Max_Depth is equal to 19).In order to validate the big differences between the edge-based measures combined with our path model and IC-based measures in time complexity, we selected the Wu & Palmer’s method (edge-based) and the Lin’ s method (IC-based) for comparing in terms of efficiency. Choosing these two methods for comparison was due to the similar formula structures of these two methods, their similarities are equal to the double commonality between two concepts divided by their complete descriptions or complete feature. After testing, most of the time complexities of the edge-based measures are in the same order of magnitude, the same is true on the IC-based measures. Computer configuration used in our experiment is shown in Table 8. The experiment results are shown in Table 9. The column Totaltime in Table 9 refers to the total time for benchmark, AverageTime to the average time for each word pair, and their units are seconds.\nAs stated in Section 1, the development trend of taxonomic ontology is online and real-time updates. In order to accommodate this trend, we assume that WordNet is a real-time dynamic ontology, rather than experience. So, in IC-based similarity measures, we use the following formula to calculate the total time for each measurement:\nime utingPretreatmentTime ComTota ml p eT Ti  (31)\nWhere, given that the subsumption relationship is recursive, the PretreatmentTime is used to\nexplore the set of hyponyms of the root node to perfectly characterize the rest of concepts that, obviously, are specializations of the root, and count and store the number of all hyponyms of all concepts in a hash table. The ComputingTime is used for the IC-based algorithms to compute the similarity scores of each word pair on MC30 or RG65 according to the hash table of hyponym."

      "text" : "From the above experiment results, we can draw several conclusions. First, the results form Table 4 to Table 7 show our path model can greatly improve the measurement accuracy of various edge-based similarity algorithms, including the path-based and Path & depth – based algorithms. Combined with our path model, there are five edge-based algorithms to obtain the correlation of over 0.85 and the best correlation reaches 0.87 on MC30, which is the widely recognized repeatable highest level [10,35] of computer-based similarity measures on MC30 dataset and quite close the average correlation (0.9015) between individual subjects of human replication reported in Resnik’s replication [12] of Miller and Charles experiment. Through the analysis, we found that good result mainly thanks to the capacity that our path model effectively reduce the impact of high local area density on similarity measurement, for example, for the word pairs monk & slave, coast & forest, lad & wizard, etc., converting their local area densities into their path by our path model greatly improved their similarity accuracy, as shown in Table 7. Therefore, our model successfully solved the non-uniformity problem of taxonomic ontology.\nWith regards to the equivalence with IC-based measures, from the results in Table 6, it is observed that the role of our path model in the edge-based measures is equivalent with the depth in the IC-based measures. Before the introduction of depth, the results in IC-based measures(IC computed as Seco et al.) are not satisfactory; and the introduction of the depth of subsumers (IC computed as Sanchez et al.) improves the average correlation of IC-based measures on MC30 from 0.8 to more than 0.85. Similarly, our path model improves the\naverage correlation of edge-based measures on MC30 from less than 0.8 to more than 0.85.\nWith regards to the measuring efficiency, the results in Table 9 confirmed that our path model has a big advantage in efficiency than IC computation. The edge-based measures combined with our path model are almost the same faster as the measures based on edge counting, and more than several dozen times faster than IC-based measures. This means that the edge-based measures combined with our model has a better application prospect than IC-based measures. In fact, our model is essentially a way to combine the edge-based path with density skillfully. The density computation in our model only need to count the number of direct hyponyms of concept, rather than all the hyponyms, so it can save a lot of computing time. In contrast, the IC computation must completely count the number of all the hyponyms or leaves of concept, so it takes a lot of computing time. Although the efficiency of IC computation can be improved through the precomputing the number of all hyponyms of all the concepts and saving them in a file, but this method is powerless for a real-time updated taxonomic ontology."

      "heading" : "7. Conclusions",
      "text" : "Edge is an important component of the hierarchical structure of a taxonomic ontology.\nThe edge-based similarity measure has the advantages of simple, intuitive and easy to understand and it has better performance in some specific applications of computational intelligence with highly constrained taxonomies. But edge-based similarity measures are encountering the problems of the non-uniformity in a large taxonomic ontology such as WordNet. Though, this problem can be better corrected by the IC-based measure, but the IC computation has to consume a lot of computing time in a dynamic ontology, this is difficult to bear in some real-time applications such as QA systems and Web information retrieval. The proposed model broke this deadlock; it can greatly improve the measurement accuracy of various edge-based similarity algorithms with less computing time overhead. Experiments show that our model has broad application prospects.\nOur model is essentially a way to combine the edge-based path with density skillfully. It considers the local area density of concepts as an extension of the edge-based path and converts the local area density divided by their depth into the compensation for edge-based path with less computing time overhead, which successfully solved the non-uniformity problem of taxonomic ontology. Through this study, we believe more firmly that the similarity measure in a large taxonomic ontology require to combine multi-source information extracted from the ontology. In future, we will work to find out more semantic evidences in WordNet and integrate them with the edge-based similarity measure to challenge the theoretical upper bound (0.9015) of the correlation between computer-based measurement and human judgment."

    "abstractText" : "The shortest path between two concepts in a taxonomic ontology is commonly used to represent the semantic distance between concepts in the edge-based semantic similarity measures. In the past, the edge counting is considered to be the default method for the path computation, which is simple, intuitive and has low computational complexity. However, a large lexical taxonomy of such as WordNet has the irregular densities of links between concepts due to its broad domain but. The edge counting-based path computation is powerless for this non-uniformity problem. In this paper, we advocate that the path computation is able to be separated from the edge-based similarity measures and form various general computing models. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of non-uniformity of concept density in a large taxonomic ontology, we propose a new path computing model based on the compensation of local area density of concepts, which is equal to the number of direct hyponyms of the subsumers of concepts in their shortest path. This path model considers the local area density of concepts as an extension of the edge-based path and converts the local area density divided by their depth into the compensation for edge-based path with an adjustable parameter, which idea has been proven to be consistent with the information theory. This model is a general path computing model and can be applied in various edge-based similarity algorithms. The experiment results show that the proposed path model improves the average correlation between edge-based measures with human judgments on Miller and Charles benchmark from less than 0.8 to more than 0.85, and has a big advantage in efficiency than information content (IC) computation in a dynamic ontology, thereby successfully solving the non-uniformity problem of taxonomic ontology.",
