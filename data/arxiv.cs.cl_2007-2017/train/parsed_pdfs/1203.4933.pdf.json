      "text" : "This paper gives a detail overview about the modified features selection in CRF (Conditional Random Field) based Manipuri POS (Part of Speech) tagging. Selection of features is so important in CRF that the better are the features then the better are the outputs. This work is an attempt or an experiment to make the previous work more efficient. Multiple new features are tried to run the CRF and again tried with the Reduplicated Multiword Expression (RMWE) as another feature. The CRF run with RMWE because Manipuri is rich of RMWE and identification of RMWE becomes one of the necessities to bring up the result of POS tagging. The new CRF system shows a Recall of 78.22%, Precision of 73.15% and F-measure of 75.60%. With the identification of RMWE and considering it as a feature makes an improvement to a Recall of 80.20%, Precision of 74.31% and F-measure of 77.14%.\nKEYWORDS\nCRF, RMWE, POS, Features, Stemming, Root"

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "The Manipuri language or simply Manipuri is among the 21 scheduled language of Indian Constitution. This language is mainly spoken in Manipur in India and in some parts of Myanmar and Bangladesh. Manipuri uses two scripts, one is the borrowed Bengali script and another is the original script that is Meitei Mayek (Script). Our present work adopts the Manipuri in Bengali Script. It is because most of the Manipuri manuscripts are written in Bengali script and thus the corpus collection for Manipuri in Bengali script becomes an easy task.\nThis language is a Tibeto-Burman language and the distinction from other language Indian is its highly agglutinative nature. As an example (observe Section 2) single word can have 10 suffixes or more. The affixes play the most important role in the structure of the language. The affixes play an important role in determining the POS of a word. Apart from the agglutinative nature, Manipuri is a mono-syllabic, influenced and enriched by the Indo-Aryan languages of Sanskrit origin and English. A clear-cut demarcation between morphology and syntax is not possible in this language. In Manipuri, words are formed in three processes called affixation, derivation and compounding as mentioned in [1]. In Manipuri roots are of two types, they are free and bound root [2]. The majority of the roots found in the language are bound and the affixes are the determining factor of the class of the words in the language.\nThe POS tagging is an important topic in the application of Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Summarization, Machine Translation (MT), Event Tracking etc. for all languages and so is for Manipuri. Lack of an efficient POS tagger for Manipuri hampers the other research area of NLP. So the real challenges to bring up the accuracy level motivate us for more experiment and more research in this area.\nEvery language linguistically has their own POS and computer experts tried their best for the automatic POS tagging using machine. Different attempts are seen for different major languages using different approaches such as for English a Simple Rule-based Part of Speech Tagger is reported in [3], transformation-based error-driven learning [4], decision trees models applied to labelling of texts with parts of speech is reported in [5], Markov model in [6], maximum entropy methods [7] and Part-of-speech tagging using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in [8]. For Chinese, the works are found ranging from rule based, HMM to Genetic Algorithm [9]-[12]. For Indian languages like Bengali works are reported in [13]-[15] and for Hindi [16]. Works of POS tagging using CRF can also be seen in [17].\nWorks of Manipuri POS tagging are reported in [18]-[19]. For the identification of Reduplicated Multiword Expression (RMWE) is reported in [20]. Identification of RMWE using CRF is reported in [21] and improvement of MWE using RMWE is reported in [22]. Web Based Manipuri Corpus for Multiword NER and Reduplicated MWEs Identification using SVM is reported in [23].\nSection 2 describes about the agglutinative nature of Manipuri which leads us to the idea of stemming. Section 3 gives the idea of Manipuri Reduplicated MWEs, stemming of Manipuri words so that it can be used as a feature is describe in Section 4. Section 5 gives the concept of Conditional Random Field (CRF). CRF model and Feature selection is described in Section 6 and Section 7 reports the experiments and the evaluation, improvement using reduplicated MWEs is discussed in Section 8 and the conclusion is drawn in Section 9."

      "heading" : "2. ROOT AND AN EXAMPLE OF AN AGGLUTINATIVE MANIPURI WORD",
      "text" : "In Manipuri roots are generally considered by replacing a large number of morphemes. They are the carrier of principal meaning in the composition of a word [2]. Roots are different in different languages. In English roots are almost free which means that there are separate sets of roots that denote separate grammatical categories such as noun (box, boy, bird etc), verb (run, cry, try etc), adjective (tall, thin, large etc) etc. This is not in the case of Manipuri since there are no separate roots for adjective and verb in Manipuri.\nIn Manipuri roots are of two types, they are free and bound root. Free roots can stand alone without suffixes in a sentence and bound root takes other affixes excepting the one with free roots.\nThis language is highly agglutinative and to prove with this point let us site an example word: “ ” (“pusinhənjərəmgədəbənidəko”), which means “(I wish I) myself would have caused to bring in (the article)”. Here there are 10 (ten) suffixes being used in a verbal root, they are “pu” is the verbal root which means “to carry”, “sin”(in or inside), “hən” (causative), “jə” (reflexive), “rəm” (perfective), “gə” (associative), “də” (particle), “bə” (infinitive), “ni” (copula), “də” (particle) and “ko” (endearment or wish).\nAltogether 72 (seventy two) affixes are listed in Manipuri out of which 11 (eleven) are prefixes and 61 (sixty one) are suffixes. Table 1 shows the prefixes of 10 (ten number) because the prefix\n(mə) is used as formative and pronomial so only one is included and like the same way table 2 shows the suffixes in Manipuri with only are 55 (fifty five) suffix in the table since some of\nthe suffixes are used with different form of usage such as 3 (gum) which is used as particle as well as proposal negative, (də) as particle as well as locative and (nə) as nominative, adverbial, instrumental or reciprocal."

      "text" : "In Manipuri works for identification of reduplicated MWEs has been reported for the first time in [20]. In this paper the process of reduplication is defined as: ‘reduplication is that repetition, the result of which constitutes a unit word’. These single unit words are the RMWE.\nThe reduplicated MWEs in Manipuri are classified mainly into four different types. These are: 1) Complete Reduplicated MWEs, 2) Mimic Reduplicated MWEs, 3) Echo Reduplicated MWEs and 4) Partial Reduplicated MWEs. Apart from these fours there are also cases of a) Double reduplicated MWEs and b) Semantic Reduplicated MWEs."

      "heading" : "3.1 Complete Reduplication MWEs",
      "text" : "In the complete reduplication MWEs the single word or clause is repeated once forming a single unit regardless of phonological or morphological variations. Interestingly in Manipuri these complete reduplication MWEs can occur as Noun, Adjective, Adverb, Wh- question type, Verbs, Command and Request.\nNoun\nHere the reduplication words are generally noun but sometimes the suffixes –dǝ, –gi and –ki are generally added to the second word of reduplication to identify itself as noun. One such MWE is\n(‘mǝrik mǝrik’) which means ‘drop by drop’.\nAlso some of these words are inflected MWEs too with one of the above suffixes, say; 45 45 (‘yum yum-dǝ’) which means ‘to every house’. The following example sentence in Manipuri:\nlam lam-gi mǝsa-gi lon lei place place own-gen language has\nMeans, ‘Every place/country has its own language’, when translated in English.\nAdjective\nIn this type of reduplication MWEs, the first word is repeated to form an adjective by adding – bǝ or –pǝ to the second word. For example, 6 7 6 7 (‘ǝnou ǝou-ba’) which means ‘new’ and 6 8 6 8 (‘ǝtek ǝtek-pa’ ) which means ‘fresh’ etc. The following example sentence in Manipuri:\nǝy ǝtek ǝtekpa lǝy pam-mi I fresh fresh flower like-asp\nMeans, ‘I like fresh flowers.’ when translated in English.\nVerb\nThe verb reduplication is different from the reduplication of noun, adjective, adverb and whquestion since they are generally of subject-objectless structure. For example, ;J F ;J F (‘cǝtle cǝtle’) means ‘am going/leaving’. Sometimes with this reduplication ‘I’ can be silent and can mean ‘I am going/leaving’. The verb word generally ends with any of these verbal inflections -le, -re, -gani, -lurǝ etc. depending on the tense.\nAdverb\nIn case of adverbs –nǝ is usually added to both the words of the reduplication. It is different from the above in such a way that the inflection is added to both the words in reduplication. For example, (‘kǝp-na kǝp-na’) which means ‘cryingly’ and 4 4 (‘yam-nǝ yam-nǝ’) which means ‘very’. The following example sentence in Manipuri:\nǝy kǝpna kǝpna skul-dǝ cǝtli I cryingly cryingly school-loc go\nMeans, ‘I go to school cryingly.’ when translated to English.\nWh- question type\nLike English, wh- type of questions can be framed in Manipuri but it uses reduplication MWEs. For example:\n(‘kǝri kǝri’) means ‘what/which’. (‘kǝna kǝna’) means ‘who’. 4 4 (‘kǝday kǝday’) means ‘where’. (‘kǝrǝm kǝrǝm’) means ‘how’.\nThe following example sentence in Manipuri: kǝna kǝna lam yengbǝ cǝtkani?\nwho who land to see go-asp\nMeans ‘who will go to see the land?’ when translated to English.\nCommand\nThe reduplication is used in such a manner that the subject is generally a second person but it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence.\nFor example, ;J F ;J F (‘cǝtlo cǝtlo’) means ‘go-comd go-comd’ and which can be translated to English as ‘Go.’\nRequest\nReduplication can be present in request sentences also. For example, >FD >FD (‘leƞ-bi-ro leƞ-bi-ro’) means ‘please go/please leave’."

This work is an attempt or an experiment to make the previous work more efficient. The C++ based CRF++ 0.53 package1 is used in this work and it is readily available as open source for segmenting or labeling sequential data.\nThe CRF model for Manipuri POS tagging (Figure 1) consists of mainly data training and data testing. The important processes required in POS tagging using CRF are feature selection, preprocessing which includes arrangement of tokens or words into sentences with other notations, creation of model file after training and finally the testing with the test corpus.\nFollowing sub sections explain the overall process in detail:\n1 http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/"
    }, {
      "heading" : "6.1 Feature Selection",
      "text" : "The feature selection is important in CRF. The various features used in the system are,\nF= { Wi-m, … ,W i-1, W i, W i+1, …, W i+n, SWi-m, …, SWi-1, SWi, SWi+1,… , SWi-n , number of acceptable standard suffixes, number of acceptable standard prefixes, acceptable suffixes present in the word, acceptable prefixes present in the word, word length, word frequency, digit feature, symbol feature }\nThe details of the set of features that have been applied for POS tagging in Manipuri are as follows:\nSurrounding words as feature: Preceeding word(s) or the successive word(s) are important in POS tagging because these words play an important role in determining the POS of the present word.\nSurrounding Stem words as feature: The Stemming algorithm mentioned in Section 4 is used so that the preceding and following stem words of a particular word can be used as features. It is because the preceding and following words influence the present word POS tagging.\nNumber of acceptable standard suffixes as feature: As mention in Section 2, Manipuri being an aggllutinative language the suffixes plays an important in determining the POS of a word. For every word the number of suffixes are identified during stemming and the number of suffixes is used as a feature.\nNumber of acceptable standard prefixes as feature: Same is the case for the prefixes thus it also plays an important role too for Manipuri since it is a highly agglutinative language. For every word the number of prefixes are identified during stemming and the number of prefixes is used as a feature.\nAcceptable suffixes present as feature: The standard 61 suffixes of Manipuri which are identified is used as one feature. As mention with an example in Section 2, suffixes are appended one after another and so far the maximum number of appended suffixes is reported as ten. So taking into account of such case, for every word ten columns separated by a space are created for every suffix present in the word. A “0” notation is being used in those columns when the word consists of no acceptable suffixes.\nAcceptable prefixes present as feature: 11 prefixes have been manually identified in Manipuri and the list of prefixes is used as one feature. For every word if the prefix is presents then a column is created mentioning the prefix, otherwise the “0” notation is used. Upto three prefixes are considered for observation.\nLength of the word: Length of the word is set to 1 if it is greater than 3 otherwise, it is set to 0. Very short words are generally pronouns and rarely proper nouns.\nWord frequency: A range of frequency for words in the training corpus is set: those words with frequency <100 occurrences are set the value 0, those words which occurs >=100 are set to 1. The word frequency is considered as one feature since occurrence of determiners, conjunctions and pronouns are abundant.\nDigit features: Quantity measurement, date and monetary values are generally digits. Thus the digit feature is an important feature. A binary notation of ‘1’ is used if the word consist of a digit else ‘0’.\nSymbol feature: Symbols like $,%, - etc. are meaningful in textual uses, so the feature is set to 1 if it is found in the token otherwise, it is set to 0. This helps to recognize SYM (Symbols) and QFNUM (Quantifier number) tags."

Before undergoing training and testing in the CRF the input document is converted into a multiple token file with fixed columns and the template file allows the feature combination and selection which is specified in section 6.1.\nTwo standard files of multiple tokens with fixed columns are created: one for training and another one for testing. In the training file the last column is manually tagged with all those identified POS tag2 whereas in the test file we can either use the same tagging for comparisons or only ‘O’ for all the tokens regardless of POS."

It is considered to be the Gold standard but later split into two file one for training file and another for testing.\nAs mention in section 6 a Java program is written in order to identify the required features except the POS tagging since it’s manually tag and arrange the feature column wise separated by a space. So, each line becomes a sentence. The last column of both the training and testing\n2 http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL2007/iiit_tagset_guidelines.pdf\nfiles are tagged with the POS. The last column of the test file is also tagged with POS so that the output can be compared easily.\nIn order to evaluation the experiment, the system used the parameters of Recall, Precision and F-score. It is defined as follows:\nRecall, R = texttheinanscorrectofNo\nsystemthebygivenanscorrectofNo\nPrecision, P = systemthebygivenansofNo\nsystemthebygivenanscorrectofNo\nF-score, F = RP2β 1)PR2(β ++ Where β is one, precision and recall are given equal weight.\nGenerally a number of problems have been identified because of the typical nature of the Manipuri language. The first thing is the highly agglutinative nature. Another problem is the word category which is not so distinct. The verbs consist of both free and bound category but classifying the bounded categories is a problem. Another problem is to classify basic root forms according to the word class. Although the distinction between the noun class and verb classes is relatively clear; the distinction between nouns and adjectives is often vague. Distinction between a noun and an adverb becomes unclear because structurally a word may be a noun but contextually it is adverb. Also a part of root may also be a prefix, which leads to wrong tagging. The verb morphology is more complex than that of noun. Sometimes two words get fused to form a complete word"

This model outperformed the previous model in terms of efficiency with the Recall (R) of 78.22%, Precision (P) of 73.15% and F-measure (F) of 75.60%. With the RMWE as a feature it even betters the efficiency by the Recall (R) of 80.20%, Precision (P) of 74.31% and F-measure (F) of 77.14%.\nOf course features selections were manual so a better approach is acceptable to avoid the hit and trial method. A better approach must be the future research area road map because until and unless we have an efficient POS tagger much of the NLP works of Manipuri will be hampered."

    "abstractText" : "This paper gives a detail overview about the modified features selection in CRF (Conditional Random Field) based Manipuri POS (Part of Speech) tagging. Selection of features is so important in CRF that the better are the features then the better are the outputs. This work is an attempt or an experiment to make the previous work more efficient. Multiple new features are tried to run the CRF and again tried with the Reduplicated Multiword Expression (RMWE) as another feature. The CRF run with RMWE because Manipuri is rich of RMWE and identification of RMWE becomes one of the necessities to bring up the result of POS tagging. The new CRF system shows a Recall of 78.22%, Precision of 73.15% and F-measure of 75.60%. With the identification of RMWE and considering it as a feature makes an improvement to a Recall of 80.20%, Precision of 74.31% and F-measure of 77.14%.",
