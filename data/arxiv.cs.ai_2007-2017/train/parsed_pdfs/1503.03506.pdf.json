      "text" : "High computational costs of manifold learning prohibit its application for large point sets. A common strategy to overcome this problem is to perform dimensionality reduction on selected landmarks and to successively embed the entire dataset with the Nyström method. The two main challenges that arise are: (i) the landmarks selected in non-Euclidean geometries must result in a low reconstruction error, (ii) the graph constructed from sparsely sampled landmarks must approximate the manifold well. We propose the sampling of landmarks from determinantal distributions on non-Euclidean spaces. Since current determinantal sampling algorithms have the same complexity as those for manifold learning, we present an efficient approximation running in linear time. Further, we recover the local geometry after the sparsification by assigning each landmark a local covariance matrix, estimated from the original point set. The resulting neighborhood selection based on the Bhattacharyya distance improves the embedding of sparsely sampled manifolds. Our experiments show a significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art landmark selection techniques."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Spectral methods are central for a multitude of applications in machine learning, statistics, and computer vision, such as dimensionality reduction [30, 34], classification [25, 33], and segmentation [28, 31]. A limiting factor for the spectral analysis is the computational cost of the eigen decomposition. To overcome this limitation, the Nyström method [36] is commonly applied to approximate the spectral decomposition of\nthe Gramian matrix. A subset of rows/columns is selected and based on the eigen decomposition of the resulting small sub-matrix, the spectrum of the original matrix can be approximated. While the Nyström extension is the standard method for the matrix reconstruction, the crucial part is the subset selection. In early work [36], uniform sampling without replacement was proposed. This was followed by numerous alternatives including K-means clustering [37], greedy approaches [23, 14] , and volume sampling [4, 11]. A recent comparison of several approaches is presented in [20].\nOf particular interest for subset selection is volume sampling [11], equivalent to determinantal sampling [4], because reconstruction error bounds exist. This method is, however, not used in practice because of the high computational complexity of sampling from the underlying distributions [20]. Independently, determinantal point processes (DPPs) have been proposed recently for tracking and pose estimation [18]. They were originally designed to model the repulsive interaction between particles. DPPs are well suited for modeling diversity in a point set. A sampling algorithm for DPPs was presented in [17, 18], which has complexity O(n3) for n points. Since this algorithm has the same complexity as the spectral analysis, it cannot be directly used as a subset selection scheme.\nIn this paper, we focus on nonlinear dimensionality reduction for large datasets via manifold learning. Popular manifold learning techniques include kernel PCA [27], Isomap [30], and Laplacian eigenmaps [6]. All of these methods are based on a kernel matrix of size O(n2) that contains the information about the pairwise relationships between the input points. The spectral decomposition of the kernel matrix leads to the low-dimensional embedding of the points. For large n, one is interested in avoiding its explicit calculation and storage. In contrast to general rank-k matrix approximation, this is possible by taking the nature of the non-linear dimensionality reduction into account and relating the entries of the kernel matrix\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n03 50\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n1 M\nar 2\n01 5\ndirectly to the original point set.\nConsequently, we propose to perform DPP sampling on the original point set to extract a diverse set of landmarks. Since the input points lie in a non-Euclidean space, ignoring the underlying geometry leads to poor results. To account for the non-Euclidean geometry of the input space, we replace the Euclidean distance with the geodesic distance along the manifold, which is approximated by the graph shortest path distance. Due to the high complexity of DPP sampling, we derive an efficient approximation that runs in O(ndk), with input dimensionality d and subset cardinality k. The algorithm restricts the updates to be local, which enables sampling on complex geometries. This, together with its low computational complexity, makes the algorithm well suited for the subset selection in large scale manifold learning.\nA consequence of the landmark selection is that the manifold is less densely sampled than before, making its approximation with neighborhood graphs more difficult. It was noted in [3], as a critical response to [30], that the approximation of manifolds with graphs is topologically unstable. In order to improve the graph construction, we retain the local geometry around each landmark by locally estimating the covariance matrix on the original point set. This allows us to compare multivariate Gaussian distributions with the Bhattacharyya distance for neighborhood selection, yielding improved embeddings. A shorter version of this work was published in [32]."

Non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques are based on a positive semidefinite kernel K, with a typical choice of Gaussian or heat kernel Ki,j = exp(−‖xi−xj‖2/2σ2). The resulting kernel matrix is of size O(n2). Necessary for spectral analysis is the eigen decomposition of the kernel matrix, which has complexity O(n3). For most techniques, it is only necessary to compute the leading k eigenvectors. The problem can therefore also be considered as finding the best rank-k approximation of the matrix K, with the optimal solution Kk = ∑k i=1 λiuiu > i , where λi is the i-th largest eigenvalue and ui is the corresponding eigenvector."

      "text" : "A large variety of methods have been proposed for selecting the subset J . For general matrix approximation, this step is referred to as row/column selection of the matrix K, which is equivalent to selecting a subset of points X. This property is important because it avoids explicit computation of the O(n2) entries in the kernel matrix K. We focus on volume sampling for subset selection because of its theoretical advantages [11]. We employ the factorization KJ×J = Y > J YJ , which exists because KJ is positive semidefinite. Based on this factorization, the volume Vol({Yi}i∈J) of the simplex spanned by the origin and the selected points YJ is calculated, which is equivalent to the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by YJ . The subset J is then sampled proportional to the squared volume. This is directly related to the calculation of the determinant with det(KJ×J) = det(Y >J YJ) = det(YJ)\n2 = Vol2({Yi}i∈J). These ideas were further generalized in [4] based on annealed determinantal distributions\nps(J) ∝ det(KJ×J)s = det(Y >J YJ)s = det(YJ)2s. (2)\nThis distribution is well defined because the principal submatrices of a positive semidefinite matrix are themselves positive semidefinite. Varying the exponent s ≥ 0 results in a family of distributions, modeling the annealing behavior as used in stochastic computations. For s = 0 this is equivalent to uniform sampling [36]. In the following derivations, we focus on s = 1. It was shown in [11] that for J ∼ p(J), |J | = k\nE [ ‖K − K̃‖tr ] ≤ (k + 1)‖K −Kk‖2F , (3)\nwhere K̃ is the Nyström reconstruction of the kernel based on the subset J , Kk the best rank-k approximation achieved by selecting the largest eigenvectors, and ‖.‖F the Frobenius norm. It was further shown that the factor k+1 is the best possible for a k-subset. Related bounds were presented in [5]. A further result is that for any matrix K, there exist k + k(k + 1)/ rows whose span contains the rows of a rank-k matrix K̃k such that\n‖K − K̃k‖2F ≤ (1 + ε)‖K −Kk‖2F . (4)\nThis result establishes a connection between matrix approximation and projective clustering, with the selection of a subsets columns being similar to the construction of a coreset [1, 15]."

      "text" : "As described in Section 2.2, sampling from determinantal distributions is used for row/column selection. Independently, determinantal point processes (DPPs) were introduced for modeling probabilistic mutual exclusion [22]. They present an attractive scheme for ensuring diversity in the selected subset. An interesting construction of DPPs is based on L-ensembles [9]. Given a positive semidefinite matrix L ∈ Rn×n, the likelihood for selecting the subset J ⊆ {1, . . . , n} is\nPL(J) = det(LJ×J)\ndet(L+ I) , (5)\nwhere I is the identity matrix and LJ×J is the submatrix of L containing the rows and columns indexed by J . Identifying the L-ensemble matrix L with the kernel matrix K, we can apply DPPs to sample subsets from the point set X.\nTo date, applications using determinantal point processes have assumed Euclidean geometry [8, 18]. For non-linear dimensionality reduction, we assume that the data points lie on non-Euclidean spaces, such as the Swiss roll in Fig. 1(a). To evaluate the performance of DPPs on manifolds, we sample from the Swiss roll. Since we know the construction rule in this case, we can invert it and display the sampled 3D points in the underlying 2D space. The result in Fig. 1(b) shows\nthat the inner part of the roll is almost entirely neglected, as a consequence of not taking the manifold structure into account. A common solution is to use geodesic distances [30], which can be approximated by the graph shortest path algorithm. Consequently, we replace the Euclidean distance ‖.‖ in the construction of the kernel matrix K with the geodesic distance Ki,j = exp(−‖xi − xj‖2geo/2σ2). The result is shown in Fig. 1(c). We observe a clear improvement in the diversity of the sampling, now also including points in the interior part of the Swiss roll."

      "heading" : "3.2 Efficient Approximation of DPP Sampling on Manifolds",
      "text" : "We have seen in the last sections that it is possible to adapt determinantal sampling to non-Euclidean geometries and that error characterizations for the subset selection exist. However, we are missing an efficient sampling algorithm for dealing with large point sets. In [11], an approximative sampling based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is proposed to circumvent the combinatorial problem with( n k ) possible subsets. Further approximations include sampling proportional to the diagonal elements Kii or its squared version K2ii, leading to additive error bounds [5, 13]. In [12], an algorithm is proposed that yields a k! approximation to volume sampling, worsening the approximation from (k + 1) to (k + 1)!.\nAlgorithm 1 DPP sampling equivalent to [18]\nRequire: Eigen decomposition of K: {(vi, λi)}ni=1 1: for i = 1 to n do 2: Add eigenvector vi with probability\nλi λi+1\nto V 3: end for 4: B = V > 5: for 1 to |V | do 6: Select i ∈ 1 . . . n with probability P (i) ∝ ‖Bi‖2 7: J ← J ∪ i 8: Bj ← Proj⊥BiBj for all j ∈ {1, . . . , n} 9: end for\n10: return J\nAn exact sampling algorithm for DPPs was presented in [17, 18], which requires the eigen decomposition of K = ∑n i=1 λiviv > i . We state an equivalent reformulation of this sampling algorithm in Algorithm 1. First, eigenvectors are selected proportional to the magnitude of their eigenvalues and stored as columns in V . Assuming m vectors are selected then V ∈ Rn×m. By setting B = V >, we denote the rows of V as Bi ∈ Rm. In each iteration, we select one of the n points where point i is selected proportional to the squared norm ‖Bi‖2. The point is added to the subset J . After the selection of i, all vectors Bj are projected to the or-\nthogonal space of Bi. Since Proj⊥BiBi = 0, the same point is almost surely not selected twice. The update formulation differs from [18], where an orthonormal basis of the eigenvectors in V to the i-th basis vector ei ∈ Rn is constructed. Both formulations are equivalent but provide a different point of view on the algorithm. The modification is, however, essential for the justification of the proposed efficient sampling procedure. The following proposition characterizes the behavior of the update in the algorithm.\nProposition 1. Let Bi, Bj ∈ Rm \\ {0} be two nonzero vectors in Rm, and θ = ∠(Bi, Bj) be the angle between them. Then\n‖Proj⊥BiBj‖ 2 = ‖Bj‖2 sin2 θ, (6)\nwhere Proj⊥BiBj is the the projection of Bj on the subspace perpendicular to Bi. For Bi 6= 0 and Bj = 0 the projection is ‖Proj⊥BiBj‖ 2 = 0.\nWe state the proof in the supplementary material.\nSampling from a determinantal distribution is not only advantageous because of the presented error bounds but it also makes intuitive sense that a selection of a diverse set of points yields an accurate matrix reconstruction. The computational complexity of Algorithm 1 is, however, similar or even higher than for manifold learning because the spectral decomposition of a dense graph is required, whereas Laplacian eigenmaps operate on sparse matrices. An approach for efficient sampling proposed in [18] works with the dual representation of K = Y >Y to obtain Q = Y Y >, with Q being hopefully smaller than the matrix K. Considering that we work with a Gaussian kernel matrix, this factorization corresponds to the inner product in feature space φ(xi)\n>φ(xj) of the original points xi, xj . It is noted in the literature that the Gaussian kernel corresponds to an infinite dimensional feature space [27]. Since we work with symmetric, positive definite matri-\nces, we can calculate a Cholesky decomposition. However, the dual representation has the same size as the original matrix and therefore yields no improvement.\nAlgorithm 2 Efficient approximation of DPP sampling\nRequire: Point set X, subset cardinality k, nearest neighbors m, update function f\n1: Initialize D = 1n 2: for 1 to k do 3: Select i ∈ 1 . . . n with probability p(i) ∝ Di 4: J ← J ∪ i 5: Calculate ∆j = ‖xi − xj‖, ∀j ∈ 1 . . . n 6: Set m nearest neighbors as neighborhood Ni\nbased on {∆j}j=1...n 7: Dj ← Dj · f(∆j), ∀j ∈ Ni 8: Optional: Calculate covariance Ci in local\nneighborhood Ni around xi 9: end for\n10: return J and optionally {Ci}i∈J\nTo cope with the high computational costs of exact DPP sampling, we present an efficient approximation in Algorithm 2. The computational complexity is O(ndk). Vector D ∈ Rn models the probabilities for the selection of points as does ‖Bi‖2 in the original DPP sampling algorithm. The algorithm proceeds by sampling k points. Note that the cardinality of the subset cannot be set in the original DPP sampling algorithm, which led to the introduction of k-DPPs [19]. At each iteration we select one point xi with probability p(i) ∝ Di. Next we calculate distances {∆j}j=1...n of the selected point xi to all points in X. Based on these distances we identify a local neighborhood Ni of m nearest neighbors around the selected point xi. The update of the probabilities D is restricted to the neighborhood Ni, which proves advantageous for sampling on manifolds. In contrast, Algorithm 1 updates probabilities for all points. If we are interested in achiev-\ning a similar behavior to Algorithm 1, the local neighborhood should include all points. The update function f takes distances ∆ as input, where we consider f(∆) = sin2(∆/τ) and f(∆) = (1 − exp(−∆2/2σ2)), as motivated below. In subsequent iterations of the algorithm, points close xi will be selected with lower probability.\nWe initialize the vector D = 1n, since it was noted in [18] that the squared norm of the vectors ‖Bi‖2 gives rise initially to a fairly uniform distribution because no points have yet been selected. For the update step, Proposition 1 implies that the update of the probabilities for selecting a point changes with sin2(θ). The angle θ = ∠(Bi, Bj) correlates strongly with the distance ‖Bi−Bj‖, since ‖Bj‖ and ‖Bi‖ are initially the same. The selection of the eigenvectors in Algorithm 1 will most likely choose the ones with the largest eigenvalues. We can therefore draw the analogy to multidimensional scaling (MDS) [35] with a Gaussian kernel, where MDS selects the top eigenvectors. Consequently, vectors Bi correspond to low-dimensional embeddings produced by multidimensional scaling of original points xi. The characteristic property of MDS is to preserve pairwise distances between the original space and the embedding space, permitting the approximation ‖Bi − Bj‖ ≈ ‖xi − xj‖. This allows us to approximate the update dependent on the angle θ by the distance of points in the original space, sin2(θ) ≈ sin2(‖xi − xj‖/τ). The scaling factor τ ensures that values are in the range [−π/2;π/2]. This update is actually very similar to the Welsch function (1 − exp(−‖xi − xj‖2/2σ2)), which is directly related to the weights in the kernel matrix and is commonly used in machine learning. We illustrate the similarity of both functions in Fig. 2 and focus on the Welsch function in our experiments. For subsequent iterations of the algorithm, the assumption of a similar norm of all vectors Bi is violated, because the projection\non the orthogonal space changes their lengths. Note, however, that this change is locally restricted around the currently selected point. Since this region is less likely to be sampled in the subsequent iterations, the assumption still holds for parts of the space that contain most probability.\nRemark: The proposed algorithm bears similarities to K-means++ [2], which replaces the initialization through uniform sampling of K-means by a new seeding algorithm. K-means++ seeding is a heuristic that samples points based on the minimal distance to previously selected landmarks. Initially, when only one landmark is selected, our proposed algorithm has a nearly identical update rule for a maximal neighborhood Ni. In later iterations, the algorithms differ because K-means++ bases the selection only on the distance to the nearest landmark, while all landmarks influence the probability space in our algorithm. Consequently, our approach potentially yields subsets with higher diversity, as illustrated in the Fig. 3."

      "heading" : "3.3 Robust Landmark-based Graph Construction",
      "text" : "After selecting the landmarks, the next step in the spectral analysis consists of building a graph that approximates the manifold. Common techniques for the graph construction include selection of nearest neighbors or ε-balls around each node. Both approaches require the setting of a parameter, either the number of neighbors or the size of the ball, which is crucial for the performance. Setting the parameter too low leads to a large number of disconnected components, while for many applications one is interested in having all points connected to obtain a consistent embedding\nof all points. Choosing too high values of the parameters leads to short cuts, yielding a bad approximation of the manifold. The appropriate selection of the parameters is more challenging on sparsely sampled manifolds. This is problematic for the subset selection with consecutive Nyström reconstruction because we dramatically reduce the sampling rate to limit computational complexity.\nTo address this issue, we propose a new technique for graph construction that takes the initial distribution of the points into account. For each landmark xi, we estimate the covariance matrix Ci around this point from its nearest neighbors Ni, as indicated as optional step in Algorithm 2. This corresponds to multivariate Gaussian distributions G(xi, Ci) centered at the landmark. A commonly used distance to compare distributions is the Bhattacharyya distance, which in case of Gaussian distributions corresponds to\nB(Gi,Gj) = 1\n8 (xi−xj)>C−1(xi−xj)+\n1 2 ln ( |C|√ |Ci||Cj | ) ,\n(7)\nwith C = Ci+Cj\n2 . This distance is less likely to produce short cuts across the manifold because points that follow the local geometry appear much closer than points that are off the geometry. Consequently, we replace the Euclidean distance for neighborhood selection in manifold learning with the Bhattacharyya distance, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4. Space requirements of this step are O(d2k). An alternative for limited space and large d is to only use the diagonal entries of the covariance matrix, requiring O(dk). We summarize all steps of the proposed scalable manifold learning in Algorithm 3.\nAlgorithm 3 Summary of scalable manifold learning\n1: Select landmarks with approximate DPP sampling (Algorithm 2) 2: Construct neighborhood graph on landmarks with Bhattacharyya distance (Equ. 7) 3: Calculate low-dimensional embedding based on neighborhood graph 4: Embed non-landmark points by performing outof-sample extension with Nyström method"

      "text" : "In our first experiment, we show that the proposed efficient DPP sampling algorithm is well suited for subset selection on non-Euclidean spaces. The benefit for this scenario is that we can restrict the update of the sampling probability D to a local neighborhood Ni around\nthe current point xi. This is in line with the motivation of many manifold learning algorithms, assuming that the space behaves locally like a Euclidean space. In our experiment, we set the local neighborhoodNi to be the 20 nearest neighbors around the selected point xi. The sampling result is shown in Fig. 1(d). We obtain a point set with high diversity, covering the entire manifold. This illustrates that the proposed algorithm preserves the DPP characteristic on complex geometries and is therefore appropriate for subset selection in the context of non-linear dimensionality reduction.\nIn our second experiment, we quantify the reconstruction error for matrix completion as formulated in Equ. (1). We compare the efficient DPP sampling result with uniform sampling [36] and K-means clustering with uniform seeding [37], which performed best in several studies including a recent one [20]. Moreover, we compare to selecting the subset with the K-means++ seeding and the K-means++ algorithm, which we have not yet seen for landmark selection. We construct a Gaussian kernel matrix from 1,000 points on a Swiss roll (Fig. 1) and on a fish bowl (Fig. 5). The fish bowl dataset is a punctured sphere proposed in [26], which is sparsely sampled at the bottom and densely at the top, as shown in the supplementary material. We select subsets varying in size between 25 and 100 and set the parameters σ = 1 and m = 30 for the Swiss roll and σ = 1 and m = 150 for the fish bowl. Note that a further improvement can be achieved by adapting these parameters to the size of\nthe subset. For smaller subsets, larger σ and m lead to improvements. We show the average reconstruction error for the different methods and datasets in Table 1, calculated over 50 different runs. Generally, the performance of uniform sampling is worst. The K-means++ seeding yields better results. K-means improves the results on both initializations, where K-means++ benefits from the better seeding. The diverse set of landmarks selected with efficient DPP sampling leads to the lowest average reconstruction errors for almost all settings.\nIn our third experiment, we perform manifold learning with Laplacian eigenmaps on a point set consisting of 10 million points lying on a Swiss roll. The dataset is too large to apply manifold learning directly. We select 2,500 landmark points with the efficient DPP sampling algorithm and estimate the local covariance matrices, which we feed into the manifold learning al-\ngorithm. We compare the the graph construction with Euclidean and Bhattacharyya neighborhood selection. The graph construction yields a weight matrix W and the corresponding degree matrix Dj,j = ∑ iWi,j . The weight matrix W is a sparse version of the kernel matrixKJ×J , where the sparsity is controlled by the number of nearest neighbors in the graph. The generalized eigenvalue problem solved in Laplacian eigenmaps is\n(D −W )φj = λjDφj , (8)\nwith eigenvalues λj and eigenvectors φj . The l eigenvectors corresponding to the l smallest non-zero eigenvalues Λj,j = λj , j = 1, . . . l constitute the embedding in l-dimensional space, ΦJ = [φ1, . . . , φl]. Fig. 6 shows the low-dimensional embedding in 2D for Euclidean (first row) and Bhattacharyya neighborhood selection (second row). We vary the number of nearest neighbors in the graph from 25 to 500. The results show that the Bhattacharyya based neighborhood selection is much more robust with respect to the number of neighbors. Moreover, we notice that for Euclidean neighborhood selection the points seem to cluster along stripes. While we observe this effect also on the Bhattacharyya based embeddings, it is much less pronounced."

Consequently, we select landmarks with the discussed method, perform manifold learning on the landmarks with the Bhattacharyya distance, and use the Nyström method to\nembed the entire point set. We only consider the diagonal entries of the covariance matrices due to space limitations.

A common strategy to overcome this problem is to perform dimensionality reduction on selected landmarks and to successively embed the entire dataset with the Nyström method. The two main challenges that arise are: (i) the landmarks selected in non-Euclidean geometries must result in a low reconstruction error, (ii) the graph constructed from sparsely sampled landmarks must approximate the manifold well. We propose the sampling of landmarks from determinantal distributions on non-Euclidean spaces. Since current determinantal sampling algorithms have the same complexity as those for manifold learning, we present an efficient approximation running in linear time. Further, we recover the local geometry after the sparsification by assigning each landmark a local covariance matrix, estimated from the original point set. The resulting neighborhood selection based on the Bhattacharyya distance improves the embedding of sparsely sampled manifolds. Our experiments show a significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art landmark selection techniques.",
