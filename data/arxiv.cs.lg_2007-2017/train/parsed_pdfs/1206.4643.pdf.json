      "text" : "Markov decision processes (MDPs) are widely used tools to model sequential decision making in stochastic dynamic environments (e.g., Puterman, 1994; Sutton & Barto, 1998). Typically, the parameters of these models (reward and transition probability) are estimated from finite and sometimes noisy data, so they often deviate from their true value. Such deviation, termed “parameter uncertainty,” can cause the performance of the “optimal” policies to degrade significantly, as demonstrated in Mannor et al. (2007).\nMany efforts have been made to alleviate the effect of parameter uncertainty in MDPs (e.g., Nilim & El Ghaoui, 2005; Iyengar, 2005; Givan et al., 2000; Ep-\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nstein & Schneider, 2007; Bagnell et al., 2001). Inspired by the so-called “robust optimization” framework (Ben-Tal & Nemirovski, 1998; Bertsimas & Sim, 2004; Ben-Tal et al., 2009), the common approach regards the MDP’s uncertain parameters r and p as fixed but unknown elements of a known set U , often termed as the uncertainty set, and ranks solutions based on their performance under (respective) worst parameter realization.\nPrevious study in robust MDPs typically assumes that there exists no coupling between uncertain parameters of different states. That is, U = ∏ s∈S Us, where Us is the uncertainty set for (ps, rs), the transition probabilities and rewards for each state. Such an assumption is restrictive, and can often lead to conservative solutions as it essentially assumes that all parameters take worst possible realization simultaneously – an event that rarely happens in practice.\nIn this paper we propose and analyze a robust MDP approach that allows coupled uncertainty to mitigate conservativeness of the uncoupled uncertainty model. Specifically, we consider a setup which we term LDST after famous proverb “Lightning Does not Strike Twice:” while each parameter may be any element of the uncertainty set, the total number of states whose parameters deviate from their nominal value is bounded. The motivation is intuitive: suppose the parameter of each state deviates with a small probability, and all states are independent, then the total number of states with deviated parameters will be small. Hence, protection against the scenario that only a limited number of states deviate from their nominal parameter is sufficient to ensure that the solution is very likely to be robust to the real parameters.\nThe LDST approach is conceptually intuitive and sim-\nple, yet with added modeling power. Indeed, it is backed by probabilistic guarantees that hold under reasonable conditions. While the LDST approach provides a flexible way to control the conservativeness of robust MDPs, it remains computationally friendly: it is tractable even when both reward parameters and transition probabilities are uncertain, for one of the two setups which we will consider. For the other one that is computationally more challenging, it is tractable in the special case where only the reward parameters are uncertain.\nOne advantage of the LDST approach is that it requires no distribution information. This is in sharp contrast to some other variants of MDP methods also aiming to mitigate conservativeness, including Bayesian reinforcement learning (Strens, 2000; Poupart, 2010), chance constrained MDP (Delage & Mannor, 2010), and distributionally robust MDP (Xu & Mannor, 2010), all assuming a-priori information on the distribution of the system parameters.\nIn Section 2 we give background on MDPs and define the LDST formulation. In Section 3 we define the non-adaptive model and prove that it is computationally hard in the general case, but tractable if only the rewards are subject to deviations. In Section 4 we define the adaptive model and give tractable algorithms for solving both finite and infinite-horizon problems. In Section 5 we define the concept of fractional deviation and prove that the adaptive model is solvable also when fractional deviations are considered. Simulation of the adaptive model is demonstrated in Section 6 and a conclusion is given in Section 7."

      "heading" : "2. Preliminaries",
      "text" : "In this section we briefly explain our notations, some preliminaries about MDP, and the setups that we investigate. Following standard notations from Puterman (1994), we define a Markov decision process as a 6-tuple < T, γ,S,A, p, r >: here T , possibly infinite, is the decision horizon; γ ∈ (0, 1] is the discount factor, and can be 1 only when T <∞. The state space S and the action space A are both finite. In state s ∈ S, the decision maker can pick an action a ∈ A, and obtains a reward of r(s, a), and the next state will be s′ ∈ S with a probability p(s′|s, a). We use a subscript s to denote the parameter for state s. For example, rs is the reward vector for different actions in state s. We assume that the initial state is distributed according to α(·), i.e., the initial state is s with probability α(s). The sets of all history-dependent randomized strategies, all Markovian randomized strategies, and all Markovian deterministic strategies are denoted by ΠHR, ΠMR and\nΠMD, respectively. The decision goal is to maximize the performance X(π, p, r) , Eπ{ ∑T t=1 γ\nt−1r(st, at)} , i.e., the expected accumulative reward, under parameter p and r.\nAn uncertain MDP (uMDP) is defined as a tuple < T, γ,S,A, p0, r0,U , D >. In contrast to standard MDP, the true parameters ptrue and rtrue are unknown. Instead, for each state s, we know p0s and r 0 s termed nominal parameters hereafter, which are essentially point estimations of the parameters ps and rs, as well as an uncertainty set Us such that (ps, rs) ∈ Us. As standard in robust optimization and robust MDPs, we assume that the nominal parameters p0s and r 0 s belong to the uncertainty set Us, and the uncertainty sets {Us}s∈S are convex. As discussed above, previous work in robust MDP all focused on the case that parameter realization is uncoupled, i.e., (p, r) can take any value in U , ∏ s Us. In this paper we add the possibility of coupling between uncertainties to avoid being overly conservative. Following the proverb “lightning does not strike twice,” we consider uncertainty models that do not allow disaster to happen too frequently. In particular, besides the constraint that the parameters belong to respective uncertainty sets, we further require that the number of states whose parameters deviate from their nominal values is bounded by the given threshold D. An illustration of different effective uncertainty sets the model can produce is given in Figure 1 for three states, where it can be seen that\nthe model spans both the model oblivious to uncertainty, and the conservative model of uncoupled uncertainty. We will later demonstrate that the values of D in-between these extremes are both advantageous, and tractable.\nIntuitively, LDST can be thought of as a two-player zero-sum game, where the decision maker chooses a policy, and an adversarial Nature picks an admissible parameter realization attempting to minimize the reward of the decision maker. Two models are possible, leading to two forms that we will investigate in the sequel. In the first model, termed non-adaptive model, depending on the control policy, Nature chooses the parameter realization of all states once and fixed thereafter, thus leading to a single stage game. In the second model, both players adapt their actions to the trajectory of the MDP, leading to a sequential game. To illustrate the difference, consider the following example: suppose at state s0, taking an action a will lead the system to either state s1 or state s2, both with positive probabilities, and that only the parameter of one state is allowed to deviate. In the adaptive uncertainty model the following deviation is allowed: deviate s1 if the system reaches s1, and deviate s2 if the system reaches s2. In contrast, in the non-adaptive model the state whose parameters deviate must be fixed, and can not depend on whether the system reaches s1 or s2."

      "heading" : "3. Non-Adaptive Uncertainty Model",
      "text" : "In this section, we focus on the non-adaptive case. As mentioned above, the uncertain parameters, while unknown, are fixed a priori and do not depend on the trajectory of the MDP. Similarly, the decision maker has to fix a strategy and can not adapt to the realization of the parameters. Equivalently, this means that the decision maker does not observe whether or when the parameters deviate.\nOur goal is to find a strategy that performs best under the worst admissible parameter realization. That is, to solve the following problem:\nmax π∈ΠHR min (p,r)∈UD X(π, p, r) (1)\nwhere: UD , { (p, r) ∈ U ∣∣∣∣∣∑ s∈S 1(ps,rs)6=(p0s,r0s) ≤ D } .\nTo put it in words, the set of admissible parameters UD is defined as follows: the parameters of no more than D states can deviate from their nominal values, and the deviated parameters belong to their respective uncertainty set Us.\nThe main motivation of this formulation is that often\nin practice, the correlation between the parameters of different states is weak, or even completely independent. In such a case, protection against the scenario that only a limited number of states deviate from their nominal parameter is sufficient to ensure that the solution is very likely to be robust to the real parameters. To illustrate this intuition, we have the following theorem which considers a generative deviation model where the parameters of different states are independent. The proof is deferred to Appendix A.\nTheorem 1. Suppose the parameters of different states deviate independently, with a probability αs for s ∈ S. Then with probability at least 1 − δ we have (p, r) ∈ UD′ , where D′ , ∑ s∈S αs +\n1 3 log(1/δ)\n( 1 + √ 1 + 18 ∑ s∈S αs\nlog(1/δ)\n) ."

      "heading" : "4. Adaptive Uncertainty Model",
      "text" : "This section is devoted to the adaptive case, i.e., the parameter realization – in particular the choice of deviating states – depends on the history trajectory of the MDP. Moreover, the decision maker observes parameter deviation retrospectively. That is, in each decision stage the decision maker chooses an action, after which the true parameters are realized and observed by the decision maker. Hence the decision maker is aware of the occurrence of parameter deviation, and his strategy is allowed to depend on such information.\nIn practice, there are two cases where the agent can confidently determines a deviation. The first case is where the parameter deviation is accompanied by external signals (e.g., lighting). For example, consider a problem of determining the route for a helicopter, the deviation is when there is a storm, and it is reasonable to assume that the agent can observe the storm if it really happens. A similar example is portfolio optimization where the parameter deviation is due to market crash or company bankrupcy, which certainly can be observed. The second case, where there is no external signal, is the case where the support of the nominal parameter and deviation barely intersects (in the probabilistic sense). Take the simulation in Section 6 as an example, although under the nominal parameter, it is possible that the number of customers come is large, the probability is very small. Recurrence of such events is more unlikely. Hence, the agent can count each of these events as one parameter deviation, and allow the Nature one or two extra chances of parameter deviation. Solving the resulting adaptive case would yield a solution that with overwhelming probabilities is robust to fixed number of parameter deviation, yet not overly conservative. Notice that a special example of the second case is when the supports are disjoint."

      "text" : "Mathematically, the finite-horizon adaptive case can be formulated as the following decision problem 1,\nmax a1∈A min (p1,r1)∈Us1 max a2∈A min (p2,r2)∈Us2\n· · · (3)\nmax aT∈A min (pT ,rT )∈UsT\nE { T∑ t=1 rt(st, at) } ;\nSubject to: T∑ t=1 1(pt,rt)6=(p0t ,r0t ) ≤ D.\nHere, st is the randomized state at decision epoch t. Hence, for all s, s′ ∈ S we have Pr(st+1 = s′|st = s, at) = pt(s\n′|s, at). We remark that in the adaptive case we require that the number of decision stages (as opposed to states) where the parameter deviates is bounded by D. Hence, the parameters of a state are allowed to take different values for multiple visits. Similarly to Theorem 1, Formulation (3) is justified by the following probabilistic guarantee. The proof is almost identical to that of Theorem 1, and omitted.\nTheorem 4. Suppose the parameters of different stages deviate independently, with a probability αt for t = 1, · · · , T . Then with probability at least 1 − δ we have that the total number of deviations∑T t=1 1(pt,rt)6=(p0t ,r0t ) is upper bounded by ∑T t=1 αt +\n1 3 log(1/δ)\n( 1 + √ 1 + 18 ∑T t=1 αt\nlog(1/δ)\n) .\nThe next theorem, which is the main result of this subsection, asserts that in sharp contrast to the nonadaptive case, the adaptive-case can be solved via backward induction.\nTheorem 5. Let vT+1(s, d) = 0 for all s ∈ S and d ∈ [0 : D], and define for t = 1, · · · , T ,\nvt(s, d) , max a∈A { min [ qt(s, d, a, p 0 s, r 0 s), min (p,r)∈Us qt(s, d− 1, a, p, r) ]} , if d ≥ 1;\nmax a∈A\nqt(s, d, a, p 0 s, r 0 s), if d = 0;\na∗t (s, d) , arg max a∈A { min [ qt(s, d, a, p 0 s, r 0 s), min (p,r)∈Us qt(s, d− 1, a, p, r) ]} , if d ≥ 1;\narg max a∈A\nqt(s, d, a, p 0 s, r 0 s), if d = 0;\n1In a slight abuse of notation we write (pt, rt) instead of (pst , rst).\nwhere qt(s, d, a, p, r) , ∑ s′ p(s\n′|s, a)vt+1(s′, d) + r(s, a). Then the optimal strategy to Problem 3 is to take a∗t (s, d) at stage t, state s, where stage-parameters are allowed to deviate at most d times from this stage on.\nBefore proving the theorem, we first explain our intuition: we can re-formulate Problem 3 as a sequential game of perfect information on an augmented statespace. More precisely, Problem 3 can be regarded as a sequential game, where there are two players, namely the decision maker who attempts to maximize the total expected reward by choosing actions sequentially, and Nature who aims to minimize the total expected reward by choosing parameter-realization. Thus, we can expand the decision horizon into 2T where the decision maker makes move in each odd decision stage, and Nature makes move in each even decision stage. Furthermore, both the decision maker and Nature are aware of the number of “deviated visits” so far, which affect their optimal strategies. Hence, we need to augment the state-space with this information. Thus, we construct the following game.\nConsider the following augmented state space, where we have two types of states: the decision maker states and the Nature states. The set of decision maker states is given by\nSD = S × [0 : D],\nand the set of Nature states is given by\nSN = S × [0 : D]×A.\nThe entire (augmented) state space is thus S = SD ⋃ SN .\nA zero-sum stochastic game with time horizon 2T between two players on S is constructed as follows. In each decision epoch 2t−1 for t = 1, · · · , T , the system state belongs to SD and only the decision maker can choose an action a ∈ A. Let the state be (s, d) where s ∈ S and d ∈ [0 : D], and suppose the decision maker takes action a ∈ A, then the next state will be (s, d, a), with both players get zero-reward.\nIn each decision epoch 2t for t = 1, · · · , T , the system state belongs to SN and only Nature can choose an action. The action set for Nature is the following: if d ≥ 1, Nature can either pick the nominal parameter (p0s, r 0 s), in which case the next state will be (s\n′, d) where s′ is a random variable following the probability distribution p0(s′|s, a), and the decision maker gets a reward r0(s, a), which Nature simultaneously loses; alternatively, Nature can pick a parameter (p′, r′) ∈ Us, in which case the next state will be (s′, d−1) where s′\nis a random variable following the probability distribution p′(s′|s, a), and the decision maker gets a reward r′(s, a), which Nature, again, simultaneously loses. If d = 0, Nature can only pick the nominal parameter (p0s, r 0 s). An example of this construction is given graphically in Figure 2. It is easy to see that solving Problem 3 is equivalent to solving the aforementioned stochastic game. This leads to the proof of Theorem 5.\nProof of Theorem 5. We prove the theorem by investigating the aforementioned stochastic game, and showing that a Nash equilibrium exists for the stochastic game, where the decision maker’s move is a∗t (s, d). Since the solution to the stochastic game and the solution to Problem 3 coincide (Filar & Vrieze, 1996), the theorem thus follows.\nWe now construct the Nash equilibrium. Let the decision maker take the strategy a∗t (s, d) at state (s, d) ∈ SD in decision epoch 2t− 1. Let Nature take the following action at state (s, d, a) ∈ SN in decision epoch 2t: do not deviate the parameters (i.e, pick parameter (p0s, r 0 s)) if either d = 0, or qt(s, d, a, p 0 s, r 0 s) ≤ min(p,r)∈Us qt(s, d− 1, a, p, r); otherwise, pick parameters arg min(p,r)∈Us qt(s, d− 1, a, p, r).\nObserve that if Nature fixes this strategy, the stochastic game reduces to a standard MDP for the decision maker to maximize his total reward, in which case his optimal strategy is take a∗t (s, d) at each (s, d) ∈ SD at the decision epoch 2t − 1. On the other hand, if the decision maker fixes his strategy, then for Nature to minimize the total-reward for the decision maker, it is easy to see that the aforementioned strategy is optimal. Thus, the aforementioned pair of strategies is a Nash equilibrium, which implies the theorem.\nAlgorithm 1 illustrates how Theorem 5 can be used to compute optimal policy for the non-adaptive model in the LDST setup. Its time-complexity is\nO ( TD|S||A| ( |S| + M )) where M is defined as the\nmaximal computational effort in performing a single minimization of qt(s, d, a, p, r) in (p, r) ∈ Us for any s ∈ S, t ∈ [1 : T ]."

On the other hand, coupled uncertainty in MDPs is in general computationally difficult. Therefore, it is important to identify sub-classes of coupled uncertainty that are flexible enough to overcome conservativeness, yet remains computationally tractable. This paper is the first of such attempts, which we hope will facilitate the applicability of robust MDPs."

Previous studies all restrict to the case that uncertainties among different states are uncoupled, which leads to conservative solutions. In contrast, we introduce an intuitive concept, termed “Lightning Does not Strike Twice,” to model coupled uncertain parameters. Specifically, we require that the system can deviate from its nominal parameters only a bounded number of times. We give probabilistic guarantees indicating that this model represents real life situations and devise tractable algorithms for computing optimal control policies.",
