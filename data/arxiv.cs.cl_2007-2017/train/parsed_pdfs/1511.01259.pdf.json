      "text" : "In large organizations, such as multinational corporations, universities, and even large research centers, it can be difficult to know who is an expert about a given subject. A common response to this problem is to create an ontology of expertise and manually or automatically assign experts labels from this ontology. Beyond the cost or effort needed to produce the ontology, this solution creates an additional problem. Once such a knowledge base of experts exists, the searcher still has to internalize the ontology labels and their meaning in order to find the expert. The difficulty the user faces explains why some expert knowledge bases are found useful for one division in a large organization but be useless for another division which does not share the same terminology or perspective (Hahn & Subrami, 2000). We propose a method for finding experts that hides the pivot ontology from the user, and allows the searcher to browse Wikipedia, a resource that he or she is probably familiar with, in order to find his or her local expert."

      "heading" : "2. Solution",
      "text" : "Our solution involves mapping experts from a givein organization onto a domain ontology for their expertise, and then mapping Wikipedia articles into the same domain ontology. To find an expert on a certain field, the user searches the subject of interest in Wikipedia. A tab added to the Wikipedia page can be clicked to reveal a list of experts concerning the some topic mentioned in the page."

      "heading" : "2.1 Example",
      "text" : "Before explaining the mechanisms and language resources involved, let us see an example. In this example, our local\nexperts are any of the research teams in the French nation-wide computer science public research institute, Inria1. The Inria Institute employs 3600 scientists spread over 200 research teams, each specializing in some branch of computer science and mathematics. In our example, finding an expert will mean finding a team who is competent to answer questions about a given subject.\nIn our solution, when someone is looking for an expert in a given subject inside the Inria institute, an additional tab appears to the user on the Wikipedia interface2. In Figure 1, 1https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inria 2 This tab appears when the user is logged in, and has the\nresource module for expert finding, this tab appears while the user browses http://en.wikipedia.org. Wiki resource\n2 This tab appears when the user is logged in, and has the resource module for expert finding, this tab appears while\nthe tab appears with the label “Inria” to the right of the “Article” and “Talk” tabs above the article title. Clicking on the tab expands a box listing the ACM subjects found in the articles and the Inria research teams treating those subjects.\nBoth subjects and teams (see Figure 2) are linked to pages outside Wikipedia, so that Wikipedia has become a search engine with the user browsing towards their query (here “Autoregressive Models”, with the pull down expert box corresponding the search engine results page, leading to outside content. The user can find the Wikipedia article closest to his or her concern, and use the expert finding tab to find local experts who know about the subjects on the page. This seems to us a natural and intuitive method for finding experts that obviates the need for learning the ontology by which the experts are connected to the topic page. Even if the connecting ontology terms are explicitly displayed in the results, the user need not ever use them in an explicit query."

      "heading" : "2.2 Underlying Language Resources",
      "text" : "The connections between Wikipedia content and local experts pass through a shared pivot ontology. Both Wikipedia page content and the expert profiles are mapped into the same ontology categories which provide a pivot, or link between them. In our implemented example, we used the ACM 2012 Classification schema3 as the shared ontological space. Here is an entry in this ontology: <skos:Concept rdf:about=\"#10010296\" xml:lang=\"en\">\nthe user browses http://en.wikipedia.org. Wiki resource modules are additions that anyone can develop and activate. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ResourceLoader/Developin g_with_ResourceLoader explains them further.\n3 http://www.acm.org/about/class/class/2012\n<skos:prefLabel xml:lang=\"en\">Gaussian processes</skos:prefLabel> <skos:altLabel xml:lang=\"en\">gaussian process</skos:altLabel> <skos:inScheme rdf:resource=\"http://totem.semedica.com/taxonomy/The ACM Computing Classification System (CCS)\"/> <skos:broader rdf:resource=\"#10010075\"/> This entry gives a synonym for “Gaussian processes”, an internal ACM code for this concept (10010296), and a link to a hypernym (10010075), “Theory of computation”. This SKOS taxonomy, augmented by any Wikipedia redirects as additional synonyms, was converted into a natural language processing program that associates the internal ACM code to raw English text (delivered as resource with this paper).\nWikipedia text was extracted from a recent dump.4 The text was extracted from each article, tokenized, lowercased, and transformed into sentences. Each sentence was passed through NLP program associating ACM codes to each article. Any ACM concept appearing in more than 10,000 articles was eliminated as too general5.\nThe source for expert profiles in our example were the public web pages of Inria teams 2014 activity reports6. Each page was downloaded, boilerplate removed, text extracted, tokenized lowercased and split into sentences, as with the Wikipedia text.\nIn all 3123 Inria web pages were associated 129,499 Wikipedia articles were tagged one or more of with 1049 different ACM codes."

      "heading" : "2.3 Variations",
      "text" : "Instead of using annual reports to create expert profiles, one could instead use the publications of researchers from a given team or research center.\nIn place the ACM hierarchy, one could extract a taxonomy of Wikipedia categories and subcategories7.\nFor example, one could use MeSH as the anchor ontology and publications of doctors at local hospital to transform Wikipedia into a search engine of specialists for medical problems."

West et al. (2012) tried to characterize what makes Wikipedia experts. Our approach allows us to connect to people who do not appear in Wikipedia either as subjects or editors."

      "heading" : "4. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We have presented a system for finding local experts using Wikipedia. It is constructed using a pivot ontology, indexing Wikipedia pages, and some textual representation of the experts (web pages, reports, or publications). The pivot ontology must be represented as a natural language processing resource, i.e. a resource that a program can apply to natural language text, that is applied to both Wikipedia pages and the textual representation of experts, pushing them into the same space. Once this mapping is done, a Wikimedia resource loader dynamically makes the connection once the user click 4 http://dumps.wikimedia.org/biwiki/latest 5 For example, ACM has a concept ‘Women’ under ‘Gender’.\n‘Women’ was eliminated while ‘Gender’ was retained. 6 https://raweb.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2014/index.html 7 Starting from, for example,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Computer_science\non the expert fining tab, so neither the text of Wikipedia, not the expert profile text need be altered. An additional advantage of this system is that the user seeking an expert does not interact explicitly with the pivot ontology, but only with Wikipedia and the original textual representations of the experts. As the general public becomes more used to using Wikipedia to find information, they are able to find the best page that characterizes their need. And Wikipedia is transformed into a local expert search engine."

Even when a taxonomy of subject expertise exists, and is associated with a group of experts, it can be hard to exploit by users who have not internalized the taxonomy. Here we present a method for both attaching experts to a domain ontology, and hiding this fact from the end user looking for an expert. By linking Wikipedia to this same pivot ontology, we describe how a user can browse Wikipedia, as they normally do to search for information, and use this browsing behavior to find experts. Experts are characterized by their textual productions (webpages, publications, reports), and these textual productions are attached to concepts in the pivot ontology. When the user finds the Wikipedia page characterizing their need, a list of experts is displayed. In this way we transform Wikipedia into a search engine for experts.",
