      "text" : "Automatically generating captions of an image is a task very close to the heart of scene understanding — one of the primary goals of computer vision. Not only must caption generation models be powerful enough to solve the computer vision challenges of determining which objects are in an image, but they must also be capable of capturing and expressing their relationships in a natural language. For this reason, caption generation has long been viewed as a difficult problem. It is a very important challenge for machine learning algorithms, as it amounts to mimicking the remarkable human ability to compress huge amounts of salient visual infomation into descriptive language.\nDespite the challenging nature of this task, there has been a recent surge of research interest in attacking the image caption generation problem. Aided by advances in training neural networks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and large classification datasets (Russakovsky et al., 2014), recent work\nhas significantly improved the quality of caption generation using a combination of convolutional neural networks (convnets) to obtain vectorial representation of images and recurrent neural networks to decode those representations into natural language sentences (see Sec. 2).\nOne of the most curious facets of the human visual system is the presence of attention (Rensink, 2000; Corbetta & Shulman, 2002). Rather than compress an entire image into a static representation, attention allows for salient features to dynamically come to the forefront as needed. This is especially important when there is a lot of clutter in an image. Using representations (such as those from the top layer of a convnet) that distill information in image down to the most salient objects is one effective solution that has been widely adopted in previous work. Unfortunately, this has one potential drawback of losing information which could be useful for richer, more descriptive captions. Using more low-level representation can help preserve this information. However working with these features necessitates a powerful mechanism to steer the model to information important to the task at hand.\nIn this paper, we describe approaches to caption generation that attempt to incorporate a form of attention with\nar X\niv :1\n50 2.\n03 04\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n0 Fe\ntwo variants: a “hard” attention mechanism and a “soft” attention mechanism. We also show how one advantage of including attention is the ability to visualize what the model “sees”. Encouraged by recent advances in caption generation and inspired by recent success in employing attention in machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014) and object recognition (Ba et al., 2014; Mnih et al., 2014), we investigate models that can attend to salient part of an image while generating its caption.\nThe contributions of this paper are the following: • We introduce two attention-based image caption gen-\nerators under a common framework (Sec. 3.1): 1) a “soft” deterministic attention mechanism trainable by standard back-propagation methods and 2) a “hard” stochastic attention mechanism trainable by maximizing an approximate variational lower bound or equivalently by REINFORCE (Williams, 1992). • We show how we can gain insight and interpret the results of this framework by visualizing “where” and “what” the attention focused on. (see Sec. 5.4) • Finally, we quantitatively validate the usefulness of attention in caption generation with state of the art performance (Sec. 5.3) on three benchmark datasets: Flickr8k (Hodosh et al., 2013) , Flickr30k (Young et al., 2014) and the MS COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014)."

      "heading" : "2. Related Work",
      "text" : "In this section we provide relevant background on previous work on image caption generation and attention. Recently, several methods have been proposed for generating image descriptions. Many of these methods are based on recurrent neural networks and inspired by the successful use of sequence to sequence training with neural networks for machine translation (Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014). One major reason image caption generation is well suited to the encoder-decoder framework (Cho et al., 2014) of machine translation is because it is analogous to “translating” an image to a sentence.\nThe first approach to use neural networks for caption generation was Kiros et al. (2014a), who proposed a multimodal log-bilinear model that was biased by features from the image. This work was later followed by Kiros et al. (2014b) whose method was designed to explicitly allow a natural way of doing both ranking and generation. Mao et al. (2014) took a similar approach to generation but replaced a feed-forward neural language model with a recurrent one. Both Vinyals et al. (2014) and Donahue et al. (2014) use LSTM RNNs for their models. Unlike Kiros et al. (2014a) and Mao et al. (2014) whose models see the image at each time step of the output word sequence, Vinyals et al. (2014) only show the image to the RNN at the beginning. Along\nwith images, Donahue et al. (2014) also apply LSTMs to videos, allowing their model to generate video descriptions.\nAll of these works represent images as a single feature vector from the top layer of a pre-trained convolutional network. Karpathy & Li (2014) instead proposed to learn a joint embedding space for ranking and generation whose model learns to score sentence and image similarity as a function of R-CNN object detections with outputs of a bidirectional RNN. Fang et al. (2014) proposed a three-step pipeline for generation by incorporating object detections. Their model first learn detectors for several visual concepts based on a multi-instance learning framework. A language model trained on captions was then applied to the detector outputs, followed by rescoring from a joint image-text embedding space. Unlike these models, our proposed attention framework does not explicitly use object detectors but instead learns latent alignments from scratch. This allows our model to go beyond “objectness” and learn to attend to abstract concepts.\nPrior to the use of neural networks for generating captions, two main approaches were dominant. The first involved generating caption templates which were filled in based on the results of object detections and attribute discovery (Kulkarni et al. (2013), Li et al. (2011), Yang et al. (2011), Mitchell et al. (2012), Elliott & Keller (2013)). The second approach was based on first retrieving similar captioned images from a large database then modifying these retrieved captions to fit the query (Kuznetsova et al., 2012; 2014). These approaches typically involved an intermediate “generalization” step to remove the specifics of a caption that are only relevant to the retrieved image, such as the name of a city. Both of these approaches have since fallen out of favour to the now dominant neural network methods.\nThere has been a long line of previous work incorporating attention into neural networks for vision related tasks. Some that share the same spirit as our work include Larochelle & Hinton (2010); Denil et al. (2012); Tang et al. (2014). In particular however, our work directly extends the work of Bahdanau et al. (2014); Mnih et al. (2014); Ba et al. (2014)."

      "text" : "We use a long short-term memory (LSTM) network (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) that produces a caption by generating one word at every time step conditioned on a context vector, the previous hidden state and the previously generated words. Our implementation of LSTM\nclosely follows the one used in Zaremba et al. (2014) (see Fig. 4). Using Ts,t : Rs → Rt to denote a simple affine transformation with parameters that are learned,\n it ft ot gt  =  σ σ σ tanh TD+m+n,n Eyt−1ht−1 ẑt  (1) ct = ft ct−1 + it gt (2) ht = ot tanh(ct). (3)\nHere, it, ft, ct, ot, ht are the input, forget, memory, output and hidden state of the LSTM, respectively. The vector ẑ ∈ RD is the context vector, capturing the visual information associated with a particular input location, as explained below. E ∈ Rm×K is an embedding matrix. Let m and n denote the embedding and LSTM dimensionality respectively and σ and be the logistic sigmoid activation and element-wise multiplication respectively.\nIn simple terms, the context vector ẑt (equations (1)–(3)) is a dynamic representation of the relevant part of the image input at time t. We define a mechanism φ that computes ẑt from the annotation vectors ai, i = 1, . . . , L corresponding to the features extracted at different image locations. For each location i, the mechanism generates a positive weight αi which can be interpreted either as the probability that location i is the right place to focus for producing the next word (the “hard” but stochastic attention mechanism), or as the relative importance to give to location i in blending the ai’s together. The weight αi of each annotation vector ai is computed by an attention model fatt for which we use a multilayer perceptron conditioned on the previous hidden state ht−1. The soft version of this attention mechanism was introduced by Bahdanau et al. (2014). For emphasis, we note that the hidden state varies as the output RNN advances in its output sequence: “where” the network looks next depends on the sequence of words that has already been generated.\neti =fatt(ai,ht−1) (4) αti = exp(eti)∑L k=1 exp(etk) . (5)\nOnce the weights (which sum to one) are computed, the context vector ẑt is computed by\nẑt = φ ({ai} , {αi}) , (6)\nwhere φ is a function that returns a single vector given the set of annotation vectors and their corresponding weights. The details of φ function are discussed in Sec. 4.\nThe initial memory state and hidden state of the LSTM are predicted by an average of the annotation vectors fed\nthrough two separate MLPs (init,c and init,h):\nc0 = finit,c( 1\nL L∑ i ai)\nh0 = finit,h( 1\nL L∑ i ai)\nIn this work, we use a deep output layer (Pascanu et al., 2014) to compute the output word probability given the LSTM state, the context vector and the previous word:\np(yt|a,yt−11 ) ∝ exp(Lo(Eyt−1 + Lhht + Lz ẑt)) (7)\nWhere Lo ∈ RK×m, Lh ∈ Rm×n, Lz ∈ Rm×D, and E are learned parameters initialized randomly."

      "text" : "We represent the location variable st as where the model decides to focus attention when generating the tth word. st,i is an indicator one-hot variable which is set to 1 if the i-th location (out of L) is the one used to extract visual features. By treating the attention locations as intermediate latent variables, we can assign a multinoulli distribution parametrized by {αi}, and view ẑt as a random variable:\np(st,i = 1 | sj<t,a) = αt,i (8) ẑt = ∑ i st,iai. (9)\nWe define a new objective function Ls that is a variational lower bound on the marginal log-likelihood log p(y | a) of observing the sequence of words y given image features a. The learning algorithm for the parametersW of the models can be derived by directly optimizing Ls:\nLs = ∑ s p(s | a) log p(y | s,a)\n≤ log ∑ s p(s | a)p(y | s,a)\n= log p(y | a) (10)\n∂Ls ∂W = ∑ s p(s | a) [ ∂ log p(y | s,a) ∂W +\nlog p(y | s,a)∂ log p(s | a) ∂W\n] . (11)\nEquation 11 suggests a Monte Carlo based sampling approximation of the gradient with respect to the model parameters. This can be done by sampling the location st from a multinouilli distribution defined by Equation 8.\ns̃t ∼ MultinoulliL({αi})\n∂Ls ∂W ≈ 1 N N∑ n=1 [ ∂ log p(y | s̃n,a) ∂W +\nlog p(y | s̃n,a)∂ log p(s̃ n | a)\n∂W\n] (12)\nA moving average baseline is used to reduce the variance in the Monte Carlo estimator of the gradient, following Weaver & Tao (2001). Similar, but more complicated variance reduction techniques have previously been used by Mnih et al. (2014) and Ba et al. (2014). Upon seeing the kth mini-batch, the moving average baseline is estimated as an accumulated sum of the previous log likelihoods with exponential decay:\nbk = 0.9× bk−1 + 0.1× log p(y | s̃k,a)\nTo further reduce the estimator variance, an entropy term on the multinouilli distribution H[s] is added. Also, with probability 0.5 for a given image, we set the sampled attention location s̃ to its expected value α. Both techniques improve the robustness of the stochastic attention learning algorithm. The final learning rule for the model is then the\nfollowing:\n∂Ls ∂W ≈ 1 N N∑ n=1 [ ∂ log p(y | s̃n,a) ∂W +\nλr(log p(y | s̃n,a)− b) ∂ log p(s̃n | a)\n∂W + λe\n∂H[s̃n]\n∂W ] where, λr and λe are two hyper-parameters set by crossvalidation. As pointed out and used in Ba et al. (2014) and Mnih et al. (2014), this is formulation is equivalent to the REINFORCE learning rule (Williams, 1992), where the reward for the attention choosing a sequence of actions is a real value proportional to the log likelihood of the target sentence under the sampled attention trajectory.\nIn making a hard choice at every point, φ ({ai} , {αi}) from Equation 6 is a function that returns a sampled ai at every point in time based upon a multinouilli distribution parameterized by α."

(2014). This corresponds to feeding in a soft α\nweighted context into the system. The whole model is smooth and differentiable under the deterministic attention, so learning end-to-end is trivial by using standard backpropagation.\nLearning the deterministic attention can also be understood as approximately optimizing the marginal likelihood in Equation 10 under the attention location random variable st from Sec. 4.1. The hidden activation of LSTM ht is a linear projection of the stochastic context vector ẑt followed by tanh non-linearity. To the first order Taylor approximation, the expected value Ep(st|a)[ht] is equal to computing ht using a single forward prop with the expected context vector Ep(st|a)[ẑt]. Considering Eq. 7, let nt = Lo(Eyt−1+Lhht+Lz ẑt), nt,i denotes nt computed by setting the random variable ẑ value to ai. We define the normalized weighted geometric mean for the softmax kth word prediction:\nNWGM [p(yt = k | a)] = ∏ i exp(nt,k,i)\np(st,i=1|a)∑ j ∏ i exp(nt,j,i) p(st,i=1|a)\n= exp(Ep(st|a)[nt,k])∑ j exp(Ep(st|a)[nt,j ])\nThe equation above shows the normalized weighted geometric mean of the caption prediction can be approximated well by using the expected context vector, where E[nt] = Lo(Eyt−1 + LhE[ht] + LzE[ẑt]). It shows that the NWGM of a softmax unit is obtained by applying softmax to the expectations of the underlying linear projections. Also, from the results in (Baldi & Sadowski, 2014), NWGM [p(yt = k | a)] ≈ E[p(yt = k | a)] under softmax activation. That means the expectation of the outputs over all possible attention locations induced by random variable st is computed by simple feedforward propagation with expected context vector E[ẑt]. In other words, the deterministic attention model is an approximation to the marginal likelihood over the attention locations."

This can be interpreted as encouraging the model to pay equal attention to every part of the image over the course of generation. In our experiments, we observed that this penalty was important quantitatively to improving overall BLEU score and that qualitatively this leads to more rich and descriptive captions. In addition, the soft attention model predicts a gating scalar β from previous hidden state ht−1 at each time step t, such that, φ ({ai} , {αi}) = β ∑L i αiai, where βt = σ(fβ(ht−1)).

For the Flickr8k dataset, we found that RMSProp (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) worked best, while for Flickr30k/MS COCO dataset we used the recently proposed Adam algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) .\nTo create the annotations ai used by our decoder, we used the Oxford VGGnet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) pretrained on ImageNet without finetuning. In principle however, any encoding function could be used. In addition, with enough data, we could also train the encoder from scratch (or fine-tune) with the rest of the model. In our experiments we use the 14×14×512 feature map of the fourth convolutional layer before max pooling. This means our decoder operates on the flattened 196 × 512 (i.e L × D) encoding.\nAs our implementation requires time proportional to the length of the longest sentence per update, we found training on a random group of captions to be computationally wasteful. To mitigate this problem, in preprocessing we build a dictionary mapping the length of a sentence to the corresponding subset of captions. Then, during training we randomly sample a length and retrieve a mini-batch of size 64 of that length. We found that this greatly improved convergence speed with no noticeable diminishment in performance. On our largest dataset (MS COCO), our soft attention model took less than 3 days to train on an NVIDIA Titan Black GPU.\nIn addition to dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), the only other regularization strategy we used was early stopping on BLEU score. We observed a breakdown in correlation between the validation set log-likelihood and BLEU in the later stages of training during our experiments. Since BLEU is the most commonly reported metric, we used BLEU on our validation set for model selection.\nIn our experiments with soft attention, we also used Whetlab1 (Snoek et al., 2012; 2014) in our Flickr8k experiments. Some of the intuitions we gained from hyperparameter regions it explored were especially important in our Flickr30k and COCO experiments.\nWe make our code for these models based in Theano 1https://www.whetlab.com/\n(Bergstra et al., 2010) publicly available upon publication to encourage future research in this area."

In our reported results, we use the predefined splits of Flickr8k. However, one challenge for the Flickr30k and COCO datasets is the lack of standardized splits.

Other systems that have done this rely on object detection systems to produce candidate alignment targets (Karpathy & Li, 2014). Our approach is much more flexible, since the model can attend to “non object” salient regions.\nThe 19-layer OxfordNet uses stacks of 3x3 filters meaning the only time the feature maps decrease in size are due to the max pooling layers. The input image is resized so that the shortest side is 256 dimensional with preserved aspect ratio. The input to the convolutional network is the center cropped 224x224 image. Consequently, with 4 max pooling layers we get an output dimension of the top convolutional layer of 14x14. Thus in order to visualize the attention weights for the soft model, we simply upsample the weights by a factor of 24 = 16 and apply a Gaussian filter. We note that the receptive fields of each of the 14x14 units are highly overlapping.\nAs we can see in Figure 2 and 3, the model learns alignments that correspond very strongly with human intuition.
