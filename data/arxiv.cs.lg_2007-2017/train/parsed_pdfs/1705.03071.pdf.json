      "text" : "Central to any form of learning is an inductive bias that induces some sort of capacity control (i.e. restricts or encourages predictors to be “simple” in some way), which in turn allows for generalization. The success of learning then depends on how well the inductive bias captures reality (i.e. how expressive is the hypothesis class of “simple” predictors) relative to the capacity induced, as well as on the computational complexity of fitting a “simple” predictor to the training data.\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\nLet us consider learning with feed-forward networks from this perspective. If we search for the weights minimizing the training error, we are essentially considering the hypothesis class of predictors representable with different weight vectors, typically for some fixed architecture. Capacity is then controlled by the size (number of weights) of the network1. Our justification for using such networks is then that many interesting and realistic functions can be represented by not-too-large (and hence bounded capacity) feed-forward networks. Indeed, in many cases we can show how specific architectures can capture desired behaviors. More broadly, any O(T ) time computable function can be captured by an O(T 2) sized network, and so the expressive power of such networks is indeed great (Sipser, 2006, Theorem 9.25).\nAt the same time, we also know that learning even moderately sized networks is computationally intractable—not only is it NP-hard to minimize the empirical error, even with only three hidden units, but it is hard to learn small feed-forward networks using any learning method (subject to cryptographic assumptions). That is, even for binary classification using a network with a single hidden layer and a logarithmic (in the input size) number of hidden units, and even if we know the true targets are exactly captured by such a small network, there is likely no efficient algorithm that can ensure error better than 1/2 (Sherstov, 2006; Daniely et al., 2014)—not if the algorithm tries to fit such a network, not even if it tries to fit a much larger network, and in fact no matter how the algorithm represents predictors. And so, merely knowing that some not-too-large architecture is excellent in expressing reality does not explain why we are able to learn using it, nor using an even larger network. Why is it then that we succeed in learning using multilayer feed-forward networks? Can we identify a property that makes them possible to learn? An alternative inductive bias?\nIn section 2, we make our first steps at shedding light on this question by going back to our understanding of network size as the capacity control at play. Our main observation, based on empirical experimentation with single-hidden-layer networks of increasing size (increasing number of hidden units), is that size does not behave as a capacity control parameter, and in fact there must be some other, implicit, capacity control at play. We suggest that this hidden capacity control might be the real inductive bias when learning with deep networks.\nRevisiting the choice of gradient descent, we recall that optimization is inherently tied to a choice of geometry or measure of distance, norm or divergence. Gradient descent for example is tied to the `2 norm as it is the steepest descent with respect to `2 norm in the parameter space, while coordinate descent corresponds to steepest descent with respect to the `1 norm and exp-gradient (multiplicative weight) updates is tied to an entropic divergence. Moreover, at least when the objective function is convex, convergence behavior is tied to the corresponding norms or potentials. For example, with gradient descent, or SGD, convergence speeds depend on the `2 norm of the optimum. The norm or divergence can be viewed as a regularizer for the updates. There is therefore also a strong link between regularization for optimization and regularization for learning: optimization may provide implicit regularization in terms of its corresponding geometry, and for ideal optimization performance the optimization geometry should be aligned with inductive bias driving the learning (Srebro et al., 2011).\nIs the `2 geometry on the weights the appropriate geometry for the space of deep networks? Or can we suggest a geometry with more desirable properties that would enable faster optimization and\n1. The exact correspondence depends on the activation function—for hard thresholding activation the pseudodimension, and hence sample complexity, scales as O(S logS), where S is the number of weights in the network. With sigmoidal activation it is between Ω(S2) and O(S4) (Anthony and Bartlett, 1999).\nperhaps also better implicit regularization? As suggested above, this question is also linked to the choice of an appropriate regularizer for deep networks.\nFocusing on networks with RELU activations in this section, we observe that scaling down the incoming edges to a hidden unit and scaling up the outgoing edges by the same factor yields an equivalent network computing the same function. Since predictions are invariant to such rescalings, it is natural to seek a geometry, and corresponding optimization method, that is similarly invariant.\nWe consider here a geometry inspired by max-norm regularization (regularizing the maximum norm of incoming weights into any unit) which seems to provide a better inductive bias compared to the `2 norm (weight decay) (Goodfellow et al., 2013; Srivastava et al., 2014). But to achieve rescaling invariance, we use not the max-norm itself, but rather the minimum max-norm over all rescalings of the weights. We discuss how this measure can be expressed as a “path regularizer” and can be computed efficiently.\nWe therefore suggest a novel optimization method, Path-SGD, that is an approximate steepest descent method with respect to path regularization. Path-SGD is rescaling-invariant and we demonstrate that Path-SGD outperforms gradient descent and AdaGrad for classifications tasks on several benchmark datasets. This again demonstrates the importance of implicit regularization that is introduced by optimization.\nThis summary paper combines material previously presented by the authors at the 3rd International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), the 28th Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) and Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 28, as well as Intel Collaborative Research Institutes retreats (Neyshabur et al., 2015a,b,c).\nNotations A feedforward neural network that computes a function f : RD → RC can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G(V,E) with D input nodes vin[1], . . . , vin[D] ∈ V , C output nodes vout[1], . . . , vout[C] ∈ V , weights w : E → R and an activation function σ : R → R that is applied on the internal nodes (hidden units). We denote the function computed by this network as fG,w,σ. In this paper we focus on RELU (REctified Linear Unit) activation function σRELU(x) = max{0, x}. We refer to the depth d of the network which is the length of the longest directed path in G. For any 0 ≤ i ≤ d, we define V iin to be the set of vertices with longest path of length i to an input unit and V iout is defined similarly for paths to output units. In layered networks V iin = V d−i out is the set of hidden units in a hidden layer i."

      "text" : "Consider training a feed-forward network by finding the weights minimizing the training error. Specifically, we will consider a network with D real-valued inputs x = (x[1], . . . , x[D]), a single hidden layer withH rectified linear units, andC outputs y[1], . . . , y[k] where the weights are learned by minimizing a (truncated) soft-max cross entropy loss2 on n labeled training examples. The total number of weights is then H(C +D).\n2. When using soft-max cross-entropy, the loss is never exactly zero for correct predictions with finite margins/confidences. Instead, if the data is separable, in order to minimize the loss the weights need to be scaled up toward infinity and the cross entropy loss goes to zero, and a global minimum is never attained. In order to be able to say that we are actually reaching a zero loss solution, and hence a global minimum, we use a slightly modified soft-max which does not noticeably change the results in practice. This truncated loss returns the same exact value for wrong predictions or correct prediction with confidences less than a threshold but returns zero for correct predictions with large enough margins: Let {si}ki=1 be the scores for k possible labels and c be the correct labels. Then the soft-max cross-entropy loss can be written as `(s, c) = ln ∑ i exp(si − sc) but we instead use the differentiable\nWhat happens to the training and test errors when we increase the network sizeH? The training error will necessarily decrease. The test error might initially decrease as the approximation error is reduced and the network is better able to capture the targets. However, as the size increases further, we loose our capacity control and generalization ability, and should start overfitting. This is the classic approximation-estimation tradeoff behavior.\nConsider, however, the results shown in Figure 1, where we trained networks of increasing size on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Training was done using stochastic gradient descent with momentum and diminishing step sizes, on the training error and without any explicit regularization. As expected, both training and test error initially decrease. More surprising is that if we increase the size of the network past the size required to achieve zero training error, the test error continues decreasing! This behavior is not at all predicted by, and even contrary to, viewing learning as fitting a hypothesis class controlled by network size. For example for MNIST, 32 units are enough to attain zero training error. When we allow more units, the network is not fitting the training data any better, but the estimation error, and hence the generalization error, should increase with the increase in capacity. However, the test error goes down. In fact, as we add more and more parameters, even beyond the number of training examples, the generalization error does not go up.\nloss function ˆ̀(s, c) = ln ∑\ni f(si − sc) where f(x) = exp(x) for x ≥ −11 and f(x) = exp(−11)[x + 13] 2 +/4\notherwise. Therefore, we only deviate from the soft-max cross-entropy when the margin is more than 11, at which point the effect of this deviation is negligible (we always have ∣∣∣`(s, c)− ˆ̀(s, c)∣∣∣ ≤ 0.000003k)—if there are any actual errors the behavior on them would completely dominate correct examples with margin over 11, and if there are no errors we are just capping the amount by which we need to scale up the weights.\nWhat is happening here? A possible explanation is that the optimization is introducing some implicit regularization. That is, we are implicitly trying to find a solution with small “complexity”, for some notion of complexity, perhaps norm. This can explain why we do not overfit even when the number of parameters is huge. Furthermore, increasing the number of units might allow for solutions that actually have lower “complexity”, and thus generalization better. Perhaps an ideal then would be an infinite network controlled only through this hidden complexity.\nWe want to emphasize that we are not including any explicit regularization, neither as an explicit penalty term nor by modifying optimization through, e.g., drop-outs, weight decay, or with one-pass stochastic methods. We are using a stochastic method, but we are running it to convergence— we achieve zero surrogate loss and zero training error. In fact, we also tried training using batch conjugate gradient descent and observed almost identical behavior. But it seems that even still, we are not getting to some random global minimum—indeed for large networks the vast majority of the many global minima of the training error would horribly overfit. Instead, the optimization is directing us toward a “low complexity” global minimum.\nWe have argued that the implicit regularization is due to the optimization. It is therefore expected that different optimization methods introduce different implicit regularizations which leads to different generalization properties. In an attempt to find an optimization method with better generalization properties, we recall that the optimization is also tied to a choice of geometry/distance measure in the parameter space. We look into the desirable properties of a geometry for neural networks and suggest an optimization algorithm that is tied to that geometry."

      "heading" : "3. The Geometry of Optimization: Rescaling and Unbalanceness",
      "text" : "In this section, we look at the behavior of the Euclidean geometry under rescaling and unbalanceness. One of the special properties of RELU activation function is non-negative homogeneity. That is, for any scalar c ≥ 0 and any x ∈ R, we have σRELU(c · x) = c · σRELU(x). This interesting property allows the network to be rescaled without changing the function computed by the network. We define the rescaling function ρc,v(w), such that given the weights of the network w : E → R, a constant c > 0, and a node v, the rescaling function multiplies the incoming edges and divides the outgoing edges of v by c. That is, ρc,v(w) maps w to the weights w̃ for the rescaled network, where for any (u1 → u2) ∈ E:\nw̃(u1→u2) =  c.w(u1→u2) u2 = v, 1 cw(u1→u2) u1 = v,\nw(u1→u2) otherwise.\n(1)\nIt is easy to see that the rescaled network computes the same function, i.e. fG,w,σRELU = fG,ρc,v(w),σRELU . We say that the two networks with weights w and w̃ are rescaling equivalent denoted by w ∼ w̃ if and only if one of them can be transformed to another by applying a sequence of rescaling functions ρc,v.\nGiven a training set S = {(x1, yn), . . . , (xn, yn)}, our goal is to minimize the following objective function:\nL(w) = 1\nn n∑ i=1 `(fw(xi), yi). (2)\nLet w(t) be the weights at step t of the optimization. We consider update step of the following form w(t+1) = w(t) + ∆w(t+1). For example, for gradient descent, we have ∆w(t+1) = −η∇L(w(t)), where η is the step-size. In the stochastic setting, such as SGD or mini-batch gradient descent, we calculate the gradient on a small subset of the training set.\nSince rescaling equivalent networks compute the same function, it is desirable to have an update rule that is not affected by rescaling. We call an optimization method rescaling invariant if the updates of rescaling equivalent networks are rescaling equivalent. That is, if we start at either one of the two rescaling equivalent weight vectors w̃(0) ∼ w(0), after applying t update steps separately on w̃(0) and w(0), they will remain rescaling equivalent and we have w̃(t) ∼ w(t).\nUnfortunately, gradient descent is not rescaling invariant. The main problem with the gradient updates is that scaling down the weights of an edge will also scale up the gradient which, as we see later, is exactly the opposite of what is expected from a rescaling invariant update.\nFurthermore, gradient descent performs very poorly on “unbalanced” networks. We say that a network is balanced if the norm of incoming weights to different units are roughly the same or within a small range. For example, Figure a shows a huge gap in the performance of SGD initialized with a randomly generated balanced networkw(0), when training on MNIST, compared to a network initialized with unbalanced weights w̃(0). Here w̃(0) is generated by applying a sequence of random rescaling functions on w(0) (and therefore w(0) ∼ w̃(0)).\nIn an unbalanced network, gradient descent updates could blow up the smaller weights, while keeping the larger weights almost unchanged. This is illustrated in Figure b. If this were the only issue, one could scale down all the weights after each update. However, in an unbalanced network, the relative changes in the weights are also very different compared to a balanced network. For\nexample, Figure c shows how two rescaling equivalent networks could end up computing a very different function after only a single update."

      "text" : "Following Neyshabur et al. (2015b), we consider the grouping of weights going into each node of the network. This forms the following generic group-norm type regularizer, parametrized by 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞:\nµp,q(w) = ∑ v∈V  ∑ (u→v)∈E ∣∣w(u→v)∣∣p q/p  1/q . (3)\nTwo simple cases of above group-norm are p = q = 1 and p = q = 2 that correspond to overall `1 regularization and weight decay respectively. Another form of regularization that is shown to be very effective in RELU networks is the max-norm regularization, which is the maximum over all units of norm of incoming edge to the unit3 (Goodfellow et al., 2013; Srivastava et al., 2014). The max-norm correspond to “per-unit” regularization when we set q = ∞ in equation (4) and can be written in the following form:\nµp,∞(w) = sup v∈V  ∑ (u→v)∈E ∣∣w(u→v)∣∣p 1/p (4)\nWeight decay is probably the most commonly used regularizer. On the other hand, per-unit regularization might not seem ideal as it is very extreme in the sense that the value of regularizer corresponds to the highest value among all nodes. However, the situation is very different for networks with RELU activations (and other activation functions with non-negative homogeneity property). In these cases, per-unit `2 regularization has shown to be very effective (Srivastava et al., 2014). The main reason could be because RELU networks can be rebalanced in such a way that all hidden units have the same norm. Hence, per-unit regularization will not be a crude measure anymore.\nSince µp,∞ is not rescaling invariant and the values of the scale measure are different for rescaling equivalent networks, it is desirable to look for the minimum value of a regularizer among all rescaling equivalent networks. Surprisingly, for a feed-forward network, the minimum `p per-unit regularizer among all rescaling equivalent networks can be efficiently computed by a single forward step. To see this, we consider the vector π(w), the path vector, where the number of coordinates of π(w) is equal to the total number of paths from the input to output units and each coordinate of π(w) is the equal to the product of weights along a path from an input nodes to an output node. The `p-path regularizer is then defined as the `p norm of π(w) (Neyshabur et al., 2015b):\nφp(w) = ‖π(w)‖p =  ∑ vin[i] e1→v1 e2→v2... ed→vout[j] ∣∣∣∣∣ d∏ k=1 wek ∣∣∣∣∣ p  1/p\n(5)\n3. This definition of max-norm is a bit different than the one used in the context of matrix factorization (Srebro and Shraibman, 2005). The later is similar to the minimum upper bound over `2 norm of both outgoing edges from the input units and incoming edges to the output units in a two layer feed-forward network.\nThe following Lemma establishes that the `p-path regularizer corresponds to the minimum over all equivalent networks of the per-unit `p norm:\nLemma 4.1 (Neyshabur et al. (2015b)) φp(w) = min w̃∼w\n( µp,∞(w̃) )d The definition (5) of the `p-path regularizer involves an exponential number of terms. But it can be computed efficiently by dynamic programming in a single forward step using the following equivalent form as nested sums:\nφp(w) =  ∑ (vd−1→vout[j])∈E ∣∣w(vd−1→vout[j])∣∣p ∑ (vd−2→vd−1)∈E · · · ∑ (vin[i]→v1)∈E ∣∣w(vin[i]→v1)∣∣p 1/p\nA straightforward consequence of Lemma 4.1 is that the `p path-regularizer φp is invariant to rescaling, i.e. for any w̃ ∼ w, φp(w̃) = φp(w)."

When used in stochastic settings, we refer to it as Path-SGD.\nNow that we know Path-SGD is an approximate steepest descent with respect to the pathregularizer, we can ask whether or not this makes Path-SGD a rescaling invariant optimization method. The next theorem proves that Path-SGD is indeed rescaling invariant.\nTheorem 5.1 Path-SGD is rescaling invariant.\nProof It is sufficient to prove that using the update rule (8), for any c > 0 and any v ∈ E, if w̃(t) = ρc,v(w\n(t)), then w̃(t+1) = ρc,v(w(t+1)). For any edge e in the network, if e is neither incoming nor outgoing edge of the node v, then w̃(e) = w(e), and since the gradient is also the same for edge e we have w̃(t+1)e = w (t+1) e . However, if e is an incoming edge to v, we have that w̃(t)(e) = cw(t)(e). Moreover, since the outgoing edges of v are divided by c, we get γp(w̃(t), e) = γp(w(t),e)\nc2 and ∂L∂we (w̃ (t)) = ∂Lc∂we (w (t)). Therefore,\nw̃(t+1)e = cw (t) e −\nc2η\nγp(w(t), e)\n∂L\nc∂we (w(t))\n= c ( w(t) − η\nγp(w(t), e)\n∂L\n∂we (w(t))\n) = cw(t+1)e .\nA similar argument proves the invariance of Path-SGD update rule for outgoing edges of v. Therefore, Path-SGD is rescaling invariant.\nEfficient Implementation: The Path-SGD update rule (8), in the way it is written, needs to consider all the paths, which is exponential in the depth of the network. However, it can be calculated in a time that is no more than a forward-backward step on a single data point. That is, in a minibatch setting with batch size B, if the backpropagation on the mini-batch can be done in time BT , the running time of the Path-SGD on the mini-batch will be roughly (B + 1)T – a very moderate runtime increase with typical mini-batch sizes of hundreds or thousands of points. Algorithm 1 shows an efficient implementation of the Path-SGD update rule.\nWe next compare Path-SGD to other optimization methods in both balanced and unbalanced settings."

We used mini-batches of size 100 and the step-size of 10−α, where α is an integer between 0 and 10. To choose α, for each dataset, we considered the validation errors over the validation set (10000 randomly chosen points that are kept out during the initial training) and picked the one that reaches the minimum error faster. We then trained the network over the entire training set. All the networks were trained both with and without dropout. When training with dropout, at each update step, we retained each unit with probability 0.5.\nThe optimization results are shown in Figure 3. For each of the four datasets, the plots for objective function (cross-entropy), the training error and the test error are shown from left to right where in each plot the values are reported on different epochs during the optimization. The dropout is used for the experiments on CIFAR-100 and SVHN. Please see Neyshabur et al. (2015a) for a more complete set of experimental results.\nWe can see in Figure 3 that not only does Path-SGD often get to the same value of objective function, training and test error faster, but also the plots for test errors demonstrate that implicit regularization due to steepest descent with respect to path-regularizer leads to a solution that generalizes better. This provides further evidence on the role of implicit regularization in deep learning.\nThe results suggest that Path-SGD outperforms SGD and AdaGrad in two different ways. First, it can achieve the same accuracy much faster and second, the implicit regularization by Path-SGD leads to a local minima that can generalize better even when the training error is zero. This can be better analyzed by looking at the plots for more number of epochs which we have provided in Neyshabur et al. (2015a). We should also point that Path-SGD can be easily combined with\nunbalanced setting, we first initialized the weights to be the same as the balanced weights. We then picked 2000 hidden units randomly with replacement. For each unit, we multiplied its incoming edge and divided its outgoing edge by 10c, where c was chosen randomly from log-normal distribution. Although we proved that Path-SGD updates are the same for balanced and unbalanced initializations, to verify that despite numerical issues they are indeed identical, we trained Path-SGD with both balanced and unbalanced initializations.

Based on that, we revisited the choice of the Euclidean geometry on the weights of RELU networks, suggested an alternative optimization method approximately corresponding to a different geometry, and showed that using such an alternative geometry can be beneficial. In this work we show proof-of-concept success, and we expect Path-SGD to be beneficial also in large-scale training for very deep convolutional networks. Combining Path-SGD with AdaGrad, with momentum or with other optimization heuristics might further enhance results.\nAlthough we do believe Path-SGD is a very good optimization method, and is an easy plug-in for SGD, we hope this work will also inspire others to consider other geometries, other regularizers and perhaps better, update rules. A particular property of Path-SGD is its rescaling invariance, which we argue is appropriate for RELU networks. But Path-SGD is certainly not the only rescaling invariant update possible, and other invariant geometries might be even better.\nFinally, we choose to use steepest descent because of its simplicity of implementation. A better choice might be mirror descent with respect to an appropriate potential function, but such a construction seems particularly challenging considering the non-convexity of neural networks."

We can see in Figure 3 that not only does Path-SGD often get to the same value of objective function, training and test error faster, but also the plots for test errors demonstrate that implicit regularization due to steepest descent with respect to path-regularizer leads to a solution that generalizes better. This provides further evidence on the role of implicit regularization in deep learning. The results suggest that Path-SGD outperforms SGD and AdaGrad in two different ways. First, it can achieve the same accuracy much faster and second, the implicit regularization by Path-SGD leads to a local minima that can generalize better even when the training error is zero. This can be better analyzed by looking at the plots for more number of epochs which we have provided in Neyshabur et al. (2015a). We should also point that Path-SGD can be easily combined with",

We do this by demonstrating that generalization ability is not controlled by network size but rather by some other implicit control. We then demonstrate how changing the empirical optimization procedure can improve generalization, even if actual optimization quality is not affected. We do so by studying the geometry of the parameter space of deep networks, and devising an optimization algorithm attuned to this geometry.",
