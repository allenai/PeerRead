      "text" : "Documents have sequential structure at different hierarchical levels of abstraction: a document is typically composed of a sequence of sections that have a sequence of paragraphs, a paragraph is essentially a sequence of sentences, each sentence has sequences of phrases that are comprised of a sequence of words, etc. Capturing this hierarchical sequential structure in a language model (LM) [30] can potentially give the model more predictive accuracy, as we have seen in previous work [12, 13, 25, 33, 47].\n∗Work was done while visiting Google Research.\nACM ISBN 978-1-4503-2138-9.\nDOI: 10.1145/1235\nA useful aspect of text that can be utilized to improve the performance of LMs is long-range context. For example, let us consider the following three text segments:\n1) Sir Ahmed Salman Rushdie is a British Indian novelist and essayist. He is said to combine magical realism with historical fiction. 2) Calvin Harris & HAIM combine their powers for a magical music video. 3) Herbs have enormous magical power, as they hold the earth’s energy within them.\nConsider an LM that is trained on a dataset having the example sentences given above — given the word “magical”, what should be the most likely next word according to the LM: realism, music, or power? In this example, that would depend on the longer-range context of the segment in which the word “magical” occurs. One way in which the context can be captured succinctly is by using the topic of the text segment (e.g., topic of the sentence, paragraph). If the context has the topic “literature”, the most likely next word should be “realism”. This observation motivated us to explore the use of topics of text segments to capture hierarchical and long-range context of text in LMs.\nIn this paper, we consider Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models [20], a specific kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The LSTM model and its different variants have achieved impressive performance in different sequence learning problems in speech, image, music and text analysis [15, 16, 19, 36, 39, 40, 42, 43, 45], where it is useful in capturing long-range dependencies in sequences. LSTMs substantially improve our ability to handle long-range dependencies, though they still have some limitations in this regard [6, 12].\nRNN-based language models (RNN-LMs) were proposed by Mikolov et al. [32], and in particular the variant using LSTMs was introduced by Sundermeyer et al. [38]. In this paper, we work with LSTM-based LMs. Typically LSTMs used for language modeling consider only words as features. Mikolov et al. [31] proposed a conditional RNN-LM for adding context — we extend this approach of using context in RNNLMs to LSTMs, train the LSTM models on large-scale data, and propose new tasks beyond next work prediction.\nWe incorporate contextual features (namely, topics based on different segments of text) into the LSTM model, and call the resulting model Contextual LSTM (CLSTM). In this work we evaluate how adding contextual features in the CLSTM improves the following tasks:\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n06 29\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n9 Fe\nb 20\n16\n1) Word prediction: Given the words and topic seen so far in the current sentence, predict the most likely next word. This task is important for sentence completion in applications like predictive keyboard, where long-range context can improve word/phrase prediction during text entry on a mobile phone.\n2) Next sentence selection: Given a sequence of sentences, find the most likely next sentence from a set of candidates. This is an important task in question/answering, where topic can be useful in selecting the best answer from a set of template answers. This task is also relevant in other applications like Smart Reply [7], for predicting the best response to an email from a set of candidate responses.\n3) Sentence topic prediction: Given the words and topic of the current sentence, predict the topic of the next sentence. We consider two scenarios: (a) where we don’t know the words of the next sentence, (b) where we know the words of the next sentence. Scenario (a) is relevant for applications where we don’t know the words of a user’s next utterance, e.g., while predicting the topic of response of the user of a dialog system, which is useful in knowing the intent of the user; in scenario (b) we try to predict the topic/intent of an utterance, which is common in a topic modeling task.\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n1) We propose a new Contextual LSTM (CLSTM) model, and demonstrate how it can be useful in tasks like word prediction, next sentence scoring and sentence topic prediction – our experiments show that incorporating context into an LSTM model (via the CLSTM) gives improvements compared to a baseline LSTM model. This can have potential impact for a wide variety of NLP applications where these tasks are relevant, e.g. sentence completion, question/answering, paraphrase generation, dialog systems.\n2) We trained the CLSTM (and the corresponding baseline LSTM) models on two large-scale document corpora: English documents in Wikipedia, and a recent snapshot of English Google News documents. The vocabulary we handled in the modeling here was also large: 130K words for Wikipedia, 100K for Google news. Our experiments and analysis demonstrate that the CLSTM model that combines the power of topics with word-level features yields significant performance gains over a strong baseline LSTM model that uses only word-level features. For example, in the next sentence selection task, CLSTM gets a performance improvement of 21% and 18% respectively over the LSTM model on the English Wikipedia and Google News datasets.\n3) We show initial promising results with a model where we learn the thought embedding in an unsupervised manner through the model structure, instead of using supervised extraneous topic as side information (details in Section 6.4)."

      "text" : "There are various approaches that try to fit a generative model for full documents. These include models that capture the content structure using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [3], or semantic parsing techniques to identify\nthe underlying meanings in text segments [29]. Hierarchical models have been used successfully in many applications, including hierarchical Bayesian models [10, 27], hierarchical probabilistic models [37], hierarchical HMMs [14] and hierarchical CRFs [35].\nAs mentioned in Section 1, RNN-based language models (RNN-LMs) were proposed by Mikolov et al. [32], and the variant using LSTMs was introduced by Sundermeyer et al. [38] – in this paper, we work with LSTM-based LMs. Mikolov et al. [31] proposed a conditional RNN-LM for adding context — we extend this approach of using context in RNNLMs to LSTMs.\nRecent advances in deep learning can model hierarchical structure using deep belief networks [21, 47, 48], especially using a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) framework. In Clockwork RNNs [24] the hidden layer is partitioned into separate modules, each processing inputs at its own individual temporal granularity. Connectionist Temporal Classification or CTC [18] does not explicitly segment the input in the hidden layer – it instead uses a forwardbackward algorithm to sum over all possible segments, and determines the normalized probability of the target sequence given the input sequence. Other approaches include a hybrid NN-HMM model [1], where the temporal dependency is handled by an HMM and the dependency between adjacent frames is handled by a neural net (NN). In this model, each node of the convolutional hidden layer corresponds to a higher-level feature.\nSome NN models have also used context for modeling text. Paragraph vectors [8, 26] propose an unsupervised algorithm that learns a latent variable from a sample of words from the context of a word, and uses the learned latent context representation as an auxiliary input to an underlying skip-gram or Continuous Bag-of-words (CBOW) model. Another model that uses the context of a word infers the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topics of the context before a word and uses those to modify a RNN model predicting the word [31].\nTree-structured LSTMs [41, 47] extend chain-structured LSTMs to the tree structure and propose a principled approach of considering long-distance interaction over hierarchies, e.g., language or image parse structures. Convolution networks have been used for multi-level text understanding, starting from character-level inputs all the way to abstract text concepts [46]. Skip thought vectors have also been used to train an encoder-decoder model that tries to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an encoded passage [23].\nOther related work include Document Context Language models [22], where the authors have multi-level recurrent neural network language models that incorporate context from within a sentence and from previous sentences. Lin et al. [28] use a hierarchical RNN structure for document-level as well as sentence-level modeling – they evaluate their models using word prediction perplexity, as well as an approach of coherence evaluation by trying to predict sentence-level ordering in a document.\nIn this work, we explore the use of long-range hierarchical signals (e.g., sentence level or paragraph level topic) for text analysis using a LSTM-based sequence model, on large-scale data — to the best of our knowledge this kind of contextual LSTM models, which model the context using a 2-level LSTM architecture, have not been trained before at scale on text data for the NLP tasks mentioned in Section 1."

Note that sentence si is equivalent to the sequence of words wi,0 . . . wi,ni−1. Let T be the random variable denoting the topic – it is computed based on a particular subsequence of words seen from the first word of the sequence (w0,0) to the current word (wi,j). This topic can be based on the current sentence segment (i.e., T = Topic(wi,0 . . . wi,j−1)), or the previous sentence (i.e., T = Topic(wi−1,0 . . . wi−1,ni−1)), etc. Details regarding the topic computation are outlined in Section 4.2.\nUsing this notation, the word prediction task in our case can be specified as follows: given a model with parameters Θ, words w0,0 . . . wi,j and the topic T computed from a subsequence of the words from the beginning of the sequence, find the next word wi,j+1 that maximizes the probability: P (wi,j+1|w0,0 . . . wi,j , T,Θ)."

      "text" : "The word-prediction LSTM model was implemented in the large-scale distributed DistBelief framework [9]. The model takes words encoded in 1-hot encoding from the input, converts them to an embedding vector, and consumes the word vectors one at a time. The model is trained to predict the next word, given a sequence of words already seen. The core algorithm used to train the LSTM parameters is BPTT [44], using a softmax layer that uses the id of the next word as the ground truth.\nTo adapt the LSTM cell that takes words to a CLSTM cell that takes as input both words and topics, we modify Equations 1 to add the topic vector T to the input gate,\n1We present the LSTMs equations over here, since we will show subsequently how we have modified these equations to incorporate topics into the LSTM cells.\nforget gate, cell and output gate (T is the embedding of the discrete topic vector).

This approach of concatenating topic and word embeddings in the input worked better in practice than other strategies for combining topics with words. Figure 1 shows the schematic figure of a CLSTM model that considers both word and topic input vectors.\nNote that we add the topic input to each LSTM cell since each LSTM cell can potentially have a different topic. For example, when the topic is based on the sentence segment seen so far (see Section 4.3.1), the topic is based on the current sentence prefix — so, each LSTM cell can potentially have a different topic. Note that in some setups each LSTM cell in a layer could have the same topic, e.g., when the topic is derived from the words in the previous sentence.\nFigure 2 shows the implementation of the CLSTM model in the DistBelief framework, where the PSEmbedding Layer maps the 1-hot encoded input to a dense encoding and is also learned as part of the LSTM training [9]."

For the word prediction task we use HTM2, a hierarchical topic model for supervised classification of text into a hierarchy of topic categories, based on the Google Rephil large-scale clustering tool [34]. There are about 750 categories at the leaf level of the HTM topic hierarchy. Given a segment of text, HTM gives a probability distribution over the categories in the hierarchy, including both leaf and intermediate categories. We currently choose highest probability topic as the most-likely category of the text segment.\n4.3 Experiments\n4.3.1 Features We trained different types of CLSTM models for the word\nprediction task. The different types of features used in the different CLSTM models are shown schematically in Figure 3. The hierarchical features that we used in different variants of the word prediction model are:\n1. PrevSentTopic = TopicID of the topic computed based on all the words of the previous sentence, i.e., T = Topic(wi−1,0 . . . wi−1,ni−1−1).\n2Name of actual tool modified to HTM, abbreviation for Hierarchical Topic Model, for confidentiality.\n2. SentSegTopic = TopicID of the topic computed based on the words of the current sentence prefix until the current word, i.e., T = Topic(wi,0 . . . wi,j).\n3. ParaSegTopic = TopicID of the topic computed based on the paragraph prefix until the current word, i.e., T = Topic(w0,0 . . . wi,j).\nwhere T is defined in Section 4.\n4.3.2 Datasets For our experiments, we used the whole English corpus\nfrom Wikipedia (snapshot from 2014/09/17). There were 4.7 million documents in the Wikipedia dataset, which we randomly divided into 3 parts: 80% was used as train, 10% as validation and 10% as test set. Some relevant statistics of the train, test and validation data sets of the Wikipedia corpus are given in Table 1.\nWe created the vocabulary from the words in the training data, filtering out words that occurred less than a particular threshold count in the total dataset (threshold was 200 for Wikipedia). This resulted in a vocabulary with 129K unique terms, giving us an out-of-vocabulary rate of 3% on the validation dataset.\nFor different types of text segments (e.g., segment, sentence, paragraph) in the training data, we queried HTM and got the most likely topic category. That gave us a total of ≈1600 topic categories in the dataset.\n4.3.3 Results We trained different CLSTM models with different feature\nvariants till convergence, and evaluated their perplexity on the holdout test data. Here are some key observations about the results (details in Table 2):\n1) The “Word + SentSegTopic + ParaSegTopic” CLSTM model is the best model, getting the best perplexity. This particular LSTM model uses both sentence-level and paragraphlevel topics as features, implying that both local and longrange context is important for getting the best performance.\n2) When current segment topic is present, the topic of the previous sentence does not matter.\n3) As we increased the number of hidden units, the performance started improving. However, beyond 1024 hidden units, there were diminishing returns — the gain in performance was out-weighed by the substantial increase in computational overhead.\nNote that we also trained a distributed n-gram model with “stupid backoff”smoothing [4] on the Wikipedia dataset, and it gave a perplexity of ≈80 on the validation set. We did not train a n-gram model with Knesner-Ney (KN) smoothing on the Wikipedia data, but on the Google News data (from a\nparticular snapshot) the KN smoothed n-gram model gave a perplexity of 74 (using 5-grams).\nNote that we were not able to compare our CLSTM models to other existing techniques for integrating topic information into LSTM models (e.g., Mikolov et al. [31]), since we didn’t have access to implementations of these approaches that can scale to the vocabulary sizes (≈ 100K) and dataset sizes we worked with (e.g., English Wikipedia, Google News snapshot). Hence, we used a finely-tuned LSTM model as a baseline, which we also trained at scale on these datasets."

The normalizer term 1 k ∑k−1 j=0 P (Di|Contextj) in the denominator of Equation 5 is the point estimate of the marginal probability P (Di) computed over the set of sequences, where the prior probability of each prefix context is assumed equal, i.e., P (Contextj) =\n1 k , j ∈ [0, k − 1].

One question arises: if we do not use extraneous topics to summarize long-range context, would we get any improvements in performance with unsupervised topic signals? To answer this question, we experimented with“thought embeddings” that are intrinsically generated from the previous context. Here, the thought embedding from the previous LSTM is used as the topic feature in the current LSTM (as shown in Figure 9), when making predictions of the topic of the next sentence – we call this context-based thought embedding the “thought vector”.3\nIn our approach, the thought vector inferred from the LSTM encoding of sentence n − 1 is used as a feature for the LSTM for sentence n, in a recurrent fashion. Note that the LSTMs for each sentence in Figure 9 are effectively connected into one long chain, since we don’t reset the hidden state at the end of each sentence — so the LSTM for the current sentence has access to the LSTM state of the previous sentence (and hence indirectly to its topic). But we found that directly adding the topic of the previous sentence to all the LSTM cells of the current sentence is beneficial, since it constraints all the current LSTM cells during training and explicitly adds a bias to the model. Our experiments showed that it’s beneficial to denoise the thought vector signal using a low-dimensional embedding, by adding roundoffbased projection. Initial experiments using thought vector for sentence-topic prediction look promising. A CLSTM model that used word along with thought vector (PrevSentThought feature in the model) from the previous sentence as features gave a 3% improvement in perplexity compared to a baseline LSTM model that used only words as features. Table 5 shows the detailed results.\nWhen we used thought vectors, our results improved over using a word-only model but fell short of a CLSTM model that used both words and context topics derived from HTM. In the future, we would like to do more extensive experiments using better low-dimensional projections (e.g., using clustering or bottleneck mechanisms), so that we can get comparable performance to supervised topic modeling ap-\n3The term “thought vector” was coined by Geoffrey Hinton [11].\nproaches like HTM. Another point to note — we have used HTM as a topic model in our experiments as that was readily available to us.

We filtered out words that occurred less than 100 times, giving us a vocabulary of 100K terms.\nWe trained the baseline LSTM and CLSTM models for the different tasks, each having 1024 hidden units. Here are the key results:\n1) Word prediction task: LSTM using only words as features had perplexity of ≈ 37. CLSTM improves on LSTM by ≈ 2%, using words, sentence segment topics and paragraph sentence topics.\n2) Next sentence selection task: LSTM gave an accuracy of ≈ 39%. CLSTM had an accuracy of ≈ 46%, giving a 18% improvement on average.\n3) Next sentence topic prediction task: LSTM using only current sentence topic as feature gave perplexity of ≈ 5. CLSTM improves on LSTM by ≈ 9%, using word and current sentence topic as features.\nAs we see, we get similar improvements of CLSTM model over LSTM model for both the Wikipedia and Google News datasets, for each of the chosen NLP tasks."

      "heading" : "8. CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "4Note that this snapshot from Google News is internal to Google, and is separate from the One Billion Word benchmark [5].\nWe have shown how using contextual features in a CLSTM model can be beneficial for different NLP tasks like word prediction, next sentence selection and topic prediction. For the word prediction task CLSTM improves on state-of-the-art LSTM by 2-3% on perplexity, for the next sentence selection task CLSTM improves on LSTM by ≈20% on accuracy on average, while for the topic prediction task CLSTM improves on state-of-the-art LSTM by ≈10% (and improves on BOW-DNN by ≈7%). These gains are all quite significant and we get similar gains on the Google News dataset (Section 7), which shows the generalizability of our approach.\nThe gains obtained by using the context in the CLSTM model has major implications of performance improvements in multiple important NLP applications, ranging from sentence completion, question/answering, and paraphrase generation to different applications in dialog systems."

      "heading" : "9. FUTURE WORK",
      "text" : "Our initial experiments on using unsupervised thought vectors for capturing long-range context in CLSTM models gave promising results. A natural extension of the thought vector model in Figure 9 is a model that has a connection between the hidden layers, to be able to model the “continuity of thought”. Figure 10 shows one such hierarchical LSTM (HLSTM) model, which has a 2-level hierarchy: a lower-level LSTM for modeling the words in a sentence, and a higher-level LSTM for modeling the sentences in a paragraph. The thought vector connection from the LSTM cell in layer n to the LSTM cells in layer n − 1 (corresponding to the next sentence) enables concepts from the previous context to be propagated forward, enabling the “thought” vector of a sentence to influence words of the next sentence. The connection between the sentence-level hidden nodes also allows the model to capture the continuity of thought. We would like to experiment with this model in the future.\nWe would also like to explore the benefits of contextual features in other applications of language modeling, e.g., generating better paraphrases by using word and topic fea-\ntures. Another interesting application could be using topiclevel signals in conversation modeling, e.g., using Dialog Acts as a topic-level feature for next utterance prediction."

In this paper, we present CLSTM (Contextual LSTM), an extension of the recurrent neural network LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) model, where we incorporate contextual features (e.g., topics) into the model. We evaluate CLSTM on three specific NLP tasks: word prediction, next sentence selection, and sentence topic prediction. Results from experiments run on two corpora, English documents in Wikipedia and a subset of articles from a recent snapshot of English Google News, indicate that using both words and topics as features improves performance of the CLSTM models over baseline LSTM models for these tasks. For example on the next sentence selection task, we get relative accuracy improvements of 21% for the Wikipedia dataset and 18% for the Google News dataset. This clearly demonstrates the significant benefit of using context appropriately in natural language (NL) tasks. This has implications for a wide variety of NL applications like question answering, sentence completion, paraphrase generation, and next utterance prediction in dialog systems.",
