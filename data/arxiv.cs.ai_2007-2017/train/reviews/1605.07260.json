Nowadays, Chilean newsreaders are increasingly using social web platforms as their primary source of information, among which Twitter plays a central role. Historical media and pure players are developing different strategies to increase their audience and influence on this platform. In this article, we propose a methodology based on data mining techniques to provide a first level of analysis of the new Chilean media environment. We use a crawling technique to mine news streams of 37 different Chilean media actively presents on Twitter and propose several indicators to compare them. We analyze their volumes of production, their potential audience, and using NLP techniques, we explore the content of their production: their editorial line and their geographic coverage.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 May 2016 02:05:09 GMT  (2335kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07260v1", "in Spanish"]], "COMMENTS": "in Spanish", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["matthieu vernier", "luis carcamo", "eliana scheihing"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07260"}
