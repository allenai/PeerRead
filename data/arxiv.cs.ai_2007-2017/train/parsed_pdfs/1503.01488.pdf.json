      "text" : "The problem of assigning a number of indivisible objects to a set of agents, each with a private preference ordering over the objects, in the absence of monetary transfer, is fundamental in many multiagent resource allocation applications, and has been the center of attention amongst researchers at the interface of artificial intelligence, economics, and mechanism design. Assigning dormitory rooms or offices to students, students to public schools, college courses to students, teaching load to faculty, organs and medical resources to patients, members to subcommittees, etc. are some of the myriad examples of one-sided matching problems [25, 28, 29, 3, 9, 22].\nTwo important (randomized) matching mechanisms are Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) [2] and Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS) [6]. Both mechanisms\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n01 48\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.G T\nhave important economic properties and are practical to implement. The RSD mechanism has strong truthful incentives but guarantees neither efficiency nor envyfreeness. PS satisfies efficiency and envyfreeness, however, it is susceptible to manipulation.\nTherefore, since both RSD and PS induce random assignments, there are subtle points to be considered when deciding which mechanism to use. For example, given a particular preference profile, the mechanisms often produce random assignments which are simply incomparable and thus, without additional knowledge of the underlying utility models of the agents, it is difficult to determine which is the “better” outcome. Furthermore, properties like nonmanipulability and envyfreeness can depend on whether there is underlying structure in the preferences, and even in general preference models it is valuable to understand under what conditions a mechanism is likely to be nonmanipulable or envyfree as this can guide designers choices.\nIn this paper, we consider the random assignment of m objects to n agents, where each agent reports her complete preferences as a strict ordering over objects. We first look at the space of lexicographic preferences and define two axioms for fairness based on partial preference orderings. We show that, as opposed to the general preference domain, RSD satisfies envyfreeness. Moreover, we show that although under lexicographic preferences PS is strategyproof when the number of objects is less than or equal agents, it is susceptible to manipulation when there are more objects than agents.\nWe empirically study the space of all possible preference profiles for various matching problems, and provide insights on the comparability of RSD and PS under the various agent-object combinations with the aim of providing practical insights on the different properties of RSD and PS."

      "text" : "In the house allocation problem with ordinal preferences, Svensson showed that serial dictatorship is the only deterministic mechanism that is strategyproof, nonbossy, and neutral [30]. Abdulkadiroglu and Sonmez showed that uniform randomization over all serial dictatorship assignments, a.k.a RSD, is equivalent to the top trading cycle’s core from random initial endowment, and thus satisfies stratgyeproofness, proportionality, and ex post efficiency [2]. Although RSD is strategyproof and proportionally fair, but it does not guarantee envyfreeness.\nBogomolnaia and Moulin noted the inefficiency of the RSD mechanism from the ex ante perspective, and characterized random assignment mechanisms based on first order stochastic dominance (sd) [6]. They further proposed the probabilistic serial mechanism as an efficient and envyfree mechanism. While PS is not strategyproof, it satisfies weak stratgyeproofness for problems with equal number of agents and objects. Kojima studied random assignment of multiple indivisible objects and showed that PS is strictly manipulable (not weakly strategyproof) even when there are only two agents [18]. Kojima and Manea, later, considered a setting with multiple copies of each object and showed that in large\nassignment problems with sufficienctly many copies of each object, truthtelling is a weakly dominant strategy in PS [19]. In order to give a rationale for practical employment of RSD and PS in real-life applications, Che and Kojima further analyzed the economic properties of PS and RSD in large markets with multiple copies of each object and concluded that these mechanisms become equivalent when the market size becomes large [10]. Particularly, they showed that inefficiency of RSD and manipulability of PS vanishes when the number of copies of each object approaches infinity.\nThe practical implications of deploying RSD and PS have been the center of attention in many one-sided matching problems [1]. In the school choice setting with multi-capacity alternatives, Pathak compared RSD and PS using data from the assignment of public schools in New York City and observed that many students obtained a more desirable random assignment through PS [24]. However, the efficiency difference was quite small. These observations further confirm Che and Kojima’s equivalence result when there are multiple copies of each object (i.e. school seats) available [10]. Despite these findings for arbitrary large markets, the equivalence results of Che and Kojima, and its extension to all random mechanisms by Liu and Pycia [20], do not hold when the quantities of each object is limited to one [10].\nThis paper sets out to study the comparability of PS and RSD when there is only one copy of each object, and analyze the space of all preference profiles for different numbers of agents and objects. We make several intriguing observations about the manipulability of PS and fairness properties of RSD. Following Manea’s work on asymptotic inefficiency of RSD [21], we show that despite this inefficiency result, the fraction of random assignments at which PS stochastically dominates RSD vanishes when the number of agents is less than or equal to the available objects. Moreover, we show that this result strongly holds for lexicographic preferences when there is equal number of agents and objects."

      "text" : "In this section we define key properties that matching mechanisms should have. In particular, we formally define efficiency, strategyproofness and envyfreeness for (randomized) matching mechanisms.\nIn the context of deterministic assignments, an assignment Ai Pareto dominates another assignment Bi at if ∃i ∈ N such that Ai i Bi and ∀k ∈ N Ak k Bk, where Ai i Bi denotes that agent i strictly prefers assignment Ai over Bi. An assignment is Pareto efficient at if no other assignment exists that Pareto dominates it at . Extending the Pareto efficiency requirement to random mechanisms, we focus only on mechanisms that always guarantee a Pareto efficient solution ex post. A random assignment is called ex post efficient if it can be represented as a probability distribution over deterministic Pareto efficient assignments.\nTo evaluate the quality of a random assignment, we follow the convention proposed by Bogomolnaia and Moulin based on first-order stochastic dominance [6].\nDefinition 1. Given a preference ordering i, random assignment Ai stochastically dominates (sd) assignment Bi(6= Ai) if\n∀` ∈M, w( i, `, Ai) ≥ w( i, `, Bi) (2)\nStochastic dominance is a strong requirement. It implies that for the entire space of utility functions that is consistent with ordinal preferences, an agent’s expected utility under A is always greater than her expected utility under B.\nDefinition 2. A random assignment is sd-efficient if for all agents, it is not stochastically dominated by any other random assignment.\nA matching mechanism is sd-efficient if at all preference profiles ∈ Pn, for all agents i ∈ N , the induced random assignment is not stochastically dominated by any other assignment. Intuitively, no other mechanism exists that all agents strictly prefer its outcome to their current random assignments.\nA matching mechanism is sd -strategyproof if there exists no non-truthful preference ordering ′i 6= i that improves agent i’s random assignment. More formally,\nDefinition 3. Mechanism M is sd-strategyproof if at all preference profiles ∈ Pn, for all agents i ∈ N , and for any misreport ′i∈ Pn, such that A = M( ) and A′ =M( ′i, −i), we have:\n∀` ∈M, w( i, `, Ai) ≥ w( i, `, A′i) (3)\nIn the context of random mechanisms, sd -strategyproofness is a strict requirement. It states that under any utility model consistent with the preference orderings, no agent can improve her expected outcome by misreporting.\nWe can also define a milder version of strategyproofness. A mechanism is weakly sd-strategyproof if at all preference profiles, no agent can misreport her preferences and obtain a random assignment that strictly improves her assignment for the entire space of utility models consistent with her true preference ordering.\nDefinition 4. Mechanism M is weakly sd-strategyproof if for all preference profiles ∈ Pn, for any agent i with misreport ′i, where A = M( ) and A′ =M( ′i, −i), we have\n∃` ∈M,w( i, `, Ai) > w( i, `, A′i) (4)\nWe say that a random assignment induced by mechanismM is manipulable if it is not sd -strategyproof. That is, there exists an agent i with preference i that her assignment under a truthful report does not stochastically dominate her assignment under a non-truthful report. Formally, assignment A induced by mechanism M is manipulable at preference profile if there exists an agent i ∈ N with misreport ′i such that if A = M( ) and A′ = M( ′i, −i), we have ∃` ∈M, w( i, `, A′i) > w( i, `, Ai).\nIntuitively, an assignment is manipulable if for some utility function consistent with the ordinal preferences, an agent’s expected utility under a nontruthful report improves.\nAn assignment induced by a matching mechanism is strictly manipulable if the mechanism does not satisfy weak sd -strategyproofness, i.e., the induced corresponding random assignment is sd -manipulable. Thus, assignment A induced by mechanism M is sd-manipulable at preference profile if there exists an agent i ∈ N with preference i, and a misreport ′i∈ Pn such that\nA′i =M( ′i, −i) stochastically dominates Ai =M( ), that is, ∀` ∈M, w( i , `, A′i) ≥ w( i, `, Ai).\nAn sd -manipulable assignment indicates that there exists an agent that can strictly benefit from misreporting. Clearly, a weakly sd -strategyproof assignment is not sd -manipulable.\nTo analyze the fairness properties of matching mechanisms, we study the ordinal notion of envyfreeness. An assignment is sd -envyfree if each agent strictly prefers her random allocation to any other agent’s assignment, that is, given i agent i’s random assignment stochastically dominates any other agent’s assignment.\nDefinition 5.

      "text" : "In this section, we formally introduce two widely studied matching mechanisms, Random Serial Dictatorship [2] and Probabilistic Serial rule [6].\nRandom Serial Dictatorship (RSD) is a uniform distribution over all possible (priority) orderings of agents, and for each realization of the orderings, the first agent receives her most preferred object, the next agent receives her most preferred object among the set of remaining objects, and so on until no object remains unassigned.1\nDefinition 6. Given a preference profile, the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) mechanism is a uniform distribution over the assignments induced by the set of all possible priority orderings over agents.\nAbdulkadiroğlu and Sönmez showed the equivalence of the random serial dictatorship and the core from the random endowment in the house allocation problem, and argued that this equivalence justifies the wide use of the RSD mechanism in many practical applications such as student housing, course allocating, etc. [2].\nBogmolnaia and Moulin proposed the Probabilistic Serial rule (PS) [6]. Given a preference profile, the PS mechanism treats objects as a set of divisible\n1For n < m, RSD requires a careful method for picking sequence at each realized priority ordering, which will directly affect the efficiency and envy properties of the assignments [8, 17]. For simplicity, we assume that when n < m, at each priority ordering the first agent chooses (m− n + 1) objects, and the rest of the agents choose one object each.\nobjects and simulates a Simultaneous Eating Algorithm (SEA): At every point in time, each agent starts eating from her top choice according to i at the unit speed. When an object is completely exhausted (eaten away), each agent eats away from her most preferred objects among the remaining objects. The eating algorithm terminates when all objects are exhausted.\nThe random assignment of agent i, when SEA terminates, is the fraction of each object that has been eaten away by agent i. We adopt the following definition from Bogomolnaia and Moulin [6]:\nDefinition 7. Given a preference profile, the Probabilistic Serial rule (PS) is the random probability assignment by simulating the Simultaneous Eating Algorithm with uniform speed.\nFor a given preference profile , we let PS( ) ∈ A and RSD( ) ∈ A denote the outcomes of PS and RSD mechanisms respectively.\nIn their seminal work, Bogomolnaia and Moulin characterized the economic properties of these two mechanisms and showed that RSD does not guarantee sd -efficiency [6]. The following example, adopted from Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2001), illustrates the inefficiency of the RSD mechanism.\nExample 1. Suppose there are four agents N = {1, 2, 3, 4} and four objects M = {a, b, c, d}. Consider the following preference profile = ((abcd), (abcd), (badc), (badc)).\nIn this example, all agents strictly prefer the assignment induced by PS over the RSD assignment. Thus, RSD is inefficient at this preference profile.\nTable 2 summarizes the theoretical results from the literature for both RSD and PS. For n ≥ m, PS satisfies sd -efficiency, sd -envyfreeness, and weakly sd - strategyproofness, while RSD is sd -strategyproof, and weakly sd -envyfree, but it is not sd -efficient nor sd -envyfree [6]. However, for n < m, PS is sd -manipulable, i.e., PS is not even weakly sd -strategyproof [19]."

However, in many instances of preference profiles the random assignments induced\nby PS and RSD are simply incomparable, in that neither assignment stochastically dominates the other one. The following example illustrates this subtle distinction even for n = m = 3.\nExample 2. Suppose there are three agents N = {1, 2, 3} and three objects M = {a, b, c}. Consider the following preference profile = ((acb), (abc), (bac)).\nAs shown in Table 3, neither mechanism provides an assignment that stochastically dominates the other: agent 1 receives the same allocation under both RSD and PS, agent 2 strictly prefers PS over RSD, and agent 3 strictly prefers RSD over PS. Thus, the two assignments are incomparable in terms of sd-efficiency.\nIn such instances, the efficiency of the assignments is ambiguous with respect to ordinal preferences. Thus, the (ex ante) efficiency of the induced assignments is contingent on the underlying von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) utility functions.\nSimilarly, the envy of RSD and the manipulability of PS depend on the structure of preference profiles, and thus, a compelling question, that justifies the practical implications of deploying a matching mechanism, is to analyze the space of preference profiles to find the likelihood of inefficient, manipulable, or envious assignments under these mechanisms.\nIn the next sections, we focus attention on lexicographic preference, and discuss the properties of RSD and PS in this domain.

Lexicographic preferences are present in various applications and have been extensively studied in artificial intelligence and multiagent systems as a means of assessing allocations based on ordinal preferences [11, 26].\nGiven two assignments, an agent prefers the one in which there is a higher probability for getting the most-preferred object. Formally, given a preference ordering i= o1 o2 . . . om, agent i prefers any allocation Ai that assigns a higher probability to her top ranked object pi,o1 over any assignment Bi with Bi,o1 < Ai,o1 , regardless of the assigned probabilities to all other objects. Only when two assignments allocate the same probability to the top object will the agent considers the next-ranked object.\nDefinition 8.

(6)\nA matching mechanism is lexicographically efficient (ld-efficient) if for all preference profiles its induced assignment is not lexicographically dominated by any other random assignment. By definition sd -efficiency yields ld -efficiency, however, an ld -efficient assignment may not be sd -efficient. The following example illustrates this:\nExample 3. Consider four agents N = {1, 2, 3, 4} and four objects M = {a, b, c, d} at the following preference profile = ((cabd), (acdb), (cbda), (acbd)). Table 4 shows the assignments induced by PS and RSD. Here, PS lexicographically dominates RSD since all the agents receive a higher probability of their more preferred objects under PS. However, PS does not stochastically dominate RSD because agent 2 (similarly agent 4) weakly prefers the RSD assignment as w( 2, c, RSD( )) = 1124 + 1 12 = 13 24 is greater than w( 2, c, PS( )) = 1 2 +0 = 1 2 . Thus, the two random assignments are in fact incomparable with respect to stochastic dominance.\nProposition 1. PS is ld-efficient, RSD is not.\nProof. The ld -efficiency of PS is directly derived from its sd -efficiency. Example 1 illustrates that RSD is not ld -efficient.\nSd -efficiency implies ld -efficiency.

Sd -envyfreeness leads to ld -envyfreeness; however, ld -envyfree allocations may not satisfy sd - envyfreeness.\nExample 4. In Example 2, under RSD no agent is ld-envious of any other agent. However, agent 2 is weakly envious of agent 3’s assignment. Thus, the assignment is not sd-envyfree. Assume agent 2’s utility for the objects is u2(a) > u2(b) > u2(c). Agent 2’s utility for objects as good as object b under her assignment and agent 3’s assignment can be written as follows 56u2(b) > 3 6u2(a) + 1 6u2(b). Thus, for all utility functions at which u2(b) > 3 4u2(a), agent 2 prefers agent 3’s random assignment.\nBased on the definition of stochastic dominance, it is easy to see that every sd -envyfree mechanism satisfies ld -envyfreeness. PS satisfies sd -envyfreeness, hence, it is ld -envyfree for all preference profiles. However, ld -envyfreeness is stronger than weak sd -envyfreeness.\nProposition 2. Every ld-envyfree allocation is weakly sd-envyfree, that is, ldenvyfree ⊂ weakly sd-envyfree.\nThe inclusion in Proposition 2 is strict: consider two agents with 1= 2= (abc).

The relationship between the different definitions of fairness is as follows:2\nBefore analyzing the envyfreeness of RSD in the lexicographic domain, we need to define a simple axiom called downward partial symmetry (DPS). Intuitively, DPS is an extension to the fairness notion of equity (a.k.a proportionality). DPS states that starting from the first-ranked objects downwards, all agents with identical partial preferences receive exactly the same random assignment of the objects in the partial ordering.\n2For a complete discussion on the computational complexity of finding or verifying the fairness concepts with respect to envyfreeness and proportionality see [4].\nsd -envyfreeweak sd -envyfree strongerweaker\nld -envyfree ex post envyfree\nDefinition 10.

A random assignment satisfies downward partial symmetry (DPS) if for all agent i, k ∈ N ,\n∀` where `i= `k ⇔ for all j i `, Ai,j = Ak,j (7)\nSimilarly, a random assignment satisfies upward partial symmetry (UPS) if starting from the least favorite objects, agents with identical partial preferences receive exactly the same random assignment of the objects in the partial ordering. It is easy to see that PS satisfies both UPS and DPS. However, RSD only satisfies DPS.\nProposition 3. RSD satisfies DPS but does not guarantee UPS.\nProof. In Example 3, agent 1 and 4’s assignments illustrate the non-existence of UPS.\nRSD is a uniform distribution over the set of priority orderings, and thus, satisfies equal treatment of equals for full preference orderings, i.e., i= k then Ai,` = Ak,`,∀`. Assume for contradiction that for two agents i, k ∈ N where `i= `k, ∃ `′ i ` such that Ai,`′ 6= Ak,`′ . For the sake of simplicity, let us assume Ai,`′ < Ak,`′ . For any serial dictatorship where i precedes k in the priority ordering, i chooses an object j such that j i `′. This immediately implies that Ai,j > Ak,j for some j k `′. We can continue this by induction backward up to the first-ranked item, implying that there exists a priority ordering at which agent i chooses a less preferred object, that is `i 6= `k, which contradicts the assumption. Similarly we can show that if `i 6= `k, it is impossible to achieve Ai,j = Ak,j ,∀j i `.\nThe next theorem shows that although RSD is not sd -envyfree, it satisfies the weaker notion of ld -envyfreeness.\nTheorem 1. RSD is ld-envyfree, for any n and m.\nProof. Assume for contradiction that there exists an agent k ∈ N with random assignment Ak that agent i ld prefers Ak to her own Ai. Therefore, by definition of lexicographic dominance, there exists an object ` ∈M such that RSD assigns higher probability to k, i.e. Ai,` < Ak,`, and ∀j ∈ M : j i `, Ai,j = Ak,j . According to Proposition 3 this is only possible when `i 6= `k, implying that RSD is ld -envyfree.\nThe ld -envyfreeness of RSD is noteworthy: it shows that despite RSD is not sd -envyfree, it satisfies envyfreeness with respect to lexicographic preferences."

Figure 2a reveals an interesting observation: fixing any n > 3, the percentage of agents that are (weakly) envious grows with the number of objects, however, there is a sudden drop in the percentage of envious agents when there are equal number of agents and objects.\nFor better understanding of the population of agents who feel (weakly) envious under RSD, we illustrate the envy distribution over the set of preference profiles for each n = m (Figure 2b). One observation is that there are few distinct envy profiles at each n, each representing a particular class of preference profiles, and by increasing n, the fraction of agents that are envious of at least one other agent increases."

      "heading" : "6.3 Manipulability of PS",
      "text" : "In Section 5, we characterized the incentive properties of the PS mechanism with regards to the stochastic dominance and lexicographic dominance relations, arguing that although for n ≥ m PS is weakly sd -strategyproof and ld -strategyproof, when n < m PS no longer satisfies these two properties.4 Nonetheless, we are interested in gaining insights on the fraction of preference profiles at which PS is manipulable.\n4A recent experimental study on the incentive properties of PS shows that human subjects are less likely to manipulate the mechanism when misreporting is a Nash equilibrium. However, subjects’ tendency for misreporting is still significant even when it does not improve their allocations [16]. Hence, the PS mechanism suffers from incentive properties. In fact other mechanisms, such as the Draft mechanism, has shown to be highly susceptible to manipulation in many real-life markets such as course allocation at business schools [9].\nFigure 3a shows that the fraction of manipulable preference profiles goes to 1 as n or m grow. In fact, PS is almost 100% manipulable for n > 5,m > 5 (obviously PS is sd -strategyproof when m = 2.). Another compelling observation is that for all n < m, the fraction of sd -manipulable preference profiles goes to 1 as m − n grows (Figure 3b). This states that in problems where the number of objects are larger than the number of agents, an agent can strictly benefit from misreporting her preferences. Figure 4 shows that under lexicographic preferences, the fraction of ld -manipulable preference profiles converges to 1 even more rapidly."

      "heading" : "7 Discussion",
      "text" : "In this paper we conducted a comparison study of RSD and PS in order to gain further insight into their respective properties. We argued that outcomes generated by the mechanisms can be incomparable, making it difficult to determine which is the better mechanism in different settings. We then looked at some theoretical properties for the mechanisms under the assumption that agents have lexicographic preferences. Finally, we conducted an empirical comparison on the mechanisms.\nEarlier work had shown that RSD is sd -strategyproof, ex post efficient and guarantees weak sd -envyfreeness. We were able to further the theoretical understanding of the mechanism by showing that it is also ld -envyfree. Furthermore, our empirical work showed that the actual fraction of outcomes where PS stochastically dominates RSD goes to 0 as nm goes to 1, raising the question as to whether the lack of sd -efficiency guarantees for RSD is a significant concern in practice. In contrast, PS is sd -efficient, sd -envyfree and ld -strategyproof for n ≥ m. However, when n < m, the fraction of sd - and ld -manipulable assignments approaches 1, limiting the effectiveness of PS.\nGiven the theoretical and empirical results, we suggest that in many cases\nRSD is, perhaps, a more suitable matching mechanism to consider, especially when n ≤ m. This confirms previous studies on settings where there was an equal number of agents and objects [23, 12, 15]. We further strengthen this argument by providing an observation: At preference profiles where PS and RSD induce identical assignments, RSD is sd -efficient, sd -envyfree, and sd - strategyproof. However, PS may still be manipulable.\nExample 6. Consider the following preference profile = ((bca), (cab), (bca)). Table 6 shows the induced random assignment. In this case, with PS as the matching mechanism, agent 1 can misreport her preference as ′1= (cba), and manipulate her assignment to 1/4(b), 1/2(c), 1/4(a). It is easy to see that agent 1’s misreport improves her expected outcome for all utility models where 26u1(c) > 1 4u1(b) + 1 12u1(a) (for example utilities 10, 9, 0 for b, c, a respectively.).\nThis work raises several interesting questions. From the theoretical perspective, among these open problems, providing theoretical proofs for the efficiency relations in Conjectures 1, 2, and 3 is crucial and not trivial. From the practical view, an interesting open problem is to see if there exists any randomized ld -efficient mechanism that satisfies strategyproofness and some notion of fairness (such as proportionality) for n < m. Lastly, it would be interesting to investigate if there is an extension to the PS mechanism (or its variant based on different eating speeds) that is potentially weakly sd -strategyproof for assigning multiple objects to each agent for n < m."

These two mechanisms both have desirable economic and computational properties, but the outcomes they induce can be incomparable in many instances, thus creating challenges in deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper we first look at the space of lexicographic preferences and show that, as opposed to the general preference domain, RSD satisfies envyfreeness. Moreover, we show that although under lexicographic preferences PS is strategyproof when the number of objects is less than or equal agents, it is strictly manipulable when there are more objects than agents. In the space of general preferences, we provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS, analyze economic properties, and provide further insights on the applicability of each mechanism in different application domains.",
