However, there are situations in which DFO is unavoidable, and for such situations we propose a new DFO algorithm that is proved to be near optimal for the class of strongly convex objective functions. A distinctive feature of the algorithm is that it uses only Boolean-valued function comparisons, rather than function evaluations. This makes the algorithm useful in an even wider range of applications, such as optimization based on paired comparisons from human subjects, for example. We also show that regardless of whether DFO is based on noisy function evaluations or Boolean-valued function comparisons, the convergence rate is the same.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Sep 2012 20:37:02 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2434v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["kevin g jamieson", "robert d nowak", "benjamin recht"], "accepted": true, "id": "1209.2434"}
