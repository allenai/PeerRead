We discuss the foundation of quantifier elimination and demonstrate its application to some statistical problems. Other in teresting statistical problems for which Tarski's the ory is applicable are described in (Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo, 1990).\nTarski (1951) has posed and solved the following prob lem. Given a sentence in the first order theory of real fields where variables represent real numbers, con stants are 0 and 1, function symbols represent the standard binary operations of a field { +, - , *}, and relation symbols represent the standard binary rela tions {=,f.,<,::;::,>, 2:}, determine whether a sentence\n• Author's primary affiliation: Computer Science De partment, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel.\nis true, and provide a sentence without quantifiers which is equivalent to the original sentence. For ex ample, the sentence (ltx )x2 2: 0 is true and the for mula (ltx )ax2 + bx + c > 0 is equivalent to the formula b2 - 4ac < 01\\ a > 0. Tarski's remarkable theorem is that such an equivalent quantifier-free formula always exists and that there exists an algorithm to construct it. This result opened the way to many applications including geometrical theorem proving and geometric modeling (Caviness and Johnson, 1998).\nTarski's algorithm, developed in the thirties, is mainly of academic interest because its complexity is non elementary (towers of exponentials in the number of variables). Collins (1975) provided an alternative pro cedure for quantifier elimination over the real numbers based on, what he called, Cylinder Algebraic Decom positions (CAD). Collin's procedure is a major break through because of its clear geometrical interpretation and its complexity (doubly exponential in the num ber of variables). Further improvements by Collins and Hong (1991), who developed partial CADs, and an implementation called QEPCAD, made the theory available for testing in numerous application areas. We briefly review the foundations of quantifier elimination in Section 2 and add more details in the appendix.\nGraphical models provide interesting statistical prob lems for which no solution has been known, however, as we observe, quantifier elimination provides a solu tion, at least in principle, to many of these problems. We consider the following classes of problems. 1. list ing all equality and inequality constraints implied by a graphical model with hidden variables. 2. Com paring graphical models with hidden variables (i.e., model equivalence, inclusion, and overlap). 3. An swering questions about the identification of a model or portion of a model, and about bounds on quanti ties derived from a model. 4. Determining whether an independence assertion is implied from a given set of independence assertions. We demonstrate the ap plication of quantifier elimination to these problems in Section 3.\nQuantifier Elimination for Statistical Problems 227\nAnother type of problems for which quantifier elimina tion is applicable are questions about the topology of graphical models. Recently, Geiger, Heckerman, King, and Meek (1998, 1999) introduced and analyzed a class of exponential families which they termed stratified ex ponential families. They classified graphical models as linear, curved, and stratified exponential families, ac cording to whether the parameter space over the ob servables is a linear manifold, a smooth manifold, or a stratified set, and demonstrated that many graphical models with hidden variables are stratified exponential families. Cylinder algebraic decomposition can be used to construct a stratification of an exponential family. Benedetti and Risler (1990) provide such a procedure, however, it has a non-elementary complexity, which makes it impractical even for very simple examples. In Section 4 we discuss other topological properties of graphical models that one may hope to compute using CADs.\n2 Background on Real Geometry and Tarski sentences\nWe consider a first order language Ln consisting of constants, variables, and finite-array operation and re lation symbols. The constants are 0 and 1. Variables in L denote real numbers. Operations are the usual { +, - , *} operations of a field. Constants, variables, and their composition by these operations, yield terms. Relations consist of the binary relations { =, i', <, >, :::; , �} which compare two terms. Atomic formulae con sist of True, False, t i' t', t = t', t < t', t > t', t:::; t', and t � t' where t and t' are terms. The standard log ical connectives { /\\, V, ..,, -+, ++} and quantifiers {3, V} are used to create formulae from atomic formulae. A variable x is bound in a formula 1/! if it is in the scope of a quantifier 3x or Vx; Otherwise, it is free in 1/J. A formula in a first order language that contains no free variables is called a sentence. In the language Ln, a sentence is also called a Tarski sentence. Two Tarski sentences 1/J and 1/J' are equivalent if 1/! ++ 1/!' is true. A formula containing no quantifiers is quantifier-free. A formula 1/J is true if the sentence obtained by a univer sal quantification of all free variables in 1/! is true.\nThe language Ln can be used to describe many ge ometrical, topological, and analytical properties of polynomials over the reals. Section 3 discusses several examples that relate to graphical models. Here we em ploy examples related to quadratic polynomials. The formula 3x( ax2 + bx + c = 0) says that every quadratic polynomial has a real root. This formula is false. The formula 3x(ax2 + bx + c = 0) ++ (b2- 4ac � 0) is true. In other words, the formula 3x(ax2 + bx + c = 0) and the quantifier-free formula b2- 4ac � 0 are equivalent.\nTheorem 1 (Tarski) Every Tarski sentence is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula. Furthermore,\ngiven a Tarski sentence 1/!, there exists an algorithm that constructs a quantifier-free formula equivalent to 1/! and determines whether 1/! is true or not.\nThis is a remarkable theorem which highlights an im portant property of the real numbers. The origi nal proof of Tarski contained an algorithm of non elementary complexity. Collins (1975) presented an improved algorithm, based on, what he termed, cylin der algebraic decomposition (CAD). Collins' algorithm is rooted in a famous geometrical consequence of The orem 1, called the Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem (e.g., Mishra, 1993, Section 8.6.3, or, Benedetti and Risler, 1990), which we now present.\nDefine a semi-algebraic set 'E¢ (Also called a Tarski set) to be a subset of Rn of the form {(x1, . . . , Xn)ll/!(xt, ... ,Xn) = True} where 1/! is a for mula containing exactly n free variables. The formula 1/! is called the defining formula of 'E¢. Equivalently, due to Tarski's theorem, a subset V of Rn is a semi algebraic set if V = Uf=1 nj�1 { x E RnjP;,j(x) ¢?;j 0} were P;j are polynomials in Q[x1, . . . , xn] and ¢?;j is one of the comparison relations.\nA map f : X -+ Y where X � Rn and Y � Rm are semi-algebraic sets, is called semi-algebraic if the graph of , denoted G(f) , is a semi-algebraic set of Rn+m. Note that if is a polynomial map then f is a semi-algebraic map because its graph can be described by m polynomial equalities: Yi - fi(x) = 0, where 1 :::; j :::; m.\nTheorem 2 (Tarski-Seidenberg) Let f : X -+ Y be a semi-algebraic map. Then the image f(X) � Y is a semi-algebraic set.\nThe proof of this theorem only requires to observe that the image f(X) is given by the following Tarski set {y E Yl 3x((x , y) E G(f))} where (x, y) E G(f) can be described by a Tarski sentence because G(f) is as sumed to be a semi-algebraic set. An immediate conse quence of Tarski-Seidenberg's theorem, by choosing f to be a projection map, is that a projection of a semi algebraic set is a semi-algebraic set-an observation which is the basis of Collins' algorithm for quantifier elimination. See the appendix for details.\n3 Sample of applications\nIn this section we reduce several statistical problems to the problem of validating the truth of a Tarski sentence or to the problem of finding a quantifier free formula equivalent to a given one. For each problem, we de scribe its history and show how the CAD algorithm and quantifier elimination advances the state of the art in the pursuit of its solution. We consider mem bership problems for conditional independence (Sec tion 3.1), determining model equivalence, inclusion,\n228 Geiger and Meek\nand overlap (section 3.2), listing all equality and in equality constraints implied by a graphical model with hidden variables (Section 3.3), and model identifiabil ity (Section 3.4).\n3.1 The membership problem\nConsider a set of variables U = { u1, . . . , un}, each with a set of possible values D(u;), a set of probability dis tributions P each with a sample space D(u1) x · · · x D(un), a set of conditional independence statements E over subsets of U, and another conditional indepen dence statement I also over subsets of U. We say that E FP I is true if and only if for all distributions in P for which E holds, it is the case that I also holds. The membership problem is to determine, given E, I and P, whether or not E FP I is true.\nSome effort has been devoted to solving the member ship problem, when u; are assumed to be discrete vari ables, and D(u;) are finite sets whose cardinality is not specified (Pearl, 1988) . Polynomial algorithms for the membership problem of marginal independence state ments and of saturated independence statements have been obtained (Geiger, Paz, and Pearl, 1992; Geiger and Pearl, 1993) . The membership problems for ar bitrary sets of conditional independence sets E, under the assumption that D(u;) are finite sets whose cardi nality is not known, may not be decidable. The work by Herrmann (1995) and Studeny (1992) can be re garded as steps towards establishing this claim.\nWe consider three cases that can be addressed using quantifier elimination. In the first case, we assume each variable is associated with a finite set of possible values D( u;) and that the cardinality of this domain is known. Under this assumption, independence facts can be expressed as a finite number polynomial con straints. In the second case, we assume the domain is the real line R and that P is the class of non-singular multivariate normal distributions. In this case con ditional independence are expressed by asserting that the determinants of some minors of the covariance ma trix are zero (e.g., Lauritzen, 1989), which again can be expressed as polynomial constraints in the param eters of the family. A third case is the combination of discrete and continuous variables assuming a condi tional Gaussian distribution (e.g., Lauritzen, 1989).\nFor example, the following instance of the membership problem, {X1 .l x2, x1 .l X3IX2} F'P (X1 .l X3), where X1 .l X3IX2 stands for X1 and Xs are indepen dent given x2, and where p is the class of tri-variate normal distributions over {X1, X2, X3}, with a posi tive definite covariance matrix (Pii), can be written as\n((p;i) is a positive definite covariance matrix) II P12 = 0 II P33P12 - P13P23 = 0 --t P13 = 0\nThis is a short hand notation for a formula which eval uates to true using Collins' decision procedure.\nA stronger version of the membership problem, which asks whether a disjunction of conditional independence statements is implied from a given set of E of condi tional independence statement, has been considered in (Geiger and Pearl, 1993; Meek, 1995). A well known instance of this problem is the assertion that {X1 .l X2, X1 .l X2IX3} f=p (X1 .l X3) v (X2 .l Xs) is true for multivariate normal distributions. This as sertion can be written as a Tarski sentence and be validated using Collins' decision procedure.\n3.2 Model comparison\nA model is a set of distributions P = {P'YII E r}. We assume each probability distribution in P is indexed with exactly one value of 1 and that 1 is an algebraic number. A polynomial (parametric) model is a model where r is given as the image of a semi-algebraic set 0 under a polynomial map 9, i.e., r = g(0). For example, a discrete Bayesian network with or without hidden variables, defines a polynomial model, where 9 : Rm --t Rn maps the Bayesian network parameters to the joint space parameters of the distribution over the observable variables. All graphical models discussed in (Geiger and Meek, 1998) are polynomial models.\nWhen comparing alternative models, perhaps for the purpose of understanding what features of models are distinguishable, one can compare the sets of distri butions that are parameterized by the model. Sev eral authors (Verma and Pearl, 1990; Spirtes et a!., 1993) have considered the problem of model compar ison on the basis of the representational strength for models that have no hidden variables. For instance, Verma and Pearl (1990) have provided a simple graph ical characterization of equivalence of models. Spirtes et al. (1993) have also considered model comparison among models with hidden variables where compar isons are made only on the basis of independence facts true for the observable variables.\nNo method for comparing graphical models with hid den variables appears in the literature. In this sec tion we demonstrate that various comparisons between polynomial models can be posed as Tarski sentences and solved using a decision procedure for real algebra.\nA polynomial model 9 represents a distribution P over the observed variables if there is a value of the model parameters IJ E 0 such that 1 = 9(1J) is the index for P. The set-theoretic relationship � is used to define the notions of model inclusion and equality. We say that 91 � 92 if and only if\n('v'IJ1)(31J2)[1J1 E 0 --t [IJ2 E 62 II 92(92) = 91 (IJJ)Jl where the expression IJ E 0 is a shorthand for the equation describing the semi-algebraic set e. Equality\ncan be written as Y1 � g2llg2 � g1. Clearly, a sentence for model inequality can be obtained by the addition of the negation symbol to the formula above. These relations capture the notions of model equivalence and model inclusion but not model overlap. Two models Y1, g2 overlap if and only if\nSince we can define inclusion, equality, and overlap with Tarski sentences we can use the decision proce dure to answer these questions.\nConsider, for example, the naive Gaussian graphi cal model with three continuous observed variables X1, X2, X3 and one hidden variable H. Each of the ob served variables are independent given the value of H; graphically this model has an edge between H and X; for each i . The model parameters are four error terms f.;, EH, four conditional means p,;, J.tH and three weights (3; that describe the linear relationship between H and the respective X;. The edge weights (3; and the condi tional means p,;, J.LH take on arbitrary real values and the error terms take on positive real values. Thus, the set of model parameters is a semi-algebraic set. These parameters define a joint Gaussian distribution over the hidden and observed variables as follows\np(H = h,X; =X;)= N(hiJ.Lh,f.H)· 3\nII N(x;I(J;h + p,;, f.; + f37EH) i=l\nwhere N(xiJ.L, E) is a normal density with mean p, and variance f., h is a value of H and x; is a value of X;. This model has been studied extensively in statistics (e.g., Martin and McDonald 1975, Rindskopf 1984). We call it the Heywood model.\nFor simplicity, we focus on the covariance structure of the Heywood model assuming that the conditional means are all zero. For this model the covariance ma trix over the observed variables is as follows;\nf.H/31(32 f.H/35 + E2 EH/32(33\nWe can now compare the Heywood model to a com plete Gaussian Bayesian network over three variables (i.e., a model in which no edge is missing). Writing a Tarski sentence for the assertion that the Heywood model is included in the complete model evaluates to true, and a sentence asserting the equality of the two models evaluates to false. In the next section we dis cuss the constraints over the covariance matrix of the Heywood model which makes this model more restric tive than the complete model. In Section 3.4, we study the identifiability of the Heywood model.\nQuantifier Elimination for Statistical Problems 229\n3.3 Constraints over observable variables\nGeiger and Meek (1998) use a method called implic itation, based on Groebner bases, by which one can obtain equality constraints over the parameters of the distributions over the observable variables implied by a graphical model with hidden variables. Unfortunately, the implicitation procedure is not guaranteed to find all equality constraints, nor can it be used to expli cate inequality constraints over the parameters. The main reason for these limitations is that implicitation has been developed for polynomial equations over the complex field which is not an ordered field.\nIn this section we illustrate the use of cylinder alge braic decompositions (CAD) to identify both equal ity and inequality constraints implied by a polyno mial model. The answer given by the CAD proce dure actually provides a proof, via Theorem 5 (see appendix), that these are the only constraints implied by the model.\nThe general formula for this problem is (36)(g(6)-'Y = 0) where g is a polynomial map between 8 and r. We seek an equivalent quantifier-free formula. A formula that involves 7, which can be measured, and does not mention 0, which cannot always be measured. Our task is an example of the problem of algebraic curve implicitation (Caviness and Johnson, 1998).\nWe consider the Heywood model given in the previ ous section. This model has been studied in statistics because of the estimation problems that arise when the inequality constraints implied by the model are not satisfied by the observed data (e.g., Martin and McDonald 1975, Rindskopf 1984). For simplicity of presentation, we assume all error terms E are known. Consequently, the formula for this example is\n(3(31) (3(32 )(3(33) (r12 = fJ1!32 II r13 = (31(33 II r23 = (32(33)\nQuantifier elimination yields, using QEPCAD, the fol lowing quantifier-free formula:\n(r12 < OAr1a < Ol\\r23 > O)V(r12 < Ol\\r13 > OAr23 < O)V\n(r12 > OAr1a < O/\\r23 < O)V(r12 > Ol\\r13 > OAr2a > O)V (r12 = OAr23 = O)V(r12 = O/\\r13 = O)V(r13 = 01\\rza = 0)\nThese cells consist of the volumes where the product r12r13r23 is positive, the lines where two r;; are zeros, and the origin (Figure 1). These are all the constraints on r;; implied by this model.\n3.4 Identifiability and bounding problems\nOne of the reasons that polynomial parametric mod els are often used is because one is interested in what inferences one can make about model parameters or functions of model parameters. Typically, one assumes\n230 Geiger and Meek\nFigure 1: The CAD for the Heywood model.\nthat the distribution over the observed variables is known to belong to a set of distributions and asks if the quantities of interest ( 1) are uniquely determined ( identifier:l) (2) take on values only in some restricted region ( bounder:l).\nIn this section we show that one can, if the model of interest is a polynomial map g with model parameters e and the quantity of interest Q(O) is a polynomial function of the model parameters, use a decision pro cedure for real algebra and quantifier elimination to answer these questions.\nFirst consider the question of whether Q ( 8) can be identified when g represents the true distribution. This question can be written as\n(\\f'Y)(V8)(\\f8')((8 E e 1\\ 8' E e 1\\ 'Y = g(O)\n1\\g(O) = g(O')] -+ Q(O) = Q(O')]\nWhen Q is the identity map, this question is referred to as the global identification problem. For the case that the true distribution P\"' is known we eliminate the quantifier for 'Y and consider 'Y as a term describing the algebraic index for the distribution.\nConditions for global identifiability have been studied extensively for various types of models and in various areas of statistics (e.g., Yakowitz and Spragins, 1968; Bollen, 1989). A variety of easy-to-check sufficient con ditions as well as a variety of necessary conditions for determining if a model is globally identifiable exist in the literature. Interesting examples of identification problems for causal quantities can be found in Pearl (1995).\nConsider the correlational structure of the Heywood model with €H = 1. The global identification question for this model can be written as follows.\n(\\f (31) (\\f fh) (\\f f3a) (\\f (3� ) (\\f (3�) (\\f (3�) (.81.82 = (3�(3� 1\\ (31(33 = (3�(3� 1\\ f32f33 = (3�(3�] -+ [.81 = .8� 1\\ .82 = .8� 1\\ f3a = .8�].\nThis sentence is false. The parameters of this model are not identifiable whenever there is a zero covariance between two or more observed variables. Furthermore, even if all edge weights are not zero, the model is not identifiable, due to a two-fold covering of the image; if f3 is a vector of edge weights, then -(3 leads to the same distribution over the observables.\nIf one is interested in obtaining bounds for quanti ties when the model g represents the true distribution, one can apply quantifier elimination to the formula (\\f'Y)(\\fO) ['Y = g(O) 1\\ r = Q(O)]. Note that r is a free variable. The result is a quantifier-free formula that describes the set of possible values for the quantity of interest, through equalities and inequalities on r. If the distribution is known, then we eliminate the quan tifier for 'Y and consider 'Y as a term describing the algebraic index for the distribution. Balke and Pearl (1994) obtain bounds for a particular graphical model with hidden variables. In principle, one can obtain identical bounds automatically using quantifier elimi nation.\n4 Computational topology problems\nA Bayesian approach to model selection is to compute the probability that the data is generated by a given model via integration over all possible parameter val ues with which the model is compatible and to select a model that maximizes this probability. An asymp totic method for computing this probability (called the marginal likelihood) is the Bayesian Information Cri teria (BIC) which was proven, under some regularity conditions, to be asymptotically valid for linear and curved exponential models (Schwarz, 1978, Haughton, 1988). However, for general polynomial models, g(8) is a stratified set, consisting of a finite collection of smooth manifolds of different dimensions, not just a single smooth manifold. For polynomial models, the asymptotic validity of BIC remains an open problem.\nA stratified set is a set that has a stratification. A stratification of a subset E of Rn is a finite partition {A;} of E such that (1) each A; (called a stratum of E) is a d;-dimensional smooth manifold in Rn and (2) if Ai n A; =I 0, then Ai � A; and di < d; (frontier condition) where A; is the closure of A; in Rn. See Akbulut and King (1992) for a more general definition. When e is a semi-algebraic set, and g is a polynomial map, then g(8) is a stratified set (e.g., Benedeti and Risler, 1990).\nWe now pose several natural questions. First, can we\nQuantifier Elimination for Statistical Problems 231\nautomatically construct a stratification of g( e) for a polynomial model. Second, and seemingly easier, can we decide automatically whether g(6) is a smooth manifold. Third, can we describe automatically the set of singular points of g(e)-points where BIC may not be valid. In the context of graphical models, it suffices to recall that a graphical model defines a poly nomial model via a polynomial map g from the pa rameter space defining the model (a subset of Rm) to the parameter space over the observables (a subset of Rn).\nWe do not have satisfactory answers to these ques tions and so we can only give answers on small ex amples. We will focus on the zero-mean, three fea tures, Naive Gaussian model presented in Section 3.3. This example shows how a cylinder algebraic decom position can be used to answer these questions. More generally, finding a stratification for an arbitrary semi algebraic set, can be done in non-elementary complex ity (e.g., Benedeti and Risler, 1990). This high com plexity stems from applying n steps of the doubly ex ponential ComputeCAD procedure (described in the appendix). A faster algorithm is not known to us.\nConsider the example in Section 3.3. There are 4 cells of three dimensions denoted C+--• C-+-• C--+• C+++• 6 one dimensional cells which are the positive and negative parts of the three axis, denoted Coo+• Coo- , Co+o, Cow, C+oo, C-oo , and one zero dimen sional cell C000-the origin. It is easy to see, in this example, that this cylinder algebraic decompo sition is actually a stratification and that the singular points are the union of cells of dimensions 1 and 0. The cylinder algebraic decomposition for f (xl, x2) = ax� + bx2 + c - x1, on the other hand, discussed in the appendix, shows that lower dimensional cells need not be singular points, and that deciding whether cells are singular or not requires, in general, to examine their re lation to higher dimensional cells-a task which seems computationally hard.\n5 Concluding remarks\nHong's implementation of (partial) quantifier elimina tion QEPCAD for real closed fields (Version 19) allowed us to run the examples that we discussed in Section 3. However, when we slightly increased the complexity of the input, QEPCAD was running out of memory or we run out of patience. QEPCAD has many tuning param eters and we hope that they can provide extra power for slightly larger problems. Another possible source of improvements is the special form of our input for mulae. For example, the Tarski sentences for model comparison between discrete Bayesian networks with hidden variables always produces multilinear polyno mials (i.e., every variable appears with degree at most 1). Work on quantifier elimination of formulae of re-\nstricted form is a topic of research in symbolic algebra (e.g., Weisspfenning, 1988) .\nAcknowledgment\nWe are grateful to David Cox, Hoon Hong, and Bud Mishra for their helpful suggestions.

Other excellent refer ences are (Schwartz and Sharir, 1983) and a collection edited by Caviness and Johnson (1998) which reprints Tarski's and Collins' original papers (1951,1975) and provides a historical account of the development in real algebra and real geometry along with many important references which are omitted here. The entire theory is rooted in classic work on polynomials.\n6.1 Basic facts about polynomials\nThe set of polynomials in variables x1, . . . , Xn and coef ficients in Sis denoted by S[x1 , . . . , xn]· Each polyno mial in S[x1, . . . , xn] can be regarded as a polynomial in Xn with coefficients in S[x1, . . . , Xn-d· The nota tion S[x1, . . . , Xn-1Hxn] expresses this idea. Through out, to simplify our presentation, the set S is assumed to be the set of polynomials of some maximal degree (possibly zero) with rational coefficients. When the maximal degree of the polynomials in S is zero, we denote the coefficients with Q. The theorems that we cite, however, hold for more general sets of coefficients. For details, examine the aforementioned references.\nThe Resultant of of two polynomials A(x) and B(x) in S[x] with degrees m and n respectively, denoted by Resultant( A, B), is the determinant of the following ( m + n) x ( m + n) matrix over S (called the Sylvester\nQuantifier Elimination for Statistical Problems 233\nmatrix of A(x) and B(x)):\nam Um-1 ao am Um-1 ao\nam Um-1 ao bn bn-1 bo\nbm bn-1 bo\nbn bn-1 bo\nwhich consists of n staged rows of coefficients of A and m staged rows of coefficients of B.\nTheorem 3 A polynomial A(x) E S[x] of degree at least two has a repeated factor iff Resultant(A, A') = 0 where A'(x) is the (formal) derivative of A(x).\nFor example, if A(x) = ax2 + bx + c where a> 0 , then A'(x) = 2ax + b, the Sylvester matrix is\nand Resultant(A,A') = a(4ac- b2) . Consequently, A(x) has a repeated factor iff its discriminant b2- 4ac equals zero.\nThe next definition and theorem establish conditions for two polynomials A(x) and B(x) to have a common divisor of degree i.\nThe i-th principal subresultant coefficient of A and B, denoted by PSC;(A, B), is the determinant of the ma trix M}m+n-2i) where m is the degree of A(x) , n is the degree of B(x), 0 � i � min(m, n), and where the matrix M(m+n-2i) is obtained as follows: Start with • the Sylvester matrix of A and B. Remove the first i rows that correspond to the coefficients of A and the first i rows that correspond to the coefficients of B. Remove the first i columns and the last i columns. (Note that the remaining matrix is a square matrix of size m + n - 2i). The following theorem, which demonstrates the importance of these definitions, can be found, for example, in Mishra (1993), Corollary 7.7.9.\nTheorem 4 Let and A(x) and B(x) be univariate polynomials of positive degree m and n, respectively, with coefficients in S. Then, for all 0 < i � min(m, n), A(x) and B(x) have a common divisor of degree i iff\n(Vj < i) [PSCi(A, B)= 0]/\\ PCS;(A, B) i 0.\nFor example, if A(x) = ax2+bx+c and B(x) = 2ax+b, then Mim+n-2) is a matrix of size 1 x 1 which equals the constant 2a, and PSC1(A, B) = 2a. Recalling, that PSC0(A, B) = a(4ac- b2), we see that A and A'\nhave a common divisor of degree 1 iff b2 - 4ac = 0 and a i 0.\nLet A(x) be a polynomial of positive degree n1 and B(x) a polynomial of positive degree n2. De fine n = n1 if n1 > n2 and n = n2 other wise. The principle subresultant coefficient chain of A and B is the sequence PSCn+l = 1, PSCn = bn, where bn2 is the coefficient of xn2 in B ( x), PSCn-1(A, B), . . . , PSC;(A, B), . . . , PSCo(A, B). Theorem 4 tells us that by knowing this chain we can determine the degree of the common divisor of A and B.\n6.2 Cylinder Algebraic Decomposition\nAn element u of R is called a real algebraic number if for some nonzero polynomial f(x) E Q[x], f(u) = 0, where Q[x] are the set of polynomials in x with ratio nal coefficients. Real algebraic numbers form a field. A real algebraic number a can be finitely represented as a triplet ( f(x), l , r) where f is a polynomial in Q[x] such that /(a) = 0 and where (l, r) is an interval that contains a and no other root of f . In this represen tation, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equality to zero, shrinking the interval (l, r) by a fac tor of at least 2, normalizing (l , r) such that l and r will have the same sign, are operations that can all be implemented in polynomial time (in the degree of f and the log size of the coefficients of f). See Mishra (1993) for details. These operations on real algebraic numbers allow us to use finite representations of such (possibly irrational) numbers and explicate them in an arbitrary precision whenever needed.\nDefinition: A decomposition of Rn is a finite collec tion of disjoint connected subsets of R\" called cells. A cylinder algebraic decomposition (CAD) of R\" is de fined inductively as follows: When n = 1, CAD is a partition of R into a finite set of real algebraic num bers, and into the finite and infinite open intervals bounded by these numbers. A CAD of Rn is defined in terms of a CAD K' of Rn-1 via an auxiliary poly nomial\ngc•(x,xn) = gc• (x1, . . . , Xn-1, Xn) E Q[x1, . . . , Xn-1][Xn]\none per C' E K'. The cells of K are of two kinds:\n1. For each C' E K', we have C' x (R U {±oo}) , namely, a cylinder over C.\n2. For each C' E K', the polynomial gc•(p', xn) has m distinct real roots for each p' E C':\nr1(p'), r2(p'), . . . , rm(p'),\neach r; being a continuous function of p'. The following sectors and sections are cylinders over\n234 Geiger and Meek\nALGORITHM ComputeCAD(F J)\nInput: F C Q[x1, ... , Xj]· Output: (Kj,aj) where Ki is an F-sign-invariant CAD of Ri and ai is a set of algebraic sample points, one per cell in Kj.

This CAD has the prop erty that the sign of p( x) is constant in each cell of K. Consequently, determining whether 3x(p(x) � 0) is true reduces to the problem of checking one sample point from each cell. The sample points can be se lected to be real algebraic points, e.g., a1 - 1, a1, (a1 + a2)/2,a2,a2 + 1. This example demonstrates how a CAD K can be used to determine whether a Tarski sen tence is true. We now discuss how to construct such a sign invariant CAD and how to extend this construc tion to higher dimensions.\nLet F C Q[x] and K be a CAD of Rn. Then K is an F-sign-invariant CAD if for every p(x) E F and every C E K , either p(x) > 0 for all x E C, or p(x) = 0 for all x E C, or p(x) < 0 for all x E C.\nTo find an F-sign-invariant CAD K of R, one con structs the auxiliary polynomial 1r(x) = ITp(x)EFP(x), lists the real roots a1, ... , Om of 1r(x), and sets K to be these m numbers joined with the corresponding m + 1 intervals. The key device for listing the real roots of an arbitrary polynomial in Q[x] is an algorithm for root separation which constructs a set of intervals (! ;, r;), i = 1, ... , m, each containing exactly one root such that the representation of a; is (1r(x), l ; , r;). The algo rithm to find such intervals is a binary search. Start with an interval [-M, M] which contains all roots of 1r(x). Divide the interval into two equal intervals left and right. If left contains one root, stop dividing this interval, else continue recursively. Similarly, if right contains one root, stop dividing this interval, else con tinue recursively. The constant M can be defined in terms of the coefficients of 1r(x) and the test for the number of real roots in a given interval is based on Sturm's classical theory. For details consult Mishra (1993).\nThe extension to higher dimensions is achieved by a certain projection operator. For a set of polynomi als F = {/!, ... ,f,} in Q[x1, • . • ,xnJ, where H is the coefficient of xk in /;, the projection �(F) of F on {x1, ... ,xn} is defined by �(F)= �1(F) U �2(F) U �3(F) where\n�1(F) = {f;k(x1, ... ,Xn-dl1 :S i :S s, O :S k :S d;}, �2(F) = {PSCt\"(f;(xl, ... ,xn),D •• (f;(xl,···•xn)))\n11 :S i :=; s , O :S l :S d; - 1} ,\n�a(F) = {PSCt• (J;(x1, ... ,xn),/j(x1,· · ·•xn)) \\1 :S i < j :S s,O :S m :S min(d;, d;)}.\nFor example, for f (x1, x2) = ax�+bx2+c-x1, we have �1({!}) = {a,b,c-x!}, �2({!} = {4a2((c - b2/4a) xl)} and �3(F) is empty because F consists of only one polynomial. The importance of �(F) is demon strated by the following theorem (Based on Chapter 8 in Mishra (1993)).\nTheorem 5 (Collins) Let F C Q[x1, ... , Xn] and �(F) C Q[x1, . . . , Xn-1] be the projection of F on {xl.·· · ,Xn-1}· Let Kn-1 be a �(F)-sign-invariant CAD of Rn-1 and a; be an algebraic point from cell C; of Kn-1· Also, for every cell C; of Kn-1• let 1r(a;, x) be the product of all polynomials in F that do not van ish at a;. Let r1, ... ,rm be the roots of7r(a;,x). Then, Kn = U; Kn,i, where\nKn,i := {{C; x [-oo,r1)},{C; X [r1,r1]}, { C; x (r1, r2)}, ... , { C; x (rm, +oo]}},\nis a F-sign-invariant CAD of Rn and {(a;,r1 1), (a;, rl), (a;, (r1 + r2)/2), ... , (a;, rm + 1)} are al gebraic sample points for the cells of K n.\nTheorem 5 prescribes a recursive algorithm to com pute a F-sign-invariantCAD of a set F of polynomi als in Q[x1, ... , xn]· We demonstrate this claim on a simple two dimensional example. The complete al gorithm is given in Figure 2. Consider F = {!}, where f (x1,x2) = ax� + bxz + c - XJ. We have computed earlier and found that �(F) = {a, b, c - x1,4a2((c- b2f4a)- x1)}. This set is in Q[xt]. The roots of all polynomials in � (F) are { a1 = c - b2 / 4a, a2 = c}. Note that, for the purpose of finding roots, we may as well replace �(F) with the (normalized) set {1, c- x1, (c- b2 f4a) -xi} which has the same set of roots. In our example, these points are simply the x1 coordinates of the minimum of the parabola (as a nmc tion of x2) and its intersection with the axis x1. Now, a �(F)-sign-invariant CAD of R consists of 5 cells, {((-oo, aJ), (ai,ai], (a1,a2), [a1,a2], (a2,+oo], de noted by, C1, . . . , C5, respectively. We can now apply Theorem 5 to construct the cells of a F-sign-invariant CAD of R2. The only cell above c1 is cl X [-oo, +oo]. To compute the cells above Cs we compute the two roots r1 and r2 of J(x1 , x2) at XI = a2 + 1 and the five cells are {C5 x [-oo, ri ),Cs x [r! ,r!] ,Cs x (r1,r2),Cs x [rz,r2] ,C5 x (r2,+oo]}. All other cells over C2,Ca and C4 are computed similarly. We denote with C;; the cells that are cylinders over C;.\n6.3 Quantifier Elimination\nCollins' algorithm for constructing a cylinder algebraic decomposition provides a simple procedure for evalu ating the truth value of a Tarski sentence '1/J and for\nQuantifier Elimination for Statistical Problems 235\ngenerating a quantifier-free formula equivalent to '1/J. In describing this procedure, we assume '1/J is given in prenex normal form, whereby all quantifiers appear in the beginning of the sentence, and only disjunctions, conjunctions, and negations are used. Every first or der sentence can be rewritten in this way. In fact, in the case of Tarski sentences, we do not even need negation because -,(p(x) > 0) can be replaced with p(x) = OVp(x) < 0.\nSuppose '1/J is a Tarski sentence given in the form (Q1xJ) · · · (Qnxn)M(xl, ... ,xn) where Q; is either a universal quantifier V or an existential quantifier 3, and where M is a quantifier-free formula involving a set of polynomial F C Q[x1, ... , Xn]· Collins' algo rithm for evaluating the truth value of '1/J is as follows. Construct an F-sign-invariant CAD K of Rn in the or der XI , ... , Xn. The resulting CAD forms a tree. The leaves of the tree represent the cells of K. The nodes in level i represent a CAD of Ri. The children of a node representing a cell C in a CAD of Ri represent the cylinders over C in the CAD of Ri+1. The tree is regarded as an and-or tree where in level i there is an and if Q; = V and an or if Q; = 3.\nEvaluating the truth value of '1/J is done recursively as follows. First, each leaf, representing cell C, is eval uated to true or false depending on whether M(a) is true or false, where a is the sample point of C. The truth value of a node C in level i is determined by the truth value of its children. If Q; = V, then C evalu ates to true iff all its children evaluate to true, and if Q; = 3, then C evaluates to true iff at least one of its children evaluates to true. The sentence '1/J is true iff the root of the and-or tree evaluates to true. Further more, each leaf represents a cell in a CAD of Rn, which is described with a quantifier-free Tarski sentence. The sentence '1/J is equivalent to the quantifier-free formula obtained by applying the and/or connectives, as pre scribed by the and-or tree, to the quantifier-free for mula that describe the leaves.\nIn the example of Section 6.2, the nodes in the first level correspond to the cells C1, . . . C5, and the nodes in the second level correspond to the cells { C;,; }. Node c! has one child ell• node c2 has three children C2,1,C2,2,C2,3, and n�des C2, C3, and C5, each have five children. The formula (3xJ)(Vx2)ax� + bx2 + c X! > 0 is true because C1,1 evaluates to true and so C1 evaluates to true as well. Consequently, since x1 is existentially quantified, the root is evaluated to true. The cell C1 is given by the quantifier-free formula x1 < c - b2 / 4a which has a clear geometrical interpre tation; The formula is true whenever x1 is smaller than the minimum of the parabola ax� + bx2 + c."

Answering questions about the identification of a model or portion of a model, and about bounds on quantities de­ rived from a model. 4.
