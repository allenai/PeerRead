      "text" : "The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem (or bandit problem) refers to an iterative decision making problem in which an agent repeatedly chooses amongK options, metaphorically corresponding to pulling one ofK arms of a bandit machine. In each round, the agent receives a random payoff, which is a reward or a cost that depends on the arm being selected. The agent’s goal is to optimize an evaluation metric, e.g., the error rate (expected percentage of times a suboptimal arm is played) or the cumulative regret (difference between the sum of payoffs obtained and the (expected) payoffs that could have been obtained by selecting the best arm in each round). In the stochastic multi-armed bandit setup, the payoffs are assumed to obey fixed distributions that can vary with the arms but do not change with time. To achieve the desired goal, the agent has to tackle the classical exploration/exploitation dilemma: It has to properly balance the pulling of arms\n*Equal contribution 1Yahoo Research, New York, NY, USA 2Research Group on AI, Hungarian Acad.

In these tasks, the feedback is formulated as a single real value. However many real-world online learning problems are rather multi-objective, i.e., the feedback consists of a vectorial payoffs. For example, in our motivating example, namely an electric battery control problem, the learner tries to discover a “best” battery controller, which balances the degradation rates of the battery cells (i.e., components of a battery), among a set of controllers while facing a stochastic power demand. Besides, there are several studies published recently that consider multi-objective sequential decision problem under uncertainty (Drugan & Nowé, 2013; Roijers et al., 2013; Mahdavi et al., 2013).\nIn this paper, we formalize the multi-objective multi-armed bandit setting where the feedback received by the agent is in the form of aD-dimensional cost vector. The goal here is to be both efficient, i.e., minimize the cumulative cost for each objective, and fair, i.e., balance the different objectives. One natural way to ensure this is to try to find a cost vector on the Pareto front that is closest to the origin or to some other ideal point. A generalization of this approach (when using the infinite norm) is the Generalized Gini Index (GGI), a wellknown inequality measure in economics (Weymark, 1981).\nGGI is convex, which suggests applying the Online Convex Optimization (OCO) techniques (Hazan, 2016; Shalev-Shwartz, 2012). However, a direct application of this technique may fail to optimize GGI under noise, because the objective can be only observed with a bias that is induced by the randomness of the cost vectors and by the fact that the performance is measured by the function value of the average cost instead of the average of the costs’ function value. The solution we propose is an online learning algorithm which is based on Online Gradient Descent (OGD) (Zinkevich, 2003; Hazan, 2016) with additional exploration that enables us to control the bias of the objective function. We also show that its regret is almost optimal: up to a logarithmic factor, it matches the distribution-free lower bound of the stochastic bandit problem (Auer et al., 2002b), which naturally applies ar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n04 93\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n5 Ju\nn 20\n17\nto our setup when the feedback is one-dimensional.\nThe paper is organized as follows: after we introduce the formal learning setup, we briefly recall the necessary notions from multi-objective optimization in Section 3. Next, in Section 4, GGI is introduced and some of its properties are described. In Sections 5 and 6, we present how to compute the optimal policy for GGI, and define the regret notion. Section 7 contains our main results where we define our OGD-based algorithm and analyze its regret. In Section 8, we test our algorithm and demonstrate its versatility in synthetic and real-world battery-control experiments. In Section 9, we provide a survey of related work, and finally conclude the paper in Section 10."

      "text" : "The multi-armed or K-armed bandit problem is specified by real-valued random variables X1, . . . , XK associated, respectively, with K arms (that we simply identify by the numbers 1, . . . ,K). In each time step t, the online learner selects one and obtains a random sample of the corresponding distributions. These samples, which are called costs, are assumed to be independent of all previous actions and costs.1 The goal of the learner can be defined in different ways, such as minimizing the sum of costs over time (Lai & Robbins, 1985; Auer et al., 2002a).\nIn the multi-objective multi-armed bandit (MO-MAB) problem, costs are not scalar real values, but real vectors. More specifically, a D-objective K-armed bandit problem (D ≥ 2, K ≥ 2) is specified by K real-valued multivariate random variables X1, . . . ,XK over [0, 1]D. Let µk = E[Xk] denote the expected vectorial cost of arm k whereµk = (µk,1, . . . , µk,D). Furthermore,µ denotes the matrix whose rows are theµk’s.\nIn each time step the learner can select one of the arms and obtain a sample, which is a cost vector, from the corresponding distribution. Samples are also assumed to be independent over time and across the arms, but not necessarily across the components of cost vectors. At time step t, kt denotes the index of the arm played by the learner and X(t)kt = (X (t) kt,1 , . . . X (t) kt,D\n) the resulting payoff. After playing t time steps, the empirical estimate of the expected costµk of the kth arm is:\nµ̂ (t) k =\n1\nTk(t) t∑ τ=1 X (τ) kτ 1(kτ = k) (1)\n1Our setup is motivated by a practical application where feedback is more naturally formulated in terms of cost. However the stochastic bandit problem is generally based on rewards, which can be easily turned into costs by using the transformation x 7→ 1− x assuming that the rewards are from [0, 1].\nwhere all operations are meant elementwise, Tk(t) is the number of times the kth arm has been played (i.e., Tk(t) =∑t τ=1 1(kτ = k)) and 1(·) is the indicator function."

      "text" : "In order to complete the MO-MAB setting, we need to introduce the notion of optimality of the arms. First, we introduce the Pareto dominance relation defined as follows, for any v,v′ ∈ RD:\nv v′ ⇔ ∀d = 1, . . . , D, vd ≤ v′d . (2)\nLetO ⊆ RD be a set ofD-dimension vectors. The Pareto front ofO, denotedO∗, is the set of vectors such that:\nv∗ ∈ O∗ ⇔ ( ∀v ∈ O,v v∗ ⇒ v = v∗ ) . (3)\nIn multi-objective optimization, one usually wants to compute the Pareto front, or search for a particular element of the Pareto front. In practice, it may be costly (and even infeasible depending on the size of the solution space) to determine all the solutions of the Pareto front. One may then prefer to directly aim for a particular solution in the Pareto front. This problem is formalized as a single objective optimization problem, using an aggregation function.\nAn aggregation (or scalarizing) function, which is a non-decreasing function φ : RD → R, allows every vector to receive a scalar value to be optimized2. The initial multi-objective problem is then rewritten as follows:\nminφ(v) s.t. v ∈ O . (4)\nA solution to this problem yields a particular solution on the Pareto front. Note that if φ is not strictly increasing in every component, some care is needed to ensure that the solution of (4) is on the Pareto front.\nDifferent aggregation function can be used depending on the problem at hand, such as sum, weighted sum, min, max, (augmented) weighted Chebyshev norm (Steuer & Choo, 1983), Ordered Weighted Averages (OWA) (Yager, 1988) or Ordered Weighted Regret (OWR) (Ogryczak et al., 2011) and its weighted version (Ogryczak et al., 2013). In this study, we focus on the Generalized Gini Index (GGI) (Weymark, 1981), a special case of OWA."

The Generalized Gini Index (GGI) (Weymark, 1981) is defined\n2A multivariate function f : RD → R is said to be monotone (non-decreasing) if for all fixed x,x′ ∈ RD such that x x′ implies that f(x) ≤ f(x′).\nas follows for a cost vector x = (x1, . . . , xD) ∈ RD:\nGw(x) = D∑ d=1 wdxσ(d) = w ᵀxσ\nwhere σ ∈ SD, which depends on x, is the permutation that sorts the components of x in a decreasing order, xσ = (xσ(1), · · · , xσ(D)) is the sorted vector and weights wi’s are assumed to be non-increasing, i.e., w1 ≥ w2 ≥ . . . ≥ wD. Given this assumption, Gw(x) = maxπ∈SD w ᵀxπ = maxπ∈SD w ᵀ πx and is therefore a piecewise-linear convex function. Figure 1 illustrates GGI on a bi-objective optimization task.\nTo better understand GGI, we introduce its formulation in terms of Lorenz vectors. The Lorenz vector of x is the vector L(x) = (L1(x), . . . , LD(x)) whereLd(x) is the sum of the d smallest components of x. Then, GGI can be rewritten as follows:\nGw(x) = D∑ d=1 w′dLd(x) (5)\nwhere w′ = (w′1, . . . , w ′ D) is the vector defined by ∀d ∈ [D], w′d = wd − wd+1 withwD+1 = 0. Note that all the components of w′ are nonnegative as we assume that those of w are non-increasing.\nGGI3 was originally introduced for quantifying the inequality of income distribution in economics. It is also known in statistics (Buczolich & Székely, 1989) as a special case of Weighted Average Ordered Sample statistics, which does not require that weights be non-increasing and is therefore not necessarily convex. GGI has been characterized by Weymark (1981). It encodes both efficiency as it is monotone with Pareto dominance and fairness as it is non-increasing with Pigou-Dalton transfers (1912; 1920); they are two principles formulating natural requirements, which is an important reason why GGI became a well-established measure of balancedness. Informally, a Pigou-Dalton transfer amounts to increasing a lower-valued objective while decreasing another higher-valued objective by the same quantity such that the order between the two objectives is not reversed. The effect of such a transfer is to balance a cost vector. Formally, GGI satisfies the following fairness property: ∀x such that xi < xj ,\n∀ ∈ (0, xj − xi), Gw(x + ei − ej) ≤ Gw(x)\nwhere ei and ej are two vectors of the canonical basis. As a consequence, among vectors of equal sum, the best cost vector (w.r.t. GGI) is the one with equal values in all objectives if feasible.\n3Note that in this paper GGI is expressed in terms of costs and therefore lower GGI values are preferred.\nThe original Gini index can be recovered as a special case of GGI by setting the weights as follows:\n∀d ∈ [D], wd = (2(D − d) + 1)/D2. (6)\nThis yields a nice graphical interpretation. For a fixed vector x, the distribution of costs can be represented as a curve connecting the points (0, 0), (1/D,L1(x)), (2/D,L2(x)), . . . , (1, LD(x)). An ideally fair distribution with an identical total cost is given by the straight line connecting (0, 0), (1/D,LD(x)/D), (2/D, 2LD(x)/D), . . . , (1, LD(x)), which equally distributes the total cost over all components. Then 1−Gw(x)/x̄with weights (6) and x̄ =∑ xi/D is equal to twice the area between the two curves.\nFrom now on, to simplify the presentation, we focus on GGI with strictly decreasing weights in [0, 1]D, i.e., d < d′ implieswd > wd′ . This means that GGI is strictly decreasing with Pigou-Dalton transfers and all the components of w′ are positive. Based on formulation (5), Ogryczak & Sliwinski (2003) showed that the GGI value of a vector x can be obtained by solving a linear program. We shall recall their results and define the linear program-based formulation of GGI.\nProposition 1. The GGI score Gw(x) of vector x is the optimal value of the following linear program\nminimize D∑ d=1 w′d ( drd+ D∑ j=1 bj,d ) subject to rd + bj,d ≥ xj ∀j, d ∈ [D]\nbj,d ≥ 0 ∀j, d ∈ [D]"

      "text" : "In the single objective case, arms are compared in terms of their means, which induce a total ordering over arms. In the\nmulti-objective setting, we use the GGI criterion to compare arms. One can compute the GGI score of each arm k as Gw(µk) if its vectorial meanµk is known. Then an optimal arm k∗ minimizes the GGI score, i.e.,\nk∗ ∈ argmin k∈[K] Gw(µk) .\nHowever, in this work, we also consider mixed strategies, which can be defined as A = {α ∈ RK | ∑K k=1 αk = 1 ∧ 0 α}, because they may allow to reach lower GGI values than any fixed arm (see Figure 1). A policy parameterized byα chooses arm k with probability αk. An optimal mixed policy can then be obtained as follows:\nα∗ ∈ argmin α∈A Gw ( K∑ k=1 αkµk ) . (7)\nIn general, Gw (∑K k=1 α ∗ kµk ) ≤ Gw(µk∗), therefore using mixed strategies is justified in our setting. Based on Proposition 1, if the arms’ means were known,α∗ could be computed by solving the following linear program:\nminimize D∑ d=1 w′d drd + D∑ j=1 bj,d  subject to rd + bj,d ≥\nK∑ k=1\nαkµk,j ∀j, d ∈ [D]∑K k=1 αk = 1 α 0 bj,d ≥ 0 ∀j, d ∈ [D]\n(8)"

      "text" : "After playing T rounds, the average cost can be written as\nX̄(T ) = 1\nT T∑ t=1 X (t) kt .\nOur goal is to minimize the GGI index of this term. Accordingly we expect the learner to collect costs so as their average in terms of GGI, that is, Gw ( X̄(T ) ) should be as small as possible. As shown in the previous section, for a given bandit instance with arm means µ = (µ1, . . . ,µK), the optimal policy α∗ achieves Gw (∑K k=1 α ∗ kµk ) = Gw (µα\n∗) if the randomness of the costs are not taken into account. We consider the performance of the optimal policy as a reference value, and define the regret of the learner as the difference of the GGI of its average cost and the GGI of the optimal policy:\nR(T ) = Gw ( X̄(T ) ) −Gw (µα∗) . (9)\nNote that GGI is a continuous function, therefore if the learner follows a policy α(T ) that is “approaching” α∗ as T →∞, then the regret is vanishing.\nWe shall also investigate a slightly different regret notion called pseudo-regret:\nR (T )\n= Gw\n( µᾱ(T ) ) −Gw (µα∗) (10)\nwhere ᾱ(T ) = 1T ∑T t=1α\n(t). We will show that the difference between the regret and pseudo-regret of our algorithm is Õ(T−1/2) with high probability, thus having a high probability regret bound Õ(T−1/2) for one of them implies a regret bound Õ(T−1/2) for the other one.\nRemark 1. The single objective stochastic multi-armed bandit problem (Auer et al., 2002a; Bubeck & Cesa-Bianchi, 2012) can be naturally accommodated into our setup with D = 1 and w1 = 1. In this case, α∗ implements the pure strategy that always pulls the optimal arm with the highest mean denoted by µk∗ . ThusGw (µα∗) = µk∗ in this case. Assuming that the learner plays only with pure strategies, the pseudo-regret defined in (10) can be written as:\nR (T ) = 1\nT T∑ t=1 (µkt − Tµk∗) = 1 T K∑ k=1 Tk(T ) (µk − µk∗)\nwhich coincides with the single objective pseudo-regret (see for example (Auer et al., 2002a)), apart from the fact that we work with costs instead of rewards. Therefore our notion of multi-objective pseudo-regret can be seen as a generalization of the single objective pseudo-regret.\nRemark 2. Single-objective bandit algorithm can be applied in our multi-objective setting by transforming the multivariate payoffs X(t)kt into a single real value Gw(X (t) kt\n) in every time step t. However, in general, this approach fails to optimize GGI as formulated in (7) due to GGI’s non-linearity, even if the optimal policy is a pure strategy. Moreover, applying a multi-objective bandit algorithm such as MO-UCB (Drugan & Nowé, 2013) would be inefficient as they were developed to find all Pareto-optimal arms and then to sample them uniformly at random. This approach may be reasonable to apply only when α∗k = 1/#K where K = {k ∈ [K] : α∗k > 0} contains all the Pareto optimal arms, which is clearly not the case for every MO-MAB instance."

Since we play with mixed strategies, the domain of our optimization problem is the K-dimensional probability simplex ∆K = {α ∈ RK | ∑K k=1 αk = 1 ∧ 0 α}, which is a convex set.

That is why, the original OGD (Hazan, 2016) algorithm, in general, fails to optimize GGI in our setting. Our analysis, presented in the next section, focuses on the interplay between the forced exploration and the bias of the loss functions f (1)(α), . . . , f (T )(α)."

Nevertheless, an optimal policy α∗ determines a convex combination of several arms in the form of µα∗, which is the optimal cost vector in terms of GGI given the arm distribution at hand. Let us denote K = {k ∈ [K] : α∗k > 0}. Note that #K ≤ D. Moreover, arms in [K] \\ Kwith an individual GGI lower than arms in K do not necessarily participate in the optimal combination. Obviously, an algorithm that achieves a O(T−1/2) needs to pull the arms in #K linear time, and at the same time, estimate the arms in [K] \\ Kwith a certain precision.\nThe main idea in the approach proposed in this paper is, despite the above remarks, to apply some online convex optimization algorithm on the current estimate f (t)(α) = Gw(µ̂(t)α) of the objective function f(α) = Gw(µα), use forced exploration of order T 1/2, and finally show that the estimate f (t) of the objective function has error Õ(T−1/2) along the trajectory generated by the online convex optimization algorithm.

If the projection is carried out onto ∆K according to the OGE algorithm instead of the truncated probability ∆ηtK , the regret bound in Lemma 1 would be improved only by a constant factor (see Theorem 3.1 in (Hazan, 2016)).

This implies that 1T ∑T t=1α (t) k will get arbitrarily close to some α∗k ∈ ∆∗K if T is big enough because, as we show later in Lemma 3, g∗ is strictly positive (see Appendix D). As a consequence, for a big enough T > τ1, the difference between the f (t)(α∗) and f(α∗) is vanishing as fast as O(T−1/2) which is crucial for a regret bound of orderT−1/2.\nStep 4 Finally, Theorem 1 yields from Proposition 3 by simplifying the right hand side.

Nevertheless, using the mean estimates, the optimal policy can be directly approximated by solving the the linear program given in (8). We use the same exploration as MO-OGDE, see line 6 of Algorithm 1. More concretely, the learner solves the following linear program in each time step t:\nminimize D∑ d=1 w′d drd + D∑ j=1 bj,d  subject to rd + bj,d ≥\nK∑ k=1 αkµ̂ (t) k,j ∀j, d ∈ [D]\nαT1 = 1 α ≥ ηt/K bj,d ≥ 0 ∀j, d ∈ [D]\nNote that the solution of the learner program above regarding α is in ∆ηtK . We refer to this algorithm as MO-LP. Note that this approach is computationally expensive, since a linear program needs to be solved at each time step. But the policy of each step is always optimal restricted to the truncated simplex ∆ηtK with respect to the mean estimates, unlike the gradient descent method."

The parameters of each Bernoulli distributions are drawn uniformly at random from [0, 1] independently from each other. The number of armsK was set to {5, 20} and the dimension of the cost distribution was taken from D ∈ {5, 10}. The weight vector w of GGI was set to wd = 1/2d−1. Since the parameters of the bandit instance are known, the regret defined in Section 6 can be computed. We ran the MOOGDE and MO-LP algorithms with 100 repetitions. The multi-objective bandit instance were regenerated after each run. The regrets of the two algorithms, which are averaged out over the repetitions, are plotted in Figure 2 along with the error bars. The results reveal some general trends. First, the average regrets of both algorithms converge to zero. Second the MO-LP algorithm outperforms the gradient descent algorithm for small number of round, typically T < 5000 on the more complex bandit instances (K = 20). This fact might be explained by the fact that the MO-LP solves a linear program for estimating α∗ whereas the MO-OGDE minimizes the same objective but using a gradient descent approach with projection, which might achieve slower convergence in terms of regret, nevertheless its computational time is significantly decreased compared to the baseline method."

As the performance profile of battery cells, subcomponents of an electric battery, may vary due to small physical and manufacturing differences, efficient balancing of those cells is needed for better performance and longer battery life. We model this problem as a MO-MAB where the arms are different cell control strategies and the\ngoal is to balance several objectives: state-of-charge (SOC), temperature and aging. More concretely, the learner loops over the following two steps: (1) she chooses a control strategy for a short duration and (2) she observes its effect on the objectives (due to stochastic electric consumption). For the technical details of this experiments see Appendix G.\nWe tackled this problem as a GGI optimization problem. The results (averaged over 100 runs) are presented in Figure 3 where we evaluated MO-OGDE vs. MO-LP. The dashed green lines represent the regrets of playing fixed deterministic arms. Although MO-OGDE and MO-LP both learn to play a mixed policy that is greatly better than any individual arm, MO-OGDE is computationally much more efficient."

      "text" : "The single-objective MAB problem has been intensively studied especially in recent years (Bubeck & Cesa-Bianchi, 2012), nevertheless there is only a very limited number of work concerning the multi-objective setting. To the best of our best knowledge, Drugan & Nowé (2013) considered first the multi-objective multi-armed problem in a regret optimization framework with a stochastic assumption. Their work consists of extending the UCB algorithm (Auer et al., 2002a) so as to be able to handle multi-dimensional feedback vectors with the goal of determining all arms on the Pareto front.\nAzar et al. (2014) investigated a sequential decision making problem with vectorial feedback. In their setup the agent is allowed to choose from a finite set of actions and then it observes the vectorial feedback for each action, thus it is a full information setup unlike our setup. Moreover, the feedback is non-stochastic in their setup, as it is chosen by an adversary. They propose an algorithm that can handle a general class of aggregation functions, such as the set of bounded domain, continuous, Lipschitz and quasi-concave functions.\nIn the online convex optimization setup with multiple objectives (Mahdavi et al., 2013), the learner’s forecast x(t) is evaluated in terms of multiple convex loss functions f\n(t) 0 (x), f (t) 1 (x), . . . , f (t) K (x) in each time step t. The goal of the learner is then to minimize ∑t τ=1 f (τ) 0 (x\n(τ)) while keeping the other objectives below some predefined threshold, i.e. 1t ∑t τ=1 f (τ) i (x\n(τ)) ≤ γi for all i ∈ [K]. Note that, with linear loss functions, the multiple-objective convex optimization setup boils down to linear optimization with stochastic constraints, and thus it can be applied to solve the linear program given in Section 5 whose solution is the optimal policy in our setup. For doing this, however, each linear stochastic constraint needs to be observed, whereas we only assume bandit information.\nIn the approachability problem (Mannor et al., 2014; 2009; Abernethy et al., 2011), there are two players, say A and B. Players A and B choose actions from the compact convex sets X ⊂ RK and Y ⊂ RD, respectively. The feedback to the players is computed as a function u : X × Y 7→ Rp. A given convex set S ⊂ Rp is known to both players. Player A wants to land inside with the cumulative payoffs, i.e., player A’s goal is to minimize dist( 1T ∑T t=1 u(x (t),y(t)), S) where x(t) and y(t) are the actions chosen by player A and B respectively, and dist(s, S) = infs′∈S ‖s′ − s‖, whereas player B, called adversary, wants to prevent player A to land in set S. In our setup, Player B who generates the cost vectors, is assumed to be stochastic. The set S consists of a single value which isµα∗, and u corresponds toµIbalpha, thus p = D. What makes our setup essentially different from approachability is that, S is not known to any player. That is why Player A, i.e. the learner, needs to explore the action space which is achieved by forced exploration."

      "text" : "We introduced a new problem in the context of multiobjective multi-armed bandit (MOMAB). Contrary to most previously proposed approaches in MOMAB, we do not search for the Pareto front, instead we aim for a fair solution, which is important for instance when each objective corresponds to the payoff of a different agent. To encode fairness, we use the Generalized Gini Index (GGI), a well-known criterion developed in economics. To optimize this criterion, we proposed a gradient-based algorithm that exploits the convexity of GGI. We evaluated our algorithm on two domains and obtained promising experimental results.\nSeveral multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm have been proposed in the literature (Gábor et al., 1998; Roijers et al., 2013). Most of these methods make use of a simple linear aggregation function. As a future work, it would be interesting to extend our work to the reinforcement learning setting, which would be useful to solve the electric battery control problem even more finely."

Finally, from all the above it also follows that f is a piecewise-linear convex function with linear regions {Aπ}π, thus the minimal set ∆∗K = argminα∈∆K f(α) is a face of one of theAπ polytopes. 4 The first claim of the lemma follows.\n4See (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004) for more about piecewise-linear convex functions.\nLet ext(A) denote the extreme points of a convex polytopeA, and define\ng+ = min π min α∈ext(Aπ)\\∆∗K min α∗∈∆∗K f(α)− f(α∗) ‖α−α∗‖ .\nNote that the definition makes sense and that 0 < g+ <∞ ,\nbecause ∆∗K is bounded and convex and ext(Aπ) \\∆∗K is a finite set with no elements from ∆∗K .\nNow, choose some permutation π and some α ∈ Aπ \\ ∆∗K .

      "heading" : "G. Battery control task",
      "text" : "Efficient management of electric batteries leads to better performance and longer battery life, which is important for instance for electric vehicles whose range is still limited compared to those with petrol or diesel engines. An electric battery is composed of several cells whose capacity varies extensively due to inconsistencies in weight and volume of the active material in their individual components, different internal resistance and higher temperatures leading to different aging rates. As a consequence, the energy output at any instant is different from each cell, which results in different aging rates and ultimately leads to a premature battery failure. To address this problem, a control strategy called cell balancing is utilized, which aims at maintaining a constant energy level — mainly state-of-charge (SOC) — in each cell, while controlling for temperature and aging. Many cell-balancing controllers can be defined, depending on the importance given to the three objectives: SOC, temperature and aging. The values of those objectives should be balanced between the cells because a balanced use of all cells leads to a longer lasting system. Moreover, those objectives values should also be balanced within a cell, because for example, a cell can have higher capacity on a higher temperature, but at the same time it has a higher risk to explode.\nOur battery control task consists in learning and selecting the “best” cell balancing controller in an online fashion, so that it can dynamically adapt to the consumption profile and environment, such as outdoor temperature. In the case of electric cars, this means that the controller needs to be able to adapt to the driving habits of the driver and to the terrain, such as hilly roads or desert roads. In this experiment, our goal was more specifically to test our multi-objective online learning algorithms in the battery control task, and verify that our online learning algorithms can indeed find a policy for this control task that leads to a balanced parameter values of the cells.\nThe battery is modeled using the internal resistance (Rint) model (Johnson, 2002). The estimation of SOC is based on the Ampere Hour Counting method (Dambrowski, 2013). The variation of temperature in the system is determined according to the dissipative heat loss due to the internal resistance and thermal convection (Gao et al., 2002). Cell degradation or aging is a function of temperature, charging/discharging rates and cumulative charge (Tao, 2012). Moreover, the battery model is complemented with 10 different cell-balancing controllers. The whole model is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink software package and can emulate any virtual situation whose electric consumption is described by a time series, which is given as input to the model. In practice, such a time series would correspond to a short period of battery usage (e.g., a brief segment of a driving session). For a chosen controller, the output of the model comprises of the objective values of each battery cell at the end of the simulation. Note that the output of the battery model is a multivariate random vector since the power demand is randomized, therefore this control task can be readily accommodated into our setup. In our experiments, the battery consists of 4 cells, thusD = 12 in this case. The cell-balancing controllers correspond to the arms, thusK = 10.\nThe online learning task consists of selecting among these controllers/arms so that the final objective values are as balanced as possible. The experiment was carried out as follows: in each iteration, the learner selects a controller according to its policy, then the battery model is run with the selected controller by using a random consumption time series. At the end of the simulation, the learner receives the objective values of each cell output by the battery model as feedback and updates its policy. The goal of the learner is to find a policy over the controllers, which leads to a balanced state of cells in terms of cumulative value.\nThe results are shown in Figure 3. In this experiment we do not know the means of the arms, but we estimated them based on 100000 runs of the simulator for each arm. These mean estimates were used for computing the optimal policy and the regret. We run the MO-OGDE and MO-LP over 100 repetitions. Their average regret exhibits the same trend as in the synthetic\nexperiments: the MO-LP achieved faster convergence. The blue lines shows the regret of the pure policies, which always selects the same arm, i.e., the performance of single strategies. It is important to mention that the optimal mixed controller has a lower GGI value since the regret of any arm is positive, and more importantly, the two learners converge to optimal mixed policies in terms of regret."

The goal of the agent is to find a policy, which can optimize these objectives simultaneously in a fair way. This multi-objective online optimization problem is formalized by using the Generalized Gini Index (GGI) aggregation function. We propose an online gradient descent algorithm which exploits the convexity of the GGI aggregation function, and controls the exploration in a careful way achieving a distribution-free regret Õ(T−1/2) with high probability. We test our algorithm on synthetic data as well as on an electric battery control problem where the goal is to trade off the use of the different cells of a battery in order to balance their respective degradation rates.",
