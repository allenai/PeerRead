      "text" : "In this letter we evaluate the ability of Recurrent Neural Networks, in particular the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, to perform land cover classification considering multi-temporal spatial data derived from a time series of satellite images. We carried out experiments on two different datasets considering both pixel-based and object-based classification. The obtained results show that Recurrent Neural Networks are competitive compared to state-of-the-art classifiers, and may outperform classical approaches in presence of low represented and/or highly mixed classes. We also show that using the alternative feature representation generated by LSTM can improve the performances of standard classifiers.\nIndex Terms\nRecurrent Neural Networks, Satellite Image time series, Land Cover classification, Deep Learning.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMODERN earth observation programs produce huge volumes of remotely sensed data every day. Such information can beorganized in time series of satellite images that can be useful to monitor geographical zones through time. Efficiently manage and analyze remote sensing time series is still an open challenge in the remote sensing field [13].\nIn the context of land cover classification, exploiting time series of satellite images, instead that one single image, can be fruitful to distinguish among classes based on the fact they have different temporal profiles [1]. Despite the usefulness of temporal trends that can be derived from remote sensing time series, most of the proposed strategies [7], [12] directly apply standard machine learning approaches (i.e. Random Forest, SVM) on the stacked images. Since these approaches did not model temporal correlations, they manage features independently from each others, ignoring any temporal dependency which data may exhibit. Recently, the deep learning revolution [19] has shown that neural network models are well adapted tools to manage and automatically classify remote sensing data. While standard CNNs techniques are well suited to deal with spatial autocorrelation, the same approaches are not adapted to correctly manage long and complex temporal dependencies [3]. A family of deep learning methods especially tailored to cope with temporal correlations are Recurrent Neural Networks [3] and, in particular, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks [10]. Such models explicitly capture temporal correlations by recursion and they have already proved to be effective in different domains such as speech recognition [9], natural language processing [14], image completion [18]. Only recently, in the remote sensing field, the work proposed in [15] performs preliminary experiments with LSTM model on a (small) time series composed of only two dates to perform supervised change detection. The task was modeled as a binary classification problem (change vs. no-change). To the best of our knowledge, RNNs (i.e. LSTM) have not yet been considered to deal with land cover classification of deeper time series. Like any other deep learning model [3], LSTM can be used as a classifier itself or employed to extract new discriminative features (or representation). In the latter case the extracted features are successively used to feed a standard learning algorithm that does not consider temporal dependencies (i.e. Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVMs).\nIn this letter we evaluate the quality of RNN models - Long Short Term Memory - to deal with land cover classification via multi-temporal spatial data that are derived from SITS. More in detail, we perform experiments on two study areas: i) the THAU basin, a site located in the south of France, from which we obtain a time series of 3 dates, and ii) the REUNION ISLAND, a region of France located in the Indian Ocean (east of Madagascar) from which we derive a 23-date times series. While on the first area we conduct an object-oriented classification, on the second site we have performed a pixel-based prediction showing the general applicability of RNNs models to both object and pixel-level analysis. We also assess the RNN model (i.e. LSTM) as feature extractor evaluating the quality of the new generated features to feed the same baseline classifiers we have used as reference methods.\nD.

      "text" : "Recurrent Neural Networks are well established machine learning techniques that demonstrate their quality in different domains such as speech recognition [9], signal processing [17], natural language processing [14] and image completion [18]. Differently from standard feed forward networks (i.e. CNNs), RNNs explicitly manage temporal data dependencies since the output of the neuron at time t-1 is used, together with the next input, to feed the neuron itself at time t. A sketch of a typical RNN neuron is depicted in Figure 1.\nThe most well-known type of RNN is the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) [10] model. There are many variants of LSTM network [10] but here we refer to the architecture proposed in [8]. LSTM models were mainly introduced with the purpose to learn long term dependencies [10], since previous RNN models failed in this task due to the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients. The equations (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) formally describes the LSTM neuron while Figure 2 graphically depicts the LSTM unit. The symbol indicates an element-wise multiplication while σ and tanh represent Sigmoid and Hyperbolic Tangent respectively. The input of the LSTM is a sequence of variables (x1, ..., xN ) where a generic element xt is a feature vector and t refers to the corresponding timestamp. RNN models are able to manage variable-length data sequences.\nThe LSTM unit is composed of two cell states, the memory Ct and the hidden state ht, and three different gates, the input gate it, the forget gate ft and the output gate ot that are employed to control the flow of information. All the three gates combine the current input xt with the hidden state ht−1 coming from the previous timestamp. The gates have also two important functions: i) they regulate how much information have to be forgotten/reminded during the process; ii) they deal with the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients. We can observe that the gates are implemented by a sigmoid. This function returns values between 0 and 1 where, in this context, 0 indicates that the information is completely forgotten and 1 means that the information is completely retained.\n3 The LSTM unit uses also a temporary cell state yt that rescales the current input always taking into account the previous hidden state. This temporary cell is implemented by an hyperbolic tangent function that returns values between -1 and 1. Both sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent are applied element-wise.\nThe input gate it regulates how much of the current information needs to be maintained (it yt) while the forget gate ft indicates how much of the previous memory needs to be retained at the current step (ft ct−1). Finally, the output gate impacts on the new hidden state ht deciding how much information of the current memory will be outputted to the next step. The different W∗∗ matrices and bias coefficients b∗ are the parameters learned during the training of the model. Both, the memory Ct and the hidden state ht are forwarded to the next time step.\nit = σ(Wixxt +Wihht−1 + bi) (1) ft = σ(Wfxxt +Wfhht−1 + bf ) (2)\nyt = tanh(Wyxxt +Wyhht−1 + by) (3) ct = it yt + ft ct−1 (4)\not = σ(Woxxt +Wohht−1 + bo) (5) ht = ot tanh(ct) (6)"

      "text" : "The LSTM neuron learns an internal representation of the input sequences (in our case objects or pixels time series) but it does not make any prediction by itself. To perform the classification task, we stack on top of the LSTM neuron a SoftMax layer [9] to accomplish the final multi-class prediction. The SoftMax layer has as many neurons as the number of the classes to predict. We choose SoftMax instead of Sigmoid function because the value of the SoftMax layer can be seen as a probability distribution over the classes that sum to 1 while each of the Sigmoid neurons can output a value between 0 and 1. This is due to the fact that, for the SoftMax neuron, the values are normalized per layer while no normalization is performed in the case of Sigmoid layer. This is why, in our context (multi-class prediction), we prefer the SoftMax instead of Sigmoid layer since we know that our samples exclusively belong to a single class. From an architectural point of view, the connection between the LSTM and the SoftMax layer is realized fully connecting the last hidden state vector produced by the LSTM unit with the SoftMax neurons."

More in detail, we propose to employ the last hidden state vector, produced by the LSTM unit, as new data representation and, successively, train standard machine learning classifiers over such new set of features."

      "text" : "We compare the LSTM-based Time Series Classification model to standard machine learning approaches commonly employed to perform land cover classification from multi-temporal spatial data [7], [12]. We also assess the value of the representation learned by the proposed model following the idea described in Section II-C.\nTo our purpose, we use Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as standard classification strategies. For the RF model, we set the number of generated trees equals to 400 and we allow a maximum tree depth of 10. For the SVM model we use RBF kernel with complexity parameter and gamma equal to 100 and 0.01 respectively. For Random Forest we used the python implementation supplied by the Scikit-learn library [16] while for SVM we use the LibSVM implementation [4]. The same RF and SVM settings are used for both original data and the new representation learned by the LSTM-Based Time Series Classification model. For the latter, we set the number of hidden dimensions equal to 512, an initial learning rate equals to 5× 10−4 and a decay of 5× 10−5. We implement the model via the Keras python library [5] with Theano as back end. We used as optimization method the RMSprop strategy that is commonly employed to train LSTM units [6]. The model is trained for 200 epochs with a batch size equals to 20. We named RF(LSTM) (resp. SVM(LSTM)) the Random Forest (resp. SVM) learned over the new feature space induced by our RNN model. More in detail, each training and test instance is transformed\n1The source data are provided by the French Pôle Thématique Surfaces Continentales THEIA (www.theia-land.fr) and preprocessed by the Multi-sensor Atmospheric Correction and Cloud Screening (MACCS) level 2A processor [11] developed at the French National Space Agency (CNES) to provide accurate atmospheric, environmental and geometric corrections as well as precise cloud masks.\n5 in a 512 feature vector (the dimension of the hidden state of the LSTM neuron) and, successively, the classifiers are learned from this new representation instead of the original data.\nTo validate the different methods, we perform a 5-fold cross validation. Due to the unbalanced nature of the two time series datasets, in order to assess classification performances we use not only the Global Accuracy and Kappa measures, but we also provide average and per-class F-Measure."

      "heading" : "B. Results and Discussions",
      "text" : "The Tables III and IV and Figures 3 and 4 summarize the results we have obtained on the two SITS datasets. Considering the THAU dataset, Table III depicts the average values of Accuracy, F-Measure and Kappa for the different methods. We can observe that the LSTM-based classifier outperforms both RF and SVM approaches regarding all the three metrics. The more important gain is reached when the average F-Measure is taken into account, the LSTM-based classifier obtaining a score of 74.63% while the second best method (SVM(LSTM)) attains a score equals to 73.31%. Interestingly, we can also highlight that, for the THAU dataset, the classifiers trained on the features (representation) learned by the Recurrent Neural Network RF(LSTM) and SVM(LSTM) exhibit better performances than the same classifiers coupled with the original time series data when the F-Measure is considered. In terms of Accuracy, the behavior is comparable considering the SVM vs SVM(LSTM) while the RF model clearly benefit of the new data representation.\nA more detailed assessment is provided in Figure 3 where the per-class F-Measure is reported. The first point we can highlight is that, for classes with few reference samples (i.e. (1),(4),(8), (9) and (10)), the LSTM network neatly outperforms standard approaches, which in some cases (i.e. (1) and (4)) completely miss the classes, while it obtains similar or slightly better results w.r.t. RF and SVM for well represented classes. The second point is related to the comparison between standard approaches trained on the original data and the same methods powered by features learned by our proposal. We can see that the use of the new learned representation improves the performances of both RF and SVM. Again, this fact is particularly evident on critical classes like (1), (4), (8) (for SVM) and (10) (for RF).\nTable IV summarizes the results on the REUNION ISLAND time series dataset. Similarly to the previous case, the LSTMbased classifier behaves better than the standard machine learning methods considering Accuracy and F-Measure; still in accord with the previous results, also the classifiers trained on the new features, obtained by the proposed network, outperform their counterparts trained on the original feature space. Conversely to the previous experiment, in this case the highest value of F-Measure is reached by the SVM(LSTM) but we can observe that the LSTM-based classifier still reaches competitive results. Figure 4 reports the per-class F-Measure results on the REUNION ISLAND dataset. Also in this case we can note that the LSTM-based approach works well for low represented and difficult classes (i.e. (8) - ”Other Crops”) and it remains competitive on all the other classes.\nAs expected, the combined optimization and learning of a new feature representation along with classification, proper to all deep learning approaches, provides here a better support to discriminate among the different classes. In addition, all these results indicate that the LSTM model is well suited to capture long-short temporal dependencies as opposed to common classification approaches where all the information are managed at the same level forgetting temporal correlations. This is particularly evident on low represented and highly mixed classes: Tree Crops, Summer crops and Truck Farming (resp. Other Crops) for the THAU (resp. REUNION ISLAND) dataset. All these classes are related to agricultural activities whose time patterns are strongly varying due to the heterogeneity of practices, which make the corresponding classes detectable only considering short portions of the time series in which crop conditions are comparable.\nWe remind that our proposal uses only one LSTM layer while more layers can be stacked together to build more complex architectures [9]. This is out of our scope and we leave this point for future researches, since our main objective is to highlight the quality and the suitableness of RNNs methods to manage and analyze SITS data."

How to efficiently analyze such kind of information is still an open question in the remote sensing field. Recently, deep learning methods proved suitable to deal with remote sensing data mainly for scene classification (i.e. Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs on single images) while only very few studies exist involving temporal deep learning approaches (i.e Recurrent Neural Networks RNNs) to deal with remote sensing time series. In this letter we evaluate the ability of Recurrent Neural Networks, in particular the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, to perform land cover classification considering multi-temporal spatial data derived from a time series of satellite images. We carried out experiments on two different datasets considering both pixel-based and object-based classification. The obtained results show that Recurrent Neural Networks are competitive compared to state-of-the-art classifiers, and may outperform classical approaches in presence of low represented and/or highly mixed classes. We also show that using the alternative feature representation generated by LSTM can improve the performances of standard classifiers.",
