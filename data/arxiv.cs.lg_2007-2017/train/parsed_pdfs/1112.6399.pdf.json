      "text" : "Recently, there has been much interest in spectral approaches to learning manifolds— so-called kernel eigenmap methods. These methods have had some successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning problems together and allowing information to flow between them, two-manifold algorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same way that an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a linear dimensionality reduction problem. We propose a class of algorithms for two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance operators in Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss situations where two-manifold problems are useful, and demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data."

      "text" : "Manifold learning algorithms are non-linear methods for embedding a set of data points into a lowdimensional space while preserving local geometry. Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in spectral approaches to learning manifolds. These kernel eigenmap methods include Isomap [1], Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) [2], Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) [3], Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) [4], and Maximum Entropy Unfolding (MEU) [5]. These\napproaches can be viewed as kernel principal component analysis [6] with specific choices of manifold kernels [7]: they seek a small set of latent variables that, through a nonlinear mapping, explains the observed high-dimensional data.\nDespite the popularity of kernel eigenmap methods, they are limited in one important respect: they generally only perform well when there is little or no noise. Several authors have attacked this problem using methods including neighborhood smoothing [8] and robust principal components analysis [9, 10], with some success under limited noise. Unfortunately, the problem is fundamentally ill posed without some sort of side information about the true underlying signal: by design, manifold methods will recover extra latent dimensions which “explain” the noise.\nWe take a different approach to the problem of learning manifolds from noisy observations. We assume access to a set of instrumental variables: variables that are correlated with the true latent variables, but uncorrelated with the noise in observations. Such instrumental variables can be used to separate signal from noise, as described in Section 3. Instrumental variables have been used to allow consistent estimation of model parameters in many statistical learning problems, including linear regression [11], principal component analysis [12], and temporal difference learning [13]. Here we extend the scope of this technique to manifold learning. We will pay particular attention to the case of observations from two manifolds, each of which can serve as instruments for the other. We call such problems two-manifold problems.\nIn one-manifold problems, when the noise variance is significant compared to the manifold’s geometry, kernel eigenmap methods are biased: they will fail to recover the true manifold, even in the limit of infinite data. Two-manifold methods, by contrast, can succeed in this case: we propose algorithms based on spectral decompositions related to cross-covariance operators in a tensor product space of two different manifold\nar X\niv :1\n11 2.\n63 99\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 9\nD ec\n2 01\nkernels, and show that the instrumental variable idea suppresses noise in practice. We also examine some theoretical properties of two-manifold methods: we argue consistency for a special case in Sec. 3.2.3, but we leave a full theoretical analysis of these algorithms to future work.\nThe benefits of the spectral approach to two-manifold problems are significant: first, the spectral decomposition naturally solves the manifold alignment problem by finding low-dimensional manifolds (defined by the left and right eigenvectors) that explain both sets of observations. Second, the connection between manifolds and covariance operators opens the door to solving more-sophisticated machine learning problems with manifolds, including nonlinear analogs of canonical correlations analysis (CCA) and reduced-rank regression (RRR).\nAs an example of this last point, subspace identification approaches to learning non-linear dynamical systems depend critically on instrumental variables and the spectral decomposition of (potentially infinitedimensional) covariance operators [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Two-manifold problems are a natural fit: by relating the spectral decomposition to our two-manifold method, subspace identification techniques can be forced to identify a manifold state space, and consequently, to learn a dynamical system that is both accurate and interpretable, outperforming the current state of the art."

If the features are sufficiently expressive, kernel PCA can find structure that regular PCA misses. However, if F is high- or infinite-dimensional, the straightforward approach to PCA, via an eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix, is in general intractable. Kernel PCA overcomes this problem by assuming that F is a reproducing-kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and that the feature mapping φ is implicitly defined via an efficiently-computable kernel function K(x,x′) = 〈φ(x), φ(x′)〉F . Popular kernels include the linear kernel K(x,x′) = x ·x′ (which identifies the fea-\nture space with the input space) and the RBF kernel K(x,x′) = exp(−γ‖x− x′‖2/2).\nConceptually, if we define an infinitely-tall “matrix” with columns φ(xi), Φ = (φ(x1), . . . , φ(xn)), our goal is to recover the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the centered covariance operator Σ̂XX = 1 nΦHΦ T, where H is the centering matrix H = In − 1n11 T. To avoid working with the high- or infinite-dimensional covariance operator, we instead define the Gram matrix G = 1nΦ TΦ. The nonzero eigenvalues of the centered covariance Σ̂XX are the same as those of the centered Gram matrix HGH. And, the corresponding unitlength eigenvectors of Σ̂XX are given by ΦHviλ −1/2 i , where λi and vi are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of HGH [6]. If data weights P (a diagonal matrix) are present, we can instead decompose the weighted centered Gram matrix PHGHP. (Note that, perhaps confusingly, we center first and multiply by the weights only after centering; the reason for this order will become clear below, in Section 2.2.)"

      "text" : "Spectral algorithms for manifold learning, sometimes called kernel eigenmap methods, include Isomap [1], Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) [2], Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) [3], and Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) [4]. These methods seek a nonlinear function that maps a high-dimensional set of data points to a lower-dimensional space while preserving the manifold on which the data lies. The main insight behind these methods is that large distances in input space are often meaningless due to the large-scale curvature of the manifold; so, ignoring these distances can lead to a significant improvement in dimensionality reduction by “unfolding” the manifold.\nInterestingly, these algorithms can be viewed as special cases of kernel PCA where the Gram matrix G is constructed over the finite domain of the training data in a particular way [7]. Specifically, kernel eigenmap methods first induce a neighborhood structure on the data, capturing a notion of local geometry via a graph, where nodes are data points and edges are neighborhood relations. Then they solve an eigenvalue or related problem based on the graph to embed the data into a lower dimensional space while preserving the local relationships. Here we just describe LE; the other methods have a similar intuition, although the details and performance characteristics differ.\nIn LE, neighborhoods are summarized by an adjacency matrix W, computed by nearest neighbors: element wi,j is nonzero whenever the ith point is one of the nearest neighbors of the jth point, or vice versa. Non-zero weights are typically either set to\n1 or computed according to a Gaussian RBF kernel: wi,j = exp(−γ‖xi − xj‖2/2). Now let Si,i = ∑ j wi,j , and set C = S−1/2(W − S)S−1/2. Finally, eigendecompose C to get a low dimensional embedding of the data points, discarding the top eigenvector (which is trivial): if C = VΛVT, the embedding is S1/2V2:k+1. To relate LE to kernel PCA, note that G = W − S is already centered, i.e., G = HGH. So, we can view LE as performing weighted kernel PCA, with Gram matrix G and data weights P = S−1/2.1,2,3\nThe weighted Gram matrix C can be related to a random walk on the graph defined by W: if we add the identity and make a similarity transform (both operations that preserve the eigensystem), we get S−1/2(C + I)S 1/2\n= S−1W, a stochastic transition matrix for the walk. So, Laplacian eigenmaps can be viewed as trying to keep points close together when they are connected by many short paths in our graph."

In practice, however, observations are frequently noisy. Depending on the nature of the noise, manifold-learning algorithms applied to these datasets produce biased embeddings. See Figures 1–2, the “noisy swiss rolls,” for an example of how noise can bias manifold learning algorithms.\nTo see why, we examine PCA, a special case of manifold learning methods, and look at why it produces biased embeddings in the presence of noise. We first show how overcome this problem in the linear case, and\n1The original algorithm actually looks for the smallest eigenvalues of −C, which is equivalent. The matrix −G = S−W is the graph Laplacian for our neighborhood graph, and −C is the weighted graph Laplacian—hence the algorithm name “Laplacian eigenmaps.”\n2The centering step is vestigial: we can include it, C = S−1/2H(W − S)HS−1/2, but it has no effect. The discarded eigenvector (which corresponds to eigenvalue 0 and to a constant coordinate in the embedding) similarly is vestigial: we can discard it or not, and it doesn’t affect pairwise distances among embedded points. Interestingly, previous papers on the connection between Laplacian eigenmaps and the other algorithms mentioned here seem to contain an imprecision: they typically connect dropping the top (trivial) eigenvector with the centering step—e.g., see [5].\n3A minor difference is that LE does not scale its embedding using the eigenvalues of G; the related diffusion maps algorithm [19] does.\nthen use these same ideas to fix kernel PCA, a nonlinear algorithm. Finally, in Sec. 4, we extend these ideas to fully general kernel eigenmap methods."

This method finds a statistically consistent solution through the use of an instrumental variable [11, 12], an observation yi that is correlated with the true latent variables, but uncorrelated with the noise in xi.\nImportantly, picking an instrumental variable is not merely a statistical aid, but rather a value judgement about the nature of the latent variable and the noise in the observations. In particular, we are defining the noise to be that part of the variability which is uncorrelated with the instrumental variable, and the signal to be that part which is correlated.\nIn our example above, a good instrumental variable yi is a different (noisy) view of the same underlying low-dimensional latent variable: yi = Nzi + ζi for some full-column-rank linear transformation N and i.i.d. zero-mean noise term ζi. The expectation of the empirical cross covariance Σ̂XY = 1 nXY\nT is then M Cov(zi) N\nT: the noise terms, being independent and zero-mean, cancel out. (And the variance of each element of Σ̂XY goes to 0 as n→∞.)\nIn this case, we can identify the embedding by computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the covariance: let UDVT = Σ̂XY , where U and V are orthonormal and D is diagonal. To reduce noise, we can keep just the columns of U, D, and V which correspond to the top k largest singular values (diagonal entries of D): 〈U,D,V〉 = SVD(Σ̂XY , k). If we set k to be the true dimension of z, then as n→∞, U will\nconverge to an orthonormal basis for the range of M, and V will converge to an orthonormal basis for the range of N. The corresponding embeddings are then given by UTX and VTY.\nInterestingly, we can equally well view xi as an instrumental variable for yi: we simultaneously find consistent embeddings of both xi and yi, using each to unbias the other."

For example, in reduced-rank regression [20, 12], we want to estimate E [xi | yi]. Define Σ̂Y Y = 1 nYY T and Σ̂XY = 1 nXY T. Then the ordinary regression of Y on X is Σ̂XY (Σ̂Y Y + ηI) −1Y, where the regularization term ηI (η > 0) ensures that the matrix inverse is well-defined. For a reduced-rank regression, we instead project onto the set of rank-k matrices: 〈U,D,V〉 = SVD(Σ̂XY (Σ̂Y Y + ηI)−1Y, k). In our example above, so long as we let η → 0 as n→∞, U will again converge to an orthonormal basis for the range of M.\nTo connect back to two-subspace PCA, we can show that RRR is the same as two-subspace PCA if we first whiten Y. That is, we can equivalently define U for RRR to be the top k left singular vectors of the covariance between X and the whitened instruments Yw = (Σ̂Y Y + ηI)\n−1/2Y. (Here, A1/2 stands for the symmetric square root of A, which is guaranteed to exist and be invertible if A is symmetric and positive definite.) Whitening means transforming a covariance matrix toward the identity: if η = 0 and Σ̂Y Y has full rank, then E[YwYTw] = Σ̂ −1/2 Y Y Σ̂Y Y Σ̂ −1/2 Y Y = I, while if η is near 0, then E[YwYTw] ≈ I.\nFor symmetry, we can whiten both X and Y before computing their covariance. An SVD of the resulting doubly-whitened cross-covariance matrix (Σ̂XX + ηI)−1/2Σ̂XY (Σ̂Y Y + ηI)\n−1/2 is called canonical correlation analysis [21], and the resulting singular values are called canonical correlations."

We assume noisy observations xi = f(zi)+ i, where zi is the desired low-dimensional latent variable, i is an i.i.d. noise term, and f is a smooth function with smooth inverse (so that f(zi) lies on a manifold). Our goal is to recover f and zi up to identifiability.\nKernel PCA (Sec. 2.1) is a common approach to this problem. In the realizable case, kernel PCA gets the right answer: that is, suppose that zi has dimension k, and that we have at least k independent samples. And, suppose that φ(f(z)) is a linear function of z. Then, the Gram matrix or the covariance “matrix” will have rank k, and we can reconstruct a basis for the range of φ ◦ f from the top k eigenvectors of the Gram matrix. (Similarly, if φ ◦ f is near linear and the variance of i is small, we can expect kernel PCA to work well, if not perfectly.)\nHowever, just as PCA recovers a biased answer in the finite dimensional case when the variance of i is nonzero, kernel PCA will also recover a biased answer in this case, even in the limit of infinite data. The bias of kernel PCA follows immediately from the example at the beginning of Section 3: if we use a linear kernel, kernel PCA will simply reproduce the bias of ordinary PCA."

Given a joint distribution P[X,Y ] over two variables X on X and Y on Y, with feature maps φ and υ (corresponding to kernels Kx and Ky), the cross-covariance operator ΣXY is E[φ(x) ⊗ υ(y)]. The cross-covariance operator reduces to an ordinary cross-covariance matrix in the finite-dimensional case; in the infinite-dimensional case, it can be viewed as a kernel mean map descriptor [22] for the joint distribution P[X,Y ].\nThe concept of a cross-covariance operator is helpful because it allows us to extend the methods of instrumental variables to infinite dimensional RKHSs. In our example above, a good instrumental variable yi is a different (noisy) view of the same underlying lowdimensional latent variable: yi = g(zi) + ζi for some smoothly invertible function g and i.i.d. zero-mean noise term ζi.\nWe proceed now to derive the kernel SVD for a crosscovariance operator.4 We show below (Sec. 3.2.3) that the kernel SVD of the cross-covariance operator leads to a consistent estimate of the shared latent variables in two-manifold problems which satisfy appropriate assumptions.\n4The kernel SVD algorithm previously appeared as an intermediate step in [17, 23]; here we generalize the algorithm to weighted cross covariance operators in Hilbert space and give a more complete description, both because the method is interesting in its own right, and because this generalized SVD will serve as a step in our two-manifold algorithms.\nConceptually, our inputs are “matrices” Φ and Υ whose columns are respectively φ(xi) and υ(yi), along with data weights PX and PY .

(If our training data consists of a single long sequence of observations, we can collect our sample by picking n random time steps t1, . . . , tn. Each sample xi is then a sequence of obser-\nvations starting at time ti.) We would then construct a Gram matrix GX , whose (i, j) element is Kx(xi,xj). Finally, we would find the eigendecomposition of the centered Gram matrix BX = HGXH as in Section 2.1. The resulting embedding coordinates would be tuned to predict future observations well, and so could be viewed as a good state space.\nHowever, the state space found by kernel PCA is biased : it typically includes noise, information that cannot be predicted from past observations. We would like instead to find a low dimensional state space that embeds the probability distribution of possible futures conditioned on the past. In particular, we want to find a state space that is uncorrelated with the noise in the future observations. From a two-manifold perspective, we view features of the past as instrumental variables to unbias the future.\nTherefore, in addition to sampling sequences of future observations, we sample corresponding sequences of past observations y1, . . . ,yn ∈ Rd2 : sequence yi ends at time ti− 1. We then construct a Gram matrix GY , whose (i, j) element is Ky(yi,yj). From GY we construct the centered Gram matrix BY = HGY H. Finally, we identify the state space using a kernel SVD as in Section 3.2.3: 〈U,Λ,VT〉 = SVD(BXBY , k) (there are no data weights for HSE-HMMs). The left singular “vectors” (reconstructed from U as in Section 3.2.3) now identify a subspace in which the system evolves. From this subspace, we can proceed to identify the parameters of the dynamical system as in Song et al. [17].7"

      "text" : "In contrast with HSE-HMMs, we are interested in modeling a dynamical system whose state space lies on a low-dimensional manifold, even if this manifold is curved to occupy a higher-dimensional subspace (an example is given in Section 5.3, below). We want to use this additional knowledge to constrain the learning algorithm and produce a more accurate model for a given amount of training data.\nTo do so, we replace the kernel SVD by a two-manifold method. That is, we learn weighted centered Gram matrices CX and CY for the future and past observations, using a manifold method like LE or LLE (see Section 2.2). Then we apply a SVD to CXCY in order to recover the latent state space.\n7Other approaches such as CCA and RRR have also been successfully used for finite-dimensional spectral learning algorithms [18], suggesting that kernel SVD could be replaced by kernel CCA or kernel RRR (Section 3.2.4)."

      "text" : "Here we look at the problem of tracking and predicting the position of a slotcar with attached inertial measurement unit (IMU) racing around a track. The setup consisted of a track and a miniature car (1:32 scale model) guided by a slot cut into the track. Figure 3(A) shows setup. At a rate of 10Hz, we extracted the estimated 3-D acceleration and angular velocity of the car. An overhead camera also supplied estimates of the 2-dimensional location of the car.\nWe collected 3000 successive observations while the slot car circled the track controlled by a constant policy (with varying speeds). The goal was to learn a dynamical model of the noisy IMU data, and, after filtering, to predict current and future 2-dimensional locations. We used the first 2000 data points as training data, and held out the last 500 data points for testing the learned models. We trained four models, and evaluated these models based on prediction accuracy, and, where appropriate, the learned latent state.\nFirst, we trained a 20-dimensional embedded HMM with the spectral algorithm of Song et al. [17], using sequences of 150 consecutive observations. Following Song et al., we used Gaussian RBF kernels, setting the bandwidth parameter with the “median trick”, and using regularization parameter λ = 10−4. Second, we trained a similar 20-dimensional embedded HMM with LE kernels. The number of nearest neighbors was selected to be 50, and the other parameters were set to be identical to the first model. (So, the only difference is that the first model performs a kernel SVD to find the subspace on which the dynamical system evolves, while the second model solves a two-manifold problem.) Third, for comparison’s sake, we trained a 20-dimensional Kalman filter using the N4SID algorithm [26] with Hankel matrices of 150 time steps; and finally, we learned a 20-state discrete HMM (with 400 levels of discretization for observations) using the EM algorithm.\nBefore investigating the predictive accuracy of the learned dynamical systems, we looked at the learned state space of the first three models. These models differ mainly in their kernel: Gaussian RBF, learned manifold from Laplacian Eigenmaps, or linear. As a test, we tried to reconstruct the 2-dimensional locations of the car from each of the three latent state spaces: the more accurate the learned state space, the better we expect to be able to reconstruct the locations. Results are shown in Figure 3(B); the learned manifold is the clear winner.\nFinally we examined the prediction accuracy of each model. We performed filtering for different extents t1 = 100, . . . , 350, then predicted the car location for\na further t2 steps in the future, for t2 = 1, . . . , 100. The root mean squared error of this prediction in the 2-dimensional location space is plotted in Figure 3(C). The Manifold HMM learned by the method detailed in Section 5.2 consistently yields lower prediction error for the duration of the prediction horizon. This is important: not only does the manifold HSE-HMM provide a model that better visualizes the data that we want to predict, but it is significantly more accurate when filtering and predicting than classic and state-ofthe-art alternatives."

      "heading" : "6 Related Work",
      "text" : "While preparing this manuscript, we learned of the simultaneous and independent work of Mahadevan et al. [27]. This paper defines one particular two-manifold algorithm, maximum covariance unfolding (MCU), by extending maximum variance unfolding; but, it does not discuss how to extend other one-manifold methods. It also does not discuss any asymptotic properties of the MCU method, such as consistency.\nA similar problem to the two-manifold problem is manifold alignment [28, 29], which builds connections between two or more data sets by aligning their underlying manifolds. Generally, manifold alignment algorithms either first learn the manifolds separately and then attempt to align them based on their lowdimensional geometric properties, or they take the union of several manifolds and attempt to learn a\nlatent space that preserves the geometry of all of them [29]. Our aim is different: we assume paired data, where manifold alignments do not; and, we focus on learning algorithms that simultaneously discover manifold structure (as kernel eigenmap methods do) and connections between manifolds (as provided by, e.g., a top-level learning problem defined between two manifolds).\nThis type of interconnected learning problem has been explored before in a different context via reduced-rank regression (RRR) [30, 31, 20] and sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) [32, 33, 34]. RRR is a linear regression method that attempts to estimate a set of coefficients β to predict response vectors yi from covariate vectors xi under the constraint that β is low rank (and can therefore be factored). In SDR, the goal is to find a linear subspace of covariates xi that makes response vectors yi conditionally independent of the xis. The formulation is in terms of conditional independence, and, unlike in RRR, no assumption is made on the form of the regression from xi to yi. Unfortunately, SDR pays a price for the relaxation of the linear assumption: the solution to SDR problems usually requires a difficult non-linear non-convex optimization.\nManifold kernel dimension reduction [35], finds an embedding of covariates xi using a kernel eigenmap method, and then attempts to find a linear transformation of some of the dimensions of the embedded points to predict response variables yi. The response variables are constrained to be linear in the manifold,\nso the problem is quite different from a two-manifold problem.\nThere has also been some work on finding a mapping between manifolds [36] and learning a dynamical system on a manifold [37]; however, in both of these cases it was assumed that the manifold was known.\nFinally, some authors have focused on the problem of combining manifold learning algorithms with system identification algorithms. For example, Lewandowski et al. [38] introduces Laplacian eigenmaps that accommodate time series data by picking neighbors based on temporal ordering. Lin et al. [39] and Li et al. [40] propose learning a piecewise linear model that approximates a non-linear manifold and then attempt to learn the dynamics in the low-dimensional space. Although these methods do a qualitatively reasonable job of constructing a manifold, none of these papers compares the predictive accuracy of its model to state-of-the-art dynamical system identification algorithms."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper we propose a class of problems called twomanifold problems, where two sets of corresponding data points, generated from a single latent manifold and corrupted by noise, lie on or near two different higher dimensional manifolds. We design algorithms by relating two-manifold problems to cross-covariance operators in RKHSs, and show that these algorithms result in a significant improvement over standard manifold learning approaches in the presence of noise. This is an appealing result: manifold learning algorithms typically assume that observations are (close to) noiseless, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the utility of twomanifold problems by extending a recent dynamical system identification algorithm to learn a system with a state space that lies on a manifold. The resulting algorithm learns a model that outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of predictive accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first combination of system identification and manifold learning that accurately identifies a latent time series manifold and is competitive with the best system identification algorithms at learning accurate predictive models."

These methods have had some successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning problems together and allowing information to flow between them, two-manifold algorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same way that an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a linear dimensionality reduction problem. We propose a class of algorithms for two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance operators in Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss situations where two-manifold problems are useful, and demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data.",
