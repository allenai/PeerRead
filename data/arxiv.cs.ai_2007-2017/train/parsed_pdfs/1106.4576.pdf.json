      "text" : "The task of expert-guided subgroup dis overy addressed in this work di ers slightly from the subgroup dis overy task de ned in Se tion 1 and proposed by (Kl osgen, 1996; Wrobel, 1997). Instead of de ning an optimal measure for automated subgroup sear h and sele tion, here the goal is to support the expert in performing exible and e e tive sear h of a broad range of optimal solutions. As a onsequen e, the de ision of whi h subgroups will be sele ted to form the nal solution is left to the expert. The task of the subgroup dis overy algorithm is to enable the dete tion of rules des ribing potentially optimal subgroups, whi h are hara terized by the property that they are orre t for many target lass ases (patients with oronary heart disease, in the example domain used in this work) and in orre t for all, or most of, non-target lass ases (healthy subje ts). Target lass ases in luded into a subgroup are alled true positives while non-target lass ases in orre tly in luded into a subgroup are alled false positives.\nThe parti ular expert-guided subgroup dis overy task addressed in this work assumes the ollaboration of the expert and the data analyst in repeatedly running a subgroup dis overy algorithm with a goal of nding rules des ribing population subgroups whi h:\nhave suÆ iently large overage,\nhave a positive bias towards target lass ase overage (have a suÆ iently large true positive/false positive ratio)\nare suÆ iently diverse for dete ting most of the target population, and\nful ll other experts' subje tive measures of a eptability: understandability, simpli ity and a tionability.\nIn ea h iteration, the task of the subgroup dis overy algorithm is to suggest one or more potentially optimal solutions.

Sin e many of the indu ed rules an be very similar, both in terms of their overage and the sele ted features, the RSS algorithm des ribed in Se tion 2.3 an be used to sele t a small number of distin t rules that are o ered to the expert as potentially optimal solutions. Alternatively, subgroup dis overy an be implemented within a `weighted' overing algorithm DMS, as is the ase in the publi ly available Data Mining Server (Gamberger & Smu , 2001), whi h generates up to three best subgroups in every iteration."

High quality rules over many target lass examples and a low number of non-target examples. The number of tolerated non-target lass ases, relative to the number of overed target lass ases, is determined by parameter g. For low g (g 1), indu ed rules will have high spe i ity (low false alarm rate) sin e overing of every single non-target lass example is made relatively very `expensive'. On the other hand, by sele ting a high g value (g > 10 for small domains), more general rules will be generated, overing also non-target lass instan es.\nAlgorithm SD: Subgroup Dis overy Input: E = P [N (E training set, jEj training set size,\nP positive (target lass) examples, N negative (non-target lass) examples)\nL set of all de ned features (attribute values), l 2 L\nParameter: g (generalization parameter, 0:1 < g, default value 1)\nmin support (minimal support for rule a eptan e) beam width (maximal number of rules in Beam and New Beam)\nOutput: S = fTargetClass Condg (set of rules formed of beam width best onditions Cond) (1) for all rules in Beam and New Beam (i = 1 to beam width) do\ninitialize ondition part of the rule to be empty, Cond(i) fg initialize rule quality, q\ng\n(i) 0\n(2) while there are improvements in Beam do (3) for all rules in Beam (i = 1 to beam width) do (4) for all l 2 L do (5) form a new rule by forming a new ondition as a onjun tion of the\nVarying the value of g enables the expert to guide subgroup dis overy in the TP=FP spa e, in whi h FP (plotted on the X-axis) needs to be minimized, and TP (plotted on the Y -axis) needs to be maximized. The TP=FP spa e is similar to the ROC (Re eiver Operating Chara teristi ) spa e (Provost & Faw ett, 2001). The omparison of the ROC and TP=FP spa e and the g\nq\nheuristi are analyzed in detail in Se tions 2.4 and 4, respe tively.\nAlgorithm SD takes as its input the omplete training set E and the feature set L, where features l 2 L are logi al onditions onstru ted from attribute values des ribing the examples in E. For dis rete ( ategori al) attributes, features have the form Attribute = value or Attribute 6= value, for numeri al attributes they have the form Attribute > value or Attribute < value. To formalize feature onstru tion, let values v\nix\n(x = 1::k\nip\n) denote\nthe k\nip\ndi erent values of attribute A\ni\nthat appear in the positive examples and w\niy\n(y =\n1::k\nin\n) the k\nin\ndi erent values of A\ni\nappearing in the negative examples. A set of features\nL is onstru ted as follows:\nFor dis rete attributes A\ni\n, features of the form A\ni\n= v\nix\nand A\ni\n6= w\niy\nare generated.\nFor ontinuous attributes A\ni\n, similar to Fayyad and Irani (1992), features of the form\nA\ni\n(v\nix\n+ w\niy\n)=2 are reated for all neighboring value pairs (v\nix\n; w\niy\n), and features\nA\ni\n> (v\nix\n+ w\niy\n)=2 for all neighboring pairs (w\niy\n; v\nix\n).\nFor integer valued attributes A\ni\n, features are generated as if A\ni\nwere both dis rete\nand ontinuous, resulting in features of four di erent forms: A\ni\n(v\nix\n+ w\niy\n)=2,\nA\ni\n> (v\nix\n+ w\niy\n)=2, A\ni\n= v\nix\n, and A\ni\n6= w\niy\n.\nThere is no theoreti al upper value for the user-re ned g parameter, but in pra ti e the suggested upper limit should not ex eed the number of training examples. For instan e, suggested g values in the Data Mining Server are in the range between 0.1 and 100, for analysing data sets of up to 250 examples. The hoi e of g should be adjusted both to the size of the data set and to the proportion of positive examples in the set.\nAlgorithm SD has two additional parameters whi h are typi ally not adjusted by the\nuser. The rst is min support (default value is\np\nP=E, where P is the number of target\nlass examples in E) whi h indire tly de nes the minimal number of target lass examples whi h must be overed by every subgroup. The se ond is beam width (default value is 20) whi h de nes the number of solutions kept in ea h iteration. The output of the algorithm is set S of beam width di erent rules with highest q\ng\nvalues. The rules have the form of\nonjun tions of features from L.\nThe algorithm initializes all the rules in Beam and New beam by empty rule onditions.\nTheir quality values q\ng\n(i) are set to zero (step 1). Rule initialization is followed by an in nite\nloop (steps 2{12) that stops when, for all rules in the beam, it is no longer possible to further improve their quality. Rules an be improved only by onjun tively adding features from L. After the rst iteration, a rule ondition onsists of a single feature, after the se ond iteration up to two features, and so forth. The sear h is systemati in the sense that for all rules in the beam (step 3) all features from L (step 4) are tested in ea h iteration. For every new rule, onstru ted by onjun tively adding a feature to rule body (step 5) quality q\ng\nis omputed (step 6). If the support of the new rule is greater than min support and\nif its quality q\ng\nis greater than the quality of any rule in New beam, the worst rule in\nNew beam is repla ed by the new rule. The rules are reordered in New beam a ording to their quality q\ng\n. At the end of ea h iteration, New beam is opied into Beam (step 11).\nWhen the algorithm terminates, the rst rule in Beam is the rule with maximum q\ng\n.\nA ne essary ondition (in step 7) for a rule to be in luded in New beam is that it must be relevant. The new rule is irrelevant if there exists a rule R in New beam su h that true positives of the new rule are a subset of true positives of R and false positives of the new rule\nare a superset of false positives of R. A detailed analysis of relevan e, presented by Lavra , Gamberger, and Turney (1998), is out of the main s ope of this paper. After the new rule is in luded in New beam it may happen that some of the existing rules in New beam be ome irrelevant with respe t to this new rule. Su h rules are eliminated from New beam during its reordering (in step 8). The testing of relevan e ensures that New beam ontains only di erent and relevant rules.\nIn Algorithm SD, rule quality measure q\ng\nserves two purposes: rst, rule evaluation, and\nse ond, evaluation of features and their onjun tions with high potential for the onstru tion of high quality rules in subsequent iterations. The analysis of this quality measure in Se tion 4 shows that for the rst purpose, a measure assigning di erent osts to false positives and false negatives ould perform equally well, but for the purpose of guiding the sear h the q\ng\nmeasure is advantageous."

Redu ing the rule set is desirable be ause expe ting experts to evaluate a large set of rules is unfeasible, and se ond, experiments demonstrate that there are subsets of very similar rules whi h use almost the same attribute values and have similar predi tion properties.\nThe weighted overing approa h proposed for on rmation rule subset sele tion (Gamberger & Lavra , 2000) de nes diverse rules as those that over diverse sets of target lass examples. The approa h, implemented in Algorithm RSS outlined in Figure 2, an not guarantee statisti al independen e of the sele ted rules, but it ensures the diversity of generated subsets.\nAlgorithm RSS: Rule Subset Sele tion Input: S set of rules for the target lass\nP target lass examples\nParameter: number (required number of sele ted rules in output set SS) Output: SS set of relatively independent rules for the target lass (1) initialize SS fg (empty set of sele ted rules) (2) for every e 2 P do (e) 1 (3) repeat number times (4) sele t from S the rule with the highest weight P 1= (e) where summation is\nover the set P\n0\nP of target lass examples overed by the rule\n(5) for every e 2 P\n0\novered by the sele ted rule\ndo (e) (e) + 1\n(6) eliminate the sele ted rule from S (7) add the sele ted rule into set SS (8) end repeat\nFigure 2: Heuristi rule subset sele tion algorithm.\nInput to Algorithm RSS are the set of all target lass examples P and the set of rules S. Its output is a redu ed set of rules SS, SS S. The user adjustable parameter number determines how many rules will be sele ted for in lusion in output set SS. For every example e 2 P there is a ounter (e). Initially, the output set of sele ted rules is empty (step 1) and all ounter values are set to 1 (step 2). Next, in ea h iteration of the loop (steps 3 to 8), one rule is added to the output set (step 7). From set S, the rule with the highest weight value is sele ted. For ea h rule, weight is omputed so that 1= (e) values are added for all target lass examples overed by this rule (step 4). After rule sele tion, the rule is eliminated from set S (step 6) and (e) values for all target lass examples overed by the sele ted rule are in remented by 1 (step 5). This is the entral part of the algorithm whi h ensures that in the rst iteration all target lass examples ontribute the same value 1= (e) = 1 to the weight, while in the following iterations the ontributions of examples are inverse proportional to their overage by previously sele ted rules. In this way the examples already overed by one or more sele ted rules de rease their weights while rules overing many yet un overed target lass examples whose weights have not been de reased will have a greater han e to be sele ted in the following iterations.\nIn the publi ly available Data Mining Server, RSS is implemented in an outer loop for SD. Figure 3 gives the pseudo ode of algorithm DMS. In its inner loop, DMS alls SD and sele ts from its beam the single best rule to be in luded into the output set SS. To enable SD to indu e a di erent solution at ea h iteration, example weights (e) are introdu ed and used in the quality measure whi h is de ned as follows:\nq\ng\n=\nP\nTP\n1 (e)\nFP + g\n:\nThis is the same quality measure as in SD ex ept that the weights of true positive examples are not onstant and equal to 1 but de ned by expression 1\n(e)\n, hanging from iteration to\niteration.\nThe main reason for the des ribed implementation is to ensure the diversity of indu ed subgroups even though, be ause of the short exe ution time limit on the publi ly available server, a low beam width parameter value in Algorithm SD had to be set (the default value is 20). Despite the favorable diversity of rules a hieved through Algorithm DMS, the approa h has also some drawba ks. The rst drawba k is that the same rule an be dete ted in di erent iterations of Algorithm DMS, despite of the hanges in the (e) values. The more important drawba k is that heuristi sear h with a small beam width value may prevent the dete tion of some good quality subgroups. Therefore during exploratory appli ations, applying a single SD exe ution with a large beam width followed by a single run of RSS appears to be a better approa h."

Conversely, interesting rules/subgroups are those suÆ iently distant from the diagonal.

In subgroup onstru tion, the data analyst an try to a hieve the desired TPr=FPr tradeo by building rules using di erent data mining algorithms, by di erent parameter settings of a sele ted data mining algorithm or by applying a ost-sensitive data mining algorithm that takes into the a ount di erent mis lassi ation osts.\nThe q\ng\nmeasure in the SD algorithm that needs to be maximized, tries to nd subgroups\nthat are as far as possible from the diagonal of the ROC spa e in the dire ion of the left upper orner (with TPr equal to 100% and FPr equal to 0%).

It an also be used as a method for visualizing standard lassi ation rules.\nSubgroup visualization, as des ribed in this se tion, allows us to ompare distributions of di erent subgroups. The approa h assumes the existen e of at least one numeri (or ordered dis rete) attribute of expert's interest for subgroup analysis. The sele ted attribute is plotted on the X-axis of the diagram. The Y -axis represents a lass, or more pre isely, the number of instan es of a given lass. Both dire tions of the Y -axis (Y + and Y ) are used to indi ate the number of instan es. In Figure 6, for instan e, the X-axis represents age, the Y + -axis denotes lass oronary heart disease (CHD) and Y denotes lass `healthy'\n(non-CHD). Out of four graphs at the Y\n+\nside, three represent indu ed subgroups (A1, A2\nand C1) of CHD patients, and the fourth shows the age distribution of the entire population of CHD (all CHD) patients. The graphs at the Y side show the distribution of non-CHD (all healthy) patients in the training set and the distribution of healthy subje ts in luded into the subgroup A2 (dashed line).\nOn purpose, the graphs of subgroups A1 and C1 in Figure 6 show only the overage of positive ases (CHD patients), and in Figure 7 the graph of subgroup B2 shows only\nthe overage of positive ases, whereas the graphs of A2 in Figure 6 and B1 in Figure 7 indi ate that the des riptions of subgroups over positive ases (CHD patients) as well as some negative ases (healthy individuals). Ex ept for the orre t visualization of subgroups A2 and B1 and of the entire CHD and non-CHD distribution, Figures 6 and 7 have been simpli ed in order to enable a better understanding of the visualization method, by showing just the overage of positive ases.\nIn medi al domains we typi ally use the Y\n+\nside to represent the number of positive\nases (CHD patients, in this paper) in order to reveal properties of indu ed patterns for\nsubgroups of these patients. On the other hand, the Y side is reserved to reveal properties of these same patterns (or other patterns) for the negative ases (patients without CHD). One of the advantages of using Y + and Y as proposed above is that in binary lassi ation problems the omparison of the area under the graph of a subgroup and the graph of the entire population visualizes the fra tions of TP\nPos\n=\nTP\nTP+FN\nat the Y\n+\nside (sensitivity TPr),\nand\nFP Neg = FP TN+FP at the Y side (false alarm rate FPr), where Pos and Neg stand for the\nnumbers of positive and negative ases in the entire population, respe tively. For instan e, in the visualization of subgroup B1 in Figure 7 the area under the dashed line on the Y side represents the numbers of mis lassi ed training instan es of subgroup B1. In this way, the sensitivity and false alarm rate an be estimated for pattern B1 from Figure 7. The same information for pattern B2 an be found in Figure 8, showing subgroups A1 and B2 in terms of attribute `total holesterol value'.\nThe proposed visualization method an be adapted to visualize subgroups also in terms of value distributions of dis rete/nominal attributes. An approa h to su h visualization is presented in Figure 9. However, due to bar hart representation, it is more diÆ ult to\nompare several subgroups in one visualization.\nIn general, it is not ne essary that Y\n+\nand Y denote two opposite lasses.

In this way it is possible to indu e di erent patterns (subgroups) from the same data set. The sele tion of one or more subgroups representing the nal solution is left to the expert; the de ision depends both on rule predi tion properties (like the number of true positives and the tolerated number of false positives), as well as subje tive properties like the understandability, unexpe tedness and a tionability of indu ed subgroup des riptions (Silbers hatz & Tuzhilin, 1995), whi h depend on the features used in the onditions of indu ed rules. In the appli ation des ribed in this paper, the main subje tive a eptability riteria were understandability, simpli ity and a tionability.\nPartitioning the CHD risk group problem into three data stages A{C was ompletely based on the expert's understanding of the typi al diagnosti pro ess. From the ma hine learning point of view this a e ts the sele tion of subsets of attributes that are used in di erent experiments. Moreover, at data stage A the partitioning of the example set has been used as well. At this data stage there are only a few attributes that ould have been used for rule indu tion. The expert's understanding of the domain suggested that the CHD population be partitioned into two subpopulations based on the sex of patients, making it signi antly easer to indu e interesting subgroups. This partitioning resulted in patterns A1 and A2.\nAlternatively, partitioning an be performed also in the phase of performing statisti al hara terization of dis overed subgroups, by further splitting the dete ted subgroups in several parts (e.g., di erentiating between male and female patients that are true positive\nases for the subgroup) and then omparing attribute value distributions for these parts. Any signi ant di eren e in this distribution may be potentially interesting as part of the subgroup des ription. As a basis for subgroup partitioning one may use either some dete ted supporting risk fa tor or any other attribute or attribute ombination whi h is potentially interesting based on the existing expert knowledge.\nThere has been some e ort devoted also to automating the pro ess of partitioning example sets by a method of unsupervised learning, but its presentation is out of the main s ope of this work ( Smu , Gamberger, & Krsta i , 2001).\nFrom the methodologi al point of view it is interesting to noti e that the expert appreiated the indu ed subgroups overing many target lass ases (with true positive rate of at least 20%) and with false positive rate as low as possible, with the intention to keep it below 10%. But in sele ting a rule, its predi tion quality has not been the most important fa tor. The ne essary ondition for sele ting a rule was that the expert was able to re ognize\nonne tions among features building the rule that are medi ally reasonable. In this sense, short rules are signi antly more intuitive; it an be noti ed from Table 1 that all rules sele ted by the expert have at most three features de ning the prin ipal risk fa tors. The fa t that the expert did not sele t subgroups with an optimal TP=FP ratio is illustrated by\nFigures 16{18 in Se tion 4.2, whi h show the positions of the patterns A1{C1 in the TP=FP spa e and the TP=FP onvex hulls indu ed for data stages A{C, onne ting points with\nthe optimal overage properties.

This means that in the TPr=FPr tradeo , TPr should be as large as possible, and FPr as small as possible. Similarly, in the TP=FP spa e, TP should be as large as possible, and FP as small as possible.\nIn this work the quality measure q\ng\n= TP=(FP + g) using generalization parameter\ng has been de ned. This se tion explains why this quality measure has been sele ted, in\nomparison with other more intuitive quality measure like a ost-based measure q involving\n` ost' parameter .\n4.1 Comparison of the q\ng\nand q Heuristi s\nOur experien e in di erent medi al appli ations indi ates that intuitions like \\how expensive is every FP predi tion in terms of additional TP predi tions made by a rule\" are useful for understanding the problem of dire ting the sear h in the TP=FP spa e. Suppose that the de nition of ost parameter is based on the following argument: \\For every additional FP , the rule should over more than additional TP examples in order to be better.\" Based on su h reasoning, it is possible to de ne a quality measure q , using the following TP=FP tradeo :\nq = TP FP:\nQuality measure q is easy to use be ause of the intuitive interpretation of parameter . It has also a ni e property when used for subgroup dis overy: by hanging the value we an move in the TP=FP spa e and sele t the optimal point based on parameter .\nIn Algorithm SD, the quality measure q\ng\n, using a di erent TP=FP tradeo is used:\nq\ng\n= TP=(FP + g), where g is the generalization parameter.\nIf a subgroup dis overy algorithm employs exhaustive sear h (or if all points in the\nTP=FP spa e are known in advan e) then the two measures q\ng\nand q are equivalent in\nthe sense that every optimal solution lying on the onvex hull an be dete ted by using any of the two heuristi s; only the values that must be sele ted for parameters g and are di erent. In this ase, q might be even better be ause its interpretation is more intuitive.\nHowever, sin e Algorithm SD is a heuristi beam sear h algorithm, the situation is di erent. Subgroup dis overy is an iterative pro ess, performing one or more iterations (typi ally 2{5) until good rules are onstru ted by forming onjun tions of features in the rule body. In this pro ess, a rule quality measure is used for rule sele tion (for whi h the two measures q\ng\nand q are equivalent) as well as for the sele tion of features and their\nonjun tions that have high potential for the onstru tion of high quality rules in subsequent\niterations; for this use, rule quality measure q\ng\nis better than q . Let us explain why.\nSuppose that we have a point (a rule) R in the TP=FP spa e, where TP and FP are\nits true and false positives, respe tively. For a sele ted g value, q\ng\nan be determined for\nthis rule R. It an be shown that all points that have the same quality q\ng\nas rule R lie on\na line de ned by the following fun tion:\ntp =\nTP fp\nFP + g\n+\nTP g\nFP + g\n=\nTP (fp+ g)\nFP + g\n:\nIn this fun tion, tp represents the number of true positives of a rule with quality q\ng\nwhi h\novers exa tly fp negative examples. By sele ting a di erent fp value, the orresponding tp value an be determined by this fun tion. The line, determined by this fun tion, rosses the tp axis at point TP\n0\n= TP g=(FP + g) and the fp axis at point g. This is shown in\nFigure 11. The slope of this line is equal to the quality of rule R, whi h equals TP=(FP+g).\nfp\ntp\nR\nFP\nTP TP0\n-g\npoints with same quality qg=TP/(FP+g)\nFigure 11: Properties of rules with the same quality q g :\nFigure 12: Rules with highest quality inluded into the beam for q g = TP=(FP + g).\nIn the TP=FP spa e, points with higher quality than q\ng\nare above this line, in the\ndire tion of the upper left orner. Noti e that in the TP=FP spa e the top-left is the preferred part of the spa e: points in that part represent rules with the best TP=FP tradeo . This reasoning indi ates that points that will be in luded in the beam must all lie above the line of equal weights q\nbeam\nwhi h is de ned by the last rule in the beam. If\nrepresented graphi ally, rst beam width number of rules, found in the TP=FP spa e when rotating the line from point (0; P os) in the lo kwise dire tion, will be in luded in the beam. The enter of rotation is point ( g; 0). This is illustrated in Figure 12.\nOn the other hand, for the q quality measure de ned by q = TP FP the situation is similar but not identi al. Points with the same quality lie on a line tp = (fp FP )+TP , but its slope is onstant and equal to . Points with higher quality lie above the line in the dire tion of the left upper orner. The points that will be in luded into the beam are the\nrst beam width points in the TP=FP spa e found by a parallel movement of the line with slope , starting from point (0; P os) in the dire tion towards the lower right orner. This is illustrated in Figure 13.\nLet us now assume that we are looking for an optimal rule whi h is very spe i . In this ase, parameter will have a high value while parameter g will have a very small value. The intention is to nd the same optimal rule in the TP=FP spa e. At the rst stage of rule onstru tion only single features are onsidered and most probably their quality as the\nFP .\nnal solution is rather poor. See Figure 14 for a typi al pla ement of potentially interesting\nfeatures in the TP=FP spa e.\nThe primary fun tion of these features is to be good building blo ks so that by onjun - tively adding other features, high quality rules an be onstru ted. By adding onjun tions, solutions generally move in the dire tion of the left lower orner. The reason is that onjun tions an redu e the number of FP predi tions. However, they redu e the number of TP 's as well. Consequently, by onjun tively adding features to rules that are lose to the left lower orner, the algorithm will not be able to nd their spe ializations nearer to the left upper orner. Only the rules that have high TP value, and are in the upper part of the TP=FP spa e, have a han e to take part in the onstru tion of interesting new rules.\nFigure 15 illustrates the main di eren e between quality measures q g and q : the former tends to sele t more general features from the right upper part of the TP=FP spa e (points in the so- alled `g spa e'), while the later `prefers' spe i features from the left lower orner (points in the so- alled ` spa e'). In ases when is very large and g is very small, the e e t an be so important that it may prevent the algorithm from nding the optimal solution even with a large beam width. Noti e, however, that Algorithm SD is heuristi in its nature and no statements are true for all ases. This means that in some, but very rare ases, a quality measure based on parameter may result in a better nal solution."

EXPLORA treats the learning task as a single relation problem, i.e., all the data are assumed to be available in one table (relation), whereas MIDOS extends this task to multi-relation databases, whi h is related to a number of other learning tasks (De Raedt & Dehaspe, 1997; Mannila & Toivonen, 1996; Wrobel & D zeroski, 1995), mostly in the eld of Indu tive Logi Programming (D zeroski & Lavra , 2001; Lavra & D zeroski, 1994).\nThe most important features of EXPLORA and MIDOS, related to this paper, on ern the use of heuristi s for subgroup dis overy; the measures of interestingness and the sear h heuristi s are outlined in separate se tions below. A related approa h to our approa h to rule subset sele tion, presented in Se tion 2.3, is Gebhardt's (1991) work on subgroup suppression.\nNote that some approa hes to asso iation rule indu tion an also be used for subgroup dis overy. For instan e, the APRIORI-C algorithm (Jovanoski & Lavra , 2001), whi h applies asso iation rule indu tion to lassi ation rule indu tion, outputs lassi ation rules with guaranteed support and on den e with respe t to a target lass. If a rule satis es also a user-de ned signi an e threshold, an indu ed APRIORI-C rule is an independent ` hunk' of knowledge about the target lass, whi h an be viewed as a subgroup des ription with guaranteed signi an e, support and on den e. Similarly, the on rmation rule on ept, introdu ed by Gamberger and Lavra (2000) and used as a basis for the subgroup dis overy algorithm in this paper, utilizes the minimal support requirement as a measure whi h must be satis ed by every rule in order to be in luded in the indu ed on rmation rule set.\nBoth above mentioned approa hes to subgroup dis overy exploit the information about lass membership. One of the main reasons why these approa hes are of interest for subgroup dis overy is that, unlike the lassi al lassi ation rule indu tion algorithms su h as CN2 (Clark & Niblett, 1989) and AQ (Mi halski, Mozeti , Hong, & Lavra , 1986), they do not use the overing algorithm. In overing algorithms only the rst few indu ed rules may\nbe of interest as subgroup des riptors with suÆ ient overage. Subsequently indu ed rules are indu ed from biased example subsets, e.g., subsets in luding only positive examples not overed by previously indu ed rules. This bias onstrains the population for subgroup dis overy in a way that is unnatural for the subgroup dis overy pro ess whi h is, in general, aimed at dis overing interesting properties of subgroups of the entire population.\nRe ent approa hes to subgroup dis overy aim at over oming the problem of this inappropriate bias of the standard overing algorithm. The re ently developed subgroup dis-\novery algorithms CN2-SD (Lavra , Fla h, Kav sek, & Todorovski, 2002) and RSD (Lavra , Zelezn y, & Fla h, 2002) use the so- alled weighted overing algorithm, similar to the one implemented in Algorithm DMS des ribed in this paper.\nInstan e weights play an important role in boosting (Freund & Shapire, 1996) and alternating de ision trees (S hapire & Singer, 1999). Instan e weights have been used also in variants of the overing algorithm implemented in rule learning approa hes su h as SLIPPER (Cohen, 1999), RL (Lee, Bu hanan, & Aronis, 1998) and DAIRY (Hsu, Soderland, & Etzioni, 1998). A variant of the weighted overing algorithm has been used also in the\nontext of on rmation rule subset sele tion (Gamberger & Lavra , 2000), used as a basis\nfor the rule subset sele tion algorithm RSS des ribed in this paper."

    "abstractText" : "This paper presents an approa h to expert-guided subgroup dis overy. The main step of the subgroup dis overy pro ess, the indu tion of subgroup des riptions, is performed by a heuristi beam sear h algorithm, using a novel parametrized de nition of rule quality whi h is analyzed in detail. The other important steps of the proposed subgroup dis overy pro ess are the dete tion of statisti ally signi ant properties of sele ted subgroups and subgroup visualization: statisti ally signi ant properties are used to enri h the des riptions of indu ed subgroups, while the visualization shows subgroup properties in the form of distributions of the numbers of examples in the subgroups. The approa h is illustrated by the results obtained for a medi al problem of early dete tion of patient risk groups.",
