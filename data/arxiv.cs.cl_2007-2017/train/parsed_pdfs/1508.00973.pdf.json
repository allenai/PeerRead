      "text" : "Detecting topics and topic hierarchies from document collections, along with its many potential applications, is a major research area in Machine Learning. Currently the predominant approach to topic detection is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). LDA has been developed to detect topics and to model relationships among them, including topic correlations (Blei and Lafferty, 2007), topic hierarchies (Blei et al., 2010; Paisley et al., 2012), and topic evolution (Blei and Lafferty, 2006). We collectively name these methods LDA-based methods. In those methods, a topic is a probability distribution over a vocabulary and a document is a mixture of topics. Therefore LDA is a type of mixture membership model. ∗http://peixianc.me\nar X\niv :1\n50 8.\n00 97\nA totally different approach to hierarchical topic detection is recently proposed by Liu et al. (2014). It is called hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA), where topics are organized hierarchically as a latent tree model (LTM) (Zhang, 2004; Zhang et al., 2008b) such as the one in Fig 1. In HLTA, a topic is a state of a latent variable and it corresponds to a collection of documents, and a document can belong to multiple topics. HLTA is therefore a type of multiple membership model.\nEmpirical results from Liu et al. (2014) indicate that HLTA finds significantly better topics and topic hierarchies than hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (hLDA), the first LDA-based method for hierarchical topic detection. However, HLTA does not scale up well. It took, for instance, 17 hours to process a NIPS dataset that consists of fewer than 2,000 documents over 1,000 distinct words (Liu et al., 2014).(Note that hLDA took even longer time.)\nThe computational bottleneck of HLTA lies in the use of the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) for parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose progressive EM (PEM) as a replacement of EM so as to scale up HLTA. PEM is motivated by the moments method, where parameters are determined by solving equations, each of which involves a small number of model parameters related to two or three observed variables (Chang, 1996; Anandkumar et al., 2012). Similarly, PEM works in steps and, at each step, it focuses on a small part of the model parameters and involves only three or four observed variables.\nOur new algorithm is hence named PEM-HLTA. It is drastically faster than HLTA. PEM-HLTA finished processing the aforementioned NIPS dataset within 4 minutes. It only took around 11 hours, on a single desktop computer, to analyze a version of New York Times dataset that consists of 300,000 articles with 10,000 distinct words. PEM-HLTA is also as efficient as nHDP (Paisley et al., 2012), a state-of-the-art LDA-based method for hierarchical topic detection, and it significantly outperforms nHDP, as well as hLDA, in terms of the quality of topics and topic hierarchies."

      "text" : "A latent tree model (LTM) is a Markov random field over an undirected tree, where the leaf nodes represent observed variables and the internal nodes represent latent variables (Zhang et al., 2008a). In this paper we assume all variables have finite cardinality, i.e., finite number of possible states.\nParameters of an LTM consist of potentials associated with edges and nodes such that the product of all potentials is a joint distribution over all variables. We pick the potentials as follows: Root the model at an arbitrary latent node, direct the edges away from the root, and specify a marginal distribution for the root and a conditional distribution for each of the other nodes given its parent. Then in Fig 2(b), if Y is the root, the parameters are the distributions P (Y ), P (A | Y ), P (Z | Y ), P (C | Z) and so forth. Because of the way the potentials are picked, LTMs are technically tree-structured Bayesian networks (Pearl, 1988).\nLTMs with a single latent variables are known as latent class models (LCMs)(Bartholomew and Knott, 1999). They are a type of finite mixture models for discrete data. For example, the model m1 in Fig 2(a) defines the following mixture distribution over the observed variables:\nP (A, · · ·, E)= ∑|Y |\ni=1 P (Y = i)P (A, · · ·, E |Y = i) (1)\nwhere |Y | is the cardinality of Y . If the model is learned from a dataset, then the data are partitioned into |Y | soft clusters, each represented by a state of Y . The model m2 in Fig 2(b) has two latent variables. Its joint distribution can be reduced to two different but related mixture distributions:\nP (A, · · ·, E)= ∑|Y |\ni=1 P (Y = i)P (A, · · ·, E |Y = i), P (A, · · ·, E)= ∑|Z|\ni=1 P (Z= i)P (A, · · ·, E |Z= i).\nThe model gives two different ways of partitioning the data, one represented by Y and the other by Z. Hence LTMs are a tool for multidimensional clustering (Chen et al., 2012).\nA\nY\nB C D E\n(a) m1\nY\nA B D E\nZ\nC\n(b) m2\nFigure 2: Leaf nodes are observed while others are latent."

The values in the vector indicate the presence or absence of words in the document. The output is an LTM, such as the one shown in Fig 1, where the word variables are at the bottom and the latent variables, all assumed binary, form several levels of hierarchy on top. Each state of a latent variable corresponds to a cluster of documents and is interpreted as a topic. The top level control of PEM-HLTA is given in Algorithm 1, and subroutines in Algorithms 2–3."

      "heading" : "3.1 TOP LEVEL CONTROL",
      "text" : "We illustrate the top level control using the example model in Fig 1, which is learned from a dataset with 30 word variables. In the first pass through the loop, the subroutine BUILDISLANDS is called (line 3). It partitions all variables into 11 clusters (Fig 3 bottom), which are uni-dimensional in the sense that the co-occurrences of words in each cluster can be properly modeled using a single latent variable. A latent variable is introduced for each cluster to form an LCM. We metaphorically refer to the LCMs as islands and the latent variables in them as level-1 latent variables.\nThe next step is to link up the 11 islands (line 4). This is done by estimating the mutual information (MI) (Cover and Thomas, 2012) between every pair of latent variables and building a Chow-Liu tree (Chow and Liu, 1968) over them, so as to form an overall model (Liu et al., 2013). The result is the model at the middle of Fig 3.\nIn the subroutine HARDASSIGNMENT, inference is carried out to compute the posterior distribution of each latent variable for each document. The document is assigned to the state with the maximum posterior probability. This results in a dataset over the level-1 latent variables (line 10). In the second pass through the loop, the level-1 latent variables are partitioned into 3 groups and 3 islands are created. The islands are linked up to form the model shown at the top of Fig 3. At line 8, the model at the top of Fig 3 (m1) is stacked on the model in the middle (m) to give rise to the final model in Fig 1. While doing so, the subroutine STACKMODELS cuts off the links among the level-1 latent variables. The number of nodes at the top level is below the threshold τ , if we set τ = 5, and hence the loop is exited. EM is run on the final model for κ steps to improve its parameters (line 12).\nAlgorithm 1 PEM-HLTA(D, τ , δ, κ) Inputs: D—Collection of documents, τ—Upper bound on the number of top-level topics, δ—Threshold used\nin UD-test, κ—Number of EM steps on final model.\nOutputs: An HLTM and a topic hierarchy.\n1: D1 ← D, L ← ∅, m← null. 2: repeat 3: L ← BUILDISLANDS(D1, δ); 4: m1 ← BRIDGEISLANDS(L, D1); 5: if m = null then 6: m← m1; 7: else\n8: m← STACKMODELS(m1, m); 9: end if\n10: D1 ← HARDASSIGNMENT(m, D); 11: until |L| < τ . 12: Run EM on m for κ steps. 13: return m and topic hierarchy extracted from m.\nAlgorithm 2 BUILDISLANDS(D, δ) 1: V ← variables in D,M← ∅. 2: while |V| > 0 do 3: m← ONEISLAND(D, V , δ); 4: M←M∪ {m};\n5: V ← variables in D but not in any m ∈M; 6: end while 7: returnM.\nIn our experiments, we set κ = 50.

The idea is to compare two LTMs m1 and m2, where m1 is the best model among all LCMs for S while m2 is the best model among all LTMs that contain two latent variables. The model selection criterion used is the BIC score (Schwarz, 1978). The set S is uni-dimensional if the following inequality holds:\nBIC(m2 | D)− BIC(m1 | D) < δ, (2) where δ is a threshold. In other words, S is considered uni-dimensional if the best two-latent variable model is not significantly better than the best one-latent variable model. The quantity on the left hand side of Equation (2) is a large sample approximation of the natural logarithm of Bayes factor (Raftery, 1995) for comparing m1 and m2. According to the cut-off values for the Bayes factor, we set δ = 3 in our experiments."

Define the mutual information between a variable Z and a set S as MI(Z,S) = maxA∈S MI(Z,A). ONEISLAND maintains a working set S of observed variables. Initially, S contains the pair of variables with the highest MI among all pairs, and a third variable that has the highest MI with the pair (line 2). At line 5, an LCM is learned for those three variables using the subroutine LEARNLCM, which is given in the Appendix along with some other subroutines. Then other variables are added to S one by one until the UD-test fails. We illustrate this process using Fig 2. Suppose S initially consists of three variables A, B, C. Let D be the variable that has the maximum MI with S among all other variables. Suppose the UD-test passes on S ∪ {D}, then D is added to S. Next let E be the variable with the maximum MI with S (line 7) and the UD-test is performed on S ∪ E = {A,B,C,D,E} (lines 8-14). The two models m1 and m2 used in the test is shown in Fig 2.

      "text" : "We begin by presenting a property of LTMs that motivates our new method. A similar property of HMMs was first discovered by Chang (1996). We introduce some notations using m1 of Fig 2. Since all variables have the same cardinality, the conditional distribution P (A|Y ) can be regarded as a square matrix, which we denote as PA|Y . Similarly, PAC is the matrix representation of the joint distribution P (A,C). For a value b of B, Pb|Y is the vector presentation of P (B=b|Y ) and PAbC the matrix representation of P (A,B=b, C).\nTheorem 1 [ Zhang et al. (2014)] Let Y be the latent variable in an LCM and A,B,C be three of the observed variables. Assume all variables have the same cardinality and the matrices PA|Y and PAC are invertible. Then we have\nPA|Y diag(Pb|Y )P −1 A|Y = PAbCP −1 AC , (3)\nwhere diag(Pb|Y ) is a diagonal matrix with components of Pb|Y as the diagonal elements.\nThe equation implies that the model parameters P (B=b|Y=0), · · · , P (B=b|Y=|Y |) are the eigenvalues of the matrix on the right, and hence can be obtained from the marginal distributions PAbCPAC .\nTheorem 1 can be used to estimate P (B|Y ) under two conditions: (1) There is a good fit between the data and model as if the data were generated from the model, and (2) the sample size is sufficiently large. In this case, the empirical marginal distributions P̂ (A,B,C) and P̂ (A,C) computed from data are accurate estimates of the distributions P (A,B,C) and P (A,C) of the model. We can use them to form the matrix PAbCP−1AC , and determine PB|Y as the eigenvalues of the matrix. This is called the moments method. Note that Theorem 1 still applies when replacing edges like (Y,A) with paths. For example in Fig 2(b), if P (C|Z) and P (E|Z) are to be estimated, a third observed variable can be chosen from (A,B,D) as long as there is path from Z to this observed variable.\nTheorem 1 can be also used to estimate all the parameters of the model m1 in Fig 2. First, we can estimate P (B|Y ) using Equation 3 in the sub-model Y -{A,B,C}. By swapping the roles of variables, we can also estimate P (A|Y ) and P (C|Y ) in the sub-model. Next we can consider the sub-model Y -{B,C,D} and estimate P (D|Y ) with P (B|Y ) and P (C|Y ) fixed. Finally, we can consider the sub-model Y -{C,D,E} and estimate P (E|Y ) there with P (C|Y ) and P (D|Y ) fixed. Note that the parameters are estimated in steps instead of all at once. Hence we call this scheme progressive parameter estimation."

      "heading" : "4.2 PROGRESSIVE EM",
      "text" : "The moments method is not iterative and hence can be drastically faster than EM. Unfortunately, it does not produce high quality estimates when the model does not fit data well and/or the sample size is not sufficiently large. In such cases, the empirical marginal distributions P̂ (A,B,C) and P̂ (A,C) are poor estimates of the distributions P (A,B,C) and P (A,C) of the model. In our experiences, the method frequently gives negative estimates for probability values in the context of latent tree models.\nIn this paper, we do not estimate parameters by solving the equation in Theorem 1. However, we adopt the progressive estimation scheme and combine it with EM. This gives rise to progress EM (PEM). To estimate the parameters of m1, PEM first estimates P (Y ), P (A|Y ), P (B|Y ), and P (C|Y ) by running EM on the sub-model Y -{A,B,C}; then it estimates P (D|Y ) by running EM on the sub-model Y -{B,C,D} with P (B|Y ), P (C|Y ) and P (Y ) fixed; and finally it estimates P (E|Y ) on sub-model Y -{C,D,E} similarly. All the sub-models involve 3 observed variables. For m2, PEM first estimates P (Y ), P (A|Y ), P (B|Y ) and P (D|Y ) by running EM on sub-model Y -{A,B,D}; then it estimates P (C|Z), P (E|Z) and P (Z|Y ) by running EM on the two latent variable sub-model {B,D}-Y -Z-{C,E}, with P (B|Y ), P (D|Y ) and P (Y ) fixed. Note that only two of the children of Y are used here, and the model involves only 4 observed variables.\nIntuitively, the moments method tries to fit data in a rigid way, while PEM tries to fit data in an elastic manner. It never gives negative probability values. Moreover, it is still efficient because EM is run only on sub-models with three or four observed binary variables, and local maxima is seldom an issue using multiple starting points."

      "heading" : "4.3 PEM FOR ISLAND BUILDING",
      "text" : "PEM can be aligned with the subroutine ONEISLAND nicely because the subroutine adds variables to the working set S one at a time. Consider a pass through the loop. At the beginning, we have an LCM m for the variables in S, whose parameters have been estimated earlier. Then ONEISLAND finds the variable X outside S that has the maximum MI with S, and the variable W inside S that has the maximum MI with X (line 7, 8).\nAt line 11, ONEISLAND adds X to the m to create a new LCM m1, and estimates the parameters for the new variable using the subroutine PEM-LCM. We illustrate how this is done using Fig 2. Suppose the LCM m is the model Y -{A,B,C,D} and the variable X is E. PEM-LCM adds the variable E to m and thereby creates a new LCM m1, which is Y -{A,B,C,D,E} (Fig 2 left). To estimate the distribution P (E|Y ), PEM-LCM creates a temporary model m′ from m1 by only keeping three observed variables: E and two other variables with maximum MI with E. Suppose m′ is Y -{C,D,E}. PEM-LCM estimates the distribution P (E|Y ) by running EM on m′ with all other parameters fixed. Finally, it copies P (E|Y ) from m′ to m1, and returns m1. At line 12, ONEISLAND addsX tom and learns a two-latent variable modelm2 using the subroutine PEM-LTM-2L. We illustrate PEM-LTM-2L using the foregoing example. Let X be E and W be C. PEM-LTM-2L creates the new model m2, which is {A,B,D}-Y -Z-{C,E} (Fig 2 right). To estimate the parameters P (C|Z), P (E|Z) and P (Z|Y ), PEM-LTM-2L creates a temporary model m′ which is {A,D}-Y -Z-{C,E}. Only the two of the children of Y that have maximum MI withE remain(A and D in this example). PEM-LTM-2L estimates the three distributions by running EM on m′ with all other parameters fixed. Finally, it copies the distributions from m′ to m2 and returns m2. 1 Similarly in the subroutine BRIDGEDISLANDS we use this method to estimate parameters for edges between latent variables, but only estimating P (Z|Y ) and keeping all other parameters fixed."

Also included in the comparisons are hLDA and a method named CorEx (Ver Steeg and Galstyan, 2014) that builds hierarchical latent trees by optimizing an information-theoretic objective function.\n1Details of PEM-LCM and PEM-LTM-2L can be found in the Appendix submitted as a supplement.\nTwo of the datasets used are NIPS data2 and Newsgroup3. Three versions of the NIPS data with vocabulary sizes 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 were created by choosing words with highest average TF-IDF values, referred to as Nips-1k, Nips-5k and Nips-10k. Similarly, two versions (News-1k and News-5k) of the Newsgroup data were created. Note that News-10k is not included because it is beyond the capabilities of three of the methods. Comparisons of PEM-HLTA and nHDP on large-scale data will be given separately in Section 5.4. After preprocessing, NIPS and Newsgroup consist of 1,955 and 19,940 documents respectively. For PEM-HLTA, HLTA and CorEx, the data are represented as binary vectors, whereas for nHDP and hLDA, they are represented as bags-of-words.\nPEM-HLTA determines the height of hierarchy and the number of nodes at each level automatically. On the NIPS and Newsgroup datasets, it produced hierarchies with between 4 to 6 levels. For nHDP and hLDA, the height of hierarchy needs to be manually set and is usually set at 3. We set the number of nodes at each level in such way that nHDP and hLDA would yield roughly the same total number of topics as PEM-HLTA. CorEx were configured similarly. PEM-HLTA is implemented in Java. The parameter settings are described in Section 3. Implementations of other algorithms were provided by their authors and ran at their default parameter settings.

The topics are extracted from the model learned by PEM-HLTA as follows: For a latent binary variable Z in the model, we enumerate the word variables in the subtree rooted at Z in descending order of their MI values with Z. The leading words are those whose probabilities differ the most between the two states of Z and are hence used to characterize the states. The state of Z under which the words occur less often overall is regarded as the background topic and is not reported, while the other state is reported as a genuine topic. Values in [] show the percentage of the documents belonging to the genuine topic.\nLet us examine some of the topics. We refer to topics on the left using the letter L followed by topic numbers and those on the right using R. For PEM-HLTA, R1 consists of probability terms: R1.1 is about EM algorithm; R1.2 about Gaussian mixtures and R1.3 about generative distributions. R1.4 is a combination of variance and noise, which are separated at the next lower level. For nHDP, the topic L1 and its children L1.1, L1.2 and L1.5 are also about probability. However, L1.3 and L1.4 do not fit in the group well. The topic R2 is about image analysis, while its first four subtopics are about different aspects of image analysis: sources of images, pixels, objects. R2.5 and R2.6 are also meaningful and related, but do not fit in well. They are placed in another subgroup by PEMHLTA. In nHDP, the subtopics of L2 do not give a clear spectrum of aspects of image analysis. The topic R3 is about speech recognition. Its subtopics are about different aspects of speech recognition. Only R3.4 does not fit in the group well. In contrast, L3 and its subtopics do not present a clear semantic hierarchy. Some of them are not meaningful. Another topic related to speech recognition L1.5 is placed elsewhere. Overall, the topics and topic hierarchy obtained by PEM-HLTA are more meaningful than those by nHDP."

To analyze the data, we picked 10,000 words using TF-IDF and then randomly divided the dataset into 50 equal-sized subsets. We used only the fist subset for the first phase of PEM-HLTA. For the second phase, we ran EM on current model once using each subset in turn until all the subsets are utilized .\nOn New York Times data, we only compare PEM-HLTA with nHDP since other methods are not amenable to processing large datasets as we can observe from Table 4. We still trained nHDP model using documents in bag-of-words form and PEM-HLTA using documents as binary vectors of words. Table 5 reports the running times and topic coherence. PEM-HLTA took around 11 hours which is a little bit slower than nHDP (10.5 hours). However, PEM-HLTA produced more coherent topics, which is not only testified by the coherence score, but also the resulting topic hierarchies. The reader could get a clear picture of the superiority of PEM-HLTA over nHDP by taking a quick look at the model structure and topic hierarchies submitted as supplements."

      "heading" : "6 CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "We have proposed and investigated a method to scale up HLTA — a newly emerged method for hierarchical topic detection. The key idea is to replace EM using progressive EM. The resulting algorithm PEM-HLTA reduces the computation time of HLTA drastically and can handle much larger datasets. More importantly, it outperforms nHDP, the state-of-the-art LDA-based method for hierarchical topic detection, in terms of both quality of topics and topic hierarchy, with comparable speed on large-scale data. Although we only show how PEM works in HLTA, PEM can possibly be used in other more general models. PEM-HLTA can also be further scaled up through parallelization and used for text classification. We plan to investigate these directions in the future.\n1http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bag+of+Words"

It differs fundamentally from the LDA-based methods in terms of topic definition, topic-document relationship, and learning method. It has been shown to discover significantly more coherent topics and better topic hierarchies. However, HLTA relies on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation and hence is not efficient enough to deal with large datasets. In this paper, we propose a method to drastically speed up HLTA using a technique inspired by recent advances in the moments method. Empirical experiments show that our method greatly improves the efficiency of HLTA. It is as efficient as the state-of-the-art LDA-based method for hierarchical topic detection and finds substantially better topics and topic hierarchies.",
