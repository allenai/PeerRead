      "text" : "Binary classification is the canonical supervised learning problem. Given an instance space X, and samples from some distribution D over X × {±1}, the goal is to learn a scorer s : X → R with low misclassification error on future samples drawn from D. Our interest is in the more realistic scenario where the learner observes samples from a distribution D, which is a corruption of D where labels have some constant probability of being flipped. The goal is still to perform well with respect to the unobserved distribution D. This is known as the problem of learning from symmetric label noise (SLN learning) [Angluin and Laird, 1988].\nLong and Servedio [2010] proved the following negative result on what is possible in SLN learning: there exists a linearly separableD where, when the learner observes some corruptionD with symmetric label noise of any nonzero rate, minimisation of any convex potential over a linear function class results in classification performance on D that is equivalent to random guessing. Ostensibly, this establishes that convex losses are not “SLN-robust” and motivates the use of non-convex losses [Stempfel and Ralaivola, 2009, Masnadi-Shirazi et al., 2010, Ding and Vishwanathan, 2010, Denchev et al., 2012, Manwani and Sastry, 2013].\nIn this paper, we propose a convex loss and prove that it is SLN-robust. The loss avoids the result of Long and Servedio [2010] by virtue of being negatively unbounded. The loss is a modification of the hinge loss where one does not clamp at zero; thus, we call it the unhinged loss. We show that this is the unique convex loss (up to scaling and translation) that satisfies a notion of “strong SLN-robustness ” (Proposition 4). In addition to being SLN-robust, this loss has several attractive properties, such as being classification-calibrated (Proposition 5), consistent when minimised on the corrupted distribution (Proposition 6), and having an easily computable optimal solution that is the difference of two kernel means (Equation 9). Finally, we show that this optimal solution is equivalent to that of a strongly regularised SVM (Proposition 7), and such a result holds more generally for any twice-differentiable convex potential (Proposition 8), implying that strong `2 regularisation endows most standard learners with SLN-robustness.\nar X\niv :1\n50 5.\n07 63\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n8 M\nThe classifier resulting from minimising the unhinged loss is not new [Devroye et al., 1996, Chapter 10], [Schölkopf and Smola, 2002, Section 1.2], [Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004, Section 5.1]. However, establishing this classifier’s SLN-robustness, its equivalence to a highly regularised SVM solution, and showing the underlying loss uniquely satisfies a notion of strong SLN-robustness, to our knowledge is novel."

Unfortunately, these learners are not SLN-robust: Long and Servedio [2010, Theorem 2] give an example where, when learning under symmetric label noise, for any convex potential `, the corrupted `-risk minimiser over Flin has classification performance equivalent to random guessing on D. This implies that (`,Flin) is not SLN-robust1 as per Definition 1. (All Proofs may be found in Appendix A.)\nProposition 1 (Long and Servedio [2010, Theorem 2]). Let X = Rd for any d ≥ 2. Pick any convex potential `. Then, (`,Flin) is not SLN-robust.\nThe widespread practical use of convex potential based learners makes Proposition 1 a disheartening result, and motivates the search for other learners that are SLN-robust.\n3.3 The fallout: what learners are SLN-robust? In light of Proposition 1, there are two ways to proceed in order to obtain SLN-robust learners: either we change the class of losses `, or we change the function class F.\nThe first approach has been pursued in a large body of work that embraces non-convex losses [Stempfel and Ralaivola, 2009, Masnadi-Shirazi et al., 2010, Ding and Vishwanathan, 2010, Denchev et al., 2012, Manwani and Sastry, 2013]. However, while such losses avoid the conditions of Proposition 1, this does not automatically imply that they are SLN-robust when used with Flin. In Appendix B, we present evidence that some of these losses are in fact not SLN-robust when used with Flin.\nThe second approach is to instead consider suitably rich F that contains the Bayes-optimal scorer for D, e.g. by employing a universal kernel. With this choice, one can still use a convex potential loss; in fact, owing to Equation 2, using any classification-calibrated loss will result in an SLN-robust learner when F = RX.\n1Even if we weaken the notion of SLN-robustness to allow for a difference of ∈ [0, 1/2] between the clean and corrupted minimisers’ performance, Long and Servedio [2010, Theorem 2] implies that in the worst case = 1/2.\nProposition 2. Pick any classification-calibrated `. Then, (`,RX) is SLN-robust.\nBoth approaches have drawbacks. The first approach has a computational penalty, as it requires optimising a non-convex loss. The second approach has a statistical penalty, as estimation rates with a rich F will require a larger sample size. Thus, it appears that SLN-robustness involves a computational-statistical tradeoff.\nHowever, there is a variant of the first option: pick a loss that is convex, but not a convex potential. If an SLN-robust loss of this type exists, it affords the computational and statistical advantages of minimising convex risks with linear scorers. Manwani and Sastry [2013] demonstrated that square loss, `(y, v) = (1− yv)2, is one such loss. We will show that there is a simpler loss that is similarly convex, classification-calibrated, and SLN-robust, but is not in the class of convex potentials by virtue of being negatively unbounded. To derive this loss, it is helpful to interpret robustness in terms of a noise-correction procedure on loss functions."

The loss ` is defined as follows.\nDefinition 2 (Noise-corrected loss). Given any loss ` and ρ ∈ [0, 1/2), the noise-corrected loss ` is\n(∀y ∈ {±1}) (∀v ∈ R) `(y, v) = (1− ρ) · `(y, v)− ρ · `(−y, v) 1− 2ρ . (4)\nSince ` depends on the unknown parameter ρ, it is not directly usable to design an SLN-robust learner. Nonetheless, it is a useful theoretical construct, since the risk equivalence between LD` (s) and LD` (s) means that for any F, minimisation of the `-risk on D over F is equivalent to minimisation of the `-risk on D over F, i.e. SD,F,∗` = S D,F,∗ ` . With this, we can re-express the SLN-robustness of a learner (`,F) as\n(∀D ∈ ∆) (∀D ∈ Nsln(D))LD01(S D,F,∗ ` ) = LD01(S D,F,∗ ` ).

While this is an open question, interestingly, we can show that under a stronger requirement on the losses ` and `, the condition in Equation 6 is also necessary. The stronger requirement is that the corresponding risks order all stochastic scorers identically. A stochastic scorer is simply a mapping f : X→ ∆R, where ∆R is the set of distributions over the reals. In a slight abuse of notation, we denote the `-stochastic risk of f by\nLD` (f) = E (X,Y)∼D\n[ E\nS∼f(X) [`(Y,S)]\n] .\nEquipped with this, we define a notion of order equivalence of loss pairs.\nDefinition 3 (Order equivalent loss pairs). We say that a pair of losses (`, ˜̀) are order equivalent if\n(∀D) (∀f, g ∈ ∆XR )LD` (f) ≤ LD` (g) ⇐⇒ LD˜̀ (f) ≤ LD˜̀ (g).\nClearly, if two losses are order equivalent, their corresponding risks have the same restricted minimisers. Consequently, if (`, `) are order equivalent for every ρ ∈ [0, 1/2), this implies that SD,F,∗` = S D,F,∗ `\nfor any F, which by Equation 5 means that for any F, the learner (`,F) is SLN-robust.

A loss ` is strongly SLN-robust if and only if it satisfies Equation 6.\nWe now return to our original goal, which was to find a convex ` that is SLN-robust for Flin (and ideally more general function classes). The above suggests that to do so, it is reasonable to consider as admissible those losses that satisfy Equation 6. Unfortunately, it is evident that if ` is convex, non-constant, and bounded below by zero, then it cannot possibly be admissible in this sense. But we now show that removing the boundedness restriction allows for the existence of a convex admissible loss."

By Proposition 5, this does not affect the classification-calibration of the loss. In the context of linear scorers, boundedness of scorers can be achieved by regularisation: instead of working with Flin, one can instead use Flin,λ = {x 7→ 〈w, x〉 | ||w||2 ≤ 1/ √ λ}, where λ > 0, so that Flin,λ ⊆ FR/√λ for R = supx∈X ||x||2.

First, crossvalidation is not required to select λ, since s∗unh,λ depends trivially on the regularisation constant: changing λ only changes the magnitude of scores, not their sign. Thus, regularisation simply controls the scale of the predicted scores, and for the purposes of classification, one can simply use λ = 1.\nSecond, we can easily extend the scorers to use a bias regularised with strength 0 < λb 6= λ. Tuning λb is equivalent to computing s∗unh,λ as per Equation 9, and tuning a threshold on a holdout set.\nThird, when H = Rd for d small, we can store w∗unh,λ explicitly, and use this to make predictions. For high (or infinite) dimensional H, we can make predictions directly via Equation 9. However, when learning with a training sample S ∼ Dn, this would require storing the entire sample for use at test time, which is undesirable. To alleviate this, for a translation-invariant kernel one can use random Fourier features [Rahimi and Recht, 2007] to find an approximate embedding of H into some low-dimensional Rd, and then store w∗unh,λ as usual. Alternately, one can post hoc search for a sparse approximation to w ∗ unh,λ, for example using kernel herding [Chen et al., 2012].

Thus, the experiments do not aim to assert that the unhinged loss is “better” than other losses, but rather, to demonstrate that its SLN-robustness is not purely theoretical.\nWe first show that the unhinged risk minimiser performs well on the example of Long and Servedio [2010]. Figure 1 shows the distribution D, where X = {(1, 0), (γ, 5γ), (γ,−γ)} ⊂ R2, with marginal distribution M = { 14 , 1 4 , 1 2} and all three instances are deterministically positive. We pick γ = 1/2. From Figure 1, we see the unhinged minimiser perfectly classifies all three points, regardless of the level of label noise. The hinge risk minimiser is perfect when there is no label noise, but with even a small amount of label noise, achieves an error rate of 50%.\n0.5 1\n−1\n−0.5\n0.5\n1 Unhinged Hinge 0% noise Hinge 1% noise\nFigure 1: Long and Servedio [2010] dataset.\nHinge t-logistic Unhinged\nρ = 0 0.00± 0.00 0.00± 0.00 0.00± 0.00 ρ = 0.1 0.15± 0.27 0.00± 0.00 0.00± 0.00 ρ = 0.2 0.21± 0.30 0.00± 0.00 0.00± 0.00 ρ = 0.3 0.38± 0.37 0.22± 0.08 0.00± 0.00 ρ = 0.4 0.42± 0.36 0.22± 0.08 0.00± 0.00 ρ = 0.49 0.47± 0.38 0.39± 0.23 0.34± 0.48\nTable 1: Mean and standard deviation of the 0-1 error over 125 trials on Long and Servedio [2010]. Grayed cells denote the best performer at that noise rate.\n5Square loss escapes the result of Long and Servedio [2010] since it is not monotone decreasing.\nWe next consider minimisers of the empirical risk from a random training sample: we construct a training set of 800 instances, injected with varying levels of label noise, and evaluate classification performance on a test set of 1000 instances. We compare the hinge, t-logistic (for t = 2) [Ding and Vishwanathan, 2010] and unhinged minimisers. For each loss, we use a linear scorer without a bias term, and set the regularisation strength λ = 10−16. From Table 1, it is apparent that even at 40% label noise, the unhinged classifier is able to find a perfect solution. By contrast, both other losses suffer at even moderate noise rates.\nWe next report results on some UCI datasets, where we additionally tune a threshold so as to ensure the best training set 0-1 accuracy. Table 2 summarises results on a sample of four datasets. (Appendix H contains results with more datasets, performance metrics, and losses.) While the unhinged loss is sometimes outperformed at low noise, it tends to be much more robust at high levels of noise: even at noise close to 50%, it is often able to learn a classifier with some discriminative power."

      "text" : "We now present proofs of all results in the main body.\nProof of Proposition 1. This result is stated implicitly in Long and Servedio [2010, Theorem 2]; the aim of this proof is simply to make the result explicit.\nLet X = {(1, 0), (γ, 5γ), (γ,−γ), (γ,−γ)} ⊂ R2, for some γ < 1/6. Let the marginal distribution over X be uniform. Let η : x 7→ 1, i.e. let every example be deterministically positive.\nNow suppose we observe some SLN(D, ρ), for ρ ∈ [0, 1/2). We minimise the `-risk some convex potential ` : (y, v) 7→ φ(y, v) using a linear function class6 Flin. Then, Long and Servedio [2010, Theorem 2] establishes that\n(∀s ∈ SD,Flin,∗` )L D 01(s) =\n1 2 .\nOn the other hand, since D is linearly separable and a convex potential ` is classification-calibrated, we must have LD01(S D,Flin,∗ ` ) = 0. Consequently, for any convex potential `, (`,Flin) is not SLN-robust.\nProof of Proposition 2. Let η be the class-probability function of D. By [Natarajan et al., 2013, Lemma 7],\n(∀x ∈ X) sign(2η(x)− 1) = sign(2η(x)− 1),\nso that the optimal classifiers on the clean and corrupted distributions coincide. Therefore, intuitively, if the Bayes-optimal solution for loss recovers sign(2η(x) − 1), it will also recover sign(2η(x) − 1). Formally, since ` is classification-calibrated, for any D ∈ ∆, and s ∈ SD,∗`\n(∀x ∈ X) sign(s(x)) = sign(2η(x)− 1),\nand similarly, for any D ∈ Nsln(D), and s̄ ∈ SD,∗`\n(∀x ∈ X) sign(s̄(x)) = sign(2η(x)− 1).\nThus, for any D,D, since the 0-1 risk of a scorer depends only on its sign,\nLD01(s) = LD01(s) = LD01(sign(2η − 1)) = LD01(sign(2η − 1)) = LD01(s̄).\nConsequently, i.e. (`,RX) is SLN-robust.\nProof of Proposition 3. (⇐= ). If ` satisfies Equation 6, then its noise corrected counterpart is\n(∀y ∈ {±1})(∀v ∈ R) `(y, v) = 1 1− 2ρ · `(y, v)− C · ρ 1− 2ρ ,\nthat is, it is a scaled and translated version of `. Consequently, for any ρ, the corresponding risk will be a scaled and translated version of the `-risk. It is immediate that the two losses will be order equivalent for any ρ.\n( =⇒ ). Recall that S denotes the distribution of scores. For any stochastic scorer f , let\nSf : a 7→ P(S = a) 6The result actually requires that one not include a bias term; with a bias term, it can be checked that the example as-stated has a\ntrivial solution.\nbe the corresponding marginal distribution of scores. Similarly, let\nMa : x 7→ P(X = x | S = a)\nbe the conditional distribution of instances given a predicted score a ∈ R. Finally, for any a ∈ R, let Da = (Ma, η) be an induced distribution over X× {±1}.\nWith the above, we can rewrite the stochastic risk as\nLD` (f) = E S∼Sf\n[ E\n(X,Y)∼DS [`(Y,S)] ] = E\nS∼Sf\n[ LDS` (S) ] .\nThat is, we average, over all achievable scores according to f , the risks of that constant prediction on an appropriately reweighed version of the original distribution D. Then, for some fixed ρ ∈ [0, 1/2), the fact that ` and ` are order equivalent can be written\n(∀D) (∀f, g ∈ ∆XR ) E S∼Sf\n[ LDS` (S) ] ≤ E\nS∼Sg\n[ LDS` (S) ] ⇐⇒ E\nS∼Sf\n[ LDS ` (S) ] ≤ E\nS∼Sg\n[ LDS ` (S) ] .\nNow define the utility functions UD : a 7→ −LDa` (a)\nand V D : a 7→ −LDa\n` (a).\nThen, order equivalence can be trivially re-expressed as\n(∀D) (∀f, g ∈ ∆XR ) E S∼Sf\n[ UD(S) ] ≥ E\nS∼Sg\n[ UD(S) ] ⇐⇒ E\nS∼Sf\n[ V D(S) ] ≥ E\nS∼Sg\n[ V D(S) ] .\nThat is, for any fixed distribution D, the utility functions UD, V D specify the same ordering over distributions in ∆R. Therefore, by DeGroot [1970, Section 7.9, Theorem 2], for any fixed D, they must be affinely related:\n(∀D) (∃α, β ∈ R) (∀a ∈ R)UD(a) = α · V D(a) + β. Converting this back to losses, and using the definition of strong SLN-robustness,\n(∀D) (∀ρ ∈ [0, 1/2)) (∃α, β ∈ R) (∀a ∈ R)LDa` (a) = α · L Da ` (a) + β\nor (∀D) (∀ρ ∈ [0, 1/2)) (∃α, β ∈ R) (∀a ∈ R) E\n(X,Y)∼Da\n[ `(Y, a)− (α · `(Y, a) + β) ] = 0.\nFor this to hold for all possible D, it must be true that\n(∀ρ ∈ [0, 1/2)) (∃α, β ∈ R) (∀y, v) `(y, v) = α · `(y, v) + β.\nBy Lemma 9, the result follows.\nProof of Proposition 4. (⇐= ). Clearly for an ` satisfying the given condition, `1(v) + `−1(v) = B + C, a constant.\n( =⇒ ). By assumption, `1 is convex. By the given condition, equivalently, (∃C ∈ R)C − `1 is convex. But this is in turn equivalent to−`1 also being convex. The only possibility for both `1 and−`1 being convex is that `1 is affine, hence showing the desired implication.\nProof of Proposition 5. Fix ` = `unh. It is easy to check that\n(∀η ∈ [0, 1]) (∀v ∈ R)L`(η, v) = (1− 2η) · v, (12)\nand so\n(∀η ∈ [0, 1]) argmin v∈[−B,+B] L`(η, v) = { +B if η > 12 −B else.\nProof of Proposition 6. Fix ` = `unh. Since by Equation 12 L`unh(η, v) = (1− 2η) · v, we have that\nLD` (s) = − E X∼M [(2η(X)− 1) · s(X)] ,\nand since the restricted Bayes-optimal scorer is x 7→ B · sign(2η(x)− 1),\nLD,FB ,∗` = −B · EX∼M [|2η(X)− 1|] .\nThus, regretD,FB` (s) = EX∼M [|2η(X)− 1| · (B − s(X) · sign(2η(X)− 1))]\nNow, since the scorer x 7→ sign(2η(x) − 1) ∈ SD,∗01 ∩ FB , we have that regret D,FB 01 (s) = regret D 01(s).\nFurther, we have that\nregretD01(s) = E X∼M [|2η(X)− 1| · Js(X) · sign(2η(X)− 1) < 0K] .\nBut if B ≥ 1, Jv < 0K ≤ B − v.\nThus, regretD,FB01 (s) ≤ regret D,FB ` (s).\nFinally, by Equation 4, for ` = `unh,\n(∀y ∈ {±1}) (∀v ∈ R) `(y, v) = 1 1− 2ρ · `(y, v),\ni.e. the unhinged loss is its own noise-corrected loss, with a scaling factor of 11−2ρ . Thus, since the `-regret on D and `-regret on D coincide,\nregretD,FB` (s) = regret D,FB `\n(s) = 1\n1− 2ρ · regretD,FB` (s).\nProof of Proposition 7. On a distribution D, a soft-margin SVM solves\nmin w∈H E (X,Y)∼D\n[max(0, 1− Y · 〈w,Φ(x)〉H)] + λ\n2 〈w,w〉2H.\nLet w∗hinge,λ denote the optimal solution to this objective. Now, by Shalev-Shwartz et al. [2007, Theorem 1],\n||w∗hinge,λ||H ≤ 1√ λ .\nNow suppose that R = supx∈X ||Φ(x)||H <∞. Then, by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality,\n(∀x ∈ X) |〈w∗hinge,λ,Φ(x)〉H| ≤ ||w∗hinge,λ||H · ||Φ(x)||H ≤ R√ λ .\nIt follows that if λ ≥ R2, then (∀x ∈ X) |〈w∗hinge,λ,Φ(x)〉H| ≤ 1. But this means that we never activate the flat portion of the hinge loss. Thus, for λ ≥ R2, the SVM objective is equivalent to\nmin w∈H E (X,Y)∼D\n[1− Y · 〈w,Φ(x)〉H] + λ\n2 〈w,w〉2H.\nwhich means the optimal solution will coincide with that of the regularised unhinged loss. Therefore, we can view unhinged loss minimisation as corresponding to learning a highly regularised SVM7.\n7This also holds if we add a regularised bias term. With an unregularised bias term, Bedo et al. [2006] showed that the limiting solution of a soft-margin SVM is distribution dependent.\nProof of Proposition 8. Fix some distribution D. Let\nµ = E (X,Y)∼D [Y · Φ(X)]\nbe the optimal unhinged solution with regularisation strength λ = 1. Observe that ||µ||H ≤ R = supx∈X ||Φ(x)||H < ∞. For some r > 0, let\nw∗φ = argmin ||w||H≤r LDφ (w)\nbe the optimal φ solution with norm bounded by r. Similarly, let\nw∗unh = ||w∗φ|| · µ\n||µ||H\nbe the optimal unhinged solution with the same norm as the optimal φ solution. We will show that these two vectors have similar unhinged risks, and use this to show that the corresponding unit vectors must be close.\nBy definition, a convex potential has φ′(0) < 0. Without loss of generality, we can scale the potential so that φ′(0) = −1. Then, since φ is convex, it is lower bounded by the linear approximation at zero:\n(∀v ∈ R)φ(v)− φ(0) ≥ −v.\nObserve that the RHS is the unhinged loss. Thus, the unhinged risk can be bounded by its φ counterpart. In particular, at the optimal φ solution,\nLunh(w∗φ) ≤ Lφ(w∗φ)− φ(0).\nTherefore, the difference between the unhinged and φ optimal solutions is\nLunh(w∗φ)− Lunh(w∗unh) ≤ Lφ(w∗φ)− Lunh(w∗unh)− φ(0) ≤ Lφ(w∗unh)− Lunh(w∗unh)− φ(0) = E\n(X,Y)∼D [φ(Y〈w∗unh,Φ(X)〉H) + Y〈w∗unh,Φ(X)〉H]− φ(0)\n= E (X,Y)∼D\n[ φ̃(Y〈w∗unh,Φ(X)〉H) ] , (13)\nwhere φ̃ : v 7→ φ(v) − φ(0) + v. (The second line follows by definition of optimality of w∗φ amongst all vectors with norm bounded by r.) We have already established that φ̃ ≥ 0. Now, by Taylor’s remainder theorem,\n(∀v ∈ (−1, 1)) φ̃(v) ≤ a 2 v2, (14)\nwhere a = maxv∈[−1,1] φ′′(v). But by Cauchy-Schwartz, we can restrict attention in Equation 13 to the behaviour of φ̃ in the interval\nI = [−||w∗unh||H ·R, ||w∗unh||H ·R],\nwhere R = supx∈X ||Φ(x)||H <∞. Therefore, if r ≤ 1R , Equation 14 and a further application of CauchySchwartz yield\nLunh(w∗φ)− Lunh(w∗unh) ≤ a\n2 · E (X,Y)∼D\n[ 〈w∗unh,Φ(X)〉2H) ] ≤ a\n2 · E X∼M\n[ ||w∗unh||2H · ||Φ(X)||2H ] ≤ aR 2\n2 · ||w∗unh||2H.\nNow, the unhinged risk is LDunh(w) = −〈w, µ〉H.\nThus,\n−〈w∗φ, µ〉H + 〈w∗unh, µ〉H ≤ aR2\n2 · ||w∗unh||2H.\nRearranging, and by definition of w∗unh,\n〈w∗φ, µ〉H ≥ 〈w∗unh, µ〉H − aR2\n2 · ||w∗unh||2H\n= ||w∗φ||H · ||µ||H − aR2\n2 · ||w∗φ||2H = ||w∗φ||H · ||µ||H · ( 1− aR 2\n2||µ||H · ||w∗φ||H ) ≥ ||w∗φ||H · ||µ||H · ( 1− aR 2 2||µ||H · r ) ,\nwhere the last line is since by definition ||w∗φ||H ≤ r. Thus, for = aR 2\n2||µ||H ,〈 w∗φ ||w∗φ||H , µ ||µ||H 〉 H ≥ 1− .\nIt follows that the two unit vectors can be made arbitrarily close to each other by decreasing r. Since this corresponds to increasing the strength of regularisation (by Lagrange duality), and since µ||µ||H corresponds to the normalised unhinged solution for any regularisation strength, the result follows.\nA.1 Additional helper lemmas Lemma 9.

We do this by looking at the minimisers of these losses on the 2D example of Long and Servedio [2010]. Of course, as these losses are non-convex, exact minimisation of the risk is challenging. However, as the search space is R2, we construct a grid of resolution 0.025 over [−10, 10]2. We then exhaustively compute the objective for all grid points, and seek the minimiser.\nWe apply this procedure to the Long and Servedio [2010] dataset with γ = 160 , and with a 30% noise rate. Figure 2 plots the results of the objective for the TangentBoost loss. We find that the minimiser is at w∗ = (0.2, 1.3). This results in a classifier with error rate of 12 on D. Similarly, from Figure 3, we find that the minimiser is w∗ = (1.025, 5.1), which also results in a classifier with error rate of 12 .\nThe shape of these plots suggests that the minimiser is indeed found in the interval [−10, 10]2. To further verify this, we performed L-BFGS minimisation of these losses using 100 different random initialisations, uniformly from [−100, 100]2. We find that in each trial, the TangentBoost solution converges to w∗ = (0.2122, 1.3031), while the t-logistic solution converges to w∗ = (1.0372, 5.0873), both of which result in accuracy of 12 on D.\nB.1 In defence of non-convex losses: beyond SLN-robustness The above illustrates the possible non SLN-robustness of two non-convex losses. However, there may be other notions under which these losses are robust. For example, Ding and Vishwanathan [2010] defines\nrobustness to be a stability of the asymptotic maximum likelihood solution when adding a new labelled instance (chosen arbitrarily from X × {±1}), based on a definition in O’Hagan [1979]. Intuitively, this captures robustness to outliers in the instance space, so that e.g. an adversarial mislabelling of an instance far from the true decision boundary does not adversely affect the learned model. Such a notion of robustness is clearly of practical interest, and future study of such alternate notions would be of value.\nB.2 Conjecture: (most) strictly proper composite losses are not SLN-robust More abstractly, we conjecture the above can be generalised to the following. Recall that a loss ` is strictly proper composite [Reid and Williamson, 2010] if its (unique) Bayes-optimal scorer is some strictly monotone transformation ψ of the class-probability function: (∀D) SD,∗` = {ψ ◦ η}.\nConjecture 1. Pick any strictly proper composite (but not necessarily convex) ` whose link function has range R. Then, (`,Flin) is not SLN-robust.\nWe believe the above is true for the following reason. Suppose D is some linearly separable distribution, with η : x 7→ J〈w∗, x〉 > 0K for some w∗. Then, minimising ` with Flin will be well-specified: the Bayesoptimal scorer is ψ(J〈w∗, x〉 > 0K). If the range of ψ is R, then this is equivalent to∞· (2J〈w∗, x〉 > 0K−1), which is in Flin if we allow for the extended reals. The resulting classifier will thus have 100% accuracy.\nHowever, by injecting any non-zero label noise, minimising ` with Flin will no longer be well-specified, as η takes on the values {1 − ρ, ρ}, which cannot be the sole set of output scores for any linear scorer if |X| > 3. We believe it unlikely that every such misspecified solution have 100% accuracy on D. We further believe it likely that one can exhibit a scenario, possibly the same as the Long and Servedio [2010] example, where the resulting solution has accuracy 50%.\nTwo further comments are in order. First, if a loss is strictly proper composite, then it cannot satisfy Equation 6, and hence it cannot be strongly SLN-robust. (However, this does leave open the possibility that with Flin, the loss is SLN-robust.) Second, observe that the restriction that ψ have range R is necessary to rule out cases such as square loss, where the link function has range [−1, 1]."

      "text" : "We discuss some further connections of the unhinged loss to existing methods.\nE.1 Unhinging the SVM We can motivate the unhinged loss intuitively by studying the noise-corrected versions of the hinge loss, as per Equation 4. Figure 4 shows the noise corrected hinge loss for ρ ∈ {0, 0.2, 0.4}. We see that as the noise rate increases, the effect is to slightly unhinge the original loss, by removing its flat portion8. Thus, if we knew the noise rate ρ, we could use these slightly unhinged losses to learn.\nOf course, in general we do not know the noise rate. Further, the slightly unhinged losses are non-convex. So, in order to be robust to an arbitrary noise rate ρ, we can completely unhinge the loss, yielding\n`unh1 (v) = 1− v and `unh−1 (v) = 1 + v.\nE.2 Relation to centroid classifiers As established in §6.1, the optimal unhinged classifier (Equation 9) is equivalent to a centroid classifier, where one replaces the positive and negative classes by their centroids, and performs classification based on the distance of an instance to the two centroids. Such a classifier has been proposed as a prototypical example of a simple kernel-based classifier [Schölkopf and Smola, 2002, Section 1.2], [Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004, Section 5.1] Balcan et al. [2008, Definition 4] considers such classification rules using general similarity functions in place of kernels corresponding to an RKHS.\nThe optimal unhinged classifier is also closely related to the Rocchio classifier in information retrieval [Manning et al., 2008, pg. 181], and the nearest centroid classifier in computational genomics [Tibshirani et al., 2002]. The optimal kernelised scorer for these approaches is [Doloc-Mihu et al., 2003]\ns∗ : x 7→ (\nE X∼P [k(X, x)]− E X∼Q [k(X, x)]\n) ,\ni.e. it does not weight each of the kernel means.\nE.3 Relation to kernel density estimation When working with an RKHS with a translation invariant kernel9, the optimal unhinged scorer (Equation 9) can be interpreted as follows: perform kernel density estimation on the positive and negative classes, and then classify instances according to Bayes’ rule. For example, with a Gaussian RBF kernel, the classifier is equivalent to using a Gaussian kernel to compute density estimates of P,Q, and using these to classify. This is known as a kernel classification rule [Devroye et al., 1996, Chapter 10].\n8Another interesting observation is that these noise-corrected losses are negatively unbounded – that is, minimising hinge loss on D is equivalent to minimising a negatively unbounded loss on D. This is another justification for studying negatively unbounded losses.\n9For a general (not necessarily translation invariant) kernel, this is known as a potential function rule [Devroye et al., 1996, §10.3]. The use of “potential” here is distinct from that of a “convex potential”.\nThis perspective suggests that in computing s∗unh,λ, we may also estimate the corrupted class-probability\nfunction. In particular, observe that if we compute π1−π · E X∼P [k(X,x)]\nE X∼Q\n[k(X,x)] , similar to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator\n[Bishop, 2006, pg. 300], then this provides an estimate of η(x)1−η(x) . Of course, such an approach will succumb to the curse of dimensionality10.\nAn alternative is to use the Probing reduction [Langford and Zadrozny, 2005], by computing an ensemble of cost-sensitive classifiers at varying cost ratios. To this end, observe that the following weighted unhinged (or whinge) loss,\n`whinge1 (v) = c1 · −v `whinge−1 (v) = c−1 · v\nfor some c−1 ∈ [0, 1] and c1 = 1− c−1, will have a restricted Bayes-optimal scorer of B · sign(η(x)− c−1) over FB . Further, it will result in an optimal scorer that simply weights each of the kernel means,\ns∗whinge,λ : x 7→ 1\nλ · E (X,Y)∼D [cY · Y · k(X, x)] ,\nmaking it trivial to compute as c is varied.\nE.4 Relation to the MMD witness The optimal weight vector for unhinged loss (Equation 8) can be expressed as\nw∗unh,λ = 1\nλ · (π · µP − (1− π) · µQ),\nwhere µP and µQ are the kernel mean maps with respect to H of the positive and negative class-conditionals distributions,\nµP = E X∼P [Φ(X)] µQ = E X∼Q [Φ(X)] .\nWhen π = 12 , ||w ∗ 1 ||H is precisely the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) [Gretton et al., 2012] between P and Q, using all functions in the unit ball of H. The mapping x 7→ 〈w∗1 , x〉H itself is referred to as the witness function [Gretton et al., 2012, §2.3]. While the motivation of MMD is to perform hypothesis testing so as to distinguish between two distributions P,Q, rather than constructing a suitable scorer, the fact that it arises from the optimal scorer for the unhinged loss has been previously noted [Sriperumbudur et al., 2009, Theorem 1]."

      "text" : "We illustrate that square loss with a linear function class may perform poorly even when the underlying distribution is linearly separable. We consider the dataset of Long and Servedio [2010], with no label noise. That is, we have X = {(1, 0), (γ, 5γ), (γ,−γ), (γ,−γ)} ⊂ R2, and η : x 7→ 1. Let X ∈ R4×2 be the feature matrix of the four data points. Then, the optimal weight vector learned by square loss is\nw∗ = (XTX)−1XT  1 1 1 1  = [ 8γ+3 8γ2+3\n− γ+13γ·(8γ2+3)\n] .\n10This refers to the rate of convergence of the estimate of η to the true η. By contrast, generalisation bounds establish that the rate of convergence of the estimate of the corresponding classifier to the Bayes-optimal classifier sign(2η(x) − 1) is independent of the dimension of the feature space.\nIt is easy to check that the predicted scores are then\ns∗ = \n8γ+3 8γ2+3 γ·(8γ+3)\n8γ2+3− 5·(γ−1)γ 24γ3+9γ\n(γ−1)·γ 24γ3+9γ+\nγ·(8γ+3) 8γ2+3\n(γ−1)·γ 24γ3+9γ+\nγ·(8γ+3) 8γ2+3\n .\nBut for γ < 112 , this means that the predicted scores for the last two examples are negative. That is, the resulting classifier will have 50% accuracy. (This does not contradict the robustness of square loss, as robustness simply requires that performance is the same with and without noise.)\nIt is initially surprising that square loss fails in this example, as we are employing a linear function class, and the true η is expressible as a linear function. However, recall that the Bayes-optimal scorer for square loss is\nS D,∗ ` = {s : x 7→ 2η(x)− 1}.\nIn this case, the Bayes-optimal scorer is\ns∗ : x 7→ 2Jx1 > 0K− 1.\nThe application of a threshold means the that scorer is not expressible as a linear model. Therefore, the combination of loss and function class is in fact not well-specified for the problem.\nTo clarify this point, consider the use of the squared hinge loss, `(y, v) = max(0, 1 − yv)2. This loss induces a set of Bayes-optimal scorers, which are:\nS D,∗ ` = s | (∀x ∈ X)  η(x) = 1 =⇒ s(x) ∈ [1,∞) η(x) ∈ (0, 1) =⇒ s(x) = 2η(x)− 1 η(x) = 0 =⇒ s(x) ∈ (−∞, 1].  Crucially, we can find a linear scorer that is in this set: for, say, v = ( 1γ , 0), we clearly have 〈v, x〉 ≥ 1 for every x ∈ X, and so this is a Bayes-optimal scorer. Thus, minimising the square hinge loss on this distribution will indeed find a classifier with 100% accuracy."

      "text" : "We illustrate that the unhinged loss with a linear function class may perform poorly even when the underlying distribution is linearly separable. (For another example where instances are on the unit ball, see Balcan et al. [2008, Figure 1].) Consider a distribution DM,η uniformly concentrated on X = {x1, x2, x3} with x1 = (1, 2), x2 = (1,−4), x3 = (−1, 1), with η(x1) = η(x2) = 1 and η(x3) = 0, i.e. the first two instances are positive, and the third instance negative. Then it is evident that the optimal unhinged hyperplane, with regularisation strength 1, is w∗ = (1,−1). This will misclassify the first instance as being negative. Figure 5 illustrates.\nIt is easy to check that for this particular distribution, the optimal weight for square loss is w∗ = (1, 0). This results in perfect classification. Thus, we have a reversal of the scenario of the previous section – here, square loss classifies perfectly, while the unhinged loss classifies no better than random guessing.\nIt may appear that the above contradicts the classification-calibration of the unhinged loss: there certainly is a linear scorer that is Bayes-optimal over FB , namely, w∗ = (B, 0). The subtlety is that in this case, minimisation over the unit ball ||w||2 ≤ 1 (as implied by `2 regularisation) is unable to restrict attention to the desired scorer.\nThere are two ways to rectify examples such as the above. First, as in general, we can employ a suitably rich kernel, e.g. a Gaussian RBF kernel. It is not hard to verify that on this dataset, such a kernel will find a perfect classifier. Second, we can look to explicitly enforce that minimisation is over all w satisfying |〈w, xn〉| ≤ 1. This will result in a linear program (LP) that may be solved easily, but does not admit a closed\nform solution as in the case of minimising over the unit ball. It may be checked that the resulting LP will recover the optimal weight w∗ = (1, 0). While this approach is suitable for this particular example, issues arise when dealing with infinite dimensional feature mappings (as we lose the existence of a representer theorem without regularisation based on the norm in the Hilbert space [Yu et al., 2013]).\nAdditional Experiments for “Learning with Symmetric Label Noise: The Importance of Being Unhinged”"

As before, we find the unhinged loss to generally find a good classifier. Observe that the relatively poor performance of the square and TanBoost loss can be attributed to the findings of Appendix B, F.\nWe next report the 0-1 error and one minus the AUC for a range of datasets. We begin with a dataset of Mease and Wyner [2008], where X = [0, 1]20, and M is the uniform distribution. Further, we have η : x 7→ J〈w∗, x〉 > 2.5K for w∗ = [ 15 015 ] , i.e. there is a sparse separating hyperplane. Table 5 reports the results on this dataset injected with various levels of symmetric noise. On this dataset, the t-logistic loss generally performs the best.\nFinally, we report the 0-1 error and one minus the AUC on some UCI datasets in Tables 6 – 7. Table 3 summarises statistics of the UCI data. Several datasets are imbalanced, meaning that 0-1 error is not the ideal measure of performance (as it can be made small with a trivial majority classifier). The AUC is thus arguably a better indication of performance for these datasets. We generally find that at high noise rates (40%), the AUC of the unhinged loss is superior to that of other losses."

    "abstractText" : "Convex potential minimisation is the de facto approach to binary classification. However, Long and Servedio [2010] proved that under symmetric label noise (SLN), minimisation of any convex potential over a linear function class can result in classification performance equivalent to random guessing. This ostensibly shows that convex losses are not SLN-robust. In this paper, we propose a convex, classificationcalibrated loss and prove that it is SLN-robust. The loss avoids the Long and Servedio [2010] result by virtue of being negatively unbounded. The loss is a modification of the hinge loss, where one does not clamp at zero; hence, we call it the unhinged loss. We show that the optimal unhinged solution is equivalent to that of a strongly regularised SVM, and is the limiting solution for any convex potential; this implies that strong `2 regularisation makes most standard learners SLN-robust. Experiments confirm the SLN-robustness of the unhinged loss. 1 Learning with symmetric label noise Binary classification is the canonical supervised learning problem. Given an instance space X, and samples from some distribution D over X × {±1}, the goal is to learn a scorer s : X → R with low misclassification error on future samples drawn from D. Our interest is in the more realistic scenario where the learner observes samples from a distribution D, which is a corruption of D where labels have some constant probability of being flipped. The goal is still to perform well with respect to the unobserved distribution D. This is known as the problem of learning from symmetric label noise (SLN learning) [Angluin and Laird, 1988]. Long and Servedio [2010] proved the following negative result on what is possible in SLN learning: there exists a linearly separableD where, when the learner observes some corruptionD with symmetric label noise of any nonzero rate, minimisation of any convex potential over a linear function class results in classification performance on D that is equivalent to random guessing. Ostensibly, this establishes that convex losses are not “SLN-robust” and motivates the use of non-convex losses [Stempfel and Ralaivola, 2009, Masnadi-Shirazi et al., 2010, Ding and Vishwanathan, 2010, Denchev et al., 2012, Manwani and Sastry, 2013]. In this paper, we propose a convex loss and prove that it is SLN-robust. The loss avoids the result of Long and Servedio [2010] by virtue of being negatively unbounded. The loss is a modification of the hinge loss where one does not clamp at zero; thus, we call it the unhinged loss. We show that this is the unique convex loss (up to scaling and translation) that satisfies a notion of “strong SLN-robustness ” (Proposition 4). In addition to being SLN-robust, this loss has several attractive properties, such as being classification-calibrated (Proposition 5), consistent when minimised on the corrupted distribution (Proposition 6), and having an easily computable optimal solution that is the difference of two kernel means (Equation 9). Finally, we show that this optimal solution is equivalent to that of a strongly regularised SVM (Proposition 7), and such a result holds more generally for any twice-differentiable convex potential (Proposition 8), implying that strong `2 regularisation endows most standard learners with SLN-robustness. 1 ar X iv :1 50 5. 07 63 4v 1 [ cs .L G ] 2 8 M ay 2 01 5 The classifier resulting from minimising the unhinged loss is not new [Devroye et al., 1996, Chapter 10], [Schölkopf and Smola, 2002, Section 1.2], [Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004, Section 5.1]. However, establishing this classifier’s SLN-robustness, its equivalence to a highly regularised SVM solution, and showing the underlying loss uniquely satisfies a notion of strong SLN-robustness, to our knowledge is novel. 2 Background and problem setup Fix an instance space X. We denote by D some distribution over X×{±1}, with random variables (X,Y) ∼ D. Any D may be expressed via the class-conditional distributions (P,Q) = (P(X | Y = 1),P(X | Y = −1)) and base rate π = P(Y = 1), or equivalently via the marginal distribution M = P(X) and classprobability function η : x 7→ P(Y = 1 | X = x). We interchangeably write D as DP,Q,π or DM,η. 2.1 Classifiers, scorers, and risks A scorer is any function s : X → R. A loss is any function ` : {±1} × R → R. We use `−1, `1 to refer to `(−1, ·) and `(1, ·). The `-conditional risk L` : [0, 1] × R → R is defined as L` : (η, v) 7→ η · `1(v) + (1 − η) · `−1(v). Given a distribution D, the `-risk of a scorer s is defined as L` (s) . = E (X,Y)∼D [`(Y, s(X))] , (1) or equivalently L` (s) = E X∼M [L`(η(X), s(X))]. For a set S, L` (S) is the set of `-risks for all scorers in S. A function class is any F ⊆ R. Given some F, the set of restricted Bayes-optimal scorers for a loss ` are those scorers in F that minimise the `-risk: S D,F,∗ ` . = Argmin s∈F L` (s). The set of (unrestricted) Bayes-optimal scorers is S ` = S D,F,∗ ` for F = R. The restricted `-regret of a scorer is its excess risk over that of any restricted Bayes-optimal scorer: regret ` (s) . = L` (s)− inf t∈F L` (t). Binary classification is concerned with the risk corresponding to the zero-one loss, ` : (y, v) 7→ Jyv < 0K + 12Jv = 0K. A loss ` is classification-calibrated if all its Bayes-optimal scorers are also optimal for zeroone loss: (∀D) S ` ⊆ S D,∗ 01 .A convex potential is any loss ` : (y, v) 7→ φ(yv), where φ : R→ R+ is convex, non-increasing, differentiable with φ′(0) < 0, and φ(+∞) = 0 [Long and Servedio, 2010, Definition 1]. All convex potential losses are classification-calibrated [Bartlett et al., 2006, Theorem 2.1]. 2.2 Learning with symmetric label noise (SLN learning) The problem of learning with symmetric label noise (SLN learning) is the following [Angluin and Laird, 1988, Kearns, 1998, Blum and Mitchell, 1998, Natarajan et al., 2013]. For some notional “clean” distribution D, which we would like to observe, we instead observe samples from some corrupted distribution SLN(D, ρ), for some ρ ∈ [0, 1/2). The distribution SLN(D, ρ) is such that the marginal distribution of instances is unchanged, but each label is independently flipped with probability ρ. The goal is to learn a scorer from these corrupted samples such that L01(s) is small. For any quantity in D, we denote its corrupted counterparts in SLN(D, ρ) with a bar, e.g. M for the corrupted marginal distribution, and η for the corrupted class-probability function; additionally, when ρ is clear from context, we will occasionally refer to SLN(D, ρ) by D. By definition of the corruption process, the corruption marginal distribution M = M , and [Natarajan et al., 2013, Lemma 7] (∀x ∈ X) η(x) = (1− 2ρ) · η(x) + ρ. (2)",
