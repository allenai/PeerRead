      "text" : "The number of optimization techniques in the combinatorial domain is large and diversified. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of real benchmarks to validate optimization algorithms. In this work we introduce VRPBench, a tool to create instances and visualize solutions to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) in a planar graph embedded in the Euclidean 2D space. We use VRPBench to model a real-world mail delivery case of the city of Artur Nogueira. Such scenarios were characterized as a multi-objective optimization of the VRP. We extracted a weighted graph from a digital map of the city to create a challenging benchmark for the VRP. Each instance models one generic day of mail delivery with hundreds to thousands of delivery points, thus allowing both the comparison and validation of optimization algorithms for routing problems.\nKeywords: Benchmark, VRP, Graphs and Combinatorial Optimisa-\ntion, Free Software Tool.\n1School of Technology, University of Campinas, Limeira – SP – Brazil\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n05 40\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 8"

      "text" : "Benchmarks are found in various fields of science, such as geology [13], economy [25], climatology [36], among other areas. Specifically in computer science, benchmarks play a central role, e.g. in image processing [15, 29, 22], hardware performance [7] and optimization [32, 28, 5].\nIn the context of optimization, David S. Johnson [24] divided algorithm analysis in three approaches: the worst-case, the average-case, and the experimental analysis. Relative to experimental papers, he identifies four situations: (i) to solve a real problem; (ii) to provide evidence that an algorithm is superior than the others; (iii) to better understand a problem; and (iv) to study the average-case. He suggests the use of well-established benchmarks to provide evidence of the superiority of an algorithm (item ii). Such papers are called horse race papers.\nJohnson highlights that reproducibility and comparability are essential aspects present in any experimental paper. He also advocates the use of instances that lead to general conclusions. The author mentions the difficulty in justifying experiments on problems with no direct application. Such problems have no real instances and the researcher is forced to generate the data in a vacuum. Johnson cautions against a pitfall: the researcher starts by using randomly-generated instances to evaluate the algorithms and ends up using the algorithm to explore the properties of the randomly-generated instances. According to him, another pitfall is spending time processing useless experiments that attempt to answer the wrong questions.\nOur work deals with a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) based on a real mail delivery case of the city of Artur Nogueira (see the contributions at the end of this section). One of the first references to the VRP dates back to 1959 [14] under the name Truck Dispaching Problem, a generalization of the Traveler Salesman Problem (TSP).\nThe term VRP was first seen in the paper by Christophides [9], in 1976.\nChristophides defines VRP as a generic name, given to a class of problems that involves the visit of “customers” using vehicles.\nReal world aspects may impose variants of the problem. For example, the Capacitaded-VRP (CVRP) [18] considers a limit to the vehicle capacity, the VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW) [26] accounts for delivery time windows, and the Multi-Depot VRP (MDVRP) [34] extends the number of depots. Other variants may be easily found in the literature.\nIn 1991, Reinelt [32] created a benchmark for the TSP, known as TSPLib. In his work, he consolidated non-solved instances from twenty distinct papers. His repository (TSPLIB95) [33] has instances of both the symmetric and the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP/aTSP) as well as three related problems: (i) CVRP; (ii) Sequential Ordered Problem (SOP); and (iii) Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (HCP).\nThe number of instances is 113, 19, 16, 41, 9 for TSP, aTSP, CVRP, SOP, and HCP, respectively. The number of vertices varies from 14 to 85900 for the TSP, 17 to 443 for the aTSP, 7 to 262 for the CVRP, 7 to 378 for the SOP, and from 1000 to 5000 for the HCP.\nThe optimum of all TSPLib instances was finally achieved in 2007, after sixteen years of notable progress in the development of algorithms. The optimum of the d15112 instance was found in 2001 [2]. This instance contains 15112 German cities and required 22.6 years of processing split across 110 500MHz processors [12]. The instance pla33810 was solved [2] in March 2004. The pla33810 instance represents a printed circuit board with 33810 nodes and it was solved in 15.7 years of processing [16]. The last instance of the TSPLib, called pla85900, was solved in 2006 [2]. This instance contains 85900 nodes representing a VLSI application.\nSolomon [35] created a benchmark for the VRPTW in 1987. It is composed by 56 instances partitioned in 6 sets. The number of customers is 100 in all instances. The vehicle has a fixed capacity and the customers\nhave demand or weight. The number of vehicles is not fixed, but it derives the fact that there is a limit of capacity. In this view, the problem can be considered multi-objective. It aims to minimize the route and the number of vehicles.\nThe first optimum solution was published in 1999 [27]. In 2005, Chabrier [6] managed to solve 17 of the instances that still had remained unsolved in the benchmark. In 2010, Amini et. al [1] obtained solutions very close to optimum, considering the first 25 customers only. In july 2015, after 28 years of the benchmark launching, Jawarneh and Abdullah [23] published in PlosONE a Bee Colony Optimization metaheuristic. Such algorithm reached 11 new best results in Solomon’s 56 VRPTW 100 customer instances. It is really surprising that such small instances have an internal structure so complex to be optimized. In Figure 1, there is a simple instance of Solomon’s composed by 100 customers and its solution considering 3 ve-\nhicles.Table 1\nRC207 NO. XCOORD. YCOORD.

Bent and Hentenryck proposed the solution containing 3 routes, in 2001 [4]. The picture does not show the capacity and the time windows constraints.\nDespite of their complexity, the TSPLib and the Solomon benchmarks\n4\nhave a number of customers between 100 and 262 for the VRP, which is a small value nowadays. Gehring and Homberger [19] extended the instances of Solomon, creating a benchmark with a numbers of customers varying from 100 to 1000 for the VRPTW.\nFor the CVRP, there is a set of instances largely used, named as ABEFMP, in which Augerat [3] proposed the classes A, B, P in 1995 and [10, 17, 8] proposed the classes E, F, M in 1969, 1994 and 1979, respectively. In this benchmark, the number of customers varies from 13 to 200 and the number of vehicles varies from 2 to 17.\nA series of different works, such as [18, 11] among others, obtained the optimum in different ABEFMP instances. [31] found in 2014 the optimum solution for the last instance unsolved, named M-n151-k12, 35 years after its presentation by Christofides [8]. Despite that, most of those instances are very simple to solve nowadays.\nGolden et al. [20] proposed new instances for the CVRP, in 1998. It is a set of 20 instances, with the number of customers varying from 240 to 483. Such a benchmark remains entertaining, because most of its instances has not an optimum established yet [38]. In 2005, Li, Golden and Wasil [30] created a set of instances with the number of customers between 560 and 1200. Up to this moment, there is no optimum defined for any of the instances [38].\nIn 2014, Uchoa et. al. created a library, the CVRPLib [38]. In this library, they consolidated the CVRP instances of the works [3, 10, 8, 17, 20, 30]. Besides, Uchoa et. al [37] generated new instances with the number of customers between 100 and 1000. In this work, they point the lack of well established challenging benchmarks for the VRP.\nUchoa et. al. also point the fact that benchmarks are created artificially. Solomon and Uchoa et. al. generated their own instances using random points. In the benchmark ABEFMP, there is some random instances generated and other instances that represent real problems. However, in all\ninstances the customers are points in the Euclidean space. The instances of Golden et al. [20] and Li, Golden and Wasil [30] are artificial as well.\nContribution: In this work, we propose the VRPBench tool, a vehicle\nrouting problem benchmark tool for the mail delivery Problem. We propose instances for the VRP involving a real situation: the delivery of correspondence by the postmen in the Artur Nogueira road network. Artur Nogueira is a brazilian city, located at 22◦34′22”S47◦10′22”W . Every day, the post office gets a large number (thousands) of letters to be delivered. The letters are distributed to a set of 20-25 postmen. The postmen walk around the city, delivering the mail.\nThe problem described above is modeled as VRP. Each postman is a vehicle and each delivery point is a customer. We abstracted the streets and avenues of the city in an weighted undirected graph. The street corners and the delivery points both became vertices and the streets became edges. The weight of an edge is proportional to the time needed to travel it.\nAfter talking to experts, two objectives were detected to minimize: the average route length; and the injustice, measured as the unbalancing weight between the postmen.\nThe postmen do not have capacity, but the routes do have. Each postman can carry 10kg if man or 8kg if woman, however there is a car support that supplies the load to the postmen, which turns their capacities unlimited in mathematical terms. Meanwhile, each postmen must follow a working day close to 6h per day, which generates a maximum capacity for the route.\nDefining capacity in the route length and not in the vehicle is something that applies to several situations. A helicopter has a route limited by its fuel tank. The workers, in general, have a time window to operate the vehicle, which limits the length of the route.\nAccording to our knowledge, this is one of the first benchmarks for the VRP with thousands of customers and that models a real-life situation in a\nroad network."

      "text" : "Consider a weighted (directed or undirected) graph G(V,E) where a depot is a special vertice π ∈ V . This research do not adresse multiple deposits variants of VRP . Consider a cost function w′ : E → Q+\nThe set of customers is defined by C = V \\ {π} and the number of customers is denoted by n, where C = {c1, . . . , cn}. The number of vehicles in the fleet is represented by k ∈ N. The value k is traditionally considered a constant, but it is possible to define variants of VRP where k is variable.\nLet w(u, v,G) be the shortest path cost between vertices u and v in the graph G. We use w(u, v) to represent w(u, v,G) whenever G is known within the context. We represent a solution as a sequence the vertices. Let\nS(C, k) = (c1, . . . , cn, π, . . . , π).\nThis sequence is created as follows: (i) all the customers are inserted in S; (ii) the deposit vertice is inserted k − 1 times. Each permutation of S(C, k) represents a solution to the VRP. For example, consider the graph illustrated in Fig. 2:\nS(C, k) = (c1, . . . , cn, π, . . . , π).\nEsta sequencia é montada da seguinte maneira. Primeiro, todos os clientes são inseridos em S.\nApós isso, são inseriodos k − 1 vezes o vértices depósito. Se o conjunto de clientes C e o número\nde veículos k estiverem claros no contexto, poderemos usar S para represnetar S(C, k).\nCada permutação de S representa uma solução do VRP. Para exemplificar, considere o grafo\nConsidere os vértices da descritos na Figura 4. Considere o número de veículos igual a 3, ou\nseja k = 3. A sequência S(C, 3) neste caso seria:\nS(C, 3) = (c1, . . . , c13, π, π).\nCada permutação de S(C, 3) representa uma solução para o VRP. Por exemplo, a permutação\nS ′ = (c3, c5, c4, c1, c2, π, c6, c10, c11, c12, π, c7, c8, c9, c13)\nrepresenta a solução descrita na Figura 5\nConsider the vertices described in Fig. 2 and suppose that the number\n8\nof vehicles is 3 (i.e. k = 3). The S(C, 3) sequence is:\nS(C, 3) = (c1, . . . , c13, π, π).\n.\nEach permutation of S(C, 3) represents a solution to the VRP. For example,\nS ′ = (c3, c5, c4, c1, c2, π, c6, c10, c11, c12, π, c7, c8, c9, c13)\nis the solution described in Fig. 3.\nToda rota inicia e termina no depósito. A solução S ′ representa uma partição dos clientes em 3\nrotas: R1 = (c3, c5, c4, c1, c2), R2 = (c6, c10, c11, c12) e R3 = (c7, c8, c9, c13). Mais formalmente,\numa solução pode ser particionada em diversas rotas\nParticao(S) = (R1, . . . , Rk)\nonde a partição da solução é feita no depósito π.\nNo exemplo da Figura 5 temos que\nParticao(S ′) = ({c3, c5, c4, c1, c2} , {c6, c10, c11, c12} , {c7, c8, c9, c13}) .\nO comprimento de uma rota R = (r1, . . . , rm) é dado por:\nW (R) = w(π, r1) + w(rm, π) + m−1∑\ni=1\nw(ri, ri+1)\nAll routes begin and end at the depot. The S ′ solution represents a partition of the clients in 3 routes: R1 = (c3, c5, c4, c1, c2), R2 = (c6, c10, c11, c12) and R3 = (c7, c8, c9, c13). The vertex π is used to create a partition of the sequence in k routes:\nPartition(S) = (R1, . . . , k)\nwhere the the sequence is split in each k − 1 occurrence of π. In the example shown in Fig. 3. we have\nPartition(S ′) = ((c3, c5, c4, c1, c2) , (c6, c10, c11, c12) , (c7, c8, c9, c13))\n9\n. The length of a route R = (r1, . . . , rm) is given by:\nW (R) = w(π, r1) + w(rm, π) + m−1∑\ni=1\nw(ri, ri+1).\nThe length of a solution S = (s1, . . . , sm) is calculated in as\nW (S) = w(π, s1) + w(sm, π) + m−1∑\ni=1\nw(si, si+1).\nGiven a viable solution, it is necessary to calculate its cost f(S). The most tradicional objective function to be minimized is the length of the solution:\nf(S) = W (S).\n.\nHowever, in some situations the problem is considered as multi objective. One of the objectives is to minimize W (S) and the other is to minimize the number of vehicles.\nf1(S) = W (S), f2(S) = k.\nAssume a system that generates mailman routes. It is required that the solution meets the fairness criteria, i.e., routes are assigned in a way that are not unfair to the mailman, i.e. it does not penalize one mailman in relation to the other. One way to achieve fairness would be to minimize the variance of the length of the routes for each mailman.\nAs described in Section 1, VRP is a set of problems that consist in visiting customers using vehicles. Clearly, there are several variants of the VRP problem. In each, the cost of the solution is calculated differently. Furthermore, each case has additional requirements to find out whether or not a solution is viable.\nExamples of restrictions to the problem are:\nThere should be no empty routes, i.e. for each route Ri ∈ Partition(S) we must meet the condition that |Ri| > 0.\nEach customer c ∈ C has a demand d(c) (e.g. number of orders). Each vehicle in v ∈ {1, . . . , k} is characterized by a capacity c(v). This variant of VRP models situations where a driver (e.g. mailman) has a maximum weight limit. Therefore, a route Rv = (rv1 , . . . , rvm) must meet the requirement that m∑\ni=1\nd(rvi ) ≤ c(v), ∀v ∈ {1, . . . , k}.\n.\nConsider a variant of the VRP problem where the size of the route is limited. This problem can model the scenario where vehicles need to fuel at the depot (e.g. a helicopter). It also cater for legal labour issues, where a driver has a commitment to minimum availability. Let v ∈ {1, . . . , k} be a vehicle with a maximum route Rmax(v). Therefore, any given route Rv = (r1, . . . , rm) is constrained by the condition that\nW (Rv) ≤ Rmax(v),∀v ∈ {1, . . . , k}.\n.\nVRPTW is a variant of the VRP problem, where a visit to a vertice must be carried out within a time window. In this case, the solution is deemed to be feasible if a client is within a pre-defined lower and upper time limit. Examples of cases are scheduled deliveries such as SEDEX 10, which guarantees that the delivery is completed by the following day before 10 am. It is also useful to implement residential technical support, where the visit to a customer is scheduled within a time frame.\nA simple way to deal with unfeasible solutions is to assign an arbitrary high cost to the objective functions: whenever a solution is considered unfeasible, its cost is infinite (f(S)←∞.). For simplicity, in Section 3 we will describe the incapacitated VRP with time windows. The number of vehicles is a constant and we seek to minimize\nthe total length of the routes (W (S)). We also assume there are no empty or idle routes.\nDefinição 1 (Single-objective VRP) Given a weighted graph G(V,E), a constant k, a special vertice π ∈ V and an objective function f .

      "text" : "The instances were not generated from the actual post-office application data. Nevertheless, the first author has applied his domain expertise (having worked for four years in the field at a post office in Arthur Nogueira) to turn the instances as realistic as possible. The starting point was the map of the city of Arthur Nogueira as shown in Fig. 4.\nLine segments representing the streets were drawn on top of the map (Fig. 5). Each corner was automatically identified by means of an algorithm that calculate intersections. The result was a weighted graph where the weight of an edge represents the length of the segment.\nClearly, the edges representing deliveries that are carried out by a vehicle need to follow the direction of one-way streets. However, in our case, postmen deliveries were performed by foot.\nWe have created the graph directly from the street map due to the fact that: (i) the path by foot may differ from the ones available from maps which prioritize delivery by vehicles; (ii) the number of streets in Artur Nogueira is slightly over 400 and that allows the manual creation of the graph; (iii) Currently, public maps such as OpenStreetMap [21] are incomplete, i.e.\nthey have a large number of streets not yet covered;\nIdeally, the creation of new benchmarks for other cities should also consider public maps, mainly in large cities where the manual extraction of the map may incur in prohibitive costs.\nThe final graph ended up with |V | = 2111 and |E| = 3225. Each edge is associated with a pixel. Each edge has a bijection with a line segment Each street has a name and a set of collinear line segments. The cost of an edge is proportional to the length of its associated line segment, as discussed later.\nAn initial approach would be to consider the deliveries generated according to a uniform distribution across the city streets. However, a non-uniform distribution would be more realistic. For example, the main streets in the downtown area do tend to receive a larger number of deliveries per unit length than the side or back streets.\nTherefore, a relative density D parameter was applied to each street. For example, a street with D = .5 has a 50% less probability of receiving a delivery than one with D = 1.0 (per unit length)."

Penalty (Penal) 1.0 0.75 0.4 0.2\nIt means that, fixing other atttributes, an isolated street receives 80%\nless deliveries than a central street per unit of lenght.\nWe also define the attribute Type with four levels:\nType Avenue Street Alameda Highway\nMultiplic. Penalty (Penal) 1.0 0.75 0.4 0.0\nIn this work, all highways received directly the value 0, because there\nwere no delivers on it.\nAn street has 25% menos entregas por unidade de comprimento do que\numa avenida.\nAt last, we created the attribute Zone, which has three levels: with\npenalties\nZone Commercial&Industrial Mixed Residential\nMultiplic. Penalty (Penal) 1.0 0.7 0.4\nWe used the Google Maps as an auxiliary tool to verify the streets con-\ntaining companies.\nThe criterion Zone exists because a street deliveries density does not depend only on its type or region.

Be Streets = (Street1, Street2, . . . , Street422) the set of\nall streets. Be f : Streets → Rg × T × Z a function that attributes values to a particular street. For instance, consider the StreetRuaXV . We have f(StreetRuaXV ) was manualy define as (central, Avenue,Mixed), because it is an avenue, spoted at downtown, containing residences and commercial establishments.\nWe can refer to each f element apart, in the following manner: Rg(StreetXV ) = central, T (StreetXV ) = Avenue and Z(StreetXV ) = Mixed.\nFinally, we have a function that describes the relative density of a street. D : Streets→ N, as it follows:\nD(Street) = Penal(Rg(Street))× Penal(T (Street)) + Penal(Z(Street)).\nUsing this methodology, all the streets received a relative density. For example, the XV de Novembro Avenue relative density is given by\nD(StreetXV ) = Penal(Rg(StreetXV )) + Penal(T (StreetXV )) + Penal(Z(StreetXV ))\n= Penal(central)× Penal(Avenue)× Penal(Mixed) = 1× 1× 0.7 = 0.7\n(1)\nOn the other hand, the Sibipirunas Alameda has the relative density:\nD(StreetSib.) = Penal(Rg(StreetSib.)) + Penal(T (StreetSib.)) + Penal(Z(StreetSib.))\n= Penal(isolated) + Penal(Alameda) + Penal(Residential) = 0.2× 0.2× 0.4 = 0.16\n(2)\nD(StreetXV ) = 0.7 and D(StreetSib.) = 0.16 are used so that, in our model, the probability density of the RuaXV are be 0.7 0.14 times larger than probability density StreetSib.."

We intend to develop a free software system to validate and to rank the best solutions found by the researchers, also providing a view of the routes. Lower bounds have a more complex validation and will be released only when associated to a publishing.\nAt last, I would like to work in the development of an algorithm to solve\nsome of the instances presented in this work, in a future master degree."

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of real benchmarks to validate optimization algorithms. In this work we introduce VRPBench, a tool to create instances and visualize solutions to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) in a planar graph embedded in the Euclidean 2D space. We use VRPBench to model a real-world mail delivery case of the city of Artur Nogueira. Such scenarios were characterized as a multi-objective optimization of the VRP. We extracted a weighted graph from a digital map of the city to create a challenging benchmark for the VRP. Each instance models one generic day of mail delivery with hundreds to thousands of delivery points, thus allowing both the comparison and validation of optimization algorithms for routing problems.",
