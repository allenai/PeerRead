      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "SOCIAL media are becoming an increasingly importantsource for data mining applications, among others for exploratory research utilised as a means to analyse political and societal issues, or for information and news gathering. However, one of the problems with social media is the limited availability of users’ socio-demographic details that would enable developing data mining tools that take into account the many different realities in society. Attempting to mitigate this issue, a growing body of research in natural language processing and data mining deals with the automated inference of socio-demographic characteristics such as age and gender, country of origin [1] or political orientation [2].\nFollowing this line of research, we describe and assess a data collection and classification methodology that enables identifying two groups of social media users in territories with active independence movements: those who support the independence (pro-independence), and those who oppose it (anti-independence). Independence movements are motivated by conflicting national identities, where different parts of a population identify themselves as citizens of one nation or another, such as the Scots feeling Scottish or British, and hence wanting an independent Scotland or remaining in the United Kingdom. Independence movements occur in many territories worldwide, as is the case in Palestine, Kurdistan, Sicily, Scotland, Catalonia or the Basque Country. These situations lead to people with conflicting national identities living together in the same territory, where national identity can be defined as “a body of people who feel that they are a nation” [3].Classification of users by national identity can be useful to analyse a range of political and societal issues.\n• A. Zubiaga, B. Wang, M. Liakata and R. Procter are with the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill Road, Coventry CV4 7AL, United Kingdom. E-mail: see http://www.zubiaga.org/\nOur study makes the following novel contributions: (1) we describe the task of classifying the stance of social media users as supporting or opposing an independence movement, (2) we describe a methodology that relies on Twitter users’ self-reported location for collecting users with conflicting national identities, (3) we look at the national identity rather than the largely studied partisanship or voting intention of users, and (4) we study languageindependent classification approaches using four different types of features, not only looking at tweet content but also at interactions, the network, and a user’s favourited tweets. Our semi-automated data collection and annotation methodology enables us to collect datasets for three different territories –Catalonia, the Basque Country and Scotland– with over 36,000 users annotated for supporting or opposing stance towards the independence of their nation. Our experiments show that the users’ network can lead to highly accurate classification, outperforming the use of tweet content. Moreover, a behavioural analysis of the user groups shows the existence of echo chambers where users of a national identity barely see content of the opposing identity within the same region."

      "heading" : "2 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Computational approaches to the study of proindependence movements are scarce. The most relevant work to that which we report here is that by Fang et al. [4] attempting to classify users’ voting intention in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. However, their work focused on determining voting intention during a particular referendum rather than determining the users’ national identity and, being limited to a single territory – Scotland –, they introduced a language-dependent approach that identifies topics discussed during the referendum campaign for determining users’ stance. While classification of users by political orientation is also related to our work, such as\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n08 38\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n0 Ju\nn 20\n17\n2 republicans or democrats in the US [2], or conservatives or labourists in the UK [5], national identities reflect independent dimensions that are not necessarily linked to partisanship. Citizens with common national identities can also vote for parties with different political ideologies, and their national identities can be instead motivated by similar cultural and linguistic backgrounds [6]."

      "heading" : "3 DATA COLLECTION",
      "text" : "Our data collection methodology relies on users’ selfreported location as a proxy for identifying the territory that users claim to be citizens of, which is directly indicative of their stance towards the ongoing independence movement in their territory. For each territory, we identify distinctive location names with which either pro-independence or antiindependence people associate themselves, which gives us ground truth labels to determine their stance. We rely on the following approaches for the three territories under study: Catalonia. Officially part of Spain, Catalonia has an ongoing independence movement, and its citizens feel either Catalan (pro-independence) or Spanish (anti-independence). For the generation of the dataset distinguishing these two national identities, we rely on the fact that Catalans whose profile location contains Paı̈sos Catalans or its acronym PPCC (i.e. Catalan Countries) are overtly claiming to be citizens of an independent Catalonia. The term Paı̈sos Catalans unambiguously refers to an independent Catalonia, which would instead be Catalunya or Cataluña if not explicitly referring to an independent country. Alternatively, we identify users whose location contains the name of a Catalan city (e.g. Barcelona or Girona) or Catalunya/Cataluña along with Espanya or España as claiming to be Spanish citizens. Using a dataset of 12 months’ worth of tweets collected from the Twitter streaming API between March 2015 and February 2016, we sampled users that satisfied the above characteristics. Basque Country. Officially also part of Spain, and to a lesser extent of France, the Basque Country has a longstanding independence movement. Citizens of the Basque Country can feel either Basque (pro-independence) or Spanish (antiindependence). To generate the dataset, we look for users whose profile location contains Euskal Herria or its acronym EH (i.e. Greater Basque Country). The term Euskal Herria unambiguously refers to an independent Basque Country, unlike Euskadi which refers to a region of Spain. On the other hand, we look for users whose location field contains the name of a Basque city (e.g. Bilbao or Donostia/San Sebastián) or Euskadi along with Espainia or España, which identifies users located in the Basque Country who claim to be citizens of Spain. We use the same 12 month dataset to look for users that satisfy these characteristics. Scotland. Officially part of the UK, Scotland also has an ongoing independence movement. The dataset generation process for Scotland needs to be slightly different from the two above, as the Scots do not use a different name to refer to an independent Scotland. To overcome this, we first use a Twitter dataset pertaining to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, collected between 1st August and 30th September, 2014 using a list of keywords including ‘#IndyRef ’, ‘vote’ and ‘referendum’. In this dataset, we look for supporters who tweeted one of #YesBecause, #YesScotland,\n#YesScot, #VoteYes and opposers who tweeted one of #NoBecause, #BetterTogether, #VoteNo, #NoThanks, as suggested by [4]. To make sure that we identify the users’ stance towards Scotland’s independence, avoiding noise from tweets that are not necessarily endorsements of the hashtag being used, we collected the profile metadata of all sampled users. To generate the final dataset, we used again the same 12 month dataset, from which we retained the profiles of all IndyRef supporters whose profile location contained Scotland but not UK, United Kingdom, GB or Great Britain, as well as all opposers whose profile location contained the name of a Scottish city (e.g. Glasgow or Edinburgh) or Scotland, along with UK, United Kingdom, GB or Great Britain.\nThe location strings for the resulting user profiles were manually verified to make sure that they all satisfied our requirements. The methodology was largely accurate, with 96.0%, 95.9% and 98.9% correct instances for Catalonia, the Basque Country and Scotland, respectively. Those users that did not meet our expected locations were manually removed from the datasets. The resulting datasets consist of 36,609 users (see Table 1)."

The final collection for the three territories comprises 27.4 million tweets including timelines and favourites, as well as 19.1 million different users occurring in follow networks."

      "text" : "We formulate the problem of determining the stance of users towards the independence movement in their territory as a binary, supervised classification task. Stance classification of social media users differs from the increasingly popular stance classification of texts [7] in that the stance is explicitly expressed in each text for the latter, while for users one needs to put together behavioural patterns extracted from historical features of their account. The input to the classifier is a set of users from a specific territory. To build the classification model, a training set of users labelled for one of Y = {PI,AI} is used (PI = pro-independence, AI =\n1. Tweets favourited by a user are not available through Twitter’s API, and were instead collected by scraping the web interface.\n3 anti-independence). For a test set including a set of new, unseen users, the classifier will have to determine if each of the users is a supporter or opposers of independence, namely picking one of Ŷ = {PI,AI}."

      "heading" : "4.2 Classification Settings",
      "text" : "We perform the classification experiments in a stratified, 10-fold cross-validation setting separately for each territory. We micro-average the scores to aggregate the performance across different folds and report the final accuracy scores. We use four different classifiers for the experimentation: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests and Maximum Entropy. We use four different types of features for the classification, all of which are independent of the location string we used for determining the ground truth:\n1) Timeline: We use Word2Vec embeddings [8] to represent the content of a user’s timeline of most recent tweets. The model we use for the embeddings was trained for each territory using the entire collection of tweets. We represent each tweet as the average of the embeddings for each word, and finally get the average of all tweets. 2) Interactions: We consider that a user is interacting with another when they are retweeting or replying to them. We create a weighted list of all the users that are the target of the interactions in each of our datasets. Given the length of this list, we reduce its size by restricting to the 99th percentile of most common interactions. Each of the remaining users belong to a feature in the resulting vectors. For each user, we represent each of the features in the vectors as the count of interactions the user has had with the user represented by that feature. 3) Favourites: To represent the content of the tweets favourited by a user, we use the same approach based on word embeddings as for the timeline above, in this case using the content of the tweets favourited by a user instead. 4) Network: Similar to the approach used for interactions, we aggregate the list of users that appear in the networks (followees or followers) in each of our datasets. We restrict this list to the 99th percentile formed by the most frequent users in each dataset. For each user, we then create a vector with binary values representing whether each of the users is in the network of the current user."

We observe F1 scores that are remarkably high for both national identities in Catalonia, as well as Basques in the Basque Country and Scots in Scotland. Performance drops slightly for the Spanish in the Basque Country and the British in Scotland, most likely due to the imbalance of classes in the datasets.\nTo further understand the results, we look into the features and their distribution across national identities. Table 4 shows the top keywords for each of the territories and national identities, extracted from the users’ timelines and favourited tweets. The top keywords are extracted by using the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) as a metric to compute the most indicative keywords of each national identity in comparison with its opposed national identity. The list of top keywords suggests that only few of them are actually related to either their national identity or to the pro-\n4 Timeline\nCatalonia Basque Country Scotland\nCatalan Spanish Basque Spanish Scottish British\nindependència youtube zaunk empleo video libra (independence) (youtube) (bark) (employment)\ntvecinofavorito gustado 24h navarra tracked advertiser (Twitter account) (liked) (24 hours) (province name)\ndiària vı́deo tweet bilbao youtube stornoway (daily) (video) (tweet) (city name)\nfulleda empleo tuitutil trabajo scotland capricorn (city name) (employment) (useful tweet) (work)\nfeina gracias retweeteado vizcaya scorpio island (work) (thanks) (retweeted) (province name)\nFavourites\nCatalonia Basque Country Scotland\nCatalan Spanish Basque Spanish Scottish British\nvinos vı́a almutw alberguescamino caitlinday10 girlinscotland (wines) (via/way) (Twitter account) (Twitter account)\nbanderacatalana dimensionvegana almumontero curso xstephx3x kxckit (Catalan flag) (Twitter account) (Twitter account) (course)\nxusram barcelona junkaletxegarai profeahorrador indyref darthmattius (Twitter account) (city) (Twitter account) (Twitter account)\nsvqtovarich carolinamaiko maiderperales88 descuento phdannmarie sermattius (Twitter account) (Twitter account) (Twitter account) (discount)\niusevillaciudad elsaqueocatalan geroarural athletic documentingyes lunchquest (Twitter account) (Twitter account) (Twitter account) (football team)\nTABLE 4: Top distinctive keywords in timeline and favourited tweets for different territories and national identities.\nor anti-independence groups. There is a significant overlap in that both the pro-independence and anti-independence mention city names as well as vocabulary specific to social media such as user accounts or content liking or sharing. While some Twitter accounts are quite indicative, such as “elsaqueocatalan” in the case of the Spanish in Catalonia which is an anti-independence account, this does not suffice to achieve high performance. Both the overlap and lack of distinctive vocabulary across national identities lead to the difficulty of performing an accurate classification using either timelines and favourited tweets. The use of more sophisticated feature selection methods might help improve performance.\nIn Figure 1 we look at the interactions and network features by visualising connections within and across national identities. The layout of all graphs is computed with Gephi’s Force Atlas algorithm [9] to make sure they are comparable. This analysis reveals a big difference in how interactions and follow networks are shaped. A look at the interactions shows that users of different national identities regularly interact with each other, with no clear separation between communities. However, when we look at the network visualisations, we see a totally different picture where users are mainly connected to users of the same national identity, with a clear separation between national identities, especially for Catalonia and the Basque Country. Indeed this suggests that pro-independence users are connected with one another, while the anti-independence are connected within their own group too, with significantly fewer connections across com-\nmunities. This emphasises the findings of our classification experiments, showing that network features are the best to classify users as pro-independence or anti-independence, however interactions are not as useful as interactions across communities are frequent."

      "heading" : "6 BEHAVIOURAL ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY GROUPS",
      "text" : "To understand behavioural patterns that characterise the different national identity groups, we perform pairwise comparisons using Welch’s t-test [10]. Having two different user groups in each case (pro-independence and antiindependence), Welch’s t-test enables us to determine which of the groups is more prominent for a certain feature as well as the statistical significance of that prominence. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 5, with a set of 16 features grouped into 2 types.\nRegarding the tweeting activity of users, we observe that there is no consistent pattern as to who tweets more, has older accounts or gets more retweeted (#1 to #6), with proindependence users being more active in Catalonia, antiindependence users being more active in Scotland and both users being more active in terms of different aspects in the Basque Country. What is interesting is to look at the URLs that these users post in their tweets (#7 and #8). We see that pro-independence users tend to post more URLs whose domain belongs to their nation (i.e., .cat for Catalonia, .eus for the Basque Country or .scot for Scotland), whereas antiindependence users tend to post more URLs whose domain\n5 (a) Interactions (Catalonia) (b) Interactions (Basque Country) (c) Interactions (Scotland)\n(d) Network (Catalonia) (e) Network (Basque Country) (f) Network (Scotland)\nFig. 1: Interactions and network connections within and across national identities in the three territories with independence movements. Blue: pro-independence; Red: anti-independence.\nbelongs to the officially recognised country (.es for Spain and .uk for the UK). This finding is statistically significant for Catalonia and the Basque Country, but not for Scotland.\nLooking at the user profiles, we see that proindependence users tend to have more followers while anti-independence users tend to follow more people in the Basque Country and Scotland, however it is the proindependence users who have both more followers and follow more people in the case of Catalonia (#9 and #10). There is no significant difference when we look at whether users from both groups are verified accounts or not (#11). The users who have the geolocation feature enabled in their accounts tend to be pro-independence in Catalonia and the Basque Country, and anti-independence in Scotland (#12). Initially we hypothesised that pro-independence users would be less likely to activate the geolocation feature, given that in that case Twitter would tag their geolocated tweets as coming from Spain or the UK, which they might dislike. However, this only holds true for Scotland and hence the users might not be concerned and/or aware of this. We also look at the URL specified in the user profiles as being one that belongs to the independent TLD (#13, .cat/.eus/.scot) or the officially recognised country’s TLD (#14, .es/.uk). We\nobserve significant differences here, for all three territories, showing that pro-independence users tend to use more the independent TLD, with the anti-independence users using more the official country’s TLD. Finally, we look at the extent to which the users configure their accounts in the language of the independent nation (#15) or the official country’s language (#16). There is a significant difference in both Catalonia and the Basque Country, with pro-independence users being more likely to set up their accounts in Catalan and Basque, respectively. This feature is not as indicative for Scotland as Twitter does not allow the option to use the service in Scottish language. Instead, our analysis looked at the use of “en-gb” as the country’s official and “en” as the opposite. An analysis with the Scottish language available in the platform may lead to different results.\nThe findings from this analysis suggest the existence of separate echo chambers, especially in the case of Catalonia and the Basque Country, where users set up their accounts differently, use different languages and follow different groups of people. The echo chambers are not as remarkable in Scotland, users being more likely to follow each other and with lesser significant differences in the use of different TLDs.\n6 Feature # Feature Catalonia Basque C.

      "heading" : "7 DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "The methodology described here enabled us to gather large datasets to tackle the unexplored task of determining the stance of Twitter users towards independence movements, as well as a classifier that can determine this stance automatically. Our methodology and classifier have been been tested in three territories with ongoing independence movements and conflicting national identities: Scotland, Catalonia and the Basque Country. Our classification experiments show encouraging results with high performance scores that range from 85% to 97% in accuracy with the use of a Maximum Entropy classifier that exploits each user’s social network. Further to this experimentation and in a realistic scenario, the classifier trained from users whose self-reported location field reveals their national identity can then be applied to other users in that particular territory. Classification of users by national identity can then be exploited for further analysis of societal and political issues, as well as to target the segment of users according to one’s interest. A classifier built on network features and therefore independent of the content of the tweets enables also a textual analysis of the different communities. Moreover, an analysis of different behavioural features of users shows the existence of echo chambers distinguishing the different national identities, especially prominent in the case of Catalonia and the Basque Country, where users’ content, network and profile settings differ. The existence of these echo chambers suggests that users barely see people from the opposing national identity, which may lead to their original ideas being reinforced, rarely hearing from the opposing group.\nThe analysis of tweet content (e.g. to explore the potential existence of arguments between opposing user groups) was not feasible at this point given the multilingual nature of our dataset (i.e., English, Spanish, Basque, Catalan, Scottish), owing to the limited ability to perform accurate linguistic analysis of tweets for low resourced languages. Our plans for future work also include further generalising our data collection and annotation approach to other terri-\ntories with similar independence movements, such as Palestine or Kurdistan, or countries with varying perceptions of nationalism, such as people who identify themselves as English or as British in England. While limited to binary classification in our experiments, we also plan to explore other scenarios that require considering a higher number of national identities (e.g. the UK’s four nations)."

Here we undertake the classification of social media users as supporting or opposing ongoing independence movements in their territories. Independence movements occur in territories whose citizens have conflicting national identities; users with opposing national identities will then support or oppose the sense of being part of an independent nation that differs from the officially recognised country. We describe a methodology that relies on users’ self-reported location to build datasets for three territories – Catalonia, the Basque Country and Scotland – and we test language-independent classifiers using four types of features. We show the effectiveness of the approach to build large annotated datasets, and the ability to achieve accurate, language-independent classification performances ranging from 85% to 97% for the three territories under study. A data analysis shows the existence of echo chambers that isolate opposing national identities from each other.",
