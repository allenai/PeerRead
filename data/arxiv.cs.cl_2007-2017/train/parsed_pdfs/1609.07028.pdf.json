      "text" : "Knowledge graphs (KGs), which provide huge amount of structured information for entities and relations, have been successfully utilized in various fields such as knowledge inference [Yang et al., 2014] and question answering [Yin et al., 2016]. A typical KG like Freebase or DBpedia usually models the multi-relational information with enormous triple facts represented as {head entity,relation, tail entity}, which is also abridged as {h, r, t}.\nTo model knowledge graphs, translation-based methods are proposed, which project both entities and relations into a continuous low-dimensional semantic space, with relations considered to be translating operations between head and tail entities [Bordes et al., 2013]. These methods could leverage both effectiveness and efficiency in knowledge representation learning (KRL), and thus have attracted great attention in recent years. However, most conventional methods on KRL\n∗Corresponding author: Z. Liu (liuzy@tsinghua.edu.cn)\nonly concentrate on the structured information in triple facts, regardless of rich external information located in images.\nFig. 1 demonstrates some examples of entity images. Each entity has multiple images which can provide significant visual information that intuitively describes the appearances and behaviours of this entity. To utilize the rich information in images, we propose the Image-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning (IKRL) model. More specifically, we first propose an image encoder which consists of a neural representation module and a projection module to generate the image-based representation for each image instance. Second, we construct the aggregated image-based entity representation jointly considering all image instances with an attentionbased method. Finally, we jointly learn the knowledge representations with translation-based methods.\nWe evaluate the IKRL model on knowledge graph completion and triple classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performances on both tasks, which confirms the capability of IKRL in encoding image information into knowledge representations."

      "text" : "Translation-based methods have achieved great success on knowledge representation learning in recent years. TransE [Bordes et al., 2013] models both entities and relations into the same low-dimensional continuous vector space, with relations considered to be translating operations between head and tail entities. The basic assumption of TransE is that the embedding of tail entity t should be the neighbour of h + r. The energy function of TransE is defined as follows:\nE(h, r, t) = ||h+ r− t||. (1)\nTransE is both effective and efficient, while the simple assumption may result in conflicts when modeling complicated entities and relations. To address this problem, TransH [Wang et al., 2014b] proposes relation-specific hyperplanes for translations between entities. TransR [Lin et al., 2015] models entities and relations in different vector spaces, projecting entities from entity space to relation spaces with relation-specific matrices. TransD [Ji et al., 2015] further\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n07 02\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n2 Se\np 20\n16\nconsiders both diversities of entities and relations, using dynamic mapping matrix for the multiple representations of entities. However, these methods only concentrate on the structured information in KGs. We propose the IKRL model to consider images based on TransE, and our model can also be easily extended to other translation-based methods."

To utilize rich textual information, [Wang et al., 2014a] projects both entities and words into a joint vector space with alignment models. [Xie et al., 2016] directly constructs entity representations from entity descriptions, which is capable of modeling new entities. As for visual information, multimodal representations based on words and images are widely used on various tasks like image-sentence ranking [Kiros et al., 2014] and metaphor identification [Shutova et al., 2016]. However, image information has not yet been used in knowledge representations. To the best of our knowledge, IKRL is the first method which explicitly encodes visual information from images into knowledge representations."

T stands for the whole training set of triples, E represents the set of entities, and R represents the set of relations. Each entity and relation embedding takes value in Rds .\nTo utilize entity image information, we propose two kinds of representations for each entity inspired by [Xie et al., 2016]. We set hS , tS as the structure-based representations of head and tail entities, which are the distributed representations learned by conventional knowledge models. We also propose a novel kind of knowledge representations hI , tI as the image-based representations, which are constructed from the corresponding images of both entities."

Following the framework of translation-based methods, we define the overall energy function as follows:\nE(h, r, t) = ESS + ESI + EIS + EII . (2)\nThe overall energy function is determined by the two kinds of entity representations jointly. ESS = ||hS + r − tS || is\nthe same energy function as TransE which only depends on the structure-based representations. EII = ||hI + r − tI || is the energy function in which both head and tail entities are image-based representations learned from their corresponding images. We also have ESI = ||hS + r − tI || and EIS = ||hI + r − tS || to assure that both structure-based representations and image-based representations are learned into the same vector space.\nAccording to the energy function, the overall architecture of the IKRL model is demonstrated in Fig. 2. Each entity has multiple entity images providing significant visual information. First, we design a neural image encoder taking every entity image as inputs. The image encoder aims to extract informative features from images and construct the image representations in entity space. Second, for the combination of multiple image representations, we implement an instancelevel attention-based learning method to automatically calculate the attention we should pay on different image instances for each entity. Finally, the aggregated image-based representations are learned jointly combined with the structure-based representations under the overall energy function."

The image representation module utilizes neural networks to extract discriminative features in images, and constructs image feature representations for each image. Next, the image projection module attempts to project those image feature representations from image space to entity space. Fig. 3 demonstrates the overall pipeline of the image encoder."

      "text" : "Image encoder takes images as inputs and then constructs image-based representations for each single image. However, most entities have more than one image from different aspects in various scenarios. It is essential but also challenging to determine which images are better to represent their corresponding entities. Simply summing up all image representations may suffer from either noises or information loss. Instead, to construct the aggregated image-based representation for each entity from multiple instances, we propose an attention-based multi-instance learning method.\nAttention-based methods are confirmed to be intelligent to automatically select informative instances form multiple candidates. It has been widely utilized in various fields such as\nimage classification [Mnih et al., 2014], machine translation [Bahdanau et al., 2015] and abstractive sentence summarization [Rush et al., 2015]. We jointly consider each image representation and its corresponding entity structure-based representation to generate the attention. For the i-th image representation p(k)i of the k-th entity, the attention is defined as follows:\natt(p (k) i , e (k) S ) =\nexp (p (k) i · e (k) S )∑n\nj=1 exp (p (k) j · e (k) S )\n, (4)\nwhere e(k)S represents the structure-based representation of the k-th entity. High attention indicates that its corresponding image representation is similar to the structure-based representation, and thus should be more considered when constructing the aggregated image-based representation. Hence we define the aggregated image-based representation for the k-th entity as follows:\ne (k) I = n∑ i=1 att(p (k) i , e (k) S ) · p (k) i∑n j=1 att(p (k) j , e (k) S ) , (5)\nBesides the attention-based method, we also implement two alternative combination methods for further comparisons. AVG is a simple combination method that takes the mean of all image embeddings, making every image have equal contributions to the final image-based representation. MAX is a simplified version based on attention, which only considers the image representations with the largest attention."

As for the image representation module, we utilize a deep learning framework Caffe [Jia et al., 2014] to implement AlexNet, which is pre-trained on ILSVRC 2012 with a minor variation from the version described in [Krizhevsky et al., 2012].

This task has been widely used to evaluate the quality of knowledge representations [Bordes et al., 2012; Bordes et al., 2013]. The prediction is determined via the dissimilarity function ||h+ r− t||. Since the IKRL model has two kinds of representations, we will report three prediction results based on our models: IKRL (SBR) only utilizes structure-based representations for all entities when predicting the missing ones, while IKRL (IBR) only utilizes image-based representations to predict. IKRL (UNION) is a simple joint method considering the weighted concatenation of both entity representations.\nFollowing the same settings in [Bordes et al., 2013], we consider two measures as our evaluation metrics in entity prediction: (1) mean rank of correct entities (Mean Rank); (2) proportion of correct entity results ranked in top 10 (Hits@10). We also follow the two evaluation settings named “Raw” and “Filter” used in [Bordes et al., 2013].

It indicates that the visual information of images has been successfully encoded into entity representations, which is of great significance when constructing knowledge representations. (2) Both IKRL (SBR) and IKRL (IBR) have better performances compared to the baselines, which indicates that visual information could not only instruct the construction of image-based representations, but\nalso improve the performances of structure-based representations. (3) The IKRL models significantly and consistently outperform baselines on Mean Rank. It is because that Mean Rank depends on the overall quality of knowledge representations, and thus is sensitive with the wrong-predicted results. Previous translation-based methods like TransE only consider the structured information in triples, which may fail to predict the relationships if the corresponding information is missing. However, the image information utilized in IKRL can provide supplementary information. Therefore, the results of IKRL are much better than baselines on Mean Rank."

The evaluation results on entity prediction with both image-based representations and structure-based representations are shown in Table 3.\nFrom Table 3 we observe that: (1) all IKRL models still outperform baselines on Mean Rank and Hits@10 no matter what the combination strategy is. It confirms the improvements introduced by images, for the visual information has been successfully encoded into knowledge representations. (2) The IKRL (ATT) model achieves the best performance among all three combination strategies, which implies that the attention-based method is capable of automatically selecting more informative image instances to represent entities. (3) The IKRL (AVG) model performs better than the IKRL (MAX) model, which indicates that only considering images with the largest attention will lose important information located in other instances. (4) It seems that the IKRL (ATT) model has slight advantages over the IKRL (AVG) model. The reason is that the qualities of images we extract from ImageNet are very high, which may narrow the gap between attention-based and average-based methods. For further analysis, we will give some examples with attention in case study, which could successfully distinguish the relatively better and worse images from all candidates."

Since WN9-IMG has no explicit negative instances, we generate the negative instances by randomly replacing head or tail entities with another entity following the same protocol utilized in [Socher et al., 2013]. We also assure that the number of positive triples is equal to that of negative triples.\nIn classification, we set different relation-specific thresholds δr for each relation, which are optimized by maximizing the classification accuracies on the validation set with their corresponding relations. For a triple to be classified, if its dissimilarity function ||h + r − t|| is over δr, it will be predicted to be negative, and otherwise to be positive.

Most conventional methods learn knowledge representations solely from structured triples, ignoring rich visual information extracted from entity images. In this paper, we propose a novel Image-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning model, where knowledge representations are learned with both triples and images. More specifically, for each image of an entity, we construct image-based representations via a neural image encoder, and these representations with respect to multiple image instances are then integrated via an attention-based method. We evaluate our models on knowledge graph completion and triple classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our models outperform all baselines on both tasks, which indicates the significance of visual information for knowledge representations and the capability of our models in learning knowledge representations with images.",
