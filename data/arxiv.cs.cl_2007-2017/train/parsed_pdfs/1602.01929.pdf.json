      "text" : "Prior work [4] shows that using frame-level features (BNFs) extracted from ASR Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a bottleneck layer instead of shifted-delta cepstrum (SDC) [5] features is very effective in NIST LRE. NTU systems adopt this strategy. However, the difference with [4] is that we extracted the BNFs from a stacked multilingual bottleneck neural network. Figure 1 shows the framework of the stacked multilingual bottleneck neural network (MBNN) training [6, 7, 8, 9]. The class labels are changed to context-dependent (CD) states. During training, the two bottleneck (BN) neural networks (NNs) are multilingually trained successively. Once the first BN NN is finished training, it is fixed as a feature transform to train the second BN NN. After we finish the multilingual bottleneck network training, the two BN NNs are stacked to generate the BNFs for the unseen languages to train acoustic models, realizing MBNN based cross-lingual transfer. Original feature for training is 25-dim: 22 Mel filter-bank log energies plus 3 kaldi pitch features. Hamming window and DCT transformation are applied on 11 contextual features. The first BN NN is configured as 275-1500-1500-80(BN)-1500-7887 and the second 400-1500-1500-30(BN)-1500-7887. All BN layers employ linear-neurons while the other hidden-layers are sigmoid neurons. Networks are trained on GPU using gradient descent cross-entropy criterion without pre-training. Note that we used monophone state labels as SBN output. To obtain better alignment triphone system was used to conduct forced alignment instead, and then phone conversion is performed.\nMultilingual dataset released for OpenKWS2 by IARPA Babel program was used for pre-training stacked multilingual bottleneck neural network. The dataset was composed by 141.3 hours Cantonese, 78.4 hours Pashto, 77.2 hours Turkish, 84.5 hours Tagalog, 70 hours Tamil, and 87 hours Vietnamese. Then, 318-hours switchboard landline data was applied to tuning the second multilingual bottleneck neural network. Only the training data provided by NIST 2015 LRE was used for estimating UBM, i-vector extractor, and language models. Systems based on these features were only used in extended data condition submission."

As the amount of data is extremely imbalance among classes, with some languages limited to less than an hour of speech, we trained a global covariance matrix where language-specific covariance could be derived with a smoothing factor of 0.1. Given a test i-vector, a score vector is obtained by concatenating the log-likelihood scores from these Gaussian distribution. Discriminative training is further applied on the score vector.

The first and second derivatives of all coefficients was also concatenated to the original coeffecients, giving a 39-dimensional vector. The coefficients were normalized to have mean 0 and standard devi-\nation 1 over each utterances. Additionally, LSTM need input is a sequence, we roll MFCC into a sequence of 20 frames. This process is performed for each speech file, and the remain frames are truncated. We used bidirectional recurrent neural network [13], in combination with LSTM [14], to bridge long time lags with access to the past and future context of the signal. We chose bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) because our experiments with unidirectional LSTM gave worse results on the task. The network structure is specified in following table:\nType # Hidden Units Note Input layer (batch size, 20, 39) BLSTM 250 BLSTM 250 BLSTM 250 output is delayed by 15 Projection 512 Activation: rectifier Output 20 Softmax for 20 languages\nAll the network’s parameters were initialized using Glorot’s uniform mentioned in [15]. BLSTM layers used sigmoid as inner activation and tanh for output activation. For training the network we used categorical crossentropy objectives (i.e. onevs-all criterion) and RSMprop optimizer [16], which utilizes the magnitude of recent gradients to normalize the gradients for each backward training step. In order to prevent overfitting training set, we used 4 different techniques:\n• Early stopping based on generalization loss of tuning set [17].\n• L2 regularization (weights decay = 1e-4) on 2 Fully connected layers\n• Dropout with probability of ignoring an activation is uniform(0.3) [18]\n• Adding random Gaussian noise to perturb the weights.\nOur experiments showed that training deep model (i.e. BLSTM) on biased dataset will cause the whole network converges to the classes with higher proportion of samples. Hence, the training process was carefully executed with a fixed scenarios:\n1. Training 2 epochs with RSMprop, learning rate = 0.001, without noise and dropout, only L2 regularization and early stop enable.\n2. The next 2 epochs with almost the same configuration except dropout probability = 0.3 and learning rate = 0.0001.\n3. Learning rate reduced to 0.00001, with same configuration, 10 more epochs (early stop will stop the algorithm in advance before any strong overfit, and only the best weights (i.e. gave the best result on validation set) was saved.\n4. After that, we used 0.075 Gaussian noise to perturb the network for 10 more epochs without any dropout.\n5. Then, we performed cyclic training to reduce the effect unbalanced training set. The dataset was organized into 2 set, first set with full of training data, the second one was undersampling from training set with balanced distribution of all languages. The training configuration was as follow: every 2 epoch of training with full set, do 2 other epoch with undersampled set (learning rate = 0.00001, with dropout and noise used in turn). This procedure was repeated until no more improvement achieved and cancelled by early stop.\nTaken into account the biased distribution of training set, the network under training process was strongly influenced by the languages with large amount of data. We used prior knowledge from training distribution to calibrate the softmax score before calculated likelihood ratio. We only did calibration on the 3 clusters with the worst performance, addressed the fact that the network was already biased to provide the best result for 3 other clusters."

      "heading" : "4.7. Pair-wise DNN",
      "text" : "Instead of using Gaussian back-ends, DNN post-processing is adopted to get a new representation from the i-vectors. The diagram of the DNN post-processing is shown in Figure 2. Each training sample consists of two input i-vectors and one label. The label is 1 if these two i-vectors are from the same language and 0 otherwise. Two i-vectors will be processed by the i-vector post-processing subnet which consists of one or more hidden layers and one linear transform. During training the gradient of the left and right subnets are computed individually, but their parameters tied and updated together to make sure that the two subnets have the same parameter at all time. The output of the subnets are new representation vector of the respective sentences and will be used for language recognition. The subnets are trained such that simple cosine distance is able to tell whether the two input i-vectors are from the same language. The network is trained layer-by-layer. For example, the first hidden layer is firstly trained until convergence. Then, we add the second hidden layer or the linear transform layer and train the whole network until convergence. The training usually converges after 10-20 epochs.\nTo create the training samples for the DNN, both positive i-vectors pairs where the two i-vectors are from the same languages and negative pairs are randomly generated. In the most basic setting, for each i-vector, we create one positive pair and one negative pair. To create more balanced training samples, we generate more positive/negative pairs for languages with little ivectors and this is found to be helpful on the tune set. We run the pair generation algorithm 20 times to create about 3 million training pairs."
