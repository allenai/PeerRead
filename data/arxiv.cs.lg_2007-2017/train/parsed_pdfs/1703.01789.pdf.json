      "text" : "In music information retrieval (MIR) tasks, raw waveforms of music signals are generally converted to a time-frequency representation and used as input to the system. The majority of MIR systems use a log-scaled representation in frequency such as mel-spectrograms and constant-Q transforms and then compress the amplitude with a log scale. The time-frequency representations are often transformed further into more compact forms of audio features depending on the task. All of these processes are designed based on acoustic knowledge or engineering efforts.\nRecent advances in deep learning, especially the development of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), made it possible to learn the entire hierarchical representations from the raw input data, thereby minimizing the input data processing by hands. This end-to-end hierarchical learning was attempted early in the image domain, particularly since the DCNN achieves break-through results in image classification [1]. These days, the method of stacking small filters (e.g. 3x3) is widely used after it has\nCopyright: c© 2017 Jongpil Lee et al.

In the text domain, the language model typically consists of two steps: word embedding and word-level learning. While word embedding plays a very important role in language processing [3], it has limitations in that it is learned independently from the system. Recent work using CNNs that take character-level text as input showed that the end-toend learning approach can yield comparable results to the word-level learning system [4, 5]. In the audio domain, learning from raw audio has been explored mainly in the automatic speech recognition task [6–10]. They reported that the performance can be similar to or even superior to that of the models using spectral-based features as input.\nThis end-to-end learning approach has been applied to music classification tasks as well [11, 12]. In particular, Dieleman and Schrauwen used raw waveforms as input of CNN models for music auto-tagging task and attempted to achieve comparable results to those using mel-spectrograms as input [11]. Unfortunately, they failed to do so and attributed the result to three reasons. First, their CNN models were not sufficiently expressive (e.g. a small number of layers and filters) to learn the complex structure of polyphonic music. Second, they could not find an appropriate non-linearity function that can replace the log-based amplitude compression in mel-spectrograms. Third, the bottom layer in the networks takes raw waveforms in frame-level which are typically several hundred samples long. The filters in the bottom layer should learn all possible phase variations of periodic waveforms which are likely to be prevalent in musical signals. The phase variations within a frame (i.e. time shift of periodic waveforms) are actually removed in mel-spectrograms.\nIn this paper, we address these issues with sample-level DCNN. What we mean by “sample-level” is that the filter size in the bottom layer may go down to several samples long. We assume that this small granularity is analogous to pixel-level in image or character-level in text. We show the effectiveness of the sample-level DCNN in music auto-tagging task by decreasing strides of the first convolutional layer from frame-level to sample-level and accordingly increasing the depth of layers. Our experiments show that the depth of architecture with samplelevel filters is proportional to the accuracy and also the architecture achieves results comparable to previous stateof-the-art performances for the Magnatagatune dataset and the Million song dataset. In addition, we visualize filters learned in the sample-level DCNN.\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n01 78\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.S D\n] 6\nM ar\n2 01\n7"

      "text" : "Since the waveform is one-dimensional data, previous work use a CNN that consists of one-dimensional convolution and pooling stages. While the convolution operation and filter length in upper layers are usually similar to those used in the image domain, the bottom layer that takes waveform directly conducted a special operation called strided convolution, which takes a large filter length and strides it as much as the filter length (or the half). This frame-level approach is comparable to sliding windows with 100% or 50% hop size in short-time Fourier transform. In many of previous work, the stride and filter length of the first convolution layer was set to 10-20 ms (160-320 samples at 16 kHz audio) [8, 10–12].\nIn this paper, we reduce the filter length and stride of the first convolution layer to sample-level, which can be as small as 2 samples. Accordingly, we increase the depth of layers in the CNN model. There are some works that use 0.6 ms (10 samples at 16 kHz audio) as a stride length [6, 7], but they used a CNN model only with three convolution layers, which is not sufficient to learn the complex structure of musical signals."

Since the time-frequency representation is two dimensional data, previous work regarded it as either twodimensional images or one-dimensional sequence of vectors [11,13–15]. We only used one-dimensional(1D) CNN model for experimental comparisons in our work because the performance gap between 1D and 2D models is not significant and 1D model can be directly compared to models using raw waveforms."

The strided convolution layer learns a filter-bank represention that correspond to filter kernels in a time-frequency representation. In this model, once the raw waveforms pass through the first strided convolution layer, the output feature map has the same dimensions as the mel-spectrogram. This is because the stride, filter length, and number of filters of the first convolution layer correspond to the hop size, window size, and number of mel-bands in the mel-spectrogram, respectively. This configuration was used for music autotagging task in [11, 12] and so we used it as a baseline model."

      "text" : "As described in Section 1, the approach using the raw waveforms should be able to address log-scale amplitude compression and phase-invariance. Simple adding a strided convolution layer is not sufficient to overcome the problems. To improve this, we add multiple layers beneath the frame-level layer such that the first convolution layer can handle much smaller length of samples in filter length. For example, if the stride of the first convolution layer is reduced from 729 to 243, 3-size convolution layer and maxpooling layer are added to keep the output dimensions in the subsequent convolution layers equal. If we go down deep into sample-level along this framework, Six convolution layers (five pairs of 3-size convolution and maxpooling layer following one 3-size strided convolution layer). This is because the temporal dimensionality reduction occurs only through max-pooling and striding when zeropadding is applied on convolution layer to conserve input and output dimensions. We describe the configuration strategy of sample-level CNN model in the following section."

      "heading" : "3.4 Model Design",
      "text" : "Since the length of an audio clip is variable in general, the following issues should be considered when configuring the temporal CNN architecture:\n• Convolution filter length and sub-sampling length.\n• The remaining temporal dimension after the last subsampling layer.\n• The segment length of audio corresponding to the input size of the network.\nFirst, we attempted a very small (sample-level) filter length in convolutional layers by referring to the VGG net [2]. However, unlike images with spatial dimensions such as 224 × 224, audio files contains, for example, 22050 samples per second. Total input size may be similar with images if we use 2.3 seconds of audio as input to the network (224 × 224 ' 22050 × 2.3). However, since we use one-dimentional convolution and sub-sampling for raw waveforms, the filter length and pooling length need to be varied. Therefore, we constructed several different DCNN models to verify the effects on music auto-tagging performance. As a sub-sampling method, max-pooling is generally used. Although sub-sampling using strided convolution has recently been proposed in generative model [9], our preliminary test showed that max-pooling was superior to the stride-style sub-sampling method. We assume that this result is due to the high density characteristics of music data and translation invariance characteristics, which is the advantage of using max-pooling in classification tasks. Thus, we used max-pooling as the basic sub-sampling method. In addition, to test the model performance with minimum layer setting, a pair of single convolution layer and maxpooling layer that share the same filter length and pooling length was defined as a basic building module of the DCNN.\nSecond, the remaining time dimension after the last subsampling layer represents the temporal compression ratio of the entire input audio. We set this value to one in all models in order to compare the performance according to the depth of layers and the stride of first convolution layer. The dimension of the fully connected layer that follows after the last sub-sampling layer is closely related to this value. By shortening this value to one, the parameter can be stored and the fully connected layer can be replaced by a convolution layer with filter length of one.\nThird, in music classification tasks, the input size of the network is an important parameter that determine the classification performance. In the mel-spectrogram based model, one song is generally segmented into 1-4 seconds [11], and then the predictions of all the segments in one song are averaged to make a song-level prediction. In the raw waveform based model, the learning ability according to the segmentation has been not sufficiently explored. Therefore, we conducted experiments to measure the effect of segmentation size on the raw waveform based model. The result shows that segmentation of 1-4 seconds also worked best in raw waveform based model and thus we followed this as our segmentation setting.\nConsidering these issues, we construct mn-DCNN models with different input sizes where m refers to the filter length and pooling length of intermediate convolution layer module, and n refers to the number of the modules (or depth), and evaluate several different values of m.

As described in Section 3.4, m refers to the filter length and pooling length of intermediate convolution layer module, and n refers to the number of the modules. In Table 2, we can first find that the accuracy is proportional to n in most m. Increasing n in our model with the same m\nvalue and input size means that the filter length and stride of the first convolution layer go down to sample-level (e.g. 2 or 3 size). When the first layer’s filter length and pooling length reach the sample-level, the sample-level architectures are simply seen as models constructed with the same filter length and sub-sampling length in all convolution layers as depicted in Table 1. The best results were obtained when m was 3 and n was 9. Interestingly, the length of 3 corresponds to the 3-size spatial filters in the VGG net [2]. In addition, we can see that 1-3 seconds of audio as input length to the network is also a reasonable choice in raw waveform based model as in mel-spectrogram based model. As a result, we find that deep models (more than 10 layers) with 1-3s audio as input having a very small sample-level filter length and sub-sampling length is very effective at learning raw waveforms in the music auto-tagging task."

The models used in the experiments follows our model configuration strategy described in Section 3.4. We added a convolution layer and a pooling layer module at the top module of the 3n−1 model to compress all time dimensions to 1 in the 3n model. In the mel-spectrogram experiments, 128 mel-bands are used to match the number of filters of first convolution layer of raw waveform based model. FFT size was set to 729 in all comparisons and magnitude compression is applied with a nonlinear curve, log(1+C|A|) where A is the magnitude and C is set to 10.\nThe results in Table 3 show that sample-level raw waveform based model achieves results comparable to the framelevel mel-spectrogram based model. We also found that using a smaller hop size (4 ms) than conventional approaches using hop size of 20 ms or so increased the performances significantly. However, if the hop size is less than 4 ms, the performance degrades. An interesting finding from the result of frame-level raw waveform based model is that when the filter length is larger than the stride, the accuracy was slightly lower than the models sharing filter length and stride. We interpret that this phenomenon is due to the learning ability of phase variances. As the filter length decreases, the extent that phase variance that the filter should learn is reduced."

      "text" : "The technique of visualizing the filters learned at each layer allows better understanding of representation learning in the hierarchical network. However, previous works in music domain are limited to visualizing learned filters only on the first convolution layer [11, 12]. Especially the gradient ascent method has been proposed [20] for filter visualization and this technology has provided deeper understanding of what convolutional neural networks learn from images [21,22]. Thus, we applied the gradient ascent method to see how each layer of the proposed network hears the raw waveforms. The gradient ascent method is as follows. First, we generate random noise and back-propagate to the trained network. The loss is set to the target filter. Then, we add the bottom gradients to the input with gradient normalization. By repeating this process several times, we can obtain the waveforms that maximizes the target filter at the input. With the advantage that any dimension can be an input as long as it meets the sub-sampling dimension of the convolution layer because our sample-level DCNN consists solely of a single convolution layer, we could visualize the sorted spectrum in Figure 2 or the learned filters in Figure 3 more clearly using noise of 729 samples as input. The layer 1 shows the three distinctive filter bands which is possible with the filter length with 3 samples. The center frequency of the filter banks increases linearly in low fre-\nquency filter banks but it becomes non-linearly steeper in high frequency filter banks. This trend becomes stronger as the layer goes up. This nonlinearity was found in learned filters with a frame-level end-to-end learning [11] and also in perceptual pitch scales such as mel or bark."

This approach was applied to musical signals as well but has been not fully explored yet. To this end, we propose sample-level deep convolutional neural networks which learn representations from very small grains of waveforms (e.g. 2 or 3 samples) beyond typical frame-level input representations. This allows the networks to hierarchically learn filters that are sensitive to log-scaled frequency, such as mel-frequency spectrogram that is widely used in music classification systems. It also helps learning high-level abstraction of music by increasing the depth of layers. We show how deep architectures with sample-level filters improve the accuracy in music auto-tagging and they provide results that are comparable to previous state-of-the-art performances for the Magnatagatune dataset and Million song dataset. In addition, we visualize filters learned in a sample-level DCNN in each layer to identify hierarchically learned features.",
