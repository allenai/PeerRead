      "text" : "Causality has been studied under several frameworks including potential outcomes [22] and structural equation modeling [19]. Under the Pearlian framework [19] it is possible to discover some causal directions between variables using only observational data with conditional independence tests. The PC algorithm [27] and its variants fully characterize which causal directions can be learned in the general case. For large graphs, GES algorithm [3] provides a score-based test to greedily identify the highest scoring causal graph given the data. Unfortunately, these approaches do not guarantee the recovery of true causal direction between every pair of variables, since typically data could be generated by several statistically equivalent causal graphs.\nA general solution to the causal inference problem is to conduct experiments, also called interventions. An intervention forces the value of a variable without affecting the other system variables. This removes the effect of its causes, effectively creating a new causal graph. These changes in the causal graph create a post-interventional distribution among variables, which can be used to identify\nsome additional causal relations in the original graph. The procedure can be applied repeatedly to fully identify any causal graph [8], [9], [11], [25].\nUnfortunately, for many problems, it can be very difficult to create interventions since they require additional experiments after the original data collection. Researchers would still like to discover causal relations between variables using only observational data, using so-called data-driven causality. Several recent works [2, 24] have developed such methods. To be able to make any conclusions on causal directions in this case, additional assumptions must be made about the mechanisms that generate the data.\nIn this paper we focus on the simplest causal discovery problem that involves only two variables. The two causal graphs X → Y and X ← Y are statistically indistinguishable so conditional independence tests cannot make any causal inference from observational data without interventions. Statistical indistinguishability easily follows from the fact that any joint distribution on two variables p(x, y) can be factorized both as p(x)p(y/x) and p(y)p(x/y).\nThe most popular assumption for two-variable data-driven causality is the additive noise model (ANM) [26]. In ANM, any outside factor is assumed to affect the effect variable additively, which leads to the equation Y = f(X)+E,E ⊥⊥ X. Although restrictive, this assumption leads to strong theoretical guarantees in terms of identifiability, and provides the state of the art accuracy in real datasets. [26] showed that if f is linear and the noise is non-Gaussian the causal direction is identifiable. [10] showed that when f is non-linear, irrespective of the noise, identifiability holds in a non-adverserial setting of system parameters. [20] extended ANM to discrete variables.\nAnother approach is to exploit the postulate that the cause and mechanism are in general independently assigned by nature. The notion of independence here is vague and one needs to assign maps, or conditional distributions to random variables to argue about independence of cause and mechanism. In this direction an information-geometry based approach is suggested [12]. Independence of cause and mechanism is captured by treating the log-slope of the function as a random variable, and assuming that it is independent from the cause. In the case of a deterministic relation Y = f(X), there are theoretical guarantees on identifiability. However, this assumption is restrictive for real data.\nPrevious work exploited these two ideas, additive noise, and independence of cause and mechanism, to draw data-driven causal conclusions about problems in a diverse range of areas from astronomy to neuroscience [24], [23]. [24] uses the same idea that the cause and effect are independent in the time series of a linear filter. They suggest the spectral independence criterion, which is robust to time shifts. [2] uses kernel space embeddings with the assumption that the cause distribution p(x) and mechanism p(y|x) are selected independently to distinguish cause from effect.\nAs noted by [2], although conceptually proposed before, using Kolmogorov complexity of the factorization of the joint distribution p(y|x)p(x) and p(x|y)p(y) as a criterion for deciding causal direction has not been used successfully until now.\nThe use of information theory as a tool for causal discovery is currently gaining increasing attention. This is through different appoaches, e.g., for time-series data, Granger causality and Directed Information can be used [7, 5, 21], see also [14]. However, researchers have not used entropy as a measure of simplicity in the causal discovery literature, probably because the entropies H(Y |X) and H(X|Y ) do not give us any more information than H(X) and H(Y ), due to the symmetry H(Y ) + H(X|Y ) = H(X) + H(Y |X). In our work, as we will explain, we minimize H(E) which initially sounds similar, but is fundamentally different from H(Y |X). Entropy has found some additional uses in the causality literature recently: In [6], authors use maximum mutual information between X,Y in order to quantify the causal strength of a known causal graph.\nThe work that is most similar to ours in spirit is [16], which also drops the additive noise assumption. Their approach and setup are different in many ways: Authors work with continuous\ndata. To be able to handle this generic form, they have to make strong assumptions on the exogenous variable, function, and distribution of the cause: [16] assume that the exogenous variable is a standard Gaussian, a Gaussian mixture prior for the cause, and a Gaussian process as the prior of the function."

      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the causal identifiability problem for discrete variables. Similar to [16], we keep the most general functional model, but only put an assumption on the exogenous (background) variable. Based on Occam’s razor, we employ a simplicity assumption on the unobserved exogenous variable. We use Rényi entropy, which is defined as Ha(X) = 1 1−a log ( ∑ i p a i ), for a random variable X with state probabilities pi. We focus on two special cases of Rényi entropy: H0, which corresponds to the logarithm of the number of states, and H1 which corresponds to Shannon entropy, but our framework can be extended.\nSpecifically, if the true causal direction is X → Y , then the random variable Y is an arbitrary function of X and an exogenous variable E: Y = f(X,E) where E is independent from the cause X. Our key assumption is that the exogenous variable E is simple, i.e., has low Rényi entropy. The postulate is that for any model in the wrong direction X = f ′(Y, Ẽ), the exogenous variable Ẽ has high Rényi entropy. We are able to prove this result for the H0 special case of Rényi entropy, assuming generic distributions for X,Y . Furthermore, we empirically show that using H1 Shannon entropy we obtain practical causality tests that work with high probability in synthetic datasets and that slightly outperforms the previous state of the art in real datasets.\nOur assumption is an entropic interpretation of Occam’s razor, motivated by what E represents in the causal model. The exogenous variable captures the combined effect of all the variables not included in the system model, which affect the distribution of Y . Our causal assumption can be stated as “there should not be too much complexity not included in the causal model\". For a → 1, i.e., Shannon entropy, H(X)+H(E), H(Y )+H(Ẽ) are the number of random bits required to generate an input for the causal system X → Y and X ← Y , respectively. The simplest explanation of an observed joint distribution, i.e., the direction which requires nature to generate smaller number of random bits is selected as the true causal model. More precisely we have the following:\nAssumption 1. Entropy of the exogenous variable E is small in the true causal direction.\nThe notions of simplicity that we consider are H0, which is log-cardinality, and H1, which is Shannon entropy. One significant advantage of using Shannon entropy as a simplicity metric is that it can be estimated more robustly in the presence of measurement errors, unlike cardinality H0.\nWe prove an identifiability result for H0 entropy, i.e., cardinality of E: If the probability values are not adversarially chosen, for most functions, the true causal direction is identifiable under Assumption 1. Based on experimental evidence, we conjecture that a similar identifiability result must hold for Shannon entropy H1.\nTo use our framework we need algorithms that explain a dataset by finding an exogenous variable E with minimum cardinality H0 and minimum Shannon entropy H1. Since the entropies of X and Y can be very different, any metric to determine the true causal direction cannot only consider the entropy of the exogenous variable without incorporating the entropy of the cause. We explain the exogenous variable in both directions and declare the causal direction to be the one with the smallest joint entropy Ha(X) +Ha(E) versus Ha(Y ) +Ha(Ẽ). Our method can be applied for any Rényi entropy Ha but in this paper we only use a = 0 and a = 1.\nUnfortunately, minimizing H0(E) seems very hard for real datasets since it offers no noise robustness. For Shannon entropy we can do much better for real data. The first step in obtaining\na practical algorithm is showing that the minimum H1 explanation is equivalent to the following problem: For n random variables with given marginal distributions, find a joint distribution with the minimum Shannon entropy that is consistent with the given marginals. This problem is called the minimum Shannon entropy coupling and is known to be NP hard [13]. We propose a greedy approximation algorithm for this problem that empirically performs very well. We also prove that, for n = 2, our algorithm always produces a local minimum.\nIn summary our contributions in this paper include:\n• We show identifiability for generic low-entropy causal models under Assumption 1 with H0. • We show that the problems of identifying the minimum cardinality (H0) exogenous variable,\nand identifying the minimum Shannon entropy (H1) exogenous variable given a joint distribution are both NP hard. • We design a novel greedy algorithm for the minimum entropy coupling problem, which turns out to be equivalent to the problem of finding exogenous variable with minimum H1 entropy. • We empirically validate the conjecture that the causal direction is identifiable under Assumption 1 with H1, using experiments on synthetic datasets. • We empirically show that our causal inference algorithm based on Shannon entropy minimization has slightly better performance than the existing best algorithms on a real causal dataset. Interestingly, our algorithm uses only the probability distributions rather than the actual values of the random variables, and hence is applicable to categorical variables."

The observable variable set X has a joint distribution implied by the distributions of U , and the functional relations fi. D is then a Bayesian network for the induced joint distribution of endogenous variables. A standard assumption employed in Pearl’s model causal sufficiency is also used here: Every exogenous variable is a direct parent of at most one endogenous variable.\nIn this paper, we consider a simple two variable causal system which contains only two endogenous variables X,Y . Assume X causes Y , which is represented as X → Y . The model is determined only by one exogenous variable E, and a function f , where Y = f(X,E). The probability distribution of X and E, and f determines the distribution of Y . This model is shown by the tuple M = ({X,Y }, E, f,X → Y, pX,E). Notice that we do not assign an exogenous variable to X, since it is the source node in the graph.\nWe denote the set {1, 2, · · · , n} by [n]. ∑\ni xi is meant to run through every possible index. log refers to the logarithm base 2. For two variables X,Y , Y|X and X|Y denote the conditional probability distribution matrices, i.e., Y|X(i, j) = p(y = i|x = j) and X|Y(i, j) = p(x = i|y = j). The statistical independence of two random variables X and E are shown by X ⊥⊥ E. For notational convenience, probability distribution of random variable X is shown by p(x) as well as pX(x). x shows the distribution of X in vector form , i.e., xi = x(i) = P(X = i). n− 1 simplex is the set of points x in n dimensional Euclidean space that satisfy ∑\ni x(i) = 1. card is the cardinality of a set."

      "text" : "Consider the causal model M = ({X,Y }, E0, f0,X → Y, pX,E). The task is to identify the underlying causal graph X → Y using independent identically distributed samples {(xi, yi)}i. Assuming causal sufficiency, this task reduces to deciding whether X causes Y or Y causes X. To isolate the identifiability problem from estimation errors due to finite samples, we assume that the joint distribution of (X,Y ) is available. Most proofs are deferred to the Appendix.\nOne way to identify that X causes Y is by showing that although there exists a function f and random variable E with Y = f(X,E),X ⊥⊥ E, there is no function, random variable pair (g, Ẽ) such that X = g(Y, Ẽ), Y ⊥⊥ Ẽ. However, without more assumptions, this is not possible: For any joint distribution one can find valid causal models for both X → Y,X ← Y . This is widely known, although for completeness, we provide a proof (Lemma 4 in the Appendix).\nEven when the true causal graph is known, one can create different constructions of f,E with Y = f(X,E),X ⊥⊥ E. There is no way to distinguish the true causal model. However, even though we cannot recover the actual function and the exogenous variable, we can still show identifiability.\nFirst, we give an equivalent characterization of a causal model on two variables.\nDefinition 1 (Block Partition Matrices). Consider a matrix M ∈ {0, 1}n 2×m. Let mi,j represent the i+ (j − 1)n th row of M. Let Si,j = {k ∈ [m] : mi,j(k) 6= 0}. M is called a block partition matrix if it belongs to C := {M : M ∈ {0, 1}n 2×m, ⋃\ni∈[n] Si,j = [m], Si,j ∩ Sl,j = ∅,∀i 6= l}.\nC thus stands for 0, 1matrices with n2 rows andm columns where each block of n rows correspond to a partitioning of the set [m]. We make the following key observation:\nLemma 1. Given discrete random variables X,Y with distribution p(x, y), ∃ a causal model M = ({X,Y }, E, f,X → Y, pX,E), E ∈ E with card(E) = m if and only if ∃M ∈ C, e ∈ R m + with ∑\ni e(i) = 1 that satisfy vec(Y|X) = Me.\nIn other words, the existence of a causal pair X → Y is equivalent to the existence of a block partition matrix M and a vector e of proper dimensions with vec(Y|X) = Me.\nFor simplicity, assume |X | = |Y| = n. We later remove this constraint. We first show that any joint distribution can be explained using a variable E with n(n− 1) + 1 states.\nLemma 2 (Upper Bound on Minimum Cardinality of E). Let X ∈ X , Y ∈ Y be two random variables with joint probability distribution pX,Y (x, y), where |X | = |Y| = n. Then ∃ a causal model Y = f(X,E),X ⊥⊥ E that induces pX,Y , where E has support size n(n− 1) + 1.\nWe can show that, if the columns of Y|X are uniformly sampled points in the n−1 dimensional simplex, then n(n − 1) states are also necessary for E (see Proposition 3 in the Appendix). This shows, unless designed by nature through the causal mechanism, exogenous variable cannot have small cardinality. Based on this observation, the hope is to prove that in the wrong causal direction, say X → Y and we find an Ẽ ⊥⊥ Y such that X = g(Y, Ẽ) for some g, the exogenous variable Ẽ has to have large cardinality. In the next section, we show this is actually through, under mild conditions on f ."

We are interested in the cardinality of variables Ẽ ⊥⊥ X in the wrong causal direction X = g(Y, Ẽ). Considering X|Y, we\ncan show that the same lower bound of n(n − 1) still holds despite nature now chooses E and X randomly, rather than choosing the columns of X|Y directly. A mild assumption on f is needed to avoid degenerate cases (For counterexamples see the appendix).\nDefinition 2 (Generic Function). Let Y = f(X,E) where variables X,Y,E have supports X ,Y, E, respectively. Let Sy,x = f −1 x (y) ⊂ E be the inverse map for x, e, i.e., Sy,x = {e ∈ E : y = f(x, e)}. A function f is called “generic\", if for each (x1, x2, y) triple f −1 x1\n(y) 6= f−1x2 (y) and for every (x, y) pair f−1x (y) 6= ∅.\nIn other words f is called generic if yth row in the xth1 block of matrix M in the decomposition vec(Y|X) = Me is different from yth row in the xth2 block, and both are nonzero. This is not a restrictive condition, for example if p(y|x) are all different, no two rows of M can be the same. For any given conditional distribution, if the probabilities are perturbed by arbitrarily small continuous noise, the corresponding f will be generic almost surely. We have the following main identifiability result:\nTheorem 1 (Identifiability). Consider the causal model M = ({X,Y }, E0, f0,X → Y, pX,E0) where the random variables X,Y have n states, E0 ⊥⊥ X has θ states and f is a generic function .\nIf the distributions of X and E are uniformly randomly selected from the n−1 and θ−1 simplices, then with probability 1, any Ẽ ⊥⊥ Y that satisfies X = g(Y, Ẽ) for some deterministic function g has cardinality at least n(n− 1).\nTheorem 1 implies that the causal direction is identifiable, when the exogenous variable has cardinality < n(n− 1):\nCorollary 1. Assume that there exists an algorithm A that given n random variables {Zi}, i ∈ [n] with distributions {pi}, i ∈ [n] each with n states, outputs the distribution of the random variable E with minimum cardinality and functions {fi, i ∈ [n]} where Zi = fi(E).\nConsider the causal pair X → Y where Y = f(X,E0). Assume that the cardinality of E0 is less than n(n− 1), and f is generic. Then, A can be used to identify the true causal direction with probability 1, if X,E0 are selected uniformly randomly from the proper dimensional simplices.\nProof. Feed the set of conditional distributions {P(Y |X = i) : i ∈ [n]} and {P(X|Y = i) : i ∈ [n]} to A to obtain E, Ẽ. From Theorem 1, with probability 1, A identifies Ẽ with card(Ẽ) ≥ n(n− 1). Then since card(E) ≤ card(E0) < card(Ẽ), comparing cardinalities give the true direction.\nCorollary 1 gives an algorithm for finding the true causal direction: Estimate E, Ẽ with minimum H0 entropy and declare X → Y if |Ẽ| > |E| and declare X ← Y if |Ẽ| < |E|. The result easily extends to the case where X and Y are allowed to have different number of states:\nProposition 1 (Inference algorithm). Suppose X → Y . Let X ∈ X , Y ∈ Y, |X | = n, |Y| = m. Assume that A is the algorithm that finds the exogenous variables E, Ẽ with minimum cardinality. Then, if the underlying exogenous variable E0 satisfies |E0| < n(m− 1), with probability 1, we have |X|+ |E| < |Y |+ |Ẽ|.\nProof follows from Corollary 1, and by extending the proof of Theorem 1 to different cardinalities for X, Y .\nUnfortunately, it turns out there does not exist an efficient algorithm A, unless P=NP:\nTheorem 2. Given a conditional distribution matrix Y|X, identifying E ⊥⊥ X with minimum support size such that there exist a function f with Y = f(X,E) is NP hard.\nThe hardness of this problem sets us to search for alternative approaches."

To see this, we can write H(Y |X) = ∑\ni pX(i)H(Y |X = i), whereas since conditional probability distribution of Y |X = i is the same as the distribution of fi(E) for some function fi, we have H(E) ≥ maxi H(Y |X = i)."

The last equality follows from the fact that X ⊥⊥ E. Thus, we can treat the conditional distributions P(Y |X = x) as distributions that emerge by applying some function fx to some unobserved variable E.

It can be shown that H(E) ≥ H(f1(E), f2(E), . . . , fn(E)). Regarding fi(E) as a random variable Ui, the best lower bound on H(E) can be obtained by minimizing H(U1, U2, . . . , Un).

First, we test the greedy entropy minimization algorithm and show that it performs close to the trivial lower bound. Then, we test our conjecture of identifiability using entropy. Lastly, we test our entropyminimization based causal identification technique on real data.\nIn order to test our algorithms, we sample points in proper dimensional simplices, which correspond to distributions for X and E. Distribution of points are uniform for selecting the distribution of X. It is well-known that a vector [xi/Z]i is uniformly randomly distributed over the simplex, if xi are i.i.d. exponential random variables with parameter 1, and Z = ∑\ni xi [18]. To sample lowentropy distributions for E, instead of exponential, we use a heavy tailed distribution for sampling each coordinate. Specifically, we use [ei/Z]i, where ei are i.i.d. log-normal random variables with parameter σ. We observe that this allows us to sample a variety of distributions with small entropy.\nPerformance of Greedy Entropy Minimization: We sample distributions for n random variables {Xi}, i ∈ [n] each with n states and apply Algorithm 1 to minimize their joint entropy. We compare our greedy joint entropy minimization algorithm with the simple lower bound of maxiH(Xi). Figure 1a shows average, maximum and minimum excess bits relative to this lower bound. Contrary to the pessimistic bound of log n bits, joint entropy is at most 1 bit away from maxi H(Xi) for the given range of n.\nVerifying Entropy-Based Identifiability Conjecture: In this section, we empirically verify Conjecture 1. The distributions for X are uniformly randomly sampled from the simplex in n dimensions. We also select f randomly (see implementation details).

This allows us to get distribution samples from different regimes. We only consider the samples which satisfy H(E) ≤ log n.\nAfter sampling E,X, f , we identify the corresponding Y|X and X|Y for Y = f(X,E). We apply greedy entropy minimization on the columns of the induced distributions Y|X,X|Y to get the estimates E, Ẽ for both causal models Y = f(X,E) and X = g(Y, Ẽ), respectively. Figure 1b shows the variation of success probability, i.e., the fraction of samples which satisfy H(X) + H(E) < H(Y ) +H(Ẽ).

ANM have been reported to achieve an accuracy of 63% with a confidence interval of ±10% [17]. We also use the binomial confidence intervals as in [4].\nThe cause effect pairs show very different characteristics. From the scatter plots, one can observe that they can be a mix of continuous and discrete variables. The challenge in applying our framework on this dataset is choosing the correct quantization. Small number of quantization levels may result in loss of information regarding the joint distribution, and a very large number of states might be computationally hard to work with. We pick the same number of states for both X and Y , and use a uniform quantization that assures each state of the variables has ≥ 10 samples on average. From the samples, we estimate the conditonal transition matrices Y|X and X|Y and feed the columns to the greedy entropy minimization algorithm (Algorithm 1), which outputs an approximate of the smallest entropy exogenous variable. Later we compare H(X,E) and H(Y, Ẽ) and declare the model with smallest input entropy to be the true model, based on Conjecture 1.\nFor a causal pair, we invoke the algorithm if |H(X,E) − H(Y, Ẽ)| ≥ t log(n) for threshold parameter t, which determines the decision rate. Accuracy becomes unstable for very small decision rates, since the number of evaluated pairs becomes too small. At 100% decision rate, algorithm achieves 64.21% which is slightly better than the 63% performance of ANM as reported in [17]. In addition, our algorithm only uses probability values, and is applicable to categorical as well as ordinal variables."

We have\np(y|x) = ∑\ne∈E\np(y|x, e)p(e|x) = ∑\ne∈E\np(y|x, e)p(e) (1)\nsince E ⊥⊥ X. Define the matrix Y|Xk(i, j) := P(Y = i|X = j, E = k). Then, from (1), we can decompose the conditional probability distribution matrix Y|X as follows:\nY|X = ∑\nk∈E\nekY|Xk. (2)\nSince f is deterministic, each value of X is mapped to exactly one value of Y , when E is conditioned on. Thus each column of Y|Xk has exactly a single 1 with remaining entries being zeros. Thus, each entry of Y|X is a subset sum of pE . Let Si,j represent this subset, i.e., p(y = i|x = j) = ∑\nk∈Si,j ek. Notice that the xth column of Y|X is the conditional distribution P(Y |X = x) =\nP(f(x,E)|X = x) = P(f(x,E)) = P(fx(E)), where fx(E) := f(x,E). Since fx is a deterministic function, each value in its domain maps to exactly one value in its range. This implies that Sy,x = f−1x (y) are disjoint for fixed x, i.e., Si,j 6= Sl,j∀l 6= i. Also, since each value of E must be mapped to a value of Y by fx, the union of Si,j over i must be the whole support [m].\nDefine mi,j to be the length m vector which is 1 in the columns indexed by Si,j. Construct M from the rows mi,j such that mi,j is the i + (j − 1)nth row of M. By construction, M is a block partition matrix. Pick e = [e1, e2, . . . , em]. Then we have vec(Y|X) = Me.\n(⇐) For reverse direction, assume there exists matrices M, e with block partition M and ∑\ni ei = 1, such that vec(Y|X) = Me. Define E to be the random variable independent from X, with probability distribution pE := e and support E = [m].\nLet wi be the ith column of M. Then we have vec(Y|X) = ∑\ni eiwi. Now de-vectorize Y|X and wi to have\nY|X = m ∑\ni=1\neiUi, (3)\nwhere wi = vec(Ui). Each column of Ui, comes from distinct size-n blocks of M and since M is block partition, each column of Ui contains a single 1 ∀i. Thus each Ui represent a valid map fi : X → Y, where fi(x) is given by the nonzero row of xth column of Ui.\nA function f with two input variables X,E, where E ∈ E = [m] is completely determined by the set of functions {f(X, 1), f(X, 2), ..., f(X,m)}. Let f(X, e) be the function described by the matrix Ue and f be the function determined by {f(X, e), e ∈ E}. Apply the constructed f on X,E to get Z = f(X,E). Then we have P(Y = y|X = x) = P(Z = y|X = x)∀x, since both Z and Y induce the same conditional distribution Y|X.\nFor any set of realizations of (X,Y ) = {xi, yi}, we can construct a set of realizations of E, {ei} based on the conditional distribution P(E|Z = yi,X = xi). Then we have yi = f(xi, ei). Also, since P(Z = y,X = x) = P(Y = y,X = x) this process induces the same joint distributions between variables X,Y,E and X,Z,E, i.e., P(X = x,E = e, Z = y) = P(X = x,E = e, Y = y), and conditional independence statement implied by one holds for the other. Thus X ⊥⊥ E."

Then there exists two causal models M1 = ({X,Y }, E, f,X → Y, pX,E) and M2 = ({X,Y }, Ẽ, g,X ← Y, pY,Ẽ) with E ⊥⊥ X and Ẽ ⊥⊥ Y that induce the same joint distribution p(x, y).\nWe will prove by construction. Consider the conditional probability transition matrix Y|X. Without loss of generality, assume X = [m],Y = [n]. From Lemma 1, it is sufficient to show that there exists M ∈ C and e such that vec(Y|X) = Me.\nFor now, assume that each entry of Y|X is a rational number. Scale the fractional form of each term in Y|X so that each denominator becomes the same as the least common multiple of denominators. Denote this least common multiple by λ. Let ǫ be 1/λ.\nLet G0 = Y|X and apply the following procedure for i from 1 to λ in order to construct {Fi, i ∈ [λ]}: Set Gi+1 to Gi − ǫFi, where Fi is the n×m, {0, 1} matrix containing only a single 1 in the largest entry of every column of current Gi. This procedure is called to be successful if Gi is set to all zero matrix for i = λ.\nThe above procedure iteratively removes 1 from the numerator of the fractional form of one probability value per column (of Y|X). Since each column sums to 1, numerators of each column sum to λ. Thus the procedure is successful. Thus we have,\nY|X = λ ∑\nk=1\nǫFk. (4)\nLet e = [ǫ, ǫ, ..., ǫ] be a length-λ vector. Each entry of Y|X is a subset sum of e. Also, since Fi contains a single 1 per column by construction, every subset of e is disjoint within a column. Thus, we can construct M ∈ C such that vec(Y|X) = Me.\nIf the entries are not fractional, we can still find small enough ǫ to complete the above procedure.\nThe same process can be implemented with X|Y to obtain Ẽ, g such that X = Y (g, Ẽ)."

Then, with probability 1, ∄(M, e) with vec(Y|X) = Me for M ∈ {0, 1}n 2×m, when m < n(n− 1).\nProof. We use the following technique to generate uniformly randomly sampled points on the simplex in n dimensions [18]:\nLemma 5. Let xi ∼ U [0, 1] for i ∈ [n − 1] be i.i.d random variables, ordered such that xi ≥ xj for i > j. Let x0 = 0 and xn = 1. Then u = [ui]i∈[n] where ui = xi − xi−1,∀i ∈ [n], is a random vector uniformly distributed over n− 1 simplex.\nFirst, we construct vec(Y|X) directly using n(n− 1) uniform i.i.d. random variables: Consider x̃i for i ∈ [n\n2] where each consecutive block {x̃jn+1, x̃jn+2, . . . , x̃jn+n}, j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} of size n is sampled from the generative model in Lemma 5 before reordering. Thus x̃i are i.i.d. with x̃i ∼ U [0, 1] for n(n− 1) indexes by construction. Order x̃i within each block in ascending order to get xi in accordance with Lemma 5. Defining the vectors x = [xi] and x̃ = [x̃i], we have x = Px̃ for some permutation matrix P. From x, we can construct z̃ = vec(Y|X) using the same map used in Lemma 5 for each block (the map from ui from xi in Lemma 5). This construction is a linear map H where each submatrix of H is full rank.\nFor the sake of contradiction, let z̃ = M̃e be a decomposition where M̃ ∈ {0, 1}n(n−1)×m where m < n(n−1). Ignoring the entries where z̃i = 1−xi−1, we can relabel z̃ to get z with z ∈ [0, 1]\nn(n−1). Correspondingly, we can write z = Me, where M is the submatrix of M̃ obtained by ignoring the corresponding rows.\nThe construction of z from x based on the above construction yields z = Wx for a full rank matrix W. Notice that any subset of rows are linearly independent due to specific structure of H.\nLet r be the rank of M. Clearly r < n(n − 1). Then, some of the (at least n(n − 1) − r) rows of M can be written as a unique linear combination of r linearly independent rows.\nConsider one such row m0, where m0 = ∑r\ni=1 αimi and mi are a set of linearly independent rows of M. Define a = [−1, α1, α2, ...αr ]\nT . Take r + 1 rows of W corresponding to the selected zi’s to form Wr. Then we have, a TWrx = a TWrPx̃ = 0. Recall that any subset of rows of W is full rank, and P is a permutation matrix. Hence, left nullspace of WrP is empty, implying that x̃ has to be orthogonal to the vector aTWrP 6= 0. This is a probability 0 event for any nonzero a, since each x̃i is independently sampled from a continuous distribution. Probability that all such constraints are satisfied is zero since it is less than the probability that one particular constraints is satisfied. This argument holds for any fixed M. Since there are finitely many such {0, 1} matrices, probability that there exists such an M is 0.\nThus, unless M has rank at least n(n− 1), there does not exist a decomposition Me = z with probability 1."

Assign P(X = i) = xi∑\nj xj , and P(E = k) = ek∑ j ej .\nLet p = vec(Y|X). Then, as shown in Section 2.1, we can write\np = Me (5)\nNotice that jth block of n rows of p give the conditional probability distribution of Y given X = j. Let Si,j represent the set of indices of e that contribute to the probability of observing Y = i given X = j, i.e., pi,j =\n1∑ j ej\n∑\nk∈Si,j\nek. Thus ith row in jth block, or equivalently i+(j− 1)nth row\nof M is 1 in the indices Si,j.\nThe fact that f is generic implies each row of M is distinct and non-empty.\nFor the sake of contradiction, assume that there exists Ẽ ⊥⊥ Y with cardinality m < n(n − 1), with some deterministic function g such that X = g(Y, Ẽ) induces the same joint distribution p(x, y). By Lemma 1, this implies that there exists M̃ ∈ {0, 1}n 2×m end ẽ such that\nq = M̃ẽ, (6)\nwhere q = vec(X|Y) and ẽ is the probability distribution vector of Ẽ. Let qi,j = P(X = i|Y = j). Then from Bayes’ rule, we have\nqi,j = pj,ixi ∑\ni pj,ixi =\nxi ∑\nk∈Sj,i ek\n∑ i xi ∑ k∈Sj,i ek\n. (7)\nNotice that the denominators ∑ j xj and ∑\nj ej in each term disappear due to cancellation of numerator and denominator.\nThus we have\nq =\n[\np11x1 ∑\nk p1kxk ,\np12x2 ∑\nk p1kxk , · · · , (8)\np1nxn ∑\nk p1kxk ,\np21x1 ∑\nk p2kxk , · · ·\npnnxn ∑\nk pnkxk\n]T\n(9)\nFrom (6), drop the rows of q that contain xn in the numerator as well as the corresponding rows of M̃. The new linear system becomes:\nq̄ = M̄ẽ, (10)\nwhere q̄ and M̄ are the desribed submatrices of q and M̃ respectively.\nM̄ has n(n− 1) rows and m columns. We have\nrank(M̄) ≤ m < n(n− 1). (11)\nSince rank of M̄ is less than n(n− 1), the rows of M̄ are linearly dependent. This implies there is at least one set of coefficients {αi} not identically zero that satisfies αM̄ = 0, where\nα = [ α1,1, α1,2, · · · , α1,n−1, α2,1, · · · , αn,n−1 ] . (12)\nThen,\nαq̄ = αM̄ẽ = 0 (13)\nHence, the elements of q̄ should satisfy the linear equation. Then this linear equation in terms of qi,j can be written as:\nn ∑\ni=1\n∑n−1 j=1 αi,jpi,jxj ∑n\nj=1 pi,jxj =\n∑n−1 j=1 α1,jp1,jxj ∑n\nj=1 p1,jxj +\n∑n−1 j=1 α2,jp2,jxj ∑n\nj=1 p2,jxj\n+ ∑n−1 j=1 α3,jp3,jxj ∑n\nj=1 p3,jxj + . . .+\n∑n−1 j=1 αn,jpn,jxj ∑n\nj=1 pn,jxj = 0 (14)\nSlightly abusing the notation, relabel pi,j as pi,j = ∑\nk∈Si,j ek, since\n∑\nk ek terms cancel in the\nexpression above. We know from Section 2.1 that Si,j ∩ Sk,j = ∅ for k 6= i. Additionally, due to the assumption that f is generic, we have Si,j 6= Si,k.\nTo prove contradiction, in the following we show that for any given non-zero α, this equation is non-zero with probability 1.\nTo show this, we show that after equating the denominators, each term brings a unique monomial. Hence, the result is a polynomial where each αi,j is accompanied with at least one unique monomial. Thus, the polynomial cannot be identically zero, and the probability of choosing a root of this polynomial is zero.\nFor now, assume that the denominator is finite. Later, we will show denominator is almost surely finite to complete the argument.\nLemma 7. If xi and ei are i.i.d. exponential random variables with mean 1, and the function f is generic, (14) holds with probability 0, i.e., P((14) holds ) = 0.\nProof. Multiply each term with the denominators of others to get a single fraction. Then, with a finite denominator, numerator should be zero for equation to hold. Define c1 to be the coefficient of xn−1n x1 in the numerator after equating the denominators. Since xn only appears due to terms from the denominator, we have\nc1 = α1,1(p1,1p2,np3,n . . . pn,n)\n+ α2,1(p1,np2,1p3,n . . . pn,n)\n+ · · ·+ αn,1(p1,np2,np3,n . . . pn,1) (15)\nSince S1,1 6= S1,n due to f being generic, we have, (a) Either ∃ei ∈ S1,1, ei /∈ S1,n (b) Or ∃ei /∈ S1,1, ei ∈ S1,n\nWithout loss of generality, assume some ei1 ∈ Si,1, after a potential relabeling. This is possible since Si,1 are disjoint for different i and non-zero. (Then, as we will see e\n2 i1\nonly appears together with αi,1 in (15)). Similarly, assume some ein ∈ Si,n.\nConsider the mulitiplier of coefficient αi,1. Assume case (a) holds for Si,1, i.e., ∃ei ∈ Si,1, ei /∈ Si,n. Then, αi,1 is accompanied with term e 2 i since ei ∈ Sj,n for some j 6= i. Also, it is easy to see that no other term contains e2i since Si,1 does not appear again and no Sj,1, j 6= i contains ei. Assume case (b) holds for the multiplier of αi,1, i.e., ∃ein ∈ Si,n, ein /∈ Si,1. Then every term except αi,1 is accompanied by either ein or ein 2, since pi,n appears in every other term.\nAbove argument implies that every term is different from the rest. This implies that every distinct αi,j is accompanied by a different monomial in the form x n−1 n xj ∏ k∈Ti,j ek, for some Ti,j ⊂ [θ], where Ti,j are distinct for different i. Thus, since at least one αi,j is nonzero the resulting polynomial in the numerator is not identically zero. Then the numerator is a non-zero polynomial of the terms {x1, x2, . . . , xn, e1, e2, . . . , en}. We know that the roots of a non-zero polynomial defined over a compact domain has Lebesque measure zero [1]. Hence probability of numerator being zero is 0.\nThen we have,\nP((14) = 0) = P( Numerator of (14) = 0\nOR Denominator of (14) = ∞)\n≤ P( Numerator of (14) = 0)\n+ P( Denominator of (14) = ∞).\nP( Numerator of (14) = 0) is shown to be zero by the argument above. We need to argue that the denominator cannot be infinity.\nFor this, denote denominator random variable to be ξ. We can write\nP(ξ < ∞) = 1− P(lim sup n→∞ εn), (16)\nwhere εn is the event that {ξ ≥ tn} for a sequence of tn such that limn→∞ tn = ∞. Pick tn = n 2.\nSince ξ is nonnegative, we can apply Markov inequality to get\nP(εn) ≤ E[ξ]\ntn . (17)\nClearly, E[ξ] < ∞. Since ∑ n P(εn) = E[ξ] ∑ n 1 tn < ∞, applying Borel-Cantelli lemma, we have\nP(lim sup n→∞ εn) = 0, (18)\nwhich implies P(ξ < ∞) = 1. Thus, we have\nP((14) = 0) ≤ 0 ⇒ P((14) = 0) = 0. (19)\nNow we can prove the main theorem: Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists a pair (g, Ẽ) that satisfy X = g(Y, Ẽ), Ẽ ⊥\n⊥ Y . By Lemma 1, this is equivalent to the statement that there exists pair (M̃, e) that satisfy (6). Define events ε1(M̃k, ẽ) = { Event that q = M̃kẽ } and ε2(M̃k) = { Event that αkq = 0 }, Mk is a fixed {0, 1}n\n2×m matrix and αk is one set of coefficients imposed by linear dependence of rows of M̃k. Notice that here q is a random vector, determined by {xi}, i ∈ [n] and {ei}, i ∈ [θ]. Clearly, ε1 implies ε2, thus P(ε1) ≤ P(ε2). Now we can write:\nP(∃(g, Ẽ) such that X = g(Y,E))\n= P(∃(M̃, ẽ) such that q = M̃ẽ) (20)\n= P(∃(M̃, ẽ) such that ε1 is true) (21)\n≤ P(∃(M̃, ẽ) such that ε2 is true) (22)\n= P(∃(M̃) such that ε2 is true) (23) ≤ ∑\nk\nP( Given M̃k, αkq = 0) (24)\n= ∑\nk\nP(αkq = 0) = 0. (25)\n(20) follows from the fact that both representations are equivalent by Lemma 1. (22) is due to the fact that if ε1, then ε2. (23) is due to the fact that ε2 does not depend on ẽ, but only on M̃. (24) follows from union bound over all matrices M̃k. The last equation follows from Lemma 7 and the fact that there are finitely many M̃k ∈ {0, 1} n2×m with m < n(n− 1) columns.\n5.6 A counterexample when Si,j = Si,k\nFollowing counterexample shows that without the additional assumption, identifiability result in Theorem 1 does not hold.\nConsider the following equation:\n\n             p1,1 p2,1 p3,1 p1,2 p2,2 p3,2 p1,3 p2,3 p3,3\n\n             =\n\n             1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1\n\n             ×   e1 e2 e3   (26)\nIn the reverse direction, we can fit the following system, which has smaller cardinality for the exogenous variable:\n\n             q1,1 q2,1 q3,1 q1,2 q2,2 q3,2 q1,3 q2,3 q3,3\n\n             =\n\n             1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1\n\n             ×   x1 x1+x2+x3 x2 x1+x2+x3 x3 x1+x2+x3   (27)\nNotice that ei terms completely disappear in this symmetric case. Thus, exogenous variable with n states is sufficient to describe the reverse conditional probability distribution matrix, independent from the cardinality of exogenous variable in the true direction, i.e., the value of θ.\nOur main theorem suggests, under the condition that no Si,j is the exact subset of {e1, e2, ...}, no such case can arise, and the reverse direction requires exogenous variable with at least n(n− 1) states.\n5.7 A counterexample when pi,j ≥ 0\nThe critical component of the proof was that each linear equation implied by the rank deficiency of the system had unique non-zero coefficients.

Identify the decomposition that minimizes card(X ).\nLemma 8. The decomposition problem is NP hard.\nProof. We use subset sum problem for the reduction:\nDefinition 4. Subset sum problem: For a given set of integers V , and an integer a, decide whether there exists a subset S of V such that ∑\nu∈S u = a.\nSubset sum is a well known NP complete problem. Consider any instance of the subset sum problem with the set V = {u1, u2, ..., um} and an integer a. Assume without loss of generality ui 6= 0,∀i ∈ V . If not, one can work with the set of nonzero values in V . Construct them by 2matrix M with M(i, 1) = ui and M(1, 2) = a,M(2, 2) = −a+ ∑\ni∈[m] ui,M(i, 2) = 0,∀i ∈ {2, 3, ...,m}. Update M by dividing each element by ∑\ni∈V ui. This does not change the answer to the subset sum problem. Now column sum of M is 1 for both columns. It can be shown that the decomposition of Lemma 2 can always be applied here to get a decomposition with |X | = m+ 1 (number of nonzero terms −1). We also know that any decomposition need to touch each nonzero element in each column at least once. Hence the column with largest number of nonzero elements yields the lower bound |X ∗| ≥ m.\nWe show that optimal decomposition size is m if and only if there is a subset of V that sums to a.\nFirst, assume ∃S ⊂ V such that ∑\nu∈S u = a. Consider the following decomposition: Let xk = uk for k ∈ [m]. Let Fk(k, 1) = 1 be the only nonzero element in the first column. Pick the nonzero element in the second column of Fk based on the membership of uk in S: Let Fk(1, 2) = 1 if uk ∈ S and Fk(2, 2) = 1 if uk ∈ V \\S. This decomposition is optimal due to lower bound.\nNow we show that if optimum has size m, then ∃ a subset sum with value a: Recall that each Fk has a single 1 per column and decomposition has m terms. Since first column of M has m non-zero terms, each term in the decomposition must be equal to the elements of this column, which is the elements of the given set. Since Fk are 0,1 matrices with single 1 per column by construction, every element of M must be a subset sum of the decomposition terms. Hence, a is a subset sum of set elements.\nThis shows that a subset sum exists if and only if optimal decomposition has size m. Thus, if we could find the optimal decomposition size in all instances of the decomposition problem, we would solve all instances of the subset sum problem.\nNow, we give a definition related to decomposability:\nDefinition 5. α−decomposability: A matrix M is called α−decomposable if it can be written as a convex combination of α {0, 1} matrices, each with a single 1 per column.\nIdentifying the exogenous variable with minimum cardinality is equivalent to finding minimum size e with M ∈ C such that vec(Y|X) = Me from Lemma 1. Notice that matrix Y|X is α−decomposable if and only if there exists e of size α along with M ∈ C such that vec(Y|X) = Me.\nConsider any decomposition problem. If we had an algorithm that could solve all instances of the problem of identifying E with minimum support, we could feed the normalized matrix from the decomposition problem as Y|X to this algorithm and solve the decomposition problem."

Consider the following optimization problem:\nH∗(U1, U2, ..., Um) = min p(u1,u2,...,um) H(U1, U2, ..., Um)\ns. t. p(ui) = pi,∀i (30)\nIn words, optimization problem finds the joint distribution of m variables with minimum entropy, subject to marginal distribution constraints for every variable. Notice that this problem is nonconvex: It minimizes a concave function with respect to linear constraints.\nLet X,E be discrete, independent random variables where X ∈ [m] and E ∈ [t]. Recall that every conditional distribution P(Y |X = x) can be written as the distribution of a function of random variable E. Let us investigate the underlying probability space, in order to generate the probability space to optimize the joint distribution over.\nWe can consider the product probability space\nP = (Ω = ΩX ×ΩE = [m]× [t] , F = 2 Ω , p) (31)\nfor random variables X : ΩX → [n], E : ΩE → [t] with X(ω) = ω, Y (ω) = ω. Then for ω = (ωx, ωe) ∈ Ω, p(ω) = pX(ωx)pE(ωe).\nConsider the equation Y = f(X,E). Let fx : ΩE → ΩY be the function mapping E to Y when X = x, i.e., fx(E) := f(x,E). Then\nP(Y = y|X = x) = P(fx(E) = y|X = x) (32)\n= P(fx(E) = y), (33)\nwhere last equality follows from the fact that X ⊥⊥ E. Let sigma algebra generated by the random variable f(x,E) be Fωx . Formally, the sigma algebras generated by f(x,E) are subsigma algebras of disjoint, but identical sigma algebras. In other words, even though Fωx ⊆ 2\n(ωx,ΩE) are disjoint for different ωx, (ωx,ΩE) are identical for every ωx ∈ ΩX . Thus the sigma algebras generated by f(x,E) = gx(E) can be thought of as subsigma algebras of the same sigma algebra, i.e., the one generated by E. In other words, we can equivalently construct Fωx ⊆ 2\nΩE . This construction allows us to talk about the joint probability distribution of the random variables {fx(E) : x ∈ X}.\nLet Ui = fi(E). Then we have,\nH(E) = H(E|U1, U2, ..., Um) +H(U1, U2, ..., Um) (34)\n−H(U1, U2, ..., Um|E) (35)\n≥ H(U1, U2, ..., Um). (36)\nInequality follows from the fact that H(U1, U2, ..., Um|E) = 0 and H(E|U1, U2, ..., Um) ≥ 0.\nH(E) ≥ H(U1, U2, ..., Um). Thus, the best lower bound on the entropy of exogenous variable E can be obtained by solving the optimization problem below.\nH(E) ≥ min p(u1,u2,...,um) H(U1, U2, ..., Um)\nsubject to p(ui) = pi, i = 1, . . . ,m. (37)\nSince we are picking E with minimum possible entropy without restricting (not observing) the functions fx, we can actually construct an E that achieves this minimum: Let the optimal joint distribution be p∗(u1, u2, ..., um). We can construct E with n\nm states with state probabilities equal to p∗(u) for each configuration of u. This E has the same entropy as the joint entropy, since probability values are the same. Thus,\nH(E∗) = min p(u1,u2,...,um) H(U1, U2, ..., Um)\nsubject to p(ui) = pi\nThe functions fi, where Ui has the same distribution as fi(E), can be constructed from the distribution of E and Ui. This determines the function f , hence the causal model M that induces the conditional distribution Y|X. Note that E ⊥⊥ X by construction. (For a complete argument on how one can always generate E ⊥⊥ X based on a set of samples of X,Y , see the proof of Lemma 1)."

We first show that the KKT conditions on the problem (30) imply that the optimal solution is quasi-orthogonal :\np∗(u, v) = M = U(x, y)δx,y, (38)\nwhere U is rank 1 and δu,v is an indicator for the support of optimal joint distribution. We call such M as masked submatrix of a rank 1 matrix.\nLet (i, j)th entry of the joint distribution be xi,j . We have n 2 variables {xi,j, i ∈ [n], j ∈ [n]} to\noptimize over. In a general optimization problem\nmin x f0(x)\ns. t. hi(x) = 0, i ∈ [p]\nfi(x) ≤ 0, i ∈ [m],\nLagrangian becomes\nL(x, λ, v) = f0(x) +\nm ∑\ni=1\nλifi(x) +\np ∑\ni=1\nvihi(x), (39)\nwhich gives the KKT conditions\nfi(x ∗) ≤ 0, i ∈ [m] hi(x ∗) = 0, i ∈ [p] λ∗i ≥ 0, i ∈ [m] λ∗i fi(x ∗) = 0, i ∈ [m] ∇L(x∗, λ∗, v∗) = 0\nThis implies, for fixed i, either fi(x ∗) = 0 or λ∗i = 0.

This implies that xi,j = 2\n1+v (1) i +v (2) j . Hence the optimal\njoint satisfies p∗i,j = uivj for some vectors u, v, whenever p ∗ i,j 6= 0.\nNext we show that such u, v can be constructed from any algorithm output:\nTheorem 4. For any matrix M output by Algorithm 1, there exists u, v where M is a masked submatrix of uvT .\nProof of Proposition 4. Consider the following variant of Algorithm 1 for two distributions p,q: Initialize an n × n zero matrix M0. In every iteration, find m1 = maxi p(i),m2 = maxi q(i). Let a = argmaxi p(i) and b = argmaxi q(i). Assign r = min{m1,m2} to the (a, b)th entry of M. Update p(a) ← p(a)− r,q(b) ← q(b)− r. Repeat the process until p = 0,q = 0.\nThis variant constructs the joint distribution matrix rather than the distribution of E directly. We need the following definitions:\nDefinition 6. An ordered set of coordinates ((i1, j1), (i2, j2), . . . , (im, jm)) of a matrix M is called a path on matrix M, if either it+1 = it or jt+1 = jt,∀t ∈ [m− 1].\nDefinition 7. An ordered set of coordinates ((i1, j1), (i2, j2), . . . , (im, jm)) of a matrix M is called a cycle on matrix M, if either it+1 = it or jt+1 = jt,∀t ∈ [m− 1] and either i1 = im or j1 = jm.\nFirst we prove a structural characterization for matrix M.\nLemma 9. Any matrix M output by Algorithm 1 contains no cycles.\nProof. Consider a bipartite graph G with n left and n right vertices constructed as follows: G has an edge (i, j) if and only if M(i, j) is nonzero.\nIt is easy to see that the matrix M has no cycles if and only if the corresponding bipartite graph G has no cycles. We claim that, for an M output by Algorithm 1, corresponding G cannot have any cycles.\nConstruct the bipartite graph in the same order as matrix M is created by Algorithm 1. Notice that when the algorithm assigns a value to M(i, j), it satisfies either ith row constraint or jth column constraint. Then no other value can be assigned to that row or column. We call this zeroing out the corresponding row/column.\nIn the bipartite representation, say an edge (i, j) is added at time t. We call a vertex of the added edge closed, if the corresponding dimension (row or column) is zeroed out. Thus each added edge to the bipartite graph closes one of the endpoints of that edge. A closed vertex cannot participate to the formation of any other edges. This captures the fact that when zeroed out, a row/column cannot be assigned a non-zero value again by the algorithm.\nAssume at time t, a cycle is formed in the bipartite graph. Then at time t− 1, there must be a path with a single edge missing. Let the edges of this path be labeled as {e1, e2, . . . em}. There is a time order in which these edges are constructed. Let ek be the first edge formed in this path. Then one of its endpoints must be closed. However it belongs to a path, which means an edge was attached to a closed vertex, which is a contradiction. Assume ek is the edge at the end of the path and the closed endpoint is also the endpoint of the path. However an edge is attached to this closed vertex at time t to form the cycle, which is a contradiction.\nConsider a matrix M output by the algorithm. We prove that M is a masked submatrix of uvT by construction: Let the first entry selected by Algorithm 1 have coordinates (i0, j0). Since algorithm zeroes out either the row or column, (i0, j0) is the only non-zero entry in either its column or row. Assume without loss of generality that selection of (i0, j0) by Algorithm 1 zeroes out row i0.\nInitialize by assigning ui0 = 1 and vj0 = M(i0, j0). Let Sj0 represent the non-zero row indices for column j0. Now assign the values of u(k) for k ∈ Sj0 such that u(Sj0)vj0 = M(Sj0 , j0), where u(S) stands for the subvector containing entries with index in S.\nRepeat the above procedure by exhausting either a row or column at each time.\nLemma 10. The above construction never runs into an entry (i, j) for which both ui and vj were assigned before.\nProof. Assume otherwise. Then, due to the process of assigning the entries of u, v, there must be two paths from (i, j) to the starting point of (i0, j0): One path that follows column j, and one path that follows row i. In other words, there exists k, l ∈ [n] such that there are two paths ((i, j), (k, j), . . . , (i0, j0)) and ((i, j), (i, l), . . . , (i0, j0)). Combining these paths, we get the cycle ((i, j), (k, j), . . . , (i0, j0), . . . , (i, l)), which is a contradicton.\nHence, algorithm selects every element in u and v at most once. Thus it produces a valid assignment for u, v."

Unlike previous work, we keep the most general functional model but make an assumption on the unobserved exogenous variable: Inspired by Occam’s razor, we assume that the exogenous variable is simple in the true causal direction. We quantify simplicity using Rényi entropy. Our main result is that, under natural assumptions, if the exogenous variable has low H0 entropy (cardinality) in the true direction, it must have high H0 entropy in the wrong direction. We establish several algorithmic hardness results about estimating the minimum entropy exogenous variable. We show that the problem of finding the exogenous variable with minimum entropy is equivalent to the problem of finding minimum joint entropy given n marginal distributions, also known as minimum entropy coupling problem. We propose an efficient greedy algorithm for the minimum entropy coupling problem, that for n = 2 provably finds a local optimum. This gives a greedy algorithm for finding the exogenous variable with minimum H1 (Shannon Entropy). Our greedy entropy-based causal inference algorithm has similar performance to the state of the art additive noise models in real datasets. One advantage of our approach is that we make no use of the values of random variables but only their distributions. Our method can therefore be used for causal inference for both ordinal and also categorical data, unlike additive noise models.",
