      "text" : "Most conventional sentence similarity methods only focus on similar parts of two input sentences, and simply ignore the dissimilar parts, which usually give us some clues and semantic meanings about the sentences. In this work, we propose a model to take into account both the similarities and dissimilarities by decomposing and composing lexical semantics over sentences. The model represents each word as a vector, and calculates a semantic matching vector for each word based on all words in the other sentence. Then, each word vector is decomposed into a similar component and a dissimilar component based on the semantic matching vector. After this, a twochannel CNN model is employed to capture features by composing the similar and dissimilar components. Finally, a similarity score is estimated over the composed feature vectors. Experimental results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art performance on the answer sentence selection task, and achieves a comparable result on the paraphrase identification task."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Sentence similarity is a fundamental metric to measure the degree of likelihood between a pair of sentences. It plays an important role for a variety of tasks in both NLP and IR communities. For example, in paraphrase identification task, sentence similarity is used to determine whether two sentences are paraphrase or not (Yin and Schütze, 2015; He et al., 2015). For question answering and information retrieval tasks, sentence similarities between queryanswer pairs are used for assessing the relevance and\nranking all the candidate answers (Severyn and Moschitti, 2015; Wang and Ittycheriah, 2015).\nHowever, sentence similarity learning has following issues:\n1. there is a lexical gap between semantically equivalent sentences. Take the E1 and E2 in Table 1 for example, they have the similar meaning but with different lexicons.\n2. semantic similarity should be measured at different levels of granularity (word-level, phraselevel and syntax-level). E.g., “not related” in E2 is an indivisible phrase when matching with “irrelevant” in E1 (shown in square brackets).\n3. the dissimilarity (shown in angle brackets) between two sentences is also a significant clue (Qiu et al., 2006). For example, by judging the dissimilar parts, we can easily identify that E3 and E5 share the similar meaning “The study is about salmon”, because “sockeye” belongs to the salmon family, and “flounder” does not. Whereas the meaning of E4 is quite different from E3, which emphasizes “The study is about red (a special kind of) salmon”, because both “sockeye” and “coho” are in the salmon family. How can we extract and utilize those information becomes another issue.\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n07 01\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Fe\nb 20\n16\nIn order to handle the issues above, researchers have been working on sentence similarity algorithms for a long time. To bridge the lexical gap (issue 1), some word similarity metrics were proposed to match different but semantically related words. Examples include knowledge-based metrics (Resnik, 1995) and corpus-based metrics (Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Yin and Schütze, 2015; He et al., 2015). To measure sentence similarity from various granularities (issue 2), researchers have explored features extracted from n-grams, continuous phrases, discontinuous phrases, and parse trees (Yin and Schütze, 2015; He et al., 2015; Heilman and Smith, 2010). The third issue did not get much attention in the past, the only related work of Qiu et al. (2006) explored the dissimilarity between sentences in a pair for paraphrase identification task, but they require human annotations in order to train a classifer, and their performance is still below the state of the art.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel model to tackle all these challenges jointly by decomposing and composing lexical semantics over sentences. Given a sentence pair, the model represents each word as a low-dimensional vector (issue 1), and calculates a semantic matching vector for each word based on all words in the other sentence (issue 2). Then based on the semantic matching vector, each word vector is decomposed into two components: a similar component and a dissimilar component (issue 3). We use similar components of all the words to represent the similar parts of the sentence pair, and dissimilar components of every word to model the dissimilar parts explicitly. After this, a two-channel CNN operation is performed to compose the similar and dissimilar components into a feature vector (issues 2 and 3). Finally, the composed feature vector is utilized to predict the sentence similarity. Experimental results on two tasks show that our model the state-of-the-art performance on the answer sentence selection task, and achieves a comparable result on the paraphrase identification task.\nIn following parts, we start with a brief overview of our model (Section 2), followed by the details of our end-to-end implementation (Section 3). Then we evaluate our model on answer sentence selection and paraphrase identifications tasks (Section 4)."

      "text" : "Figure 1 shows an overview of our sentence similarity model. Given a pair of sentences S and T , our task is to calculate a similarity score sim(S, T ) in following steps:\nWord Representation. Word embedding of Mikolov et al. (2013) is an effective way to handle the lexical gap issue in the sentence similarity task, as it represents each word with a distributed vector, and words appearing in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings (Mikolov et al., 2013). With those pre-trained embeddings, we transform S and T into sentence matrixes S = [s1, ..., si, ..., sm] and T = [t1, ..., tj , ..., tn], where si and tj are ddimension vectors of the corresponding words, and m and n are sentence length of S and T respectively.\nSemantic Matching. In order to judge the similarity between two sentences, we need to check whether each semantic unit in one sentence is cov-\nered by the other sentence, or vice versa. For example, in Table 1, to check whether E2 is a paraphrase of E1, we need to know the single word “irrelevant” in E1 is matched or covered by the phrase “not related” in E2. In our model, we treat each word as a primitive semantic unit, and calculate a semantic matching vector ŝi for each word si by composing part or full word vectors in the other sentence T . In this way, we can match a word si to a word or phrase in T . Similarly, for the reverse direction, we also calculate all semantic matching vectors t̂j in T .\nŝi = fmatch(si, T ) ∀si ∈ S t̂j = fmatch(tj , S) ∀tj ∈ T\n(1)\nWe explore different fmatch functions latter in Section 3.\nDecomposition. After the semantic matching phase, we have the semantic matching vectors of ŝi and t̂j . We interpret ŝi (or t̂j) as a semantic coverage of word si (or tj) by the sentence T (or S). However, it is not necessary that all the semantics of si (or tj) are fully covered by ŝi (or t̂j). Take the E1 and E2 in Table 1 for example, the word “sockeye” in E1 is only partially matched by the word “salmon” (the similar part) in E2, as the full meaning of “sockeye” is “red salmon” (the semantic meaning of “red” is the dissimilar part). Motivated by this phenomenon, our model further decomposes word si (or tj), based on its semantic matching vector ŝi (or t̂j), into two components: similar component s+i (or t + j ) and dissimilar component s−i (or t − j ). Formally, we define the decomposition function as:\n[s+i ; s − i ] = fdecomp(si, ŝi) ∀si ∈ S\n[t+j ; t − j ] = fdecomp(tj , t̂j) ∀tj ∈ T\n(2)\nComposition. Given a similar component matrix S+ = [s+1 , ..., s + m] (or T + = [t+1 , ..., t + n ]) and a dissimilar component matrix S− = [s−1 , ..., s − m] (or T− = [t−1 , ..., t − n ]), our goal in this step is how to utilize those information. Besides the suggestion from Qiu et al. (2006) that the significance of the dissimilar parts alone between two sentences has a great effect of their similarity, we also think that the dissimilar and similar components have strong connections. For example, in Table 1, if we only look at the dissimilar or similar part alone, it is hard to\njudge which one between E4 and E5 is more similar to E3. We can easily identify that E5 is more similar to E3, when we consider both the similar and dissimilar parts. Therefore, our model composes the similar component matrix and dissimilar component matrix into a feature vector ~S (or ~T ) with the composition function:\n~S = fcomp(S +, S−) ~T = fcomp(T +, T−)\n(3)\nSimilarity assessing. In the final stage, we concatenate the two feature vectors (~S and ~T ) and predict the final similarity score:\nsim(S, T ) = fsim(~S, ~T ) (4)"

The goal of fmatch is to generate a semantic matching vector ŝi for si by composing the vectors from T .\nFor a sentence pair S and T , we first calculate a similarity matrix Am×n, where each element ai,j ∈ Am×n computes the cosine similarity between words si and tj as\nai,j = sTi tj\n‖si‖ · ‖tj‖ ∀si ∈ S, ∀tj ∈ T.

A semantic matching vector ŝi is a weighted sum vector of all words tj in T , where each weight is the normalized word similarity ai,j . The max function moves to the other extreme. It generates the semantic matching vector by selecting the most similar\nword vector tk from T . The local-w function takes a compromise between global and max, where w indicates the size of the window to consider centered at k (the most similar word position). So the semantic matching vector is a weighted average vector from tk−w to tk+w."

The intention of fdecomp is to decompose a word vector sj based on its semantic matching vector ŝj into a similar component s+i and a dissimilar component s−i , where s + i indicates the semantics of si covered by ŝi and s−i indicates the uncovered part. We implement three types of decomposition function: rigid, linear and orthogonal.\nThe rigid decomposition only adapts to the max version of fmatch. First, it detects whether there is an exactly matched word in the other sentence, or si equal to ŝi. If yes, the vector si is dispatched to the similar component s+i , and the dissimilar component is assigned with a zero vector 0. Otherwise, the vector si is assigned to the dissimilar component s−i . Eq. (7) gives the formal definition:\n[s+i = si; s − i = 0] if si = ŝi [s+i = 0; s − i = si] otherwise\n(7)\nThe motivation for the linear decomposition is that the more similar between si and ŝi, the higher proportion of si should be assigned to the similar component. First, we calculate the cosine similarity α between si and ŝi. Then, we decompose si linearly based on α. Eq. (8) gives the corresponding definition:\nα = sTi ŝi ‖si‖ · ‖ŝi‖ s+i = αsi s−i = (1− α)si\n(8)\nThe orthogonal decomposition is to decompose a vector in the geometric space. Based on the semantic matching vector ŝi, our model decomposes si into a parallel component and a perpendicular component. Then, the parallel component is viewed as\nthe similar component s+i , and perpendicular component is taken as the dissimilar component s−i . Eq.

      "text" : "The aim of the composition function fcomp in Eq. (3) is to extract features from both the similar component matrix and the dissimilar component matrix. We also want to acquire similarities and dissimilarities of various granularity during the composition phase. Inspired from Kim (2014), we utilize a twochannel convolutional neural networks (CNN) and design filters based on various order of n-grams, e.g., unigram, bigram and trigram.\nThe CNN model involves two sequential operations: convolution and max-pooling. For the convolution operation, we define a list of filters {wo}. The shape of each filter is d × h, where d is the dimension of word vectors and h is the window size. Each filter is applied to two patches (a window size h of vectors) from both similar and dissimilar channels, and generates a feature. Eq. (10) expresses this process.\nco,i = f(wo ∗ S+[i:i+h] + wo ∗ S − [i:i+h] + bo) (10)\nwhere the operation A ∗ B sums up all elements in B with the corresponding weights in A, S+[i:i+h] and S−[i:i+h] indicate the patches from S\n+ and S−, bo is a bias term and f is a non-linear function (we use tanh in this work). We apply this filter to all possible patches, and produce a series of features ~co = [co,1, co,2, ..., co,O]. The number of features in ~co depends on the shape of the filter wo and the length of the input sentence. To deal with variable feature size, we perform a max-pooling operation over ~co by selecting the maximum value co = max ~co. Therefore, after these two operations, each filter generates only one feature. We define several filters by varying the window size and the initial values. Eventually, a vector of features is captured by composing the two component matrixes, and the feature dimension is equal to the number of filters."

All the experiments in this subsection were performed on the QASent dataset and evaluated on the development set.\nFirst, we evaluated the effectiveness of various semantic matching functions. We switched the semantic matching functions among {max, global, locall}, where l ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}, and fixed the other options as: the linear decomposition, the filter types including {unigram, bigram, trigram}, and 500 filters for each type.

By increasing the window size, the local-l function acquired progressive improvements when the window size is smaller than 4. But after we enlarged the window size to 4, the performance dropped. The local-3 function worked better than the max function in term of the MAP, and also got a comparable MRR. Therefore, we use the local-3 function in the following experiments.\nSecond, we studied the effect of various decomposition operations. We varied the decomposition operation among {rigid, linear, orthogonal}, and kept the other options unchanged. Figure 3 shows the performance. We found that the rigid operation got the worst result.

Table 3 presents the performances of the state-of-the-art systems and our model, where the performances were evaluated with the standard trec eval-8.0 script 1. Given a pair of sentences, Severyn and Moschitti (2015) employed a CNN model to compose each sentence into a vector separately, and joined the two sentence vectors to compute the sentence similarity. Because only the sentence-level granularity was used, the performance is much lower (the second row of Table 3). After adding some word overlap features between the two sentences, the performance was improved significantly (the third row of Table 3). Therefore, the lower-level granularity is an indispensable factor for a good performance. Wang and Ittycheriah (2015) conducted word alignment for a sentence pair based on word vectors, and measured the sentence similarity based on a couple of word alignment features. They got a slightly better performance (the fourth row of Table 3), which indicates that the vector representation for words is helpful to bridging the lexical gap problem. Our model makes use of all these useful factors and also considers the dissimilarities of a sentence pair. We can see that our model got a significantly better performance than all the other work (the last row).\n1http://trec.nist.gov/trec eval/\nWikiQA dataset.

(2015) models the sentence similarity by enriching LSTMs with a latent stochastic attention mechanism. The corresponding performance is given at the third row of Table 4. Yin et al. (2015) introduced the attention mechanism into the CNN model, and captured the best performance (the fourth row of Table 4). The semantic matching phase in our model is similar to the attention mechanism. But different from the previous models, our model utilizes both the similarity and dissimilarity simultaneously. The last row of Table 4 shows that our model is more effective than the other models.\nMSRP dataset. Table 5 summarized the results from our model and several state-of-the-art models. Yin and Schütze (2015) employed a CNN model\nto learn sentence representations on multiple level of granularity and modeled interaction features at each level for a pair of sentences. They obtained their best performance by pretraining the model on a language modeling task (the 3rd row of Table 5). However, their model heavily depends on the pretraining strategy. Without pretraining, they got a much worse performance (the second row of Table 5). He et al. (2015) proposed a similar model to Yin and Schütze (2015). Similarly, they also used a CNN model to extract features at multiple levels of granularity. Differently, they utilized some extra annotated resources, e.g., embeddings from part-ofspeech (POS) tags and PARAGRAM vectors trained from the Paraphrase Database (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013). Their model outperformed Yin and Schütze (2015) without the need of pretraining (the sixth row of Table 5). However, the performance was reduced after removing the extra resources (the fourth and fifth rows of Table 5). Yin et al. (2015) applied their attention-based CNN model on this dataset. By adding a couple of sparse features and using a layerwise training strategy, they got a pretty good performance. Comparing to these neural network based models, our model obtained a comparable performance (the last row of Table 5) without using any sparse features, extra annotated resources and specific training strategies. However, the best performance so far on this dataset is obtained by Ji and Eisenstein (2013). In their model, they just utilized several hand-crafted features in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Therefore, the deep learning methods still have a long way to go for this task."

In this work, we propose a model to take into account both the similarities and dissimilarities by decomposing and composing lexical semantics over sentences. The model represents each word as a vector, and calculates a semantic matching vector for each word based on all words in the other sentence. Then, each word vector is decomposed into a similar component and a dissimilar component based on the semantic matching vector. After this, a twochannel CNN model is employed to capture features by composing the similar and dissimilar components. Finally, a similarity score is estimated over the composed feature vectors. Experimental results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art performance on the answer sentence selection task, and achieves a comparable result on the paraphrase identification task.",
