      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Monasteries are conceived by the Benedictine monastic order, founded by Saint Benedict of Nursia, during the last period of the Western Roman Empire. The monastic shape aims to preserve the European Christianity inside of small self-sustaining communities where to lead a life of mystic and religious contemplation and introspection.1 The main principle is to protect and shield Christian religion and tradition from barbarian invasions.\nMonasteries differ from convents primarily because of their purpose. Monasteries are inhabited by monks belonging to some monastic order such as the Benedictine one, having an ascetic and solitary lifestyle. Convents, originated later with the mendicant orders, such as the Franciscan one, are more dependent by the outside world. The two religious constructions arise in different historical periods carrying out different functions inside the religious community. Starting from the VII century, Western Europe is characterized by a capillary network of monasteries. Their shape in Occident remained largely unchanged in its characteristics during the whole Middle Age and in all Christian countries.\nMonasteries are often also abbeys that are spaces where the nullius diocesis is effective. Such norm, in the canon law, represents the independence of a church and of the related monastery from the diocese in which the building is located. Therefore, the abbot substitutes for the bishop inside the Benedictine “village”.\n1 «Monasticism has its root in the interpretation of the Christian faith developed in the theology of the VI century firstly in Orient. Analogously to theology and architecture, it is subjected to a deep transformation in Occident. [ ... ] The Benedictine Order remains for a long time the principal one. Hundreds of convents and monasteries are spread across the Christian Europe and represent cells of Christian tradition and faith, of science, and of culture» [9].\nar X\niv :1\n70 9.\n02 61\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\nStrongly inspired by the rule of Saint Benedict, the plan of St. Gall, illustrated in Figure 1, is a model of monastery better representing the Benedictine architecture.2 Founded in the context of Pre-Romanesque Carolingian art and architecture, in which a varied partition of the space is preferred, it can be considered a fixed-type for the Middle Age monasteries [8]. Moreover, being one of the most ancient descriptions of primitive Benedictine monastery arrived intact today, it turns out to be an important structural, architectonic, and functional landmark for the Benedictine monasteries. In the plan, St. Gall monastery is idealized together with its essential components. In fact, as it often happens in the context of architectural history, buildings realized in a long temporal window are subject to change with respect to the original idea because of historical, economical, practical, and morphological reasons. Many European monasteries are inspired by the St. Gall plan even if for practical and technical reasons they deviate from it. For instance, Catania’s Benedictine Monastery [1,7] contains the major part of the elements of the St. Gall plan with the exception of some locations such as the brewery that, for cultural reasons, is replaced by a distillery. Moreover, Catania’s Benedictine Monastery is a urban monastery and therefore the structure of the animal farms is also slightly modified.\nIn this paper we present an OWL 2 ontology, called SaintGall Ontology, representing the monastery described in the St. Gall plan. SaintGall Ontology has been developed by taking into account structural, architectonic, and functional details of the buildings included in the plan and information provided by [8,9,10,11]. It consists of more than 400 classes, almost 60 object properties, and more than 1000 logical axioms. It exploits OWL 2 constructs such as existential restriction and qualified cardinality restriction, and has been classified using the Fact++ reasoner."

      "text" : "The SaintGall Ontology3 describes buildings and green spaces depicted in the plan of Saint Gall considering their cardinal orientation, their position with respect to other entities inside the plan, and their architectonic, structural, and functional features.\n2http://www.stgallplan.org/ 3https://goo.gl/ftbajj\nThe ontology exploits the following main classes. The class Building describes a generic building, Garden specifies a generic green space, Element describes architectonic elements, natural elements, furnitures, spaces contained in the plan. The ontology also provides classes and properties to describe the cardinal orientation, position, and shape of the structures of the plan, and the role of people living inside the monastery.\nAt first we model the functional areas of the monastery classifying the buildings represented on the map according to their intended use. Specifically, we introduce as subclasses of Building the pairwise disjoint classes BuildingForEducation, BuildingForHospitality, BuildingForTheSickAndInfirm, FarmBuilding, PrincipalMonasticBuilding.\nBuildingForEducation includes, in particular, the class School, modeling a building meant for the education of scholars, and the class NoviceCloister, representing the novice cloister, dwelling of young people oriented to the monastic life. BuildingForHospitality contains among others the class HospitiumDistingueshedGuests, modeling the hospitium for the reception of eminent strangers and the class HospitiumPoorTravelersPilgrims, representing the dwelling of poor travelers and pilgrims. The class BuildingForTheSickAndInfirm contains in particular the subclass InfirmaryCloister, representing the cloister where the sick brethren are lodged, and the class DoctorHouse, containing among others a private room for the physician and a room for very ill patients. The class FarmBuilding models the factory, the working house, and other buildings devoted to domestic cattle, poultry, and their keepers. The class PrincipalMonasticBuilding includes in particular the class AbbotHouse, modeling the dwelling of the abbot, the class TheCloister, describing the cloister where monks live, and the class TheChuch, describing the abbey. The subclass hierarchy of Building is shown in Figure 2.\nThe green spaces inside the monastery are modeled by means of the class Garden, having the disjoint subclasses Cemetery, KitchenGarden, and PhysicGarden. Cardinal orientation of buildings and gardens on the map are modeled by the classes CardinalDirection, CentralPosition, and the objectproperty hasPosition, having as range the union of CardinalDirection and CentralPosition. CardinalDirection is a finite enumeration of the values East, North, NorthEast, NorthWest, South, SouthEast, SouthWest, West. CentralPosition contains only the individual Centre. In addition, we introduce the defined classes CentralArea, EastArea, NorthArea, NorthEastArea, NorthWestArea, WestArea, SouthEastArea, SouthWestArea, SouthArea, whose subclasses representing the buildings and gardens of the monastery are deduced by inference. Figure 3 shows the description of the class NorthArea while Figure 4 illustrates the inferred hierarchy of NorthArea.\nIn addition, we define the position of buildings or gardens in the map with respect to other contiguous buildings or gardens, by means of the object-properties onEastOf, onNorthEastOf, onNorthOf, onNorthWestOf, onSouthEastOf, onSouthOf, onSouthWestOf, onWestOf, where onEastOf is the inverse of onWestOf, onNorthOf of onSouthOf, onNorthWestOf of onSouthEastOf, and onNorthEastOf of onSouthWestOf.\nThen, shape, size, and internal structure of buildings and gardens are analyzed. We define the class Shapemodeling the shape of structures, such as cloisters (RectangulaShape or SquareShape) and whose subclass hierarchy is shown in Figure 5, and the object-\nproperty hasShape, having as range the class Shape. The class Size and the objectproperty hasSize model the size of buildings. Buildings in the map having the same size are associated to equivalent subclasses of the class Size. The internal structure of the buildings in the map is modeled by means of the class Element having subclasses describing objects used in everyday life such as Bedstand, Window, Door. It contains also the class ArchitectonicElement, describing architectonic elements included in buildings such as the cloisters, the abbey, and the abbot house. AchitectonicElement contains the subclasses Aisle, Apse, OpenArch, Transept, and similar. Another important subclass of Element is SpatialElement providing descriptions of generic spaces contained in the buildings of the map and contains subclasses such as Chamber, Kitchen, Library, Refectory. In addition, we provide the object-properties contains, together with its subproperties consistOf, containsAround, and so on, and its inverse isContainedIn, together with its subproperties isPartOf, isContainedAround, and so on. The hierarchy of subclasses of Element and of the related properties are illustrated in Figure 6 and 7.\nIn Figure 8 we show our representation of the abbot house. This building, inhabited by the abbot, is surrounded by a fence. It consists of two stories of which the\nlower one has an open portico on the east and on the west side. The inner space is split into two chambers: sleeping room and sitting room of the abbot. The upper story contains some small chambers and one large chamber. Details concerning the furniture of the abbot sitting room and of the abbot sleeping room are modeled by the classes AbbotSittingRoom and AbbotSleepingRoom, respectively, both subclasses of Chamber, which in its turn is subclass of SpatialElement. Our representation of the monk cloister can be found in Figure 10.\nWe also model people living in the monastery. As shown in Figure 9, they are classified according to the place in which they live and spend most of the day."

      "heading" : "3. Conclusions",
      "text" : "We presented an ontology for the Saint Gall plan, that describes the ideal model of the structure of a monastic Benedictine building. The plan allows one to study the most significant features of European monastic buildings such as the Monastery of San Nicolò l’Arena in Catania, the Abbey of Santa Giustina in Padua, the Cluny Abbey, the Montecassino Abbey [8]. By means of SaintGall Ontology, scholars and researchers in Human Science can effectively compare several distinct monastic architectures and from\nthe differences and similarities they can make inferences not only in the architectonic and stylistic ambits but also in the interpretative and theological ones [10].\nThe temporal variable must necessarily be taken into account because monasteries change their shape over the centuries, partly for reasons of technological innovation and partly for political and theological reasons.\nWe are currently considering the integration of the SaintGall Ontology with the ontology on the Benedictine Monastery of Catania presented in [2] and with widespread ontologies for cultural heritage such as as CIDOC-CRM.4 Some generic classes from the SaintGall Ontology, such as Church and Cloister, can be reused to design novel ontologies describing buildings outside the Benedectine context. Consider, for instance, the architectonic structure of closed garden (cloister or court) than can be also found in municipal buildings.\nThe SaintGall Ontology was designed in such a way as to describe the SaintGall map in detail. That makes it more complex than the ontology of the Monastery of Catania [2] and than Ontoceramic [6], an ontology for the classification of pottery. Moreover SaintGall Ontology cannot be represented in the set-theoretic fragment considered in [3], used in recent work by some of the authors for ontologies representation and reasoning. Thus, we intend to design a new decidable set-theoretic fragment admitting the composition operator allowing one to represent and reason on the SaintGall Ontology. Results in [4,5] are helpful to construct an appropriate decision procedure for such set-theoretic fragment.\n4http://www.cidoc-crm.org\nAs future work we plan to integrate the ontology with the ontology of the Benedictine Monastery of Catania and with widespread ontologies for cultural heritage such as CIDOC-CRM5 and with spatial ontologies such as Spatial Ontology. The SaintGall Ontology turns out to be more complex from the point of view of logic than the ontology of the Benedictine Monastery of Catania [2] and Ontoceramic [6], an ontology for the classification on pottery. Therefore we plan to define a novel decidable fragment of Computable Set-Theory able to represent the SaintGall Ontology and thus able to express the composition operator."
