      "text" : "In recent years, transition-based dependency parsers powered by neural network scoring functions have dramatically increased the state-of-theart in terms of both speed and accuracy (Chen and Manning, 2014; Alberti et al., 2015; Weiss et al., 2015). Similar approaches also achieve state-ofthe-art in other NLP tasks, such as constituency parsing (Durrett and Klein, 2015) or semantic role labeling (FitzGerald et al., 2015). These approaches all share a common principle: replace hand-tuned conjunctions of traditional NLP feature templates with continuous approximations learned by the hidden layer of a feed-forward network.\n∗Research conducted at Google.\nHowever, state-of-the-art dependency parsers depend crucially on the use of predicted part-ofspeech (POS) tags. In the pipeline or stacking (Wolpert, 1992) method, these are predicted from an independently trained tagger and used as features in the parser. However, there are two main disadvantages of a pipeline: (1) errors from the POS tagger cascade into parsing errors, and (2) POS taggers often make mistakes precisely because they cannot take into account the syntactic context of a parse tree. The POS tags may also contain only coarse information, such as when using the universal tagset of Petrov et al. (2011).\nOne approach to solve these issues has been to avoid using POS tags during parsing, e.g. either using semi-supervised clustering instead of POS tags (Koo et al., 2008) or building recurrent representations of words using neural networks (Dyer et al., 2015; Ballesteros et al., 2015). However, the best accuracy for these approaches is still achieved by running a POS tagger over the data first and combining the predicted POS tags with additional representations. As an alternative, a wide range of prior work has investigated jointly modeling both POS and parse trees (Li et al., 2011; Hatori et al., 2011; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012; Qian and Liu, 2012; Wang and Xue, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Alberti et al., 2015). However, these approaches typically require sacrificing either efficiency or accuracy compared to the best pipeline model, and often they simply re-rank the predictions of a pipelined POS tagger.\nIn this work, we show how to improve accuracy for both POS tagging and parsing by incorporating stacking into the architecture of a feed-forward network. We propose a continuous form of stacking that allows for easy backpropagation down the pipeline across multiple tasks, a process we call\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n06 59\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n1 M\nar 2\n01 6\n“stack-propagation” (Figure 1). At the core of this idea is that we use POS tags as regularization instead of features.\nOur model design for parsing is very simple: we use the hidden layer of a window-based POS tagging network as the representation of tokens in a greedy, transition-based neural network parser. Both networks are implemented with a refined version of the feed-forward network (Figure 3) from Chen and Manning (2014), as described in Weiss et al. (2015). We link the tagger network to the parser by translating traditional feature templates for parsing into feed-forward connections from the tagger to the parser (Figure 2). At training time, we unroll the parser decisions and apply stackpropagation by alternating between stochastic updates to the parsing or tagging objectives (Figure 4). The parser’s representations of tokens are thus regularized to be individually predictive of POS tags, even as they are trained to be useful for parsing when concatenated and fed into the parser network.\nThe key advantage of our approach is that at test time, we do not require predicted POS tags for parsing. Instead, we run the tagger network over the entire sentence, and then dynamically connect the parser network to the tagger network based upon the discrete parser configurations as parsing unfolds. In this way, we avoid cascading POS tagging errors to the parser. In addition, because the parser re-uses the representation from the tagger, we can drop all lexicalized features from the parser network, leading to a compact, faster model.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the layout of our combined\narchitecture. In Section 3, we introduce stackpropagation and show how we train our model. We evaluate our approach on 19 languages from the Universal Dependencies treebank in Section 4. We observe a >2% absolute gain in labeled accuracy compared to state-of-the-art, LSTM-based greedy parsers (Ballesteros et al., 2015) and a >1% gain compared to a state-of-the-art, graphbased method (Lei et al., 2014). We also evaluate our method on the Wall Street Journal, where we find that our architecture outperforms other greedy models, especially when only coarse POS tags from the universal tagset are provided during training. In Section 5, we systematically evaluate the different components of our approach to demonstrate the effectiveness of stack-propagation compared to traditional types of joint modeling. We also show that our approach leads to large reductions in cascaded errors from the POS tagger.\nWe hope that this work will motivate further research in combining traditional pipelined structured prediction models with deep neural architectures that learn intermediate representations in a task-driven manner. One important finding of this work is that, even without POS tags, our architecture outperforms recurrent approaches that build custom word representations using character-based LSTMs (Ballesteros et al., 2015). These results suggest that learning rich embeddings of words may not be as important as building an intermediate representation that takes multiple features of the surrounding context into account. Our results also suggest that deep models for dependency parsing may not discover POS classes when trained solely for parsing, even when it is fully within the capacity of the model. Designing architectures to apply stack-propagation in other coupled NLP tasks might yield significant accuracy improvements for deep learning."

In a traditional stacking (pipeline) approach, we would use the discrete predicted POS tags from the tagger as features in the parser (Chen and Manning, 2014). In our model, we instead feed the continuous hidden layer activations of the tagger network as input to the parser. The primary strength of our approach is that the parser has access to all of the features and information used by the POS tagger during training time, but it is allowed to make its own decisions at test time.\nTo implement this, we show how we can reuse feature templates from Chen and Manning (2014) to specify the feed-forward connections from the tagger network to the parser network. An interesting consequence is that because this structure is a function of the derivation produced by the parser, the final feed-forward structure of the stacked model is not known until run-time. However, because the connections for any specific parsing decision are fixed given the derivation, we can still extract examples for training off-line by unrolling the network structure from gold derivations. In other words, we can utilize our approach with the same simple stochastic optimization techniques used in prior works. Figure 2 shows a fully unrolled architecture on a simple example."

Like the “windowapproach” network of Collobert et al. (2011), the tagger is evaluated per-token, with features extracted from a window of tokens surrounding the target. The input consists of a rich set of features for POS tagging that are deterministically extracted from the training data. As in prior work, the features are divided into groups of different sizes that share an embedding matrix E. Features for each group g are represented as a sparse matrix Xg with dimension F g × V g, where F g is the number of feature templates in the group, and V g is the vocabulary size of the feature templates.

Instead of a windowbased classifier, features are extracted from an arcstandard parser configuration1 c consisting of the\n1Note that the “stack” in the parse configuration is separate from the “stacking” of the POS tagging network and the parser network (Figure 1).\nstack s, the buffer b and the so far constructed dependencies. (Nivre, 2004). Prior implementations of this model used up to four groups of discrete features: words, labels (from previous decisions), POS tags, and morphological attributes (Chen and Manning, 2014; Weiss et al., 2015; Alberti et al., 2015).\nIn this work, we apply the same design principle but we use an implicitly learned intermediate representation in the parser to replace traditional discrete features. We only retain discrete features over the labels in the incrementally constructed tree (Figure 4). Specifically, for any token of interest, we feed the hidden layer of the tagger network evaluated for that token as input to the parser. We implement this idea by re-using the feature templates from prior work as indexing functions.\nWe define this process formally as follows. Let fi(c) be a function mapping from parser configurations c to indices in the sentence, where i denotes each of our feature templates. For example, in Figure 4(a), when i =stack0, fi(c) is the index of “fox” in the sentence. Let htagger1 (j) be the hidden layer activation of the tagger network evaluated at token j. We define the input Ximplicit by concatenating these tagger activations according to our feature templates:\nximpliciti , h tagger 1 (fi(c)). (2)\nThus, the feature group Ximplicit is the rowconcatenation of the hidden layer activations of the tagger, as indexed by the feature templates. We have that F implicit is the number of feature templates, and V implicit = Htagger, the number of possible values is the number of hidden\nunits in the tagger. Just as for other features, we learn an embedding matrix Eimplicit of size H implicit×F implicit. Note that as in the POS tagger network, we reserve an additional null value for out of scope feature templates. A full example of this lookup process, and the resulting feedforward network connections created, is shown for a simple three-feature template consisting of the top two tokens on the stack and the first on the buffer in Figure 2. See Table 1 for the full list of 20 tokens that we extract for each state."

      "heading" : "3 Learning with Stack-propagation",
      "text" : "In this section we describe how we train our stacking architecture. At a high level, we simply apply backpropagation to our proposed continuous form of stacking (hence “stack-propagation.”) There are two major issues to address: (1) how to handle the dynamic many-to-many connections between the tagger network and the parser network, and (2) how to incorporate the POS tag labels during training.\nAddressing the first point turns out to be fairly easy in practice: we simply unroll the gold trees into a derivation of (state, action) pairs that produce the tree. The key property of our parsing model is that the connections of the feedforward network are constructed incrementally as the parser state is updated. This is different than a generic recurrent model such as an LSTM, which passes activation vectors from one step to the next. The important implication at training time is that, unlike a recurrent network, the parser decisions are conditionally independent given a fixed history. In other words, if we unroll the network structure ahead of time given the gold derivation, we do not need to perform inference when training with respect to these examples. Thus, the overall training procedure is similar to that introduced in Chen and Manning (2014).\nTo incorporate the POS tags as a regularization during learning, we take a fairly standard approach from multi-task learning. The objective of learning is to find parameters Θ that maximize the data log-likelihood with a regularization on Θ for both parsing and tagging:\nmax Θ\nλ ∑\nx,y∈T log(PΘ(y | x))+∑\nc,a∈P log (PΘ(a | c)) , (3)\nwhere {x, y} are POS tagging examples extracted from individual tokens and {c, a} are parser (configuration, action) pairs extracted from the unrolled gold parse tree derivations, and λ is a tradeoff parameter.\nWe optimize this objective stochastically by alternating between two updates:\n• TAGGER: Pick a POS tagging example and update the tagger network with backpropagation. • PARSER: (Figure 4) Given a parser configuration c from the set of gold contexts, compute both tagger and parser activations. Backpropagate the parsing loss through the stacked architecture to update both parser and tagger, ignoring the tagger’s softmax layer parameters.\nWhile the learning procedure is inspired from multi-task learning—we only update each step with regards one of the two likelihoods—there are subtle differences that are important. While a traditional multi-task learning approach would use the final layer of the parser network to predict both POS tags and parse trees, we predict POS tags from the first hidden layer of our model (the “tagger” network) only. We treat the POS labels as regularization of our parser and simply discard the softmax layer of the tagger network at test time. As we will show in Section 4, this regularization leads to dramatic gains in parsing accuracy. Note that in Section 5, we also show experimentally that stack-propagation is more powerful than the traditional multi-task approach, and by combining them together, we can achieve better accuracy on both POS and parsing tasks."

We use a separate learning rate, moving average, and velocity for the tagger network and the parser; the PARSER updates all averages, velocities, and learning rates, while the TAGGER updates only the tagging factors. We tuned the hyperparameters of momentum rate µ, the initial learning rate η0 and the learning rate decay step γ using held-out data. The training data for parsing and tagging can be extracted from either the same corpus or different\ncorpora; in our experiments they were always the same.\nTo trade-off the two objectives, we used a random sampling scheme to perform 10 epochs of PARSER updates and 5 epochs of TAGGER updates. In our experiments, we found that pretraining with TAGGER updates for one epoch before interleaving PARSER updates yielded faster training with better results. We also experimented using the TAGGER updates solely for initializing the parser and found that interleaving updates was crucial to obtain improvements over the baseline."

      "text" : "We first investigated our model on 19 languages from the Universal Dependencies Treebanks v1.2.2 We selected the 19 largest currently spoken languages for which the full data was freely available. We used the coarse universal tagset in our experiments with no explicit morphological annotations. To measure parsing accuracy, we report unlabeled attachment score (UAS) and labeled attachment score (LAS) computed on all tokens (including punctuation), as is standard for non-English datasets.\nFor simplicity, we use the arc-standard (Nivre, 2004) transition system with greedy decoding. Because this transition system only produces projective trees, we first apply a projectivization step to all treebanks before unrolling the gold derivations during training. We make an exception for Dutch, where we observed a significant gain on development data by introducing the SWAP action (Nivre,\n2http://universaldependencies.org\n2009) and allowing non-projective trees. For models that required predicted POS tags, we trained a window-based tagger using the same features as the tagger component of our stacking model. We used 5-fold jackknifing to produce predicted tags on the training set. We found that the window-based tagger was comparable to a stateof-the-art CRF tagger for most languages. For every network we trained, we used the development data to evaluate a small range of hyperparameters, stopping training early when UAS no longer improved on the held-out data. We use H = 1024 hidden units in the parser, and H = 128 hidden units in the tagger. The parser embeds the tagger activations with D = 64. Note that following Ballesteros et al. (2015), we did not use any auxiliary data beyond that in the treebanks, such as pre-trained word embeddings.\nFor a final set of experiments, we evaluated on the standard Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993)), dependencies generated from version 3.3.0 of the Stanford converter (De Marneffe et al., 2006). We followed standard practice and used sections 2-21 for training, section 22 for development, and section 23 for testing. Following Weiss et al. (2015), we used section 24 to tune any hyperparameters of the model to avoid overfitting to the development set.

First, we compare the effectiveness of our learned continuous representations with those of Alberti et al. (2015), who use the predicted distribution over\nPOS tags concatenated with word embeddings as input to the parser. Because they also incorporate beam search into training, we re-implement a greedy version of their method to allow for direct comparisons of token representations. We refer to this as the “Pipeline (Ptag)” baseline. Second, we also compare our architecture trained without POS tags as regularization, which we refer to as “Ours (window-based)”. This model has the same architecture as our full model but with no POS supervision and updates. Since this model never observes POS tags in any way, we compare against a recurrent character-based parser (Ballesteros et al., 2015) which is state-of-the-art when no POS tags are provided.3 Finally, we compare to RGBParser (Lei et al., 2014), a state-of-the art graph-based (non-greedy) approach.\nOur greedy stackprop model outperforms all other methods, including the graph-based RBGParser, by a significant margin on the test set (78.9% vs 77.6%). This is despite the limitations of greedy parsing. Stackprop also yields a 2.3% absolute improvement in accuracy compared to using POS tag confidences as features (Pipeline Ptag).

      "text" : "Stackprop vs. other representations. One unexpected result was that, even without the POS tag labels at training time, our stackprop architecture achieves better accuracy than either the character-based LSTM or the pipelined baselines (Table 2). This suggests that adding windowbased representations–which aggregate over many features of the word and surrounding context– is more effective than increasing the expressiveness of individual word representations by using character-based recurrent models. In future work we will explore combining these two complementary approaches.\nWe hypothesized that stackprop might provide larger gains over the pipelined model when the POS tags are very coarse. We tested this latter hypothesis on the WSJ corpus by training our model using the coarse universal tagsets instead of the fine tagset (Table 3). We found that stackprop achieves similar accuracy using coarse tagsets as the fine tagset, while the pipelined baseline’s performance drops dramatically. And while stackprop doesn’t achieve the highest reported accuracies on the WSJ, it does achieve competitive accuracies and outperforms prior state-of-the-art for greedy methods (Dyer et al., 2015).\nStackprop vs. joint modeling. An alternative to stackprop would be to train the final layer of our architecture to predict both POS tags and dependency arcs. To evaluate this, we trained our window-based architecture with the integrated\ntransition system of Bohnet and Nivre (2012), which augments the SHIFT transition to predict POS tags. Note that if we also apply stackprop, the network learns from POS annotations twice: once in the TAGGER updates, and again the PARSER updates. We therefore evaluated our window-based model both with and without stack-propagation, and with and without the joint transition system.\nWe compare these variants along with our reimplementation of the pipelined model of Alberti et al. (2015) in Table 4. We find that stackprop is always better, even when it leads to “double counting” the POS annotations; in this case, the result is a model that is significantly better at POS tagging while marginally worse at parsing than stackprop alone.\nReducing cascaded errors. As expected, we observe a significant reduction in cascaded POS tagging errors. An example from the English UD treebank is given in Figure 5. Across the 19 languages in our test set, we observed a 10.9% gain (34.1% vs. 45.0%) in LAS on tokens where the pipelined POS tagger makes a mistake, compared to a 1.8% gain on the rest of the corpora.\nDecreased model size. Previous neural parsers that use POS tags require learning embeddings for words and other features on top of the parameters used in the POS tagger (Chen and Manning, 2014; Weiss et al., 2015). In contrast, the parameters for our parser are essentially free given the POS tagger. In practice, most of the memory of the parsing model is contained in the word embeddings matrix, so we halve the memory footprint of the parser. Compared to our implementation of the pipeline model, we observed that this more compact parser model was also roughly twice as fast.\nContextual embeddings. Finally, we also explored the significance of the representations learned by the tagger. Unlike word embedding models, the representations used in our parser are\nHeterosexuals increasingly back gay marriage root advmod advmod amod dobj\nconstructed for each token based on its surrounding context. We demonstrate a few interesting trends we observed in Table 5, where we show the nearest neighbors to sample tokens in this contextual embedding space. These representations tend to represent syntactic patterns rather than individual words, distinguishing between the form (e.g. “judge” as a noun vs. a verb’) and context of tokens (e.g. preceded by a personal pronoun)."

We demonstrate that a better approach is to utilize POS tags as a regularizer of learned representations. We propose a simple method for learning a stacked pipeline of models which we call “stack-propagation.” We apply this to dependency parsing and tagging, where we use the hidden layer of the tagger network as a representation of the input tokens for the parser. At test time, our parser does not require predicted POS tags. On 19 languages from the Universal Dependencies, our method is 1.3% (absolute) more accurate than a state-of-the-art graph-based approach and 2.7% more accurate than the most comparable greedy model.",
