{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Machine Comprehension Using Match-LSTM and Answer Pointer", "abstract": "Machine comprehension of text is an important problem in natural language processing. A recently released dataset, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), offers a large number of real questions and their answers created by humans through crowdsourcing. SQuAD provides a challenging testbed for evaluating machine comprehension algorithms, partly because compared with previous datasets, in SQuAD the answers do not come from a small set of candidate answers and they have variable lengths. We propose an end-to-end neural architecture for the task. The architecture is based on match-LSTM, a model we proposed previously for textual entailment, and Pointer Net, a sequence-to-sequence model proposed by Vinyals et al. (2015) to constrain the output tokens to be from the input sequences. We propose two ways of using Pointer Net for our tasks. Our experiments show that both of our two models substantially outperform the best results obtained by Rajpurkar et al. (2016) using logistic regression and manually crafted features. Besides, our boundary model also achieves the best performance on the MSMARCO dataset (Nguyen et al. 2016).", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "SUMMARY.\nThis paper proposes a new neural network architectures for solving the task of reading comprehension question answering where the goal is answering a questions regarding a given text passage.\nThe proposed model combines two well-know neural network architectures match-lstm and pointer nets.\nFirst the passage and the questions are encoded with a unidirectional LSTM.\nThen the encoded words in the passage and the encoded words in the questions are combined with an attention mechanism so that each word of the passage has a certain degree of compatibility with the question.\nFor each word in the passage the word representation and the weighted representation of the query is concatenated and passed to an forward lstm.\nThe same process is done in the opposite direction with a backward lstm.\nThe final representation is a concatenation of the two lstms.\nAs a decoded a pointer network is used.\nThe authors tried with two approaches: generating the answer word by word, and generating the first index and the last index of the answer.\n\nThe proposed model is tested on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset.\nAn ensemble of the proposed model achieves performance close to state-of-the-art models.\n\n\n----------\n\nOVERALL JUDGMENT\n\nI think the model is interesting mainly because of the use of pointer networks as a decoder.\nOne thing that the authors could have tried is a multi-hop approach.

For this the paper proposes to combine two existing works: Match-LSTM to relate question and text representations and Pointer Net to predict the location of the answer in the text.\n\nStrength:\n-\tThe suggested approach makes sense for the task and achieves good performance, (although as the authors mention, recent concurrent works achieve better results)\n-\tThe paper is evaluated on the SQuAD dataset and achieves significant improvements over prior work.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n1.\tIt is unclear from the paper how well it is applicable to other problem scenarios where the answer is not a subset of the input text.\n2.\tExperimental evaluation\n2.1.\tIt is not clear why the Bi-Ans-Ptr in Table 2 is not used for the ensemble although it achieves the best performance.\n2.2.\tIt would be interested if this approach generalizes to other datasets.\n\n\nOther (minor/discussion points)\n-\tThe task and approach seem to have some similarity of locating queries in images and visual question answering.

The proposed model is based on two previous works -- match-LSTM and Pointer Net. Match-LSTM produces attention over each word in the given question for each word in the given passage, and sequentially aggregates this matching of each word in the passage with the words in the question. The pointer net is used to generate the answer by either generating each word in the answer or by predicting the starting and ending tokens in the answer from the provided passage. The experimental results show that both the variants of the proposed model outperform the baseline presented in the SQuAD paper. The paper also shows some analysis of the results obtained such as variation of performance across answer lengths and question types.\n\nStrengths:\n1. A novel end-to-end model for the task of machine comprehension rather than using hand-crafted features.\n2. Significant performance boost over the baseline presented in the SQuAD paper.\n3. Some insightful analyses of the results such as performance is better when answers are short, \"why\" questions are difficult to answer.\n\nWeaknesses/Questions/Suggestions:\n1. The paper does not show quantitatively how much modelling attention in match-LSTM and answer pointer layer helps. So, it would be insightful if authors could compare the model performance with and without attention in match-LSTM, and with and without attention in answer pointer layer.\n2. It would be good if the paper could provide some insights into why there is a huge performance gap between boundary model and sequence model in the answer pointer layer.\n3. I would like to see the variation in the performance of the proposed model for questions that require different types of reasoning (table 3 in SQuAD paper). This would provide insights into what are the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model w.r.t the type reasoning required.\n4. Could authors please explain why the activations resulting from {h^p}_i and {h^r}_{i-1} in G_i in equation 2 are being repeated across dimension of Q. Why not learn different activations for each dimension? \n5. I wonder why Bi-Ans-Ptr is not used in the ensemble model (last row in table 2) when it is shown that Bi-Ans-Ptr improves performance by 1.2% in F1.\n6. Could authors please discuss and compare the DCR model (in table 2) in the paper in more detail?\n\nReview Summary: The paper presents a reasonable end-to-end model for the task of machine comprehension on the SQuAD dataset, which outperforms the baseline model significantly. However, it would be good if more analyses / ablation studies / insights are included regarding -- how much attention helps, why is boundary model better than sequence model, how does the performance change when the reasoning required becomes difficult.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 7, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016 (modified: 20 Jan 2017)", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 3}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "No Title", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "SUMMARY.\nThis paper proposes a new neural network architectures for solving the task of reading comprehension question answering where the goal is answering a questions regarding a given text passage.\nThe proposed model combines two well-know neural network architectures match-lstm and pointer nets.\nFirst the passage and the questions are encoded with a unidirectional LSTM.\nThen the encoded words in the passage and the encoded words in the questions are combined with an attention mechanism so that each word of the passage has a certain degree of compatibility with the question.\nFor each word in the passage the word representation and the weighted representation of the query is concatenated and passed to an forward lstm.\nThe same process is done in the opposite direction with a backward lstm.\nThe final representation is a concatenation of the two lstms.\nAs a decoded a pointer network is used.\nThe authors tried with two approaches: generating the answer word by word, and generating the first index and the last index of the answer.\n\nThe proposed model is tested on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset.\nAn ensemble of the proposed model achieves performance close to state-of-the-art models.\n\n\n----------\n\nOVERALL JUDGMENT\n\nI think the model is interesting mainly because of the use of pointer networks as a decoder.\nOne thing that the authors could have tried is a multi-hop approach.
