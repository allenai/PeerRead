      "text" : "Geolocation of social media users is essential in applications ranging from rapid disaster response (Earle et al., 2010; Ashktorab et al., 2014; Morstatter et al., 2013a) and opinion analysis (Mostafa, 2013; Kirilenko and Stepchenkova, 2014), to recommender systems (Noulas et al., 2012; Schedl and Schnitzer, 2014). Social media platforms like Twitter provide support for users to declare their location manually in their text profile or automatically with GPS-based geotagging. However, the text-based profile locations are noisy and only 1–3% of tweets are geotagged (Cheng et al., 2010; Morstatter et al., 2013b), meaning that geolocation needs to be inferred from other information sources such as the tweet text and network relationships.\nUser geolocation is the task of inferring the primary (or “home”) location of a user from available sources of information, such as text posted by that individual, or network relationships with other individuals (Han et al., 2014). Geolocation models are usually trained on the small set of users whose location is known (e.g. through GPS-based geotagging), and other users are geolocated using the resulting model. These models broadly fall into two categories: text-based and network-based methods. Orthogonally, the geolocation task can be viewed as a regression task over real-valued geographical coordinates, or a classification task over discretised region-based locations.\nMost previous research on user geolocation has focused either on text-based classification approaches (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Roller et al., 2012; Han et al., 2014) or, to a lesser extent, network-based regression approaches (Jurgens, 2013; Compton et al., 2014; Rahimi et al., 2015). Methods which combine the two, however, are rare.\nIn this paper, we present our work on Twitter user geolocation using both text and network information. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the use of Modified Adsorption (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) as a baseline network-based geolocation model, and show that it outperforms previous network-based approaches (Jurgens, 2013; Rahimi et al., 2015); (2) we demonstrate that removing “celebrity” nodes (nodes with high indegrees) from the network increases geolocation accuracy and dramatically decreases network edge size; and (3) we integrate text-based geolocation priors into Modified Adsorption, and show that our unified geolocation model outperforms both text-only and network-only approaches, and achieves state-of-the-art results over three standard datasets."

      "text" : "A recent spike in interest on user geolocation over social media data has resulted in the development of a range of approaches to automatic geolocation prediction, based on information sources such as the text of messages, social networks, user profile data, and temporal data. Text-based methods model the geographical bias of language use in social media, and use it to geolocate non-geotagged users. Gazetted expressions (Leidner and Lieberman, 2011) and geographical names (Quercini et al., 2010) were used as feature in early work, but were shown to be sparse in coverage. Han et al. (2014) used information-theoretic methods to automatically extract location-indicative words for location classification. Wing and Baldridge (2014) reported that discriminative approaches (based on hierar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n08 25\n9v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n2 Se\np 20\n15\narchical classification over adaptive grids), when optimised properly, are superior to explicit feature selection. Cha et al. (2015) showed that sparse coding can be used to effectively learn a latent representation of tweet text to use in user geolocation. Eisenstein et al. (2010) and Ahmed et al. (2013) proposed topic model-based approaches to geolocation, based on the assumption that words are generated from hidden topics and geographical regions. Similarly, Yuan et al. (2013) used graphical models to jointly learn spatio-temporal topics for users. The advantage of these generative approaches is that they are able to work with the continuous geographical space directly without any pre-discretisation, but they are algorithmically complex and don’t scale well to larger datasets. Hulden et al. (2015) used kernel-based methods to smooth linguistic features over very small grid sizes to alleviate data sparseness.\nNetwork-based geolocation models, on the other hand, utilise the fact that social media users interact more with people who live nearby. Jurgens (2013) and Compton et al. (2014) used a Twitter reciprocal mention network, and geolocated users based on the geographical coordinates of their friends, by minimising the weighted distance of a given user to their friends. For a reciprocal mention network to be effective, however, a huge amount of Twitter data is required. Rahimi et al. (2015) showed that this assumption could be relaxed to use an undirected mention network for smaller datasets, and still attain state-of-the-art results. The greatest shortcoming of network-based models is that they completely fail to geolocate users who are not connected to geolocated components of the graph. As shown by Rahimi et al. (2015), geolocation predictions from text can be used as a backoff for disconnected users, but there has been little work that has investigated a more integrated text- and network-based approach to user geolocation."

      "text" : "We evaluate our models over three pre-existing geotagged Twitter datasets: (1) GEOTEXT (Eisenstein et al., 2010), (2) TWITTER-US (Roller et al., 2012), and (3) TWITTER-WORLD (Han et al., 2012). In each dataset, users are represented by a single meta-document, generated by concatenating their tweets. The datasets are pre-partitioned into training, development and test sets, and rebuilt from the original version to include mention information. The first two datasets were constructed to contain mostly English messages.\nGEOTEXT consists of tweets from 9.5K users: 1895\nusers are held out for each of development and test data. The primary location of each user is set to the coordinates of their first tweet.\nTWITTER-US consists of 449K users, of which 10K users are held out for each of development and test data. The primary location of each user is, once again, set to the coordinates of their first tweet.\nTWITTER-WORLD consists of 1.3M users, of which 10000 each are held out for development and test. Unlike the other two datasets, the primary location of users is mapped to the geographic centre of the city where the majority of their tweets were posted."

      "text" : "We use label propagation over an @-mention graph in our models. We use k-d tree descretised adaptive grids as class labels for users and learn a label distribution for each user by label propagation over the @-mention network using labelled nodes as seeds. For k-d tree discretisation, we set the number of users in each region to 50, 2400, 2400 for GEOTEXT, TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD respectively, based on tuning over the development data.\nSocial Network: We used the @-mention information to build an undirected graph between users. In order to make the inference more tractable, we removed all nodes that were not a member of the training/test set, and connected all pairings of training/test users if there was any path between them (including paths through non training/test users). We call this network a “collapsed network”, as illustrated in Figure 1. Note that a celebrity node with nmentions connects n(n−1) nodes in the collapsed network. We experiment with both binary and weighted edge (based on the number of mentions connecting the given users) networks.\nBaseline: Our baseline geolocation model (“MAD-B”) is formulated as label propagation over a binary collapsed network, based on Modified Adsorption (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009). It applies to a graph G = (V,E,W ) where V is the set of nodes with |V | = n = nl + nu (where nl nodes are labelled and nu nodes are unlabelled), E is the set of edges, and W is an edge weight matrix. Assume C is the set of labels where |C| = m is the total number of labels. Y is an n ×m matrix storing the training node labels, and Ŷ is the estimated label distribution for the nodes. The goal is to estimate Ŷ for all nodes (including training nodes) so\nthat the following objective function is minimised:\nC(Ŷ ) = ∑ l [ µ1(Yl − Ŷl)TS(Yl − Ŷl)+\nµ2Ŷ T l LŶl ] where µ1 and µ2 are hyperparameters;1 L is the Laplacian of an undirected graph derived from G; and S is a diagonal binary matrix indicating if a node is labelled or not. The first term of the equation forces the labelled nodes to keep their label (prior term), while the second term pulls a node’s label toward that of its neighbours (smoothness term). For the first term, the label confidence for training and test users is set to 1.0 and 0.0, respectively. Based on the development data, we set µ1 and µ2 to 1.0 and 0.1, respectively, for all the experiments. For TWITTER-US and TWITTERWORLD, the inference was intractable for the default network, as it was too large.\nThere are two immediate issues with the baseline graph propagation method: (1) it doesn’t scale to large datasets with high edge counts, related to which, it tends to be biased by highly-connected nodes; and (2) it can’t predict the geolocation of test users who aren’t connected to any training user (MAD-B returns Unknown,\n1In the base formulation of MAD-B, there is also a regularisation term with weight µ3, but in all our experiments, we found that the best results were achieved over development data with µ3 = 0, i.e. with no regularisation; the term is thus omitted from our description.\nwhich we rewrite with the centre of the map). We redress these two issues as follows.\nCelebrity Removal To address the first issue, we target “celebrity” users, i.e. highly-mentioned Twitter users. Edges involving these users often carry little or no geolocation information (e.g. the majority of people who mention Barack Obama don’t live in Washington D.C.). Additionally, these users tend to be highly connected to other users and generate a disproportionately high number of edges in the graph, leading in large part to the baseline MAD-B not scaling over large datasets such as TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD. We identify and filter out celebrity nodes simply by assuming that a celebrity is mentioned by more than T users, where T is tuned over development data. Based on tuning over the development set of GEOTEXT and TWITTER-US, T was set to 5 and 15 respectively. For TWITTER-WORLD tuning was very resource intensive so T was set to 5 based on GEOTEXT, to make the inference faster. Celebrity removal dramatically reduced the edge count in all three datasets (from 1× 109 to 5 × 106 for TWITTER-US and from 4 × 1010 to 1 × 107 for TWITTER-WORLD), and made inference tractable for TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD. Jurgens et al. (2015) report that the time complexity of most network-based geolocation methods is O(k2) for each node where k is the average number of vertex neighbours. In the case of the collapsed network of TWITTER-WORLD, k is decreased by a factor of 4000 after setting the celebrity threshold T to 5. We apply\n2 5 15 50 500 5k Celebrity threshold T (# of mentions)\n700\n720\n740\n760\n780\n800\n820\n840\n860\nM e a n e\nrr o r\n(i n k\nm )\nMean error Graph size\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\nG ra\np h s\niz e (\n# e\nd g e s)\nFigure 2: Effect of celebrity removal on geolocation performance and graph size. For each T performance is measured over the development set of TWITTER-US by MADCEL-W.\ncelebrity removal over both binary (“MADCEL-B”) and weighted (“MADCEL-W”) networks (using the respective T for each dataset). The effect of celebrity removal over the development set of TWITTER-US is shown in Figure 2 where it dramatically reduces the graph edge size and simultaneously leads to an improvement in the mean error.\nA Unified Geolocation Model To address the issue of disconnected test users, we incorporate text information into the model by attaching a labelled dongle node to every test node (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002; Goldberg and Zhu, 2006). The label for the dongle node is based on a text-based l1 regularised logistic regression model, using the method of Rahimi et al. (2015). The dongle nodes with their corresponding label confidences are added to the seed set, and are treated in the same way as other labelled nodes (i.e. the training nodes). Once again, we experiment with text-based labelled dongle nodes over both binary (“MADCEL-B-LR”) and weighted (“MADCEL-W-LR”) networks."

Note that higher numbers are better for Acc@161, but lower numbers are better for mean and median error, with a lower bound of 0 and no (theoretical) upper bound.\nTo generate a continuous-valued latitude/longitude coordinate for a given user from the k-d tree cell, we use the median coordinates of all training points in the predicted region."

The results are also compared with prior work on network-based geolocation using label propagation (LP) (Rahimi et al., 2015), text-based classification models (Han et al., 2012; Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Wing and Baldridge, 2014; Rahimi et al., 2015; Cha et al., 2015), text-based graphical models (Ahmed et al., 2013), and network–text hybrid models (LP-LR) (Rahimi et al., 2015).\nOur baseline network-based model of MAD-B outperforms the text-based models and also previous networkbased models (Jurgens, 2013; Compton et al., 2014; Rahimi et al., 2015). The inference, however, is intractable for TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD due to the size of the network.\nCelebrity removal in MADCEL-B and MADCEL-W has a positive effect on geolocation accuracy, and results in a 47% reduction in Median over GEOTEXT. It also makes graph inference over TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD tractable, and results in superior Acc@161 and Median, but slightly inferior Mean, compared to the state-of-the-art results of LR, based on text-based classification (Rahimi et al., 2015). MADCEL-W (weighted graph) outperforms MADCEL-B (binary graph) over the smaller GEOTEXT dataset where it compensates for the sparsity of network information, but doesn’t improve the results for the two larger datasets where network information is denser.\nAdding text to the network-based geolocation models in the form of MADCEL-B-LR (binary edges) and MADCEL-W-LR (weighted edges), we achieve stateof-the-art results over all three datasets. The inclusion of text-based priors has the greatest impact on Mean, resulting in an additional 26% and 23% error reduction over TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD, respectively. The reason for this is that it provides a userspecific geolocation prior for (relatively) disconnected users."

Experiments over three Twitter benchmark datasets achieve state-of-the-art results, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhancements.",
