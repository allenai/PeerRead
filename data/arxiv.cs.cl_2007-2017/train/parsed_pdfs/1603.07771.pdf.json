      "text" : "1 Introduction\nConcept-to-text generation addresses the problem of rendering structured records into natural language (Reiter et al., 2000). A typical application is to generate a weather forecast based on a set of structured records of meteorological measurements. In contrast to previous work, we scale to the large and very diverse problem of generating biographies for personalities based on Wikipedia infoboxes. An infobox is a fact table describing a person, similar to a person subgraph in a knowledge base (Bollacker et al., 2008; Ferrucci, 2012). Similar generation applications include the generation of product descriptions based on a catalog of millions of items with dozens of attributes each.\nPrevious work experimented with datasets that\ncontain only a few tens of thousands of records such as Weathergov or the Robocup dataset, while our dataset contains over 700k biographies from Wikipedia. Furthermore, these datasets have a limited vocabulary of only about 350 words each, compared to over 400k words in our dataset.\nTo tackle this problem we introduce a statistical generation model conditioned on a Wikipedia infobox. We focus on the generation of the first sentence of a biography which requires the model to select among a large number of possible fields to generate an adequate output. Such diversity makes it difficult for classical count-based models to estimate probabilities of rare events due to data sparsity. We address this issue by parameterizing words and fields as vectors (embeddings), along with a neural language model operating on these embeddings (Bengio et al., 2003). This factorization allows us to scale to a large number of words and fields compared to Liang et al. (2009) and Kim and Mooney (2010) where the number of parameters grows as the product of the number of words and fields.\nMoreover, our approach does not restrict the relations between the field contents and the generated text. This contrasts with less flexible strategies that assume the generation to follow either a hybrid alignment tree (Kim and Mooney, 2010), a probabilistic context-free grammar (Konstas and Lapata, 2013), or a tree adjoining grammar (Gyawali and Gardent, 2014).\nOur model exploits structured data both globally and locally. Global conditioning summarizes all information about a personality to understand high-level themes such as that the biography is about a scientist or an artist, while as local conditioning describes the previously generated tokens in terms of the their relationship to the infobox. We analyze the effectiveness of each and demonstrate their complementarity.\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n07 77\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 M\nar 2\n01 6"

      "text" : "Traditionally, generation systems relied on rules and hand-crafted specifications (Dale et al., 2003; Reiter et al., 2005; Green, 2006; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2007; Turner et al., 2010). Generation is divided into modular, yet highly interdependent, decisions: (1) content planning defines which parts of the input fields or meaning representations should be selected; (2) sentence planning determines which selected fields are to be dealt with in each output sentence; and (3) surface realization generates those sentences.\nData-driven approaches have been proposed to automatically learn the individual modules. One approach first aligns records and sentences and then learns a content selection model (Duboue and McKeown, 2002; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005). Hierarchical hidden semi-Markov generative models have also been used to first determine which facts to discuss and then to generate words from the predicates and arguments of the chosen facts (Liang et al., 2009). Sentence planning has been formulated as a supervised set partitioning problem over facts where each partition corresponds to a sentence (Barzilay and Lapata, 2006). End-to-end approaches have combined sentence planning and surface realization by using explicitly aligned sentence/meaning pairs as training data (Ratnaparkhi, 2002; Wong and Mooney, 2007; Belz, 2008; Lu and Ng, 2011). More recently, content selection and surface realization have been combined (Angeli et al., 2010; Kim and Mooney, 2010; Konstas and Lapata, 2013).\nOur approach is inspired by the recent success of neural language models for image captioning (Kiros et al., 2014; Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015; Vinyals et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015), machine translation (Devlin et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015), and modeling conversations and dialogues (Shang et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2015; Yao et al., 2015).\nOur model is most similar to Mei et al. (2016) who use an encoder-decoder style neural network model to tackle the Weathergov and Robocup tasks. Their architecture relies on LSTM units and an attention mechanism which reduces scalability compared to our simpler design."

      "heading" : "3.2 Language Model Conditioned on Tables",
      "text" : "As seen in Figure 1, a table consists of a set of field/value pairs, where values are sequences of\nwords. We therefore propose language models that are conditioned on these pairs.\nLocal conditioning. The table allows us to describe each word not only by its string (or index in the vocabulary) but also by a descriptor of its occurrence in the table. Let F define the set of all possible fields f . The occurrence of a word w in the table is described by a set of (field, position) pairs.\nzw = { (fi, pi) }m i=1 , (3)\nwhere m is the number of occurrences of w. Each pair (f, p) indicates that w occurs in field f at position p. In this scheme, most words are described by the empty set as they do not occur in the table. For example, the word linguistics in the table of Figure 1 is described as follows:\nzlinguistics = {(fields, 8); (known for, 4)}, (4)\nassuming words are lower-cased and commas are treated as separate tokens.\nConditioning both on the field type and the position within the field allows the model to encode field-specific regularities, e.g., a number token in a date field is likely followed by a month token; knowing that the number is the first token in the date field makes this even more likely.\nThe (field, position) description scheme of the table does not allow to express that a token terminates a field which can be useful to capture field transitions. For biographies, the last token of the name field is often followed by an introduction of the birth date like ‘(’ or ‘was born’. We hence extend our descriptor to a triplet that includes the position of the token counted from the end of the field:\nzw = { (fi, p + i , p − i ) }m i=1 , (5)\nwhere our example becomes:\nzlinguistics = {(fields, 8, 4); (known for, 4, 13)}.\nWe extend Equation 2 to use the above information as additional conditioning context when generating a sentence s:\nP (s|z) = T∏\nt=1\nP (wt|ct, zct) , (6)\nwhere zct = zwt−(n−1) , . . . , zwt−1 are referred to as the local conditioning variables since they describe the local context (previous word) relations with the table.\nGlobal conditioning The set of fields available in a table often impacts the structure of the generation. For biographies, the fields used to describe a politician are different from the ones for an actor or an athlete. Knowing which fields are available in the table provides type information and helps to determine which fields should be mentioned, both of which greatly influence sentence structure. We introduce global conditioning on the fields gf as\nP (s|z, gf ) = T∏\nt=1\nP (wt|ct, zct , gf ). (7)\nSimilarly, global conditioning gw on the words occurring in the table is introduced:\nP (s|z, gf , gw) = T∏\nt=1\nP (wt|ct, zct , gf , gw). (8)\nWords provide information complementary to fields. For example, it may be hard to distinguish a basketball player from a hockey player by looking only at the field names, e.g. teams, league, position, weight and height, etc. However the actual field values such as team names, league name, player’s position can help the model to give a better prediction. Here, gf ∈ {0, 1}F and gw ∈ {0, 1}W are binary indicators over fixed field and word vocabularies."

      "text" : "So far we extended the model conditioning by features derived from the fact table. We now turn to using table information when scoring output words. In particular, knowing that a word appears in the table is valuable when considering to generate this word as output. Moreover, sentences which express facts from a given table often copy words from the table. We therefore extend our language model to predict special field tokens such as name 1 or name 2 which are subsequently replaced by the corresponding words from the table; we only include field tokens if the field token is actually in the table.\nOur model reads a table and defines an output domain W ∪ Q of vocabulary words W as well as all tokens in the table Q. This allows the generation of words which are not in the vocabulary. For instance Park-Rhodes in Figure 1 is unlikely to be part of W . However, Park-Rhodes will be included inQ as name 2 (since it is the second token\nof the name field) which allows our model to generate it. Often, the output space of each decision Q∪W is larger thanW ."

      "heading" : "4.1 Embeddings as inputs",
      "text" : "A key aspect of neural language models is the use of word embeddings as inputs. Similar words have generally similar embeddings since they share latent features. Because the probability estimates are smooth functions of the continuous word embeddings, a small change in the features results in a small change in the probability estimates (Bengio et al., 2003). Therefore, the neural language model can achieve better generalization for unseen n-grams. Just as the discrete feature representations of words are mapped into continuous word embeddings, the discrete feature representations of tables can be mapped into continuous vector space.\nWord embeddings. Formally, the input layer maps each context word index to a continuous ddimensional vector. It relies on a parameter matrix W ∈ R|W|×d to convert the input ct into n−1 vectors of dimension d:\nct = [ Wt−(n−1); . . . ;Wt−1 ] ∈ R(n−1)×d (10)\nW can be initialized randomly or with pre-trained word embeddings.\nTable embeddings. As described in Section 3.2, the language model is conditioned on elements from the table. Embedding matrices are therefore defined to model both local and global conditioning information. For local conditioning, we denote the maximum length of a sequence of words as l. Each field fj ∈ F is associated with 2× l vectors of d dimensions, the first l of those vectors embed\nall possible starting positions 1, . . . , l, and the remaining l vectors embed ending positions. This results in a parameter matrix Z ∈ R|F|×(2×l)×d. For a given triplet (fj , p+i , p − i ), Zj,p+i and Zj,p−i refer to the embedding vectors of the start and end position for field fj , respectively.\nFinally, global conditioning uses two parameter matrices Gf ∈ R|F|×g and Gw ∈ R|W|×g. Each row Gfj maps a table field fj into a vector of dimension g, while each row Gwt maps a word wt into a vector of the same dimension. In general, Gw shares its parameters withW , provided d = g.\nAggregating embeddings. We represent each occurence of a wordw as a triplet (field, start, end) where we have embeddings for the start and end position as described above. Often times a particular word w occurs multiple times in a table, e.g., ‘linguistics’ has two instances in Figure 1. In this case, we perform a component-wise max over the start embeddings of all instances of w to obtain the best features across all occurrences of w. We do the same for end position embeddings:\nzwt =\n[ max{Zj,p+i ,∀(fj , p + i , p − i ) ∈ zwt};\nmax{Zj,p−i ,∀(fj , p + i , p − i ) ∈ zwt} ] (11)\nNote that a special no-field embedding is assigned to wt when the word is not associated with any fields.\nFor global conditioning, we define Fq ⊂ F as the set of all the fields in a given table q, and Q as the set of all words in q. We also perform max aggregation. This yields the vectors\ngf = max{Gf , ∀f ∈ Fq} , (12)\nand gw = max{Gw, ∀w ∈ Q} . (13)\nThe final context input is then the concatenation of these vectors:\nxct = [ ct; zct ; gf ; gw ] ∈ Rd1 , (14)\nwith d1 = (n− 1)× (3× d) + (2× g). This input is mapped to a latent context representation using a linear operation followed by a hyperbolic tangent.\nhct = tanh(W 1xct + b 1)."

Similarly, early stopping is applied: training ends when BLEU stops improving on the same validation subset.

We first discuss models without copy actions (the first three results) and then discuss models with copy actions (the remaining results). Note that the factorization of our models results in three different output domains which makes perplexity comparisons less straightforward: First, models without copy actions use a fixed output vocabulary of size |W|. Second, the Table KN model (marked by ?) uses a fixed vocabulary of approximate size |F|∗l+|W|. Third, all other Table NLM models (marked by †) have the usual fixed output vocabulary plus a variable set Q which changes with each input table as described in Section 3.3.\nWithout copy actions. In terms of perplexity the (i) neural language model (NLM) is slightly better than an interpolated KN language model, and (ii) adding local conditioning on the field start and end position further improves performance. BLEU over the model generations is generally very low but there is a clear improvement when using local conditioning because it allows learning transitions between fields and links past model predictions to the table unlike KN or plain NLM.\nWith copy actions. For experiments with copy actions we use the full local conditioning (Equation 4) in the neural language models. Perplexity can only be compared between variants of Table NLM models as described above and improvements are less clear when adding features in terms of this measure. However, BLEU clearly improves when moving from Table KN to Table NLM and more features successively improve accuracy. Global conditioning on the fields improves the model by over 7 BLEU and adding words gives 1.3 points. This is a total improvement of nearly 15 BLEU over the Table Kneser-Ney baseline."

The model correctly uses the past tense since the death date in the table indicates that the person has passed away.

Furthermore, the current training loss function does not explicitly penalize the model from generating incorrect facts, e.g. predicting the wrong nationality or a wrong occupation is not currently considered worse than choosing the wrong determiner. A loss function that could assess factual accuracy would certainly improve sentence generation by avoiding such mistakes."

We experiment with a new dataset of biographies from Wikipedia that is an order of magnitude larger than existing resources with over 700k samples. The dataset is also vastly more diverse with a 400k vocabulary, compared to a few hundred words for Weathergov or Robocup. Our model builds upon recent work on conditional neural language model for text generation. To deal with the large vocabulary, we extend these models to mix a fixed vocabulary with copy actions that transfer sample-specific words from the input database to the generated output sentence. Our neural model significantly outperforms a classical Kneser-Ney language model adapted to this task by nearly 15 BLEU.",
