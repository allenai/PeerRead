      "text" : "Many recent advances in deep learning have come from increased model capacity and associated computation. This often involves using larger and deeper networks that are tuned with extensive hyper-parameter settings. The growing model sizes and hyper-parameters, however, have greatly increased the training time. For instance, training a state-of-the-art translation or speech recognition system would take several days to complete (Vaswani et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016b; Sak et al., 2014). Apparently, computation has become a major bottleneck for deep learning research.\nTo counter the dramatically increased computation, parallelization such as GPU-accelerated training has been predominately adopted to scale deep learning (Diamos et al., 2016; Goyal et al., 2017). While operations such as convolution and attention are well-suited for multi-threaded / GPU computation, recurrent neural nets, however, remain less amenable to parallelization. In a typical implementation, the computation of output state ht is suspended until the entire computation of ht−1 completes. This constraint impedes independent computation and largely slows down sequence processing. Figure 1 illustrates the processing time of cuDNN-optimized LSTMs (Appleyard et al., 2016) and word-level convolutions using conv2d. The difference is quite significant – even the very optimized LSTM implementation performs over 10x slower.\nIn this work, we introduce the Simple Recurrent Unit (SRU) which operates significantly faster than existing recurrent implementations. The recurrent unit simplifies state computation and hence exposes the same parallelism as CNNs, attention and feed-forward nets. Specifically, while the update of internal state ct still makes use of the previous state ct−1, the dependence on ht−1 in a recurrence step has been dropped. As a result, all matrix multiplications (i.e. gemm) and element-wise operations in the recurrent unit can be easily parallelized across different dimensions and steps. Similar to the implementation of cuDNN LSTM and conv2d, we perform CUDA-level optimizations for SRU by compiling all element-wise operations into a single kernel function call. As shown in Figure 1, our implementation achieves the same speed of its conv2d counterpart.\nOf course, an alternative implementation that fails to deliver comparable or better accuracy would have no applicability. To this end, we evaluate SRU on a wide range of applications including classifi-\n1https://github.com/taolei87/sru\nar X\niv :1\n70 9.\n02 75\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nS ep\n2 01\n7\ncation, question answering, language modeling, translation and speech recognition. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of SRU – it achieves better performance compared to recurrent (or convolutional) baseline models across these tasks, while being able to train much faster."

      "text" : "Most top-performing recurrent neural networks such as long short-term memory (LSTMs) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and gated recurrent unit (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014) make use of neural gates to control the information flow and alleviate the gradient vanishing (or explosion) problem. Consider a typical implementation,\nct = ft ct−1 + it x̃t = ft ct−1 + (1− ft) x̃t\nwhere ft and it are sigmoid gates referred as the forget gate and input gate. x̃t is the transformed input at step t. We choose the coupled version it = 1 − ft here for simplicity. The computation of x̃t also varies in different RNN instances. We use the simplest version that performs a linear transformation over the input vector x̃t = Wxt (Lei et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017). Finally, the internal state ct is passed to an activation function g(·) to produce the output state ht = g(ct). We include two additional features in our implementation. First, we add skip connections between recurrent layers since they are shown quite effective for training deep networks (He et al., 2016; Srivastava et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016a). Specifically, we use highway connections (Srivastava et al., 2015) and the output state h′t is computed as,\nh′t = rt ht + (1− rt) xt (1) = rt g(ct) + (1− rt) xt (2)\nwhere rt is the output of a reset gate. Second, we implement variational dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016) in addition to the standard dropout for RNN regularization. Variational dropout uses a shared dropout mask across different time steps t. The mask is applied over input xt during every matrix multiplication in RNN (i.e., W · drop(xt)). Standard dropout is performed on ht before it is given to the highway connection."

      "text" : "Existing RNN implementations use the previous output state ht−1 in the recurrence computation. For instance, the forget vector would be computed by ft = σ(Wfxt +Rfht−1 + bf ). The inclusion of\nRht−1 breaks independence and parallelization: each dimension of the hidden state depends on the other, hence the computation of ht has to wait until the entire ht−1 is available.\nWe propose to completely drop the connection (between ht−1 and the neural gates of step t). The associated equations of SRU are given below,\nx̃t = Wxt (3) ft = σ(Wfxt + bf ) (4) rt = σ(Wrxt + br) (5) ct = ft ct−1 + (1− ft) x̃t (6) ht = rt g(ct) + (1− rt) xt (7)\nGiven a sequence of input vectors {x1, · · · ,xn}, {x̃t, ft, rt} for different t = 1 · · ·n are independent and hence all these vectors can be computed in parallel. Our formulation is similar to the recently proposed Quasi-RNN (Bradbury et al., 2017). While we drop ht−1 in the linear transformation terms of Eq (3) to (5), Quasi-RNN uses k-gram conv2d operations to substitute the linear terms. The computation bottleneck of our network is simply the three matrix multiplications in (3)∼(5). After computing x̃t, ft and rt, Eq (6) and (7) can be computed quite easily and fast since all operations are element-wise.\nOne open question is whether the simplification reduces the representational capability of the recurrent model. A theoretical analysis regarding the representational characteristics of (a broader class of) such recurrent architectures is presented in (Lei et al., 2017). In our experimental section, we empirically demonstrate that SRU can achieve the same or better performance by stacking the same number of or more layers. In fact, training a deeper network with SRU is much easier since each layer enjoys less computation and higher processing speed."

      "heading" : "2.3 CUDA level optimization",
      "text" : "A naive implementation of SRU in existing deep learning libraries can already achieve over 5x speed-up over the naive LSTM implementation. This is still sub-optimal since implementation on top of DL libraries introduces a lot of computation overhead such as data copy and kernel launching latencies. In contrast, convolution conv2d and cuDNN LSTM (Appleyard et al., 2016) have been optimized as CUDA kernel functions to accelerate their computation. To demonstrate the potential and compare with these implementations, we implement a version with CUDA-level optimizations in PyTorch.\nOptimizing SRU is similar to but much easier than the cuDNN LSTM (Appleyard et al., 2016). Our RNN formulation permits two optimizations that become possible for the first time in RNNs. First, the matrix multiplications across all time steps can be batched, which can significantly improve the computation intensity and hence GPU utilization. Second, all element-wise operations of the sequence can be fused (compiled) into one kernel function and be parallelized across hidden dimensions. Without the fusion, operations such as addition + and sigmoid activation σ() would invoke a separate function call. This brings additional kernel launching latency and also adds data moving cost.\nSpecifically, the matrix multiplications in Eq (3)∼(5) are grouped into one single multiplication, which can be formulated as,\nU> = ( W Wf Wr ) [x1,x2, · · · ,xn] (8)\nwhere U ∈ Rn×3d is the resulting matrix. When the input is a mini-batch of k sequences, U would be a tensor of size (n, k, 3d). We choose a length-major representation instead of a batch-major version here. The pseudocode of the fused kernel function is presented in Algorithm 1."

We minimize hyperparameter tuning and architecture engineering for a fair comparison with prior work, since such effort has a non-trivial impact on the results.

The word vectors are normalized to unit vectors and are fixed during training.\nSetup We train RNN encoders and use the last hidden state to predict the class label for a given input sentence. For most datasets, a 2-layer RNN encoder with 128 hidden dimensions suffices to produce good results. We experiment with 4-layer RNNs for SST dataset since the amount of annotation is an order of magnitude larger than other datasets. In addition, we train the same CNN model of (Kim, 2014) under our setting as a reference. We use the same filter widths and number of filters as (Kim, 2014).

We use the open source PyTorch re-implementation4 of the Document Reader model. Due to minor implementation differences, this version obtains 1% worse performance compared to the results reported in (Chen et al., 2017) when using the same training options. Following the suggestions of the authors, we use a smaller learning rate (0.001 instead of 0.002 for Adamax optimizer) and re-tune the dropout rates of word embeddings and RNNs.

The processed data along with train, dev and test splits are taken from (Mikolov et al., 2010), which contains about 1 million tokens with a truncated vocabulary of 10k. Following standard practice, the training data is treated as a long sequence (split into a few chunks for mini-batch training), and hence the models are trained using truncated back-propagation-through-time (BPTT).\nSetup Our training configuration largely follows prior work (Zaremba et al., 2014; Gal and Ghahramani, 2016; Zoph and Le, 2016). We use a batch size of 32 and truncated back-propagation with 35 steps. The dropout probability is 0.75 for the input embedding and output softmax layer. The standard dropout and variational dropout probability is 0.2 for stacked RNN layers. SGD with an initial learning rate of 1 and gradient clipping are used for optimization. We train a maximum of 300 epochs and start to decrease the learning rate by a factor of 0.98 after 175 epochs.

The perplexity is worse than most of those numbers reported in prior work and we attribute this difference to the lack of variational dropout support in cuDNN implementation. In contrast, SRU obtains better perplexity compared to cuDNN LSTM and prior work, reaching 64.7 with 3 recurrent layers and 60.3 with 6 layers5.

Following standard practice (Peitz et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014; Jean et al., 2015), the training corpus was pre-processed and about 4 million translation pairs are left after processing. The news-test-2014 data is used as the test set and the concatenation of news-test-2012 and news-test-2013 data is used as the development set.\nSetup We use OpenNMT (Klein et al., 2017), an open-source machine translation system for our experiments. We take the Pytorch version of this system6 and extend it with our SRU implementation. The system trains a seq2seq model using a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture with attention (Luong et al., 2015). By default, the model feeds ht−1 (i.e. the hidden state of decoder at step t− 1) as an additional input to the RNN decoder at step t. Although this can potentially improve translation quality, it also impedes parallelization and hence slows down the training procedure. We choose to disable this option unless otherwise specified. All models are trained with hidden and word embedding size 500, 15 epochs, SGD with initial learning rate 1.0 and batch size 64. Unlike OpenNMT’s default setting, we use a smaller standard dropout rate of 0.1 and a weight decay of 10−5.

Our implementation is also more scalable: a SRU layer in encoder and decoder adds only 4 min per training epoch. In comparison, the rest of the operations (e.g. attention and softmax output) costs about 95 min and a LSTM layer costs 23 min per epoch. As a result, we can easily stack many layers of SRU without increasing much of the training time. During our experiments, we do not observe an over-fitting on the dev set even using 10 layers."

Maximum likelihood-criterion context-dependent speaker adapted acoustic models with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features are trained with standard Kaldi recipes. Forced alignment is performed to generate labels for neural network acoustic model training.\nFor speech recognition task, we use Computational Network Toolkit (CNTK) (Yu et al., 2014) instead of PyTorch for neural network training. Following (Sainath et al., 2015), all weights are randomly initialized from the uniform distribution with range [−0.05, 0.05], and all biases are initialized to 0 without generative or discriminative pretraining (Seide et al., 2011). All neural network models, unless explicitly stated otherwise, are trained with a cross-entropy (CE) criterion using truncated back-propagation-through-time (BPTT) (Williams and Peng, 1990) for optimization. No momentum is used for the first epoch, and a momentum of 0.9 is used for subsequent epochs (Zhang et al., 2015). L2 constraint regularization (Hinton et al., 2012) with weight 10−5 is applied.\nTo train the uni-directional model, we unroll 20 frames and use 80 utterances in each mini-batch. We also delayed the output of LSTM by 10 frames as suggested in (Sak et al., 2014) to add more context for LSTM. The ASR performance can be further improved by using bidirectional model and state-level Minimum Bayes Risk (sMBR) training (Kingsbury et al., 2012). To train the bidirectional model, the latency-controlled method described in (Zhang et al., 2015) was applied. We set Nc = 80 and Nr = 20 and processed 40 utterances simultaneously. To train the recurrent model with sMBR criterion (Kingsbury et al., 2012), we adopted the two-forward-pass method described in (Zhang et al., 2015), and processed 40 utterances simultaneously.\nThe input features for all models are 80-dimensional log Mel filterbank features computed every 10 ms, with an additional 3-dimensional pitch features unless explicitly stated. The output targets are 8802-context-dependent triphone states, of which the numbers are determined by the last HMM-GMM training stage.\nResults Table 5 summaries the results using SRU and other published results on SWBD corpus. We achieve state of the art results on this dataset. Note that LF-MMI for sequence training, i-vectors for speaker adaptation, and speaker perturbation for data augmentation have been applied in (Povey et al., 2016). All of these techniques can also been used for SRU. Moreover, we believe different highway variants such as grid LSTM (Hsu et al., 2016) can also further boost our model. If we also apply the same highway connection to LSTM, the performance is slightly worse than the baseline. Removing the dependency of h in LSTM can improve the speed but no gain for WER. Here we didn’t use our customized kernel for SRU because CNTK has a special batching algorithm for RNNs. We can see without any kernel optimization, the SRU is already faster than LSTM using the same amount of parameters.

We can observed that our best LSTM model (with least parameters) has 5-layer and each layer contains 1024 memory cells.

For instance, the forward pass computation of ht is blocked until the entire computation of ht−1 finishes, which is a major bottleneck for parallel computing. In this work, we propose an alternative RNN implementation by deliberately simplifying the state computation and exposing more parallelism. The proposed recurrent unit operates as fast as a convolutional layer and 5-10x faster than cuDNN-optimized LSTM. We demonstrate the unit’s effectiveness across a wide range of applications including classification, question answering, language modeling, translation and speech recognition. We open source our implementation in PyTorch and CNTK1.",
