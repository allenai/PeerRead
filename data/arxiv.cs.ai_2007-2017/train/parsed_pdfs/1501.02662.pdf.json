Moreiraf) Instituto de F́ısica de São Carlos, Universidade de São Paulo (IFSC/USP)\n(Dated: 20 September 2017)\nParticipatory democracy advances in virtually all governments. South America presents a prominent context with mixed culture and social predisposition. In 2012, civil, academic and governmental parties started elaborating the “Common Vocabulary of Social Participation” (vcps from the Brazilian name Vocabulário Comum de Participação Social), as a public and online process. By May, 2013, first reference documents were publicized, together with a preliminary owl code, logos, and a diagram of a general “public consultation”. The corais platform kept online records of the process, like discussions and preparation of texts. This article exposes this material and proposes an elementary unfolding: the “Social Participation Ontology” (ops from the Brazilian name Ontologia de Participação Social). To exhibit this new ontology, these steps were considered: correction of ontological contradictions and owl protocol use errors; completion of vcps owl code into a preliminary version of the ops; translations and standardizations; enhancements of class names and labels in Portuguese, Spanish and English; a toy expansion of the ontology by further specifying classes; linked data examples regarding dereferencing, a sparql endpoint and participatory instances; use cases by researchers and public managers. Ongoing work involves further adoption of ops by the official Brazilian federal portal of social participation, further adoption by civil participative organizations, and linkage to other participative ontologies. ops is being used as an upper ontology, and all classes linked further to foaf and bfo as higher upper ontologies.\nPACS numbers: 89.65-s,07.05.Bx,07.05.Kf Keywords: OWL, semantic web, linked data, electronic democracy, participatory democracy, social systems\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEasy access to social media is reshaping citizen participation in government affairs1. Information and communication technologies (icts) have exhibited such an impact on the way individuals interact that it is giving birth to new organizational methods in social movements. These changes can be observed, for example, in the 2010 Arab Spring and the 2013 Brazilian protests. These events gathered millions of people and, although recent, have shown direct and strong impact in governments and new laws, and the forecast is an intensification of the process2–4.\nConcomitantly, electronic government initiatives are flourishing, favored mainly by the ubiquity of Internet\na)http://ifsc.usp.br/˜fabbri/; Electronic mail: fabbri@usp.br b)http://www.cidadedemocratica.org.br/; Electronic mail: henrique@cidadedemocratica.org.br; Cidade Democrática c)http://www.cidadedemocratica.org.br/; Electronic mail: rodrigoyellow@cidadedemocratica.org.br; Cidade Democrática d)http://ricardopoppi.org/; Electronic mail: ricardo.poppi@presidencia.gov.br; Social Participation Department, Social Articulation National Secretariat, Brazilian Presidency General Secretariat of the Republic (DPS/SNAS/SG-PR) e)http://java.icmc.usp.br; Electronic mail: florkarina27@gmail.com; Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação (ICMC/USP) f)http://java.icmc.usp.br; Electronic mail: dilvan@icmc.usp.br; also at (ICMC/USP)\ntechnologies (e.g. html 5, node.js, open source browsers) and by the need for renewal of representative democracy practices. These initiatives have taken place in various platforms, including usual social networks (e.g. facebook, twitter) and dedicated clients created by both government and civil society agents1,5–7.\nA natural challenge arises: how to link information produced into an unified knowledge base. This is being addressed, at the technology level, by semantic web developments. Endorsed by World Wide Web Consortium (w3c), current semantic web technologies include8:\n• reasoning by means of ontological specifications,\n• linking data from different sources (e.g. databases),\n• organization of domain knowledge for coherent consideration.\nKey among these technologies, ontologies are considered one of the pillars of the semantic web. An ontology is usually defined as a formal specification of a shared conceptualization9. They give meaning to data and are useful for datasets available on the web to make them automatically retrievable and linkable with other datasets. The w3c created the Web Ontology Language (owl) as a standard to represent ontologies in the web. The second version of the language is called owl 2 and offers greater expressive power10, but the version is omitted with very few exceptions.\nIn this context, to describe and give meaning to social participation, the “Common Vocabulary of Social Par-\nar X\niv :1\n50 1.\n02 66\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C Y\n] 1\n2 Ja\nn 20\n15\nticipation” (vcps from the Brazilian name Vocabulário Comum de Participação Social) was proposed as a joint effort of Latin America academic, civil and governmental groups11. Although started in 2012, a recent initiative for ontological developments, it already yielded relevant material, including a public preliminary owl ontology with a concise taxonomy. Also important are the reference documents reporting results from a first working phase, from July to December, 2012. As stated by the community, vcps was propelled by three goals: 1) to ease adoption of the vocabulary; 2) to stimulate the creation of public tools to understand, visualize and summarize how participation is happening; 3) to meet the need of participative initiatives to open and link their data.\nIt is important to notice that vcps, an ontology, was called a vocabulary both to ease understanding of the general public and because it started as a vocabulary. The present article presents the “Ontology of Social Participation” (ops from the Brazilian name Ontologia de Participação Social), based on vcps, in which the term vocabulary was substituted by the term ontology for the following reasons:\n• The usage of the word “vocabulary” can lead to confusion is some situations as ops is an owl ontology (not, for example, a skos vocabulary).\n• Documentation seems inconsistent when an ontology is repeatedly called a vocabulary.\n• Ops is, in fact, an ontology, with a vocabulary, a taxonomic organization and properties further relating the terms.\n• This coherent naming is a prerequisite for for academic acceptance and further formal adoption by government instances, such as the Brazilian Federal Portal of Open Data12 and the Brazilian Federal Portal of Social Participation13.\nAlso, the term common was dropped when ops was conceived, as the term is redundant for an ontology. The vcps presented other difficulties, such as missing classes, incorrect uri specifications (containing spaces), some logical flaws, and unnecessary out-of-standards restrictions. This were all solved within ops (to the extent authors were able to, of course).\nNext section is dedicated to an inspection of the documents delivered by the vcps: reference textual documents, images, owl code, blog posts, discussions and etherpads. Section III presents ops: modifications made from vcps to ops: class and property names and labels, class restrictions and property axioms. Section IV is dedicated to ops usage: dereferencing, sparql queries, a toy ops expansion, discursive example of usage, and use cases from government, civil society and academic parties. Concluding remarks are stated with future work, in Section V.\nII. VCPS ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION\nFrom April to December, 2012, vcps was first conceived. In the online process, as registered by corais platform, 66 users interacted, 6 of them were the most active14. Various materials were produced both as activity traces and as reference media. This section is dedicated to these materials.\nA. Reference textual documents\nThe main documents are:\n• “Commented methodology”14: this document describes the public process of vcps conception. It is composed by brief inspections of forum topics, pointing both pertinent characteristics of the online collective process and ontological observations (about classes and properties). Considerations are made about tightening relations with the Open Government Partnership (ogp), an international initiative to foster transparency and open practices in governments worldwide15, and the Brazilian formal action plan, as means to achieve ontology usage. There is also a proposal of a systematic study of electronic government initiatives, so that the vcps might be better contextualized. This document ends by proposing an agenda of meetings with academics, entrepreneurs and government parties.\n• “Conceptual modeling, version 0.1 (in natural language)”16: this document is a description, in common English, of the vcps. The introduction is mainly a collage of the document above14. Both the itemized description of the ontology, and the considerations for its usage, are of great value as reference. Figure 2 is heavily influenced by a diagram related to this document and further described in Section II B.\nB. Images\nThere are various images associated with the ontology17, most notably:\n• Various proposals for the vcps logo, some of which are in Figure 1.\n• Figure 2 shows an English and completed version of the original diagram of ops in the document16. For completeness of exposition, the original diagram is in Appendix D, Figure 8.\n• A diagram for general public consultations. Given the details and the pertinence of public consultations for ops, the digram is exposed in Appendix B and Figure 7.\nC. OWL code of VCPS\nThe owl code of vcps is online18 and deprecated by ops advent. The vcps owl code did not contain all relation from Figure 2 (or Figure 8). This is directly addressed in Section III, which exposes the implementation of all relations in the ops, including vcps owl corrections and adjustments to best practices. The complete and correct ops is further contextualized in Section IV.\nD. Blog Posts\nThe vcps blog aggregates both important discussions and documents in no more than twenty posts to date. All owl code, final documents, public consultations, mental map and images are posted in the blog19. The first post if from July 24, 2012. Last post about vcps is from May 7, 2013. Most blog posts are from the first day (almost half of them). They received more than twenty commentaries. Two “out-of-season” blog posts, one from August 9, 2012 and another from October 22, 2012, separate first day posts from last posts. Both have about ten commentaries. Last blog posts occurred as a few days burst and a final message, a month after.\nThere are three more recent blog posts, from November and December, 2013. But these already address ops conception from vcps.\nE. Discussions and etherpads\nBesides blog registries of collective elaborations, four etherpads were written20 (these are interfaces that allows writing online texts with multiple simultaneous contributors21):\n• A pad for important words.\n• A pad dedicated to a second phase of vcps elaboration, which did not happen yet.\n• A pad for process documentation. It became the first document described in Section II A.\n• A pad for both vocabulary specification and “questions not addressed to in the webinar”.\nIII. OPS: THE ONTOLOGY OF SOCIAL PARTICIPATION\nThis section makes considerations about ops label standardization and implemented classes, properties and restrictions. Features present in Figure 2, but not present in vcps, are fully described in Section III A. Examples of usage are addressed in Section IV.\nA. Standardization and exhibition of implemented features\nWithout explicit criteria, vcps uri was http:// lumii.lv/ontologies/Corais.owl. Ops uri was chosen to be http://purl.org/socialparticipation/ops for the following reasons:\n• This uri is directly related to the ontology name (ops).\n• This uri, also an url, is independent from government and other political associations. This is important to coalesce interested parties: the Brazilian Federal Social Participation Portal13, Brazilian government repository of vocabularies and ontologies22, academic groups, ngos, and non-organized civil society.\n• Derived uris, when reached via http, can be redirected to where current documentation is held, as it is hosted by http://purl.org.\nLabels in the languages of interest should be written in label fields. Even so, ops class names should be friendly to users, bearing the attention not to take the class name as the label or as a meaning restriction.\nFor standardization, all classes are written in CamelCase23 in plain English to ease internationalization, adoption and maturation. Labels are written in Portuguese, English and Spanish. Therefore, class names changed, receiving respective labels (rdfs:label) in each language and a textual short explanation (rdfs:comment) in English. Table I exhibits all classes is ops.\nOps property names fit headlessCamelCase23 format, are readable in English (to ease internationalization, adoption and maturation), and some of them have defined domains and ranges. Table II is dedicated to ops properties, with labels in English, Portuguese and Spanish.\nIn the first versions of ops, all properties yielded existential restrictions, except ops:hasParticipationCharacteristic. Although\nsuch efforts were aimed at handling a better defined ops, further developments and discussions revealed that these restrictions made ops rigid, a bit more complicated, and was not of much help, at least in this stage of ops development and adoption. The result is that all restrictions were removed. Appendix A and Table IV exhibit all dropped ops restrictions.\nAn inspection of vcps also yielded a contradiction present in Figure 8: a role cannot execute, initiate or support a cause. These are done by the social actor. Therefore, to maintain vcps directions and obtain a sound ontology, ops:Role was removed from ops in preliminary versions. The result can be seen directly in Figures 2 and 3.\nA comparison of the vcps owl code24 with the diagram in Figure 8, which reflects official vcps documentation, revealed that a class, two properties and three restrictions were not implemented. These were fully implemented in ops before all restrictions were removed. These are the missing class and properties (restrictions missing in vcps and implemented in preliminary ops ver-\nsions are exposed in Appendix A):\n• Class: ops:ParticipationCharacteristic.\n• Property: ops:hasRole.\n• Property: ops:composesSolution.\nOps is available online25. To ease navigation of the ontology by interested parties, it is also available in the Webprotege interface26. The diagram of ops taxonomic structure is exposed in Figure 3.\nUpper ontologies usage with ops is under development and should receive a dedicated article, as possibilities should be inspected carefully. Pertinent and already used as upper ontologies for ops are foaf27 (for linking and describing people and things they do) and bfo28 (“designed for use in supporting information retrieval, analysis and integration in scientific and other domains” as stated on their documentation). Properties were not related to upper ontologies as reasonable relations are still being searched for. Table I exposes ops classes and respective upper ontologies classes.\nFigure 2 is a complete diagram of current ops: classes, properties and relations to foaf and bfo. Actually, Figure 2 is more informative than ops owl code, as restrictions were removed and not all properties have defined domain and range. Therefore, the diagram is the remaining source of relations envisioned by ops creators.\nIV. OPS UTILITY\nOps is meant to be useful. First, as a systematization of what is social participation to Latin America groups, as conceived by vcps. Second, as a mean to ease linked data, and enable integration of various instances for social participation. An indicative of this pertinence is opa, ocd, ontologiaa, and obs, ontologies that already uses ops as upper ontology29.\nThis section explores different ops uses: dereferencing, sparql queries, expansion, discursive fictional cases, and real use cases.\nA. Usage of OPS through dereferencing\nAll ops classes and properties uris are accessible via http. A pubby instance delivers information like name, labels and relations to other classes and properties. As an example, the uri http://purl.org/ socialparticipation/ops/SocialActor returns information about this class and all subclasses it is related to, as shown in Figure 4.\nB. Usage of OPS through a SparQL endpoint\nLinking multiple databases is an owl technology core purpose. The standard way to access these data via ontologies is by using a sparql endpoint. This endpoint delivers data from a triplestore (collection of rdf triples) or, with more experimental technology, from relational database systems, such as a mysql server (e.g. via ontop/quest30). Either way, the query is the same: the user or machine reaching the endpoint uses the sparql\nprotocol in order to retrieve information through semantic criteria. Figure 5 is a schematic representation of obda (Ontology Based Database Access), which is a common name for this multiple database access through ontologies.\nSome examples of this usage can be given by sparql queries and concise explanations:\n• \"select ?s ?s2 ?s3 where {?s a ops:SocialActor . ?s2 a ops:Person . ?s3 a ops:Organization}\": this query retrieves all social actors (returned in variable ?s), be each a person, an organization, or something else; retrieves all persons (variable ?s2); and retrieves all organizations (?s3). In a similar manner, one can retrieve all roles played, all executers, all initiators and all supporters.\n• \"select ?s ?o where {?s ops:starts ?o}\": this query retrieves all causes (?o) and their initiators (?s) or whatever use is being done of the ops:stars property.\n• \"select ?s ?s2 ?o ?o2 where {?s a ops:Action . ?s ops:belongsTo ?o . ?s2 ops:executes ?s . ?s ops:produces ?o2}\": this query retrieves all actions (?s) along their Action Field (?o), their Executer (?s2) and their Results (?o2), or whatever use is being made of there ops classes and properties.\nNoteworthy is that while opa:Participant can be used to retrieve all participa.br participants, ocd:Participant can be used to retrieve all cidade democrática participants, and aa:User can be used to retrieve all aa participants; their upper ontology class ops:SocialActor retrieves all of them and relates these entities directly to the class of generic actors of social participation processes29.\nC. OPS expansion\nOps matches vcps online documentation11. As an example of additional classes, an expanded ops ontology is exposed in this section and is uploaded to webprotege31. Table III is dedicated to these additional classes while\nFigure 6 presents the resulting taxonomic structure.\nThe property ops:receivesFrom was also added and has an inverse: ops:SocialActor ops:paysTo ops:Executor. Also, the ops:DownloadedMod class is a defined class by the existential restriction: ops:Mob ops:convoquedBy ops:Network, with a newly defined property ops:convoquedBy.\nThis is one of the numerous ways by which ops might deal with further classes, properties and restrictions. This particular expansion was chosen as an example by direct observance of vcps documentation and recent social affairs, such as the Brazilian protests.\nD. Fictional examples of usage\nOps usage might not be obvious at first. How is data linked? How is field knowledge organized? Why and by whom? Core principles of these ops utilities, can be understood by the following observations:\n• Different participation instances have social actors, actions being developed, organizations involved, problems being tackled, etc. These can yield one consistent database by means of ops usage.\n• One can understand and share the mutually exclusive nature of being a paid or a voluntary contributor by observing the expanded version of ops (see Section IV C. Also, noticing the fact that a mob can be very big or not, and that it can be convoked or not by a Network, can make the field more neat for a newcomer or ease discussions and problematization for senior researchers or politicians.\n• Other fields of human knowledge and practice also have agents, problems and so forth. These can be linked to participatory data and ontologies by means of ops.\nFictional examples are useful to make these points clear:\n• Suppose a public sparql endpoint unifies several participation instances by means of ops (we will see in Section IV E that this is not really fictional). Thus, the number of participants is publicly available (|ops:SocialActor|). Also, depending on the platforms involved, one can observe how many of these participants are individuals (ops:Person), how many are organizations (ops:Organization), and understand to which extent the corporative influence is explicit. One can observe how many of the participants are the same in each platform, and\nwhat roles they take, and make assumptions about how much the society is really participating or if these processes are manipulated by a few agents (ops:SocialActor). One can also gaze uppon the problems being discussed and which solutions are being proposed, therefore easing the sense of what is being considered important and valid as public discussions. This list of possibilities is endless, specially when ops variations and expansions are considered.\n• Suppose a person, say Jessica, has a new proposal for a participative system that uses ops. She can have a quite concise understanding of the concepts involved, and how they relate. She can now make very objective observations and deliver clear suggestions that relate directly to the systems used or envisioned. She can make an ops variation or another ontology, as a way to confront paradigms.\n• Suppose there is a system for exhibiting indicators about social participation (how effective it has been, how wide is the scope of interests, etc.). Instances that are integrated by ops can be queried for information and, for example, this system registers any organization involved as a social actor. Also, reflecting the expanded ops exposed above, the system registers any mob involved, whose incidence was recorded in the database as a DownloadedMob, as related to some social network (the network might be unknown).\nE. Real use cases\nOps is a recent ontology. Even so, some real use cases can be pointed, from which are most notable:\n• The undp/un consultant contract 2013/00056, project BRA/12/018, was profoundly influenced by ops29. Within written products are other participatory ontologies, such as opa, ocd, ontologiaa and obs, which relates directly to ops. Also, some methods for analysing ops related data and for resource recommendation were delivered. These developments were done by the computational physics researcher R. Fabbri (first author of the present article), in collaboration with other parties, specially the Brazilian General Secretariat of the Republic, University of Braśılia researchers, and free software parties. Data from three participatory instances were triplified: participa.br, aa and cidade democrática; all related to ops. These linked data resources are available in sparql endpoints and can be dereferenced, in a similar fashion as done for ops. As these are all executed in research facilities, they might lack maintenance and should be kept by a dedicated team.\nF IG\n. 6 .\nA ta\nx o n o m\nic d ia\ng ra\nm o f\na n\nex a m\np le\nex p a n d ed\nin st\na n ce\no f o p s.\no p s : P a i d E x e c u t o r\nis d efi\nn ed\na s\nb ei\nn g\nth e\nsu b\nje ct\no f\na o p s : r e c e i v e s F r o m\nre la\nti o n\nw it\nh a\no p s : S o c i a l A c t o r ; o p s : D o w n l o a d e d M o b\nis d efi\nn ed\nb y\nb ei\nn g\nth e\nsu b\nje ct\no f\na o p s : c o n v o q u e d B y\nre la\nti o n\nw it\nh a o p s : S o c i a l N e t w o r k . o w l\nco d e\nis o n li n e\nfo r\nli v e\ned it\nin g 3 1 .\nT h e\nn ew\ncl a ss\nes a d d ed\nto o p s\na re\nin T\na b le\nII I\nturing related to ops beyond the ontologies developed, undp/un documentation, serpro triplification, and vcps. Interested government, civil society and academic parties circulated ops documentation for conceptual and technological goals34,35.\nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK\nOps, based in vcps, yields initial steps in achieving an effective social participation ontology: community has registered activities and delivered reference documents, including this article. Sections III and IV have expansion directions for the ontology, regarding uses, further definition of classes, upper ontologies and related ontological structures.\nOn the practical side, the use of this ontology or related developments for the Brazilian federal participation portal (participa.br13) is a desirable reality, as it implies usage and good maintenance. Moreover, an ontology was done for participa.br, based in the ops: the opa29 (Ontology of participa.br). This is confluent with the presidential Decree that establishes a policy and commitment for social participation36. In this context, presidential, ministerial and academic parties started formalizing current legal participatory mechanisms (e.g. conferences, councils, forums, public consultations, round tables) in ontological terms, which resulted in the Social Library Ontology (obs from the Brazilian name Ontologia da Biblioteca Social) and the Social Library Vocabulary (vbs from the Brazilian name Vocabulário da Biblioteca Social). Hosting ontologies on Webprotege37 have become central, as a way to share specific ontologies in a friendly environment and to collects observations.\nA. Further work\nFurther work involves observing community manifestations about ops and this article, accomplishing use by means of formal instances and civil society, and studying upper ontologies usage with ops. The use of ops (or a variant) in different instances is being tackled for the creation of social participation indicators and easing participation processes.\nAcademic texts dedicated to each new participation ontology created (ocd, obs, ontologiaa, opa) should be written and submitted to peer review for enhancements and quality assurance29.\nData related to these ontologies were found in relational databases and preliminary scripts were written to make them available as rdf. A sound linkage of this data and incorporation to the Linked Open Data (lod38) cloud is planed for a near future. This should make Brazilian participative structures and data part of the Giant Global Graph39.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis article is deeply influenced by Protege and BFO documentation.

This might lead to NULL or “not yet defined” field supplies. Also, in vcps, existential restrictions were written as “min 1”. These were changed to the standard “some” existential restriction in preliminary ops and were completely removed afterwards, as a way to avoid making ops usage rigid and more complicated.\nAppendix B: Public consultation\nPublic consultations have core importance in participatory democracy and the model in Figure 7 was conceived as part of vcps community documentation. An owl implementation of such public consultation was meant to be developed and made public, with dedicated attention. Considerations of this public consultation with respect to the ops and formal existent instances was envisioned as well. This public consultation model is observed here for completeness of exposition and further details goes beyond the scope of this article. A public consultations along the lines of a recent Presidential decree36 was formalized in obs owl and in vbs skos29.\nAppendix C: OWL code of the Ontology of Social Participation\n1 @prefix foaf: <http :// xmlns.com/foaf /0.1/> . 2 @prefix ops: <http :// purl.org/socialparticipation/ops/> . 3 @prefix owl: <http ://www.w3.org /2002/07/ owl#> . 4 @prefix rdf: <http ://www.w3.org /1999/02/22 -rdf -syntax - ns#> . 5 @prefix rdfs: <http ://www.w3.org /2000/01/rdf -schema#> . 6 @prefix snap: <http ://www.ifomis.org/bfo /1.1/ snap#> . 7 @prefix span: <http ://www.ifomis.org/bfo /1.1/ span#> . 8 @prefix xml: <http ://www.w3.org/XML /1998/ namespace > . 9 @prefix xsd: <http ://www.w3.org /2001/ XMLSchema#> .\n10 11 ops:Action a rdfs:Class , 12 owl:Class ;

    "abstractText" : "Participatory democracy advances in virtually all governments. South America presents a prominent context with mixed culture and social predisposition. In 2012, civil, academic and governmental parties started elaborating the “Common Vocabulary of Social Participation” (vcps from the Brazilian name Vocabulário Comum de Participação Social), as a public and online process. By May, 2013, first reference documents were publicized, together with a preliminary owl code, logos, and a diagram of a general “public consultation”. The corais platform kept online records of the process, like discussions and preparation of texts. This article exposes this material and proposes an elementary unfolding: the “Social Participation Ontology” (ops from the Brazilian name Ontologia de Participação Social). To exhibit this new ontology, these steps were considered: correction of ontological contradictions and owl protocol use errors; completion of vcps owl code into a preliminary version of the ops; translations and standardizations; enhancements of class names and labels in Portuguese, Spanish and English; a toy expansion of the ontology by further specifying classes; linked data examples regarding dereferencing, a sparql endpoint and participatory instances; use cases by researchers and public managers. Ongoing work involves further adoption of ops by the official Brazilian federal portal of social participation, further adoption by civil participative organizations, and linkage to other participative ontologies. ops is being used as an upper ontology, and all classes linked further to foaf and bfo as higher upper ontologies.",
