      "text" : "Supervised sequence learning is a regression task where the objective is to learn a mapping function from the input sequence x to the corresponding output sequence z for all (x, z) ∈ S with the given training set S, where x and z can have different lengths. When combined with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), supervised sequence learning has shown great success in many applications including machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014), speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013; Graves & Jaitly, 2014; Hannun et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2015), and handwritten character recognition (Graves et al., 2008; Frinken et al., 2012). Although several attention-based models have been introduced recently, connectionist temporal classification (CTC) (Graves et al., 2006) is still one of the most successful techniques in practice, especially for end-to-end speech and character recognition tasks (Graves & Jaitly, 2014; Hannun et al., 2014; Graves et al., 2008; Frinken et al., 2012).\nThe CTC based sequence training is usually applied to bidirectional RNNs (Graves & Schmidhuber, 2005), where both the past and the future information is considered for generating the output at each frame. However, the output of the bidirectional RNNs is available after all of the frames in the input sequence are fed into the RNNs because the future information is backward propagated from the end of the sequence. Therefore, the bidirectional RNNs are not suitable for realtime applications such as incremental speech recognition (Fink et al., 1998), that require low-latency output from the RNN. On the other hand, unidirectional RNNs only make use of the past information with\nsome performance sacrifice and are suitable for the low-latency applications. Moreover, the CTCtrained unidirectional RNNs do not need to be unrolled (or unfolded) at the test time. It is shown by Graves et al. (2012) that CTC can also be employed for sequence training of unidirectional RNNs on a phoneme recognition task. In this case, the unidirectional RNN also learns the suitable amount of the output delay that is required to accurately process the input sequence.\nFor the CTC training of both unidirectional and bidirectional RNNs, it is required to unroll the RNNs by the length of the input sequence. By unrolling an RNN N times, every activations of the neurons inside the network are replicated N times, which consumes a huge amount of memory especially when the sequence is very long. This hinders a small footprint implementation of online learning or adaptation. Also, this “full unrolling” makes a parallel training with multiple sequences inefficient on shared memory models such as graphics processing units (GPUs), since the length of training sequences is usually not uniform, and thus a load imbalance problem occurs. For unidirectional RNNs, this problem can be addressed by concatenating sequences to make a very long stream of sequences, and training the RNNs with synchronized fixed-length unroll-windows over multiple training streams (Chen et al., 2014; Hwang & Sung, 2015). However, it is not straightforward to apply this approach to the CTC training, since the standard CTC algorithm requires full unrolling for the backward variable propagation, which starts from the end of the sequence.\nIn this paper, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) based online CTC algorithm for sequence training of unidirectional RNNs. The algorithm allows training sequences to be longer than the amount of the network unroll. Moreover, it can be applied to infinitely long input streams with roughly segmented target sequences (e.g. only with the utterance boundaries and the corresponding transcriptions for training an end-to-end speech recognition RNN). Then, the resulting RNN can run continuously without pre-segmentation or external reset. Due to the fixed unroll amount, the proposed algorithm is suitable for online learning or adaptation systems with constrained hardware resource. Furthermore, the approach can directly be combined with the GPU based parallel RNN training algorithm described in Hwang & Sung (2015). For evaluation, we present examples of end-to-end speech recognition on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (Paul & Baker, 1992) with continuously running RNNs.1 Experimental results show that the proposed online CTC algorithm performs comparable to the almost fully unrolled CTC training even with the small unroll amount that is shorter than the average length of the sequences in the training set. Also, the reduced amount of unroll allows more parallel sequences to be trained concurrently with the same memory use, which results in greatly improved training speed on a GPU.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the standard CTC algorithm is explained. Section 3 contains the definition of the online sequence training problem and proposes the online CTC algorithm. In Section 4, the algorithm is extended for the continuously running RNNs, which is followed by its parallelization in Section 5. In Section 6, the proposed algorithm is evaluated with speech recognition examples. Concluding remarks follow in Section 7."

For the set of target labels, L, and its extended set with the additional CTC blank label, L′ = L ∪ {b}, the path, π, is defined as a sequence over L′, that is, π ∈ L′T , where T is the length of the input sequence, x. Then, the output sequence, z ∈ L≤T , is represented by z = F(π) with the sequence to sequence mapping functionF . F maps any path π with the length T into the shorter sequence of the label, z, by first merging the consecutive same labels into one and then removing the blank labels. Therefore, any sequence of the raw RNN outputs with the length T can be decoded into the shorter labeling sequence, z, with ignoring timings. This enables the RNNs to learn the sequence mapping, z = G(x), where x is the input sequence and z is the corresponding target labeling for all (x, z) in the training set, S. More specifically, the gradient of the loss function L(x, z) = − ln p(z|x) is computed and fed to the RNN through the softmax layer (Bridle, 1990), of which the size is |L′|.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, the CTC algorithm employs the forward-backward algorithm for computing the gradient of the loss function, L(x, z). Let z′ be the sequence over L′ with the length of 2|z|+1, where z′u = b for odd u and z ′ u = zu/2 for even u. Then, the forward variable, α, and the backward variable, β, are initialized by\nα(1, u) =\n\n\n y1b if u = 1 y1z1 if u = 2 0 otherwise , β(T, u) = { 1 if u = |z′|, |z′| − 1 0 otherwise , (1)\nwhere ytk is the softmax output of the label k ∈ L ′ at time t.

The length of the input sequence, |x|, is unknown except when t = |x|.\n• The parameters of the estimation modelM is updated in the manner of online learning, that is, they can be frequently updated even before seeing the entire input sequence x.\nThis online learning problem usually occurs in real world when a human learns a language from texts and the corresponding audio. For example, when watching movies with subtitles, we are given the entire target sequence (subtitle for the current utterance) and the input sequence (the corresponding audio) up to the current time, t. We cannot access the future audio and even do not know exactly when the utterance will end (at t = |x|).\nWhen RNNs are trained with the standard CTC algorithm, it is difficult to determine how much amount of unrolling is needed before the entire sequence x is given, since the length of x is unknown at time t < |x|. Also, it is not easy to learn the sequences that are longer than the unroll amount, which is often constrained by the hardware resources."

The CTC-TR and CTCEM algorithms are explained in Section 3.3 and Section 3.4, respectively. Note that simply setting h = 2h′ works well in practice.

      "text" : "With the standard CTC algorithm, it is not possible to compute the backward variables when τn < T , as the future information beyond τn cannot be accessed. Therefore, we only compute the CTC errors at the last iteration, where τn = T as in Algorithm 2. In this case, however, the gradients are only available in the unroll range. Since the backward propagation is truncated at the beginning of the unroll range, we call the CTC algorithm in this range as truncated CTC, or CTC-TR. Also, we call the range that is covered by the CTC-TR algorithm as the CTC-TR coverage.\nThe RNN can be trained only with CTC-TR if there are sufficient labels that occur within the CTCTR coverage. However, the CTC-TR coverage decreases by making the unroll amount smaller. Then, the percentage of the effective training frames, which actually generate the output errors, goes down, and the efficiency of training decreases. Also, the effective size of the training set gets smaller, which results in the loss of the generalization performance of the RNN. Therefore, for maintaining the training performance while reducing the unroll amount, it is critical to make use of the full training frames by employing the CTC-EM algorithm, which is described in Section 3.4."

      "text" : "Assume that only the fraction of the input sequence, x1:τ , is available. Then, as shown in the Figure 3, there are |z|+1 possible partial labelings.2 Let z1:m be the subsequence of z with the first m labels. Also we define Z as the set that consists of these labeling sequences:\nZ = {z1:m : 0 ≤ m ≤ |z|}. (6)\nOne of the most simple approach for training the network under this condition is to choose the most likely partial alignment from Z and compute the standard CTC error by regarding the partial alignment as the ground truth labeling. For example, we can select z1:m′ where m′ = argmaxm α(τ,m)\n2Although z1:m is not possible by the standard CTC formulation when m > τ , we can still say that z1:m is a possible labeling with a probability of zero without loss of generality.\nsince α(τ,m) is a posterior probability p(z1:m|x1:τ ,w(n)) with the current network parameterw(n). This is a well-known hard-EM approach. This simple idea can easily be extended to the more sophisticated soft-EM approach as follows. First, select one of the partial labelings in Z with the probability p(z1:m|Z,x1:τ ,w(n)) estimated by the RNN with current parameters (E-step). Then, maximize the probability of that labeling by adjusting the parameters (M-step).\nThis optimization problem is readily reduced into the generalized EM algorithm. Specifically, the expectation step is represented as\nQτ (w|x, z,w (n)) = E\nz1:m|Z,x1:τ ,w(n) [ln p(z1:m|x1:τ ,w)] (7)\n=\n|z| ∑\nm=0\np(z1:m|Z,x1:τ ,w (n)) ln p(z1:m|x1:τ ,w), (8)\nwhere w(n) is the set of the network parameters at the current iteration, n. In the maximization step of the generalized EM approach, we try to maximize Qτ by finding new parameters w(n+1) that satisfies Qτ (w(n+1)|x, z,w(n)) ≥ Qτ (w(n)|x, z,w(n)). As proved in Appendix A, this is equivalent to the optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the loss function defined as Lτ (x, z) = − ln p(Z|x1:τ ).

The training stream can be naturally very long with the target sequence boundaries, or can be generated by concatenating training sequences in a certain order. When trained on this training stream without external reset of the RNN at the sequence boundaries, the resulting RNN can also continuously process infinitely long input streams without pre-segmentation or external\nreset. This property is useful for realtime speech recognition or keyword spotting (spoken term detection) systems since we can remove the frontend voice activity detector (Sohn et al., 1999) for detecting and pre-segmenting utterances.\nThe CTC(h; h′) algorithm can directly be applied to the infinitely long training streams as shown in Figure 4. When the sequence boundaries are reached during the forward activation, we perform CTC-TR, initialize the forward variable, and process the next sequence with some frame offset. Also, care should be taken on the transition of CTC labels at the boundary. Assume that the last label of the sequence n and the first label of the sequence n + 1 are the same. Then, a CTC blank label should be inserted between two sequences since the same labels that occur consecutively in the decoding path are folded into one label. In practice, this folding can easily be prevented by forcing the blank label at the first frame of each sequence by modifying the initialization of the forward variable as follows:\nαc(1, u) =\n{\ny1b if u = 1 0 otherwise , (12)\nwhere the subscript c indicates the continuous CTC training."

For example, computing multiple frames together reduces the number of read operations of the network parameters from the slow off-chip memory by temporarily storing them on the on-chip cache memory and reuse them multiple times. For training RNNs on a GPU, this parallelism can be explored by employing multiple training sequences concurrently (Hwang & Sung, 2015).\nThe continuous CTC(h; h′) algorithm in Section 4 can be directly extended for parallel training with multiple streams. Since the forward step size and the unroll amount is fixed, the RNN forward, backward, gradient computation, and weight update steps can be synchronized over multiple training streams. Thus, the GPU based parallelization approach in Hwang & Sung (2015) can be employed for the RNN training. Although the computations in the CTC(h; h′) algorithm are relatively fewer than those of the RNN, further speed-up can be achieved by parallelizing the CTC algorithm similarly."

The histogram of the length of the sequences in the training set is shown in Figure 5. Note that the average length of the sequences is 772.5 frames. If we unroll the network over N frames, the sequences longer than N frames will not be fully covered by CTC-TR.\nIn Figure 6, the CTC-TR coverage is further analyzed with respect to the length of the sequence and the unroll amount. When the stream of sequences are trained with the continuos CTC algorithm, the\nCTC-TR coverage varies depending on the frame offsets of CTC(h; h′). The average coverage is calculated assuming that the offset is uniformly distributed.

For this intermediate evaluation, best path decoding (Graves et al., 2006) is employed for fast computation.\nFor the online update of the RNN parameters, the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method is employed and accelerated by the Nesterov momentum of 0.9 (Nesterov, 1983; Bengio et al., 2013). Also, the network is annealed by combining the early stopping technique as follows. If the network performance based on the intermediate evaluation is not improved for 11 consecutive times (10 times of retry), the learning rate is reduced by the factor of 10 and the training is resumed from the second best network. The training starts from the learning rate of 10−5 and finishes when the learning rate becomes less than 10−7.\nThe pre-trained network is used for CTC-TR and CTC-EM combined training because the expectation step of CTC-EM requires the RNN to align the target labels in a certain level.

Also, it can be observed that the performance of the CTC-TR only trained network with 512 times of unrolling converges to the worse WER than those of the other networks due to the reduced size of the effective training set.

      "heading" : "B PHONEME RECOGNITION ON TIMIT",
      "text" : "B.1 TIMIT CORPUS\nThe TIMIT corpus (Garofolo et al., 1993) contains American English recordings of 630 speakers from 8 major dialect regions in the United States. The training set contains about 3.1 hours of 3,696 utterances from 462 speakers after removing the SA recordings, in which only two sentences are spoken by multiple speakers. Figure 8 shows the histogram of the length of the training sequences, where the feature frames are extracted with the 10 ms period. The average length of the training sequences is 304 frames. We use the core test set with 192 utterances as the test set. The development set contains the remaining 1,152 utterances that are obtained by excluding the core test set from the complete test set. The corpus also includes the full phonetic transcriptions.\nB.2 NETWORK STRUCTURE\nThe network structure is a deep unidirectional LSTM RNN with 3 LSTM hidden layers, where each LSTM layer has 512 cells. The input is the same log Mel-frequency filterbank feature as in the WSJ experiments. The training procedure is also similar. The original TIMIT transcriptions are based on 61 phonetic labels. Accordingly, the RNN output is a 62-dimensional vector that consists of the probabilities of the original 61 phonemes and the extra CTC label. However, after decoding, they are mapped to 39 phonemes for evaluation as in Lee & Hon (1989).\nB.3 TRAINING PROCEDURE\nFor the experiments, the continuous CTC(2h′; h′) algorithm is employed so that the resulting RNN can run continuously on a infinitely long stream of the input speech. The networks are pre-trained with ADADELTA (Zeiler, 2012), where the local learning rates are adaptively adjusted using the statistics of the recent gradient values. Before the online CTC training with the unroll amount greater than of equal to 512, the pre-training is performed for the 8 M (8× 220) training frames with the unroll amount of 2,048, the learning rate of 10−5, the Nesterov momentum of 0.9, and the RMS decay rate of 0.99 for ADADELTA. On the other hand, we pre-trained the network with 12 M frames for the subsequent CTC training with less than 512 unroll steps. Unlike in the WSJ experiments, it is observed that applying the standard SGD method at the beginning often fails to initiate the training. We consider this is because the gradient computed by the SGD method is initially not noisy enough to help the parameters escape from the initial saddle point.\nAfter the pre-training, the standard SGD is applied with the Nesterov momentum of 0.9. The training starts with the learning rate of 10−4. The intermediate evaluations are performed at every 2 M (2× 220) training frames on the development set with the best path decoding. If the phoneme error rate (PER) fails to improve during 6 consecutive evaluations, the learning rate decreases by the factor of 2 and the parameters are restored to those of the second best network. The training finishes when the learning rate becomes less than 10−6.\nThe network is regularized with dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) in both the pre-training and the main training stages following the approach in Zaremba et al. (2014), that is, dropout is only applied on the non-recurrent connections. The dropout rate is fixed to 0.5 throughout the experiments.\nB.4 EVALUATION\nThe networks are evaluated on the very long test stream that is obtained by concatenating the entire test sequences. For the evaluation, the network output is decoded by the CTC beam search. The experiments are repeated 4 times and the mean and standard deviation estimates of PERs are reported based on the reduced 39-phoneme set.\nThe RNNs are unrolled 64, 128, 256, 512, 1,024, and 2,048 times. As shown in Table 2, the various unroll amounts make little difference to the final PERs on the test set. When the RNN is unrolled only 128 times, which is less than the average length of training sequences, the best PER of 20.73±0.40% is obtained. On the other hand, the training with the unroll amount of 2,048 results in slightly degraded performance since it becomes harder for RNNs to catch the dependencies between the input and output sequences due to the noisy input frames from the consecutive sequences.\nThe performance of the proposed online CTC algorithm is compared with the other models in Table 3. The other models employ early stopping to prevent overfitting and add weight noise while training for regularization. The bidirectional attention-based model in Chorowski et al. (2015) shows 17.6% PER with utterance-wise decoding. However, the PER increases to about 20% with the long test sequences that are generated by concatenating 11 utterances. On the other hand, our CTC(128; 64)-trained unidirectional RNNs show 20.73±0.40% PER with a very long test stream that is made by concatenating the entire 192 test utterances. Note that, unlike the CTC-trained unidirectional RNNs, the bidirectional models require unrolling in test time and have to listen the entire speech before generating outputs. Therefore, the proposed unidirectional RNN models are more suitable for realtime low-latency speech recognition systems without sacrificing much performance."

However, it is not straightforward to apply this approach to the CTC training, since the standard CTC algorithm requires full unrolling for the backward variable propagation, which starts from the end of the sequence. In this paper, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) based online CTC algorithm for sequence training of unidirectional RNNs. The algorithm allows training sequences to be longer than the amount of the network unroll. Moreover, it can be applied to infinitely long input streams with roughly segmented target sequences (e.g. only with the utterance boundaries and the corresponding transcriptions for training an end-to-end speech recognition RNN). Then, the resulting RNN can run continuously without pre-segmentation or external reset. Due to the fixed unroll amount, the proposed algorithm is suitable for online learning or adaptation systems with constrained hardware resource. Furthermore, the approach can directly be combined with the GPU based parallel RNN training algorithm described in Hwang & Sung (2015). For evaluation, we present examples of end-to-end speech recognition on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (Paul & Baker, 1992) with continuously running RNNs.",

    "abstractText" : "Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) based supervised sequence training of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has shown great success in many machine learning areas including end-to-end speech and handwritten character recognition. For the CTC training, however, it is required to unroll (or unfold) the RNN by the length of an input sequence. This unrolling requires a lot of memory and hinders a small footprint implementation of online learning or adaptation. Furthermore, the length of training sequences is usually not uniform, which makes parallel training with multiple sequences inefficient on shared memory models such as graphics processing units (GPUs). In this work, we introduce an expectation-maximization (EM) based online CTC algorithm that enables unidirectional RNNs to learn sequences that are longer than the amount of unrolling. The RNNs can also be trained to process an infinitely long input sequence without pre-segmentation or external reset. Moreover, the proposed approach allows efficient parallel training on GPUs. For evaluation, phoneme recognition and end-to-end speech recognition examples are presented on the TIMIT and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpora, respectively. Our online model achieves 20.7% phoneme error rate (PER) on the very long input sequence that is generated by concatenating all 192 utterances in the TIMIT core test set. On WSJ, a network can be trained with only 64 times of unrolling while sacrificing 4.5% relative word error rate (WER).",
