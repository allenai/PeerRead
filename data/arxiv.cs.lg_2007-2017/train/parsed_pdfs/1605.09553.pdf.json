      "text" : "Attention mechanisms have recently been introduced in deep learning for various tasks in natural language processing and computer vision. But despite their popularity, the “correctness” of the implicitly-learned attention maps has only been assessed qualitatively by visualization of several examples. In this paper we focus on evaluating and improving the correctness of attention in neural image captioning models. Specifically, we propose a quantitative evaluation metric for how well the attention maps align with human judgment, using recently released datasets with alignment between regions in images and entities in captions. We then propose novel models with different levels of explicit supervision for learning attention maps during training. The supervision can be strong when alignment between regions and caption entities are available, or weak when only object segments and categories are provided. We show on the popular Flickr30k and COCO datasets that introducing supervision of attention maps during training solidly improves both attention correctness and caption quality."

      "text" : "Attention based deep models have been proved effective at handling problems such as machine translation [2], object detection [20, 1], visual question answering [28, 4], and image captioning [29]. In these tasks, the input consists of a number of vectors with the same dimension. Deep models with attention address these tasks by learning a dynamic combination of these vectors.\nIn this work we focus on attention models for image captioning. The state-of-the-art image captioning models [15, 18, 13, 9, 27] adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract image features and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to decode these features into a sentence description. These models can be interpreted within a sequence-to-sequence [26] or encoder-decoder [6] framework, so it is natural to apply attention mechanisms in these models [29].\nAlthough impressive visualization results of the attention maps for image captioning are shown in [29], the authors do not provide quantitative evaluations of the attention maps generated by their models. This is a common issue for attention models, because defining and evaluating the attention maps can be hard for attention models for most tasks. However, an accurate quantitative metric is important and can provide further insight in understanding and improving attention models.\nIn this work, we propose a novel quantitative metric to evaluate the “correctness” of attention maps. We define “correctness” as the consistency between the attention maps generated by the model and those annotated by humans (i.e. the ground truth maps). We use the alignment annotation between image regions and noun phrase caption entities provided in the recently released Flickr30k Entities dataset [22] as our ground truth maps. Using this metric, we show that the attention model of [29] performs better than the uniform attention baseline, but still has big room for improvement in terms of attention consistency with humans.\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n09 55\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 3\n1 M\nay 2\nBased on this observation, we propose a simple but effective model with explicit supervision of the attention maps. The model can be used not only in situations where detailed ground truth attention maps are given (e.g. the Flickr30k Entities dataset [22]) but also when only the object categories of image regions (which is a much cheaper type of annotations compared to [22]) are available (e.g. MS COCO dataset [16]). Our experiments show that our models perform consistently and significantly better than the implicit attention counterpart in terms of both attention maps accuracy and the quality of the final generated captions in both scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that quantitatively measures the quality of attention in deep models and shows significant improvement by adding supervision to the attention module."

      "text" : "Image Captioning Models There has been growing interest in the field of image captioning, with lots of work demonstrating impressive results [15, 29, 18, 27, 9, 10, 13, 5]. However, it is not clear whether the captioning models truly understand and recognize the objects in the image while generating the captions. [29] proposed an attention model and qualitatively showed that the model can attend to specific regions of the image by visualizing the attention maps of a few images. We build on their work and take a step further by quantitatively measuring the quality of the attention maps, which offers insight into understanding and improving current image captioning models.\nDeep Attention Models Attention mechanism is an important property of human visual systems [23, 7]. Since deep neural networks are inspired by the structure of neurons in human brains, exploring the use of attention in these artificial models seems natural and promising.\nIn machine translation, [2] introduced an extra softmax layer in the RNN/LSTM structure that generates weights of the individual words of the sentence to be translated. This allowed the individual representations of the words to be preserved. In image captioning, [29] replaced the individual words in machine translation model by convolutional image features, allowing the model to attend to different areas of the image when generating words one by one. This model is discussed in details in section 3.1. [30] proposed to target attention on a set of concepts extracted from the image to generate image captions. In visual question answering, [4, 28, 32] proposed several models which attend to image regions or questions when generating an answer. But none of these models quantitatively evaluates the quality of the attention maps or imposes supervision on the attention.\nImage Description Datasets For image captioning, Flickr8k [12], Flickr30k [31], and MS COCO [16] are the most commonly used benchmark datasets. Each image in these datasets has 5 accompanying captions. The original annotations of these datasets do not have alignment between the image regions and the entities (e.g. noun phrases) in the captions. Plummer et al. [22] developed the original caption annotations in Flickr30k by providing the region to phrase correspondences. Specifically, they align the noun phrases in the captions to image regions using human annotators. In this work, we\nuse this dataset for constructing ground truth attention maps to evaluate the quality of the generated attention maps, as well as to train our strongly supervised attention model."

      "text" : "Xu et al. [29] was the first attempt to introduce attention models to image captioning. The model consists of three parts: the encoder which encodes the visual information (i.e. a visual feature extractor), the decoder which decodes the information into words, and the attention module which performs spatial attention.\nThe visual feature extractor produces L vectors that correspond to different spatial locations of the image: a = {a1, . . . ,aL}, ai ∈ RD. Given the visual features, the goal of the decoder is to generate a caption y of length C: y = {y1, . . . , yC}. We use yt ∈ RK to represent the one-hot encoding of yt, where K is the dictionary size.\nIn [29], an LSTM network [11] is used as the decoder:\nit = σ(WiEyt−1 + Uiht−1 + Zizt + bi) (1) ft = σ(WfEyt−1 + Ufht−1 + Zfzt + bf ) (2) ct = ftct−1 + ittanh(WcEyt−1 + Ucht−1 + Zczt + bc) (3) ot = σ(WoEyt−1 + Uoht−1 + Zozt + bo) (4) ht = ottanh(ct) (5)\nwhere it, ft, ct,ot,ht are input gate, forget gate, memory, output gate, and hidden state of the LSTM respectively. W,U,Z,b are weight matrices and biases. E ∈ Rm×K is an embedding matrix, and σ is the sigmoid function. The context vector zt ∈ RD is a dynamic vector that represents the relevant part of image feature at time step t. In Xu et al. [29]’s deterministic “soft” attention model,\nzt = L∑ i=1 αtiai (6)\nwhere αti is a scalar weighting of visual vector ai at time step t, defined as follows:\neti = fattn(ai,ht−1) αti = exp(eti)∑L\nk=1 exp(etk) (7)\nwhere fattn(ai,ht−1) is a function that determines the amount of attention allocated to image feature ai, conditioned on the LSTM hidden state ht−1. In [29], this function is implemented as a multilayer perceptron. Note that by construction ∑L i=1 αti = 1.\nThe output word probability is determined by the image zt, the previous word yt−1, and the hidden state ht: p(yt|a, yt−1) ∝ exp(Go(Eyt−1 +Ghht +Gzzt)) (8) where G are learned parameters. The loss function, ignoring the regularization terms, is the negative log probability of the ground truth words w = {w1, . . . , wC}:\nLt,cap = − log p(wt|a, yt−1) (9)"

Moreover, even if the ground truth of this alignment is provided in a dataset, the model in [29] will not be able to take advantage of this information to learn better attention function fattn(ai,ht−1). In this work, we seek to enforce attention correctness by introducing explicit supervision.\nConcretely, we first consider the case when the ground truth attention map β t = {βti}i=1,...,L is provided for ground truth word wt, with ∑L i=1 βti = 1. Since ∑L i=1 βti = ∑L i=1 αti = 1, they can be considered as two probability distributions of attention and it is natural to introduce the cross entropy loss on the attention map. For the words that do not have an alignment with an image region (e.g. “a”, “is”), we simply set Lt,attn as 0:\nLt,attn =\n{ − ∑L\ni=1 βti logαti if wt aligns with a ground truth region 0 otherwise\n(10)\nThe total loss is the weighted sum of the two loss terms:\nL = C∑ t=1 Lt,cap + λ C∑ t=1 Lt,attn (11)\nWe then discuss two ways of constructing the ground truth attention map β t, depending on the types of annotations available."

In this case, we are provided with a set of regions Rj in the image with associated object classes cj , j = 1, . . . ,M where M is the number of object bounding boxes or segments in the image. Although not ideal, these annotations contain important information to guide the attention of the model. For instance, for a caption of “a boy is playing with a dog”, the model should attend to the region of a person when generating the word “boy”, and attend to the region of a dog when generating the word “dog”. We can use this information to automatically find semantically related words in the sentences and regions with the object category labels in the image.\nFollowing this intuition, we set the likelihood that a word wt and a region Rj are aligned by the similarity of wt and cj in the word embedding space:\nβ̂t̂i = { sim(Ẽ(wt), Ẽ(cj)) î ∈ Rj 0 otherwise\n(13)\nwhere Ẽ(wt) and Ẽ(cj) denotes the embeddings of the word wt and cj respectively. Ẽ can be the embedding E learned by the model or any off-the-shelf word embedding. We then resize and normalize β̂ t in the same way as the strong supervision scenario."

      "heading" : "4 Attention Correctness: Evaluation Metric",
      "text" : "At each time step in the implicit attention model, the LSTM not only predicts the next word yt but also generates an attention map αt ∈ RL across all locations. However, the attention module is merely an intermediate step, while the error is only backpropagated from the word-likelihood loss in Equation 9. This opens the question whether this implicitly-learned attention module is indeed effective.\nTherefore in this section we introduce the concept of attention correctness, an evaluation metric that quantitatively analyzes the quality of the attention maps generated by the attention-based model.\n4.1 Definition\nFor a word yt with generated attention map αt, let Rt be the ground truth attention region, then we define the word attention correctness by\nAC(yt) = ∑ î∈Rt α̂t̂i (14)\nwhich is a score between 0 and 1. Intuitively, this value captures the sum of the attention score that falls within human annotation (see Figure 2 for illustration). α̂t = {α̂t̂i}î=1,...,L̂ is the resized and normalized αt in order to ensure size consistency.\nIn some cases a phrase {yt, . . . , yt+l} refers to the same entity, therefore the individual words share the same attention region Rt. We define the phrase attention correctness as the maximum of the individual scores1.\nAC({yt, . . . , yt+l}) = max(AC(yt), . . . , AC(yt+l)) (15) The intuition is that the phrase may contain some words whose attention map is ambiguous, and the attention maps of these words can be ignored\nby the max operation. For example, when evaluating the phrase “a group of people”, we are more interested in the attention correctness for “people” rather than “of”.\nWe discuss next how to find ground truth attention regions during testing, in order to apply this evaluation metric."

      "heading" : "4.2 Ground Truth Attention Region During Testing",
      "text" : "In order to compute attention correctness, we need the correspondence between regions in the image and phrases in the caption. However, in the testing stage, the generated caption is often different from ground truth captions. This makes evaluation difficult, because we only have Rt for the phrases in the ground truth caption, but not any possible phrase. To this end, we propose two strategies.\nGround Truth Caption One option is to enforce the trained model to output the ground truth sentence by resetting yt at each time step. This procedure to some extent allows us to “decorrelate” the attention module from the captioning component, and diagnose if the learned attention module is meaningful. Since the generated caption exactly matches the ground truth, we can compute attention correctness for each noun phrase in the test set.\nGenerated Caption Another option is to align the entities in the generated caption to those in the ground truth caption. For each image, we first extract the noun phrases of the generated caption using POS tagger (e.g. Stanford Parser [17]), and see if there exists a word-by-word match in the set of noun phrases in the ground truth captions. For example, if the generated caption is “A dog jumping over a hurdle” and one of the ground truth captions is “A cat jumping over a hurdle”, we match the noun phrase “a hurdle” appearing in both sentences."

      "text" : "Implicit/Supervised Attention Models All implementation details strictly follow [29]. We resize the image such that the shorter side has 256 pixels, and then center crop the 224× 224 image. We then extract the conv5_4 feature of the 19 layer version of VGG net [24] pretrained on ImageNet [8]. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent with the Adam algorithm [14]. Dropout [25] is used as regularization. We use the hyperparameters provided in the publicly available code2. Specifically, we set the number of LSTM units to 1300 for Flickr30k and 1800 for COCO.\nGround Truth Attention for Strong Supervision Model We experiment with our model in section 3.2.1 on Flickr30k dataset [31]. We use the Flickr30k Entities dataset [22] for generating ground\n1In the experiments, we found that changing the definition from maximum to average does not affect our main conclusion.\n2https://github.com/kelvinxu/arctic-captions\ntruth attention maps. For each entity (noun phrase) in the caption, the Flickr30k Entities dataset provides the corresponding bounding box of the entity in the image. Therefore ideally, the model should “attend to” the marked region when predicting the associated words. We evaluate on noun phrases only, because for other types of words (e.g. determiner, preposition) the attention might be ambiguous and meaningless.\nGround Truth Attention for Weak Supervision Model The MS COCO dataset [16] contains instance segmentation masks of 80 classes in addition to the captions, which makes it suitable for our model with weak supervision in section 3.2.2. We only construct β t for the nouns in the captions, which we extract using the Stanford Parser [17]. The similarity function is chosen to be the cosine distance between word vectors [19] pretrained on GoogleNews3, and we set an empirical threshold of 1/3.\nThe β t generated in this way still contains obvious errors, primarily because word2vec cannot distinguish well between objects and scenes. For example, the similarity between the word “kitchen” and the object class “spoon” is above threshold. But when generating a scene word like “kitchen”, the model should be attending to the whole image instead of focusing on a small object like “spoon”.\nTo address this problem, we refer to the supplement of [16], which provides a scene category list containing key words of scenes used when collecting the dataset. Whenever some word in this scene category list appears in the caption, we set β t to be uniform, i.e. equal attention across image. This greatly improves the quality of β t (see illustration in Figure 3)."

      "text" : "In this subsection, we quantitatively evaluate the attention correctness of both the implicit and the supervised attention model. All experiments are conducted on the 1000 test images of Flickr30k. We compare the result with uniform baseline, which attends equally across the whole image. Therefore the baseline score is simply the percentage of the bounding box size over the size of the whole image. The results are summarized in Table 1.\nGround Truth Caption Result In this setting, both implicit and supervised models are forced to produce exactly the same captions, resulting in 14566 noun phrase matches. We discard those with no attention region or full image attention (as the match score will be 1 regardless of the attention map). For each of the remaining matches, we resize the original attention map from 14× 14 to 224× 224 and perform normalization before we compute the attention correctness for this noun phrase.\n3https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/\nBoth models are evaluated in Figure 4a. The horizontal axis is the improvement over baseline, therefore a better attention module should result in a distribution further to the right. On average, both models perform better than the baseline. Specifically, the average gain over uniform attention baseline is 6.22% for the implicit attention model [29], and 11.14% for the supervised version. Visually, the distribution of the supervised model is further to the right towards the oracle (where attention correctness is 1 for every match). This indicates that although the implicit model has captured some aspects of attention, the model learned with strong supervision has a better attention module.\nIn Figure 5 we show some examples where the supervised model successfully recovered the spatial location of the underlined entity, while the implicit model attends to the wrong region.\nGenerated Caption Result In this experiment, our algorithm is able to align 883 noun phrases for the implicit model and 901 for the supervised version. Since the word-by-word match strategy is rather conservative, these alignments are correct and reliable, as verified by manual check. Similarly, we discard those with no attention region or full image attention, and perform resize and normalization before we compute the correctness score.\nThe results are shown in Figure 4b. In general the conclusion is the same: the supervised attention model produces attention maps that are more consistent with human judgment. In terms of numbers, the average improvement over the uniform baseline is 12.07% for the implicit model and 18.19% for the supervised model, which is a 50% relative gain.\nIn Figure 6 we provide some qualitative results. These examples show that for the same entity, the supervised model produces more human-like attention than the implicit model."

In this subsection we give experimental support by showing that the supervised attention model also provides better captioning performance.\nWe report BLEU [21] and METEOR [3] scores to allow comparison with [29]. In Table 2 we show both the scores reported in [29] and our implementation. Note that our implementation of [29] gives slightly improved result over what they reported.

    "abstractText" : "Attention mechanisms have recently been introduced in deep learning for various tasks in natural language processing and computer vision. But despite their popularity, the “correctness” of the implicitly-learned attention maps has only been assessed qualitatively by visualization of several examples. In this paper we focus on evaluating and improving the correctness of attention in neural image captioning models. Specifically, we propose a quantitative evaluation metric for how well the attention maps align with human judgment, using recently released datasets with alignment between regions in images and entities in captions. We then propose novel models with different levels of explicit supervision for learning attention maps during training. The supervision can be strong when alignment between regions and caption entities are available, or weak when only object segments and categories are provided. We show on the popular Flickr30k and COCO datasets that introducing supervision of attention maps during training solidly improves both attention correctness and caption quality.",
