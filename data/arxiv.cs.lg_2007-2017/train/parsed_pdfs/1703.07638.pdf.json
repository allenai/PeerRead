      "text" : "As of today the programming language of the vast majority of the published source code is manually specified or programmatically assigned based on the sole file extension. In this paper we show that the source code programming language identification task can be fully automated using machine learning techniques. We first define the criteria that a production-level automatic programming language identification solution should meet. Our criteria include accuracy, programming language coverage, extensibility and performance. We then describe our approach: How training files are preprocessed for extracting features that mimic grammar productions, and then how these extracted ‘grammar productions’ are used for the training and testing of our classifier. We achieve a 99% accuracy rate while classifying 29 of the most popular programming languages with a Maximum Entropy classifier.\nIndex Terms Classification algorithms, Computer languages, Information entropy"

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "The need for source-code-to-programming-language classification arises in use cases such as syntax highlighting, source code repositories indexing and estimation of trends in programming language popularity.\nPopular syntax highlighters take different approaches: SyntaxHighlighter[1] and many other such tools ask the user to\nannotate the source code with the name of the matching programming language, which effectively boils down to manual\nprogramming language identification. Highlight.js[2] on the other hand uses the success-rate of the highlighting process to\nidentify the language: Rare language constructs are given more weight while ubiquitous constructs such as common numbers\nhave no weight at all; And there are also constructs defined as illegal that cause the parser to drop the highlighting attempt for\na given language. Google Code Prettify[3] finally bypasses the programming identification hurdle altogether by generalizing\nthe highlighting so it will work independently of the language.\nThe approach for the labelling of source code varies also when it comes to source code repositories: SourceForge[4] does not maintain the programming language on the source code file level, it merely stores the programming language of the project as a whole as manually specified by the project submitter. GitHub[5]’s approach is more sophisticated: It uses the Linguist[6] library, which applies following cascade of strategies to identify the programming language of the submitted source code:\n1. Detect Emacs/Vim modelines\n2. Looksfor a shebang “#!/…”\n3. Check if file extension is unique for the language\n4. Heuristics - are there any tell-tale syntax sequences that we can use to identify the language\n5. Naïve Bayesian classification\nLinguist stops when a single programming language candidate is left. Note that identification by unique file extension (strategy 3) has precedence over machine-learning-based classification (strategy 5).\nThe ideal of automatic computation goes back to Charles Babbage’s wish to eliminate the risk of error in the production of printed mathematical tables. To make the automatic computation ideal practically applicable, one has to consider aspects such as use cases coverage, performance, maintenance and testing. We argue that the automatic solution for programming language identification should be evaluated based on following criteria:\n1. Accuracy\nThe accuracy of the results must be evaluated on a data set collected from as many different sources as possible. As stated by Brian W. Kernighan[7] “Computer programs can be written many different ways and still achieve the same effect … We have come to learn, however, that functionally equivalent programs can have extremely important stylistic differences”. Note that absolute accuracy is unattainable because of the existence of polyglots – source code valid for more than a single programming language.\n2. Popular programming languages support [8][9]\nNote that there are at least 20 programming languages with popularity rates exceeding 1%. And over 50 languages that pass the 0.1% mark.\n3. Extensibility in a reasonable amount of effort and time\nProgramming language popularity is dynamic and may exhibit fluctuations of a few percent in any one-year period. Moreover new programming languages emerge all the time e.g. Swift 2014.\n4. Independence of file extension\nA file extension will not be available for snippets, short portions of code as posted on question and answer sites such as Stack Overflow [10] Moreover, even when available, file extensions can be ambiguous (.h .m .pl) or just plainly wrong.\n5. Performance\nWe define performance as the time required for the identification of the programming language of a single source file. Programming language identification will be embedded into real-time human-computer interactions and should not increase the response time of the whole process significantly.\nDespite its many practical applications automated programming language identification has received moderate attention from research. We have summed up the various attempts known to us based on our evaluation criteria as described above in Table 1.\nKennedy van Dam et al.

      "heading" : "2. METHOD",
      "text" : "One can hypothesize the best approach for identifying the programming language of a piece of source code to be the selection of the language whose grammar parses the code successfully. Such a method cannot be implemented in practice for a number of reasons: First, to obtain a grammar for each language we try to identify is hardly possible. For example “C++ is pretty much impossible to parse by merely writing up its grammar” – Terence Parr, the author of ANTLR [15]. Second, the maintenance cost of grammars will be extremely high as languages evolve and new languages emerge over time. Finally the need to run the source code against every available parser would inevitably negatively impact performance.\nOur chosen approach is to automatically derive a single grammar from the training data that will later in the process be used for parsing every training and test file. The grammar includes the most representative productions for every language in the training set. The ability to build such a common grammar automatically relies on the fact that programming languages share a common syntax structure, with building blocks such as keywords, identifiers, constants and statements. As Aho [17] p. 112 et al. states “In many programming languages, the following classes cover most or all of the tokens:\n One token for each keyword. The pattern for a keyword is the same as the keyword itself.\n Tokens for the operators, either individually or in classes such as the token comparison.\n One token representing all identifiers.\n One or more tokens representing constants, such as numbers and literal strings.\n Tokens for each punctuation symbol, such as left and right parentheses, comma, and semicolon.”\nOnce built the grammar is run against the source code files from the training set: The most representative grammar productions for each language are at this stage of the process selected to be used as features by the language classifier.\nOnce the feature set has been defined the classifier can be trained. Classifier training is a process in which a weight is assigned to each (feature, language) pair. Features (grammar productions) found more frequently in the training set for a particular language than in the training files for other languages will be assigned a higher weight for that language.\nOnce the classifier has been trained we run it on our test set to measure its accuracy: Each test file is parsed and matched grammar productions are extracted and fed to the trained classifier, which outputs probabilities for each language represented in the training set. To estimate the classifier accuracy, we compare the language for which the classifier returned the highest probability to the actual language of the test file.\nNote that the distribution of grammar productions is assumed to be very similar in the training and test sets. This is a key assumption for obtaining a high classification accuracy rate on the test set.\nIn the next subsections we provide a detailed description of the grammar construction, classifier training and classifier testing processes."

      "heading" : "2.1 File Preprocessing",
      "text" : "Any source code file, whether from the training or from the test set, first goes through some preliminary file preprocessing as detailed below.\nDiagram 1 File Preprocessing\nA conversion of all letters to lowercase is required since some programming languages (as e.g. Ada, Visual BASIC, GW Basic, Quite Basic, FORTRAN, SQL and Pascal) are case-insensitive.\nClassical lexical analysis (see Appendix A) converts parsed source code into a stream of tokens. The lexer splits the source code into tokens by using white space characters as separators. Before applying the lexer we insert whitespaces between alpha, numeric and punctuation sequences as part of the file preprocessing since each such sequence represents a different type of token.\nAll numeric sequences are considered as constants and we replace each numeric sequence with a generic ‘number’ token __d__.\n__BOF__ and __EOF__ (beginning and end of file) tokens are inserted at the beginning and at the end of file. The rationale behind this addition is that some statements like java package declaration can appear only at the beginning or the end of the file.\nConsecutive new line characters ae replaced with a single __NL__ token since statements in languages like Basic, FORTRAN and Matlab are separated by a new line.\nExample 1. File Preprocessing\nsource code fragment ‘FUNCTION(“123”)’ will be split into ‘function (“ __d__ “)’."

To decide whether the word is an actual keyword or an identifier, we calculate the word frequency in the training files for the language being processed. The word frequency is expressed as the number of training files in which the word was found divided by total number of training files for the particular language. Words whose frequency exceeds 0.01 are considered as language keywords and replaced with a token of the same pattern i.e. the word \"if\" is replaced with a token \"if\". Words with a frequency below 0.01 are considered as identifiers. Alpha identifiers are replaced with the generic __a__ token and punctuation identifiers are replaced with __s__.\nNote that, when calculating word frequencies, we deliberately skip language comments. Text such as copyright statement is not part of the language and should not be used for the language grammar extraction. The comments syntax is the only actual programming language syntax rule we have hardwired, all other grammar productions are derived from the training set in a next step as described below.\nExample 2. Keywords and identifiers replacement\nPreprocessed training file:\n< ul class =” democrats ”> __NL__\n< li > Clinton < / li > __NL__\n</ ul > __NL__\nInfrequent words democrats and Clinton are replaced with identifier token __a__, while frequent words such as class are replaced with a token of the same pattern:\n< ul class =” __a__ ”> __NL__\n< li > __a__ </ li > __NL__\n</ ul > __NL__\nIn a second step we extract all unigrams, bigrams and trigrams from the token stream output of the first step. These extracted n-grams are the candidates for our grammar production selection process.\nExample 3. N-grams as extracted from Example 2. Unigrams: <, ul, class, =”, __a__, \">, >, __NL__, li, </ Bigrams: < ul, ul class, class =”, =\" __a__, __a__ ”> , \"> __NL__, __NL__ <, < li, li >, > __a__, __a__ </, </ li, > __NL__, __NL__ </, </ ul, ul >\nTrigrams: < ul class, ul class =”, class =” __a__, =” __a__ ”>, __a__ ”> __NL__, ”> __NL__ <, __NL__ < li, < li >, li > __a__, > __a__ </, __a__ </ li, </ li >, li > __NL__, > __NL__ </, __NL__ </ ul, </ ul >, ul > __NL__\nThe third and last step of our grammar construction process is the selection of the most informative grammar productions from the n-gram set generated during the second step. We use the MI (Mutual Information) index to determine which n-grams should be retained as grammar productions. The MI index measures how much information the presence/absence of a feature contributes to making the correct classification decision.\nIf f is a nominal feature with k different values and l is your target class with m classes, the MI of f is given by:\nEquation 1. Mutual Information\n)()(\n),( log),(\n1 1 ji\nji\nj\nk\ni\nm\nj\ni lpfP\nlfP lfPMI \n \n\nCompute mutual information > 0.05 Grammar productions Yes\nIn our case k=2 and 1f =0/ 2f =1 denote absence/presence of a grammar production in a training file. Our m=29, the number of classified programming languages.\nOnly n-grams with an MI index above 0.05 make it into our grammar.\nExample 4. Grammar productions as selected from example 3 (MI above 0.05 threshold) followed by MI value class 0.297, __NL__ < 0.203, __NL__ </ 0.189, > __NL__ </ 0.180, \"> __NL__ 0.167, \"> __NL__ < 0.163, class =\" 0.143, ul 0.109, _NL__ < li 0.093, __NL__ </ ul 0.089, __a__ \"> __NL__ 0.071, ul class 0.0589, ul class =\" 0.0584, < ul class 0.0576, class =\" __a__ 0.0546"

      "text" : "We have opted for a maximum entropy (maxent) classifier. \"The motivating idea behind maximum entropy is that one should prefer the most uniform models that also satisfy any given constraints.\" [16]. A nice property of the maxent classifier, as can be seen from the discussion below, is that no assumption is made on the relationships between features (our ‘grammar productions’). For example an assumption on feature independency is not required. Since grammar productions are clearly\ndependent, the maxent classifier seemed like a promising classifier choice for our particular use case.\nTo project the programming language identification task onto the maximum entropy model, we define the following notation:\nL the set of all supported languages jl\nS the set of all preprocessed training files l(s) the programming language of the training file s\nG the set of all grammar productions ig we have extracted in 2.2\n),(, lsg ji a grammar production indicator function from S x L to {0,1}.

The lexical grammar is language-aware, so that it knows to skip comments for each language and only include words in the actual code. Then we apply an additional lexical analysis pass, in which each alpha and punctuation token in the language training set is converted to either the specific matching keyword or a generic identifier depending on the frequency of the word in the training set (the threshold for a word to be considered as a keyword for a particular language is 1 %, ie the word has to be present in at least 1% of all the training files selected for the language).\nWe use the WEKA v. 3.7.13 [18] software package for feature extraction and selection: We first apply the StringToWordVector WEKA filter with the NGramTokenizer procedure on the lexer output for each training file. This filter extracts all possible unigrams, bigrams and trigrams from the normalized token stream and adds them to the global grammar production set. This set is further filtered to merely retain the most informative grammar productions. This is achieved by applying the InfoGainAttributeEval WEKA filter, which calculates the Mutual Information index of each feature in the set (see Equation 1) and filters out any feature with a MI index lower than a specified threshold value ( in our case 0.05).\nThe final grammar consists of 47,147 productions, 5,327 of which are unigrams, 18,687 bigrams and 23,133 trigrams.\n3.4 Classifier training and testing"

In this paper we show that the source code programming language identification task can be fully automated using machine learning techniques. We first define the criteria that a production-level automatic programming language identification solution should meet. Our criteria include accuracy, programming language coverage, extensibility and performance. We then describe our approach: How training files are preprocessed for extracting features that mimic grammar productions, and then how these extracted ‘grammar productions’ are used for the training and testing of our classifier. We achieve a 99% accuracy rate while classifying 29 of the most popular programming languages with a Maximum Entropy classifier.",
