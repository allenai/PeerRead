      "text" : "Possibilistic logic offers a qualitative frame work for representing pieces of information associated with levels of uncertainty or pri ority. The fusion of multiple sources infor mation is discussed in this setting. Differ ent classes of merging operators are consid ered including conjunctive, disjunctive, rein forcement, adaptive and averaging operators. Then we propose to analyse these classes in terms of postulates. This is done by first ex tending the postulates for merging classical bases to the case where priorities are avail able.\n1 Introduction\nPossibilistic logic (e.g. [8]) offers a framework for rea soning with classical logic formulas associated with weights belonging to a totally ordered scale. Weights, which technically speaking are lower bounds of neces sity measures, can either represent the certainty with which the associated formula is held for true, or the expression of a preference under the form of a level of priority. In this case the formula encodes a goal (rather than a piece of know ledge) which has to be considered. The fusion of information expressed in a logical form has raised an increasing interest in the recent past years [1, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14]. Indeed this problem nat urally occurs when handling multiple sources of infor mation, and trying to extract the common, conflict free part of the information, or when trying to fuse the goals expressed by several agents. Clearly possibilis tic logic, which offers a representation framework more expressive than the one of classical logic, by allowing for an explicit stratification of the sets of formulas, is well-suited for handling levels of certainty or priority in the fusion process. In recent works [3, 5], the authors have on the one hand provided a possibilistic syntactic\ncounterpart of combination operations defined on pos sibility distributions defined on sets of interpretations. On the other hand, taking advantage of the fact that a classical logic formula can be always associated with a stratified set of formulas (using Hamming distance as suggested by Dalal [7]) which reflects partial levels of satisfaction of the initial formula, the authors have shown the agreement of the possibilistic logic-based approach with the recent proposals on fusion in the classical logic setting. In this paper we make a step further by i) distinguish ing between different classes of combination operations capable of coping with redundancy, or with drowning effects of \"inconsistency-free\" formulas [2] encountered in case of conflicts when weights are just combined by a simple operator like min, and ii) by analysing these classes firstly in terms of information sets that each class retains, and secondly in terms of postulates which are natural extensions of those recently proposed in the classical framework [10, 11, 12]. After briefly recalling the necessary background on possibilistic logic in Sec tion 2, general classes of combination operators are introduced and studied in Section 3. The handling of the global reliability of the sources or of priorities be tween agents is also briefly considered in this section. A discussion with respect to postulates is presented in Sections 4 and 5.\n2 Possibilistic logic and fusion\nThis section recalls some basic notions of possibilistic logic. See [8] for more details. Let .C be a finite propo sitionnal language. f- denotes the classical consequence relation and n is the set of classical interpretations.\n2.1 Possibility distributions\nAt the semantic level, possibilistic logic is based on the notion of a possibility distribution, denoted by 1r, which is a mapping from n to [0,1] representing the available information. 1r(w) represents the degree of\nUNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000 25\ncompatibility of the interpretation w with the avail able beliefs about the real world if we are representing uncertain pieces of knowledge (or the degree of satis faction of reaching state w if we are modelling pref erences). By convention, 1r(w) = 1 means that it is totally possible for w to be the real world (or that w is fully satisfactory), 1 > 1r(w) > 0 means that w is only somewhat possible (or satisfactory), while 1r(w) = 0 means that w is certainly not the real world (or not satisfactory at all). Associated with a possibility dis tribution 1r is the necessity degree of any formula ¢: N ( ¢;) = 1- II( •¢) which evaluates to what extent ¢; is entailed by the available beliefs, and defined from the consistency degree of a formula ¢; w.r.t. the available information, II(¢) = max{1r(w) : w E [¢]}, where [¢] denotes the set of all the models of ¢;. In the rest of the paper, a, b, c, ... reflect the possibility degrees of the interpretations.\n2.2 Possibilistic logic bases\nAt the syntactic level, uncertain information is repre sented by means of a possibilistic knowledge base which is a set of weighted formulas B = {( ¢;;, a;) : i = 1, n} where ¢;; is a classical formula and a; belongs to a totally ordered scale such as [0,1]. (¢;;, a;) means that the certainty degree of ¢;; is at least equal to a; ( N ( ¢;) 2: a;). We denote by B* the classical base as sociated with B obtained by forgetting the weights. A possibilistic base B is consistent iff its classical base B* is consistent. In the following, a, /3, 1, ... reflect the necessity degrees associated with formulas. Given B, we can generate a unique possibility distribu tion, denoted by 1TB, such that all the interpretations satisfying all the beliefs in B will have the highest pos sibility degree, namely 1, and the other interpretations will be ranked w.r.t. the highest belief that they fal sify, namely we get [8]:\nDefinition 1 Vw E n,\n( ) { 1 iJ V (c/J;,a; ) E B,w E [c/J;] 1TB W = 1- max{ a;: w rf. [¢;]} othe rwise . Further definitions used in the paper are now given:\nDefinition 2 Let B be a possibilistic knowledge base, and a E [0, 1]. We call the a-cut (resp. strict a-cut) of B, denoted by B?_a (resp. B>a), the set of classical formulas in B having a certainty degree at least equal to a ( resp. strictly greater than a).\nDefinition 3 B and B' are said to be equivalent, de noted by B =• B', iffVa E [0, 1], B?.a = B�a' where = is the classical equivalence. -\nInc( B) = max{ a; : B?_a; is inconsistent} denotes the inconsistency degree of B. When B is consistent, we have Inc(B) = 0. Subsumption can now be defined:\nDefinition 4 Let (¢;, a) be a belief in B. Then, (¢;,a) is said to be subsumed by B if (B- { (¢,a)})>a 1-¢. (¢,a) is said to be strictly subsumed by B if B>a 1- ¢.\nIt can be checked that if ( ¢;, a) is subsumed, then B and B' = B- { (¢,a)} are equivalent [8]. Lastly, weights are propagated in the inference process:\nDefinition 5 A possibilistic formula (¢;,a), with a > Inc(B), is said to be a consequence of B, denoted by B l-1r (¢,a), iff B?_a 1-¢;.\n2.3 Syntactic fusion\nWe first recall a general result underlying the fusion process in possibilistic logic [5]. Let B1, B2 be two possibilistic bases, and 1T1 and 1r2 be their associated possibility distributions. Let EB be a two place function whose domain is [0, 1] x [0, 1] (to be used for aggregating 1r1 (w) and 1r2(w)). The only requirements for EB are the following properties: i. 1 EB1= 1, ii. If a 2: c, b 2: d then a EBb 2: c EB d (monotonicity). The first one acknowledges the fact that if two sources agree that w is fully possible (or satisfactory), then the result should confirm it. The second one expresses that a degree resulting from a combination cannot de crease if the combined degrees increase. In [5], it has been shown that the syntactic counterpart of the fusion of 1T1 and 1r2 is the following possibilistic base, denoted by B$ (and sometimes by B1 EB B2) and which is made of the union of: - the initial bases with new weights defined by:\n{(¢;, 1-(1-a;)EIH): (¢;,a;) E B1}u {('1/>j, 1-1EB(1-.61)):(,Pj,.6j)EB2} (1)\n- and the knowledge common to B1 and B2 defined by: {(</l;V'I/>1, 1-(1-a;)EB(1-.6j)):(¢;,a;)EB! and ('l/>1,.61)EB2}\nIt has been shown that 1TBal(w) = 1T1(w) EB1r2(w) where 7rBal is the possibility distribution associated to B$ us ing Definition 1. In the case of n sources, the syntactic computation of the resulting base can be easily applied when EB is associative. Note that it is also possible to provide syntactic counterpart for non-associative fusion oper ator. In this case EB is no longer a binary operator, but a n-ary operator applied to vectors of possibil ity distributions. The syntactic counterpart is as fol lows: Let B= (B1 , ... , Bn) be a vector of possibilistic bases. Let (rr1, · · · , 7rn) be their associated possibil ity distributions and 1TBa:J be the result of combining\n26 UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000\n(7rt, ... ,?Tn) with Ef). Then, the base associated to 1l\"l3Ell is: B!JJ ={(Dj, 1- x1 Ef) ... Ef) Xn ) : j = 1, n}, where Dj are disjunctions of size j between formulas taken from different B; 's ( i = 1, n) and x; is either equal to 1-o:; or to 1 depending if c/J; belongs to Dj or not.\n3 Possibilistic merging operators\nThis section analyses several classes of Ef) which cope with different issues met in merging multiple sources information. In the rest of this paper, we assume that Ef) is associative.\n3.1 Conjunctive operators\nOne of the important aims in merging uncertain in formation is to exploit complementarities between the sources in order to get a more complete and precise global point of view. Since we deal with prioritized information, two kinds of complementarities can be considered depending on whether we refer to formulas only, or to priorities attached to formulas. In this sub section, we introduce conjunctive operators which ex ploit the symbolic complementarities between sources.\nDefinition 6 Ef) is said to be a conjunctive operator if Va E [0, 1],a EB 1 = 1 Ef) a =a.\nThe following proposition shows indeed that conjunc tive operators, in case of consistent sources of infor mation, exploit their complementarities by recovering all the symbolic information.\nProposition 1 Let B1 and B2 be such that Bi 1\\ B2 is consistent. Let Ef) be a conjunctive operator. Then, B$= Bi 1\\ B2.\nAn important feature of a conjunctive operator is its ability to give preference to more specific information. Namely, if an information source S1 contains all the information provided by S2, then combining St and S2 with a conjunctive operator leads simply to St:\nProposition 2 Let B1 and B2 be such that V ( 'lj;, (3) E B2,B1 f-rr (¢,(3). Then, B(B:= Bi.\nAn example of a conjunctive operator is the minimum (for short min), for which we can easily check that B!JJ = B1 U B2. Other examples are the product, and the geometric average defined by a Ef) b = ..fCib.\n3.2 Disjunctive operators\nAnother important issue in fusion information is how to deal with conflicts. When all the sources are equally reliable and conflicting, then one should avoid arbi trary choice by inferring all information provided by\none of the sources. Namely, if B1 U B2 is inconsistent, then one can require that B!JJ neither infers B1 nor B2. Such a behaviour cannot be captured by any con junctive operator (See Section 5). This requirement is captured by the disjunctive operators defined by:\nDefinition 7 Ef) is said to be a disjunctive operator if Va E [0, 1],a EB 1 = 1 Ef) a = 1.\nThen, we have:\nProposition 3 Let B1 and B2 be such that Bi 1\\ B2 is inconsistent. Then, there exist (c/J, o:) E B1 and (1j;,(3) E B2 such that B!JJiirr (c/J,o:) and B!JJiirr (¢,(3).\nNote that if Ef) is a disjunctive operator then B!JJ is of the form: B!JJ = {(c/J; V 1/Jj, 1- (1- o:;) Ef) (1- {3j))}. Now, a second natural requirement that one may ask for, in case of conflicts, is to recover the disjunction of all the symbolic information provided by the sources. Clearly, it is easy to find a disjunctive operator which does not satisfy this second requirement. A trivial case is to take the \"vacuous\" disjunctive operator defined by: Va, Vb, a Ef) b = 1. To satisfy this second requirement we define the notion of regular disjunctive operator:\nDefinition 8 A disjunctive operator Ef) is said to be regular if Va -=F 1, Vb -=F 1, a Ef) b -=F 1.\nThen, we have:\nProposition 4 Let B1 and B2 be two bases and Ef) be a regular disjunctive operator. Then, B$= Bi V B2.\nExamples of regular disjunctive operators are the max, the so-called \"probabilistic sum\" defined by: a Ef) b = a+ b - ab, and the dual of the geometric av erage defined by a Ef) b = 1- J(l- a) (l- b). Lastly, note that regular disjunctive operators are not appropriate in the case of consistency between sources; in particular they give preference to less specific infor mation.\n3.3 Idempotent operators\nAnother important problem in fusing multiple sources information is how to deal with redundant informa tion. There are two different situations: either we ignore the redundancies, which is suitable when the sources are not independent, or we view redundancy as a confirmation of the same information provided by independent sources. Idempotent operations are de fined by:\nDefinition 9 EB is said to be an idempotent operator if \"'a E [0, 1], a Ef) a = a.\nUNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000 27\nIdempotent operators aim to ignore direct redundan cies. Namely, if two sources of information entail the same formula ¢ to a degree a, then one may require that the fused base should not entail ¢ with a degree higher than a. However, such a requirement is strong since ¢ can be obtained from another path exploiting complementarities between higher level formulas pro vided by the two sources. This is illustrated by the following example:\nExample 1 Let B1 == { (,P, .9); (¢, .2)} and B2 == {(¢ V •'If , .8); (¢, .2)}. Clearly B1 f-rr (¢, .2) and B2 f-rr (¢, .2). Now let EB be an idempotent operator defined by: a EB b == �. Then, B4 == {(,P, .45); (¢ V ,P, .55);(¢ V •'If , .5)} after removing subsumed formulas. We can easily check that B4f-rr (¢, .5) with .5 ?: .2. This is mainly due to the two pieces of information ( ,P, .9) and ( ¢ V •'If , .8), pro vided separately by the sources.\nNow, the following proposition shows the cases where idempotent operators indeed ignore redundancies:\nProposition 5 Let B1 and B2 be two bases, and EB be an idempotent operator. Let ¢ be such that B1 f-rr (¢,a); B2 f-rr (¢, (3) with (3::; a. Let r == Bl>aUB2>a· Then, iff If¢ then B4f-rr (¢,!'), with I'::; max(a,(J).\nNote that I' may be equal to 0 in case of inconsistency. r in this proposition is the set of classical formulas in B1 and B2 having a weight strictly greater than a. If ¢ cannot be deduced from r then the idempotent property only guarantees that the repeated informa tion will not be inferred with a priority higher than the one with which it can be individually obtained from the different sources.\n3.4 Reinforcement operators\nThe aim of reinforcement operators is to view redun dancy of information as a confirmation of this infor mation. Namely, if the same piece of information is supported by two different sources, then the priority attached to this piece of information should be strictly greater than the one provided by the sources. A first formal class of reinforcement operators can be defined as follows:\nDefinition 10 EB is said to be a reinforcement opera tor if'Va, b # 1 and a, b # 0, a EBb< min( a, b).\nWe can easily check that if we aggregate the two pieces of information (¢,a) and (¢,(3), then the resulting base is: { (¢, f(a, ,B))} where f(a, (3) == 1- (1- a) EB (1- (3) > max(a, (3) for a, (3 E (0, 1). Besides, one can require that reinforcement opera tions recover all the common information with a higher\nweight. Namely if the same formula is a plausible con sequence of each base, then this formula should be accepted in the fused base with a higher priority. The following proposition shows a first case where this re sult holds:\nProposition 6 Let B1 and B2 be such that Bt 1\\ B2 is consistent. Let ¢ be such that B1 f-rr (¢,a) and B2 f-\" ( ¢, (3) where a and ,B are strictly positive. Let EB be a reinforcement operator. Then, Btf!f-rr (¢, f'), with I'> max(a,(J) if a,(J E (0, 1), and/'== 1 if a== 1 or (3 == 1.\nNow, in case of conflicts, and more precisely, in case of a strong conflict, namely Inc(B1 U B2) == 1, then the above proposition does not hold. Indeed, let B1 {(¢,1), (,P,a)} and B2 {(•¢, 1), (,P,(J)}. Then we can check that Inc(B4) == 1, so we cannot infer ,P from B4 since Inc(B1 UB2) == 1. Even if we add (,P, 1) to B1 UB2 explicitly then ,P can not be recovered. In possibilistic logic, when there is a strong conflict then only tautologies are plausible con sequences. In this case it is better to use a regular disjunctive operation. So the first condition is to avoid that Inc(B1 UB2) = 1. But this is not enough since even if Inc(B1 U B2) < 1 one can have I nc(B4 )= 1 due to the reinforcement effect which can push the priority of conflicting infor mation to the maximal priority allowed. For instance let us consider the excessively optimistic reinforcement operator defined by: \\Ia, 'Vb, a# 1, b # 1, a EBb = b EB a== 0. Then we can check that as soon as there is a conflict between the bases to be merged, the inconsistency de gree of the fuses base will reach the maximal value. The following definition focuses on a more interesting class of reinforcement operations:\nDefinition 11 A reinforcement operation EB is said to be progressive if \\Ia, b # 0, a EBb# 0.\nThe progressive operation guarantees that if some for mula (¢, a) with a> 0 is inferred by the sources then this formula belongs to B4 with a weight (3 such that a < ,B < 1. However, this new weight (3 can be less than the inconsistency degree of B4 and therefore ¢ will be drowned by the inconsistency of the database. This situation is illustrated by the following example:\nExample 2 Let B1 = {(¢ V ,P, .9); (¢, .5); (,P, .5); (�, .1)} and B2 = {(•¢ v •'If , .9); (•¢, .5); ( •'If , .5); (�, .1)}. Clearly, each base entails � which is largely below the inconsistency degree of B1 U B2. Now, let us compute B1 EB B2 with the product operator which is a progres sive operator. We get: B1 EB B2 = B1 U B2 U { ( ¢ V ,P V �' .91); (•¢V•'!fV� , .91); (¢V•,P, .75); (•¢V,P, .75); (¢V\n28 UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000\n�,.55); ('1/JV �,.55); (•¢V �,.55); (•1/J V �,.55); (�, .19)}. Note that there is a reinforcement on � since its new weight is .55 (which can be obtained for instance from (¢V�, .55) and (•¢V�, .55)). However, this new weight is less than the inconsistency degree of Btf! which is of .75, higher than Inc(B1 U B2) = .5.\nThe following proposition generalizes Proposition 6, and shows that if the inconsistency degree does not increase, then the common knowledge is entailed.\nProposition 7 Let B1 and B2 be such that Inc(B1 U B2) -=f 1. Let ¢ be such that B1 f-rr (¢, a) and B2 f-rr (¢, {3) with a > 0, f3 > 0. Let EB be a pro gressive reinforcement operation. Then, if Inc(Btf!)= Inc(B1 U B2) then, Btf!f-rr (¢, 1) with 1 > max( a, {3), and 1 = 1 if a= 1 or f3 = 1.\n3.5 Adaptive merging operators\nThe regular disjunctive operators appear to be ap propriate when the sources are completely conflicting. However, in the case of consistency, or of a low level of inconsistency regular disjunctive operators are very cautious. Besides, reinforcement is not appropriate in the case of complete conflicts. The aim of adaptive operators is to have a disjunctive behaviour in a case of complete contradiction and the progressive reinforcement behaviour in the other case. Let EBd and EBr be respectively a regular disjunctive and progressive reinforcement operators. Let h be ei ther equal to 1 or to 0. Then we define an adaptive operation, denoted by EBh, as follows: a EBh b = max(min(h, (a EBd b)), min(1- h, (a EBr b))). Then we have the following result:\nProposition 8 Let B1 and B2 be two possibilistic bases. Let h be equal to 1 if Inc(B1 UB2) = 1 and equal to 0 otherwise. Let EBh be an adaptive operator. If Inc(Btf!) = lnc(Bl U B2) then, V¢, if B1 f-rr (¢, a) and B2 f-rr (¢, {3) then we have: Btf!hf- (¢,1) with 1 > 0.\n3.6 Averaging operators\nA last class of merging operators which is worth considering is the so-called averaging operation, well known for aggregating preferences, and defined by:\nDefinition 12 EB is called an averaging operator if max( a, b) �a EBb� min( a, b), with EB -=f max and EB -=f min.\nOne example of averaging operators is the arithmetic mean a EBb= �- In this case, at the syntactic level, the result of combining B1 and B2 writes: {(¢;, Y)} U {('1/Jj, 13{)} U {(¢; V '1/Jj, a;�f3i )}. From this writing, in case of consistency we can check\n3. 7 Accounting for reliabilities of the sources\nThe possibilistic logic framework enables us to take also into account priorities between sources (or agents). Here priority may mean either that the sources are decreasingly ordered according to their re liability, or that a reliability degree is attached to each source. When we have just a reliability ordering and no commensurability assumption is made between the scales used for stratifying each source, the approach which can be used is known in social choice theory un der the name of \"dictatorship\". The idea is to refine one ranking by the other. More precisely, let rr1 and rr2 be two possibility distributions. Assume that 1r1 has priority over 1r2. The result of combination defined by: i. If 1r1(w) > 1r1(w') then 11\"fll(w) > 11\"fll(w') ii. If 1r1 (w) = 11\"1 (w') then 11\"fll(w) � 11\"fll(w') iff 1r2(w) � 11\"2 (w'). Clearly the combination result is simply the refinement of 1r1 (the dictator) by 1r2. Syntactic counterpart of this combination can be found in [5]. When a reliability degree is associated with each source, we may use weighted counterparts of oper ations EB. However in practice, it amounts to per forming a preliminary modification of the degrees at tached to formulas provided by each source and then to performing a non-weighted combination operation on the modified possibilistic bases. For instance, using the weighted min conjunction defined by Vw, 1rtf!(w) = mini=l,nmax(nj(w), 1 - Aj) (for Aj = 1, V j, the min combination is recovered). It amounts to per forming the union of discounted bases of the form Discount(B;, >.;) = {(¢, >.;)1(¢,{3) E B; and f3 � >.;} U{(¢, /3)1(¢, {3) E B; and f3 < >.;}. It is worth point ing out that discounting sources help solve conflicts between sources in a natural way.\n4 Postulates for classical merging\nLet us first introduce some additional notations. Let E = {K1, ... , Kn} (n � 1) be a multi-set of n propositional bases to be merged. E is called an infor mation set. 1\\E (resp. V E) denotes the conjunction (resp. disjunction) of the propositional bases of E. The symbol U denotes the union on multi-sets. For the sake of simplicity, if [{ and /{1 are proposi tional bases and E an information set we simply write EU[{ and KUK' instead of EU{ K} and { K}U{ K'} re spectively. We will denote [{n the multi-set {K, ... , K} of size n. A classical merging operator .6. is a function applied on E and which returns a classical base denoted by .6. (E). ' Koniesczny and Pino Perez [10] have proposed a set of\nUNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000 29\nbasic properties that a merging operator has to satisfy: (At) D.(E) is consistent; (A2) If E is consistent, then D.(E) = 1\\E; (A3) If E1 t+ E2, then 1-D.(E1) =: D.(E2); (A4) If K 1\\ K' is inconsistent, then D.(K UK') If K; (A5) D.(E1) 1\\ D.(E2) 1-D.(E1 U E2); (A6) If D.(E1) 1\\ D.(E2) is consistent, then D.(E1 U E2) 1- D.(El) 1\\ D.(E2); where E1 t+ E2 means that there exists a bijection f from E1 = { Kt, ... , K�} to E2 = {I<[, ... , Kn such that VK E E1, ::JK' E E2, f (K) =: K'. Liberatore [12], in the context of commutative belief revision, does not impose A1. He allows the result to be inconsistent if the bases to merge are individually inconsistent. Moreover, he gives another postulate in the same spirit as A4, namely: (A7) D.(I< U I<') 1- I< V K'. Two classes of merging operators have been partic ulary analysed in the literature: majority operators defined by: (Maj) VK, ::In, D.(EUKn) 1- I<, and arbitration operators defined by:\n(Arb) VK, Vn,D.(EUI<n) = D.(EUK).\n5 Postulates for possibilistic merging\nThis section relates the general classes of possibilis tic merging operations to the rational postulates re called in the previous section. But first we need an adaptation of these postulates in order to take into account the priorities attached to the information. A first immediate way of adapting the classical postu lates is to require that the result of the merging be a classical base. If BtiJ denotes the result of merging B= {B1, ... , Bn} with EB, then the classical base result ing from merging B; 's with EB is simply: D.tiJ(B)= {¢ : (¢,a) E BtiJ, a > Inc (BtiJ)}. However, restricting the result of merging prioritized bases to a classical base is not satisfactory. Indeed it leads to lose the associativity property of associa tive operators. The natural question is how to de fine D.tiJ (B1, D.tiJ (B2, B3)) since B1 is a stratified base, while D.tiJ(B2, B3) is a classical one. One way of en forcing the iteration is to give to formulas of the result ing classical base a weight equal to 1. However, this may violate the reliability of the formulas since formu las in D. til (B1, B2) which were very uncertain become fully reliable. The loss of associativity property is il lustrated by the following example:\nExample 3 Let B= { B1, B2, B3} such that B1 = { (¢, .8)}, B2 = { (•¢, .5); (�, .4)} and B3 = { (�, .3)}. Let EB = min. We have D.tiJ(B1, B2) = {¢}. To be able to merge this result with B3 we associate to ¢ a weight equal to 1, and we get D.tiJ (D.tiJ (Bl, B2), B3) = {¢,�}. We also have D.tiJ(B2,B3) {•¢, �} and\nD.tiJ (Bl,D.tiJ(B2,B3)) = {•¢, �}. Then, D.tiJ(D.tiJ(Bl, B2), B3) ;/= D.tiJ(B1, D.tiJ(B2, B3)).\n5.1 Adapting classical postulates\nWe focus on the approach where the result of the merg ing operation is a stratified base. Therefore, the pro cess of merging can be iterated. Let us now adapt the classical postulates recalled in Section 4. Let us adapt (A!). Possibilistic logic, contrary to clas sical logic, does not infer anything in the presence of inconsistency. Hence a partially inconsistent base BtiJ (with Inc (BtiJ)< 1) can be still meaningful, since plau sible conclusions can be inferred from it, by taking its consistent part, i.e. the set of formulas having a weight greater than I nc (BtiJ). Thus, the adaptation of (A!) can be weakened as follows: (Pi) BtiJ is not fully inconsistent,i.e., I nc(BtiJ) < 1. Note that if one insists on providing a consistent and stratified base as a result of fusion, then the associa tivity can be lost for associative operations.\nLet us adapt the second postulate (A2). Requiring an equivalence between BtiJ and B1 U · · · U Bn in the second postulate is very strong with stratified bases. For instance, assume that two identical formulas (¢,a) have to be aggregated. We have already seen that with a reinforcement operator we get ( ¢, j3) (j3 > a) as a re sult of the merging. So, we do not recover the initial weight of ¢. We propose to weaken A2 as follow: (P2) If B1 U · · · U Bn is consistent, then BtiJI-,. ( ¢, j3) iff B1 U · · · U Bn 1-,. (¢,1), with j3 > 0 and 1 > 0. This postulate implies that if Bi 1\\ ... 1\\B� is consistent, then Bffi=: Bi 1\\ · · · 1\\ B�.\nPostulates A3 and A4 have immediate counterparts: Let B= {B1, · · · , Bn} and B'= {B�, · · · , B�}. (P3) If B t+ B', then BtiJ=s B'tiJ, where B t+ B' means that there exists a bijection f from B to B' such that VB E B, ::IB' E B',f (B) =• B'. (P4) If B1 U B2 is inconsistent, then BtiJif,. B1 and BtiJif,. B2. Concerning postulates A5 and A6, notice that in clas sical logic, when D.(E1) 1\\ D.(E2) is inconsistent then A5 is trivially satisfied. Hence A5 is only meaningful when there is no conflict between the sources. There fore A5 and A6 are adapted as follows: (P5) If BtiJ is consistent with B' tiJ, then BtiJUB' tiJI-,.(BUB')tiJ. ( P6) If BtiJ is consistent with B' tiJ, then (BUB')tiJI-,. BtiJUB' tiJ · Let us now see how to adapt the postulate A7. The common knowledge in the prioritized case can be defined as follows: If B1 1-,. (¢ ,a) and B2 1-,. (¢, j3) , then BtiJI-,. (¢,1), with 1 > 0. Now, the question is how to fix the value of I · Ob-\n30 UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000\nviously 1 should not be greater than min (o:, {3). In deed assume that c > a 2: b, and B1 = { (c/>, o:)} and B2 = { (c/>, {3)} . Then it can be checked that (c/>, 1) is not a consequence of B2, which means that ( c/>, 1) can not be considered as a common information of B1 and B2. Therefore the adaptation of A1 is as follows: (P7) Vc/>, if B1 f-rr (c/>, o:) and B2 f-rr (c/>, {3) then BEJ)f-rr (c/>, 1) with 0 < 1:::; min (o:, {3).\nLastly, arbitration and majority have immediate ex tensions: (Arb) VB, Vn, (BuBn )4 '=s (BUB)4, and (Maj) VB,3n, (BuBn)4 f-rr B.\n5.2 Properties of the fusion operations\nThis section gives the properties of the classes of pos sibilistic operators introduced in Section 3. Proposition 9 shows that EEl is syntax independent.\nProposition 9 Any possibilistic merging operation satisfies P3.\nThe next proposition relates the property of idempo tency to the idea of arbitration:\nProposition 10 Any idempotent operation is an ar bitration operation.\nThe following proposition gives the properties of the regular disjunctive operations.\nProposition 11 Let EEl be a regular disjunctive oper ator. Then, EEl satisfies P1, P4, P5, P1 but may fail to satisfy P2, P6, M aj, Arb.\nCounter-examples : For P2, Ps and Maj we use the operator EB = max which is a regular disjunctive operation:\n• P2, Ps: Let B= {Bt,B2} with Bt = {(¢,.8)} and B2 = {(¢, .3}. Although BtU B2 is consistent, we have BEB ={(¢Vtjl, .3)} and we recover neither B; nor B;. Then, EB does not satisfy P2. It does not satisfy Ps for the same reason.\n• Maj: max is an idempotent operator, hence it is an arbitration operation, and cannot be a majority op erator.\nFor Arb, consider the probabilistic sum defined by: a EBb= a+ b- ab. Let B = { (¢,a)}. Then, one can easily check that B EBB = {(¢, 2a -a 2)} which is different from B ={(¢,a)}.\nProposition 12 Let EEl be a conjunctive operator. Then, EEl satisfies P2, P6 but may fail to satisfy P4, P5, P1, Arb, Maj.\nCounter-examples:\n• For P4 and P1, let us use the min since it is a con junctive operator.\nLet Bt = {(•¢, .6); (¢, .5)} and B2 = {(¢, .7)}. Since Inc( BEB)= .6, the useful information of BEB is {( ¢, . 7)} = B2. Then, ?4 is not satisfied. Let now B2 = {(¢,.7);(¢,.5)}. Then, (¢,.5) cannot be inferred from BEB, and P1 is not satisfied. min is idempotent, then it cannot be a majority op erator.\n• For P5 and Arb, let us consider the product which is a conjunctive operator. Let B= {Bt} and B'= {B2} s.t. Bt = {(¢, .5)} and B2 = {(¢,.6)}. We have BEB UB'EB= {(¢,.5);(¢,.6)} and (BuB')EB= {(¢, .5); (¢, .6); (¢v¢, .8)}. (4>V¢, .8) cannot be inferred from BEB U B' EB. Then, Ps is not satisfied. We also have Bt EB B2 = {(¢, .5); ( ¢, .6); ( 4> V ¢, .8)} and Bt EB B� = {(¢, .5); (¢, .84); (4> v ¢, .92)}, then Arb is not satisfied.\nThe following proposition relates the property of ma jority to the reinforcement property.\nProposition 13 Let B1 be a possibilistic base, and B2 another possibilistic base which is not conflicting with completely certain formulas of B1. Let EEl be a progres sive reinforcement operator. Denote by B� the combi nation of B2 n times with E£). Then, 3n, V ( '1/J, {3) E B2,\nB1 EEl B� f-rr ('1/J, 1) with 1 > {3, (t = 1 if {3 = 1}.\nThis proposition means that reinforcement operators are majority operators, in the sense that if the same piece of information is repeated enough times then this piece of information will be believed. This proposition does not hold if we only use rein forcement operations which are not progressive. For instance, consider the Luckasiewicz t-norm defined by: a EEl b = max(O, a+ b- 1). Then, for instance consider the bases B1 = { (c/>, .8)}, B2 = { (c/>, .8)} and B = { (•c/>, .7)} which are not completely conflicting. Then, we can easily check that Inc (B1 EEl B2 EEl B2) = 1 and hence B cannot be deduced. Indeed, we have B1 EEl B2 = { (c/>, 1)}, B2 = B EEl B = { (•c/>, 1)} . We now give the properties of progressive reinforce ment operators:\nProposition 14 Let EEl be a progressive reinforcement operator. Then, EEl satisfies P1 (provided that Inc (B1 U · · · U Bn) < 1}, P2, P6, P1 (provided that Inc(BEJ))= Inc (B1 U · · · U Bn) and Inc (B1 U · · · U Bn) < 1}, M aj but may fail to satisfy P4, P5, Arb.\nCounter-example: Let us use the product which is a progressive reinforcement operator.\n• ?4: Let Bt = {(¢, .6)} and B2 = {(•¢, .5)}. The useful information (above the level of inconsistency) of BEB is {( ¢, .6)} = Bt. Then, ?4 is not satisfied.\n• Ps, Arb: see the counter-example of Proposition 12.\nThe following proposition summarizes the properties of averaging operators:\nUNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROCEEDINGS 2000 31\nProposition 15 The Averaging operator satisfies P2, P4, P5, P6 and Arb but may fail to satisfy P7 and Maj.\nLastly, the following tree summarizes the considered operators, with the associated satisfied postulates:\nGeneral operator { P3} ./ '\\t\nConjunctive {P2, P6} ./ '\\t\nIdempotent {Pt2, Arb} Progressive reinforcement\n{P[, P13, Maj 4}\nRegular disjunctive {P11,P4, P5, P7}\n+ Idempotent{ Arb}\nNote that there exists conjunctive operators which do not satisfy P1 like Luckasiewicz t-norm. In the following table, we consider the three notice able possibilistic operators min, max and the product Pro. The symbol J (resp. -) means that the opera tor satisfies (resp. falsify) the postulate.\nPt P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P1 Arb Maj\nIn [3] we have shown that min and Pro operators are the possibilistic counterparts of max and I; re spectively, proposed in the classical merging [10, 11]. By comparing the above table with the one presented in [10] for classical merging operators we see that P4 is satisfied by max and I; operators but it is not by min and Pro. This is due to the presence of priorities in the possibilistic framework. Then in the presence of incon sistency, we may favor a base if its formulas are more reliable. Moreover, when the formulas are weighted we can express the reinforcement effect which explains that P5 is not satisfied by Pro.\n6 Conclusion\nPossibilistic logic acknowledges the presence of a strat ification between classical logic formulas in the infer ence process. This stratification which reflects cer tainty degrees or priorities is particularly useful for dealing with conflicts in the fusion process (even ap proaches to fusion in the classical logic setting use im plicit stratifications based on Dalal distance [7]). The logical setting is well suited in practice for express ing knowledge or preferences in a granular and high level way. Thus the typology of the fusion operations\n1even if Inc(B1 U · · · U Bn) = 1. 2if Inc(B1 U · · · U Bn) < 1. 3if Inc(BEB)= lnc(B1 U B2) and Inc(B1 U B2) < 1. 4if B does not contradict completely certain formulas.\nin the possibilistic setting provides a basis for design ing fusion systems able to propose a synthesis of par tially conflicting goals on the basis of some chosen type of combination, possibly taking into account priori ties between agents or sources. Lastly, this paper has analysed the possibilistic merging operators in terms of postulates. A message from Table 1 is that some postulates which make sense in classical fusion, like A4, are not appropriate for merging prioritized bases. Clearly, future work is to study new postulates proper for prioritized bases.\nReferences\n[1] C. Baral, S. Kraus, J. Minker, V.S. Subrahmanian.
