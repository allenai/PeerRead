      "text" : "Artificial Intelligence (AI), as defined by Russell and Norvig [43], is the study of general principles of rational agents and components for constructing these agents, i.e., designing machines that leverage various techniques to mimic ‘cognitive’ functions we intuitively associate with human minds, such as ‘learning’ and ‘problem solving.’ We interpret the term AI broadly to include closely-related areas such as machine learning [32]. Systems that heavily use AI, henceforth referred to as AI-based systems, have had a significant impact in society in domains that include healthcare, transportation, social networking, e-commerce, education, etc. This growing societal-scale impact has brought with it a set of risks and concerns including errors in AI software, cyber-attacks, and safety of AI-based systems [42, 13, 2]. Therefore, the question of verification and validation of AI-based systems has begun to demand the attention of the research community. We define “Verified AI” as the goal of designing AI-based systems that are proven to satisfy desired properties specified in a mathematical formalism. How can we achieve this goal?\nA natural starting point is to consider formal methods — a field of computer science and engineering concerned with the rigorous mathematical specification, design, and verification of systems [49, 11]. At its core, formal methods is about proof: formulating specifications that form proof obligations, designing systems to meet those obligations, and verifying, via algorithmic proof search, that the systems indeed meet their specifications. Verification techniques such as model checking [9, 40, 10] and theorem proving (see, e.g. [38, 25, 22]) are used routinely in the computer-aided design of integrated circuits and have been widely applied to find bugs in software, analyze embedded systems, and find security vulnerabilities. At the heart of these advances are computational proof engines such as Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers [31], Boolean reasoning and manipulation routines based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) [7], and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers [4].\nIn this paper, we consider the challenge of Verified AI from a formal methods perspective. Figure 1 shows the typical formal verification process, which begins with the following three inputs: 1. A model of the system to be verified, S; 2. A model of the environment, E, and\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n08 51\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 7\nJu n\n3. The property to be verified, Φ. The verifier generates as output a YES/NO answer, indicating whether or not S satisfies the property Φ in environment E. Typically, a NO output is accompanied by a counterexample, also called an error trace, which is an execution of the system that indicates how Φ is violated. Some formal verification tools also include a proof or certificate of correctness with a YES answer. In this paper, we use the term “formal\nverification” to apply to any verification technique that uses some aspect of formal methods. For instance, in hardware verification, the term “semi-formal verification” is often used for simulation-based verification methods that, while based on formal specifications (assertions), employ heuristic simulation-based methods to find behaviors that violate those specifications. Such semi-formal simulation-based verification methods have also found practical use in industrial verification of cyber-physical systems, e.g., for automotive systems.\nIn order to apply formal verification to AI-based systems, at a minimum, one must be able to generate the three inputs S, E and Φ in formalisms for which (ideally) there exist decision procedures to answer the YES/NO question as described above. Additionally, these decision procedures must be efficient. Meeting these requirements, however, is not straightforward. Indeed, in our view, the challenges for Verified AI stem directly from these requirements. We outline these challenges in Section 2 below, and describe ideas to address each of these challenges in Section 3."

      "heading" : "2.1 Environment Modeling",
      "text" : "In the traditional success stories for formal verification, such as verifying cache coherence protocols or device drivers, the interface between the system S and its environment E is well defined. Moreover, while the environment itself may not be known, it is usually acceptable to model it as a non-deterministic process subject to constraints specified in a suitable logic or automata-based formalism. Typically such an environment model is “over-approximate”, meaning that it may include more environment behaviors than it should.\nWe see systems based on AI or machine learning (ML) as being quite different. Consider an autonomous vehicle operating in rush-hour traffic in an urban environment. It is impossible even to precisely define the interface between the system and environment (i.e., to identify the variables/features of the environment that must be modeled), let alone to model all possible behaviors of the environment. Even if the interface is known, non-deterministic or over-approximate modeling is likely to produce too many spurious bug reports, rendering the verification process useless in practice.\nSimilarly, for systems involving joint human-machine control, such as semi-autonomous vehicles, human agents are a key part of the environment and/or system. Researchers have attempted modeling humans as nondeterministic or stochastic processes with the goal of verifying the correctness of the overall system [41, 44]. Given the variability and uncertainty in human behavior, a data-driven approach based on machine learning is usually necessary. Such an approach, in turn, is sensitive to the quality of data. For example, the technique of inverse reinforcement learning [35] can be used for learning the reward function of human agents [1, 50]. However, accuracy of the learned reward function depends on the expressivity of the hand-coded features by the designer and the amount and variety of the data collected. In order to achieve Verified AI for such human-in-the-loop systems, we need to address the limitations of the current human modeling techniques and provide guarantees about their prediction accuracy and convergence.\nThe first challenge, then, is to come up with a method of environment modeling that allows one to provide provable guarantees on the system’s behavior without necessarily being precise or even over-approximate."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.2 Formal Specification",
      "text" : "Formal verification critically relies on having a formal specification – a precise, mathematical statement of what the system is supposed to do. However, the challenge of coming up with a high-quality formal specification is well known, even in application domains in which formal verification has found considerable success (see, e.g., [5]).\nThis challenge is only exacerbated in AI-based systems. Consider a module in an autonomous vehicles that performs object recognition, distinguishing humans from other objects. What is the specification for such a module? How might it differ from the specifications used in traditional applications of formal methods? What should the specification language be, and what tools can one use to construct a specification?\nThus, the second challenge is to find an effective method to specify desired and undesired properties of systems that use AI- or ML-based components."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.3 Modeling Systems that Learn",
      "text" : "In most traditional applications of formal verification, the system S is precisely known: it is a C program, or a circuit described in a hardware description language. The system modeling problem is primarily concerned with reducing the size of the S to a more tractable representation by abstracting away irrelevant details.\nAI-based systems lead to a very different challenge for system modeling. A major challenge is the use of machine learning, where the system evolves as it encounters new data and new situations. Modeling a deep neural network that has been trained on millions of data points can be challenging enough even if one “freezes” the training process: new abstraction techniques will be necessary. Additionally, the verification procedure must account for future changes in the learner as new data arrives. New techniques must be devised to formally model components based on machine learning."

      "heading" : "2.4 Generating Training Data",
      "text" : "Formal methods has proved effective for the systematic generation of test data in various settings including simulation-based verification of circuits (e.g., [26]) and finding security exploits in commodity software (e.g., [3]). In these cases, even though the end result is not a proof of correctness of the system S, the generated tests raise the level of assurance in the system’s correctness. Can the testing of AI-based systems leverage formal methods in a similar manner?\nRecent efforts have shown that various machine learning algorithms can fail under small adversarial perturbations [36, 18, 34, 21]. Learning algorithms promise to generalize from data, but such simple perturbations that fool the algorithms create concerns regarding their use in safety-critical applications such as autonomous\ndriving. Such small perturbations might be even unrecognizable to naked eyes, but drive the algorithm to misclassify the perturbed data.\nThe fourth challenge we identify is to devise techniques based on formal methods to systematically generate training and testing data for ML-based components."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.5 Scalability of Verification Engines",
      "text" : "A criticism of formal verification has always been whether it can scale up to handle industrial designs. Much progress has been made in this regard, especially in the area of hardware verification.\nHowever, in systems that use AI or ML, the scalability challenge is even greater. In addition to the scale of systems as measured by traditional metrics (dimension of state space, number of components, etc.), the types of components can be much more complex. For instance, in (semi-)autonomous driving, autonomous vehicles and their controllers need to be modeled as hybrid systems combining both discrete and continuous dynamics. Moreover, agents in the environment (humans, other vehicles) may need to be modeled as probabilistic processes. Finally, the requirements may involve not only traditional Boolean specifications on safety and liveness, but also quantitative requirements on system robustness and performance."

      "heading" : "3 Principles for Verified AI",

      "heading" : "3.1 Introspective Environment Modeling",
      "text" : "Recall from Sec. 2.1 the challenge of modeling the environment E of an AI-based system S. We believe that a promising strategy to meet this challenge is to develop design and verification methods that are introspective, i.e., they identify assumptions A that system S makes about the environment E that are sufficient to guarantee the satisfaction of the specification Φ. The assumptions A must be such that, at run time, S can efficiently monitor A so as to ensure that they always hold. Moreover, if there is a human operator involved, one might want A to be translatable into an explanation that is human understandable, so that S can “explain” to the human why it may not be able to satisfy the specification Φ.\nIdeally, the assumptions A must be the weakest set of such assumptions that S makes about its environment. However, given the other requirements for A to be efficiently monitorable and human understandable, one may need to settle for a stronger assumption.\nAs an example, consider an autonomous vehicle that is trying to maintain a minimum distance from any other object while being in motion — this forms the specification Φ. Note that Φ defines an interface and a set of sensors that the vehicle S must use to check for itself that Φ is satisfied. On top of this minimal interface, suppose that S tracks other features of the environment E such as the state of traffic lights, the number of vehicles in its vicinity, their state such as their velocity, whether they are human-driven, an estimate of those human drivers’ intent and driving style, etc. It will then need to generate assumptions A to monitor over this expanded interface (as well as its internal state) so as to ensure that when A is satsified, so is Φ.\nExtracting good assumptions may be easier during the design process, e.g., while synthesizing a controller for S. Preliminary work by the authors has shown that such extraction of monitorable assumptions is feasible in simple cases [28, 29, 20], although much more research is required to make this practical."

      "heading" : "3.2 End-to-End Specifications and Specification Mining",
      "text" : "Writing formal specifications for AI/ML components is hard, even impossible if the task involves a version of the Turing test. How can we address this challenge described in Sec. 2.2?\nAs researchers often say: when the problem is too hard, perhaps we should change the problem! We believe that formally specifying the behavior of an AI/ML component may be unnecessary. Instead, one should focus on specifying the end-to-end behavior of the entire AI-based system. We believe that this latter task, in many if not most cases, can be done more easily.\nConsider again our autonomous vehicle scenario from the previous section. It should be straightforward to specify the property Φ corresponding to maintaining a minimum distance from any object during motion. This property says nothing about any component that uses machine learning.\nOf course, in order to test the ML-based component, it is useful to have a formal specification on its interface. However, we believe this specification does not need to be exact: a “likely specification” could suffice. We suggest the use of techniques for inferring specifications from behaviors and other artifacts — so-called specification mining techiques (e.g., [16, 27, 24]), for this purpose."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.3 Abstractions and Explanations for Machine Learning",
      "text" : "Let us now consider the challenge, described in Sec. 2.3, of modeling systems S that learn from experience. We believe a combination of automated abstraction and explanation-based learning will be needed to model such systems for purposes of formal verification.\nFirst, effective techniques need to be developed to abstract ML components into a formalism for which efficient verification techniques exist or can be developed. Since the guarantees many ML algorithms give are probabilistic, this will require the development of probabilistic logics and similar formalisms that can capture these guarantees (e.g., [45]). Additionally, if the output of a learning algorithm is accompanied by a measure of uncertainty about its correctness, then that uncertainty must be propagated to the rest of the system and represented in the model of the overall system. For example, the formalism of convex Markov decision processes (convex MDPs) [37, 39, 44] provide a way of representing uncertainty in the values of learned transition probabilities. Algorithms for verification and control may then need to be extended to handle these new abstractions (see, e.g., [39]).\nThe task of modeling a learning system can be made easier if the learner accompanies its predictions with explanations of how those predictions result from the data and background knowledge. In fact, this idea is not new – it has long been investigated by the ML community under terms such as explanation-based generalization [33]. When such explanations are made compatible with the modeling languages used in formal methods, the task of system modeling for verification will be considerably easier."

      "heading" : "3.4 Randomized Formal Methods",
      "text" : "Consider the challenge, described in Sec. 2.4, of generating training data for a ML component in an AI-based system. More concretely, suppose we wish to systematically test a classifier f : Rn → R that given a set of data points (images, audio, etc.) x ∈ Rn assigns a real-valued label to them f (x) ∈ R. One testing problem is to find a perturbation r ∈ Rn such that the algorithm flips the label it assigns to (many) examples upon perturbation, i.e., f (x) 6= f (x+ r).\nSuch perturbations cannot be done arbitrarily. One challenge is to define the space of “legal” perturbations so that the resulting examples are still legal inputs that look “realistic”. Additionally, one might need to impose constraints on the distribution of the generated examples in order to obtain guarantees about convergence of the learning algorithm to the true concept. How do we meet all these requirements?\nWe believe that the answer may lie in a new class of randomized formal methods – randomized algorithms for generating test inputs subject to formal constraints and distribution requirements. Specifically, a recently\ndefined class of techniques, termed control improvisation [19], holds much promise. An improviser is a generator of random strings (examples) x that satisfy three constraints: (i) a hard constraint that defines the space of legal x; (ii) a soft constraint defining how the generated x must be similar to real-world examples, and (iii) a randomness requirement defining a constraint on the output distribution. The theory of control improvisation is still in its infancy, and we are just starting to understand the computational complexity and to devise efficient algorithms. Much more remains to be done.\nAnother challenge for the systematic generation of training data for ML components is to model those components and their requirements in a suitable manner. To deal with this, we think techniques for black-box test generation for cyber-physical systems (e.g. [14]) can be useful in generating training and test data for ML components. These methods would treat ML components as black-box components and generate training data using an end-to-end formal specification."

      "heading" : "3.5 Engines for Run-Time, Quantitative, and Learning-Based Verification",
      "text" : "Once effective methods for formalizing S, E, and Φ are devised for AI-based systems, then one must design engines for deciding whether S satisfies the specification Φ in the environment E. At this point, the scalability challenge described in Sec. 2.5 will loom large. We will need the analogs of SAT, BDDs, and SMT for AI-based systems.\nAlthough it is too early to know exactly what formalisms will be best suited for AI-based systems, we believe a few directions are clear.\nFirst, the complexity and heterogeneity of AI-based systems means that, in general, many decision problems underlying formal verification are likely to be undecidable. (For example, even deciding whether a state of a linear hybrid system is reachable is undecidable.) To overcome this obstacle posed by computational complexity, one must either (i) find tractable but realistic problem classes, or (ii) settle for incomplete or unsound formal verification methods (i.e., semi decision procedures). Techniques for simulation-based verification or run-time verification can prove very fruitful in this regard, as has been recently obtained for industrial automotive systems (e.g. [15, 17, 12]).\nFurther, we believe that it will be important to move from verification problems with purely “Boolean” YES/NO answers to problems with quantitative solutions. Such a move is motivated by the use of probabilistic modeling as well as a need for defining cost-based specifications with the goal of minimizing cost. Some initial steps have been taken with the use of logics with quantitative semantics, such as signal temporal logic [30], and automata-theoretic formalisms such as weighted automata [8], but much more remains to be done. Similarly, work on SMT solving must be extended to more effectively handle cost constraints — in other words, combining SMT solving with optimization methods (e.g., [48, 6]).\nFinally, we believe that verification methods themselves are benefiting from the use of inductive learning [46, 47]. An emerging topic in formal methods, termed formal inductive synthesis [23], shows much promise for tackling hard problems in verification and synthesis by leveraging expert human insight in combination with induction and deduction."

For each of these five challenges, we have identified corresponding principles for design and verification that hold promise for addressing that challenge. We are currently engaged in developing the theory behind these principles, and applying them to the design of human cyber-physical systems, with a special focus on semi-autonomous driving, and expect to\nreport on the results in the years to come."
