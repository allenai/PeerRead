      "text" : "Query-focused multi-document summarization (Nenkova et al., 2006; Wan et al., 2007; Ouyang et al., 2010) can facilitate users to grasp the main idea of a set of documents and has been proven to be an effective way consume massive information. In query-focused summarization, a specific topic description, such as a query or a short narrative is proposed before the documents, which express the most important topic information and a summary would be generated according to the given topic description.\nSupervised models have been widely used in summarization(Li, et al., 2009, Shen et al., 2007, Ouyang et al., 2010). Supervised models usually regard summarization as a classification or regression problem and use various sentence features to build a classifier based on labeled negative or positive samples. However, existing supervised approaches seldom exploit the intrinsic structure among sentences and usually give rise to serious problems such as unbalance and low recall in summaries.\nRecently, LDA-based (Blei et al., 2003) Bayesian topic models have successfully been\napplied to multi-document summarization in that Bayesian approaches can offer clear and rigorous probabilistic interpretations for summaries that other techniques do not have (Daume and Marcu, 2006; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Jin et al., 2010; Mason and Charniak, 2011; Delort and Alfonseca, 2012). Exiting Bayesian approaches label sentences or words with topics and sentences which are closely related with query or can highly generalize documents can be selected into summaries. LDA topic model suffers from the intrinsic disadvantages that it only uses word frequency for topic modeling and are do not explore more useful text features such as position, word order etc (Zhu and Xing, 2010). For example, the first sentence in a paragraph or a passage may be important for summary since it is more likely to give a global generalization about a paragraph or a passage. But LDA model is hard to consider such information, making useful information lost. It naturally comes to our minds that we can improve summarization performance by making full use of both more useful text features and the latent semantic structures generated by LDA topic models. One related work is by Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur (2010). They built a hierarchical topic model called Hybhsum based on LDA for topic discovery and assumed this model can produce appropriate scores for evaluating sentences. Then the scores are used for tuning the weights of various features which may be helpful to generate summaries. Their work made a good step combining topic model with feature based supervised learning. What their approach confuses us is that whether a topic model only based on word frequency is good enough to generate an appropriate score for tuning feature weights. With the opposite research line, we consider that one topic model only based on word frequency cannot well explore the information latent in the documents and expect more useful features to improve the topic model. Based on this, supervised\ntopic models such as sLDA(Blei and MacAuliffe 2007) give us some inspiration. In sLDA, each document is associated with a labeled feature and sLDA can integrate this feature into LDA model in a principled way.\nWith the reference to the work of supervised LDA models, in this paper, we propose a novel sentence feature based Bayesian model for multidocument summarization. Our approach can naturally combine feature based supervised methods and topic model. The most important and challenging problem in our model is the tuning of feature weights. To solve this problem, we transform the problem of finding optimum feature weights into an optimization algorithm and learn the weights in a supervised way. A set of experiments are conducted based on the benchmark data of TAC2008 and TAC2009, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of our model. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes some background and related works. Section 3 describes our details of S-sLDA model. Section 4 demonstrates details of our approaches, including learning, inference and summary generation. Section 5 provides experiments results and the conclusion is made in Section 6."

      "text" : "A variety of approaches have been proposed for topic-focused multi-document summarizations such as unsupervised (semi-supervised) approaches, supervised approaches, and Bayesian approaches. Most supervised approaches regard summarization task as a sentence level two class classification problem and distinguish desired summary sentences from undesired ones in regard with sentence features. Supervised machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine(SVM) (Li, et al., 2009), Maximum Entropy (Osborne, 2002) , Conditional Random Field (Shen et al., 2007) and regression models (Ouyang et al., 2010) have been adopted to leverage the rich sentence features for summarization. Recently, Bayesian topic model has shown its power in summarization for its clear probabilistic interpretation. Daume and Marcu (2006) proposed Bayesum model for sentence extraction based on\nquery expansion concept in information retrieval. Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009) proposed topicsum and hiersum which use a LDA-like topic model and assign each sentence a distribution over background topic, doc-specific topic and content topics. Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur (2010) made a good step in combining topic model with supervised feature based regression for sentence scoring in summarization. In their model, the score of training sentences are firstly got through a novel hierarchical topic model. Then a featured based support vector regression (SVR) is used for sentence score prediction. The problem of Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur’s model is that topic model and feature based regression are two separate processes and the score of training sentences may be biased because their topic model only consider word frequency and fail to consider other important features. Supervised feature based topic models have been proposed in recent years to incorporate different kinds of features into LDA model. Blei (2007) proposed sLDA for document response pairs and Daniel et al. (2009) proposed Labeled LDA by defining a one to one correspondence between latent topic and user tags. Zhu and Xing(2010) proposed conditional topic random field(CTRF) which addresses feature and independent limitation in LDA."

Eqn(9) is based on the assumption that query topic concern about things relevant to the main topic discussed by the document corpus. This is a reasonable assumption and most previous LDA summarization models are based on similar assumptions.\nNext, we define vQ k  for a sentence collection\nvO which can be interpreted as the probability that\nall sentences in collection vO are generated from\ntopic k. vQ k  can be calculated as follows:\n| |\n1\n1 , [1, ], [ 2,2]\n| |\nv\nv\nO\nO k sk\nsv\nk K v O        (10)\nwhere | |vO denotes the number of sentences in\nsentence set vO .Inspired by the idea that desired summary sentences would be more semantically related with the query, we transform problem of finding optimum to the following optimization\nproblem\n2\n2 1\nmin L( )= ( || ); 1 T\nv kt\nv t v KL O Q    \n  (11)\n( || )vKL O Q is the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the query topic and sentence set vO as is shown in Eqn.(12). | |\n| | 1\n11 1\n1\n| |1 ( || ) log log\n| |\nv\nv v\nv\nO\nOK K sk O k sv\nv O k sk sk k vQk Qk\nO KL O Q\nO\n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n(12)\nIn ( )L  , can see that 2O , which contain desirable sentences, are given the largest penalty for its KL distance from query.

Exiting Bayesian approaches label sentences or words with topics and sentences which are closely related with query or can highly generalize documents can be selected into summaries. LDA topic model suffers from the intrinsic disadvantages that it only uses word frequency for topic modeling and are do not explore more useful text features such as position, word order etc (Zhu and Xing, 2010). For example, the first sentence in a paragraph or a passage may be important for summary since it is more likely to give a global generalization about a paragraph or a passage. But LDA model is hard to consider such information, making useful information lost. It naturally comes to our minds that we can improve summarization performance by making full use of both more useful text features and the latent semantic structures generated by LDA topic models. One related work is by Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur (2010).

In this paper, we propose a novel supervised approach that can incorporate rich sentence features into Bayesian topic models in a principled way, thus taking advantages of both topic model and feature based supervised learning methods. Experiments on TAC2008 and TAC2009 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",
