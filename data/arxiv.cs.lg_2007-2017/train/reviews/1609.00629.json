SEBOOST applies a secondary optimization process in the subspace spanned by the last steps and descent directions. The method was inspired by the SESOP optimization method for large-scale problems, and has been adapted for the stochastic learning framework. It can be applied on top of any existing optimization method with no need to tweak the internal algorithm. We show that the method is able to boost the performance of different algorithms, and make them more robust to changes in their hyper-parameters. As the boosting steps of SEBOOST are applied between large sets of descent steps, the additional subspace optimization hardly increases the overall computational burden. We introduce two hyper-parameters that control the balance between the baseline method and the secondary optimization process. The method was evaluated on several deep learning tasks, demonstrating promising results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 14:48:16 GMT  (422kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00629v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["elad richardson", "rom herskovitz", "boris ginsburg", "michael zibulevsky"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.00629"}
