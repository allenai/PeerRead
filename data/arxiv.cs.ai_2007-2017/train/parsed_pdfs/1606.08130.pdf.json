      "text" : "Almost all non-trivial commercial software systems use libraries of reusable components. The theory of combining conventional imperative programs is relatively well-developed. However, in knowledgeintensive computing, characterized by using so-called declarative programming, research on reusable components is not very developed. It would be desirable to use a program written in Answer Set Programming (ASP) with a specification of an Integer Liner Program (ILP) as building blocks in a complex application. Such a programming method, from existing components, possibly found on the web, would be extremely useful. The main challenge is that the programs may be written in different languages (even legacy languages), and rely on different solving technologies\nIntegration on the semantic level has been achieved in the Algebra of Modular Systems [38, 39]. Formally, a module in this algebra represents a class of structures, independently of any form of representation. Algebraical operations to manipulate such classes are defined, essentially generalising Codd’s Relation Algebra [10] from tables to classes of structures. While the Algebra of Modular Systems provides a good account of how to combine modules, it is still unclear how to combine solving technology from different fields. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap.\n1 Helsinki Institute for Information Technology HIIT, Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, FI-00076 AALTO, Finland, email:bart.bogaerts@aalto.fi 2 Computational Logic Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada, email:{ter,mitchell}@cs.sfu.ca\nContributions To study how pieces of solving technology from different fields can be combined, we extend the algebra to also be applicable to so-called propagators. We show that each of the operations on propagators corresponds to the same operation on modules. For example, if E1, E2 are modules, then πδ(σ(Q≡R)E1 × E2) is a compound module. It represents the class of structures A such that some structure A′ exists that coincides with A on δ and such that A′ satisfies both E1 and E2 and interprets Q the same as R. If P1 and P2 are propagators for E1 and E2 respectively, then we show that in our extended version of the algebra, πδ(σ(Q≡R)P1 × P2) is a propagator for πδ(σ(Q≡R)E1 × E2). We equip these propagators with an explanation mechanism that generalises lazy clause generation [37], cutting plane generation [11] and counterexample-guided abstraction-refinement [9] (see Section 4, in particular Examples 4.5 and 4.2). This generalisation shows that many existing techniques are actually instances of the same fundamental principles. Furthermore, it will, in the future, allow for very simple proofs of correctness for novel, similar, techniques. Indeed, it suffices to show that a new technique satisfies the general definitions from this paper to guarantee that it yields a correct (learning) solver. We furthermore extend solvers based on these modular propagators with a conflict-analysis method that generalises resolution from conflict-driven clause learning [28]. We study complexity of the combined propagators in terms of complexity of propagators for the individual modules and show that in general, our operations can increase complexity. The resulting framework can capture, by means of its own (i.e., without relying on the complexity of individual modules), the entire polynomial hierarchy. This is useful, for example, to build a propagator for Quantified Boolean Formulas based on a propagator that (only) performs unit propagation for a propositional theory. We discuss how this can be done in Section 5.\nOur formal framework results effectively in a paradigm where pieces of information (modules) are accompanied with implemented technology (propagators) and where composing solving technology is possible with the same ease as composing modules. The algorithms we propose are an important step towards practical usability of the modular system paradigm. Related Work The closest related work is research on technology integration. Examples include but are not limited to [18, 4, 33]. Combined solving is perhaps most developed in the SAT modulo theories (SMT) community, where theory propagations are tightly interleaved with satisfiability solving [32, 36]. For efficient solving, special propagators are identified and either implemented separately or integrated tightly into the main reasoning mechanism. For example, acyclicity is added to SAT and ASP as a special propagator [16, 7]. The main novelty in this paper with respect to these previous approaches is we generalise the Algebra of Modular Systems to an algebra of propaga-\ntors, resulting in a setting where propagators for simple modules (or “theories” in SMT terminology) can be combined into more complex propagators for the combined module.\nRecently, Lierler and Truszczyński [26] introduced a formalism with compositions (essentially, conjunctions) of modules given through solver-level inferences of the form (M, l), where M is a consistent set of literals and l is a literal not in M . Such pairs are called inferences of the module. Transition graphs for modules are constructed, with actions such as Propagate, Fail, Backtrack, Decide. Solvers based on the transition graph are determined by the selectedge-to-follow function (search strategy). Solving templates are investigated for several formalisms, including SAT and ASP. From individual transition graphs, such graphs are constructed for conjunctions of modules, and their properties are investigated, but more complex combinations of modules are not studied.\nCombining propagators has been studied in detail in constraint programming [8, 20, 23]. This research is often limited to a subset of the operations we consider here, for instance studying only conjunction of two constraint programs [5, 1], disjunction of two constraints [31, 43, 24] or connectives from propositional logic applied to constraints [25, 3]. The objectives of the current paper are similar to those considered the CP community; however, there are some key differences. First of all, we generalised the theory of propagators from constraint programming to the Algebra of Modular Systems. It can be applied in principle to every logic with a model semantics. As such, it can serve as a formal basis to transfer the rich body of work from constraint programming to other fields, such as for instance (Integer) Linear Programming or Answer Set Programming. Second, the traditional treatment of propagation emphasises tractability [20] (the focus is on propagators that can be computed in polynomial time). While it is often important to constrain the complexity of the propagators, it can often be useful as well to allow for complexity increasing operations. In our framework, one of the operations (projection) increases complexity; as such, contrary to the propagators considered in constraint programming, it allows to construct propagators for compound modules for which membership checking is not polynomial. As explained above, this is useful to construct propagators for expressive logics such as QBF. Third, we equip our propagators with a learning mechanism that generalizes for instance lazy clause generation [37] from constraint programming and a conflict analysis mechanism that generalises conflict-driven clause learning [28] from SAT [27]."

      "text" : "Structures A (relational)3 vocabulary τ is a finite set of predicate symbols. A τ -structure A consists of a domain A and an assignment of an n-ary relation QA over A to all n-predicate symbols Q ∈ τ . A domain atom is an expression of the form Q(d) with Q ∈ τ , and d a tuple of domain elements. The value of a domain atom Q(d) in a structure A (notation Q(d)A) is true (t) if d ∈ QA and false (f ) otherwise. From now on, throughout the entire paper, we assume that A is a fixed domain, shared by all structures. This assumption is not needed for the Algebra of Modular Systems in general, but it is convenient for the current paper since the task we tackle (model expansion, see below) requires fixed domains anyway.\nA four-valued τ -structure A is an assignment Q(d)A of a fourvalued truth value (true, false, unknown (u) or inconsistent (i)) to each domain atom over τ . If Q(d)A ∈ {t, f ,u} for each Q(d), we\n3 Without loss of generality, we restrict to relational vocabularies in this paper.\ncall A consistent. If Q(d)A ∈ {t, f} for each Q(d), we call A twovalued and identify it with the corresponding structure. A four-valued structures is sometimes also called a partial structure, as it provides partial information about values of domain atoms.\nThe precision order on truth values is induced by u <p t <p i, u <p f <p i. This order is pointwise extended to (four-valued) structures: A <p A′ iff for all domain atoms Q(d), Q(d)A <p Q(d)A ′\n. The set of all four-valued τ -structures forms a complete lattice when equipped with the order ≤p . This means that every set S of (fourvalued) structures has a greatest lower bound glb≤p (S) and a least upper bound lub≤p (S) in the precision order. Hence, there is a most precise four-valued structure glb(∅), which we denote I; I is the most inconsistent structure: it maps all domain atoms to i.\nFour-valued structures are used to approximate structures. If A is a structure and A a partial structure, we say that A approximates A if A≤p A. In our algorithms below, four-valued structures will be used to represent the state of a solver: certain domain atoms have been decided (they are mapped to t or f ), other domain atoms atoms have not yet been assigned a value (they are mapped to u), and certain domain atoms are involved in an inconsistency (they are mapped to i). If a partial structure is inconsistent, it no longer approximates any structure. Solvers typically handle situations in which their state is inconsistent by backtracking.\nIfQ(d) is a domain atom and ν ∈ {t, f , i,u}, we use A[Q(d) : ν] for the (four-valued) structure equal to A except for interpretingQ(d) as ν. We use A[Q : QA ′\n] for the four-valued structure equal to A on all symbols except for Q and equal to Q on A′. If δ ⊆ τ , we use A|δ for the structure equal to A on δ and mapping every other domain atom to u, i.e., A|δ is the least precise structure that coincides with A on δ. Modules Let τM = {M1,M2, . . . } be a fixed vocabulary of atomic module symbols and let τ be a fixed vocabulary. Algebraic expressions for modules are built by the grammar:\nE ::= ⊥ |Mi | E × E | −E | πδE | σQ≡RE. (1)\nWe call × product, − complement, πδ projection onto δ, and σQ≡R selection. Modules that are not atomic are called compound. Each atomic module symbol Mi has an associated vocabulary voc(Mi) ⊆ τ . The vocabulary of a compound module is given by • voc(⊥) = τ , • voc(E1 × E2) = voc(E1) ∪ voc(E2), • voc(−E) = voc(E), • voc(πδE) = δ, and • voc(σΘE) = voc(E). Semantics Let C be the set of all τ -structures with domain A. Modules (atomic and compound) are interpreted by subsets of C.4 A module interpretation assigns to each atomic module Mi ∈ τM a set of τ -structures such that any two τ -structures A1 and A2 that coincide on voc(Mi) satisfy A1 ∈ I(M) iff A2 ∈ I(M). The value of a modular expression E in I, denote JEKI is defined as follows.\nJ⊥KI := ∅. JMiK\nI := I(Mi). JE1 × E2K I := JE1K I ∩ JE2K I . J−EKI := C − JEKI . Jπδ(E)K I := {A | ∃A′ (A′ ∈ JEKI and A|δ = A′|δ)}. JσQ≡REK I := {A ∈ EI | QA = RA}.\nWe call A a model of E in I (denoted A |=I E) if A ∈ JEKI .\n4 If the assumption that A is fixed is dropped, modules are classes of structures instead of sets, but this generality is not needed in this paper.\nIn earlier papers [38, 39], the algebra was presented slightly differently; here, we restrict to a minimal syntax; this is discussed in detail in Section 5.\nExample 2.1. Let τ = {Edge,Trans} be a vocabulary containing two binary predicates. Let I be a model interpretation, Mt a module with vocabulary τ such that A |=I Mt if and only if ATrans is the transitive closure of AEdge and Mf is a module with vocabulary {Trans} such that A |=I Mf if and only if TransA is the full binary relation on A. Consider the following compound module\nE := π{Edge}(Mt × (−Mf )).\nIn this case E is a module with vocabulary {Edge} such that A |=I E if and only if EdgeA is a disconnected graph. This can be seen as follows: the module Mt sets Trans to be the transitive closure of Edge . The term (−Mf ) ensures that Trans is not the full binary relation. These two modules are combined conjunctively and the result is projected onto {Edge}, i.e., the value of Trans does not matter in the result.\nFrom now on, we assume that a module interpretation I is given and fixed. Slightly abusing notation, we often omit the reference to I and write, e.g., A |= E instead of A |=I E. Model expansion for modular systems The model expansion task for modular systems is: given a (compound) module E and a partial structure A, find a structure A (or: find all structures A) such that A≥p A and A |=I E (if one such exists).\nMitchell and Ternovska [30] have defined methods to apply the lazy clause generation (LCG) paradigm [14] to solve the model expansion problem for modular systems. In particular, given propagators Pi that explain their propagations by means of clauses for atomic modules Mi, they show how to build a LCG-solver for modules of the form E =M1 × · · · ×Mn.\nIn this paper, wee generalise the above idea to a setting whereE is an arbitrary (compound) module and to a setting where the learning mechanism is not necessarily clause learning."

      "text" : "We define a general notion of propagators. We show how propagators for atomic modules can be composed into propagators for compound modules. Intuitively, a propagator is a blackbox procedure that refines a partial (four-valued) structure by deriving consequences of a given module.\nDefinition 3.1. A propagator is a mapping P from partial structures to partial structures such that the following hold: • P is ≤p -monotone: whenever A≥p A′, also P (A)≥p P (A′). • P is information-preserving: P (A)≥p A for each A.\nDefinition 3.2. Given a module E, a propagator P is an Epropagator if on two-valued structures, it coincides with E, i.e., whenever A is two-valued, P (A) = A if A ∈ E, and P (A) is inconsistent otherwise.\nAn E-propagator can never “lose models of E”, as is formalised in the following lemma.\nLemma 3.3. Let P be an E-propagator. If A is a model of E and A≥p A, then also A≥p P (A).\nProof. Follows immediately from ≤p -monotonicity and the fact that P (A) = A for two-valued structures A.\nExample 3.4. Modern ASP solvers typically contain (at least) two propagators. One, which we call PPUP , performs unit propagation on the completion of the program P . The other, which we call PPUFS performs unfounded set propagation; that is: it maps a partial structure A to A ∪ {¬p | p ∈ lUFS(P ,A)}, where lUFS(P ,A) is the largest unfounded set of P with respect to A [42].\nIt is easy to see that these two propagators are informationpreserving and ≤p -monotone.\nExample 3.5. In several constraint solvers that perform bounds reasoning, (finite-domain) integer variables are represented by a relational representation of their bounds: a variable c is represented by a unary predicateQc≤ with intended interpretation thatQc≤(n) holds iff c ≤ n. Consider in this setting a propagator Pc≤d. This propagator enforces bounds consistency for the constraint c ≤ d. That is, a partial structure A is mapped by Pc≤d to a partial structure A′ such that for each n:\n• if Qd≤(n)A ≥p t, Qc≤(n)A ′ = lub≤p (Qc≤(n) A, Qd≤(n) A, • otherwise, Qc≤(n)A ′ = Qc≤(n) A\nAnd similar equations for Qd≤(n). Intuitively, this simply says that if d ≤ n holds in A, then Pc≤d also propagates that c ≤ n holds. For instance, assume the domain A = {1, . . . , 100} and that A is such that\nQc≤(n) A =\n\n\n t if n ≥ 90 u if 90 > n ≥ 10 f otherwise\nQd≤(n) A =\n\n\n t if n ≥ 80 u if 80 > n ≥ 20 f otherwise\nThis structure encodes that the value of c is in the interval [10, 90] and d in the interval [20, 80]. In this case, Pc≤d propagates that also c ≤ 80 without changing the value of d. Formally:\nQc≤(n) Pc≤d(A) =\n\n\n t if n ≥ 80 u if 80 > n ≥ 10 f otherwise\nQd≤(n) Pc≤d(A) = Qd≤(n) A\nPropagators and modules\nLemma 3.6. If P is a propagator, then there is a unique module E such that P is an E-propagator. We denote this module module(P ).\nProof. Uniqueness follows immediately from Definition 3.2. Existence follows from the fact that we can define module(P ) as the module such that A |= module(P ) if and only if P (A) = A.\nDefinition 3.7. If E is a module, the E-checker is the propagator PEcheck defined by: 5\nP E check : A 7→\n\n\n A if A is consistent but not two-valued A if A is two-valued and A |= E I otherwise\nLemma 3.8. For each module E, PEcheck is an E-propagator.\nProof. That PEcheck is a propagator follows from the fact that I is more precise than any partial structure A. It follows immediately from the definition that PEcheck coincides withE on two-valued structures. 5 Recall that I denotes the most precise (inconsistent) structure.\nThe E-checker is the least precise E-propagator.\nProposition 3.9. For each E-propagator P and each consistent structure A, P (A)≥p PEcheck (A).\nThe proof is trivial. Propagators and Solvers Intuitively, a solver is a procedure that performs model expansion for a given module.\nDefinition 3.10. Let E be a module. AnE-solver is a procedure that takes as input a four-valued structure A and whose output is the set S of all two-valued structures A with A |= E and A≥p A.\nPropagators can be used to create solvers and vice versa. We first describe how to build a simple generate-and-check solver from a propagator. Afterwards, we provide an algorithm that uses the solver in a smarter way. In the next section, we discuss how to add a learning mechanism to this solver.\nAlgorithm 3.11. Let P be an E-propagator. We define an E-solver SPgc as follows. S P gc takes as input a structure A. The state of S P gc is a tuple (B,S) of a structure and a set of two-valued structures S; it is initialised as (A,∅). SPgc performs depth-first search on the search space of (four-valued) structures more precise than A. Choices consist of updating B to B[Q(d) : t] or to B[Q(d) : f ] for some domain atom withQ(d)B = u. Whenever B is two-valued, the solver checks whether P (B) = B. If yes, B is added to S . After encountering a two-valued structure, it backtracks over its last choice. When the search space has been traversed, SPgc returns S .\nAlgorithm 3.12. The solver SPp extends S P gc by updating B to P (B) before each choice. If B is inconsistent, SPp backtracks.\nProposition 3.13. If the domain A is finite, SPgc and S P p are Esolvers.\nSketch of the proof. Finiteness of A guarantees that depth-first search terminates. Correctness of SPgc follows from the fact that P is an E-propagator (since {A | P (A) = A} = {A | A |= E}).\nCorrectness of SPp follows from Lemma 3.3: no models are lost by propagation.\nIn the above proposition, the condition that A is finite only serves to ensure termination of these two procedures that essentially traverse the entire space of structures more precise than B. All the concepts defined in this paper, for instance propagators, and operations on propagators, can also be used in a setting where the domain is infinite.\nWe now show how to construct a propagator from a solver. We call this propagator optimal, since it always returns the most precise partial structure any propagator could return (cf. Proposition 3.16). In this sense, this propagator actually performs skeptical reasoning.\nDefinition 3.14. Let S be an E-solver. We define an E-propagator PSopt : A 7→ glb≤p S(A).\nNotice that if S′ is anE-solver as well, as a function, PSopt = P S′\nopt . However, we include S in the notation since for practical purposes, we need a way to compute PSopt(A); for this, a call to S is used.\nProposition 3.15. If S is an E-solver, PSopt is an E-propagator.\nProof. We first show that PSopt is a propagator. First, for each A ∈ S(A), it holds that A≥p A, hence also PSopt(A)≥p A. Second, notice that whenever A1 ≥p A2, S(A1) ⊆ S(A2), hence\nglb≤p S(A1)≥p glb≤p S(A2). From these two properties, it follows that PSopt is indeed a propagator. The fact that it is also an E-propagator follows from the property that for two-valued A, S(A) = {A} if A |= E and S(A) = ∅ otherwise.\nProposition 3.16. Let P be any E-propagator and S an E-solver. For each structure A, it holds that PSopt(A)≥p P (A).\nProof. From Lemma 3.3, we find that P (A)≤p A if A ∈ S(A). Hence also P (A)≤p glb≤p S(A) = P S opt (A).\nCombining propagators First, we discuss how propagators for the same module can be combined. Afterwards, we extend the algebra of modular systems to propagators.\nProposition 3.17. Composition P1 ◦P2 of two E-propagators is an E propagator. In particular, if P is an E-propagator, also Pn is an E-propagator. We use P∞ for lim≤p P n.\nProposition 3.18. If P1 and P2 are two E-propagators, then (P1 ◦ P2)(A)≥p P1(A) and (P1 ◦ P2)(A)≥p P2(A) for each A.\nThe proofs of the two above propositions are trivial. In the next proposition, we show how checkers for compound expressions in the algebra can be built from propagators for atomic modules. These checkers are sufficient for defining the algebra on propagators: if propagators for atomic modules are given, Proposition 3.20 provides us with the means to obtain a propagator for compound expressions. However, for practical purposes, we are often interested in better, i.e., more precise propagators. Hence, after this proposition, we investigate for which operations better propagations can be defined.\nDefinition 3.19. Let P be an E-propagator, P ′ an E′-propagator and δ ⊆ τ . We define following checkers (we only define their behaviour on two-valued structures since otherwise the behaviour of checkers is trivial): • P⊥check : A 7→ I • PE×E ′\ncheck : A 7→ lub≤p {P (A), P ′(A)}\n• P−Echeck : A 7→\n{\nA if P (A) = I I otherwise\n• P πδEcheck : A 7→\n{\nA if SPp (A|δ) 6= ∅ I otherwise\n• P σQ≡RE\ncheck : A 7→\n{\nA if P (A) = A and QA = RA I otherwise\nProposition 3.20. The operations defined in Definition 3.19 indeed defined checkers. Furthermore for each compound module E′′, PE ′′\ncheck is an E ′′-checker.\nSketch of the proof. Correctness for each of the above follows easily from the definition of the semantics of modular systems.\nNow, we present for several of the operations a better (more precise) propagator (compared to only checking).\nProposition 3.21. Let P be an E-propagator, P ′ an E′-propagator and δ a sub-vocabulary of τ . We define the following operations: • P × P ′ : A 7→ lub≤p {P (A), P\n′(A)}. • πδP : A 7→\n\n\n I if A is inconsistent I if A is two-valued on δ and SPp (A|δ) = ∅ lub≤p (P (A|δ)|δ,A|τ\\δ) otherwise.\n• σQ≡RP : A 7→ (P (A))[Q : L,R : L] where L = lub≤p (Q\nP (A), RP (A)). It then holds that P × P ′ is an E × E′-propagator, πδP is a πδE propagator and σQ≡R is a σQ≡RE-propagator.\nProof. We provide a proof for projection; the other operations are analogous.\nWe show that πδP is a propagator. First, for each four-valued structure A, P (A|δ)≥p A|δ since P is a propagator, hence also πδP (A)|δ = P (A|δ)|δ ≥p A|δ . Furthermore, πδP (A)|τ\\δ = A|τ\\δ. Combining these two yields that πδP (A)≥p A and hence that πδP is indeed information preserving (the cases where P (A) = I are trivial).\nWe show ≤p -monotonicity of πδP . Assume A1 ≥p A2. If A2 is inconsistent, then so is A1 and thus πδP (A1) = πδP (A2). If A2 is two-valued on δ and SPp (A1|δ) = ∅, then either A1 is inconsistent, or A1|δ = A2|δ . In both cases, the result is trivial. If πδP (A1) = I, the result is trivial as well, hence we can assume that both A1 and A2 fall in the “otherwise” category in the definition of πδP . The ≤p -monotonicity of πδP now follows from the fact that if A1 ≥p A2 then also (1) A1|δ ≥p A2|δ and thus P (A1|δ)≥p P (A2|δ) and (2) A1|τ\\δ ≥p A2|τ\\δ . Hence, we conclude that πδP indeed defines a propagator.\nNow, we show that πδP is a πδE-propagator. Let A be a twovalued structure.\nFirst suppose A |= πδE. In this case, there exists a two-valued A′ such that A′ |= E and A|δ = A′|δ . Thus, SPp (A|δ) 6= ∅ in this case. Also, in this case P (A|δ) is consistent and thus P (A|δ)|δ = A|δ . We conclude that in this case indeed πδP (A) = A.\nNow suppose A 6|= πδE. In this case, there exists no structure A′ such that A′|δ = A|δ and A′ |= E. Thus SPp (A|δ) = ∅ and πδ(A) is indeed inconsistent.\nThe intuitions in the above proposition are as follows. For P ×P ′, P computes consequences of E, while P ′ computes consequences of E′, given an input structure A. The propagator P × P ′ combines the consequences found by both: it returns the least upper bound of P (A) and P ′(A) in the precision order. That is, it returns the structure in which all domain literals derived by any of the two separate propagators hold (and nothing more). For projection πσP , in the twovalued case, the solver SPp is used to check whether A ∈ πδE. For the three-valued case, P is used to propagate on A|δ , i.e., using only the information about the projected vocabulary δ. From this propagation, only the information that is propagated about δ is kept (this is P (A|δ)|δ). Indeed πδE enforces no restrictions on symbols in τ \\ δ. Furthermore, we transfer all knowledge we previously had on symbols in τ \\ δ (this is some form of inertia); the resulting structure equals P (A|δ) on symbols in δ and equals A on symbols in τ \\δ. For selection σQ≡RP , propagation happens according to P . Afterwards, all propagations for Q are also transferred to R and vice versa. This is done by changing the interpretations of both Q and R to the least upper bound (in the precision order) of their interpretations in P (A).\nExample 3.22 (Example 3.4 continued). We already mentioned that typical ASP solvers have two propagators PPUP and P P UFS . The actual propagation is done according to PPASP = P P UP × P P UFS . Furthermore, typically, this propagation is executed until a fixed point is reached, hence the entire propagation is described by ( PPASP )∞\n. Now let MP be the module such that A |= MP if and only if A is a stable model of P . It is well-known that a structure is a stable model of P if and only if it is a model of the completion and it admits no non-trivial unfounded sets [35]. From this, it follows that MP =\nMPUP ×M P UFS , where M P UP is a module such that A |=M P UP iff A is a model of the completion of P and MPUFS is a module such that A |= MPUFS iff A admits no non-trivial unfounded sets with respect to P . It is easy to see that PPUP and P P UFS are M P UP - and M P UFSpropagators respectively. From this it follows by Propositions 3.21 and 3.17 that PPASP and also ( PPASP )∞ are MP -propagators.\nUp to this point, we have described three different ways to construct E-propagators: PSopt is the most precise E-propagator if S is anE-solver, Proposition 3.20 describes how to buildE-checkers (the least precise propagators) from propagators for subexpressions of E and Proposition 3.21 illustrates how to build more precise propagators for compound expressions. However, precision is not the only criterion for “good” propagators. In practice, we expect propagators to be efficiently computable. In the following proposition, we show that this is indeed the case for the propagators defined in Proposition 3.21.\nProposition 3.23. Assume the fixed domain A is finite; furthermore assume access to an oracle that computes P (A) and P ′(A). The following hold • (P ×P ′)(A) can be computed in polynomial time (in terms of the\nsize of A), • (σQ≡RP )(A) can be computed in polynomial time, • (πδP )(A) can be computed in nondeterministic polynomial time.\nSketch of the proof. The first two statements follow easily from the definitions. For instance (P × P ′)(A) is defined as lub≤p {P (A), P ′(A)}. Computing this least upper bound can be done by comparing Q(d)P (A and Q(d)P ′(A for each domain atom Q(d). There are only polynomially many domain atoms. For the last statement, the complexity is dominated by a call to SPp (A|δ), which is essentially depth-first search.\nProposition 3.23 shows that product and selection do not increase complexity when compared to the complexity of the propagators they compose. However, the situation for projection is different. That is not surprising, since Tasharrofi and Ternovska [40] already showed that the projection operation increases the complexity of the task of deciding whether a structure is a member of a given module or not. As such, Proposition 3.23 actually shows that our propagators for compound expressions only increase complexity when dictated by the complexity of checking membership of the underlying module."

      "heading" : "4 Explanations and Learning",
      "text" : "In many different fields, propagators are defined that explain their propagations in terms of simpler constructs. For instance in CDCLbased ASP solvers [17, 2, 12], the unfounded set propagator explains its propagation by means of clauses. Similar explanations are generated for complex constraints in constraint programming (this is the lazy clause generation paradigm [37]) and in SAT modulo theories [15]. The idea to generate clauses to explain complex constraints already exists for a long time, see e.g. [29]. In integer programming, the cutting plane method [11] is used to enforce a solution to be integer. In this methodology, when a (rational) solution is found, a cutting plane is learned that explains why this particular solution should be rejected. Similarly, in QBF solving, counterexampleguided abstraction-refinement (the CEGAR methodology) counterexample guided abstraction-refinement [9] starts from the idea to first solve a relaxed problem (an abstraction), and on-the-fly add explanations why a certain solution to the relaxation is rejected. De Cat et al.\n[13] defined a methodology where complex formulas are grounded on-the-fly. This is a setting where inference made by complex formulas is explained in terms of simpler formulas (formulas with a lower quantification depth).\nIn this section, we generalise the common idea underlying each of the above paradigms by adding explanations and learning to our abstract framework. We present a general notion of an explaining propagator and define a method to turn such a propagator into a solver that learns from these explanations. An explaining propagator is a propagator that not only returns the partial structure that is the result of its propagations (P (A)), but also an explanation (C(A)). This explanation takes the form of a propagator itself. Depending on the application, this propagator has a specific form. For instance, for lazy clause generation, the explanation must be a (set of) clause(s); in integer linear programming, the explanation must be a (set of) cutting plane(s). In general, there are two conditions on the explanation. First, it should explain why the propagator made certain propagations: C(A) should derive at least what P derives in A. Second, the returned explanation should not be arbitrary, it should be a consequence of the module underlying the propagator P .\nDefinition 4.1. An explaining propagator is tuple (P,C) where P is a propagator and C maps each partial structure either to UNEXPLAINED (notation ♦) or to an explaining propagator C(A) = (P ′, C′) such that the following hold: (1) (explains propagation) P (A)≤p P ′(A). (2) (soundness): module(P ′) ⊆ module(P )\nExample 4.2. Integer linear programs are often divided into two parts: some solver performs search using linear constraints. When a solution is found, a checker checks whether this solution is integervalued. If not, this checker propagates inconsistency and explains this inconsistency by means of a cutting plane. This process fits in our general definition of explaining propagator: a cutting plane can be seen itself as a propagator (actually a simple checker). This propagator explains the inconsistency and is a consequence of the original problem (namely of the integrality constraint).\nAs can be seen, we allow an explaining propagator to not explain certain propagations. For instance, whenever P (A) = A, nothing new is derived, hence there is nothing to explain. We say that (P,C) explains propagation from A if either P (A) = A or C(A) 6= ♦. Each propagator P as defined in Definition 3.1 can be seen as an explaining propagator (P,C♦), whereC♦ maps each partial structure to ♦.\nExample 4.3 (Example 3.5 continued). For each natural number n let cln denote the clause Qc≤(n) ∨ ¬Qd≤(n) and let Pn denote the propagator that performs unit propagation on cln. For each A, let UA denote the set of all n’s such that at least one literal from cln is false in A. Furthermore, let Cc≤d denote the mapping that maps each four-valued structure A to\n{\n♦ if Pc≤d(A) = A (\n×n∈UAPn, C♦\n)\notherwise,\nwhere ×n∈UAPn denotes the product of all Pn with n ∈ UA. In this case, (Pc≤d, Cc≤d) is an explaining propagator. It explains each propagation by means of a set of clauses (the product of propagators Pn for individual clauses). This particular explanation is used for instance in MinisatID [12] and many other lazy clause generation CP systems.\nIn general, using anything as explanation is not really a good idea: what we are hoping for is that a propagator explains its propagations in terms of simpler propagators (where the definition of “simple” can vary from field to field). In order to generalise this idea, in what follows we assume that ≺ is a strict well-founded order on the set of all explaining propagators, where smaller propagators are considered “simpler”. In the following definition, we also require that all propagations need to be explained, except for ≺-minimal propagators.\nDefinition 4.4. We say that an explaining propagator (P,C) respects ≺ if • Whenever C(A) = ♦, P (A) = A or (P,C) is ≺-minimal, • In all other cases, C(A) ≺ (P,C) and C(A) respects ≺.\nExample 4.5. For lazy clause generation, the order on propagators would be (P, C) ≺ (P ′, C′) if P performs unit propagation for a clause and P ′ does not. The conditions in Definition 4.4 guarantee that each non-clausal propagator must explain its propagation in terms of these ≺-minimal propagators; i.e., in terms of clauses.\nExample 4.6. When grounding lazily [13], one can consider propagators Pϕ that perform some form of propagation for a first-order formula ϕ. A possible order ≺ is then: (Pϕ, Cϕ) ≺ (Pϕ′ , Cϕ′) if ϕ has strictly smaller quantification depth then ϕ′. For instance, a propagator for a formula ∀x : ∃y : ψ(x, y) can explain its propagations by means of a propagator for the formula ∃y : ψ(d, y), where d is an arbitrary domain element.\nWe now show explaining propagators can be used.\nAlgorithm 4.7. Let (P,C) be an explaining propagator that respects ≺. We define a learning solver ls(P,C) as follows. The input of ls(P,C) is a partial structure A. The state of ls(P,C) is a triple (P ,B,S) where P is a set of explaining propagators, B is a (fourvalued) structure, and S is a set of (two-valued) structures. The state is initialised as ({(P,C)},A,∅). The solver performs depth-first search on the structure B, where each choice point consists of assigning a value to a domain atom unknown in B. Before each choice point, until a fixed point is reached, B is updated to P ∗(B) and P to P ∪ {C∗(B)}, where (P ∗, C∗) is ≺-minimal among all elements of P that have P ∗(B) 6= B. If no such element exists, no more propagation is possible and the solver makes another choice. Whenever B is inconsistent, the solver backtracks. If this search encounters a model (a two-valued structure A with A = P (A), it stores this model in S and adds (P {A}check , C♦) to P . After the search space has been traversed (i.e., inconsistency is derived without any choice points left), it returns S .\nProposition 4.8. Assume the domain A is finite. If (P, C) is an Eexplaining propagator, then ls(P,C) is an E-solver.\nSketch of the proof. As before, termination follows from the fact that A is finite. It follows from the second condition in Definition 4.1 that during execution of ls(P,C) , for all P ′ ∈ P , it holds that module(P ′) ⊆ module(P ), hence propagation is indeed correct for E.\nThe next question that arises is: how can explaining propagators for individual modules be combined into explaining propagators for compound modules? The answer is not always simple. As for regular propagators, each operation can be defined trivially. In Section 3, being defined trivially meant simply defining the checker. In this case, it means that forC we simply takeC♦. Below, we discuss some more interesting cases. We will use the following notations. If d is a tuple\nof domain elements, we use P dQ≡R for the propagator that maps each structure A to a structure equal to A except that it interpretsQ(d) and R(d) both as lub≤p (Q(d) A, R(d)A). We use PQ≡R for the propagator ×{d∈An}P d Q≡R where A is the domain and n is the arity of Q and R. Furthermore, we use CQ≡R for the mapping that sends A to {\n♦ if PQ≡R(A) = A (\n×{d∈An|Q(d)A 6=R(d)A}P d Q≡R, C♦\n)\notherwise\nDefinition 4.9. Assume (P, C) and (P ′, C′) are explaining propagators. We define the following explaining propagators: • Product of explaining propagators: (P,C) × (P ′, C′) = (P × P ′, C × C′) where C × C′ maps A to\n\n\n\nC(A)× C′(A) if both (P, C) and (P ′, C′) explain propagation from A ♦ otherwise\n• Projection of an explaining propagator: πδ(P,C) = (πδP, πδC), where πδC maps A to \n\n ♦ if A is inconsistent or C(A|δ) = ♦ ♦ if A is two-valued on δ and s(P )(A|δ) = ∅ πδ(C(A)) otherwise\n• Selection of an explaining propagator: σQ≡R(P,C) = (P,C)× (PQ≡R, CQ≡R).\nProposition 4.10. The mappings in Definition 4.9 indeed define explaining propagators.\nProof. The proof is similar for all cases. We only give the proof for projection. The proof is by induction on the structure of C. First assume that C = C♦. In this case, πδ(P,C) = (πδP, C♦), which is indeed an explaining propagator.\nFor the induction case, we can assume that for each A with C(A) 6= ♦, πδC(A) is an explaining propagator. We show that πδ(P,C) is an explaining propagator. Choose some A with (πδC)(A) 6= ♦. Let (P ′, C′) denote (πδC)(A) and (P ′′, C′′) denote C(A). From Definition 4.9, we know that P ′ = πδP ′′.\nFirst, we show that πδ(P,C) explains propagation, i.e., that πδP (A)≤p P\n′(A). We know that P (A)≤p P ′′(A) since (P,C) is an explaining propagator. It follows immediately from the definition of πδP that also πδP (A)≤p πδP ′′(A) = P ′(A).\nWe now show that πδ(P,C) only derives consequences, i.e., that module(P ′) |= module(πδP ). We know that module(P ′′) |= module(P ). From the definition of the semantics of modular systems, it follows that then also πδmodule(P ′′) |= πδmodule(P ). Furthermore, from Proposition 3.21, we know that πδmodule(P ′′) = module(πδP ′′) = module(P ′) and πδmodule(P ) = module(πδP ). The result then follows."

      "heading" : "A Conflict-Driven Learning Algorithm",
      "text" : "The CDCL algorithm for SAT lies at the heart of most modern SAT solvers, and also many SMT solvers, ASP solvers, and others. We now give an algorithm scheme that generalizes the CDCL algorithm to modular systems.\nAlgorithm 4.11. The algorithm cdl (P,C) is obtained by modifying ls(P,C) as follows. Each time propagation leads to an inconsistent state, we update B,P ← B′,P ∪ {(P ′, C′)}, where (B′, (P ′, C′)) = HandleConflict(B,P), and HandleConflict is a function such that\n(1) (P ′, C′) is an explaining propagator that respects ≺, (2) A ≤p B′ <p B (backjumping), (3) (P ∪ {(P ′, C′)})(B′) >p P(B′) (learning), (4) module(P) ⊆ module(P ′) (consequence) After executing HandleConflict, it is optional to restart by re-setting B to A.\nThe intuition is that HandleConflict is some function that returns a state to backtrack to, and a new propagator to add to the set of propagators. This new propagator should, in the structure to which we backtrack, propagate something that was not propagated before. Thus, by analyzing the conflict, we obtain better information and avoid ending up in the same situation again.\nProposition 4.12. Assume A is finite. If (PE , CE) is an Eexplaining propagator that respects ≺, then cdl (PE ,CE) is an Esolver.\nSketch of the proof. Correctness of cdl (PE ,CE) follows from correctness of ls(P,C) combined with the fourth condition for HandleConflict in Algorithm 4.11. The hardest thing to prove is termination of this algorithm in case restarts are involved. It can be seen that this algorithm terminates by the fact that after each conflict, by the third condition in HandleConflict, for at least one partial structure (namely for B′), strictly more is propagated by (P ∪ {(P ′, C′)}) than by P . Since the number of propagators is finite, there cannot be an infinite such sequence, hence only a finite number of conflicts can occur.\nThe purpose of HandleConflct is to perform a conflict analysis analogous to that in standard CDCL. This procedure can be anything; in practice, it will depend on the form ≺-minimal propagators take and on the proof system used for these minimal propagators. Below, we present a sufficient restriction on ≺-minimal propagators to ensure that a procedure HandleConflict actually exists.\nProposition 4.13. Suppose that there exists a function F that takes as arguments two ≺-minimal explaining propagators (P1, C1) and (P2, C2) that respect ≺, and a partial structure B, and returns an explaining propagator (P,C) that respects ≺, such that the following hold.\nIf A <p P1(B) <p P2(P1(B)) and B <p P2(B) <p P2(P1(B)), then module(P1) × module(P2) ⊆ module(P ) and there exists a structure B′ ≤p B such that P (B′) >p P2(P1(B ′)).\nIn that case, a procedure HandleConflict that satisfies the restrictions in Algorithm 4.11 exists.\nSketch of the proof. The idea is that it suffices to be able to combine ≺-minimal propagators since all propagations can (by iterated calls to the explanation mechanism) be explained in terms of these propagators. Furthermore, the above condition can be applied iteratively to combine more than two ≺-minimal propagators.\nThe intuition for F is that it effectively analyses the source of a conflict found by a sequence of propagations. We want to be able to determine a minimum collection of points in the partial structure relevant to the conflict. For this, it suffices that we can take two ≺- minimal propagators and “resolve” them to obtain one with stronger propagation power. Observe that, if we assume that all ≺-minimal propagators have a representation as clauses, this function can be implemented by means of the standard resolution used in CDCL conflict analysis process. In general, other resolution mechanisms might\nbe used. The chosen implementation for F essentially determines the proof system that will be used in the solver.\nIterated applications of F , starting from the last two propagators that changed state and working back to earlier propagators allow us to handle conflicts. Note that F is only defined on ≺-minimal propagators. However, the explanation mechanism in explaining propagators allows us to always reduce propagators to ≺-minimal propagators by means of calling the explanation method until a minimal propagator is obtained (this is possible since ≺ is a well-founded order)."

      "heading" : "5 Modular patterns",
      "text" : "Sometimes, defining a propagator compositionally does not yield the best result. We identify three patterns for which we can define a better (more precise) propagator by exploiting a global structure. The first two optimisations consist of direct implementations for propagators for expressions in the algebra of modular systems that are not in the minimal syntax (for details, see, e.g., [39]). The latter optimisation is based on techniques that were recently used to nest different SAT solvers to obtain a QBF solver. Disjunction of Modules The disjunction of two modules is defined as E1 + E2 = −(−E1 ×−E2).\nDefinition 5.1. Let P1 and P2 be an E1- (respectively E2-) propagator. We define a propagator\nP1 + P2 : A 7→ glb≤p (P1(A), P2(A)).\nIntuitively, this propagator only propagates what holds in both P1(A) and P2(A). As such, it indeed only derives consequences of the disjunction.\nProposition 5.2. The following hold: • P1 + P2 is a −(−E1 ×−E2) propagator • For each consistent partial structure A,\n(P1 + P2)(A)≥p − (−P1 ×−P2)(A).\nSketch of the proof. It is easy to see that A |= −(−E1 × −E2) iff A |= E1 or A |= E2. The first point now follows directly from the definition of P1+P2. The second point follows from Proposition 3.9 since −(−P1 ×−P2) is an E1 + E2-checker.\nExtended selection It is also possible to allow expressions of the form σΘE where Θ consists of expressions of the form Q ≡ R or Q 6≡ R and propositional connectives applied to them (for semantics, see, e.g., [39]). Each such expression can be rewritten to the minimal syntax used in this paper, for instance σP 6≡QE is equivalent to E × −σP≡QE. By taking an entire such formula into account at once, more precise reasoning is possible.\nProposition 5.3. Let P be a σΘE-propagator with Θ an expression as above. If Θ |= Q ≡ R, then σQ≡RP is also a σΘE propagator.\nProof. Follows directly from the fact that in this case σQ≡R(σΘE) = σΘE.\nProposition 5.3 states that we can use (symbolic) equality reasoning on Θ to derive more consequences. This can be used for instance to derive inconsistencies early on.\nExample 5.4. Consider the module\nσ(Q6≡R∨R≡U)∧(Q≡R)E.\nIt is easy to see that R ≡ U is a consequence of the selection expression in the above module. As such, Proposition 5.3 guarantees that we are allowed to improve propagators, to also propagate equality between Q and R.\nImproved Negation Janhunen et al. [21] recently defined a solver that combines two SAT solver. The essence of their algorithm can be translated into our theory as follows. Let τ and δ be vocabularies, E a τ ∪ δ-module and S an E-solver. Furthermore, assume that there is a procedure Explain such that for each two-valued τ -structure A such that S(A) 6= ∅, A = Explain(A) is a partial τ -structure such that • A≤p A • For each two-valued τ structure B≥p A, S(B) 6= ∅. Thus, Explain explains why a certain module is satisfiable. Given this, Janhunen et al. defined an explaining propagator P for −πτE. If A is two-valued on τ , P calls S(A|τ ). If the result of this call is not empty, it propagates a conflict and generates an explanation using Explain(A|τ) (see [21] for details). Otherwise, P maps A to itself.\nThis idea has been generalised to work for arbitrary QBF formulas [6]. It actually forms to essence of many SAT-based QBF algorithms [34, 44, 19, 22]. Janhunen et al. [21] further improved this method by introducing a notion of an underapproximation. That is, instead of using an E-solver S, they use an Ē-solver S̄, where Ē is some module derived from E. This allows them to run S̄ before A is twovalued on τ . Researching how these underapproximations generalise to modular systems is a topic for future work."

We extended the algebra of modular systems to modular propagators and showed how to build solvers from propagators and vice versa. This means that the We argued that our notion of propagator generalises notions from various domains. Furthermore, we added a notion of explanations to our propagators. These explanations generalise concepts from answer set programming, constraint programming, linear programming and more. We used these explanations to build learning solvers and discussed how learning solvers can be extended with a conflict analysis method, effectively resulting in a generalisation of CDCL for arbitrary proof systems. Finally, we discussed several patterns of modular expressions for which more precise propagation is possible than what would be obtained by creating the propagators following the compositional rules.\nThe main contribution of the paper is that we provide an abstract account of propagators, solvers, explanations, learning and conflict analysis, resulting in a theory that generalises many existing algorithms and allows integration of technology of different fields. Our theory allows to build actual solvers for modular systems and hence provides an important foundation for the practical usability of modular systems.\nSeveral topics for future work remain. While the current theory provides a strong foundation, an implementation is still needed to achieve practical usability. We intend to research more patterns for which improved propagation is possible, and generalise the aforementioned underapproximations to our framework. The Algebra of Modular Systems has been extended with a recursion operator (see for instance [41]); researching what are good propagators for this operator is an open challenge."

Many expressive formalism used in practice solve the model expansion task, where a structure is given on the input and an expansion of this structure in the defined class of structures is searched (this practice overcomes the common undecidability problem for expressive logics). In this paper, we construct a solver for the model expansion task for a complex modular systems from an expression in the algebra and black-box propagators or solvers for the primitive modules. To this end, we define a general notion of propagators equipped with an explanation mechanism, an extension of the algebra to propagators, and a lazy conflict-driven learning algorithm. The result is a framework for seamlessly combining solving technology from different domains to produce a solver for a combined system.",
