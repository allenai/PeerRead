      "text" : "Weighted finite automata (Mohri, 2009), including hidden Markov models and conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001), are used to solve a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) problems, including phonology and morphology, part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and others. Even models for speech recognition and phrase-based translation can be thought of as extensions of finite automata (Mohri et al., 2002; Kumar et al., 2005).\nAlthough the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) is now de rigeur in applications of neural networks and made easy through toolkits like Theano (Theano Development Team, 2016), there has been little previous work, to our knowledge,\non acceleration of weighted finite-state computations on GPUs (Narasiman et al., 2011; Li et al., 2014; Peng et al., 2016; Chong et al., 2009). In this paper, we consider the operations that are most likely to have high speed requirements: decoding using the Viterbi algorithm, and training using the forward-backward algorithm. We present an implementation of the Viterbi and forward-backward algorithms for CUDA GPUs. We release it as open-source software, with the hope of expanding in the future to a toolkit including other operations like composition.\nMost previous work on parallel processing of finite automata (Ladner and Fischer, 1980; Hillis and Steele, 1986; Mytkowicz et al., 2014) uses dense representations of finite automata, which is only appropriate if the automata are not too sparse (that is, most states can transition to most other states). But the automata used for natural language tend to be extremely large and sparse. In addition, the more recent work in this line assumes deterministic automata, but automata that model natural language ambiguity are generally nondeterministic.\nPrevious work has been done on accelerating particular NLP tasks on GPUs: in machine translation, phrase-pair retrieval (He et al., 2013) and language model querying (Bogoychev and Lopez, 2016); parsing (Hall et al., 2014; Canny et al., 2013); and speech recognition (Kim et al., 2012). Our aim here is for a more general-purpose collection of algorithms for finite automata.\nOur work uses concepts from the work of Merrill et al. (2012), who show that GPUs can be used to accelerate breadth-first search in sparse graphs. Our approach is simple, but well-suited to the large, sparse automata that are often found in NLP applications. We show that it achieves a speedup of a factor of 5.2 on a GPU relative to a serial algorithm, and 6093 relative to OpenFST.\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n03 03\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n7 Ja\nn 20\n17"

      "heading" : "2.1 Architecture",
      "text" : "CUDA cores (also known as scalar processors) are grouped into different Streaming Multiprocessors (SM) on the graphics card. The number of cores per SM varies depending on the GPU’s microarchitecture, ranging from 8 cores per SM (Tesla) up to 192 (Kepler). The overall number of SM on the chip varies, and it can range from 15 (Kepler) up to 24 (Maxwell). Streaming Multiprocessors are composed of the following components:\n• Special Function units (SFU) These allow computations of functions such as sine, cosine, etc.\n• Shared Memory and L1 Cache The size of the memory varies on the GPU model.\n• Warp Schedulers assigns threads in an SM to be executed in a specific warp.\nTo execute a workload on the GPU, a kernel must be launched with a specified grid structure. The kernel must specify the number of threads to run on a block and the number of blocks in a grid before being executed on the device. The maximum number of threads per block and blocks per grid can vary depending on the GPU device. If the kernel is successfully launched, each block in the grid will get assigned to a SM. Each SM will execute 32 threads at a time (also called a warp) in its assigned block. If the number of threads in a block is not divisible by 32, the kernel will not launch on the device. Each SM contains a warp scheduler in charge of choosing the warps in a block to be executed in parallel. When the amount of blocks in a grid surpasses the amount of SM on the device, the SMs will execute a subset of blocks in parallel.\nThe memory hierarchy on the device is laid out to maximize the data throughput. Table 1 shows the amount of cores available for execution as well as the amount of memory available on a Kepler based GPU. Registers are the fastest type of memory on the device, and this memory is private to each thread running on a block. Shared memory is the second fastest, and is shared by all threads running in the same block. The next type of memory is the L2 cache, which is shared among all streaming multiprocessors. The slowest and largest type of memory is global memory. Directly reading and writing to global memory affects performance significantly. Efficient memory management (reading and writing to and from contiguous addresses in memory) is important to fully utilize the memory hierarchy and increase performance."

      "heading" : "2.2 Optimizations",
      "text" : "Different factors such as number of threads in a block or coalesced memory accesses affect the performance on the GPU. In this section, we will cover the methods and modifications we used to improve the performance of our parallel implementations.\nThe optimal number of threads per block depends on the device configuration. The number of multiprocessors and cores per multiprocessor must be considered before launching a CUDA kernel on the device. Table 1 shows the number of streaming multiprocessors and the number of cores per multiprocessor on a K40 GPU. Multiple blocks in a kernel grid can get scheduled to be executed on a single streaming multiprocessor if the number of blocks in a grid exceeds the number of streaming multiprocessors. Each streaming multiprocessor will only execute one warp in a block in parallel during execution, and that is why choosing an appropriate number of blocks is important. For example, if two blocks get assigned to a multiprocessor and each block contains 192 threads, the\nmultiprocessor must execute 12 warps total where 1 warp gets executes at a time in parallel.\nIn our implementations, we take the following approach. The number of cores per multiprocessor is considered first to configure the block size. The block size is set to contain the same number of threads as the number of cores per multiprocessor of the graphics card used. If the number of threads needed to perform a computation is not divisible by the amount of cores per multiprocessor, the number of threads is rounded up to the closest dividend. Once the block size and number of threads are selected, the number of blocks is chosen by dividing the total number of threads by the block size.\nCoalesced memory accesses are essential to maximize the use of resources running on the GPU. When data is requested by a warp executing on a streaming multiprocessor, a block from global memory will be accessed and allocated in shared memory. It is crucial to coalesce memory accesses so the number of blocks of global memory requested and the global memory access times decrease. This can be achieved by making all threads in a warp access contiguous spaces in memory. A similar speedup can be achieved if each thread in a block allocates all the data required from global memory into a compact data structure allocated in shared memory (size of the shared memory varies across devices). Section 4 describes the data structure used to coalesce memory reads. For each input symbol wt the source states of all possible transitions can be read in a coalesced form and stored in shared memory allowing faster execution times.\nUsing special function units on the device can inhibit the performance of a program running on the GPU. Performance is affected because the number of SFU is lower than the amount of regular cores (e.g. The GK104 Kepler architecture contains 1536 regular cores and 256 special function units total). Also, the cycle penalty for using SFU rather than CUDA cores is higher than the penalty for regular cores on the device. For this work, the amount of instructions that use a specific SFU are kept to a minimum to obtain a higher speedup. By combining the mentioned techniques in this section, an application can significantly increase its performance."

      "heading" : "3 Weighted Finite Automata",
      "text" : "In this section, we review weighted finite automata, using a matrix formulation. A weighted finite automaton is a tuple M = (Q,Σ, s, F, δ), where\n• Q is a finite set of states.\n• Σ is a finite input alphabet.\n• s ∈ RQ is a one-hot vector: if M can start in state q, then s[q] = 1; otherwise, s[q] = 0.\n• f ∈ RQ is a vector of final weights: if M can accept in state q, then f [q] > 0 is the weight incurred; otherwise, f [q] = 0.\n• δ : Σ → RQ×Q is the transition function: if M is in state q and the next input symbol is a, then δ[a][q, q′] is the weight of going to state q′.\nNote that we currently do not allow transitions on empty strings or epsilon transitions. This definition can easily be extended to weighted finite transducers by augmenting the transitions with output symbols. See Figure 1 for an example FST.\nUsing this notation, the total weight of a string w = w1 · · ·wn can be written succinctly as:\nweight(w) = s>  n∏\nt=1\nδ[wt]  f . (1) Matrix multiplication is defined in terms of multiplication and addition of weights. It is common to redefine weights and their multiplication/addition to make the computation of (1) yield various useful values. When this is done, multiplication is often written as ⊗ and addition as ⊕. If we define p1⊗p2 = p1 p2 and p1⊕p2 = p1+p2, then equation (1) gives the total weight of the string.\nOr, we can make Equation (1) obtain the maximum weight path as follows. The weight of a transition is (p, k), where p is the probability of the transition and k is (a representation of) the transition itself. Then\n(p1, k1) ⊗ (p2, k2) ≡ (p1 p2, k1k2) (p1, k1) ⊕ (p2, k2) ≡ (p1, k1) if p1 > p2(p2, k2) otherwise.\nThe Viterbi algorithm simply computes Equation (1) under the above definition of weights."

Several of these automata algorithms are related to one another and used for learning and inference. Speeding up these algorithms will allow faster training and development of large scale machine learning systems.\nThe forward and backward algorithms are used to compute weights (Eq. 1), in left-to-right (Reading an input utterance from left to right) and rightto-left order, respectively. Their intermediate values are used to compute expected counts during training by expectation-maximization (Eisner, 2002). They can be computed by Algorithm 2.\nAlgorithm 1 is one way of computing Viterbi using Equation (1). It is a straightforward algorithm, but the data structures require a brief explanation.\nThroughout this paper, we use zero-based indexing for arrays. Let m = |Σ|, and number the input symbols in Σ consecutively 0, . . . ,m− 1. Then we can think of δ as a three-dimensional array. In general, this array is very sparse. We store it using a combination of compressed sparse row (CSR) format and coordinate (COO) format, as shown in Figure 2 where:\n• z is the number of transitions with nonzero weight\n• R is an array of length (m + 1) containing offsets into the arrays S ,T ,O, and P. if a ∈ Σ, the transitions on input a can be found at positions R[a], . . .R[a + 1]− 1 (i.e. to access all transitions δ[a] ).

For the forward-backward algorithm, sorting by target improves the performance for the backward pass since the input is read from right to left.\nFor each input symbol wt, one thread is launched per transition, that is, for each nonzero entry of the transition matrix δ[wt]. Equivalently, one thread is launched for each transition k such that R[wt] ≤ k < R[wt + 1], for a total of R[wt + 1] − R[wt] threads. Each thread looks up q = S [k], q′ = T [k] and computes its corresponding operation.\nFor example, in Figure 2, input word “le” has index 0; since R[0] = 0 and R[1] = 2, two threads are launched, one for k = 0 (that is, 0 le:the/0.48−−−−−−−→ 1) and one for k = 1 (that is, 0 le:a/0.08−−−−−−→ 2)."

Because this update potentially involves\nconcurrent reads and writes at the same memory location, we use an atomic max operation (defined as atomicMax on the NVIDIA toolkit). However, atomicMax is not defined for floating-point values. Additionally, this update needs to store a back-pointer (k) that will be used afterwards to reconstruct the highest-probability path. The problem is that the atomicMax provided by NVIDIA can only update a single value atomically.\nWe solve both problems with a trick: pack the Viterbi probability and the back-pointer into a single 64-bit integer, with the probability in the higher 32 bits and the back-pointer in the lower 32 bits. In IEEE 754 format, the mapping between nonnegative real numbers and their bit representations (viewed as integers) is order-preserving, so a max operation on this packed representation updates both the probability and the back-pointer simultaneously.\nThe reconstruction of the Viterbi path is not parallelizable, but is done on the GPU to avoid copying α back to the host avoiding a slowdown. This generates a sequence of transition indices, which is moved back to the host. There, the output symbols can be looked up in array O."

Likewise, in the backward algorithm, we update the sum of probabilities starting from q in backward[t][q]. Both passes require atomic addition operations, but because we use log-probabilities to avoid underflow, the atomic addition must be implemented as:\nlog(exp a + exp b) = b + log1p(exp(a − b)), (2)\nassuming a ≤ b and where log1p(x) = log(1+ x), a common function in math libraries which is more numerically stable for small x.\nWe implemented an atomic version of this log-add-exp operation.

These approaches use parallel prefix sum to compute the weight (1), multiplying each adjacent pair of matrices in parallel and repeating until all the matrices have been multiplied together.\nThis approach could be combined with ours; we leave this for future work. A possible issue is that matrix-vector products are replaced with slower matrix-matrix products. Another is that prefix sum might not be applicable in a more general setting – for example, if a FST is composed with an input lattice rather than an input string."

First, if transition matrices are stored as dense matrices, then the forward algorithm becomes identical to forward propagation through a rudimentary recurrent neural network. Thus, a neural network toolkit could be used to carry out this computation on a GPU. However, in practice, because our transition matrices are sparse, this approach will probably be inefficient.\nSecond, off-the-shelf libraries exist for sparse matrix/vector operations, like cuSPARSE.1 However, such libraries do not allow redefinition of the addition and multiplication operations, making it difficult to implement the Viterbi algorithm or use log-probabilities. Also, parallelization of sparse matrix/vector operations depends heavily on the sparsity pattern (Bell and Garland, 2008), so that an off-the-shelf library may not provide the best solution for finite-state models of language. We test this approach below and find it to be several times slower than a non-GPU implementation."
