      "text" : "Many fundamental tasks in machine learning, such as classification, detection, require a large number of hand labeled samples (items) in practice. With the rise of online platform such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, it becomes possible to collect vast amount of labels with the help of enormous man power on the Internet. However, the labels obtained in this way are often unreliable and not accurate enough to serve as training samples, due to the non-expert online workers and the anonymous nature of the platform. One straight forward approach is to collect multiple labels for each item and use the label who has the most workers’ acceptance (Majority Voting). But, can we do better in crowdsourcing to estimate the true labels from the crowdsourced noisy labels?\nObserving that different workers may have different talents, Dawid and Skene [1979] develop a maximum likelihood approach based on the idea that each worker has a confusion matrix. More precisely, suppose that the items can be divided into k classes, and assume that each worker is associated with a k × k confusion matrix, where the (l, c)-th entry represents\nthe probability that a randomly chosen item in class l is labeled as class g by the worker. The true labels and the worker confusion matrices are jointly estimated by maximizing the marginal log-likelihood of the observed labels, where the unobserved true labels are treated as hidden variables. However, the value of the likelihood is extremely difficult to calculate, as the number of terms, whose sum is the likelihood of the observed labels, is exponentially growing with respect to the number of items. Instead, the worker confusion matrices are estimated iteratively by a Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure McLachlan and Krishnan [2007].\nUnfortunately, the memory consumption of Dawid-Skene scheme increases linearly with the size of data, as the intrinsic structure of this methods requires to access all the data in each iteration. Due to the same reason, Dawid-Skene algorithm has difficulty when the data frame is supplied to the system indefinitely. Notice that in reality, it is highly possible that we can only collect worker labels in an indefinite manner. For example, different worker may have different labeling speed and we may want to add more items to some classes afterwards. Therefore, it is of great interests to derive an online version of Dawid-Skene algorithm, which can still achieve comparable accuracy.\nIn this paper, we provide an online version of Dawid-Skene algorithm, which requires only one data frame for each iteration. For the ease of presentation and analysis, we consider the simple model, i.e., at each iteration, one item and its corresponding labels are supplied to the online algorithm. This simple setup can be easily generalized to more general cases. We show that, under some non-restrictive conditions, the online Dawid-Skene scheme converges to a stationary point of the marginal log-likelihood of the observed labels. Notice that, since the marginal log-likelihood is non-convex, the original Dawid-Skene scheme only guarantees to converge to a stationary point as well.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we compare and contrast our work with related literature. In Section 3, we introduce the notations and then formulate the crowdsourcing problem rigorously. Next, in Section 4, the mathematical form of Dawid-Skene scheme is revisited. Then, the online algorithm is presented in Section 5. After that, theoretical analysis of online Dawid-Skene scheme is included in Section 6. Then, empirical performance is investigated in Section 7. Finally, the conclusion is in Section 8."

      "text" : "In the existing literature, depending on different practical situations, there are many methods [Liu et al., 2012; Ghosh et al., 2011; Karger et al., 2013, 2014; Dalvi et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014] developed and improved based on the Dawid-Skene algorithm [Dawid and Skene, 1979]. In particular, when we only have two classes, Ghosh et al. [2011] propose a method using Singular Value Decomposition to moderate online content given crowdsourced user ratings. Based on the assumption that each worker labels all items, Ghosh et al. [2011] show that if the number of observations increases, their algorithm can infer the quality of contributions with error that converges to zero. Dalvi et al. [2013] relax the assumption that the graph between worker and item is either random or complete and propose another SVD-based algorithm which considers arbitrary worker-item graph. Also, under the one coin model setting and considering random regular worker-item graph, Karger et al. [2014] uses an iterative approach to infer the true binary labels and later generalize it to multi-class labeling tasks in Karger et al. [2013]. Focusing on learning a classifier, Chen et al. [2013]; Raykar et al. [2010]; Liu et al. [2012] proposes a Bayesian algorithm by imposing a prior distribution on the experts. By assuming that labels are generated by a probability distribution over workers, items, and labels Zhou et al. [2012, 2014] propose an algorithm by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the probability distribution and the unknown truth. This method can also output item difficulty and worker expertise as by-products. Zhou et al. [2014] observe that it is difficult to distinguish between two adjacent ordinal classes while distinguishing between two far-away classes is much easier and they propose an algorithm based on minimax conditional entropy. Initialization is very important for DawidSkene algorithm, as it aims to maximize a nonconcave function. Addressing this issue, Zhang et al. [2014] propose to initialize Dawid-Skene algorithm using spectral methods and show that the resulting algorithm has a high probability to converge to the global optimum.\nOur work is motivated by stochastic approximation methods and variants of online EM algorithms [Cappé and Moulines, 2008; Sato and Ishii, 2000; Delyon, 2000; Zhang and Liang, 2008; Kushner and Yin, 1997]. In particular, Cappé and Moulines [2008] replace the Expectation step by a stochastic approximation step to derive an online EM algorithm for latent data models, while our online algorithms can be seen as replacing the Maximization step by a stochastic approximation step. Further, Cappé and Moulines [2008] prove that, under some conditions, the online EM converges to a stationary points of the KL divergence between the marginal distribution of the observation and the model distribution, while we prove that our online Dawid-Skene scheme convergence to a stationary point of the the marginal log-likelihood functions. Notice our result directly connects to the objective function that we want to maximize. Sato and Ishii [2000] propose an online EM algorithm for Normalized Gaussian Network by introducing a discount factor to forget the previous incorrect estimated parameters. Later, Sato [2000] shows that if the probability\ndistributions for both observed and unobserved data belong to an exponential family, then their algorithm converges to the corresponding stationary point of the marginal log-likelihood function. But, this is not applicable to our case, as under the crowdsourcing setting, the joint probability distribution does not belong to the exponential family defined in Sato [2000]."

Correspondingly, the M step can be seen as calculating C based on S.\nIn order to define the online algorithm rigorously, we need to make some assumptions on how the labels are supplied to the online algorithm. One obvious choice is that we select one of the n objects randomly and supply its corresponding labels to the online algorithm at each iteration.

Define O to be the set of zeros of function T, i.e. O = {S|T(S) = 0}. Assume O is finite and there exists non-negative continuously differentiable function V1, V2 with domain D and a compact set K ⊂ O such that\n1. for all S ∈ D, 〈∇V1(S),T(S)〉 ≤ 0.\n2. {S| 〈∇V1(S),T(S)〉 = 0} = O.\n3. lim S→∂D V2(S) = ∞.\n4. for all S /∈ K, 〈∇V2(S),T(S)〉 < 0.\nRemark:\n• Assumption (2) is based on the existence of two Lyapunov functions, i.e. V1 and V2. The existence of a Lyapunov is a standard condition to prove the asymptotic stability in stochastic approximation theory.\n• The existence of a Lyapunov function is usually theoretically non-restrictive, as is critical to the convergence of the trajectories of the corresponding vector field, see Delyon [2000, 1996]; Hahn and Baartz [1967] for more information.\nFor Dawid-Skene Scheme, we mainly focus on the open set D, as the joint distribution is not defined on the boundary of D. But, this provides difficulties for analyzing the the asymptotic properties, as C(j) may converge to the boundary. The naive way to avoid this difficulty is to assume that the stationary points lie inside a compact subset of D. A more elegant projection procedure is proposed in Chen et al. [1987]; Delyon [2000]. Thus, in the following analysis, we focus on the projected version of (7). Considering the projection procedure in Delyon [2000], we assume that there is a sequence of compact sets Kt, t = 0, 1, 2, · · · , whose union is D. Then, we begin with t = 1, at each iteration j, S(j) is out of Kt, its value is reset arbitrarily in K0 and we increase t by one. Mathematically, we consider the following algorithm\nŝilg(j) = silg(j − 1)+\nηj (P (yj = l|C(j − 1), zj)1(zij = g)− silg(j − 1)) ,\nif Ŝ(j) ∈ Ktj−1 , then S(j) = Ŝ(j), tj = tj−1,\nif Ŝ(j) /∈ Ktj−1 , then S(j) = S ′ ∈ K0, tj = tj−1 + 1,\nwhere S ′ is chosen arbitrarily from K0 and we use the following notation to denote the projected version of Dawid-Skene Scheme:\nsilg(j) pr = silg(j − 1)\n+ ηj (P (yj = l|C(j − 1), zj)1(zij = g)− silg(j − 1)) . (10)\nTheorem 1. Under Assumption 1 and 2, the online DawidSkene Scheme with projection (10) converges to a stationary point C∗ of the marginal log-likelihood (2), i.e.,\n∂l(C)\n∂C\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣\nC∗ = 0.\nProof. We divide the proof into the following three steps: Step1: in this step, we prove that all the points in O are stationary points of the marginal log-likelihood (2). To do this,\nwe first show that Dawid-Skene Scheme converges to one of the zeroes of the function T. Notice that each Expectation and Maximization step is equivalent to the following iterative steps\n1. Give C, calculate S, where the (i, l, g)-th entry of S is\nsilg = 1\nn\nn ∑\nj=1\nP (yj = l|C,Z)1(zij = g). (11)\n2. Given S, calculate C by\nC = G(S). (12)\nLet S∗ be one of the points to which Dawid-Skene Scheme converges, i.e. S∗ will stay unchanged after updating using iterative steps (11) and (12). So, we have\ns∗ilg = 1\nn\nn ∑\nj=1\nP (yj = l|G(S ∗),Z)1(zij = g). (13)\nWriting (13) compactly, we have T(S∗) = 0. Thus, DawidSkene Scheme converges to one of the zeroes of the function T. Since Q(C|Ĉ) is continuous in both C and Ĉ, by Theorem 3.2 in McLachlan and Krishnan [2007], we know that DawidSkene Scheme converges to a stationary point of the marginal log-likelihood (2). Clearly, any point in O can be a convergent point of Dawid-Skene Scheme. So, we have\nO ⊆\n{\nC∗ | C∗ ∈ D and ∂l(C)\n∂C\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣\nC∗ = 0\n}\n.\nStep2: in this step, we show that the online Dawid-Skene Scheme can be seen as using stochastic approximation methods to find the zeroes of T . Notice that, at iteration j, for all i ∈ [m], l ∈ [k], g ∈ [k], {silg(j)} are updated based on the value\nP (yj = l|C(j − 1), zj)1(zij = g),\nwhich can be seen as a function of (C(j − 1), zj). Thus, we define the function F(C, z) : D× [k]m 7→ [0, 1)m×k×k as\nF(C, z) = A,\nwhere the (i, l, g)-th entry of A is\nailg = P (y = l|C, z)1(zi = g)\n= exp\n(\n∑m i=1 ∑k g=1 1(zi = g) log(cilg)\n)\n∑k l′=1 exp ( ∑m i=1 ∑k g=1 1(zi = g) log(cil′g) ) .\nNext, suppose z is sampled form {z1, z2, · · · , zn} uniformly, given S ∈ D, we have\nE [F(G(S), z)] = 1\nn\nn ∑\nj=1\nF(G(S), zj) = T(S) + S.\nAlso notice that, using function F, the online step (10) can be written compactly as\nS(j) pr = S(j − 1)\n+ ηj (F(G(S(j − 1)), zj)− S(j − 1)) . (14)\nUnder assumption(1), at iteration j, zj is sampled form {z1, z2, · · · , zn} uniformly. So, we have\nT(S(j − 1)) = E [F(G(S(j − 1)), zj)− S(j − 1)] . (15)\nThe online iterative step (14) have the same form as Robbins-Monro algorithms Robbins and Monro [1951]; Kushner and Yin [1997]; Delyon [2000], which is used to find the zeros of function T. Step3: in this step, we show that the online Dawid-Skene Scheme converges to a stationary point of of the marginal loglikelihood (2). Given C ∈ D, since the function F is bounded for all z ∈ {z1, z2, · · · , zn}. Thus, if z is selected uniformly from {z1, z2, · · · , zn}, we have for any compact set K̃ ⊂ D\nsup C∈K̃\nE [ ‖F(C, z)‖2F ] < ∞.\nUnder assumption (2) and (1), by Theorem 12 in Delyon [2000] (or equivalently stochastic approximation theories in Zhang and Liang [2008]; Kushner and Yin [1997]), we have\nS(j) → S∗ for some S∗ ∈ O such that T(S∗) = 0.\nRemark: • Sato [2000] shows that if the distribution P (x, z|θ) for\nboth observed data x and missing data z belongs to the following exponential family\nP (x, z|θ) =\nexp [〈R(x, z), θ〉+R0(x, z) −M(θ)] , (16)\nwhere θ denotes the parameters of interests, R(x, z) denote the set of sufficient statistics and M(θ) is the normalization factor defined by\nexp [M(θ)] = ∫ ∫\nexp [〈R(x, z), θ〉+R0(x, z)] dxdz.\nThen, the online EM algorithm converges to a stationary point of the corresponding marginal log-likelihood function. Notice this result does not apply to our case, as for Dawid-Skene Scheme, the probability distribution is not of the form (16). Comparing the proofs, Sato [2000] treats the online algorithm as a stochastic gradient method with the inverse of the Fisher information matrix being the coefficient matrix, while we prove our results by finding the zeros of the function T.\n• Alternatively, one can use the results provided in Cappé and Moulines [2008] to show that the online Dawid-Skene Scheme converges to a stationary point of the KL divergence between the induced partial distribution P (y|C) and true distribution P̂ for y, while our results directly connects to the marginal log-likelihood function that Dawid-Skene Scheme tries to maximize.\n• Notice that due to nonconvexity, the best Dawid-Skene Scheme can hope to achieve is to converge to a stationary point of the marginal log-likelihood (2). Under Assumptions 1 and 2, our result means that the online Dawid-Skene Scheme is as good as the original one."

On the contrary,\nrapid decreasing of ηj means the online scheme forgets the past slowly and learns from new information at a low rate. Thus, the speed of decreasing the learning rate ηj is a tradeoff between learning and forgetting. Next, we investigate how to choose the learning rate in order to get the most accurate results.\nIn our experiment, two online algorithms corresponding to two set of step sizes (learning rate) satisfying Condition (8) are considered. Specifically, one set of step sizes are chosen to be decreasing linearly with respect to the number of iterations and the corresponding online algorithm is referred as online1. The other set of step sizes are chosen to be decreasing slower than linear with respect to the number of iterations and we call the corresponding online scheme online2.

The reason to choose the WEB data set is because it is relatively more complicated and has more samples, which makes the online algorithm more sensitive with respect to the tunable variables.\nThe experiment results are illustrated in Figure 1. The best error rate that online1 can get is 14.21 when a = 2, b = 1.5 and online2’s best record is 14.32 when a = 0.99, b = 0.4. For online1, the lowest error rate is achieved at a = 2, which means that both learning too fast or too slow will hurt the performance. For online2, when the step size decreases too slow, i.e. a = 0.75, online2 have the worst error rate. Morever, online2 can get smaller error rate when a is closer to 1, which suggests that decreasing the learning rate linearly might be a good choice."

Observing that different workers may have different talents, Dawid and Skene [1979] develop a maximum likelihood approach based on the idea that each worker has a confusion matrix. More precisely, suppose that the items can be divided into k classes, and assume that each worker is associated with a k × k confusion matrix, where the (l, c)-th entry represents the probability that a randomly chosen item in class l is labeled as class g by the worker. The true labels and the worker confusion matrices are jointly estimated by maximizing the marginal log-likelihood of the observed labels, where the unobserved true labels are treated as hidden variables. However, the value of the likelihood is extremely difficult to calculate, as the number of terms, whose sum is the likelihood of the observed labels, is exponentially growing with respect to the number of items. Instead, the worker confusion matrices are estimated iteratively by a Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure McLachlan and Krishnan [2007]. Unfortunately, the memory consumption of Dawid-Skene scheme increases linearly with the size of data, as the intrinsic structure of this methods requires to access all the data in each iteration.",

The DawidSkene algorithm, which is based on ExpectationMaximization update, has been widely used for inferring the true labels from noisy crowdsourced labels. However, Dawid-Skene scheme requires all the data to perform each EM iteration, and can be infeasible for streaming data or large scale data. In this paper, we provide an online version of DawidSkene algorithm that only requires one data frame for each iteration. Further, we prove that under mild conditions, the online Dawid-Skene scheme with projection converges to a stationary point of the marginal log-likelihood of the observed data. Our experiments demonstrate that the online DawidSkene scheme achieves state of the art performance comparing with other methods based on the DawidSkene scheme.",
