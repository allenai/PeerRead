{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "PixelVAE: A Latent Variable Model for Natural Images", "abstract": "Natural image modeling is a landmark challenge of unsupervised learning. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) learn a useful latent representation and model global structure well but have difficulty capturing small details. PixelCNN models details very well, but lacks a latent code and is difficult to scale for capturing large structures. We present PixelVAE, a VAE model with an autoregressive decoder based on PixelCNN. Our model requires very few expensive autoregressive layers compared to PixelCNN and learns latent codes that are more compressed than a standard VAE while still capturing most non-trivial structure. Finally, we extend our model to a hierarchy of latent variables at different scales. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on binarized MNIST, competitive performance on 64 \u00d7 64 ImageNet, and high-quality samples on the LSUN bedrooms dataset.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "UPDATE: The authors addressed all my concerns in the new version of the paper, so I raised my score and now recommend acceptance.\n--------------\nThis paper combines the recent progress in variational autoencoder and autoregressive density modeling in the proposed PixelVAE model. The paper shows that it can match the NLL performance of a PixelCNN with a PixelVAE that has a much shallower PixelCNN decoder.\nI think the idea of capturing the global structure with a VAE and modeling the local structure with a PixelCNN decoder makes a lot of sense and can prevent the blurry reconstruction/samples of VAE. I specially like the hierarchical image generation experiments.\n\nI have the following suggestions/concerns about the paper:\n\n1) Is there any experiment showing that using the PixelCNN as the decoder of VAE will result in better disentangling of high-level factors of variations in the hidden code? For example, the authors can train a PixelVAE and VAE on MNIST with 2D hidden code and visualize the 2D hidden code for test images and color code each hidden code based on the digit and show that the digits have a better separation in the PixelVAE representation. A semi-supervised classification comparison between VAE and the PixelVAE will also significantly improve the quality of the paper.\n\n2) A similar idea is also presented in a concurrent ICLR submission \"Variational Lossy Autoencoder\". It would be interesting to have a discussion included in the paper and compare these works.\n\n3) The answer to the pre-review questions made the architecture details of the paper much more clear, but I still ask the authors to include the exact architecture details of all the experiments in the paper and/or open source the code.

Showing that the PixelCNN improves the latent representation of the VAE with regard to some interesting task would be a much stronger result. \nAlso, while the paper claims, that combining the PixelCNN with the VAE reduces the number of computationally expensive autoregressive layers, it remains unclear how much more efficient their whole model is than an PixelCNN with comparable likelihood.\n\nIn general, I find the clarity of the presentation wanting.

It combines the best of both world: PixelCNN and VAE. State-of-the-art LL and visually appealing images.\n\nBelow are some comments and suggestions.\n\n1. In van dern Oord et al. 2016b they use an auto-encoder architecture with conditional PixelCNN as the decoder. It is not a variational one, though. It would be interesting to give a comparison between the model in this paper and their model. Are there any other differences, besides the KLD loss on latent variables and the (optional) hierarchical extension?\n\n2. The introduction of latent varibles z definitely helps modeling global structure, however it also breaks the chain rule so the exact likelihood cannnot be derived.\n\n3. How is the quality of representations learned by the encoder? Will the PixelCNN decoder help the encoder learn better representations, compared to Kingma et. al., \"Semi-supervised learning with deep generative models\"?\n\n3. Also, it would be great if you can show some reconstruction results, in addition to generated samples.\n\nBut overall I like this paper very much.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "07 Nov 2016 (modified: 08 Nov 2016)", "is_meta_review": false}], "SCORE": 7, "authors": "Ishaan Gulrajani, Kundan Kumar, Faruk Ahmed, Adrien Ali Taiga, Francesco Visin, David Vazquez, Aaron Courville", "KEYWORDS": "VAE with an autoregressive PixelCNN-based decoder with strong performance on binarized MNIST, ImageNet 64x64, and LSUN bedrooms.", "accepted": true, "id": ""}
