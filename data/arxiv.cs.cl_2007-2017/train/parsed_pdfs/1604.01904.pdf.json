      "text" : "Automatic text summarization is the process of creating a coherent, informative and short summary for a document. Text summarization approaches can be divided into two typical categories: extractive and generative. Extractive summarization simply selects a subset of existing sentences from original documents as summary. Despite of its simplicity, extractive summarization suffers from some intrinsic drawbacks, e.g., unable to generate coherent and compact summary in arbitrary length, especially when shorter than one sentence.\nIn contrast, generative summarization builds semantic representations of a document and creates a summary with sentences not explicitly presented in the original document. When the generated summary is required to be a single compact sentence, we name the summarization task as headline generation [4].\nGenerative summarization needs to accurately understand and represent the semantics of original document, and then generate informative summary according to document representations. Most previous works heavily rely on modeling la-\ntent linguistic structures of input document, such as syntactic parsing and semantic parsing, which always bring inevitable errors and degrade summarization quality.\nRecent years have witnessed great success of deep neural models for various natural language processing tasks [3; 19; 1; 14] including text summarization. Take neural headline generation (NHG) for example, it learns to build a large neural network, which takes a document as input and directly outputs a compact sentence as headline of the document. NHG exhibits the following advantages: (1) NHG is fully datadriven, requiring no human annotation and other linguistic information. (2) NHG is completely end-to-end, which does not explicitly model latent linguistic structures, and thus prevents error propagation. Moreover, the attention mechanism [1] is introduced in NHG, which learns a soft alignment over input document to generate more accurate headline [15].\nNHG has achieved great advantages as compared to conventional generative summarization methods. Nevertheless, NHG still confronts an important drawback: current NHG models are mostly optimized with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) over training data, without taking evaluation metrics of text summarization into consideration. It constraints the expected training objective within word level instead of sentence level and prevents NHG from capturing various aspects of summarization quality.\nTo address this issue, we argue that it is desirable to build NHG models in which parameters are tuned with respect to specific evaluation criteria such as ROUGE. We apply the minimum Bayes risk technique and perform minimum risk training (MRT) to develop NHG models. MRT aims at minimizing the expected loss over training data by taking automatic evaluation metric into consideration. Although MRT has been widely used in many NLP tasks such as statistical machine translation [12; 18; 6; 17], it has not been well considered in generative summarization, especially in NHG models.\nWe conduct experiments on two real-world datasets in English and Chinese respectively. Experiment results show that, NHG with MRT can significantly and consistently improve the summarization performance as compared to conventional NHG models and other baselines. Moreover, we explore the influence of employing different evaluation metrics and find the superiority of our model stable in MRT.\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n01 90\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 7\nA pr\n2 01\n6"

Denote the input document x as a sequence of words x = {x1, · · · ,xM} with M words, in which each word xi comes from a fixed word vocabulary V of size |V |. Headline generator aims to take x as input, and generates a short headline y = {y1, · · · ,yN} with length N < M , so as to maximize the conditional probability of y given x, i.e., arg max Pr(y|x).\nWe follow the Markov assumption to generate headline words yj in sequence, and the log conditional probability can be further formalized as:\nlog Pr(y|x; θ) = N∑ j=1 log Pr(yj |x,y<j ; θ), (1)\nwhere y<j = {y1, . . . ,yj−1}, θ indicates model parameters. That is, the j-th word yj in headline is generated according to all y<j generated in past and the input document x. In NHG, we design an encoder-decoder framework to parameterize Pr(yj |x,y<j ; θ). The framework is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe encoder of NHG takes the document x as input and encodes it into a low-dimensional vector c. More specifically, we apply recurrent neural networks (RNN) to get hidden states\nhi = f(xi,hi−1), (2)\nfor each input word xi, and then we obtain the vector c = g({h1, . . . ,hM}), where g is a function that combines hidden states.\nIn the decoder of NHG, we also employ RNN to obtain hidden states sj , and generate headline word by word based on c, sj and y<j , i.e.,\nPr(yj |x,y<j) = Pr(yj |c, sj ,y<j).

If the reset gate is close to 1, the update gate controls how much of previous hidden states will pass on. In GRU, hi and h̃i are generated hidden state and candidate activation. GRU calculates the i-th hidden state as follows:\nri = σ ( WrExi + Urhi−1 ) (4)\nui = σ ( WuExi + Uuhi−1 ) (5)\nh̃i = tanh ( WhExi + Uh(ri hi−1) ) (6)\nhi = ui hi−1 + (1− ui) h̃i (7)\nHere σ() is the sigmoid function, indicates element-wise multiplication, E ∈ RD×V is word embedding matrix, Wr,Wu,Wh ∈ RH×D and Ur,Uu,Uh ∈ RH×H are weighting matrices, with D and H denoting dimensions of word embeddings and hidden states respectively.

Given a document x, we define Y(x; θ) as the set of all possible headlines generated by NHG with parameters θ. Regarding y as the gold-standard headline of x, we define the loss of a generated headline y′ as semantic distance between y′ and the standard y, denoted as ∆(y′,y). MRT defines the objective function as follows:\nLMRT(θ) = ∑\n(x,y)∈D\nEY(x;θ)∆(y′,y). (16)\nHere EY(x;θ) indicates the expectation over the set Y(x; θ). Thus the objective function of MRT can be further formalized as:\nLMRT(θ) = ∑\n(x,y)∈D ∑ y′∈Y(x;θ) Pr(y′|x; θ)∆(y′,y). (17)\nMoreover, it is usually time-consuming and inefficient to enumerate all possible instances in Y(x; θ). For simplicity, we only sample a significant subset S(x; θ) ⊂ Y(x; θ) to approximate the probability distribution, and formalize the objective function as: LMRT(θ) = ∑\n(x,y)∈D ∑ y′∈S(x;θ) Pr(y′|x; θ) ∑ y∗∈S(x;θ) Pr(y ∗|x; θ) ∆(y ′,y),\n(18) in which is a hyper-parameter [12] that controls the smoothness of the objective function.

As we know, the most widely adopted evaluation metric for document summarization is ROUGE [11] (Recall-Oriented Understudy of Gisting Evaluation).

The basic idea of ROUGE is to count the number of overlapping units such as overlapped n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between computer-generated summaries and the standard summaries.\nIn this project, we consider two types of ROUGE: ROUGE-N and ROUGE-L. ROUGE-N counts n-grams, and ROUGE-L counts longest common sub-sequences.\nSuppose y′ is the generated summary, and y is the standard summary. ROUGE-N is defined as follows:\nROUGE-N =\n∑ gramN∈y\nM(gramN)∑ gramN∈y C(gramN) , (19)\nwhere N indicates the type of N-gram (e.g., uni-gram and bi-gram, corresponding to ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2),\nM(gramN) is the number of n-grams matched between y ′ and y, and C(gramN) is the total number of n-grams in y. ROUGE-L is formalized as:\nROUGE-L = (1 + β2)RLPL RL + β2PL .

In this progeress, we set the size to 100 to achieve a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.

For NHG+MLE on the English dataset, it takes about 3.75 hours to conduct 10, 000 of iterations, and for NHG+MRT, it is about 5.5 hours.

      "text" : "Headline generation is a well-defined task standardized in DUC-2003 and DUC-2004. Various approaches have been proposed for headline generation: rule-based, statisticalbased and neural-based, introduced in detail as follows.\nThe rule-based models create a headline for a news article using handcrafted and linguistically motivated rules to guide the choice of a potential headline. Hedge Trimmer [4] is a representative example of this approach which creates a headline by removing constituents from the parse tree of the first sentence until it reaches a specific length limit. Systems in this approach are in accordance with human intuition and easy to understand. However, it is unrealistic and impossible to induce every single rule due to the complexity of human languages.\nThe statistical-based methods make use of large scale training data to learn correlations between words in headlines and those in articles. For example, [2] applies statistical models\nfor content selection and surface realization to produce headlines. The best system on DUC-2004, TOPIARY [21] combines both linguistic and statistical information to generate headlines. There are also methods make use of knowledge bases to generate better headlines. For example, [20] utilizes Wikipedia to extract features like word inlinks, outlinks and categories to select keywords from an article and constitute a headline.\nRecently, with the advances of deep neural networks, there are growing works that design neural networks for headline generation. [15] proposes an attention-based model to generate headlines. This model introduces attention mechanism into sentence compression without recurrent unit. [5] proposes a recurrent neural network with long short term memory (LSTM) [7] for headline generation. This model regards headline generation as sentence compression, with words annotated as preserved or not to form the compressed sentence. This model is essentially an extractive model, unable to generate headlines with those words out of original document, which to some extent restricts its applicability.\nIn this work, we propose the NHG model realized by a bidirectional recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units. We also propose to apply minimum risk training (MRT) to optimize parameters of NHG model. MRT has been widely used in machine translation [12; 18; 6; 17], but less been explored in document summarization. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to utilize MRT in neural headline generation."

Recently, neural headline generation models have been proposed to take advantage of well-trained neural networks in learning sentence representations and mapping sequence to sequence. Nevertheless, traditional neural network encoder utilizes maximum likelihood estimation for parameter optimization, which essentially constraints the expected training objective within word level instead of sentence level. Moreover, the performance of model prediction significantly relies on training data distribution. To overcome these drawbacks, we employ minimum risk training strategy in this paper, which directly optimizes model parameters with respect to evaluation metrics and statistically leads to significant improvements for headline generation. Experiment results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems on both English and Chinese headline generation tasks.",
