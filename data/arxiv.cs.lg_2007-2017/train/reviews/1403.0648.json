{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Mar-2014", "title": "Multi-period Trading Prediction Markets with Connections to Machine Learning", "abstract": "We present a new model for prediction markets, in which we use risk measures to model agents and introduce a market maker to describe the trading process. This specific choice on modelling tools brings us mathematical convenience. The analysis shows that the whole market effectively approaches a global objective, despite that the market is designed such that each agent only cares about its own goal. Additionally, the market dynamics provides a sensible algorithm for optimising the global objective. An intimate connection between machine learning and our markets is thus established, such that we could 1) analyse a market by applying machine learning methods to the global objective, and 2) solve machine learning problems by setting up and running certain markets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Mar 2014 01:14:40 GMT  (109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0648v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG q-fin.TR stat.ML", "authors": ["jinli hu", "amos j storkey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1403.0648"}
