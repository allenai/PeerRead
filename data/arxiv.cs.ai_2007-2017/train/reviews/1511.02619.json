It is significantly more difficult than pure marginalization and MAP tasks, for which a large class of efficient and convergent variational algorithms, such as dual decomposition, exist. In this work, we generalize dual decomposition to a generic power sum inference task, which includes marginal MAP, along with pure marginalization and MAP, as special cases. Our method is based on a block coordinate descent algorithm on a new convex decomposition bound, that is guaranteed to converge monotonically, and can be parallelized efficiently. We demonstrate our approach on marginal MAP queries defined on real-world problems from the UAI approximate inference challenge, showing that our framework is faster and more reliable than previous methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Nov 2015 10:21:39 GMT  (1610kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02619v1", "NIPS 2015 (full-length)"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2015 (full-length)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.IT math.IT stat.ML", "authors": ["wei ping", "qiang liu", "alexander t ihler"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.02619"}
