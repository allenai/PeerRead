      "text" : "Automatic grammatical error detection and correction for natural languages has attracted increasing attention, for a large number of non-native speakers are learning or using foreign languages. Take English as an example. There are a large number of English learners around the world who need instantaneous accurate feedback to help improve their writings (Dahlmeier and Ng [2012]). In the domain of scientific paper writing in which English is the main language, authors also need effective grammar checkers to help them in composing scientific articles (Ford [2015]).\nThere have been several shared tasks addressing grammar errors in recent years. HOO-2011 (Dale and Kilgarriff [2011]), HOO-2012 (Dale, Anisimoff, and Narroway [2012]), CoNLL-2013 (Ng et al. [2013]) and CoNLL2014 (Ng et al. [2014]) shared tasks all aimed to correct grammar errors. The AESW shared task (Daudaravicius et al. [2016]) aimed to identify sentence-level grammar error. These shared tasks helped advanced the research of grammatical error detection or correction.\nDespite these advances, the scarcity of annotated data is still a major limitation on research of grammatical error detection and correction. Researchers need mass annotated data to train a grammar checker, but unfortunately for them, there are only a small amount of annotated corpora available in a limited number of domains. Most annotated corpora are in the domain of learner English, e.g. NUCLE (Dahlmeier, Ng, and Wu [2013]) and CLC (Nicholls [2003]), and others are from domains such as scientific papers, e.g. AESW dataset (Ford [2015]). In order to train their system with enough data, researchers use multiple corpus instead of one (Felice et al. [2014]).\nData scarcity is partly due to difficulties in building an elaborately annotated corpus needed for training of a grammatical error correction system, as is described by the team that built NUS Corpus of Learner English\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n08 98\n7v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n9 N\n(Dahlmeier, Ng, and Wu [2013]). In order to obtain a reliable annotation, they set up a guideline for annotators so that corrections are consistent. To ensure that these annotations are available, several annotators proposed their correction independently, and annotations most agreed upon are selected. Such annotating process is labour-intensive and time consuming, and the quality of the corpus are subject to human judgment and other factors such as budget. For example, their team is unable to perform double annotation for the main corpus due to budget constraints. They spent a long time (over half a year) to annotate only 1,414 essays.\nGiven these difficulties in building annotated corpus, we hope to utilize un-annotated error-free texts in unsupervised training of a grammatical error correction or grammatical error detection system. Previously, efforts have been made to explore how realistic grammatical errors could be counterfeited automatically from error-free texts and therefore obtain large amount of annotated data (Felice and Yuan [2014]; Foster and Andersen [2009]; Lee and Lee [2009]; Imamura et al. [2012]). We therefore follow the idea of building a corpus by generating artificial error, since there are vast amount of un-annotated texts available and most of them are error-free. We explored two ways of artificial error generation, which is proved to be effective in our experiment.\nTraining a system to correct grammatical errors might be a more difficult task when there is no supervision, since there are numerous error types and our method to generate artificial errors might not be sophisticated enough to cover all of them. We thus focus on grammatical error detection instead of correction. It is natural to address this task as binary classification, in which we make prediction of whether a word is grammatically correct."

In order to predict yt given the current word xt and the whole sentence X = (x1, x2, ..., xn), we need to find a function g(·) to calculate the conditional probability of each yt given xt and the whole input sequence X:\np(yt|xt) = g(xt, X), (1)\nwhere\nyt = { 1 correct 0 incorrect .

SVM is trained given a training dataset in the form of {(x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn)},\nwhere xi represents a token with a set of selected linguistic features, and yi denotes the grammatical correctness of the token. It finds a maximum-margin hyperplane that separates correct words from incorrect ones.\nThe problem with this approach is that we need to manually design features in xi. Since human are unable to tell precisely which features are relevant, human-designed features are inadequate in some aspects while being redundant in others. As a result, these designed features are unable to capture all regularities, which might hurt the performance of our error detector."

      "heading" : "2.3 Convolution Network with Fixed Window Size",
      "text" : "To circumvent the problem with feature engineering, a natural thought is to utilize the capability of neural networks in automatic feature extraction (Collobert and Weston [2008]). The simplest way is to take into consideration a fixed size window of words around the current word as its context by applying temporal convolution over the fixed size window. In the example sentence given in Section 2.1, when considering the grammatical correctness of the word ‘was’ given a context window of size 3, the context window would be birds was observed. The assumption that underlies this method is that only neighbouring words are grammatically related to the current word.\nHere we formalize the method of neural network with fixed size window. Given a word xi, its context ci is\nci = (xi−w/2, ..., xi, ..., xi+w/2). (3)\nLet f(·) denote a temporal convolution operation with the input frame size equal to the dimension of xi, the output frame size equal to 1, and the kernel width equal to the size of fixed window. A score si of the current word xi is calculated by si = f(ci) which represents grammatical features within the window. This score then goes through a sigmoid layer and yield the probability of yi: p(yi|xi, ci) = σ(si).\nThe first problem with this method is that it is incapable of capturing long-distance dependency. With a fixed window size, the error detector is unable to take into consideration word contexts beyond the window size, while long-distance grammatical dependency is quite common a phenomena. For example, in order to determine whether ‘was’ is incorrect, we would need to take ‘yesterday’ into consideration, which requires a large size of context window.\nAnother problem with this approach is that all words within the context window is taken into consideration indiscriminately. In the example above, ‘was’ might not care about what was done to the birds when determining the verb tense, but ‘observed’ is given equal attention regardless of the fact that it has no influence on verb tense."

In an LSTM recurrent neural network, the input X is processed through time and produces a series of memory states (c1, c2, ..., cn) and hidden states (h1, h2, ..., hn). In order to counterbalance the impact of time on hidden states we process the input X two times, forward and backward, to fully encode the information classifier needs.\nThe forward LSTM updates its memory state −→ci and hidden state −→ hi at each time step t:\n[ −→ ht ; −→ct ] = −−−−→ LSTM([ −−→ ht−1; −−→ct−1]). (4)\nSimilarly, memory state←−ci and hidden state ←− hi is updated by backward LSTM at time step t:\n[ ←− ht ; ←−ct ] = ←−−−− LSTM([ ←−− ht+1; ←−−ct+1]).

      "heading" : "3.1.2 Classifier with Intra-attention",
      "text" : "To predict whether the word at time step t is grammatically problematic, the classifier computes a score given the current word xt and its context at. This score st then goes through a sigmoid layer and makes a binary prediction, with 1 denoting grammatically correct and 0 denoting incorrect. Note that the Classifier does not hold its own state as a decoder does in a traditional encoder-decoder architecture.\nTo address the problem of long-distance dependency, we incorporate an intra-sentence attention mechanism (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio [2014]) in our classifier, where all hidden states of encoder is taken into consideration and the attention of classifier on all position of the sentence is dynamically adapted. To describe formally, we compute the context at around the word xt as an attention-weighted sum of {h̃1, h̃2, ..., h̃n}:\nat = ∑ i αt,i · h̃i, (7)\nwhere\nαt,i = exp(Et,i)∑ j exp(Et,j) , (8)\nEt,i = h̃t > · h̃i. (9)\nVector at represents the grammatical and semantic context at position t. A word is considered to be grammatically erroneous if the word xt does not fit into the current context, i.e. it is incompatible to place xt at position t given the context at. The score st is computed as follows:\nst = x > t ·W · at + b. (10)\nwhere b is the bias. Then the probability can be calculated as\np(y|xt, {x1, x2, ..., xn}) = σ(st). (11)\nBy incorporating intra-attention mechanism, we provide a latent structure for the model to learn grammatical relations between words. This makes a lot of sense because the grammaticality of a word is dependent more on the words that have strong grammatical relation with it, while others are negligible when making prediction. For example in Figure.1, when the model tries to determine whether ‘birds’ is correct in terms of noun number, it will pay a strong attention to ‘An’."

The key issue is how the corresponding {Y (n)}Nn=1 could be obtained.\nWe adopted the idea of using artificial error for training. It is crucial to find a suitable algorithm for the error generator to produce realistic grammatical error, since the performance of the model relies heavily on the paradigm it saw during training. Since our task is to detect grammatical error on word level, we only consider substitution errors. We compare two ways of substituting the original word for an erroneous one."

Although a number of annotated corpora have been established to facilitate data-driven grammatical error detection and correction approaches, they are still limited in terms of quantity and coverage because human annotation is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. In this work, we propose to utilize unlabeled data to train neural network based grammatical error detection models. The basic idea is to cast error detection as a binary classification problem and derive positive and negative training examples from unlabeled data. We introduce an attention-based neural network to capture long-distance dependencies that influence the word being detected. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms SVMs and convolutional networks with fixed-size context window.",
