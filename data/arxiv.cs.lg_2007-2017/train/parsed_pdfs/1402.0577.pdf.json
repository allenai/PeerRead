      "text" : "In statistics, latent variables (LVs), as opposed to observed variables (OVs), are random variables which are not directly measured. A wide range of statistical models, called latent variable models, relate a set of OVs to a set of LVs. In these models, LVs explain dependences among OVs and hence offer compact and intelligible insights of data. Moreover LVs allow to reduce data dimensionality and to generate conditionally independent variables, which considerably simplifies downstream analysis. Applications are numerous and cover many scientific fields. This is typically the case in domains such as psychology, sociology, economics, but also biological sciences and artificial intelligence, to cite some examples. Such fields may need complex constructs that cannot be observed directly. For instance, human personality in psychology and social class in socio-economics refer to higher level abstractions than observed reality.\nc©2013 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved."

      "text" : "Latent tree model (LTM)1 is a class of latent variable models which has received considerable attention. LTM is a probabilistic tree-structured graphical model where leaf nodes are observed while internal nodes can be either observed or latent. This model is appealing since its simple structure - a tree - allows simple and efficient inference, while its latent variables capture complex relationships.\nA subclass of LTMs was first developed in the phylogenetic community (Felsenstein, 2003). In this context, leaf nodes are observed taxa while internal nodes represent unobserved taxum ancestors. For instance, in molecular genetic evolution, which is the process of evolution at DNA scale, it is obviously hopeless to study DNA sequences in some dead species from collecting their DNA. Nevertheless, evolutionary latent models can be used to infer the most probable ancestral sequences knowing contemporary living species sequences. Neighbor joining represents one of the first algorithms developed for LTM learning in the phylogenetic context (Saitou & Nei, 1987; Gascuel & Steel, 2006). It is still very popular as it is quick to compute and it allows to find the optimal model in polynomial time under certain assumptions.\nDuring the past decade, LTMs in their general form have been under extensive investigation and have been applied to many fields. For instance they have been applied in human interaction recognition. Human interaction recognition is a challenging task, because of multiple body parts and concomitant inclusions (Aggarwal & Cai, 1999). For this purpose, the use of LTM allows to segment the interaction in a multi-level fashion (Park & Aggarwal, 2003): body part positions are estimated through low-level LVs, while overall body position is estimated by a high-level LV. LTMs have also been used in medical diagnosis (Zhang, Yuan, Chen, & Wang, 2008). In this context, LTMs provide a way to identify, through the LVs, the different syndrome factors which cannot be directly observed by the physician."

LTM must be paid attention because (i) it offers deep insights for latent structure discovery (Saitou & Nei, 1987), (ii) it can be applied to multidimensional clustering (Chen, Zhang, Liu, Poon, & Wang, 2012) and (iii) it allows efficient probabilistic inference (Wang, Zhang, & Chen, 2008). Somewhat surprisingly, no extensive review on this research area has been published.\nIn addition to the reviewing of the LTM research area, we also contribute an analysis and a perspective that advance our understanding of the subject. We establish a categorization of learning methods. We present generic learning algorithms implementing fundamental principles. These generic algorithms are partly different from those of the literature because they have been adapted to a broader context. Besides, the performances of all the algorithms of the literature are compared in the context of small, large and very large simulated and real datasets. Finally, we discuss future directions, such as the adaptation of LTM for continuous data.\n1. LTM has been previously called “hierarchical latent class model” (Zhang, 2004), but this name has been discarded because the model does not inherently reveal a hierarchy."

      "text" : "Before presenting LTM, we first need to define graph-related terms, which are illustrated in Figure 1. A graph G(V,E) is composed of a set of nodes V and a set of edges E ⊂ V×V. An edge is a pair of nodes (Va, Vb) ∈ E. The edge is undirected (noted Va−Vb) if (Vb, Va) ∈ E and directed (noted Va → Vb) if not.\nA directed graph is a graph whose all edges are directed. In a directed graph, a node Va is a parent of a node Vb if and only if there exists an edge from Va to Vb. The node Vb is then called the child of node Va. Nodes are siblings if they share the same parent. A node Vc is a root if it has no parent. A directed path from a node Vd to a node Va is a sequence of nodes such that for each node except the last one, there is an edge to the next node in the sequence. A node Va is a descendant of a node Vd if and only if there is a directed path from Vd to Va. The node Vd is then called an ancestor of node Va.\nAn undirected graph only contains undirected edges. In an undirected graph, a node Va is a neighbor of another node Vb if and only if there is an edge between them. A leaf is a node having only one neighbor. An internal node is a node having at least two neighbors. An undirected path is a path for which the edges are not all oriented in the same direction.\nA clique is a set of pairwise connected nodes (in a tree, a clique is simply an edge). A separator is a set of nodes whose removal disconnect two or more cliques (in a tree, a separator is simply an internal node). A tree T is a graph for which any two nodes are connected by exactly one path."

      "text" : "LTM is a tree-structured graphical model with latent variables. It is composed of a tree - the structure - T (V,E), and a set of parameters, θ. The tree can be either directed (i.e. a Bayesian network; Zhang, 2004) or undirected (i.e. a Markov random field; Choi, Tan, Anandkumar, andWillsky, 2011). Both representations are described in Figure 2. The set of nodes V = {V1, ..., Vn+m} represents n+m observed and latent variables. X = {X1, ...,Xn} is the set of observed variables and H = {H1, ...,Hm} is the set of latent variables. Leaf nodes are OVs while internal nodes can be either observed or latent. Variables can be either discrete or continuous. The set of k edges E = {E1, ..., Ek} captures the direct dependences between these variables.\nIn the directed setting (Figure 2a), the set of parameters θ consists of probability distributions, one for each variable. Given a variable Vi with parents PaVi , a conditional distribution P (Vi|PaVi) is defined. For a variable Vi that has no parent, a marginal distribution P (Vi) is defined instead. The joint probability distribution (JPD) of this model is\nformulated as:\nP (V) = Πn+mi=1 P (Vi|PaVi). (1)\nTo illustrate the model, let us take the example in Figure 2a. It is composed of a set of OVs {X1, ...,X7} and a set of LVs {H1,H2}. Its JPD writes as:\nP (X1, ...,X7,H1,H2) = P (X1|H1) P (X2|H1) P (X3|H1) P (H1|X7) P (X7) × P (X4|X7) P (H2|X7) P (X5|H2) P (X6|H2).\n(2)\nIn the undirected setting (Figure 2b), the set of parameters θ consists of probability distributions, one for each clique and separator. In LTM, cliques are edges while separators are internal nodes. Let {I1, ..., Ij} be the separators. The JPD of this model is formulated as:\nP (V) = Π(Va,Vb)∈E P (Va, Vb)\nΠmj=1 P (Ij) (d(Ij )−1)\n, (3)\nwhere d(Ij) is the degree of internal node Ij. The JPD of the undirected model in Figure 2b writes as:\nP (X1, ...,X7,H1,H2) = P (X1,H1) P (X2,H1) P (X3,H1) P (H1,X7) P (X4,X7)\nP (H1) P (H1) P (H1) P (X7)\n× P (X7,H2) P (X5,H2) P (X6,H2) P (X7) P (H2) P (H2) .\n(4)\nIn the following, for the seek of simplicity, we restrain the study to categorical variables, i.e. random variables which have a finite number of states. We also mainly focus on LTM whose internal nodes are all LVs. Most works on LTM have been developed for these two model settings."

LTM can be seen as multiple FMMs connected to form a tree. Given a data point, the probability of belonging to a particular class can be computed using the Bayes formula. This computation is called class assignment.\nIn an LTM, each LV Hj represents a partition of the data. For an observation ` and the vector of its values x` = {x`1, ..., x`n} on the set of OVs X, the probability of its membership to a class c of an LV Hj can be computed as follows:\nP (Hj = c|x`) = P (x`|Hj = c) P (Hj = c)\nP (x`)\n=\n∑\nH ′ P (x`,H′|Hj = c) P (Hj = c)\n∑k c=1 ∑ H ′ P (x`,H′|Hj = c) P (Hj = c)\n(5)\nwith H′ = H\\{Hj} and k the cardinality of Hj. From the last formula, the reader might get the impression that the complexity of class assignment is exponential. However, in trees,\nlinear2 - thus efficient - probabilistic inference, using message passing (Kim & Pearl, 1983), can be used to compute P (Hj = c|x`).\nProbabilistic inference of LV values has two applications: clustering and latent data imputation. Clustering using LTMs will be illustrated and seen in detail in Section 4.2. Latent data imputation is the process of inferring, for each observation `, the values of LVs. These variables are called imputed LVs. In Section 3.2.2, we will see that latent data imputation is at the basis of fast variable clustering-based LTM learning methods."

BIC is composed of two terms:\nBIC(T,Dx) = log P (Dx|θML, T )− 1\n2 dim(T ) log N, (6)\nwith θML the maximum likelihood parameters, dim(T ) the model dimension and N the number of observations. The first term evaluates the fit of the model to the data. It is computed through probabilistic inference of P (x`) for each observation `. The second term of the score penalizes the model according to its dimension, to prevent overfitting.\nIn models without latent variables, the dimension is simply calculated as the number of free parameters. This is sometimes called standard dimension. When LVs are present, standard dimension is no longer an appropriate measure of model complexity, and effective dimension should be used instead (Geiger, Heckerman, & Meek, 1996). Effective dimension is computed as the rank of the Jacobian matrix of the mapping from the model parameters to the OV joint distribution."

(7)\nIf two marginally equivalent models have the same dimension, they are equivalent models.\nA model M is parsimonious3 if there does not exist another model M′ that is marginally equivalent and has a smaller dimension. A parsimonious model has the best possible score. It does not contain any redundant LVs or any redundant latent classes. It represents the model to infer from data. Two conditions ensure that an LTM does not include any redundant LVs (Pearl, 1988):\n2. Actually, in trees, inference is linear with the number of edges |E|, and is thus also linear with the number n+m of observed and latent variables, because |E| ≤ n+m− 1. 3. The notion of parsimony is also called minimality by Pearl (1988).\n− An LV must have at least three (observed or latent) neighbors. If it has only two neighbors, it can simply be replaced by a direct link between the two.\n− Any two variables connected by an edge in the LTM are neither perfectly dependent nor independent.\nThere is also a condition ensuring that an LTM does not include any redundant latent classes. Let H be an LV in an LTM. The set of k variables Z = {Z1, ..., Zk} are the neighbors of H. An LTM is regular (Zhang, 2004) if for any LV H:\n|H| ≤ Π k i=1|Zi|\nmaxki=1 |Zi| . (8)\nZhang (2004) showed that all parsimonious models are necessarily regular. Thus the model search can be restricted to the space of regular models.

For a better understanding, we prefer to make the distinction between (complete) structure which includes LV cardinalities and partial structure which does not.\nthe edges and number of LVs in the graph. The trade-off between these two complexities has an important role to play when one wants to choose a model. This trade-off is illustrated in Figure 3. For instance, let us consider a latent class model (i.e. a model with only one LV, abbreviated LCM) versus an LTM having the same marginal likelihood (marginally equivalent models). The LCM is the model showing the highest LV complexity and the lowest partial structure complexity. It might have a low score if local dependences are present between OVs. At the opposite, the model with a low LV complexity and a high partial structure complexity, a binary tree with binary LVs, would also have a low score, because some LVs would be unnecessary. Depending on the application, a model showing a good trade-off between the two complexities should be preferred, because it would present a better score and might be easier to interpret."

In the first step, parameters are locally learned through a bottom-up LCM-based learning procedure explained as follows. An LV is first\n5. This learning procedure is very similar to the one proposed for binary trees by Harmeling and Williams (2011).\nchosen as a root of the LTM (line 1; note that this point will be discussed in detail in Section 3.2.5). In the rooted LTM, every LCM {X,H} is identified (line 5), i.e. every LV H whose all children are OVs X. Then, LCM parameters can be quickly learned through EM (line 6) and used to update current LTM parameters (lines 7 to 12). Once parameters have been learned for such an LCM, the distributions of unknown values of LV H can be probabilistically inferred for each observation6 (line 13; for more details, see Section 2.3, paragraph 2). These distributions can then be used as weighted observations. In their turn, these weighted observations will seed the learning processes for the LCMs on the (now observed) LVs Ho and remaining OVs which have not been used for LCM learning yet. Iterating the two operations (LCM learning and latent data imputation) leads to a bottomup LCM-based EM procedure enabling local and fast parameter learning of LTMs. Finally, LTM parameters are refined through global EM using as starting point the locally learned parameters (line 15). As with EM, we also provide the results of experiments evaluating the efficiency of random restarts (see Supplemental material B.1). Our results show that LCMB-EM converges better than EM.

Such as in the original message passing algorithm, all messages are recursively calculated starting from the leaves and going up to the root.\nThe drawback of the previous representation is that message passing still needs model parameters. To tackle this issue, the key is to recover P (x) using invertible transformations. Message matrices are then calculated by transforming each message Mj by two invertible matrices Lj and Rj (LjR −1 j = I):\nMi = Ti×̄1(Lj1L−1j1 Mj1Rj1L −1 j2 Mj2Rj2 ... L −1 jJ MjJRjJR −1 jJ 1i).

This leads to a very efficient computation of message passing only involving a sequence of singular value decompositions of empirical pairwise joint probability matrices. We refer to the work of Parikh et al. (2011) for more details about the singular value decomposition and spectral algorithm.

For each partial structure neighbor, the cardinalities of all LVs are optimized through addition or dismissal of a state relative to an LV. During the model search (partial structure and LV cardinality), candidate models are learned with EM and evaluated through a score. If the best candidate model shows a score superior to the current model score, then the former is used as a seed for the next step. Otherwise, NGS stops and the current model is considered as the best model. Therefore, at each step of the search, the learning approach necessitates to evaluate the score of a very large number of candidate models.

First, AGS focuses on a smaller space of models to explore than NGS (Zhang & Kocka, 2004b). The algorithm performs partial structure search and LV cardinality exploration simultaneously. For this purpose, two additional operators are used: addition and removal of a latent state for an LV.\nSecond, AGS follows a grow-restructure-thin strategy to reduce again the complexity of the search space (Chen, Zhang, & Wang, 2008; Chen et al., 2012). The strategy consists in dividing the five operators into three groups. Each group is applied at a given step of the model search. First, latent node and latent state introduction (NI and SI, respectively) are used to make the current model more complex8 (grow, line 3). Then, node relocation (NR) rearranges connections between variables (restructure, line 4). Finally, latent node and latent state deletion (ND and SD, respectively) make the current model simpler (thin, line 5).\nThird, one needs to assess the BIC score of candidate models. Learning parameters of the new models is thus required. To achieve fast learning, Chen et al. (2008, 2012) do not compute likelihood but instead the so-called restricted likelihood through the local EM procedure (line 12). The principle relies only on optimizing parameters of variables whose connection or cardinality was changed in the candidate model.

      "text" : "Binary tree learning represents the most simple situation. For instance, one can simply compute an agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Xu & Wunsch, 2005) to learn the LTM structure. This algorithm is called agglomerative hierarchical cluster-based learning (AHCB). For the purpose of clustering, pairwise mutual information (MI) represents a well-suited similarity measure between variables (Cover & Thomas, 1991; Kraskov & Grassberger, 2009). The MI between two variables Vi and Vj can be defined as follows:\nI(Vi;Vj) = ∑\nvi∈Vi\n∑\nvj∈Vj\np(vi, vj) log p(vi, vj)\np(vi) p(vj) . (15)\nSingle, complete or average linkage is used, depending on the cluster compactness required. The inferred hierarchy provides a binary tree (the partial structure) where leaf nodes are\nOVs and internal nodes are LVs (Wang et al., 2008; Harmeling & Williams, 2011). Then, LV cardinalities and parameters are learned (for details, see Section 3.2.4 and Section 3.1, respectively).\nIn AHCB, each cluster of the hierarchy represents an LV. The MI between an LV and the other variables (observed or latent) is approximated through a linkage criterion. Instead of this approximation, another solution consists in directly computing the MI between variables, whatever their status, i.e. observed or latent (Hwang, Kim, & Zhang, 2006; Harmeling & Williams, 2011). To compute MI, values of LVs are imputed through LCM-based learning. Algorithm 3 presents the LCM-based LTM learning (LCMB-LTM) algorithm9 implementing this solution. First, the working node set W is initialized with the set of OVs X = {X1, ...,Xn} (line 1). An empty graph is created on W (line 2). Then the pair of variables showing the highest MI, {Wi,Wj}, is selected (line 5). An LCM ({Wi,Wj},H) is learned (line 6), allowing to locally estimate the LV cardinality (through greedy search) and parameters, and then to impute values for H (line 7). Once values of H are known, it can be used as an observed variable (line 8). A new step of clustering, followed by LCM learning and LV value imputation, can then be performed. Iterating this step into a loop allows to construct an LTM through a bottom-up recursive procedure. At each step of the procedure, the parameters θlcm of the current LCM are used to update the current parameters θ\n′ of the LTM (line 10). If only two nodes are remaining, the two nodes are connected10 (line 12), the corresponding parameters are learned using maximum likelihood (line 13) and the loop is broken. After constructing the LTM, a final step globally learns LTM parameters using θ′ as a starting point (line 17). LCMB-LTM yields slightly better BIC results than AHCB for large datasets (Harmeling & Williams, 2011). LCMB-LTM is illustrated for a set of 4 variables {X1,X2,X3,X4} in Figure 5.\nHarmeling and Williams (2011) justified selecting the pair of variables showing the highest MI at each step of LCMB-LTM.

Indeed it might provide a better model faithfulness and interpretation because less LVs would be required. There are several ways to learn non-binary trees without necessitating too much additional computational cost. For instance, Wang et al. (2008) first learn a binary tree. Then, they check each pair of neighbor LVs in the tree. If the information is redundant between the two LVs (i.e. the model is not parsimonious), then the LV node which is the child of the other LV node is removed and the remaining node is connected to every child of the removed node. Although the approach of Wang et al. is rigorous, it can lead in practice to find trees which are very close to binary trees.\nAnother solution consists in identifying cliques of pairwise dependent variables to detect the presence of LVs (Martin & Vanlehn, 1995; Mourad, Sinoquet, & Leray, 2011). For this purpose, Mourad et al. propose to alternate two main steps: (i) at each agglomerative step, a clique partitioning method is used to identify disjoint cliques of variables; (ii) each such clique, containing at least two nodes, is connected to an LV through an LCM. For each LCM, parameters are learned using EM and LV data are imputed through probabilistic inference. In Algorithm 3 (line 5), it is possible to replace the selection of the pair of variables having the highest MI by a clique partitioning step where each clique leads to construct an LCM and to impute corresponding LV values."

Then it creates an LCM for each sibling cluster by introducing a latent variable and optimizing its cardinality as well as the model parameters. After that, it imputes the values of the latent variables and links the latent variables up to form a tree structure using Chow-Liu’s algorithm. The EM algorithm is run once at the end to optimize the parameters of the whole model. To highlight the difference between BI and the other variable clustering algorithms, we call the models it produces flat LTMs. Sibling cluster determination is the key step in BI. BI determines the sibling clusters one by one. To determine the first sibling cluster, it starts with the pair of variables with the maximum empirical MI. The cluster is expanded by adding other variables one after another. At each step, the variable that is the most dependent with the variables already in the cluster is added to the cluster. After that, a unidimensionality test (UD test) determines whether the dependences among all the variables in the cluster can be properly modeled with one latent variable. If the test fails, the expansion process is terminated and the first sibling cluster is determined. Thereafter, the same process repeats on the remaining observed variables until they are all grouped into sibling clusters."

We call this model “latent forest model” (LFM). It has many advantages over LTM, such as reducing the complexity of probabilistic inference (which depends on the number of edges). To learn LFM, there exists multiple approaches. For instance, in AHCB, one can use a cluster validation criterion to decide where to cut the hierarchy. Regarding LCMB-LTM (Algorithm 3), there are two options. On the one hand, Harmeling and Williams (2011) check the optimal cardinality of the current LV H (additional step after line 6). If its optimal cardinality equals 1, this means that the LV is not useful to the model under construction and the algorithm stops. On the other hand, after partitioning variables in cliques (which replaces the step in line 5), the algorithm of Mourad et al. (2011) terminates when only single-node cliques are discovered.\nTo build an LFM, one can also first construct an LTM and then use the independence testing method of Tan et al. (2011) for pruning non-significant edges. This method provides guarantees to satisfy structural and risk consistencies. Similar works for non-parametric analysis have also been developed by Liu et al. (2011). It is worth mentioning that, to ensure model parsimony, the pruning of non-significant edges in an LTM should be followed by the removal of latent nodes which are no longer connected to a minimum of three nodes."

For a special case of discrete tree models, called symmetric discrete tree models (Choi et al., 2011), distance has a simpler form. Symmetric discrete tree models are characterized by the fact that every variable has a uniform marginal distribution and that any pair of variables Vi and Vj connected by an edge in E verifies the following property:\np(vi|vj) = { 1− (K − 1) θij if vi = vj θij otherwise,\nwith K the cardinality common to Vi and Vj , and θij ∈ (0, 1/K), known as the crossover probability.

Then it iteratively selects two taxa i and j, and it creates a new taxum u to connect them. The selection of a pair seeks to optimize the following Q criterion:\nQ(i, j) = (n− 2) dij − n ∑\nk=1\ndik − n ∑\nk=1\ndjk, (21)\nwhere n is the number of taxa and dij is the additive tree distance between i and j. The distance between i and the new taxum u is estimated as follows:\ndiu = 1\n2 dij +\n1\n2(n − 2)\n(\nn ∑\nk=1\ndik − n ∑\nk=1\ndjk\n)\n, (22)\nand dju is calculated by symmetry. The distances between the new taxum u and the other taxa in the tree are computed as:\nduk = 1\n2 (dik − diu) +\n1 2 (djk − dju) . (23)\nThe success of distance methods such as NJ comes from the fact that they have been proved very efficient in terms of sample complexity. Under the Cavender-Farris model of evolution (Cavender, 1978; Farris, 1973), Atteson (1999) showed that it is possible to guarantee that maxi,j |dij − d̂ij| < with a probability at least δ if:\nN ≥ 2 ln ( 2n δ ) (1− exp(− ))2 ( exp ( max i,j dij ))2 , (24)\nwith N the number of mutation sites (i.e. the number of observations) and n the number of taxa (i.e. the number of OVs). Erdös et al.

Erdös et al. also proposed a new algorithm, called Dyadic Closure Method, with a sample complexity of a power of log n, when the mutation probabilities lie in a fixed interval. Daskalakis et al. (2009) proved the Steel’s conjecture (Steel, 2001) which states that if the mutation probabilities on all edges of the tree are less than p∗ = ( √ 2 − 1)/23/2 and are discretized, then the tree can be recovered in log n. Recently, Mossel et al. (2011) proved that log2 n suffices when discretization is not assumed.\nIn phylogenetics, the scientist is often faced with a set of different trees11 and the construction of a consensus tree is thus required.

(2011) restricted the learning to symmetric discrete distributions13 (see definition in Subsection Distances between Variables). This restriction presents a major advantage: it allows to derive model parameters through the use of distances previously learned by structure recovery. In other words, after learning the structure, there is no need to recover parameters through EM. This is due to the one-to-one correspondence between distance and model parameters (for more details, see Choi et al., 2011).\n12.

(2011) propose to first learn a minimum spanning tree (MST) based on distances between OVs. Then, in the tree, they identify the set of internal nodes. For each internal node Vi and its neighbor nodes nbd(Vi), they apply DBG which outputs a latent tree. In the global model, each subtree {Vi, nbd(Vi)} is then replaced by the corresponding latent tree. This strategy allows to reduce the computational complexity of latent tree construction because MST is fast to compute and DBG is only applied to a restricted number of variables. In term of sample complexity, DBG and its derived algorithms only require log n observations for recovering the model with high probability. This sample complexity is equal to the one of the Chow-Liu algorithm (Tan et al., 2011).\nAnother version of the DBG algorithm was developed when it is not assumed that observations have been generated by a genuine LTM. To prevent the incorporation of irrelevant LVs, after applying DBG on subtrees {Vi, nbd(Vi)}, only are integrated in the model those latent trees that increase the BIC score."

(2011) addressed the multivariate setting where observed and latent nodes are random vectors rather than scalars. Their approach can deal with general linear models containing both categorical and continuous variables. Another important improvement of their method is that sample complexity bound is given in terms of natural correlation conditions that generalize the more restrictive effective depth conditions of previous works (Erdos et al., 1999; Choi et al., 2011). The proposed extension consists in replacing the step in line 5 of Algorithm 4 by a quartet test14 relying on spectral techniques (more specifically, canonical correlation analysis; Hair, Black, Babin, and Anderson, 2009). Given four observed variables {X1,X2,X3,X4}, the spectral quartet test distinguishes between the four possible tree topologies (see Figure 8). The correct topology is {{Xi,Xj}, {Xi′ ,Xj′}} if and only if:\n|E[XiX>j ]|∗ |E[Xi′X>j′ ]|∗ > |E[Xi′X>j ]|∗ |E[XiX>j′ ]|∗, (25) where |M |∗ := Πk`=1σ`(M) is the product of the k largest singular values of matrix M and E[M ] is the expectation of M (estimated using the covariance matrix).\nOn the other hand, Song et al. (2011) proposed a non-parametric learning based on kernel density estimation (KDE) (Rosenblatt, 1956; Parzen, 1962). KDE is particularly relevant for model learning, in the case of non-Gaussian continuous variables showing multimodality and skewness. Given a set of N i.i.d. observed data Dx = {x1, ...,xN}, the joint distribution is modeled as :\nP (x) = 1\nN\nN ∑\ni=1\nn ∏\nj=1\nk(xj , x i j), (26)\nwith x = {x1, ..., xn} an observation, k(x, x′) the Gaussian radial basis function and N the number of observations.

The first authors to adapt them to LTM\nlearning were Chen and Zhang (2006).\nthrough a feature map φ : R → F .

Let CX := EX[⊗nj=1φ(Xj)] be the Hilbert space embedding of the KDE distribution P (X). The expectation of P (X) can be formulated as 〈CX,⊗nj=1φ(xj)〉Fn . By exploiting a given latent tree structure, the key is that Hilbert space embedding allows to decompose CX into simpler tensors. Similarly to the work of Parikh et al. (2011), message passing and parameter estimation are reformulated through tensor notation (see the work of Song et al., 2011, for more details). To learn the structure, a non-parametric additive tree metric is used. For two variables Vi and Vj, the distance is:\ndij = − 1\n2 log |CijC>ij |? +\n1 4 log |CiiC>ii |? + 1 4 log |CjjC>jj|?.

      "text" : "During LCM learning, LV cardinality can be determined through the examination of all possible values (up to a maximum) and then by choosing the one which maximizes a criterion, such as BIC (Raftery, 1986). For each cardinality value, parameters are required to calculate the likelihood appearing in the optimization criterion. For this purpose, random restarts of EM are generally used to learn parameters with a low probability of getting trapped in local maxima. The drawback is that this method cannot be applied to LTM learning, because EM becomes time-consuming when there are several LVs. A better solution consists in using a greedy search approach, starting with a preset value of LV cardinality (generally equal to 2) and incrementing it to meet the optimal criterion. However, this solution still remains computationally demanding (Zhang, 2004).\nTo tackle the issue of computational burden, several strategies have been proposed. For instance, one can simply set a small value for the LV cardinalities. Following this idea, Hwang and collaborators (2006) constrain LVs to binary variables. Because they worked on binary trees whose OVs are also binary, this restriction is not severe in practice. Nevertheless, in the case of non-binary OVs and/or non-binary trees, this very fast method presents several drawbacks: on the one hand, a too small cardinality can lead to an important loss\nof information; on the other hand, a too large cardinality can entail model overfitting and unnecessary computational burden.\nMore rigorous, Wang et al.’s approach (2008) relies on regularity (see Section 2.5). Knowing the cardinality of its neighbor variables Zi, the cardinality of an LV H is determined as follows:\n|H| = Π k i=1|Zi|\nmaxki=1 |Zi| . (28)\nThis very fast approach is efficient for LVs owning a few number of neighbors. Thus this is only practicable for binary trees or trees whose LV degrees are small (close to 3). In the context of large scale data analysis (several thousands of variables), Mourad et al. (2011) proposed to estimate the cardinality of an LV given the number of its children. The rationale underlying this approach is the following: the more child nodes an LV has, the larger the number of combinations is for the values of the child variables. Therefore, the cardinality of a latent variable should depend on the number of its child nodes. Nonetheless, to keep the model complexity within reasonable limits, a maximum cardinality is fixed.\nTwo additional methods have been proposed to offer a better trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. The first one uses a search-based agglomerative state-clustering procedure (Elidan & Friedman, 2001). The idea relies on the Markov blanket of an LV. In LTMs, the Markov blanket of an LV H, noted MBH , is composed of its parent and its children. The Markov blanket represents the set of variables that directly interact with H. Elidan and Friedman’s method sets the initial cardinality of H based on the empirical joint distribution ofMBH , noted P̂ (MBH). H is initialized to have a state for each configuration found in P̂ (MBH). Then the cardinality is repeatedly decreased through successive merging operations: states hi and hj, whose merging entails the best optimization of a given score, are merged. After repeating these operations till H has only one state, the cardinality value leading to the best score is selected. The second method relies on local and fast parameter estimation through LCM learning (Harmeling & Williams, 2011). As presented in the first paragraph of this section, a greedy search approach can be used. It starts with a preset value and increments it to meet an optimal criterion. This greedy search becomes efficient because, for each cardinality value to test, parameters are quickly learned in constant time."

For instance, LCM-based parameter learning (see Algorithm 1) can easily be performed when a root is chosen.\nThe root can be determined from a priori knowledge on data. For instance, we can consider that the latent structure of LTM represents a hierarchy of concepts (i.e. a taxonomy in ontology). Thus, the LV root corresponds to the highest abstract level, whereas an LV node only having OVs as children is interpreted as the lowest abstract level. Actually, variable clustering-based algorithms implicitly implement this a priori knowledge."

We also\ngive examples of instantiations for generic algorithms. Online resources are summarized in Appendix A. In order to simplify the comparison of time complexities, we only consider the number n of variables (input data), the number N of observations and the number s of steps (for search-based algorithms). The LTM learning algorithms are compared with the Chow-Liu algorithm for learning a tree without LVs. Details about the complexity calculation of LTM learning algorithms are provided in Supplemental material B.2.\nWhen the tree does not contain any LV, learning the model can be done efficiently in O(n2N) using the Prim’s algorithm (1957). The situation is more complicated when the tree contains LVs. The complexity of finding the regular LTM with the lowest score is O(23n 2\n). Search-based methods implement heuristics to reduce this large complexity. Their overall complexity can be decomposed into a product of three main terms: number of steps, structure learning complexity and parameter learning complexity. At the opposite, in variable clustering- and distance-based methods, the overall complexity can be decomposed into a sum. Nevertheless, the development of new operators for greedy search and the application of local EM have led to significant improvements (from O(sn5N) to O(sn2N)). Variable clustering-based methods are computationally more efficient for multiple reasons. They rely on pairwise dependence computation to identify LVs and their connections, and on LCM-based learning to determine LV cardinality. Regarding distance-based methods, NJ provides a reasonable complexity of O(n3N), whereas DBG presents a high complexity of O(n3N+n4). However, this last complexity corresponds to the worst case, when the tree to learn is a hidden Markov model. Besides, Choi et al. provide a modified DBG which reduces the complexity to O(n2N + n4).\nSome of the algorithms proposed in the literature differ from the generic algorithms presented. In Tables 2 and 3, we compare the algorithms from the literature on small, large and very large simulated and real datasets15. Moreover we provide results for standard algorithms: CL model-based and LCM-based approaches. For each dataset, we learned the model from training data and evaluated the BIC score on test data. We repeated the experiments 10 times. The programs were allowed to run in maximum 6 hours. Datasets are described in Supplemental material B.316. We report the BIC score with its standard deviation and the running time.\nOn small datasets (n ≤ 10 variables), search-based methods lead to the best BIC values, except for the Asia dataset for which a distance-based method, regCLRG, is the best one. This is not surprising since search-based methods evaluate a large number of models to find the optimal one. Nevertheless, on large datasets (10 ≤ n ≤ 100), search-based methods require long running times and thus cannot be used for some datasets such as the Coil-42 and NewsGroup ones. In this context, variable clustering-based and distance-based methods are much more efficient while yielding accurate results. Regarding the very large dataset context (n > 100), only variable clustering-based and distance-based methods can learn LTMs17. CFHLC18 is the only approach able to process the HapMap data containing 117 observations for 10k variables. For all datasets, we observe that using CL model and LCM predominantly leads to lower BIC scores than when using LTM, except for large and very large datasets."

Nevertheless, for large LTMs, EM leads to considerable running times and to local maxima. To address this problem, LCM-based EM allows to quickly learn parameters, while spectral methods help find the optimal solution when LTM parameters are not required. When structure is unknown, search-based approaches represent standard methods from Bayesian network learning. However they are only suitable for learning small LTMs. To tackle this issue, variable clustering-based methods represent efficient alternatives. These methods are based on the idea of grouping variables to identify LVs in a bottom-up manner. Recently, phylogenetic algorithms have been adapted to general LTM learning. Compared to the other methods, they guarantee to exactly recover the generative LTM structure under some conditions.\n15. For a fair comparison, we used the implementation of NJ provided by Choi et al. (2011). 16. Although algorithms NJ, RG, CLRG and regCLRG can process any kind of data with shared state space\n(binary data, ternary data, ...), the implementation provided by Choi et al.

For this purpose, LTM analysis represents a powerful tool where latent information and latent relationships are modeled by LVs and graph edges, respectively. Thanks to LTMs, latent structure discovery has been applied to several fields: marketing (Zhang, Wang, & Chen, 2008), medicine (Zhang, Nielsen, & Jensen, 2004; Zhang et al., 2008), genetics (Hwang et al., 2006; Mourad et al., 2011) and phylogenetics (Felsenstein, 2003; Friedman, Ninio, Pe’er, & Pupko, 2002). Let us take the example of phylogenetics which is the major application of LTMs in structure discovery.\nIn phylogenetics, the purpose is to infer the tree representing the evolutionary connections between observed species. Let us consider human and its closest living relatives: orangutan, gorilla, bonobo and chimpanzee. From their DNA sequences, it is possible to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree. DNA sequences are sequences of letters A, T , G and C. During the evolution of species, DNA sequences are modified by mutational processes. Each\nspecies can then be characterized by its DNA sequence. One of the most popular algorithms for phylogenetic tree reconstruction is NJ (described in Section 3.2.3, Neighbor Joining). It starts by considering the tree as a star linking all species (see illustration in Figure 9). Then the distances between all species are calculated based on the DNA sequences. Chimpanzee and bonobo present the shortest distance and are thus regrouped under a new latent node. Then distances are updated and the last previous step is reiterated until the construction of the final phylogenetic tree. The tree first links chimpanzee and bonobo, then human, gorilla and orangutan. The success of NJ comes from the fact that, compared to previous hierarchical clustering methods such as UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean), it does not assume all species evolve at the same rate. The length of an edge represents the time separating two species. Moreover, assuming that the distances are correct, NJ outputs the correct tree."

      "heading" : "4.2 Multidimensional Clustering",
      "text" : "Cluster analysis, also called clustering, aims at assigning a set of observations to several groups (called clusters) so that observations belonging to the same cluster are similar in some sense (Xu & Wunsch, 2008). LTMs are particular tools which can produce multiple clusterings: each LV represents a partition of data, which is most related to a specific subset of variables. This application is called “multidimensional clustering” and has been mainly explored by Chen et al. (2012).\nLet us illustrate LTM-based multidimensional clustering using dataset from a survey on Danish beer market consumption. For this purpose, we use the user-friendly software Lantern. The dataset consists of 11 variables and 463 consumers. Each variable represents a beer brand which is evaluated through the four possible answers to a survey questionnaire: never seen the brand before (s0); seen before, but never tasted (s1); tasted, but do not drink regularly (s2) and drink regularly (s3).\nThe learned model is presented in Figure 10. It has a BIC score of −4851.99. The model contains 3 LVs: H0, H1 and H2. These LVs have 2, 3 and 2 latent classes, respectively. Let us start withH1 which is the simplest interpretable LV. Let X1,X2, ...,Xn be the OVs sorted by decreasing values of pairwise MI between H1 and each OV Xi. Two different information curves are analyzed in Figure 11: (i) the curve of pairwise mutual information I(H1;Xi) between H1 and each OV Xi, and (ii) the curve of cumulative information I(H1;X1, ...,Xi) representing MI between H1 and the first i OVs X1, ...,Xi. The curve of pairwise mutual information shows that TuborgClas, followed by CarlSpec and Heineken, are the beers most related to H1. The curve of cumulative information presents complementary information. The cumulative information curve increases monotonically with i and reaches the maximum for n. The ratio I(H1;X1, ...,Xi)/I(H1;X1, ...,Xn) is the information coverage of the first i OVs. If this ratio is equal to 1, it means that H1 is conditionally independent of Xi+1, ...,Xn given the first i OVs. In practice only the first OVs whose information coverage is less than 95% are considered relevant. Using the cumulative information curve, we observe that H1 is only related to TuborgClas, CarlSpec and Heineken, which represent a group of beers different from the others. TuborgClas and CarlSpec are frequent beers, being a bit darker in color and more different in taste than the two main mass-market beers, GronTuborg and Carlsberg. Although not Danish, Heineken is one of the largest brand in the world that most Danes would have tasted sometimes during travels abroad. Results for other LVs are discussed but not shown (interpretation remains the same as for H1). H0 is more related to CeresTop, CeresRoyal, Pokal, Fuglsang, CarlsSpec and FaxeFad (i.e. minor local beers), whereas H2 is more connected to GronTuborg and Carlsberg (i.e., the two main mass-market beers).\nClass conditional probability distributions (CCPDs) of H1 are presented in Table 4. Using this table, it is easy to interpret latent classes. For instance, the first class (Class1) represents 36% of the consumers (prior = 0.36). For this class, all conditional probabilities of s2 are higher than 0.5. This means that these consumers tasted the beers, but do not drink them regularly. The second class (Class2) contains 27% of the consumers and represents people who saw the beers before or only tasted them. The last class (Class3) includes 37% of the consumers and represents people who just tasted the beers or drink them regularly. Results for other LVs are discussed but not shown. The CCPDs relative to H0 show a division into a group of consumers who just tasted the beers (Class1) and a more complicated group of consumers who never saw the brands, just saw them or just tasted them (Class2). Regarding H2, the CCPDs report consumers who just tasted the beers (Class1) and consumers who drink them regularly (Class2). Using the LTM, we can also analyze relations between the different partitions. The conditional probability distribution P (H2|H1) is given in Table 5. We observe that consumer behaviors are similar for the two groups of beers. For instance, consumers who just tasted or regularly drink the H1 group of beers (Class3 of H1) generally also drink regularly the H2 group of beers (Class2 of H2).\nIn this example, we were able to find consumer profiles specific to beer brands. Multidimensional clustering thanks to LTMs helps discover multiple facets of data (i.e. LVs) and partition data along each facet (i.e. latent class). Moreover, general relations between multiple facets are highlighted through connections between LVs."

      "heading" : "4.3 Probabilistic Inference",
      "text" : "Probabilistic inference is the process of answering probabilistic queries of the form p(x|y), for an event x given some knowledge y (Koller & Friedman, 2009), using the Bayes formula:\np(x|y) = p(y|x)p(x) p(y) . (29)\nProbabilistic inference is used in many circumstances, such as in credit card fraud detection (Ezawa & Norton, 1996) or disease diagnostic (McKendrick, Gettinbya, Gua, Reidb, & Revie, 2000).\nProbabilistic inference in a general BN is known to be an NP-hard task (Cooper, 1990). To tackle this issue, one can approximate the original BN using a maximum weight spanning tree learned relying on Chow and Liu’s algorithm (1968). The drawback is the risk of inaccuracy in inference results. In this context, LTM provides an efficient and simple solution, because: (i) thanks to its tree structure, the model allows linear computations with respect to the number of OVs, and at the same time, (ii) it can represent complex relations between OVs through multiple LVs. Because learning LTM before performing inference can be time-consuming Wang et al. (2008) propose the following strategy: first, offline model learning is performed, then answers to probabilistic queries are quickly computed online. However, recent spectral methods (Parikh et al., 2011) considerably reduced model learning phase, because they do not require to learn the model structure. This makes inference through large LTMs possible (around several hundred OVs) and thus renders them even more attractive.\nInferential complexity does not only depend on the number of OVs, but also on LV cardinalities: the higher the cardinality, the higher the complexity. Hence Wang et al. (2008) propose a tradeoff between inferential complexity and model approximation accuracy by fixing a maximal cardinality C for LVs.\nWang et al. (2008) empirically demonstrated the high performance of LTM-based inference on 8 well-known Bayesian networks from the literature. The principle consists in learning the LTM which will provide the best approximation of the original BN. For this purpose, data are sampled from the original BN and then an LTM is learned from the data. To illustrate inference, let us only consider two examples, the ALARM and the BARLEY networks which show the lowest and highest inferential complexities among the aforementioned networks, respectively. The ALARM network contains 37 nodes, and is characterized by an average indegree of 1.24 (max: 4) and an average cardinality of 2.84 (max: 4). The BARLEY network contains 48 nodes; its average indegree is 1.75 (max: 4) and its average cardinality is 8.77 (max: 67). Two parameters are central for the user: (i) N , the sample size which entails long model learning running times but leads to better model accuracies, and (ii) C, the maximal cardinality of LVs which entails long model learning and inference running times but leads to higher model accuracies.\nIn Figure 12, the LTM-based method is compared to other standard inference approaches: the LCM-based approach, the Chow-Liu (CL) model-based approach and loopy belief propagation (LBP) (Pearl, 1988). Exact inference through clique tree propagation (CTP) (Lauritzen & Spiegelhalter, 1988) on the original BN is considered as the reference. Figure 12a reports running times for LTM learning using the LTAB algorithm (Wang et al., 2008). Running times almost linearly increase with N and C. Regarding inference accuracy (Figure 12b), the LTM-based method outperforms other methods when N and C are high, e.g. N = 100k and C = 8 for the ALARM network. As regards inference running times (Figure 12c), the benefits of using the LTM-based method are high for the ALARM network, a high inferential complexity network. In these experiments, we note that CL is also very interesting, and the choice between the latter and the LTM will depend on the online inference time allowed. If time is very limited, CL would be preferred. In the other case, the LTM would be chosen."

      "heading" : "4.4 Other Applications",
      "text" : "Beside latent structure discovery, multidimensional clustering and probabilistic inference, there are other interesting applications of LTMs.\nA simple but efficient classifier is naive Bayes. This model assumes that OVs are independent conditional on the class variable. This assumption is often violated by data and hence numerous adaptations have been developed to improve the classifier performance. Naive Bayes has been generalized by introducing latent nodes as internal discrete nodes (Zhang et al., 2004) or continuous nodes (Langseth & Nielsen, 2009), mediating the relation between leaves and the class variable. The model is identical to an LTM except that the root is observed. Recently, Wang et al. (2011) proposed a classifier based on LTM. For each class, a specific LTM is learned and a latent tree classifier is built by aggregating all LTMs. This classifier outperforms naive Bayes and many other successful classifiers such as tree augmented naive Bayes (Friedman, Geiger, & Goldszmidt, 1997) and averaged one-dependence estimator (Webb, Boughton, & Wang, 2005).\nMore specifically to some research fields, LTM has been used for human interaction recognition, haplotype inference in genetics and diagnosis in traditional medicine. Human interaction recognition is a challenging task, because of multiple body parts and concomitant inclusions (Aggarwal & Cai, 1999). For this purpose, the use of LTM allows to segment the interaction in a multi-level fashion (Park & Aggarwal, 2003): body part positions are estimated through low-level LVs, while overall body position is estimated by a highlevel LV. In genetics, there is a need for inferring haplotypic data (i.e. latent genetic DNA sequences) from genotypic data (observed data). Kimmel and Shamir (2005) perform efficient haplotypic inference using a two-layer LFM. Finally, Zhang et al. (2008) applied LTMs to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). They discovered that the latent structure obtained matches TCM theories. The model provides an objective justification for the ancient theories."

When structure is known, standard EM and LCM-based EM or spectral methods can be used.\nWhen structure is unknown, three classes of methods have been proposed: search-based, variable clustering-based and distance-based methods. The first one is slow but leads to accurate models. The second one drastically decreases running times. Finally, the last class guarantees to exactly recover the generative LTM structure under the assumption that all LVs have the number of states and this number is known.\nIn spite of the aforementioned advances, the use of LTM presents some drawbacks. For example, when the data dimension is large or very large, model learning still remains prohibitive.

    }, {
      "heading" : "6. Future Directions",
      "text" : "Progress on LTM has been made, but there is still much to be done. There are multiple promising directions. For instance, a recent work developed LTM for continuous data analysis (Poon, Zhang, Chen, & Wang, 2010; Choi et al., 2011). Other authors investigated the relationships between LTM and ontology (Hwang et al., 2006), and LTM-based dependence visualization (Mourad, Sinoquet, Dina, & Leray, 2011). Although no research has been carried out on the application to causal discovery and latent trait analysis, we argue that LTM might represent interesting avenues of research.\nLTM for Continuous Data: Recently, LTM modeling has been applied to continuous data analysis (Poon et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2011; Song et al., 2011; Kirshner, 2012). For instance, Poon et al. (2010) proposed a new model, called pouch latent tree model (PLTM). PLTM is identical to LTM, except that each observed node in an LTM is replaced with a “pouch” node representing an aggregation of multiple continuous OVs. PLTM represents a generalization of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) when more than one LV is allowed. The proposal of Poon et al. originates from the fact that model-based clustering of continuous data is sensitive to the selected variables. Similarly to categorical clustering (Section 4.2), in high-dimensional continuous data, there are multiple ways to partition the data, and the multiple LVs of PLTM are able to take this into account. Poon et al.\ndeveloped a search-based algorithm for PLTM learning. The latter algorithm is closely related to the EAST algorithm (Zhang & Kocka, 2004b) dedicated to LTM learning and is thus quite slow. Hence, the development of new methods dedicated to efficient PLTM learning certainly represents interesting perspectives of research. Besides, a next step would also be the development of LTM dedicated to mixed data analysis, i.e. combining categorical and continuous data.\nLTM Structure and Ontology: It is possible to relate LTM to ontology, in particular taxonomy (tree-structured ontology). For instance, when applying LTM to a microarray dataset of yeast cell-cycle, Hwang et al. (2006) showed that some LVs are significantly related to specific gene ontology terms, such as organelle organization or cellular physiological process. Thus taxonomy could help interpret LVs. Moreover the taxonomy structure could be used as a priori structure.\nDependence Visualization: LTM provide a compact and interpretable view of dependences between variables, thanks to its graphical nature and its latent variables (Mourad et al., 2011). Compared to heat map (Barrett, Fry, Maller, & Daly, 2005) which can only display pairwise dependences between variables, LTM helps visualize both pairwise and higher-order dependences. Pairwise dependence can be represented by the chain length linking two leaf variables, whereas higher-order dependences are simply represented by a set of leaf variables connected to a common LV.\nCausal Discovery: We argue that LTM represents simple but efficient model for causal discovery, for the following reasons:\n− If the LTM root is known, then the model can be interpreted as a hierarchy. Into this hierarchy, LVs are distributed into multiple layers. This multiple LV layers represent different degrees of information compactness (i.e. data dimension reduction), since each LV captures the patterns of its child variables. The connexion of variables through parent-child relationships allows easy and natural moves from general (top layers) to specific (bottom layers) causes, and vice-versa. Thus, causal discovery can be guided by the hierarchical model feature.\n− After constructing the model on variables X = {X1, ...,Xn}, if one wants to test the direct dependence between Xi and another variable Y not present in the network, it can be easily computed through a test for independence between Xi and Y conditional on the parent of Xi. A practical advantage of this conditional test meant to assess direct dependence is that the number of degrees of freedom required is low (because only the parent of Xi is used to condition the test), which ensures a good power.\nLatent Trait Analysis: Similarly to the generalization of LCM by LTM, it would be worth developing an extension of the latent trait model by a tree-structured model where internal nodes are continuous LVs. For instance, this would alleviate the drawbacks of local independence in the latent trait model and would provide multiple facets thanks to LVs when dealing with high-dimensional data."

A final global EM parameter learning is done in O(nN). Thus, the overall complexity is : O(n2N) + (O(N) ∗O(n)) +O(nN) = O(n2N).\n− Neighbor joining (NJ). To learn the structure, there are O(n) steps. At each step, pairwise distances are computed in O(n2N). Structure learning thus requires O(n3N) computations. After learning the structure, parameters can be learned with EM or LCMB-EM in O(nN). Thus, the overall complexity is : O(n3N)+O(nN) = O(n3N).\n− Distance-based general LTM learning (DBG), Algorithm 4. First the distances are computed in O(n3N). If the minimum spanning tree is learned before, the complexity is reduced to O(n2N). Then, to learn the structure, testing child-parent and sibling relations necessitates O(n4) operations in the worst case, i.e. when the tree is a hidden Markov model. Parameters can be learned with EM or LCMB-EM in O(nN). Thus, the overall complexity is : O(n3N) +O(n4) +O(nN) = O(n3N + n4) or O(n2N) +O(n4) +O(nN) = O(n2N + n4)."

The correct topology is {{Xi,Xj}, {Xi′ ,Xj′}} if and only if: |E[XiX j ]|∗ |E[Xi′X j ]|∗ > |E[Xi′X j ]|∗ |E[XiX j ]|∗, (25) where |M |∗ := Π`=1σ`(M) is the product of the k largest singular values of matrix M and E[M ] is the expectation of M (estimated using the covariance matrix).

For this purpose, random restarts of EM are generally used to learn parameters with a low probability of getting trapped in local maxima. The drawback is that this method cannot be applied to LTM learning, because EM becomes time-consuming when there are several LVs. A better solution consists in using a greedy search approach, starting with a preset value of LV cardinality (generally equal to 2) and incrementing it to meet the optimal criterion. However, this solution still remains computationally demanding (Zhang, 2004). To tackle the issue of computational burden, several strategies have been proposed. For instance, one can simply set a small value for the LV cardinalities. Following this idea, Hwang and collaborators (2006) constrain LVs to binary variables.",

    "abstractText" : "In data analysis, latent variables play a central role because they help provide powerful insights into a wide variety of phenomena, ranging from biological to human sciences. The latent tree model, a particular type of probabilistic graphical models, deserves attention. Its simple structure a tree allows simple and efficient inference, while its latent variables capture complex relationships. In the past decade, the latent tree model has been subject to significant theoretical and methodological developments. In this review, we propose a comprehensive study of this model. First we summarize key ideas underlying the model. Second we explain how it can be efficiently learned from data. Third we illustrate its use within three types of applications: latent structure discovery, multidimensional clustering, and probabilistic inference. Finally, we conclude and give promising directions for future researches in this field.",
