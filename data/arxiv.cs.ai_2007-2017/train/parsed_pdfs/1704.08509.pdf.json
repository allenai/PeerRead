      "text" : "Recent developments of technologies in computer vision, deep learning, and more broadly artificial intelligence, have led to the race of building advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). From recognizing particular objects of interest toward understanding the corresponding driving environments, road scene segmentation is among the key components for a successful ADAS. With a sufficient amount of annotated training image data, existing computer vision algorithms already exhibit promising performances on the above task. However, when one applies pre-trained seg-\n∗indicates equal contribution\nmenters to a scene or city which is previously not seen, the resulting performance would be degraded due to dataset (domain) biases.\nWe conduct a pilot experiment to illustrate how severe a state-of-the-art semantic segmenter would be affected by the above dataset bias problem. We consider the segmenter of [2] which is trained on Cityscapes [5], and apply for segmenting about 400 annotated road scene images of different cities across countries: Rome, Rio, Taipei, and Tokyo. A drop in mean of intersection over union (mIoU) of 25- 30% was observed (see later experiments for more details). Thus, how to suppress the dataset bias would be critical when there is a need to deploy road scene segmenters to different cities.\nIt is not surprising that, collecting a large number of an-\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n08 50\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n7 A\nnotated training image data for each city of interest would be time-consuming and expensive. For instance, pixel labeling of one Cityscapes image takes 90 minutes on average [5]. To alleviate this problem, a number of methods have been proposed to reduce human efforts in pixellevel semantic labeling. For example, researchers choose to utilize 3D information [37], rendered images [30, 31], or weakly supervised labels [32, 34, 3] for labeling. However, these existing techniques still require human annotation during data collection, and thus might not be easily scaled up to larger image datasets.\nInspired by the recent advances in domain adaptation [23, 35, 12], we propose an unsupervised learning framework for performing cross-city semantic segmentation. Our proposed model is able to adapt a pre-trained segmentation model to a new city of interest, while only the collection of unlabeled road scene images of that city is required. To avoid any human interaction or annotation during data collection, we utilize Google Street View with its time-machine1 feature to harvest road scene images taken at the same (or nearby) locations but across different times. As detailed later in Sec. 4, this allows us to extract static-object priors from the city of interest. By integrating such priors with the proposed global and class-specific domain adversarial learning framework, refining/adapting the pre-trained segmenter can be easily realized.\nThe main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n• We propose an unsupervised learning approach, which performs global and class-wise adaptation for deploying pre-trained road scene segmenters across cities.\n• We utilize Google Street View images with timemachine features to extract static-object priors from the collected image data, without the need of user annotation or interaction.\n• Along with the static-object priors, we advance adversarial learning for assigning pseudo labels to cross-city images, so that joint global and class-wise adaptation of segmenters can be achieved."

[37] annotate 3D semantic labels in a scene, followed by transferring the 3D labels into the associated 2D video frames. [30, 31] collect semantic labels from Computer Graphic (CG) images at a large scale; however, building CG worlds for practical uses might still be computationally expensive.\nOn the other hand, [3] choose to relax the supervision during the data collection process, and simply require a number of point-labels per image. Moreover, [24, 26, 27] only require image-level labels during data collection and training. In addition to image-level labels, Pathak et al. [25] incorporate constraints on object sizes, [14, 34, 32] utilize weak object location knowledge, and [14] exploit object boundaries for constrained segmentation without using a large annotated dataset. Alternatively, [15, 38] apply free-form squiggles to provide partial pixel labels for data collection.

For further extension, Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation (VRADA) [28] utilizes Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) and RNN for timeseries adaptation.

Using Google Street View, road scene images at a global scale can be accessed across a large number of cities in the world. To address the issue of geo-location discrimination of a road scene segmenter, we download the road scene images of four cities at diverse locations, Rome, Rio, Tokyo, and Taipei, which are expected to have significant appearance differences. To ensure that we cover sufficient variations in visual appearances from each city, we randomly sample the locations in each city for image collection.\nTemporal information. With the time-machine features of Google Street View, image pairs of the same location yet\nacross different times can be further obtained. As detailed later in the Sec. 4.2, this property particularly allows us to observe prior information from static objects, so that improved adaptation without any annotation can be achieved. In our work, we have collected 1600 image pairs (3200 images in total) at 1600 different locations per city with high image quality (647× 1280 pixels).\nFor evaluation purposes, we select 100 image pairs from each city as the testing set, with pixel-level ground truth labels annotated by 15 image processing experts. We define 13 major classes for annotation: road, sidewalk, building, traffic light, traffic sign, vegetation, sky, person, rider, car, bus, motorcycle, and bicycle, as defined in Cityscapes [5]. Fig. 2 shows example images of our dataset. The dataset will be publicly available later for academic uses. To see more details and examples of our dataset, please refer to Appendix B or visit our website: https://yihsinchen.github.io/segmentation adaptation/.\nWe now summarize the uniqueness of our dataset below:\n• Unlike existing datasets which typically collect images in nearby locations (e.g., road scenes of the same city), our dataset includes over 400 road scene images from four different cities around the world, with highquality pixel-level annotations (for evaluation only).\n• Our dataset include image pairs at the same location but across different times, which provide additional temporal information for further processing and learning purposes."

      "heading" : "4. Our Method",
      "text" : "In this section, we present the details of our proposed unsupervised domain adaptation framework, which is able to adapt pre-trained segmenters across different cities without using any user annotated data. In other words, while both images IS and labels YS are available from the source domain S, only images IT for the target domain T can be observed.\nDomain shift. When adapting image segmenters across cities, two different types of domain shifts (or dataset biases) can be expected: global and class-wise domain shift. The former comes from the overall differences in appearances between the cities, while the latter is due to distinct compositions of road scene components in each city.\nTo minimize the global domain shift, we follow [11] and apply the technique of adversarial learning, which introduces a domain discriminator with a loss LG. This is to distinguish the difference between source and target-domain images, with the goal to produce a common feature space for images across domains. To perform class-wise alignment, we extend the above idea and utilize multiple classwise domain discriminators (one for each class) with the corresponding adversarial loss Lclass. Unlike the discriminator for global alignment, these class-wise discriminators are trained to suppress the difference between cross-domain images but of the same class. Since we do not have any annotation for the city of interest (i.e., target-domain images), later we will explain how our method performs unsuper-\nvised learning to jointly solve the above adaptation tasks. With the above loss terms defined, the overall loss of our approach can be written as:\nLtotal = Ltask + λGLG + λclassLclass , (1)\nwhere λG and λclass are weights for the global and class-wise domain adversarial loss, respectively. Note that Ltask denotes the prediction loss of source-domain images, which can be viewed as a regularization term when adapting the learned model across domains.\nOur proposed framework. Fig. 3 illustrates our framework. Let C be the set of classes, and an input image denoted as x. Our proposed architecture can be decoupled into four major components: feature extractor MF (x, θF ) that transforms the input image to a highlevel, semantic feature space (the gray part), label predictor MY (MF (x, θF ), θY ) that maps feature space to task label space (the orange part), and domain discriminator for global MG(MF (x, θF ), θG) (the green part) and class-wise M cclass(MF (x, θF ), θ c class), c ∈ C alignments (the yellow part). The feature extractor and task label predictor are initialized from a pre-trained segmenter, while the domain discriminators are randomly initialized. While we utilize the front-end dilated-FCN [39] as the pre-trained segmenter in our work, it is worth noting that our framework can be generally applied to other semantic segmenters.\nIn Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 4.2, we will detail our unsupervised learning for global alignment and class-wise alignment, respectively. In particular, how we extract and integrate static-\nobject priors for the target domain images without any human annotation will be introduced in Sec. 4.3."

      "heading" : "4.1. Global Domain Alignment",
      "text" : "Previously, domain adversarial learning frameworks have been applied for solving cross-domain image classification tasks [7]. However, for cross-domain image segmentation, each image consists of multiple pixels, which can be viewed as multiple instances per observation. Thus, how to extend the idea of domain adversarial learning for adapting segmenters across image domains would be our focus.\nInspire by [11], we take each grid in the fc7 feature map of the FCN-based segmenter as an instance. Let the feature maps of source and target domain images as MF (IS , θF ) and MF (IT , θF ), each map consists of N grids. Let pn(x) = σ(MG(MF (x, θF )n, θG)) be the probability that the grid n of image x belongs to the source domain, where σ is the sigmoid function. We note that, for cross-domain classification, Ganin et al. [7] use the same loss function plus a gradient reversal layer to update the feature extractor and domain discriminator simultaneously. If directly applying their loss function for cross-domain segmentation, we would observe:\nmax θF min θG LG =− ∑ IS∈S ∑ n∈N log(pn(IS))\n− ∑ IT ∈T ∑ n∈N log(1− pn(IT )) . (2)\nUnfortunately, this loss function will result in gradient vanishing as the discriminator converges to its local minimum. To alleviate the above issue, we follow [9] and decompose the above problem into two subtasks. More specifically, we have a domain discriminator θG trained with LDG for classifying these two distributions into two groups, and a feature extractor θF updated by its inverse loss LDinvG which minimizes the associated distribution differences. In summary, our objective is to minimize LG = LDG + LDinvG by iteratively update θG and θF :\nmin θG LDG , min θF LDinvG , (3)\nwhere LDG and LDinvG are defined as: LDG =− ∑ IS∈S ∑ n∈N log(pn(IS))\n− ∑ IT ∈T ∑ n∈N log(1− pn(IT )) , (4)\nLDinvG =− ∑ IS∈S ∑ n∈N log(1− pn(IS))\n− ∑ IT ∈T ∑ n∈N log(pn(IT )) .

      "text" : "In addition to suppressing the global misalignment between image domains, we propose to advance the same adversarial learning architecture to perform class-wise domain adaptation.\nWhile the idea of regularizing class-wise information during segmenter adaptation has been seen in [11], its classwise alignment is performed based on the composition of the class components in cross-city road scene images. To be more precise, it assumes that the composition/proportion of object classes across cities would be similar. Thus, such a regularization essentially performs global instead of classspecific adaptation.\nRecall that, when adapting our segmenters across cities, we only observe road scene images of the target city of interest without any label annotation. Under such unsupervised settings, we extend the idea in [20] and assign pseudo labels to pixels/grids in the images of the target domain. That is, after the global adaptation in Fig. 3, the predicted probability distribution maps φ(IT ) = softmax(MY (MF (IT , θF ), θY )) of target domain images can be produced. Thus, φ(IT ) can be viewed as the “soft” pseudo label map for the target domain images. As a result, class-wise association across data domains can be initially estimated by relating the ground truth label in the source domain and the soft pseudo label in the target domain.\nFrom pixel to grid-level pseudo label assignment. In Sec. 4.1, to train the domain discriminator, we define each grid n in the feature space as one instance, which corresponds to multiple pixels in the image space. If the (pseudo) labels of these grids can be produced, adapting class-wise information using the same adversarial learning framework can be achieved.\nTo propagate and to determine the pseudo labels from pixels to each grid for the above adaptation purposes, we simply calculate the proportion of each class in each grid as the soft (pseudo) label. That is, let i be the pixel index in image space, n be the grid index in feature space, andR(n) be the set of pixels that correspond to grid n. If yi(IS) denote the ground truth label of pixel i for source domain images, we then calculate source-domain grid-wise soft-label Φcn(IS) as the probability of grid n belonging to class c:\nΦcn(IS) = ∑\ni∈R(n)\nyi(IS) == c\n| R(n) | . (6)\nOn the other hand, due to the lack of annotated targetdomain data, it is not as straightforward to assign grid-level soft pseudo labels to images in that domain. To solve this problem, we utilize φ(IT ) derived above. Let φci (IT ) be the pixel-wise soft pseudo label of pixel i corresponding to\nclass c for target-domain images, we have target grid-wise soft pseudo label Φcn(IT ) of grid n:\nΦcn(IT ) = ∑\ni∈R(n)\nφci (IT )\n| R(n) | . (7)\nIntuitively, grid-wise soft (pseudo) labels Φcn(IS) and Φcn(IT ) are estimations of the probabilities that each grid n in source and target domain images belongs to object class c. To balance the appearance frequency of different classes, we normalize the estimated outputs in (6) and (7) as follows:\nΦ̃cn(IS) = Φcn(IS)∑\nn∈N Φcn(IS)\nΦ̃cn(IT ) = Φcn(IT )∑\nn∈N Φcn(IT )\n. (8)\nClass-wise adversarial learning. With the soft labels assigned to the source-domain images and the soft pseudo labels predicted for the target-domain ones, we now explain our adversarial learning for class-wise domain adaptation.\nAs depicted in Fig. 3, we deploy multiple class-wise domain discriminators θcclass, c ∈ C in our proposed architecture, and each discriminator is specially trained for differentiating objects of the corresponding class c across domains. Similar to pn(x), given that each object class c has a corresponded domain discriminatorM cclass, we define pcn(x) = σ(M c class(MF (x, θF )n, θ c class)) as the probability predicted by M cclass that the grid n of image x is from the\nsource domain. Combining the definition in (8), we define a pair of class-wise adversarial loss LDclass and LDinvclass to guide the optimization for class-wise alignment:\nLDclass =− ∑ IS∈S ∑ c∈C ∑ n∈N Φ̃cn(IS)log(p c n(IS))\n− ∑ IT ∈T ∑ c∈C ∑ n∈N Φ̃cn(IT )log(1− pcn(IT )) , (9)\nLDinvclass =− ∑ IS∈S ∑ c∈C ∑ n∈N Φ̃cn(IS)log(1− pcn(IS))\n− ∑ IT ∈S ∑ c∈C ∑ n∈N Φ̃cn(IT )log(p c n(IT )) . (10)\nFinally, similar to (3), the class-wise alignment process is to iteratively solve the following optimization problem:\nmin⋃ c∈C θcclass LDclass , min θF LDinvclass , (11)\nwhich minimizes the overall loss Lclass = LDclass+LDinvclass ."

Under the unsupervised domain adaptation setting, since no annotation of target-domain data can be obtained, fine-tuning the segmenter by such information is not possible.\nHowever, with the use of time-machine features from Google Street View images, we are able to leverage the temporal information for extracting the static-object priors from images in the target domain. As illustrated in Fig. 4, given an image pair of the same location but across different times, we first apply DeepMatching [36] to relate pixels within each image pair. For the regions with matched pixels across images, it implies such regions are related to static objects (e.g., building, road, etc.). Then, we additionally perform superpixel segmentation on the image pair using Entropy Rate Superpixel [17], which would group the nearby pixels into regions while the boundaries of the objects can be properly preserved. With the above derivation, we view the matched superpixels containing more than k matched pixels (we fix k = 3 in this work) as the staticobject prior Pstatic(IT ). Please refer to Appendix A for typical examples of mining static-object prior.\nLet Cstatic be the set of static-object classes. For the pixels that belong to Pstatic(IT ), we then refine their soft pseudo labels by suppressing its probabilities of being non-\nstatic objects:\n∀ i ∈ Pstatic(IT )\nφ̃ci (IT ) =  φ c i (IT ) / ∑ ĉ∈Cstatic φĉi (IT ) if c ∈ Cstatic\n0 else (12)"

This implies that different visual appearances across cities due to cultural differences would dramatically impact the accuracy of the segmenter. For example, in Taipei, as shown in Fig. 2, there are many signboards and shop signs attached to the buildings, and many scooters on the road, which are uncommon in Frankfurt.

Instead of collecting a large number of annotated images of each city of interest to train or refine the segmenter, we propose an unsupervised learning approach to adapt road scene segmenters across different cities. By utilizing Google Street View and its timemachine feature, we can collect unannotated images for each road scene at different times, so that the associated static-object priors can be extracted accordingly. By advancing a joint global and class-specific domain adversarial learning framework, adaptation of pre-trained segmenters to that city can be achieved without the need of any user annotation or interaction. We show that our method improves the performance of semantic segmentation in multiple cities across continents, while it performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches requiring annotated training data.",
