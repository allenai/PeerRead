      "text" : "Dimensionality reduction methods are widely used in the machine learning community for high dimensional data analysis. Manifold learning is a subclass of nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms. These algorithms attempt to discover the low dimensional manifold that the data points have been sampled from [1]. Many manifold learning algorithms produce an embedding of high dimensional data points in a low dimensional space. In this space, the Euclidean distance indicates the affinity between the original data points with respect to the manifold geometric structure. Typically, the embedding is produced only for the training data points with no extension for out-of-sample points. Moreover, the process of computing the embedding usually involves expensive computational operations such as Singular Values Decomposition\n(SVD). As a result, the application of manifold learning algorithms to massive datasets or data which is accumulated over time becomes impractical. Therefore, the out-of-sample extension (OOSE) problem is a major concern for manifold learning algorithms and over the years many methods has been proposed to alleviate this problem [2, 3, 4 ,5 ,6 ,7, 22, 23].\nIn this paper, we propose a general framework for OOSE which is based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) [8]. The method is independent of the manifold learning algorithm and provides a measure of abnormality for a given test instance with respect to the training instances. The outline of the method is as follows: Given a training data and a manifold learning algorithm, we first apply the algorithm to the training data and compute the corresponding embeddings. Then, we learn the hyperparameters for a GPR model using the training data and the embeddings. Finally, given an unseen test instance and the trained GPR model, we produce a predictive distribution and set the embedding value to the distribution mode. Furthermore, the variance of the predictive distribution quantifies the degree of abnormality in the test instance. We analyze the mathematical connection between the proposed method and the Nystrom extension [9] and show that the latter is a special case of the former.\nWe evaluate the proposed method on several wellknown manifold learning algorithms and various synthetic and real world datasets. We demonstrate its performance and show it manages to achieve competitive results when compared with other OOSE methods.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 overviews related work. In Section 3 we overview Gaussian Processes and GPR. Section 4 describes the proposed method and discusses its connection to the Nystrom extension [9]. In Section 5 we present experimental results."

      "text" : "OOSE for manifold learning is an active research field. Bengio et al. [2] proposes extensions for several well\nknown manifold learning algorithms: Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) [10], ISOMAP [11], Locally Linear Embeddings (LLE) [12] and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) [13]. The extensions are based on the Nystrom extension [9], which has been widely used for manifold learning algorithms. In [3] the authors propose to use the Nystrom extension of eigenfunctions of the kernel, however in order to maintain numerical stability, they used only the significant eigenvalues. As a result, the method might suffer from inconsistencies with the insample data. Bermanis et al. [4] suggested to alleviate the aforementioned problem by introducing a method for extending functions using a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of the multiscale decomposition of a Gaussian kernel. The method has been shown to overcome some limitations of Nystrom extension. Recently, Aizenbud et al. [5] suggested an extension for a new data point which is based on local Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\nAdditional attempts to establish a solution for the OOSE problem have been taken. Fernandez et al. [6] proposes an extension of Laplacian Pyramids model that incorporates a modified Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV), but avoids the large computational cost of the standard one. In [7], the authors proposed to extend the embedding to unseen samples by finding a rotation and scale transformations of the sample’s nearest neighbors. Then, the embedding is computed by applying these transformations to the unseen samples. Yang et al. [20] introduced a manifold learning technique that enables OOSE by using regularization.\nIn the context of Bayesian statistics, Lawrence et al. [21] showed how Gaussian Process Latent Variable models can be generalized through back-constraints (GPLVMBC) to preserve local geometries. However, GPLVMBC is not designed to extend a given mapping, but to produce a new one, which is different from the original one. Moreover, the GPLVMBC requires specific derivation per objective. This is in contrast to our proposed method which learns the original mapping and hence it is independent of the manifold learning algorithm.\nWilson et al. [14] introduces a new kernel that can be used with Gaussian Processes in order to discover patterns to enable extrapolation. The new kernel was found to outperform other existing kernels. Contrary to [14], in this paper we stick to the traditional squared exponential covariance function that sometimes referred as Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. In our experiments, we did not observe any significant improvement when other kernels are used."

Another approach is to apply cross validation. Fortunately, a close form expressions for LOOCV and its gradients exist [8] and the hyperparameters can be optimized with the Conjugate Gradient method. In this work, we use LOOCV for hyperparameter optimization. The main reason we chose this approach is that the marginal likelihood method is more prone to overfitting [8].

We repeat the experiment for increasing values of ρ starting from 0.05 to 0.8. Then for each O we plot a graph of the log RMSE as a function of ρ . We used the parameters that were specified in Section 5.3. A Gaussian noise was added to all of the synthetic datasets.\nThe results are presented in Fig. 3.

As we can see GPR produces the lowest RMSE values for most of the configurations followed by POOS as the second best method. The ALP seems to perform the worse, we conclude that it is due overfitting (in the ALP algorithm, a parameter is learnt from the training data and then used in test phase [6]). The reader might notice that some of the RMSE graphs are increasing in certain late intervals (mainly for real datasets), this might be explained by outliers or instability of the manifold learning algorithm: sometimes few points in the embedding are disconnected from the rest.

Every plot was generated for a different combination of dataset and manifold learning algorithm. See Section 5.6 for details.\nFirst, each dimension in the training set was mapped to [0, 1] using a constant scale factor. The scale factors were saved to apply the same scaling to the test instances. Next, the training data was reduced to 2 dimensions using diffusion maps with a Gaussian kernel with a neighborhood parameter ε = 0.7 (which was computed using the median of the average k=5 nearest neighbor distances). To decide whether a test instance is an anomaly, we use our proposed OOSE method to obtain a distribution over the 2-dimensional diffusion space of a lower dimensional vector corresponding to the test instance. The final decision is made by comparing the variance of this Gaussian distribution to a threshold. The threshold was learned by holding out 20% of the training set and optimizing the prediction accuracy on the hold out set. Using this approach, we obtained an accuracy of over 99%.\nIt is important to clarify that the ability to detect anomalies is a byproduct of the proposed OOSE method. We treat this capability as a side contribution of the paper, hence a survey of other anomaly detection methods and comparisons between them to the presented method is out of scope of this paper. This is on par with previous OOSE works such as [4]-[6]. Furthermore, though we show that our proposed OOSE method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results, we do not claim to achieve the state-of-the-art performance for anomaly detection tasks, but merely to show how to apply anomaly detection using our proposed OOSE method and validate these capabilities on both synthetic and real world datasets."

Many of the existing methods produce a low dimensional representation that attempts to describe the intrinsic geometric structure of the original data. Typically, this process is computationally expensive and the produced embedding is limited to the training data. In many real life scenarios, the ability to produce embedding of unseen samples is essential. In this paper we propose a Bayesian non-parametric approach for out-of-sample extension. The method is based on Gaussian Process Regression and independent of the manifold learning algorithm. Additionally, the method naturally provides a measure for the degree of abnormality for a newly arrived data point that did not participate in the training process. We derive the mathematical connection between the proposed method and the Nystrom extension and show that the latter is a special case of the former. We present extensive experimental results that demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and compare it to other existing out-of-sample extension methods.",
