      "text" : "Work on knowledge base population in its various forms (e.g., TREC KBA and TAC KBP), which we will describe using the umbrella acronym KBP, has primarily focused on large text collections. The knowledge base, in the ideal sense, is the repository for all information captured from this collection of text. Most KBP work has focused on large, heterogeneous text collections, like Wikipedia or the Internet, containing a variety of topics, each of which has its own set of relevant entities, types of facts, writing styles, etc. This variability and diversity is one of the things that makes entity linking, relation identification, and other tasks difficult in the large.\nIn contrast, we are concerned with smaller, more topically focused collections of restricted heterogeneity. This restricted paradigm changes the KBP problem significantly, e.g. a system is not able to rely on data redundancy, as most facts will only be stated once. This means that a system must address more vague or ambiguous ways of expressing a proposition than would be considered by a system designed for the large-text version of the problem. Yet this setting also offers new opportunities for\nKBP systems. In the small text collection paradigm, asking a user for a fairly complete annotation of the entities and proposition expressed in text is feasible, and system output can be vetted by an expert. We term this paradigm interactive KBP (IKBP).\nThe IKBP paradigm can apply to a variety of user types. Roughly speaking, they are any information analyst whose workflow involves carefully reading textual information and producing reports (e.g., a dedicated hobbyist creating a Wikipedia page, a journalist writing a newspaper article, or a financial analyst generating a quarterly summary report). These users can rely on a pocket KB – a small domain or user-specific knowledge base used as a tool for understanding new sources and producing reports. Pocket KBs accurately capture the scope of ambiguity represented in a particular topic of documents (as opposed to a global KB which will contain many irrelevant entities and facts that introduce noise into inferences). This concept of a database that matches a particular topic or domain opens the door to more speculative inferences and domainspecific learning that is more computationally efficient than would be possible for general KBs.\nWe describe the IKBP setting, summarize our work in building components of an IKBP pipeline, and demonstrate how the methods developed for KBP in the general sense can be extended to IKBP."

      "text" : "Ideal Users Professional analysts across a wide variety of disciplines are tasked with reading and synthesizing articles on a regular basis. Examples include financial analysts who need to keep track of a\nset of companies and entities relevant to a portfolio, scientific researchers who must read new articles related to their research, and public relations staff who track stories relating to their clients. Unlike the average individual, analysts have a good deal of domain knowledge on their topic, and are willing and able to invest time and effort to extending their knowledge and developing resources useful for their domain of interest. Much of their time is spent reading source articles, identifying entities of interest, understanding propositions about them, and recalling these facts while writing a report to synthesize their findings. These analysts are experts because of the inferences they can draw from evidence, but their efficiency is limited by the need to decompress (i.e., read, comprehend, recall) information contained in natural language.\nGiven their investment in the domain, analysts can derive long term benefit from providing minimal annotations while reading, storing them as structured data to be used later when a report is synthesized. Annotations as simple as a bag of entity mentions (coreference) and facts (relation extractions) offer a powerful index and summary of source documents. Additionally, this structured data supported by textual mentions offers the analyst a rich way to cite claims made in a report. This information captured by the analyst constitutes a lightweight ad-hoc KB.\nInteractive Workflow An IKBP system utilizes provided analyst annotations by interesting itself into an analyst’s document-centric1 workflow, bootstrapping a light-weight knowledge base as fast as possible. IKBP is not simply active learning for KBP: while having a human in the loop providing feedback to the system will indeed allow for updating and improving models, the users in this case are not primarily concerned with assisting in building a better system. Rather, they are consumers of the output of the system (facts discovered from content) that provide feedback to the system as a by-product of their professional desire to filter and correct output as a part of their writing process.\nTo meet the goal of being minimally obstructive\n1Here we describe the reports as text documents, but this need not be the case. IKBP construed broadly works on any source that may be used to ground out a statement made in a report, such as a spreadsheet, output of machine translation or speech recognition, or even richer media like images or video.\nto the user, the primary interface for IKBP is a document viewer. During reading, this interface enables a user to make annotations about entities and relations that are important. During report writing the interface should allow for linking statement back to supporting evidence. In some cases this may be possible to do fully automatically (e.g. linking a statement about an entity’s birth-date or employer), but in other cases the link must be explicitly added by the user for the purpose of structured citation (e.g. a statement that an entity is a ‘supporter’ of a group might be tied back to mentions of events between that entity and group). an entity’s birth-date or employer), while in more complex cases the user may opt to make an explicit citation (e.g. that an entity is a ‘supporter’ of a group might be tied back to mentions of events between that entity and group).\nIKBP should be seen as a natural complement to efforts such as topic detection and tracking (TDT) (Allan et al., 1998) or knowledge base acceleration (KBA), which provide tools that triage high-volume content streams to a smaller, personalized collection that the user can then analyze in depth.\nPocket KBs Pocket KBs are task-specific knowledge bases typically associated with a single user or group of users, such as a group of co-authors working on a research paper. First, there are some properties of KBs that will vary from topic to topic and are poorly modeled by the classic notion of a global KB. For example, while an entity’s popularity is an informative prior for the referent of an unknown mention (Ji and Grishman, 2011), popularity is defined as an empirical distribution, which will vary greatly across topics. Any global distribution over entities will be greatly biased in some domains, and serve as a poor prior. Pocket KBs can overcome this bias because they focus on a coherent topic or domain. While methods like hierarchical Bayesian models offer topical specialization and allow for global backoff, they do not share a pocket KB’s benefits of sparsity and compactness.\nAnother practical issue addressed by pocket KBs is that of ownership and permissions. Since they are allocated to a particular user or small group, curatorial choices do not affect other users (or if they do it, is clear that the owner of the pocket KB comes first). KBs that store global information that affects many users, such as in Wikipedia and Freebase, must use\ngate-keepers to moderate changes. Pocket KBs are an efficient solution for cases where there is a limited amount of overlap among users’ topics.\nPocket KBs also elegantly handle the issues of scope of ambiguity. Stoyanov et al. (Stoyanov et al., 2012) argue for the notion of a context in which a reader can be expected to perform entity linking, based on Grice’s principle of cooperative communication (Grice, 1975). Their claim is that most entity linking choices are easy in the correct context. They explored ways to derive the correct context from a global KB. While this is a general way to instantiate contexts to reason about and disambiguate entities, we argue that a pocket KB that is constructed to only ever include entities that are relevant to a particular topic is a more efficient way to construct a context.\nLastly pocket KBs sidestep engineering issues around supporting a large global KB. The tools needed to do AI research on large KBs like Freebase range from cumbersome to lacking. As a result, many state-of-the-art systems are designed as long pipelines that operate only in batch mode, often requiring days to run a single experiment (McNamee et al., 2013b). Working with pocket KBs requires much less engineering time and allow (non-systems) researchers to run experiments more quickly."

      "text" : "Since 2009, the Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population (TAC KBP) workshops have run competitions on entity linking (determine the referent of a named entity mention), slot filling (given an entity and a relation, find string-valued items that complete the relation), and Cold Start (combine the two previous tasks with no provided KB). Cold Start is most similar to IKBP as they both begin with an empty KB. They differ in that TAC focuses on large bodies of text and expects offline processing rather than under the supervision of a user. Nonetheless, an online optimize Cold Start system could be the heart of an IKBP system.\nAnother parallel line of work is the Text Retrieval Conference’s workshop on Knowledge Base Acceleration (TREC KBA). The Vital Filtering task evaluates how well a system can link documents in a very\nhigh volume document stream (a billion documents) to entities in a populated knowledge base. Once documents are linked to entities, the Streaming Slot Filling task takes these mentions and updates KB entries with the new information in the linked document. This task is relevant to IKBP as it solves the IR task of finding documents for an analyst to read.\nA third line of relevant work is Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) (Allan et al., 1998). Its goal was to find series of articles that constituted a coherent “news story” or topic. There is significant overlap between this and IKBP, including crossdocument coreference resolution and event detection and linking. Like TDT, there is a lot of work in first story detection in social media, such as Osborne et al. (Osborne et al., 2014) These systems, while tuned to social media, are also well suited to linking events as a part of IKBP.\nFinally, many systems have addressed tasks similar to IKBP, such as interactive IE (Culotta et al., 2006), post-hoc diagnostics of IE errors (Das Sarma et al., 2010), and robust crossdocument entity coreference (Minton et al., 2011). There has been a variety of work addressing the challenges of knowledge base construction and relation extraction at web-scale (Carlson et al., 2010; Kasneci et al., 2009; Nakashole et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009), and DeepDive (Niu et al., 2012) in particular emphasizes provenance information and user feedback. Most significantly, Budlong et al. (Budlong et al., 2013) built a system to do IKBP for intelligence analysts based on IE tools such as SERIF (Boschee et al., 2005); including an interface for analysts to view and correct annotations. It differed from our IKBP notion in its focus on entity-centric link analysis and in not stressing user citation and report writing or exploiting pocket KBs as valuable aspects of the task."

      "text" : "Visualization Quicklime is a tool designed to show the user documents that connect to the knowledge base that we’ve built so far. The tool presents content similar to what you might see in an online news site, and highlights all of the entities and relation triggers produced from within-document coreference resolution and ACE-style relation extraction\nsystems, with links to KB entries. These annotations help the reader skim the document to get an entity or relation-centric summary or find the source of a particular fact that the system has asserted.\nKelvin We have adapted Kelvin (McNamee et al., 2012; McNamee et al., 2013a; Mayfield et al., 2014), the top-ranked system for the TAC Cold Start KBP task in 2012 and 2013, for building pocket KBs. Kelvin uses the BBN tools SERIF and FACETS to perform document level analysis, including detection of named entities, within-document coreference analysis, and detection of entity relations. SERIF is an ACE system, which is more-or-less mappable onto the TAC-KBP schema. FACETS is a maximum entropy tagger that extracts attributes from personal noun phrases. Additional within-document coreference analysis is done using data from the Stanford NLP coref system and by manually developed rules.\nKripke Cross-document entity coreference clustering is done by Kripke, which looks for high levels of string matching (through a number of namematching metrics) and for contextual matching (using named entities that are common across source documents). Co-occurring named entity mentions and name matching are the only features used by Kripke. The algorithm performs agglomerative clustering on document-level entities. A cascade of fusion steps is performed, where conditions for name and context matching are slowly relaxed from strict to more generous constraints. After performing document-level analysis and cross-document coreference, Kelvin take steps to remove spurious assertions (using hand-written rules and blacklists to exclude unlikely facts), eliminates extraneous facts (e.g., a person can only have one city of birth and a reasonable number of children) and facts with insufficient support, and then performs logical inference to augment the resulting knowledge base. The logical inference uses procedurally implemented forward chaining rules.\nEntity Disambiguation We have are using two systems for performing entity disambiguation, one designed to work well when entities are known and another that performs a more careful analysis to bootstrap a set of lesser known entities. Slinky (Benton et al., 2014) is a streaming entity linker designed to support both high throughput and low la-\ntency linking. Most work on entity linking has treated KBP as a batch task; systems typically don’t optimize for speed, meaning batch runs can take hours. Slinky is optimized for IKBP and can quickly produce a top-K list of entity labels for each mention.\nWhen a set of entities is not known, Parma (Wolfe et al., 2013), which works with topically related pairs documents, constructs an alignment between the entities and events mentioned. Parma can bootstrap a small KB by linking new mentions to canonical mentions in an existing document (i.e., a light-weight KB) or decide to create a new entity if the mentions do not appear to be coreferent. Because Parma works at the level of pairs of documents, it can afford to use complex discourse features and joint inference, which are not feasible at large scale; this makes it ideal for the first stage of IKBP.\nRelation Identification A large part of IKBP is identifying basic propositions stated in documents. One version of this task is Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002): identifying and labeling the types of semantic arguments tied to semantic predicates. As a potential user might wish to analyze language content in low resource languages or domains, we are exploring models for lowresource SRL, such as that of Gormley et al. (2014). ACE (Doddington et al., 2004) is another view that comprises entities, values, time expressions, relations, and events. The set of relations and events that ACE annotated are closed-class but high-value, which makes them a nice compromise between complexity (both annotation and learning) and utility to the user. We have ongoing work towards building an interactive ACE system."

      "text" : "IKBP is a new variant of KBP tailored for long-term, focused information analysis. It captures knowledge from a user’s workflow while offering the ability to add rich structure to their summary reports. Much previous work can be extended to support IKBP systems. Many aspects of IKBP remain unexplored: the annotation UI, which can have a large effect on an IKBP system’s success; IKBP can benefit from more speculative inferences that rely on a human in\nthe loop, as users may write domain-specific inference rules; connecting IKBP together across many users, and merging pocket KBs is an open problem, and merging two clean pocket KBs could produce a more reliable result than building a global KB."
