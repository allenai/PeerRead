      "text" : "Coarse-grained alignment of documents groups text segments in different documents that convey the same theme – e.g. history, geography in texts about cities. Cross-language alignment deals with the added challenge of aligning segments from documents in different languages. This could be useful as a prelude to fine-grained alignment, or for building coarsely aligned multilingual corpora for machine translation or text categorization. We are interested in cross-lingual alignment for the synchronization of web (wiki) pages with multiple language versions, where pages in different languages are independently edited. A coarse alignment would (i) reveal quickly text portions that are not shared, and must thus be translated and added, and (ii) show potentially parallel portions, to be further processed to produce a more finegrained alignment. We present a cross-lingual\nalignment of segments – consisting of one or more paragraphs – based on knowledge-enhanced topic modeling, illustrated in Figure 1, which implements the following ideas:\n2-level LDA A two-layer modeling framework (i) models paragraphs as a mixture of three topics – background, document-specific and themespecific (e.g. in a document about the city of Montreal, articles, prepositions, etc. would be background, words associated with Montreal but not specific to a theme – Montreal, Canada, French, Quebec – would be document-specific, and others such as hockey, sports, skating would be themespecific); (ii) models a document as a mixture of K topics/themes.\nHMM theme sequences Following the assumption that themes are not presented randomly in a document, we use an HMM to model their sequence. State transitions are modeled through a Dirichlet distribution, tuned to bias the system towards self-transitions and thus avoid rapid switching between states (Beal et al., 2002; Teh et al., 2003; Fox et al., 2010).\nLanguage-independent concept annotations We inject knowledge in the model by linking single and multi-word terms to concepts in a concept network obtained from Wikipedia (Nastase and Strube, 2013). Terms are replaced with language-independent identifiers (e.g. “New York” becomes “c553795”). Enriching text with concept annotations allows to: (i) integrate naturally the identified multi-word expressions into the statistical process; (ii) deal with ambiguity (“New York” the city becomes “c553795”, while “New York” the state becomes “c27491610”); (iii) deal partly with coreferent mentions and synonymy (“New York City”, “The Big Apple”, “Nueva York” share the same identifier); (iv) bridge languages and build multilingual topic models, as concepts are shared across languages; ar X iv :1\n41 1.\n78 20\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n2 8\nN ov\n2 01\n4\n(v) use additional encyclopedic knowledge extracted from the concept network, e.g. relations between concepts within the same or consecutive paragraphs to strengthen the cohesion of the topic.\nThe method is applied on Wikipedia articles about cities in English and French (Chen et al., 2009). This allows for comparison with related work (in the monolingual setting), and to extend the evaluation to a cross-lingual setting. The monolingual segment alignment is evaluated against a Hidden Topic Markov Model (Gruber et al., 2007) – and the GMM model (Chen et al., 2009). The method described here scores higher than both. In the cross-lingual setting, the baselines are the alignments produced using translation tables, and using concept annotations, respectively. The method which combines topic modeling with concept annotations outperforms both baselines."

      "text" : "Text alignment For monolingual comparable corpora, text relatedness measures produce good alignment results (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003; Yahyaei et al., 2011). Methods for sentence alignment in a parallel bilingual corpus typically rely on linearity of the alignment, existence of 1:1 mapping between aligned sentences and the correlation of sentence length (Tiedemann, 2011). These assumptions do not hold for comparable (but not parallel) corpora. Bilingual comparable corpora have been mainly used to extract parallel fragments (Gupta et al., 2013) or paraphrases and word translations (Fung and McKeown, 1997). We focus on an alignment of fragments that have the same theme, but are not necessarily parallel.\nSequence modeling Modeling a document as a sequence of topics brings HMMs naturally to mind. Work in this area started with Mulbregt et al. (1998) and Blei and Moreno (2001). This approach suffers from two shortcomings: the number of states needs to be fixed (to be able to perform the Baum-Welch or Viterbi algorithms), and the HMM tends to switch fast between different states. In situations where a state should be persistent, as in topic segmentation, this is a problem. A breakthrough has come when state transitions in an HMM were modeled through a Dirichlet process (Beal et al., 2002). This allows one to control state transitions, and to let the model induce the number of states that best fit the data. Beal et al. (2002) used three hyperparameters to control the HMM: for self-transitions, for transitions to previously used states, and for adding a new transition. Teh et al. (2003) and Fox et al. (2010) extended this model and showed how to manipulate parameters to avoid rapid switching between states.\nLanguage models In topic segmentation one can consider the words to be the basic unit (Gruber et al., 2007), or sentences/paragraphs (e.g. (Blei and Moreno, 2001), (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008)). Sentences are themselves heterogeneous. Daumé III and Marcu (2006) used topic models for query-driven summarization. The assumption is that each sentence consists of a mixture of language models – one corresponding to the general model of the English language, one corresponding to the overall theme of the document, and one that matches the topic of the given query. Zhai et al. (2004), Titov and McDonald (2008) and Paul and Girju (2009) model topics (aspects) that run throughout a collection of documents, and\ntopics that are collection-specific. Considering a sentence/paragraph as a small document, and one document as a collection of these small documents, it could be construed that the previously mentioned work models a sentence/paragraph as a mixture of topics, some of which are common throughout the document, some of which are sentence-specific. Wang et al. (2011) also assume a sentence to be generated from a mixture of topics, in particular two: a “functional” (i.e. background) topic, and a content topic. Additionally, this approach models transitions between topics through an HMM, but like previous work, without concerns about the rapid state switching. This does not pose a problem because of the nature of the data: short ads and reviews with short sentences and not much topic repetition.\nWSD and topic modeling Boyd-Graber et al. (2007) combine topic modeling with word sense disambiguation relative to WordNet, following the observation that words in different topics may exhibit different senses, and that the sense of a word depends on the context in which it appears. Each noun that appears in WordNet will enhance the probabilities of all paths from the root to each possible sense, and “correct” paths will have higher probability because of aggregated evidence from the words in the text. A downside of this is that, as topic models do, it deals with single word terms only, whereas texts contain numerous multi-word terms referring to real world entities. For this reason we apply the concept and entity identification process before the topic modeling step.\nMultilingual topic modeling Jagarlamudi and Daumé III (2010) use a bilingual dictionary to obtain multilingual topics from an unaligned multilingual corpus. They assume topics to be formed of concepts, which can have different lexicalizations depending on the language. These concepts consist of entries from a bilingual dictionary. Boyd-Graber and Blei (2009) simultaneously discover matching words and multilingual topics from a collection composed of documents in two languages, based on the assumption that similar words appear in similar contexts. Zhang et al. (2010) use a bilingual dictionary as a source of constraints for bridging texts in two languages, using the assumption that related words in different languages have similar distributions. The topic models produced contain words in different languages that are allowed to have different probabil-\nities, reflecting the difference between the data in the two languages. Ni et al. (2009) mine multilingual topics from Wikipedia, using the articles on the same theme in different languages as a source of language models. Mimno et al. (2009) build polylingual topic models from sets of documents on the same topics, in particular Wikipedia articles in several languages. They assume that the different language versions of an article have similar topic distributions, and topics consist of languagespecific word distribution. Vulić et al. (2011) build bilingual topic models for information retrieval, using comparable corpora – in particular collections of Wikipedia articles on the same topics in the targeted languages."

This modeling is used as a filter – the (collection-specific) background and the document-specific words are not informative with respect to themes, and are skipped in the next processing step. While only side-effects with respect to the focus of this paper, the background and document-specific language models can be useful: the document-specific word probability distribution can be used to align, cluster or classify documents. We explore this briefly in Section 4.1.2. The w-topic mixture follows a Dirichlet distribution with hyperparameter γ (Dirichlet(γ)), while words within a w-topic follow Dirichlet(η). The topic si assigned to word at position i in paragraph t is sampled according to:\np(si = l|s,wt) ∝ gl(wti) nlwti + η\nnl∗ +Wη\nnlt−i + γ\nn∗t−i + 3γ\nwhere W is the size of the vocabulary, nlw is the number of times word w was assigned to wtopic l, ∗ is a wild-card, nlt is the number of words in paragraph t assigned to topic l, n∗t is the number of words in paragraph t, and wt−i is the sequence of words wt minus the wordwti at position i. g1..3 are normalized coefficients that capture the bias of each word for the three postulated topics, according to their document and collection frequencies1.\n1Background language g1(wti) = cPwti cP∗ (generally fre-\nquent words); document-specific g2(wti) = cdwti cd∗\n(common throughout the document, rare outside); topic-carrying g3(wti) = cDwti cD∗ × (1 − g1(wti)) (appear throughout the collection, but not frequent within single documents). P is the total number of paragraphs in the set of documents D, d is a document (the document being processed), cyx is the number of ys in which x appears.Because gl are constant, they will not be affected by marginalizing ξ: p(wt,g|s, η) =∫ p(wt,g|s, ξ)p(ξ|η)dξ = ∫ p(g|s)p(wt|s, ξ)p(ξ|η)dξ =∏\ni gsi(wti)\n∫ p(wt|s, ξ)p(ξ|η)dξ. These factors are nor-\nmalized such that for each word they sum to 1.\nDocuments are generated from a mixture of K themes (t-topics) following Dirichlet(λ). The ttopic of a paragraph is determined based on the subset of its theme-specific words, as determined by the previous step. The words in a topic follow Dirichlet(β). The right side of Figure 1 shows an example of the t-topics within a document. 2 Contiguous paragraphs that express the same t-topic form a segment, and through this can be aligned across documents and languages.

The persistence of states is encouraged by increasing the probability of self-transitions using a “sticky” parameter κ (Beal et al., 2002; Fox et al., 2010): πi|α, κ ∼ Dirichlet(α + κδi), where κ > 0 is added to the ith component of the parameter vector α3. ttopics are sampled as:\np(zt = j|z−t, α, κ, λ) ∝\nn (d) −t,j+λ∑\nl n (d) −t,l+Kλ\ntopic mixing proportion\nn−tzt−1j +αj+κ∗δ(zt−1,j) n−tzt−1∗+ ∑ x αx+κ transition from previous paragraph\nn−tjzt+1 +αj+κ∗δ(j,zt+1) n−tj∗ + ∑ x αx+κ transition to next paragraph\nwhere δ(i, j) = { 1 i == j 0 i 6= j (Kronecker’s delta).\n2 The t-topics induced by the model are nameless, we name them in the figure to illustrate more clearly the point.\n3Fox et al.

To identify concepts:\n• locate possible concept lexicalizations extracted from Wikipedia in texts;\n• for each lexicalization, find all candidate concepts it could refer to;\n• disambiguate among possible candidate concepts.\nFor disambiguation, the text is represented as a complete n-partite graph G = (V1, ..Vn, E). Each partition Vi corresponds to a (possibly multi-word) term ti in the text, and contains as vertices all concepts cij that may be expressed by ti, found in the first step. Each vertex from a partition is connected to all vertices from the other partitions (making the n-partite graph complete) through edges evi,vj ∈ E weighted by wvi,vj . The weights are learned from Wikipedia’s link structure, using as features several measures: shared outgoing links between the articles corresponding to the two concepts, shared categories and their specificity; preference of each concept for the other concept’s expression through the anchor in the current text.\nThe disambiguated concepts are the nodes in the maximum edge-weighted clique in this graph, and their expression in the text is replaced with the corresponding unique (and language independent) concept ID, resulting in the concept-annotated texts illustrated in Figure 2 (Fahrni et al., 2011).\nThis concept identification method scored high on both ACE 2005 (72.7% F-score) and in the Entity Linking TAC 2011 task.\nThe texts with concept identifiers are processed with the previously described topic model.

The English data was manually annotated with a “clean” set of headings, to allow mapping of sections that have the same topic but slightly different headings (e.g. Culture and arts/Culture).

Figure 4 shows examples of the general (background), document-specific (for the English and French Wikipedia articles about the city of Montreal) and two t-topic language models. The top section of the figure shows the background and documentspecific language models for the English and French data (shown side by side because the documents refer to the same cities). The background language model has captured what is usually included in a list of stopwords. This is an advantage, as stopwords may be collection-specific. The document-specific language model include words expected to be associated with the respective article titles. Sample t-topic language models are shown separately for each language.\nTerms in the text are replaced with language independent concept IDs. We combine the English and French data, and apply the topic model to this data. Samples of the resulting t-topics are included in Figure 4 – columns labeled “multilingual”. The terms in italics represent concepts – for readability replaced with the name of the corresponding article in the English Wikipedia. We have also performed experiments with building separate topics for English and French, while shar-\ning only the language-independent concepts (i.e. after building the topics for English, we use the English topic-annotated data as observed data, and adjust the prior computed from this data while iterating over the French data). The results were very similar, and for reasons of space are not included.\nThe background and document-specific language models are “side-effects” of the process of cross-document and cross-language alignment. However, they can be useful. The documentspecific topics could be used for (cross-language) document clustering. We took the top 20 words and concepts ranked based on tf-idf, as well as the top 20 terms in the document-specific topics for each of the 200 documents (100 for each language), and used the cosine similarity to align the documents in the two languages (i.e., to pair up the documents in English and French that were about the same city). The baseline – using tf-idf scored words – is already high (94%), due to shared city and country names. Both topic probabilities and tf-idf scored concepts perform perfectly (100%). For the task and data described in this\npaper, document level alignment performed using document-specific topics can be compounded with the theme-based paragraph alignment to produce paragraph alignment between pairs of documents. We plan to study the usefulness of the documentspecific topics in a more difficult environment.\nAlignment Figure 5 presents the results in terms of precision, recall and F-score for the settings describe above to reveal the contribution of the HMM and the concept annotations: The results on the English data, for both 10 and 20 t-topics, show a nice progression of the results as we add more information in the model. Adding HMM leads to better results, as it allows transition probabilities – and through this the context – to influence a ttopic assignment for each paragraph in the document. Adding concepts and their relations in the model leads to increase in recall, which is again expected since this will lead to more links between terms in different parts of the document. The results are better than previous work, with the exception of the situation when we use 20 t-topics on the French data."

The annotations not only help build cross-lingual topic models, but also deal with multi-word terms, polysemy and synonymy. The links between concepts are also beneficial by influencing the topic distribution and sequencing probabilities. The results are good despite the fact that we rely on an automatically built resource, and a concept identification step – itself an open research problem. We plan to investigate a joint approach to topic modeling and concept identification.\nWe have augmented the traditional HMM model with language models within a paragraph, and a Dirichlet distribution at the level of state (high-level topic) transitions. Modeling a text on two levels gives a layered view, which can be used to structure the commonly used bag-of-word representation of texts. Separating words that contribute to the topic segmentation from those that pertain to a background language or documentspecific model helps the system focus on the most relevant terms for segmentation. This could become an advantage when aligning corpora in different languages – one need only establish parallelism between topic-specific terms."
