      "text" : "Answer set programming (ASP) has always benefited from progress in the satisfiability solving (SAT) community. In fact, many (if not all) modern ASP solvers [16, 4, 11] are based on conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) [24], a technique first developed for SAT. Some people even go as far as to claim that ASP is just “a good modelling language for SAT”.\nThus, now and then it makes sense to check which developments in SAT can be transferred to ASP. In this paper, we port a recently introduced symmetry breaking preprocessor, BreakID3 [14] to ASP. A first version of BreakID was developed in 2013 [13]. This version won a gold medal on the 2013 SAT competition [7] in combination with the SAT solver Glucose 2.1 [5]. The latest version of BreakID was developed in 2015 [14] and won the gold medal in the no limit track of the 2016 SAT competition [19] in combination with the SAT solver COMiniSatPS [27].\nSymmetry breaking has been around for quite a long time. The most wellknown symmetry breaker for SAT is Shatter [2]. Shatter works by (i) transforming a SAT theory into a colored graph whose automorphisms correspond to symmetries of the theory, (ii) calling a graph automorphism detection tool such as Saucy [21] to obtain a set of generators of the symmetry group, and (iii) adding constraints that break each of the generators returned by the previous step. BreakID is based on the same ideas, but improves the last step of the symmetry breaking process. In particular, the set of symmetry breaking\n3 Pronounced “break it”.\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n08 44\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n3 0\nA ug\n2 constraints is parametrized by both the chosen set of generator symmetries, as well as a chosen order on the set of propositional variables. Good choices for these two parameters strongly influence the breaking power and the size of the resulting constraints [14] . As such, BreakID – searches for more structure in the symmetry breaking group, essentially de-\ntecting subgroups of the symmetry group that can be broken completely without additional overhead,\n– reduces the size of symmetry breaking constraints, – chooses an order on the variables that “matches” the generators to break, – actively searches for small (size 2) symmetry breaking clauses.\nThis resulted in significant improvements with respect to Shatter. The techniques from Shatter have been ported to ASP by the ASP symmetry breaker sbass [15]. The main contribution there was to develop an alternative for the first step in the ASP context, i.e., to transform an ASP program P into a colored graph such that graph isomorphisms correspond to symmetries of P.\nIn this paper, we show how to use BreakID as a symmetry breaker for ASP. Our implementation extends (and slightly modifies) the graph encoding used in sbass. The extensions serve to support a richer language: we provide support for so-called weight rules and minimize statements. The modification serves to ensure more effective breaking; we present several simple symmetric examples where BreakID detects the symmetry while sbass does not. For the third step (generating symmetry breaking constraints), we use all of the improvements that are already present in the SAT-version of BreakID [14].\nWe evaluate performance of BreakID and sbass on a number of benchmarks with symmetries and conclude that also in an ASP context, BreakID’s improvements have a significant effect.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we recall preliminaries regarding answer set programming and symmetries. Afterwards, in Section 3 we present our symmetry breaker for ASP. We evaluate this tool in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5."

      "text" : "A vocabulary is a set of symbols, also called atoms; vocabularies are denoted by σ, τ . A literal is an atom or its negation. An interpretation I of the vocabulary Σ is a subset of Σ. Propositional formulas and the satisfaction relation between formulas and interpretations are defined as usual. A logic program P over vocabulary Σ is a set of rules r of form\nh1 ∨ · · · ∨ hl ← a1 ∧ · · · ∧ an ∧ ¬b1 ∧ · · · ∧ ¬bm, (1)\nwhere hi’s, ai’s, and bi’s are atoms in Σ. The formula h1 ∨ · · · ∨ hl is called the head of r, denoted head(r), and the formula a1 ∧ · · · ∧ an ∧ ¬b1 ∧ · · · ∧ ¬bm the body of r, denoted body(r). A program is called normal (resp. positive) if l = 1\n3 (resp. m = 0) for all rules in P. If n = m = 0, we simply write h1 ∨ · · · ∨ hl. If l = 0, we call r a constraint.\nAn interpretation I is a model of a logic program P if, for all rules r in P, whenever body(r) is satisfied by I, so is head(r). The reduct of P with respect to I, denoted PI , is a positive program that consists of rules h1 ∨ · · · ∨ hl ← a1 ∧ · · · ∧ an for all rules of the form (1) in P such that bi 6∈ I for all i. An interpretation I is a stable model or an answer set of P if it is a ⊆-minimal model of PI [18]. Checking whether a logic program has a stable model is an ΣP2 -complete task in general and an NP-complete task for normal programs; hence, logic programs can be used to encode search problems. This observation gave birth to the field of answer set programming [23, 26, 22].\nThis paper sometimes uses syntactic sugar such as choice rules, constraints, cardinality atoms and weight atoms. A cardinality atom\ng ≤ #{l1, . . . , lf} ≤ k\n(with l1, . . . , lf being literals and f, g, k ∈ N) is satisfied by I if\ng ≤ #{i | I |= li} ≤ k."

In this case, the obvious semantics applies: the atom is satisfied for any lower/upper bound. For instance, the cardinality atom\ng ≤ #{l1, . . . , lf}\nis satisfied whenever g ≤ #{i | I |= li}.\nA choice rule is a rule with a cardinality atom in the head, i.e., a rule of the form g ≤ #{l1, . . . , lf} ≤ k ← a1 ∧ · · · ∧ an ∧ ¬b1 ∧ · · · ∧ ¬bm.

A symmetry of a program P is a permutation π of Σ that preserves stable models of P (i.e., π(I) is a stable model of P if and only if I is a stable model of P). A permutation of atoms for which π(P) = P is a syntactical symmetry of P.4 Typically, only syntactical symmetry is exploited, since this type of symmetry can be detected with relative ease. The practical techniques presented in this paper are no exception.\nSymmetry breaking aims at eliminating symmetry, either by statically posting a set of constraints that invalidate symmetric interpretations, or by altering the search space dynamically to avoid symmetric search paths. In this paper, we focus on static symmetry breaking. If Π is a symmetry group, then a set of constraints ψ is sound if for each interpretation I there exists at least one symmetry π ∈ Π such that π(I) satisfies ψ; ψ is complete if for each assignment α there exists at most one symmetry π ∈ Π such that π(α) satisfies ψ [34]."

      "heading" : "3.1 Colored Graph Encoding",
      "text" : "As for encoding a logic program as a colored graph, our approach is very close to the one introduced by sbass [15] (we discuss and justify the differences below). We use four colors {1, . . . , 4}; our graph consists of the following nodes: – For each atom p ∈ Σ, two nodes, referred to as p and ¬p below. Node p is\ncolored as 1, node ¬p is colored 2. – For each rule r ∈ P, two nodes, referred to as head(r) and body(r) below.\nNode head(r) is colored 3 and node body(r) is colored 4.\nOur graph is undirected and the edges are as follows:\n– Each node p is connected to ¬p. – For each rule r of the form (1) in P, each node hi is connected to head(r),\neach node ai is connected to body(r) and each node ¬bi is connected to body(r). The complete encoding of this type of rule is illustrated in Figure 1.\nIt can be seen that there is a one-to-one correspondence between automorphisms of this graph and syntactic symmetries of the logic program. Since atoms p are the only nodes colored in color 1, an automorphism induces a permutation of Σ. The edge between p and ¬p guarantee that an automorphism that maps to p to q also maps ¬p to ¬q. Furthermore, the edges between head(r), body(r) and the various literals occurring in a rule capture the full structure of the rule. As such, it can be verified that automorphisms of this graph must map rules to “syntactically symmetric” rules. Vice versa, each syntactic symmetry preserves the graph structure defined above.\nAdditionally, we extend this graph encoding to capture more language extensions such as, e.g., choice rules. We only support limited forms of these rules. Actually, our tool supports exactly the Lparse-Smodels intermediate format [31], extended with support for disjuctive rules. This means for instance that in cardinality rules, we assume there is no upper. The general language can easily be transformed to this format (in fact, that is what all modern ASP grounders do). For this, we introduce two new colors, extending the set of colors to {1, . . . , 6}. In programs with these extensions, integer numbers can occur, either as bounds of\n6 cardinality or weight constraint or as weights in a weight constraint or minimize statement (see below). We assume that for each integer n that occurs in such a program, there is a unique color cn 6∈ {1, . . . , 6} available and extend our set of colors to\n{1, . . . , 6} ∪ {cn | n occurs as weight or bound in P}.\nCardinality rules Rules of the form\nh← g ≤ #{a1, . . . , an,¬b1, . . . ,¬bm}\nare encoded as follows. The head of the rule is encoded as usual. The body node of the rule is colored in cg, the color associated with the bound g. The body node is connected to each of the ai and ¬bi and to the head node, as usual.\nChoice rules Rules of the form\n#{h1, . . . , hl} ← a1 ∧ · · · ∧ an ∧ ¬b1 ∧ · · · ∧ ¬bm\nare encoded exactly the same as rules of form (1), except that head(r) is colored 5. This allows to differentiate between standard rules and choice rules.\nWeight rules Rules of the form\nh← g ≤ sum{a1 = w1, . . . , an = wn,¬b1 = wn+1, . . . ,¬bm = wn+m} (2)\nare encoded as follows. The node body(r) is colored as for cardinality rules in cg. For each occurrence of an expression li = wj , we create one additional node, referred to as li = wj . This node is colored in cwj , the color associated to the integer wj and is connected to li. The body of this rule is connected to all the nodes ai = wi and ¬bi = wn+i. body(r) is connected to head(r) and head(r) to h, as usual. A visualisation of this encoding can be found in Figure 2.\nMinimize statements Minimize statements are expressions of the form\nminimize{a1 = w1, . . . , an = wn,¬b1 = wn+1, . . . ,¬bm = wn+m} (3)\nThey are directions to the solver that the user is only interested in models such that the term ∑\n{rules of the form (3) that occur in P } ∑ {i|I|=li} wi.\nis minimal (among all stable models). Such a statement is encoded analogously to the body of a weight rule, except that the body node is replaced by a minimize node with color 6.\nComparison with sbass Our graph encoding differs from the one used by sbass in two respects.\nFirst of all, we added support for minimize statements and weight rules. As a result, our tool supports the full Lparse-Smodels intermediate language as documented in [31] and additionally, the rule type “8” used by gringo [17] to represent disjunctive rules.\nSecond, we use undirected graphs whereas sbass uses directed graphs. To be precise, when using directed graphs, all head(r) nodes can be dropped by using edges from literals ai and ¬bi to body(r) and from body(r) to hi (the directionality thus distinguishes between head and body literals). We expect because of this that symmetry detection in BreakID takes slightly more time than symmetry detection in sbass (automorphism algorithms are sensitive to the number of nodes in the input graph). The reason why we did this is that we experimentally noticed that Saucy does not always behave well with directed graphs. On very small examples already, symmetries are missed when using the directional encoding. sbass, which uses Saucy with directed graphs, shows the same kind of behaviour, as we show in the following list of examples. The examples illustrate that BreakID is more stable than sbass with respect to symmetry detection on different encodings.\nExample 1.\nP1 = {\n0 ≤ #{p} ≤ 1. 0 ≤ #{q} ≤ 1.\n} .\nIt is clear that p and q are interchangeable in P1. By this we mean that the mapping σ : {p, q} → {p, q} : p 7→ q, q 7→ p is a symmetry of P1. BreakID detects this, while sbass detects (and breaks) no symmetry.\n8 Example 2. Consider the logic program\nP2 =  r ← p ∧ q.0 ≤ #{p} ≤ 1. 0 ≤ #{q} ≤ 1.  . It is clear that p and q are interchangeable in P2. In this case, both sbass and BreakID detect (and break) this interchangeability.\nExample 3. Consider the logic program\nP3 = ← p ∧ q.0 ≤ #{p} ≤ 1. 0 ≤ #{q} ≤ 1.  . It is clear that p and q are interchangeable in P3. BreakID detects this, while sbass detects (and breaks) no symmetry.\nExample 4. Consider the logic program\nP4 = p ∨ q ← p ∧ q.0 ≤ #{p} ≤ 1. 0 ≤ #{q} ≤ 1.  . It is clear that p and q are interchangeable in P4. BreakID detects this, while sbass detects (and breaks) no symmetry.\nExample 5. Consider the logic program P5 = { p. q. } .\nIt is clear that p and q are interchangeable in P4. BreakID detects this, while sbass detects no symmetry.\nIn the last example, the fact that this symmetry is not detected does not have any practical consequences. Indeed, since these are only interchangeable facts, exploiting the symmetry will not help the solver. However, in examples such as Example 1, the difference is more important. If there are interchangeable atoms in choice rules, symmetry breaking can cut out exponentially large parts of the search space."

      "text" : "A classic approach to static symmetry breaking is to construct lex-leader constraints.\nDefinition 1 (Lex-leader constraint [9]). Let φ be a formula over Σ, π a symmetry of φ, ≺Σ an order on Σ and ≺ the induced lexicographic order on the set of interpretations over Σ. A formula LLπ over Σ\n′ ⊇ Σ is a lex-leader constraint for π if for each Σ-interpretation I, there exists a Σ′-extension of I that satisfies LLπ iff I ≺ π(I).\n9 In other words, each interpretation whose symmetric image under π is smaller is invalidated by LLπ. It is easy to see that the conjunction of LLπ for all π in some Π ′ ⊆ Π is a sound (but not necessarily complete) symmetry breaking constraint for Π.\nAn efficient encoding of the lex-leader constraint LLπ as a conjunction of propositional clauses is given by Aloul et al. [1]. Such clauses translate directly to ASP constraints. In order to make such an encoding, an order on Σ needs to be chosen. The classic approach to symmetry breaking is to use the numbers as they occur in the numerical DIMACS CNF format or Lparse-Smodels intermediate format and to post for each symmetry in the set of generators a lex-leader constraint. This is the approach that is taken for instance in the SAT symmetry breaking tool Shatter and in sbass.\nThe drawback of this approach is discussed extensively in the work that introduced BreakID [14]. There, we show that this phase leaves room for several optimisations. – The set G of generators is often not good for symmetry breaking. Manipulat-\ning this set can result in symmetry breaking constraints with much stronger breaking power. – The order given by the numerical format is often suboptimal for symmetry breaking. The order should “match” the symmetries in G. – If both of the above optimisations are executed, we effectively obtain a situation in which exponentially large subgroups of the group generated by G are broken completely (without increasing the size of the symmetry breaking constraints). – Instead of breaking on the generators, one can generate a large number of very small (size 2) symmetry breaking clauses, resulting in stronger propagation power. – A slightly better encoding of the lex-leader constraints can be used [29]. All of these optimisations are used in the ASP version of BreakID as well."

The instances are generated by hand, with the number of crew members ranging from 5 to 25. Crew members have different attributes, but depending in the instance, multiple crew members exist with the same exact attribute set, making these crew members interchangeable.\ngraceful consists of 60 satisfiable and unsatisfiable graceful graph instances, taken from 2013’s ASP competition [3]. These instances require to label a graph’s vertices and edges such that all vertices have a different label, all edges have a different label, and each edge’s label is the difference of the labels of the vertices it connects.

To keep the comparison as fair as possible, sbass was given the same limit.\nThe optimization problems had 8GB RAM and 50000s timeout as resource limits, and the results exclude identical grounding time and negligable symmetry breaking time.

      "text" : "Table 1 summarizes the results of the decision problems. Analyzing the results on pigeons, clasp gets lost in symmetric parts of the search tree, solving only 8 instances (up to 12 pigeons). sbass can only solve three more instances (up\n5 bitbucket.org/krr/breakid_asp\n11\nto 15 pigeons), as the derived symmetry generators do not suffice to construct strong symmetry breaking constraints. These results are consistent with the results of Drescher et al. [15]. BreakID detects more structure, solving all but two instances (the largest being solved contains 50 pigeons). As far as symmetry preprocessing time goes, both sbass and BreakID spend a significant time detecting symmetry, especially on the larger instances with more than 20 pigeons. To our surprise, BreakID requires only a quarter of the symmetry preprocessing time sbass uses. This difference is entirely due to Saucy needing much more time to detect automorphisms on the graph encoding of sbass than on the graph encoding of BreakID. Recall that, compared to BreakID, sbass has the smaller encoding graph for automorphism detection due to the use of directed edges. Hence, the most plausible hypothesis to explain the difference in symmetry detection time is simply that Saucy is sensitive to differences in graph encodings, which gets magnified by large problem instances. Nonetheless, even for the largest instance with 100 pigeons, symmetry preprocessing by sbass did not reach the timeout limit.\nThe results on crew are similar to pigeons: BreakID outperforms sbass, which in turn outperforms plain clasp. On the other hand, symmetry preprocessing time is negligible for crew. This is mainly due to the sizes of the ground programs remaining relatively small; less than 3000 rules for the largest ground program in the crew instance set.\nContinuing with graceful, it is striking that the number of solved instances is reduced by symmetry breaking. Upon closer inspection, this is only the case for satisfiable instances. For unsatisfiable graceful instances, sbass and BreakID both solve four instances, two more than clasp. This discrepancy is not uncommon, as static symmetry breaking reduces the search space by sometimes removing easy-to-find solutions. These results are also consistent with those reported by Drescher et al. [15]. Focusing on symmetry preprocessing time, sbass is faster than BreakID. This is consistent with our previous findings [14], where we argued that deriving better symmetry breaking clauses incurs extra overhead.\n12\nLastly, for queens, all approaches solve all four instances easily. Again sbass is faster than BreakID, which is explained by the same reason as for graceful. However, BreakID’s preprocessing time remains well within timeout bounds.\nIt is also interesting to note that on all problem families sbass and BreakID have about the same number of symmetry breaking constraints and auxiliary variables introduced, incurring roughly the same memory overhead for both approaches. However the number of symmetry generators detected by BreakID is much larger. Upon closer inspection, it turns out that BreakID often detects (trivial) interchangeability of facts in the program. There is no advantage in breaking such symmetry, but it does not hurt performance either. We are not sure why sbass does not detect this kind of symmetries. Either it is because of the directional encoding, resulting essentially in a bug similar to Example 5, or it is because of an optimisation for facts we have no knowledge of.\nWe conclude that on the decision problem benchmark set, BreakID outperforms sbass, especially for problems with interchangeable objects such as pigeons and crew. The price to be paid is a bit more symmetry preprocessing overhead, though the size of the symmetry breaking formula remains comparable between both approaches. This is to be expected, as BreakID compared similarly to Shatter for SAT problems."

      "heading" : "5 Discussion and Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we describe our system BreakID, which performs static, groundlevel symmetry breaking for ASP. This type of symmetry breaker is the “easiest” type to implement. It serves merely as a preprocessor for the solver. Other types of symmetry breaking exist as well. For instance, in SAT and constraint programming, dynamic symmetry breaking is well-studied [30, 13, 28]. The disadvantage of these approaches is that they require modifying the internals of the solver at hand. The advantage, however, is that such approaches are often more memory-friendly, since they do not require to create all the symmetry breaking constraints prior to search, are not dependent on any fixed variable order chosen a priori, and do not remove easy-to-find solutions from the search space. Another line of research in symmetry breaking is first-order symmetry detection, where symmetries are detected on the predicate level. In constraint programming, work has been done on composing the symmetry properties of global constraints into a symmetry group of the original problem [33]. However, most existing symmetry detection implementations also detect symmetry on the ground level.\nRecently, we proposed first-order symmetry detection and breaking algorithms for the IDP system [10], a system whose input language relates closely to ASP. The main advantage of such an approach is that it allows to use the structure of the program to detect certain kinds of symmetries without the need for an automorphism tool. The drawbacks are that they cannot detect all types of symmetry and that they are required to interpret a much richer (first-order) language. Thus, such symmetry detection requires a significantly larger implementation effort. We believe it would definitely benefit the community to have a version of gringo, or another ASP grounder, with support for first-order symmetry detection.\nThe techniques we presented here are not bound to the stable semantics. They are equally applicable for instance to the well-founded semantics [32], and hence apply as well to the logic FO(ID) [12] (which combines logic programs under the well-founded semantics with propositional theories). The reason is that our techniques detect syntactic symmetries and hence are agnostic about the semantics at hand.\nWe presented experimental results comparing our tool to the existing ASP symmetry breaker sbass. For the employed decision problem benchmark set, BreakID outperforms sbass, with a small drawback in the form of greater\n14\nsymmetry preprocessing overhead. BreakID also detects and breaks symmetry on optimization problems, though significant speedups have yet to be observed.\nThe result of this work is an easy-to-use tool that can significantly improve performance on non-optimised encodings and works with all modern ASP solvers. It can be downloaded at bitbucket.org/krr/breakid. Our expectation is that using this tool yields no (or very little) performance gain on highly optimised encodings, crafted by experts. However, for average users of ASP tools, BreakID can cut away large parts of the search space and is an improvement to sbass, both from an applicability as well as an efficiency point-of-view."
