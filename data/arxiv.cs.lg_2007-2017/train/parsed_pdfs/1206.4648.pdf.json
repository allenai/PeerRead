      "text" : "Manifold learning algorithms are nonlinear methods for embedding a set of data points into a low-dimensional space while preserving local geometry. Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in spectral approaches to learning manifolds. These kernel eigenmap methods include Isomap (Tenenbaum et al., 2000), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) (Roweis & Saul, 2000), Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) (Belkin & Niyogi, 2002), Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) (Weinberger et al., 2004), and Maximum Entropy Unfolding (MEU) (Lawrence, 2011). Despite the popularity of kernel eigenmap\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nmethods, they are limited in one important respect: they generally only perform well when there is little or no noise. Several authors have attacked the problem of learning manifolds in the presence of noise using methods like neighborhood smoothing (Chen et al., 2008) and robust principal components analysis (Zhan & Yin, 2009; 2011), with some success when noise is limited. Unfortunately, the problem is fundamentally ill posed without some sort of side information about the true underlying signal: by design, manifold methods will recover extra latent dimensions which “explain” the noise.\nWe take a different approach to the problem of learning manifolds from noisy observations. We assume access to instrumental variables, which are correlated with the true latent variables, but uncorrelated with the noise in observations. Such instrumental variables can be used to separate signal from noise, as described in Section 3. Instrumental variables have been used to allow consistent estimation of model parameters in many statistical learning problems, including linear regression (Pearl, 2000), principal component analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 2002), and temporal difference learning (Bradtke & Barto, 1996). Here we extend the scope of this technique to manifold learning. We will pay particular attention to the two-manifold problem, in which two sets of observations each serve as instruments for the other. We propose algorithms for twomanifold problems based on spectral decompositions related to cross-covariance operators; and, we show that the instrumental variable idea suppresses noise in practice.\nFinally we look at a detailed example of how twomanifold methods can help solve difficult machine learning problems. Subspace identification approaches to learning nonlinear dynamical systems depend critically on instrumental variables and the spectral decomposition of (potentially infinite-dimensional) covariance operators (Hsu et al., 2009; Boots et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010). Two-manifold problems are\na natural fit: by relating the spectral decomposition to our two-manifold method, subspace identification techniques can be forced to identify a manifold state space, and consequently, to learn a dynamical system that is both accurate and interpretable, outperforming the current state of the art."

If the kernel K(x,x′) is sufficiently expressive, kernel PCA can find structure that regular PCA misses. Conceptually, if we write the “feature function” φ(x) = K(x, ·), and define an infinitely-tall “matrix” Φ with columns φ(xi), our goal is to recover the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the centered covariance operator Σ̂XX = 1 nΦHΦ T. Here H is the centering matrix H = In − 1n11 T. For efficient computation, we work with the Gram matrix G = 1nΦ TΦ instead of the large or infinite Σ̂XX . The centered Gram matrix C = HGH has the same nonzero eigenvalues as Σ̂XX ; the eigenvectors of Σ̂XX are ΦHviλ −1/2 i , where (λi,vi) are the eigenpairs of C (Schölkopf et al., 1998)."

      "text" : "Kernel eigenmap methods seek a nonlinear function that maps a high-dimensional set of data points to a lower-dimensional space while preserving the manifold on which the data lies. The main insight behind these methods is that large distances in input space are often meaningless due to the large-scale curvature of the manifold; so, ignoring these distances can lead to a significant improvement in dimensionality reduction by “unfolding” the manifold.\nInterestingly, these algorithms can be viewed as special cases of kernel PCA where the Gram matrix G is constructed over the finite domain of the training data in a particular way (Ham et al., 2003). For example, in Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE), we first compute an adjacency matrix W by nearest neighbors: wi,j is nonzero if point i is one of the nearest neighbors of point j, or vice versa. We can either set non-zero weights to 1, or compute them with a kernel such as a Gaussian RBF. Next we let Si,i = ∑ j wi,j , and set L = (S−W). Finally, we eigendecompose L = VΛVT and set the LE embedding to be E = V2:k+1, the k smallest eigenvectors of L excluding the vector corresponding to the 0 eigenvalue. (Optionally we can scale according to eigenvalues, E = V2:k+1Λ −1/2 2:k+1.) To relate LE to kernel PCA, Ham et al. (2003) showed that one can build a Gram matrix from L, G = L†; the LE embedding is\ngiven by the top k eigenvectors (and optionally eigenvalues) of G.\nIn general, many manifold learning methods (including all the kernel eigenmap methods mentioned above) can be viewed as constructing a matrix E of embedding coordinates. From any such method, we can extract an equivalent Gram matrix G = EET. So, for the rest of the paper, we view a manifold learner simply as a black box which accepts data and produces a Gram matrix that encodes the learned manifold structure. This view greatly simplifies the description of our twomanifold algorithms below."

      "text" : "Kernel eigenmap methods are very good at dimensionality reduction when the original data points sample a high-dimensional manifold relatively densely, and when the noise in each sample is small compared to the local curvature of the manifold. In practice, however, observations are frequently noisy, and manifoldlearning algorithms applied to these datasets usually produce biased embeddings. See Figures 1–2, the “noisy swiss rolls,” for an example.\nOur goal is therefore to design a more noise-resistant algorithm for the two-manifold problem. We begin by examining PCA, a linear special case of manifold learning, and studying why it produces biased embeddings in the presence of noise. We next show how to overcome this problem in the linear case, and then use these same ideas to generalize kernel PCA, a nonlinear algorithm. Finally, in Sec. 4, we extend these ideas to fully general kernel eigenmap methods."

This method finds a statistically consistent solution through the use of an instrumental variable (Pearl, 2000; Jolliffe, 2002), an observation yi that is correlated with the true latent variables, but uncorrelated with the noise in xi. Importantly, picking an instrumental variable is not merely a statistical aid, but rather a value judgement about the nature of the latent variable and the noise in the observations. We are defining the noise to be that part of the variability which is uncorrelated with the instrumental variable, and the signal to be that part which is correlated.\nIn our example above, a good instrumental variable yi is a different (noisy) view of the same underlying low-dimensional latent variable: yi = Nzi + ζi for some full-column-rank linear transformation N and i.i.d. zero-mean noise term ζi. The expectation of the empirical cross covariance Σ̂XY = 1 nXY\nT is then M Cov(zi) N\nT: the noise terms, being independent and zero-mean, cancel out. (And the variance of each element of Σ̂XY goes to 0 as n→∞.)\nNow, we can identify the embedding by computing the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) of the covariance: 〈U,D,V〉 = SVD(Σ̂XY , k). If we set k to be the true dimension of z, then as n → ∞, U will converge to an orthonormal basis for the range of M, and V will converge to an orthonormal basis for the range of N. The corresponding embeddings are then given by UTX and VTY.2 Interestingly, we can equally well view xi as an instrumental variable for yi: we simultaneously find consistent embeddings of both xi and yi, using each to unbias the other."

We assume noisy observations xi = f(zi)+ i, where zi is the desired low-dimensional latent variable, i is an i.i.d. noise term, and f is a smooth function with smooth inverse (so that f(zi) lies on a manifold). Our goal is to recover f and zi up to identifiability.\nKernel PCA (Sec. 2.1) is a common approach to this problem. In the (restrictive) realizable case, kernel PCA gets the right answer: that is, suppose that zi has dimension k, that i has zero variance, and that we have at least k independent samples. And, suppose that φ(f(z)) is a linear function of z. Then, the Gram matrix or the covariance “matrix” will have rank k, and we can reconstruct a basis for the range of φ ◦\n2Several spectral decompositions of cross-covariance matrices can be viewed as special cases of two-subspace PCA that involve transforming the variables xi and yi before applying a singular value decomposition.

(Similarly, if φ ◦ f is near linear and the variance of i is small, we can expect kernel PCA to work well, if not perfectly.)\nHowever, just as PCA recovers a biased answer when the variance of i is nonzero, kernel PCA will also recover a biased answer under noise, even in the limit of infinite data. The bias of kernel PCA follows immediately from the example at the beginning of Section 3: if we use a linear kernel, kernel PCA will simply reproduce the bias of ordinary PCA.\n3.2.1.Instrumental Variables in Hilbert Space\nBy analogy to two-subspace PCA, a natural generalization of kernel PCA is two-subspace kernel PCA, which we can accomplish via a kernelized SVD of a cross-covariance operator in Hilbert space. Given a joint distribution P[X,Y ] over two variables X on X and Y on Y, with feature maps φ and υ (corresponding to kernels Kx and Ky), the cross-covariance operator ΣXY is E[φ(x) ⊗ υ(y)]. The cross-covariance operator reduces to an ordinary cross-covariance matrix in the finite-dimensional case; in the infinite-dimensional case, it can be viewed as a kernel mean map descriptor (Smola et al., 2007) for the joint distribution P[X,Y ]. The concept of a cross-covariance operator allows us to extend the methods of instrumental variables to infinite dimensional RKHSs. In our example above, a good instrumental variable yi is a different (noisy) view of the same underlying latent variable: yi = g(zi) + ζi for some smoothly invertible function g and i.i.d. zero-mean noise term ζi."

The centered empirical covariance operator is then Σ̂XY = 1 n (ΦH)(ΥH) T. The goal of the kernel SVD is then to factor Σ̂XY so that we can recover the desired bases for φ(xi) and υ(yi). Unfortunately, this conceptual algorithm is impractical, since Σ̂XY can be high- or infinite-dimensional. So, instead, we perform an SVD on the covariance operator in Hilbert space via a trick analogous to kernel PCA.\nTo understand SVD in general Hilbert spaces, we start by looking at a Gram matrix formulation of finite dimensional SVD. Recall that the singular values of Σ̂XY = 1 n (XH)(YH) T are the square roots of the\n3The kernel SVD algorithm previously appeared as an intermediate step in (Song et al., 2010; Fukumizu et al., 2005); here we give a more complete description.\neigenvalues of Σ̂XY Σ̂Y X (where Σ̂Y X = Σ̂ T XY ), and the left singular vectors are defined to be the corresponding eigenvectors. We can find identical eigenvectors and eigenvalues using only centered Gram matrices CX = 1 n (XH) T(XH) and CY = 1 n (YH)\nT(YH). Let vi be a right eigenvector of CY CX , so that CY CXvi = λivi. Premultiplying by (XH) yields\n1\nn2 (XH)(YH)T(YH)(XH)T(XH)vi = λi(XH)vi\nand regrouping terms gives us Σ̂XY Σ̂Y Xwi = λiwi where wi = (XH)vi. So, λi is an eigenvalue of Σ̂XY Σ̂Y X , √ λi is a singular value of Σ̂XY , and (XH)viλ −1/2 i is the corresponding unit length left singular vector. An analogous argument shows that, if w′i is a unit-length right singular vector of Σ̂XY , then w′i = (YH)v ′ iλ −1/2 i , where v ′ i is a unit-length left eigenvector of CY CX .\nThis machinery allows us to solve the two-subspace kernel PCA problem by computing the singular values of the empirical covariance operator Σ̂XY . We define GX and GY to be the Gram matrices whose elements are Kx(xi,xj) and Ky(yi,yj) respectively, and then compute the eigendecomposition of CY CX = (HGY H)(HGXH). This method avoids any computations in infinite-dimensional spaces; and, it gives us compact representations of the left and right singular vectors.\nUnder appropriate assumptions, we can show that the SVD of the empirical cross-covariance operator Σ̂XY = 1 nΦHΥ\nT converges to the desired value. Suppose that E[φ(xi) | zi] is a linear function of zi, and similarly, that E[υ(yi) | zi] is a linear function of zi.\n4 The noise terms φ(xi) − E[φ(xi) | zi] and υ(yi) − E[υ(yi) | zi] are by definition zero-mean; and they are independent of each other, since the first depends only on i and the second only on ζi. So, the noise terms cancel out, and the expectation of Σ̂XY is the true covariance ΣXY . If we additionally assume that the noise terms have finite variance, the product-RKHS norm of the error Σ̂XY − ΣXY vanishes as n→∞.\nThe remainder of the proof follows from the proof of Theorem 1 in (Song et al., 2010) (the convergence of the empirical estimator of the kernel covariance oper-\n4The assumption of linearity is restrictive, but appears necessary: in order to learn a representation of a manifold using factorization-based methods, we need to pick a kernel which flattens out the manifold into a subspace.

In particular, the top k left singular vectors of Σ̂XY converge to a basis for the range of E[φ(xi) | zi] (considered as a function of zi); similarly, the top right singular vectors of Σ̂XY converge to a basis for the range of E[υ(yi) | zi]."

As we will see, this procedure allows us to regain good performance when observations are noisy.\nSuppose we are given two set of observations residing on (or near) two different manifolds: x1, . . . ,xn ∈ Rd1 on MX and y1, . . . ,yn ∈ Rd2 on MY .

We further assume that the noise terms i and ζi move xi and yi within their respective manifolds MX and MY : this assumption is without loss of generality, since we can can always increase the dimension of the manifolds MX and MY to allow an arbitrary noise term. See Figure 1 for an example.\nIf the variance of the noise terms i and ζi is too high, or if MX and MY are higher-dimensional than the latent MZ manifold (i.e., if the noise terms move xi and yi away from f(MZ) and g(MZ)), then it may be difficult to reconstruct f(MZ) or g(MZ) separately from xi or yi. Our goal, therefore, is to use xi and yi together to reconstruct both manifolds simultaneously: the extra information from the correspondence between xi and yi will make up for noise, allowing success in the two-manifold problem where the individual one-manifold problems are intractable.\nGiven samples of n i.i.d. pairs {xi,yi}ni=1 from two manifolds, we propose a two-step spectral learning algorithm for two-manifold problems: first, use either a given kernel or an ordinary one-manifold algorithm such as LE or LLE to compute centered Gram matrices CX and CY from xi and yi separately. Second, use kernel SVD to recover the embedding of points in MZ . The procedure, called instrumental eigenmaps, is summarized in Algorithm 1.\nAs shown in Figure 2, computing eigenvalues of CXCY instead of CX or CY alone alters the eigensystem: it promotes directions within each individual learned manifold that are useful for predicting coordinates on the other learned manifold, and demotes directions that are not useful. This effect strengthens our ability to recover relevant dimensions in the face of noise."

This task requires two related subtasks: 1) learning a low dimensional state space, which is often known to lie on a manifold ; and 2) learning the system dynamics.\nWe propose tackling this problem by combining twomanifold methods (for task 1) with spectral learning algorithms for nonlinear dynamical systems (for task 2) (Song et al., 2010; Siddiqi et al., 2010; Boots et al., 2011; Boots & Gordon, 2010; Hsu et al., 2009; Boots et al., 2010). Here, we focus on a specific example: we show how to combine HSE-HMMs (Song et al., 2010), a powerful nonparametric approach to system identification, with manifold learning. We demonstrate that the resulting manifold HSE-HMM can outperform standard HSE-HMMs (and many other wellknown methods for learning dynamical systems): the manifold HSE-HMM accurately discovers a curved low-dimensional manifold which contains the state space, while other methods discover only a (potentially much higher-dimensional) subspace which contains this manifold."

HSE-HMMs implement this idea by finding a low-dimensional embedding of the conditional probability distribution of sequences of future observations, and using the embedding coordinates as state. Song et al. (2010) suggest finding this lowdimensional state space as a subspace of an infinite dimensional RKHS.\nIntuitively, we might think that we could find the best state space by performing PCA or kernel PCA of sequences of future observations. That is, we would sample n sequences of future observations x1, . . . ,xn ∈ Rd1 from a dynamical system. We would then construct a Gram matrix GX , whose (i, j) element is Kx(xi,xj). Finally, we would find the eigendecomposition of the centered Gram matrix CX = HGXH as in Section 2.1. The resulting embedding coordinates would be tuned to predict future observations well, and so could be viewed as a good state space. However, the state space found by kernel PCA is biased : it typically includes noise, information that cannot be predicted from past observations. We would like instead to find a low dimensional state space that is uncorrelated with the noise in the future observations.\nSo, in addition to sampling sequences of future observations, we sample corresponding sequences of past observations y1, . . . ,yn ∈ Rd2 : sequence yi ends at time ti − 1. We view features of the past as instrumental variables to unbias the future. We therefore construct a Gram matrix GY , whose (i, j) element is Ky(yi,yj). From GY we construct the centered Gram matrix CY = HGY H. Finally, we identify the state space using a kernel SVD as in Section 3.2.2: 〈U,Λ,VT〉 = SVD(CXCY , k). The left singular “vectors” (reconstructed from U as in Section 3.2.2) now identify a subspace in which the system evolves. From this subspace, we can proceed to identify the parameters of the system as in Song et al. (2010)."

The goal was to learn a dynamical model of the noisy IMU data, and, after filtering, to predict current and future 2-dimensional locations. We used the first 2000 data points as training data, and held out the last 500 data points for testing the learned models. We trained four models, and evaluated these models based on prediction accuracy, and, where appropriate, the learned latent state.\nFirst, we trained a 20-dimensional embedded HMM with the spectral algorithm of Song et al. (2010), using sequences of 150 consecutive observations and Gaussian RBF kernels. Second, we trained a similar 20- dimensional embedded HMM with normalized LE kernels. (Normalized LE differs from LE by utilizing the normalized graph Laplacian instead of the standard graph Laplacian.) The number of nearest neighbors was selected to be 50, and the other parameters were set to be identical to the first model. (So, the only difference is that the first model performs a kernel SVD, while the second model solves a two-manifold problem.) Third, we trained a 20-dimensional Kalman filter using the N4SID algorithm (Van Overschee & De Moor, 1996) with Hankel matrices of 150 time steps; and finally, we learned a 20-state HMM (with 400 levels of discretization for observations) via the EM algorithm.\nWe compared the learned state spaces of the first three models. These models differ mainly in their kernel: Gaussian RBF, learned manifold from normalized LE, or linear. As a test, we tried to reconstruct the 2- dimensional locations of the car (collected from an overhead camera, and not used in learning the dynamical systems) from each of the three latent state spaces: the more accurate the learned state space, the better we expect to be able to reconstruct the locations. Results are shown in Figure 3(B).\nFinally we examined the prediction accuracy of each model.

Our aim is different: we assume paired data, where manifold alignments do not; and, we focus on learning algorithms that simultaneously discover manifold structure and connections between manifolds (as provided by, e.g., a top-level learning problem defined between two manifolds).\nInterconnected dimensionality reduction has been explored before in sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) (Li, 1991; Cook & Yin, 2001; Fukumizu et al., 2004). In SDR, the goal is to find a linear subspace of covariates xi that makes response vectors yi conditionally independent of the xis. The formulation is in terms of conditional independence. Unfortunately, the solution to SDR problems usually requires a difficult nonlinear non-convex optimization. A related method is manifold kernel dimension reduction (Nilsson et al., 2007), which finds an embedding of covariates xi using a kernel eigenmap method, and then attempts to find a linear transformation of some of the dimensions of the embedded points to predict response variables yi. The response variables are constrained to be linear in\nthe manifold, so the problem is quite different from a two-manifold problem."

We design algorithms by relating two-manifold problems to cross-covariance operators in RKHSs, and show that these algorithms result in a significant improvement over standard manifold learning approaches in the presence of noise. This is an appealing result: manifold learning algorithms typically assume that observations are (close to) noiseless, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the utility of twomanifold problems by extending a recent dynamical system identification algorithm to learn a system with a state space that lies on a manifold. The resulting algorithm learns a model that outperforms the current state of the art in predictive accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first combination of system identification and manifold learning that accurately identifies a latent time series manifold and is competitive with the best system identification algorithms at learning accurate predictive models."

These methods have had some successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning problems together, two-manifold algorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias. We propose a class of algorithms for two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance operators in Hilbert space, and discuss when two-manifold problems are useful. Finally, we demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data.",
