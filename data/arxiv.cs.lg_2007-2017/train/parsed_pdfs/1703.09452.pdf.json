      "text" : "Speech enhancement tries to improve the intelligibility and quality of speech contaminated by additive noise [1]. Its main applications are related to improving the quality of mobile communications in noisy environments. However, we also find important applications related to hearing aids and cochlear implants, where enhancing the signal before amplification can significantly reduce discomfort and increase intelligibility [2]. Speech enhancement has also been successfully applied as a preprocessing stage in speech recognition and speaker identification systems [3, 4, 5].\nClassic speech enhancement methods are spectral subtraction [6], Wiener filtering [7], statistical model-based methods [8], and subspace algorithms [9, 10]. Neural networks have been also applied to speech enhancement since the 80s [11, 12]. Recently, the denoising auto-encoder architecture [13] has been widely adopted. However, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are also used. For instance, the recurrent denoising autoencoder has shown significant performance exploiting the temporal context information in embedded signals. Most recent approaches apply long short-term memory RNNs to the denoising task [4, 14]. In [15] and [16], noise features are estimated and included in the input features of deep neural networks. The use of dropout, post-filtering, and perceptually motivated metrics are shown to be effective.\nMost of the current systems are based on the short-time Fourier analysis/synthesis framework [1]. They only modify the spectrum magnitude, as it is often claimed that short-time phase\nis not important for speech enhancement [17]. However, further studies [18] show that significant improvements of speech quality are possible especially when a clean phase spectrum is known. In 1988, Tamura et al. [11] proposed a deep network that worked directly on the raw audio waveform, but they used feed-forward layers that worked frame-by-frame (60 samples) on a speaker-dependent and isolated-word database.\nA recent breakthrough in the deep learning generative modeling field are generative adversarial networks (GANs) [19], which have achieved a good level of success in the computer vision field to generate realistic images and generalize well to pixel-wise, complex (high-dimensional) distributions [20, 21, 22]. As far as we are concerned, GANs have not yet been applied to any speech generation nor enhancement task, so this is the first approach to use the adversarial framework to generate speech signals.\nThe main advantages of the proposed speech enhancement GAN are:\n• It provides a quick enhancement process. No causality is required and, hence, no recursive operation like in RNNs.\n• It works end-to-end, with the raw audio. Therefore, no hand-crafted features are extracted and, with that, no explicit assumptions about the raw data are done.\n• It learns from different speakers and noise types, and incorporates them together into the same shared parametrization. This makes the system simple and generalizable in those dimensions.\nIn the following, we give an overview of GANs (Sec. 2). Next, we describe the proposed model (Sec. 3) and its experimental setup (Sec. 4). We finally report the results (Sec. 5) and discuss some conclusions (Sec. 6)."

      "text" : "GANs [19] are generative models that learn to map samples z from some prior distribution Z to samples x from another distribution X , which is the one of the training examples (e.g., images, audio, etc.). The component within the GAN structure that performs the mapping is called the generator (G), and its main task is to learn an effective mapping that can imitate the real data distribution to generate novel samples related to those of the training set. Importantly, G does so not by memorizing input-output pairs, but by mapping the data distribution characteristics to the manifold defined in our prior Z .\nThe way in which G learns to do the mapping is by means of an adversarial training, where we have another component, called the discriminator (D). D is typically a binary classifier, and its inputs are either real samples, coming from the dataset that G is imitating, or fake samples, made up by G. The adversarial characteristic comes from the fact that D has to classify the samples coming from X as real, whereas the samples\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n09 45\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n8 M\nar 2\n01 7\ncoming from G, X̂ , have to be classified as fake. This leads to G trying to fool D, and the way to do so is that G adapts its parameters such that D classifies G’s output as real. During back-propagation, D gets better at finding realistic features in its input and, in turn, G corrects its parameters to move towards the real data manifold described by the training data (Fig. 1). This adversarial learning process is formulated as a minimax game between G and D, with the objective\nmin G max D V (D,G) = Ex∼pdata(x) [logD(x)]+\n+ Ez∼pz(z) [log (1−D (G (z)))] . (1)\nWe can also work with a conditioned version of GANs, where we have some extra information in G and D to perform mapping and classification (see [20] and references therein). In that case, we may add some extra input xc, from which we would change the objective function to\nmin G max D V (D,G) = Ex∼pdata(x,xc) [logD(x, xc)]+\n+ Exc∼pdata(xc),z∼pz(z) [log (1−D (G (z, xc)))] . (2)\nThere have been recent improvements in the GAN methodology to stabilize training and increase the quality of the generated samples in G, because the classic approach suffered from vanishing gradients due to the sigmoid cross-entropy loss function that was used to compute the cost. To solve this, we employ the least-squares GAN (LSGAN) approach [21], which substitutes the cost function by the least-squares function with binary coding (1 is real, 0 is fake). With this, the formulation in Eq. 2 changes to\nmin D\nVLSGAN(D) = 1\n2 Ex∼pdata(x,xc)[(D(x, xc)− 1) 2]+\n+ 1\n2 Exc∼pdata(xc),z∼pz(z)[D(G(z, xc)) 2]\n(3)\nmin G\nVLSGAN(G) = 1\n2 Ex∼pdata(xc),z∼pz(z)[(D(G(z, xc))− 1) 2].\n(4)"

      "text" : "The enhancement problem is defined so that we have an input noisy signal x̃ and we want to clean it to obtain the enhanced signal x̂. We propose to do so with a speech enhancement GAN\n(SEGAN). In our case, the G network performs the enhancement. Its inputs are the noisy speech signal x̃ together with the latent representation z, and its output is the enhanced version x̂ = G(x̃). We design G to be fully convolutional, so that there are no fully connected layers at all. This enforces the network to focus on temporally-close correlations in the input signal and throughout the whole layering process. Furthermore, it reduces the number of training parameters and therefore training time.\nThe G network is structured similarly to an auto-encoder (Fig. 2). In the encoding stage, the input signal is projected and compressed through a number of strided convolutional layers followed by PReLUs [23], getting a convolution result out of every N steps of the filter . We choose strided convolutions as they were shown to be more stable for GAN training than other pooling approaches [22]. Decimation is done until we get a condensed representation, called the thought vector c, which gets concatenated with the latent vector z. The encoding process is reversed in the decoding stage by means of fractionalstrided transposed convolutions (sometimes called deconvolutions), followed again by PReLUs.\nThe G network also features skip connections, connecting each encoding layer to its homologous decoding layer, and bypassing the compression performed in the middle of the model (Fig. 2). This is done because the input and the output of the model share the same underlying structure, which is that of the natural speech, and many low level details could be lost to reconstruct the speech waveform properly if we force all the information to flow through the compression bottleneck. Skip connections directly pass the fine-grained information of the waveform to the decoding stage. In addition, they offer a better training behavior, as the gradients can flow deeper through the whole structure without suffering much vanishing [24].\nAn important feature of G is its end-to-end structure, so that it processes raw speech sampled at 16 kHz, getting rid of any\nintermediate transformations to extract acoustic features (contrasting to many common pipelines). In this type of model, we have to be careful with typical regression losses like mean absolute error or mean squared error, as noted in the raw speech generative model WaveNet [25]. These losses work under strong assumptions on how our output distribution is shaped and, therefore, impose important modeling limitations, like not allowing multi-modal distributions and biasing the predictions towards an average of all the possible predictions. Our solution to overcome these limitations is to use the generative adversarial setting. This way, D is in charge of transmitting information to G of what is real and what is fake in the data it is getting, such that G can slightly correct its output waveform towards the realistic distribution, getting rid of the noisy signals as those are signaled to be fake. In this sense, D can be understood as learning some sort of loss detailing the output distribution corrections required for G’s output to look real.\nIn preliminary experiments, we found it convenient to add a secondary component to the loss of G in order to minimize the distance between its generations and the clean examples. To measure such distance, we chose the L1 norm, as it has been proven to be effective in the image manipulation domain [20, 26]. This way, we let the adversarial component to add more fine-grained and realistic results. The magnitude of theL1 norm is controlled by a new hyper-parameter λ, so that the G loss in Eq. 4 becomes\nmin G\nVLSGAN(G) = 1\n2 Ex∼pdata(xc),z∼pz(z)[(D(G(z, xc))− 1) 2]+\n+ λ ‖G(z, x̃)− x‖1. (5)"

The data set is a selection of 30 speakers from the Voice Bank corpus [28]: 28 are included in the train set and 2 in the test set.\nTo make the noisy training set, a total of 40 different conditions are considered [27]: 10 types of noise (2 artificial and 8 from the Demand database [29]) with 4 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) each (15, 10, 5, and 0 dB). There are around 10 different sentences in each condition per training speaker.

Importantly, the test set is totally unseen by (and different from) the training set, using different speakers and conditions."

      "heading" : "4.2. SEGAN Setup",
      "text" : "The model is trained for 86 epochs with RMSprop [30] and a learning rate of 0.0002, using an effective batch size of 400. We structure the training examples in two pairs (Fig. 3): the real pair, composed of a noisy signal and a clean signal (x̃ and x), and the fake pair, composed of a noisy signal and an enhanced signal (x̃ and x̂). To adequate the data set files to our waveform\n1http://dx.doi.org/10.7488/ds/1356\ngeneration purposes, we down-sample the original utterances from 48 kHz to 16 kHz. During train, we extract chunks of waveforms with a sliding window of approximately one second of speech (16384 samples) every 500 ms (50% overlap). During test, we basically slide the window with no overlap through the whole duration of our test utterance and concatenate the results at the end of the stream.\nRegarding the λweight of ourL1 regularization, after some experimentation, we set it to 100 for the whole training. We initially set it to 1, but we observed that the G loss was two orders of magnitude under the adversarial one, so the L1 had no practical effect on the learning. Once we set it to 100, we saw a minimization behavior in the L1 and an equilibrium behavior in the adversarial one. As the L1 got lower, the quality of the output samples increased, which we hypothesize helped G being more effective in terms of realistic generation.\nRegarding the architecture, G is composed of 22 onedimensional strided convolutional layers of filter width 31 and strides of N = 2. The amount of filters per layer increases so that the depth gets larger as the width (duration of signal in time) gets narrower. The resulting dimensions per layer, being it samples × feature maps, is 16384×1, 8192×16, 4096×32, 2048×32, 1024×64, 512×64, 256×128, 128×128, 64×256, 32×256, 16×512, and 8×1024. There, we sample the noise samples z from our prior 8×1024-dimensional normal distribution N (0, I). As mentioned, the decoder stage of G is a mirroring of the encoder with the same filter widths and the same amount of filters per layer. However, skip connections and the addition of the latent vector make the number of feature maps in every layer to be doubled.\nThe network D follows the same one-dimensional convolutional structure as G’s encoder stage, and it fits to the conventional topology of a convolutional classification network. The differences are that (1) it gets two input channels of 16384 samples, (2) it uses LeakyReLU non-linearities with α = 0.3, and (3) in the last activation layer there is a one-dimensional convolution layer with one filter of width one that does not downsample the hidden activations (1×1 convolution). The latter (3) reduces the amount of parameters required for the final classification neuron, which is fully connected to all hidden activations with a linear behavior. This means that we reduce the amount of required parameters in that fully connected component from 8× 1024 = 8192 to 8, and the way in which the 1024 channels are merged is learnable in the parameters of the convolution.\nAll the project is developed with the TensorFlow deep learning framework [31], and the code is available at https: //github.com/santi-pdp/segan. We refer to this resource for further fine-grained details of our implementation. A sample of the enhanced speech audios is provided at http: //veu.talp.cat/segan."

      "text" : "As a first assessment of the performance of our approach, we compute the following objective measures to evaluate the quality of the enhanced speech over the 824 files of the test set. All measures are defined as predictors of the mean opinion score (MOS) that would be obtained in subjective tests, and all go from 1 (bad quality/high distortion/intrusive noise) to 5 (excellent quality/no degradation/not noticeable noise). All metrics compare the enhanced signal with the clean reference. They have been computed using the implementation included in [1], and available at the publisher website2.\n• PESQ: Perceptual evaluation of speech quality, using the wide-band version recommended in ITU-T P.862.2 [32].\n• CSIG: MOS rating of the signal distortion attending only to the speech signal [33].\n• CBAK: MOS rating of the intrusiveness of background noise [33].\n• COVL: MOS rating of the overall effect [33].\nTable 1 shows the results of these metrics. To have a comparative reference, the table also shows the results of these metrics when applied directly to the noisy signals and to signals filtered using the Wiener algorithm based on a priori SNR estimation [34], as provided in [1]. It can be observed how SEGAN gets slightly better PESQ and COVL than the noisy signal and the Wiener-enhanced signal. SEGAN reduces less noise than Wiener (CBAK), but produces less distortion in the speech signal (CSIG), achieving better overall results (COVL)."

      "text" : "To get a better assessment, a perceptual test has been carried out to compare SEGAN with the noisy signal and the Wiener baseline. For that, 20 sentences were selected from the test set. As the database does not indicate the amount and type of noise for each file, the selection was done by listening to some of the provided noisy files, trying to balance different noise types. Most of the files have low SNR, but a few with high SNR were also included.\nA total of 19 listeners were presented with the 20 sentences in a randomized order. For each sentence, three versions were\n2https://www.crcpress.com/downloads/K14513/ K14513_CD_Files.zip\npresented, also in random order: noisy signal, Wiener-enhanced signal, and SEGAN-enhanced signal. For each signal, the listener rated the overall quality, using a scale from 1 to 5. In the description of the 5 categories, they were instructed to pay attention to both the signal distortion and the noise intrusiveness (e.g., 5=excellent: very natural speech with no degradation and not noticeable noise). Listeners could listen to each signal as many times as they wanted, and were asked to pay attention to the comparative rate of the three signals.\nThe results are shown in Table 2. It can be observed how SEGAN is preferred over both the noisy signal and the Wiener baseline. However, as there is a large variation in the SNR of the noisy signal, the MOS range, for all the systems, is very large, and the difference between Wiener and SEGAN is not significant. However, as the listeners compared all the systems at same time, it is possible to compute the comparative MOS (CMOS) by subtracting the MOS of the two systems being compared. Fig. 4 shows the CMOS when comparing SEGAN with respect to the noisy or the Wiener-enhanced signals. We can see how the signals generated by SEGAN are preferred over both. More specifically, SEGAN is preferred over the original (noisy) signal in 62% of the cases, while the noisy signal is preferred in 12.1% of the cases (no preference in 25.9% of the cases). With respect to the Wiener system, SEGAN is preferred in 47.8% of cases and Wiener is preferred in 24% of the cases (no preference in 28.2% of the cases)."

The model works as an encoder-decoder fully-convolutional structure, which makes it fast to operate for denoising waveform chunks. The results show that, not only the method is viable, but it can also represent an effective alternative to current approaches. Possible future work involves the exploration of better convolutional structures and the inclusion of perceptual weightings in the adversarial training, so that we reduce possible high frequency artifacts that might be introduced by the current model. Further experiments need to be done to compare SEGAN with other competitive approaches."

    "abstractText" : "Current speech enhancement techniques operate on the spectral domain and/or exploit some higher-level feature. The majority of them tackle a limited number of noise conditions and rely on first-order statistics. To circumvent these issues, deep networks are being increasingly used, thanks to their ability to learn complex functions from large example sets. In this work, we propose the use of generative adversarial networks for speech enhancement. In contrast to current techniques, we operate at the waveform level, training the model end-to-end, and incorporate 28 speakers and 40 different noise conditions into the same model, such that model parameters are shared across them. We evaluate the proposed model using an independent, unseen test set with two speakers and 20 alternative noise conditions. The enhanced samples confirm the viability of the proposed model, and both objective and subjective evaluations confirm the effectiveness of it. With that, we open the exploration of generative architectures for speech enhancement, which may progressively incorporate further speech-centric design choices to improve their performance.",
