The typical attention mechanism used in these architectures computes a new attention context at each decoding\n∗Equal Contribution. Author order alphabetical.\nstep based on the current state of the decoder. Intuitively, this corresponds to looking at the source sequence after the output of every single target token.\nInspired by how humans process sentences, we believe it may be unnecessary to look back at the entire original source sequence at each step.1 We thus propose an alternative attention mechanism (section 3) that leads to smaller computational time complexity. Our method predictsK attention context vectors while reading the source, and learns to use a weighted average of these vectors at each step of decoding. Thus, we avoid looking back at the source sequence once it has been encoded. We show (section 4) that this speeds up inference while performing on-par with the standard mechanism on both toy and real-world WMT translation datasets. We also show that our mechanism leads to larger speedups as sequences get longer. Finally, by visualizing the attention scores (section 5), we verify that the proposed technique learns meaningful alignments, and that different attention context vectors specialize on different parts of the source."

      "text" : "Our models are based on an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015). An encoder function takes as input a sequence of source tokens x=(x1,...,xm) and produces a sequence of states s=(s1,...,sm) .The decoder is an RNN that predicts the probability of a target sequence y=(y1,...,yT |s). The probability of each target token yi ∈{1,...,|V |} is predicted based on the recurrent state in the decoder RNN, hi, the previous words, y<i, and a context vector ci. The context vector ci, also referred to as the attention vector, is calculated as a weighted average of the source states.\n1Eye-tracking and keystroke logging data from human translators show that translators generally do not reread previously translated source text words when producing target text (Carl et al., 2011).\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n00 11\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nJ ul\n2 01\n7\nci= ∑ j αijsj (1)\nαi=softmax(fatt(hi,s)) (2)\nHere, fatt(hi, s) is an attention function that calculates an unnormalized alignment score between the encoder state sj and the decoder state hi.

During encoding, we compute an attention matrix C∈RK×D, where K is the number of attention vectors and a hyperparameter of our method, and D is the dimensionality of the top-most encoder state. This matrix is computed by predicting a score vector αt ∈ RK at each encoding time step t. C is then a linear combination of the encoder states, weighted by αt:\nCk= |S|∑ t=0 αtkst (4)\nαt=softmax(Wαst), (5)\nwhereWα is a parameter matrix in RK×D.

Note that we do not access the encoder states at each decoder step. We simply take a linear combination of the attention matrix C pre-computed during encoding - a much cheaper operation that is independent of the length of the source sequence. The time complexity of this computation isO(KD|T |) as multiplication with theK attention matrices needs to happen at each decoding step.\nSumming O(KD|S|) from encoding and O(KD|T |) from decoding, we have a total linear computational complexity of O(KD(|S| + |T |). As D is typically very large, 512 or 1024 units in most applications, we expect our model to be faster than the standard attention mechanism running in O(D2|S||T |). For long sequences (as in summarization, where —S— is large), we also expect our model to be faster than the cheaper dot-based attention mechanism, which needs O(D|S||T |) computation time and requires encoder and decoder states sizes to match.\nWe also experimented with using a sigmoid function instead of the softmax to score the encoder and decoder attention scores, resulting in 4 possible combinations. We call this choice the scoring function. A softmax scoring function calculates normalized scores, while the sigmoid scoring function results in unnormalized scores that can be understood as gates."

      "text" : "Our memory-based attention model can be understood intuitively in two ways. We can interpret it as ”predicting” the set of attention contexts produced by a standard attention mechanism during encoding. To see this, assume we set K≈|T |. In this case, we predict all |T | attention contexts during the encoding stage and learn to choose the right one during decoding. This is cheaper than computing contexts one-by-one based on the decoder and encoder content. In fact, we could enforce this objective by first training\na regular attention model and adding a regularization term to force the memory matrix C to be close to the T×D vectors computed by the standard attention. We leave it to future work to explore such an objective.\nAlternatively, we can interpret our mechanism as first predicting a compact K ×D memory matrix, a representation of the source sequence, and then performing location-based attention on the memory by picking which row of the matrix to attend to. Standard location-based attention mechanism, by contrast, predicts a location in the source sequence to focus on (Luong et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015)."

We can see that earlier encoder states are upweighted in the first context vectors, and later states are upweighted in later vectors. The symmetry of the manifold and its stationary point having value 0.5 both follow from Eq. 10. The elements of the matrix that fall beyond the sequence lengths are then masked out and the remaining elements are renormalized across the timestep dimension.

Across the board, models with K = 64 performed better than corresponding models with K =32, suggesting that using a larger number of attention vectors can capture a richer understanding of source sequences.

We measured decoding time over the full validation set, not including time used for model setup and data loading, averaged across 10 runs.

      "heading" : "5 Visualizing Attention",
      "text" : "A useful property of the standard attention mechanism is that it produces meaningful alignment between source and target sequences. Often, the attention mechanism learns to progressively focus on the next source token as it decodes the target. These visualizations can be an important tool in debugging and evaluating seq2seq models and are often used for unknown token replacement.\nThis raises the question of whether or not our proposed memory attention mechanism also learns to generate meaningful alignments. Due to limiting the number of attention contexts to a number that is generally less than the sequence length, it is not immediately obvious what each context would learn to focus on. Our hope was that the model would learn to focus on multiple alignments at the same time, within the same attention vector. For example, if the source sequence is of length 40 and we haveK=10 attention contexts, we would hope that C1 roughly focuses on tokens 1 to 4, C2 on tokens 5 to 8, and so on. Figures 6 and 7 show that this is indeed the case. To generate this visualization we multiply the attention scores α and β from the encoder and decoder. Figure 8 shows a sample translation task visualization.\nFigure 6 suggests that our model learns distinct ways to use its memory depending on the encoder and decoder functions. Interestingly, using softmax normalization results in attention maps typical of those derived from using standard attention, i.e. a relatively linear mapping between source and target tokens. Meanwhile, using sigmoid gating results in what seems to be a distributed representation of the source sequences across encoder time steps, with multiple contiguous attention contexts being accessed at each decoding step."

Efficient location-based attention (Xu et al., 2015) has also been explored in the image recognition domain.\nWu et al.

We show that our attention mechanism learns meaningful alignments despite being constrained to a fixed representation after encoding. We encourage future work that explores the optimal values of K for various language tasks and examines whether or not it is possible to predict K based on the task at hand. We also encourage evaluating our models on other tasks that must deal with long sequences but have compact representations, such as summarization and question-answering, and further exploration of their effect on memory and training speed."

Our technique predicts a compact set of K attention contexts during encoding and lets the decoder compute an efficient lookup that does not need to consult the memory. We show that our approach performs on-par with the standard attention mechanism while yielding inference speedups of 20% for real-world translation tasks and more for tasks with longer sequences. By visualizing attention scores we demonstrate that our models learn distinct, meaningful alignments.",
