Lenguajes y Sistemas Inform aticosUniversidad de AlicanteAlicante, SPAIN AbstractThis paper presents an algorithm for identifying noun-phrase antecedents of pronounsand adjectival anaphors in Spanish dialogues. We believe that anaphora resolution requiresnumerous sources of information in order to nd the correct antecedent of the anaphor.These sources can be of di erent kinds, e.g., linguistic information, discourse/dialoguestructure information, or topic information. For this reason, our algorithm uses variousdi erent kinds of information (hybrid information). The algorithm is based on linguisticconstraints and preferences and uses an anaphoric accessibility space within which the al-gorithm nds the noun phrase. We present some experiments related to this algorithmand this space using a corpus of 204 dialogues. The algorithm is implemented in Prolog.According to this study, 95.9% of antecedents were located in the proposed space, a preci-sion of 81.3% was obtained for pronominal anaphora resolution, and 81.5% for adjectivalanaphora.1. IntroductionAnaphora resolution is one of the most active areas of research in Natural Language Pro-cessing (NLP). The comprehension of anaphora is an important process in any NLP system,yet it is among the toughest problems in computational linguistics and NLP. According toHirst (1981):Anaphora, in discourse, is a device for making an abbreviated reference (con-taining fewer bits of disambiguating information, rather than being lexically orphonetically shorter) to some entity (or entities) in the expectation that the re-ceiver of the discourse will be able to disabbreviate the reference and, thereby,determine the identity of the entity.The reference to an entity (e.g., a pronoun) is generally called an anaphor, the entityto which the anaphor refers is its referent, and the previous reference to the same entityis the anaphor's antecedent. For instance, in the statement \\Johni ate an apple. Hei washungry\", the pronoun he is the anaphor and the noun John is the antecedent.An anaphoric problem can be described as lying somewhere between the resolution andthe generation of anaphora, the former term being the disabbreviating of the reference andc 2001 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers. All rights reserved.\nPalomar & Mart nez-Barcothe latter being the abbreviating form of the reference to an entity. This paper focusesexclusively on the resolution of anaphora and not on their generation. Anaphora can beclassi ed in many di erent ways, depending upon the particular criteria one chooses toemploy. Regarding the element that carries out the reference (the anaphor), for exam-ple, clear distinctions should be made between pronominal anaphora, adjectival anaphora,de nite descriptions, one-anaphora, surface-count anaphora, verbal-phrase anaphora, andtime and/or location references. This paper focuses on the resolution of pronominal andadjectival anaphora.1It is widely agreed that the process of resolving anaphora in natural language textsmay be supported by a variety of strategies that employ di erent kinds of knowledge. Bydi erent kinds of knowledge we mean the various sources of information usually employedfor anaphora resolution, including morphological agreement, syntactic parallelism, semanticinformation, discourse structure, topical knowledge, and so on.Natural language processing (NLP), and, speci cally, anaphora resolution, uses manyresources and sources of information for two reasons: (1) numerous resources are availableto the scienti c community; and (2) humans employ many sources of information in orderto resolve di erent linguistic phenomena.We present an algorithm that coordinates di erent forms of knowledge by distinguishingbetween linguistic knowledge (constraints and preferences) and dialogue-structure knowl-edge (anaphoric accessibility space). The algorithm identi es the noun phrase to which athird-person personal or demonstrative pronoun or adjectival anaphor2 refers in a Span-ish dialogue. We call this algorithm ARDi (anaphora resolution in dialogues). ARDi wasimplemented in Prolog.In Section 2 below, we present related work on anaphora resolution in dialogues. InSection 3, we suggest an annotation scheme for capturing Spanish dialogue structure. InSection 4, an accessibility space based on this annotation scheme is de ned. In Section 5, wepresent the algorithm ARDi. Finally, an experimental study of the algorithm is presentedin Section 6.2. Related work on anaphora resolution in dialoguesFor anaphora resolution in dialogues, a proliferation of methods based on dialogue structure(discourse-oriented approaches) have been developed. Among these, we should like to espe-cially acknowledge the work of Grosz (1977, 1981), in which the in uence of dialogue struc-ture in anaphora resolution is justi ed. Grosz's work focuses speci cally on task-orienteddialogues. Other studies, such as those published by Grosz et al. (1983, 1995), present acentering framework as a model to explain the coherence of local discourse segments inwhich the speaker's focus of attention is related to referring expressions. This model hasachieved successful results in anaphora resolution in monologues, but would require certainmodi cations to be successfully applied to dialogues. Along those lines, Byron and Stent1. We have dealt exclusively with pronominal and adjectival anaphora because they appeared most fre-quently in the dialogues we evaluated, but our algorithm can easily be extended to other kinds ofanaphora.2. A Spanish adjectival anaphor is a kind of English one-anaphora where the word one is omitted. Forexample, el rojo (the red [one]). 264\nComputational Approach to Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Dialogues(1998) have developed extensions of the centering method for application to dialogues. Theyconclude that centering is as consistent in dialogues as it is in monologues.Nevertheless, according to Strube and Hahn (1999), the crucial point of the centeringmodel is the candidate list. Grosz et al. (1995) state that this list may be ordered usingdi erent factors, but they only use information about grammatical roles. However, it isdi cult to de ne grammatical roles in free-word-order languages like German or Spanishwithout using semantic information.3On the other hand, work carried out by Eckert and Strube (1999) on English detailsa method for resolving pronominal anaphora in dialogues with a precision of 66.2% anda recall rate of 68.2%. This method is based on the distribution of dialogue acts as analternative to the centering method.Furthermore, Mart nez-Barco et al. (1999) emphasize the importance of discourse-topicknowledge as a complementary method for anaphora resolution in dialogues in which suchknowledge is necessary for long-distance anaphora resolution.3. An annotation scheme for dialogue structureFor successful anaphora resolution in dialogues, we assume that it is essential to identifydialogue structure. Therefore, we propose an annotation scheme for Spanish dialogues thatis based on work carried out by Gallardo (1996), who applies the theories put forward bySacks et al. (1974) concerning (conversational) turn-taking.We use an annotation scheme based on these theories for three main reasons. First,as it is a general approach to dialogue modeling, it is applicable to all types of dialogues,including both task-oriented and information-retrieval-oriented dialogues. Consequently,the use of such a model as a basis for developing our anaphor resolution procedure allowsus to apply the procedure to any type of domain, thus o ering an advantage over proce-dures based on discourse models speci c to particular domains. Second, this annotationscheme can be easily applied to automatic processes without metalinguistic considerations.Although in our work the annotation task has been performed by hand, for dialogue-basedapplications in which our procedure might be embedded (e.g., in dialogue management sys-tems), annotation tasks must be performed automatically. Finally, we wanted to base ourown procedure on studies of the in uence of dialogue structure on anaphora resolution thatwere carried out by Fox (1987), whose approach, in turn, is based on that of Sacks et al.According to these theories, the basic unit of conversation is the move, which informsthe listener about an action, request, question, etc. Moves are carried out by means ofutterances.4 And utterances are joined together to become turns.Since our work was done using spoken dialogues that had been transcribed, turns areannotated in the texts and utterances are delimited by the use of punctuation marks or bythe ends of turns. Reading a punctuation mark (., ?, !, ...) allows us to recognize the endof an utterance. These tasks do not a ect the anaphora-resolution process.3. A possible grammatical role de nition in free-word-order languages, e.g., subject, direct object, etc.,can be recovered to a large extent by inspecting NP-verb agreement, NP-clitic agreement, and case orprepositional markers. This task requires adding word-order heuristics to the parser.4. An utterance in a dialogue is equivalent to a sentence in a non-dialogue, although, because of the lackof punctuation marks, utterances are recognized by means of speakers' pauses.265\nPalomar & Mart nez-BarcoAs a result, we propose the following annotation scheme for dialogue structure:Turn (T) is identi ed by a change of speaker in the dialogue; each change of speakerpresupposes a new turn. On this point, we make a distinction between two di erentkinds of turns: An intervention turn (IT) is one that adds information to the dialogue. Suchturns constitute what is called the primary system of conversation. Speakersuse their interventions to provide information that facilitates the progress ofthe topic of conversation. Interventions may be initiatives (ITI) when theyformulate invitations, requirements, o ers, reports, etc., or reactions (ITR)when they answer or evaluate the previous speaker s intervention. Finally, theycan also be mixed interventions (ITR=I), which is a reaction that begins as aresponse to the previous speaker's intervention, and ends as an introduction ofnew information. A continuing turn (CT) represents an empty turn, which is quite typical ofa listener whose aim is the formal reinforcement and rati cation of the cast ofconversational roles. Such interventions lack information.Adjacency pair (AP) (also called exchange) is a sequence of turns headed by aninitiation intervention turn (ITI) and ended by a reaction intervention turn (ITR).This form of anaphora, in which the reference appears within an adjacency pair,appears to be very common in dialogues (Fox, 1987).Topic (TOPIC). The topic must be a lexical item that is referred to frequently. Accordingto Rocha (1998), four features are taken into account in the selection of the bestcandidate for a discourse topic: frequency, even distribution, position of rst token,and semantic adequacy. A highly frequent element that occurs intensively in a passageof the dialogue but does not appear for long stretches is not likely to be a good choicefor discourse topic. In the same way, neither is an element whose rst appearanceoccurs a long way from the beginning the best choice. Moreover, semantic adequacymust be considered for the candidate, and it must be assessed by the annotator.Based on the above-mentioned structure, then, the following tags are considered nec-essary for dialogue structure annotation: ITI , ITR, CT, AP, and TOPIC. The AP andTOPIC tags will be used to de ne the anaphoric accessibility space, and the remaining tagswill be used to obtain the adjacency pairs. The ITR=I tag, representing mixed interventions,is not included since mixed interventions can be annotated as ITR plus ITI . This task isdone in the annotation phase.An example of an annotated dialogue with tags is presented in Figure 1. In the dialogue,the identi er (OP) indicates the turn of a railway company employee, and the identi er (US)indicates the client's turn.One of the most important advantages of this annotation scheme is its compatibility withmost of the dialogue-annotation schemes used in dialogue systems. Notice, for instance, thatthe adjacency pairs show the same structure as the conversational game applied to task-oriented dialogues de ned in the dialogue structure by Carletta et al. (1997). Moreover, our266"

DAMSL indicates how utterances are relatedto the discourse by means of forward- and backward-looking functions. The interpretationof these functions builds the adjacency-pair structure. Finally, our topic structure exhibitsthe same features as the transaction structure of Carletta et al. or the task level de ned byAllen and Core.4. Accessibility space proposalBased upon the above-mentioned annotation, an anaphoric accessibility space is proposedfor Spanish in order to resolve anaphors in the form of personal pronouns, demonstrativepronouns, and adjectival anaphors.4.1 DescriptionAccording to Fox (1987), the rst mention of a referent in a sequence of contexts is per-formed with a full noun phrase. After that, by using an anaphor the speaker displays anunderstanding that sequence has not been closed down. We assert that two di erent se-quences generate most of the anaphors to be found in dialogues: the adjacency pair andthe topic scope. The former generates references to any local noun phrase, and the lattergenerates references to the main topic of the dialogue.Based on this, we propose that the anaphoric accessibility space for any given anaphormay be de ned as the set of noun phrases taken from: the adjacency pair containing the anaphor, plus the adjacency pair preceding the adjacency pair containing the anaphor, plus any adjacency pair including the adjacency pair containing the anaphor, plus the noun phrase representing the main topic of the dialogue.4.2 An automatic topic detection proposalSeveral works about automatic topic detection have been published|Reynar (1999), You-mans (1991) or Hearst (1994)|. In Mart nez-Barco et al. (1999) an automatic topic detec-tion algorithm as applied to anaphora resolution is presented.This algorithm selects noun phrases (NP) occurring before an anaphor. These NPs areincluded in a list that is then weighted. Each time the NP appears in a new turn (frequency),its weight is increased, and each time the NP does not appear in a new turn (infrequency),its weight is decreased. According to this algorithm, the dialogue topic may be determinedby its salience, i.e., by determining the NP with the heaviest weight (high frequency in ashort distance) occurring before an anaphor. In order to obtain this information (weight),the algorithm uses the following two coe cients: Cf : coe cient of frequency Ci: coe cient of infrequency 268\nComputational Approach to Anaphora Resolution in Spanish DialoguesCf increases the salience of a referring expression when the entity appears in the currentintervention turn. Ci decreases the salience of expressions that appeared in previous inter-vention turns but not in the current one, indicating a loss of importance. Both coe cientsobviously a ect the salience of expressions in re ecting their frequency and their distancefrom the current intervention turn where the anaphor has been found. The expression withthe highest salience will be the most favored candidate antecedent on the whole list andtherefore the most relevant topic for the current intervention turn.This automatic topic detection method has the following advantage over other methods:it does not obtain a single topic, but rather a list of topic candidates ordered by salience.That is important for our anaphora resolution system because, if the highest-ranked candi-date does not ful ll the relevant constraints, then the next highest candidate can be tested.Initially, values of 10 units and 1 unit, respectively, were assigned to Cf and Ci. Thesevalues were arrived at experimentally, but further study could lead to more precise values.5. Anaphora resolution in Spanish dialoguesIn this section, the anaphora resolution algorithm based on a constraint and preferenceapproach is presented.5.1 Constraints and preferences as an approach to anaphora resolutionAccording to Dahlb ack (1991), there are at present two basic approaches in anaphora res-olution: (1) the traditional approach, which generally depends upon linguistic knowledge,and (2) the discourse-oriented approach, in which the researcher tries to model complexdiscourse structures and then uses these structures to resolve anaphora.Among the traditional approaches, the work of Mitkov (1998), Baldwin (1997), andFerr andez et al. (1999) are all based on a combination of linguistic knowledge (lexical, mor-phological, syntactic, and/or semantic) for the resolution of anaphora. These approachesapply linguistic knowledge, in the way of constraints and preferences, following the workof Carbonell and Brown (1988) and Rich and LuperFoy (1988), in which such systems areproposed as a technique for combining several information sources.These approaches are based, intuitively, on the following three steps: (1) de ning ananaphoric accessibility space, (2) applying constraints, and (3) applying preferences.A constraint and preference system must de ne, on the one hand, the anaphoric acces-sibility space. That is, it must obtain a list with all the possible candidate antecedents. Onthe other hand, the system must also de ne the text segments in which the antecedent canbe found. This step has a great importance for the remaining steps in the process becausea de nition of the anaphoric accessibility space that is too narrow results in the exclusionof valid antecedents. Likewise, a de nition of the anaphoric accessibility space that is toobroad results in large candidate lists, with a corresponding increase in the likelihood oferroneous anaphora resolution. Usually, anaphora resolution systems based on linguisticknowledge (Ferr andez et al., 1999) de ne an accessibility space using n previous sentencesto the anaphor, where n is variable according to the kind of the anaphora.Once the list of possible candidates is de ned, several constraints are applied in order toremove incompatible antecedents. The constraint system consists of conditions that mustbe met, and candidates that do not ful ll these conditions will not be considered possible269\nPalomar & Mart nez-Barcoantecedents for the anaphor. Lexical, morphological, syntactical, and semantic informationare traditionally used to de ne the constraints.Finally, after removing incompatible candidates, if the remaining list contains morethan one antecedent, preferences are applied in order to choose a single antecedent. In thiscase, unlike that of constraints, preferences are associated with likelihood lower than 100%.Candidates ful lling a preference, then, have a greater likelihood of being the antecedentthan those not ful lling it. The preference system must be designed bearing in mind thatonly one candidate must remain at the end. This nal candidate will be proposed as theantecedent for the anaphor. Lexical, morphological, syntactic, and semantic informationare usually used in order to de ne the preference system.The works of Mitkov (1998) and Ferr andez et al. (1999) show that anaphora resolutionsystems based on constraints and preferences can yield successful results when appliedto non-dialogue texts. However, these works lack adequate proposals for the anaphoricaccessibility space. Furthermore, these approaches lack consistency in the treatment ofother kinds of texts, for example, dialogues.5.2 The anaphora resolution algorithm (ARDi)In this section, the intuitive algorithm for anaphora resolution in spoken dialogue systems(ARDi) is presented. ARDi operates with syntactic information provided by the SUPPpartial parser (Ferr andez, Palomar, & Moreno, 1998). SUPP is based on a partial repre-sentation of slot uni cation grammar analysis (Ferr andez et al., 1999). This partial repre-sentation gives some of the utterance constituents, such as NPs, PPs, verbal chunks, andpartial information about subordinated clauses. Thus, ARDi combines two kinds of knowl-edge about dialogues: (1) linguistic knowledge, such as lexical, morphological, and syntacticknowledge; and (2) knowledge about the dialogue's structure itself, which is based on theannotation of adjacency pairs5 and knowledge about the topic of the dialogue (manuallyannotated). Figure 2 shows the anaphora resolution procedure.ARDi is based, intuitively, on the following three steps:1. Obtain all possible antecedents from dialogue structure and topic as follows:(a) take those NPs that are included in the same adjacency pair (AP) as the anaphor,and(b) take those NPs that are included in the previous AP to that containing theanaphor, and(c) take those NPs that are included in the most recent unclosed AP containing theAP containing the anaphor, and(d) take the topic of the dialogue2. Discard incompatible antecedents by applying linguistic constraints, as follows:(a) for pronominal anaphora:5. The use of adjacency pairs as dialogue units for anaphora resolution is based on the work of Sackset al. (1974), in which they suggest that one form of anaphora which appears to be very common indialogues is reference within an adjacency pair. 270"

These dialogues are conversations between a railway company employee and a client.The transcriptor used in the Basurde Project provides turn and speaker markup.

These 204 dialogues contain 345 pronominalanaphors and 257 adjectival anaphors.We had two aims in using the training corpus: (1) to estimate the importance of thestructural anaphoric accessibility space, and (2) to de ne an adequate set of constraintsand preferences (experiments 0, 1, 2, and 3). The test corpus was reserved to obtain the nal evaluation.In addition, the entire corpus was manually annotated with two di erent goals: (1) toidentify further discourse structural properties such as adjacency pairs and topics, and (2) toidentify anaphors and antecedents. Although we annotated the corpus manually, there are atpresent some automatic systems for performing adjacency pair tagging (the Basurde Project(Basurde Project, 1998), for example), as well as for automatic topic tagging (Reynar, 1999)or automatic topic extraction (see the method for anaphora resolution described in Section4). The annotation of conversational structure was carried out as described in the nextparagraph. An important aspect of dialogue structure annotation is the training phase,which assures reliability among annotators.The annotation phase was accomplished as follows: (1) two annotators were selected,(2) an agreement7 was reached between the two annotators with regard to the annotationscheme using a training corpus, (3) the annotation was then carried out by both annotatorsin parallel over the test corpus, and (4) a reliability study was carried out on the annotation(Carletta et al. 1997). The reliability study used the kappa statistic that measures the a n-7. This agreement is about what every tag means to every annotator when it is applied to the corpus.273\nPalomar & Mart nez-Barcoity between the annotations of the two annotators by making judgments about categories.For computing the kappa (k) statistic, see Siegel and Castellan (1988).8Because turns are marked during the transcription phase, the annotator merely classi esturns according to the turn types described in Section 3 and then relates each initiativeintervention ITI to its reaction intervention ITR, thereby de ning adjacency pairs. Sincethis task simply requires classi cation, it is easily measured using the kappa statistic.Concurrently, topics were identi ed. This task was also simple, since the corpus usedfor these experiments is organized into short dialogues and each dialogue has only one maintopic or theme, and since these are introduced clearly by means of the client's interventionat the beginning of each dialogue. As a result, we detected no discrepancies between an-notators with regard to the topic identi cation. Therefore, there was no need to measurethis task using the kappa statistic.According to Carletta et al., a k measurement between 0:68 and 0:80 allows us to makepositive conclusions, and if k is greater than 0:80, we have total reliability between theresults of the annotators.In those cases where a discrepancy was found between the annotators, the followingcriterion was applied: each dialogue was assigned a main annotator whose annotation wasconsidered de nitive in the event that there were discrepancies between the two accounts.In order to guarantee balance, each annotator was the main annotator for exactly 50% ofthe dialogues.Once both annotators had nished the annotation, the reliability study was carried out,with a resultant kappa measurement of k = 0:91. We therefore consider the annotationobtained for the evaluation to be totally reliable.Since the annotated texts would be processed by an anaphora resolution system, wedeveloped an SGML tagging format.Generally, this SGML markup will have the following form:<ELEMENT-NAME ATTRIBUTE-NAME=\"VALUE\" ...> text-string </ELEMENT-NAME>Thus, the following notations are used in each case: Topic:<TOPIC> Topic-entity </TOPIC> Adjacency pairs:<AP ID=\"number\"> Adjacency-pair </AP>where ID is an identi cation number used to arrange the adjacency pairs in sequentialorder Intervention turns:<IT TYPE=\"R|I\" SPEAKER=\"speaker\"> Intervention-turn </IT>8.

In order to guarantee the results,this annotation was performed by two di erent annotators in parallel and a reliability studyof the subsequent annotation was then carried out. Once again, the annotation was treatedas a classi cation task, consisting of selecting the appropriate elements in the candidatelist (we estimated an average of 6.5 possible antecedents per anaphor after applying con-straints). The reliability study of the manual anaphoric annotation resulted in a kappameasurement of k = 0:87.In addition, the corpus was tagged using the POS tagger technique described by Pla andPrieto (1998). From this, we obtained morphological and lexical information. The corpuswas then parsed using the SUPP partial parser proposed by Mart nez-Barco et al. (1998) inorder to obtain syntactic information. Finally, the proposed anaphora resolution algorithmwas applied. 275\nPalomar & Mart nez-BarcoSame APa Previous APb Included APc TOPICd ElsewhereePronominal 60.6% 24.6% 8.2% 4.9% 1.7%Adjectival 44.7% 28.9% 5.2% 13.4% 7.8%Total Results Anaphoric accessibility space proposed: 95.9% 4.1%(pronominal: 98.3%, adjectival: 92.2%)a.

The antecedent is found elsewhereTable 1: Structural anaphoric accessibility space resultsSeveral studies were then carried out in order to identify the importance of de ning anadequate anaphoric accessibility space and of de ning a constraint and preference systembased on this space. In these studies, we compared the output of the anaphora resolutionsystem with the manual annotation and generated several statistical results.6.2 Importance of the anaphoric accessibility spaceIn order to show the importance of de ning an adequate anaphoric accessibility space, astudy of the location of the antecedent of each pronominal and adjectival anaphora wasdone using the training corpus. The results are given in Table 1.9As can be seen in the table, 95.9% of the antecedents were located in the proposed struc-tural anaphoric accessibility space. It is estimated that the remaining antecedents (4.1%)are located in the subtopics of the dialogues.10 In order to incorporate these remainingantecedents into the anaphoric accessibility space, one might employ a strategy that usesthe full space (i.e., all the noun phrases from the beginning of the dialogue to the anaphormight be used). However, as shown in Table 2, our proposal for the anaphoric accessibilityspace (hereafter referred to as structural), reduces the average number of candidates peranaphor (before applying constraints) to 10.74 from the 34.14 that would be obtained ifthe full space approach were adopted. In others words, using the full space approachwould increase the number of possible candidates by a factor of three, thereby greatly in-creasing both the required computational e ort and the possibility of selecting incorrectantecedents. Notice, too, that these experiments were performed over a collection of shortdialogues (around 332 words per dialogue). These problems will be even more acute inlonger dialogues.Other researchers have proposed using a window with a xed number of sentences tode ne the anaphoric accessibility space. This type of approach might be called awindow ofsentences approach. For example, Ferr andez et al. (1999) propose using the three previoussentences to de ne the accessibility space for pronouns and the four previous sentences foradjectival anaphora in Spanish. For English, Kameyama (1997) proposes the same space forthe pronominal. However, there is no structural justi cation for these de nitions. Ferr andez9. Notice that the study of the anaphoric accessibility space was not carried out using output from the au-tomatic anaphora resolution system but rather from the manual annotations (i.e., the correct solutions).10. By subtopic, we mean an NP that is not the main topic of the dialogue but contributes to de ning it.276\nComputational Approach to Anaphora Resolution in Spanish DialoguesAnaphoric accessibility space Structural Full space Window of utterancesTotal candidates 1,063 3,380 1,292Candidates per anaphor 10.74 34.14 13.05Proportion 100% 318% 122%Table 2: Candidates to be processed for each anaphoric accessibility spaceet al. and Kameyama performed several empirical studies to show the optimal space for eachexperiment. Table 3 below shows the results of a study which we performed using the CorpusInfotren: Person, the goal of which was to de ne an anaphoric accessibility space based ona window of sentences that can then be adapted to dialogues by means of a window ofutterances. As the table shows, 11 utterances for pronominal anaphora and 10 utterancesfor adjectival anaphora are needed in order to cover the same number of antecedents aswas covered using the structural anaphoric accessibility space (which was de ned based onadjacency pairs and the topic). Since the anaphoric space using a window of utterancesis not based on any principle, but rather on empirical studies, it may vary from one textto another and therefore is inadequate. Moreover, the structural anaphoric accessibilityspace can cover only those cases that refer to NPs introduced at the outset of the dialogue(topics), not those with a window of sentences/utterances approach.In conclusion, it would appear that the structural anaphoric accessibility space is tobe preferred, at least for anaphora resolution in dialogues.Window of utterance: % pronominal % adjectival\\From Anaphor's anaphora anaphorautterance to\": antecedents antecedentsAnaphor's utterance 37.7 18.4-1 54.1 44.7-2 70.5 52.6-3 77.0 55.3-4 80.3 57.9-5 83.6 71.0-6 88.5 73.7-7 91.8 76.3-8 91.8 81.6-9 95.1 81.6-10 96.7 92.1-11 98.4 94.7-12 98.4 97.4-13 98.4 97.4-14 100.0 100.0Table 3: Empirical study of anaphoric accessibility space based on a window of utterances277\nPalomar & Mart nez-BarcoUsed preferences PrecisionExperiment Pronominal anaphoraNo. 1 2 2a 2b 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 %0 59.01 62.32 73.83a 81.3Experiment Adjectival anaphoraNo. 1 2 2a 2b 3 4 5 6 7 8 %0 23.71 65.82 78.93b 81.5a. Preference weighted managementb. Preference weighted managementTable 4: Experiment summary6.3 Constraint and preference setAs for the importance of de ning an adequate constraint and preference set based on di-alogue structure using the accessibility space de ned in Section 4, we begin by adoptingthe constraint and preference set developed by Ferr andez et al. (1999) and described be-low in Section 6.4. This constraint and preference set has been shown to be adequate forpronominal and adjectival anaphora in non-dialogue discourse. To this set, informationabout dialogue structure will be applied in order to take advantage of its in uence. Notonly is dialogue structure used to de ne the anaphoric accessibility space, but it is used tode ne preferences as well.For this study, several experiments were carried out using the training corpus. Theseexperiments involved changes in the constraint and preference set in order to de ne thecon guration11 that would have optimum precision. Results are summarized in Table 4.6.3.1 Preference managementThere are two di erent approaches to managing the preference set, ordered managementand weighted management. Ordered management is based on discarding those antecedentsthat do not ful ll a preference if there is any candidate that ful lls it. Weighted managementis based on assigning a weight to each preference and then selecting the candidate with themaximum value.For these experiments, the system was trained so as to obtain the best set of preferences.Subsequently, we applied both of the approaches to preference management to obtain thebest result with the training corpus. Once we obtained the best set of preferences and11. The term con guration is used here to de ne the set of constraints and preferences that makes up thesystem used for a concrete instance of the experimental process.278\nComputational Approach to Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Dialoguesits best management, we evaluated the system with the test corpus in order to obtainindependent results.So, for experiments 0, 1, and 2, ordered management was applied to obtain the best setof preferences. Then, in experiment 3, we applied weighted management to improve theresults in the training corpus.6.4 Experiment 0 (baseline): Linguistic information onlyWe began with the constraint and preference set used by Ferr andez et al. (1999). Thisalgorithm is based on linguistic information only, and its results have been successfullytested over a non-dialogue corpus with a resulting precision of 82% for pronominal anaphoraresolution (we have no information about the precision for adjectival anaphora).The initial con guration included the following constraint and preference set and de -nition of anaphoric accessibility space.6.4.1 Anaphoric accessibility spaceFor pronominal anaphora resolution, the anaphoric accessibility space consisted of the threeprevious turns to the anaphor. For adjectival anaphora, the space consisted of the previousfour turns.6.4.2 Constraints In the case of pronominal anaphora, the constraints included:1. morphological agreement: discard the antecedents which are incompatible mor-phologically (gender, number, and person)2. syntactic context: discard the antecedents which are non-co-referent accordingto Lappin and Leass (1994) In the case of adjectival anaphora, the constraints included:1. morphological agreement: discard the antecedents which are incompatible mor-phologically (gender)2. Proper-noun-phrase exclusion: exclude noun phrases having a proper noun12 ashead6.4.3 Preferences In the case of pronominal anaphora, the preferences are for:1. candidates in the same turn as that of the anaphor2. candidates in the previous turn3. candidate proper nouns or inde nite NPs12. Proper nouns are not usually modi ed by adjectives. Thus, noun phrases having a proper noun as headare not likely candidates as antecedents of adjectival anaphors.279\nPalomar & Mart nez-Barco4. (for personal pronouns) candidate proper nouns5. candidates that have been repeated more than once (repeated forms and repeatedmentions)6. candidates that have appeared more than once in construction with the verb inconstruction with the anaphor7. candidates in the same position as the anaphor with reference to the verb (beforeor after)8. candidates in the same position with reference to the utterance as the anaphor9. candidates not in circumstantial adjuncts10. candidates most repeated in the text11. candidates most often appearing in construction with the verb in constructionwith the anaphor12. the closest candidate to the anaphor In the case of adjectival anaphora, the preferences are for:1. candidates in the same turn as that of the anaphor2. candidates in the previous turn3. candidates sharing the same kind of modi er as the anaphor (e.g., a prepositionalphrase)4. candidates sharing the same modi er as the anaphor (e.g., the same adjective:'roja' red)5. candidates agreeing in number6. candidates most often repeated in the text7. candidates appearing most often in construction with the verb in constructionwith the anaphor8. the closest candidate to the anaphor6.4.4 DiscussionGiven this rst con guration, an evaluation was carried out which resulted in a precisionof 59.0% for pronominal anaphora resolution and 23.7% for adjectival anaphora resolution.Needless to say, these results are very low for pronominal anaphora and extremely poorfor adjectival anaphora. In evaluating the errors, we concluded that the de ned anaphoricaccessibility space was too constrained and too arbitrarily de ned. It simply disregardedthe relationship between anaphora and dialogue structure. Consequently, we proposed thefollowing changes for the second experiment.6.5 Experiment 1: Dialogue structure information onlyFor this experiment, the de nition of the anaphoric accessibility space was changed to em-ploy information provided by the dialogue structure, as suggested by Mart nez-Barco (1999).In addition, the preferences a ected by this revised de nition of anaphoric accessibility spacewere modi ed as well. 280\nComputational Approach to Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Dialogues6.5.1 Anaphoric accessibility spaceThe adjacency pair and the topic of the dialogue were used in order to de ne the anaphoricaccessibility space. Concretely, we de ned an anaphoric accessibility space by means of theadjacency pair of the anaphor, the previous adjacency pair to the adjacency pair of theanaphor, adjacency pairs containing the adjacency pair of the anaphor, and, nally, themain topic of the dialogue (for pronominal as well as adjectival anaphora).6.5.2 PreferencesFor Experiment 1, we removed the pronominal anaphora preferences described above initems 3 through 11 and the adjectival anaphora preferences described in items 3 through 7.Also, preferences 1 and 2 above were replaced by the following four new preferences. Thus,both for pronominal and adjectival anaphora, the preferences are for: 1. candidates in the same adjacency pair as that of the anaphor 2. candidates in the previous adjacency pair to the anaphor 2a. candidates in any adjacency pair containing the adjacency pair of the anaphor 2b. candidates that are in the topicThis change was made in order to test the system's performance when linguistic infor-mation is removed and only dialogue structure information is used (preferences 1 through2b). In order to guarantee a single nal solution, only linguistic preference item 12, forpronominal anaphora, and item 8, for adjectival anaphora (the closest candidate), remain.6.5.3 DiscussionAfter including information about dialogue structure and removing the linguistic prefer-ences, precision rates rose to 62.3% for pronominal anaphora resolution and 65.8% foradjectival anaphora resolution. A considerable increase is gained in the resolution of adjec-tival anaphora by simply changing the de nition of the accessibility space. That is due tothe fact that adjectival anaphora need a larger space than that used in Experiment 0.But these results are still low and demonstrate that dialogue structure information aloneis not su cient. Thus, a third experiment was carried out using both dialogue structureand linguistic information. Several variations in the preference system were investigatedindependently.6.6 Experiment 2: Linguistic information plus dialogue structure information(with ordered management of preferences)Following, the preferences used in this experiment and their justi cation are shown.6.6.1 PreferencesIn this experiment, we rst used a preference set that included all the linguistic and dialoguestructure preferences described above. Then, various alternatives were used in order to281\nPalomar & Mart nez-Barcoobtain an optimal con guration. As a result, the following preferences were arrived at forthe nal con guration: For pronominal anaphora, the preferences are for:{ dialogue structure preferences: 1 through 2b{ linguistic preferences: 6, 7, 8, and 12 For adjectival anaphora, the preferences are for:{ dialogue structure preferences: 1 through 2b{ linguistic preferences: 3, 4, 5, and 8This nal set of constraints and preferences is the one that is presented in Section 5.2.6.6.2 Discussion and justificationIt should be noted that information about repeated candidates|for example, the pronom-inal anaphora preferences 5, 10, and 11, or the adjectival anaphora preferences 6 and 7|isusually inserted into the preference system in order to achieve knowledge about the mainentities of the dialogue. However, in this experiment, information about the main topic ofthe dialogue has been included and so information about repeated candidates is unnecessary.Those preferences were therefore removed, improving the results.Furthermore, we found that pronominal anaphora preferences 3 and 4 for proper nounscaused errors. This is because in the domain of the experiment there is an exaggerated useof place names where these preferences incorrectly apply. By removing them, better resultswere obtained.Finally, since the usefulness of preference 9 (candidates that are not in circumstantialadjunct) has never been justi ed properly, it too was omitted. After removal, the precisionfor pronominal anaphora stayed the same.Thus, having considered all possible applications for ordered preference management,and given that this nal set of preferences represented the minimum set of preferences, weconsidered it to be the optimal set. We then applied this optimal set of preferences tothe training corpus, obtaining a precision of 73.8% for pronominal anaphora resolution and78.9% for adjectival anaphora.6.7 Experiment 3: Linguistic information plus dialogue structure information(with weighted management of preferences)Following, the preferences used in this experiment and their justi cation are shown.6.7.1 PreferencesIn this nal experiment, the preference set obtained in the previous experiment was used(including the minimum set of preferences that we considered to be the optimal con gura-tion). Then, several alternatives were used in order to obtain an optimal preference weightassignment. Tables 5 and 6 show the preference weight assignments for pronominal andadjectival anaphora, respectively.This nal set of constraints and preferences was presented in Section 5.2.282"

With this con guration, we obtained a precision of 80.3% for pronominalanaphora resolution and 92.1% for adjectival anaphora resolution.6.8 Final evaluation (test corpus)Using the nal preference set de ned in Experiment 3 and the proposed constraint set, ablind evaluation was carried out over the entire test corpus. This evaluation was performedindependent of the training process so as to guarantee that the training would have noin uence over the nal percentages.As a result, we obtained a precision of 81.3% for pronominal anaphora resolution and81.5% for adjectival anaphora resolution.7. ConclusionIn this paper we have presented an algorithm for identifying the noun phrase antecedentsof pronouns and adjectival anaphors in Spanish dialogues. This algorithm exploits di erentkinds of information: linguistic knowledge, discourse/dialogue structure information, anddiscourse topic knowledge. It is based on a set of constraints and preferences which dependon all available knowledge in order to resolve anaphora.In addition, a de nition of the anaphoric accessibility space based on discourse/dialoguestructure information was presented. We have shown the importance of this accessibilityspace in anaphora resolution, in contrast to algorithms that do not rely on any such space.Results show that 95.9% of the antecedents were located in the proposed space.Finally, we described a set of experiments concerning this algorithm and accessibilityspace using a corpus of 204 dialogues. The algorithm was implemented using Prolog. Inour nal experiment, a precision of 81.3% was achieved for pronominal anaphora resolutionand a precision of 81.5% was achieved for adjectival anaphora resolution.As a tool for resolving pronominal and adjectival anaphora for Spanish dialogues, thissystem can be used in support of various NLP tasks, including machine translation, infor-mation extraction, retrieval information, or question-answering.Currently, the authors are working on incorporating semantic information into the al-gorithm.AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to thank Natividad Prieto, Ferran Pla, and Antonio Molina for havingcontributed their tagger; Lidia Moreno for her helpful revisions of the ideas presented inthis paper; and Rafael Mu~noz, Maximiliano Saiz-Noeda, Antonio Ferr andez, and Jes usPeral for their collaboration in performing the experiments.

First, as it is a general approach to dialogue modeling, it is applicable to all types of dialogues, including both task-oriented and information-retrieval-oriented dialogues. Consequently, the use of such a model as a basis for developing our anaphor resolution procedure allows us to apply the procedure to any type of domain, thus o ering an advantage over procedures based on discourse models speci c to particular domains. Second, this annotation scheme can be easily applied to automatic processes without metalinguistic considerations. Although in our work the annotation task has been performed by hand, for dialogue-based applications in which our procedure might be embedded (e.g., in dialogue management systems), annotation tasks must be performed automatically. Finally, we wanted to base our own procedure on studies of the in uence of dialogue structure on anaphora resolution that were carried out by Fox (1987), whose approach, in turn, is based on that of Sacks et al.",

Furthermore, these approaches lack consistency in the treatment of other kinds of texts, for example, dialogues. 5.2 The anaphora resolution algorithm (ARDi) In this section, the intuitive algorithm for anaphora resolution in spoken dialogue systems (ARDi) is presented. ARDi operates with syntactic information provided by the SUPP partial parser (Ferr andez, Palomar, & Moreno, 1998). SUPP is based on a partial representation of slot uni cation grammar analysis (Ferr andez et al., 1999). This partial representation gives some of the utterance constituents, such as NPs, PPs, verbal chunks, and partial information about subordinated clauses. Thus, ARDi combines two kinds of knowledge about dialogues: (1) linguistic knowledge, such as lexical, morphological, and syntactic knowledge; and (2) knowledge about the dialogue's structure itself, which is based on the annotation of adjacency pairs5 and knowledge about the topic of the dialogue (manually annotated). Figure 2 shows the anaphora resolution procedure. ARDi is based, intuitively, on the following three steps: 1. Obtain all possible antecedents from dialogue structure and topic as follows: (a) take those NPs that are included in the same adjacency pair (AP) as the anaphor, and (b) take those NPs that are included in the previous AP to that containing the anaphor, and (c) take those NPs that are included in the most recent unclosed AP containing the AP containing the anaphor, and (d) take the topic of the dialogue 2. Discard incompatible antecedents by applying linguistic constraints, as follows: (a) for pronominal anaphora: 5. The use of adjacency pairs as dialogue units for anaphora resolution is based on the work of Sacks et al. (1974), in which they suggest that one form of anaphora which appears to be very common in dialogues is reference within an adjacency pair.",

For adjectival anaphora, the space consisted of the previous four turns. 6.4.2 Constraints In the case of pronominal anaphora, the constraints included: 1. morphological agreement: discard the antecedents which are incompatible morphologically (gender, number, and person) 2. syntactic context: discard the antecedents which are non-co-referent according to Lappin and Leass (1994) In the case of adjectival anaphora, the constraints included: 1.",

Needless to say, these results are very low for pronominal anaphora and extremely poor for adjectival anaphora. In evaluating the errors, we concluded that the de ned anaphoric accessibility space was too constrained and too arbitrarily de ned. It simply disregarded the relationship between anaphora and dialogue structure. Consequently, we proposed the following changes for the second experiment. 6.5 Experiment 1: Dialogue structure information only For this experiment, the de nition of the anaphoric accessibility space was changed to employ information provided by the dialogue structure, as suggested by Mart nez-Barco (1999). In addition, the preferences a ected by this revised de nition of anaphoric accessibility space were modi ed as well.",
