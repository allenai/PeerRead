      "text" : "The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier is one of the simplest and most common classifiers, yet its performance competes with the most complex classifiers in the literature. The core of this classifier depends mainly on measuring the distance or similarity between the tested example and the training examples. This raises a major question about which distance measures to be used for the KNN classifier among a large number of distance and similarity measures? This review attempts to answer the previous question through evaluating the performance (measured by accuracy, precision and recall) of the KNN using a large number of distance measures, tested on a number of real world datasets, with and without adding different levels of noise. The experimental results show that the performance of KNN classifier depends significantly on the distance used, the results showed large gaps between the performances of different distances. We found that a recently proposed non-convex distance performed the best when applied on most datasets comparing to the other tested distances. In addition, the performance of the KNN degraded only about 20% while the noise level reaches 90%, this is true for all the distances used. This means that the KNN classifier using any of the top 10 distances tolerate noise to a certain degree. Moreover, the results show that some distances are less affected by the added noise comparing to other distances.\nKeywords: K-nearest neighrbor, classification, distance, similarity, review"

KNN was proposed in 1951 by Fix & Hodges (1951), and then modified by Cover & Hart (1967). KNN has been identified as one of the top ten methods in data mining (Wu et al., 2008). Consequently, KNN has been studied over the past few decades and widely applied in many fields (Bhatia & Vandana, 2010). Thus, KNN comprises the baseline classifier in many pattern classification problems such as pattern recognition (Xu & Wu, 2008), text categorization (Manne, Kotha, & Fatima, 2012), ranking models (Xiubo et al., 2008), object recognition (Bajramovic et al., 2006), and event recognition (Yang et al., 2000) applications. KNN is a non-parametric algorithm Kataria & Singh (2013). Non-Parametric means either there are no parameters or fixed number of parameters irrespective of size of data. Instead, parameters would be determined by the size of the training dataset. While there are no assumptions that need to be made to the underlying data distribution. Thus, KNN could be the best choice for any classification study that involves a little or no prior knowledge about the distribution of the data. In addition, KNN is one of the lazy learning methods. This implies storing all training data and waits until having the test data produced, without having to create a learning model Wettschereck, Aha, & John (1997)."

      "text" : "Several studies have been conducted to analyze the performance of KNN classifier using different distance measures. Each study was applied on various kinds of datasets with different distributions, types of data and using different numbers of distance and similarity measures.\nChomboon and co-workers (Chomboon et al., 2015) analyzed the performance of KNN classifier using 11 distance measures. These include Euclidean, Mahalanobis, Manhattan, Minkowski, Chebychev, Cosine, Correlation, Hamming, Jaccard, Standardized Euclidean and Spearman distances. Their experiment had been applied on eight binary synthetic datasets with various kinds of distributions that were generated using MATLAB. They divided each dataset into 70% for training set and 30% for the testing set. The results showed that the Manhattan, Minkowski, Chebychev, Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and Standardized Euclidean distance measures achieved similar accuracy results and outperformed other tested distances.\nPunam & Nitin (2015) evaluated the performance of KNN classifier using Chebychev, Euclidean, Manhattan, distance measures on KDD dataset (Tavallaee et al., 2009). The KDD dataset contains 41 features and two classes which type of data is numeric. The dataset was normalized before conducting the experiment. To evaluate the performance of KNN, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity measures were calculated for each distance. The reported results indicate that the use of Manhattan distance outperform the other tested distances, with 97.8% accuracy rate, 96.76% sensitivity rate and 98.35% Specificity rate.\nHu et al. (2016) analyzed the effect of distance measures on KNN classifier for medical domain datasets. Their experiments were based on three different types of medical datasets containing categorical, numerical, and mixed types of\ndata, which were chosen from the UCI machine learning repository, and four distance metrics including Euclidean, Cosine, Chi square, and Minkowsky distances. They divided each dataset into 90% of data as training and 10% as testing set, with k values from ranging from 1 to 15. The experimental results showed that Chi square distance function was the best choice for the three different types of datasets. However, using the Cosine, Euclidean and Minkowsky distance metrics performed the ‘worst’ over the mixed type of datasets. The ‘worst’ performance means the method with the lowest accuracy.\nTodeschini, Ballabio, & Consonni (2015); Todeschini et al. (2016) analyzed the effect of eighteen different distance measures on the performance of KNN classifier using eight benchmark datasets. The investigated distance measures included Manhattan, Euclidean, Soergel, Lance–Williams, contracted Jaccard– Tanimoto, Jaccard–Tanimoto, Bhattacharyya, Lagrange, Mahalanobis, Canberra, Wave-Edge, Clark, Cosine, Correlation and four Locally centered Mahalanobis distances. For evaluating the performance of these distances, the non-error rate and average rank were calculated for each distance. The result indicated that the ‘best’ performance were the Manhattan, Euclidean, Soergel, Contracted Jaccard–Tanimoto and Lance–Williams distance measures. The ‘best’ performance means the method with the highest accuracy.\nLopes & Ribeiro (2015) analyzed the impact of five distance metrics, namely Euclidean, Manhattan, Canberra, Chebychev and Minkowsky in instance-based learning algorithms. Particularly, 1-NN Classifier and the Incremental Hypersphere Classifier (IHC) Classifier, they reported the results of their empirical evaluation on fifteen datasets with different sizes showing that the Euclidean and Manhattan metrics significantly yield good results comparing to the other tested distances.\nAlkasassbeh, Altarawneh, & Hassanat (2015) investigated the effect of Euclidean, Manhattan and Hassanat (Hassanat, 2014) distance metrics on the performance of the KNN classifier, with K ranging from 1 to the square root of the size of the training set, considering only the odd K’s. In addition to experimenting on other classifiers such as the Ensemble Nearest Neighbor classifier (ENN) (Hassanat, 2014), and the Inverted Indexes of Neighbors Classifier (IINC) (Jirina & Jirina, 2010). Their experiments were conducted on 28 datasets taken from the UCI machine learning repository, the reported results show that Hassanat distance outperformed both of Manhattan and Euclidean distances in most of the tested datasets using the three investigated classifiers.\nLindi (2016) investigated three distance metrics to use the best performer among them with the KNN classifier, which was employed as a matcher for their face recognition system that was proposed for the NAO robot. The tested distances were Chi-square, Euclidean and Hassanat distances. Their experiments showed that Hassanat distance outperformed the other two distances in terms of precision, but was slower than both of the other distances.\nTable 1 provides a summary of these previous works on evaluating various distances within KNN classifier, along with the best distance assesed by each of them.

      "text" : "In KNN classifier, the distances between the test sample and the training data samples are identified by different measures tools. Therefore, distance measures play a vital role in determining the final classification output (Hu et al., 2016). Euclidean distance is the most widely used distance metric in KNN classifications, however, only few studies examined the effect of different distance metrics on the performance of KNN, these used a small number of distances, a small number of datasets, or both. Such shortage in experiments does not prove which distance is the best to be used with the KNN classifier. Therefore, this review attempts to bridge this gap by testing a large number of distance metrics on a large number of different datasets, in addition to investigate the distance metrics that least affected by added noise.\nThe KNN classifier can deal with noisy data, therefore, we need to investigate the impact of choosing different distance measures on the KNN performance when classifying a large number of real datasets, in addition to investigate which distance has the lowest noise implications. There are two main research questions addressed in this review:\n1. What is be the best distance metric to be implemented with the KNN classifier?\n2. What is the best distance metric to be implemented with the KNN classifier in the case of noise existence?\nWe mean by the ‘best distance metric’ (in this review) is the one that allows the KNN to classify test examples with the highest precision, recall and accuracy, i.e. the one that gives best performance of the KNN in terms of accuracy."

      "text" : "The KNN algorithm classifies an unlabelled test sample based on the majority of similar samples among the k-nearest neighbors that are the closest to test sample. The distances between the test sample and each of the training\ndata samples is determined by a specific distance measure. Figure 1 shows a KNN example, contains training samples with two classes, the first class is ‘blue square’ and the second class is ‘red triangle’. The test sample is represented in green circle. These samples are placed into two dimensional feature spaces with one dimension for each feature. To classify the test sample that belongs to class ‘blue square’ or to class ‘red triangle’; KNN adopts a distance function to find the K nearest neighbors to the test sample. Finding the majority of classes among the k nearest neighbors predicts the class of the test sample. In this case, when k = 3 the test sample is classified to the first class ‘red triangle’ because there are two red triangles and only one blue square inside the inner circle, but when k = 5 it is classified to the ”blue square” class because there are 2 red triangles and only 3 blue squares.\nKNN is simple, but proved to be highly efficient and effective algorithm for solving various real life classification problems. However, KNN has got some disadvantages these include:\n1. How to find the optimum K value in KNN Algorithm?\n2. High computational time cost as we need to compute the distance between each test sample to all training samples, for each test example we need O(nm) time complexity (number of operations), where n is the number of examples in the training data, and m is the number of features for each example.\n3. High Memory requirement as we need to store all training samples O(nm) space complexity.\n4. Finally, we need to determine the distance function that is the core of this study.\nThe first problem was solved either by using all the examples and taking the inverted indexes (Jirina & Jirina, 2008), or using ensemble learning (Hassanat et al., 2014). For the second and third problems, many studies have proposed different solutions depending on reducing the size of the training dataset, those include and not limited to (Hamming, 1968; Gates, 1972; Alpaydin, 1997; Kubat\n& , 2000) and Wilson & Martinez (2000), or using approximate KNN classification such as (Arya & Mount, 1993) and (Zheng et al., 2016). Although some previous studies in the literature that investigated the fourth problem (see Section 1.1), here we attempt to investigate the fourth problem on a much larger scale, i.e., investigating a large number of distance metrics tested on a large set of problems. In addition, we investigate the effect of noise on choosing the most suitable distance metric to be used by the KNN classifier.\nAlgorithm 1 Basic KNN algorithm\nInput: Training samples D, Test sample d, K Output: Class label of test sample\n1: Compute the distance between d and every sample in D 2: Choose the K samples in D that are nearest to d; denote the set by P (∈D) 3: Assign d the class it that is the most frequent class (or the majority class)\nThe basic KNN classifier steps can be described as follows:\n1. Training phase: The training samples and the class labels of these samples are stored. no missing data allowed, no non-numeric data allowed. 2. Classification phase: Each test sample is classified using majority vote of its neighbors by the following steps:\na) Distances from the test sample to all stored training sample are calculated using a specific distance function or similarity measure. b) The K nearest neighbors of the test sample are selected, where K is a pre-defined small integer. c) The most repeated class of these K neighbors is assigned to the test sample. In other words, a test sample is assigned to the class c if it is the most frequent class label among the K nearest training samples. If K = 1, then the class of the nearest neighbor is assigned to the test sample. KNN algorithm is described by Algorithm 1.\nWe provide a toy example to illustrate how to compute the KNN classifier. Assuming that we have three training examples, having three attributes for each, and one test example as shown in Table 2.\nStep1: Determine the parameter K = number of the nearest neighbors to be considered. for this example we assume K = 1.\nStep 2: Calculate the distance between test sample and all training samples using a specific similarity measure, in this example, Euclidean distance is used, see Table 3.\nTable 3: Training and testing data examples with distances.\nX1 X2 X3 class Distance Training sample (1) 5 4 3 1 D =\n√\n(4− 5)2 + (4− 4)2 + (2− 3)2 = 1.4 Training sample (2) 1 2 2 2 D = √ (4− 1)2 + (4− 2)2 + (2− 2)2 = 3.6\nTraining sample (3) 1 2 3 2 D = √\n(4− 1)2 + (4− 2)2 + (2− 3)2 = 3.7 Test sample 4 4 2 ?\nStep 3: Sort all examples based on their similarity or distance to the tested example, and then keep only the K similar (nearest) examples as shown in Table 4:\nStep 4: Based on the minimum distance, the class of the test sample is assigned to be 1. However, if K = 3 for instance, the class will be 2."

      "text" : "The existence of noise in data is mainly related to the way that has been applied to acquire and preprocess data from its environment (Nettleton, OrriolsPuig, & Fornells, 2010). Noisy data is a corrupted form of data in some way, which leads to partial alteration of the data values. Two main sources of noise can be identified: First, the implicit errors caused by measurement tools, such as using different types of sensors. Second, the random errors caused by batch processes or experts while collecting data, for example, errors during the process document digitization. Based on these two sources of errors, two types of noise can be classified in a given dataset (Zhu & Wu, 2004):\n1. Class noise: occurs when the sample is incorrectly labeled due to several causes such as data entry errors during labeling process, or the inadequacy of information that is being used to label each sample.\n2. Attribute noise: refers to the corruptions in values of one or more attributes due to several causes, such as failures in sensor devices, irregularities in sampling or transcription errors (Garcia, Luengo, & Herrera, 2014).\nThe generation of noise can be classified by three main characteristics (Saez et al., 2013):\n1. The place where the noise is introduced: Noise may affect the attributes, class, training data, and test data separately or in combination.\n2. The noise distribution: The way in which the noise is introduced, for example, uniform or Gaussian.\n3. The magnitude of generated noise values: The extent to which the noise affects the data can be relative to each data value of each attribute, or relative to the standard deviation, minimum, maximum for each attribute.\nIn this work, we will add different noise levels to the tested datasets, to find the optimal distance metric that is least affected by this added noise with respect to the KNN classifier performance."

      "heading" : "2.3. Distance measures review",
      "text" : "The first appearance of the word distance can be found in the writings of Aristoteles (384 AC - 322 AC), who argued that the word distance means: “It is between extremities that distance is greatest” or “things which have something between them, that is, a certain distance”. In addition, “distance has the sense of dimension [as in space has three dimensions, length, breadth and depth]”. Euclid, one of the most important mathematicians of the ancient history, used the word distance only in his third postulate of the Principia (Euclid, 1956): “Every circle can be described by a centre and a distance”. The distance is a numerical description of how far apart entities are. In data mining, the distance means a concrete way of describing what it means for elements of some space to be close to or far away from each other. Synonyms for distance include farness, dissimilarity, diversity, and synonyms for similarity include proximity (Cha, 2007), nearness (Todeschini, Ballabio, & Consonni, 2015).\nThe distance function between two vectors x and y is a function d(x, y) that defines the distance between both vectors as a non-negative real number. This function is considered as a metric if satisfy a certain number of properties (Deza & Deza, 2009) that include the following:\n1. Non-negativity: The distance between x and y is always a value greater than or equal to zero.\nd(x, y) ≥ 0\n2. Identity of indiscernibles: The distance between x and y is equal to zero if and only if x is equal to y.\nd(x, y) = 0 iff x = y\n3. Symmetry: The distance between x and y is equal to the distance between y and x.\nd(x, y) == d(y, x)\n4. Triangle inequality: Considering the presence of a third point z, the distance between x and y is always less than or equal to the sum of the distance between x and z and the distance between y and z.\nd(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y)\nWhen the distance is in the range [0, 1], the calculation of a corresponding similarity measure s(x, y) is as follows:\ns(x, y) = 1− d(x, y)\nWe consider the eight major distance families which consist of fifty four total distance measures. We categorized these distance measures following a similar categorization done by Cha (2007). In what follows, we give the mathematical definitions of distances to measure the closeness between two vectors x and y, where x = (x1, x2, ., xn) and y = (y1, y2, ., yn) having numeric attributes. As an example, we show the computed distance value between the vectors v1 = {5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.3}, v2 = {5.4, 3.4, 1.7, 0.2}. Theoretical analysis of these different distance metrics is beyond the scope of this work.\n1. Lp Minkowski distance measures: This family of distances includes three distance metrics that are special cases of Minkowski distance, corresponding to different values of p for this power distance. The Minkowski distance, which is also known as Lp norm, is a generalized metric. It is defined as:\nDMink(x, y) = p √√√√ n∑ i=1 |xi − yi|p,\nwhere p is a positive value. When p = 2, the distance becomes the Euclidean distance. When p = 1 it becomes Manhattan distance. Chebyshev distance is a variant of Minkowski distance where p = ∞. xi is the ith value in the vector x and yi is the i th value in the vector y.\n1.1 Manhattan (MD): The Manhattan distance, also known as L1 norm, Taxicab norm, Rectilinear distance or City block distance, which considered by Hermann Minkowski in 19th-century Germany. This distance represents the sum of the absolute differences between the opposite values in vectors.\nMD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 |xi − yi|\n1.2 Chebyshev (CD): Chebyshev distance is also known as maximum value distance (Grabusts, 2011), Lagrange (Todeschini, Ballabio, & Consonni, 2015) and chessboard distance (Premaratne, 2014). This distance is appropriate in cases when two objects are to be defined as different if they are different in any one dimension (Verma, 2012). It is a metric defined on a vector space where distance between two vectors is the greatest of their difference along any coordinate dimension.\nCD(x, y) = max i |xi − yi|\n1.3 Euclidean (ED): Also known as L2 norm or Ruler distance, which is an extension to the Pythagorean Theorem. This distance represents\nthe root of the sum of the square of differences between the opposite values in vectors.\nED(x, y) = √√√√ n∑ i=1 |xi − yi|2\nLp Minkowski distance measures\nAbbrev. Name Definition Result MD Manhattan ∑n i=1 |xi − yi| 0.8 CD Chebyshev maxi |xi − yi| 0.3 ED Euclidean √∑n i=1 |xi − yi|2 0.4472\n2. L1 Distance measures: This distance family depends mainly finding the absolute difference, the family include Lorentzian, Canberra, Sorensen, Soergel, Kulczynski, Mean Character, Non Intersection distances.\n2.1 Lorentzian distance (LD): Lorentzian distance is represented by the natural log of the absolute difference between two vectors. This distance is sensitive to small changes since the log scale expands the lower range and compresses the higher range.\nLD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 ln(1 + |xi − yi|),\nwhere ln is the natural logarithm, and To ensure that the nonnegativity property and to avoid log of zero, one is added. 2.2 Canberra distance (CanD): Canberra distance, which is introduced by Williams & Lance (1966) and modified in Lance & Williams (1967). It is a weighted version of Manhattan distance, where the absolute difference between the attribute values of the vectors x and y is divided by the sum of the absolute attribute values prior to summing (Akila & Chandra, 2013). This distance is mainly used for positive values. It is very sensitive to small changes near zero, where it is more sensitive to proportional than to absolute differences. Therefore, this characteristic becomes more apparent in higher dimensional space, respectively with an increasing number of variables. The Canberra distance is often used for data scattered around an origin.\nCanD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 |xi − yi| |xi|+ |yi|\n2.3 Sorensen distance (SD): The Sorensen distance (Sorensen, 1948), also known as Bray–Curtis is one of the most commonly applied measurements to express relationships in ecology, environmental sciences and related fields. It is a modified Manhattan metric, where the summed differences between the attributes values of the vectors x and y are standardized by their summed attributes values (Szmidt,\n2013). When all the vectors values are positive, this measure take value between zero and one.\nSD(x, y) = ∑n i=1 |xi − yi|∑n i=1(xi + yi)\n2.4 Soergel distance (SoD): Soergel distance is one of the distance measures that is widely used to calculate the evolutionary distance (Chetty, Ngom, & Ahmad, 2008). It is also known as Ruzicka distance. For binary variables only, this distance is identical to the complement of the Tanimoto (or Jaccard) similarity coefficient (Zhou, Chan, & Wang, 2008). This distance obeys all four metric properties provided by all attributes have nonnegative values (Willett, Barnard, & Downs, 1998).\nSoD(x, y) = ∑n i=1 |xi − yi|∑n\ni=1 max (xi, yi)\n2.5 Kulczynski Distance (KD): Similar to the Soergel distance, but instead of using the maximum, it uses the minimum function.\nKD(x, y) = ∑n i=1 |xi − yi|∑n\ni=1 min (xi, yi)\n2.6 Mean Character Distance (MCD): Also known as Average Manhattan, or Gower distance.\nMCD(x, y) =\n∑n i=1 |xi − yi|\nn\n2.7 Non Intersection Distance (NID): Non Intersection distance is the complement to the intersection similarity and is obtained by subtracting the intersection similarity from one.\nNID(x, y) = 1\n2 n∑ i=1 |xi − yi|.\nL1 Distance measures Abbrev.

Inner product distance measures: Distance measures belonging to this family are calculated by some products of pair wise values from both vectors, this type of distances includes: Jaccard, Cosine, Dice, Chord distances.\n3.1 Jaccard distance (JacD): The Jaccard distance measures dissimilarity between sample sets, it is a complementary to the Jaccard similarity coefficient (Jaccard, 1901) and is obtained by subtracting the Jaccard coefficient from one. This distance is a metric (Cesare & Xiang, 2012).\nJacD(x, y) = ∑n i=1(xi − yi)2∑n\ni=1 x 2 i + ∑n i=1 y 2 i − ∑n i=1 xiyi\n3.2 Cosine distance (CosD): The Cosine distance, also called angular distance, is derived from the cosine similarity that measures the angle between two vectors, where Cosine distance is obtained by subtracting the cosine similarity from one.\nCosD(x, y) = 1− ∑n\ni=1 xiyi√∑n i=1 x 2 i √∑n i=1 y 2 i\n3.3 Dice distance (DicD): The dice distance is derived from the dice similarity (Dice, 1945), which is a complementary to the dice similarity and is obtained by subtracting the dice similarity from one. It can be sensitive to values near zero. This distance is a not a metric, in particular, the property of triangle inequality does not hold. This distance is widely used in information retrieval in documents and biological taxonomy.\nDicD(x, y) = 1− 2 ∑n\ni=1 xiyi∑n i=1 x 2 i + ∑n i=1 y 2 i\n3.4 Chord distance (ChoD): A modification of Euclidean distance (Gan, Ma, & Wu, 2007), which was introduced by Orloci (Orloci, 1967) to be used in analyzing community composition data (Legendre & Legendre, 2012). It was defined as the length of the chord joining two normalized points within a hypersphere of radius one.

Where the Euclidean distance has the following drawback, ”if two data vectors have no attribute values in common, they may have a smaller distance than the other pair of data vectors containing the same attribute values” (Gan, Ma, & Wu, 2007), so that, this distance was adopted.\nAD(x, y) = √√√√ 1 n n∑ i=1 (xi − yi)2\n5.10 Mean Censored Euclidean Distance (MCED): In this distance, the sum of squared differences between values is calculated and, to get the mean value, the summed value is divided by the total number of values where the pairs values do not equal to zero.

Shannon entropy distance measures: The distance measures belonging to this family are related to the Shannon entropy (Shannon, 2001). These distances include Kullback-Leibler, Jeffreys, K divergence, Topsoe, Jensen-Shannon, Jensen difference distances.\n6.1 Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD): Kullback-Leibler distance was introduced by Kullback & Leibler (1951), it is also known as KL divergence, relative entropy, or information deviation, which measures the difference between two probability distributions. This distance is not a metric measure, because it is not symmetric. Furthermore, it does not satisfy triangular inequality property, therefore it is called quasi-distance. Kullback-Leibler divergence has been used in several natural language applications such as for query expansion, language models, and categorization (Pinto, Benedi, & Rosso, 2007).\nKLD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 xi ln xi yi ,\nwhere ln is the natural logarithm. 6.2 Jeffreys Distance (JefD): Jeffreys distance (Jeffreys, 1946), also called\nJ-divergence or KL2- distance, is a symmetric version of the KullbackLeibler distance.\nJefD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 (xi − yi) ln xi yi\n6.3 K divergence Distance (KDD):\nKDD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 xi ln 2xi xi + yi\n6.4 Topsoe Distance (TopD): The Topsoe distance (Topsoe, 2000), also called information statistics, is a symmetric version of the KullbackLeibler distance. The Topsoe distance is twice the Jensen-Shannon divergence. This distance is not a metric, but its square root is a metric.\nTopD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 xi ln ( 2xi xi + yi ) + n∑ i=1 yi ln ( 2yi xi + yi ) 6.5 Jensen-Shannon Distance (JSD): Jensen-Shannon distance is the square\nroot of the Jensen Shannon divergence. It is the half of the Topsoe distance which uses the average method to make the K divergence symmetric.\nJSD(x, y) = 1\n2\n[ n∑\ni=1\nxi ln\n( 2xi\nxi + yi\n) + n∑ i=1 yi ln ( 2yi xi + yi )]\n6.6 Jensen difference distance (JDD): Jensen difference distance was introduced by Sibson (1969).\nJDD(x, y) = 1\n2\n[ n∑\ni=1\nxi lnxi + yilnyi 2\n− ( xi + yi\n2\n) ln ( xi + yi\n2\n)]\nShannon entropy distance measures family Abbrev.

Vicissitude distance measures: Vicissitude distance family consists of four distances, Vicis-Wave Hedges, Vicis Symmetric, Max Symmetric χ2\nand Min Symmetric χ2 distances. These distances were generated from syntactic relationship for the aforementioned distance measures.\n7.1 Vicis-Wave Hedges distance (VWHD): The so-called ”Wave-Hedges distance” has been applied to compressed image retrieval (Hatzigiorgaki & Skodras, 2003), content based video retrieval (Patel & Meshram, 2012), time series classification (Giusti & Batista, 2013),image fidelity (Macklem, 2002), finger print recognition (Bharkad & Kokare, 2011), etc.. Interestingly, the source of the ”Wave-Hedges” metric has not been correctly cited, and some of the previously mentioned resources allude to it incorrectly as Hedges (1976). The source\nof this metric eludes the authors, despite best efforts otherwise. Even the name of the distance ”Wave-Hedges” is questioned (Hassanat, 2014).\nVWHD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 |xi − yi| min(xi, yi)\n7.2 Vicis symmetric distance (VSD): Vicis Symmetric distance is defined by three formulas, VSDF1, VSDF2, VSDF3 as the following\nV SDF1(x, y) = n∑ i=1 (xi − yi)2 min(xi, yi)2 ,\nV SDF2(x, y) = n∑ i=1 (xi − yi)2 min(xi, yi) ,\nV SDF3(x, y) = n∑ i=1 (xi − yi)2 max(xi, yi)\n7.3 Max symmetric χ2 distance (MSCD):\nMSCD(x, y) = max\n( n∑\ni=1\n(xi − yi)2\nxi , n∑ i=1 (xi − yi)2 yi\n)\n7.4 Min symmetric χ2 distance (MiSCSD):\nMiSCSD(x, y) = min\n( n∑\ni=1\n(xi − yi)2\nxi , n∑ i=1 (xi − yi)2 yi\n)\nVicissitude distance measures family Abbrev.

This distance is obtained by subtracting the Pearsons correlation coefficient from one.\nPeaD(x, y) = 1− ∑n\ni=1(xi − x̄)(yi − ȳ)√∑n i=1(xi − x̄)2 ? ∑n i=1(yi − ȳ)2\nwhere x̄ = 1n ∑n\ni=1 xi. 8.5 Correlation Distance (CorD): Correlation distance is a version of the\nPearson distance, where the Pearson distance is scaled in order to obtain a distance measure in the range between zero and one.\nCorD(x, y) = 1\n2\n( 1− ∑n i=1(xi − x̄)(yi − ȳ)√∑n\ni=1(xi − x̄)2 √∑n i=1(yi − ȳ)2\n)\n8.6 Squared Pearson Distance (SPeaD):\nSPeaD(x, y) = 1− ( ∑n i=1(xi − x̄)(yi − ȳ)√∑n\ni=1(xi − x̄)2 √∑n i=1(yi − ȳ)2 )2 8.7 Hamming Distance (HamD): Hamming distance (Hamming, 1958) is\na distance metric that measures the number of mismatches between two vectors. It is mostly used for nominal data, string and bitwise analyses, and also can be useful for numerical data.\nHamD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 1xi 6=yi\n8.8 Hausdorff Distance (HauD):\nHauD(x, y) = max(h(x, y), h(y, x))\nwhere h(x, y) = maxxi∈x minyi∈y ||xi−yi||, and ||·|| is the vector norm (e.g. L2 norm ). The function h(x, y) is called the directed Hausdorff distance from x to y. The Hausdorff distance HauD(x, y) measures the degree of mismatch between the sets x and y by measuring the remoteness between each point xi and yi and vice versa. 8.9 χ2 statistic Distance (CSSD): The χ2 statistic distance was used for image retrieval (Kadir et al., 2012), histogram (Rubner & Tomasi, 2013), etc.\nCSSD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 xi −mi mi\nwhere mi = xi+yi\n2 . 8.10 Whittaker’s index of association Distance (WIAD): Whittaker’s in-\ndex of association distance was designed for species abundance data (Whittaker, 1952).\nWIAD(x, y) = 1\n2 n∑ i=1 | xi∑n i=1 xi − yi∑n i=1 yi |\n8.11 Meehl Distance (MeeD): Meehl distance depends on one consecutive point in each vector.\nMeeD(x, y) = n−1∑ i=1 (xi − yi − xi+1 + yi+1)2\n8.12 Motyka Distance (MotD):\nMotD(x, y) = ∑n i=1 max(xi, yi)∑n i=1(xi + yi)\n8.13 Hassanat Distance (HasD): Hassanat Distance introduced by Hassanat (2014).\nHasD(x, y) = n∑ i=1 D(xi, yi)\nwhere\nD(x, y) = { 1− 1+min(xi,yi)max(xi,yi) , min(xi, yi) ≥ 0 1− 1+min(xi,yi)+|min(xi,yi)|max(xi,yi)+|min(xi,yi)| , min(xi, yi) < 0\nAs can be seen, Hassanat distance is bounded by [0, 1[. It reaches 1 when the maximum value approaches infinity assuming the minimum is finite, or when the minimum value approaches minus infinity\nassuming the maximum is finite. This is shown by Figure 2 and the following equations.\nlim max(Ai,Bi)→∞ D(Ai, Bi) = lim max(Ai,Bi)→−∞ D(Ai, Bi) = 1,\nBy satisfying all the metric properties this distance was proved to be a metric by Hassanat (2014). In this metric no matter what the difference between two values is, the distance will be in the range of 0 to 1. so the maximum distance approaches to the dimension of the tested vectors, therefore the increases in dimensions increases the distance linearly in the worst case.\nOther distance measures family Abbrev.

For this purpose, 34% of the data set is used for testing, and 66% of the data is dedicated for training. The value of K is set to 1 for simplicity. The 34% of the data, which were used as a test sample, were chosen randomly, and each experiment on each data set was repeated 10 times to obtain random examples for testing and training. The overall experimental framework is shown in Figure 3. Our experiments are divided into two major parts:\n1. The first part of experiments aims to find the best distance measures to be used by KNN classifier without any noise in the datasets. We used all the 54 distances which were reviewed in Section 2.3.\n2. The second part of experiments aims to find the best distance measure to be used by KNN classifier in the case of noisy data. In this work, we define the ‘best’ method as the method that performs with the highest accuracy. We added noise into each dataset at various levels of noise. The experiments in the second part were conducted using the top 10 distances, those which achieved the best results in the first part of experiments. Therefore, in order to create a noisy dataset from the original one, a level of noise x% is selected in the range of (10% to 90%), the level of noise means the number of examples that need to be noisy, the amount of noise is selected randomly between the minimum and maximum values of each attribute, all attributes for each examples are corrupted by a random noise, the number of noisy examples are selected randomly. Algorithm 2 describes the process of corrupting data with random noise to be used for further experiments for the purposes of this work."

Also, ED, SED and AD outperform the other tested measures on the Letter rec. with 95.57% average precision.\n• In Shannon entropy distance measures family, JSD and TopD achieved similar performance with overall precision in all datasets, due to their equations similarity as clarified earlier.\n• The Vicissitude distance measures family outperform other distance families on four datasets. The VSDF1 achieved the highest average precisions on three datasets, Liver, Parkinson and Phoneme with 43.24%, 99.97%, 87.23% average precisions respectively. MiSCSD also achieved the highest precision on the Sonar dataset with 57.99% average precision.\n• The other distance measures family outperforms all the other distance families in 6 datasets. In particular, HamD achieved the highest precision on the Heart dataset with 51.12% average precision. Also, WIAD achieved the highest precision on the Monkey1 dataset with 95% average precision. Moreover, HasD yield the highest precision in four datasets, namely,\nWe attribute the success of Hassanat distance in this experimental part to its characteristics discussed in Section 2.3 (See distance equation in 8.13, Figure 2), where each dimension in the tested vectors contributes maximally 1 to the final distance, this lowers and neutralizes the effects of outliers in different datasets. To further analyze the performance of Hassanat distance comparing with other top distances we used the Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test (Wilcoxon, 1945). This is a non-parametric pairwise test that aims to detect significant differences between two sample means, to judge if the null hypothesis is true or not. Null hypothesis is a hypothesis used in statistics that assumes there is no significant difference\nbetween different results or observations. This test was conducted between Hassanat distance and with each of the other top distances (see Table 10) over the tested datasets. Therefore, our null hypothesis is: “there is no significant difference between the performance of Hassanat distance and the compared distance over all the datasets used”. According to the Wilcoxon test, if the result of the test showed that the P-value is less than the significance level (0.05) then we reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that there is a significant difference between the tested samples; otherwise we cannot conclude anything about the significant difference (Derrac et al., 2011).\nThe accuracies, recalls and precisions of Hassanat distance over all the datasets used in this experiment set were compared to those of each of the top 10 distance measures, with the corresponding P-values are given in Table 11. The P-values that were less than the significance level (0.05) are highlighted in bold. As can be seen from Table 11, the P-values of accuracy results is less than the significance level (0.05) eight times, here we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the performance of Hassanat distance compared to ED, CanD, CosD, ClaD, SCSD, WIAD, CorD and DivD, and since the average performance of Hassanat distance was better than all of these distance measures from the previous tables, we can conclude that the accuracy yielded by Hassanat distance is better than that of most of the distance measures tested. Similar analysis applies for the recall, and precision columns comparing Hassanat results to the other distances."

      "text" : "These next experiments aim to identify the impact of noisy data on the performance of KNN classifier regarding accuracy, recall and precision using different distance measures. Accordingly, nine different levels of noise were added into each dataset using Algorithm 2. For simplicity, this set of experiments\nconducted using only the top 10 distances shown in Table 10 that are obtained based on the noise-free datasets.\nFigure 4 shows the experimental results of KNN classifier that clarify the impact of noise on the accuracy performance measure using the top 10 distances. X-axis denotes the noise level and Y-axis represents the classification accuracy. Each column at each noise level represents the overall average accuracy for each distance on all datasets used. Error bars represent the average of standard deviation values for each distance on all datasets. Figure 5 shows the recall results of KNN classifier that clarify the impact of noise on the performance using the top 10 distance measures. Figure 6 shows the precision results of KNN classifier that clarify the impact of noise on the performance using the top 10 distance measures. As can be seen from Figures 4, 5 and 6 the performance (measured by accuracy, recall, and precision respectively) of the KNN degraded only about 20% while the noise level reaches 90%, this is true for all the distances used. This means that the KNN classifier using any of the top 10 distances tolerate noise to a certain degree. Moreover, some distances are less affected by the added noise comparing to other distances. Therefore, we ordered the distances according to their overall average accuracy, recall and precision results for each level of noise. The distance with highest performance is ranked in the first position, while the distance with the lowest performance is ranked in the last position of the order. Tables 12, 13 and 14 show this ranking structure\nin terms of accuracy, precision, and recall under each noise level from low 10% to high 90%. The empty cells occur because of sharing same rank by more than one distance. The following points summarize the observations in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall values:\n• According to the average precision results, the highest precision was obtained by HasD which achieved the first rank in the majority of noise levels. This distance succeeds to be in the first rank at noise levels 10% up to 70%. However, at a level 80%, LD outperformed HasD. Also, MD outperformed on the HasD at a noise level 90%.\n• LD achieved the second rank at noise levels 10%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 70%.The CanD achieved the second rank at noise levels 20% and 60%. Moreover, this distance achieved the third rank in the rest noise levels except at noise levels 50% and 90%. The SCSD achieved the fourth rank at noise levels 10%, 30%, 40%, and 70% and the third rank at a level of noise 50%. This distance was equal with the LD at a noise level 20%. The ClarD achieved the third rank at noise levels 20%, and 60%.\n• The rest of distances achieved the middle and the last ranks in different orders at each level of noise. The cosine distance at level 80% was equal to the WIAD in the result. This distance was also equal with the CorD at levels 30% and 70%. These two distances performed the worst (lowest precision) in most noise levels.\nBased on results in Tables 12, 13 and 14, we observe that the ranking of distances in terms of accuracy, recall and precision without the presence of noise is different with their ranking when adding the first level of noise 10% and it become variants significantly when we increased the level of noise progressively. This means that the distances are affected by noise. However, the crucial question is: which one is the distances is least affected by noise? From the above results we conclude that HasD is the least affected one, followed by LD, CanD and SCSD."

      "heading" : "3.7. Precise evaluation of the effects of noise",
      "text" : "In order to justify why some distances are affected either less or more by noise, the following toy Examples 3.1 and 3.2 are designed. These illustrate the effect of noise on the final decision of the KNN classifier using Hassanat (HasD) and the standard Euclidean (ED) distances. In both examples, we assume that we have two training vectors (v1 and v2) having three attributes for each, in addition to one test vector (v3). As usual, we calculate the distances between v3 and both v1 and v2 using both of Euclidean and Hassanat distances.\nExample 3.1. This example shows the KNN classification using two different distances on clean data (without noise). We find the Distance to test vector (v3) according to ED and HasD.\nX1 X2 X3 X4 Class Dist(·,V3) ED HasD\nV1 3 4 5 3 2 2 0.87 V2 1 3 4 2 1 1 0.33 V3 2 3 4 2 ?\nAs can be seen, assuming that we use k = 1, based on the 1-NN approach, and using both distances, the test vector is assigned to class 1, both results are reasonable, because V3 is almost the same as V2 (class =1) except for the 1st feature, which differs only by 1.\nExample 3.2. This example shows the same feature vectors as in Example 3.1, but after corrupting one of the features with an added noise. That is, we make the same previous calculations using noisy data instead of the clean data; the first attribute in V2 is corrupted by an added noise of (4, i.e. X1 = 5).\nX1 X2 X3 X4 Class Dist(·,V3) ED HasD\nV1 3 4 5 3 2 2 0.87 V2 5 3 4 2 1 3 0.5 V3 2 3 4 2 ?\nBased on the minimum distance approach, using Euclidian distance, the test vector is assigned to class 2 instead of 1. However, the test vector is assigned to class 1 using the Hassanat distance, this makes the distance more accurate with the existence of noise. Although simple, these examples showed that the Euclidean distance was affected by noise and consequently affected the\nKNN classification ability. Although the performance of the KNN classifier is decreased as the noise increased (as shown by the extensive experiments with various datasets), we find that some distances are less affected by noise than other distances. For example, when using ED any change in any attribute contributes highly to the final distance, even if both vectors were similar but in one feature there was noise, the distance (in such a case) becomes unpredictable. In contrast, with the Hassanat distance we found that the distance between both consecutive attributes are bounded in the range [0, 1], thus, regardless of the value of the added noise, each feature will contributes up to 1 maximally to the final distance, and not proportional to the value of the added noise. Therefore the impact of noise on the final classification is mitigated."

      "heading" : "4. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this review, the performance (accuracy, precision and recall) of the KNN classifier has been evaluated using a large number of distance measures, on clean and noisy datasets, attempting to find the most appropriate distance measure that can be used with the KNN in general. In addition we tried finding the most appropriate and robust distance that can be used in the case of noisy data. A large number of experiments conducted for the purposes of this review, and the results and analysis of these experiments show the following:\n1. The performance of KNN classifier depends significantly on the distance used, the results showed large gaps between the performances of different distances. For example we found that Hassanat distance performed the best when applied on most datasets comparing to the other tested distances.\n2. We get similar classification results when we use distances from the same family having almost the same equation, some distances are very similar, for example, one is twice the other, or one is the square of another. In these cases, and since the KNN compares examples using the same distance, the nearest neighbors will be the same if all distances were multiplied or divided by the same constant.\n3. There was no optimal distance metric that can be used for all types of datasets, as the results show that each dataset favors a specific distance metric, and this result complies with the no-free-lunch theorem.\n4. The performance (measured by accuracy, precision and recall) of the KNN degraded only about 20% while the noise level reaches 90%, this is true for all the distances used. This means that the KNN classifier using any of the top 10 distances tolerate noise to a certain degree.\n5. Some distances are less affected by the added noise comparing to other distances, for example we found that Hassanat distance performed the best when applied on most datasets under different levels of heavy noise.\nOur work has the following limitations, and future works will focus on studying, evaluating and investigating these.\n1. Although, we have tested a large number of distance measures, there are still many other distances and similarity measures that are available in the machine learning area that are need to be tested and evaluated for performance.\n2. The 28 datasets though higher than previously tested, still might not be enough to draw significant conclusions in terms of the effectiveness of certain distance measures, and therefore, there is a need to use larger number of datasets with varied data types.\n3. The added noise used in this review might not simulate the other types of noise that occur in the real world, so other types of noise need to be used to corrupt data, so as to evaluate the distance measures more robustly.\n4. Only KNN classifier was reviewed in this work, other variant of KNN such as the approximate KNN need to be investigated.\n5. Distance measures are not used only with the KNN, but also with other machine learning algorithms, such as different types of clustering, those need to be evaluated under different distance measures."

The core of this classifier depends mainly on measuring the distance or similarity between the tested example and the training examples. This raises a major question about which distance measures to be used for the KNN classifier among a large number of distance and similarity measures? This review attempts to answer the previous question through evaluating the performance (measured by accuracy, precision and recall) of the KNN using a large number of distance measures, tested on a number of real world datasets, with and without adding different levels of noise. The experimental results show that the performance of KNN classifier depends significantly on the distance used, the results showed large gaps between the performances of different distances. We found that a recently proposed non-convex distance performed the best when applied on most datasets comparing to the other tested distances. In addition, the performance of the KNN degraded only about 20% while the noise level reaches 90%, this is true for all the distances used. This means that the KNN classifier using any of the top 10 distances tolerate noise to a certain degree. Moreover, the results show that some distances are less affected by the added noise comparing to other distances.",
