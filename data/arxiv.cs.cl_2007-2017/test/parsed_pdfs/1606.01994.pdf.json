      "text" : "Community-driven question answering (QA) websites such as Quora, Yahoo-Answers, and Answers.com are accumulating millions of users and hundreds of millions of questions. A large portion of the questions are about facts or trivia. It has been a long pursuit to enable machines to answer such questions automatically.\nIn recent years, several efforts have been made on utilizing open-domain knowledge bases to answer factoid questions. A knowledge\n∗Part of the work was done while at Baidu.\nbase (KB) consists of structured representation of facts in the form of subject-relation-object triples. Lately, several large-scale generalpurpose KBs have been constructed, including YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), NELL (Carlson et al., 2010), and DBpedia (Lehmann et al., 2014). Typically, structured queries with predefined semantics (e.g. SPARQL) can be issued to retrieve specified facts from such KBs. Thus, answering factoid questions will be straightforward once they are converted into the corresponding structured form. However, due to complexity of language, converting natural language questions to structure forms remains an open challenge.\nAmong all sorts of questions, there is one category that only requires a single fact (triple) in KB as the supporting evidence. As a typical example, the question “Who created the character Harry Potter” can be answered with the single fact (HarryPotter, CharacterCreatedBy, J.K.Rowling). In this work, we refer to such questions as single-fact questions. Previously, it has been observed that single-fact questions constitute the majority of factoid questions in community QA sites (Fader et al., 2013). Despite the simplicity, automatically answering such questions remains far from solved — the latest best result on a dataset of 108k single-fact questions is only 63.9% in terms of accuracy (Bordes et al., 2015).\nTo find the answer to a single-fact question, it suffices to identify the subject entity and relation (implicitly) mentioned by the question, and then forms a corresponding structured query. The problem can be formulated into a probabilistic form. Given a single-fact question q, finding the subjectrelation pair ŝ, r̂ from the KB K which maximizes the conditional probability p(s, r|q), i.e.\nŝ, r̂ = arg max s,r∈K\np(s, r|q) (1)\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 99\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 7\nJ un\n2 01\n6\nBased on the formulation (1), the central problem is to estimate the conditional distribution p(s, r|q). It is very challenging because of a) the vast amount of facts — a large-scale KB such as Freebase contains billions of triples, b) the huge variety of language — there are multiple aliases for an entity, and numerous ways to compose a question, c) the severe sparsity of supervision — most combinations of s, r, q are not expressed in training data. Faced with these challenges, existing methods have exploited to incorporate prior knowledge into semantic parsers, to design models and representations with better generalization property, to utilize large-margin ranking objective to estimate the model parameters, and to prune the search space during inference. Noticeably, models based on neural networks and distributed representations have largely contributed to the recent progress (see section 2).\nIn this paper, we propose CFO, a novel method to answer single-fact questions with large-scale knowledge bases. The contributions of this paper are,\n• we employ a fully probabilistic treatment of the problem with a novel conditional parameterization using neural networks, • we propose the focused pruning method to re-\nduce the search space during inference, and • we investigate two variations to improve the\ngeneralization of representations for millions of entities under highly sparse supervision.\nIn experiments, CFO achieves 75.7% in terms of top-1 accuracy on the largest dataset to date, outperforming the current best record by an absolute margin of 11.8%."

      "text" : "The research of KB supported QA has evolved from earlier domain-specific QA (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Tang and Mooney, 2001; Liang et al., 2013) to open-domain QA based on largescale KBs. An important line of research has been trying to tackle the problem by semantic parsing, which directly parses natural language questions into structured queries (Liang et al., 2011; Cai and Yates, 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Yao and Van Durme, 2014). Recent progresses include designing KB specific logical representation and parsing grammar (Berant et al., 2013), using distant supervision (Berant et al., 2013), utilizing\nparaphrase information (Fader et al., 2013; Berant and Liang, 2014), requiring little questionanswer pairs (Reddy et al., 2014), and exploiting ideas from agenda-based parsing (Berant and Liang, 2015).\nIn contrast, another line of research tackles the problem by deep learning powered similarity matching. The core idea is to learn semantic representations of both the question and the knowledge from observed data, such that the correct supporting evidence will be the nearest neighbor of the question in the learned vector space. Thus, a main difference among several approaches lies in the neural networks proposed to represent questions and KB elements. While (Bordes et al., 2014b; Bordes et al., 2014a; Bordes et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2014) use relatively shallow embedding models to represent the question and knowledge, (Yih et al., 2014; Yih et al., 2015) employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce the representation. In the latter case, both the question and the relation are treated as a sequence of letter-trigram patterns, and fed into two parameter shared CNNs to get their embeddings. What’s more, instead of measuring the similarity between a question and an evidence triple with a single model as in (Bordes et al., 2015), (Yih et al., 2014; Yih et al., 2015) adopt a multi-stage approach. In each stage, one element of the triple is compared with the question to produce a partial similarity score by a dedicated model. Then, these partial scores are combined to generate the overall measurement.\nOur proposed method is closely related to the second line of research, since neural models are employed to learn semantic representations. As in (Bordes et al., 2015; Yih et al., 2014), we focus on single-fact questions. However, we propose to use recurrent neural networks (RNN) to produce the question representation. More importantly, our method follows a probabilistic formulation, and our parameterization relies on factors other than similarity measurement.\nBesides KB-based QA, our work is also loosely related to work using deep learning systems in QA tasks with free text evidences. For example, (Iyyer et al., 2014) focuses questions from the quiz bowl competition with recursive neural network. New architectures including memory networks (Weston et al., 2015), dynamic memory networks (Kumar et al., 2015), and more (Peng et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2015) have been explored under the bAbI syn-\nthetic QA task (Weston et al., 2016). In addition, (Hermann et al., 2015) seeks to answer Cloze style questions based on news articles."

      "heading" : "3 Overview",
      "text" : "In this section, we formally formulate the problem of single-fact question answering with knowledge bases. A knowledge base K contains three components: a set of entities E , a set of relations R, and a set of facts F = {〈s, r, o〉} ⊆ E × R × E , where s, o ∈ E are the subject and object entities, and r ∈ R is a binary relation. E(r), E(s) are the vector representations of a relation and an entity, respectively. s→ r indicates that there exists some entity o such that 〈s, r, o〉 ∈ F . For singlefact questions, a common assumption is that the answer entity o and some triple 〈si, rk, o〉 ∈ F reside in the given knowledge base. The goal of our model is to find such subject si and relation rk mentioned or implied in the question. Once found, a structured query (e.g. in SPARQL) can be constructed to retrieve the result entity."

      "text" : "Given a question q, the joint conditional probability of subject-relation pairs p(s, r|q) can be used to retrieve the answer using the exact inference defined by Eq. (1). However, since there can be millions of entities and thousands of relations in a knowledge base, it is less effective to model p(s, r|q) directly. Instead, we propose a conditional factoid factorization,\np(s, r|q) = p(r|q) · p(s|q, r) (2)\nand utilize two neural networks to parameterize each component, p(r|q) and p(s|q, r), respectively. Hence, our proposed method contains two phases: inferring the implied relation r from the question q, and inferring the mentioned subject entity s given the relation r and the question q.\nThere is an alternative factorization p(s, r|q) = p(s|q) ·p(r|s, q). However, it is rather challenging to estimate p(s|q) directly due to the vast amount of entities (> 106) in a KB. In comparison, our proposed factorization takes advantage of the relatively limited number of relations (on the order of thousands). What’s more, by exploiting additional information from the candidate relation r, it’s more feasible to model p(s|q, r) than p(s|q), leading to more robust estimation.\nA key difference from prior multi-step approach is that our method do not assume any independence between the target subject and relation given a question, as does in the prior method (Yih et al., 2014). It proves effective in our experiments."

      "heading" : "3.2 Inference via Focused Pruning",
      "text" : "As defined by the Eq. (1), a solution needs to consider all available subject-relation pairs in the KB as candidates. With a large-scale KB, the number of candidates can be notoriously large, resulting in a extremely noisy candidate pool. We propose a method to prune the candidate space. The pruning is equivalent to a function that takes a KB K and a question q as input, and outputs a much limited set C of candidate subject-relation pairs.\nH(K, q)→ C (3)\nCs and Cr are used to represent the subject and relation candidates, respectively.\nThe fundamental intuition for pruning is that the subject entity must be mentioned by some textual substring (subject mention) in the question. Thus, the candidate space can be restricted to entities whose name/alias matches an n-gram of the question, as in (Yih et al., 2014; Yih et al., 2015; Bordes et al., 2015). We refer to this straight-forward method as N-Gram pruning. By considering all ngrams, this approach usually achieves a high recall rate. However, the candidate pool is still noisy due to many non-subject-mention n-grams.\nOur key idea is to reduce the noise by guiding the pruning method’s attention to more probable parts of a question. An observation is that certain parts of a sentence are more likely to be the subject mention than others. For example, “Harry Potter” in “Who created the character Harry Potter” is more likely than “the character”, “character Harry”, etc. Specifically, our method employs a deep network to identify such focus segments in a question. This way, the candidate pool can be not only more compact, but also significantly less noisy.\nFinally, combing the ideas of Eq.(2) and (3), we propose an approximate solution to the problem defined by Eq. (1)\nŝ, r̂ ≈ arg max s,r∈C p(s|q, r)p(r|q) (4)"

      "text" : "Relation network In this work, the probability of relations given a question, p(r|q), is modeled by the following network\npθr(r|q) = exp\n( v(r, q) )∑ r′ exp ( v(r′, q)\n) (9) where the relation scoring function v(r, q) measures the similarity between the question and the relation\nv(r, q) = f(q)>E(r) (10)\nE(r) is the trainable embedding of the relation (randomly initialized in this work) and f(q) computes the semantic question embedding. Specifically, the question q is represented as a sequence of tokens (potentially with unknown ones). Then, the question embedding model f consists of a word embedding layer to transform tokens into distributed representations, a two-layer BiGRU to capture the question semantics, and a linear layer to project the final hidden states of the BiGRU into the same vector space as E(r).\nSubject network As introduced in section 3, the factor p(s|q, r) models the fitness of a subject s appearing in the question q, given the main topic is about the relation r. Thus, two forces a) the raw context expressed by q, and b) the candidate topic described by r, jointly impact the fitness of\nthe subject s. For simplicity, we use two additive terms to model the joint effect\npθs(s|q, r) = exp\n( u(s, r, q) )∑ s′ exp ( u(s′, r, q)\n) (11) where u(s, r, q) is the subject scoring function,\nu(s, r, q) = g(q)>E(s) + αh(r, s) (12)\ng(q) is another semantic question embedding, E(s) is a vector representation of a subject, h(r, s) is the subject-relation score, and α is the weight parameter used to trade off the two sources.\nFirstly, the context score g(q)>E(s) models the intrinsic plausibility that the subject s appears in the question q using vector space similarity. As g(q)>E(s) has the same form as equation (10), we let g adpot the same model structure as f . However, initializing E(s) randomly and training it with supervised signal, just like training E(r), is insufficient in practice — while a large-scale KB has millions of subjects, only thousands of question-triple pairs are available for training. To alleviate the problem, we seek two potential solutions: a) pretrained embeddings, and b) type vector representation.\nThe pretrained embedding approach utilizes unsupervised method to train entity embedings. In particular, we employ the TransE (Bordes et al., 2013), which trains the embedings of entities and relations by enforcing E(s) + E(r) = E(o) for every observed triple (s, r, o) ∈ K. As there exists other improved variants (Gu et al., 2015), TransE scales the best when KB size grows.\nAlternatively, type vector is a fixed (not trainable) vector representation of entities using type information. Since each entity in the KB has one or more predefined types, we can encode the entity as a vector (bag) of types. Each dimension of a type vector is either 1 or 0, indicating whether the entity is associated with a specific type or not. Thus, the dimensionality of a type vector is equal to the number of types in KB. Under this setting, with E(s) being a binary vector, let g(q) be a continuous vector with arbitrary value range can be problematic. Therefore, when type vector is used as E(s), we add a sigmoid layer upon the final linear projection of g, squashing each element of g(q) to the range [0, 1].\nCompared to the first solution, type vector is fully based on the type profile of an entity, and requires no training. As a benefit, considerably\nfewer parameters are needed. Also, given the type information is discriminative enough, using type vector will lead to easier generalization. However, containing only type information can be very restrictive.\nIn addition to the context score, we use the subject-relation score h(r, s) to capture the compatibility that s and r show up together. Intuitively, for an entity to appear in a topic characterized by a relation, a necessary condition will be that the entity has the relation connected to it. Inspired by this structural regularity, in the simplest manner, we instantiate the idea with an indicator function,\nh(r, s) = 1(s→ r) (13)\nAs there exists other more sophisticated statistical parameterizations, the proposed approach is able to capture the core idea of the structural regularity without any parameter. Finally, putting two scores together, Fig.1 summarizes the overall structure of the subject network."

      "heading" : "4.3 Focused Pruning",
      "text" : "As discussed in section 3.2, N-Gram pruning is still subject to large amount of noise in inference due to many non-subject-mention n-grams. Motivated by this problem, we propose to reduce such noise by focusing on more probable candidates using a special-purpose sequence labeling network. Basically, a sequence labeling model is trained to tag some consecutive tokens as the subject mention. Following this idea, during inference, only the most probable n-gram predicted by the model will be retained, and then used as the subject mention to generate the candidate pool C. Hence, we refer to this method as focused pruning. Formally, let W(q) be all the n-grams of the question q, p(w|q) be the probability that the n-gram w is the subject mention of q, the focused pruning function\nHs is defined as\nŵ = arg max w∈W(q)\npκ(w|q)\nC = {(s, r) :M(s, ŵ), s→ r} (14)\nwhereM(s, ŵ) represents some predefined match between the subject s and the predicted subject mention ŵ. Intuitively, this pruning method resembles the human behavior of first identifying the subject mention with the help of context, and then using it as the key word to search the KB.\nTo illustrate the effectiveness of this idea, we parameterize pκ(w|q) with a general-purpose neural labeling model, which consists of a word embedding layer, two layers of BiGRU, and a linearchain conditional random field (CRF). Thus, given a question q of length T , the score of a sequence label configuration y ∈ RT is\ns(y, q) = T∑ t=1 H(q)t,yt + T∑ t=2 Ayt−1,yt\nwhere H(q) is the hidden output of the top-layer BiGRU, A is the transition matrix possesed by the CRF, and [·]i,j indicates the matrix element on row i collum j.\nFinally, the match function M(s, ŵ) is simply defined as either strict match between an alias of s and ŵ, or approximate match provided by the Freebase entity suggest API 1. Note that more elaborative match function can further boost the performance, but we leave it for future work."

      "text" : "As the two problems defined by equation (16) take the standard form of classification, theoretically, cross entropy can used as the training objective. However, computing the partition function is often intractable, especially for pθs(s|r, q), since there can be millions of entities in the KB. Faced with this problem, classic solutions include contrastive estimation (Smith and Eisner, 2005), importance sampling approximation (Bengio et al., 2003), and hinge loss with negative samples (Collobert and Weston, 2008).\nIn this work, we utilize the hinge loss with negative samples as the training objective. Specifically, the loss function w.r.t θr has the form\nL(θr) = N∑ i=1 Mr∑ j=1 max [ 0, γr − v(r(i), q(i))\n+ v(r(j), q(i)) ] (17)\nwhere r(j) is one of the Mr negative samples (i.e. s(i) 6→ r(j)) randomly sampled from R, and γr is\n2Word embeddings are not shared across models.\nthe predefined margin.

Specifically, computing the value of u(s(j), r(i), q(i)) requires to query the KB for all types of each negative sample s(j). So, when Ms is large, the training can be extremely slow due to the limited bandwidth of KB query. Consequently, under the setting of type vector, we instead resort to the following type-wise binary cross-entropy loss\nL̃(θs) = − N∑ i=1 K∑ k=1 ( E(s(i))k log g(q (i))k\n+ [ 1− E(s(i))k ] log [ 1− g(q(i))k ]) (19) where K is the total number of types, g(q)k and E(s(i))k are the k-th element of g(q) and E(s(i)) respectively. Intuitively, with sigmoid squashed output, g(q) can be regarded as K binary classifiers, one for each type. Hence, g(q)k reprents the predicted probability that the subject is associated with the k-th type."

      "text" : "For evaluation, we consider the same metric introduced in (Bordes et al., 2015), which takes the prediction as correct if both the subject and relation are correctly retrieved. Based on this metric, we compare CFO with a few baseline systems, which include both the Memory Network QA system (Bordes et al., 2015), and systems with alternative components and parameterizations from existing work (Yih et al., 2014; Yih et al., 2015). We did not compare with alternative subject networks because the only existing method (Yih et al., 2014) relies on unique textual name of each entity, which does not generally hold in knowledge bases (except in REVERB). Alternative approaches for pruning method, relation network, and entity representation are described below.\nPruning methods We consider two baseline methods previously used to prune the search space. The first baseline is the N-Gram pruning method introduced in Section 3, as it has been successfully used in previous work (Yih et al., 2014; Yih et al., 2015). Basically, it establishes the candidate pool by retaining subject-relation pairs whose subject can be linked to one of the n-grams generated from the question. The second one is NGram+, a revised version of the N-Gram pruning with additional heuristics (Bordes et al., 2015). Instead of considering all n-grams that can be linked to entities in KB, heuristics related to overlapping n-grams, stop words, interrogative pronouns, and so on are exploited to further shrink the n-gram pool. Accordingly, the search space is restricted to subject-relation pairs whose subject can be linked\nto one of the remaining n-grams after applying the heuristic filtering.\nRelation scoring network We compare our proposed method with two previously used models. The first baseline is the embedding average model (Embed-AVG) used in (Bordes et al., 2014a; Bordes et al., 2014b; Bordes et al., 2015). Basically, it takes the element-wise average of the word embeddings of the question to be the question representation. The second one is the letter-tri-gram CNN (LTG-CNN) used in (Yih et al., 2014; Yih et al., 2015), where the question and relation are separately embedded into the vector space by two parameter shared LTG-CNNs. 4 In addition, (Yih et al., 2014; Yih et al., 2015) observed better performance of the LTG-CNN when substituting the subject mention with a special symbol. Naturally, this can be combined with the proposed focused labeling, since the latter is able to identify the potential subject mention in the question. So, we train another LTG-CNN with symbolized questions, which is denoted as LTG-CNN+. Note that this model is only tested when the focused labeling pruning is used.\nEntity representation In section 4.2, we describe two possible ways to improve the vector representation of the subject, TransE pretrained embedding and type vectors. To evaluate their effectiveness, we also include this variation in the experiment, and compare their performance with randomly initialized entity embeddings."

It suggests that under sparse supervision, training high-quality distributed knowledge repre-\n5For more details, source code is available at http:// zihangdai.github.io/cfo for reference.\nsentations remains a challenging problem. That said, pretraining entity embeddings with TransE indeed gives better performance compared to random initialization, indicating the future potential of unsupervised methods in improving continuous knowledge representation.\nIn addition, all systems using our proposed focused pruning method outperform their counterparts with alternative pruning methods. Without using ensembles, CFO is already better than the memory network ensembles by 11.8%. It substantiates the general effectiveness of the focused pruning with subject labeling method regardless of other sub-modules."

      "text" : "According to the results in section 6.4, the focused pruning plays a critical role in achieving the best performance. To get a deeper understanding of its effectiveness, we analyze how the pruning methods affect the accuracy of the system. Due to space limit, we focus on systems with BiGRU as the relation scoring function and type vector as the entity representation.\nTable 2 summarizes the recall — the percentage of pruned subject-relation candidates containing the answer — and the resulting accuracy. The single-subject case refers to the scenario that there is only one candidate entity in Cs (possibly with multiple relations), and the multi-subject case means there are multiple entities in Cs. As the table shows, focused pruning achieves comparable recall rate to N-Gram pruning.6 Given the state-of-the-art performance of sequence labeling systems, this result should not be surprising. Thus, the difference in performances entirely comes from their resulting accuracy. Notice that there exists a huge accuracy gap between the two cases. Essentially, in the single-candidate case, the system only need to identify the relation based on the more robust model pθr(r|q). In contrast, under the multi-candidate case, the system also relies on pθs(s|q, r), which has significantly more parameters to estimate, and thus is less robust. Consequently, by only focusing on the most probable sub-string, the proposed focused pruning produces much more single-candidate situations, leading to a better overall accuracy.\n6Less than 3% of the recalled candidates rely on approximate matching in the focused pruning."

      "text" : "In the aforementioned experiments, we have kept the focused labeling model and the subject scoring network fixed. To further understand the importance and sensitivity of this specific model design, we investigate some variants of these two models.\nAlternative focus with CRF RNN-CRF based models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on various sequence labeling tasks (Huang et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015). However, the labeling task we consider here is relatively unsophisticated in the sense that there are only two categories of labels - part of subject string (SUB) or not (O). Thus, it’s worth investigating whether RNN (BiGRU in our case) is still a critical component when the task gets simple. Hence, we establish a CRF baseline which uses traditional features as input. Specifically, the model is trained with Stanford CRF-NER toolkit 7 on the same reversely linked labeling data (section 6.1). For evaluation, we directly compare the sentence level accuracy of these two models on the test portion of the labeling data. A sentence labeling is considered correct only when all tokens are correctly labeled. 8 It turns out the RNN-CRF achieves an accuracy of 95.5% while the accuracy of feature based CRF is only 91.2%. Based on the result, we conclude that BiGRU plays a crucial role in our focused pruning module.\nSubject scoring with average embedding As discussed in section 4.2, the subject network g is chosen to be the same as f , mainly relying on a two-layer BiGRU to produce the semantic question embeding. Although it is a natural choice, it remains unclear whether the final performance is sensitive to this design. Motivated by this question, we substitute the BiGRU with an EmbedAVG model, and evalute the system performance.\n7http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/ CRF-NER.shtml\n8As F -1 score is usually used as the metric for sequence labeling, sentence level accuracy is more informative here.\nFor this experiment, we always use focused pruning and type vector, but vary the structure of the relation scoring network to allow high-order interaction across models. The result is summarized in Table 3. Insepcting the table horizontally, when BiGRU is employed as the subject network, the accuracy is consistently higher regardless of relation network structures. However, the margin is quite narrow, especially compared to the effect of varying the relation network structure the same way. We suspect this difference reflects the fact that modeling p(s|r, q) is intrinsically more challenging than modeling p(r|q). It also suggests that learning smooth entity representations with good discriminative power remains an open problem."

      "text" : "In this paper, we propose CFO, a novel approach to single-fact question answering. We employ a conditional factoid factorization by inferring the target relation first and then the target subject associated with the candidate relations. To resolve the representation for millions of entities, we proposed type-vector scheme which requires no training. Our focused pruning largely reduces the candidate space without loss of recall rate, leading to significant improvement of overall accuracy. Compared with multiple baselines across three aspects, our method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on a 108k question dataset, the largest publicly available one. Future work could be extending the proposed method to handle more complex questions."
