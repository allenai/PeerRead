      "text" : "Training directed graphical models – especially models with multiple layers of hidden variables – remains a major challenge. This is unfortunate because, as has been argued previously (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio, 2009), a deeper generative model has the potential to capture high-level abstractions and thus generalize better. The exact log-likelihood gradient is intractable, be it for Helmholtz machines (Dayan et al., 1995), sigmoid belief networks (SBNs), or deep belief networks (DBNs) (Hinton et al., 2006), which are directed, or deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), which are undirected. Even obtaining an unbiased estimator of the gradient of the DBN or Helmholtz machine likelihood is not something that has been achieved in the past. Here we show that it is possible to get an unbiased estimator of the likelihood (which unfortunately makes it a slightly biased estimator of the log-likelihood), using an importance sampling approach. Past proposals to train Helmholtz machines and DBNs rely on maximizing a variational bound as proxy for the log-likelihood (Hinton et al., 1995; Kingma and Welling, 2014b; Rezende et al., 2014). The first of these is the wake-sleep algorithm (Hinton et al., 1995), which relies on combining a “recognition” network (which we call an approximate inference network, here, or simply inference network) with a “generative” network. In the wake-sleep algorithm, they basically provide targets for each other. We review these previous approaches and introduce a novel approach that we generalizes the wake-sleep algorithm. Whereas the original justification of the wake-sleep algorithm has been questioned (because we are optimizing a KL-divergence in the wrong direction), a contribution of this paper is to shed a different light on the wake-sleep algorithm, viewing it as a special case of the proposed reweighted wake-sleep\nar X\niv :1\n40 6.\n27 51\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 1\nJu n\n20 14\n(RWS) algorithm, i.e., as reweighted wake-sleep with a single sample. This makes it clear that wake-sleep corresponds to optimizing a somewhat biased estimator of the likelihood gradient, while using more samples (i.e., RWS) makes the estimator less biased (and asymptotically unbiased as more samples are considered). We empirically show that effect, with clearly better results obtained with K = 5 samples than with K = 1 (wake-sleep), and 5 or 10 being sufficient to achieve good results. Unlike in the case of DBMs, which rely on a Markov chain to get samples and estimate the gradient by a mean over those samples, here the samples are iid, avoiding the very serious problem of mixing between modes that can plague MCMC methods (Bengio et al., 2013) when training undirected graphical models.\nAnother contribution of this paper regards the architecture of the deep generative model and of the approximate inference network. We view the inference network as estimating the posterior distribution of latent variables given the observed input. With this view, it is plausible that the classical architecture of the inference network (an SBN, details below) is inappropriate and we test this hypothesis empirically. In the classical sigmoidal belief network (SBN) (e.g., in the DBN and Helmholtz machine), the conditional distribution of each layer of the inference network, given the previous layer, is a factorized Bernoulli (where the probability for each bit is computed as in a logistic regression with the previous layer bits as inputs). We find that more powerful parametrizations of each layer as a conditional probability model yields better results."

      "heading" : "2.1 The Wake-Sleep Algorithm",
      "text" : "The wake-sleep algorithm was proposed as a way to train Helmholtz machines, which are deep directed graphical models p(x,h) over visible variables x and latent variables h, where the latent variables are organized in layers hk, with the k-th layer taking as input the random vector generated by the previous layer in the generating sequence, hk+1. In the Helmholtz machine (Hinton et al., 1995; Dayan et al., 1995), the top layer, hL, has a factorized unconditional distribution, so that ancestral sampling can proceed from hL down to h1 and then the generated sample x is generated by the bottom layer, given h1. In the deep belief network (DBN) (Hinton et al., 2006), the top layer is instead generated by a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), i.e., by a Markov chain, while simple ancestral sampling is used for the others. Each intermediate layer is specified by a conditional distribution parametrized as a stochastic sigmoidal layer (see Section 3 for details).\nThe wake-sleep algorithm is a training procedure for such generative models, which involves training an auxiliary network, called the inference network, that takes a visible vector x as input and stochastically outputs samples hk for all layers k = 1 to L. The inference network outputs samples are from a distribution that should estimate the conditional probability of the latent variables of the generative model (at all layers) given the input. Note that in these kinds of models (and this is generally the case with latent variables), exact inference, i.e., sampling from p(h|x) is intractable. The wake-sleep algorithm proceeds in two phases. In the wake phase, an observation x (from the real world) is sampled from the data generating distribution and propagated stochastically up the inference network (one layer at a time), thus sampling latent values h from q(h|x). Together with x, the sampled h forms a target for training p, i.e., one performs a step of gradient ascent update with respect to maximum likelihood over the generative model p(x,h), with the data x and the inferred h. This is useful because whereas computing the gradient of the marginal likelihood p(x) = ∑ h p(x,h) is intractable, we assume here that computing the gradient of the complete loglikelihood log p(x,h) is easy. In addition, these updates decouple all the layers (because both the input and the target of each layer are considered observed). In the sleep phase, a “dream” sample is obtained from the generative network by ancestral sampling from p(x,h) and is used as a target for the maximum likelihood training of the inference network, i.e., q is trained to estimate p(h|x). The justification for the wake-sleep algorithm that was originally proposed is based on the following variational bound,\nlog p(x) ≥ ∑ h q(h|x) log p(x,h) q(h|x)\nthat is true for any inference network q, but the bound becomes tight as q(h|x) approaches p(h|x). Maximizing this bound with respect to p corresponds to the wake phase update. The update with respect to q should minimize KL(q(h|x)||p(h|x)) (with q as the reference) but instead the sleep phase update minimizes the reversed KL divergence, KL(p(h|x)||q(h|x)) (with p as the reference)."

      "text" : "If we think of q(h|x) as estimating p(h|x) and train it accordingly (which is basically what the sleep phase of wake-sleep does), then we can reformulate the likelihood as an importance-weighted average:\np(x) = ∑ h p(x,h) = ∑ h q (h |x) p(x,h) q (h |x)\n= E h∼q(h |x)\n[ p(x,h)\nq (h |x) ] ' 1 K\nK∑ k=1\nh(k)∼q(h |x)\np(x,h(k)) q ( h(k) |x ) (1) Eq. (1) is a consistent and unbiased estimator for the marginal likelihood p(x). This already gives us something interesting if we want to estimate the likelihood associated with a test sample x. But depending on the q (h |x), it might suffer from very high variance. The optimal q that results in a minimum variance estimator is q∗(h |x) = p (h |x). We can even show that this is a zero-variance estimator, i.e., the best possible one:\nE h∼q∗(h |x) [ p (h |x) p(x) q∗(h |x) ] = p(x) E h∼q∗(h |x) [1] = p(x) (2)\nIn other words: If q(h|x) = q∗(h|x) = p (h |x), then an arbitrary single sample h ∼ q(h|x) will lead to an exact p(x) estimate. Of course, q(h|x) = p (h |x) is a unrealistic assumption. But q is only used as proposal distribution, any mismatch between q and p will increase variance, it will not introduce bias.\nIn practice however, we typically want to get an estimator of the log-likelihood, because we are interested in the likelihood of a whole set of test examples. In this case, in expectation over samples, we get a lower bound on the log-likelihood, by Jensen’s inequality: the expected value over samples of the log of the importance weighted likelihood estimator is less or equal than the log of the expected value, i.e., less or equal to the true log-likelihood. This is good because it gives us a conservative estimator of the log-likelihood, in average, i.e., it tends to underestimate the ground truth. From the point of view of the log-likelihood gradient, it means that our estimator is the gradient of a lower bound on the log-likelihood. This is also true of variational methods such as described below (Section 2.4). However, unlike with these methods, here the bound can be made arbitrarily tighter by simply using more samples, because the inner average over samples (before applying the log) converges to its expectation."

K is the number of approximate inference samples and controls the trade-off between computation and accuracy of the estimators (both for the gradient and for the likelihood). We typically use a large value (K=500) for test set likelihood estimator but a small value (K=5) for estimating gradients. Both the wakephase and sleep-phase update rules for q are optionally included (either one or both can be used, and best results were obtained using both).

We will refer to the former as wake-q-learning and to the latter as sleep-q-learning. In the case of a DBN (where the top layer is generated by an RBM), there is an intermediate solution, which has been proposed in (Hinton et al., 2006) and called contrastive wake-sleep. In contrastive wake-sleep we sample x from the data, propagate it stochastically into top layer and use that h as starting point for a short Markov chain in the RBM, then sample the other layers in the generative network p to generate the rest of (x,h). The objective is to put the inference network’s capacity where it matters most, i.e., near the input configurations that are seen in the training set.\nGradients for wake-q-learning can be derived to be:\n∂\n∂φ Lq(φ,x ∼ D) ' 1∑ k ωk K∑ k=1 ωk ∂ ∂φ log qφ(h (k)|x) (4)\nwith the same importance weights ωk as in (3).

      "text" : "There has been a resurgence of interest in algorithms related to the wake-sleep algorithm for directed graphical models such as the sigmoidal belief networks (SBN) and the Helmholtz machine (which is a generative SBN that is paired with an approximate inference SBN).\nIn Neural variational inference and learning (NVIL, Mnih and Gregor (2014)) the authors propose to maximize the variational lower bound on the log-likelihood to get a joint objective for both pθ\nand qφ. It was known that this approach results in a gradient estimate of very high variance for the recognition network q (Dayan and Hinton, 1996). In the NVIL paper the authors therefore use variance reductions techniques such as baselines to obtain a practical algorithm that enhances significantly over the original wake-sleep algorithm.\nRecent examples for continuous latent variables include the auto-encoding variational Bayes (Kingma and Welling, 2014a) and stochastic backpropagation papers (Rezende et al., 2014). In both cases one maximizes a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood that is rewritten as two terms: one that is just log-likelihood reconstruction error through a stochastic encoder (approximate inference) - decoder (generative model) pair, and one that regularizes the output of the approximate inference stochastic encoder so that its marginal distribution matches the generative prior on the latent variables (and the latter is also trained, to match the marginal of the encoder output).\nBesides the fact that these variational auto-encoders are only for continuous latent variables, another difference with the reweighted wake-sleep algorithm proposed here is that in the former, a single sample from the approximate inference distribution is sufficient to get an unbiased estimator of the gradient of a proxy (the variational bound). Instead, with the reweighted wake-sleep, a single sample would correspond to regular wake-sleep, which gives a biased estimator of the likelihood gradient. On the other hand, as the number of samples increases, reweighted wake-sleep provides a less biased (asymptotically unbiased) estimator of the log-likelihood and of it’s gradient."

      "text" : "Although the framework can be readily applied to continuous variables, we here restrict ourselves to distributions over binary visible and binary latent variables. We build our models by combining probabilistic components, each one associated with one of the layers of the generative network or of the inference network. The generative model can therefore be written as pθ(x,h) = p0(x|h1) p1(h1|h2) · · · pL(hL), while the inference network has the form qφ(h |x) = q1(h1 |x) · · · qL(hL |hL−1). For a distribution P to be a suitable component we must have a way to efficiently compute P (x(k)|y(k)) given some samples (x(k) , y(k)), and we must have a method to efficiently draw iid samples x(k) from P (x = x(k)|y) given y. In the following we will describe experiments containing three kinds of layers:\nSignoid Belief Network (SBN): A SBN layer (Saul et al., 1996) is a directed graphical model with independent variables xi given the parents y.\nP SBN(xi = 1 |y) = σ(W i,: y + bi). (6)\nAlthough a SBN is a very simple generative model given y, doing inference for y given x is in general intractable.\nDeep AutoRegressive Network (DARN): An autoregressive sigmoid belief network layer (Frey, 1998; Bengio and Bengio, 2000; Gregor et al., 2014) is similar to an SBN layer but with the output units xi not being independent of each other, given the layer’s input y. Instead their dependency is captured by a fully connected directed acyclic graph where the xi can be predicted like in a logistic regression in terms of its predecessors x<i and of the input of the layer, y:\nPDARN(xi = 1 |x<i,y) = σ(W i,: y + Si,<ix<i + bi). (7)\nWe use x<i = (x1, x2, · · · , xi−1) to refer to the vector containing the first i-1 observed variables. The matrix S is a lower triangular matrix that contains the autoregressive weights between the observed variables. With Si,<j we refer to the first j-1 elements of the i-th row of this matrix.\nConditional NADE: The Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator (NADE, Larochelle and Murray (2011)) is a model that uses an internal, accumulating hidden layer to predict an observed variable xi given the vector containing all previously observed variables xj . DARN is thus a special case of NADE without (deterministic) hidden layer to mediate the conditional dependency between xi and its predecessors.

It generalises and improves over the wake-sleep algorithm providing a lower bias and lower variance estimator of the log-likelihood and it’s gradient, at the price of more samples from the inference network. We were able to train models to reach or improve upon the state of the art on several discrete data distributions (Caltech Silhouettes in the main paper, various smaller datasets from the UCI repository in the supplemental material). For the MNIST dataset we did not reach the current state of the art (85.23±0.43 for RWS vs. ≈ 84.55 for a DBN). Yet, we could demonstrate that training directed models with reweighted wake-sleep results in competitive models that produce high quality samples and that are, in terms of test set log-likelihood, on par with the most powerful models and training methods in the literature. It is furthermore noteworthy to mention, that we were able to train fairly deep networks with up to 4 layers without layerwise pretraining, without carefully tuned learning schedules and other tricks to enhance learning. We found that even if the generator network uses SBN layers, better results can be obtained with an inference network that has more powerful layers, such as DARN or NADE. However, while our best models with autoregressive layers in the generative network were always\nproviding significantly better results than the models using SBN layers only, these models where always shallow with only one hidden layer. At this point it is unclear if this is due to optimization problems."

Helmholtz machines and deep belief networks are such models, and the wake-sleep algorithm has been proposed to train them. The wake-sleep algorithm relies on training not just the directed generative model but also a conditional generative model (the inference network) that runs backward from visible to latent, estimating the posterior distribution of latent given visible. We propose a novel interpretation of the wake-sleep algorithm which suggests that better estimators of the gradient can be obtained by sampling latent variables multiple times from the inference network. This view is based on importance sampling as an estimator of the likelihood, with the approximate inference network as a proposal distribution. This interpretation is confirmed experimentally, showing that better likelihood can be achieved with this reweighted wake-sleep procedure, which also provides a natural way to estimate the likelihood itself. Based on this interpretation, we propose that a sigmoid belief network is not sufficiently powerful for the layers of the inference network, in order to recover a good estimator of the posterior distribution of latent variables. Our experiments show that using a more powerful layer model, such as NADE, yields substantially better generative models.",
