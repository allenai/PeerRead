INTRODUCTION\nATHEROSCLEROSIS is a systemic/chronic disease char-acterized by the accumulation of inflammatory cells and lipids in the inner lining of the arteries.

In 2010, the total amount spent on cardiovascular diseases in the United States was estimated to be $444 billion [3]. The number of deaths due to coronary artery disease in India were projected to increase from 1.591 million in the year 2000 to 2.034 million by the year 2010 [4].\nAtherosclerosis has a long asymptomatic phase with a subclinical incubation period ranging from 30 to 50 years. The physicians would like to assess the risk of the patients having a severe clinical event such as stroke or heart attack and predict the same if possible. Some of the major known risk factors that eventually lead to the development of atherosclerosis are as follows: (i) family history of premature coronary heart disease or stoke in a first degree relative under the age of 60, (ii) tobacco abuse, (iii) type II diabetes, (iv) high blood pressure, (v) left ventricular hypertrophy, (vi) high triglycerides, (vii) high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (viii) low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, (ix) high total cholesterol. Large number of factors influence the onset of atherosclerosis making it a difficult task for the physicians to diagnose in its early stages. Though main risk factors are identified, development of automated effective risk prediction models using data mining techniques becomes essential for better health monitoring and prevention of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases [5], [6]. Establishing a diagnostic procedure for early detection of atherosclerosis disease is very important as any delay would increase the risk of serious complications or even disability. Determining the conditions (risk factors) predisposing the development of atherosclerosis can lead to tests for identifying the disease in its early stages.\nThough the clinical risk factors of CHD are identified there is a need for additional understanding on the disease progression for effective management [7]. Researchers have been focusing on techniques for quantifying atherosclerosis plaque morphology, composition, mechanical forces etc., hoping for better patient screening procedures. Imaging of atherosclerotic plaques helps in both diagnosis and monitoring of the progression for future management [8], [9]. There are two modes of imaging atherosclerosis (i) invasive and (ii) non-invasive. Among the invasive methods X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging technique even though it has certain limitations in providing information on plaque composition [10]. The invasive procedures such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) [11] and angioscopy [12] help in understanding the plaque size and to a limited extent its composition. The intravascular thermography [13] aids in monitoring the changes in plaque composition and metabolism. The non-invasive procedures such as B-mode ultrasound [14], computerized tomography (CT) [15] and magar X\niv :1\n50 1.\n07 09\n3v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\n1 Ja\nn 20\n15\nnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [16], can provide information on plaque composition on vascular beds but they fail to throw much light on the metabolic activity of the plaque inflammatory cells. Though nuclear imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) [17] have the potential for 2D and 3D surface reconstruction of thrombus using radio labels to provide information on molecular, cellular and metabolic activity of plaques [18], they lack the required resolution, sensitivity for detection and functional assessment in medium to small size arteries found in coronary circulation.\nKeeping in view the limitations of the imaging techniques there is still a greater need for developing automated methods for predicting the risk factors of atherosclerosis disease in individuals which would be of great help in reducing the disease related deaths. Machine learning approaches have been employed in a variety of real world problems to extract knowledge from data for predictive tasks. The presence of large number of attributes in medical databases affects the decision making process as some of the factors may be redundant or irrelevant. Also, the presence of missing values and highly skewed value distributions in the attributes of medical datasets require development of new preprocessing strategies. Feature selection methods are aimed at identifying feature subsets to construct models that can best describe the dataset. The other advantages in using feature selection methods include: identifying and removing of redundant/irrelevant features [19], reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, and improving the predictive capability of the classifier. The present study attempts to identify risk factors causing atherosclerosis and the possible risk that the individuals are running at.\nIn view of the above challenges, we present the following novel features of our work:\n• identifying the missing values (MV) in the dataset and imputing them by using a newly developed nonparametric imputation procedure; • determining factors that would help in predicting the risk of developing atherosclerosis among the different groups in the community; • building a predictive model that has the capability of rendering effective prediction of risk factors in realtime. • comparing the performance of our methodology with other state-of-the-art methods used in the identification of risk factors of atherosclerosis; • estimating the time complexity and scalability of our new methodology.\nThis paper is organized as follows: A brief survey of the state-of-the-art techniques employed in predicting the risk factors and understanding the biology of atherosclerosis is discussed in Section II, while in Section III we discuss a novel methodology for predicting the clinical risk factors of atherosclerosis. The description of the datasets, experiments and results are presented in Section IV. The conclusions are placed in Section V and the discussion is deferred to Section VI."

      "text" : "In [20] a test for predicting atherosclerosis is proposed using genetic algorithm and a fitness function that depends on area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristics (ROC). In [21] a three step approach based on clustering, supervised classification and frequent itemsets search is adopted to predict if a patient can develop atherosclerosis according to the correlation between his or her habits and the social environment. Support vector machines were employed in [22] for discriminating patients between coronary and non-coronary heart disease. Supervised classifiers such as Naive Bayes (NB), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Trees (DT) utilize the associations among the attributes for predicting future cardiovascular disorders in the individuals [23]. A correlation based feature selection with C4.5 decision tree is applied [24] for risk prediction of cardiovascular disease. Recent developments in imaging methods for diagnosis have given new insights on the molecular and metabolic activity of atherosclerotic plaques [25], [16], [26]. There are many other studies wherein machine learning techniques have also been employed for predicting the risk of CHD due to atherosclerosis using ultrasound and other imaging methods [27], [28]. Community based studies help in understanding the risk factors of atherosclerosis in different social strata [29], [30].\nIn the above studies the missing values (MV) were either deleted [24], or filled with approximate values [20]. A windowing method was employed [31] for obtaining the aggregates of the attributes for imputation of MVs. These approaches would lead to biased estimates and may either reduce or exaggerate the statistical power. Methods such as logistic regression, maximum likelihood and expectation maximization have been employed for imputation of MV, but they can be applied only on data sets that are either nominal or numeric. There are other imputation methods such as knearest neighbor imputation (KNNI) [32]; k-means clustering imputation (KMI) [33]; weighted k-nearest neighbor imputation (WKNNI) [34] and fuzzy k-means clustering imputation (FKMI) [33]."

      "text" : "The mean value imputation proposed by Sree Hari Rao and Naresh Kumar [35] can be employed only when the attribute values are normally distributed. In case of highly skewed attribute values the above method may result in biased estimates as mean value is not a true representative of a non-normal distribution. Motivated by the above issues we propose a methodology comprising of a novel nonparametric missing value imputation method that can be applied on (i) data sets consisting of attributes that are of the type categorical (nominal) and/or numeric (integer or real), and (ii) attribute values that belong to highly skewed distribution. The methodology proposed by Freud and Mason [36] ignores missing values while generating the decision tree, which renders lower prediction accuracies. In this paper we propose a new feature subset selection methodology where in, a particle optimization search (PSO) is wrapped around an alternating decision tree\n(ADT) embedded with new imputation strategy discussed in Section III-B, for generation of effective decision rules. This methodology can predict the diagnosis of CHD in real time. In fact the decision rules obtained by employing this novel methodology will be useful to diagnose other individuals based on their risk factors. We designate the present machine learning approach as predictive risk assessment of atherosclerosis (PRAA) methodology throughout this work.\nWe adopt the procedure suggested by Sree Hari Rao and Naresh Kumar [35] for building and evaluating the classification model using an ADT."

Each attribute of an element in S that is Aij for i = 1, 2, . . . ,m and j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1 can either be a categorical (nominal) or numeric (real or integer) type.

      "heading" : "B. New Imputation Strategy",
      "text" : "The first step in any imputation algorithm is to compute the proximity measure in the feature space among the clinical records to identify the nearest neighbors from where the values can be imputed. The most popular metric for quantifying the similarity between any two records is the Euclidean distance. Though this metric is simpler to compute, it is sensitive to the scales of the features involved. Further it does not account for correlation among the features. Also, the categorical variables can only be quantified by counting measures which calls for the development of effective strategies for computing the similarity [37]. Considering these factors we first propose a new indexing measure ICl(Ri, Rk) between two typical elements Ri, Rk for i, k = 1, 2, . . . ,m, l = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1 belonging to the column Cl of S which can be applied on any type of data, be it categorical (nominal) and/or numeric (real). We consider the following cases: Case I: Ain = Akn\nLet A denote the collection of all members of S that belong to the same decision class to which Ri and Rk belong. Based on the type of the attribute to which the column Cl belongs, the following situations arise: (i) Members of the column Cl of S i.e (A1l, A2l, . . . , Aml)\nT are of nominal or categorical or integer type: We now express A as a disjoint union of non-empty subsets of A, say Bγp1l , Bγp2l , . . . , Bγpsl obtained in such a manner that every element of A belongs to one of these subsets and no element of A is a member of more than one subset of A. That\nis A = Bγp1l ⋃ Bγp2l ⋃ , . . . , ⋃ Bγpsl , in which γp1l , γp2l , . . . , γpsl denote the cardinalities of the respective subsets Bγp1l , Bγp2l , . . . , Bγpsl formed out of the set A, with the property that each member of the same subset has the same first co-ordinate and members of no two different subsets have the same first co-ordinate. We define an index ICl(Ri, Rk) for each l = 1, 2, . . . , n− 1\nICl(Ri, Rk) =\n{ min{γpilγ , γqkl γ }, for i 6= k;\n0, otherwise.\nwhere γpil represents the cardinality of the subset Bγpil , all of whose elements have first co-ordinates Ail, γqkl represents the cardinality of that subset Bγqkl , all of whose elements have first co-ordinates Akl and γ = γp1l + γp2l + . . . ,+γpsl represents the cardinality of the set A. (ii) Members of the column Cl of S i.e (A1l, A2l, . . . , Aml)\nT are of real (fractional or non-integer numbers): We consider the set Pl for l = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1 which is a collection of all the members of the column Cl. We then compute the skewness measure sk(Pl) = 1 m ∑m i=1(Ail−Ail) 3\n( √\n1 m ∑m i=1(Ail−Ail)2)3 where Ail denote\nthe mean of Ail for each l = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. Define the sets Ml = {a ∈ Pl|a ≤ Ail, for sk(Pl) < 0} or, Ml = {b ∈ Pl|b > Ail, for sk(Pl) ≥ 0} and similarly Nl = {a ∈ Pl|a ≤ Akl, for sk(Pl) < 0} or, Nl = {b ∈ Pl|b > Akl, for sk(Pl) ≥ 0}. Let τl and ρl be the cardinalities of the sets Ml and Nl respectively. Construct the index ICl(Ri, Rk),\nICl(Ri, Rk) =\n{ min{ τlγ , ρl γ }, for i 6= k;\n0, otherwise.\nIn the above definition γ represents the cardinality of the set Pl.\nCase II: Ain 6= Akn Clearly Ri and Rk belong to two different decision\nclasses. Consider the subsets Pi and Qk consisting of members of S that share the same decision with Ri and Rk respectively. Clearly Pi ⋂ Qk = ∅. Based on the type of the attribute of the members, the following situations arise:\n(i) Members of the column Cl of S i.e (A1l, A2l, . . . , Aml)\nT are of nominal or categorical type: Following the procedure discussed in Case I item (i) we write Pl and Ql for each l = 1, 2, . . . , n−1 as a disjoint union of non-empty subsets of Pβ1l , Pβ2l , . . . , Pβrl and Qδ1l , Qδ2l , . . . , Qδsl respectively in which β1l, β2l, . . . , βrl and δ1l, δ2l, . . . , δsl indicate the cardinalities of the respective subsets. We define the indexing measure between the two records Ri and Rk as\nICl(Ri, Rk) =\n{ max{ βrlδsl+βrl , δsl δsl+βrl\n}, for i 6= k; 0, otherwise.\nwhere βrl represents the cardinality of the subset Pβrl all of whose elements have first co-ordinates Ail in set Pl and δsl represents the cardinality of that subset Qδsl , all of whose elements have first co-ordinates Akl in set Ql. (ii) Members of the column Cl of S i.e (A1l, A2l, . . . , Aml)\nT are of numeric type: If the type of the attribute is an integer we follow the procedure discussed in Case II item (i) . For fractional numbers we follow the procedure discussed in Case I item (ii) and we define the set Pl as the members of column Cl that belong to decision class Ain and Ql as the members of column Cl that belong to decision class Akn. We then compute the skewness measure sk(Pl) = 1 m ∑m i=1(Ail−Ail) 3\n( √\n1 m ∑m i=1(Ail−Ail)2)3 where Ail denote\nthe mean of Ail for each l = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1 and sk(Ql) = 1 m ∑m i=1(Akl−Akl) 3\n( √\n1 m ∑m i=1(Akl−Akl)2)3 where Akl denote\nthe mean of Akl for each l = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. We then construct the sets Tl and Sl as follows: Tl = {a ∈ Pl|a ≤ Ail, for sk(Pl) < 0} or, Tl = {b ∈ Pl|b > Ail, for sk(Pl) ≥ 0} and similarly Sl = {a ∈ Pl|a ≤ Akl, for sk(Pl) < 0} or, Sl = {b ∈ Pl|b > Akl, for sk(Pl) ≥ 0}. We now define the index ICl(Ri, Rk) between the two records Ri, Rk as\nICl(Ri, Rk) =\n{ min{βlλ , δl λ }, for i 6= k;\n0, otherwise.\nIn the above definition βl and δl represents the cardinalities of the sets Tl and Sl respectively. The sum of the cardinalities of the sets Pl and Ql is represented by λ\nThe proximity or distance scores between the clinical records in the data set S can be represented as D = {{0, d12, . . . , d1m}; {d21, 0, . . . , d2m}; . . . ; {dm1, dm2, . . . , 0}} where dik = √∑n−1 l=1 I 2 Cl (Ri, Rk). For each of the missing value instances in a record Ri our imputation procedure first computes the score α(xk) =\n(xk−median(x)) median|xi−median(x)| where\n{x1, x2, . . . , xn} denote the distances of R from Rk. We then pick up only those records (nearest neighbors) which satisfy the condition α(xk) ≤ 0 where {di1, di2, . . . , dim} denote the distances of the current record Ri to all other records in the data set S. If the type of attribute is categorical or integer, then the data value that has the highest frequency (mode) of occurrence in the corresponding columns of the nearest records is imputed. For the data values of type real we first collect all non zero elements in the set D and denote this set by B. For each element in set B we compute the quantity β(j)= 1B(j) ∀j = 1, . . . , γ where γ denote the cardinality of the set B. We compute the weight matrix as W (j) =\nβj∑γ i=1 β(i)\n∀j = 1, . . . , γ. The value to be imputed may be taken as ∑γ i=1 P (i) ∗W (i).\nAlgorithm 1 The PRAA Methodology Input: (a) Data sets for the purpose of decision making S(m,n) where m and n are\nnumber of records and attributes respectively and the members of S may have MV in any of the attributes except in the decision attribute, which is the last attribute in the record.\n(b) The type of attribute C of the columns in the data set.

The STULONG dataset is divided into four sub-groups namely Entry, Letter, Control and Death. The Entry dataset consists of 1417 patient records with 64 attributes having either codes or results of size measurements of different variables or results of transformations of the rest of the attributes during the first level examination. We utilize the Entry, Control and Death datasets for our predictive modeling. The Entry level dataset is divided into three groups (a) normal group (NG), (b) pathological group (PG), (c) risk group (RG), and (d) not allotted (NA) group, based on the studied group of patients\n(KONSKUP) in (1, 2), (5), (3, 4), (6) respectively.

An individual is considered to have cardiovascular disease if he or she has history of heart disease (i.e., he or she has at least one positive value on attributes such as myocardial infarction (HODN2), cerebrovascular accident (HODN3), myocardial ischaemia (HODN13), silent myocardial infarction (HODN14)), or died of heart disease (i.e., the record appears in the Death table with PRICUMR attribute equal to 05 (myocardial infarction), 06 (coronary heart disease), 07 (stroke), or 17 (general atherosclerosis)).

Computational Complexity and Scalability of PRAA Algorithm\nThe computational complexity is a measure of the performance of the algorithm which can be measured in terms of the number of CPU clock cycles elapsed in seconds for performing the methodology on a dataset. For each data set having n attributes and m records, we select only those subset of records m1 ≤ m, in which missing values are present. The distances are computed for all attributes n excluding the decision attribute. So, the time complexity for computing the distance would be O(m1 ∗ (n − 1)). The time complexity for computing skewness is O(m1). The time complexity for selecting the nearest records is of order O(m1). For computing the frequency of occurrences for nominal attributes and weighted average for numeric attributes the time taken would be of the order O(m1). Therefore, for a given data set with k-fold cross validation having n attributes and m records, the time complexity of our new imputation algorithm would be k ∗ (O(m1 ∗ (n − 1) ∗m) + 3 ∗ O(m1)) which is asymptotically linear. Our experiments were conducted on a personal computer having an Intel(R) core (TM) 2 Duo, CPU @2.93 GHZ processor with 4 GB RAM and the time taken by PRAA for varying database sizes is shown Fig. 2. We have employed a linear regression on our results and obtained the relation between the time taken (T) and the data size (D) as T = 14.909D− 104.655, α = 0.05, p = 0.0003, r2 = 0.994.\nThe presence of the linear trend between the time taken and the varying database sizes ensure the numerical scalability of the performance of PRAA methodology. A comparison with other related methodologies used in the study of atherosclerosis yields a conclusion that the new PRAA methodology presented in this paper has a superior performance over other methods studied in [5], [24], [22]. We hold the view that more intensive and introspective studies of this kind will pave way for effective risk prediction and diagnosis of atherosclerosis."

The disease progression is slow, asymptomatic and may lead to sudden cardiac arrest, stroke or myocardial infraction. Presently, imaging techniques are being employed to understand the molecular and metabolic activity of atherosclerotic plaques to estimate the risk. Though imaging methods are able to provide some information on plaque metabolism they lack the required resolution and sensitivity for detection. In this paper we consider the clinical observations and habits of individuals for predicting the risk factors of CHD. The identification of risk factors helps in stratifying patients for further intensive tests such as nuclear imaging or coronary angiography. We present a novel approach for predicting the risk factors of atherosclerosis with an in-built imputation algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO). We compare the performance of our methodology with other machine learning techniques on STULONG dataset which is based on longitudinal study of middle aged individuals lasting for twenty years. Our methodology powered by PSO search has identified physical inactivity as one of the risk factor for the onset of atherosclerosis in addition to other already known factors. The decision rules extracted by our methodology are able to predict the risk factors with an accuracy of 99.73% which is higher than the accuracies obtained by application of the state-of-theart machine learning techniques presently being employed in the identification of atherosclerosis risk studies.",
