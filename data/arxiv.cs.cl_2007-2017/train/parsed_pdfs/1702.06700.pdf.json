      "text" : "Visual question answering (VQA) comes as a classic task which combines visual and textual modal data into a unified system. Taking an image and a natural language question about it as input, a VQA system is supposed to output the corresponding natural language answer. VQA problem requires image and text understanding, common sense and knowledge inference. The solution of VQA problem will be a great progress in approaching the goal of Visual Turing Test, and is also conducive to tasks such as multi-modal retrieval, image captioning and accessibility facilities.\nAfter the first attempt and introduction of VQA [21], more than thirty works on VQA have sprung up over the past one year from May, 2015. Over ten VQA datasets\n∗Corresponding author\nR e\nand a big VQA challenge [3] have been proposed so far. Four commonly used datasets (i.e. DAQUAR [21], COCOQA [24], COCO-VQA [3] and Visual7W [36]) feature different aspects. The common practice to tackle VQA problem is to translate the words as word embeddings and encode the questions using bag-of-word (BoW) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, and encode the images using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The following important step is to combine the image and question representations through some kind of fusing methods for answer generation, such as concatenation [35, 22, 6], elementwise multiplication [3], parameter prediction layer [23], episode memory [31], attention mechanism [26, 13, 19], etc. Current VQA works focus on the fusion of these two features, yet no one cares about “where we focus” to ask questions on the image. It is a common practice to treat the VQA problem as either a generation, classification or a scoring task, and classification gains more popularity due to its simplicity and easiness for comparison.\nThese works treat VQA as a discriminative model, learning the conditional probability of answer given the image and question. From the generative view, we emulate the behavior that before people ask questions about the given image they first glance at it and find some interesting regions.\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n06 70\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n2 Fe\nb 20\nIn terms of a single person, he has unique taste for choosing image regions that interest him. For a large amount of people, there are statistical region-of-interest (RoI) distributions. These region patterns are task-driven, e.g. the picture in Figure. 1, for VQA task people may focus mostly on the beds, the chairs, the laptop and the notebook regions (namely the RoI patterns) as captured in the weighted image, but for image captioning task they pay attention to more areas including the striped floor. It is very valuable to intensify the interesting region features and suppress others, and this image preprocessing step provides more accurate visual features to the follow-up steps and is missing in current VQA works. By analogy with visual saliency which captures the standing out regions or objects of an image, we propose a region pre-selection mechanism named task-driven visual saliency which attaches interesting regions (more possibly questioned on) with higher weights. Taking advantage of the bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) [7] that the output at an arbitrary time step has complete and sequential information about all time steps before and after it, we compute the weight of interest for each region feature which is relative to all of them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs and analyzes BiLSTM in VQA models for task-driven saliency detection, and this is the first contribution of our work.\nAs a simple and effective VQA baseline method, [35] shows that question feature always contributes more to predict the answer than image feature. But image is as equally important as question for answer generation. It is necessary to further explore finer-grained image features to achieve better VQA performance, e.g. attention mechanism [32]. Current attention based models generally use the correlation scores between question and image representations as weights to perform weighted sum of region features, the resulting visual vector is concatenated to the question vector for final answer generation. The recent “multi-step” attention models (i.e. containing multiple attention layers) [34, 19] dig deeper into the image understanding and help achieve better VQA performance than the “regular” attention models. However, the correlation score obtained by inner product between visual and textual features is essentially the sum of the correlation vector obtained by elementwise multiplication of the two features. Besides, [3] shows that element-wise multiplication of these features achieves more accurate results than concatenation of them in the baseline model. Hence we propose to employ element-wise multiplication way in the attention mechanism, the fused features are directly feed forward to a max pooling layer to get the final fused feature. Together with the saliency-like region pre-selection operation, this novel attention method effectively improves VQA performance and is the second contribution of this work.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We\nfirst briefly review saliency and the attention mechanism. Then, we elaborate our proposed method. We present experiments of some baseline models and compare with stateof-the-art models and visualize the pre-selection saliency and attention maps. Finally we summarize our work."

      "text" : "Saliency generally comes from contrasts between a pixel or an object and its surroundings, describing how outstanding it is. It could facilitate learning by focusing the most pertinent regions. Saliency detection methods mimic the human attention in psychology, including both bottomup and top-down manners [29]. Typical saliency methods [10, 18] are pixel- or object-oriented, which are not appropriate for VQA due to center bias and are difficulty in collecting large scale eye tracking data.\nWe think task-driven saliency on image features could be conductive to solving VQA problem. What inspires us is that BiLSTM used in saliency detection has achieved good results on text and video tasks. In sentiment classification tasks, [16] assigns saliency scores to words related to sentiment for visualizing and understanding the effects of BiLSTM in textual sentence. While in video highlight detection, [33] uses a recurrent auto-encoder configured with BiLSTM cells and extracts video highlight segments effectively. BiLSTM has demonstrated its effectiveness in saliency detection, but to the best of our knowledge it has not been used in visual saliency for VQA task."

      "heading" : "2.2. Attention in VQA Models",
      "text" : "Visual attention mechanism has drawn great interest in VQA [34, 36, 26] and gained performance improvement from traditional methods using holistic image features. Attention mechanism is typically the weighted sum of the image region features at each spatial location, where the weights describe the correlation and are implemented as the inner products of the question and image features. It explores finer-grained visual features and mimics the behavior that people attend to different areas according to the questions. Focusing on “knowing where to look” for multiplechoice VQA tasks, [26] uses 99 detected object regions plus a holistic image feature to make correlation with the question encoding, and uses the correlation scores as weights to fuse the features. [34] uses the last pooling layer features (512 × 14 × 14) of VGG-19 [27] as image region partitions, and adopts two-layer attention to obtain more effective fused features for complex questions. [2] proposes an ingenious idea to use assembled network modules according to the parsed questions, and achieves multi-step transforming attention by specific rules.\nHowever, these attention methods use correlation score\n(i.e. inner product between visual and textual feature) for each location, which is the sum of the correlation vector representation (i.e. element-wise multiplication between them). Besides, the concatenation of image and question features is less accurate than the element-wise multiplication vector of them shown in the baseline model [3]. Moreover, there are many answers derived from non-object and background regions, e.g. questions about scenes, hence it is not fit for the object detection based attention methods."

      "heading" : "3. Proposed Method",
      "text" : "Compared with image captioning which generates general descriptions about an image, VQA focuses on specific image regions depending on the question. On the one hand, these regions include non-object and background contents which are hard for object detection based VQA methods. On the other hand, although people may ask questions at any areas of a given image, there are always some region patterns that attract more questions. On the whole, there are statistical region-of-interest (RoI) patterns which represent human-interested areas that are important for later VQA task. We propose a saliency-like region pre-selection and attention-based VQA framework illustrated in Figure. 2. The VQA is regarded as a classification task, which is simple and easy to transform to a generating or scoring model."

      "heading" : "3.1.1 Image Feature Pre-selection",
      "text" : "As described above, current object detection based VQA methods may not be qualified and the answers may not be derived from these specific object regions in images, for example, when asked “Where is the bird/cat?”, the answers “fence/sink” are not contained in ILSVRC [25] (200 categories) and Pascal VOC [5] (20 categories) detection classes. Thus we use a more general pattern detector.\nIn addition, from the generative perspective, we pay attention to where people focus to ask questions. General visual saliency provides analogous useful information of noticeable objects or areas which outstand the surroundings, but it is not the only case for VQA task. Current attention mechanism relates the question to the focusing location. As more samples are available, we could yield the region patterns that attract more questions by statistics. From the statistical behavior of large amounts of workers on Amazon\nMechanical Turk (AMT) who have labeled the questions, we model the region-of-interest patterns that could attract more questions.\nWe propose to perform saliency-like pre-selection operation to alleviate the problems and model the RoI patterns. The image is first divided into g × g grids as illustrated in Figure. 2. Takingm×m grids as a region, with s grids as the stride, we obtain n×n regions, where n = ⌊ g−m s ⌋ +1. We then feed the regions to a pre-trained ResNet [8] deep convolutional neural network to produce n×n×dI -dimensional region features, where dI is the dimension of feature from the layer before the last fully-connected layer.\nSince the neighboring overlapped regions share some visual contents, the corresponding features are related but focusing on different semantic information. We regard the sequence of regions as the result of eye movement when glancing at the image, and these regions are selectively allocated different degrees of interest. Specifically, the LSTM is a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN), capable of learning long-term dependencies via the memory cell and the update gates, which endows itself with the ability to retain information of previous time-steps (i.e. the previous region sequence in this case). The update rules of the LSTM at time step t are as follows:\nit = σ(W (i)xt + U (i)ht−1 + b (i)), (1)\nft = σ(W (f)xt + U (f)ht−1 + b (f)), (2)\not = σ(W (o)xt + U (o)ht−1 + b (o)), (3)\nut = tanh(W (u)xt + U (u)ht−1 + b (u)), (4)\nct = ut it + ct−1 ft, (5) ht = ot tanh(ct), (6)\nwhere i, f, o denote the input, forget and output gates, x, c, h are the input region feature, memory cell and hidden unit output, and W,U, b are the parameters to be trained. We activate the gates by the sigmoid nonlinearity σ(x) = 1/(1+ e−x) and the cell contents by the hyperbolic tangent tanh(x) = (ex − e−x)/(ex + e−x). The gates control the information in the memory cell to be retained or forgotten through element-wise multiplication .\nInspired by the information completeness and high performance of BiLSTM, we encode the region features in two directions using BiLSTM and obtain a scalar output per region. The output of the BiLSTM is the summation of the forward and backward LSTM outputs at this region location: ht = h (f) t + h (b) n−t+1, where n is the number of regions, h(f)t , h (b) n−t+1 are computed using Eq. 6. Hence, the output at each location is influenced by the region features before and after it, which embodies the correlation among these regions. Note that, although the DMN+ work [31] uses similar bi-directional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) in the visual input module, their purpose is to produce input\nfacts which contain global information. Besides, their BiGRU takes the features embedded to the textual space as inputs. In contrast, the BiLSTM used in our model takes directly visual CNN features as input, and the main purpose is to output weights for region feature selection.\nThe output values of the BiLSTM are normalized through a softmax layer, and the resulting weights are multiplied by the region features. We treat the weights as degree of interest which are trained by error back-propagation of the final class cross entropy losses, and higher weights embody that the corresponding region patterns will attract more questions, in other words, these region patterns may get higher attention values in the latter interaction with question embeddings in a statistical way."

      "text" : "Question can be encoded using various kinds of natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as BoW, LSTM, CNN [20, 34], gated recurrent units (GRU) [4], skipthought vectors [14], or it can be parsed by Stanford Parser [15], etc. Since question BoW encodings already dominate the contribution to answer generation compared with the image features [35], we simply encode the question word as word2vec embedding, and use LSTM to encode the questions to match the pre-selected region features. To encode more abstract and higher-level information and achieve better performance, a deeper LSTM [3, 12] for question encoding is adopted in our model.\nThe question encoding LSTM in our model has l hidden layers with r hidden units per layer, and the question representation is the last output and the cell units of the LSTM,\nand the dimension is dQ = 2 × l × r. The resulting condensed feature vector encodes the semantic and syntactic information of the question."

      "text" : "According to the statistic image-question-answer (IQA) training triples, the image feature pre-selection has attached the regions with different prior weights, generating more meaningful region features. But different questions may focus on different aspects of the visual content. It is necessary to use attention mechanism to second select regions by the question for more effective features.\nWe propose a novel attention method, which takes the element-wise multiplication vector as correlation between image and question features at each spatial location. Specifically, given the pre-selected region features and question embedding, we map the visual and textual features into a common space of dC dimension and perform element-wise multiplication between them. The n× n× dC-dimensional fused features contain visual and textual information, and higher responses indicate more correlative features. In traditional attention models, the correlation score (scalar) achieved by inner product between the mapped visual and textual features per region, is essentially the sum of elements in our fused feature. This novel attention method has two noticeable advantages against traditional attention, i.e. information richer correlation vector versus correlation scalar, more effective element-wise multiplication vector versus the concatenated vector of the visual and textual features.\nSince higher responses in the fused features indicate\nmore correlative visual and textual features, and the question may only focus on one or two regions. We choose to apply max pooling operation on the intermediate fused features to pick out the maximum responses. The produced dC-dimensional fused feature is then fed to the final answer generation part. Compared to the sum/average operation in traditional attention models, the max operation highlights the responses of the final fused feature from every spatial location."

We use a linear layer and a softmax layer to map from the fused feature to the answer candidates, of which the entries are the top-1000 answers from the training data.\nConsidering multiple choice VQA problems, e.g. Visual7W [36] telling questions and COCO-VQA [3] multiple choice tasks, our model is adaptive to be extended by concatenating the question and answer vectors before fusion with visual features or by using bilinear model between the final fused feature and answer feature [26, 11], which is a possible future work.

Then we extract the 2048-D feature per region from the layer before the last fully-connected layer of ResNet. The dimension of word embedding is 200, and the weights of the embedding are initialized randomly from a uniform distribution on [−0.08, 0.08) due to similar performance as the pre-trained one.

While for question “What is the boy doing?”, it attends the boy and the snowboard, thus giving answer “snowboarding”.

Many enlightening VQA works explore deep into the image and question encodings and fusing methods, of which attention is the most effective and infusive mechanism. Current attention based methods focus on adequate fusion of visual and textual features, but lack the attention to where people focus to ask questions about the image. Traditional attention based methods attach a single value to the feature at each spatial location, which losses many useful information. To remedy these problems, we propose a general method to perform saliency-like pre-selection on overlapped region features by the interrelation of bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and use a novel element-wise multiplication based attention method to capture more competent correlation information between visual and textual features. We conduct experiments on the large-scale COCO-VQA dataset and analyze the effectiveness of our model demonstrated by strong empirical results.",
