Knowledge graphs, aside from being a popular universal representation of knowledge such as ConceptNet or WordNet, are also widely adopted in practical applications. Examples of popular large scale knowledge graphs include YAGO, Freebase and Google Knowledge Graph. Given the immense popularity in many AI applications, reasoning with knowledge graphs is an extremely desirable technique. In this context, machine learning algorithms for relational reasoning are highly sought a er.\nAt its core, relational learning aims to reason and infer probabilistic estimates regarding new or unseen facts in knowledge graphs. Intuitively, this supports applications ranging from knowledge graph completion to recommendation systems. Recently, many state-of-the-art relational learning techniques [4, 9, 22, 30] have been proposed. ese techniques, which can also be considered as representation learning techniques, are concerned with modeling multi-relational data in latent space and learning continuous vector representations of entities and relations in KGs. rough reasoning in latent embedding space, probabilistic estimates can be inferred which contribute to alleviating the intrinsic problem of knowledge graph incompleteness. Furthermore, relations in knowledge graphs can be extremely sparse [38] in which relational information might be insu cient for making solid predictions or recommendations.\nUnfortunately and additionally, many of the state-of-the-art approaches are solely focused on exploiting structural information and neglect the rich a ribute information that are readily available in knowledge graphs. Intuitively, a ribute information can richly characterize entities that would help combat relational sparsity. As such, in this paper, we propose that this information should be and can be easily incorporated into relational learning algorithms in order to improve the relational learning and at the same time, enable prediction of these non-discrete a ribute information. To this end, we propose an end-to-end multi-task neural network. To give readers a be er insight behind our intuitions and motivations behind this work, we begin by providing some context pertaining to the problem at hand."

      "heading" : "1.1 Motivation",
      "text" : "Firstly and naturally, non-discrete a ributes are commonplace in many KGs. For example, non-discrete a ributes such as the price of a product (iPhone, hasPrice, 1000) or the height of an actor (DanielRadcli e, hasHeight, 1.7m) are o en present in knowledge graphs.\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n04 82\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 6\nA ug\n2 01\nAs such, our work is mainly concerned with both leveraging these non-discrete a ributes to improve the relational learning process and enable prediction of these a ributes. To this end, we answer the following four important questions:\n(1) Can a ribute information really help in relational learning? (2) Why do we want to predict a ributes? (3) Are there so many a ributes in KGs? (4) Why is this di cult?\n1.1.1 Can a ribute information really help in relational learning? Consider a relational learning task of completing the following triplet - (person, hasGender, ?). Traditionally, relational learning exploits statistical pa erns across relations to make predictions. e rule R1: (personA, isMotherOf, personB)→ (personA, hasGender, Female) is an example of what relational learning models are capable of learning in order to make predictions. However, statistical information available through relations can be really sparse. Additionally, knowledge graphs can also be highly incomplete. As such, there is a good chance that, at test time, an entity arrives without any relation such as (isMotherOf) to make an informed decision. is is where a ribute information can be complementary and also enhance the relational learning model. In this case, it might be possible that the (hasHeight) a ribute alone is able to allow the model to predict the gender correctly. Intuitively, a ribute information can richly characterize entities in a knowledge graph. In the studied example, the non-discrete value of the a ribute (hasHeight) is strongly correlated with the relation (hasGender). In another context, the height or weight a ributes of entities (such as products) may allow relational learning models to di erentiate between cars and iphones. Intuitively, this can be also seen as leveraging entity schema information. erefore, we believe that a ribute information that can richly characterize entities will provide relational learning models with valuable knowledge.\n1.1.2 Why do we want to predict a ributes? Additionally, the importance of non-discrete a ributes goes beyond serving as an auxiliary information source but also as a prediction target. ere are mainly two ways to interpret this task. Firstly, it can be interpreted as using relational structural information as features for a regression task which forms a huge chunk of standard machine learning tasks in both research and industry. In this case there is a target a ribute that is important to be predicted such as sales forecast, the GPA of a student, or prices of products. Secondly, the motivation of a ribute prediction can also be considered identical to that of knowledge graph completion for relational triplets, e.g., a person’s height might be missing in the knowledge graph and a ribute value prediction can help infer this information.\n1.1.3 Are there so many a ributes in KGs? For each entity in knowledge graphs such as Freebase, a list of relevant a ributes are maintained. In the Freebase dump Easy Freebase [2], there are already 27 million non-discrete a ribute triplets (≈ 10%). In our extracted Freebase subgraph, we easily obtain a percentage of ≈ 33% non-discrete a ribute triplets. Hence, this further motivates our problem, i.e., we are ensured that there is su cient and reasonable amount of a ribute information. Additionally, the non-discrete nature of a ributes suggests that each triplet contains more encoded information over binary-natured relational triplets. Table 1\ndescribes some common non-discrete a ributes and their respective entity types from Freebase.\n1.1.4 Why is this di icult? Knowledge graphs are typically considered as 3D graphs, i.e., (head, relation, tail). Non-discrete attributes, can o en act as relations in which their a ributes are binned and casted as entities. However, this can easily cause the size of the knowledge graph to blow up and aggravate the scalability issue faced by many relational learning techniques. A ributes, intuitively speaking, seem to cast knowledge graphs out of its comfort zone of binary truths (0 or 1). As such, there are limited works that a empt to exploit a ribute information in the se ing of KGs [28]. While this has been done on bipartite graphs or similar networks with only one entity type, the diversity of entity types in KGs can be large. In these cases, the feature vectors of a ributes can be extremely sparse and ine ective when there are a signi cant number of entity types in the knowledge base. Moreover, incorporating feature vectors of a ributes will not enable the model to predict a ribute values. Overall, it is evident that many of the current approaches do not handle such information and more o en than not discard these a ributes completely during the training process."

      "heading" : "2.1 Problem Formulation and Notation",
      "text" : "In this section, we brie y describe the notation used in this paper along with a simple introduction of relational learning problems.\n2.1.1 Notation. Let ∆ = (E,R) denote a knowledge graph. E = {e1, e2...e |E |} is the set of all entities, and R = {r1, r2...r |R |} is the set of all relations. A relational triplet ξi ∈ ξ is de ned as (ei , rk , ej ) where two entities are in a relation rk and can be interpreted as a fact that exists in the knowledge graph ∆. Since a ributes are speci c to our model, we introduce them in later sections. For latent embedding models, entities ei ∈ E and relation ri ∈ R are o en represented as real-valued vector or matrix representations. In order to facilitate such a design, embedding matricesWe ∈ R |E |×n and likewise,Wr ∈ R |R |×n are parameters of the model. To select the relevant entity or relation, we can simply perform a look-up operation via one-hot vector. As such, the inputs to our model are o en represented as indices that map into these embedding matrices.\n2.1.2 Problem Formulation. ere are mainly two popular relational learning tasks, namely triplet classi cation and link prediction. Simply speaking, the goals of both tasks are similar and are complementary to many semantic applications. Making probabilistic recommendations and mitigating the inherent incompleteness of knowledge graphs are examples of such applications. As such, the crux of many relational learning tasks is to produce a score\ns(ei , rk , ej ) ∈ [0, 1] (1)\nthat denotes the probability or strength of a fact or triplet. Naturally, similar to many ranking problems or classi cation problems, this task can be casted into three di erent variations, i.e., pointwise, pairwise and listwise. Pointwise considers a simple binary classi - cation problem in which a sigmoid or 2-class so max layer might be used. Pairwise tries to maximize the margin between the golden facts and negative (corrupted) samples. e pairwise hinge loss can\nbe described as follows: L = ∑ ξ ∈∆ ∑ ξ ′<∆ max(0,El (ξ ) + λ − El (ξ ′)) (2)\nFinally, listwise considers all candidate entities, i.e., for (ei , rk , ?), consider all ej ∈ E. Since the listwise approach is rarely used in the literature of relational learning, we do not consider the listwise approach in our paper. Moreover, the pairwise and listwise approaches require a signi cant amount of implementation e ort over the pointwise approach and as such, we consider a pointwise approach when designing our model. Finally and also intuitively, the pairwise and listwise approaches are also not suitable for attribute value regression."

      "text" : "In this section, we give a brief overview of the existing state-ofthe-art neural network (NN) approaches for relational learning. Neural networks are connectionist models that form the heart of the deep learning revolution. e key driving force behind these models are that the parameters are learned via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and backpropagation. ere are two popular neural network approaches for relational learning. e rst approach is the ER-MLP (Entity Relation Multi-Layered Perceptron) which was incepted as part of the Google Knowledge Vault Project [9]. e other approach is the Neural Tensor Network (NTN) [30] which models multiple views of dyadic interactions between entities with tensor products.\n2.2.1 ER-MLP. ER-MLP was studied as a simple neural baseline for relational learning in the Google Knowledge Vault Project. e scoring function of ER-MLP can be represented as follows:\ns(ei , rk , ej ) = σ (®v> f (W>ϕ [ ®ei ; ®ej ; ®rk ])) (3)\nwhere f is a non-linear activation function such as tanh applied element-wise. v ∈ Rh×1 and Wϕ ∈ R3n×h are parameters of the network. σ is the sigmoid function. h is the size of the hidden layer and n is the size of the embeddings. [; ] denotes a concatenation operator. Intuitively, ER-MLP extracts the embeddings of the entities and relations involved in the triplet and simply concatenates them. Despite its simplicity, it has been proven to be able to produce highly competitive performance in relational learning tasks.\n2.2.2 Neural Tensor Network (NTN). is highly expressive neural model was rst incepted in the elds of NLP for sentiment analysis and subsequently applied in multiple domains such as knowledge base completion [30] and question answering [29, 33]. e key intuition behind NTN is that it models multiple views of dyadic interactions between entities with a relation-speci c tensor [30]. NTN is the most expressive amongst the relational neural networks due to the high number of parameters and incredible modeling capability. e scoring function of NTN is de ned as follows:\ns(ei , rk , ej ) = u>rk f (e > i W [1:s] rk ej +Vrk [ ®ei ; ®ej ] + brk ) (4)\nwhere f is a nonlinear function applied element-wise. W [1:s]R ∈ Rn×n×k is a tensor and each bilinear product e>i W [k ] rk ej results in a scalar value. e scalar values across s slices are concatenated\nto form the output vector h ∈ Rk . e other parameters are in the standard form of neural networks."

While there have been many extensions [17, 22, 31, 36, 37] over this model, the key intuition behind translational embedding models is the concept of the translation principle, i.e., |ei + rk − ej | = 0 for a golden fact.\nOn the other hand, the rst and early latent embedding models for relational learning are mostly based on tensor factorization which exploits the fact that knowledge graphs inherently follow a 3D structure. Speci cally, the general purpose Candecomp (CP) decomposition [5] was rst used in [10] to rank triplets in a semantic web se ing. Nickel et al. then proposed RESCAL [16, 28] which is an improved tensor factorization technique based on the bilinear form for relational learning. Subsequently, extensions of RESCAL such as TRESCAL [7] and RSTE [32] were proposed.\nIt is easy to see that all latent embedding models can be interpreted as neural architectures. Speci cally, in a review work by Nickel et al. [26], the tensor factorization model RESCAL is casted as a neural network. As such, the scoring function of RESCAL is de ned as:\nд(ei , rk , ej ) =W >k ( ®ej ⊗ ®ei ) (5) where Wk is a relation-speci c parameter of the network and ⊗ is the tensor product. We can easily see that the parameterW ∈ R |k |×n×n is the middle tensor in the original RESCAL. Likewise, CP can also be casted similarly but we omit the discussion due to the lack of space. Similarly, translational embedding models, i.e., TransE, TransR, etc. are all neural architectures that optimize parameters via gradient descent."

In [28], the authors proposed to use a separate matrix factorization to learn a ributes. However, the authors only explore the possibility of adding tokenized text a ributes. Furthermore, a huge problem is that each a ribute would require an additional matrix factorization operation which can be impractical. A recent work, KR-EAR [21] is a translational embedding model that was proposed to model ‘a ribute information’. eir main idea is that modeling a ributes separately can result in be er relational learning performance. However, their approach is concerned with relations that are actually a ributes, e.g, gender is an a ribute that is o en considered as a relation in most KGs. is means their approach only works with prior knowledge of knowing which relation should have been an a ribute. Furthermore, their approach does not deal with non-discrete data types. As a result, though deceptively similar, our work is distinctly di erent from theirs and cannot be meaningfully compared.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no approach that is able to elegantly incorporate continuous a ribute information in the context of relational learning. is can be a ributed to the inherent di culty of dealing with non-discrete oat data types in the context of the binary-natured KG.

Similar to RelNet, we train a single hidden layer network by concatenation of the a ribute and entity embeddings to predict the continuous value which is a normalized value ∈ [0, 1]. However, there are two entities in each relational triplet ξi ∈ ξ , namely the head and tail entities. erefore, there are two sides to A rNet which are described as A rNet (le ) and A rNet (right) as shown in Figure 1. e motivation of using two networks are as follows: since entities in knowledge graphs are generally considered as antisymmetric relations, e.g., entities behave di erently when they are at the head or tail position, we design the network in order to capture this relational information. As such, A rNet optimizes a joint loss function of both regression tasks. We de ne the score functions as follows:\nдh (ai ) = σ (®u> f (B>[ ®ai ; ®ei ]) + bz1 ) (8)\nдt (aj ) = σ (®y> f (C>[ ®aj ; ®ej ]) + bz2 ) (9) where u,y ∈ Rha×1 and B,C ∈ R2n×ha are parameters of A rNet. ha is the size of the hidden layer and bz1 ,bz2 are scalar biases.

Similar to many other multitask learning techniques [23], both RelNet and A rNet are trained in an alternating fashion. Note that the input vector of A rNet contains a ributes belonging to the head and tail entities contained within the relational triplet. is not only optimizes the parameters of the network with both relational and a ribute information but also allows A rNet to gain some structural and relational context. e overall learning process can be summarized as follows:\n• Relational Training (RT) - Sample a relational triplet and train RelNet (line 7). • Attribute Training (AT) - Build input for A rNet, i.e., for each entity, head and tail in the triplet, randomly sample an a ribute to form the input vector. If either entity has no a ribute, then append a zero vector, i.e., [0,0] to the side of A rNet that corresponds to this entity (line 9). e parameters of A rNet are then updated as we train A rNet (line 10).\nAlgorithm 1 Multi-Task Knowledge Graph Neural Network Input: KG ∆, rel triplets ξ , a r triplets ψ , batch size=β , model hyperpa-\nrameters Output: Trained Model Parameters θ = {θr , θa }\n1: E, R, A← all entities, relations and a ributes in ξ respectively 2: Initialize uniform (− 6√\nk , 6√ k ) for ei ∈ E, ri ∈ R, ai ∈ A\n3: Initialize random normal N(0,1) for θr = { ®w, ®v, D } 4: Initialize random normal N(0,1) for θa = { ®u, ®v, B, C } 5: for each epoch do 6: χr ← shu e(χr ) 7: χr ← sample batch of size β from ξ 8: θr , E, R ← Update w.r.t Lr el (χr ) 9: χa ← buildA ributes(ψ , χr )\n10: θa, E, A← Update w.r.t Lattr (χa ) 11: for each k do 12: i ← sample random a ribute from A 13: ψ i ← select all a r triplets containing i 14: χ ia ← sample batch of size β from ψ i 15: θa, E, A← Update w.r.t Lattr (χ ia ) 16: end for 17: end for\n3.5.2 A ribute Specific Training (AST). Next, we introduce an alternative method for training a ributes which corresponds to line 11 to line 15 in Algorithm 1. We call this process A ribute Speci c Training (AST) which may be used in conjunction with A ribute Training (AT) or to replace the A ribute Training step mentioned earlier. In this step, we train A rNet an additional k times in an attribute speci c manner, i.e., for k times, we sample an a ribute and select β a ribute triplets, and run them through A rNet (both le and right). e key intuition here is that we want to supply the network with a ribute information in an orderly\na ribute-speci c and focused fashion which allows the model to concentrate on a single a ribute. Furthermore, this also controls the amount of a ribute information that is learned relative to the relational information since each AST call essentially trains the network once with a ribute information. Empirically, we found that for both triplet classi cation and a ribute value prediction, using AST improves the performance.\n3.5.3 Regularization. Finally, the last post-processing step that our model takes is to normalize all embeddings to be constrained within the Euclidean ball. At the end of training RelNet and A rNet (multiple times due to AST), we apply the constraints of |e∗ |2 ≤ 1, |r∗ |2 ≤ 1 and |a∗ |2 ≤ 1 for regularization and preventing over ing. Moreover, we apply dropout of d = 0.5 at the hidden layers of both RelNet and A rNet.\n3.5.4 Shared Representations. In a nutshell, the core motivation to this multi-task scheme is as follows: Since the entity embeddings ®ei ∈ E are used in both Lattr and Lr el when RelNet and A rNet are trained separately, the entity embeddings are updated from both tasks. As such, the entity embeddings are learned from both the relational task as well as the a ribute task."

Similar to space complexity, this is still less operations compared to models requiring operations in quadratic scale such as TransR, NTN or RESCAL."

YAGO contains many famous places and people which naturally contain many a ribute values such as height, weight, age, population size, etc. We construct a subset of YAGO by removing entities that appear less than 25 times and further ltered away entities that do not contain a ribute information. We name our dataset YG24K since it contains ≈ 24K entities. • Freebase [3] is a widely used benchmark knowledge base for many relational learning tasks. We use the dataset dump Easy Freebase [2] since the public API is no longer available. Due to the large size of Freebase, we extract a domain-speci c dataset from Easy Freebase involving organizations. e construction of this dataset is detailed as follows: – We randomly selected entities of type organization\nand selected 22 relations that are closely related to the domain such as (industry), (school type), (academic adviser) and (founded by). – Subsequently, using these seed entity nodes we randomly included relational and a ribute triplets within a k-hop distance. Examples of a ributes in this dataset include (num employees), (num postgraduates) and (height), etc. e end result is a dataset with 28K entities which we call FB28K. Note that since we applied the random k-hop selection of nodes in the knowledge graph, the extracted subgraph would contain entities and relations across several domains.\nFor all datasets, we split the relational and a ribute triplets into an 80/10/10 split of train/development/test. Subsequently, we lter triplets in the test and development sets that contain entities not found in the training set. e statistics of the two datasets is given in Table 3.\nOn FB28K, 33% of the total number of triplets are a ribute triplets. On the other hand, 15% of the total number of triplets in YG24K are a ribute triplets."

We follow the experimental procedure of [30] closely. e aim of this experiment is to show that additional a ribute information help in standard relational learning tasks.\n4.4.1 Evaluation Procedure and Metrics. In order to perform classi cation, we perform negative sampling following [30]. For each positive triplet in our train/development/test sets, we include a corrupt triplet. We do this by randomly replacing either the head or tail entity. e nal positive to negative ratio is therefore 1:1. For evaluation purposes, we use two popular metrics for binary classi cation, namely accuracy and AUC (Area Under Curve). Regarding the metric of accuracy, we determine a threshold where scores above are classi ed as positive and vice versa. is threshold is determined by maximizing the accuracy across the development set.\n4.4.2 Experimental Results. Table 4 shows the results of the triplet classi cation experiment. Our proposed MT-KGNN achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both YG24K and FB28K. Our proposed approach outperforms the baseline ER-MLP by at least 2% − 3% and models like TransE by 3% − 4%. is suggests that our multi-task learning scheme is highly e ective for the relational learning task. Evidently, the a ribute information is able to increase the accuracy by 3% in both datasets and as a whole achieve about an improvement of > 5% − 6% accuracy as compared to models such as CP or TransR. Pertaining to the relative performance of the compared baselines, the best performing result is obtained from ER-MLP. On the other hand, NTN produces poorer results. We also observe that models of higher complexity seem to perform worse than their counterparts with smaller number of parameters. For example, RESCAL performs be er than NTN, and TransE outperforms TransR."

      "heading" : "4.5 Experiment 2 - Attribute Value Prediction",
      "text" : "In this task, we evaluate the capability of our model to perform regression, i.e., predictions of non-discrete a ributes in KGs. For all compared baselines other than ours, prediction is performed using a ribute-speci c Linear Regression classi ers trained using the learned embeddings as features. Apart from validating the performance of our proposed model, the additional aims of this experiment are as follows:\n(1) RQ1: In the context of a ribute prediction, are there useful information encoded in entity embeddings produced by relational learning models? (2) RQ2: Is there any di erence between di erent relational learning models in encoding a ribute information, e.g., is TransE or RESCAL be er than ER-MLP when the learned embeddings are used as features? (3) RQ3: Which is be er for encoding a ribute information? Knowledge graph embeddings or word embeddings?\ne impact of this experiment is meaningful as it derives insight regarding the plausibility of knowledge graph embeddings as features for standard machine learning tasks. Note that the usage of supervised classi ers for evaluating the quality of embeddings has been substantiated in many works [12, 24].\n4.5.1 Implementation Details. For all KG embedding methods, we train embeddings of size n = 50 for 500 iterations with the same se ings as Experiment 1. By using these embeddings as features, we train a separate linear regression classi er using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with learning rate amongst {10−2, 10−3, 10−4} for 25 epochs since we empirically found that 25 epochs are su cient for the model to converge on the development set. Similar to the rst experiment, we report the performance of the model that performed best on the development set.\n4.5.2 Additional Baselines. Aside from knowledge graph embeddings, we also introduce several baselines.\n• Random Guess (R-GUESS) randomly generates a value v ∈ [0, 1] as a prediction. • Random Init (R-INIT) trains the supervised classi er\non an embedding matrix that is initialized randomly with U (−0.01, 0.01). As such, the purpose is to detect if the knowledge graph embedding is producing be er performance than random. • SkipGram [25] or also known as Word2Vec is a highly popular language modeling approach that learns continuous vector representations of words from textual documents. For SkipGram, we use the pre-trained vectors of 300 dimensions released by Google. For each entity in the KG, we form a term embedding by averaging the vectors of multiple words.\nFor our proposed approach, we use the MT-KGNN network directly for prediction. For this task, we removed the optional a ribute training step and simply use AST with k = 4.\n4.5.3 Evaluation Metrics. In this task, we use three popular evaluation metrics for evaluating the regression problem, namely the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R2 (R squared). ese metrics are de ned as follows:\nRMSE = √ 1 n n∑ i=1 (yi − ŷi )2 (14)\nMAE = 1 n n∑ i=1 |yi − ŷi | (15)\nR2 = 1 − ∑n i=1(yi − ŷi )2∑n i=1 (ŷi − ȳi )2\n(16)\nwhere yi is the ground truth, ŷi is the prediction and ȳi is the mean y value. RMSE and MAE measure the t of the prediction by reporting the amount of error relative to the ground truth. e main di erence is that RMSE penalizes larger mistakes to a larger extent due to its quadratic nature. e R2 metric is a common metric in linear regression that expresses the percentage of the variation in the ground truth that is explained by the prediction. Note that the R2 metric can result in negative values which essentially means that the prediction ts worse than a horizontal line.\n4.5.4 Experimental Results. Table 5 reports the results of the a ribute value prediction. Firstly, we observe that MT-KGNN achieves the best results. Moreover, there is a distinct and signi - cant margin as compared to all other relational learning methods. Notably, there is about≈ 30% decrease in RMSE across both datasets relative to almost all relational learning embedding models. In addition, our model is the only model that achieves a decent R2 score (> 0). Hence, to the best of our knowledge, our approach is the only model that is able to predict a ribute values in knowledge graphs by exploiting relational information without the use of any feature engineering. Moreover, aside from relation-speci c linear regression models that have to be built for each relation, our model handles this with only a single model that works with all a ributes collectively.\nSecondly, we observe that relational learning models perform signi cantly be er over R-INIT and R-GUESS. As such, we can conclude that there is at least some useful information encoded in relational learning models that are useful for a ribute prediction. is answers RQ1 though we believe that the information encoded to be minimal. irdly, we observe that the performance of all relational learning baselines are relatively indistinguishable from one another. e performance of TransE, TransR, NTN, RESCAL, ER-MLP and CP produce approximately similar results. As such, pertaining to RQ2, we conclude that the performance of di erent relational learning models do not di er much from each other. Finally, the performance of SkipGram is slightly worse than relational learning models. To answer RQ3, we are able to conclude, based\non the empirical evidence, that relational learning models produce slightly more useful features compared to word embeddings."

Secondly, we extract the a ribute embeddings from MT-KGNN and analyze them.\n4.6.1 Ablation Studies. Table 6 reports our ablation study on FB28K for a ribute value prediction. Speci cally, we removed RelNet and AST from MT-KGNN to see how much each process contributes to the overall performance of MT-KGNN. Naturally, AST would be expected to be more important. As such, the main investigation is pertaining to the e ect of relational triplets on a ribute prediction. We observe that there are indeed observable improvements in performance when using RelNet. For instance, the R2 metric is improved by 17 points while MAE and RMSE are also improved considerably.\n4.6.2 alitative Analysis. In this section, we inspect the learned a ribute representations of our proposed MT-KGNN. Using cosine similarity, we nd the nearest neighbors of the a ribute embeddings. Table 7 shows some examples. It can be clearly seen semantically relevant a ributes are closer to each other in the vector space. For example, num postgraduates and num undergraduates are close in the vector space probably due to their belonging to similar entities (universities). Additionally, a ributes such as oors, space and height are a ributes belonging to building entities. As such, this ascertains the representation learning ability of our model since semantically similar a ributes are clustered together in the vector space."

It has demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance in the relational task of triplet classication and a ribute value prediction. In both tasks, we observe that the relational and a ribute information are complementary to each other."

    "abstractText" : "Many popular knowledge graphs such as Freebase, YAGO or DBPedia maintain a list of non-discrete aributes for each entity. Intuitively, these aributes such as height, price or population count are able to richly characterize entities in knowledge graphs. is additional source of information may help to alleviate the inherent sparsity and incompleteness problem that are prevalent in knowledge graphs. Unfortunately, many state-of-the-art relational learning models ignore this information due to the challenging nature of dealing with non-discrete data types in the inherently binary-natured knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for both encoding and prediction of non-discrete aribute information in a relational setting. Specically, we train a neural network for triplet prediction along with a separate network for aribute value regression. Via multi-task learning, we are able to learn representations of entities, relations and aributes that encode information about both tasks. Moreover, such aributes are not only central to many predictive tasks as an information source but also as a prediction target. erefore, models that are able to encode, incorporate and predict such information in a relational learning context are highly aractive as well. We show that our approach outperforms many state-ofthe-art methods for the tasks of relational triplet classication and aribute value prediction.",
