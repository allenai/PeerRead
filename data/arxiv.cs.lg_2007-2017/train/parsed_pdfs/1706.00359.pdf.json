      "text" : "Probabilistic models for inducing latent topics from documents are one of the great success stories of unsupervised learning. Starting with latent semantic analysis (LSA (Landauer et al., 1998)), models for uncovering the underlying semantic structure of a document collection have been widely applied in data mining, text processing and information retrieval. Probabilistic topic models (e.g. PLSA (Hofmann, 1999), LDA (Blei et al., 2003) and HDPs (Teh et al., 2006)) provide a robust, scalable, and theoretically sound foundation for document modelling by introducing latent variables for each token to topic assignment.\nFor the traditional Dirichlet-Multinomial topic model, efficient inference is available by exploiting conjugacy with\n1University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom 2DeepMind, London, United Kingdom.

Copyright 2017 by the author(s).\neither Monte Carlo or Variational techniques (Jordan et al., 1999; Attias, 2000; Beal, 2003)). However, as topic models have grown more expressive, in order to capture topic dependencies or exploit conditional information, inference methods have become increasingly complex. This is especially apparent for non-conjugate models (Carlin & Polson, 1991; Blei & Lafferty, 2007; Wang & Blei, 2013).\nDeep neural networks are excellent function approximators and have shown great potential for learning complicated non-linear distributions for unsupervised models. Neural variational inference (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014; Mnih & Gregor, 2014) approximates the posterior of a generative model with a variational distribution parameterised by a neural network. This allows both the generative model and the variational network to be jointly trained with backpropagation. For models with continuous latent variables associated with particular distributions, such as Gaussians, there exist reparameterisations (Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) of the distribution permitting unbiased and low-variance estimates of the gradients with respect to the parameters of the inference network. For models with discrete latent variables, MonteCarlo estimates of the gradient must be employed. Recently, algorithms such as REINFORCE have been used effectively to decrease variance and improve learning (Mnih & Gregor, 2014; Mnih et al., 2014).\nIn this work we propose and evaluate a range of topic models parameterised with neural networks and trained with variational inference. We introduce three different neural structures for constructing topic distributions: the Gaussian Softmax distribution (GSM), the Gaussian Stick Breaking distribution (GSB), and the Recurrent Stick Breaking process (RSB), all of which are conditioned on a draw from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian Softmax topic model constructs a finite topic distribution with a softmax function applied to the projection of the Gaussian random vector. The Gaussian Stick Breaking model also constructs a discrete distribution from the Gaussian draw, but this time employing a stick breaking construction to provide a bias towards sparse topic distributions. Finally, the Recurrent Stick Breaking process employs a recurrent neural network, again conditioned on the Gaussian draw, to progressively break the stick, yielding a neural analog of a Dirichlet Process topic model (Teh et al., 2006). ar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n00 35\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nJ un\n2 01\n7\nOur neural topic models combine the merits of both neural networks and traditional probabilistic topic models. They can be trained efficiently by backpropagation, scaled to large data sets, and easily conditioned on any available contextual information. Further, as probabilistic graphical models, they are interpretable and explicitly represent the dependencies amongst the random variables. Previous neural document models, such as the neural variational document model (NVDM) (Miao et al., 2016), belief networks document model (Mnih & Gregor, 2014), neural auto-regressive document model (Larochelle & Lauly, 2012) and replicated softmax (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2009), have not explicitly modelled latent topics. Through evaluations on a range of data sets we compare our models with previously proposed neural document models and traditional probabilistic topic models, demonstrating their robustness and effectiveness."

      "text" : "In probabilistic topic models, such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003), we use the latent variables θd and zn for the topic proportion of document d, and the topic assignment for the observed word wn, respectively. In order to facilitate efficient inference, the Dirichlet distribution (or Dirichlet process (Teh et al., 2006)) is employed as the prior to generate the parameters of the multinomial distribution θd for each document. The use of a conjugate prior allows the tractable computation of the posterior distribution over the latent variables’ values. While alternatives have been explored, such as log-normal topic distributions (Blei & Lafferty, 2006; 2007), extra approximation (e.g. the Laplace approximation (Wang & Blei, 2013)) is required for closed form derivations. The generative process of LDA is:\nθd ∼ Dir(α0), for d ∈ D zn ∼ Multi(θd), for n ∈ [1, Nd] wn ∼ Multi(βzn), for n ∈ [1, Nd]\nwhere βzn represents the topic distribution over words given topic assignment zn and Nd is the number of tokens in document d. βzn can be drawn from another Dirichlet distribution, but here we consider it a model parameter. α0 is the hyper-parameter of the Dirichlet prior and Nd is the total number of words in document d. The marginal likelihood for a document in collection D is:\np(d|α0, β)= ∫ θ p(θ|α0) ∏ n ∑ zn p(wn|βzn)p(zn|θ)dθ. (1)\nIf we employ mean-field variational inference, the updates for the variational parameters q(θ) and q(zn) can be directly derived in closed form.\nIn contrast, our proposed models introduce a neural network to parameterise the multinomial topic distribution.\nThe generative process is:\nθd ∼ G(µ0, σ20), for d ∈ D zn ∼ Multi(θd), for n ∈ [1, Nd] wn ∼ Multi(βzn), for n ∈ [1, Nd]\nwhere G(µ0, σ20) is composed of a neural network θ = g(x) conditioned on a isotropic Gaussian x ∼ N(µ0, σ20)1. The marginal likelihood is:\np(d|µ0, σ0, β) = ∫ θ\np(θ|µ0, σ20) (2)∏ n ∑ zn p(wn|βzn)p(zn|θ)dθ.\nCompared to Equation (1), here we parameterise the latent variable θ by a neural network conditioned on a draw from a Gaussian distribution. To carry out neural variational inference (Miao et al., 2016), we construct an inference network q(θ|µ(d), σ(d)) to approximate the posterior p(θ|d), where µ(d) and σ(d) are functions of d that are implemented by multilayer perceptrons (MLP). By using a Gaussian prior distribution, we are able to employ the re-parameterisation trick (Kingma & Welling, 2014) to build an unbiased and low-variance gradient estimator for the variational distribution. Without conjugacy, the updates of the parameters can still be derived directly and easily from the variational lower bound. We defer discussion of the inference process until the next section. Here we introduce several alternative neural networks for g(x) which transform a Gaussian sample x into the topic proportions θ."

As such we use N(µ, σ2) to represent the Gaussian distributions, where σ2 is the diagonal of the covariance matrix.\nrandom variables define breaks from a unit stick. In our case, following Khan et al. (2012), we transform the modelling of multinomial probability parameters into the modelling of the logits of binomial probability parameters using Gaussian latent variables. More specifically, conditioned on a Gaussian sample x ∈ RH , the breaking proportions η ∈ RK−1 are generated by applying the sigmoid function η = sigmoid(WT2 x) where W ∈ RH×K−1. Starting with the first piece of the stick, the probability of the first category is modelled as a break of proportion η1, while the length of the remainder of the stick is left for the next break. Thus each dimension can be deterministically computed by θk = ηk ∏k−1 i=1 (1 − ηi) until k=K−1, and the remaining length is taken as the probability of the Kth category θK = ∏K−1 i=1 (1− ηi).\nFor instance assume K = 3, θ is generated by 2 breaks where θ1 = η1, θ2 = η2(1 − η1) and the remaining stick θ3 = (1 − η2)(1 − η1). If the model proceeds to break the stick for K = 4, the remaining stick θ3 is broken into (θ′3, θ ′ 4), where θ ′ 3 = η3 · θ3, θ′4 = (1 − η3) · θ3 and θ3 = θ ′ 3 + θ ′ 4. Hence, for different values of K, it al-\nways satisfies ∑K k=1 θk = 1. The stick breaking construction fSB(η) is illustrated in Figure 1 and the distribution θ ∼ GGSB(µ0, σ20) is defined as:\nx ∼ N (µ0, σ20) η = sigmoid(WT2 x) θ = fSB(η)\nAlthough the Gaussian stick breaking construction breaks exchangeability, compared to the stick breaking definition of the Dirichlet process, it does provide a more amenable form for neural variational inference. More interestingly, this stick breaking construction introduces a nonparametric aspect to neural topic models."

Here we consider the stick breaking construction as a sequential\ndraw from an RNN, thus capturing an unbounded number of breaks with a finite number of parameters. Conditioned on a Gaussian latent variable x, the recurrent neural network fSB(x) produces a sequence of binomial logits which are used to break the stick sequentially. The fRNN(x) is decomposed as:\nhk = RNNSB(hk−1) ηk = sigmoid(hTk−1x)\nwhere hk is the output of the kth state, which we feed into the next state of the RNNSB as an input. Figure 2 shows the recurrent neural network structure. Now θ ∼ GRSB(µ0, σ20) is defined as:\nx ∼ N (µ0, σ20) η = fRNN(x)\nθ = fSB(η)\nwhere fSB(η) is equivalent to the stick breaking function used in the Gaussian stick breaking construction. Here, the RNN is able to dynamically produce new logits to break the stick ad infinitum. The expressive power of the RNN to model sequences of unbounded length is still bounded by the parametric model’s capacity, but for topic modelling it is adequate to model the countably infinite topics amongst the documents in a truncation-free fashion."

Here we introduce topic vectors t ∈ RK×H , word vectors v ∈ RV×H and generate the topic distributions over words by:\nβk = softmax(v · tTk ).\nTherefore, β∈RK×V is a collection of simplexes achieved by computing the semantic similarity between topics and words. Following the notation introduced in Section 2, the prior distribution is defined as G(θ|µ0, σ20) in which x ∼ N (x|µ0, σ20) and the projection network generates θ = g(x) for each document. Here, g(x) can be the Gaussian Softmax gGSM(x), Gaussian Stick Breaking gGSB(x), or Recurrent Stick Breaking gRSB(x) constructions with fixed length RNNSB. We derive a variational lower bound for the document log-likelihood according to Equation (2):\nLd = Eq(θ|d) [∑N n=1 log ∑ zn [p(wn|βzn)p(zn|θ)] ] −DKL [ q(θ|d)||p(θ|µ0, σ20) ] (3)\nwhere q(θ|d) is the variational distribution approximating the true posterior p(θ|d). Following the framework of neural variational inference (Miao et al., 2016; Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014), we introduce an inference network conditioned on the observed document d to generate the variational parameters µ(d) and σ(d) so that we can estimate the lower bound by sampling θ from q(θ|d) = G(θ|µ(d), σ2(d)). In practise we reparameterise θ̂ = µ(d) + ̂ · σ(d) with the sample ̂ ∈ N (0, I).\nSince the generative distribution p(θ|µ0, σ20) = p(g(x)|µ0, σ20) = p(x|µ0, σ20) and the variational distribution q(θ|d) = q(g(x)|d) = q(x|µ(d), σ2(d)), the KL term in Equation (3) can be easily integrated as a Gaussian KL-divergence. Note that, the parameterisation network g(x) and its parameters are shared across all the documents. In addition, given a sampled θ̂, the latent variable zn can be integrated out as:\nlog p(wn|β, θ̂) = log ∑\nzn\n[ p(wn|βzn)p(zn|θ̂) ] = log(θ̂ · β) (4)\nThus there is no need to introduce another variational ap-\nproximation for the topic assignment z. The variational lower bound is therefore:\nLd ≈ L̂d = ∑N\nn=1\n[ log p(wn|β, θ̂) ] −DKL [q(x|d)||p(x)]\nWe can directly derive the gradients of the generative parameters Θ, including t, v and g(x). While for the variational parameters Φ, including µ(d) and σ(d), we use the gradient estimators:\n∇µ(d)L̂d ≈ ∇θ̂L̂d, ∇σ(d)L̂d ≈ ̂ · ∇θ̂L̂d.\nΘ and Φ are jointly updated by stochastic gradient backpropagation.

      "text" : "For the GSM and GSB models the topic vectors t ∈ RK×H have to be predefined for computing the topic distribution over words β. With the RSB construction we can model an unbounded number of topics, however in addition to the RNNSB that generates the topic proportions θ ∈ R∞ for each document, we must introduce another neural network RNNTopic to produce the topics t ∈ R∞×H dynamically, so as to avoid the need to truncate the variational inference.\nFor comparison, in finite neural topic models we have topic vectors t ∈ RK×H , while in unbounded neural topic models the topics t ∈ R∞×H are dynamically generated by RNNTopic and the order of the topics corresponds to the order of the states in RNNSB. The generation of β follows:\ntk = RNNTopic(tk−1), βk = softmax(v · tTk ),\nwhere v ∈ RV×H represents the word vectors, tk is the kth topic generated by RNNTopic and k < ∞. Figure 4 illustrates the neural structure of RNNTopic.\nFor the unbounded topic models we introduce a truncationfree neural variational inference method which enables the\nmodel to dynamically decide the number of active topics. Assume the current active number of topics is i, RNNTopic generates ti ∈ Ri×H by an i−1 step stick-breaking process (the logit for the nth topic is the remaining stick after i− 1 breaks). The variational lower bound for a document d is:\nLid ≈ ∑N\nn=1\n[ log p(wn|βi, θ̂i) ] −DKL [q(x|d)||p(x)] ,\nwhere θ̂i corresponds to the topic distribution over words βt. In order to dynamically increase the number of topics, the model proposes the ith break on the stick to split the (i+ 1)th topic. In this case, RNNTopic proceeds to the next state and generates topic t(i+1) for β(i+1) and the RNNSB generates θ̂(i+1) by an extra break of the stick. Firstly, we compute the likelihood increase brought by topic i across the documents D:\nI = ∑D\nd\n[ Lid − Li−1d ] / ∑D\nd [Lid]\nThen, we employ an acceptance hyper-parameter γ to decide whether to generate a new topic. If I > γ, the previous proposed new topic (the ith topic) contributes to the generation of words and we increase the active number of topics i by 1, otherwise we keep the current i unchanged. Thus γ controls the rate at which the model generates new topics. In practise, the increase of the lower bound is computed over mini-batches so that the model is able to generate new topics before the current epoch is finished. The details of the algorithm are described in Algorithm 1."

      "text" : "Topic models have been extensively studied for a variety of applications in document modelling and information retrieval. Beyond LDA, significant extensions have sought to capture topic correlations (Blei & Lafferty, 2007), model temporal dependencies (Blei & Lafferty, 2006) and discover an unbounded number of topics (Teh et al., 2006). Topic models have been extended to capture extra context information such as time (Wang & McCallum, 2006), authorship (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004), and class labels (Mcauliffe & Blei, 2008). Such extensions often require carefully tailored graphical models, and associated inference algorithms, to capture the desired context. Neural models provide a more generic and extendable option and a number of works have sought to leverage these, such as the Replicated Softmax (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2009), the Auto-Regressive Document Model (Larochelle & Lauly, 2012), Sigmoid Belief Document Model (Mnih & Gregor, 2014), Variational Auto-Encoder Document Model (NVDM) (Miao et al., 2016) and TopicRNN Model (Dieng et al., 2016). However, these neural works do not explicitly capture topic assignments.\nThe recent work of Srivastava & Sutton (2016) also employs neural variational inference to train topic models and is closely related to our work. Their model follows the original LDA formulation in keeping the Dirichlet-Multinomial parameterisation and applies a Laplace approximation to allow gradient to back-propagate to the variational distribution. In contrast, our models directly parameterise the multinomial distribution with neural networks and jointly learn the model and variational parameters during inference. Nalisnick & Smyth (2016) proposes a reparameter-\nisation approach for continuous latent variables with Beta prior, which enables neural variational inference for Dirichlet process. However, Taylor expansion is required to approximate the KL Divergence while having multiple draws from the Kumaraswamy variational distribution. In our case, we can easily apply the Gaussian reparametersation trick with only one draw from the Gaussian distribution."

      "text" : "We use Perplexity as the main metric for assessing the generalisation ability of our generative models. Here we use the variational lower bound to estimate the document perplexity: exp(− 1D ∑D d 1 Nd\nlog p(d)) following Miao et al. (2016). Table 1 presents the test document perplexities of the topic models on the three datasets. Amongst the finite topic models, the Gaussian softmax construction (GSM) achieves the lowest perplexity in most cases, while all of the GSM, GSB and RSB models are significantly better than the benchmark LDA and NVLDA models. Amongst our selection of unbounded topic models, we compare our truncation-free RSB model, which applies an RNN to dynamically increase the active topics (γ is empirically set\nas 5e−5), with the traditional non-parametric HDP topic model (Teh et al., 2006). Here we see that the recurrent neural topic model performs significantly better than the HDP topic model on perplexity.\nNext we evaluate our neural network parameterisations as document models with the implicit topic distribution introduced in Section 3.3. Table 2 compares the proposed neural document models with the benchmarks. According to our experimental results, the generalisation abilities of the GSM, GSB and RSB models are all improved by switching to an implicit topic distribution, and their performance is also significantly better than the NVDM and ProdLDA. We hypothesise that this effect is due to the models not needing to infer the topic-word assignments, which makes optimisation much easier. Interestingly, the RSB model performs better than the GSM and GSB on 20NewsGroups in both the 50 and 200 topic settings. This is possibly due to the fact that GSM and GSB apply linear transformations W1 andW2 to generate the hidden variable θ and breaking proportions η from a Gaussian draw, while the RSB applies recurrent neural networks to produce η in a sequence which induces dependencies in η and helps escape local minima. It is worth noting that the recurrent neural network uses more parameters than the other two models. As mentioned in Section 3.3, GSM is a variant of NVDM that applies topic and word vectors to construct the topic distribution over words instead of directly modelling a multinomial distribution by a softmax function, which further simplifies optimisation. If it is not necessary to model the explicit topic distribution over words, using an implicit topic distribution may lead to better generalisation.\nTo further demonstrate the effectiveness of the stickbreaking construction, Figure 5 presents the average probability of each topic by estimating the posterior probability q(z|d) of each document from 20NewsGroups. Here we set the number of topics to 400, which is large enough for this dataset. Figure 5a shows that the topics with higher probability are evenly distributed. While in Figure 5a the higher probability ones are placed in the front, and we can see a small tail on the topics after 300. Due to the sparsity inducing property of the stick-breaking construction, the topics on the tail are less likely to be sampled. This is also the advantage of stick-breaking construction when we apply the RSB-TF as a non-parameteric topic model, since the model activates the topics according to the knowledge learned from data and it becomes less sensitive to the hyperparameter controlling the initial number of topics. Figure 6 shows the impact on test perplexity for the neural topic models when the maximum number of topics is increased. We can see that the performance of the GSM model gets worse if the maximum number of topics exceeds 400, but the GSB and RSB are stable even though the number of topics far outstrips that which the model requires. In addition, the\nRSB model performs better than GSB when the number of topics is under 200, but it becomes slightly worse than GSB when the number exceeds 400, possibly due to the difficulty of learning long sequences with RNNs.\nFigure 7 shows the convergence process of the truncationfree RSB (RSB-TF) model on the 20NewsGroups. With different initial number of topics, 10, 30, and 50. The RSBTF dynamically increases the number of active topics to achieve a better variational lower bound. We can see the training perplexity keeps decreasing while the RSB-TF activates more topics. The numbers of active topics will stabilise when the convergence point is approaching (normally between 200 and 300 active topics on the 20NewsGroups). Hence, as a non-parametric model, RSB-TF is not sensitive to the initial number of active topics.\nIn addition since the quality of the discovered topics is not directly reflected by perplexity (i.e. a function of loglikelihood), we evaluate the topic observed coherence by normalised point-wise mutual information (NPMI) (Lau et al., 2014). Table 3 shows the topic observed coherence achieved by the finite neural topic models. According to these results, there does not appear to be a significant difference in topic coherence amongst the neural topic models. We observe that in both the GSB and RSB, the NPMI scores of the former topics in the stick breaking order are\nhigher than the latter ones. It is plausible as the stickbreaking construction implicitly assumes the order of the topics, the former topics obtain more sufficient gradients to update the topic distributions. Likewise we present the results obtained by the neural document models with implicit topic distributions. Though the topic probability distribution over words does not exist, we could rank the words by the positiveness of the connections between the words and each dimension of the latent variable. Interestingly the performance of these document models are significantly better than their topic model counterparts on topic coherence. The results of RSB-TF and HDP are not presented due to the fact that the number of active topics is dynamic, which makes these two models not directly comparable to the others. To further demonstrate the quality of the topics, we produce a t-SNE projection for the estimated topic proportions of each document in Figure 8.\n6The best scores we obtained are 0.222 and 0.175 for 50 and 200 topics respectively, but here we report the higher scores from Srivastava & Sutton (2016)."

The mean angle of all pairs of K topics is ζ = 1K2 ∑ i ∑ j a(ti, tj), and the variance\nis ν = 1K2 ∑ i ∑ j(a(ti, tj) −m)2. We add the following topic diversity regularisation to the variational objective:\nJ = L+ λ(ζ − ν),\nwhere λ is a hyper-parameter for the regularisation that is empirically set as 0.1. Though in practise diversity regularisation does not provide a significant improvement to perplexity (2∼5 in most cases), it helps reduce topic redundancy and can be easily applied on topic vectors instead of the simplex over the full vocabulary."

Traditional inference methods have sought closedform derivations for updating the models, however as the expressiveness of these models grows, so does the difficulty of performing fast and accurate inference over their parameters. This paper presents alternative neural approaches to topic modelling by providing parameterisable distributions over topics which permit training by backpropagation in the framework of neural variational inference. In addition, with the help of a stick-breaking construction, we propose a recurrent network that is able to discover a notionally unbounded number of topics, analogous to Bayesian non-parametric topic models. Experimental results on the MXM Song Lyrics, 20NewsGroups and Reuters News datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these neural topic models.",
