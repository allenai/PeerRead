      "text" : "There is now increasing interest in the construction of knowledge bases like Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) and NELL (Carlson et al., 2010) in the natural language processing community. KBs contain facts such as Tiger Woods is an athlete, and Barack Obama is the president of USA. However, one of the main drawbacks in existing KBs is that they are incomplete and are missing important facts (West et\n∗Most of the research conducted during summer internship at Microsoft.\nal., 2014), jeopardizing their usefulness in downstream tasks such as question answering. This has led to the task of completing the knowledge base entries, or Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) extremely important.\nIn this paper, we address an important subproblem of knowledge base completion— inferring missing entity type instances. Most of previous work in KB completion has only focused on the problem of relation extraction (Mintz et al., 2009; Nickel et al., 2011; Bordes et al., 2013; Riedel et al., 2013). Entity type information is crucial in KBs and is widely used in many NLP tasks such as relation extraction (Chang et al., 2014), coreference resolution (Ratinov and Roth, 2012; Hajishirzi et al., 2013), entity linking (Fang and Chang, 2014), semantic parsing (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Berant et al., 2013) and question answering (Bordes et al., 2014; Yao and Durme, 2014). For example, adding entity type information improves relation extraction by 3% (Chang et al., 2014) and entity linking by 4.2 F1 points (Guo et al., 2013). Despite their importance, there is surprisingly little previous work on this problem and, there are no datasets publicly available for evaluation.\nWe construct a large-scale dataset for the task of inferring missing entity type instances in a KB. Most of previous KBC datasets (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2013) are constructed using a single snapshot of the KB and methods are evaluated on a subset of facts that are hidden during training. Hence, the methods could be potentially evaluated by their ability to predict easy facts that the KB already contains. Moreover, the methods are not directly evaluated\nar X\niv :1\n50 4.\n06 65\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 A\npr 2\non their ability to predict missing facts. To overcome these drawbacks we construct the train and test data using two snapshots of the KB and evaluate the methods on predicting facts that are added to the more recent snapshot, enabling a more realistic and challenging evaluation.\nStandard evaluation metrics for KBC methods are generally type-based (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2013), measuring the quality of the predictions by aggregating scores computed within a type. This is not ideal because: (1) it treats every entity type equally not considering the distribution of types, (2) it does not measure the ability of the methods to rank predictions across types. Therefore, we additionally use a global evaluation metric, where the quality of predictions is measured within and across types, and also accounts for the high variance in type distribution. In our experiments, we show that models trained with negative examples from the entity side perform better on type-based metrics, while when trained with negative examples from the type side perform better on the global metric.\nIn order to design methods that can rank predictions both within and across entity (or relation) types, we propose a global objective to train the models. Our proposed method combines the advantages of previous approaches by using negative examples from both the entity and the type side. When considering the same number of negative examples, we find that the linear classifiers and the low-dimensional embedding models trained with the global objective produce better quality ranking within and across entity types when compared to training with negatives examples only from entity or type side. Additionally compared to prior methods, the model trained on the proposed global objective can more reliably suggest confident entity-type pair candidates that could be added into the given knowledge base.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n• We develop an evaluation framework comprising of methods for dataset construction and evaluation metrics to evaluate KBC approaches for missing entity type instances. The dataset and evaluation scripts are publicly available at http://research. microsoft.com/en-US/downloads/\ndf481862-65cc-4b05-886c-acc181ad07bb/ default.aspx.\n• We propose a global training objective for KBC methods. The experimental results show that both linear classifiers and low-dimensional embedding models achieve best overall performance when trained with the global objective function.\n• We conduct extensive studies on models for inferring missing type instances studying the impact of using various features and models."

For example, e could be Tiger Woods and t could be sports athlete. As a single entity can have multiple types, entities in Freebase often miss some of their types. The aim of this work is to infer missing entity type instances in the KB. Given an unobserved fact (an entity-type pair) in the training data (e, t) 6∈ Λ where entity e ∈ E and type t ∈ T , the task is to infer whether the KB currently misses the fact, i.e., infer whether (e, t) ∈ Λ.

For example, in our snapshot of Freebase, it is not uncommon to find an entity with the type /people/deceased person but missing the type /people/person.\n• Freebase Description: Almost all entities in Freebase have a short one paragraph description of the entity. Figure 1 shows the Freebase description of Jean Metellus that can be used to infer the type /book/author which Freebase does not contain as the date of writing this article.\n• Wikipedia: As external information, we include the Wikipedia full text article of an entity in its feature representation. We consider entities in Freebase that have a link to their Wikipedia article. The Wikipedia full text of an entity gives several clues to predict it’s entity types. For example, Figure 2 shows a section of the Wikipedia article of Claire Martin which gives clues to infer the type /award/award winner that Freebase misses."

      "heading" : "3.1 Two Snapshots Construction",
      "text" : "In most previous work on KB completion to predict missing relation facts (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2013), the methods are evaluated on a subset of facts from a single KB snapshot, that are hidden while training. However, given that the missing entries are usually selected randomly, the distribution\nof the selected unknown entries could be very different from the actual missing facts distribution. Also, since any fact could be potentially used for evaluation, the methods could be evaluated on their ability to predict easy facts that are already present in the KB.\nTo overcome this drawback, we construct our train and test set by considering two snapshots of the knowledge base. The train snapshot is taken from an earlier time without special treatment. The test snapshot is taken from a later period, and a KBC algorithm is evaluated by its ability of recovering newly added knowledge in the test snapshot. This enables the methods to be directly evaluated on facts that are missing in a KB snapshot. Note that the facts that are added to the test snapshot, in general, are more subtle than the facts that they already contain and predicting the newly added facts could be harder. Hence, our approach enables a more realistic and challenging evaluation setting than previous work.\nWe use manually constructed Freebase as the KB in our experiments. Notably, Chang et al. (2014) use a two-snapshot strategy for constructing a dataset for relation extraction using automatically constructed NELL as their KB. The new facts that are added to a KB by an automatic method may not have all the characteristics that make the two snapshot strategy more advantageous.\nWe construct our train snapshot Λ0 by taking the Freebase snapshot on 3rd September, 2013 and consider entities that have a link to their Wikipedia page. KBC algorithms are evaluated by their ability to predict facts that were added to the 1st June, 2014 snapshot of Freebase Λ. To get negative data, we make a closed world assumption treating any unobserved instance in Freebase as a negative example. Unobserved instances in the Freebase snapshot on 3rd September, 2013 and 1st June, 2014 are used as negative examples in training and testing respectively.1\nThe positive instances in the test data (Λ−Λ0) are facts that are newly added to the test snapshot Λ. Using the entire set of negative examples in the test data is impractical due to the large number of negative examples. To avoid this we only add the negative types\n1Note that some of the negative instances used in training could be positive instances in test but we do not remove them during training.\nof entities that have at least one new fact in the test data. Additionally, we add a portion of the negative examples for entities which do not have new fact in the test data and that were unused during training. This makes our dataset quite challenging since the number of negative instances is much larger than the number of positive instances in the test data.\nIt is important to note that the goal of this work is not to predict facts that emerged between the time period of the train and test snapshot2. For example, we do not aim to predict the type /award/award winner for an entity that won an award after 3rd September, 2013. Hence, we use the Freebase description in the training data snapshot and Wikipedia snapshot on 3rd September, 2013 to get the features for entities.\nOne might worry that the new snapshot might contain a significant amount of emerging facts so it could not be an effective way to evaluate the KBC algorithms. Therefore, we examine the difference between the training snapshot and test snapshot manually and found that this is likely not the case. For example, we randomly selected 25 /award/award winner instances that were added to the test snapshot and found that all of them had won at least one award before 3rd September, 2013.\nNote that while this automatic evaluation is closer to the real-world scenario, it is still not perfect as the new KB snapshot is still incomplete. Therefore, we also perform human evaluation on a small dataset to verify the effectiveness of our approach.\n2In this work, we also do not aim to correct existing false positive errors in Freebase"

      "heading" : "3.2 Global Evaluation Metric",
      "text" : "Mean average precision (MAP) (Manning et al., 2008) is now commonly used to evaluate KB completion methods (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2013). MAP is defined as the mean of average precision over all entity (or relation) types. MAP treats each entity type equally (not explicitly accounting for their distribution). However, some types occur much more frequently than others. For example, in our large-scale experiment with 500 entity types, there are many entity types with only 5 instances in the test set while the most frequent entity type has tens of thousands of missing instances. Moreover, MAP only measures the ability of the methods to correctly rank predictions within a type.\nTo account for the high variance in the distribution of entity types and measure the ability of the methods to correctly rank predictions across types we use global average precision (GAP) (similarly to micro-F1) as an additional evaluation metric for KB completion. We convert the multi-label classification problem to a binary classification problem where the label of an entity and type pair is true if the entity has that type in Freebase and false otherwise. GAP is the average precision of this transformed problem which can measure the ability of the methods to rank predictions both within and across entity types.\nPrior to us, Bordes et al. (2013) use mean reciprocal rank as a global evaluation metric for a KBC task. We use average precision instead of mean reciprocal rank since MRR could be biased to the top predictions of the method (West et al., 2014)\nWhile GAP captures global ordering, it would be\nbeneficial to measure the quality of the top k predictions of the model for bootstrapping and active learning scenarios (Lewis and Gale, 1994; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999). We report G@k, GAP measured on the top k predictions (similarly to Precision@k and Hits@k). This metric can be reliably used to measure the overall quality of the top k predictions."

Similar to previous work (Mintz et al., 2009; Bordes et al., 2013; Riedel et al., 2013), we get negative training examples by treating the unobserved data in the KB as negative examples. Because the number of unobserved examples is much larger than the number of facts in the KB, we follow previous methods and sample few unobserved negative examples for every positive example.\nPrevious methods largely neglect the sampling methods on unobserved negative examples. The proposed global object framework allows us to systematically study the effect of the different sampling methods to get negative data, as the performance of the model for different evaluation metrics does depend on the sampling method.\nWe consider a training snapshot of the KB Λ0, containing facts of the form (e, t) where e is an entity in the KB with type t. Given a fact (e, t) in the KB, we consider two types of negative examples constructed from the following two sets: NE(e, t) is the “negative entity set”, and NT (e, t) is the “negative type set”. More precisely,\nNE(e, t) ⊂ {e′|e′ ∈ E, e′ 6= e, (e′, t) /∈ Λ0},\nand\nNT (e, t) ⊂ {t′|t′ ∈ T, t′ 6= t, (e, t′) /∈ Λ0}.\nLet θ be the model parameters, m = |NE(e, t)| and n = |NT (e, t)| be the number of negative examples and types considered for training respectively. For each entity-type pair (e, t), we define the scoring function of our model as s(e, t|θ).3 We define two loss functions one using negative entities and the other using negative types:\nLE(Λ0, θ) = ∑\n(e,t)∈Λ0,e′∈NE(e,t)\n[s(e′, t)− s(e, t) + 1]k+,\nand LT (Λ0, θ) = ∑\n(e,t)∈Λ0,t′∈NT (e,t)\n[s(e, t′)− s(e, t) + 1]k+,\nwhere k is the power of the loss function (k can be 1 or 2), and the function [·]+ is the hinge function.\nThe global objective function is defined as\nmin θ Reg(θ) + CLT (Λ0, θ) + CLE(Λ0, θ), (1)\nwhere Reg(θ) is the regularization term of the model, and C is the regularization parameter. Intuitively, the parameters θ are estimated to rank the observed facts above the negative examples with a margin. The total number of negative examples is controlled by the size of the sets NE and NT . We experiment by sampling only entities or only types or both by fixing the total number of negative examples in Section 5.\nThe rest of section is organized as follows: we propose three algorithms based on the global objective in Section 4.2. In Section 4.3, we discuss the relationship between the proposed algorithms and existing approaches. Let Φ(e) → Rde be the feature function that maps an entity to its feature representation, and Ψ(t) → Rdt be the feature function that maps an entity type to its feature representation.4 de and dt represent the feature dimensionality of the entity features and the type features respectively. Feature representations of the entity types (Ψ) is only used in the embedding model.\n3We often use s(e, t) as an abbreviation of s(e, t|θ) in order to save space.\n4This gives the possibility of defining features for the labels in the output space but we use a simple one-hot representation for types right now since richer features did not give performance gains in our initial experiments.\nAlgorithm 1 The training algorithm for Linear.Adagrad. 1: Initialize wt = 0, ∀t = 1 . . . |T | 2: for (e, t) ∈ Λ0 do 3: for e′ ∈ NE(e, t) do 4: if wTt Φ(e)−wTt Φ(e′)− 1 < 0 then 5: AdaGradUpdate(wt,Φ(e′)− Φ(e)) 6: end if 7: end for 8: for t′ ∈ NT (e, t) do 9: if wTt Φ(e)−wTt′Φ(e)− 1 < 0 then 10: AdaGradUpdate(wt,−Φ(e)) 11: AdaGradUpdate(wt′ ,Φ(e)). 12: end if 13: end for 14: end for"

Two algorithms use the linear model and the other one uses the embedding model.\nLinear Model The scoring function in this model is given by s(e, t|θ = {wt}) = wTt Φ(e), where wt ∈ Rde is the parameter vector for target type t. The regularization term in Eq. (1) is defined as follows: R(θ) = 1/2 ∑ t=1 w T t wt. We use k = 2 in our experiments. Our first algorithm is obtained by using the dual coordinate descent algorithm (Hsieh et al., 2008) to optimize Eq. (1), where we modified the original algorithm to handle multiple weight vectors. We refer to this algorithm as Linear.DCD.\nWhile DCD algorithm ensures convergence to the global optimum solution, its convergence can be slow in certain cases. Therefore, we adopt an online algorithm, Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011). We use the hinge loss function (k = 1) with no regularization (Reg(θ) = ∅) since it gave best results in our initial experiments. We refer to this algorithm as Linear.Adagrad, which is described in Algorithm 1. Note that AdaGradUpdate(x, g) is a procedure which updates the vector x with the respect to the gradient g.\nEmbedding Model In this model, vector representations are constructed for entities and types using linear projection matrices.

Similarly to the linear classifier model, we use the l1-hinge loss function (k = 1) with no regularization (Reg(θ) = ∅). Ui and Vi denote the i-th column vector of the matrix U and V, respectively. The algorithm is described in detail in Algorithm 2.\nThe embedding model has more expressive power than the linear model, but the training unlike in the linear model, converges only to a local optimum solution since the objective function is non-convex."

These models are trained only using negative entities which we refer to as Negative Entity (NE) objective.

Often the choice is made neither with theoretical foundation nor with empirical support.

Types are represented by boolean features while Freebase description and Wikipedia full text are represented using tfidf weighting. The best MAP results are obtained by using all the information (T+D+W) while best GAP results are obtained by using the Freebase description and Wikipedia article of the entity.

In this work, we focus on the task of inferring missing entity type instances in a KB, a fundamental task for KB competition yet receives little attention. Due to the novelty of this task, we construct a large-scale dataset and design an automatic evaluation methodology. Our knowledge base completion method uses information within the existing KB and external information from Wikipedia. We show that individual methods trained with a global objective that considers unobserved cells from both the entity and the type side gives consistently higher quality predictions compared to baseline methods. We also perform manual evaluation on a small subset of the data to verify the effectiveness of our knowledge base completion methods and the correctness of our proposed automatic evaluation method.",
