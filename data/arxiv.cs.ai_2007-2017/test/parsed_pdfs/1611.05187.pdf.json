      "text" : "In this work, Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithms for the multi-depot dial-a-ride problem (DARP) with heterogeneous vehicles and users are presented. In the problem, vehicles have different sizes and features and are located in multiple depots. Users can only use compatible vehicles, and must be transported from a specific origin location to a specific destination location and eventually vice versa. The lengths of the routes assigned to the vehicles cannot exceed given limits. Quality of service requirements impose the fulfillment of pickup and delivery time windows and a limited ride time for each user.\nIn this paper, an extensive computational study is proposed to evaluate different Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithms for DARP. The algorithms are based on the general framework already introduced in Parragh et al. [23], for the single-depot case with homogeneous vehicles and users, and extended in [14] to the multi-depot DARP with heterogeneous vehicles and users in Detti et al. [14]. More precisely, in [14], a VNS scheme is proposed for solving a real-world healthcare\n2\napplication, concerning the non-emergency transportation of patients in Italy [1, 9]. In the healthcare application, constraints on arrival and departure times, patient-vehicle compatibility, patients’ preferences and quality of service issues were considered.\nThe main contributions of this paper are reported below. Starting from the VNS framework developed for the real-world healthcare application addressed in [14], new VNS algorithms for the multidepot DARP with heterogeneous users and vehicles have been designed, presented and tested. The aim is to evaluate in terms of solution’s quality and computational time different (i) algorithms for finding an initial solution, (ii) combinations of neighborhoods’ sets and (iii) local search procedures. Furthermore, new benchmark multi-depot instances of DARP with heterogeneous vehicles and users are presented, generated from the real-world data of the problem addressed in [14]. The VNS algorithms are evaluated and tested on three sets of benchmark instances. The first set has been presented in [22] and contains single-depot DARP instances, partitioned into three subsets. The second set has been introduced in [6] and contains multi-depot instances generated by the three subsets presented in [22]. As already stated, the third set arises from the real-world healthcare application addressed in [14].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a literature review is presented. In Sections 3, a description of the problem is given. Section 4 is devoted to the presentation of the variable neighborhood search algorithms. In Section 5, the benchmark instances are described. Computational results on the benchmark instances are reported in Section 6. Conclusions follow in Section 7.\n3"

      "text" : "DARP is a generalization of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW ) [5, 17, 28]. In DARP, people are transported instead of goods and consequently issues on the quality of the provided service and timing must be carefully taken into account (through additional constraints or by extra terms in the objective function). For recent surveys on DARP and PDPTW, we refer the reader to Cordeau and Laporte [12] and Berbeglia et al. [4].\nPromising exact techniques used in the literature for solving DARP, PDPTW and their variants are Branch-and-Price [2, 5, 23, 28, 29] and Branch-and-Cut [6, 27]. However, due to the difficulty of modeling all the constraints of the real-world problems and of solving large dimension instances, many studies have been also focused on the development of heuristic and metaheuristic approaches [18].\nAlthough several studies about DARPs have been proposed in the literature, most of the papers deal with a single user type and a homogeneous fleet of vehicles located at a single depot, while few works address the with multi-depots, heterogeneous vehicles and users (e.g., see [6], [7] and [14]).\nIn [6], the multi-depot DARP with heterogeneous vehicles and users is considered, where quality of service is limited to patients’ ride times and the route costs depend on the traveled distance. The authors propose a deterministic annealing metaheuristic and an exact Branch-and-Cut algorithm based on a the PDPTW2 formulation of Ropke et al. [27].\nIn Carnes et al. [7], a multi-depot DARP application coming from an air-ambulance service context is addressed (compatibility constraints among patients exist, too, e.g., patients cannot be transported with another patient owing to infectiousness). The authors consider a complex cost function\n4\nfor routing costs. The instances handled in [7] contain no more than 30 requests per day and are solved by a set partitioning formulation.\nAs already stated, in [14], a multi-depot DARP is addressed, arising from a real-world healthcare application. For this application, metaheuristic algorithms based on the Tabu Search (TS) and the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) techniques are presented and a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation is proposed. A performance analysis based on instances generated by real-life data shows that VNS attains the best results in terms of solution quality and computational times.\nConcerning the metaheuristic approaches, the tabu search and the variable neighborhood search techniques have been widely applied to DARPs. Cordeau and Laporte [11] first applied TS to a case of DARP with a single depot, where constraints related to vehicles’ capacity, route duration and maximum ride time of any user on a vehicle were considered.\nPaquette et al. [21] developed a multicriteria heuristic embedding a tabu search process for solving a DARP, with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles and two types of users: ambulatory and wheelchairbound. In addition to travel costs, the objective function includes three quality terms, in order to reduce user’s inconveniences: the waiting time at the pickup node, the waiting time at the delivery node and user’s ride time. The proposed solution procedure combines some features of the tabu search heuristic of Cordeau and Laporte [11] and of the multicriteria reference point method of Climaco et al. [8]. Melachrinoudis et al. [19] proposed a TS heuristic to address a single-depot DARP with soft time windows that arises in a non-profit organization system operating in the Boston metropolitan area. To minimize user’s inconveniences, they employ an objective function that includes excess riding time, early/late delivery time before service and late pickup time after service.\n5\nBeaudry et al. [3] implemented a two-phase procedure for the dynamic DARP arising in several large hospitals. Different modes of transportation (e.g. a wheelchair or a stretcher) are considered, and a maximum ride time is given to limit patients’ inconveniences. The first phase consists in generating an initial feasible solution through a simple and fast insertion scheme. In the second phase, this solution is improved with a TS scheme.\nAlso variable neighborhood search based heuristics have been successfully proposed for solving DARPs. Parragh et al. [23] proposed a VNS heuristic with three neighborhood types for a single-depot DARP with homogeneous vehicles, constraints on route duration and time windows and maximum users’ ride times. In [24], a collaborative scheme has been proposed, integrating the VNS heuristic into a column generation framework, for a variant of DARP, arising in the Austrian Red Cross context, with driver-related constraints, heterogeneous vehicles and patients. Muelas et al. [20] propose a VNS-based algorithm with seven different neighborhood classes (or shakers) for a DARP that arises in the area of San Francisco. In their work patients and visitors must be transported from a set of hospitals located around the city to their home addresses (and vice versa), using a fleet of homogeneous vehicles.\nRecently, new metaheuristic approaches have been proposed for DARP in [6] and [25]. As already stated, in [6], a deterministic annealing metaheuristic is proposed for the multi-depot DARP with heterogeneous vehicles and users. In [25], a hybrid column generation and a large neighborhood search algorithm are presented for solving a single-depot DARP with homogeneous vehicles, maximum user ride times, route duration limits, and vehicle capacity constraints.\n6"

      "text" : "In the DARP with multi-depots, heterogeneous vehicles and users, a number of requests have to be served to transport users from a given origin to a given destination by a fleet of vehicles, located at geographically distributed depots.\nWhile in the standard DARP, all vehicles have the same capacity and are located at a single depot [11], in the heterogeneous multi-depot case, each vehicle, with its own equipment and capacity, is assigned to a specific depot and must start and end its route at this depot. Users are heterogeneous since they cannot be transported by all the vehicles, but only by the ones with the required equipment. The problem consists in assigning the transportation requests to the vehicles and in finding a routing of each vehicle, in such a way that a total transportation cost is minimized and quality of service requirements are respected.\nMany constraints can be taken into account, regarding the vehicles’ capacities, fulfillment of pickup and delivery time windows, precedence relationships among pickup and delivery locations, patients’ preferences and patient-vehicle compatibility, the quality and the timing of the service provided. The capacity constraints are related to the number of available seats in the vehicle and to the number of seats occupied by each users (e.g., in healthcare, the users are patients that may need a stretcher or a wheelchair to be transported, causing an occupation of more than one seat on a given vehicle). The compatibility constraints take into account the specific setup of the vehicle that can be used to serve a given user typology (for example, a patient on a stretcher can only be transported by an ambulance). The time windows constraints are related to the users, requiring that each pickup and delivery location need to be reached within a time interval. The precedence relationships state that\n7\nthe patients should be picked up prior to their deliveries. The quality of service requirements impose that the transportation service fulfills given indices of the quality of service, such as limits on the durations of the routes and on the ride times of the users. In the next section a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation is given for the problem."

The MILP formulation extends the formulation proposed by Cordeau [10] for the standard DARP to the multidepot case. (The number of the variables of the formulation is reduced by using aggregate variables as proposed in [10].)\nFirst of all, some notation is introduced. Let G = (V,A) be a complete directed graph, where V = {1, . . . ,n,n+1, . . . ,2n,2n+1, . . . ,2n+ p} is the node set and A = {(i, j) : i, j ∈V} is the arc set. The nodes P = {1, . . . ,n} are pickup nodes, the nodes D = {n+1, . . . ,2n} are delivery nodes and the nodes DEP = {2n+1, . . . ,2n+ p} represent the depots. Hence, each transportation request i can be denoted by the nodes {i, i+n} in V , for i = 1, . . . ,n.\nThe following notation and parameters will be used throughout the paper.\n• T R = {1, . . . ,n} set of transportation requests;\n• M = {1, . . . ,m} set of vehicles;\n• K set of vehicle types (defined by the pair vehicle typology and depot in which the vehicle is\nlocated);\n• Mk, with |Mk|= mk, set of vehicles of type k, k = 1, . . . , |K|.

At each iteration h, a new solution, s′, is created in the neighborhood Nh(s) by a shaking procedure. Afterwards a local search step is applied to s′ yielding s′′.

The transportation requests are first sorted according to the pickup earliest time, ei. According to this ordering, the requests are assigned and inserted in the routes: first the pickup node is inserted and right after the delivery node. A request can be assigned to a route only if the compatibility constraints are respected. Capacity or ride time violations are not considered during this insertion phase. The assignment of the request to the routes is performed according to a minimum distance criterium. More precisely, a request is assigned to the route minimizing the average between the distance from the destination of the last request on the route (if the route is still empty the depot destination is taken instead) to the origin of the request to assign, and the distance from the destination of the request to assign to the depot. If an assignment does not satisfy the time window constraints or pre-specified limits on the length of the route, the insertion is not performed and the next route that minimizes the distance criterium, as described above, is considered. If, at the end, the request is not\n15\nassigned to any route, the request is assigned to the route that produces the smallest increase on the route length (without regarding the time window constraints).\nThe second heuristic (called Heuristic 2), computationally more expensive, works as follows. The transportation requests are first randomly sorted. According to this ordering, each request is assigned and inserted in all the routes in the best possible position, i.e., the position that minimizes the objective function. This procedure is repeated 1000 times, and the solution with the smaller value of the objective function is chosen as initial solution."

More precisely, given a route, the first pickup node and its delivery node are removed from the route. Then, the pickup node, if the request is an inbound request, or the delivery node, if it is an outbound request are inserted in the best possible position according to the time window constraints. (Observe that, while in the procedure proposed in [23] such a node can be further moved during the search process, in our procedure the position of this node is not changed anymore.) Afterwards, the remaining node is inserted right after (if it is a pickup node) or right before (if it is a delivery node) the first assigned node. If this change improves the evaluation function, then the nodes are fixed in the new positions, otherwise the procedure attempts to move the remaining node to the next possible position, increasing the distance from the first assigned node. This is repeated until the evaluation function is improved or no other possible position exist for the remaining node. If no improvement is found the request is reinserted in the original position. The procedure continues considering the nodes of the next request on the route. The local search ends when the procedure described above is applied to all the routes changed by the shaking procedure.\n20"

The adjustment procedure chooses, one by one, requests violating the constraint and assigns them either (i) at the beginning or at the end of other already used compatible routes, or (ii) to empty compatible routes, if any.

      "text" : "The experimental campaign has been performed on three sets of benchmark DARP instances.\nThe first set has been proposed in [22] and contains three subsets of single-depot DARP instances, denoted as U , E and I respectively. These instances, denoted in [22] as set I, have been generated from the a instances provided by Cordeau [10], in which heterogeneous real-life aspects arising at the Austrian Red Cross have been introduced. The set U contains instances with a single user/resource type and a homogeneous vehicle fleet, the set E includes four resource types with a homogeneous fleet of vehicles, and the set I contains four user/resource types and a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. More precisely, the instances in I contain up two types of vehicles and four types of resources: staff seats, patients seats, stretchers and wheelchair places. The users are characterized by the type of seat they require on a vehicle and are of four types: accompanying person, seated patient, patient on on a stretcher or in a wheelchair. Accompanying persons may use staff seats, patients seats or may sit on the stretcher. Seated patients may use a patient seat or may sit on a stretcher. Finally, users transported on a stretcher or in a wheelchair may only use the corresponding places. Table 1 summarizes the pair patient/seat type that are compatible.\nThe second set contains 24 multi-depot instances introduced in [6]. The instances have been generated introducing four vehicle depots in the instances of the set I (presented in [22]). The four depots are respectively located at the coordinates [−5;−5], [5;5], [−5;5] and [5;−5]. The vehicles are assigned to the depots in a round robin way.\n23\nThe third set contains instances introduced in [14], extracted from real-world data. The instances are partitioned into two subsets, called large and small instances, and include transportation requests operated in a day by a Local Health Care Agency in Tuscany, an Italian region. In these instances, the users are of three types: seated patient, patient on a stretcher or in a wheelchair. The vehicles belong to four different types, ambulance, bus, car and equipped vehicle, distributed over up to 17 depots. Ambulances and equipped vehicles can be transported at most one patient at time, while buses and cars have a maximum capacity of 8 and 3 seats, respectively. In each instance, patients can be transported only by a subset of vehicles (identified both by the patient’s conditions and by the patient’s preferences). In general, patients on a stretcher can be only transported by an ambulance, patients on a wheelchair can be transported by equipped vehicles or ambulances, while all other patients can use all the vehicles. The large instance set contains 14 instances with the following characteristics: Instances 1–4 have 80 transportation requests and 60 vehicles, instances 5–9 have 100 transportation requests and 75 vehicles, and instances 10–14 have 100 transportation requests and 80 vehicles. The small instance set contains 10 instances, in which the number of requests and vehicles are in the range 10–35 and 4–20, respectively. The service time to load or unload a patient is 15 minutes in the large\n24\ninstances and 10 minutes in the small instances. In all the instances, the maximum ride time for a transportation request is given by the traveling time from the pickup and delivery location multiplied by 2. Although the instances have been tested in [14], too, by using a complex objective function composed of several terms (including the length and the duration of the routes, waiting times of the vehicles, etc.), here we only consider the total traveled distance as objective function, as for the first two sets of benchmark instances introduced above. In all the distances a route duration limit has been set, too. The instances of the third set are available at http://www.dii.unisi.it/~detti/darp-instances."

At this aim, the 24 multi-depot benchmark instances introduced in [6] have been used (i.e., the instances of the second set).\nTwelve VNS algorithms have been developed, characterized by different neighborhood sets, max-\n25\nimum size values and local search procedures. The features of the twelve VNS algorithms are summarized in Table 2. Hence, as an example, referring to the general algorithmic scheme of Algorithm 1, Algo. # 1 employs (i) a shaking phase containing all the neighborhoods except IntraMove, (ii) a local search phase with Local Search 1 and the Focus Local Search, and (iii) a maximum size of the neighborhood (hmax) equal to 6. In all the twelve algorithms, the initial solution is found by applying the Heuristic 1 (see Section 4.2), and α0 = 100, β0 = 1, γ0 = 10000, τ0 = 1, and ITmax = 15000 have been set.\nTable 3, for each algorithm, reports the average results on the 24 instances. Ten runs of the algorithms on each instances have been performed, resulting in 240 runs for each algorithm. For each\n26\nalgorithm and instance, the results of the best 5 runs out of 10 (in terms of objective function value) have been only considered for Table 3. In the second column, “av cost” is the average objective function value obtained by each algorithm on the best 120 runs (out of 240). For each algorithm, in column 3, “min cost” reports the average best objective solution value (on the 24 instances) found on the 5 best runs, while, in column 4, “# opt” contains the number of instances, out of 24, in which an optimal solution is found (given in [6]). Column 6 reports the average computational time on the 120 best runs of the algorithms. Finally, columns 7 and 8 contain the percentage average and minimum gap, denoted as “av gap” and “min gap”, respectively. More precisely, “av gap” is the average, on the 24 instances, of the gaps av gapi, one for each instance i, between the average objective function value, av costi (on the 5 best runs) and the optimal solution value opti, given in [6]. av gapi is computed as (av costi −opti)/opti ×100. A similar definition holds for “min gap”, where, for each instance i, the best objective function value on the 5 best runs is used instead of av costi.\nWe note that, the best results in terms of solution quality (including the number of times in which an optimal solution is found) are attained by Algorithms 9 and 12. In fact, the “min gap” values for are Algorithms 9 and 12 are 3.73% and 3.88% while the other algorithms have “min gap” values always bigger than 4%. Moreover, Algorithm 9 is one of the fastest, with a computational time of 150 seconds, on average. Observe that algorithms 1-4 have sensibly higher computational times, mainly due to the neighborhood Eliminate, computationally expensive.\nIn terms of optimality, Algorithm 2 finds an optimal solution on 4 of the 24 instances (while the others algorithms no more than 3), however it attains on average higher gap values than Algorithms 9 and 12.\n27"

      "text" : "Starting from the best algorithms detected in the previous section a new computational campaign has been performed on multiple depot instances (i.e., the instances of the second and third sets, introduced in Section 5). More precisely, new 6 VNS algorithms have been developed and tested in this phase. The features of the algorithms are summarized in Table 4. Hence, Algorithms 13 and 14 have the same neighborhood set of algorithms 9 and 12, respectively, but the local search procedure LS3 in used in place of LS2. Algorithms 15 and 16 have the same neighborhood set of algorithms 9 and 12, respectively, too, but they only use the Focus Local Search (see Section 4.5.4). Finally, Algorithms 17 and 18 have the same neighborhood set of algorithms 15 and 16, but they only use the Focus Local Search with the 8-step evaluation scheme (see Section 4.5.5).\nIn Tables 5 and 6, the results of the 6 algorithms are reported. The solution provided by Heuristic 1 has been used as starting solution. For each instance “av gap” (“min gap’) is the gap between the average (minimum) objective function value, “av cost” (“min cost”), on the 5 best runs and the optimal solution “opt”, given in [6]. “av gap” (“min gap’) is computed as (av cost −opt)/opt×100 ((min cost −opt)/opt×100).\nObserve that, in terms of solution quality, Algorithms 13, 15 and 17 attain the best results, while Algorithms 16 and 18 require the smallest computational times. In fact, the complex neighborhood Chain is not used in Algorithms 16 and 18. In terms of solution quality, Algorithms 13 and 17 attain the best results with average (minimum) gaps of 4.81% (3.59%) and 4.8% (3.65%), respectively.\nIn order to evaluate how the initial solution influences the VNS technique, Algorithms 13, 15 and 17 has been executed starting from a solution provided by Heuristic 2 (introduced in Section 4.2).\n29\nThe results, reported in Table 7, show a (small) performance improvement of the algorithms when Heuristic 2 is applied with a relative small increase of computational time. In fact, with Heuristic 1, the smallest average minimum gap is 3.59%, found by Algorithm 13 (see Table 6), while with Heuristic 2, the average minimum gap is 3.33%, found by Algorithm 17 (see Table 7).\nAlgorithms 13, 15 and 17 have been tested on the small and big instances of the third set, too. Tables 8 and 9 report the results of the algorithms on the 10 small instances starting from a solution provided by Heuristic 1 and Heuristic 2, respectively. In the tables, for each instance, “av gap” (“min gap’) is the gap between the average (minimum) objective function value, “av cost” (“min cost”), on the 5 best runs and the optimal solution “opt”, provided by CPLEX 12.5 running on the MILP formulation with a time limit of 1 hour. “av gap” (“min gap’) is computed as (av cost−opt)/opt×100 (as (min cost −opt)/opt×100). In the first column of Tables 8 and 9, a * means that CPLEX was not able to certify the optimality of the solution within the time limit, while a ** indicates that CPLEX was not able to find any feasible solution within the time limit.\nTables 8 and 9 show Heuristic 2 gives overall slightly better results than Heuristic 1 even though the computational time is higher. The tables also show that Algorithm 13 works better than 15 and 17 with both heuristics. On the instance 10, with 35 requests and 20 vehicles, our algorithms were able to find solutions better than the solution found by CPLEX within the time limit. Observe that, the minimum gap is always smaller than 3.7% and 2.3% in Tables 8 and 9, respectively.\nFinally, Tables 10 and 11 report the results of the algorithms on the 14 big instances of the third set, starting from a solution provided by Heuristic 1 and Heuristic 2, respectively. On these instances no feasible solution was found by CPLEX running on the MILP formulation with a time limit of 6 hours. These tables also show that on average Heuristic 2 works slightly better than Heuristic 1,\n30\nin Algorithms 13 and 15, but perform slightly worse in Algorithm 17. Comparing the algorithms that employ Heuristic 1 (Table 10), Algorithm 17 performs better than the others. On the other hand, in Table 10, although Algorithm 13 performs slightly worse in terms of “av cost” and time, it outperforms the others in terms of “min cost”."

    "abstractText" : "In this work, a study on Variable Neighborhood Search algorithms for multi-depot dial-a-ride problems is presented. In dial-a-ride problems patients need to be transported from pre-specified pickup locations to pre-specified delivery locations, under different considerations. The addressed problem presents several constraints and features, such as heterogeneous vehicles, distributed in different depots, and heterogeneous patients. The aim is of minimizing the total routing cost, while respecting time-window, ride-time, capacity and route duration constraints. The objective of the study is of determining the best algorithm configuration in terms of initial solution, neighborhood and local search procedures. At this aim, two different procedures for ∗Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell’Informazione e Scienze Matematiche, University of Siena, Via Roma, 56, 53100 Siena, Italy, e-mail detti@dii.unisi.it †Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell’Informazione e Scienze Matematiche, University of Siena, Via Roma, 56, 53100 Siena, Italy, e-mail garazizml@gmail.com",
