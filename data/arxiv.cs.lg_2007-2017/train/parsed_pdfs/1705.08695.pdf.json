      "text" : "Unsupervised structure learning in high-dimensional sequential data is an important research problem in a number of applications, such as machine translation, speech recognition, computational biology, and computational physiology Sutskever et al. (2014); Dai et al. (2017b). For example, in medical diagnosis, learning the segment boundaries and labeling of complicated physical signals is very useful for doctors to understand the underlying behavior or activity types.\nModels for sequential data analysis such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs)Rumelhart et al. (1988) and hidden Markov models (HMMs)Rabiner (1989) are widely used. Recent\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n08 69\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\nliterature have investigated approaches of combining probabilistic generative models and recurrent neural networks for the sake of their complementary strengths in nonlinear representation learning and effective estimation of parameters Johnson et al. (2016); Dai et al. (2017b); Fraccaro et al. (2016). In many tasks, such as segmentation and labeling of natural scenes and physiological signals, the duration lengths and labels of segments are often interpretable and categorical distributed Jang et al. (2017). However, most of existing models are designed primarily for continuous situations and do not extend to discrete latent variables Johnson et al. (2016); Krishnan et al. (2015); Archer et al. (2015); Krishnan et al. (2016), probably due to the difficulty of inference for discrete variables in neural networks. For example, the work in Krishnan et al. (2015) considers combining variational autoencoders Kingma and Welling (2013) with continuous state-space models, aiming to capture nonlinear dynamics with control inputs and leading to an RNN-based variational framework. The work in Johnson et al. (2016) proposes a state space model with a general emission density. When composed with neural networks, state space models are natural to model discrete variables. While discrete variables can be more interpretable and helpful in many applications like medical analysis and behavior prediction, they are less considered as switching variables in previous work Fox et al. (2011); Johnson et al. (2016). Although the work in Dai et al. (2017b) utilizes discrete variables with informative information for label prediction of segmentation, the inference approach does not explicitly take advantage of structured information to exploit the bi-directional temporal information, and thus may lead to suboptimal performance, as verified in the experiment (See Table 5.3 in Section 5 for more details).\nTo address such issues, we propose the Stochastic Sequential Neural Network (SSNN) consisting of a generative network and an inference network. The generative network(as will shown in Figure 2(a)) shares the spirit of Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) Rabiner (1989) and Recurrent HSMM Dai et al. (2017b), and is composed with a continuous sequence (i.e., hidden states in RNN) as well as two discrete sequences (i.e., segmentation variables and labels in SSM). The inference network(as will shown in Figure 2(b)) can take the advantages of bi-directional temporal information by augmented variables, and efficiently approximate the categorical variables in segmentation and segment labels via the recently proposed Gumbel-Softmax approximation Jang et al. (2017); Maddison et al. (2016). Thus, SSNN can model the complex and long-range dependencies in sequential data, but also maintain the structure learning ability of SSMs with efficient inference.\nIn order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we compare our proposed model with the state-of-the-art neural models in a number of tasks, including automatic segmentation and labeling on datasets of speech modeling, and behavior modeling, medical diagnosis, and multi-object recognition. Experimental results in terms of both model fitting and labeling of learned segments have demonstrated the promising performance of the proposed model."

      "heading" : "2. Preliminaries",
      "text" : "In this section, we present background related to generative sequential models. Specifically, we first introduce RNNs, followed by HMMs and HSMMs.\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs), as a wide range of sequential models for time series, have been applied in a number of applications Sutskever et al. (2014). Here we introduce basic properties and notations of RNNs. Consider a sequence of temporal sequences of vectors x1:T = [x1,x2, ...,xT ] that depends on the inputs u1:T = [u1,u2, ...,uT ], where xt ∈ Rm is the observation and ut ∈ Rn is the input at the time step t, and T is the maximum time steps. RNN further introduces hidden states h1:T = [h1,h2, ...,hT ], where ht ∈ Rh encodes the information before the time step t, and is determined by ht = fθ(ht−1,ut), where fθ(·) is a nonlinear function parameterized by a neural network.\nState space models such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and hidden Semi-Markov models (HSMMs) are also widely-used methods in sequential learning Dai et al. (2017b); Chiappa et al. (2014); Dewar et al. (2012). In HMM, given an observed sequence x1:T , each xt is generated based on the hidden state zt ∈ {1, 2, ...,K}, and pθ(xt|zt) is the emission probability. We set pθ(z1) as the distribution of the initial state, and pθ(zt|zt−1) is the transition probability. We use z1:T = [z1, z2, ..., zT ]. Here θ includes all parameters necessary for these distributions. HSMM is a famous extension of HMM. Aside from the hidden state zt, HSMM further introduces time duration variables dt ∈ {1, 2, ..,M}, where M is the maximum duration value for each xt. We set d1:T = [d1, d2, ..., dT ]. HSMM splits the sequence into L segments, allowing the flexibility to find the best segment representation. We set s1:L = [s1, s2, .., sL] as the beginning of the segments. A difference from HMM is that for segment i, the latent state zsi:si+dsi−1 is fixed in HMM. An illustration is given in Figure 1.\nThere are many variants of HSMMs such as the Hierarchical Dirichlet-Process HSMM (HDP-HSMM) Johnson and Willsky (2013) and subHSMM Johnson and Willsky (2014). The subHSMM and HDP-HSMM extend their HMM counterparts by allowing explicit modeling of state duration lengths with arbitrary distributions. While there are various types of HMM, the inference methods are mostly inefficient.\nAlthough HMMs and HSMMs can explicitly model uncertainty in the latent space and learn a interpretable representation through dt and zt, they are not good at capturing the long-range temporal dependencies when compared with RNNs."

      "text" : "In order to model the long-range temporal dependencies and the uncertainty in segmentation and labeling of time series, we aim to take advantages from RNN and HSMM, and learn categorical information and representation information from the observed data recurrently. As illustrated in Figure 2(a), we design an Stochastic Sequential Neural Network (SSNN) with one sequence of continuous latent variables modeling the recurrent hidden states, and two sequences of discrete variables denoting the segment duration and labels, respectively. The joint probability can be factorized as:\npθ(x1:T , z1:T , d1:T ) = pθ(x1:T |z1:T , d1:T ) · pθ(z1)pθ(d1|z1) T∏ t=2 pθ(zt|zt−1, dt−1)pθ(dt|zt, dt−1).\n(1)\nTo learn more interpretative latent labels, we follow the design in HSMM to set zt and dt as categorical random variables, The distribution of zt and dt is\npθ(zt|zt−1, dt−1) = { I(zt = zt−1) if dt−1 > 1 pθ(zt|zt−1) otherwise\n, (2)\npθ(dt|zt, dt−1) = { I(dt = dt−1 − 1) if dt−1 > 1 pθ(dt|zt) otherwise , (3)\nwhere I(x) is the indicator function (whose value equals 1 if x is True, and otherwise 0). The transition probability pθ(zt|zt−1) and pθ(dt|zt), in implementation, can be achieved by learning a transition matrix.\nThe joint emission probability pθ(x1:T |z1:T , d1:T ) can be further factorized into multiple segments. Specifically, for the i-th segment xsi:si+dsi−1 starting from si, the corresponding generative distribution is\npθ(xsi:si+dsi−1|zsi , dsi) = si+dsi−1∏ t=si pθ(xt|xsi:t−1, zsi). = si+dsi−1∏ t=si pθ(xt|ht, zsi), (4)\nwhere ht is the latent deterministic variable in RNN. As mentioned earlier, ht can better model the complex dependency among segments, and capture past information of the observed sequence xt−1 as well as the previous state ht−1. We design ht = σ(W (zsi ) x xt−1 +\nW (zsi ) h ht−1 + b (zsi ) h ), where σ() is a tanh activation function, Wx ∈ R K×h×m and Wh ∈ RK×h×h are weight parameter, and bh ∈ RK×h is the bias term. W (zsi ) x ∈ Rh×m is the zsi-th slice of Wx, and it is similar for W (zsi ) h and b (zsi )\nh . Finally, the distribution of xt given ht and zsi is designed by a Normal distribution,\npθ(xt|ht, zsi) = N (x;µ,σ2), (5)\nwhere the mean satisfies µ = W (zsi ) µ ht+ b (zsi ) µ , and the covariance is a diagonal matrix with its log diagonal elements logσ2 = W (zsi ) σ ht +b (zsi ) σ . We use θ to include all the parameters in the generative model."

      "heading" : "3.2.1 Bi-directional Inference",
      "text" : "In order to find a more informative approximation to the posterior, we augment both random variables dt, zt with bi-directional information in the inference network. Such attempts have been explored in many previous work (Krishnan et al., 2016; Khan and Lin, 2017; Krishnan et al., 2015), however they mainly focus on continuous variables, and little attention is paid to the discrete variable. Specifically, we first learn a bi-directional deterministic variable ĥt = BiRNN(x1:t, xt:T ) , where BiRNN is a bi-directional RNN with each unit implemented as an LSTM Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). Similar to Fraccaro et al. (2016), we further use a backward recurrent function It = gφI (It+1, [xt, ĥt]) to explicitly capture forward and backward information in the sequence via ĥt, where [xt, ĥt] is the concatenation of xt and ĥt.\nThe posterior approximation can be factorized as\nqφ(z1:T , d1:T |x1:T ) = qφ(z1|I1)qφ(d1|z1, I1) T∏ t=2 qφ(zt|dt−1, It)qφ(dt|dt−1, zt, It), (7)\nand the graphical model for the inference network is shown in Figure.2(b). We use φ to denotes all parameters in inference network.\nWe design the posterior distributions of dt and zt to be categorical distributions, respectively, as follows:\nq(zt|dt−1, It;φ) = Cat(softmax(WTz It)), (8) q(dt|dt−1, zt, It;φ) = Cat(softmax(WTd It)), (9)\nwhere Cat denotes the categorical distribution. Since the posterior distributions of zt and dt are conditioned on It, they depend on both the forward sequences (i.e., ht:T and xt:T ) and the backward sequences (i.e., h1:t−1 and x1:t−1), leading to a more informative approximation. However, the reparameterization tricks and their extensions (Chung et al., 2016) are not directly applicable due to the discrete random variables, i.e., dt and zt in our model. Thus we turn to the recently proposed Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization trick (Jang et al., 2017; Maddison et al., 2016), as shown in the following."

Via the Gumbel Softmax transformation, we set y(t) ∼ Concrete(π(t), τ) according to (Maddison et al., 2016).\nNow we can sample y(t) from the Gumbel-Softmax posterior in replacement of the categorically distributed γ(t), and use the back-propagation gradient with the ADAM Kingma and Ba (2014) optimizer to learn parameters θ and φ.\nFor simplicity, we denote F (z, d) = log pθ(x1:T , z1:T , d1:T ) − log q(z1:T , d1:T |x1:T ), and furthermore, F̃ (y, g) is the corresponding approximation term of F (z, d) after the GumbelSoftmax trick.

      "text" : "In this section, we review research work on generative sequential data modeling in terms of state space models and recurrent neural networks. In the following, we review some recent work on sequential latent variable model.\nIn terms of combining both and SSM and RNNs, the papers mostly close to our paper include Johnson et al. (2016); Krishnan et al. (2015, 2016); Archer et al. (2015); Fraccaro et al. (2016). In detail, Krishnan et al. (2015) combines variational auto-encoders with continuous state-space models, emphasizing the relationship to linear dynamical systems. Krishnan et al. (2016) lets inference network conditioned on both future and past hidden variables, which extends Deep Kalman Filtering. Archer et al. (2015) uses a structured Gaussian variational family to solve the problem of variational inference in general continuous state space models without considering parameter learning. And Johnson et al. (2016) can employ general emission density for structured inference. Fraccaro et al. (2016) extends state space models by combining recurrent neural networks with stochastic latent variables. Different from the above methods that require the hidden states of SSM be continuous, our paper utilizes discrete latent variables in the SSM part for better interpretablity, especially in applications of segmentation and labeling of high-dimensional time series.\nIn parallel, some research also works on variational inference with discrete latent variables recently. Bayer and Osendorfer (2014) enhances recurrent neural networks with stochastic latent variables which they call stochastic neural network. For stochastic neural network the most applicable approach is the score function or REINFORCE approach, however it suffers from high variance. Mnih and Rezende (2016) proposes a gradient estimator for multi-sample objectives that use the mean of other samples to construct a baseline for each sample to decrease variance. Gu et al. (2015b) also models the baseline as a first-order Taylor expansion and overcomes back propagation through discrete sampling with a meanfield approximation, so it becomes practical to compute the baseline and derive the relevant gradients. Gregor et al. (2013) uses the first-order Taylor approximation as a baseline to reduce variances. In Discrete VAE Rolfe (2016), the sampling is autoregressive through each binary unit, which allows every discrete choice to be marginalized out in a tractable manner. Dai et al. (2017b) proposes to overcome the difficulty of learning discrete variables by optimizing their distribution instead of directly learning discrete variables.\nIn the aspect of optimization, Khan et al. (2015a,b) split the variational inference objective into a term to be linearized and a tractable concave term, which makes the resulting gradient easily to compute. Knowles and Minka (2011) proposes natural gradient descent with respect to natural parameters on each of the variational factors in turn. In Dai et al. (2017a), the discrete optimization is replaced by the maximization over the negative Helmholtz free energy. In contrast to linearizing intractable terms around the current iteration as used in the above approaches, we handle intractable terms via recognition networks and amortized inference(with the aid of Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization Jang et al. (2017); Maddison et al. (2016)) in this paper. That is, we use parametric function approximators to learn conditional evidence in a conjugate form."

For the TIMIT and Blizzard dataset, the sampling frequency is 16KHz and the raw audio signal is normalized using the global mean and standard deviation of the training set.

For RNN+VRNNs Chung et al. (2015), VRNN is tested with two different output distributions: a Gaussian distribution (VRNN-GAUSS), and a Gaussian Mixture Model (VRNN-GMM). We also compare to VRNN-I in which the latent variables in VRNN are constrained to be independent across time steps. For SRNN Fraccaro et al.

      "text" : "In order to learn the structures (e.g., the segmentation and labeling) of high-dimensional time series in a unsupervised way, we have proposed a Stochastic sequential neural network(SSNN) with structured inference. For better model interpretation, we further restrict the label and segmentation duration to be two sequences of discrete variables, respectively. In order to exploit forward and backward temporal information, we carefully design structured inference, and to overcome the difficulties of inferring discrete latent variables in deep neural networks, we resort to the recently proposed Gumbel-Softmax functions. The advantages of the proposed inference method in SSNN have been demonstrated in both synthetic and real-world sequential benchmarks."

The waveforms are divided into non-overlapping vectors with size 200. For Blizzard we split the data using 90% for training, 5% for validation and 5% for testing. For testing we report the average log-likelihood for each sequence with segment length 0.5s. For TIMIT we use the predefined test set for testing and split the rest of the data into 95% for training and 5% for validation. During training we use back-propagation through time (BPTT) for 1 second. For the first second we initialize hidden units with zeros and for the subsequent 3 chunks we use the previous hidden states as initialization. the temperature τ starts from a large value 0.1 and gradually anneals to 0.01. We compare our method with the following methods. For RNN+VRNNs Chung et al. (2015), VRNN is tested with two different output distributions: a Gaussian distribution (VRNN-GAUSS), and a Gaussian Mixture Model (VRNN-GMM). We also compare to VRNN-I in which the latent variables in VRNN are constrained to be independent across time steps. For SRNN Fraccaro et al. (2016), we compare with the smoothing and filtering performance denoted as SRRR (smooth), SRNN (filt) and SRNN (smooth+ Resq) respectively. The results of VRNN-GMM, VRNN-Gauss and VRNN-I-Gauss are taken from Chung et al. (2015), and those of SRNN (smooth+Resq), SRNN (smooth) and SRNN (filt) are taken from Fraccaro et al. (2016).

    "abstractText" : "Unsupervised structure learning in high-dimensional time series data has attracted a lot of research interests. For example, segmenting and labelling high dimensional time series can be helpful in behavior understanding and medical diagnosis. Recent advances in generative sequential modeling have suggested to combine recurrent neural networks with state space models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models). This combination can model not only the long term dependency in sequential data, but also the uncertainty included in the hidden states. Inheriting these advantages of stochastic neural sequential models, we propose a structured and stochastic sequential neural network, which models both the long-term dependencies via recurrent neural networks and the uncertainty in the segmentation and labels via discrete random variables. For accurate and efficient inference, we present a bi-directional inference network by reparamterizing the categorical segmentation and labels with the recent proposed Gumbel-Softmax approximation and resort to the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of tasks, including speech modeling, automatic segmentation and labeling in behavior understanding, and sequential multi-objects recognition. Experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed model can achieve significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.",
