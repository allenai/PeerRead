{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "A Deep Learning Approach for Joint Video Frame and Reward Prediction in Atari Games", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is concerned with learning to interact with environments that are initially unknown. State-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches, such as DQN, are model-free and learn to act effectively across a wide range of environments such as Atari games, but require huge amounts of data. Model-based techniques are more data-efficient, but need to acquire explicit knowledge about the environment dynamics or the reward structure.   In this paper we take a step towards using model-based techniques in environments with high-dimensional visual state space when system dynamics and the reward structure are both unknown and need to be learned, by demonstrating that it is possible to learn both jointly. Empirical evaluation on five Atari games demonstrate accurate cumulative reward prediction of up to 200 frames. We consider these positive results as opening up important directions for model-based RL in complex, initially unknown environments.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The topic of the paper, model-based RL with a learned model, is important and timely.

The fact that this should train well is unsurprising for this domain, and the research yields no other interesting results. Pros - the paper is clearly written and the experiments are sound. Cons - there is very little novelty or contribution.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Final Review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper introduces an additional reward-predicting head to an existing NN architecture for video frame prediction. In Atari game playing scenarios, the authors show that this model can successfully predict both reward and next frames.\n\nPros:\n- Paper is well written and easy to follow.\n- Model is clear to understand.\n\nCons:\n- The model is incrementally different than the baseline. The authors state that their purpose is to establish a pre-condition, which they achieve. But this makes the paper quite limited in scope.\n\nThis paper reads like the start of a really good long paper, or a good short paper. Following through on the future work proposed by the authors would make a great paper. As it stands, the paper is a bit thin on new contributions.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Well written paper with a clear focus and interesting future work proposal but with an overall minor contribution.", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper extends a recently proposed video frame prediction method with reward prediction in order to learn the unknown system dynamics and reward structure of an environment. The method is tested on several Atari games and is able to predict the reward quite well within a range of about 50 steps. The paper is very well written, focussed and is quite clear about its contribution to the literature. The experiments and methods are sound. However, the results are not really surprising given that the system state and the reward are linked deterministically in Atari games. In other words, we can always decode the reward from a network that successfully encodes future system states in its latent representation. The contribution of the paper is therefore minor. The paper would be much stronger if the authors could include experiments on the two future work directions they suggest in the conclusions: augmenting training with artificial samples and adding Monte-Carlo tree search. The suggestions might decrease the number of real-world training samples and increase performance, both of which would be very interesting and impactful.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "16 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "No Title", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The topic of the paper, model-based RL with a learned model, is important and timely.
