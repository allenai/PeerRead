      "text" : "N EWS plays a vital role in informing citizens, af-fecting public opinions and policy making. The analyses of information flow in news media, such as selection and presentation biases, agenda-setting patterns, persuasion techniques, causal mechanisms, etc., are important issues in social and political science research. However, the sheer amount of news data overwhelms manual analysis. The objective of this paper is to develop an automatic topic detection and tracking method that provides a promising news parsing solution to serve as the basis for further analyses.\nDetecting topics summarizes and organizes the large news collection, which contains rich textual and visual data. Both texts and visuals play key roles in the topic detection process. More importantly, they are both desired to be easily accessible to systematic research in social and political science. However, most of the traditional topic detection methods [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] are singlemodal and use texts only.\nMoreover, for both texts and visuals, rather than utilizing the overall data, social and political scientists usually focus on some specific aspects when doing media analyses. Thus in contrast to generating coarse-grained topics (e.g. using the bag-of-words representation) on which most studies in the current literature concentrate [3], [6], [7], [8], they request accurate and finegrained information in their analyses.

A recent work used face images of candidates to predict the election outcomes [11]. Some other work also considered faces and scenes when studying the visual persuasion in election [12], [13]. Hence subcomponents from both texts and visuals, such as names and faces, are desired to be modeled and extracted in the topic detection process. In other words, instead of representing topics’ texts and visuals at a coarse-grained level, it is preferred that finergrained compositional topic representations can be used to provide a more detailed interpretation.\nTracking topics deals with the continuously updated news data. Our objective is to generate topic trajectories to show how topics emerge, evolve, and disappear, and how their subcomponents change over time. This is also demanded by a number of applications such as the causal mechanism analysis [14]. Traditional topic tracking which is defined as the process of tracking the recurrence of known topics in new incoming stories [15], [1] thus can hardly fulfill this goal. Some other methods, e.g. [4], can model topic over time but fail to efficiently deal with the updated news data.\nDespite the decades of study, there lacks publicly available multimedia datasets for evaluating news topic detection and tracking methods. Even though some multimedia news datasets have been used in previous work, such as the TDT datasets [15], and the TRECVID corpus [16], they are not publicly available, and some of them do not have ground-truth annotations.\nTo solve the aforementioned problems, in this paper, we present a method for joint image-text news topic detection and tracking.

      "heading" : "1.2.1 The And-Or Graph Representation",
      "text" : "The proposed AOG embeds a context-sensitive grammar that jointly models hierarchical topic compositions of texts and images. Fig. 2 illustrates the AOG topic representation: • The root OR-node Or in the top layer represents\ndifferent topic configurations. • Each topic configuration is then represented by a\nsingle topic AND-node Atopick (k = 1, ...,K where K is the total topic number) in the second layer. This node is composed of two parts, which represent texts and images respectively.\nText Representation. The text part of each topic is represented by an AND-node, as shown in Fig. 2 (node Atxtk ). This node has three components, which encode the knowledge of ”who”, ”where” and ”what”. These three components describe the people involved, related places, and what happened respectively, which are three major aspects of new events and topics.\nThe ”who”, ”where” and ”what” components are all represented by OR-nodes (nodes Owok , O wr k , and O wt k in Fig. 2). All of these nodes can describe a set of possible words for the corresponding components. A certain news story may trigger a subset of these words. The words are represented by TERMINAL-nodes in the last layer. We also embed the contextual relations between the ”who”, ”where” and ”what” components in the AOG. They are described using information from two aspects: • the co-occurrences of words from different compo-\nnents (such as the co-occurring pairs marked by the dashed red lines in Fig. 2); • the ratios of entity numbers of different components (e.g. some topics have more people involved compared to the related locations).\nImage Representation. The image part of each topic is also represented by an AND-node as shown in Fig. 2 (node Aimgk ). This node has two components, which capture two important visual signals in news: faces and objects. Faces show the main people related to the topic, and objects include other general information about the scene and the event.\nThe face and object components are represented by OR-nodes (nodes Ofacek and O obj k in Fig. 2), which can describe a set of possible entities similar to the ”who”, ”where”, and ”what” OR-nodes. Each face/object entity corresponds to one cluster of face/object patches, and we use a TERMINAL-node to represent it in the last layer. We also encode the contextual relations between the face and object components in the AOG using co-occurrences of face-object pairs (such as the co-occurrence of politicians and suits).\nJoint Image-Text Representation. To jointly model the topic text and image parts, we also describe their\ncontextual relations in the AOG. The ratio of the total entity numbers of these two parts (i.e. numbers of all TERMINAL-nodes under the nodes Atxtk and A img k in Fig. 2) is included in the AOG. We also model three component pair relations selected from these two parts, namely face-who, face-what and object-what pairs. The face-who and face-what pairs can clearly relate the faces appeared in the video to their names and other coappearing textual knowledge respectively. The objectwhat pairs can relate the objects to textual descriptions. For these three component pairs, the pair instance frequencies are used to model the contextual relations.\nIn summary, the proposed AOG topic representation jointly models texts and images and their subcomponents in a hierarchical structure. The AOG model strikes a balance between the syntactic representation in NLP (too complex to compute) and the simplistic BoW representation (too coarse). It supports the news topic detection and tracking tasks with the appropriate complexity accurately."

      "text" : "In the massive and continuously updated news data, each news topic evolves over time. We aim to detect topics within short time periods and further generate long-time topic trajectories. Therefore, we can show both detailed descriptions for each topic in different time periods, and how each topic develops over time. It also helps prevent the heavy computation incurred by periodically detecting topics using the entire updated news collection.\nFor topic detection, we group stories that elaborate the same topics. The proposed AOG explicitly describes components of different topics. Thus based on the AOG, we can effectively group related stories and generate\nmeaningful topics. We solve the grouping problem by cluster sampling methods by maximizing a Bayesian posterior probability. An efficient cluster sampling algorithm introduced in image segmentation, i.e. SwendsenWang Cuts (SWC) [17], is adopted for topic detection.\nFor topic tracking, with the hierarchical AOG model that can represent topic compositions and how such information changes over time, we align news topics in different time periods. This provides us a promising way to track and keep updating the news states. We link topics detected in different short time periods to generate topic trajectories by considering both topic similarities and their temporal relations.\nIn the experiments, we show that our method can generate meaningful topics and topic trajectories. It also achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms."

      "text" : "This paper makes the following contributions: • We proposed a joint image-text compositional news\ntopic representation based on And-Or Graph, which better utilize the multimodal data and provide interpretations with appropriate amount of details compared to single-modal methods and other representations [1], [3], [6], [7], [8], [18], [19]. • We solve the topic detection problem using the clustering sampling method Swendsen-Wang Cuts, which has better performance than commonly used greedy algorithms [3], [6], [8], [20]. • We detect and track topics simultaneously over time, generating both topic summaries in different time periods and long-time topic trajectories. The results show how topics evolve over time and provide useful data for further media analysis, which\n4 can hardly be fulfilled by traditional topic detection methods [15], [1].\n• We collected a news dataset for joint image-text topic detection and tracking, and also provide the ground-truth annotations, which copes with the lack of publicly available multimodal news datasets.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first review the related literature in Section 2. Then we present the proposed topic representation in Section 3. The proposed topic detection method is described in Section 4. The topic tracking method is illustrated in Section 5. We report our experiment results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7."

      "heading" : "2.1 Topic Modeling",
      "text" : "Among the large number of topic modeling methods, probabilistic topics models [21], [2] have been effectively used for detecting and analyzing latent topics, such as the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model [3], [22] and its extensions [23], [24], [25], [4], [26], [27].\nEven though these methods are effective in general topic modeling, they can hardly achieve good performance in the news domain using only the bag-of-words (BoW) representation. The BoW representation is computationally efficient, but it ignores the compositional structures, which are important for news analyses. News stories are generally driven by events, so information from aspects like ”who”, ”where” and ”what” is crucial for summarizing these stories and generating meaningful news topics. Newman et al. [28] considered these aspects but included them as a whole. Li et al. [29] used information from the above aspects in their representation. However, they assume that these aspects are independent, which is generally not true in the real news data.\nMoreover, all the aforementioned topic modeling methods are single-modal methods which only use texts. Several multi-modal probabilistic topic models have been proposed for other tasks such as image annotation and classification [30], [31], [32], news geo-location inference [33], etc., but methods for joint image-text topic detection are rare in the literature."

      "heading" : "2.2 Topic Clustering",
      "text" : "Clustering based methods are also widely used for the task of news topic detection. They assume that each news story talks about one news event which corresponds to one topic. A large number of methods for topic detection in the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) research [15] (e.g. [1], [34]) use clustering methods for\ndetecting news topics, where stories on the same topic are gathered. Traditional document clustering methods [5], [35] can also be used for topic detection. However, most of these methods are single-modal and mainly focus in the text domain.\nMultimodal topic clustering methods have been proposed by taking both texts and visuals into consideration. In most of these methods, texts are represented using the BoW representation [8], [20], [36], [7]. For visual representation, some methods use color histograms of the keyframes [8]. Other methods detect the nearduplicate keyframes (NDK) first and then use them to build visual relations between news stories [20], [36]. Even though these methods can compute the visual similarities between stories, they are not capable of modeling the visual part decomposition of news topics. In terms of the clustering methods, [8] and [20] used co-clustering algorithm and one of its extensions with constraints added respectively. [7] groups news stories based on the linear combination of textual and visual similarities. [36] detects topics within one multi-modality graph, which is obtained by merging one text graph and another visual graph constructed based on LDA and NDK respectively. These clustering methods are not global optimal.\nSome work also combined topic modeling and document clustering together, such as the multi-grain clustering topic model (MGCTM) proposed by Xie et al. [6]. They showed that these two tasks are closely related and can help each other as both performances are improved. This work still remains in the pure text domain and uses the BoW representation."

      "heading" : "2.3 Topic Tracking",
      "text" : "The traditional topic tracking problem in TDT [15], [1] is defined as the process of finding related additional stories for some pre-learned topics. Many methods have been proposed for solving this problem such as those in [15], [37], [38]. However, deciding the topic of each newcoming story based on the previous learned topics can take a long time in a large data collection. In addition, they can hardly deal with the newly emerging topics.\nIn the probabilistic modeling community, some models incorporate time information, such as the Dynamic Topic Model (DTM)[4] which can model the topic evolution over time. However, it is assumed that the topics exist throughout the whole time period, which is usually not true especially in broadcast news. It also leads to heavy computation for continuously updated new streams.\nThus instead of using the previous two methods, we choose to track the news topics by linking topics detected in different time periods and generating topic trajectories over time. Some linking methods, such as those by Mei and Zhai [39] as well as Kim and Oh [40], are closely related to our topic tracking task. However, the method in [39] is designed for news about some specific topics such as ”tsunami”. The similarity matrices used in [40] are\n5 based on the topics obtained by the original LDA model with the BoW assumption. Moreover, both of these two methods are merely based on textual information."

News topics are collected from sources such as Google News and organized in a hierarchical topic structure, and news stories are then matched to these topics. Another personalized news video system, EigenNews [43], [44], can aggregate news videos from multiple sources. It matches the extracted news stories to online news articles to get the related news categories. In this paper, we detect and track news topics in a fully unsupervised way by jointly modeling texts and visuals to support the media analyses in social and political science (e.g. the two case studies mentioned in Section 1.1)."

      "text" : "An AOG embodies a context sensitive grammar. It can be defined by a three-tuple G = (V,E,Θ). The node set V consists of three subsets of nodes: AND-nodes VAND, OR-nodes VOR and TERMINAL-nodes VT, i.e. V = VAND ∪ VOR ∪ VT. E denotes the edge set in the graph. Θ represents the AOG model parameters. We have Θ = {K, θ1, ..., θK} where K is the total topic number, and θ1, ..., θK represent the model parameters for these K topics respectively. Fig. 2 illustrates a small part of the proposed AOG topic representation.\nA parse graph pg is an instantiation of the AOG by selecting children nodes at OR-nodes. The green lines in Fig. 2 shows one example of the parse graph.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the AOG has five layers. Nodes in each layer are explained as follows:\n1) The root OR-node Or ∈ VOR in the first layer of the AOG represents different topic configurations and their mutual contextual information. Each topic k (k = 1, ...,K) is represented by an AND-node Atopick in the second layer of the AOG hierarchy with the model parameter θk.\nNews stories are reports of topics, i.e. topic instances, from various TV news networks. We denote a news story by di. For a story di, the scoring function at the root ORnode Or is defined as:\nscoreroot(di; Θ) = max θk∈Θ scoretopic(di; θk), (1)\nwhere scoretopic(di; θk) is the scoring function at A topic k , which will be introduced later.\n2) The topic AND-node Atopick ∈ VAND in the second layer of the hierarchy (as shown in Fig. 2) represents one topic configuration. One topic is composed of the text part and the image part. So Atopick has two children AND-nodes, i.e. the text AND-node Atxtk and the image AND-node Aimgk . The scoring function at A topic k is defined as:\nscoretopic(di; θk) = score txt(dtxti ; θk) + score img(dimgi ; θk)\n+scorejoint(djointi ; θk) + g(fAtopick ),\n(2) where dtxti , d img i and d joint i denote the text part, the image part and their joint information of the story di respectively (di = dtxti ∪ d img i ∪ d joint i ). The two terms scoretxt(dtxti ; θk) and score img(dimgi ; θk) are the scoring functions at Atxtk and A img k respectively. The term scorejoint(djointi ; θk) describes the contextual relations between the text part and the image part. These three terms will be explained later. The function g(fAtopick ) describes the prior of choosing Atopick at root node O\nr. We have the branching frequency fAtopick ∈ θk. We observed that in the broadcast news, dominant topics with a large amount of coverage only constitute a small portion of the whole corpus, and the sizes of most topics are small. Accordingly, we assume that the branching frequencies at Or follow a power law distribution3 (the verification of our observation will be shown in Section 3.5)."

After annotation, we got 355 topics in total.\nTo verify the assumption that the branching frequencies at Or follow the power law distribution, using the collected corpus, we fit the empirical distribution of the story numbers in the topics (i.e. the topic branching frequency) to the power law distribution.

For the above three ratios, about 51.22%, 70.73%, and 82.93% of the topics pass the test, and the average p-values (at the 5% significance level) are 0.2089, 0.3761, and 0.4658 respectively.

To verify the assumption, we do the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test on the 41 remaining large topics to test the goodness of how the data samples fit the Gaussian distribution.

      "text" : "With the hierarchical AOG topic representation, our goal of topic detection is to cluster news stories that describe the same topics and obtain the AOG model parameters Θ for the topics. We pose this clustering problem as a graph partitioning problem in which news stories, as vertices in the adjacency graph, are partitioned into coherent groups. We show one example of the adjacency graph in Fig. 6. Edges in the adjacency graph are associated with certain weights corresponding to related story similarities. Partitions can be obtained by dividing the vertices into groups with specific properties and also keeping the number of edges between separated components small. Graph partitioning can help the news topic detection since even though news stories from one topic develop over time and drift the topic, they can still be grouped together through the connections between temporally adjacent stories with less changes and more similarities.\nFormally, we are given a news story corpus that contains N news stories, i.e. D = {di; i = 1, . . . , N}. The adjacency graph is defined as GADJ = (VADJ, EADJ) where VADJ is a set of vertices and each vertex vi ∈ VADJ corresponds to one news story di. EADJ is a set of\nedges between vertices. The clustering/partition W we are trying to find given D is defined as:\nW = (K,πK ,Θ), (9)\nwhere K is determined automatically while solving the partitioning problem and πK represents the K−partition of the adjacency graph. πK is defined as:\nπK = (V1, ..., VK), ⋃K\nk=1 Vk = VADJ, Vk ∩ Vj = ∅,∀i 6= j.\n(10) This becomes an optimization problem which can be solved by maximizing a Bayesian posterior probability:\nW ∗ = arg max W∈Ω p(W |D) = arg max W∈Ω p(D|W )p(W ). (11)\nThe likelihood probability p(D|W ) is formulated as:\np(D|W ) = N∏ i=1 p(di; Θ) ∝ exp{ ∑ di∈D scoreroot(di; Θ)}.\n(12) The prior probability p(W ) penalizes the partition number K in W and we formulate it as:\np(W ) ∝ exp{−αNK}.

      "heading" : "4.2 Inference by Swendsen-Wang Cuts",
      "text" : "For the topic detection problem formulated above, we adopt a cluster sampling method Swendsen-Wang Cuts (SWC) [17]. It is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method which can sample the solution space Ω efficiently. An alternative method will be the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. But in [51], SWC is shown to be more effective than EM which finds only a local minimum.\nSWC changes the labels of a group of vertices at the same time. It thus solves the coupling problem of Gibbs sampler (which flips a single vertex) by quickly jumping between local minima. SWC starts with an initial partition π, which can be the one which sets all stories to be in the same group, or can be set randomly. We denote the set of edges whose related two vertices belong to the same group under the partition π by E(π). The optimal clustering W ∗ can be obtained by performing the following steps iteratively until convergence.\n(1) Determining edge status. Each edge e =< vi, vj >∈ E(π) is associated with a Bernoulli random variable ue ∈ {0, 1} which indicates the edge’s on/off status and a turn-on probability qe. We define:\nqe = e −D(e)/T , (14)\nwhere T is the temperature factor and D(e) is the distance of these two vertices obtained based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:\nD(e) = ∑ F∈F λF · KL(F (vi)||F (vj)) + KL(F (vj)||F (vi)) 2 ,\n(15)\n9 X X\nX X X X\nV0\nCl\n(a) Before flipping.\nX Ci\nV0\n(b) After flipping.\nFigure 7: SWC flips the selected component V0. The cuts are marked with crosses.\nwhere F (·) denotes one type of feature of the vertex and λF is the weight for feature F . Here we use the distributions for the five components in the text and image parts (i.e. who, where, what, face and object) to construct the feature set F . Moreover, since KL divergence is nonsymmetric, we average the KL divergence of F (vi) given F (vj) and the KL divergence of F (vj) given F (vi) to get a symmetric distance measure for vertices vi and vj . Based on these definitions, in this step, we set ue = 0 (i.e, turn e off) with probability 1− qe for all e ∈ E(π).\n(2) Computing connected components. Once the states ue is determined for each edge e ∈ E(π), the graph G is partitioned into a set of connected components, each of which contains vertices that belong to the same group.\n(3) Selecting a component and flipping it. Among all the connected components formed in (2), we can randomly select one component V0 to flip. We show one example of V0 in Fig. 7a. The target label for V0 can be a new one that has not been used yet or just the same as any other connected components, thus allowing reversible jumps in the solution space. The current partition number is denoted as K ′. Then the number of possible new labels for the selected component is K ′+1. Assuming that V0 ⊆ Vl in the current partition π, we denote a series of sets\nS1 = V1, S2 = V2, ..., Sl = Vl\\V0, SK′ = VK′ , SK′+1 = ∅ (16) that V0 can be merged with. The selected component V0 can be flipped by drawing a random sample l′ with probability\np(l′(V0) = i|V0, π) = γip(πi|D)∑K′+1\nj=1 γjp(πj |D) , (17)\nwhere πi is the partition after assigning the label of the component V0 to be i and keeping other components’ labels the same as in π. We also have\nγi = ∏ e∈Ci (1− qe), (18)\nwhere Ci is the cuts between V0 and Si, i.e. Ci = C(V0, Si) = {< s, t >: s ∈ V0, t ∈ Si}. Two examples of the cuts are shown in Fig. 7, which are marked by the\ncrosses. Theorem 3 in [17] proved that the acceptance rate will be 1 by choosing the new label of V0 by Eq. 17.\nAnother thing to be noted here is that when generating the adjacency graph, we can use a complete graph of N vertices since each pair of news stories can be related. But this may cause problems since a complete graph of N vertices has ( N 2 ) = O(N2) edges and the number of all possible solutions is exponential in the the number of edges, i.e. O(2N 2\n), which requires a long convergence time. By investigating the data, however, one may observe that some story pairs have few similarities in terms of contents. Such pair of stories shall never be grouped together. Hence, graph pruning can be performed before actually running the SWC on the adjacency graph. We define a threshold τ , and cut all edges e whose D(e) ≥ τ deterministically.\nSimulated annealing procedure is conducted in the optimization process. The temperature T in the annealing procedure is slowly decreased according to a cooling schedule."

      "heading" : "5 TOPIC TRACKING",
      "text" : "In this section, we describe our method for tracking a variable number of topics detected in certain continuous time periods. In contrast to traditional topic tracking problem [15] where the topic to be tracked is provided and the task is to determine whether new-coming stories belong to the given topic, we instead link all the detected topics in different time periods to form topic trajectories over time. Then based on the trajectories, we can do further analysis such as the analysis of sentiment/emotion changes as the topic evolves.\nWe divide the whole news data collection into several sub-collections which consist of news stories in different time periods. Topic detection is performed within each sub-collection separately. The sub-collection set of the news corpus D is denoted by {C1, ..., CM} where C1∪...∪CM = D and M is the number of sub-collections. Each sub-collection contains news documents from one specific time span ti. Topics extracted within each subcollection Ci are denoted by Θi = {Θ1i , ...,Θ Ki i }, where Ki is the obtained topic number. For topic tracking, we link topics detected in the subcollections. One optional method for solving the linking problem is to do another clustering on the detected topics using SWC. But to fast obtain the topic links, we choose to measure the similarities between topics by considering both the topic content similarities and their temporal distances, and use a threshold to decide whether they can be linked. Topic content similarity is defined based on the proposed hierarchical topic representation which models both the textual and visual information. Formally, in the tracking process, the similarity measurement to decide whether two topics can be linked is calculated as:\nSim(Θk1i1 ,Θ k2 i2 ) = αsim exp{−βkl[KL(Θk1i1 ||Θ k2 i2 )\n+KL(Θk2i2 ||Θ k1 i1 )]}+ (1− αsim) exp{−|ti1 − ti2 |}, (19)\n10\nwhere i1 6= i2, and αsim and βkl are positive parameters. Note that using the proposed topic representation, each topic is composed of the image part and the text part, and they can be further divided into the ”who”, ”where” and ”what” components, and the face and object components respectively. Thus we have five components in total. Each component is represented using one model. The KL divergence of one topic given another is therefore averaged over these models:\nKL(Θk1i1 ||Θ k2 i2 ) = 5∑ j=1 λjKL(Θk1,jm1 ||Θ k2,j i2 ), (20)\nwhere λj is the corresponding weight for different parts. Θk1,ji1 and Θ k2,j m2 are the histograms of word frequencies for the j-th component. After calculating the topic similarities using Eq. 19, a threshold τlink can be used for pruning the links between topics to get the final topic trajectories."

It is widely used for the evaluation of clustering and classification methods. The dataset contains 21,758 stories which belong to 135 clusters/categories. The clusters/categories are annotated manually. Only textual information is contained in the dataset.\n2) UCLA Broadcast News Dataset. We collected a multimedia broadcast news dataset from UCLA Library Broadcast NewsScape. Five US networks are included in the dataset: CNN, MSNBC, FOX, ABC, and CBS. It contains 379 news videos broadcasted in the time period from June 1, 2013 to June 14, 2013. The total length of the videos is about 362 hours. Several programs from each news network are included in the dataset, such as ”CNN Newsroom”, ”CNN Situation Room”, ”MSNBC News Live”, ”FOX Morning News”, ”ABC Eyewitness News”, ”ABC Nightline”, ”CBS News”, etc.\nAnnotation: We annotate the UCLA Broadcast News Dataset for topic detection and tracking. One annotation choice can be letting the annotators manually group the new stories based on their related topics [8], [1]. However, this will be a hard task and the results may not be accurate since there can be hundreds of news topics even in one week and the annotators can hardly remember all the previously found topics during annotation. So instead of this, we choose to build the ground-truth by letting annotators decide whether a pair of stories belong to the same topic or not. The topic granularity is chosen to be at the event level, like the definition in the TDT system [1]. In other words, two stories talking about the same event (or closely related ones) belong to the same\n4. Reuters-21578 dataset can be downloaded at http://www. daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/.\ntopic. Since it takes a long time to annotate all story pairs (about N2 pairs for N stories), we choose to annotate a subset selected from the whole story pair collection. We first compute the cosine distances between the two stories in the same pair, and then select 10,000 story pairs to be annotated randomly from the pair set where all pair distances are within the range [0.6, 0.9]. This specific range is chosen for the reason that the corresponding story relations are ambiguous compared to other ranges. Three annotators are involved in the annotation and for each story pair we treat the relation that most annotators agree as the ground-truth relation.\nThis dataset is mainly used for quantitative evaluation of our method. To show how our method work on largescale datasets qualitatively, we also apply our method to more news data from the UCLA Library Broadcast NewsScape."

      "text" : "The implementation details (including the preprocessing procedures) for the two datasets used in the experiment are described below:\n1) Reuters-21578: In the experiment, stories with multiple cluster labels are discarded and for the remaining stories, only those from the largest 10 clusters are selected [6].\n2) UCLA Broadcast News Dataset: We utilize texts from both video frames and closed captions (CC). Text extraction on video frames is performed using optical character recognition (OCR) based on Google OCR engine Tesseract [52], and the results are further refined using the spatial-temporal relations between frames. News CC consist of several stories in one single continuous text stream. Story segmentation needs to be performed to divide the CC into stories. In CC, some special markers are used as the indicators of story boundaries, such as ”>>>”. Moreover, many news programs insert commercials between stories with special formats of letter cases and indentations. Thus we also do commercial detection based on these special formats. Using the special boundary markers and commercial detection results, most stories boundaries are determined. For the remaining boundaries, we train a classifier using Support Vector Machine to decide the boundary locations based on features including the boundary key words (such as ”coming up”, ”still ahead”), and similarities of sentences near the boundaries.\nFor the news videos, we extract the keyframes by removing the commercial frames, redundant frames and anchor frames. Commercial frames can be specified using the aforementioned commercial detection results from CC. Redundant frames are those perceived to be similar to the previous frames. We use the frame histograms to decide whether one incoming frame is similar to the previously detected non-redundant frame. After removing the commercial and redundant frames, we further detect anchor frames among the remaining\n11\nframes. Anchor frames are those containing the news anchors. They usually appear repeatedly in the video. We detect the anchor frames by exploiting features from two aspects: anchor frames’ backgrounds (they usually show the news studios and thus are similar in the videos), and anchors’ faces. Similar backgrounds and faces are grouped by clustering. We can then check the clusters’ time distribution and decide whether the corresponding frames are anchor frames or not.\nFig. 8 illustrates the results that can be obtained in the previous preprocessing procedure. After preprocessing, we got 3,633 news stories including 577,721 words and 36,810 keyframes. The whole collection contains 24,036 unique word terms."

Only texts are used in the comparison.\nEvaluation Protocol. On Reuters-21578, we follow the evaluation protocol in [6], [53]. Two metrics are used to evaluate the clustering performance, i.e. accuracy, and normalized mutual information. To compute the accuracy, the obtained clusters are mapped to the groundtruth clusters in the dataset. The accuracy is then defined as the percentage of the documents that have the correct cluster labels after mapping. The mutual information\nmeasures the mutual dependence of the ground-truth cluster assignments and the obtained clustering assignments for the documents. The normalized mutual information is a normalized version of this measure. More details of the definitions of these two metrics can be found in [53].\nBaseline Methods. Several baseline methods are included in the comparison, namely:\n• K-means and Normalized Cuts (NC) [54], which are widely used clustering and graph partitioning algorithms. • Nonnegative-Matrix-Factorization (NMF) based clustering [55], Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [21], and Locally Consistent Concept Factorization (LCCF) [53], which are factorization based methods that are very effective in document clustering. • LDA related methods: 1) LDA + K-means [6]: using LDA to learn the topics and the topic distribution for each document, and then clustering using K-Means based on these distributions; 2) LDA + Naive [6]: using LDA to learn the topics and the documents’ topic distributions, and then treating the label of the most dominant topic as the cluster label for each document. • Multi-grain clustering topic model (MGCTM) [6] which integrates document clustering and topic modeling. It has the best clustering result on Reuters-21578 so far.\nThe inputs of these methods in the comparison are the documents’ tf-idf vectors [6], [53]. Stop words are removed from the documents. These methods all require the cluster number to be specified in the input. Thus for these methods, we set the cluster number K = 10 in the experiment, which equals the ground-truth cluster number in the dataset. Please refer to [6] for other detailed settings of these algorithms.\nParameter Settings of Our Method. To compare with the baseline algorithms, in our method, we add a Gaussian prior term with the mean µ = 10 and variance σ2 = 0.5 to Eq. 13 to make the sampling process converge to the state where the cluster number equals 10. The parameter α in Eq. 13 is set as α = 0.2. The weights {λF , F ∈ F} in Eq. 15 are set as: λFwho = 0.1, λFwhere = 0.1, λFwhat = 0.4, λFface = 0.1 and λFobject = 0.3. The threshold τ used for graph pruning is set as τ = 160.\nComparison Results. Table 1 shows the comparison results of different methods on Reuters-21578. It can be seen from the results that our approach is better than the other methods in terms of both the clustering accuracy and the normalized mutual information. This is because our method uses the AOG representation which organizes the information in a hierarchical way and embeds the contexts between different components. The cluster sampling method SWC also plays an important role in getting the optimal solution. Other methods generally use the basic word distributions and most of the solutions they get are not global optimal.\n12"

Multi-modal baseline methods are also included in the comparison, including the multimodal coclustering method in [8], and the multi-modality graph with topic recovery method (MMG+TR) in [36].

To generate the precision-recall curve, we change the parameter αK in Eq. 13 for our method. Other parameter settings are the same as those in the qualitative experiment. To compare with the single-modal methods, we also conduct experiments where only the text information is included.\nComparison Results. Fig. 9 shows the precision-recall curves for different methods. As we can see from the figure, based on merely text information, our method has better performance than the other single-modal methods. This shows that the proposed hierarchical AOG topic representation and the clustering sampling method we use can help generate better topics. With the visual information added, our performance gets further improved, showing the effectiveness of our method which jointly models the text and visual information."

To track topics over time, we divide the whole collection of news stories in the UCLA Broadcast News Dataset into 14 sub-collections each of which contains news stories from one day. Topic detection is firstly performed within each sub-collection. Then given the detected topics, we further do topic tracking, which links topics over time and generate topic trajectories.

In the figure each circle corresponds to one detected topic. The topics are summarized in several words here for space constraints. The size of the circle is proportional to the topic size.

Three emotional variables, i.e. fear, anger and sadness, are included in the analysis and the ternary plot on these variables is shown in Fig. 14.

From these trajectories, we can clearly see how these topics develop over time and how they can relate to each other.\nWe also made a case study based on our method, which tracks the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The large-scale topic detection and tracking results are visualized in the Viz2016 website (mentioned in Section 1.1)."

      "heading" : "7 CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "We have presented a joint image-text news topic detection and tracking method. We use the And-Or graph as a structured topic representation, which models the image and text parts of topics jointly. We detect topics using the SWC-based cluster sampling method. Topics are also tracked over time to deal with the continuous updates of news streams. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation results both show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed topic detection and tracking method.\nIn the future, we want to expand our study to the problem of media analysis for social and political science research. Based on our topic detection and tracking results, we can analyze how media are biased for different topics, what is the agenda-setting pattern, what is the causal relations between topics, etc."

We present a hierarchical And-Or graph (AOG) to jointly represent the latent structure of both texts and visuals. The AOG embeds a context sensitive grammar that can describe the hierarchical composition of news topics by semantic elements about people involved, related places and what happened, and model contextual relationships between elements in the hierarchy. We detect news topics through a cluster sampling process which groups stories about closely related events. Swendsen-Wang Cuts (SWC), an effective cluster sampling algorithm, is adopted for traversing the solution space and obtaining optimal clustering solutions by maximizing a Bayesian posterior probability. Topics are tracked to deal with the continuously updated news streams. We generate topic trajectories to show how topics emerge, evolve and disappear over time. The experimental results show that our method can explicitly describe the textual and visual data in news videos and produce meaningful topic trajectories. Our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on both a public dataset Reuters-21578 and a self-collected dataset named UCLA Broadcast News Dataset.",
