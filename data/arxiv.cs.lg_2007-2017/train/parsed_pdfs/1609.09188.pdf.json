      "text" : "Academic researchers often need to face with a large collection of research papers in the literature. This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. Researchers usually use keywords to search for related papers using a search engine. After reading some papers, they then try to group related papers together to discover the main topics in the field. This process can be time-consuming.\nThe approach above can be regarded as bottom-up approach. A top-down approach would be to start with topic hierarchy. Researchers can then pick a general topic and drill down to more specific topics. Papers related to any of the topics can be presented to the researchers when requested.\nTo allow the top-down approach, traditionally a taxonomy has to be defined manually. Papers can then be manually categorized according to the taxonomy. One problem with the traditional method is that it requires much effort. Besides, the topics in the taxonomy may not be able to keep up with recent development.\nTopic models can be used to automate this process. They can be used to detect topics from a collection of documents\nCopyright c© 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nand categorize documents according to the detected topics. We use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA) (Liu, Zhang, and Chen 2014; Chen et al. 2016) for topic modeling. Unlike Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003), HLTA yields a hierarchy of topics. hLDA (Blei, Griffiths, and Jordan 2010) and nHDP (Paisley et al. 2015) are two extensions of LDA for producing topic hierarchy. However, HLTA has been recently shown to produce better quality of topics and topic hierarchy than the two LDA extensions (Chen et al. 2016).\nTo facilitate the top-down approach, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model built with HLTA. The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the next section we review background of our work. We then explain HLTA using an example. Next, we describe the procedure for building the online catalog. In the following section, we show the results and observations obtained from the online catalog. After that, we conclude the paper."

      "text" : "In topic modeling, documents are usually represented as bags of words. Consider a collection D = {d1, . . . , dN} of N documents . Suppose M words are included in the vocabulary V = {w1, . . . , wM}. Each document d can be represented as a vector d = (c1, . . . , cM ), where ci represents the count of word wi occurring in the document d. The aim of topic modeling is to detect a number K of topics z1, . . . , zK among the documents D. The number K can be given or learned. The topic model defines a distribution over words for each topic. A topic is often characterized by representative words based on the distribution.\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular method for topic modeling (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003; Blei 2012). LDA assumes each document d to belong to the K topics according to a distribution P (Z = zk|d) over the topics.\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n09 18\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n9 Se\np 20\n16\nIn other words, ∑K\n1 P (zk|d) = 1. This kind of model is known as mixed membership model. For each topic zk, LDA defines a conditional distribution P (wi|zk) over words wi. A topic zk can then be characterized by the most probable words according to P (wi|zk)."

      "heading" : "Latent Tree Models",
      "text" : "A latent tree model (LTM) is a tree-structured probabilistic graphical model (Zhang 2004; Chen et al. 2012). Figure 2a shows an example of LTM. When an LTM is used for topic modeling, the leaf nodes represent the observed word variables W , whereas the internal nodes represent the unobserved topic variables Z. All variables are binary. Each word variable Wi ∈W indicates the presence or absence of the word wi ∈ V in a document. Each topic variable Zi ∈ Z indicates whether a document belongs to the i-th topic.\nFor technical convenience, we often root an LTM at one of its latent nodes and regard it as a Bayesian network (Pearl 1988). Then all the edges are directed away from the root. The numerical information of the model includes a marginal distribution for the root and one conditional distribution for each edge. For example, edge Z1314→ dean is associated with probability P (dean|Z1314). The conditional distribution associated with each edge characterizes the probabilistic dependence between the two nodes that the edge connects. The product of all those distributions defines a joint distribution over all the latent variables Z and observed variables W . Denote the parent of a variable X as pa(X) and let pa(X) be an empty set when X is the root. Then the LTM defines a joint distribution over all observed and latent variables as follows:\nP (W ,Z) = ∏\nX∈W∪Z\nP (X|pa(X))\n. Given a document d, the values of word variables W are observed. Use d = (w1, . . . , wM ) to denote also those observed values. Whether a document d belongs to a topic Z ∈ Z can be determined by the probability P (Z|d). The LTM gives a multi-membership model since a document can belong to multiple topics. Unlike in LDA, the topic probabilities P (Z|d) in LTM do not necessarily sum to one."

      "text" : "For topic modeling, an LTM has to be learned from the document dataD. This requires learning the number of topic variables, the connection between the variables, and the probabilities in the model.\nWe use the method PEM-HLTA proposed by Chen et al. (2016) to build LTMs for topic modeling. The method builds LTMs level by level and is thus also known as hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA). In this section, we use an example to illustrate the main ideas of PEM-HLTA. Readers are referred to the original paper for details.\nAs an example, consider a data set that contains the 24 word variables in Figure 2a. PEM-HLTA is an iterative procedure that builds one level of model in each iteration. In the first iteration, it partitions the 24 word variables in 6 clusters (Figure 1c). The clusters are unidimensional in the sense that\nthe co-occurrences of words in each cluster can be properly modeled using a single latent variable. A latent variable is introduced for each cluster to form model in which all variables in a cluster are connected to the latent variable. We metaphorically refer to those models corresponding to the clusters as islands and the latent variables in them as level-1 latent variables.\nThe next step is to link up the 6 islands. This is done by estimating the mutual information (MI) (Cover and Thomas 2006) between every pair of latent variables and building a Chow-Liu tree (Chow and Liu 1968) over them, so as to form an overall model (Liu et al. 2015). The result is the model in the Figure 1b.\nTo build the next level of model, inference is carried out to compute the posterior distribution of each level-1 latent variable for each document. The document is assigned to the state with the maximum posterior probability, resulting in a data set over the level-1 latent variables. The data set is used as the input for the next iteration. In the second iteration, the level-1 latent variables are partitioned into 2 groups. The 2 islands are linked up to form the model shown in Figure 1a. The model in Figure 1a is then stacked on the model in Figure 1b and a new data set over level-2 latent variables are computed. The iteration continues until the model in Figure 2a is obtained.\nIntuitively, the co-occurrence of words are captured by the level-1 latent variables, whose co-occurring patterns are captured by higher level latent variables. Then a topic hierarchy can be extracted, with topics on top more general and topics at the bottom more specific.\nAlgorithm 1 Find-NGrams(D,m,M) Input: D – Document collection, m – maximum value of n, M – number of tokens to be selected. Output: A document collection with individual words replaced by selected n-grams.\n1: Find individual words for each d ∈ D. 2: Set V to be the set of the M selected words. 3: for n = 2 to m do 4: For each d ∈ D, form an n-gram for each pair of\nconsecutive tokens t1, t2 in d if t1, t2 ∈ V and if the resulting n-gram has a length of n.\n5: Denote the set of newly formed n-grams by U . 6: Set V to be the set of M tokens t ∈ V ∪ U that have the highest tf-idf(t). 7: For each d ∈ D, replace all pairs of consecutive to-\nkens that can be used to form an n-gram in V . Let D be the collection of documents after replacement.\n8: end for 9: return D."

      "text" : "After text is extracted, we compute the term frequency and document frequency. The term frequency tf(w, d) is defined as the number of occurrences of a word w in document d. The document frequency df(w) is defined as the number of documents that contain the word w.\nWe remove words that occur in more than 25% of documents. In other words, a word w is removed if df(w) ≥ 0.25N , where N is the number of documents. Given a number M , we select the M words with highest TF-IDF, which is given by:\ntf-idf(w) = 1\nln df(w) ∑ d∈D tf(w, d).\n1http://pdfbox.apache.org/ 2http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/ 3http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume5/lewis04a/a11-smart-\nstop-list/english.stop\nAfter selecting the words, we can represent each document d as a vector d = (w1, . . . , wM ), where wi corresponds to one of the selected words and its value indicates the presence (wi = 1) or absence (wi = 0) of the word in d.\nInspired by Deng et al. (2016), we consider also ngrams in addition to individual words. For a given value of m, we consider 1-grams, 2-grams, and so on up to m-grams. We also use the term tokens to refer to the ngrams. The leaf nodes of the model in Figure 2a show some examples of n-grams. The examples of 2-grams include vector-representation and word-vector, and an example of 3-gram is conference-world-wide.\nThe n-grams in a collection of documentsD can be found by Algorithm 1. After running the algorithm, each document can be converted to a binary vector similarly as above.\nThe tree structure of LTM limits a word variable to be connected to exactly one parent. The inclusion of ngrams mitigates this limitation. For example, the word bayesian may be related to statistics and the word network to social networks or communities. The 2-gram bayesian-network means a class of graphical models and has a different meaning from the individual words. By including 2-grams, the three tokens are allowed to three different parent nodes that are more closely to their respective meanings."

      "text" : "An LTM defines a tree structure of nodes. Each internal node represents a topic. Since the model defines a joint distribution over the variables, we can compute the MI between every pair of variables. For each topic, we compute the MI between each descendent word variable and the topic variable. We then pick the descendent words with highest MI to characterize the topic.\nAs an example, consider extracting topics from the model in Figure 2a. Each shaded node represents a topic. Suppose we want to characterize Z344. The descendent word variables are vector-representation, word-vector, . . ., shaw. We compute the MI between Z344 and each of those word variables. The 7 words with highest MI are shown in the shaded row in Figure 2b. The row corresponds to the topic represented by Z344. The second and third rows correspond to the topics represented by Z2121 and Z1313 respectively. The topic extraction from the model in Figure 2a results in the topic hierarchy shown in Figure 2b.\nIn addition to finding the characterizing words, we also estimate the size of each topic Z, which is given by the marginal probability P (Z). It shows how often a topic is estimated to occur in a document collection. In Figure 2b, the number on each row indicates the topic size."
