      "text" : "Gaussian Process (GP) learning and inference are computationally prohibitive with large datasets, having time complexitiesO(n3) andO(n2), where n is the number of training points. Sparsification algorithms exist that scale linearly in the training set size (see [9] for a review). They construct a low-rank approximation to the GP covariance matrix over the full dataset using a small set of inducing points. Some approaches select inducing points from training points [6, 7, 11, 12]. But these methods select the inducing points using ad hoc criteria; i.e., they use different objective functions to select inducing points and to optimize GP hyperparameters. More powerful sparsification methods [13, 14, 15] use a single objective function and allow inducing points to move freely over the input domain which are learned via gradient descent. This continuous relaxation is not feasible, however, if the input domain is discrete, or if the kernel function is not differentiable in the input variables. As a result, there are problems in myraid domains, like bio-informatics, linguistics and computer vision where current sparse GP regression methods are inapplicable or ineffective.\nWe introduce an efficient sparsification algorithm for GP regression. The method optimizes a single objective for joint selection of inducing points and GP hyperparameters. Notably, it optimizes either the marginal likelihood, or a variational free energy [14], exploiting the QR factorization of a partial Cholesky decomposition to efficiently approximate the covariance matrix. Because it chooses inducing points from the training data, it is applicable to problems on discrete or continuous input domains. To our knowledge, it is the first method for selecting discrete inducing points and hyperparameters that optimizes a single objective, with linear space and time complexity. It is shown to outperform other methods on discrete datasets from bio-informatics and computer vision. On continuous domains it is competitive with the Pseudo-point GP [13] (SPGP)."

      "text" : "Efficient state-of-the-art sparsification methods are O(m2n) in time and O(mn) in space for learning. They compute the predictive mean and variance in time O(m) and O(m2). Methods based on continuous relaxation, when applicable, entail learning O(md) continuous parameters, where d is the input dimension. In the discrete case, combinatorial optimization is required to select the inducing points, and this is, in general, intractable. Existing discrete sparsification methods therefore use other criteria to greedily select inducing points [6, 7, 11, 12]. Although their criteria are justified,\nar X\niv :1\n31 0.\n60 07\nv3 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 1\nN ov\neach in their own way (e.g., [7, 11] take an information theoretic perspective), they are greedy and do not use the same objective to select inducing points and to estimate GP hyperparameters.\nThe variational formulation of Titsias [14] treats inducing points as variational parameters, and gives a unified objective for discrete and continuous inducing point models. In the continuous case, it uses gradient-based optimization to find inducing points and hyperparameters. In the discrete case, our method optimizes the same variational objective of Titsias [14], but is a significant improvement over greedy forward selection using the variational objective as selection criteria, or some other criteria. In particular, given the cost of evaluating the variational objective on all training points, Titsias [14] evaluates the objective function on a small random subset of candidates at each iteration, and then select the best element from the subset. This approximation is often slow to achieve good results, as we explain and demonstrate below in Section 4.1. The approach in [14] also uses greedy forward selection, which provides no way to refine the inducing set after hyperparameter optimization, except to discard all previous inducing points and restart selection. Hence, the objective is not guaranteed to decrease after each restart. By comparison, our formulation considers all candidates at each step, and revisiting previous selections is efficient, and guaranteed to decrease the objective or terminate.\nOur low-rank decomposition is inspired by the Cholesky with Side Information (CSI) algorithm for kernel machines [1]. We extend that approach to GP regression. First, we alter the form of the lowrank matrix factorization in CSI to be suitable for GP regression with full-rank diagonal term in the covariance. Second, the CSI algorithm selects inducing points in a single greedy pass using an approximate objective. We propose an iterative optimization algorithm that swaps previously selected points with new candidates that are guaranteed to lower the objective. Finally, we perform inducing set selection jointly with gradient-based hyperparameter estimation instead of the grid search in CSI. Our algorithm selects inducing points in a principled fashion, optimizing the variational free energy or the log likelihood. It does so with time complexity O(m2n), and in practice provides an improved quality-speed trade-off over other discrete selection methods."

Let y ∈ Rn denote the corresponding vector of training outputs. Under a full zero-mean GP, with the covariance function\nE[yiyj ] = κ(xi,xj) + σ21[i = j] , (1)\nwhere κ is the kernel function, 1[·] is the usual indicator function, and σ2 is the variance of the observation noise, the predictive distribution over the output f? at a test point x? is normally distributed. The mean and variance of the predictive distribution can be expressed as\nµ? = κ(x?) T ( K + σ2In )−1 y\nv2? = κ(x?,x?)− κ(x?) T ( K + σ2In )−1 κ(x?)\nwhere In is the n × n identity matrix, K is the kernel matrix whose ijth element is κ(xi,xj), and κ(x?) is the column vector whose ith element is κ(x?,xi).\nThe hyperparameters of a GP, denoted θ, comprise the parameters of the kernel function, and the noise variance σ2. The natural objective for learning θ is the negative marginal log likelihood (NMLL) of the training data, − log (P (y|X,θ)), given up to a constant by\nEfull(θ) = (y >(K+σ2In)−1y + log |K+σ2In| ) / 2 . (2)\nThe computational bottleneck lies in the O(n2) storage and O(n3) inversion of the full covariance matrix, K + σ2In. To lower this cost with a sparse approximation, Csató and Opper [4] and Seeger et al. [11] proposed the Projected Process (PP) model, wherein a set of m inducing points are used to construct a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix. In the discrete case, where the inducing points are a subset of the training data, with indices I ⊂ {1, 2, ..., n}, this approach amounts to replacing the kernel matrix K with the following Nyström approximation [10]:\nK ' K̂ = K[:, I]K[I, I]−1K[I, :] (3) where K[:, I] denotes the sub-matrix of K comprising columns indexed by I, and K[I, I] is the sub-matrix of K comprising rows and columns indexed by I. We assume the rank of K is m or\nhigher so we can always find such rank-m approximations. The PP NMLL is then algebraically equivalent to replacing K with K̂ in Eq. (2), i.e.,\nE(θ, I) = ( ED(θ, I) + EC(θ, I) ) /2 , (4)\nwith data term ED(θ, I) = y>(K̂+σ2In)−1y, and model complexity EC(θ, I) = log |K̂+σ2In|.\nThe computational cost reduction from O(n3) to O(m2n) associated with the new likelihood is achieved by applying the Woodbury inversion identity to ED(θ, I) and EC(θ, I). The objective in (4) can be viewed as an approximate log likelihood for the full GP model, or as the exact log likelihood for an approximate model, called the Deterministically Trained Conditional [9].\nThe same PP model can also be obtained by a variational argument, as in [14], for which the variational free energy objective can be shown to be Eq. (4) plus one extra term; i.e.,\nF (θ, I) = ( ED(θ, I) + EC(θ, I) + EV(θ, I) ) / 2 , (5)\nwhere EV (θ, I) = σ−2 tr(K−K̂) arises from the variational formulation. It effectively regularizes the trace norm of the approximation residual of the covariance matrix. The kernel machine of [1] also uses a regularizer of the form λ tr(K−K̂), however λ is a free parameter that is set manually."

(The negative log-likelihood (4) is similarly minimized by simply discarding the EV term.) The algorithm is a form of hybrid coordinate descent that alternates between discrete optimization of inducing points, and continuous optimization of the hyperparameters. We first describe the algorithm to select inducing points, and then discuss continuous hyperparameter optimization and termination criteria in Sec. 3.4.\nFinding the optimal inducing set is a combinatorial problem; global optimization is intractable. Instead, the inducing set is initialized to a random subset of the training data, which is then refined by a fixed number of swap updates at each iteration.1 In a single swap update, a randomly chosen inducing point is considered for replacement. If swapping does not improve the objective, then the original point is retained. There are n −m potential replacements for each each swap update; the key is to efficiently determine which will maximally improve the objective. With the techniques described below, the computation time required to approximately evaluate all possible candidates and swap an inducing point is O(mn). Swapping all inducing points once takes O(m2n) time."

Given an inducing set I of k points, for any k ≤ m, the low-rank Nyström approximation to the kernel matrix (Eq. 3) can be expressed in terms of a partial Cholesky factorization:\nK̂ = K[:, I]K[I, I]−1K[I, :] = L(I)L(I)> , (6)\nwhere L(I) ∈ Rn×k is, up to permutation of rows, lower trapezoidal matrix (i.e., has a k × k top lower triangular block, again up to row permutation). The derivation of Eq. 6 follows from Proposition 1 in [1], and the fact that, given the ordered sequence of pivots I, the partial Cholesky factorization is unique.\nUsing this factorization and the Woodbury identities (dropping the dependence on θ and I for clarity), the terms of the negative marginal log-likelihood (4) and variational free energy (5) become\nED = σ−2 ( y>y − y>L ( L>L+ σ2I )−1 L>y ) (7)\nEC = log ( (σ2)n−k|L>L+ σ2I| ) (8)\nEV = σ−2(tr(K)− tr(L>L)) (9)\n1The inducing set can be incrementally constructed, as in [1], however we found no benefit to this.\nWe can further simplify the data term by augmenting the factor matrix as L̃ = [L>, σIk]>, where Ik is the k×k identity matrix, and ỹ = [yT,0Tk ] T is the y vector with k zeroes appended:\nED = σ−2 ( y>y − ỹ>L̃ (L̃>L̃)−1 L̃>ỹ ) (10)\nNow, let L̃ = QR be a QR factorization of L̃, where Q ∈ R(n+k)×k has orthogonal columns and R ∈ Rk×k is invertible.

We first modify the factor matrices in order to remove point i from Im, i.e. to downdate the factors. Then we update all the key terms using one step of Cholesky and QR factorization with the new point j.\nDowndating to remove inducing point i requires that we shift the corresponding columns/rows in the factorization to the right-most columns of L̃, Q, R and to the last row of R. We can then simply discard these last columns and rows, and modify related quantities. When permuting the order of the inducing points, the underlying GP model is invariant, but the matrices in the factored representation are not. If needed, any two points in Im, can be permuted, and the Cholesky or QR factors can be updated in time O(mn). This is done with the efficient pivot permutation presented in the Appendix of [1], with minor modifications to account for the augmented form of L̃. In this way, downdating and removing i take O(mn) time, as does the updating with point j.\nAfter downdating, we have factors L̃m−1,Qm−1, Rm−1, and inducing set Im−1. To add j to Im−1, and update the factors to rank m, one step of Cholesky factorization is performed with point j, for which, ideally, the new columnto append to L̃ is formed as\n`m = (K−K̂m−1)[:, j] /√ (K−K̂m−1)[j, j] (13)\nwhere K̂m−1 = Lm−1Lm−1T. Then, we set L̃m = [L̃m−1 ˜̀m], where ˜̀m is just `m augmented with σem = [0, 0, ..., σ, ..., 0, 0]>. The final updates are Qm = [Qm−1 qm], where qm is given by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, qm = ((I−Qm−1Q>m−1)˜̀m) / ‖(I −Qm−1Q>m−1)˜̀m‖, and Rm is updated from Rm−1 so that L̃m = QmRm."

Thus, instead of evaluating the change in the objective exactly, we use an efficient approximation based on a small number, z, of training points which provide\ninformation about the residual between the current low-rank covariance matrix (based on inducing points) and the full covariance matrix. After this approximation proposes a candidate, we use the actual objective to decide whether to include it. The techniques below reduce the complexity of evaluating all n−m candidates to O(zn). To compute the change in objective for one candidate, we need the new column of the updated Cholesky factorization, `m. In Eq. (13) this vector is a (normalized) column of the residual K − K̂m−1 between the full kernel matrix and the Nyström approximation. Now consider the full Cholesky decomposition of K = L∗L∗> where L∗ = [Lm−1, L(Jm−1)] is constructed with Im−1 as the first pivots and Jm−1 = {1, ..., n}\\Im−1 as the remaining pivots, so the residual becomes K− K̂m−1 = L(Jm−1)L(Jm−1)>. We approximate L(Jm−1) by a rank z n matrix, Lz , by taking z points from Jm−1 and performing a partial Cholesky factorization of K− K̂m−1 using these pivots. The residual approximation becomes K− K̂m−1 ≈ LzL>z , and thus `m ≈ (LzL>z )[:, j] /√ (LzL>z )[j, j]. The pivots used to construct Lz are called information\npivots; their selection is discussed in Sec. 3.3.2.\nThe approximations to ∆EDk , ∆E C k and ∆E V k , Eqs. (14)-(16), for all candidate points, involve the following terms: diag(LzL>z LzL > z ), y >LzL > z , and (Qk−1[1 : n, :]) > LzL > z . The first term can be computed in time O(z2n), and the other two in O(zmn) with careful ordering of matrix multiplications.2 Computing Lz costs O(z2n), but can be avoided since information pivots change by at most one when an information pivots is added to the inducing set and needs to be replaced. The techniques in Sec. 3.2 bring the associated update cost to O(zn) by updating Lz rather than recomputing it. These z information pivots are equivalent to the “look-ahead” steps of Bach and Jordan’s CSI algorithm, but as described in Sec. 3.3.2, there is a more effective way to select them."

      "heading" : "3.3.2 Ensuring a good approximation",
      "text" : "Selection of the information pivots determines the approximate objective, and hence the candidate proposal. To ensure a good approximation, the CSI algorithm [1] greedily selects points to find an approximation of the residual K− K̂m−1 in Eq. (13) that is optimal in terms of a bound of the trace norm. The goal, however, is to approximate Eqs. (14)-(16) . By analyzing the role of the residual matrix, we see that the information pivots provide a low-rank approximation to the orthogonal complement of the space spanned by current inducing set. With a fixed set of information pivots, parts of that subspace may never be captured. This suggests that we might occasionally update the entire set of information pivots. Although information pivots are changed when one is moved into the inducing set, we find empirically that this is not insufficient. Instead, at regular intervals we replace the entire set of information pivots by random selection. We find this works better than optimizing the information pivots as in [1].\nFigure 1 compares the exact and approximate cost reduction for candidate inducing points (left), and their respective rankings (right). The approximation is shown to work well. It is also robust to changes in the number of information pivots and the frequency of updates. When bad candidates are proposed, they are rejected after evaluating the change in the true objective. We find that rejection rates are typically low during early iterations (< 20%), but increase as opti-\nmization nears convergence (to 30% or 40%). Rejection rates also increase for sparser models, where each inducing point plays a more critical role and is harder to replace."

It alternates between discrete and continuous phases until improvement in the objective is below a threshold or the computational time budget is exhausted.\nIn the discrete phase, inducing points are considered for swapping with the hyper-parameters fixed. With the factorization and efficient candidate evaluation above, swapping an inducing point i ∈ Im\n2Both can be further reduced to O(zn) by appropriate caching during the updates of Q,R and L̃, and Lz\nproceeds as follows: (I) down-date the factorization matrices as in Sec. 3.2 to remove i; (II) compute the true objective function value Fm−1 over the down-dated model with Im\\{i}, using (11), (12) and (9); (III) select a replacement candidate using the fast approximate cost change from Sec. 3.3.1; (IV) evaluate the exact objective change, using (14), (15), and (16); (V) add the exact change to the true objective Fm−1 to get the objective value with the new candidate. If this improves, we include the candidate in I and update the matrices as in Sec. 3.2. Otherwise it is rejected and we revert to the factorization with i; (VI) if needed, update the information pivots as in Secs. 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.\nAfter each discrete optimization step we fix the inducing set I and optimize the hyperparameters using non-linear conjugate gradients (CG). The equivalence in (6) allows us to compute the gradient with respect to the hyperparameters analytically using the Nyström form. In practice, because we alternate each phase for many training epochs, attempting to swap every inducing point in each epoch is unnecessary, just as there is no need to run hyperparameter optimization until convergence. As long as all inducing set points are eventually considered we find that optimized models can achieve similar performance with shorter learning times."

For learning continuous hyperparameters, each method optimizes the same objective using non-linear CG. Care is taken to ensure consist initialization and termination criteria [3].

We do 50-fold random splits to 3660 training points and 192 test points for repeated runs. We use a compound kernel, comprising 14 different graph kernels, and 15 continuous hyperparameters (one noise variance and 14 data variances).

Because our goal is the general purpose sparsification method for GP regression, we make no attempt at the more difficult problem of modelling the multivariate output structure in the regression as in [2]. Instead, we predict the vertical position of joints independently, using a histogram intersection kernel [8], having four hyperparameters: one noise variance, and three data variances corresponding to the kernel evaluated over the HoG from each of three cameras. We select and show result on the representative left wrist here (see [3] for others joints, and more details about the datasets and kernels used).\nThe results in Fig. 2 and 3 show that CholQR-z16 outperforms the baseline methods in terms of test-time predictive power with significantly lower training time. Titsias-16 and Titsias-512 shows similar test performance, but they are two to four orders of magnitude slower than CholQR-z16 (see Figs. 3(d) and 3(e)). Indeed, Fig. 3(a) shows that the training time for CholQR-z16 is comparable to IVM and Random selection, but with much better performance. The poor performance of Random selection highlights the importance of selecting good inducing points, as no amount of hyperparameter optimization can correct for poor inducing points. Fig. 3(a) also shows IVM to be somewhat slower due to the increased number of iterations needed, even though per epoch, IVM is faster than CholQR.
