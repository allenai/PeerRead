      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION Consider a moving target confined to the road network illustrated in Fig. 1. Assume that the target is being tracked by a ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar system. At each discrete time k, let zk denote the noisy GMTI measurement and xk denote the state vector comprising position and velocity of the target as it moves in two dimensional space. Also, dk and lk denote, respectively, the direction of motion and the location (road or intersection names) of the target.\nClassical (base-level) tracking algorithms have been well studied in the literature [1] [2]. These include the variable structure interacting multiple model (VSIMM) tracker. In a VSIMM tracker, the direction sequence d1:k = (d1, . . . , dk) is modeled as a Markov chain with state space dependent on the location sequence l1:k = (l1, . . . , lk). These direction and location sequences are chosen so that the target is confined to roads and intersections in a roadmap.\nAt a higher level of abstraction (lower degree of spatial resolution and slower time scale), a moving target confined to a roadmap can be characterized by an ordered sequence of intersection names it traverses. For example, v0v2v7 in Fig. 1 indicates a target which starts at intersection v0, traverses through v2 and ends at v7. For convenience, we call an ordered sequence of intersection names as a pattern. In this paper, we consider a “syntactic” enhancement to the basic VSIMM setup. This syntactic enhancement operates at a higher (meta) level and models the pattern of a target. Our aim is to estimate the target’s pattern r∗ such that\nr∗ = argmax ∀r∈M pθ(r|z1:k)\nS. Gao is with the Department of ECE, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Vikram Krishnamurthy is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, N.Y., USA. vikramk@cornell.edu and is the corresponding author.\nHere, z1:k = (z1, z2, . . . , zk) is the noisy observation sequence recorded by a GMTI radar. r is a pattern, M denotes a set of patterns that a radar operator is interested in and θ denotes the roadmap statistic obtained from traffic data. Once the pattern r∗ is estimated, it can be used as additional information to estimate the state vector xk of the target by computing the posterior p(xk|z1:k, r∗).\nThe syntactic tracker we propose in this paper consists of two parts: a meta-level tracker and a base-level tracker. The meta-level tracker uses tracklets generated by the base-level tracker to model higher level patterns. The architecture of a syntactic tracker is illustrated in Fig. 2. Our key idea is to model the pattern of a target moving on a roadmap using a constrained stochastic context free grammar (CSCFG) on a weighted, directed graph. We then propose a novel particle filtering algorithm that combines the functionalities of CSCFG and VSIMM. Detailed numerical simulations show that the resulting tracker yields substantially improved estimates compared to a baseline tracker."

Directions of motion are constrained by the road conditions. θ(lk) is the set of possible directions of motion if a target is at lk . Black arrows denote the directions of motion. In (a), if lk is a road, θ(lk) equals the angle of the road lk (with respect to a reference coordinate). In (b), if lk is an intersection, θ(lk) is the set of angles of the roads that intersect at lk .\n(ii) the direction based syntactic tracker proposed in earlier works [3] [4] [5].\nThe direction based syntactic tracker in previous works [3] [4] [5] was used to classify shapes (lines, arcs or m-rectangles) of trajectories. In such a tracker, the direction sequence d1:k is modeled via a stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) at the meta-level. The architecture of the direction based syntactic tracker is illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The key new idea in this paper is to combine a Markov chain with a SCFG which results in a constrained SCFG (CSCFG). A CSCFG constitutes a model for the target’s directions and locations. This is modeled by the mode\nqk = {dk, lk} with dk ∈ θ(lk) (1)\nwhere dk and lk denote the direction and location of the target. In (1), θ(lk) is the set of possible directions of motion if a target is at lk (See Fig. 3). The direction sequence d1:k is modeled by a SCFG with state space dependent on the location sequence l1:k which is a Markov chain. Hence, the mode sequence q1:k = (q1, q2, . . . , qk) is a combination of a SCFG and a Markov chain which is equivalent to a CSCFG; see [6]. The architecture of the mode based syntactic tracker is illustrated in Fig. 4(b). To give further insight, we also present the classical VSIMM tracker [1] [2] which is widely used for baseline target tracking. In VSIMM, the mode sequence q1:k is modeled as a Markov chain dependent on the whole roadmap instead of patterns in a mode based syntactic tracker and there is no feedback from the base-level tracker to the upper\nmodel. The architecture of the VSIMM tracker is illustrated in Fig. 4(c)."

      "text" : "To put this paper into context, we first recall the Chomsky hierarchy of natural languages [7]. Let ⊂ denote a strict subset and ≡ denote equivalent. Then • In the deterministic case:\nRegular Grammar ⊂ Context Free Grammar\n3 • In the stochastic case [6]:\nMarkov chain ⊂ Hidden Markov chain ≡ Stochastic Regular Grammar ⊂ SCFG ⊂ CSCFG\n(2)\nFrom a signal processing point of view, this paper deals with Bayesian signal processing algorithms for CSCFGs; the key application being syntactic target tracking. Put simply, at a meta-level, we view the spatial trajectory of a target as a sequence of noisy alphabets generated by a CSCFG language.1 It turns out that Bayesian estimation algorithms (Earley Stolcke parser) for CSCFGs have polynomial computational cost (in the data length). Therefore, in the context of target tracking, we are able to derive a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter which uses the Earley Stolcke parser for estimating the posterior distribution of a CSCFG.\nWhy syntactic models for target tracking? As described in [4], [5], syntactic models arising in natural language processing such as SCFG and CSCFG are suitable for meta-level tracking since they form generative models for complex spatial trajectories of a target. For example, a SCFG is a generative model for a trajectory sequence anbn for an integer valued random variable n; this trajectory models a target moving n steps in direction a followed by n steps in direction b. A Markov chain cannot exclusively generate such trajectories and is therefore not a generative model. Also there are polynomial computational cost (in the data length) Bayesian signal processing parsing algorithms for SCFGs and CSCFGs which make such models practical from an engineering point of view.\nThe main results of this paper are as follows: Sec. II and Sec. III discuss a 3-level model for the roadmap syntactic tracking problem. In Sec. IV, a novel CSCFG-driven particle filtering algorithm is given for the mode based syntactic tracker. Sec. V describes two CSCFG based models on a square grid. In Sec. VI, we compare numerical results between the mode based syntactic tracker (this paper) and the baseline VSIMM tracker. For the CSCFG based round trip model on the square grid, we compare performance between the CSCFG Viterbi tracker and the hidden Markov model (HMM) Viterbi tracker."

A parsing algorithm for the CSCFG is illustrated in Appendix A.\nTypes of Target and Traffic Models: For illustrative purposes, we consider two types of target and traffic models for syntactic tracking. Let ek denote the speed of a target at time k.\n1) Constant Traffic Flow or Constant Speed Model: Assume that the traffic flow c throughout the road network is a positive random variable. Then the time taken to traverse a road segment of length l(evivj ) with speed limit ζi is l(evi,vj )/(ζi − c). Alternatively, if the speed on a road or an intersection is an unknown constant modeled by a random variable c, then we have\nek = c (4)\nConstant speed targets can model (approximately) pedestrians and bicycles. 2) Average Speed Model: Here the speed on a road at time k equals the speed averaged over all vehicular traffic moving on that road. Therefore, the speed on a road of vehicular traffic is location based (different roads) and time varying (peak or non-peak hours). Speed at an intersection is a known constant (denoted by c2). Then we have\nek = { πE(lk, k) lk ∈ E c2 lk ∈ V\n(5)\nwhere lk is defined in (3). πE(lk, k) denotes the speed averaged over all vehicular traffic moving on lk at time k."

Given a pattern r0:n, let mriri+1 , i = 0, 1, . . . n − 1, denote the sequence of vectors comprising directions and locations of a target as it traverses from vertex (intersection) ri to ri+1.\nTo provide a concrete example, consider the setup in Fig. 7(a) where a target moves from ri to ri+1. It moves in a constant direction θ(eriri+1) and via the locations ri, eriri+1 , ri+1.

Lcsr0:n is the concatenation of mr0r1 ,mr1r2 , . . . ,mrn−1rn ; see Fig. 7(b). The key point is that since the target moves with constant speed, the time |mriri+1 |, i = 0, 1, . . . n− 1 taken to traverse from ri to ri+1 is proportional to the length of the edge connecting ri and ri+1, namely, l(eriri+1).

These examples generalize our earlier work [5] where SCFGs were used.\nIt is assumed that the target is moving confined to a square grid illustrated in Fig. 9 and is tracked by a GMTI radar.

Several examples in surveillance involve detecting palindrome trajectories of targets.4 An example of Lpalindrome is shown in Fig. 9. It is well known that a SCFG is a generative model for a palindrome.\nHere we consider a generalization called the cost constrained palindrome which has serial dependencies and therefore requires a CSCFG model. The serial dependencies are introduced by considering the process ∆k which denotes the cost (threat level or fuel consumption) incurred at each time k. ∆k is modeled by a Markov chain with state space dependent on xk−1 and xk. Then ∑k i=1 ∆i denotes the cost (fuel or funds) incurred up to time k. We assume that the target can only continue moving if the total cost (threat) accrued lies within the bound: ∑k i=1 ∆i ≤ C for some pre-specified constant C. The cost constrained palindrome model, denoted by Lpalindrome is formally specified as follows:\nDefinition 2.

Details of Lpalindrome constructed as a CSCFG are given in Appendix B.\nFinally, computing the MAP sequence estimate in (19) for a round trip or a cost constrained palindrome trajectory uses a CSCFG Viterbi tracker which is illustrated in Fig. 10.

(iii) Retracing the path also occurs when searching for a dropped or lost item.\nperformance of the mode based syntactic tracker (denoted by M in the figures below) is evaluated by simulating measurements from a GMTI radar against a target moving on the road network described by Fig. 1. See Table I for the primary properties of the radar measurements; further detail is provided in Appendix D. Note we are assuming no missing measurements (i.e. the probability of detection is unity). The aircraft where a GMTI radar is mounted starts from (-30 km,-30 km) with (constant) altitude 3000m and moves with constant velocity (100 m/s in the x direction and 20 m/s in the y direction). We also evaluate the performance of the baseline VSIMM tracker (proposed in [1] [2]) for comparison. The performance are evaluated by the simulated sample path state root mean square error averaged over 50 independent trials. Root mean square error at time k is computed as\nRMSE(k) = √√√√ 1 N N∑ n=1 (x̂nk − xtk)′(x̂nk − xtk)\nHere, x̂nk is the estimated target state vector at time k in the nth trial and xtk is the target’s true state vector at time k."

An example of RMSEs for the two trackers is illustrated in Fig. 11(a). We see that the mode based syntactic tracker performs better than the VSIMM tracker in terms of the positive “improvement” which is more than 5% under 3 specific patterns: v3v0v2, v9v0v3v8, v9v0v1v4.

      "heading" : "B. Example 2. Average Speed Model",
      "text" : "Next, consider the average speed model of Sec. III-C which is suitable for vehicular traffic. For vehicular traffic, the simulations assume that the speed on roads is location-based and time-varying and is a known constant at intersections (5 m/s); see Table VI in Appendix D for details. Performance of the mode based syntactic tracker and the baseline VSIMM tracker when tracking vehicular traffic are shown in Table III. An example of RMSEs for the two trackers is illustrated in Fig. 11(b). For specific patterns such as v3v0v2 and v9v0v3v8, the mode based syntactic tracker performs much better than\n11\nthe VSIMM tracker by over 8%. However, there is little difference between the two competing models for the remaining 4 patterns in Table III. Generally speaking, the mode based syntactic tracker for vehicular traffic does not show as drastic an improvement as for constant speed targets. The explanation is that the VSIMM tracker is able to infer which road the target is moving on after passing an intersection by distinct average speed which is location based (5). An example is shown in Fig. 12 where a target moves from r0 to r2. Due to uncertainties on which road the target moves on (r1 or r2) after the intersection, the VSIMM tracker propagates particles on both r1 and r2. However, particles on r1 are assigned (real time average) speed of 10 m/s which is much larger than the (real time average) speed on r2 (5 m/s) where the target is truly moving on. This may result in obvious differences on the range rate component in the observation vector in (8). Hence, particles on r1 have much lower weights compared with those on r2. In this way, (real time average) speeds for different roads give “hints” to the VSIMM tracker on which road the target is moving on after passing an intersection and thus VSIMM tracker can improve the tracking accuracy. In addition, notice that RMSEs for both trackers (when tracking vehicular traffic) decrease faster than those for constant speed targets. The reason is that vehicular traffic have higher speeds. An example is shown in Fig. 13. At time k, particles (red arrows) moving on r1 and r2 have similar weights. However, particles (green arrow on r1) moving on r1 immediately become “far away” from target’s true state vector (right black arrow) after time ∆ and therefore are assigned lower weights. Smaller ∆ due to higher speeds of vehicular traffic results in sharp decrease in the RMSEs as shown in Fig. 11(b)."

Fig. 15 shows an example of state estimates by the CSCFG Viterbi tracker and the HMM Viterbi tracker.

      "text" : "In this paper, we constructed a 3-level model for the syntactic tracking problem of targets whose movement is confined to a roadmap by using natural language models. At the first level, the roadmap was modeled as a weighted, directed graph; at the second level, the mode sequence was modeled via a CSCFG; finally the base level kinematics of the target were modeled by a VSIMM. A novel CSCFG-driven particle filtering algorithm was devised to track a target’s kinematics given GMTI measurements. Numerical studies show that compared with the classic VSIMM tracker, the mode based syntactic tracker proposed in this paper can substantially improve the tracking accuracy. We also discussed two CSCFG based models for targets moving on the square grid. A Viterbi algorithm was illustrated to compute the most likely hidden state sequence of the target given noisy GMTI radar measurements. Numerical results based on the round trip model show the CSCFG Viterbi tracker can substantially decrease the tracking error compared with a classical Viterbi tracker.\nAcknowledgement.: We gratefully acknowledge Dr. Martie Goulding of MacDonald Dettwiler Associates (MDA) for several useful technical discussions and careful comments on the paper.

The parsing algorithm is a modified version of the classic Earley Stolcke parser. This parsing algorithm computes the one step prediction probability and the prefix probability. To the best of our knowledge, this algorithm is new.\nThe classic Earley Stolcke parser is used to reconstruct parse trees that generate the input string based on a stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) [8]. It generates a sequence of Earley states by scanning, completion and prediction operations. An Earley state can be written as\nk k′X → λ.βµ[α, γ] (23)\nwhere X ∈ N , λ, β, µ ∈ (N ∪ T )∗. k is the current epoch and k′ is the back pointer to the epoch when this Earley state is generated by the prediction operation. The dot ’.’ marks that the portion on its left handed side has been parsed or recognized by the parser. α and γ are called the forward probability and the inner probability, respectively [8]. We expand the Earley state such that it can record the associated terminals\nk k′X → λ.βµ[s, f ][α, γ] (24)\nwhere k, k′, X , λ, β, µ, α, γ are defined in (23). s is called the start symbol and denotes the previous terminal when X is rewritten by λβµ in epoch k′. f is called the finish symbol and denotes the final terminal that has been parsed before the dot.\nThe probabilistic left corner relation is computed as\np(X L→ Y |a) = ∑ X→Y λ|a∈R p(X → Y λ|a)\nand the probabilistic unit relation is computed as\np(X U→ Y |a) = p(X → Y |a)\nwhere X , Y ∈ N , a ∈ T , λ ∈ {N ∪ T }∗.

In this paper, we generalize earlier work by considering a constrained stochastic context free grammar (CSCFG) for modeling patterns confined to a roadmap. The constrained grammar facilitates modeling specific directions and road names in a roadmap. We present a novel particle filtering algorithm that exploits the CSCFG model for estimating the target’s patterns. This meta-level algorithm operates in conjunction with a base-level tracking algorithm. Extensive numerical results using simulated ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar measurements show substantial improvement in target tracking accuracy.",
