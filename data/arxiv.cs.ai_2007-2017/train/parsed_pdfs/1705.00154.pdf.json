We propose LatPlan, an integrated architecture combining deep learning and a classical planner. Given a set of unlabeled training image pairs showing allowed actions in the problem domain, and a pair of images representing the start and goal states, LatPlan uses a Variational Autoencoder to generate a discrete latent vector from the images, based on which a PDDL model can be constructed and then solved by an off-the-shelf planner.

      "text" : "Recent advances in domain-independent planning have greatly enhanced their capabilities. However, planning problems need to be provided to the planner in a structured, symbolic representation such as PDDL [McDermott, 2000], and in general, such symbolic models need to be provided by a human, either directly in a modeling language such as PDDL, or via a compiler which transforms some other symbolic problem representation into PDDL. This results in the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck, where the modeling step is sometimes the bottleneck in the problem solving cycle. In addition, the requirement for symbolic input poses a significant obstacle to applying planning in new, unforeseen situations where no human is available to create such a model or a generator, e.g., autonomous spacecraft exploration. In particular this first requires generating symbols from raw sensor input, i.e., the symbol grounding problem [Steels, 2008].\nRecently, significant advances have been made in neural network (NN) deep learning approaches for perceptually-based cognitive tasks including image classification [Deng et al., 2009], object recognition [Ren et al., 2015], speech recognition [Deng et al., 2013], machine translation as well as NN-based problem-solving systems for problem solving [Mnih et al., 2015; Graves et al., 2016]. However, the current state-of-the-art in pure NN-based systems do not yet provide guarantees provided by symbolic planning systems, such as deterministic completeness and solution optimality.\nUsing a NN-based perceptual system to automatically provide input models for domain-independent planners could greatly expand the applicability of planning technology and offer the benefits of both paradigms. We consider the problem of robustly, automatically bridging the gap between such subsymbolic representations and the symbolic representations required by domain-independent planners.\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n00 15\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 9\nA pr\n2 01\n7\nFig. 1 (left) shows a scrambled, 3x3 tiled version of the the photograph on the right, i.e., an image-based instance of the 8-puzzle. Even for humans, this photograph-based task is arguably more difficult to solve than the standard 8-puzzle because of the distracting visual aspects. We seek a domain-independent system which, given only a set of unlabeled images showing the valid moves for this image-based puzzle, finds an optimal solution to the puzzle. Although the 8-puzzle is trivial for symbolic planners, solving this image-based problem with a domain-independent system which (1) has no prior assumptions/knowledge (e.g., “sliding objects”, “tile arrangement”), and (2) must acquire all knowledge from the images, is nontrivial. Such a system should not make assumptions about the image (e.g., “a grid-like structure”). The only assumption allowed about the nature of the task is that it can be modeled and solved as a classical planning problem.\nWe propose Latent-space Planner (LatPlan), an integrated architecture which uses NN-based image processing to completely automatically generate a propositional, symbolic problem representation which can be used as the input for a classical planner. LatPlan consists of 3 components: (1) a NN-based State Autoencoder (SAE), which provides a bidirectional mapping between the raw input of the world states and its symbolic/categorical representation, (2) an action model generator which generates a PDDL model of the problem domain using the symbolic representation acquired by the SAE, and (3) a symbolic planner. Given only a set of unlabeled images from the domain as input, we train (unsupervised) the SAE and use it to generate D, a PDDL representation of the image-based domain. Then, given a planning problem instance as a pair of initial and goal images such as Fig. 1, LatPlan uses the SAE to map the problem to a symbolic planning instance in D, and uses the planner to solve the problem. We evaluate LatPlan using image-based versions of the 8-puzzle, LightsOut, and Towers of Hanoi domains.\n0-introduction.tex"

      "text" : "Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFN) are nonlinear function approximators consisting of layers of nodes with real-valued activations, and the nodes are connected to multiple nodes in the next\nlayer by weighted edges. The output of each node is the weighted sum of the activations of the input nodes, transformed by a nonlinear activation function. Recent advances in deep learning have greatly increased the utility of FFNs as a powerful knowledge representation mechanism [Goodfellow et al., 2016].\nAlthough the traditional implementation of neural networks have multiple problems that make the deeply layered networks impractical, they are largely alleviated by the modern techniques: Convolutional Network is capable of learning translation-invariant representation in image-based tasks compared to the fully-connected networks; The learning speed was greatly improved by Stochastic Gradient Descent combined with batch processing and GPU acceleration; The problem of vanishing gradient in deep networks was alleviated by Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU); Dropout [Srivastava et al., 2014] and Regularization reduces the overfitting caused by the excessive representational power of the network; Finally, Batch Normalization [Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015] and recent optimization algorithms such as Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2014] further improves the learning speed.\nAn AutoEncoder (AE) is a type of Feed-Forward Network (FFN) that uses unsupervised learning to produce an image that matches the input [Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006]. The intermediate layer is said to have a Latent Representation of the input and is considered to be performing data compression. AEs are commonly used for pretraining a neural network. The performance of an AE is measured by the reconstruction loss, the distance between the input and the output vectors under a distance function such as l1 norm, l2 norm (euclidean distance) or binary crossentropy.\nA Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) [Kingma and Welling, 2013] is a type of AE that forces the latent layer (the most compressed layer in the AE) to follow a certain distribution (e.g., Gaussian) for given input images. While initially proposed for enforcing Gaussian distributions, VAEs have been used to enforce arbitrary types of distribution (notably by Generative Adversarial Network [Goodfellow et al., 2014; Makhzani et al., 2015]). Since the target random distribution prevents backpropagating the gradient, most VAE implementations use reparametrization tricks, which decompose the target distribution into a differentiable distribution and a purely random distribution that does not require the gradient. For example, the Gaussian distribution N(σ, µ) can be decomposed into µ+ σN(1, 0). In addition to the reconstruction loss, VAE is also tasked to minimize the variational loss, i.e. the difference between the learned distribution and the target distribution.\nGumbel-Softmax (GS) reparametrization is a recently proposed reparametrization technique for a discrete, categorical distribution [Jang et al., 2017]. It has a “temperature” parameter τ , which controls the magnitude of approximation to the categorical distribution, which is decreased by an annealing schedule τ ← max(0.1, exp(−rt)) where t is the current training epoch and r is an annealing ratio. We chose r so that τ = 0.1 when the training finishes. The above schedule follows the original by Jang et al. (2017). Using a GS layer in the network forces the layer to converge to a discrete one-hot vector when the temperature approaches near 0."

      "heading" : "2.2 Classical Planning",
      "text" : "Classical Planning is achieving a significant advance in the recent years due to the success of heuristic search. The input to a Classical Planning solver (a planner) is a 5-tuple Π = 〈P,O, I,G,A〉 where P defines a set of first-order predicates, O is a set of symbols called objects, I is the initial state, G is a set of goal conditions, and A is a set of actions which defines the state transitions in the search space. A state is an assignment of boolean values to the set of propositional variables, while a condition is a partial assignment that assigns values only to a subset of propositions. Each propo-\nsition is described with first-order logic (head parameters...) where the parameters consist of the symbols in O, and the number of parameters matches those of the predicate p ∈ P with the same name. Lifted action schema a ∈ A is a 5-tuple 〈params, pre, e+, e−, c〉 where each element means the set of parameters, preconditions, add-effects, delete-effects and the cost, respectively. Parameter substitution using objects in O instantiates ground actions.\nThe task of a planning problem is to find a path from the initial state I to some goal state s∗ ⊇ G, using the state transition rules in A. A state s can be transformed into a new state t by applying a ground action a when s ⊇ pre, and then t = (s \\ e−)∪ e+ [Bacchus, 2000]. This transition can also be viewed as applying a state transition function a to s, which can be written as t = a(s).\nState-of-the-Art planners solve this problem as a path finding problem on a implicit graph defined by the state transition rules. They usually employ forward state space heuristic search, such as A∗ (for finding the shortest path) or Greedy Best-First Search (for finding a suboptimal path more quickly). Thanks to the variety of successful domain-independent heuristic functions [Helmert and Domshlak, 2009; Sievers et al., 2012; Helmert et al., 2007; Bonet, 2013; Hoffmann and Nebel, 2001; Helmert, 2004; Richter et al., 2008], current state-of-the-art planners can scale to larger problems which requires plans consisting of more than 1000 steps [Asai and Fukunaga, 2015].\n0-background.tex"

These are converted to symbolic form using the SAE, and the problem is solved by the symbolic planner. For example, an 8-puzzle problem instance in our system consists of an image of the start (scrambled) configuration of the puzzle (i), and an image of the solved state (g). Finally, the symbolic, latent-space plan is converted to a sequence of human-comprehensible images visualizing the plan (Sec. 3.4)."

      "text" : "The State Autoencoder (SAE) provides a bidirectional mapping between images and a symbolic representation.\nFirst, note that a direct 1-to-1 mapping between images and discrete objects can be trivially obtained simply by using the array of discretized pixel values as a “symbol”. The model generation method of of Sec. 3.2 could be applied to such “symbols”. However, such a trivial SAE lacks the crucial properties of generalization – ability to encode/decode unforeseen world states to symbols – and robustness – two similar images that represent “the same world state” should map to the same symbolic representation. Thus, we need a mapping where the symbolic representation captures the “essence” of the image, not merely the raw pixel vector. The main technical contribution of this paper is the proposal of a SAE which is implemented as a Variational Autoencoder [Kingma et al., 2014] with a Gumbel-Softmax (GS) activation function [Jang et al., 2017].\nThe SAE is comprised of multilayer perceptrons combined with Dropouts and Batch Normalization in both the encoder and the decoder networks, with a GS layer in between. The input to the GS layer is the flat, last layer of the encoder network. The output is an (N,M) matrix where N is the number of categorical variables and M is the number of categories. The input is fed to a fully connected layer of size N ×M , which is reshaped to a (N,M) matrix and processed by the GS activation function.\nOur key observation is that these categorical variables can be used directly as propositional symbols by a symbolic reasoning system, i.e., this provides a solution to the symbol grounding problem in our architecture. We obtain the propositional representation by specifyingM = 2, effectively obtaining N propositional state variables. It is possible to specify different M for each variable and represent the world using multi-valued representation as in SAS+ [Bäckström and Nebel, 1995]. In this paper, we use M = 2 for all variables for simplicity, and also for leveraging GPU parallelism by running the computation as a matrix operation. This does not affect the expressive power in the model induced by the SAE because bitstrings of sufficient length can represent arbitrary integers in multi-valued encoding.\nThe trained SAE provides bidirectional mapping between the raw inputs (subsymbolic representation) to and from their symbolic representations:\n• b = Encode(r) maps an image r to a boolean vector b.\n• r̃ = Decode(b) maps a boolean vector b to an image r̃.\nEncode(r) maps raw input r to a symbolic representation by feeding the raw input to the encoder network, extract the activation in the GS layer, and take the first row in the N × 2 matrix, resulting in a binary vector of length N . Similarly, Decode(b) maps a binary vector b back to an image by concatenating b and its complement b̄ to obtain aN×2 matrix and feeding it to the decoder network.\nThese are lossy compression/decompression functions, so in general, r̃ = Decode(Encode(r)) is similar to r, but may have negligible errors from r. This is acceptable for our purposes.\nIt is not sufficient to simply use traditional activation functions such as sigmoid or softmax and round the continuous activation values in the latent layer to obtain discrete 0/1 values. As explained in Sec. 3.4, we need to map the symbolic plan back to images, so we need a decoding network trained for 0/1 values approximated by a smooth function, e.g., GS or similar approach such as [Maddison et al., 2017]. A rounding-based scheme would be unable to restore the images from the latent layer because the decoder network is trained using continuous activation values. Also, representing the rounding operation as a layer of the network is infeasible because rounding is non-differentiable, precluding backpropagation-based training of the network.\nIn some domains, an SAE trained on a small fraction of the possible states successfully generalizes so that it can Encode and Decode every possible state in that domain. In all our experiments below, on each domain, we train the SAE using randomly selected images from the domain. For example, on the 8-puzzle, the SAE trained on 12000 randomly generated configurations out of 362880 possible configurations is used by the domain model generator (Sec. 3.2) to Encode every 8-puzzle state."

      "text" : "The model generator takes as input a trained SAE, and a set R contains pairs of raw images. In each image pair (prei, posti) ∈ R, prei and posti are images representing the state of the world before\nand after some action ai is executed, respectively. In each ground action image pair, the “action” is implied by the difference between prei and posti. The output of the model generator is a PDDL domain file for a grounded unit-cost STRIPS planning problem.\nFor each (prei, posti) ∈ Rwe apply the learned SAE to prei and posti to obtain (Encode(prei), Encode(posti)), the symbolic representations (latent space vectors) of the state before and after action ai is executed. This results in a set of symbolic ground action instances A.\nIdeally, a model generation component would induce a complete action model from a limited set of symbolic ground action instances. However, action model learning from a limited set of action instances is a nontrivial area of active research [Cresswell et al., 2013; Gregory and Cresswell, 2015; Konidaris et al., 2014; Mourão et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2007; Celorrio et al., 2012]. Since the focus of this paper is on the overall LatPlan architecture and the SAE, we leave model induction for future work.\nInstead, the current implementation LatPlanα uses a trivial, baseline strategy which generates a model based on all ground actions, i.e., R contains image pairs representing all ground actions that are possible in this domain, so A (generated by applying the SAE to all elements of R) contains all symbolic ground actions possible in the domain (as argued in Sec. 3.1, a robot could traverse the whole state space by random-walk with resets and eventually collect R). In the experiments Sec. 4, we generate image pairs for all ground actions using an external image generator. It is important to note that while R contains all possible actions, R is not used for training the SAE. As explained in Sec. 3.1, the SAE is trained using at most 12000 images while the entire state space is much larger.\nLatPlanα compiles A directly into a PDDL model as follows. For each action (Encode(prei), Encode(posti)) ∈ A, each bit bj(1 ≤ j ≤ N) in these boolean vectors is mapped to propositions (bj-true) and (bj-false)when the encoded value is 1 and 0 (resp.).Encode(prei) is directly used as the preconditions of action ai. The add/delete effects of action i are computed by taking the bitwise difference between Encode(prei) and Encode(posti). For example, when bj changes from 1 to 0, it compiles into (and (bj-false) (not (bj-true))).\nThe initial and the goal states are similarly created by applying the SAE to the initial and goal images."

However, on the models generated by LatPlanα, the invariant detection routines in the Fast Downward PDDL to SAS translator (translate.py) became a bottleneck, so we wrote a trivial, replacement PDDL to SAS converter without the invariant detection.\nLatPlan inherits all of the search-related properties of the planner which is used. For example, if the planner is complete and optimal, LatPlan will find an optimal plan for the given plan (if one exists), with respect to the portion of the state-space graph captured by the acquired model. Domainindependent heuristics developed in the planning literature are designed to exploit structure in the domain model. Although the structure in models acquired by LatPlan may not directly correspond to those in hand-coded models, intuitively, there should be some exploitable structure. The search results in Sec. 4.3 suggest that the domain-independent heuristics can reduce the search effort."

Each digit is shrunk to 14x14 pixels, so each state of the puzzle is a 42x42 image. Valid moves in this domain swap the “0” tile with a neighboring tile, i.e., the “0” serves as the “blank” tile in the classic 8-puzzle. The entire state space consists of 362880 states (9!). From any specific goal state, the reachable number of states is 181440 (9!/2). Note that the same image is used for each digit in all states, e.g., the tile for the “1” digit is the same image in all states.\nOut of 362880 images, 12000 randomly selected images are used for training the SAE. This set is further divided into a training set and a validation set, each consisting of 11000 and 1000 images, where the actual backpropagation-based training of the network is performed on the training set, and the validation set is not given to the learner. Validation set represents the unseen instances: It is later used for ensuring the network is not overfitting, by computing the reconstruction loss |r − r̃| of the validation set and ensure that it is comparable to the reconstruction loss of the training set. Training takes about 40 minutes with 1000 epochs on a single NVIDIA GTX-1070.\nScrambled Photograph 8-puzzle The above MNIST 8-puzzle described above consists of images where each digit is cleanly separated from the black region. To show that LatPlan does not rely on cleanly separated objects, we solve 8-puzzles generated by cutting and scrambling real photographs (similar to sliding tile puzzle toys sold in stores). We used the “Mandrill” image, a standard benchmark in the image processing literature. The image was first converted to greyscale and then rounded to black/white (0/1) values. The same number of images as in the MNIST-8puzzle experiments are used.\nTowers of Hanoi (ToH) Disks of various sizes must be moved from one peg to another, with the constraint that a larger disk can never be placed on top of a smaller disk. We generated the training and planning inputs for this task, with 3 and 4 disks. Each input image has a dimension of 24× 122 and 32× 146 (resp.), where each disk is presented as a 8px line segment.\nDue to the smaller number of states (3d states for d disks), we used images of all states as the set of images for training SAE. This is further divided into the training set (90%) and the validation set (10%), and we verified that the network has learned a generalized model without overfitting.\n3-disk ToH is solved successfully and optimally using the default hyperparameters (Fig. 6, top). However, as the images become more complex, training the SAE becomes more difficult. On 4- disks, the SAE trained with the default hyperparameters (Fig. 6, middle) is confused, resulting in a flawed model which causes the planner to choose suboptimal moves (dashed box). Sometimes, the size/existence of disks is confused (red box). Tuning the hyperparameters to reduce the SAE loss corrects this problem. Increasing the training epochs (10000) and tuning the network shape (fc(6000), N = 29) allows the SAE to learn a clearer model, allowing correct model generation, resulting in the optimal 15-step plan (Fig. 6, bottom).\nLightsOut A video game where a grid of lights is in some on/off configuration (+: On), and pressing a light toggles its state (On/Off) as well as the state of all of its neighbors. The goal is all lights Off. Unlike the 8-puzzle where each move affects only two adjacent tiles, a single operator in 4x4 LightsOut can simultaneously flip 5/16 locations. Also, unlike 8-puzzle and ToH, the LightsOut game allows some “objects” (lights) to disappear. This demonstrates that LatPlan is not limited to domains with highly local effects and static objects.\n4x4 LightsOut has 216 = 65536 states and 16 × 216 = 1048576 transitions. Similar to the 8-puzzle instances, we used 12000 randomly selected images out of 65536 images, which is then divided into 11000 training images and 1000 validation images.\nTwisted LightsOut In all of the above domains, the “objects” correspond to rectangles. To show that LatPlan does not rely on rectangular regions, we demonstrate its result on “Twisted Light-\nsOut”, a distorted version of the game where the original LightsOut image is twisted around the center. Unlike previous domains, the input images are not binarized."

Search times (< 3 seconds for all instances) were also faster for all instances with the PDB. Although total runtimes including heuristic initialization is slightly slower than blind search, in domains where goal states and operators are the same for all instances (e.g., 8-puzzle) PDBs can be reused [Korf and Felner, 2002], and PDB generation time can be amortized across many instances.\nWhile the symbolic representation acquired by LatPlan captures the state space graph of the domain, the propositions in the latent space do not necessarily correspond to conceptual propositions in a natural, hand-coded PDDL model. Although these results show that existing heuristics for classical planning are able to reduce search effort compared to blind search, much more work is required in order to understand how the features in latent space interact with existing heuristics. In addition, a deeper understanding of the symbolic latent space may lead to new search heuristics which better exploit the properties of latent space.\n0-evaluation.tex"

The inputs to their system are 33 variables representing structured sensor input (e.g., x/y distances between each effector and each object, light level) as well as categorical states (the on/off state of a button, whether the monkey has cried out). In contrast, the inputs to LatPlan are unstructured images (e.g., for the 8-puzzle, 42x42=1764-dimensional arrays). Konidaris et al. do not explicitly deal with robustness wrto noisy sensor input, and they focus on action model learning. In contrast, we focus mostly on generating propositions from noisy, unlabeled raw images via our neural-net based SAE, and LatPlanα doesn’t perform action model learning (Sec. 3.2). Integrating action modeling [Konidaris et al., 2014; Mourão et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2007] is a direction for future work.\nOur approach differs from the work on learning from observation (LfO) in the robotics literature [Argall et al., 2009] in that: (1) LatPlan is trained based on image pairs showing valid before/after images of valid individual actions, while LfO work is largely based on observation (e.g., of videos) of plan executions; (2) LatPlan generates PDDL for symbolic planners which are suited for high-level (puzzle-like) tasks, while LfO focuses on tasks such as motion planning/manipulation. A closely related line of work in LfO is learning of board game play from observation of video/images\n[Barbu et al., 2010; Kaiser, 2012; Kirk and Laird, 2016]. These works make relatively strong assumptions about the environment, e.g., that there is a grid-like environment with “piece”-like objects. In contrast, as shown in Sec. 4, LatPlan does not make assumptions about the contents of the images.\nThere is a large body of previous work using neural networks to directly solve combinatorial search/planning tasks, starting with the well-known use of neural network to solve the TSP [Hopfield and Tank, 1985]. With respect to state-space search problems similar to those we consider, Neurosolver, a neural network where each node corresponds to a state in the search space [Bieszczad and Pagurek, 1998], has been used to solves Tower of Hanoi [Bieszczad and Kuchar, 2015]. Although such solvers use neural networks to solve the search problem, they assume a fully symbolic representation of the problem as input.\nPrevious work combining symbolic search algorithms and neural-networks (NNs) embedded NNs inside a search algorithm to provide search control knowledge. AlphaGo uses a NN (learned from traces of expert Go players as well as self-play) as a heuristic evaluation function to guide search in a Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm [Silver et al., 2016]. In combinatorial search, FFNs have been used as heuristic functions for the sliding-tile puzzle and Rubik’s Cube [Arfaee et al., 2011]. In domain-independent planning, FFNs have been used to learn domain-specific (inadmissible) heuristics for a search-based planner [Satzger and Kramer, 2013]. In contrast, we use a NNbased SAE for symbol grounding, not for search control.\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has solved complex problems where the input is provided as images, performing well on many video games [Mnih et al., 2015]. For unit-action-cost planning, LatPlan doesn’t require a reinforcement signal (reward function). Also, LatPlan does not require expert solution traces, but only a random sample of the valid moves. Access to expert traces (as in the game of Go [Silver et al., 2016]) is a significant limitation of RL approach because such data may not be readily available. Finally, since LatPlanα uses a classical planner, on deterministic, fully-observable single-agent domains, it can provide guarantees of completeness and solution cost optimality (optimal wrto the acquired domain model). An interesting avenue for future work is extending our SAE-based approach as a symbol grounding mechanism for a symbolic, probabilistic (MDP) planner.\nAn AutoEncoder is a nonlinear generalization of PCA [Bourlard and Kamp, 1988]. Therefore, our approach is somewhat similar to an approach that uses PCA to run RL in the continuous latent space of the configuration space of a high-DOF robot [Luck et al., 2014].\n0-related.tex"

      "text" : "We proposed LatPlan, an integrated architecture for domain model acquisition and planning which, given only a set of unlabeled images and no prior knowledge, generates a classical planning problem model, solves it with a symbolic planner, and presents the resulting plan as a human-comprehensible sequence of images. We demonstrated its feasibility using image-based versions of planning/statespace-search problems (8-puzzle, Towers of Hanoi, Lights Out). The key technical contribution is the SAE, which leverages the Gumbel-Softmax reparametrization technique [Jang et al., 2017] and learns (unsupervised) a bidirectional mapping between raw images and a propositional representation usable by symbolic planners. For example, as shown in Sec. 4, on the MNIST 8-puzzle, the\n“gist” of 42x42 training images are compressed into 49-bit representations that capture the essence of the images which is robust to noise.\nAside from the key assumptions that (1) the domain can be modeled and solved as a classical planning problem, and (2) the domain can be correctly inferred from the given training images, we avoid assumptions about the input domain. Thus, we have shown that domains with significantly different characteristics can all be solved by the same system, without modifying any code or manually modifying the neural network architecture. In other words, LatPlan is a domain-independent, image-based classical planner.\nTo our knowledge, LatPlan is the first system which completely automatically constructs a logical representation usable by an off-the-shelf symbolic planner from a set of unlabeled images for a diverse set of problems, with no explicit assumptions or knowledge about the nature of the domains other than the assumption that the domain can be solved by classical planning and that a sufficient set of training images is available. However, as a proof-of-concept first implementation, it has significant limitations to be addressed in future work."

      "heading" : "6.1 Automated Validation of Plans",
      "text" : "Since this paper focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of a symbolic planning system with neural perception, the experimental results included in the paper is mostly qualitative. To facilitate a more quantitative evaluation of LatPlan, one important direction for future work includes the development of a practical methods for validating plans. LatPlan should return a valid visual plan, i.e., a plan which does not violate the rules in the original input. In Sec. 4, we observed that the result plan may be invalid depending on the performance of the SAE. In classical planning, the validation of the solution plan is trivial as the plan simulator and the explicit action description is readily available. However, validating the plan returned by LatPlan requires manual validation by human eye which checks every moves presented in the result, which does not scale to a large number of problem instances/plans, and is also prone to errors. This prevents a convenient and reliable evaluation of LatPlan. One approach to this problem is to use crowd sourcing infrastructure like Amazon Mechanical Turk, in combination with techniques for reducing the variance of the evaluation [Yuen et al., 2011]. However, development of automated methods for plan validation is more preferable. Approaches such as the inception score for evaluating the performance of Generative Adversarial Network [Salimans et al., 2016] suggests that such automated approaches may be feasible for LatPlan as well."

      "heading" : "6.2 Action Learning",
      "text" : "The SAE successfully solves the problem of mapping a pair of images into a ground symbolic action using only a subset of the world state images (Sec. 3.2). On the other hand, the domain model generator in the current LatPlanα implementation does not perform action model learning/induction from a small set of sample actions.\nSince the focus of this paper is the evaluation of SAE and not action learning, the current, baseline domain model generator requires the entire set of latent states/transitions, which in turn requires an image for each state in the state space. LatPlanα essentially constructs an explicit state space graph based on action image pairs for all ground actions in the domain, so the planner is being used to find optimal paths in an explicit graph. In other words, the preconditions of the actions generated by LatPlanα specify every bit in a state, unlike the partial specification of a state that is\ncommon in IPC benchmark domains which allows the implicit definition of very large state spaces. This kind of trivial domain model generator which uses images for all states in the entire state space is obviously impractical in many domains. Aside from the modeling issue, the trivial explicit statespace model causes practical issues with current off-the-shelf planners, as the huge total number of actions (edges in the explicit state space model) causes major slowdowns in both the PDDL parser (Sec. 3.3), as well as the initialization runtime of heuristics (Sec. 4.3).\nHowever, these are not fundamental limitations of the LatPlan architecture. The current primitive model generator in LatPlanα is merely a placeholder which was necessary to enable us to investigate the utility of the SAEs (our major contribution) and the overall feasibility of an end-toend planning system based on raw images. Thus, the focus of our work and our contributions are orthogonal and complementary to the goals of previous work on domain model learning. To our knowledge, all previous planning domain model learning methods assume/require as input representations of states which are highly structured (e.g., propositional).\nThe SAE provides a method of automatically extracting propositional representations from raw images. Thus, we believe that it should be possible to adapt and apply action model learning methods which have been developed for environments with deterministic effects and fully observable states [Celorrio et al., 2012, Sec.3,Fig.2] to the propositional representations generated using the SAE in LatPlan. Thus, replacing this primitive generator in LatPlanα with a more sophisticated generator [Cresswell et al., 2013; Konidaris et al., 2014; Mourão et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2007] is an important direction for future work.\nAnother related direction for future work is how to specify the goal condition for LatPlan. Since LatPlan assumes a single goal state as an input, developing a method for specifying a set of goal states with a partial goal specification as in IPC domains is an interesting future work. For example, one may want to tell the planner “the goal states must have at least tile 0,1,2 in the correct places, but we do not care the others” in a MNIST 8-puzzle instance."

      "heading" : "6.3 Collecting Images",
      "text" : "LatPlan is a proof-of-concept architecture which shows the feasibility of constructing an end-to-end planning which uses raw images as input. As such, we did not address the practical issue of how the images are obtained by a sytem which uses image-based planning. However, in a real-world implementation of a system like LatPlan i.e., an image-based planner for a robot with sensors/camera and manipulators, collecting the data (images) needed to train the SAE is a practical issue. The requirement for collecting data for LatPlan would be significantly different from those that are common in learning-from-observatoin systems.\nUnlike learning-from-obseration, where the learner does not know when an action starts/ends and should recognize each action from the plan traces, we assume that a robot has a lower-level manipulation capabilities of safely, randomly exploring the world by itself, deciding to initiate/terminate its own action, manipulating the state of the world and observing the consequences.2 The robot can perform a random walk, collecting images along the way. In many domains, physical constraints will ensure that the robot can only perform legal moves (e.g., the physical tile board in 8-puzzle, the touch display in a LightsOut video game). In domains such as Towers of Hanoi where illegal moves are physically possible, we can assume either that a teacher (e.g., human) prevents the robot\n2. Note that if the learner controls when actions are initiated/terminated, action segmentation (identifying which images indicate the start/end of individual actions) is not a issue.\nfrom making illegal moves, or that the teacher filters the training images taken by the robot. If we further assume that it is possible to periodically “reset” the world (e.g., a teacher comes and resets the world into a random configuration), then, given enough time, the robot could obtain images of the entire state space.\nIn domains where obtaining training images is expensive, another bottleneck in an image-based planning system like LatPlan is the number of images required to train the SAE. Developing more effective learner for minimizing the training data, such as One-shot learning methods [Lake et al., 2013], is an important direction for future work. Since a better learner needs less examples, the number of required images depends on the generalization capability of AE, which is ongoing work in the DL community."

For example, some tuning of the image (shrinking/binarization) was necessary in order to get the SAE working for the photograph-based 8-puzzles. Making a truly robust autoencoder is not a problem unique to LatPlan, but rather, a fundamental problem in deep learning. A contribution of this paper is the demonstration that it is possible to leverage some existing deep learning techniques quite effectively in an integrated learning/planning system, and future work will seek to continue leveraging further improvements in deep learning and other image processing techniques.\n0-discussion.tex main.tex"

Meanwhile, although recent work in deep learning has achieved impressive results in many fields, the knowledge is encoded in a subsymbolic representation which cannot be directly used by symbolic systems such as planners. We propose LatPlan, an integrated architecture combining deep learning and a classical planner. Given a set of unlabeled training image pairs showing allowed actions in the problem domain, and a pair of images representing the start and goal states, LatPlan uses a Variational Autoencoder to generate a discrete latent vector from the images, based on which a PDDL model can be constructed and then solved by an off-the-shelf planner. We evaluate LatPlan using image-based versions of 3 planning domains: 8-puzzle, LightsOut, and Towers of Hanoi. 0-abstract.tex",
