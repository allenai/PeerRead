      "text" : "The bandit algorithm addresses then the need for balancing exploration/exploitation (exr/exp) tradeoff in different real life problem. A bandit algorithm B exploits its past experience to select actions that appear more frequently. Besides, these seemingly optimal actions may in fact be suboptimal, because of the imprecision in B’s knowledge. In order to avoid this undesired case, B has to explore actions by choosing seemingly suboptimal actions so as to gather more information about them. Exploitation can decrease short-term user’s satisfaction since some suboptimal actions may be chosen. However, obtaining information about the actions’ average rewards (i.e., exploration) can refine B’s estimate of the actions’ rewards and in turn increases long-term user’s satisfaction. Clearly, neither a purely exploring nor a purely exploiting algorithm works well, and a good tradeoff is needed. One interesting solution to the multi-armed bandit problem is the LINUCB strategy. This is an extension of the UCB algorithm to the parametric case [9]. It selects the document for which mean standard deviation is maximum. We propose to improve this approach by adding a random exploration ε , also the ε parameter controls essentially the exp/exr tradeoff between exploitation and exploration is computed using the exponentiated gradient .\nOne drawback of this algorithm is that it is difficult to decide in advance the optimal value. Instead, we introduce an algorithm named Gradien-LINUCB that achieves this goal by balancing adaptively the exp/exr tradeoff using gradient optimization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the key notions used throughout this paper. Section 3 reviews some related works. Section 4 describes the algorithms involved in the proposed approach. The experimental evaluation is illustrated in Section 5. The last section concludes the paper and points out possible directions for future work."

      "text" : "Very frequently used in reinforcement learning to study the exr/exp tradeoff, the multi-armed bandit problem was originally described by Robbins [7]. Few research works are dedicated to study the contextual bandit problem on recommender systems, where they consider the user’s behavior as the context of the bandit problem. In [6], the authors extend the ε-greedy strategy by dynamically updating the ε exploration value. At each iteration, they run a sampling procedure to select a new ε from a finite set of candidates. The probabilities associated to the candidates are uniformly initialized and updated with the Exponentiated Gradient (EG) [5]. This updating rule increases the probability of a candidate ε if it leads to a user’s click. In [9], authors model the recommendation as a contextual bandit problem. They propose an approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects documents to serve users based on their behavior. To maximize the total number of user’s clicks, this work proposes LINUCB algorithm that is computationally efficient.\nAs shown above, both LINUCB and EG-greedy are interesting approach to solve the context bandit algorithm. Our intuition is that, combining these approaches lead to improve the result. This strategy uses the LINUCB and adds the EG for defining the optimal exploration (ε)."

      "heading" : "4 Experimental Evaluation",
      "text" : "In order to empirically evaluate the performance of our approach, We now consider an online advertising application. Given a user visiting a publisher page, the problem is to select the best advertisement for that user. A key element in this matching problem is the click-trough rate (CTR) estimation: what is the probability that a given ad will be clicked given some context (user, page visited)? Indeed, in a cost-per-click (CPC) campaign, the advertiser only pays when his ad gets clicked. is the reason why it is important to select ads with high CTRs. There is of course a fundamental exploration / exploitation dilemma here: in order to learn the CTR of an ad, it needs to be displayed, leading to a potential loss of short-term revenue. More details on the data and on display advertising cab be found in (Agarwal et al., 2010). To test the proposed Gradien-LINUCB algorithm, The testing step consists of evaluating the algorithms for each testing iteration using the average CTR. The average CTR for a particular iteration is the ratio between the total number of clicks and the total number of displays. Then, we calculate the average CTR over every 1000 iterations. The number of documents (N) returned by the recommender system for each iteration is 10 and we have run the simulation until the number of iterations reaches 10000, which is the number of iterations where all algorithms have converged.\nIn the first experiment, in addition to a pure exploitation baseline, we have compared our algorithm to the algorithms described in the related work (Section 3): EGgreedy; LINUCB. In Fig. 2, the horizontal axis is the number of iterations and the vertical axis is the performance metric.\nWe have several observations regarding the different exr/exp algorithms. For the εdecreasing algorithm, the converged average CTR increases as the ε decreases (exploitation augments).\nWhile the EG algorithm converges to a higher average CTR, its overall performance\nis not as good as LinUCB. Its average CTR is low at the early step because of more exploration, but does not converge faster. The Gradien-LINUCB algorithm effectively learns the optimal ε; it has the best convergence rate, increases the average CTR by a factor of 1,5 over the baseline and outperforms all other exr/exp algorithms. The improvement comes from a dynamic tradeoff between exr/exp, controlled by the EG estimation."
