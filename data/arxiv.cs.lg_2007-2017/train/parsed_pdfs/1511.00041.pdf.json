      "text" : "Causality is a fundamental concept in sciences and philosophy. The mathematical formulation of a theory of causality in a probabilistic sense has received significant attention recently (e.g. [2, 6, 8, 9, 14]). A formulation advocated by Pearl considers the structural equation models: In this framework, X is a cause of Y , if Y can be written as f(X,E), for some deterministic function f and some latent random variable E. Given two causally related variables X and Y , it is not possible to infer whether X causes Y or Y causes X from random samples, unless certain assumptions are made on the distribution of E and/or on f [7, 15]. For more than two random variables, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are the most common tool used for representing causal relations. For a given DAG D = (V,E), the directed edge (X,Y ) ∈ E shows that X is a cause of Y .\nIf we make no assumptions on the data generating process, the standard way of inferring the causal directions is by performing experiments, the so-called interventions. An intervention requires modifying the process that generates the random variables: The experimenter has to enforce values on the random variables. This process is different than conditioning as explained in detail in [14].\nThe natural problem to consider is therefore minimizing the number of interventions required to learn a causal DAG. Hauser et al. [6] developed an efficient algorithm that minimizes this number in the worst case. The algorithm is based on optimal coloring of chordal graphs and requires at most logχ interventions to learn any causal graph where χ is the chromatic number of the chordal skeleton.\nHowever, one important open problem appears when one also considers the size of the used interventions: Each intervention is an experiment where the scientist must force a set of variables to take random values. Unfortunately, the interventions obtained in [6] can involve up to n/2 variables. The simultaneous enforcing of many variables can\nbe quite challenging in many applications: for example in biology, some variables may not be enforceable at all or may require complicated genomic interventions for each parameter.\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of learning a causal graph when intervention sizes are bounded by some parameter k. The first work we are aware of for this problem is by Eberhardt et al. [2], where he provided an achievable scheme. Furthermore [3] shows that the set of interventions to fully identify a causal DAG must satisfy a specific set of combinatorial conditions called a separating system1, when the intervention size is not constrained or is 1. In [9], with the assumption that the same holds true for any intervention size, Hyttinen et al. draw connections between causality and known separating system constructions. One open problem is: If the learning algorithm is adaptive after each intervention, is a separating system still needed or can one do better? It was believed that adaptivity does not help in the worst case [3] and that one still needs a separating system.\nOur Contributions: We obtain several novel results for learning causal graphs with interventions bounded by size k. The problem can be separated for the special case where the underlying undirected graph (the skeleton) is the complete graph and the more general case where the underlying undirected graph is chordal. 1. For complete graph skeletons, we show that any adaptive deterministic algorithm needs a (n, k) separating system.\nThis implies that lower bounds for separating systems also hold for adaptive algorithms and resolves the previously mentioned open problem. 2. We present a novel combinatorial construction of a separating system that is close to the previous lower bound. This simple construction may be of more general interest in combinatorics. 3. Recently [8] showed that randomized adaptive algorithms need only log log n interventions with high probability for the unbounded case. We extend this result and show that O (\nn k log log k\n)\ninterventions of size bounded by k suffice with high probability. 4. We present a more general information theoretic lower bound of n2k to capture the performance of such randomized algorithms. 5. We extend the lower bound for adaptive algorithms for general chordal graphs. We show that over all orientations, the number of experiments from a (χ(G), k) separating system is needed where χ(G) is the chromatic number of the skeleton graph. 6. We show two extremal classes of graphs. For one of them, the interventions through (χ, k) separating system is sufficient. For the other class, we need α(χ−1)2k ≈ n 2k experiments in the worst case. 7. We exploit the structural properties of chordal graphs to design a new deterministic adaptive algorithm that uses the idea of separating systems together with adaptability to Meek rules. We simulate our new algorithm and empirically observe that it performs quite close to the (χ, k) separating system. Our algorithm requires much fewer interventions compared to (n, k) separating systems."

      "text" : "A causal DAG D = (V,E) is a directed acyclic graph where V = {x1, x2 . . . xn} is a set of random variables and (x, y) ∈ E is a directed edge if and only if x is a direct cause of y. We adopt Pearl’s structural equation model with independent errors (SEM-IE) in this work (see [14] for more details). Variables in S ⊆ V cause xi, if xi = f({xj}j∈S , ey) where ey is a random variable independent of all other variables.\nThe causal relations of D imply a set of conditional independence (CI) relations between the variables. A conditional independence relation is of the following form: Given Z , the set X and the set Y are conditionally independent for some disjoint subsets of variables X,Y, Z . Due to this, causal DAGs are also called causal Bayesian networks. A set V of variables is Bayesian with respect to a DAG D if the joint probability distribution of V can be factorized as a product of marginals of every variable conditioned on its parents.\nAll the CI relations that are learned statistically through observations can also be inferred from the Bayesian network using a graphical criterion called the d-separation [16] assuming that the distribution is faithful to the graph 2. Two causal DAGs are said to be Markov equivalent if they encode the same set of CIs. Two causal DAGs are Markov\n1A separating system is a 0-1 matrix with n distinct columns and each row has at most k ones. 2Given Bayesian network, any CI relation implied by d-separation holds true. All the CIs implied by the distribution can be found using dseparation if the distribution is faithful. Faithfulness is a widely accepted assumption, since it is known that only a measure zero set of distributions are not faithful [13].\nequivalent if and only if they have the same skeleton3 and the same immoralities4. The class of causal DAGs that encode the same set of CIs is called the Markov equivalence class. We denote the Markov equivalence class of a DAG D by [D]. The graph union5 of all DAGs in [D] is called the essential graph of D. It is denoted E(D). E(D) is always a chain graph with chordal6 chain components 7 [1].\nThe d-separation criterion can be used to identify the skeleton and all the immoralities of the underlying causal DAG [16]. Additional edges can be identified using the fact that the underlying DAG is acyclic and there are no more immoralities. Meek derived 3 local rules (Meek rules), introduced in [17], to be recursively applied to identify every such additional edge (see Theorem 3 of [12]). The repeated application of Meek rules on this partially directed graph with identified immoralities until they can no longer be used yields the essential graph."

      "text" : "Given a set of variables V = {x1, ..., xn}, an intervention on a set S ⊂ X of the variables is an experiment where the performer forces each variable s ∈ S to take the value of another independent (from other variables) variable u, i.e., s = u. This operation, and how it affects the joint distribution is formalized by the do operator by Pearl [14]. An intervention modifies the causal DAG D as follows: The post intervention DAG D{S} is obtained by removing the connections of nodes in S to their parents. The size of an intervention S is the number of intervened variables, i.e., |S|. Let Sc denote the complement of the set S.\nCI-based learning algorithms can be applied to D{S} to identify the set of removed edges, i.e. parents of S [16], and the remaining adjacent edges in the original skeleton are declared to be the children. Hence,\n(R0) The orientations of the edges of the cut between S and Sc in the original DAG D can be inferred. Then, 4 local Meek rules (introduced in [17]) are repeatedly applied to the original DAG D with the new directions learnt from the cut to learn more till no more directed edges can be identified. Further application of CI-based algorithms on D will reveal no more information. The Meek rules are given below: (R1) (a− b) is oriented as (a → b) if ∃c s.t. (c → a) and (c, b) /∈ E. (R2) (a− b) is oriented as (a → b) if ∃c s.t. (a → c) and (c → b). (R3) (a− b) is oriented as (a → b) if ∃c, d s.t. (a− c),(a− d),(c → b),(d → b) and (c, d) /∈ E. (R4) (a− c) is oriented as (a → c) if ∃b, d s.t. (b → c),(a− d),(a− b),(d → b) and (c, d) /∈ E. The concepts of essential graphs and Markov equivalence classes are extended in [4] to incorporate the role of interventions: Let I = {I1, I2, ..., Im}, be a set of interventions and let the above process be followed after each intervention. Interventional Markov equivalence class (I equivalence) of a DAG is the set of DAGs that represent the same set of probability distributions obtained when the above process is applied after every intervention in I. It is denoted by [D]I . Similar to the observational case, I essential graph of a DAG D is the graph union of all DAGs in the same I equivalence class; it is denoted by EI(D). We have the following sequence:\nD → CI learning → Meek rules → E(D) → I1 a → learn by R0 b → Meek rules\n→ E{I1}(D) → I2 . . . → E{I1,I2}(D) . . . (1)\nTherefore, after a set of interventions I has been performed, the essential graph EI(D) is a graph with some oriented edges that captures all the causal relations we have discovered so far, using I. Before any interventions happened E(D) captures the initially known causal directions. It is known that EI(D) is a chain graph with chordal chain components. Therefore when all the directed edges are removed, the graph becomes a set of disjoint chordal graphs."

Given that all interventions in I are of size at most k < n/2 variables, i.e., for each intervention I , |I| ≤ k, ∀I ∈ I, minimize the number of interventions |I| such that the partially directed graph with all directions learned so far EI(D) = D.\nThe question is the design of an algorithm that computes the small set of interventions I given E(D). Note, of course, that the unknown directions of the edges D are not available to the algorithm. One can view the design of I as an active learning process to find D from the essential graph E(D). E(D) is a chain graph with undirected chordal components and it is known that interventions on one chain components do not affect the discovery process of directed edges in the other components [5]. So we will assume that E(D) is undirected and a chordal graph to start with. Our notion of algorithm does not consider the time complexity (of statistical algorithms involved) of steps a and b in (1). Given m interventions, we only consider efficiently computing Im+1 using (possibly) the graph E{I1,...Im}. We consider the following three classes of algorithms:\n1. Non-adaptive algorithm: The choice of I is fixed prior to the discovery process. 2. Adaptive algorithm: At every step m, the choice of Im+1 is a deterministic function of E{I1,...Im}(D). 3. Randomized adaptive algorithm: At every step m, the choice of Im+1 is a random function of E{I1,...Im}(D). The problem is different for complete graphs versus more general chordal graphs since rule R1 becomes applicable when the graph is not complete. Thus we give a separate treatment for each case. First, we provide algorithms for all three cases for learning the directions of complete graphs E(D) = Kn (undirected complete graph) on n vertices. Then, we generalize to chordal graph skeletons and provide a novel adaptive algorithm with upper and lower bounds on its performance.\nThe missing proofs of the results that follow can be found in the Appendix."

Possible future work includes obtaining a tighter lower bound for chordal graphs that would possibly establish a tighter approximation guarantee for our algorithm."

      "text" : "We describe a string labeling procedure as follows to label elements of the set [1 : n]. String Labelling: Let a > 1 be a positive integer. Let x be the integer such that ax < n ≤ ax+1. x+1 = ⌈loga n⌉. Every element j ∈ [1 : n] is given a label L(j) which is a string of integers of length x + 1 drawn from the alphabet {0, 1, 2 . . . a} of size a+1. Let n = pdad+ rd and n = pd−1ad−1+ rd−1 for some integers pd, pd−1, rd, rd−1, where rd < a\nd and rd−1 < ad−1. Now, we describe the sequence of the d-th digit across the string labels of all elements from 1 to n:\n1. Repeat 0 ad−1 times, repeat the next integer 1 ad−1 times and so on circularly 8 from {0, 1 . . . a− 1} till pdad.\n2. After that, repeat 0 ⌈rd/a⌉ times followed by 1 ⌈rd/a⌉ times till we reach the nth position. Clearly, n-th integer in the sequence would not exceed a− 1.\n3. Every integer occurring after the position ad−1pd−1 is increased by 1.\nFrom the three steps used to generate every digit, a straightforward calculation shows that every integer letter is repeated at most ⌈n/a⌉ times in every digit i in the string. Now, we would like to prove inductively that the labels are distinct for all n elements. Let us assume the induction hypothesis: For all n < aq+1, the labels are distinct. The base case of q = 0 is easy to see. Then, we would like to show that for aq+1 ≤ n < aq+2, the labels are distinct.\nAnother way of looking at the labeling procedure is as follows. Let n = aq+1p + r with r < aq+1. Divide the label matrix L (of dimensions (q + 2)× n) into two parts, one L1 consisting of the first paq+1 columns and the other L2 consisting of the remaining columns. The first q + 1 rows of L1 is nothing but the string labels for all numbers from 0 to paq+1 expressed in base a. For any row i ≤ ⌈loga r⌉ in the original matrix L of labels, till the end of first paq+1 columns, the labeling procedure would be still in Step 1. After that, one can take r to be the new size of the set of elements to be labelled and then restart the procedure with this r. Therefore we have the following key observation: L2(1 : ⌈loga r⌉, :) (the matrix with first ⌈loga r⌉ rows of L2) is nothing but the label matrix for r distinct elements from the above labeling procedure.\nSince, r < aq+1, by the induction hypothesis, the columns are distinct. Hence, any two columns in L2 are distinct. Suppose the first q + 1 rows of two columns b and c of L1 are identical. These correspond to base a expansion of b− 1 and c− 1. They are separated by at least aq+1 + 1 columns. But the last row of columns b and p in L1 has to be distinct because according to Step 2 and Step 3 of the labeling procedure, in the q + 2th row, every integer is repeated at most ⌈n/a⌉ ≤ aq+1 times continuously, and only once. Therefore, any two columns in L1 are distinct. The last row entries in L1 are different from L2 because of the addition in Step 3. Therefore, all columns of L are distinct. Hence, by induction, the result is shown."

Therefore, we will reveal a partial order σ\n(m−1) to satisfy the observations so far. Inductively for every m, we will make sure that after Im is chosen by the algorithm, further details about σ can be revealed to form σ(m) such that after intervening on I2 and then applying R0, we will make sure there is no opportunity to apply the rule R2. This would make sure that I is a separating system on n elements.\nBefore intervention at any step m, let us ‘tag’ every vertex i using a subset C(m−1)i ⊆ [1 : m] such that C (m−1) i = {p : i ∈ Ip, p ≤ m − 1}. C (m−1) i contains indices of all those interventions that contain vertex i before step m.\n8Circular means that after a− 1 is completed, we start with 0 again.\nLet C(m−1) contain distinct elements of the multi-set {C(m−1)i } .We will construct σ partially such that it satisfies the following criterion always:\nInductive Hypothesis: The partial order σ(m−1) is such that for any two elements i, j with Ci and Cj , i and j are incomparable if Ci = Cj and comparable otherwise. This means the edges between the elements tagged with the same tag C has not been revealed, and thus the relevant directed edges are not known by the algorithm.\nNow, we briefly digress to argue that if we could construct σ(1), σ(2) . . . satisfying such a property throughout, then clearly all vertices must be tagged differently otherwise the directions among the vertices that are tagged similarly cannot be learned by the algorithm. Therefore, the algorithm has not succeeded in its task. If all vertices are tagged differently, then it means it is a separating system.\nConstruction of σ(m): We now construct σ(m) that can be shown to satisfy the induction hypothesis before step m + 1. Before step m , consider the vertices in C ∈ C(m−1) for any C. Let the current intervention be Im chosen by the deterministic algorithm. We make the following changes: Modify σ(m−1) such that vertices in Im ⋂\nC come before (Im)c ⋂\nC in the partial order σ(m) (vertices inside either sets are still not ordered amongst themselves) in the ordering and clearly the directions between these two sets are revealed by R0. By the induction hypothesis for step m and with the new tagging of vertices into C(m), it is easy to see that only directions between distinct C′s in the new C(m) have been revealed and all directions within a tag set C are not revealed and all vertices in a tag set are contiguous in the ordering so far. We need to only show that rule R2 cannot reveal anymore edges amongst vertices in C ∈ C(m) after the new σ(m) and intervention Im. Suppose there are two vertices i, j such that just after intervention Im and the modified σ(m), they are tagged identically and application of R2 reveals the direction between i and j before the next intervention. Then there has to be a vertex k tagged differently from i, j such that j → k and k → i are both known. But this implies that j and i are comparable in σ(m) leading to a contradiction. This implies the hypothesis holds for step m+ 1.\nBase case: Trivially, the induction hypothesis holds for step 0 where σ(0) leaves the entire set unordered."

A perfect elimination ordering σp = {v1, v2 . . . vn} on the vertices of an undirected chordal graph G is such that for all i, the induced neighborhood of vi on the subgraph formed by {v1, v2 . . . vi−1} is a clique.\nLemma 5. ( [6]) If all directions in the chordal graph are according to perfect elimination ordering (edges go only from vertices lower in the order to higher in the order), then there are no immoralities.\nWe make the following observation: Let the directions in a graph D be oriented according to an ordering σ on the vertices. If a clique comes first in the ordering, then the knowledge of edge directions in the rest of the graph, excluding that of the clique, cannot help at any stage of the intervention process on the clique; because all the edges are directed outwards from the clique and hence none of the Meek rules apply. This is because, if a → b is to be inferred by Meek rules from other known directions, then either there has to be a known edge direction into a or b before the inference step. So if one of the directed edges not from the clique was to help in the discovery process, either that edge has to be directed towards a or b (like in Meek rules R1, R2 and R3), or it has to be directed towards c in another c → a (R4) which belongs to the clique. Both the above cases are not possible.\nLemma 6. ( [6]) Let C be a maximum clique of an undirected chordal graph E(D), then there is an underlying DAG D on the chordal skeleton that is oriented according to a perfect elimination ordering (implying no immoralities), where the clique C occurs first.\nBy Lemmas 5, 6 and the observation above, given a chordal skeleton, we can construct a DAG on the skeleton with no immoralities such that the directions of the maximum clique in D cannot be learned by using knowledge of the directions outside. This means that only the intervention sets {I1 ⋂ C, I2 ⋂\nC . . .} matter for learning the directions on this clique. Therefore inference on the clique is isolated. Hence, all the lower bounds for the clique case transfer to this case and since the size of the largest clique is exactly the coloring number of the chordal skeleton, the theorem follows."

Such graphs are called split graphs and as n → ∞, the fraction of split graphs to chordal graphs tends to 1. If E(D) = G where G is a split graph skeleton, it is enough to intervene only on the nodes in the clique and therefore the number of interventions that are needed is that for the clique. It is certainly possible to orient the edges in such a way so as to avoid immoralities, since the graph is chordal.\nExample with |I| which needs to be close to the upper bound: We construct a connected chordal skeleton with independent set α and clique size χ (also coloring number) such that it would require α(χ−1)2k interventions at least for any algorithm over a class of orientations.\nConsider a line L consisting of vertices 1, 2 . . .2α such that every node 1 < i < 2α is connected to i−1 and i+1. For, all 1 ≤ p ≤ α, consider a clique Cp of size χ which only has nodes 2p − 1, 2p from the line L. Now assume that the actual orientation of the L is 1 → 2 . . . → 2α. In every clique, the orientation is partially specified as follows: In every clique Cp, all edges from node 2p − 1 are outgoing. It is very clear that this partial orientation excludes all\nimmoralities. Further, each clique Cp − {2p− 1} can have any arbitrary orientation out of χ− 1 possible ones in the actual DAG. Now, even if all the specified directions are revealed to the algorithm, the algorithm has to intervene on all α disjoint cliques {Cp − {2p− 1}}αp=1 each of size χ− 1 and directions in one clique will not force directions on the others through any of the Meek rules or rule R0. Therefore, the lower bound of α(χ−1)2 total node accesses (total number of nodes intervened) is implied by Theorem 4. Given every intervention is of size k, these chordal skeletons with the revealed partial order needs at least α(χ−1)2k more experiments.\n6.11 Performance Comparison of Our Algorithm vs. Naive Scheme for n = 500, k = 10 and n = 2000, k = 20"

    "abstractText" : "We consider the problem of learning causal networks with interventions, when each intervention is limited in size under Pearl’s Structural Equation Model with independent errors (SEM-IE). The objective is to minimize the number of experiments to discover the causal directions of all the edges in a causal graph. Previous work has focused on the use of separating systems for complete graphs for this task. We prove that any deterministic adaptive algorithm needs to be a separating system in order to learn complete graphs in the worst case. In addition, we present a novel separating system construction, whose size is close to optimal and is arguably simpler than previous work in combinatorics. We also develop a novel information theoretic lower bound on the number of interventions that applies in full generality, including for randomized adaptive learning algorithms. For general chordal graphs, we derive worst case lower bounds on the number of interventions. Building on observations about induced trees, we give a new deterministic adaptive algorithm to learn directions on any chordal skeleton completely. In the worst case, our achievable scheme is an α-approximation algorithm where α is the independence number of the graph. We also show that there exist graph classes for which the sufficient number of experiments is close to the lower bound. In the other extreme, there are graph classes for which the required number of experiments is multiplicatively α away from our lower bound. In simulations, our algorithm almost always performs very close to the lower bound, while the approach based on separating systems for complete graphs is significantly worse for random chordal graphs.",
