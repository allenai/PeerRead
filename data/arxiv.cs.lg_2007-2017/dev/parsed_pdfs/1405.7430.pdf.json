      "text" : "Bayesian optimization (Mockus, 1989; Brochu et al., 2010) is a special case of nonlinear optimization where the algorithm decides which point to explore next based on the analysis of a distribution over functions P (f), for example a Gaussian process or other surrogate model. The decision is taken based on a certain criterion C(·) called acquisition function. Bayesian optimization has the advantage of having a memory of all the observations, encoded in the posterior of the surrogate model P (f |D) (see Figure 1). Usually, this posterior distribution is sequentially updated using a nonparametric model. In this setup, each observation improves the knowledge of the function in all the input space, thanks to the spatial correlation (kernel) of the model. Consequently, it requires a lower number of iterations compared to other nonlinear optimization algorithms. However, updating the posterior distribution and maximizing the acquisition function increases the cost per sample. Thus, Bayesian optimization is normally used to optimize expensive target functions f(·), which can be multimodal or without closed-form. The quality of the prior and posterior information about the surrogate model is of paramount importance for Bayesian optimization, because it can reduce considerably the number of evaluations to achieve the same performance."

      "text" : "BayesOpt uses a surrogate model of the form: f(x) = φ(x)Tw + ǫ(x), where we have ǫ(x) ∼ NP (\n0, σ2s(K(θ) + σ 2 nI)\n)\n. Here, NP() means a nonparametric process, for example, a Gaussian, Student-t or Mixture of Gaussians process. This model can be considered as a linear regression model φ(x)Tw with heteroscedastic perturbation ǫ(x), as a nonparametric process with nonzero mean function or as a semiparametric model. The library allows to define hyperpriors on w, σ2s and\nθ. The marginal posterior P (f |D) can be computed in closed form, except for the kernel parameters θ. Thus, BayesOpt allows to use different posteriors based on empirical Bayes (Santner et al., 2003) or MCMC (Snoek et al., 2012)."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.1 Implementation",
      "text" : "Efficiency has been one of the main objectives during development. For empirical Bayes (ML or MAP of θ), we found that a combination of global and local derivative free methods such as DIRECT (Jones et al., 1993) and BOBYQA (Powell, 2009) marginally outperforms in CPU time to gradient based method for optimizing θ by avoiding the overhead of computing the marginal likelihood derivative. Also, updating θ every iteration might be unnecessary or even counterproductive (Bull, 2011).\nOne of the most critical components, in terms of computational cost, is the computation of the inverse of the kernel matrix K(·)−1. We compared different numerical solutions and we found that the Cholesky decomposition method outperforms any other method in terms of performance and numerical stability. Furthermore, we can exploit the structure of the Bayesian optimization algorithm in two ways. First, points arrive sequentially. Thus, we can do incremental computations of matrices and vectors, except when the kernel parameters θ are updated. For example, at each iteration, we know that only n new elements will appear in the correlation matrix, i.e.: the correlation of the new point with each of the existing points. The rest of the matrix remains invariant. Thus, instead of computing the whole Cholesky decomposition, being O(n3) we just add the new row of elements to the triangular matrix, which is O(n2). Second, finding the optimal decision at each iteration xi requires multiple queries of the acquisition function from the same posterior C(x|P (f |D)) (see Figure 1). Also, many terms of the criterion function are independent of the query point x and can be precomputed. This behavior is not standard in nonparametric models, and to our knowledge, this is the first software for Gaussian processes/Bayesian optimization that exploits the idea of precomputing all terms independent of x.\nA comparison of CPU time (single thread) vs accuracy with respect to other open source libraries is represented in Table 1 with respect to two different configurations of BayesOpt. SMAC (Hutter et al., 2011), HyperOpt (Bergstra et al., 2011) and Spearmint (Snoek et al., 2012) used the HPOlib (Eggensperger et al., 2013) timing system (based on runsolver). DiceOptim (Roustant et al., 2012) used R timing system (proc.time). For BayesOpt, standard ctime was used.\nAnother main objective has been flexibility. The user can easily select among different algorithms, hyperpriors, kernels or mean functions. Currently, the library supports continuous, discrete and categorical optimization. We also provide a method for optimization in high-dimensional spaces (Wang et al., 2013). The initial set of points (initial design, see Figure 1) can be selected using well\nknown methods such as latin hypercube sampling or Sobol sequences. BayesOpt relies on a factorylike design for many of the components of the optimization process. This way, the components can be selected and combined at runtime while maintaining a simple structure. This has two advantages. First, it is very easy to create new components. For example, a new kernel can be defined by inheriting the abstract kernel or one of the existing kernels. Then, the new kernel is automatically integrated in the library. Second, inspired by the GPML toolbox by Rasmussen and Nickisch (2010), we can easily combine different components, like a linear combination of kernels or multiple criteria. This can be used to optimize a function considering an additional cost for each sample, for example a moving sensor (Marchant and Ramos, 2012). BayesOpt also implements metacriteria algorithms, like the bandit algorithm GP-Hedge by Hoffman et al. (2011) that can be used to automatically select the most suitable criteria during the optimization. Examples of these combinations can be found in Section 2.3.2.\nThe third objective is correctness. For example, the library is thread and exception safe, allowing parallelized calls. Numerically delicate parts, such as the GP-Hedge algorithm, had been implemented with variation of the actual algorithm to avoid over- or underflow issues. The library internally uses NLOPT by Johnson (2014) for the inner optimization loops (optimize criteria, learn kernel parameters, etc.).\nThe library and the online documentation can be found at: https://bitbucket.org/rmcantin/bayesopt/"

It has been tested and compiled in different operating systems (Linux, Mac OS, Windows), with different compilers (Visual Studio, GCC, Clang, MinGW).

For example, in C/C++:\ndouble my function (unsigned int n query , const double ∗query , double ∗ gradient , void ∗ f unc data ) ;\nThe gradient has been included for future compatibility. Python, Matlab and Octave interfaces define a similar template function.\nFor a more object oriented approach, we can inherit the abstract module and define the virtual methods. Using this approach, we can also include nonlinear constraints in the checkReachability method. This is available for C++ and Python. For example, in C++:\nclass MyOptimization : public bayesopt : : ContinuousModel { public : MyOptimization( s i z e t dim , bopt params param ) : ContinousModel (dim , param) {} double evaluateSample ( const boost : : numeric : : ublas : : vector<double> &query ) { // My func t i on here } ; bool checkReachab i l i ty ( const boost : : numeric : : ublas : : vector<double> &query ) { // My con s t r a i n t s here } ; } ;"
