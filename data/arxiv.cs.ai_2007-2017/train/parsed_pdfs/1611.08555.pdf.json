New theories, techniques, algorithms have been rapidly developed. One of the most striking trends in the neutrosophic theory is the hybridization of neutrosophic set with other potential sets such as rough set, bipolar set, soft set, hesitant fuzzy set, etc. The different hybrid structure such as rough neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic rough set, bipolar neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, etc. are proposed in the literature in a short period of time. Neutrosophic set has been a very important tool in all various areas of data mining, decision making, e-learning, engineering, medicine, social science, and some more.\nThe Book “New Trends in Neutrosophic Theories and Applications” focuses on theories, methods, algorithms for decision making and also applications involving neutrosophic information. Some topics deal with data mining, decision making, elearning, graph theory, medical diagnosis, probability theory, topology, and some more.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n9\nPreface\nNeutrosophic set has been derived from a new branch of philosophy, namely Neutrosophy. Neutrosophic set is capable of dealing with uncertainty, indeterminacy and inconsistent information. Neutrosophic set approaches are suitable to modeling problems with uncertainty, indeterminacy and inconsistent information in which human knowledge is necessary, and human evaluation is needed.\nNeutrosophic set theory was proposed in 1998 by Florentin Smarandache, who also developed the concept of single valued neutrosophic set, oriented towards real world scientific and engineering applications. Since then, the single valued neutrosophic set theory has been extensively studied in books and monographs introducing neutrosophic sets and its applications, by many authors around the world. Also, an international journal - Neutrosophic Sets and Systems started its journey in 2013.\nSingle valued neutrosophic sets have found their way into several hybrid systems, such as neutrosophic soft set, rough neutrosophic set, neutrosophic bipolar set, neutrosophic expert set, rough bipolar neutrosophic set, neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, etc. Successful applications of single valued neutrosophic sets have been developed in multiple criteria and multiple attribute decision making.\nThe present book starts by proposing an approach for data mining with single valued neutrosophic information from large amounts of data and then progresses to topics in decision making in neutrosophic environment and neutrosophic hybrid environment, e-learning, graph theory, medical diagnosis, neutrosophic models in sociology, topology, and some more.\nThe book collects thirty original research and application papers from different perspectives covering different areas of neutrosophic studies, such data mining, decision making, e-learning, graph theory, medical diagnosis, probability theory, topology, and some theoretical papers. This book shows examples applications of neutrosophic set and neutrosophic hybrid set in multiple criteria and multiple attribute decision making, medical diagnosis, etc.\nThe first chapter presents the two essential pillars of data mining: similarity measures and machine learning in single valued neutrosophic environment. It shows that neutrosophic logic can perform an important role in data mining method. It defines single valued neutrosophic score function (SVNSF) to aggregate attribute values of each alternative. It also presents an approach of data mining with single valued neutrosophic information from large amounts of data, and furnishes a numerical example for the proposed approach.\nThe second, third, and fourth chapter deal with decision making in neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy information.\nThe second chapter presents a class of distance measures for single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets and discusses their properties with parameter changing. It also provides multi-attribute decision making (MADM), an illustrative example, and a comparison with other existing methods.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n10\nThe third chapter presents an axiomatic system of distance and similarity measures between single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets. It also proposes a class of distance and similarity measures based on three basic forms: the geometric distance model, the set-theoretic approach, and the matching functions. The distance measure between each alternative and the ideal alternative is used to establish a multiple attribute decision making method under single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy environment. It provides a numerical example of investment alternatives to show the effectiveness and the usefulness of the proposed approach.\nThe fourth chapter extends grey relational analysis (GRA) method for MADM by defining score value, accuracy value, certainty value, and normalized Hamming distance of single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set (SVNHFS). It also defines the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the negative ideal solution (NIS) by score value and accuracy value. It proposes GRA method for multi-attribute decision making under single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set environment. It also provides an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nThe fifth chapter exposes TOPSIS method for MADM problems with bipolar neutrosophic information. The Hamming and the Euclidean distance functions are defined in order to determine the distance between bipolar neutrosophic numbers. The bipolar neutrosophic relative positive ideal solution (BNRPIS) and bipolar neutrosophic relative negative ideal solution (BNRNIS) are also characterized. The applicability of the proposed method is verified and a comparison with other existing methods is provided.\nThe sixth chapter presents TOPSIS approach for multi-attribute decision making in refined neutrosophic environment. An illustrative numerical example of tablet selection is provided to show the applicability of the proposed TOPSIS approach.\nThe seventh chapter presents several new similarity measures based on trigonometric Hamming similarity operators of rough neutrosophic sets and their applications in decision making. Some properties of the proposed similarity measures are established. Also, a numerical example is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed similarity measures in decision making.\nThe eighth chapter develops a fuzzy single valued neutrosophic set with entropy weight based MADM technique. Its feasibility for automated guided vehicle (AGV) selecting and ranking of material handling systems for a given industrial application is examined.\nThe ninth chapter makes a connection between decision making in game and real life. The tenth chapter develops two new methods for solving multiple attribute decision making\n(MADM) problems with interval valued neutrosophic assessments. It also discusses an alternative method to solve MADM problems based on the combination of angle cosine and projection method.

It also investigates some of their related properties.\nThe sixteenth chapter expounds two ways of determining the neutrosophic distance between neutrosophic vertex graphs. It proposes two neutrosophic distances based on the Haussdorff distance, and a robust modified variant of the Haussdorff distance. These distances satisfy the metric distance measure axioms. Furthermore, a similarity measure between neutrosophic edge graphs is explained, based on a probabilistic variant of Haussdorff distance.\nThe seventeenth chapter describes operations on interval valued neutrosophic graphs. It presents operations of Cartesian product, composition, union and join on interval valued neutrosophic graphs. It investigates some of their properties with proofs and examples.\nThe eighteenth chapter conveys the usefulness of neutrosophic theory in medical imaging, e.g. denoising and segmentation.\nThe nineteenth chapter delivers a theoretical framework of love dynamics in neutrosophic environment.\nThe twentieth chapter emphasizes the neutrosophic crisp probability theory and the decision making process by presenting some fundamental definitions and operations.\nThe 21st and 22nd chapters devote to study neutrosophic sets and neutrosophic topology.

This approach gives a presentation of data analysis common to all applications. Data mining depends on two main elements, namely the concept of similarity and the machine learning framework. It describes a lot of real world applications for the domains namely mathematical, medical, educational, chemical, multimedia etc. There are two main types of indeterminacy in supervised learning: cognitive and statistical. Statistical indeterminacy deals with the random behavior of nature. All existing data mining techniques can handle the uncertainty that arises (or is assumed to arise) in the natural world from statistical variations or randomness. Cognitive uncertainty deals with human cognition. In real world problems for data mining, indeterminacy components may arise. Neutrosophic logic can handle this situation. In this paper, we have shown the role of single valued neutrosophic set logic in data mining. We also propose a data mining approach in single valued neutrosophic environment.\nKeywords\nData mining, single valued neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic score value.\n1. Introduction Data mining [1] is actually assumed as “knowledge mining” from data. Data mining is an essential process where intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns [2]. Data mining is a process that analyzes large amounts of data to find new and hidden information. In other words; it is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into some useful information. The following are the different data mining techniques [3]: association, classification, clustering, and sequential patterns. E.Hullermeier [4] proposed fuzzy methods in data mining.\nThis paper focuses on real-world applications of single valued neutrosophic set [5] for data mining. Data mining decomposes into two main elements: the notion of similarity and the single valued neutrosophic machine learning techniques that are applied in the described applications. Indeed, similarity, or more generally comparison measures are used at all levels of the data mining\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n16\nand information retrieval tasks. At the lowest level, they are used for the matching between a query to a database and the elements it contains, for the extraction of relevant data. Then similarity and dissimilarity measures can be used in the process of cleaning and management of missing data to create a reasonable set of data. To generalize particular information contained in this reasonable set, dissimilarity measures are used in the case of inductive learning and similarity measures for case-based reasoning or clustering tasks. Eventually, similarities are used to interpret results of the learning process into an expressible form of knowledge through the definition of prototypes. Most of collective data for an investigation involves indeterminacy. Single valued neutrosophic set can handle his situation. So, there is an important role of single valued neutrosophic set in data mining.\nThis paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 presents some basic knowledge of single valued neutrosophic set. Section 3 considers the component of similarity, and machine learning techniques. Section 4 describes a methodical approach of data mining under single valued neutrosophic environment. Section 5 presents a numerical example for data mining. Section 6 presents concluding remarks.\n2. Neutrosophic Preliminaries\n2.1 Definition on neutrosophic sets [6]\nThe concept of neutrosophic set is originated from neutrosophy [6], a new branch of philosophy.\nDefinition 1:[6] Let ξ be a space of points (objects) with generic element in ξ denoted by x. Then a neutrosophic set α in ξ is characterized by a truth membership function Tα an indeterminacy membership function Iα and a falsity membership function Fα. The functions Tα and Fα are real standard or non-standard subsets of   1,0 that is Tα:   1,0 ; Iα:   1,0 ; Fα:   1,0 .\nIt should be noted that there is no restriction on the sum of  xT  ,  xI ,  xF i.e.       30    xFxIxT\nDefinition 2: [6] The complement of a single valued neutrosophic set α is denoted by c and is defined by\n     xTxT c   1 ;      xIxI c   1\n     xFxF c   1\nDefinition 3: (Containment) [6] A single valued neutrosophic set α is contained in the other single valued neutrosophic set β,  if and only if the following result holds.\n   ,infinf xTxT      xTxT   supsup\n   ,inf≥inf xIxI     xIxI   supsup\n   ,infinf xFxF      xFxF   supsup\nfor all x in ξ.

Data Mining [2]\nIn this section, we discuss the theoretical background common to the applications, considering successively the notion of similarity and machine learning techniques under single valued neutrosophic environment.\n3.1 Similarity [2]\nThe notion of similarity or more generally of comparison measures, is central for all real-world applications: it aims at quantifying the extent to which two objects are similar, or dissimilar, one to another, providing a numerical value for this comparison. Similarities and dissimilarities between objects are generally evaluated from values of their attributes or variables characterizing these objects. Dissimilarities are classically defined from distances. Similarities and dissimilarities are often expressed from each other: the more similar two objects are, the less dissimilar they are, the smaller their distance. Weights can be associated with variables, according to the semantics of the application or the importance of the variables. It appears that some quantities are used in various environments, with different forms, based on the same principles. Most of the classic dissimilarity measures between two objects with continuous numerical attributes are the Euclidian distance, the Manhattan distance, and more generally Minkowski distances.\n3.2 Neutrosophy Machine Learning [2]\nThe second part of the theoretical background common to all applications concerns the neutrosophy machine learning techniques that use the previous similarity measures. Machine learning is an important way to extract knowledge from sets of cases, especially in large scale databases. In this section, we consider only the neutrosophy machine learning methods (involving indeterminacy) that are used in the applications, leaving aside other techniques as for neutrosophy case-based reasoning or neutrosophy association rules. Three methods are successively considered: neutrosophy decision trees, neutrosophy prototypes and neutrosophy clustering. The first two belong to the supervised learning framework, i.e. they consider that each data point is associated with a category. Single valued neutrosophic set clustering belongs to the unsupervised learning framework, i.e. no decomposition of the data set with indeterminacy into categories is available.\n3.2.1. Single valued neutrosophic set Decision Trees [2]\nNeutrosophy decision trees (NDT) particularly can be interesting for data mining and information retrieval because they enable the user to take into account indeterminacy descriptions of the cases, or heterogeneous values (symbolic, numerical, or neutrosophical) [5]. Moreover, they are appreciated for their interpretability, because they provide a linguistic description of the relations between descriptions of the cases and decision to make or class to assign. The rules obtained through NDT make it easier for the user to interact with the system or the expert to understand, confirm or amend his own knowledge. Another quality of NDT is their robustness, since a small variation of descriptions does not drastically change the decision or the class associated with a case, which guarantees a resistance to measurement errors and avoids sharp differences for close values of the descriptions.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n19\n3.2.2. Single valued neutrosophic set Prototype Construction [2] Neutrosophy prototypes are another approaches to the characterization of data categories: they provide descriptions or interpretable summarizations of data sets, so as to help a user to better apprehend their contents: a prototype is an element chosen to represent a group of data, to summarize it and underline its most characteristic features. It can be defined from a statistical point of view, for instance as the data mean or the median; more complex representatives can also be used as the most typical value [7] for instance. The prototype notion was also studied from a cognitive science point of view, and specific properties were pointed out in [8]: it was shown that a prototype underlines the common features of the category members, but also their distinctive features as opposed to other categories, underlining the specificity of the group. Furthermore, prototypes were related to the typicality notion, i.e. the fact that all data do not have the same status as regards the group: some members of the group are better examples, more representative or more characteristic than others. It was also shown that the typicality of a point depends both on its resemblance to other members of the group (internal resemblance), and on its dissimilarity to members of other groups (external dissimilarity). More precisely, the method consists of computing internal resemblance and external dissimilarity for each data point. Internal resemblance and external dissimilarity are respectively defined as the aggregation (mean or median) of the resemblance to the other members of the group, and as the aggregation of the dissimilarity to members of other groups, for a given choice of the resemblance and dissimilarity measures.\n4. Single Valued Neutrosophic Logic in Data Mining The tools that have been proposed in single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) have the potential to support all of the steps that neutralized a process of knowledge discovery. SVNS can be used in the data selection and preparation phase for data modeling. For any data analysis associated with an experiment or investigation, it is observed that much information involve indeterminacy. Single valued neutrosophic set logic is capable of dealing with this situation. So, for the case of data mining single valued neutrosophic set logic has an important role.\nStandard methods of data analysis can be extended in a rather generic way by means of an extension principle. For example, the functional relation between the data points and the decision making function can be extended to the case of single valued neutrosophic data, where the observations are described in terms of single valued neutrosophic sets. If single valued neutrosophic data is not used in the data preparation phase, they can still be employed in a later stage in order to analyze the original data.\nVarious techniques are widely used for data mining from gathering data within a domain of expertise. Delphi method [9] and BIRCH method [10] are very popular for data mining. Rekha and Swapna [2] studied the role of fuzzy logic in data mining. Literature review reflects that there is no single valued neutrosophic approach for data mining till now.\n4.1. Neutrosophic data mining method\nGenerally, there are many attributes in decision making problems, where some of them are important and others may not be so important. So it is crucial to select the proper attributes for decision-making situation. Now, we shall propose a methodical approach for data mining with\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n20\nsingle valued neutrosophic information to prepare a panel of attributes which are technically sound. All steps of this proposed approach are given as follows.\nStep 1: Problem field selection\nConsider a multi-attribute decision making problem with m alternatives and n attributes (large numbers of data). Let A1, A2, ..., Am and C1, C2, ..., Cn denote the alternatives and attributes respectively. In decision making process, we have to select a finite but more important attributes from given n attributes. All attributes are expressed in single valued neutrosophic number.\nSingle valued neutrosophic score function (SVNSF) corresponding to each attribute is defined as follows.\n \n  m r rjrjrj j FIT m CSVNSF 1 3 21)( (2)\nWhere, j = 1, 2, …, n\nUsing equation (2) we calculate single valued neutrosophic score matrix as follows.\nTable: Single valued neutrosophic score matrix\n)( jCSVNSF\n)(\n)( )(\n22\n11\nnn CSVNSFC\nCSVNSFC CSVNSFC\nvaluescoreicneutrosophvaluedSingleattributes\n\n(3)\nStep 3: Selection zone Single valued neutrosophic score values are classified into three zones. These are described as\nfollows.\nDefinition 11: SVNSF of all the attributes are classified in three categories and it is defined as follows\nHighly acceptable zone: 0.50  SVNSF(Cj)  1\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n21\nTolerable acceptable zone: 0.25  SVNSF(Cj)  0.50 Unacceptable acceptable zone: 0.00  SVNSF(Cj)  0.25\nStep 4: Ranking of attributes According to the single valued neutrosophic score values, we can set up a panel of all attributes in descending order and we can choose important attributes from large number of attributes into decision making process considering highly acceptable zone and tolerable acceptable zone\nStep 5: End\n5. Numerical Example In this section we demonstrate a numerical problem for applicability and effectiveness of this proposed approach. The methodical steps are as follows. Step 1: Problem field selection\nSuppose a person who wants to purchase a SIM card for mobile connection. So, it is necessary to select suitable SIM card for his/her mobile connection. There is a panel with four possible alternatives (SIM cards) for mobile connection. The alternatives (SIM cards) are presented as follows:\nA1: Airtel A2: Vodafone A3: BSNL A4: IDEA.

We also propose an approach for data mining with single valued neutrosophic information from large amounts of data and furnish a numerical example for the proposed approach. In future this method can be extended in interval neutrosophic environment for data mining.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n23\nReferences 1.

This set is a useful tool to handle imprecise, incomplete and inconsistent information existing in multi-attribute decision making problems. In multi-attribute decision making, distance measures play an important role to take a decision regarding alternatives. In this paper we propose a variety of distance measures for single valued neutrosophic sets. Furthermore, we apply these measures to multi-attribute decision making problem with singlevalued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set environment to find out the best alternative. We provide an illustrative example to validate and to show fruitfulness of the proposed approach. Finally, we compare the proposed approach with other existing methods for solving multi-attribute decision making problems.\nKeywords Hesitant fuzzy sets, single-valued neutrosophic set, single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, distance measure, multi-attribute decision making problem.\n1. Introduction Distance and similarity measures are significant in a variety of scientific fields such as decision making, pattern recognition, and market prediction. Lots of studies have been done on fuzzy sets [1], intuitionistic fuzzy sets [2], and neutrosophic sets [3]. Among them the most widely used distance measure are Hamming distance and Euclidean distance. Generally when people make decision, they often hesitate to select for one thing or another to reach the final decision. Tora and Narukawa [4], Tora [5] introduced hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), an extension of fuzzy set, which allows the membership degree to assume a set of possible values. HFS can express the hesitant information compressively than other extensions of fuzzy sets. Xu and Xia [6] defined some distance measures on the basis of well-known Hamming distance and Euclidean distance and the Housdroff metric. They developed a class of hesitant distance measures and discussed some of their properties. Peng et al. [7] proposed the generalised hesitant fuzzy synergetic weighted distance measure and applied\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n28\nit to multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problem, where the best alternative. Having defined hesitancy degree, Li et al. [8] proposed some distance and similarity measures on HFSs and developed a TOPSIS method for MADM.\nOn the other hand, Zhu et al. [9] proposed a dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) which consists of two parts one is the membership hesitancy function and another is the non-membership hesitancy function. DHFS generalises fuzzy set (FS), intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS), hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), and its membership degree and non-membership degree are presented by two set of possible values. Consequently, DHFS can represent imprecise and uncertain information existing in real decision making problem in more flexible way than FS, IFS, HFS. Singh [10] defined some distance and similarity measures of DHFSs on the basis of the geometric distance model, the set theoretic approach and the matching functions to study MADM with DHFSs.\nHowever, HFSs and DHFSs cannot represent indeterminacy hesitant function for incomplete or inconsistent information. This type of function is an another issue to be considered in decision making and thus it should be included with membership hesitant and non-membership hesitant function to catch up imprecise, incomplete, inconsistent information found in decision making process. Ye [11] introduced single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set (SVNHF) which consists of three parts  the truth membership hesitancy function, the indeterminacy membership hesitancy function, and falsity membership hesitancy function. This set can express imprecise, incomplete, inconsistent information with these three kinds of hesitancy functions in a more flexible way. In same discussions [11], Ye developed two aggregation operators for SVNHFS information and applied these operators to MADM problems. Sahin and Liu [12] defined correlation coefficient of SVNHFSs to solve MADM with SVNHFSs. Literature review suggests that the distance measures and similarity measures have not been studied, therefore we need to develop distance measures for SVNHFSs.\nIn this paper, we propose a class of distance measures for single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets and study their properties with variational parameters. We apply the weighted distance measures to calculate the distances between each alternative and ideal alternative in the MADM problems. With these distance values, we present the ranking order of alternatives for selecting the best one. We present an illustrative example to verify the proposed approach and to show its fruitfulness. Finally, we compare the proposed method with other existing methods for solving MADM under SVNHF environment.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents some basics of single-valued neutrosophic set and hesitant fuzzy sets and the existing distance measures for HFSs. Section 3 proposes Hamming distance measure, Euclidean distance measure, generalised distance measure, and Hausdroff distance. Section 4 devotes application of proposed distance measure to MADM with SVNHFS information. In Section 5, an illustrative example is given to validate and show effectiveness of the proposed approach. In Section 6, we present concluding remarks and future scope of research.\n2. Preliminaries In this section we review some basic definitions regarding single-valued neutrosophic sets and hesitant fuzzy sets to develop the present paper.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n29\n2.1. Single valued neutrosophic set\nDefinition 1. [13] Let X be a space of points (objects) with a generic element in X denoted by .x A SVNS A in X is characterized by a truth membership function (x),AT an indeterminacy membership function (x),AI and a falsity membership function (x)AF and is denoted by  , (x), (x), (x) | .A A AA x T I F x X  Here (x)AT , (x)AI and (x)AF are real subsets of [0,1] that is (x) : X [0,1]AT  , (x) : X [0,1]AI  and (x) : X [0,1]AF  . The sum of (x)AT , (x)AI and (x)AF lies in [0,3] that is 0 (x) (x) (x) 3.A A AT I F    For convenience, SVNS A can be denoted by (x), (x), (x)A A AA T I F for all x in X . Now we mention some commonly used distance measures for two SNVS A and B on\n1 2{ , ,..., }nX x x x . 1.

[4, 5, 16] Let X be a fixed set. A hesitant fuzzy set A on X is presented in terms of a function such that when applied to X returns a subset of[0,1] , i.e.  , ( ) |AA x h x x X  , where ( )Ah x is a set of some different values in [0,1] , representing the possible membership degrees of the element x X to .A For convenience, ( )Ah x is called a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE).\nWe have some well-known distance measures for two SNVS A and B on 1 2{ , ,..., }nX x x x . 1.

( ( ))A il h x and ( ( ))B il h x are the number of values in ( )A ih x and ( )B ih x , respectively.\nDefinition 3. [16] Let 1A , 2A and 3A be three HFSs on 1 2{x , x ,..., x }nX  , then the distance measure between 1A and\n2A is defined as  1 2,d A A , which satisfies the following properties:\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n30\n1.  1 20 , 1d A A  ; 2.  1 2, 0d A A  if and only if 1 2A A ; 3.  1 2,d A A =  2 1,d A A ;\nThe similarity measure between 1A and 2A is defined as  1 2,s A A , which satisfies the following properties:\n1.  1 20 , 1s A A  ; 2.  1 2, 1s A A  if and only if 1 2A A ; 3.  1 2,s A A =  2 1,s A A .\nIf  1 2,d A A be the distance measure between two HFSs 1A and 2A , then    1 2 1 2, 1 ,s A A d A A  is the similarity measure between two HFSs 1A and 2A . Similarly, if  1 2,s A A be the similarity measure between two HFSs 1A and 2A , then    1 2 1 2, 1 ,d A A s A A  is the distance measure between two HFSs 1A and 2A .\n3. Distance measure of single valued neutrosophic sets The neutrosophic set [3] theory pioneered by Smarandache has emerged as one of the research focus in many branches such as management sciences, engineering, applied mathematics. Neutrosophic set generalizes the concept of the crisp set, fuzzy set [1], interval valued fuzzy set [17], intuitionistic fuzzy set [2], and interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy set [18]. Definition 4. [11]\nLet X be a fixed set, then a single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set N on X is defined as follows:\n , ( ), ( ), ( ) |N x t x i x f x x X  , where, ( )t x , ( ),i x ( )f x are three sets of some values in [0,1] , denoting the respectively the possible truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership degrees of the element x X to the set N . The membership degrees ( ),t x ( )i x and ( )f x satisfy the following conditions:\n0 , , 1,    0 3      where, ( ),t x  ( ),i x  ( ),f x\n( ) ( ) max ( ), t x t x t x       \n( ) ( ) max ( ) i x i x i x       \nand\n( ) ( ) max ( ) i x f x f x       for all x X .\nFor convenience of notation, the triple ( ) ( ), ( ), ( )n x t x i x f x is called a single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy element (SVNHFE) and is denoted by , ,n t i f . It is to be noted that the number of values for possible truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership degrees of the element in different SVNHFEs may be different. Definition 5.

Application of proposed distance measure in multi-attribute decision making In this section we use the proposed distance measures to find out the best alternative in multiattribute decision making with single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy environment. For a multi-attribute decision making problem, assume that  1 2, ,..., mA A A A be the set of m alternatives, 1 2{ , ,..., }nC C C C be the set of n attributes, whose weight vector 1 2( , ,..., )Tnw w w w , satisfies 0( 1,2,..., )jw j n  and 1 1, n jj w \n where jw denotes the weight of the attribute .jC The performance of the alternative iA with respect to the attribute jC is measured by an SVNHFE { , , }ij ij ij ijn t i f , where { | ,0 1},ij ij ij ij ijt t      { | ,0 1},ij ij ij ij iji i      and { | ,0 1}ij ij ij ij ijf f      are the possible truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership degree, respectively such that 0 3,ij ij ij        where,\nmax{ } ij ij ij ij t     , max{ } ij ij ij ij i     , and max{ } ij ij ij ij f     .\nAll { , , }( 1,2,..., ; 1,2,..., )ij ij ij ijn t i f i m j n   are contained in SVNHF decision matrix ( )ij m nN n  (See Table 1.)\nTable 1. SVNHF decision matrix 1C 1C … nC 1A 11n 11n … 11n 1A 11n 11n … 11n\nmA 1mn 1mn 1mn Basically attributes are two types:\n1. benefit type attributes, 2. cost type attributes.\nIn such cases, we propose the rating values of ideal alternatives *jA as * * * *{ , , }j j j jn t i f for 1,2,...,j n , where,\n* {{1},{0},{0}}jn  for benefit type attributes and * {{0},{1},{1}}jn  for cost type attributes. Then to determine the best alternatives, we propose the following steps: Step 1. Determine the distance between an alternative ( 1,2,..., )jA j n and the ideal alternative *A\nusing proposed distance measure according to the nature of attributes. Step 2. Rank the alternative on the basis of distance measure values. Step 3. Obtain the best alternative according to the minimum value of distance measure.\n5. Numerical example In this section we consider the example adopted from Ye [11] to illustrate the application of the proposed GRA method for MADM proposed in Section 4. Consider an investment company that wants to invest a sum of money in the best option. There is a panel with four possible alternatives: (1) 1A is the car company; (2) 2A is the food company; (3) 3A is the computer company; (4) 4A is\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n33\nthe arms company. To take a decision, the investment company consider three attributes: (1) 1C is the risk analysis; (2) 2C is the growth analysis; (3) 3C is the environmental impact analysis.\nThe attribute weight vector is given as (0.35,0.25.0.40)TW  . The four possible alternatives 1 2 3 4{ , , , }A A A A are evaluated by using SVNHFEs under three attributes ( 1,2,3).jC j  We can arrange the rating values in a matrix form namely a SVNHF decision matrix 4 3( )ijX x  that is shown in Table1.\nTable 1.

Step 1.Using Eq.(14), we calculate the SVNH weighted distance measure between alternatives\n( 1,2,3,4)iA i  and ideal alternative *A for 1,2,5,10  which are shown in Table 2.: Table 2.

Step 3. Based on the minimum value of SVNH weighted distance measures for different values of 1,2,5,10  , we conclude that 2A as the best alternative, which is same as the results obtained in Ye [11] and Sahin and Liu [12].\nFrom Table-2, we observe that ranking results change with different values of  .Therefore taking the values of  according to decision maker’s preference play a crucial role in ranking process. Ye [11] considered weighted cosine similarity measure of SVNHFs and Sahin and Liu [12] proposed weighted correlation co-efficient to determine the ranking order of alternatives. In both studies, we see that there is no option to consider different values of the attitudinal character  that can change the ranking result as we have seen in our study. Thus our method is more realistic and flexible over these two methods, furthermore our method is simple and effective.\n6. Conclusion In this paper, we develop a class of distance measures for single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets and discussed their properties with variational parameters. We apply the weighted\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n34\ndistance measures to calculate the distances between each alternative and ideal alternative in the MADM problems. With these distance values, we obtain the ranking order of alternatives for selecting the best one. We provide an illustrative example to verify the proposed approach and to show its fruitfulness. Finally, we compared the proposed method with other existing methods for solving MADM under SVNHF environment. The proposed method is simple and effective to handle MADM under SVNHF. We hope that the proposed distance measures can be extended to interval neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, and can be applied in medical diagnosis, pattern recognition, and personal selection under neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy environment.\nReferences 1.

There is no consensus on the best way to determine the order of a sequence of singlevalued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy elements. In this paper, we first develop an axiomatic system of distance and similarity measures between single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets and also propose a class of distance and similarity measures based on three basic forms such that the geometric distance model, the set-theoretic approach, and the matching functions. Then we utilize the distance measure between each alternative and ideal alternative to establish a multiple attribute decision making method under single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy environment. Finally, a numerical example of investment alternatives is provided to show the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach. The advantages of the proposed distance measure over existing measures have been discussed.\nKeywords Single-valued neutrosophic set, hesitant fuzzy set, single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, distance measure, similarity measure, multiple attribute decision making.\n1. Introduction Most of our traditional tools for formal modeling, reasoning and computing are crisp, deterministic and precise in character. However, there are many complicated problems in economics, engineering, environment, social science, medical science, etc., that involve data which are not always all crisp. Classical methods cannot successfully handle uncertainty, because the uncertainties appearing in these domains may be of various types. Zadeh (1965) introduced fuzzy\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n36\nsets (FS) and applied them in many fields including uncertainty. As a generalization of the fuzzy sets, Atanassov (1986) introduced the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS). Then Atanassov and Gargov (1989) extended the concept of IFS to interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS). Current literature has very large number of distance and similarity measures for FSs and IFSs (Atanassov 1986; Xuecheng 1992; Chen et al. 1995; Liu et al. 2015; Farhadinia 2014; Wang 1997; Szmidt and Kacprzyk 2000; Khaleie and Fasanghari 2012; Grzegorzewski 2004; Wang and Xin 2005; Xu 2007; Hung and Yang 2007; Li 2007; Şahin 2015; Tan 2011).\nTorra and Narukawa (2009) and Torra (2010) proposed the concept of hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), discussed the relationship between hesitant fuzzy set and intuitionistic fuzzy set and showed that the envelope of hesitant fuzzy set is an intuitionistic fuzzy set. The membership degree of an element in hesitant fuzzy set includes a set of possible values between zero and one. Since its appearance, the hesitant fuzzy information has been used to solve multiple attribute decision making problems. Xia and Xu (2011) defined some techniques for aggregating hesitant fuzzy information and utilized their performances in decision making. Based on the relationship between HFS and IFS, they proposed the set-theoretic laws of HFSs. Xu and Xia (2011) defined a collection of distance measures for HFSs and generated the similarity measures associated with the proposed distance measures.\nFurthermore, Zhu et al. (2012) introduced dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) as a generalization of FSs, IFSs, HFSs, and fuzzy multisets (FMSs) and presented some basic operations of DHFSs. A DHFS are characterized by two class of possible values, the membership degrees and nonmembership degrees. Therefore, DHFSs include FSs, IFSs, HFSs, and FMSs under certain conditions, and so they have the desirable performances and advantages of its own and appear to be a more favorable method than aforementioned sets because of considering much more information given by decision makers. Singh (2013) introduced a comprehensive family of distance measures and related similarity measures for DHFSs.\nAs a new branch of philosophy that combines the knowledge of logics, philosophy, set theory, and probability, Smarandache (1999, 2005) proposed the concept of neutrosophic sets (NSs) as a further generalization of uncertainty modeling tools. Unlike the aforementioned sets, a neutrosophic set consists of three membership functions such that the truth-membership function, the indeterminacy-membership function and the falsity membership function. Additionally, the uncertainty presented here, i.e. the indeterminacy factor, is independent on the truth and falsity values, whereas the incorporated uncertainty is dependent on the degrees of belongingness and non-belongingness of existing sets. The structure of NSs is not appropriate to apply to real-life situations. Therefore, Wang et al. (2005, 2010) developed single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) and interval neutrosophic sets (INSs), which are an extension of NSs. Şahin (2014) proposed a neutrosophic hierarchical clustering algorithm based on relationship between SVNSs. Şahin and Küçük (2014) defined a subsethood measure for SVNSs and applied it in a decision making problem. The correlation coefficients of SVNSs as well as a decision-making method using SVNSs were proposed by Ye (2013). In addition, Ye (2014b) investigated the concept of simplified neutrosophic sets (SNSs), which can be expressed by three real numbers in the real unit interval [0,1], provided the set-theoretic operators of SNSs, and developed a multi criteria decision making\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n37\n(MCDM) method based on the aggregation operators of SNSs. But, Peng et al. (2015) showed that some operations of Ye (2014b) may also be unrealistic in special cases, and defined the novel operations and aggregation operators and applied them to MCDM problems. Also, Ye (2014a) proposed the single valued neutrosophic cross-entropy for solving multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problems with single valued neutrosophic information. Broumi and Smarandache (2013) extended the correlation coefficient to INSs. Zhang et al. (2014) developed a MCDM method based on aggregation operators within an interval neutrosophic environment. Furthermore, Majumdar and Samanta (2014) proposed the distance and similarity measures between SVNSs. Ye (2014d) extended these measures to INSs as based on the relationship between similarity measures and distances. Liu and Wang (2014) discussed a single-valued neutrosophic normalized weighted Bonferroni mean (SVNNWBM) operator based on Bonferroni mean, the weighted Bonferroni mean (WBM), and the normalized WBM. Peng et al. (2015) introduced the multi-valued neutrosophic sets (MVNSs) and developed the operations of multi-valued neutrosophic numbers (MVNNs) based on Einstein operations.\nRecently, Ye (2015c) proposed the concept of single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set (SVNHFS) as a generalization of FSs, IFSs, HFSs, FMSs, and also SVNSs and discussed the basic operations and properties of SVNHFSs. SVNHFSs consist of three parts, first is the truthmembership hesitancy function, second is the indeterminacy-membership hesitancy function, and third is the falsity-membership hesitancy function. The current sets, including FSs, IFSs, HFSs, FMSs, and SVNSs can be regarded as special cases of SVNHFSs. In a SVNHFS, the truthmembership hesitancy degrees, indeterminacy-membership hesitancy degrees and falsitymembership hesitancy degrees are represented by three sets of possible values between zero and one, respectively. Therefore, it is not only more general than aforementioned set but only more suitable for solving MADM problems due to considering much more information provided by decision makers.\nFrom above analysis, we cannot utilize the current measures for dealing with distance and similarity measure between SVNHFSs. Therefore, we need to develop new distance and similarity measures for SVNHFSs, because a SVNHFS consists of three basic membership function such that the truth-membership hesitancy function and indeterminacy-membership hesitancy function and falsity-membership hesitancy function. In this paper, we first define a compressive class of distance measures between SVNHFSs and then proposed the similarity measures based on the geometric distance model, the set-theoretic approach and the matching functions. Also, we show that the proposed measures satisfies the axiom definition of distance and similarity measures developed for SVNHFSs. Finally, we utilize the proposed distance measure to solve a MADM problem with single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy information. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce some basic concepts related to HFS, SVNS and SVNHFS, and some operational and theoretical laws. In Section 3, we propose a variety class of distance measures of SVNHFSs as a further generalization of the existing distance measure for HFSs, DHFSs, IFSs, and SVNSs. Based on the geometric distance model, the set-theoretic approach and the matching functions, we present some similarity measures between SVNHFSs. Section 4 develops a MADM method with single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy information based on the proposed distance\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n38\nmeasure for SVNHFSs. In Section 6, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the developed method. Section 7 gives related comparative analysis. Finally, conclusions and future work are given in Section 8.\n2. Preliminaries In this subsection, we give some concepts related to NSs and SVNSs. 2.1 Neutrosophic set Definition 1.

Wang et al. (2010) defined the single valued neutrosophic set which is an instance of neutrosophic set.\n2.2.Single valued neutrosophic sets Definition 2. Wang et al. (2010) Let \uD835\uDC4B be a universe of discourse, then a single valued neutrosophic set is defined as:\n\uD835\uDC34 = {〈\uD835\uDC65, \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDCBE\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65)〉: \uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B}, (2)\nwhere \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC34: \uD835\uDC4B → [0,1], \uD835\uDCBE\uD835\uDC34: \uD835\uDC4B → [0,1] and \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC34: \uD835\uDC4B → [0,1] with 0 ≤ \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65) + \uD835\uDCBE\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65) + \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65) ≤ 3 for all \uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B. The values \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDCBE(\uD835\uDC65) and \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65) denote the truth-membership degree, the indeterminacymembership degree and the falsity membership degree of \uD835\uDC65 to \uD835\uDC34, respectively. 2.3.Hesitant fuzzy sets Definition 3. (Torra 2010) A hesitant fuzzy set \uD835\uDC40 on \uD835\uDC4B is defined in terms of a function ℎ\uD835\uDC40 when applied to \uD835\uDC4B, which returns a finite subset of [0,1], i.e.,\n\uD835\uDC40 = {〈\uD835\uDC65, ℎ\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDC65)〉: \uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B}, (3)\nwhere ℎ\uD835\uDC40(\uD835\uDC65) is a set of some different values in [0,1], representing the possible membership degrees of the element \uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B to \uD835\uDC40. 2.4.Single-valued neutrosophic hesitant sets Definition 4. (Ye 2014c) Let \uD835\uDC4B be a fixed set, then a single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set \uD835\uDC34 on \uD835\uDC4B is defined as,\n\uD835\uDC34 = {〈\uD835\uDC65, (\uD835̃\uDC61\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835̃\uDCBE\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65))〉: \uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B} (4)\nin which \uD835̃\uDC61\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835̃\uDCBE\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), and \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65) are three sets of some different values in [0,1], denoting the truth-membership hesitant degrees, indeterminacy-membership hesitant degrees, and falsitymembership hesitant degrees of the element \uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B to \uD835\uDC34, respectively, with the conditions 0 ≤ \uD835\uDEFE, \uD835\uDEFF, \uD835\uDF02 ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ \uD835\uDEFE+ + \uD835\uDEFF+ + \uD835\uDF02+ ≤ 3, where \uD835\uDEFE ∈ \uD835̃\uDC61\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDEFF ∈ \uD835̃\uDCBE(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDF02 ∈ \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDEFE+ ∈ \uD835̃\uDC61\uD835\uDC34+(\uD835\uDC65) =\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n39\n⋃ max{\uD835\uDEFE}\uD835\uDEFE∈\uD835̃\uDC61\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65) , \uD835\uDEFF + ∈ \uD835̃\uDCBE\uD835\uDC34 +(\uD835\uDC65) = ⋃ max{\uD835\uDEFF}\uD835\uDEFF∈\uD835̃\uDCBE\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65) , and \uD835\uDF02 + ∈ \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC34 +(\uD835\uDC65) = ⋃ max{\uD835\uDF02}\uD835\uDF02∈\uD835̃\uDC53\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65) for \uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B. For convenience, the three tuple \uD835\uDC34 = { (\uD835̃\uDC61\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835̃\uDCBE\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65))} is called a single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy element (SVNHFE) or a triple hesitant fuzzy element, which is denoted by the simplified symbol \uD835\uDC34 = { (\uD835̃\uDC61\uD835\uDC34, \uD835̃\uDCBE\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC34)}.\nNow, we give the following definitions to propose the distance and similarity measures between SVNHFSs. Definition 5 Let \uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35 and \uD835\uDC36 be three SVNHSs on \uD835\uDC4B = {\uD835\uDC651, \uD835\uDC652, … , \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC5B}, then the distance measure between \uD835\uDC34 and \uD835\uDC35 is defined as \uD835̃\uDC51(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35), which satisfies the following properties:\n(1) 0 ≤ \uD835̃\uDC51(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35) ≤ 1; (2) \uD835̃\uDC51(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35) = 0 if and only if \uD835\uDC34 = \uD835\uDC35; (3) \uD835̃\uDC51(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35) = \uD835̃\uDC51(\uD835\uDC35, \uD835\uDC34). (4) \uD835̃\uDC51(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35) ≤ \uD835̃\uDC51(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC36) and \uD835̃\uDC51(\uD835\uDC35, \uD835\uDC36) ≤ \uD835̃\uDC51(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC36), if \uD835\uDC34 ⊆ \uD835\uDC35 ⊆ \uD835\uDC36.\nDefinition 6. Let \uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35 and \uD835\uDC36 be three SVNHSs on \uD835\uDC4B = {\uD835\uDC651, \uD835\uDC652, … , \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC5B}, then the similarity measure between \uD835\uDC34 and \uD835\uDC35 is defined as \uD835̃\uDC60(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35), which satisfies the following properties:\n(1) 0 ≤ \uD835̃\uDC60(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35) ≤ 1; (2) \uD835̃\uDC60(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35) = 1 if and only if \uD835\uDC34 = \uD835\uDC35; (3) \uD835̃\uDC60(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35) = \uD835̃\uDC60(\uD835\uDC35, \uD835\uDC34).

(10)\nIn many practical situations, the weight of each element \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B should be taken into account. For instance, in MADM problems, the considered attribute usually has different importance, thus needs to be assigned with different weights. Since in SVNHFSs, we have three types of degree, one is truth-membership degree, other is indeterminacy-membership and final is falsity-membership degree. Since three degrees may have different importance, according to decision maker, different weights can be assigned to each element in each degree.

Suppose that \uD835\uDF14 = (\uD835\uDF141, \uD835\uDF142, …\uD835\uDF14\uD835\uDC5B)\uD835\uDC47, \uD835\uDF13 = (\uD835\uDF131, \uD835\uDF132, …\uD835\uDF13\uD835\uDC5B)\uD835\uDC47 and \uD835\uDF19 = (\uD835\uDF191, \uD835\uDF192, …\uD835\uDF19\uD835\uDC5B)\n\uD835\uDC47 are the potential weighting vector assigned to the truth-membership, the indeterminacy-membership and the falsity-membership, respectively, in each alternative, where \uD835\uDF14\uD835\uDC57 ≥ 0,\uD835\uDF13\uD835\uDC57 ≥ 0 and \uD835\uDF19\uD835\uDC57 ≥ 0, \uD835\uDC57 = 1,2, … , \uD835\uDC5B, ∑ \uD835\uDF14\uD835\uDC57\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC57=1 = 1, ∑ \uD835\uDF13\uD835\uDC57\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC57=1 = 1 and ∑ \uD835\uDF19\uD835\uDC57\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC57=1 = 1. If the decision makers provide several values for the alternative \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC56(\uD835\uDC56 = 1,2,… ,\uD835\uDC5A) under the attribute \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC57 (\uD835\uDC57 = 1,2,… , \uD835\uDC5B), these values can be characterized as a SVNHFN \uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57 = {\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57, \uD835\uDCBE\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57, \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57} (\uD835\uDC57 = 1,2,… , \uD835\uDC5B; \uD835\uDC56 = 1,2,… ,\uD835\uDC5A). Assume that \uD835\uDC38 = [\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57]\uD835\uDC5A×\uD835\uDC5B is the decision matrix, where \uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57 is expressed by a single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy element.\nIn multiple attribute decision-making environments, we can utilize the concept of ideal point to determine the best alternative in the decision set. Although the ideal alternative does not exist in real world, it does provide a useful theoretical construct against which to evaluate alternatives. Therefore, we propose each ideal SVNHFN in the ideal alternative \uD835\uDC34∗ = {〈\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC57, \uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC57∗〉: \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC57 ∈ \uD835\uDC36} as \uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC57∗ = {\uD835̃\uDC61\uD835\uDC57 ∗, \uD835̃\uDCBE\uD835\uDC57 ∗, \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC57 ∗} = {{1}, {0}, {0}} (\uD835\uDC57 = 1,2, … , \uD835\uDC5B).\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n49\nThus, we can develop a procedure for the decision maker to select the best choice with single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy information, which can be given as follows:\nStep1. Compute the distance (similarity) measure between an alternative \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC56 (\uD835\uDC56 = 1,2, . . . , \uD835\uDC5A) and the ideal alternative \uD835\uDC34∗ by using proposed distance (similarity) measure. Step 2. Rank all of the alternative with respect to the values of distance (similarity) measure. Step 3. Choose the best alternative with respect to the minimum value of distance (maximum value of similarity). Step4. End.\n6. Practical example Here, an example for the multicriteria decision-making problem of alternatives is used as the demonstration of the application of the proposed decision-making method, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nWe take the example adopted from Ye (2014c) to illustrate the utility of the proposed distance and similarity measures. Also, we show that the results obtained using the proposed distance measure are more reasonable than the results obtained using Ye’s (2014c) cosine similarity measure.\nExample 11. Suppose that an investment company that wants to invest a sum of money in the best option. There is a panel with four possible alternatives in which to invest the money: (1) \uD835\uDC341 is a car company, (2) \uD835\uDC342 is a food company, (3) \uD835\uDC343 is a computer company, and (4) \uD835\uDC344 is an arms company. The investment company must make a decision according to the three attributes: (1) \uD835\uDC361 is the risk analysis; (2) \uD835\uDC362 is the growth analysis, and (3) \uD835\uDC363 is the environmental impact analysis. Suppose that \uD835\uDF14 = (0.35, 0.25, 0.40), \uD835\uDF13 = (0.35, 0.40, 0.25), and \uD835\uDF19 = (0.30, 0.40, 0.30) are the attribute weight vector for truth-membership degree, the indeterminacy-membership degree and the falsity membership degree, respectively. The four possible alternatives are to be evaluated under these three attributes and are presented in the form of single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy information by decision maker according to three attributes \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC57 (\uD835\uDC57 = 1,2,3), as expressed in the following single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy decision matrix \uD835\uDC38:\nStep 1. Using Eq. (12), we can compute the single valued neutrosophic hesitant weighted Hamming distance between the alternatives and the ideal alternative as:\n\uD835̃\uDC51\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B(\uD835\uDC341, \uD835\uDC34 ∗) = 0.4370, \uD835̃\uDC51\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B(\uD835\uDC342, \uD835\uDC34 ∗) = 0.2383, \uD835̃\uDC51\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B(\uD835\uDC343, \uD835\uDC34 ∗) = 0.3679, \uD835̃\uDC51\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B(\uD835\uDC344, \uD835\uDC34 ∗) = 0.2654. Step 2. With respect to the values of weighted Hamming distance, we can rank the alternatives as \uD835\uDC342 ≻ \uD835\uDC344 ≻ \uD835\uDC343 ≻ \uD835\uDC341.\nStep 3. The alternative \uD835\uDC342 is the optimal choice according to the minimum value among weighted Hamming distances, which is not in agreement with the one obtained in Ye (2014c).\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n50\nAbove example clearly shows that the developed method is effective and applicable under singlevalued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy environment.\n7. Related comparative analysis Case 1. Ye (2014c) proposed a method based on single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators and cosine measure function to find the best alternative. This method lacks the decision makers’ risk factor, which causes the distortion of similarity between an alternative and the ideal alternative and makes the proposed method more realistic. Therefore, the results of the proposed method don’t coincide with the existing method Ye (2014c). In proposed method, we not only consider the decision makers’ risk case but also the individual weighting vectors of truthmembership, indeterminacy-membership, and falsity-membership degrees of each element in decision space, separately. From Table 2, we can see that the rankings are changed according to different parameters \uD835\uDF06, consequently, the proposed distance measure can provide a more flexible decision and more choice for decision makers because of the decision maker’ risk factor and the individual weighting vector of membership degrees. Combining the analyses above, our method is more precise and reliable than the result produced in Ye (2014c).\nCase 2. In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed decision making method, we give another comparative study between our method and existing methods and use the concept of weighted Euclidian distance. Xu and Xia’s method (2011) is used to rank the HFSs which are only characterized by a set of the membership degrees, whereas Singh’s method (2013) is applied to DHFSs which are taken into account both the membership hesitant degree and the non-membership hesitant degree in decision making process.\nOn the other hand, we also utilize the weighted Euclidian distance to determine the final ranking order of all the alternatives associated with SVNHFS, which are expressed by the truth-membership\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n51\nhesitant degree, indeterminacy-membership hesitant degree, and falsity-membership hesitant degree, to calculate the distance measures and to rank all of the alternatives according to these values. Using the MCDM problem in Example 11, the results with different methods are shown in Table 3.\nAccording to the results presented in Table 3, if the distance methods in Xu and Xia (2011) and the Singh (2013) are used, then the best alternatives are \uD835\uDC342 and the worst one is \uD835\uDC341, respectively. Ye’s method (2014c) say that the best ones are \uD835\uDC344 and the worst one is \uD835\uDC341. With respect to proposed method in this paper, the best one is \uD835\uDC342 and \uD835\uDC341 is the worst one. But, there are some small differences in the ranking of the alternatives due to definition of set theories. Additionally, from results of Table 3, we can say that the concept of distance measure is more remarkable and more useable than cosine measure to determine the order of the alternatives.\nAs mentioned above, the single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set is a generalization of FSs, IFSs, HFSs, FMSs, DHFSs and also SVNSs. Therefore a SVNHFS (truth-membership hesitant degree, indeterminacy-membership hesitant degree, and falsity-membership hesitant degree) contains more information than the HFS (membership hesitant degree), the IFS (both membership degree and nonmembership degree), the DHFS (membership hesitant degree and nonmembership hesitant degree), and also SVNS (truth-membership degree, indeterminacy-membership degree, and falsity-membership degree). Then, the proposed distance and similarity measures of SVNHFSs is a further generalization of the distance and similarity measures of FSs, IFSs, HFSs, FMSs, DHFSs and also SVNSs. In other words, the distance and similarity measures of FSs, IFSs, HFSs, FMSs, DHFSs and also SVNSs are special cases of the distance and similarity measures of SVNHFSs proposed in this paper. Therefore, the discrimination measures for SVNHFSs can be used to solve not only distance and similarity measures with SVNHFSs but also the problems of fuzzy environment, hesitant fuzzy environment, intuitionistic fuzzy environment, dual hesitant fuzzy environment and single valued neutrosophic environment, whereas the methods in Xu and Xia (2011), Xu (2007), Singh (2013) and Majumdar and Samanta (2014) are only sustainable for problems with HFSs, IFSs, DHFSs, and SVNSs, respectively. Moreover, since SVNHFSs include the aforementioned fuzzy sets, the decision-making method using the proposed distance and similarity measures is more general and more feasibility than existing decision-making methods in fuzzy setting, intuitionistic fuzzy setting, hesitant fuzzy setting, dual hesitant fuzzy setting, and single-valued neutrosophic setting.\n8. Conclusions Based on the combination of both HFSs and SVNSs as a further generalization of fuzzy concepts, the SVNHFS contains more information because it takes into account the information of its truthmembership hesitant degree, indeterminacy-membership hesitant degree, and falsity-membership hesitant degree, whereas the HFS only contains the information of its membership hesitant degrees and DHFS contains the information of its membership hesitant degree and nonmembership hesitant degree. Therefore, it has the desirable characteristics and advantages of its own, appears to be a more flexible method than the existing methods and include much more information given by decision makers. Based on the geometric distance model, the set-theoretic approach, and the\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n52\nmatching functions, this paper proposed some distance and similarity measures between SVHNSs as a new extension of discrimination measures between fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets, dual hesitant fuzzy sets and the single-valued neutrosophic sets. In a multiple attribute decision making process with single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy information, the proposed distance measure between each alternative and the ideal alternative was used to rank the alternatives and determine the best one(s) according to the measure values. Finally, a numeric example was given to verify the proposed approach and to show its practicality and favorable. The developed method has useable and effective calculation, and presents a new model for handling decision-making problems under the single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy environment. In the future, we shall further develop more discrimination measures such as correlation coefficient, entropy and crossentropy for SVNHFSs and apply them to solve practical applications in these areas, such as group decision making, expert system, clustering, information fusion system, fault diagnoses, and medical diagnoses.\nReferences 1.

Single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set is considered as a powerful tool to express uncertain, incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent information in the process of multi attribute decision making problems. In this paper we study multi attribute decision making problems in which the rating values are expressed with single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set information. Firstly, we define score value and accuracy value to compare single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets and then define normalised Hamming distance between the single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets. Secondly, we propose the grey relational analysis method for multi attribute decision making under single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set environment. Finally, we provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.\nKeywords Hesitant fuzzy sets, single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy sets, score and accuracy function, grey relational analysis method, multi-attribute decision making.\n1. Introduction Multi-attribute decision making (MADM) used in human activities is a useful process for selecting the best alternative that has the highest degree of satisfaction from a set of feasible alternatives with respect to the attributes. Because the real world is fuzzy rather than precise in nature, the rating values of alternative with respect to attribute considered in MADM problems are often imprecise or incomplete in nature. This has led to the development of the fuzzy set theory proposed by Zadeh [1]. Fuzzy set theory has been proved to be an effective tool in MADM process [2-6]. However, fuzzy set can represent imprecise information with membership degree only. The intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) proposed by Attanasov [7], a generalisation of fuzzy sets, is characterized by membership and non-membership functions where non-membership is\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n56\nindependent. Recently, IFS has been successfully applied in many decision making problems, especially in MADM problems [8-12].\nHowever IFS can handle incomplete information and but it cannot express indeterminate and inconsistent information with membership and non-membership functions. Smarandache [13] introduced the neutrosophic set (NS) from philosophical point of view to deal with uncertain, imprecise, incomplete and inconsistent information that exist in real world. NS is characterised with truth membership, indeterminacy and falsity membership degree, which are independent in nature. This set generalises the concept of crisp set, fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set, paraconsistent set, dialetheist set, paradoxist set, and tautological set. Since the introduction of NS and single-valued neutrosophic set proposed by Wang et al. [14] in 2010, the model of decision making under neutrosophic environment has been received much attention to the researchers. Many methods of MADM such as TOPSIS method [15, 16], grey relational analysis (GRA) method [17,18], distance and similarity measure method [19-23], and outranking method [24] were developed under neutrosophic environment.\nHowever, in a decision making process sometimes decision maker may feel hesitate to take decision among the set of possible values instead of single value. Tora [25], Tora and Narukawa [26] introduced the hesitant fuzzy set (HF), which permits the membership degree of an element to a given set to be represented by the set of possible numerical values in [0,1]. HF, an extension of fuzzy set, is useful to deal uncertain information in the process of MADM. Xia and Xu [27] proposed some aggregation operators for hesitant fuzzy information and applied them to MADM problem in hesitant fuzzy environment. Wei [28] studied some models for hesitant fuzzy MADM problem by developing some prioritized aggregation operators for hesitant fuzzy information. Xu and Zhang [29] developed TOPSIS method for hesitant fuzzy MADM with incomplete weight information.\nDecision maker does not consider the non-membership degrees of rating values in hesitant fuzzy MADM. However, non-membership degrees play an important role to express incomplete information. Zhu et al. [30] gave the idea of the dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS), in which membership degrees and non-membership degrees are in the form of sets of values in [0,1]. DHFS generalizes the HF sets and expresses incomplete information effectively. Ye [31] and Chen et al.[32] proposed co-relation method between DHFSs and applied the method to MADM with hesitant fuzzy information. Singh [33] defined and applied distance and similarity measure between DHFSs in MADM. However in a decision making process, indeterminate type information cannot be captured with DHFS.\nIn 2014, Ye [34] introduced single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set (SVNHFS) by coordinating HFS and SVNS. SVNHFS generalises the FS, IFS, HFS, DHFS and SVNS, and can represent uncertain, imprecise, incomplete and inconsistent information. SVNHFSs are characterized by truth hesitancy, indeterminacy hesitancy and falsity-hesitancy membership functions which are independent. Therefore SVNHFS can express the three kinds of hesitancy information that exist in MADM in real situations. Ye [34] developed single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging and single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric operators for SVNHFS information and applied these two operators in MADM. Liu and Shi [35] proposed hybrid weighted average operator for interval neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set in which the truth hesitancy, indeterminacy hesitancy and falsity-hesitancy membership functions are in the form of sets of interval values contained in [0, 1]. Sahin and Liu [36] defined co-relation coefficient between SVNHFSs and used it for MADM.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n57\nGrey relational analysis (GRA)[37], a part of grey system theory, is successfully applied in solving a variety of MADM problems in intuitionistic fuzzy environment [38-42], neutrosophic environment [43], interval neutrosophic environment [44, 45, 46], neutrosophic soft set environment [47-49], rough neutrosophic environment [50] respectively. However, literature review reflects that GRA method of MADM with SVNHFS has not been studied in the literature. Therefore we need attention for this issue. The aim of the paper is to extend the concept of GRA method for solving MADM problem in which the rating values of the alternatives over the attributes are considered with SVNHFSs.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents some basic concept related to SVNHFSs. In Section 3, we propose GRA method for MADM problems, where rating values are considered with SVNHFSs. In Section 4, we illustrate our proposed method with an example. Section 5 presents concluding remarks of the study.\n2. Preliminaries In this section we recall some basic definitions of hesitant fuzzy set, single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, score function accuracy function of triangular fuzzy intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Definition 1. [25]Let X be a fixed set, then a hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) A on X is in terms of a function that when applied to X returns a subset of [0,1] , i.e.,  , ( ) |AA x h x x X  , where, ( )Ah x is a set of some different values in [0,1] , representing the possible membership degrees of the element x X to .A For convenience, ( )Ah x is called a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE).\nDefinition 2. [34] Let X be fixed set, then a single valued hesitant fuzzy element (SVHFE) N on X is defined as  , ( ), ( ), ( ) |N x t x i x f x x X  (1)\nwhere ( ),t x ( )i x and ( )f x represent three sets of values in  0,1 , denoting respectively the possible truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership degree of the element x X to the set N . The membership degrees ( ),t x ( )i x and ( )f x satisfy the following conditions:\n0 , , 1;    0 3        (2) where, ( ), ( ), ( )t x i x f x     ,\n( ) ( ) max ( ), t x t x t x        ( ) ( ) max ( ), t x i x i x        ( ) ( ) max ( ) t x f x f x     \n  for\nall x X . For convenience, the triplet ( ) ( ), ( ), ( )n x t x i x f x is called a SVNHFE denoted by , ,n t i f . Note\nthat the number of values for possible truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership degrees of the element in different SVNHFEs may be different.\nDefinition 3. [34] Let 1 1 1 1, ,n t i f and 2 2 2 2, ,n t i f be two SVNHFEs, the following operational rules are defined as follows: 7.  \n1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 , , , , , { },{ },{ , } ; t i f t i f n n t t t t i i f f               \n8.   1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 , , , , , { },{ },{ } ; t i f t i f n n t t i i i i f f f f                 \n9.   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 , , {1 (1 ) },{ },{ } , 0 t i f n t i f               ;\n10.   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 , , { },{1 (1 ) },{1 (1 ) } , 0. t i f n t i f                \nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n58\nDefinition 4. Let , ,i i i in t i f ( 1,2,..., )i n be a collection of SVNHFEs, then the score function ( )iS n , and accuracy function ( )iA n of ( 1,2,..., )in i n can be defined as follows:\n1. 1 1 1 1( ) 2 3i t i ft i f S n l l l                      (3) 2. 1 1( ) ;i t ft f A n l l         (4)\nwhere, ,tl ,il and ,fl are the numbers of values of ,it ,ii and if respectively in .in Definition 5. Let 1 1 1 1, ,n t i f and 2 2 2 2, ,n t i f be two SVNHFEs, the following rules can be\ndefined for comparison purposes: 1. If 1 2( ) ( )S n S n , then 1n is greater than 2n and denoted by 1 2n n ; 2. If 1 2( ) ( )S n S n and 1 2( ) ( )A n A n , then 1 2n n ; 3. If 1 2( ) ( )S n S n and 1 2( ) ( )A n A n , then 1 2n n .\nDefinition 6. Let 1 1 1 1, ,n t i f and 2 2 2 2, ,n t i f be two SVNHFEs, the normalised Hamming distance is defined as\n1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 21 2 1 2 1 2\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1( , ) 3 t t i i f ft t i i f f D n n l l l l l l                                     (5)\nwhere , kt l , ki l and kf l are the possible membership values in kn for 1,2k  , respectively. The distance function 1 2( , )D n n of two SVNHFEs 1n and 2n satisfies the following properties: 1. 1 20 ( , ) 1;D n n  2. 1 2( , ) 0D n n  if and only if 1 2;n n 3. 1 2 2 1( , ) ( , );D n n D n n 4. If 1 2 3n n n  , and 3n is an SVNHFE on X , then 1 2 1 3( , ) ( , )D n n D n n and 2 3 1 3( , ) ( , ).D n n D n n\n3. GRA method for multi-attribute decision making with SVNHFS information In this section, we propose GRA based approach to find out the best alternative in multiattribute decision making problem in SVNHFS environment. Assume that  1 2, ,..., mA A A A be the discrete set of m alternatives and  1 2, ,..., nC C C C be the set of n attributes for a multi-attribute decision making problem. Suppose that the rating values of the i  th alternative ( 1,2,..., )iA i m over\nthe attribute ( 1,2,..., )jC j n are expressed in terms of SVNHFSs , , ,ij ij ij ijx t i f where { | ,0 1},ij ij ij ij ijt t      { | ,0 1},ij ij ij ij iji i      and { | ,0 1}ij ij ij ij ijf f      are the possible truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership degrees, respectively. With these rating values, we can construct a decision matrix ( )ij m nX x  , where the entries of this matrix are SVNHFSs. The decision matrix can be presented as follows:\n11 12 1\n21 22 2\n1 2\n... ...\n...\nn\nn\nm m mn\nx x x x x x\nX\nx x x             \n(6)\nWe develop the GRA method using the following steps by considering the weight vector\n1 2( , ,..., ) T nW w w w of attributes where [0,1]jw  and 1 1. n jj w  \nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n59\nStep 1. Determine the single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy positive ideal solution (SVNHFPIS) A and\nthe single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy negative ideal solution (SVNHFNIS) A of alternatives in the decision matrix X by the following equations, respectively:\n \n1 21 1 1\n1 21 1 1\n1 2\nmax ( ),max ( ),...,max ( )for benefit typeattribute;\nmin ( ),min ( ),...,min ( ) for cost typeattribute\n, ,...,\ni i ini m i m i m\ni i ini m i m i m\ni i in\nx x x A\nx x x\nA A A\n     \n     \n  \n   \n\n(7)\n \n1 21 1 1\n1 21 1 1\n1 2\nmin ( ),min ( ),...,min ( )for benefit typeattribute;\nmax ( ),max ( ),...,max ( ) for cost typeattribute\n, ,...,\ni i ini m i m i m\ni i ini m i m i m\ni i in\nx x x A\nx x x\nA A A\n     \n     \n  \n   \n\n(8)\nThe rating values ijx can be compared by the score function ( )ijS x and accuracy function ( )ijA x defined in Definition 3.\nStep 2. Determine the grey relational co-efficient of each alternative from A and A by the following equations:\n1 1 1 1\n1 1\nmin min ( , ) max max ( , )\n( , ) max max ( , ) ij j ij ji m i m i m i m\nij ij j ij ji m i m\nD x A D x A\nD x A D x A  \n \n        \n \n   \n \n (9)\n1 1 1 1\n1 1\nmin min ( , ) max max ( , )\n( , ) max max ( , ) ij j ij ji m i m i m i m\nij ij j ij ji m i m\nD x A D x A\nD x A D x A  \n \n        \n \n   \n \n (10)\nwhere the identification co-efficient is considered as 0.5  .

A Numerical Example In this section we consider the example adopted from Ye [34] to illustrate the application of the proposed GRA method for MADM proposed in Section 4. Consider an investment company that wants to invest a sum of money in the best option. The following four possible alternatives are considered to invest the money:\n1. 1A is the car company; 2. 2A is the food company; 3. 3A is the computer company; 4. 4A is the arms company.\nThe investment company must take a decision according to the following three attributes:\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n60\n1. 1C is the risk analysis; 2. 2C is the growth analysis; 3. 3C is the environmental impact analysis.\nThe attribute weight vector is given as (0.35,0.25.0.40)TW  . The four possible alternatives 1 2 3 4{ , , , }A A A A are evaluated using SVNHFEs under three attributes ( 1,2,3).jC j  We can arrange the rating values in a matrix form called a SVNHF decision matrix 4 3( )ijX x  (see Table-1).\nTable 1.

Comparing the attribute values by score function and accuracy function of SVNHFEs, we can determine the neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy positive ideal solution (SVNHFPIS) A by the Eq.(7) as follows:\n                    \n1 2 3\n0.7,0.8 , 0.1 , 0.1,0.2 , 0.6,0.7 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.6,0.7 , 0.1,0.2 , 0.1,0.2\n, ,\nA\nA A A\n\n  \n   \n   \n(14)\nSimilarly, we can determine the neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy negative ideal solution (SVNHFPIS) A by the Eq.(8) as follows:\n                    \n1 2 3\n0.5,0.6 , 0.4 , 0.2,0.3 , 0.6 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.2,0.3 , 0.1,0.2 , 0.5,0.6\n, ,\nA\nA A A\n\n  \n   \n   \n(15)\nStep 2.

Therefore 4 2 3 1A A A A indicates that the most desirable alternative is 4.A We notice that the ranking order obtained by the proposed method is indifferent with the ranking\nof the alternative obtained by Ye’s method [34].\n5. Conclusions In general, the information of rating values considered in MADM problems is imprecise, indeterminate, incomplete and inconsistent in nature. SVNHFS is a useful tool that can capture all these type of information in MADM process. In this paper we investigate MADM problem in which rating values are considered with SVNHFSs. To extend the GRA method for MADM, we first define score value, accuracy value, certainty value, and normalised Hamming distance of SVNHFS. Having defined the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the negative ideal solution (NIS) by score value and accuracy value, we calculate the grey relational degree between each alternative and ideal alternatives (PIS and NIS). Then we determine a relative relational degree to obtain the ranking order of all alternatives by calculating the degree of grey relation to both the positive and negative ideal solution simultaneously. Finally, we provide an illustrative example to show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed approach is compared with other existing methods to show that our approach is straightforward and can be applied effectively with other decision making problems under SVNHF environment. In future, we will extend the proposed approach to MADM under SVNHFS environment with unknown weight information and MADM with interval valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy environment.\nReferences 1.

We define Hamming distance function and Euclidean distance function to determine the distance between bipolar neutrosophic numbers. In the decision making situation, the rating of performance values of the alternatives with respect to the attributes are provided by the decision maker in terms of bipolar neutrosophic numbers. The weights of the attributes are determined using maximizing deviation method. We define bipolar neutrosophic relative positive ideal solution (BNRPIS) and bipolar neutrosophic relative negative ideal solution (BNRNIS). Then, the ranking order of the alternatives is obtained by TOPSIS method and most desirable alternative is selected. Finally, a numerical example for car selection is solved to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach and comparison with other existing method is also provided.\nKeywords\nSingle valued neutrosophic sets; bipolar neutrosophic sets; TOPSIS; multi-attribute decision making.\n1. Introduction Zadeh [1] introduced the concept of fuzzy set to deal with problems with imprecise information in 1965. However, Zadeh [1] considers one single value to express the grade of membership of the fuzzy set defined in a universe. But, it is not always possible to represent the grade of membership value by a single point. In order to overcome the difficulty, Turksen [2] incorporated interval valued fuzzy sets. In 1986, Atanassov [3] extended the concept of fuzzy sets [1] and defined intuitionistic fuzzy sets which are characterized by grade of membership and non-membership functions. Later, Lee [4, 5] introduced the notion of bipolar fuzzy sets by extending the concept of fuzzy sets where the degree of membership is expanded from [0, 1] to [-1, 1]. In a bipolar fuzzy set, if the degree of membership is zero then we say the element is unrelated to the corresponding property, the membership degree (0, 1] of an element specifies that the element somewhat satisfies\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n66\nthe property, and the membership degree [−1, 0) of an element implies that the element somewhat satisfies the implicit counter-property [6]. Zhou and Li [7] incorporated the notion of bipolar fuzzy semirings and investigated relative properties using positive t- cut, negative s- cut and equivalence relation. Smarandache [8, 9, 10, 11] incorporated indeterminacy membership function as independent component and defined neutrosophic set on three components truth, indeterminacy and falsehood. However, from practical point of view, Wang et al. [12] defined single valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) where degree of truth membership, indeterminacy membership and falsity membership  [0, 1]. Deli et al. [13] introduced the notion of bipolar neutrosophic sets (BNSs) which is a generalization of the fuzzy sets, bipolar fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets. Pramanik and Mondal defined rough bipolar neutrosophic set [14].\nZhang and Wu [15] presented a TOPSIS [16] method for solving single valued neutrosophic multi-criteria decision making with incomplete weight information. Chi and Liu [17] proposed an extended TOPSIS method for MADM problems where the attribute weights are unknown and the attribute values are expressed in terms of interval neutrosophic numbers. Biswas et al. [18] developed a new TOPSIS based approach for solving multi-attribute group decision making problem with simplified neutrosophic information. Broumi et al. [19] extended TOPSIS method for multiple attribute decision making based on interval neutrosophic uncertain linguistic variables. In neutrosophic hybrid environment, Pramanik et al. [20] extended TOPSIS method for singled valued soft expert set based multi-attribute decision making problems. Dey et al. [21] presented TOPSIS method for generalized neutrosophic soft multi-attribute group decision making. Mondal et al. [22] presented TOPSIS in rough neutrosophic environment and provided illustrative example.\nDeli et al. [13] investigated a bipolar neutrosophic multi-criteria decision making approach based on bipolar neutrosophic weighted average and geometric operators and the score, certainty and accuracy functions. Uluçay et al. [23] studied similarity measures of bipolar neutrosophic sets and their application to multiple criteria decision making. Literature review suggests that TOPSIS method in bipolar neutrosophic environment is yet to appear. Therefore this issue needs to be addressed.\nIn this paper, we define Hamming distances and Euclidean distances between two BNSs and develop a new TOPSIS based method for solving MADM problems under bipolar neutrosophic assessments.\nThe content of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some basic definitions concerning neutrosophic sets, SVNSs, BNSs which are helpful for the construction of the paper. Hamming and Euclidean distances between two bipolar neutrosophic numbers (BNNs) are also defined in the Section 2. Section 3 is devoted to present TOPSIS method for MADM problems under bipolar neutrosophic environment. A car selection problem is solved in Section 4 to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. Sectin 5 presents conclusion.\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this Section, we provide basic definitions regarding neutrosophic sets, SVNSs, BNSs.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n67\n2.1 Neutrosophic Sets [8, 9, 10, 11]\nConsider U be a space of objects with a generic element of U denoted by x. Then, a neutrosophic set N on U is defined as follows:\nN = {x, )(F),(I),(T xxx NNN  xU}\nwhere, )(T xN , )(I xN , )(F xN : U ]-0, 1+[ represent respectively the degrees of truthmembership, indeterminacy-membership, and falsity-membership of a point xU to the set N with the condition -0  )(T xN + )(I xN + )(F xN  3+. 2.2 Single valued neutrosophic Sets [12]\nLet U be a universal space of points with a generic element of X denoted by x, then a SVNS S is presented as follows:\nS = {x, )(F),(I),(T xxx SSS  xU}\nwhere, )(T xS , )(I xS , )(F xS : U  [0, 1] and 0  )(T xS + )(I xS + )(F xS  3 for each point x U. 2.3 Bipolar Neutrosophic Set [13]\nDefinition 1. Let U be a universal space of points, then a BNS B in U is defined as follows\nB = {x, )(F ),(I ),(T),(F),(I),(T xxxxxx BBBBBB   x U},\nwhere )(T xB  , )(I xB  , )(F xB  : U  [0, 1] and )(T xB  , )(I xB  , )(F xB  : U  [-1, 0].\nThe positive membership degrees )(T xB  , )(I xB  , and )(F xB  represent the truth membership, indeterminate membership, and false membership of an element x U corresponding to a bipolar neutrosophic set B and the negative membership degrees )(T xB  , )(I xB  , and )(F xB\n represent the truth membership, indeterminate membership, and false membership of an element x U to some implicit counter property corresponding to a bipolar neutrosophic set B. For convenience, a bipolar neutrosophic number is represented by b~ = <  BT ,  BI ,  BF ,  BT ,  BI , \nBF >. Example: Consider U = {u1, u2, u3, u4}.

The distance between two BNNs\nIn this sub-section, we propose the distance between two BNNs.\nConsider 1B =  m 1i (xi, < 1TB (xi),  1 I B (xi),  1 FB (xi),  1 TB (xi),  1 I B (xi),  1 FB (xi)>) , 2B =  m 1i (xi, < 2TB (xi),  2 I B\n(xi), 2FB (xi),  2 TB (xi),  2 I B (xi),  2 FB (xi)>) be two BNNs then,\n(1). The Hamming distance between two BNNs is defined as follows:\nDH ( 1B , 2B ) =  m 1i {|(  1 TB (xi) -  2 TB (xi))| + |(  1 I B (xi) -  2 I B (xi))| + |(  1 FB (xi) -  2 FB (xi))| + |(  1 TB (xi) 2 TB (xi))|\n+ |(  1 I B (xi) -  2 I B (xi))| + |(  1 FB (xi) -  2 FB (xi))|} (1)\n(2).

TOPSIS method for MADM with bipolar neutrosophic information\nIn this Section, we present an approach based on TOPSIS method to deal with MADM problems under bipolar neutrosophic environment.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n70\nLet A = {A1, A2, …, Am}, (m  2) be a discrete set of m feasible alternatives, C = {C1, C2, …, Cn}, (n  2) be a set of attributes under consideration and w = (w1, w2, …, wn)T be the unknown\nweight vector of the attributes with 0wj1 and  \nn\n1j j w = 1. The rating of performance value of\nalternative Ai, (i = 1, 2, …, m) with respect to the predefined attribute Cj, (j = 1, 2, …, n) is presented by the decision maker (DM) and they can be expressed by BNNs. Therefore, the proposed approach is presented using the following steps:\nStep 1. Construction of decision matrix with BNNs The rating of performance value of alternative Ai (i = 1, 2, …, m) with respect to the attribute Cj, (j = 1, 2, …, n) is expressed by BNNs and they can be presented in the decision matrix as follows:\nnmij r~  =\n      \n\n      \n\nmnm2m1\n2n2221\n1n1211 r...rr ...... ...... r...rr r...rr\nHere, we have rij = ( ijT ,  ijI ,  ijF ,  ijT ,  ijI ,  ijF ) with  ijT ,  ijI ,  ijF , -  ijT , -  ijI , -  ijF [0, 1] and 0  ijT + \nijI +  ijF -  ijT -  ijI -  ijF 6 for i = 1, 2, …, m; j = 1, 2, …, n.\nStep 2. Determination of weights of the attributes We assume that the weights of the attributes are not equal and they are fully unknown to the DM. Therefore, in this paper, maximizing deviation method [24] is used to find the unknown weights. The main idea of maximizing deviation method can be expressed as follows. If the attribute values rij (j = 1, 2, …, n) in the attribute Cj have small differences between the alternatives, then Cj has a small significance in ranking of all alternatives and a small weight is assigned for the attribute. If the attribute values rij (j = 1, 2, …, n) in the attribute Cj are same, then Cj has no effect in the ranking results and zero is assigned to the weight of the attribute. However, if the attribute values rij (j = 1, 2, …, n) over the attribute Cj have big differences, then Cj will play a key role in ranking of all alternatives and we will allocate a big weight for the attribute. The deviation values of alternative Ai (i = 1, 2, …, m) to all other alternatives under the attribute Cj (j = 1, 2, …, n) can\nbe defined as Zij (wj) = jkj m\n1k ij )wr,(rz  , then Zj (wj) = j\nm 1i ij wZ  = jkj\nm\n1i\nm\n1k ij )wr,(rz    presents the total\ndeviation values of all alternatives to the other alternatives for the attribute Cj (j = 1, 2, …, n).

Identify the bipolar neutrosophic relative positive ideal solution (BNRPIS) and bipolar neutrosophic relative negative ideal solution (BNRNIS)\nIn real life decision making, we confront two types of attributes namely, benefit type attributes ( 1β ) and cost type attributes ( 2β ). In bipolar neutrosophic environment, assume that w BNRPISQ and\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n72\nw BNRNISQ be the bipolar neutrosophic relative positive ideal solution (BNRPIS) and bipolar neutrosophic relative negative ideal solution (BNRNIS).

Step 7. Rank the alternatives Rank the alternatives according to the descending order of the alternatives and select the best\nalternative with maximum value of *icc . 4. A numerical example\nWe consider the problem [13] where a customer wants to buy a car. There are four types cars (alternatives) Ai, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 are available. The customer considers four attributes namely Fuel economy (C1), Aerod (C2), Comfort (C3), Safety C4 to assess the alternatives. Now we solve the problem with bipolar neutrosophic information based on TOPSIS method to select most desirable car for the customer. Then, the proposed TOPSIS approach for solving the problem is presented in the following steps:\nStep 1: Formulation of decision matrix We construct the decision matrix with bipolar neutrosophic information presented by the DM\nas given below (see Table 1).\nTable 1.

Distance measures of each alternative from the BNRPISs and BNRNISs\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n75\nThe normalized Euclidean distances of each alternative from the BNRPISs are computed as follows:\n1 NEuc = 0.0479, 2 NEuc = 0.0161, 3 NEuc = 0.013, 4 NEuc = 0.0469.\nSimilarly, the normalized Euclidean distances of each alternative from the BNRNISs are computed as follows:\n1 NEuc = 0.0123, 2 NEuc = 0.0247, 3 NEuc = 0.0548, 4 NEuc = 0.0192.\nStep 6.

[13] consider the weight vector of the attributes as w = ( 2 1 , 4 1 , 8 1 , 8 1 ) for\ncar selection. However, if we take weight vector of the attributes as w = ( 2 1 , 4 1 , 8 1 , 8 1 ), then relative closeness co-efficient *icc , (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are computed as given below. * 1cc = 0.3746, * 2cc = 0.5761, *3cc = 0.4716, * 4cc = 0.6944.\nTherefore, the ranking order of the cars can be represented as follows:\nA4  A2  A3  A1 So, A4 would be the most suitable alternative.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present a TOPSIS method for solving MADM problem with bipolar neutrosophic information. We define Hamming distance function and Euclidean distance function to determine the distance between BNNs. In the decision making situation, the rating of performance values of the alternatives with respect to the attributes are provided by the DM in terms of BNNs. The weights of the attributes are obtained by maximizing deviation method and we construct the weighted decision matrix. We also define BNRPIS and BNRNIS. Euclidean distance measure is employed to compute the distances of each alternative from BNRPISs as well as BNRNISs. Relative closeness coefficients are calculated to rank the alternative and to obtain the best alternative. Finally, the proposed method is applied to solve a car selection problem to verify the applicability of the proposed method and comparison with other existing method is also provided.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n76\nReferences 1.

The weights of each decision makers are considered as a single valued neutrosophic numbers. The attribute weights for every decision maker are also considered as a neutrosophic numbers. Aggregation operator is used to combine all decision makers’ opinion into a single opinion for rating between attributes and alternatives. Euclidean distances from positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution are calculated to construct relative closeness coefficients. Lastly, an illustrative example of tablet selection is provided to show the applicability of the proposed TOPSIS approach.\nKeywords Neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic set, neutrosophic refined set, TOPSIS, aggregation operator.\n1. Introduction Decision making in neutrosophic environment is a developing area of research. Florentin Smarandache [1] introduced neutrosophic set which is the generalization of fuzzy set (FS) introduced by L.A. Zadeh [2] and intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) proposed by K. T. Atanassov [3]. Florentin Smarandache and his colleagues [4] presented an instance of single valued neutrosophic set called single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) and their set theoretic operations. FS only considers membership function to represent imprecise data. IFS is characterized by membership and non-membership degrees, which are independent but the sum of degrees of membership and non-membership is less than unity. Both FS and IFS are unable to deal with indeterminacy in real decision making problem. Indeterminacy plays an important role in decision making situation. For example, in an application form there are three options ‘YES / NO/ N. A.’ for gender M / F / Others. So, different kinds of uncertainty and vagueness with indeterminacy cannot be explained by the\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n80\nfuzzy concept or intuitionistic fuzzy concept. Florentin Smarandache [1] first focused on indeterminacy of the imprecise data and introduced the concept of neutrosophic set consisting of three membership functions namely truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership functions which are independent.\nHawang and Yoon [5] introduced a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). TOPSIS for multi criteria decision making (MCDM) problem in fuzzy environment has been proposed by Chen [6]. Boran et al. [7] applied TOPSIS approach to multi attribute group decision making (MAGDM) in intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Multicriteria decision - making method using the correlation coefficient under single valued neutrosophic environment has been proposed by Ye [8]. Ye [9] further established single valued neutrosophic cross entropy for MCDM. Biswas et al. [10] presented entropy based grey relational analysis method for multiattribute decision - making under single valued neutrosophic assessments. Biswas et al. [11] proposed MCDM with unknown weight information. Pramanik et al. [12] developed hybrid vector similarity measures and their applications to multi-attribute decision making under neutrosophic environment. Zhang et al. [13] presented interval neutrosophic MCDM. Pramanik and Mondal [14] presented interval neutrosophic multi-attribute decision-making based on grey relational analysis. Ye [15] applied aggregation operator for MCDM problem for simplified neutrosophic sets. Some important approaches in neutrosophic decision making problems can be found in [16- 32]. Biswas et al. [33] proposed TOPSIS method for MAGDM for under single valued neutrosophic environment. Chai and Liu [34] applied TOPSIS method for MCDM with interval neutrosophic set. Broumi et al. [35] presented extended TOPSIS method for multiple attribute decision making based on interval neutrosophic uncertain linguistic variables. In neutrosophic hybrid environment, Pramanik et al. [36] presented TOPSIS for singled valued soft expert set based multi-attribute decision making problems. Dey et al. [37] studied generalized neutrosophic soft multi-attribute group decision making based on TOPSIS. Dey et al. [38] proposed TOPSIS for solving multi-attribute decision making problems under bi-polar neutrosophic environment. Mondal et al. [39] presented TOPSIS in rough neutrosophic environment and provided an illustrative example.\nYager [40] introduced the concept of multiset in 1986. Sebastian and Ramakrishnan [41] developed the concept of multi fuzzy set and studied some of their properties. Shinoj and John [42] presented intuitionistic fuzzy multiset. Ye and Ye [43] presented Dice similarity measure between single valued neutrosophic multisets and its application in medical diagnosis Smarandache [44] proposed n- valued refined neutrosophic logic and its application. Broumi and Smarandache [45] defined neutrosophic refined similarity measure based on cosine function. Mondal and Pramanik [46] proposed neutrosophic refined similarity measure using tangent function and applied it to multi attribute decision making. Mondal and Pramanik [47] also defined neutrosophic refined similarity measure and its application based on cotangent function. Pramanik et al. [48] recently presented MCGDM in neutrosophic refined environment and its application in teacher selection. Nadaban and Dzitac [49] discussed the general view in neutrosophic TOPSIS and presented a very brief survey on the applications of neutrosophic sets in MCDM problems.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n81\nThe present paper is devoted to extend TOPSIS approach for MAGDM in refined neutrosophic environment. An aggregation operator due to Jun Ye [15] is used in refined neutrosophic environment. The relative closeness coefficients for all attributes are calculated and the alternative with least value of relative closeness coefficient is selected as the best alternative.\nThe rest of the paper has been framed as follows: In section 2, we recall some relevant definitions and properties. General TOPSIS approach is discussed in section 3. TOPSIS for MAGDM is stepwise proposed in section 4. A numerical example is described and solved in section 5. Section 6 presents conclusions and future scope of research.\n2. Some well established definitions and properties In this section, we recall some established definitions and properties which are connected in the present article. 2.1.Neutrosophic set (NS)[1]\nLet Y be a space of points (objects) with generic element y in Y. A neutrosophic set A in Y is denoted by\nA= {<y: TA(y), IA(y), FA(y)>: Yy } where AT , AI , AF represent membership, indeterminacy and non-membership function respectively. AT , AI , AF are defined as follows:\nAT : Y →]  0, 1+ [\nAI : Y →]  0, 1+ [\nAF : Y →]  0, 1+ [\nHere, TA(y), IA(y), FA(y) are the real standard or non-standard subset of]  0, 1+ [ and  0≤ TA(y)+IA(y)+FA(y) ≤ 3+ 2.2. Single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) [4]\nLet Y be a space of points with generic element in yY. A single valued neutrosophic set A in Y is characterized by a truth-membership function TA(y), an indeterminacy-membership function IA (y) and a falsity-membership function FA(y), for each point y in Y, TA(y), IA (y), FA(y)[0, 1], when Y is continuous then single-valued neutrosophic set A can be written as\nA =   A AAA Yy,y/)y(F),y(I),y(T\nWhen A is discrete, single-valued neutrosophic set can be written as    n 1i iiiAiAiA Yy,y/)y(F),y(I),y(T\n2.3. Complement of neutrosophic set [1] The complement of a neutrosophic set A is denoted by Aand defined as A= {<y: TA(y), IA(y), FA(y)>, Yy } TA(y) ={1+} - TA(y) IA(y) =1+} - IA(y) FA(y) ={1+} - FA(y)\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n82\n2.4 Properties Let A and B be two SVNSs, then the following properties [1] hold good: Xx,)x(F.)x(F),x(I).x(I),x(T).x(T)x(T)x(TBA.1 BABABABA  Xx,)x(F.)x(F)x(F)x(F),x(I)..x(I)x(I).x(I),x(T).x(TBA.2 BABABABABA   ))x(F),x(Fmin()),x(I),x(Imin()),x(T),x(Tmax(BA.3 BABABA  ))x(F),x(Fmax()),x(I),x(Imax()),x(T),x(Tmin(BA.4 BABABA 2.5 Euclidean distance between two SVNSs [50] Let  n,...,2,1i,)x(F),x(I),x(T:xA iAiAiAi  , and  n...,,2,1i,)x(F),x(I),x(T:xB iBiBiBi  be\nSVNSs.

Also, m is called the dimension of neutrosophic refined sets A.\n2.7 Crispfication of a Neutrosophic set [33]\nLet  n,...,2,1j,)x(F),x(I),x(T:xA ijAijAijAij  be n SVNSs.

TOPSIS approach TOPSIS approach is employed to identify the best alternative based on the concept of compromise solution. The best compromise solution reflects the shortest Euclidean distance from the positive ideal solution and the farthest Euclidean distance from the negative ideal solution.

TOPSIS approach for MAGDM with neutrosophic refined set A systematic approach to extend the TOPSIS to the refined neutrosophic environment has been proposed in this section. This method is very suitable for solving the group decision-making problem under the refined neutrosophic environment.\nStep 1: Let us consider a group of r decision makers (D1, D2…,Dr) and q attributes (C1, C2…,Cq).

Thus each DM would have different opinion regarding the weights of attribute. For grouped opinion, all DMs’ opinions need to be aggregated by the aggregation operator for a particular attribute. The weight matrix (see Table 3) can be written as follows:\n(14)\nHere  ijijijij F,I,Tw The aggregated weight [15] for the attribute Cj is defined as follows:\n     jjj\nr\n1i ij\nr\n1i ij\nr\n1i ijj F,I,TF,I,Tw q...,,2,1j (15)\nStep 5 Construction of aggregated weighted decision matrix The aggregated weighted neutrosophic decision matrix (see Table 4) can be formed as:\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n86\n kjkjkjjjjkjj F ~,I~,T~F,I,Td ~ wor  jkjjkjjkjjkjjkjj F~.FF~F,I~.II~I,T~.T  wkjwkjwkj F,I,T qpwkj )d(  (18) .q...,,2,1jandp...,,2,1kwhere  Step 6 Relative positive ideal solution (RPIS) and relative negative ideal solution (RNIS) In this step, we find out relative positive ideal solution (RPIS) )S( N and the relative negative ideal solution (RNIS) )S( N for the above aggregated neutrosophic decision matrix.

Smarandache, M. Dhar, Rough neutrosophic sets, Italian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 32 (2014), 493-502.) introduced the notion of rough neutrosophic set by combining neutrosophic sets and rough sets, which has been a mathematical tool to deal with problems involving indeterminacy and incompleteness. The real world is full of indeterminacy. Naturally, real world decision making problem involves indeterminacy. Rough neutrosophic set is capable of describing and handling imprecise, indeterminate and inconsistent and incomplete information. This paper is devoted to propose several new similarity measures based on trigonometric hamming similarity operators of rough neutrosophic sets and their applications in decision making. We prove the required properties of the proposed similarity measures. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed similarity measures in decision making, an illustrative problem is solved.\nKeywords Neutrosophic set, rough set, rough neutrosophic set, Hamming distance, similarity measure.\n1. Introduction L. A. Zadeh [1] introduced the degree of membership in 1965 and defined the concept of fuzzy set to deal with uncertainty. K. T. Atanassov [2] introduced the degree of non-membership as independent component in 1986 and defined the intuitionistic fuzzy set. F. Smarandache [3, 4] introduced the degree of indeterminacy as independent component and defined the neutrosophic set in 1998.\nTo use the concept of neutrosophic set in practical fields such as real scientific and engineering applications, Wang et al. [5] presented an instance of neutrosophic set, called single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS).\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n94\nIn many applications, due to lack of knowledge or data about the problem domains, the decision information may be provided with intervals, instead of real numbers. To deal with the situation Wang et al. [6] introduced interval valued neutrosophic sets (IVNS), which is characterized by a membership function, non-membership function and an indeterminacy function, whose values are intervals rather than real numbers. Also, the interval valued neutrosophic set can represent uncertain, imprecise, incomplete and inconsistent information which exist in the real world.\nIn 2014, Broumi et al. [7, 8] introduced the concept of rough neutrosophic set (RNS). It is derived by hybridizing the concepts of rough set proposed by Pawlak [9] and neutrosophic set originated by F. Smarandache [3, 4]. Neutrosophic sets and rough sets are both capable of dealing with uncertainty and partial information. Rough neutrosophic set [7, 8] is the generalization of rough fuzzy sets [10], [11] and rough intuitionistic fuzzy sets [12].\nMondal and Pramanik [13] applied the concept of rough neutrosophic set in multi-attribute decision making based on grey relational analysis in 2015. S. Pramanik and K. Mondal [14] also studied cosine similarity measure of rough neutrosophic sets and its application in medical diagnosis in 2015. Mondal and Pramanik [15] proposed multi attribute decision making using rough accuracy score function. Pramanik and Mondal [16] proposed cotangent similarity measure under rough neutrosophic environment. Pramanik and Mondal [17] further proposed some similarity measures namely Dice similarity measure and Jaccard similarity measure in rough neutrosophic environment. Mondal et al. [18] proposed rough neutrosophic variational coefficient similarity measure and presented its application in multi attribute decision making. Mondal et al. [19] presented rough neutrosophic TOPSIS for multi-attribute group decision making problem. Mondal and Pramanik [20] studied tri-complex rough neutrosophic similarity measure and its application in multi-attribute decision making. Mondal et al. [21] further proposed rough neutrosophic hyper-complex set and its application to multi-attribute decision making.\nLiterature review reflects that no studies have been made on multi-attribute decision making using trigonometric Hamming similarity measures under rough neutrosophic environment. In this paper, we propose cosine, sine and cotangent Hamming similarity measures under rough neutrosophic environment. We also present a numerical example to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed similarity measures.\n2. Mathematical Preliminaries\n2.1 Neutrosophic set [3, 4] Let U be a universe of discourse. Then the neutrosophic set A is presented in the form: A = {< x: TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)>, x  U}, where the functions T, I, F: U→]−0,1+[ represent respectively the degree of membership, the degree of indeterminacy, and the degree of nonmembership of the element xU to the set P satisfying the following the condition.\n−0≤ supTA(x)+ supIA(x)+ supFA(x) ≤ 3+ 2.2 Single valued neutrosophic sets [6]\nDefinition 2.2 [6] Wang et al. [6] mentioned that the neutrosophic set assumes the value from real standard or non-standard subsets of ]−0, 1+[. So instead of ]−0, 1+[ Wang et al. [6] consider the interval [0, 1]\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n95\nfor technical applications, because ]−0, 1+[ is difficult to apply in the real applications such as scientific and engineering problems.\nAssume that X be a space of points (objects) with generic elements in X denoted by x. A SVNS A in X is characterized by a truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy-membership function IA(x), and a falsity membership function FA(x), for each point x in X, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) [0, 1]. When X is continuous, a SVNS A can be written as follows:\nXx x xFxIxTA x AAA ∈:)(),(),(   When X is discrete, a SVNS A can be written as follows:\nXxx xFxIxTA i n i\ni\niAiAiA ∈:∑ )(),(),(1   .\nFor two SVNSs, ASVNS = {<x: TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)> | x X} and BSVNS = {<x, TB(x), IB(x), FB(x)> | xX }, ASVNS BSVNS and ASVNS = BSVNS are defined as follows:\n(1) ASVNS  BSVNS if and only if TA(x)  TB(x), IA(x)  IB(x), FA(x )  FB( x) (2) ASVNS = BSVNS if and only if TA(x) = TB(x), IA(x) = IB(x), FA(x) = FB(x) for any xX\n2.3 Hamming distance [17] Hamming distance [17] between two neutrosophic sets  )(),(),( xFxIxTA AAA and  )(),(),( xFxIxTB BBB is defined as\n  ))x(F)x(F)x(I)x(I)x(T)x(T( 2 1B,AH BAn 1i BABA   \n 1\n2.4 Rough neutrosophic set (RNS) Definition 2.2.1 [1], [2]: Let Z be a non-null set and R be an equivalence relation on Z.

Here  and  denote “max” and “min’’ operators respectively.  zT A ,  zI A and  zF A are the\nmembership, indeterminacy and non-membership degrees of z with respect to A.  AN and  AN are two neutrosophic sets in Z.\nThus, NS mappings ,N N : N(Z) N(Z) denote respectively the lower and upper rough NS approximation operators, and the pair ))(),(( ANAN is called the rough neutrosophic set in (Z, R).\nBased on the above mentioned definition, it is observed that )(AN and )(AN have constant membership on the equivalence class of R, if );()( ANAN  i.e. ),()( )()( xTxT ANAN \n),()( )()( xIxI ANAN  xF AN )()( )()( xF AN .\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n96\nFor any x belongs to Z, P is said to be a definable neutrosophic set in the approximation (Z, R). Obviously, zero neutrosophic set (0N) and unit neutrosophic sets (1N) are definable neutrosophic sets.\nDefinition 2.2.2 [1], [2]: Let N(A) = ( )(),( ANAN ) is a rough neutrosophic set in (Z, R).

Decision making under trigonometric rough neutrosophic Hamming similarity measures\nIn this section, we apply rough cosine, sine and cotangent Hamming similarity measures between RNSs to the multi-criteria decision making problem. Assume that S = {S1, S2, … , Sm }be a set of alternatives and A ={ A1, A2, … , A\uD835\uDC5B }be a set of attributes.\nThe proposed decision making method is described using the following steps. Step 1: Construction of the decision matrix with rough neutrosophic number Decision maker considers the decision matrix with respect to m alternatives and n attributes in\nterms of rough neutrosophic numbers as follows. Table1: Rough neutrosophic decision matrix\n nmijij ddD ,\nmnmnmmmmm\nnn\nnn\nn\nddddddS\nddddddS\nddddddS AAA\n,...,, ............. ............. ,...,,\n,...,,\n2211\n22222221212\n11121211111\n21 \n(6)\nHere ijij dd , is the rough neutrosophic number according to the i-th alternative and the j-th attribute.\nStep 2: Determination of the weights of attribute Assume that the weight of the attributes Aj (\uD835\uDC57 = 1, 2, … , \uD835\uDC5B) considered by the decision-maker be wj ((\uD835\uDC57 = 1, 2, … , \uD835\uDC5B)) such that ∀ wj ∈ [0, 1] (j = 1, 2, …, n) and 1wn 1j j   . Step 3: Determination of the benefit type attribute and cost type attribute Generally, the evaluation attribute can be categorized into two types: benefit type attribute and cost type attribute. Let K be a set of benefit type attributes and M be a set of cost type attributes. In the proposed decision-making method, an ideal alternative can be identified by using a maximum operator for the benefit type attribute and a minimum operator for the cost type attribute to determine the best value of each criterion among all alternatives. We define an ideal alternative S* as follows:\nS* = {S1*, S2*, … , Sm*}, where benefit attribute is presented as  )()()(* min,min,max SiA ji Si A ji Si A ji j FITS  and cost type attribute is presented as  )()()(* max,max,min SiA ji Si A ji Si A ji j FITS  .\nStep 4: Determination of the overall weighted rough trigonometric neutrosophic Hamming similarity function (WRTNHSF) of the alternatives\nWe define weighted rough trigonometric neutrosophic similarity function as follows.

Step 5: Ranking the alternatives Using the weighted rough trigonometric neutrosophic similarity measure between each alternative and the ideal alternative, the ranking order of all alternatives can be determined and the best alternative can be selected with the highest similarity value. Step 6: End\n7. Numerical Example Assume that a decision maker intends to select the most suitable smart phone for rough use from the three initially chosen smart phones (S1, S2, S3) by considering four attributes namely: features A1, reasonable price A2, customer care A3, risk factor A4. Based on the proposed approach discussed in section 5, the considered problem is solved using the following steps:\nStep 1: Construction of the decision matrix with rough neutrosophic numbers The decision maker forms a decision matrix with respect to three alternatives and four attributes\nin terms of rough neutrosophic numbers (see the Table 2).

CWCHSO(S1, S*) = 0.99554, CWCHSO(S2, S*) = 0.99253, CWCHSO(S3, S*) = 0.99799 SWCHSO(S1, S*) = 0.89455, SWCHSO(S2, S*) = 0.89233, SWCHSO(S3, S*) = 0.91729 COTWCHSO(S1, S*) = 0.92114, COTWCHSO(S2, S*) = 0.90322, COTWCHSO(S3, S*) = 0.93009 Step 5: Ranking the alternatives Ranking the alternatives is prepared based on the descending order of similarity measures. Highest value reflects the best alternative.\nHere, CWCHSO(S3, S*)  CWCHSO(S1, S*)  CWCHSO(S2, S*) SWCHSO(S3, S*)  SWCHSO(S1, S*)  SWCHSO(S2, S*) COTWCHSO(S3, S*)  COTWCHSO(S1, S*)  COTWCHSO(S2, S*)\nHence, the smartphone S3 is the best alternative for rough use.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n102\nStep 6: End 7.1 Comparison All the three similarity measures provided the same ranking order.\n8. Conclusion In this paper, we propose rough trigonometric Hamming similarity measures based multi-attribute decision making of rough neutrosophic environment and prove some of their basic properties. We provide an application, namely selection of the most suitable smart phone for rough use. We also present comparison with the three rough neutrosophic similarity measures. The concept presented in this paper can be applied other multiple attribute decision making problems in rough neutrosophic environment.\nReferences 1. L. A.

The objective of the research paper is to implement and validate multi attribute selection of automated guided vehicle for material handling purpose. The present paper proposes a single valued neutrosophic set with entropy weight based multi attribute decision making technique. A proposed technique also works with more uncertainty, imprecise, indeterminate and inconsistent information. The proposed methodology follows with the example for selection and ranking of automated guided vehicle and in validation and sensitivity analysis of the novel multi attribute decision making technique carried out. The result of the study builds assurance in suitability of single valued neutrosophic set entropy based novel multi attribute decision making for selection of automated guided vehicle alternatives.\nKeywords Multi attribute decision making, single valued neutrosophic set, material handling equipment, automated guided vehicle.\n1. Introduction Material Handling Equipment (MHE) is playing a vital role in today’s manufacturing system and also improving productivity in the small, medium or large scale manufacturing industries. MHE is a very essential task for the manufacturing sectors because of the considerable capital investment required(Onut, Kara, & Mert, 2009). Saputro et al. (2015)) reviewed 42 papers for MHE selection and established ranking to appropriate MHE for complex selection problems. Right MHE selection and good design of the MHE can increase productivity and reduce investment and operation’s costs.\nKarande & Chakraborty (2013) investigated the various functions performed by MHE are as follows:\na. Transportation and logistics (for moving material form one point to another, i.e. conveyors, cranes, industrial trucks, etc.) b. Positioning (for aid machining operation like, robots, index tables, rotary tables, etc.)\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n106\nc. Unit formation (for holding or carrying purpose pallets, skids, containers, bins, etc.) d. Storage (For store/ inventory automatic storage and retrieval system (AS/RS), pallets, etc.).\nOn the real difficulties in developing and using selection methods is due to the natural vagueness associated with the inputs to the model (Deb, Bhattacharyya, & Sorkhel, 2002).\n2. Literature Survey Literature survey is carried out with two elements one for selection methodology for MHE using multi attribute decision making (MADM) and the other for literature on single valued neutrosophic set theory. 1.1 Literature survey of selection methodology used for selection of MHE using MADM\ntechniques Since last three decades researchers pay more attention in finding and implementing different MADM techniques with different criteria (attributes). Onut et al. ( 2009) implemented fuzzy Analytic Network Process (ANP) for assigning weights to the attributes for MHE selection and fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to ranking solution. Maniya & Bhatt (2011) implemented and validated modified grey relational analysis (M-GRA) method combined with AHP for multi attribute selection of Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) for the material handling. Sawant et al.(2011) worked on Preference Selection Index (PSI) method for AGV selection in manufacturing environment. Chakraborty & Banik (2006) worked on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for material handling equipment selection model. Kulak (2005) investigated a fuzzy multi attribute selection of material handling equipment which consist of a database, rule based system and multi attribute fuzzy information axiom approach for selecting MHE. Nguyen et al. (2016) worked for fuzzy AHP and fuzzy additive ratio assessment for conveyor evaluation ranking and selection process. Mirhosseyni & Webb, (2009) presents fuzzy knowledge based expert system and then genetic algorithm (GA) for efficient selection and assignment of MHE. Eko Saputro & Daneshvar Rouyendegh (2016) investigated a hybrid approach for selecting MHE in a ware house by using entropy based hierarchical fuzzy TOPSIS and Multi Objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MOMILP) for ranking and selecting best alternatives. Anand et al. (2011) investigated MHE selection with ANP for complex decision making problem. Biswas et al. (2016) proposed TOPSIS approach to SVNS and applied the approach for multi attribute group decision making problem. 1.2 Literature survey of single valued neutrosophic set\nIn classical MADM approach, input variables are crisp sets but in the real world decision problem input variables are expressed in terms of qualitative information. Qualitative information provided by decision makers (DMs)/experts can be easily expressed by linguistic variables.\nSometimes due to lack of time-pressure, limited knowledge about public domain, decision maker may prefer linguistic variables (Zadeh (1975)) to deal with imprecise data. To cover up the limitation of fuzzy set, Atanassov (1986) proposed the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) by adding truth membership Ta (x) and falsity Membership Fa (x). Further Atanassov (1986) proposed the Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IVIFS). However, drawback of IFS and IVIFS is that they cannot handle indeterminate and inconsistent information. In real application, information of input data is often incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent ( Chi & Liu (2013)). The limitation of above sets is covered up with Neutrosophic Set (NS) (Smarandache (2002)) with degree of truth, indeterminacy and falsity, where all membership function is completely independent. Single Valued Neutrosophic Set (SVNS) is an instance of NS, which can handle uncertainty, imprecise, indeterminate and inconsistent information (Wang et al. (2010). Majumdar (2015) established\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n107\nuncertain data processing with NS and further generalized and combined with soft sets in decision making process. Ye (2013) worked on correlation and correlation coefficient of SVNS based on the extension of the correlation of IFS. Ye (2014a) worked on single valued neutrosophic crossentropy for MADM techniques. Zhang et al. (2014) applied interval neutrosophic set applied to multi criteria decision making for investment problem. Biswas et al. (2014) presented neutrosophic MADM with unknown weight information methodology. Pramanik et al. (2015) presented hybrid vector similarity measures and their applications to multi-attribute decision making under neutrosophic environment. Ye (2014b) worked on vector similarity measures of simplified NS with investigating money case study.\n3. SVNS Entropy based MADM Methodology Steps of SNVS entropy based novel MADM as follows. Step 1: Define the goal of MADM problem such as ranking/ evaluation/ sorting/ selection of various alternatives involved in decision making procedure. Step 2: Identify the possible alternative with attributes (criteria’s). Step 3: Prepare the decision matrix.\nLet, \uD835\uDC34 = {\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5F \uD835\uDC56 = 1, 2, 3, …… . . \uD835\uDC5A} be a set of alternative while, \uD835\uDC36 = {\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5F \uD835\uDC57 = 1, 2, 3, …… . . \uD835\uDC5B} be a set of attributes (criteria). The different values of criteria’s may be quantitative and/or qualitative in nature. Step 4: Convert qualitative information into fuzzy numbers. Normalization of matrix is shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Matrix Normalization Techniques\nName of Normalization Methods Normalized Value\nBenefit Values Non- Beneficial Values\nLinear Scale Transformation, Max Method (LSTMM)\nLinear Scale Transformation, Max-Min Method (LSTMMM)\nLinear Scale Transformation Sum Method (LSTSM)\nVector Normalization Method (VNM)\nStep 5: Conversion classic set/ fuzzy set to SVNS\niMaxX ijX ijR  ijX iMinX ijR \nijij\nijij ij MinXMaxX\nMinXX R\n\n \nijij\nijij ij MinXMaxX\nXMaxX R\n\n \n \n m\ni i\nij ij\nX\nX R\n1  \n m\ni i\nij ij\nX\nX R\n1\n1\n \n m\ni ij\nij ij\nX\nX R\n1\n2  \n m\ni ij\nij ij\nX\nX R\n1\n2\n1\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n108\nTo validate proposed MADM method with other MADM techniques, we propose the conversion rule to use the input matrix in classic or fuzzy set to SVNS for beneficial and nonbeneficial criteria. (i) Beneficial criteria: (higher value of performance measures of selection criteria is desirable\ni.e., profit, quality, etc.): Considering positive ideal solution (PIS) as < \uD835\uDC47max ∗(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC3Cmin ∗ (\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC39min\n∗(\uD835\uDC65) >; normalized input matrix beneficial criteria are considered as degree of truthness \uD835\uDC47A(\uD835\uDC65), while degree of indeterminacy and degree of falsehood as \uD835\uDC3CA(\uD835\uDC65) = \uD835\uDC39A(\uD835\uDC65) = 1 − \uD835\uDC47A(\uD835\uDC65) respectively.\n(ii) Non beneficial criteria: (Lower value of performance measure of selection criteria is desirable i.e. cost): Considering negative ideal solution (NIS) as < \uD835\uDC47min ∗(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC3Cmax ∗ (\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC39max\n∗(\uD835\uDC65) > ; normalized input matrix non beneficial criteria are considered as degree of indeterminacy and falsehood as \uD835\uDC3CA(\uD835\uDC65) = \uD835\uDC39A(\uD835\uDC65) while degrees of truthness is considered as \uD835\uDC47A(\uD835\uDC65) = 1 − \uD835\uDC3CA(\uD835\uDC65) = 1 − \uD835\uDC39A(\uD835\uDC65) .\n(iii) Find the entropy value for attribute with equation no (1).\n\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC57 = 1 − 1 \uD835\uDC5B⁄ ∑ (\uD835\uDC47ij(\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56) + \uD835\uDC39ij(\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56)) |2(\uD835\uDC3Cij(\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56)) − 1|\n\uD835\uDC5A \uD835\uDC56=1 (1)\nStep 6: We find entropy weight for attribute using the method proposed by Wang and Zhang (2009). \uD835\uDC4A\uD835\uDC57 = 1−\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC57\n∑ (1−\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC57 ) \uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDC57=1\n(2)\nWe get weight vector \uD835\uDC4A = (\uD835\uDC641, \uD835\uDC642,\uD835\uDC643,…………………\uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC5B)\uD835\uDC47 of attributes, \uD835\uDC36 = {\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC57\uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC57 = 1, 2, 3, …… . . \uD835\uDC5B} with \uD835\uDC4A\uD835\uDC57 ≥ 0 and ∑ \uD835\uDC4A\uD835\uDC57 = 1. \uD835\uDC5B\n\uD835\uDC57=1\nStep 7: Calculate the alternative value with following equation (3).\n\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC64 =∑ \uD835\uDC4Aj ∗ ((\uD835\uDC47ij(\uD835\uDC65) ∗ \uD835\uDC47ij ∗(\uD835\uDC65)) + (\uD835\uDC3Cij(\uD835\uDC65) ∗ \uD835\uDC3Cij ∗(\uD835\uDC65) + (\uD835\uDC39ij(\uD835\uDC65) ∗ \uD835\uDC39ij ∗(\uD835\uDC65))\n\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDC57=1 (3)\nWhere, beneficial attribute PIS=< \uD835\uDC47max∗(\uD835\uDC65)\uD835\uDC3Cmin ∗ (\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC39min ∗(\uD835\uDC65) > = < 1, 0, 0 >, For non-beneficial attribute NIS=< \uD835\uDC47min∗(\uD835\uDC65)\uD835\uDC3Cmax ∗ (\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC39max\n∗(\uD835\uDC65) > = < 0, 1, 1 >. Step 8: Ranking of alternatives after calculation is performed according to ascending order.\n4. Case Study An example is considered to show and validate the SVNS entropy based novel MADM method for selection of an AGV for an industrial application. The detailed rationalization of steps involved in the application of novel MADM for section of AGV is explained below. Step 1: The objective is to ranking and selection of the best AGV for a given industrial application. Step 2: In the present work eight alternatives of AGV and six attributes (Criteria) are considered, the same as (K. D. Maniya & Bhatt, 2011). Criteria are: controllability (C1), accuracy (C2), cost (C3), range (C4), reliability (C5) and flexibility (C6). Here cost (C3) from the given attributes is given as non-beneficial attribute indicate with (-) sign in decision matrix; while other attributes are the beneficial attribute indicate with (+) sign in decision matrix. Step 3: Here, in the AGV alternative and attributes and their values are presented in matrix format. The crisp data for AGV selection adopted from (K. D.

Result and Discussions In this paper, SVNS entropy weight MADM technique is developed and implemented to examine its feasibility for selecting and ranking of AGV for material handling system for a given industrial application. The main concluding remarks of proposed technique are listed below:\n The proposed methodology of ranking or selection of alternatives is suitable to decision making under incomplete information, indeterminate and inconsistent information.  The proposed SVNS entropy weight MADM technique gives more efficient and compromise selection of best alternative.  During calculation and normalization there is no loss of information; no single attribute has become zero.  A sensitivity analysis also shows negligible effect on final ranking order and selection of AGV.  Proposed methodology is capable to converting decision maker’s crisp information or fuzzy information into SVNS form, which makes more efficient ranking solution.\n0 10\nA1 A3 A5 A7\nSensitivity Analysis with different Normalization\nMehtod F-SVNS Entropy based Novel MADM\nTechnique\nLinear Scale Transformation, Max Method Linear Scale Transformation, Max-Min Method\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nA1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8\nSensitivity Analysis with different Normalization Mehtod - PSI\nMADM Technique\nLinear Scale Transformation, Max Method Linear Scale Transformation, MaxMin Method Linear Scale Transformation Sum Method Vector Normalization Method\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n113\nReferences 1.

This article aims to make a connection between decision making in game which comprises all the issues that intervene in the process and further making a connection with real life. The method for identification involved, detected or induced uncertainties is a jointing process from linked data fuzzy to neutrosophic data set on a case study, EVE Online game. This analysis is useful for psychologists, sociologists, economic analysis, process management, business area, also for researchers of games domain.\nKeywords\nGame theory, real life, decision making, neutrosophic theory, uncertainty.\n1. Introduction The aim of this study is to offer a method of refining the uncertainties, neutral states appeared in a process being a game reflected in the real life, through neutrosophic theory. In higher forms concerning us, we can associate the function of play as derived from two basic aspects met by us: “as a contest for something or a representation of something”, as asserts Huizinga (Huizinga,1980, p.13).\nThe games, in their configuration, structure, follow the rules, procedures, concepts defined by game theory. There are three categories of games: games of skills, games of chance and games of strategy.\nGames of chance type face uncertainty and risk in decision making process (Janis, Mann, 1977). These decisions are evaluated, analyzed and taken in accordance with game theory, according to the social system involved.\nNeutrosophic theory applied in decision making for solving the uncertainties matches with game theory requirements (Von Neumann, Morgenstern, 1944).\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n116\nFrom the multitude of games we chose to study neutrosophic making decisions, for the case of the EVE online, a complex game both as structure and players, involving complex criteria of the decisions making mechanism.\nWe have to take into consideration that Dr. Eyjólfur Guðmundsson as economist of the game EVE Online, applied the concept of Vernon Smith, Nobel Laureate for experimental economics, asserting: \"This would be any economist's dream, because this is not just an experiment, this is more like a simulation. More like a fully-fledged system where you can input to see what happens\" (http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/eve-online-meet-man-controlling-18-million-space-economy1447437).\nOur opinion is that the game is a precious source of ideas, energy, adrenaline, a simulator, an exercise for real life that promotes success but also decay through addiction, tolerance and thus it can be treated just like drugs. But we want to discuss only the positive side of the game.\nThis game covers both linked data and social media practices, in this context, social media representing computer-mediated tools that allow people or entities to create, share, or exchange information, emotions, feelings, ideas, pictures/videos in virtual communities and networks and on the other side, to provide linked data as method of publishing structured data, interlinked and to become more useful through semantic queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies (such as HTTP, RDF and URIs). It extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers.\n2. Background We are surrounded by data characterized by the performance of our activities, the fuel efficiency of our cars, a multitude of products from different vendors, the values of the air parameters, or the way our taxes are spent. It helps us to make better decision; this data is playing an increasingly central role in our lives, driving the emergence of data economy. Increasing numbers of individuals and organizations are contributing to this deluge by choosing to share their data with others. Availability of data is very important in evaluating, analysis, making decision process (Heath, Bizer, 2011).\n2.1 Fundamentals of Neutrosophic Theory Uncertainty represents an unsolved situation, it defines a fuzziness state. Uncertainty is an actant’s subjective state related to a phenomenon, or decision making, and it becomes objective when it is inserted in a probability calculus system or into an algorithm.\nIt is mentioned in specialty literature that Zadeh introduced the degree of membership/truth (t), the rest would be (1-t) equal to f, their sum being 1, so he defined the fuzzy set in 1965 (Zadeh, 1965). Further, Atanassov introduced the degree of non- membership /falsehood (f) and he defined the intuitionistic fuzzy set (Atanassov, 1986), asserting: if 0<= t + f<= 1 and 0<= 1 – t – f, it would be interpreted as indeterminacy t + f <= 1. In this case, the indeterminacy state, as proposition, cannot be described in fuzzy logic, is missing the uncertainty state; the neutrosophic logic helps to make a distinction between a “relative truth” and an “absolute truth”, while fuzzy logic does not. As novelty to previous theory, Smarandache introduced and defined explicitly the degree of indeterminacy/ neutrality (i) as independent component 0 <= t+ i +f<= 3 . In neutrosophy set, the\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n117\nthree components t, i, f are independent because it is possible from a source to get (t), from another independent source to get (i) and from the third source to get (f). Smarandache goes further; he refined the range (Smarandache, 2005).\nNeutrosophic Set: Let U be a universe of discourse, and M a set included in U. An element x from U is noted with respect to the set M as x(T, I, F) and belongs to M in the following way: it is t% true in the set, i% indeterminate (unknown if it is) in the set, and f% false, where t varies in T, i varies in I, f varies in F (Smarandache, 2005).\nStatically T, I, F are subsets, but dynamically T, I, F are functions/operators depending on many known or unknown parameters. Neutrosophic set generalizes the fuzzy set (especially intuitionistic fuzzy set), paraconsistent set, intuitionistic set, etc.\n2.2 Applicability of Neutrosophic Theory Applicability of neutrosophic theory is large, from social sciences such as sociology, philosophy, literature, arts (Smarandache, Vlăduțescu, 2014; Smarandache, 2015; Păun, Teodorescu, 2014; Opran, Voinea, Teodorescu,2014; Smarandache, Gîfu, Teodorescu, 2015 ) to sciences such as physics, artificial intelligence, mathematics (Smarandache, Vlădăreanu, 2014).\nThere are some remarkable results of netrosophic theory applied in practical applications such as artificial intelligence (Gal et al, 2014), in robotics there are confirmed results of neutrosofics logics applied to make decisions for uncertainty situations (Okuyama el al 2013; Smarandache, 2011), also for the real-time adaptive networked control of the robot movement on surface with uncertainties (Smarandache, 2014).\nAthar Kharal has also a contribution to multi criteria making decision (MCDM) developing an algorithm of uncertainty criteria selection using neutrosophic sets. The proposed method allows the degree of satisfiability (t), non-satisfiability (f) and indeterminacy (i) mentioning a set of criteria represented by neutrosophic sets (Kharal, 2014).\nThere is no instant game, or instant action; if they existed, it would involve a very limited time fund, if they were instant, we could calculate the uncertainty, we should not have too many variables. If the time is longer, more variables appear, more uncertainties. We evaluate the situation “1” according to what every social actor wants, it is the sustained decision. The state \"0\" represents the decision that is rejected by social actors. Between “0” and “1” remain states of uncertainty, neutrality, uncertain decisions. In this manner we extend the fuzzy theory to neutrosophic theory. In fact, the novelty of neutrosophy consists of approaching the indeterminacy status. (Smarandahe, 2005).\nStarting of this point, we are confidence that neutrosophic theory can help to analyze, evaluate and make the right decision in process analysis taking into account all sources that can generate uncertainty, from human being (not appropriate skill), logistics concept, lack of information, programming automation process according to requirements, etc.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n118\n3. Games, elements of culture, double articulated\nProbably, Ludwig Wittgenstein was the first academic philosopher who addressed the definition of the word game. In his work, Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein argued that the “elements of games, such as play, rules, and competition”, all contribute to define what games are, but not totally (Wittgenstein, 1953).\nJean Piaget suggested in his work, Genetic Epistemology, “that children think differently than adults and proposed a stage theory of cognitive development”. He was the first one to note that children play an active role in gaining knowledge of the world, playing games; children can be thought of as \"little scientists\" who are actively constructing their knowledge and understanding of the world (Piaget, 1970; Piaget, 1983).\nArgument 1. Games are culture related, everything is repeated by as many people as possible, and it becomes acceptable to most, spread and cultivated (e.g. internet; it shows a minimal know-how). Culture is a complex principle of behavior, spiritual and material values created by mankind, beliefs, tradition and art, passed down from generation to generation. The sense of culture finds its significance in the life of an individual and society. In this context, \"any authentic creation is a gift to the future.\" – asserts Albert Camus.\nFor humans, culture is the specific environment of existence. It defines an existential field, characterized by a synthesis between objective and subjective, between real and ideal. Culture defines a synthetic human way of existence and it is the symbol of man's creative force. It represents a real value system.\nArgument 2. Games produce culture, the Internet being unlimited, is a huge catalyst of desire. It is a sublime achievement in economic terms. For example, the Internet can offer so many texts about Kant that you never got around to finish in silence any of his “Critiques”. The time of assimilation is now dedicated to search. More than ever, McLuhan's equation says it all about the Internet: “The medium is the message”, says a voice that is heard beyond any meaning of utterances made. Only the pleasure, the voice, the search on Internet are now authentic. Time is limited, not space. From time only desire can provide the intensity necessary to forget this ontological asymmetry (Luhan, 1967).\nThe Internet allows many people to discover their identity more easily. Some people who were shy or lonely or feel unattractive, discover that they can socialize more successfully and express themselves more freely in an online environment.\nBeing able to pretend you are someone else is an important mental skill that the child acquires if he is involved in such games. The same thing is experienced by an adult on Internet games, on Facebook, for example, a doubling of personality, a place where you can be different, without constraints, where you are at your own free will, where decision belongs entirely to you, where only uncertainties hinder you. You can think what you want but you can never think of everything that can be thought. If it were possible for every man to think all that is conceivable and with a consistent content, there would be no freedom of thought or thoughts individualized particular to each topic. Mentally anticipating the future, one can access one’s individual mental states of the\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n119\ndistant future; one can get art work depicting thoughts, theories or advanced and complicated scientific technologies, currently unimaginable.\n4. Case study EVE Online is a “massively multiplayer online game set 23,000 years in the future. As an elite pilot of one of the four controlling races, the player will explore, build, and dominate across an universe of over 7,000 star systems”1, see Figure 1. In EVE Online the possibilities are endless. Eve Online is a peculiar concept, it is a simulation, it is an experiment which mirrors the social interactions and communications of the real world, just like the real world, it has a fully functioning economy. In fact, “it has an economy which could be used and studied in order to help what we do in the real world, according to the man charged with overseeing how the $18 million economy operates”2.\nFigure 1.Very real implications\nWhile what is happening in universe environment of EVE planets in the far off star systems may not have much relevance in today's world, but the way the EVE economy functions could have very real implications: \"We try to have a relative balance of money coming in and money coming out and the increase per month should represent the net increase in economic value”; “We function as a national economics institute, statistics office and central bank giving advice to government, with the government being the developers and us being the monitoring authority\"3.\nConsidering data of EVE Online game, the complexity of environment, we can estimate some causes that can generate uncertainties such as: unknown universe; cohesion of the team members; alliance trust; financial system crisis; equipment reliability.\n1 https://www.eveonline.com 2 David Gilbert, Eve Online: Meet the Man Controlling the $18 Million Space Economy, International Business Time, May 6, 2014 3 http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/eve-online-meet-man-controlling-18-million-space-economy-1447437\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n120\nFor each of these causes the occurrences in a time unit are analyzed (e.g.: 1 week), the space M assimilated to the environment of universe, the governance is poorly defined in this space: the control of universe, defeat the forces of evil, building a stable system. According to this conditions we can simulate the situation by a Pareto Chart, see Figure 2:\nFigure 2. Pareto Chart Step 1\nPareto analysis is a creative way of evaluation causes of problems because it helps to stimulate the processes, thinking and organize thoughts, assessing the causes that lead to system instability through neutrosophic theory.\nIn this context, we define a space M consisting of 5 elements, where t means true, i means uncertainty and f means false:\nM = { a1 (t1, i1, f1), a2 (t2, i2, f2), a3 (t3, i3, f3), a4 (t4, i4, f4), a5 (t5, i5, f5)}\n Unknown universe: a1(t1, i1, f1)\n Team cohesion: a2(t2, i2, f2)\n Alliance trust: a3(t3, i3, f3)\n Financial stability: a4(t4, i4, f4)\n Equipment reliability: a5 (t5, i5, f5)\nAccording to Pareto Chart, we established the rate for each space element percentage for the set (t, i, f).\nAnalyzing the content of elements data, we can establish that relative frequency of events means uncertainty and events solving means true, respectively non solving, false. The process is revealed in Table 1.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n121\nTable 1. Determination of T, I, F consistency - Step 1\nNeutrosophic interpretation gives an ordered list of alternatives of uncertainties, depending on us, which is the most preferred element.\nWe will stop at a2component that generates uncertainty for the cause of “team cohesion”. Pareto Chart says that by addressing the cause 20%, it determines 80% uncertainty and can also solve 80% of problems of the system stability. We have to concentrate on uncertainty of a2 component, to reduce its value,\na21(t21, i21, f21)  a21(53,85%, 25,49%, 46,15%) in the first step of the process. The refining process, step 2, can be seen in the next set of data presented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3.

When we try to make a good decision, a person must weigh the positives, negatives and uncertainty of each option, and to consider all the alternatives. For effective decision making, a person must be able to forecast the outcome of each option as well, and based on all these items, to determine which option is the best for that particular situation.\nDecision-making is identified as a cognitive process that results in the selection of a belief or an action among several alternative possibilities. Decision-making is a complex process of identifying, analyzing and choosing alternatives based on the values and preferences of the decision maker. Decision-making is one of the central activities of management and it is an important part of any implementation process (Kahneman, Tversky, 2000).\nUsually, in our daily lives, we implicitly compare multiple criteria and we want to be comfortable with the consequences of such decisions that are mostly made based only on intuition. On the other hand, when we confront with high stakes, it is important to structure the problem and to evaluate multiple criteria. In decision making process based on multiple criteria (Multi Criteria Decision Making) of whether to do an important issue or not, there are involved not only very complex multiple criteria, there are also inferred multiple parties who are deeply affected from the consequences, because present decisions, act in the future.\nDecisions making related to games area, shows its similitude with real life, can be easily transferred to the real world. It is our choice whether to do this or not.\n5. Conclusions Decisions making is a complex act including variables related to uncertainty, with implications for the future work. Uncertainty, in turn, involves classification criteria based on methods that may be applied for determining the degree of uncertainty and settlement. Establishing the types of variables that influence uncertainty, it makes possible the identification of the decisions that we are referring, that will influence, will constrain the process on the one hand, and will be influenced and constrained by a specific decision on the other hand.\nProblem solving and decision-making are important skills for business and life. Problemsolving often involves decision-making, and decision-making is especially important for management and leadership. Between them there is the correspondence: identification of the problem vs. frame of the decision; exploring the alternatives vs. improve to address needs and identify alternatives; select an alternative vs. decision and commitment to act; implementation of\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n124\nthe solution vs. management of the consequences; evaluation of the situation vs. management of the consequences and frame the related decisions.\nWhat we deduced on the basis of this study is that the game is reality and reality is game. We build reality through the game, we take risks that include uncertainties, the game becomes a training and an experimentation place for many specialists, proving that the school becomes life. Here is how the neutrosophic theory, guide us to be closer to solve uncertainties, transforming them into true or false, stable and controllable states of the systems.\nReferences 1. Adler, A.

In the decision making situation, the rating of alternatives with respect to the predefined attributes is described by linguistic variables, which can be represented by interval - valued neutrosophic sets. We assume that the weight of the attributes are not equal in the decision making process and they are obtained by using maximizing deviation method. We define weighted projection measure and propose a method to rank the alternatives. Furthermore, we also develop an alternative method to solve multiple attribute decision making problems based on the combination of angle cosine and projection method. Finally, an illustrative numerical example in Khadi institution is solved to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\nKeywords Interval-valued neutrosophic sets; projection measure; weighted projection measure; angle cosine; multiple attribute decision making.\n1. Introduction Multiple attribute decision making (MADM) is one of the most significant parts of modern decision science and it is a well known method for selecting the most desirable alternative from a set of all feasible alternatives with respect to some predefined attributes. However, the information about the attributes is generally incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent in nature due to the complexity of real world problems. Smarandache [1-4] grounded the concept of neutrosophic sets (NSs) from philosophical point of view by incorporating the degree of indeterminacy or neutrality as independent component to deal with problems involving imprecise, indeterminate and inconsistent information and the concept of NSs has been applied to different fields such as decision sciences, social sciences, humanities, etc. From scientific and realistic point of view, Wang et al. [5] defined single valued NSs (SVNSs) and then presented the set theoretic operators\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n128\nand various properties of SVNSs. Wang et al. [6] also developed the notion of interval neutrosophic sets (INSs) characterized by membership, non-membership and falsity-membership functions, whose values are interval rather than real numbers.\nIn 2013, Chi and Liu [7] first discussed a novel approach for solving MADM problems based on extended TOPSIS method under interval neutrosophic environment. Zhang et al. [8] defined some operators for INSs and established a multi-criteria decision making method. Broumi and Smarandache [9] defined cosine similarity measure between two INSs and applied the concept to medical diagnosis problem. Ye [10] proposed some similarity measures between two IVNSs based on the relationship of similarity measures and distance measures and utilized the developed method to solve a multi-criteria decision making problem. Sahin and Liu [11] developed maximizing deviation method for solving MADM problems having incomplete weight information. They employed single valued neutrosophic weighted averaging operator and interval neutrosophic weighted averaging operator in order to aggregate the neutrosophic information corresponding to each alternative and the most desirable alternatives are obtained based on score and accuracy functions. Pramanik and Mondal [12] discussed interval neutrosophic MADM based on grey relational analysis (GRA) method where the unknown attribute weights are derived from information entropy method. Later, Dey et al. [13] studied an extended GRA based interval neutrosophic MADM for weaver selection in Khadi institution. Mondal and Pramanik [14] proposed cosine, Dice and Jaccard similarity measures of interval rough neutrosophic set for solving MADM problems. Recently, Dey et al. [15] investigated an extended GRA method for MADM problem with interval neutrosophic uncertain linguistic information.\nProjection measure is useful device for solving decision making problems because it takes into account the distance as well as the included angle between points evaluated [16]. Xu and Hu [17] provided projection models for dealing with intuitionistic fuzzy MADM problems. Zeng et al. [18] demonstrated weighted projection algorithms for multiple arttribute group decision problems under intuitionistic fuzzy and interval – valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Yue [19-20] presented a projection method to obtain weights of the experts in a group decision making problem. Yue [21] proposed a projection based approach for partner selection in a group decision making problem with linguistic values and intuitionistic fuzzy information. Ju and Wang [22] investigated a methodology to multicriteria group decision problems with incomplete weight information in linguistic setting based on projection method. Yang and Du [23] developed a straightforward method for obtaining the weights of the decision makers based on angle cosine and projection method. Ye [24] discussed a simplified neutrosophic harmonic averaging projection based method to solve MADM problems. Ye [25] provided a decision making method based on credibilityinduced interval neutrosophic weighted arithmetic averaging operator and credibility-induced interval neutrosophic weighted geometric averaging operator and the projection measure-based ranking method to solve MADM problems with interval neutrosophic information and credibility information.\nIn this paper, we define weighted projection measure for interval – neutrosophic information and develop a method for solving MADM problems based on weighted projection method. We\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n129\nalso investigate a method for MADM under interval - valued neutrosophic environment based on the combination of angle cosine and projection method.\nRest of the paper is prepared as follows: Sec. 2 presents several definitions. An interval - valued neutrosophic MADM based on weighted projection method is discussed in Sec. 3. Subsection 3.1 presents the algorithm for MADM problems with interval valued neutrosophic information based on weighted projection method. Subsection 3.2 presents the approach for solving interval - valued neutrosophic MADM problems based on angle cosine and projection method. Subsection 3.3 presents the algorithm for MADM problem with interval valued neutrosophic information based on angle cosine and projection method In Sec. 4, we solve a numerical example to show the applicability and feasibility of the proposed method. Sec. 5 provides conslusion and future scope of research.\n2. Preliminaries In this Section, we briefly present some basic definitions which will be useful for the formulation of the paper. 2.1 Neutrosophic set\nDefinition 2.1.1 [1-4]: Consider U be a universal space of points with generic element in U denoted by x.

An interval - valued neutrosophic MADM based on weighted projection method Assume that H = {h1, h2, …, hm}, (m  2) be a discrete set of alternatives and K ={k1, k2, …, kn}, (n  2) be a set of attributes under consideration in a MADM problem. The rating of performance value of alternative hi, i = 1, 2, …, m with respect to the predefined attribute kj, j = 1, 2, …, n is represented by linguistic variables. The linguistic variables can be expressed by IVNNs. Assume\nw = {w1, w2, …, wn} be the unknown weight vector of the attributes, where 0 wj 1with  \nn 1j j w = 1.\nThe weighted projection method for solving MADM problem with interval -valued neutrosophic information is described by using the following steps:\nStep 1. Formulation of decision matrix with IVNNs The evaluation value of the alternative hi, i = 1, 2, …, m with respect to the attribute kj, j = 1, 2, …, n is presented by the expert in terms of linguistic variables that can be expressed by IVNNs. Therefore, interval – valued neutrosophic decision matrix ND ~ is presented as given below.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n133\nND ~ = nmN~ ij r =\n      \n\n      \n\nmnm2m1\n2n2221\n1n1211 r...rr ...... ...... r...rr r...rr\n(3.1)\nHere rij = <[ -ijT ,  ijT ], [ - ijI ,  ijI ], [ - ijF ,  ijF ]>; - ijT ,  ijT , - ijI ,  ijI , - ijF ,  ijF [0, 1] and 0  sup  ijT + sup  ijI +\nsup ijF  3, i = 1, 2, …, m; j = 1, 2, …, n. Here, [ - ijT ,  ijT ] represents the degree that the alternative hi satisfies the attribute kj. [ -ijI ,  ijI ] denotes the degree that the alternative hi is indeterminacy on the attribute kj. [ -ijF , \nijF ] indicates the degree that the alternative hi does not satisfies the attribute kj. Step 2. Standardize the decision matrix Generally, two types of attributes are encountered in practical decision making problems such as benefit type attribute where bigger value of the attribute reflects better alternative and cost type attribute where bigger value of the attribute reflects worse alternative. However, in order to remove the influence of different physical dimensions to decision results, we require to standardize the decision matrix. The standardize decision matrix S = [sij]m  n owing to Chi and Liu [7] is formulated as follows:\nSD ˆ = nmŜij t =\n      \n\n      \n\nmnm2m1\n2n2221\n1n1211 t...tt ...... ...... t...tt t...tt\n(3.2)\nwhere tij = ([ -ijT ,  ijT ], [ - ijI ,  ijI ],[ - ijF ,  ijF ]), (i = 1, 2, ..., m; j = 1, 2, ..., n). Here, we have tij = rij, if j is benefit type, (3.3) tij = ijr  , if j is cost type (3.4) where, ijr \nis the complement of tij. Step 3. Determination of unknown weights of the attributes In the decision making environment, we assume that the weights of the attributes are unknown to the expert and generally they are not identical. We use maximizing deviation method of Wang [29] to derive unknown attribute weights. The concept of maximizing deviation method is presented as follows. If an attribute has a small effect on the alternatives then the attribute value should be assigned with a small weight and the attribute which creates bigger deviation should be assigned with a bigger weight. However, if an attribute has very small or no effect on the alternatives then the weight of such attribute may be taken as zero [29].\nThe deviation values of alternatives hi to all other alternatives with respect to attribute kj can be formulated as ij (wj) = )t,t( sjij m\n1s    wj, then j (wj) =   \nm 1i ij (wj) =      m 1i m 1s jsjij )t,(t w represents total\ndeviation of all alternatives to the other alternatives for the attribute kj.  (wj) = )( n\n1j jj    w =\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n134\n      \nn\n1j\nm 1i jsjij m 1s )t,(t w denotes the deviation of all attributes for all alternatives to the other\nalternatives. Now we construct the optimization model [29] as given below.\nMaximize  (wj) =       \nn\n1j\nm 1i jsjij m 1s )t,(t w\nSubject to  \nn\n1j\n2 jw = 1, wj0, j = 1, 2, …, n. (3.5)\nSolving the above model, we obtain attribute weight [29] as follows:\nwj =      \n   \n\n\nn\n1j\nm\ni\nm\n1s sjij 2\nm\ni\nm\n1s sjij\n)t,(t\n)t,(t , j = 1, 2, …, n. (3.6)\nThen, the normalized attribute weight is obtained as\nwj =      \n   \n\n\nn\n1j\nm\ni\nm\n1s sjij\nm\ni\nm\n1s sjij\n)t,(t\n)t,(t , j = 1, 2, …, n. (3.7)\nStep 4. Determination of interval - valued neutrosophic ideal solution\nWe determine the interval - valued neutrosophic ideal solution *Z = ( *1z , * 2z , ..., * nz ) [7] as given\nbelow. * jz = ([1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0]), j = 1, 2, …, n. (3.8)\nThe virtual interval - valued neutrosophic ideal solution *Z = ( *1μ , * 2μ , ..., * nμ ) [7] can also be\nobtained by identifying the best values for each attribute from all alternatives as shown below. * jμ = ( * j , * j , * j ) (3.9)\nwhere, *j = [ *L j , *U\nj ] = [ i Max -ijT , i Max ijT ]; * j = [ *L j , *U j ] = [ iMin - ijI , iMin  ijI ]; * j = [ *L j ,\n*U j ] = [ iMin - ijF , iMin  ijF ]. Step 5. Calculation of the weighted projection The weighted projection of the alternative hi (i = 1, 2, …, m) on the ideal solution *Z is defined as follows:\nProj *)( Ziw g = wZ ||||\n1 *\n \n  n 1j *U jij *L j - ij *U jij *L j - ij *U jij *L j - ij 2 j )FFIITT(  w\n=  \n \n\n\n\nn\n1j\n2*U j 2*L j 2*U j 2*L j 2*U j 2*L j 2 j\nn\n1j\n*U jij *L j - ij *U jij *L j - ij *U jij *L j - ij 2 j\n))()()()()()((\n)FFIITT(\n\n\nw\nw  (3.10)\nStep 6.

End.\n3.2 Extension An approach for solving interval - valued neutrosophic MADM problems based on angle cosine and projection method The angle cosine [27] between the alternative hi (i = 1, 2, …, m) and the ideal solution *Z is defined as follows: Cos (hi, *Z ) =\n   \n\n \n\n\n\nn 1j\n2*U j 2*L j 2*U j 2*L j 2*U j 2*L j\nn 1j\n2 ij 2- ij 2 ij 2- ij 2 ij 2- ij\nn 1j\n*U jij *L j - ij *U jij *L j - ij *U jij *L j - ij\n))()()()()()(())F()F()I()I()T()T((\n)FFIITT(\n\n\n\n (3.11)\nNow we propose the direction indicator  (0    1) to convert the direction closeness and\nmagnitude closeness into relative closeness i . If the DM gives more interest on direction, then he or she provides bigger value to . Otherwise, smaller value of  is provided if the magnitude is much more important to the DM [23].\nTherefore, the relative closeness [23] for selecting the best alternative is given as follows:\ni =  Cos (hi, *Z ) + (1-  ) Proj *)( Zih (3.12) The bigger value of i gives the better alternative.\n3.3 Algorithm 2.

A numerical example In this Section, we adapt an illustrative example from Dey et al. [13] for weaver selection in Khadi Institution where the information about attributes is expressed by linguistic variables. Consider a Khadi Institution wants to recruit two most competent weavers from a panel of three weavers h1, h2, h3. Seven main attributes for weaver selection are: Skill (k1); Previous experience (k2); Honesty (k3); Physical fitness (k4); Locality of the weaver (k5); Personality (k6); Economic condition of the weaver (k7) [30]. The Khadi Institution hire a Khadi expert to choose the desirable weavers based on the seven attributes. The evaluation information of an alternative hi (i = 1, 2, 3) with respect to seven attributes are provided by the Khadi expert in terms of linguistic variables as shown in the Table 2. It is to be noted that the seven attributes are of benefit type and the weights of the attributes are calculated by using maximizing deviation method. 4.1 Method 1\nThe procedure for weaver selection based on weighted projection method is presented by the following steps: Step 1: We transform the linguistic decision matrix as shown in Table 2 into interval – valued neutrosophic decision matrix by means of Table 1.\nTable 2.

Conclusion The paper is devoted to propose two new models for MADM problems with interval – valued neutrosophic information. In the decision making process, the rating of alternatives with respect to attributes are described by linguistic variables that can be represented by IVNNs. Since the weights of the attributes are fully unknown to the expert, we use maximization deviation method to find them. Then, we determine interval - valued neutrosophic ideal solutions. Finally, we develop weighted projection method to rank the alternatives. In this paper, we also propose an algorithm for MADM problems under interval neutrosophic environment via angle cosine and projection method. An illustrative example for weaver selection is solved to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed models. We also compare the obtained results with other existing approaches. In future, we will extend the concept to solve multi-attribute group decision making problems with interval – valued neutrosophic assessment. The authors hope that the proposed approach can be effective for dealing with diverse practical problems such as medical diagnosis, pattern recognition, management system, school choice, teacher selection, etc.\nReferences 1.

Smarandache [1] defined the degree of indeterminacy/neutrality as independent component in 1995 (published\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\nKANIKA MANDAL, KAJLA BASU\nDepartment of Mathematics, NIT Durgapur, West Bengal 713209, India. E-mails: boson89@yahoo.com, kajla.basu@gmail.com\nMulti Criteria Decision Making Method in Neutrosophic\nEnvironment Using a New Aggregation Operator, Score\nand Certainty Function\n141\nAbstract Neutrosophic sets, being generalization of classic sets, fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets, can simultaneously represent uncertain, imprecise, incomplete, and inconsistent information existing in the real world. Neutrosophic theory has been developed in twenty first century and not much of arithmetic has been developed for this set. To solve any problem using neutrosophic data, it is desirable to have suitable operators, score function etc. Some operators like single valued neutrosophic weighted averaging (SVNWA) operator, single valued neutrosophic weighted geometric (SVNWG) operator are already defined in neutrosophic set (NS). In this paper an improved weighted average geometric (IWAG) operator which produces more meaningful results has been introduced to aggregate some real numbers and the same has been extended in neutrosophic environment. We further generalize this to include a wide range of aggregation operators for both real numbers and neutrosophic numbers. A new score function and certainty function have been defined which have some benefit compared to the existing ones. Further comparative study highlighting the benefit of this new approach of ranking in neutrosophic set has been presented. A multiple-attribute decision-making method is established on the basis of the proposed operator and newly defined score function.\nKeywords Fuzzy critical path, crashing. probability factor, neutrosophic set, aggregation Operator, score\nfunction, certainty function, and Decision Making.\nin 1998). NS can express uncertain, imprecise, incomplete and inconsistent information more precisely. How to aggregate information is an important problem in real management and decision process. Due to the complexity of management environments and decision problems, decision makers may provide their ratings or judgments to some certain degree, but it is possible that they are not so sure about their judgments. Namely, there may exist some uncertain, imprecise, incomplete, and inconsistent information, which are very important factors to be taken into account when trying to construct really adequate models and solutions of decision problems. Such kind of information is suitably expressed with neutrosophic fuzzy sets rather than exact numerical values, fuzzy or intuitionistic fuzzy. Thus, how to aggregate neutrosophic fuzzy information becomes an important part of multi-attribute decision-making with neutrosophic fuzzy sets.\nIn [17] Zhang-peng Tian et al. solved green product design selection problems using neutrosophic linguistic information. Xiao-hui Wu et al. [13] established ranking methods for simplified neutrosophic sets based on prioritized aggregation operators and cross-entropy measures to solve multi criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. Interval neutrosophic linguistic aggregation operators were developed and applied to the medical treatment selection process [16] by Yinxiang Ma et al. In [20] Hong-yu Zhang, Jian-qiang Wang and Xiao-hong Chen defined some reliable operations for interval-valued neotrosophic sets. Based on those operators they also developed two aggregation operators which were applied to solve a MCDM problem. Jun Ye introduced in [4] single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (SVNHFWA) operator and a single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric (SVNHFWG) operator and using those operator a multiple-attribute decision-making method was established. Peide Liu, Yanchang Chu, Yanwei Li, and Yubao Chen [7] presented some operational laws for neutrosophic numbers (NNs) based on Hamacher operations and proposed several averaging operators and applied them to group decision making. Broumi, Smarandache defined operations based on the arithmetic mean, geometrical mean and harmonic mean on interval-valued neutrosophic sets in [8].\nIn this paper we introduce an improved aggregating operator named improved weighted averaging geometric mean (IWAGM) for real numbers which produces more meaningful results and extend it for single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) as improved single valued weighted averaging geometric (ISVWAG) operator. We further generalize the IWAGM operator and introduce generalized improved weighted averaging geometric mean (GIWAGM) which includes a wide range of weighted average geometric operators. Also we extend the GIWAGM for single valued neutrosophic numbers. We introduce a new score function and certainty function which are illustrated using simple examples and applied to numerical\n142\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\nexample. A comparative study highlighting the benefit of this new approach of ranking in NS has been discussed. An algorithm has been given to find optimum solution of multi-criteria decision making problem and a numerical illustration for a network problem has been presented.\nThe operators developed in this paper are original and have been developed for SVNS for the first time. Very few works have been done on averaging operator in SVNS. The score function and certainty function newly introduced in this paper have some benefits compared to the existing ones. The score function and certainty function defined earlier give same score function value for different neutrosophic numbers easily. But the newly proposed ones can remove this difficulty.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces some concepts of neutrosophic sets and simplified neutrosophic sets. Section 3 describes weighted average mean (WAM) and weighted geometric mean (WGM) for real numbers and their limitations. In section 4, we define a new IWAGM for real numbers and compare the results with the existing ones highlighting the improvement over the WAM and WGM. IWAGM has been extended in neutrosophic environment in section 5. In section 6, we generalize the IWAGM introduced in section 4 and extend the generalization for neutrosophic numbers. Section 7 introduces a new approach defining a new score function and certainty function to compare the neutrosophic numbers. Why the approach is more realistic and meaningful is discussed in this section. Section 8 presents the algorithm for finding optimum alternative among alternatives in a decision making problem in neutrosophic environment using the introduced operator IWAG in subsection 5.2 and the comparison approach defined in section 7. In section 9, a numerical example demonstrates the application and effectiveness of the proposed aggregation operator and comparison rules in decision-making problems. We conclude the paper in section 10.\n2 NEUTROSOPHIC SETS\n2.1 Definition\nLet U be an universe of discourse then the neutrosophic set A is defined as A = {〈x : TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)〉 , x ∈ U}, where the functions T, I, F: U → ]−0, 1+[ define respectively the degree of membership (or Truth), the degree of indeterminacy and the degree of non-membership (or falsehood) of the element x ∈ U to the set A with the condition −0 ≤ TA(x) + IA(x) + FA(x) ≤ 3+.\n143\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\nTo apply neutrosophic set to science and technology, we consider the neutrosophic set which takes the value from the subset of [0, 1] instead of ]−0, 1+[; i.e., we consider SNS as defined by Ye in [3].\n2.2 Simplified Neutrosophic Set\nLet X be a space of points (objects) with generic elements in X denoted by x. A neutrosophic set A in X is characterized by a truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy membership function IA(x), and a falsity-membership function FA(x), if the functions TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) are singleton subintervals/subsets in the real standard [0, 1], i.e., TA(x) : X → [0, 1], IA(x) : X → [0, 1] and FA(x) : X → [0, 1]. Then a simplification of the neutrosophic set A is denoted by A = {〈x, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)〉 , x ∈ X}.\n2.3 Simplified neutrosophic set(SVNS)\nLet X be a space of points (objects) with generic elements in X denoted by x. A SVNS A in X is characterized by a truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy membership function IA(x) and a falsity-membership function FA(x), for each point x ∈ X, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore, a SVNS A can be written as ASV NS = {〈x, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)〉 , x ∈ X}. For two SVNS, ASV NS = {〈x, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)〉 , x ∈ X} andBSV NS = {〈x, TB(x), IB(x), FB(x)〉 , x ∈ X}, the following expressions are defined in [12] as follows: ANS ⊆ BNS if and only if TA(x) ≤ TB(x), IA(x) ≥ IB(x), FA(x) ≥ FB(x). ANS = BNS if and only if TA(x) = TB(x), IA(x) = IB(x), FA(x) = FB(x). Ac = 〈x, FA(x), 1− IA(x), TA(x)〉.\nFor convenience, a SVNS A is denoted by A = 〈TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)〉 for any x in X. For two SVNSs A and B, the operational relations (1), (2), (3) are defined by [3] and (4) by [2] (1) A+B = 〈 TA(x) + TB(x)− TA(x)TB(x), IA(x) + IB(x)− IA(x)IB(x),FA(x) + FB(x)− FA(x)FB(x) 〉. (2) A.B = 〈TA(x).TB(x), IA(x).IB(x), FA(x).FB(x)〉 (3) Aλ = 〈 T λA(x), I λ A(x), F λ A(x) 〉 . (4) For any scalar λ > 0, λA = 〈min(λTA(x), 1),min(λIA(x), 1),min(λFA(x), 1)〉.\n3 AGGREGATION OPERATORS\nAggregation operators are mathematical functions that are used to combine information. That is, they are used to combine N data (for example, N numerical\n144\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\nvalues) in a single datum. In classical algebra WAM and WGM are very useful to combine n real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an. The WAM of n real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an with associated weights w1, w2, . . . , wn respectively, wi ∈ [0, 1] and ∑ wi = 1, is defined by ∑n i=1 aiwi. The WGM of n real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an with associated weights w1, w2, . . . , wn respectively, wi ∈ [0, 1] and ∑ wi = 1, is defined by ∏n i=1 a wi i .\n3.1 Some limitations of WAM and WGM\nThe result of an aggregation operator is meaningful if its value tends to one or some number(s) (among those to be combined) whose weight(s) is on the higher side. They do not correctly aggregate the information, if the aggregated value does not tend towards maximum arguments or does not lie between the maximum and minimum arguments. Let us consider some cases. Example. Case 1: Take two real numbers 0.0001 and 1 with their weights w1 = 0.9, w2 = 0.1 respectively. Then WAM = 0.10009, WGM = 0.000251. Case 2: Again take 0.0001 and 1 with their weights w1 = 0.1, w2 = 0.9 respectively. Then WAM = 0.90001, WGM = 0.398107. From these results we observe that from the first case the value of WGM is more close to the number whose weight is maximum than WAM . So in this case, WGM aggregates the numbers more close to the highest weighted number. On the other side in the second case the value of WAM is nearest to the maximum weighted number whereas WGM is close to 0.0001, the minimum weighted number. Here WAM value is more meaningful. The examples show that WAM and WGM operators may not simultaneously give meaningful result while aggregating the information. Now we propose a new aggregation operator that always gives a moderate value close to the maximum weighted number.\n4 THE NEWLY PROPOSED WEIGHTED MEAN\nLet a1, a2, . . . , an are n real numbers with associated weights w1, w2, . . . , wn respectively, wi ∈ [0, 1] and ∑ wi = 1. Then we define improved weighted average geometric mean (IWAGM) as\nIWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) = n∑ i=1 a 1 2 i wi n∏ i=1 a wi 2 i (1)\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n145\n4.1 Properties\nLet a1, a2, . . . , an are n real numbers. Then the aggregated result of the IWAGM operator clearly satisfies desired properties of an aggregation operator :\n(1). Idempotency: let ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be a collection of real numbers. If all ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) are equal, that is, ai = a, for all(i = 1, 2, . . . , n), then\nIWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) = a 1 2 ∑n i=1wi ∏n i=1 a wi 2 = a\n(2). Boundedness: If a− = mini ai and a + = maxi ai, ∑n i=1(a −) 1 2wi ∏n i=1(a\n−) wi 2 ≤∑n\ni=1 a 1 2 i wi ∏n i=1 a wi 2 i ≤ ∑n i=1(a +) 1 2wi ∏n i=1(a +) wi 2 ,\ni.e. a− ≤ IWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) ≤ a+.\n(3). Symmetry or commutativity: The order of the arguments has no influence on the result. For every permutation σ of 1, 2, . . . , n the operator satisfies IWAGM(aσ(1), aσ(2), . . . , aσ(n)) = IWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an)\n(4). Monotonicity : If ai ≤ a∗i for all (i = 1, 2, . . . , n),∑n i=1 a 1 2 i wi ∏n i=1 a wi 2 i ≤ ∑n i=1(a ∗ i ) 1 2wi ∏n i=1(a ∗ i ) wi 2 .\nSo IWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) ≤ IWAGM(a∗1, a∗2, . . . , a∗n).\n4.2 Theorem\nFor n real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an, WGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) ≤ IWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) ≤ WAM(a1, a2, . . . , an).\nProof: We know WAM of some real numbers always greater than or equal to WGM of those real numbers. So if we consider n numbers a 1 2 1 , a 1 2 2 , . . . , a 1 2 n with their weights w1, w2, . . . , wn respectively, then∑n i=1 a 1 2 i wi ≥ ∏n i=1 a wi 2 i .\nNow, ∑n i=1 a 1 2 i wi ∏n i=1 a wi 2\ni∏n i=1 a wi i\n= ∑n\ni=1 a 1 2 i wi∏n\ni=1 a wi 2 i\n≥ 1.\ni.e., WGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) ≤ IWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) (2)\nAgain we know if a1, a2, . . . , an be positive real numbers, not all equal, w1, w2, . . . , wn be positive real numbers such that ∑n i=1wi = 1 and m is rational,\n146\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\nlies between 0 and 1, ∑n\ni=1wia m i ≤ ( ∑n i=1wiai)\nm. Taking m = 1\n2 ,\nn∑ i=1 wia 1 2 i ≤ ( n∑ i=1 wiai) 1 2 (3)\nAlso, ∏n\ni=1 a wi i ≤ ∑n i=1 aiwi\nTaking square root in both side,\nn∏ i=1 a wi 2 i ≤ ( n∑ i=1 aiwi) 1 2 (4)\nMultiplying (3) and (4), we get\nIWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) ≤ WAM(a1, a2, . . . , an) (5)\nSo combining (2) and (5), we get our proposed result.\n4.3 Meaningful advantage of the proposed operator\nUsing the newly introduced operator, the aggregated results of the numbers with their weightage given in subsection 3.1, are given below: For case 1, IWAGM(0.0001, 1) = 0.001728 , and for case 2, IWAGM(0.0001, 1) = 0.5684. So in both the cases the newly introduced operator gives a moderate value close to the maximum weighted number. WAM and WGM may not simultaneously give meaningful result for all the numbers; but result from the proposed operator is meaningful since it holds the relation (2) and (5). In fact the new operator improves both the WAM and WGM and gives a moderate, meaningful value.\n5 WEIGHTED AGGREGATION OPERATORS\nIN NEUTROSOPHIC ENVIRONMENT\n5.1 Extension of WAM and WGM of classical algebra in neutrosophic set\nIn neutrosophic environment SV NWA and SV NWG, the most well known aggregation operators, are the extension of WAM and WGM of classical algebra.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n147\n5.1.1 Definition I\nLet Ai = (TAi(x), IAi(x), FAi(x)) (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be a collection of SVNSs. A mapping Fw : SV NS\nn → SV NS is called single valued neutrosophic weighted averaging operator of dimension n if it satisfies Fw(A1, A2, . . . , An) = ∑n i=1wiAi, where w = (w1, w2, . . . , wn) T is the weight vector of Ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , n), wi ∈ [0, 1]\nand ∑ wi = 1.\n5.1.2 Definition II\nLet Ai = (TAi(x), IAi(x), FAi(x)) (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be a collection of SVNSs. A mapping Fw : SV NS\nn → SV NS is called SVNG operator of dimension n if it satisfies Fw(A1, A2, . . . , An) = ∏n i=1A wi i .\n5.2 Extension of proposed aggregation operator in neutrosophic set\nLet Ai = (TA(i), IA(i), FA(i)) (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be a collection of SVNSs. Then we define improved single valued weighted averaging geometric (ISVWAG) operator as\nISVWAG(A1, A2, . . . , An) = n∑ i=1 A 1 2 i wi n∏ i=1 A wi 2 i (6)\n5.2.1 Properties\nLet Ai = (TAi(x), IAi(x), FAi(x)) (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be a collection of SVNSs. Then the aggregated result of the ISV NWAG operator is also a single valued neutrosophic number (SVNN) and satisfies the desired properties of an aggregation operator. To prove the properties we first prove a lemma.\n5.2.2 Lemma 1\nLet A1 = (TA1(x), IA1(x), FA1(x)), A2 = (TA2(x), IA2(x), FA2(x)), B1 = (TB1(x), IB1(x), FB1(x)), B2 = (TB2(x), IB2(x), FB2(x)) are SVNNs such that A1 ⊇ B1, A2 ⊇ B2. Then (A1 + A2) ⊇ (B1 + B2). i.e., (TA1 + TA2 − TA1TA2) ≥ (TB1 + TB2 − TB1TB2), (IA1 + IA2 − IA1IA2) ≤ (IB1 + IB2 − IB1IB2), (FA1 + FA2 − FA1FA2) ≤ (FB1 + FB2 − FB1FB2).\n148\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\nProof: Let X be the universe. For each point x ∈ X, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) ∈ [0, 1]. Now it is given that A1 ⊇ B1, A2 ⊇ B2, i.e., for each value of x ∈ X, TA1(x) ≥ TB1(x) and TA2(x) ≥ TB2(x). Let x1 be an arbitrary point in X. So TA1(x1) ≥ TB1(x1) and TA2(x1) ≥ TB2(x1). Also TA1(x1), TA2(x1), TB1(x1), TB2(x1) ∈ [0, 1]. cosx for x ∈ [0, π\n2 ] is a continuous function. i.e., cos x assumes every value in\n[0, 1]. So we can consider TA1(x1) = cosφ1, TA2(x1) = cosφ2, TB1(x1) = cos θ1, TB2(x1) = cos θ2, for some φ1, φ2, θ1, θ2 ∈ [0, π2 ]. Now TA1(x1)+TA2(x1)−TA1(x1)TA2(x1) = cosφ1+cosφ2−cosφ1 cosφ2 = cosφ1+ (1 − cosφ1) cosφ2 = 1 − 2 sin2 φ12 + 2 sin 2 φ1 2\ncosφ2 = 1 − 2 sin2 φ12 (1 − cosφ2) = 1− 2 sin2 φ1\n2 .2 sin2 φ2 2 = 1− 4 sin2 φ1 2 sin2 φ2 2 .\nSimilarly, TB1(x1) + TB2(x1)− TB1(x1)TB2(x1) = 1− 4 sin2 θ12 sin 2 θ2 2 . Since TA1(x1) ≥ TB1(x1), TA2(x1) ≥ TB2(x1), cosφ1 ≥ cos θ1. i.e., − cosφ1 ≤ − cos θ1, 1 − cosφ1 ≤ 1 − cos θ1, i.e., 2 sin2 φ12 ≤ 2 sin2 θ1\n2 .\nSimilarly, 2 sin2 φ2 2 ≤ 2 sin2 θ2 2 . i.e., 4 sin2 φ1 2 sin2 φ2 2 ≤ 4 sin2 θ1 2 sin2 θ2 2 . i.e., 1− 4 sin2 φ1 2 sin2 φ2 2 ≥ 1− 4 sin2 θ1 2 sin2 θ2 2 . i.e.,\nTA1(x1) + TA2(x1)− TA1(x1)TA2(x1) ≥ TB1(x1) + TB2(x1)− TB1(x1)TB2(x1) (7)\nSince (7) is true for any x1 ∈ X, TA1(x) + TA2(x) − TA1(x)TA2(x) ≥ TB1(x) + TB2(x)− TB1(x)TB2(x). So it has been shown that TA1 ≥ TB1 and TA2 ≥ TB2 imply [TA1 +TA2−TA1TA2 ] ≥ [TB1 + TB2 − TB1TB2 ]. In the same way, IA1 ≤ IB1 and IA2 ≤ IB2 imply (IA1 + IA2 − IA1IA2) ≤ (IB1 + IB2 − IB1IB2) also FA1 ≤ FB1 and FA2 ≤ FB2 imply (FA1 + FA2 − FA1FA2) ≤ (FB1 + FB2 − FB1FB2). The proof is generic as it is true for each and every value of the truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership functions and does not depend on the types of the functions (triangular, trapezoidal, piecewise linear or Gaussian).\nOn the basis of the basic operations of SVNSs described in subsection 2.3, the value of the truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership function in aggregated result belongs to [0, 1]. So the aggregated operator is also a SVNN. We will prove that the ISV NWAG operator has the following desired properties:\n(1) Idempotency: let Ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be a collection of SVNNs. If all Ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) are equal, that is, Ai = A, for all(i = 1, 2, . . . , n), then ISVWAG(A1, A2, . . . , An) = A\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n149\n(2) Boundedness: Let A− = (TA−(x), IA−(x), FA−(x)), and A+ = (TA+(x), IA+(x), FA+(x)), where TA−(x) = mini TAi(x), IA−(x) = maxi IAi(x), FA−(x) = maxi FAi(x) and TA+(x) = maxi TAi(x), IA+(x) = mini IAi(x), FA+(x) = mini FAi(x). So A\n− ⊆ Ai ⊆ A+ for all (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). Also (TA−(x))0.5wi ≤ (TAi(x))\n0.5wi ≤ (TA+(x))0.5wi, (IA−(x))0.5wi ≥ (IAi(x))0.5wi ≥ (IA+(x))0.5wi and (FA−(x))\n0.5wi ≥ (FAi(x))0.5wi ≥ (FA+(x))0.5wi. So (A−)0.5wi ⊆ (Ai)0.5wi ⊆ (A+)0.5wi. By using lemma 1, ∑n i=1(A −)0.5wi ⊆ ∑n i=1A 1 2 i wi ⊆ ∑n i=1(A\n+)0.5wi, i.e.,\n(A−) 1 2 ⊆ n∑ i=1 A 1 2 i wi ⊆ (A+) 1 2 (8)\nAgain similarly, (A−) wi 2 ⊆ A wi 2 i ⊆ (A+) wi 2 , i.e.,\n(A−) 1 2 ⊆ n∏ i=1 A wi 2 i ⊆ (A+) 1 2 (9)\nFrom (8) T (A−) 1 2 ≤ T∑n\ni=1 A 1 2 i wi ≤ T (A+) 1 2\n(10)\nFrom (9) T (A−) 1 2 ≤ T∏n\ni=1 A wi 2 i\n≤ T (A+) 1 2\n(11)\nMultiplying (10) and (11) we get, TA− ≤ TISVWAG(A1,A2,...,An) ≤ TA+ . similarly, IA− ≥ IISVWAG(A1,A2,...,An) ≥ IA+ and FA− ≥ FISVWAG(A1,A2,...,An) ≥ FA+ . Thus A− ⊆ ISVWAG(A1, A2, . . . , An) ⊆ A+.\n(3) Symmetry or commutativity: The order of the arguments has no influence on the result.

So (Ai) 0.5wi ⊆ (A∗i ) 0.5wi. Therefore from the lemma 1 ∑n i=1A 0.5 i wi ⊆ ∑n i=1(A ∗ i ) 0.5wi and also\nsince ∏n i=1A wi 2 i ⊆ ∏n i=1A ∗ i wi 2 , ISVWAG(A1, A2, . . . , An) ⊆ ISVWAG(A∗1, A∗2, . . . , A∗n).\n150\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n6 GENERALIZATION OF IWAGM AND ITS\nEXTENSION IN NEUTROSOPHIC ENVI-\nRONMENT\nWe formulate a general operator in case of real numbers and extend it to neutrosophic set also. Let a1, a2, . . . , an are n real numbers with associated weights w1, w2, . . . , wn respectively, wi ∈ [0, 1] and ∑ wi = 1. Then we define generalized improved weighted averaging geometric mean (GIWAGM) as\nGIWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) = ( n∑ i=1 a 1 k i wi n∏ i=1 a wi k i ) k/2 (12)\nwhere k is any real number. The equation (12) satisfy the desired properties of aggregation operator:\n(1) Idempotency: let ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be a collection of real numbers. If all ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) are equal, that is, ai = a, for all(i = 1, 2, . . . , n), then GIWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) = (a 1 k ∑n i=1wi ∏n i=1 a wi k )k/2 = a\n(2) Boundedness: If a− = mini ai and a + = maxi ai, ( ∑n\ni=1(a −) 1 kwi ∏n i=1(a −) wi k )k/2 ≤ ( ∑n i=1 a 1 k i wi ∏n i=1 a wi k i ) k/2 ≤ ( ∑n i=1(a +) 1 k\nwi ∏n i=1(a +) wi k )k/2, i.e. a− ≤ GIWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) ≤ a+.\n(3) Symmetry or commutativity: The order of the arguments has no influence on the result. For every permutation σ of 1, 2, . . . , n the operator satisfies GIWAGM(aσ(1), aσ(2), . . . , aσ(n)) = GIWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an)\n(4) Monotonicity :If ai ≤ a∗i for all (i = 1, 2, . . . , n), ( ∑n\ni=1 a 1 k i wi ∏n i=1 a wi k i ) k/2 ≤ ( ∑n i=1(a ∗ i ) 1 kwi ∏n i=1(a ∗ i ) wi k )k/2.\nSo GIWAGM(a1, a2, . . . , an) ≤ GIWAGM(a∗1, a∗2, . . . , a∗n). And for neutrosophic sets let Ai = (TA(i), IA(i), FA(i)) (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be a collection of SVNSs with associated weights w1, w2, . . . , wn respectively, wi ∈ [0, 1] and ∑ wi = 1.. Then we define generalized improved single valued weighted averaging geometric (GISVWAG) operator as\nGISVWAG(A1, A2, . . . , An) = ( n∑ i=1 A 1 k i wi n∏ i=1 A wi k i ) k/2 (13)\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n151\nwhere k is any real number. The equation (13) satisfy the desired properties of aggregation operator:\n(1) Idempotency: let Ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be a collection of SVNNs. If all Ai (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) are equal, that is, Ai = A, for all(i = 1, 2, . . . , n), then ISVWAG(A1, A2, . . . , An) = A\n(2) Boundedness: Let A− = (TA−(x), IA−(x), FA−(x)), and A+ = (TA+(x), IA+(x), FA+(x)), where TA−(x) = mini TAi(x), IA−(x) = maxi IAi(x), FA−(x) = maxi FAi(x) and TA+(x) = maxi TAi(x), IA+(x) = mini IAi(x), FA+(x) = mini FAi(x). So A\n− ⊆ Ai ⊆ A+ for all (i = 1, 2, . . . , n). Also (TA−(x))1/kwi ≤ (TAi(x))\n1/kwi ≤ (TA+(x))1/kwi, (IA−(x))1/kwi ≥ (IAi(x))1/kwi ≥ (IA+(x))1/kwi and (FA−(x))\n1/kwi ≥ (FAi(x))1/kwi ≥ (FA+(x))1/kwi. So (A−)1/kwi ⊆ (Ai)1/kwi ⊆ (A+)1/kwi. By using lemma 1, ∑n i=1(A −)1/kwi ⊆ ∑n i=1A 1/k i wi ⊆ ∑n i=1(A\n+)1/kwi, i.e.,\n(A−)1/k ⊆ n∑ i=1 A 1/k i wi ⊆ (A+)1/k (14)\nAgain similarly, (A−) wi k ⊆ A wi k i ⊆ (A+) wi k , i.e.,\n(A−) 1 k ⊆ n∏ i=1 A wi k i ⊆ (A+) 1 k (15)\nFrom (14) T (A−) 1 k ≤ T∑n\ni=1 A 1 k i wi ≤ T (A+) 1 k\n(16)\nFrom (15) T (A−) 1 k ≤ T∏n\ni=1 A wi k i\n≤ T (A+) 1 k\n(17)\nMultiplying (16) and (17) we get, T (A−) 2 k ≤ T∑n\ni=1 A 1 k i wi T∏n i=1 A wi k i ≤ T (A+) 2 k .\ni.e., TA− ≤ TGISVWAG(A1,A2,...,An) ≤ TA+ . similarly, IA− ≥ IGISVWAG(A1,A2,...,An) ≥ IA+ and FA− ≥ FGISVWAG(A1,A2,...,An) ≥ FA+ . So A − ⊆ GISVWAG(A1, A2, . . . , An) ⊆ A+.\n(3) Symmetry or commutativity: The order of the arguments has no influence on the result. For every permutation σ of 1, 2, . . . , n the operator satisfies GISVWAG(Aσ(1), Aσ(2), . . . , Aσ(n)) = GISVWAG(A1, A2, . . . , An)\n152\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n(4) Monotonicity :Let Ai ⊆ A∗i for all (i = 1, 2, . . . , n), then TAi(x) ≤ TA∗i (x), IAi(x) ≥ IA∗i (x) and FAi(x) ≥ FA∗i (x). i.e., (TAi(x)) 1/kwi ≤ (TA∗i (x)) 1/kwi, (IAi(x)) 1/kwi ≥ (IA∗i (x)) 1/kwi and (FAi(x)) 1/kwi ≥ (FA∗i (x)) 1/kwi. So (Ai) 1/kwi ⊆ (A∗i ) 1/kwi. Therefore from the lemma 1, ∑n i=1A 1/k i wi ⊆ ∑n i=1(A ∗ i ) 1/kwi and also\nsince ∏n i=1A wi k i ⊆ ∏n i=1A ∗ i wi k , GISVWAG(A1, A2, . . . , An) ⊆ GISVWAG(A∗1, A ∗ 2, . . . , A ∗ n).\nNow if we put k = 2, (12) and (13) reduce to (1) and (6) respectively, i.e., the newly proposed operator for real numbers given in (1) is one of the particular cases of generalized operator (12) and similar for the case (6) and (13) also. For different values of k it is possible to study these families individually.\n7 COMPARISON APPROACH\n7.1 Definition [20], [7]\nLet A and B are two SVNN. Then the comparison approach based on score function (s), accuracy function (a) and certainty function (c) is given as follows: (1) If s(A) > s(B), then A > B. (2) If s(A) = s(B) and a(A) > a(B), then A > B. (3) If s(A) = s(B) also a(A) = a(B), but c(A) > c(B), then A > B. (4) If s(A) = s(B), a(A) = a(B) and c(A) = c(B), then A = B.\n7.2 Proposed score and certainty function\nWe introduce a new score function, accuracy function and certainty function to compare neutrosophic fuzzy numbers. According to the definition of score function as defined in [20], the larger the TA is, the greater the neutrosophic number is; the smaller the IA is, the greater the neutrosophic number is and the same holds for FA also. Based on the definition we give a new score function. Let A = (TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)) be a neutrosophic number. The score function of A is given by s(A) = TA(x)(1 + sin(TA(x) π 2 )) + 1 2(1+IA(x)) (cos(IA(x) π 2 )) + 1 1+FA(x) (cos(FA(x) π 2 )). The accuracy function as defined in [7] is a(A) = TA(x)− FA(x). We define a new certainty function c(A) = |cosTA(x)π|+|cosIA(x)π|+|cosFA(x)π|\n3 . In\n[7] Liu et al. gave the formula of score, accuracy function for a SVNN, A, as follows: Score function s1(A) = 2 + TA(x) − IA(x) − FA(x), accuracy function a1(A) = TA(x)− FA(x). With these formulas in [20] Hong-yu Zhang, Jian-qiang\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n153\nWang, and Xiao-hong Chen added certainty function as c1(A) = TA(x). The score function in [7] gives same value when IA(x) and FA(x) of a neutrosophic number is interchanged, i.e., different neutrosophic numbers can exist easily for which the given score function gives same value. For example (0.2, 0.9, 0.1) and (0.2, 0.1, 0.9) have same score function according [7] and [20]. But the newly introduced score function based on trigonometric function does not give same value for these neutrosophic sets. From another point of view as discussed in [5] the uncertainty is maximum (=1) at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), i.e., the certainty should be minimum (=0) at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and the value of certainty increases if we increase or decrease any of truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership grade. But this property is not satisfied by the certainty function given in [20], whereas the newly proposed certainty function in sec 7 gives realistic result.\n7.3 Comparison analysis using different examples\nTable 1: Comparison analysis using different examples Neutrosophic Method Score Accuracy Certainty Ranking numbers value value V alue order A = (0.4, 0.3, 0.2) Existing s1(A) = 1.9 A > B B = (0.4, 0.5, 0.6) s1(B) = 1.3\nProposed s(A) = 1.77 A > B s(B) = 1.23\nA = (1, 0, 1) Existing s1(A) = 2 A > B B = (1, 1, 0.473) s1(B) = 1.527\nProposed s(A) = 2.5 − A < B s(B) = 2.5 a(B) = 0.527\nA = (0.0867, 0.2867, 0.0867) Existing s1(A) = 1.7133 A > B B = (0.3096, 0.5096, 0.0.3096) s1(B) = 1.4904\nProposed s(A) = 1.3599 − c(A) = 0.8491 A > B s(B) = 1.3599 − c(B) = 0.38548\n8 ALGORITHM FOR FINDING OPTIMUM\nALTERNATIVE IN A MULTI-CRITERIA DE-\nCISION MAKING PROBLEM\nLet Ai, (i = 1, 2, . . . ,m) be m alternatives and Cj, (j = 1, 2, . . . , n) are n criteria. Assume that the weight of the criteria Cj(j = 1, 2, . . . , n), given by the decision-maker, is wj, wj ∈ [0, 1] and ∑n j=1wj = 1.

Step 2: calculate the score, accuracy and certainty function to compare the\nneutrosophic number as defined in section 7. Step 3: Rank the alternatives.\n9 NUMERICAL EXAMPLE\nIn a certain network, there are four options to go from one node to the other. Which path to be followed will be impacted by two benefit criteria C1, C2 and one cost criteria C3 and the weight vectors are 0.35, 0.25 and 0.40 respectively. A decision maker evaluates the four options according to the three criteria mentioned above. We compare the proposed method with the existing methods in table 3 using the newly introduced approach to obtain the most desirable alternative from the decision matrix given in table 2.\nTable 2: Decision matrix (information given by DM) c1 c2 c3\nA1 (0.4,0.2,0.3) (0.4,0.2,0.3) (0.2,0.2,0.5) A2 (0.6,0.1,0.2) (0.6,0.1,0.2) (0.5,0.2,0.2) A3 (0.3,0.2,0.3) (0.5,0.2,0.3) (0.5,0.3,0.2) A4 (0.7,0,0.1) (0.6,0.1,0.2) (0.4,0.3,0.2)\n9.1 Comparison of aggregation operators using cosine similarity measure\nTo measure the similarity between two neutrosophic numbers we consider the cosine similarity measure as discussed by Jun Ye in [9] as follows:\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n155\nTable 3: Result Comparison: the proposed method with the existing methods Aggregation Aggregated Score using Score Ranking order Operator Result existing using proposed in both\nmethod formula approach\nSVWA(C (1) 1 , C (1) 2 , C (1) 3 ) s1(A1) = 1.76 s(A1) = 1.46\n= (0.287, 0.187, 0.337)\nSingle valued SVWA(C (2) 1 , C (2) 2 , C (2) 3 ) s1(A2) = 2.14 s(A2) = 2.007 A4 > A2 weighted = (0.462, 0.134, 0.187) > A3 > A1 average SVWA(C (3) 1 , C (3) 2 , C (3) 3 ) s1(A3) = 1.912 s(A3) = 1.716\n= (0.373, 0.222, 0.238)\nSVWA(C (4) 1 , C (4) 2 , C (4) 3 ) s1(A4) = 2.16 s(A4) = 2.03\n= (0.460, 0.142, 0.156)\nSVWG(C (1) 1 , C (1) 2 , C (1) 3 ) s1(A1) = 1.735 s(A1) = 1.450532\n= (0.303143, 0.2, 0.368011)\nSingle valued SVWG(C (2) 1 , C (2) 2 , C (2) 3 ) s1(A2) = 2.22 s(A2) = 2.211256 A4 > A2 weighted = (0.5578, 0.131951, 0.2) > A3 > A1 geometric SVWG(C (3) 1 , C (3) 2 , C (3) 3 ) s1(A3) = 1.92 s(A3) = 1.7845\n= (0.418141, 0.235216, 0.255085)\nSVWG(C (4) 1 , C (4) 2 , C (4) 3 ) s1(A4) = 2.38 s(A4) = 2.2798 = (0.538451, 0, 0.156917)\nISVWAG(C (1) 1 , C (1) 2 , C (1) 3 ) s(A1) = 1.77 s(A1) = 1.44\nImproved = (0.254226, 0.172108, 0.303) single valued ISVWAG(C (2) 1 , C (2) 2 , C (2) 3 ) s1(A2) = 2.14 s(A2) = 1.96 A4 > A2 weighted = (0.432056, 0.118963, 0.17) > A3 > A1 average ISVWAG(C (3) 1 , C (3) 2 , C (3) 3 ) s1(A3) = 1.92 s(A3) = 1.68 geometric = (0.338061, 0.201253, 0.21)\nISVWAG(C (4) 1 , C (4) 2 , C (4) 3 ) s1(A4) = 2.28 s(A4) = 2.03\n= (0.421219, 0, 0.13)\nLet X be the universe and A = {〈xi, TA(xi), IA(xi), FA(xi)〉 /xi ∈ X} and B = {〈xi, TB(xi), IB(xi), FB(xi)〉 /xi ∈ X} are two SVNSs, then cosine similarity measure between A and B is C(A,B) = 1\nn ∑n i=1\nTA(xi)TB(xi)+IA(xi)IB(xi)+FA(xi)FB(xi)√ (TA(xi))2+IA(xi))2+FA(xi))2 √ (TB(xi))2+IB(xi))2+FB(xi))2\nUsing the similarity measure formula comparison of aggregation operators are given in table 4:\n9.2 Result discussion\nThe results given in table 4 show that all the aggregated results are more or less close to the corresponding maximum weighted neutrosophic number as similarity measure values are nearer to 1.

We proved that the result using this operator always lies between WAM and WGM operator and the result will be meaningful in all the cases. Then we extended the operator in neutrosophic environment and it has also been shown that the extended operator (ISVWAG) gives meaningful result in neutrosophy. Next we introduced a trigonometric function based score function. Further we proposed a certainty function as well which gives realistic results comparison to the existing ones. A numerical problem has been solved using the proposed operator and the newly defined score function.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors are very grateful to Florentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik and Pranab Biswas for their insightful and constructive comments and suggestions, which have been very helpful in improving the paper.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n157\nReferences\n[1] Florentin Smarandache, Neutrosophy/Neutrosophic Probability, Set and Logic, Amer.

However fuzzy set cannot deal with the indeterminacy involving with the problem. So the concept of single – valued neutrosophic set due to Wang et al. (2010) is very helpful to deal with the problem. A neutrosophic approach is a more general and suitable approach in order to deal with neutrosophic information than fuzzy set. Logistics center location selection is a multi-criteria decision making process involving subjectivity, impresion and fuzziness that can be easily represented by single-valued neutrosophic sets. In this paper, we use the score and accuracy function and hybrid score accuracy function of single- valued neutrosophic number and ranking method for single- valued neutrosophic numbers to model logistics center location problem. Finally, a numerical example has been presented to illustrate the proposed approach.\nKeywords Logistic center, multi-criteria group decision making, hybrid score-accuracy function, single valued neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic number.\n1. Introduction Logistics systems have become essential for economic development and the normal function of the society, and suitable site selection for the logistics center has direct impact on the efficiency of logistics systems. So it is necessary to adopt a scientific approach for site selection. The logistic center location selection problem can be considered as multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. Classical MCDM [1, 2, 3] problems deal with crisp numbers that is the ratings and the weights of the criteria are represented by crisp numbers. However, it is not always possible to present the information by crisp numbers. In order to deal this situation fuzzy set (FS) introduced by Zadeh [4] in 1965 can be used. It is very useful for many real life problems involving\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n162\nuncertainty. In 1986, Atanassov [5] grounded the notion of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) by introducing non-membership function as independent component. However, it cannot handle indeterminacy part of the real life problems that exist in many real applications. Then in 1998, Smarandache proposed the neutrosophic set (NS) theory [6,7, 8, 9] which is the generalization of FS and IFS.\nFrom scientific or engineering point of view, the neutrosophic set and set- theoretic view, operators need to be specified. Otherwise, it will be difficult to apply in the real applications. Therefore, Wang et al. [10] defined a single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) and then provided the set theoretic operations and various properties of SVNS. The works on SVNS and their hybrid structure in theories and application have been progressing rapidly. Hence it is most important to conduct researches on MCDM approach based on SVNS environment. Biswas et al. [11] presented entropy based grey relational analysis method for multi-attribute decision making under SVNS. Ye [12] proposed the co-relation co-efficient of SVNSs for single-valued neutrosophic MCDM problem. While selecting the location for the logistics center not only quantitative factors likes costs, distances but also qualitative factors. Such as environmental impacts and governmental regulations should be taken into consideration. Tuzkaya et al. [13] presented an analytic network process approach to deal locating undesirable facilities. Badri [14] studied a method combinjing analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and goal programming model approach for international facility location problem. Chang and Chung [15] proposed a multi-criteria genetic optimization for distibution network problems. Liang and Wang [16] proposed a fuzzy multicriteria decision making method for facility site selection. Chu [17] proposed facility location selection using fuzzy TOPSIS under group decision. Recently, Pramanik and Dalapati [18] presented generalized neutrosophic soft multi criteria decision making based on grey relational analysis by introducing generalized neutrosophic soft weighted average operator. In this paper we present logistic center location model using score and accuracy function and hybrid score accuracy function of singlevalued neutrosophic number due to Ye [19]. Finally, a numerical example has been provided to illustrate the proposed approach.\nRest of the paper has been organized in the following way. Section 2 presents preliminaries of neutrosophic sets and section 3 presents criteria for logistic center location selection. Section 4 is devoted to present modeling of logistic center location seclection problem. Section 5 presents a numerical example of the logistic center location selection problem. In Section 6 we presents conclusion.\n2. Mathematical preliminaries In this section, we will recall some basic definitions and concepts that are useful to develop the paper. Definition 1: Neutrosophic sets [6, 7, 8, 9] Let P be a universe of discourse with a generic element in P denoted by p. A neutrosophic set\nZ in P is characterized by a truth-membership function t Z (p), an indeterminacy-membership function i Z (p) and a falsity-membership function f Z (p) and defined by\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n163\nZ = { p, t Z (p), i Z (p), f Z (p): pP}.The function t Z (p) , i Z (p) and f Z (p) are real standard or nonstandard subsets of ]  0, 1  [ i.e., t Z (p) : P →]  0, 1+ [,\ni Z (u): P →]  0, 1+ [, and f Z (u) : P →]  0, 1+ [ Hence, there is no restriction on the sum of t Z (p), i Z (p) and f Z (p) and  0 ≤ t Z (p) + i Z (p) + f Z (p) ≤ 3+.\nDefinition 2: Single valued neutrosophic sets [10]. Let P be a universe of discourse with a generic element in P denoted by p. A single valued\nneutrosophic set M in P is characterized by a truth-membership function t M (p), an indeterminacy-membership function i M (p) and a falsity-membership function f M (p). It can be expressed as M = {< p, (t M (p), i M (p), f M (p)) >: p ∈ P, t M (p), i M (p), f M (p) ∈ [0, 1]}. It should be noted that there is no restriction on the sum of t M (p), i M (p) and f M (p). Therefore, 0 ≤ t M (p)+ i M (p) + f M (p)≤ 3.\nDefinition 3: Single valued neutrosophic number (SVNN) [19] Let P be a universe of discourse with generic element in P denoted by p. A SVNS M in P is\ncharacterized by a truth-membership function t M (p), a indeterminacy-membership function i M (p) and a falsity-membership function f M (p). Then, a SVNS M can be written as follows: M = {p, t\nM (p), i M (p), f M (p): p P}, where t M (p), i M (p), f M (p)  [0, 1] for each point p in P. Since no restriction is imposed in the sum of t M (p), i M (p) and f M (p), it satisfies 0 ≤ t M (p) + i M (p) + f M (p) ≤3. For a SVNS M in P the triple  t M (p), i M (p), f M (p)  is called single valued neutrosophic number (SVNN).\nDefinition 4: Complement of a SVNS [10] The complement of a single valued neutrosophic set M is denoted by Mand defined as M= {<p: tM(p), iM(p), fM(p)>, p P }, where tM(p)= f M (p), iM(p) = {1} - i M (p),fM(p) = t M (p). For two SVNSs M1 and M2 in P, M1 is contained in the M2, i.e. M1 M2, if and only if t M1 (p) ≤ t M2 (p), i M1 (p) ≥ i M2 (p), f M1 (p) ≥ f M2 (p) for any p in P. Two SVNSs M1 and M2 are equal, written as M1 = M2, if and only if M1  M2 and M2  M1. 2.1. Conversion between linguistic variables and single valued neutrosophic numbers A linguistic variable simply presents a variable whose values are represented by words or sentences in natural or artificial languages. Importance of the decision makers may be differential in the decision making process. Ratings of criteria can be exressed by using linguistic variables such as very poor (VP), poor (P), good (G), very good (VG), excellent (EX), etc. Linguistic variables can be transformed into single valued neutrosophic numbers as given in the Table- 1.\n2.2 Ranking methods for SVNNs Now we recall the definition of the score function, accuracy function, and hybrid score-\naccuracy function of a SVNN, and the ranking method for SVNNs.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n164\nDefinition 5: Score function and accuracy function [19] The score function and accuracy function of the SVNN b= t(b), i(b), f(b)) can be expressed as follows: S(b) = (1+t(b) – f(b))/2 for s(b)  [0, 1] (1) ac(b) = (2 + t(b) – f(b) – i(b))/3 for h(b)  [0, 1] (2) For the score function of a SVNN b, the truth membership t(b) is bigger and the falsitymembership f(b) are smaller, than the score value of the SVNN a is greater. For the accuracy function of a SVNN b if the sum of t(b), 1-i(b) and 1-f(b) is bigger, then the statement is more affirmative, i.e., the accuracy of the SVNN b is higher. Based on score and accuracy functions for SVNNs, two theorems are stated below.\nTheorem 1. For any two SVNNs b1 and b2, if b1 > b2, then s(b1) > s(b2). Proof: See [19]. Theorem 2. For any two SVNNs b1 and b2, if s(b1) = s(b2) and b1 ≥b2, then ac(b1) ≥ ac(b2). Prof: See [19] Based on theorems 1 and 2, a ranking method between SVNNs can be given by the following\ndefinition. Definition 6: [19] Let b1 and b2 be two SVNNs. Then, the ranking method can be defined as follows: 1. If s(b1) > s(b2), then b1 > b2; 2. If s(b1) = s(b2) and ac(b1) ≥ ac(b2), then b1 ≥b2;\n3. Criteria for logistics center location selection We choose the most appropriate location on the basis of six criteria adapted from the study [20], namely, cost (K1), distance to suppliers (K2), dsistance to customers (K3), conformance to governmental regulations and laws (K4), quality of service (K5) and environmental impact (K6).\n4. MCGDM method based on hybrid – score accuracy functions under singlevalued neutrosophic environment\nAssume that B = {B1, …, B n }(n  2) be the set of logistics centers, K = {K1, K2, ..., K  }( \n2) be the set of criteria and E = {E1, E2, ..., Em} (m  2) be the set of decision makers or experts. The weights of the decision makers and criteria are not previously assigned, where the information about the weights of the decision- makers is completely unknown and information about the weights of the criteria is incompletely known in the group decision making problem. In such a case, we develop a method based on the hybrid score – accuracy function for MCDM problem with unknown weights under single-valued neutrosophic environment using linguistic variables. The steps for solving MCGDM by proposed approach have been presented below.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n165\nStep – 1 Formation of the decision matrix In the group decision process, if m decision makers or experts are required in the evaluation process, then the s-th (s = 1, 2,…, m) decision maker can provide the evaluation information of the alternative B i (i = 1, ..., n) on the criterion K j (j = 1, ...,  ) in linguistic variables that can be expressed by the SVNN ( see Table 1). A MCGDM problem can be expressed by the following decision matrix:\nM s = (b sij ) n =\n       \n\n       \n\n\n\n\n\ns n s 2n s n1n\ns 2 s 22 s 212\ns 1 s 12 s 111\n21\nb....bbB .... ... bbbB\nb ...bbB\nK...KK\n(3)\nB sij = { K j , t s Bi (K j ), i s Bi (K j ), f s Bi (K j ) ∕ K j  K} Here 0 ≤ t sBi (K j ) + i s Bi (K j ) + f s Bi (K j ) ≤ 3 t sBi (K j )  [0, 1], i s Bi (K j )  [0, 1], f s Bi (K j )  [0, 1] For s = 1, 2, ..., m, j =1, 2, …  , i = 1, 2, …n, For convenience b sij = t sij , i sij , f sij ) is denoted as a SVNN in the SVNS B sij (s =1, 2, ..., m, i =\n1, ..., n, j = 1, ...,  ) Step – 2 Calculate hybrid score – accuracy matrix The hybrid score – accuracy matrix H s = (h sij ) n (s = 1, 2……, m; i = 1, 2, ..., n; j = 1, 2, …,\n ) can be obtained from the decision matrix M s = (b sij ) n .

When  = 1 the equation (3) reduces to equation (1) and when  = 0, the equation reduces to equation (2).\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n166\nStep – 3 Calculate the average matrix Form the obtained hybrid-score–accuracy matrix, the average matrix H*= (h *ij ) n (s =1, 2, ..., m; i = 1, 2, ..., n; j = 1, 2, ...,  ) is\nexpressed by H* = (h *ij ) n =\n        \n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnn hh\nhhB\nhhh\nK\n....hB\n......\nh\n...B\nK......K\n2n1n\n222212\n112111\n21\n(6)\nHere h *ij = m 1 ∑ ms 1 (h sij ) (7)\nYe [19] defined the collective correlation co-efficient between H s (s = 1, 2, ..., m) and H* as\nfollows.\ns =  n\ni 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n1 2* 1 2\n* 1\n)()( j ijj s ij\nijj s ij\nhh\nhh (8)\nStep – 4 Determination decision maker’s weights In decision making situation, the decision makers may exhibit personal biases and offer unduly high or low preference values with respect to their preferred or repugnant objects. In order to deal such cases, very low weights to these false or biased opinions can be assigned. Since the “mean value” reflects the distributing center of all elements of the set, the average matrix H* represents the maximum compromise among all individual decisions of the group. In this sense, a hybrid score accuracy matrix Hs is closer to the average one H*. Then the preference value of the s-th decision maker is closer to the average value and his/her evaluation is more reasonable and more important. Therefore, the weight of the s-th decision maker is bigger. Ye [19] defined weight model for decision maker as follows:\ns =  \n  s m 1s s , 0≤ s ≤ 1, ∑ ms 1 s = 1 for s = 1, 2, . . ., m.

To determine weights of the critria Ye [19] introduced the following optimization model :\nMax \uD835\uDF14 = n 1 Σ ni 1 Σ 1j \uD835\uDF14 j h ij (12)\nSubject to Σ \n1j \uD835\uDF14 j = 1\n\uD835\uDF14 j > 0 Solving the linear programming problem (12), the weight vector of the criteria \uD835\uDF14 = (\uD835\uDF14 1, \uD835\uDF14 2, ..., \uD835\uDF14 n )T can be easily determined.\nStep 7 Ranking of alternatives In order to rank alternatives, all values can be summed in each row of the collective hybrid score-accuracy matrix corresponding to the criteria weights by the overall weight hybrid scoreaccuracy value of each alternative Bi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n):\n)( iB = Σ  1j \uD835\uDF14 j h ij (13)\nBased on the values of )B( i (i = 1, 2, ...., n), we can rank alternatives Bi (i = 1, 2, ..., n) in descending order and choose the best alternative.\nStep – 8 End\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n168\n5. Example of the Logistics Center Location Selection Problem Assume that a new modern logistic center is required in a town. There are four location B1 , B2 , B3 , B4. A committee of four decision makers or experts namely, E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 has been formed to select the most appropriate location on the basis of six criteria adopted from the study [20], namely, cost (K1), distance to suppliers (K2), distance to customers (K3), conformance to government regulation and laws (K4), quality of service (K5) and environmental impact (K6). Thus the four decision makers use linguistic variables (see Table 1) to rate the alternatives with respect to the criterion and construct the decision matrices ( see Table 2-5) as follows:\nTable 1: Conversion between linguistic variable and SVNNs Linguistic term SVNNs\n1 2 3 4 5\nVery Poor(VP) Poor (P) Good (G) Very Good (VG) Excellent (EX)\n(.05,.95,.95) (.25,.75,.75) (.50,.50,.50) (.75,.25,.25) (.95,.05,.05)\nTable 2: Decision matrix for E1 in the form of linguistic term.\nBi K1 K2 K3 K4 K5 K6\nB1 VG EX VG G G P\nB2 VG G G EX VG VG\nB3 G EX EX G VG G\nB4 EX VG G EX VG VG\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n169\nTable 3: Decision matrix for E2 in the form of linguistic term.\nBi K1 K2 K3 K4 K5 K6\nB1 VG VG VG G VG P\nB2 EX VG VG VG P P\nB3 P EX EX VG G G\nB4 G G EX VG EX EX\nTable 4: Decision matrix for E3 in the form of linguistic term.\nBi K1 K2 K3 K4 K5 K6\nB1 VG VG EX VG VG G\nB2 EX G EX VG EX VG\nB3 P EX EX VG G VG\nB4 G G VG EX EX EX\nTable 5: Decision matrix for E4 in the form of linguistic term.

Educational institutions are working in an increasingly competitive environment as many studies in elearning are implemented under complete information, while in the real world many uncertainty aspects do exist. This has resulted in emerging various approaches to handle uncertainty. Neutrosophic logic has been used to overcome the uncertainty of concepts that are associated with human expert judgments. This paper presents current trends to enhance elearning process by using neutrosophic to extract useful knowledge for selecting, evaluating, personalizing, and adapting elearning process.\nKeywords E-learning, neutrosophic logic, neutrosophic logic based systems.\n1. Introduction The word uncertainty is dealing with vague data, incomplete information, and imprecise knowledge regardless of what is the reason [1]. One of the significant problems of artificial intelligence is modeling uncertainty for solving real life situations [2]. Previous researches presented various models that handle uncertainty by simulating the process of human thinking [3,4]. Managing uncertainties is a goal for decision makers including indefinite cases where it is not true or false [5]. This leads to emerging approaches such as fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy, vague and neutrosophic models to give better attribute interpretations. Fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy, and vague models are limited as they cannot represent contradiction which are a feature of human thinking [6].\nSmarandache [7] proposed neutrosophic logic as an extension of fuzzy logic of which variable x is described by triple values x= (t, i, f) where t is the degree of truth, f is the degree of false and i is the level of indeterminacy. Neutrosophic logic is capable to deal with contradictions which are true and false as the sum of components any number between 0 and 3+. An example of neutrosophic logic is as following; the argument \"Tomorrow it will be sunny\" does not mean a constant-valued\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n178\ncomponents structure; this argument may be 60% true, 40% indeterminate and 35% false at a time; but at in a second time may change at 55% true, 40% indeterminate, and 45 % false according to new indications, provenances, etc. [8].\nThe usage of elearning has been increased in the last recent years in which learners have started using smart devices to access eLearning content. Also many elearning applications have been emerged to support universities in spreading educational resources to the learners [9]. Previous studies [10] in e-learning are implemented under complete information, while the real environment has uncertainty aspects. That is why traditional evaluation methods may not be virtuous. This leads us to suggest neutrosophic logic to give better attribute interpretations to enhance elearning.\nConsidering the above facts, this paper is organized as follows: Related work is described in Section 2. In Section 3, the need and outcome of using neutrosophic logic is discussed. Section 4 gives the trends and challenges of applying Neutrosophic to elearning.\n2. Related Work Neutrosophy is originated from \"neuter\" and \"Sophia\". Neuter means neutral in Latin and Sophia means wisdom in Greek. Neutrosophy means neutral thought knowledge [7]. Neutrosophic Logic was developed to represent mathematical model of uncertainty including vagueness, ambiguity, imprecision, and inconsistency. Expert systems, decision support system, belief system, and information fusion tend to depend not only on truth value, but also on false and indeterminacy values. So current systems which are dedicated to simulate human brain are constrained with strict conditions, whereas, Neutrosophic logic has its chance to simulate human thinking and to be utilized for real environment executions [8].\nAggarwal et al. in 2010 [11] propose block diagram of neutrosophic inference system to illustrate designing of neutrosophic classifier which is more flexible to get more accurate results. Aggarwal et al. in 2011 [12] suggest the possibility of extending the capabilities of the fuzzy systems by applying neutrosophic systems and incorporating neutrosophic logic in medical domain. Vagueness, imprecision, ambiguity, and inconsistency, should be presented in medical systems as medical diagnosis depends on available data and expert recognition, and avoiding uncertainty leads to misplaced accurate interpretation. Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps (NCM) for investigating the effect of critical factors of breast cancer is presented in [13]. A neutrosophic lung segmentation method was developed by [14] to improve the expectation-maximization analysis and morphological operations for our computer-aided detection segmentation. This method facilitates image analysis tasks and computer aided applications for lung abnormalities and improve the accuracy of lung segmentation, mostly for the cases affected by lung diseases.\nNeutrosophic is used in many multiple criteria decision-making problems in real life such as personal choice in academia, project assessment, supplier selection, industry systems, and others areas of management systems [15] [16] [17] to support taking a correct decision from the available alternatives in uncertain environment. Researchers tend to use neutrosophic sets in various decision making applications as traditional crisp multiple criteria decision-making methods are not enough to handle uncertainty in real world cases because of the ambiguity of people thinking, it is more reasonable to simulate human thinking with handling contradictions which are true and false\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n179\nat the same time [18]. In 2016, Ye [19] suggests computation of trust value by integrating a neutrosophic logic with the proposed fuzzy based trust model that considers all the factors affecting the trust in ecommerce. As traditional models of trust fall in representing the indeterminacy values involved while capturing the perception of human. As it is concluded that imprecision of systems could be due to the deficiency of knowledge that received from human in the real world.\nA proposed social Learning Management System (LMS) that integrates social activities in elearning, and utilize a new set theory called the neutrosophic set to analyze social networks data conducted through learning activities is presented in [20]. A new approach based on neutrosophy is presented to provide better interpretation of the assessment results of the e-learning systems that are described by uncertainty aspects [21].\nAnother study [22] concerns the importance of social networks in e-learning systems. Recommender system has a significant role in e-learning as it supports e-learners in choosing among different learning objects and activities using different algorithms: C4.5, K-Means, support vector machine, and Apriori algorithms.\nNeutrosophic sets [23] is proposed in order to evaluate the quality of learning objects based on the multi-criteria approach. Neutrosophic way of thinking help experts to represent their opinion in degrees of truth, false, and indeterminacy.\n3. Outcomes of using Neutrosophic Logic Neutrosophic idea is based on indeterminacy set that can deal with vagueness, imprecision; ambiguity and inconsistent information existing in real world. An example of neutrosophic problems is as follows: a vote with three symbols which are A, B and D ballots is occurred, in which some votes are indistinct, and it can’t be determined if it is A, B or D. These indeterminate votes can be expressed with neutrosophic logic.\nTherefore, indeterminacy can be handled by neutrosophic logic while other approaches neglect this point [7].\nFuzzy sets represent the membership without expressing the corresponding degree of nonmembership so it provides an imperfect expression of uncertain information. The degree of nonmembership in fuzzy sets is the complement of membership for fuzzy sets, Therefore the nonmembership is not independent.\nIntuitionistic fuzzy sets, as well as vague sets, are suitable in simulating the impreciseness of human understanding in decision making by representing degree of membership and nonmembership, but it also cannot express indeterminacy degree which is the ignorance value between truth and false.\nIndeterminate can be handled by neutrosophic logic which has the truth, indeterminacy and false membership functions as shown in Table 1[6].\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n180\nTable 1. Multivalued Logic Membership Function\nA better understanding of the need and the outcome of using neutrosophic logic is presented in this section. The uncertainties types include vagueness, imprecision, ambiguity, and inconsistency. Vagueness when available information is normally having a degrees of attribute; for example: \"This man is nearly tall\". Imprecision when information is not a definite value; for example: \"The student performance for a task is between 80-85% \". when available information has more than one meaning or refer to more than one subject; for example: \"The flower color may be yellow or red\". Inconsistency when obtainable information is conflicted or contradicted; for example:\"the chance of raining tomorrow is 80%”, it does not mean that the chance of not raining is 20%, since there might be hidden weather factors that is not aware of.\nFuzzy set describes vagueness, Intuitionistic fuzzy set is an extension of fuzzy sets which describes vagueness and imprecision by a range of membership values. Neutrosophic set describes vagueness, imprecision; ambiguity and inconsistent information that exists in real environment. Therefore, Neutrosophic logic handles indeterminacy of information while other approaches neglect this point.\nNeutrosophic Vague Intuitionistic Fuzzy Fuzzy set\nDegree of membership\nfunction, indeterminacy and non-membership\nfunction\nDegree of membership\nfunction and nonmembership\nfunction\nDegree of membership\nfunction and nonmembership\nfunction\nDegree of belonging\nM em\nbe rs\nhi p\nFu nc\ntio n\nFigure 4.\nNeutrosophic Set [11]\nFigure 3.

Challenges and Trends of Neutrosophic Applications in E-learning In the recent years, there has been increasing demand in incorporating of new technologies into educational processes. Effectiveness of elearning becomes a big challenge as elearning process is currently conducted in highly controlled way. Elearning challenges can be categorized according to their focus into: individual, course, technology and contextual as shown in Figure 5[9]. It is expected that neutrosophic logic utilized for enhancing eLearning environment as following:\nFigure 5. E-Learning Challenges\n4.1 Neutrosophic Cognitive Map for E-learning Success Factors According to the researchers’ insights in the matter, elearning offer advantages over the traditional learning methods. The study of critical success factors helps decision makers to extract from the learning process the core activities that are essential for success. The investigation of the success factors from different perspectives such as learner's, instructor's and organization is needed [25]. Previous researches presented fuzzy cognitive maps and intuitionistic fuzzy logic by considering the expert’s hesitancy in the determination of the relations between the concepts of a domain [26]. Further studies are needed to analyze and build a neutrosophic cognitive map for modelling critical success factors in elearning. Neutrosophic cognitive map extends the aggregation of the information from different resources under uncertain environment.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n182\n4.2 Neutrosophic Multi-Criteria Decision Making Methods for Elearning Software Selection There are hundreds of elearning software available in the marketplace. Selecting the most suitable elearning that meets specific requirements is a problem of decision making. Many studies in elearning selection are implemented under complete information, while in the real world many uncertainty aspects do exist. As these systems were described by decision makers with vague, imprecise, ambiguous and inconsistent terms, it is understandable that traditional multi criteria decision making methods may not be effective [27] [28]. Further studies deal with presenting a hybrid neutrosophic multi criteria decision making method to handle indeterminacy of information.\n4.3 Neutrosophic Expert System for Evaluating E-learning Applications Expert system aims to represent the problem of uncertainty in knowledge to draw conclusion with the same level of accuracy as would a human expert do. Different evaluation models for elearning quality attributes developed under the condition of the availability of complete information. Real environment is characterized by vagueness, imprecision, ambiguity, and inconsistency information, this problem leads researchers to use approaches that deals with uncertainty like fuzzy logic, intuitionistic fuzzy logic. This section suggests neutrosophic expert system for evaluation of elearning applications [6], [29].\n4.4 Neutrosophic Logic Based System for E-learning Personalization Generating the content according to learner's intellect is a current challenge in e-learning systems. Most of the e-learning systems evaluate the learner’s intellect level according to tests crisp responses that are taken during the learning process. However, many factors lead to uncertainty about the evaluation process. Further work will present a novel approach using neutrosophic logic to build an intelligent system that handles imprecision, vagueness, ambiguity, and inconsistence information about the learner’s assessment to personalize the learning material according to learner’s level is needed [30].\n4.5 Adaptive test sheet generation in e-learning Successful test sheet refers to the ability of questions to check the learner's cognitive skills in the most efficient manner. Designing and developing a test assignment for an adaptive e-learning system depends on organization of questions, concept, activity and learner level. Test adaptation can be done by utilizing one of learning styles models like Myers Brigs Type Indicator, Bloom’s Taxonomy, and David Kolb’s Model e-test classify in an e-learning environment. Adaptive test works toward providing electronic test sheet generation according to learner’s style in a customized surroundings. The incorporation of neutrosophic logic and learning style model provides a suitable way of assessment that has an important role in enhancing learner recognition, and performance. Traditional test includes questions with different difficulty levels to get the overall view about the learner’s ability despite of adaptive test that designed to ensure that learner is above a special ability value as it includes questions with definite difficulty level [31].\n5. Conclusion With the major changes in e-learning technology, there is a need to take into considerations the current trends and challenges of neutrosophic logic in elearning to add benefits to learners.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n183\nThe chapter presents recent challenges and trends in neutrosophic applications. The neutrosophic logic has many achievements in different applications such as medical, decision making, ecommerce, and elearning. The outcome of neutrosophic logic is handling different uncertainty types vagueness, imprecision; ambiguity and inconsistent information exist in real world. Therefore, human thinking indeterminacy can be handled by neutrosophic logic while other approaches neglect this point. Furthermore, the study provides insights of neutrosophic applications challenges and trends in elearning. Future work will deal with talent elearning system to recommend training courses suitable for learner's talent in which neutrosophic is needed to identify learner’s needs and skills. The integration of talent management and elearning system, improve the learner’s task related skills.\nReferences 1. Uusitalo, L., Lehikoinen, A., Helle, I., & Myrberg, K. (2015).

We apply the concept of single valued neutrosophic sets, an instance of neutrosophic sets, to graphs. We introduce certain types of single valued neutrosophic graphs (SVNG) and investigate some of their properties with proofs and examples.\nKeywords\nSingle valued neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic graph, strong single valued neutrosophic graph, constant single valued neutrosophic graph, complete single valued neutrosophic graph.\n1. Introduction Neutrosophic sets (NSs) proposed by Smarandache [12, 13] is a powerful mathematical tool for dealing with incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent information in real world. they are a generalization of the theory of fuzzy sets [24], intuitionistic fuzzy sets [21, 23] and interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets [22]. The neutrosophic sets are characterized by a truth-membership function (t), an indeterminacy-membership function (i) and a falsity-membership function (f) independently, which are within the real standard or nonstandard unit interval ]−0, 1+[. In order to practice NS in real life applications conveniently, Wang et al. [16] introduced the concept of a single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNS), a subclass of the neutrosophic sets. The SVNS is a generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, in which three membership functions are independent and their value belong to the unit interval [0, 1]. Some more work on single valued neutrosophic sets and their extensions may be found on [2, 3, 4, 5,15, 17, 19, 20, 27, 28, 29, 30].\nGraph theory has now become a major branch of applied mathematics and it is generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics. Graph is a widely used tool for solving a combinatorial problem in different areas such as geometry, algebra, number theory, topology, optimization, and computer science. Most important thing which is to be noted is that, when we have uncertainty regarding either the set of vertices or edges or both, the model becomes a fuzzy graph.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n188\nLots of works on fuzzy graphs and intuitionistic fuzzy graphs [6, 7, 8, 25, 27] have been carried out and all of them have considered the vertex sets and edge sets as fuzzy and /or intuitionistic fuzzy sets. But, when the relations between nodes (or vertices) in problems are indeterminate, the fuzzy graphs and intuitionistic fuzzy graphs are failed. For this purpose, Samarandache [9, 10, 11, 14, 34] have defined four main categories of neutrosophic graphs, two based on literal indeterminacy (I), which called them; I-edge neutrosophic graph and I-vertex neutrosophic graph, these concepts are studied deeply and has gained popularity among the researchers due to its applications via real world problems [1, 33, 35]. The two others graphs are based on (t, i, f) components and called them; The (t, i, f)-Edge neutrosophic graph and the (t, i, f)-vertex neutrosophic graph, these concepts are not developed at all. In the literature the study of single valued neutrosophic graphs (SVN-graph) is still blank, we shall focus on the study of single valued neutrosophic graphs in this paper.\nIn this paper, some certain types of single valued neutrosophic graphs are developed and some interesting properties are explored.\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section, we mainly recall some notions related to neutrosophic sets, single valued neutrosophic sets, fuzzy graph and intuitionistic fuzzy graph relevant to the present work. See especially [6, 7, 12, 13, 16] for further details and background.\nDefinition 2.1 [12]. Let X be a space of points (objects) with generic elements in X denoted by x; then the neutrosophic set A (NS A) is an object having the form A = {< x: TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)>, x ∈ X}, where the functions T, I, F: X→]−0,1+[ define respectively the a truth-membership function, an indeterminacy-membership function, and a falsity-membership function of the element x ∈ X to the set A with the condition:\n−0 ≤ TA(x)+ IA(x)+ FA(x)≤ 3+. (1)\nThe functions TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) are real standard or nonstandard subsets of ]−0,1+[. Since it is difficult to apply NSs to practical problems, Wang et al. [16] introduced the concept of a SVNS, which is an instance of a NS and can be used in real scientific and engineering applications.\nDefinition 2.2 [16]. Let X be a space of points (objects) with generic elements in X denoted by x. A single valued neutrosophic set A (SVNS A) is characterized by truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy-membership function IA(x), and a falsity-membership function FA(x). For each point x in X TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) ∈ [0, 1]. A SVNS A can be written as\nA = {< x: TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)>, x ∈ X} (2) Definition 2.3[6]. A fuzzy graph is a pair of functions G = (σ, µ) where σ is a fuzzy subset of a non empty set V and μ is a symmetric fuzzy relation on σ. i.e σ: V → [ 0,1] and\nμ: VxV→[0,1] such that μ(uv) ≤ σ(u) ⋀ σ(v) for all u, v ∈ V where uv denotes the edge between u and v and σ(u) ⋀ σ(v) denotes the minimum of σ(u) and σ(v). σ is called the fuzzy vertex set of V and μ is called the fuzzy edge set of E.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n189\nFigure 1: Fuzzy Graph\nDefinition 2.4 [6]. The fuzzy subgraph H = (τ, ρ) is called a fuzzy subgraph of G = (σ, µ)\nIf τ(u) ≤ σ(u) for all u ∈ V and ρ (u, v) ≤ μ(u, v) for all u, v ∈ V. Definition 2.5 [7]. An Intuitionistic fuzzy graph is of the form G = (V, E) where\ni. V={v1, v2,…., vn} such that \uD835\uDF071: V→ [0,1] and \uD835\uDEFE1: V → [0,1] denote the degree of membership and nonmembership of the element vi ∈ V, respectively, and 0 ≤ \uD835\uDF071(vi) + \uD835\uDEFE1(vi)) ≤ 1 for every vi ∈ V, (i = 1, 2, ……. n),\nii. E ⊆ V x V where \uD835\uDF072: VxV→[0,1] and \uD835\uDEFE2: VxV→ [0,1] are such that\n\uD835\uDF072(vi, vj) ≤ min [\uD835\uDF071(vi), \uD835\uDF071(vj)] and \uD835\uDEFE2(vi, vj) ≥ max [\uD835\uDEFE1(vi), \uD835\uDEFE1(vj)]\nand 0 ≤ \uD835\uDF072(vi, vj) + \uD835\uDEFE2(vi, vj) ≤ 1 for every (vi, vj) ∈ E, (i, j = 1,2, ……. n)\nFigure 2: Intuitionistic Fuzzy Graph\nDefinition 2.6 [31].

In this case, # and ' are said to be neighbours and ( #, ') is incident at # and ' also. Definition 3.7. A path P in a single valued neutrosophic graph G= (A, B) is a sequence of distinct vertices F , , ,… G such that ( #H , #) > 0, ( #H , #) > 0 and ( #H , #) > 0 for 0 ≤i ≤ 1. Here n ≥ 1 is called the length of the path P. A single node or vertex # may also be considered as a path. In this case the path is of the length (0, 0, 0). The consecutive pairs ( #H , #) are called edges of the path. We call P a cycle if F= G and n ≥3. Definition 3.8. A single valued neutrosophic graph G= (A, B) is said to be connected if every pair of vertices has at least one single valued neutrosophic path between them, otherwise it is disconnected.\nDefinition 3.9. A vertex v ∈ V of single valued neutrosophic graph G= (A, B) is said to be an isolated vertex if there is no effective edge incident at v .\nFigure 7: Example of single valued neutrosophic graph In figure 7, the single valued neutrosophic vertex v is an isolated vertex. Definition 3.10. A vertex in a single valued neutrosophic G= (A, B) having exactly one neighbor is called a pendent vertex. Otherwise, it is called non-pendent vertex. An edge in a single valued neutrosophic graph incident with a pendent vertex is called a pendent edge. Otherwise it is called non-pendent edge.

Definition 3.13. Let G= (A, B) be a single valued neutrosophic graph. Then the degree of any vertex v is sum of degree of truth-membership, sum of degree of indeterminacymembership and sum of degree of falsity-membership of all those edges which are incident on vertex v denoted by d(v)= (Z[( ), Z\\( ), Z]( )) where Z[( )=∑ (_, )`ab denotes degree of truth-membership vertex.Z\\( )=∑ (_, )`ab denotes degree of indeterminacy-membership vertex.Z]( )=∑ (_, )`ab denotes degree of falsity-membership vertex. Example 3.14. Let us consider a single valued neutrosophic graph G= (A, B) of !∗ = (V, E) where V = {v , v , v , v } and E= {v v , v v , v v , v v }.\nWe have, the degree of each vertex as follows: Z(v )= ( 0.3, 0.5, 0.9), Z(v )= ( 0.5, 0.6, 0.8), Z(v )= ( 0.5, 0.6, 0.9), Z(v )= ( 0.3, 0.5, 1) Definition 3.15. A single valued neutrosophic graph G= (A, B) is called constant if degree of each vertex is k = (c , c , c ). That is, d ( ) = (c , c , c ) for all ∈ V. Example 3.16. Consider a single valued neutrosophic graph G such that V ={v , v , v , v } and E={v v , v v , v v , v v }.\nClearly, G is constant SVN-graph since the degree of 60, 62, 63 and 61 is (0.4, 0.6, 0.8).\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n194\nDefinition 3.17. A single valued neutrosophic graph G = (A, B) of !∗= (V, E) is called strong single valued neutrosophic graph if ( # , ') = min [ ( #), ( ')] ( #, ') = max [ ( #), ( ')] ( # , ') = max [ ( #), ( ')] For all ( # , ') ∈ E. Example 3.18. Consider a graph !∗ such that V= { , , , }, E= { , , , }. Let A be a single valued neutrosophic subset of V and let B a single valued neutrosophic subset of E denoted by\nBy routing computations, it is easy to see that G is a strong single valued neutrosophic of !∗. Proposition 3.19. A single valued neutrosophic graph is the generalization of fuzzy graph\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n195\nProof: Suppose G= (V, E) be a single valued neutrosophic graph. Then by setting the indeterminacy- membership and falsity- membership values of vertex set and edge set equals to zero reduces the single valued neutrosophic graph to fuzzy graph.\nProposition 3.20. A single valued neutrosophic graph is the generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy graph.\nProof: Suppose G = (V, E) be a single valued neutrosophic graph. Then by setting the indeterminacy- membership value of vertex set and edge set equals to zero reduces the single valued neutrosophic graph to intuitionistic fuzzy graph.\nDefinition 3.21. The complement of a single valued neutrosophic graph G (A, B) on !∗ is a single valued neutrosophic graph !̅ on !∗ where: 1. e̅ =A 2. fff( #)= ( #), g ( #)= ( #), fff( #) = ( #), for all ' ∈ V. 3. fff( # , ')= min i ( #), j 'kl - j #, 'k g ( # , ')= max i ( #), j 'kl - j # , 'k and fff( #, ')= max i ( #), j 'kl - j #, 'k, For all ( #, ') ∈ E Remark 3.22. if G= (V, E) is a single valued neutrosophic graph on !∗. Then from above definition, it follow that !̅ g is given by the single valued neutrosophic graph !̅ g =(mf g , nf g ) on!∗ where mf g=V and ffffff( #, ')= min i ( #), j 'kl- j # , 'k, g ( # , ')= min i ( #), j 'kl- j #, 'k,and ffffff( #, ') = min i ( #), j 'kl- j # , 'k For all ( # , ') ∈ E. Thus ffffff = , g = , and ffffff = on V, where E =( , , ) is the single valued neutrosophic relation on V. For any single valued neutrosophic graph G, !̅ is strong single valued neutrosophic graph and G ⊆ !̅. Proposition 3.23. G= !̅ g if and only if G is a strong single valued neutrosophic graph. Proof. it is obvious. Definition 3.24. A strong single valued neutrosophic graph G is called self complementary if G≅ !̅. Where !̅ is the complement of single valued neutrosophic graph G. Example 3.25. Consider a graph !∗ = (V, E) such that V = {v , v , v , v }, E= {v v ,v v , v v , v v }.

Or if G is a complete then in !̅ the edge is empty. Proof\nLet G= (A, B) be a complete SVN-graph.\nSo #'= min ( #, '), #'= max ( #, ') and #'= max ( #, ') for all # , ' ∈ V Hence in !̅, f #'= min i # , 'l − #' for all i, j, ….., n\n= min i #, 'l − min i #, 'l for all i, j,…..,n = 0 for all i, j,…..,n\nand\n̅#'= max i # , 'l − #' for all i, j,…..,n = max i # , 'l − max i # , 'l for all i, j,…..,n\n= 0 for all i, j,…..,n\nAlso f #'= max i # , 'l − #' for all i, j,…..,n = max i # , 'l − max i # , 'l for all i, j,…..,n = 0 for all i, j,…..,n\nThus ( f #', ̅#' , f #') = (0 , 0, 0) Hence, the edge set of !̅ is empty if G is a complete SVN-graph. 4. CONCLUSION Neutrosophic sets is a generalization of the notion of fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Neutrosophic models gives more precisions, flexibility and compatibility to the system as compared to the classical, fuzzy and/or intuitionistic fuzzy models. In this paper, we have introduced certain types of single valued neutrosophic graphs, such as strong single valued neutrosophic graph, constant single valued neutrosophic graph and complete single valued neutrosophic graphs. In future study, we plan to extend our research to regular and irregular single valued neutrosophic graphs, bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, interval valued neutrosophic graphs, strong interval valued neutrosophic, regular and irregular interval valued neutrosophic.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors are greatful to the editor of “Journal of New Theory” for giving permission to publish the article “Single valued neutrosophic graphs.

We introduce the notions of bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, strong bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, complete bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, regular bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs and investigate some of their related properties.\nKeywords Bipolar neutrosophic sets, bipolar single valued neutrosophic graph, strong bipolar single valued neutrosophic graph, complete bipolar single valued neutrosophic graph.\n1. Introduction Zadeh [32] coined the term ‘degree of membership’ and defined the concept of fuzzy set in order to deal with uncertainty. Atanassov [29, 31] incorporated the degree of non-membership in the concept of fuzzy set as an independent component and defined the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy set. Smarandache [12, 13] grounded the term ‘degree of indeterminacy as an independent component and defined the concept of neutrosophic set from the philosophical point of view to deal with incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent information in real world. The concept of neutrosophic sets is a generalization of the theory of fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Each element of a neutrosophic sets has three membership degrees including a truth membership degree, an indeterminacy membership degree, and a falsity membership degree which are within the real standard or nonstandard unit interval]−0, 1+[. Therefore, if their range is restrained within the real standard unit interval [0, 1], the neutrosophic set is easily applied to engineering problems. For this purpose, Wang et al. [17] introduced the concept of a single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) as a subclass of the neutrosophic set. Recently, Deli et al. [23] defined the concept of bipolar neutrosophic as an extension of the fuzzy sets, bipolar fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets and neutrosophic sets studied some of their related properties including the score, certainty and accuracy functions to compare the bipolar neutrosophic sets. The neutrosophic sets theory of and their extensions have been applied in various part [1, 2, 3, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 41, 42, 50, 51, 53].\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n204\nA graph is a convenient way of representing information involving relationship between objects. The objects are represented by vertices and the relations by edges. When there is vagueness in the description of the objects or in its relationships or in both, it is natural that we need to designe a fuzzy graph Model. The extension of fuzzy graph theory [4, 6, 11] have been developed by several researchers including intuitionistic fuzzy graphs [5, 35, 44] considered the vertex sets and edge sets as intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Interval valued fuzzy graphs [32, 34] considered the vertex sets and edge sets as interval valued fuzzy sets. Interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy graphs [8, 52] considered the vertex sets and edge sets as interval valued intuitionstic fuzzy sets. Bipolar fuzzy graphs [6, 7, 40] considered the vertex sets and edge sets as bipolar fuzzy sets. M-polar fuzzy graphs [39] considered the vertex sets and edge sets as m-polar fuzzy sets. Bipolar intuitionistic fuzzy graphs [9] considered the vertex sets and edge sets as bipolar intuitionistic fuzzy sets. But, when the relations between nodes (or vertices) in problems are indeterminate, the fuzzy graphs and their extensions are failed. For this purpose, Samarandache [10, 11] have defined four main categories of neutrosophic graphs, two based on literal indeterminacy (I), which called them; Iedge neutrosophic graph and I-vertex neutrosophic graph, these concepts are studied deeply and has gained popularity among the researchers due to its applications via real world problems [7, 14, 15, 54, 55, 56]. The two others graphs are based on (t, i, f) components and called them; The (t, i, f)-Edge neutrosophic graph and the (t, i, f)-vertex neutrosophic graph, these concepts are not developed at all. Later on, Broumi et al. [46] introduced a third neutrosophic graph model. This model allows the attachment of truth-membership (t), indeterminacy–membership (i) and falsitymembership degrees (f) both to vertices and edges, and investigated some of their properties. The third neutrosophic graph model is called single valued neutrosophic graph (SVNG for short). The single valued neutrosophic graph is the generalization of fuzzy graph and intuitionistic fuzzy graph. Also the same authors [45] introduced neighborhood degree of a vertex and closed neighborhood degree of vertex in single valued neutrosophic graph as a generalization of neighborhood degree of a vertex and closed neighborhood degree of vertex in fuzzy graph and intuitionistic fuzzy graph. Also, Broumi et al. [47] introduced the concept of interval valued neutrosophic graph as a generalization fuzzy graph, intuitionistic fuzzy graph, interval valued fuzzy graph, interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy graph and single valued neutrosophic graph and have discussed some of their properties with proof and examples. In addition Broumi et al [48] have introduced some operations such as cartesian product, composition, union and join on interval valued neutrosophic graphs and investigate some their properties. On the other hand, Broumi et al [49] have discussed a sub class of interval valued neutrosophic graph called strong interval valued neutrosophic graph, and have introduced some operations such as, cartesian product, composition and join of two strong interval valued neutrosophic graph with proofs. In the literature the study of bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs (BSVN-graph) is still blank, we shall focus on the study of bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs in this paper. In the present paper, bipolar neutrosophic sets are employed to study graphs and give rise to a new class of graphs called bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs. We introduce the notions of bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, strong bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, complete bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs,\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n205\nregular bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs and investigate some of their related properties. This paper is organized as follows;\nIn section 2, we give all the basic definitions related bipolar fuzzy set, neutrosophic sets, bipolar neutrosophic set, fuzzy graph, intuitionistic fuzzy graph, bipolar fuzzy graph, N-graph and single valued neutrosophic graph which will be employed in later sections. In section 3, we introduce certain notions including bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, strong bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, complete bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, the complement of strong bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, regular bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs and illustrate these notions by several examples, also we described degree of a vertex, order, size of bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs. In section 4, we give the conclusion.\n2. Preliminaries In this section, we mainly recall some notions related to bipolar fuzzy set, neutrosophic sets, bipolar neutrosophic set, fuzzy graph, intuitionistic fuzzy graph, bipolar fuzzy graph, N-graph and single valued neutrosophic graph relevant to the present work. The readers are referred to [9, 12, 17, 35, 36, 38, 43, 46, 57] for further details and background.\nDefinition 2.1 [12]. Let U be an universe of discourse; then the neutrosophic set A is an object having the form A = {< x: TA(x) , IA(x) , FA(x) >, x ∈ U}, where the functions T, I, F: U→]−0,1+[ define respectively the degree of membership, the degree of indeterminacy, and the degree of non-membership of the element x ∈ U to the set A with the condition:\n−0 ≤ TA(x)+ IA(x)+ FA(x)≤ 3+. (1) The functions TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) are real standard or nonstandard subsets of ]−0,1+[. Since it is difficult to apply NSs to practical problems, Wang et al. [16] introduced the concept of a SVNS, which is an instance of a NS and can be used in real scientific and engineering applications.\nDefinition 2.2 [17]. Let X be a space of points (objects) with generic elements in X denoted by x. A single valued neutrosophic set A (SVNS A) is characterized by truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy-membership function IA(x), and a falsity-membership function FA(x). For each point x in X TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) ∈ [0, 1]. A SVNS A can be written as\nA = {< x: TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)>, x ∈ X} (2) Definition 2.3 [9].

Conclusion In this paper, we have introduced the concept of bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs and described degree of a vertex, order, size of bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs, also we have introduced the notion of complement of a bipolar single valued neutrosophic graph, strong bipolar single valued neutrosophic graph, complete bipolar single valued neutrosophic graph, regular bipolar single valued neutrosophic graph. Further, we are going to study some types of single valued neutrosophic graphs such irregular and totally irregular single valued neutrosophic graphs and bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs.\nAcknowledgement The authors are greatful to the editor of “Journal of New Theory” for giving permission to publish the article “On bipolar single valued neutrosophic graphs.

We proposetwo ways to determine the neutrosophic distance between neutrosophic vertex graphs. The two neutrosophic distances are based on the Haussdorff distance, and a robust modified variant of the Haussdorff distance, moreover we show that they both satisfy the metric distance measure axioms. Furthermore, a similarity measure between neutrosophic edge graphs that is based on a probabilistic variant of Haussdorff distance is introduced. The aim is to use those measures for the purpose of matching neutrosophic graphs whose structure can be described in the neutrosophic domain.\nKeywords Neutrosophic graphs, Haussdorff distance, graph matching.\n1. Introduction Graphs are essential for encoding information, which may serve in several fields ranging from computational biology to computer vision. The notion of graph theory was first introduced by Euler in 1736, given a graph where vertices and edges represent pairwise interactions between entities [2, 5].The past years have witnessed a high development in the areas of the applications of graphs of pattern recognition and computer vision, where graphs are the most powerful and handy tool used in representing both objects and concepts. The invariance properties, as well as the fact that graphs are well suited to model objects in terms of parts and their relations, make them very attractive for various applications. Hence, the theory of graph became an extremely useful tool for solving combinatorial problems in different areas such as geometry, algebra, number theory, topology, operations research, optimization and computer science [1]. In 1975, a fuzzy graph theory as a generalization of Euler's graph theory was introduced by Rosenfeld [7], based on the concepts of fuzzy set theory proposed by Zadeh in 1965 [19].\nIn a world full of indeterminacy, traditional crisp set with its boundaries of truth and false has not infused itself with the ability of reflecting the reality. Therefore, neutrosophic found its place into contemporary research as an alternative representation of the real world Established by Florentin Smarandache [16], Neutrosophy was presented as the study of \"the origin, nature, and scope of neutralities, as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra\". The main idea was to consider an entity ”A” in relation to its opposite ”Non-A”, and to that which is neither \"A”\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n224\nnor” Non-A”, denoted by \"Neut-A”. From then on, Neutrosophy became the basis of Neutrosophic Logic, Neutrosophic Probability, Neutrosophic Set Theory, and Neutrosophic Statistics. According to this theory every idea “A” tends to be neutralized and balanced by ”neut-A” and ”non- A” ideas - as a state of equilibrium. In a classical way “A”, “neut-A”, ”anti-A” are disjoint two by two. But, since in many cases the borders between notions are vague, imprecise or sorties, it is possible that ”A”, ”neut-A” and ”anti-A” have common parts two by two, or even all three of them as well. In [16, 17], Smarandache introduced the fundamental concepts of neutrosophic set, that had led Salama and Smarandache [15], to provide a mathematical treatment for the neutrosophic phenomena which already existed in our real world. Moreover the work of Salama and Smarandache [15, 16, 17] formed a starting point to construct new branches of neutrosophic mathematics. Hence, Neutrosophic set theory turned out to be a generalization of both the classical and fuzzy counterparts.\nIn [6, 11, 12, 13], the authors gave a new dimension for the graph theory using the concept of neutrosophy, some study for different types of neutrosophic graphs were presented and some of their properties were investigated. The aim of this paper is to compute the dissimilarity between two graphs, our methodology is based on the Haussdorff distance, which is invariant to rotation. Whereas several neutrosophic distances where introduced in [4, 14], the authors constructed the neutrosophic distance between neutrosophic sets. The remaining of the paper is structured as follows: definitions of neutrosophic sets and graphs are presented in §2 and §3. Whereas, §4 introduces the idea behind the Haussdorff distance between two crisp sets. In §5.2 and §5.3, we propose two new neutrosophic dissimilarity measures between neutrosophicvertex graphs based on the classical and the modified Haussdorff distances. Furthermore, we investigate the metric axioms for the obtained distances. A neutrosophic similarity measure between neutrosophic edge graphs, based on a probabilistic variant of Haussdorff distance, is introduced in §5.3.\n1. Neutrosophic Sets let X be a space of points (objects), with a generic element in X denoted by x, a neutrosophic set A in X is characterized by a truth-membership function T, a indeterminacy-membership function I and a falsity-membership function F [15, 18], That is: T, I, F: x →] -0, 1+ [.\nWhere T (x), I(x) and F (x) are real standard or non-standard subsets of ]-0, 1+ [. In general if there is no restriction on the sum of T (x), I(x) and F (x), so 0− ≤ T(x) + I (x) + F\n(x) ≤ 3+.T, I, F are called neutrosophic components. In this paper we will restrict our work to use the standard unit interval [0, 1].\n3. Neutrosophic Graphs In [6], the authors defined the neutrosophic graph, to be a graph G < V, E > combined with six mappings, written in the form \uD835\uDC3A\uD835\uDC41 = < \uD835\uDC49, \uD835\uDC38, \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC52, \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC52 , \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC52 , \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63, \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63, \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63 >, where \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63:V→ [0, 1] , \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63 :V→ [0, 1], \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63 :V→ [0, 1] denoting the degree of membership ,degree of indeterminacy and non- membership of the element vi∈V respectively and 0 ≤ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63 (vi) + \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63(vi) + \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63 (vi) ≤ 3 for every vi∈ V, (i = 1, 2, ….. , n) , and\n\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC52: V× V →[0, 1], \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC52: V× V → [0, 1] and \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC52: V× V →[0, 1] are such that \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57) ≤ min(\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57)),\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57) ≤ min(\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57)) and \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57) ≤ min (\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57))\nand 0 ≤ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57)+\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57) +\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , ) ≤ 3 for every (\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57) ∈ E (i, j =1, 2, 3, …., n). The concept of neutrosophic graph was used by several authors; nevertheless they took different\npoints of view when describing the interpretation of graph neutrosophy. We constructed the following structure depending on the one given in [6, 12].\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n225\n3.1. Neutrosophic Edge Graphs: A neutrosophic graph is defined as a graph combined with three mappings, written as \uD835\uDC3A =\n(\uD835\uDC49, \uD835\uDC38 , \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC52, \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC52 , \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC52), \uD835\uDC64ℎ\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC52 \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC52:V× V →[0, 1], \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC52: V× V → [0, 1] and \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC52: V× V →[0, 1] are such that \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57)≤ min (\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57)),\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57)≤ min (\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57)) and \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57) ≤ min (\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57)) and 0≤ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57)+\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57)+\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC52(\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57) ≤ 3 for every (\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57) ∈ E (i , j =1,2,3, …., n).\n3.2. Neutrosophic Vertex Graphs: The term neutrosophic vertex graph was used to definea graphof the form:\n\uD835\uDC3A = (\uD835\uDC49 , \uD835\uDC38 , \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63, \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63 , \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63 ) combined with three mappings, written as \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63:V→ [0, 1], \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63:V→ [0, 1], \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63 :V→ [0, 1] denoting the degree of membership, degree of indeterminacy and nonmembership of the element vi∈ V respectively and 0 ≤ \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63 (vi) + \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63(vi) + \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63 (vi) ≤ 3 for every vi∈ V, (i = 1, 2, ….. , n).\n4. Haussdorff distance Since first introduced by Haussdorff in 1914 [8], the Haussdorff distance has been used in several areas including matching and recognition problems. It provides a means of computing the distance between sets of unordered observations when the correspondences between the individual items are unknown. In its most general setting, the Haussdorff distance measures how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other. It turns the set of non-empty compact subsets of a metric space into a metric space in its own right. Given two such sets, the closest point in the second set for each point in the first set is considered. Hence, the Haussdorff distance is the maximum over all these values. More formally, the classical Haussdorff distance (H D) [4, 10], between two finite point sets A and B is given by: H(A, B) = max(ℎ(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35), ℎ(\uD835\uDC35, \uD835\uDC34)) Where the directed Haussdorff distance from A to B is defined to be:\nℎ(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35) = \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 \uD835\uDC4E∈\uD835\uDC34 \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDC4F∈\uD835\uDC35 ‖\uD835\uDC4E − \uD835\uDC4F‖ And ‖. ‖ is some underlying norm on the points of A and B (e.g., the \uD835\uDC3F2 or Euclidean norm). Regardless of the norm, the Haussdorff metric captures the notion of the worst match between two objects. The computed value is the largest distance between a point in one set and a point in the other one. Several variants of the Haussdorff distance have been proposed as alternatives to the maximum of the minimum approach in the classical one; such as Haussdorff fraction, Haussdorff quintile [10] and Spatially Coherent Matching [3].\nA robust modified Haussdorff distance (MHD) based on the average distance value instead of the maximum value was proposed by Dubuisson and Jain [7], in this sense they defined the directed distance of the MHD as:\n\uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC3B(\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35) = 1\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC34 ∑ min b∈B ‖a − b‖\n\uD835\uDC4E∈A\n5. Neutrosophic Graph Similarity Measures In this section, we introduce neutrosophic graph similarity measures, based on the concept of Haussdorffdistance and some of its variants. Firstly, we propose two new neutrosophic dissimilarity measures based on the classical and the modified Haussdorff distances [4, 6, 14]. Basically the neutrosophic dissimilarity measure is a triple: the first part is a dissimilarity measure of the true value of the neutrosophic object, the second part is a dissimilarity measure of the indeterminate value of the neutrosophic object, and\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n226\nthe third part is a dissimilarity measure of the false value of the neutrosophicobject; that is the opposite of the neutrosophic object. Secondly, we propose a new neutrosophic similarity measure based on the probabilistic Haussdorff distance [9]. With a similar structure, the neutrosophic similarity measure is also a triple as the explained in the neutrosophic dissimilarity measure. Obviously, if the indeterminate part does not exist (its measure is zero) and if the measure of the opposite object is ignored the suggested neutrosophic dissimilarity measure is reduced to the concept of Haussdorff distance in the fuzzy sense. 5.1 NeutrosophicHaussdorff Distance:\nTo commence, we consider two neutrosophic vertex graphs \uD835\uDC3A1 = (\uD835\uDC491 , \uD835\uDC381 , \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC631, \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC631, \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC631) \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC51 \uD835\uDC3A2 = (\uD835\uDC492 , \uD835\uDC382 , \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC632, \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC632 , \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC632 ), where \uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC56, i =1, 2 are the sets of nodes, \uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC56, where i =1,2 are the sets of edges and \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56, where i =1, 2 are the matrices whose elements are the true, indeterminate and false values defined for each element of \uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC56, i = 1, 2, respectively.

This similarity measure works as follows, it commence with finding the maximum probability over the nodes in \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC3C2 then averaging the edge compatibilities over the nodes \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC561. Similarly we consider the maximum probability over the nodes in the graph \uD835\uDC3A2 followed by averaging over the nodes in\uD835\uDC3A1.It worth mentioned here that unlike Neutrosophic Haussdorff distance this similarity measure does not satisfy the distance axioms. Moreover, while the true components of the Neutrosophic Haussdorff distance measures the maximum distance between two sets of observations, our measures here returns the maximum similarity. Back to the rest formulae of the posteriori probability which represent the indeterminacy value and the false value for the match of the \uD835\uDC3A2 edge (I, J) onto the \uD835\uDC3A1 edge (i, j) using similar procedure to the true value.We still need to compute the probabilities\uD835\uDC43((\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC57) → (\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC3D)|\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC522(\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC3D), \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC521(\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC57)),\n\uD835\uDC43 ((\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC57) → (\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC3D)|\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC522(\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC3D), \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC521(\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC57)) and \uD835\uDC43((\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC57) → (\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC3D)|\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC522(\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC3D), \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC521(\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC57)) .

Conclusion and Future Work Graphs are the most powerful and handy tool used in representing objects and concepts. This paper is dedicated for presenting new neutrosophic similarity and dissimilarity measures between neutrosophic graphs. The proposed distance measures are based on the Haussdorff distance, a modified and a probabilistic variant of the Haussdorff distance, additionally we proved that the given Neutrosophic Haussdorff and the Neutrosophic Modified Haussdorff distances satisfy the metric distance measure axioms. The aim is to use those measures for the purpose of matching graphswhose structure is described in the neutrosophic domain.In our plan for the future we will consider using the deduced measurements in image processing applications, such as image clustering and segmentation.\nReferences 1.

This model allows attaching the truth-membership (t), indeterminacy–membership (i) and falsity- membership degrees (f) both to vertices and edges. Combining the interval valued neutrosophic set with graph theory, a new graph model emerges, called interval valued neutrosophic graph. This model generalizes the fuzzy graph, intuitionistic fuzzy graph and single valued neutrosophic graph. In this paper, the authors define operations of Cartesian product, composition, union and join on interval valued neutrosophic graphs, and investigate some of their properties, with proofs and examples.\nKeywords Neutrosophy, neutrosophic set, fuzzy set, fuzzy graph, neutrosophic graph, interval valued neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic graph, interval valued neutrosophic graph.\n1. Introduction The neutrosophy was pioneered by F. Smarandache (1995, 1998). It is a branch of philosophy which studies the origin, nature, and scope of neutralities, as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra. The neutrosophic set proposed by Smarandache is a powerful tool to deal with incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent information in real world, being a generalization of fuzzy set ( Zadeh 1965; Zimmermann 1985), intuitionistic fuzzy set (Atanassov 1986; Atanassov 1999),interval valued fuzzy set (Turksen 1986) and interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (Atanassov and Gargov 1989).The neutrosophic set is characterized by a truth-membership degree (t), an indeterminacy-membership degree (i) and a falsity-membership degree (f) independently, which are within the real standard or nonstandard unit interval ]−0, 1+[. If the range is restrained within the real standard unit interval [0, 1], the neutrosophic set easily applies to engineering problems. For this purpose, Wang et al. (2010) introduced the concept of single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) as a subclass of the neutrosophic set. The same author introduced the notion of interval valued neutrosophic sets (Wang et al. 2005b, 2010) as subclass of neutrosophic sets in which the value of truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership and falsity-membership\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n232\ndegrees are intervals of numbers instead of real numbers. The single valued neutrosophic set and the interval valued neutrosophic set have been applied in a wide variety of fields, including computer science, engineering, mathematics, medicine and economics (Ansari 2013a, 2013b, 2013c;Aggarwal 2010;Broumi 2014;Deli 2015;Hai-Long 2015;Liu and Shi 2015;Şahin 2015; Wang et al. 2005b;Ye 2014a, 2014b,2014c).\nGraph theory has now become a major branch of applied mathematics and it is generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics. Graph is a widely used tool for solving combinatorial problems in different areas, such as geometry, algebra, number theory, topology, optimization and computer science. To be noted that, when there is uncertainty regarding either the set of vertices or edges, or both, the model becomes a fuzzy graph. Many works on fuzzy graphs, intuitionistic fuzzy graphs and interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy graphs (Antonios K et al. 2014; Bhattacharya 1987; Mishra and Pal 2013; Nagoor Gani and Shajitha Begum 2010; Nagoor Gani and Latha 2012; Nagoor Gani and Basheer Ahamed 2003;Parvathi and Karunambigai 2006; Shannon and Atanassov 1994) have been carried out and all of them have considered the vertex sets and edge sets as fuzzy and /or intuitionistic fuzzy sets. But, when the relations between nodes (or vertices) are indeterminate, the fuzzy graphs and intuitionistic fuzzy graphs fail to work. For this purpose, Smarandache (2015a, 2015b, 2015c) defined four main categories of neutrosophic graphs. Two are based on literal indeterminacy (I): I-edge neutrosophic graph and I-vertex neutrosophic graph. The two categories were deeply studied and gained popularity among the researchers (Garg et al. 2015,Vasantha Kandasamy2004, 2013, 2015) due to their applications via real world problems. The other neutrosophic graph categories are based on (t, i, f) components and are called:(t, i, f)edge neutrosophic graph and (t, i, f)-vertex neutrosophic graph. These two categories are not developed at all.\nFurther on, Broumi et al. (2016b) introduced a new neutrosophic graph model, called single valued neutrosophic graph (SVNG), and investigated some of its properties as well. This model allows attaching the membership (t), indeterminacy (i) and non-membership degrees (f) both to vertices and edges. The single valued neutrosophic graph is a generalization of fuzzy graph and intuitionistic fuzzy graph. Broumi et al. (2016a) also introduced neighborhood degree of a vertex and closed neighborhood degree of a vertex in single valued neutrosophic graph, as a generalization of neighborhood degree of a vertex and closed neighborhood degree of a vertex in fuzzy graph and intuitionistic fuzzy graph. Moreover, Broumi et al. (2016c) introduced the concept of interval valued neutrosophic graph, as a generalization of single valued neutrosophic graph, and discussed some properties, with proofs and examples. In addition, Broumi et al.(2016c) introduced the concept of bipolar single valued neutrosophic graph, as a generalization of fuzzy graphs, intuitionistic fuzzy graph, N-graph, bipolar fuzzy graph and single valued neutrosophic graph, and studied some related properties.\nIn this paper, researchers’ objective is to define some operations on interval valued neutrosophic graphs, and to investigate some properties.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n233\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section, the authors mainly recall some notions related to neutrosophic sets, single valued neutrosophic sets, interval valued neutrosophic sets, fuzzy graphs, intuitionistic fuzzy graphs, interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy graphs, single valued neutrosophic graphs and interval valued neutrosophic graphs, relevant to the present work.

(1)\nThe functions TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) are real standard or nonstandard subsets of ]−0,1+[.\nSince it is difficult to apply NSs to practical problems, Wang et al. 2010 introduced the concept of a SVNS, which is an instance of a NS and can be used in real scientific and engineering applications.\nDefinition 2 (Wang et al. 2010)\nLet X be a space of points (objects) with generic elements in X denoted by x. A single valued neutrosophic set A (SVNS A) is characterized by truth-membership function TA(x) , an indeterminacy-membership function IA(x), and a falsity-membership function FA(x).

In observing the severity of several diseases, different professional experts may result in wrong diagnosis. In order to perform diagnosis intuitively in the medical images, different image processing methods have been explored in terms of neutrosophic theory to interpret the inherent uncertainty, ambiguity and vagueness. This paper demonstrates the use of neutrosophic theory in medical image denoising and segmentation where the performance is observed to be much better.\nKeywords Neutrosophic logic, fuzzy logic, image segmentation.\n1. Introduction\nGenerally medical images are consisted of fuzziness and imprecision information, therefore segmentation, feature extraction and classification are difficult to perform [1]. Since fuzzy sets are widely used for processing fuzziness and uncertainty in a wide range of fields such as control science and image processing [2]. But the limitation of this method is that it does not consider the spatial context of the pixels due to noise and artifacts [3]. The generalization of fuzzy set in form of neutrosophic set is becoming more popular in image processing tasks to overcome the limitations of fuzzy based approaches. The concept of Neutrosophy is introduced by Smarandache [4]. Neutrosophy is the foundation of neutrosophic probability, neutrosophic statistics, neutrosophic logic and neutrosophic set [4]. Neutrosophic set generalizes the concept of the classic set, fuzzy set, interval valued fuzzy set [5], intuitionistic fuzzy set [6], paraconsistent set, paradoxist set, tautological set, dialetheist set [3]. Neutrosophy theory takes into account every theory, concept, or entity <A> in relation to its opposite, <Anti-A> and <Non-A>. The neutralities <Neut-A> which is not A, and that which is neither <A> nor <Anti-A> are referred to as <NonA>. In neutrosophic logic, three neutrosophic components: T, I, F are defined to estimate the truth\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n258\nmembership degree, the false membership degree, and the indeterminacy membership degree (neither true nor false) in <A>. Unlike fuzzy logic, neutrosophic logic introduces the extra domain I which provides a more efficient way to handle higher degrees of uncertainty that is very difficult for fuzzy logic to be handled [7]. The major difference between a Neutrosophic Set (NS) and a Fuzzy Set (FS) is that there is no limit on the sum m in a NS, while in a FS m (m=t+f) must be equal to 1 [8]. The Neutrosophic image domain is shown in Fig. 1.\nFigure 1. Neutrosophic Image Domain\nA neutrosophic image is characterized by three subsets T, I and F. A pixel P in neutrosophic image is described as P(i ,j ), { T(i ,j), I(i ,j ), F(i ,j)}. Thus, for each pixel in the neutrosophic image, the truth degree T, false degree F and indeterminacy degree I is required to be computed. In general, a NS is symbolized as <T, I, F>. In case of determining the tumor in image, tumor can be considered as <A>, boundaries as <Neut-A> and background as <Anti-A>. T, I, and F are the neutrosophic components to represent <A>, <Neut-A> and <Anti-A>, <A> and <Anti-A> contain region information, while <Neut-A> has boundary information [9, 10].\nA pixel in the neutrosophic image can be represented as \uD835\uDC34{\uD835\uDC61, \uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC53}, where \uD835\uDC61% represents true (tumor), \uD835\uDC56% represents indeterminate (boundaries) and \uD835\uDC53% represents false (background), where \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC47, \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC3C and \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC39 [7]. In the FS, \uD835\uDC56 = 0, 0 \uD835\uDC61, \uD835\uDC53100. In the NS, 0 \uD835\uDC61, \uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC53100 [11,12]. An element \uD835\uDC65(\uD835\uDC61, \uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC53) belongs to the set in the following way: it is \uD835\uDC61 true in the set, \uD835\uDC56 indeterminate in the set, and \uD835\uDC53 false, where \uD835\uDC61, \uD835\uDC56, and \uD835\uDC53 are real numbers taken from the sets \uD835\uDC47, \uD835\uDC3C, and \uD835\uDC39 with no restriction on \uD835\uDC47, \uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC39 nor on their sum \uD835\uDC5A = \uD835\uDC61 + \uD835\uDC56 + \uD835\uDC53. In literature, number of neutrosophic based denoising and segmentation methods are given [13, 14, 15, 21, 23, 29].\nThe rest of paper is organized in four sections. Section 2 describes the neutrosophic based image denoising and segmentation methods. Section 3 discusses the results of various neutrosophic domain methods. Finally, the conclusion is summarized in Section 4.\n2. Neutrosophic Based Image Processing\n1.1.

In ultrasound images, pixels belonging to speckle and texture are hard to differentiate, hence, \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57 , is calculated to ascertain the neighborhood mean of pixels in a kernel. Absolute difference is used to determine the indeterminate component and False subset, \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC40 , is determined as the complement of \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC40 [18].\n2.2. Related Work on Neutrosophic Domain image denoising\nSeveral denoising methods based on neutrosophic set have been proposed in the literature to remove Speckle noise, Gaussian and Rician noise [19-28]. Various notions and theories based on NS are defined and applied for denoising of images. The image is converted into the NS domain and γ-median-filtering operation is used to decrease the image indeterminacy. The experiments have been carried out on natural images with various levels of noise for better image denoising [16].\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n260\nA wiener filter in neutrosophic domain has been introduced in literature for removal of Rician noise. The wiener filtering operation is employed on true and false subsets for the reduction of the noise and indeterminacy. Experiments have been performed on simulated MRI from Brainweb database and clinical MR images, which are affected by Rician noise [22]. It has been found that wiener filter in neutrosophic domain is able to preserve edges with the suppression of Rician noise.\nIn [25, 26], LEE and KUAN filter were implemented in neutrosophic domain for the reduction of speckle noise [27]. The Neutrosophic Nonconvex Regularizer Speckle Noise Removal (NNRSNR) method based on Gamma statistics in neutrosophic domain is presented in [28]. Another method based on Nakagami distribution statistics (NTV) which is presented in [29] is further explored in neutrosophic domain. Neutrosophic Nakagami Total Variation method (NNTV) is presented to exploit the Nakagami statistics in neutrosophic domain [30].\n2.3. Related work on Neutrosophic Domain Image Segmentation Recently, neutrosophic based methods have been attracted attention in solving image segmentation problems due to their high performance and indeterminacy handling capability. In literature, several authors have reported number of segmentation methods based on NS [31-40].\nZhang et al. [7] introduced an algorithm, which used the region merge method in NS for the segmentation of natural images to resolve over-segmentation problem. The region merge algorithm started with initial seeds and merged the two regions until a stopping criterion is satisfied. The cluster center is selected on the basis of histogram features in fuzzy domain and the region merge criterion is defined in intensity domain based on edge value and standard deviation features.\nCheng et al. [31] introduced the NS approach with image thresholding for the segmentation of artificial and natural images with indeterminacy handling capability. However, selection of particular threshold value is a critical task as well as it ignores the spatial information and is noise sensitive. Guo et al.[32] presented the fuzzy c-means clustering in NS domain. In this method, entropy in NS domain is used to estimate the indeterminacy of image and α-mean operation is presented to decrease the indeterminacy to make the image more homogenous. Then, image is segmented using a fuzzy c-means clustering. The membership value in the fuzzy clustering is updated as per the indeterminacy value. The experimental analysis demonstrated that the method performed better on both clean and noisy images. Another NS based image segmentation method is presented in which two new operations are defined to reduce the indeterminacy of the image. Zhang et al. [33] presented a watershed segmentation approach in NS domain. In the first phase, image is mapped to NS domain and then, neutrosophic logic and thresholding is used to get a binary image. Final segmentation result is obtained from watershed method. The Neutrosophic Watershed (NW) method has better performance on non-uniform as well as on noisy images.\nFurther NS is integrated with Improved Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM) for image segmentation [34]. In this, membership degree and convergence criterion of clustering are redefined accordingly. Experimental results demonstrated that the method segmented the images effectively and accurately. Another method named as Neutrosophic C-Means (NCM) clustering is introduced for uncertain data clustering, which is inspired from fuzzy c-means and the NS framework [35]. In this method, the clustering problem is derived as an objective function and is minimized with both\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n261\nambiguity rejection and distance rejection. These measures are able to manage uncertainty due to imprecise definition of the clusters.\nAnother automatic segmentation approach is presented by Sengur et al. [36] which is the combination of texture information with color information in NS and wavelet domain. The method is used for the segmentation of natural color image using \uD835\uDEFE-\uD835\uDC3E -means clustering. The cluster number K is ascertained with cluster validity analysis. Experiments demonstrated that it segmented the natural images very effectively even if the texture and color of each region does not have homogeneous statistical characteristics. Shan et al. [37] presented a clustering method named as Neutrosophic L-Means (NLM) clustering for segmentation of breast ultrasound images. The method achieved the best accuracy with a fairly rapid processing speed. The main limitation of the method is that it is not able to segment multiple-lesions and failed under severe shadowing effect.\nKarabatak et al.[38] has given a color image segmentation method in neutrosophic domain. Firstly, the image is transformed into NS domain by defining three membership sets. Then α-mean and β-enhancement operations were used to reduce the indeterminacy. The method suffered from over-segmentation and fixed parameters. An Iterative Neutrosophic Lung Segmentation (INLS) method has been introduced which is based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) analysis and Morphological operations (EMM) for the segmentation of ribs and lungs [39]. The results have shown that the images without or with lung diseases are segmented out more properly.\nGuo et al. [40] has introduced a method for image based on the NS filter and level set. In First the image is transformed into NS domain by true, false and indeterminacy membership sets. Subsequently, a filter is applied for reduction of noise and level set for image segmentation. Further, a Neutrosophic Edge Detection (NSED) method is presented for edges detection with a new directional α-mean operation [41]. The experiments have been performed using artificial and real images which demonstrated that it is able to detect edges accurately.\nRecently a clustering algorithm named as Neutrosophic Evidential C-Means (NECM) with Dezert–Smarandache Theory (DSmT) is proposed for natural image segmentation [42]. The DSmT combination rule and decision has been utilized to achieve the final result. The NECM method is tested on both data clustering and image segmentation applications. Further, a Neutrosophic Similarity Score (NSS) method and level set algorithm is introduced for breast segmentation in ultrasound images [43]. First, the breast ultrasound is transformed to the NS domain via three membership subsets and then NSS is defined and used to determine the membership degree of the tumor region. Finally, the level set is employed for tumor segmentation in the NSS image. The results have shown that the method can segment the breast tissue in ultrasound images effectively and accurately.\nAnother neutrosophic domain segmentation method named as Spatial Neutrosophic Distance Regularizer Level Set (SNDRLS) method is presented for automated delineation of nodules in thyroid ultrasound images [44].\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n262\n3. Experimental results and discussion\n3.1. Results of denoising on synthetic images This section demonstrates the qualitative and quantitative results to evaluate the effectiveness of the neutrosophic domain speckle reduction methods. In experiments, performance of the neutrosophic domain speckle reduction methods NLEE, NKUAN, NNTV and NNRSNR methods are compared with LEE, KUAN, NTV and NRSNR to study the impact of neutrosophic domain in speckle reduction and edge preservation [45]. Several quantitative measures like Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) have been used for the evaluation of aforementioned methods [45, 46].\nFor quantitative evaluation of despeckling methods, the experiments are conducted on synthetic images, in which image is corrupted by speckle noise using speckle simulation procedure [30]. The performance of speckle reduction methods have been measured on the speckle simulated images at various noise levels (σ = 0.3,0.4, … .0.9). Table 1 represents SNR values of noisy image, KUAN, LEE, NKUAN and NLEE methods at various noise levels from σ = 0.3 to 0.9 for synthetic image. From quantitative results, it has been noticed that the neutrosophic domain methods outperformed the spatial domain methods by achieving higher SNR values. The NKUAN outperformed the KUAN filter by gaining higher values of SNR. Similarly, NLEE has also outperformed the LEE filter by achieving higher SNR values.\nTable 1\nSNR (dB)\nNoise Level\nNoisy Image\nKUA N NKU AN LEE NLEE\n0.3 21.11 22.1\n1 23.42 23.16 23.97\n0.4 19.04 20.7 2\n21.41 21.62 22.73\n0.5 17.9 18.7\n3 19.39 20.25 21.88\n0.6 16.38 17.18 18.86 19.21 20.24\n0.7 15.21 15.8\n8 16.31 17.56 18.96\n0.8 13.99 14.64 15.98 16.94 17.51\n0.9 3.63 5.71 6.04 7.79 8.53\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n263\nFigure 2 illustrates EPI of different speckle reduction techniques in which neutrosophic domain methods have high edge preservation as compared to spatial domain methods. From graphical representation as shown in Fig. 2, it is observed that NLEE is able to preserve edges better in neutrosophic domain as compared to LEE method. NLEE method has also been found to be performed better than NKUAN in terms of edge preservation. The results have been compared with spatial-domain speckle reduction filters such as LEE and KAUN. Figure 3 illustrates the results of speckle simulated synthetic image. Fig. 3(a) is the original image, and Fig. 3(b) is the image simulated with speckle noise at 0.5 noise level. Figure 3(c) and Fig. 3(d) are the despeckling results of LEE and KUAN filter, respectively.

From quantitative results, it has been observed that the neutrosophic domain NNRSNR method outperformed the NRSNR method by achieving higher SNR values. Similarly, neutrosophic domain NNTV outperformed the NTV and other methods by gaining higher SNR value. It is clear from the Table 2 that both neutrosophic domain methods performed better as compared to their counterparts even at high noise levels by achieving maximum SNR values.\nTable 2: SNR comparison of different methods at different noise levels (σ = 0.3 to 0.9).

Figure 4(a) shows an original image and Fig. 4(b) displays the speckle simulated image. Whereas Fig. 4(c) reveals that the NRSNR blurred the image information such as edges. Figure 4(d) illustrates that the neutrosophic domain NNRSNR method performs well in speckle suppression. However, some of the pixels are advertantly suppressed and blurred near the boundaries. Similar type of observation could be made by Fig. 4(e) and Fig. 4(f) that the neutrosophic domain NNTV method has better visual result as compared to its counterpart in terms of speckle reduction and edge preservation.\nFigure 4: Visual comparison of different methods on speckle-simulated synthetic image (img2) σ=0.5.

The original ultrasound image is given in Fig. 6(a). The NRSNR oversmoothed and blurred the images while speckle removal as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). It caused loss of important details and information of an image. The NNRSNR method has given better results but artifacts can be noticed in Fig. 6(c). The NNTV method effectively removed the speckle noise and preserved the nodule structure as illustrated in Fig. 6(e). Therefore, NNRSNR and NNTV method in neutrosophic domain can lead to efficient nodule detection in the ultrasound image. Small structures which are obscured by speckle noise become visible after processing by neutrosophic domain speckle reduction methods. The NNTV is able to remove speckle pattern, preserve anatomical structures, resolvable details and boundaries. All these results demonstrate the superiority of the neutrosophic domain methods in handling indeterminacy.\nThese visual outcomes are also evaluated via their line profiles shown in Fig. 7, along the line in the original image. Further, a closer glance in Fig. 7(d) and Fig. 7(f), it is observed that the NNRSNR and NNTV methods surpass the other methods by clearly highlighting the edges of thyroid nodule with the suppression of speckle noise as well as with the preservation of edges and\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d) (d)\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n267\ncorners in the thyroid gland ultrasound image. The methods in neutrosophic domain are able to preserve the corners, boundaries and sharp features of the image as shown in Fig. 7. Also the minute subtle details which are hidden by speckle, become noticeable in despeckled image processed by NNTV method.\nFigure 6: Visual results on the thyroid ultrasound image (img6) (a) Original image.

It is observed that the NNTV method using Nakagami distribution can preserved the nodule boundaries better in ultrasound images while the degree of speckle suppression is high as compared to NNRSNR method.\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d) (e)\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n268\nFigure 7: Line profiles for the thyroid ultrasound image (img6).

Results of segmentation on real images\nFurther, the performance of segmentation methods in neutrosophic domain is compared on real ultrasound images [47]. Various performance metrics such as area-based and boundary-based are used to compute how much nodule pixels are correctly covered and to measure the possible disagreement over two curves [48, 49]. Area based metrics which are used in this work are True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), Dice Coefficient (DC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD).\nTable 3 lists the values of all quality metrics. As evident from results, it is observed that SNDRLS outperforms all other neutrosophic domain methods by achieving high values in terms of performance measures. The larger values of area based metrics produced by SNDRLS method assure more similarity between ground truth and the region extracted by automated segmentation method. The SNLM also reveals an improvement in FP value and HD values than other methods as listed in Table 3. The results have shown that more area is achieved by the SNDRLS method in comparison to NCM and NLM.\nTable 3: Comparison of segmentation methods\nMetrics\nMethods TP (%) DC (%) FP (%)\nHD (pixels)\nNCM [35] 88.5±6.2 78.50±18.4 10.93±10.9 20.1±19.7\nNLM [37] 89.0±5.9 88. 00 ±3.9 13.41±13.3 4.3±4.01\nSNLM [44] 93.45±2.5 92.8±4.6 4.07±4.8 3.23±0.9\nSNDRLS [44] 95.92±3.70 93.88±2.59 7.04±4.21 0.52±0.20\nThe quantitative results of proposed method are also supplemented with subjective outcomes. Figure 9 shows the comparison of proposed SNDRLS method with all aforementioned methods. Figure 9(a) illustrates the original thyroid ultrasound image and Fig. 9(b) shows the ground truth image. It is observed that the contour segmented by Neutrosophic Watershed (NW) is passed through the weak boundaries as shown in Fig. 9(c).\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n271\nNeutrosophic C Means (NCM) is affected as it is easily trapped into inappropriate local minima due to similar intensities as illustrated in Fig. 9(d). As evident from Fig. 9(e), NLM method is not able to segment the entire nodule properly. In addition, Fig. 9(f) illustrates the visual outcome of SNLM, which shows that the boundary of segmented nodule is not close to the boundary marked by an expert. It is found that the results of SNDRLS are very close to the manual segmentation as shown in Fig. 9(g). The SNDRLS is able to handle indeterminacy, fuzziness and uncertainty of pixels. From visual results, it has been noticed that the SNDRLS method is effective and accurate\n(a)\n(b) (c) (d )\n(e) (f) (g)\nFigure 9: (a) Ultrasound image (img23) (b) Ground Truth.

Figure 10(a) shows the original ultrasound image and Fig. 10(b) illustrates the ground truth image. While from Fig. 10(c), it has been noticed that the nodule is not properly segmented out due to low contrast and weak boundaries. The image segmented by NLM is able to attain delineate nodule regions with non-nodule regions also as shown in Fig. 10(d).\nFigure 10: Ultrasound image (img318) (a) Original image (b) Ground Truth.

The best segmentation of nodule is achieved by SNDRLS as the attained delineations are very smooth and completely adapted to the thyroid nodule boundaries as shown in Fig. 10(g). Additionally, SNDRLS can prevent leakage through weak edges resulting in accurate extraction of nodule boundaries by handling the intensity in-homogeneity well.\n4. Conclusion\nNeutrosophic logic gives a powerful tool that can be used to describe the image with uncertain information. This paper provides the usefulness of neutrosophic theory in medical image denoising and segmentation. It is observed that the results using neutrosophic set are much better than the fuzzy/non fuzzy set theory because Neutrosophic set can consider more number of uncertainties by its indeterminacy handling capability. Neutrosophic set gives better result even in low contrasted images with vague region/boundaries. Through the work discussed above shows that neutrosophic based approaches can be utilized for more image processing and pattern recognition applications. It also helps in solving the problems where membership function is not defined accurately due to the lack of personal error.\nReferences 1. Mondal K, Dutta P, Bhattacharyya S.

The love dynamics were studied earlier by Strogatz (Strogatz, 1994), Radzicki (Radzicki, 1993), Rapport (Rapport, 1960), etc. Although Strogatz’s model (Strogatz, 1994) was originally intended only to motivate students, it makes several interesting and plausible predictions, and suggests extensions that produce even wider range of behavior. This paper has been written in the Strogatz’s spirit, and it has extended Romeo & Juliet model (Sprott, 2004) to the neutrosophic domain. A love impact factor (LIF) has been proposed, and analyzed using neutrosophic logic.\nKeywords Neutrosophy, neutrosophic logic, love, romance, human behavior, partner selection, differential equation, love dynamics.\n1. Introduction In present days, the human behavior has become an interesting issue to study. Researchers (concerning to dynamics) were looking for some new techniques to study it accurately. Apparently, studying it isn’t a difficult task, and obviously it can be easily performed by the psychologists. Though, studying it accurately or near to accuracy, that is a difficult task. It may be achieved by mathematical analysis; but since there always appear indeterminacies, a more detailed analysis is required, and that is the main goal of this paper. In order to do this, we need to define human behavior in terms of equations (with indeterminacy) and we need to form a refined model, based on different feelings, taking into account different conditions. This paper deals with the refinement of love dynamics, a subject that falls in the field of social psychology, where interpersonal relationship are a topic of major concern. The feelings of love transpose in different forms; but here we opt to consider it as partner’s love. One may say that romantic relationships are somehow a simpler case, since they involve only two individuals. The analysis has been performed following the modeling approach, with the induction of neutrosophic logic. An obvious difficulty in any model of love is defining what is meant by love and quantifying it in some meaning including intimacy, passion, and commitment (Strogatz, 1988); each type consists of complex mixtures of feelings. In addition to love for another person, there is love for oneself, love of life, love of humanity, and so forth. Furthermore, according to neutrosophy (Smarandache, 1998), the opposite\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n280\nof love may not be hate, since those two feelings can coexists, and one love some things about one’s partner and hate others at the same time. Actually, the feelings in an individual can fluctuate depending on life, position, humanity or partner (Sprott, 2001). These feelings vary from person to person and from time to time. Even if everyone have the same in his/her hearts, the ratio or percentage differs. The feeling in human being varies according to different conditions. For this, different conditions and assumptions have to be applied and therefore we need to move towards an interpretative world or to think for a model that can give the complete dynamics of human feelings. It is obviously unrealistic to suppose that one’s love is only influenced by only his/her own feelings and of the other related person, independent of external influences. The parameters that characterize the interactions are unchanged by excluding the possibility of learning (Scharfe & Bartholonew, 1994). However, the major goal in this research is to apply neutrosophic logic in the love model with the form of coupled ordinary differential equations.\nThis paper has been organized as follows: In section 2, we recall definition of neutrosophy and neutrosophic logic and preliminaries of neutrosophy. Section 3 is devoted to represent neutrosophic love model. Section 4 states open problems. Section 5 presents conclusion.\n2. Neutrosophy & Neutrosophic logic According to Prof. Florentin Smarandache (Smarandache, 1998), “Neutrosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the origin, nature and scope of neutralities as well as their interaction with different ideational spectra”. Prof. Florentin Smarandache is regarded as the father of neutrosophy, and Prof. Cheng-Gui Huang (Huang, n.d.) claims that neutrosophy is a deep thought on human culture, giving advantage to break mechanical understanding. Neutrosophic theory has been applied in many fields in order to solve problems related to indeterminacy. Neutrosophy is a generalization of Hegel’s dialectics. It considers every entity < A > together with its opposite or negation < anti A > idea, refered to together as < non A >.\nDefinition (Smarandache, 1998) A logic in which each proposition is estimated to have the percentage of truth in a subset T, the percentage of indeterminacy in a subset I, and the percentage of falsity in a subset F, where T, I, F are defined above, is called neutrosophic logic.\nActually, neutrosophic logic is a formal description frame trying to measure the truth, indeterminacy and falsehood. For detailed study of neutrosophic logic, researchers may consult the first book on neutrosophy authored by Florentin Smarandache (Smarandache, 1998). Neutrosophic logic was invented by F. Smarandache in 1995, which is an extension of fuzzy logic, intuitionistic fuzzy logic, paraconsistent logic. It deals with indeterminacy. In neutrosophic logic, every logical variable ‘x’ is described by an ordered triple x = (t, i, f), where\nt  degree of truth, i  level of indeterminacy, f  degree of false.\nTo maintain consistency with classical and fuzzy logic and with probability, there is a special case where t + i+ f = 1. But to refer to intuitionistic logic, which means incomplete information on a variable, proposition or event, one has t +i+ f <1. Analogically, referring to paraconsistent logic,\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n281\nwhich means contradictory sources of information about some logical variable, proposition or event, we have t + i +f > 1. Florentin Smarandache (Smarandache,1998) defined neutrosophic components. Assume that T, I, F be standard or non-standard real subset of   1,0 . Florentin\nSmarandache (Smarandache, 1998) presented neutrosophic components as follows: supT = t_sup, infT = t_inf, supI = i_sup, infI = i_inf, supF = f_sup, infF = f_inf, and n_sup = t_sup + i_sup + f_sup, n_inf = t_inf + i_inf + f_inf. The sets T, I, F are not necessarily intervals; but may be any real sub- unitary subsets, discrete or continuous; single element, finite or (countable or uncountable) infinite; union or intersection of various subsets, etc.\n3. Neutrosophic Love model In this section, we present a neutrosophic love model, which is linear. The classical version was studied earlier by Strogatz (Strogatz, 1994). Generally, we classify by a) Linear love model, and b) Non-linear love model.\nHere, we confine our discussion to linear model only. 3. A. Necessity of Neutrosophy in Love dynamics It is well known that, in society, there is no single factor that affects ‘love affairs’. There are so many other external factors (families, relatives, friends, enemies, situations etc.) including indeterminacy that can affect the love affairs, which are not described in previous studies (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 199; Carnelly & Janoff-Bulman, 1991; Gottman, Murray, Swanson, Tyson, & Swanson, 2002, Gragnani, Rinaldi, Feichtinger, 1997; Gragnani, Rinaldi, & Feichtinger, 1997; Griffin & Bartholomew, 1994; Kobak &Hazan, 1991; Radzicki, 1993; Rinaldi,1998a; Rinaldi,1998b; Rinaldi & Gragnani, 1998; Scharfe & Bartholomew, 1994; Sternberg, 1986; Stenberg & Barnes, 1988; Strogatz, 1988; Strogatz, 1994; Wauer, Schwarzer, Cai,&Lin,2007). For an example, let us suppose that a boy, Dushmanta, is forced to love an unknown girl, Sakuntala. It should be noted that the persons (who forced Dushmanta) prisoned his sister, so that the boy acts with the girl, as a lover, only for his sister. In this case, the boy neither loves nor hates the girl. We can conclude that there is some indeterminacy in love dynamics. There are so many examples like this. Therefore, we apply neutrosophic logic to Romeo-Juliet model (Sprott, 2004).\n3. B. Neutrosophic Linear love model (NLL model) Let’s consider a love affair between Romeo and Juliet, where R(t) = Romeo’s love (or hate, if –ve) for Juliet at a particular time ‘t’ J(t) = Juliet’s love (or hate, if –ve) for Romeo at a particular time ‘t’. The simplest neutrosophic linear love model is\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n282\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) dR a bI R c dI J dt dJ e fI R g hI J dt        \n(i)\nSimplifying, we have\n( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) dR aR cJ bR dJ I dt dJ eR gJ fR hJ I dt        \n(ii)\nwhere I level of indeterminacy, and a, b, c, d, e, f ∈ R. 3. B. i. Features of NLL model The parameters ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’ in NLL model specify Romeo’s situational styles, and the parameters ‘e’, ‘f’, ‘g’, ‘h’, specify Juliet’s situational feelings. Overall, we can say that the parameter ‘a’ describes the extent to which Romeo is encouraged by his own feelings, and ‘c’ is the extent to which Romeo is encouraged by Juliet’s feelings, ‘b’ describes the extent to which Romeo is encouraged or discouraged by his family or other sources, and ‘d’ is the extent to which Romeo is encouraged or discouraged by Juliet’s family.\nNow, we are going to present the characteristics of this NLL model. 3. B. ii. Characteristics of NLL model We may describe the situational behavior of Romeo in this NLL model by portioning our\nuniverse of discourse NU into two parts. These are:\na) Independent indeterminacy model ( 0INU  ), b) Dependent indeterminacy model ( 0INU  ).\n3. B. ii. a. Independent Indeterminacy model ( 0INU  )\nHere, Romeo can exhibit one of the nine romantic styles, depending upon the signs of ‘a’ and ‘c’.\n1. Eager Behavior: [if a > 0, c > 0] i.e. Romeo is encouraged by his own feelings as well as Juliet’s. 2. Narcissistic nerd: [if a > 0 and c < 0] i.e. Romeo wants more of what he feels; but retreats from Juliet’s feelings. 3. Secure lover: [if a < 0, b > 0] i.e. Romeo retreats from his own feelings; but is encouraged by Juliet’s. 4. Hermit: [if a < 0 and b < 0] i.e. Romeo retreats from his own feelings as well as Juliet’s. 5. X-inertia: [if a > 0, b = 0] i.e. Romeo is encouraged by his own feelings; but doesn’t get\nany reply from Juliet’s. 6. Y-inertia: [if a = 0 and b > 0] i.e. Romeo is encouraged by Juliet’s feelings; but act as a\nneutral person.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n283\n7. Juliet’s Hate: [if a < 0 and b = 0] i.e. Romeo retreats from his own feelings; but doesn’t get any (positive) reply from Juliet, which ultimately leads to Juliet’s hate. 8. Romeo’s hate: [if a = 0, b < 0] i.e. Romeo retreats from Juliet’s feelings, but doesn’t give any positive reply, which ultimately leads to his hate towards Juliet. 9. Not love at all: [if a = 0 and b = 0] i.e. Both Romeo and Juliet has no reaction w.r.t each other.\n3. B. ii. b. Dependent Indeterminacy model In this case, there is a positive value of indeterminacy in which there exists an external factor, by means of which the love of Romeo and Juliet is affected. 1. Limit touches the sky: [if a, b, c, d>0] i.e. Romeo and Juliet encouraged by themselves\nas well as their families. 2. Up-Romeo: [if a > 0, c > 0, b > 0, d < 0] i.e. Romeo encouraged by himself, Juliet and his\nfamily; but the family of Juliet doesn’t accept this proposal. 3. Up-Juliet: [if a > 0, c > 0, b < 0, d>0] i.e. Romeo & Juliet are encouraged by themselves;\nbut Romeo’s family doesn’t cooperate for this love affairs. 4. Unsecured love: [if a > 0, c > 0, b < 0, d<0] i.e. Both Romeo and Juliet are encouraged\nby their love; but neither Romeo’s family nor Juliet’s family agree for this affair. 5. Forced Juliet: [if a > 0, c < 0, b > 0, d>0] i.e. both the families of Romeo and Juliet are\ncorrelated and agreed in this love affair. And Romeo is encouraged by his own love affair; but retreats from Juliet’s feelings i.e. Juliet is forced to love or suppress her love. 6. Failed Romeo: [if a > 0, c < 0, b > 0, d<0] i.e. Romeo is encouraged by himself as well as his family; but retreats from Juliet’s feelings and her family. 7. Harassed Romeo: [if a > 0, c < 0, b < 0, d<0] i.e. Romeo is encouraged by himself only; but has no support from both Juliet and their families. 8. Crossed Love: [if a>0, c<0, b<0, d>0] i.e. Romeo is encouraged by himself. Romeo’s family agrees with the affair; but neither Juliet nor her family accept this affair. 9. Suspected Love: [if a < 0, c > 0, b > 0, d>0] i.e. Romeo retreats from his behavior and encouraged from both Juliet’s behavior and her family. In this case, either Romeo suppresses his love or loves any other girl. 10. Crossed Love [if a < 0, c > 0, b >0, d<0] i.e. when Romeo isn’t agreed, his family is agreed; but it is opposite for Juliet. 11. Fickle Love: [if a < 0, c > 0, b < 0, d<0] i.e. Romeo retreats from his own behavior as well as families, but encouraged by Juliet. 12. One sided: [if a < 0, c > 0, b < 0, d > 0] i.e. Romeo & his family retreats from the behavior of Juliet as well as her family. 13. Family love: [if a < 0, c < 0, b >0, d > 0] i.e. Romeo & Juliet aren’t encouraged by themselves. Only their families are agreed. 14. Not love: [if a < 0, c <0, b < 0, d < 0] i.e. No factors are interested in this affairs. 15. Fluctuated R-family: [if a < 0, c < 0, b > 0, d < 0] i.e. Only Romeo’s family is interested\nin this affairs. 16. Fluctuated J-family: [if a < 0, c < 0, b < 0, d > 0] i.e. Only Juliet’s family is interested in\nthis affair.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n284\n17. Neutral Juliet: [if a > 0, c = 0, b > 0, d > 0] i.e. Juliet is neutral in this affairs. 18. Single Romeo: [if a > 0, c = 0, b < 0, d < 0] i.e. only Romeo encouraged from his behavior. 19. Lonely Romeo: [if a > 0, c = 0, b < 0, d < 0] i.e. only Romeo is encouraged by his behavior;\nneither Juliet, nor their families. 20. Moderate Romeo: [if a >0, c = 0, b< 0, d> 0] i.e. the love is moderate, that is only Romeo\nis encouraged by his behavior. 21. Neutral Romeo: [if a = 0, c > 0, b > 0, d > 0] i.e. Juliet and her family are encouraged by\nthemselves. 22. Single Juliet: [if a = 0, c > 0, b < 0, d < 0] i.e. only Juliet is agreed and Romeo is\nencouraged by Juliet’s feelings. 23. Moderate Juliet: [if a = 0, c > 0, b > 0, d < 0] i.e. only Romeo is encouraged by the\nfeelings of Juliet. 24. Moderate J-family: [if a = 0, c > 0, b < 0, d > 0] i.e. only Juliet is agreed in this proposal. 25. Unarranged J-love: [if a < 0, c = 0, b > 0,d >0] i.e. only families of the lovers are agreed\nin this proposal. 26. No love: [if a < 0, c < 0, b < 0, d <0] i.e. there exists no love. 27. Failed J-love: [if a < 0, c = 0, b <0, d > 0] i.e. only Juliet’s family show their interest; but\nthere is no interest from Romeo and Juliet. 28. Failed R-Love: [if a < 0, c = 0, b > 0, d < 0] i.e. only Romeo’s family show their interest\nin this proposal. 29. Unarranged R-love: [if a = 0, c < 0, b > 0, d > 0] i.e. Families of the lovers are agreed in\nthis issue. 30. Family J-love: [if a = 0, c < 0, b < 0, d > 0] i.e. only the family of Juliet agrees. 31. Family R-love: [if a = 0, c < 0, b > 0, d <0] i.e. only the family of Romeo agrees. 32. No love: [if a=0, c<0, b<0, d<0] i.e. none factors agreed and Juliet kept her behavior as\nneutral. 33. One sided R-family: [if a = 0, c = 0, b > 0, d < 0] i.e. only the family of Romeo is agreed\nin this proposal. 34. One sided J-family: [if a = 0, c = 0, b < 0, d > 0] i.e. the family of Juliet is agreed and\nthere is no interest of others. 35. Neutral lovers: [if a = 0, c = 0, b > 0, d > 0] i.e. the lovers are kept as neutral and their\nfamilies are interested in this issue. 36. Never love: [if a = 0, c = 0, b < 0, d < 0] i.e. all factors show the uninterested intention\nfor this issue.\n3. C. Impact factor of Love Definition: Let NU be the universe of discourse. Let ‘LIF’ be the impact factor of a love affair, which is defined as the index of affection of the love affair, whether it is going to succeed or to fail, or in between them.\nThe love impact factor is denoted as ‘LIF’ and defined as follows:\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n285\n< 0: if ,TL IFLN N < 0\n1. = 0: if ,TL IFLN N = 0\n= 1: if ,TL IFLN N   0\n> 1: if ,TL IFLN N > 1\n 1: if ,TL IFLN N  1\n 0: if ,TL IFLN N  0 where, & N\nTL IFL N are the love functions of the parameters (a, c) and (b, d) respectively, and it\nis defined as follows: < 0 : if a, c < 0 = 0 : if a , c = 0 = 1 : if a or c=0 > 1 : if a > 0, c > 0  1 : if a 1 and c 1  0: if a, c  0\nand\n= 1 : if b or d = 0 > 1 : if b > 0, d > 0  1 : if b1 and d  0  0: if b, d  0 = 0 : if b , d = 0 < 0 : if b < 0, d < 0\nNow we consider some cases as follows: Examples: (Regarding LIF) 1. Let’s consider the case of ‘limit touches the sky’. In this case, a >0, b > 0, c >0, d > 0 . So\n1TLN  and, 1IFLN  this implies LIF > 1, which implies that it is very much effective love. 2. Let’s consider the case of ‘Up-Romeo’. In this case, 1, 1TL IFLN N  , this implies 1-  \nLIF 1, for all very small positive . It is like a fluctuating love, leading to success. 3. Let’s consider the case of ‘unsecured love’; in this case,\n2. 1& N 1 1 LIF 1, >0 TL IFLN       \nSo it is a case of fluctuating love, leading to success.\n,TL IFLN N LIF \n=\nTLN = Nf (a, c) =\nIFLN = Nf (b, d) =\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n286\nLike this, we can study any case described in Section 3, case, and can find the ‘love index factor’ for accuracy.\nFor inquiring minds, we suggest some research level open problems, as following.\n4. Open problems\n1. Extend the love dynamics to neutrosophic love triangles. 2. Propose new neutrosophic love models based upon ancient / modern society. 3. Create a neutrosophic model on attachment process. 4. Propose a neutrosophic love model and analyze it for a secure individual, etc.\n5. Conclusions The aim of this paper was to present a new neutrosophic love model, which would be able to describe the whole love features. Also, we proposed here for the first time the love impact factor (LIF). Due to insufficiencies of previous works, we decided to apply the neutrosophy to love dynamics, since ‘love’ involves indeterminacy. ‘Love dynamics’ being a very interesting and open topic for research, the present study may open up new avenue of research for current neutrosophic research arena.\nAcknowledgement\nThe author is very grateful to Prof. (Dr.) Florentin Smarandache, Mathematics & Science Department, University of New Mexico, USA and Dr. Surapati Pramanik, Department of Mathematics, Nandalal Ghosh B.T.

In neutrosophic set, indeterminacy is quantified explicitly and truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership and falsity-membership are independent. So it is natural to adopt for that purpose the value from the selected set with highest degree of truth-membership, indeterminacy membership and least degree of falsity-membership on the decision set. These factors indicate that a decision making process takes place in neutrosophic environment. In this paper, we introduce and study the probability of neutrosophic crisp sets. After given the fundamental definitions and operations, we obtain several properties and discussed the relationship between them. These notions can help researchers and make great use of it in the future in making algorithms to solving problems and manage between these notions to produce a new application or new algorithm of solving decision support problems. Possible applications to mathematical computer sciences are touched upon.\nKeywords\nNeutrosophic set, neutrosophic probability, neutrosophic crisp sets, intuitionistic neutrosophic set.\n1. Introduction Neutrosophy has laid the foundation for a whole family of new mathematical theories generalizing both their classical and fuzzy counterparts [1, 2, 3, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 42] such as a neutrosophic set theory. The fundamental concepts of neutrosophic set, introduced by Smarandache in [48, 49, 50, 51], and Salama et al. in [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], provides a natural foundation for treating mathematically the neutrosophic phenomena which exist pervasively in our real world and for building new branches of neutrosophic mathematics. In this paper is to introduce and study the probability of neutrosophic crisp sets. After given the fundamental definitions and operations, we obtain several properties, and discussed the relationship between neutrosophic crisp sets and others.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n292\n2. Terminologies We recollect some relevant basic preliminaries, and in particular, the work of Smarandache in [37, 38, 39, 40], and Salama et al. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Smarandache introduced the neutrosophic components T, I, F which represent the membership, indeterminacy, and non-membership values respectively, where  1,0 - is nonstandard unit interval. Example 2.1 [37, 39]\nLet us consider a neutrosophic set a collection of possible locations (position) of particle x and Let A and B two neutrosophic sets. One can say, by language abuse, that any particle x neutrosophically belongs to any set, due to the percentages of truth/indeterminacy/falsity involved, which varies between  1 and 0 .For example :x(0.5,0.2,0.3) belongs to A (which means, the probability of 50% particle x is in a poison of A, with a probability of 30% x is not in A, and the rest is undecidable); or y(0,0,1) belongs to A( which normally means y is not for sure in A );or z(0,1,0) belongs to A (which means one does know absolutely nothing about z affiliation with A). More general, x((0.2-0.3),(0.4—0.45) [0.50-0.51],{0.2,0.24,0.28}) belongs to the seta, which means: With a probability in between 20-30% particle x is in a position of A ( one cannot find an exact approximate because of various sources used ); With a probability of 20% or 24% or 28% x is not in A; The indeterminacy related to the appurtenance of x to A is in between 40-45% or between 50-51% ( limits included ).

The Probability of Neutrosophic Crisp Sets If an experiment produces indeterminacy, that is called a neutrosophic experiment. Collecting all results, including the indeterminacy, we get the neutrosophic sample space (or the neutrosophic probability space) of the experiment. The neutrosophic power set of the neutrosophic sample space is formed by all different collections (that may or may not include the indeterminacy) of possible results. These collections are called neutrosophic events. In classical experimental the\nprobability is       trialsofnumber totel occursA event timesofnumber . Similarly, Smarandache [16, 17, 18] introduced neutrosophic experimental probability as follows:\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n294\n      trialsofnumber total occurnot does Aevent timesofnumber , trialsofnumber total occursacy indetermin timesofnumber , trialsofnumber total occurs Aevent timesofnumber\nProbability of NCS is a generalization of the classical probability in which the chance that event\n321 ,, AAAA  occurs is: ) false , P(A) (A) true, PP(A 321 ateindetermin , on a sample space X, or\n)(),(),()( 321 APAPAPANP  .\nA subspace of the universal set, endowed with a neutrosophic probability defined for each of its subset, forms a probability neutrosophic crisp space.\nDefinition 3.1\nLet X be a non- empty set and A be any type of neutrosophic crisp set on a space X, then the probability is a mapping  31,0: XNP , )(),(),()( 321 APAPAPANP  that is the probability a\nneutrosophic crisp set has the property that,         o,p,pp if 0 1,0 p where),p,p(p )A(NP 321 3,2,1321 ,\nRemark 3.1\ni) In case if 321 ,, AAAA  is NCS then   3)()()(0 321 APAPAP\nii) In case if 321 ,, AAAA  is NCS-Type I then 2)()()(0 321  APAPAP .\niii) The probability of NCS-Type II is a neutrosophic crisp set where   2)()()(0 321 APAPAP\niv) The probability of NCS-Type III is a neutrosophic crisp set where   3)()()(0 321 APAPAP .\nProbability Axioms of NCS\nAxioms:\n1- The probability of neutrosophic crisp set and NCS-Type III A on X )(),(),()( 321 APAPAPANP  where 0)(,0)(,0)( 321  APAPAP or\n \n  \n\n  if 0 10 where )( 321 321321 o,p,pp , p),p,p(p ANP ,,\n2- The probability of neutrosophic crisp set and NCS-Type IIIs A on X )(),(),()( 321 APAPAPANP  where   3)()()(0 321 ApApAp .\n3- Bonding the probability of neutrosophic crisp set and NCS-Type IIIs )(),(),()( 321 APAPAPANP  where .0)(,0)(,0)(1 321  APAPAP\n4- Addition law for any two neutrosophic crisp sets or NCS-Type III\ni) ),()()(()( 1111 BAPBPAPBANP  ),()()(( 2222 BAPBPAP   )()()(( 3333 BAPBPAP\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n295\nif NBA  , then )()( NNPBANP  .\n),()()(),()()()( 222111 NN NPBNPANPNPBNPANPBANP   ).()()( 333 NNPBNPANP \nSince our main purpose is to construct the tools for developing probability of neutrosophic crisp sets, we must introduce the following:\n1) Probability of neutrosophic crisp empty set with three types ( )( NNP  for short) may be defined as four types:\ni) Type 1:  1,0,0)(),(),()( XPPPNP N \nii) Type 2:  1,1,0)(),(),()( XPXPPNP N \ni) Type 3:  0,0,0)(),(),()(  PPPNP N\nii) Type 4:  0,1,0)(),(),()(  PXPPNP N\n2) Probability of neutrosophic crisp universal and NCS-Type III universal sets ( )( NXNP ) may be defined as four types:\ni) Type 1:  0,0,1)(),(),()(  PPXPXNP N\nii) Type 2:  0,1,1)(),(),()( PXPXPXNP N\niii) Type 3:  1,1,1)(),(),()( XPXPXPXNP N\niv) Type 4:  1,0,1)(),(),()( XPPXPXNP N \nRemark 3.1\n1) ,1)( NNXNP  NN ONP )( .Where NN O,1 are in Definition 2.1 [6], or equals any type for N1 .\n2) The probability of neutrosophic crisp set is a neutrosophic set.\nDefinition 3.2 (Monotonicity)\nLet X be a non-empty set, and NCSS A and B in the form 321 ,, AAAA  , 321 ,, BBBB  with )(),(),()( 321 APAPAPANP  , )(),(),()( 321 BPBPBPBNP  then we may consider two possible definitions for subsets ( BA )\n( BA ) may be defined as two types:\n1) Type1: )()P( and )()(),()()()( 332211 BPABPAPBPAPBNPANP  or\n2) Type2: )()P( and )()(),()()()( 332211 BPABPAPBPAPBNPANP  .\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n296\nDefinition 3.3\nLet X be a non-empty set, and NCSs A and B in the form 321 ,, AAAA  , 321 ,, BBBB  are NCSs.

Introduction.\nThe neutrosophic logic is a formal frame trying to measure the truth, indeterminacy, and falsehood. Smarandache [36] remarks the differences between neutrosophic logic (NL) and intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IFL) and the corresponding neutrosophic sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The main differences are:\na) Neutrosophic Logic can distinguish between absolute truth (that is an unalterable and permanent fact), and relative truth (where facts may vary depending on the circumstances), because\nNL(absolute truth)=1+ while NL(relative truth)=1. This has obvious application in philosophy. That’s why the unitary standard interval [0, 1] used in IFL has been extended to the unitary non-standard interval ]−0, 1+[ in NL.\nSimilar distinctions for absolute or relative falsehood, and absolute or relative indeterminacy are allowed in NL.\nb) In NL there is no restriction on T, I, F other than they are subsets of ]−0, 1+[, thus: −0 ≤ inf T + inf I + inf F ≤ supT + sup I + supF ≤ 3+. This non-restriction allows paraconsistent, dialetheist, and incomplete information to be characterized in NL (i.e. the sum of all three components if they are defined as points, or sum of superior limits of all three components if they are defined as subsets can be > 1, for paraconsistent information coming from different sources, or < 1 for incomplete information), while that information can not be described in IFL because in IFL the components T (truth), I (indeterminacy), F (falsehood) are restricted either to t+ i+ f = 1 if T, I, F are all reduced to the points t,i, f respectively, or to supT + sup I + supF = 1 if T, I, F are subsets of [0, 1].\nc) In NL the components T, I, F can also be non-standard subsets included in the unitary non-standard interval ]−0, 1+[, not only standard subsets, included in the unitary standard interval [0, 1] as in IFL.\nIn various recent papers [35,38,39,40], F. Smarandache generalizes intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and other kinds of sets to neutrosophic sets (NSs). In [39] some distinctions between NSs and IFSs are underlined.\nThe notion of intuitionistic fuzzy set defined by K.T. Atanassov [1] has been applied by Çoker [8] for study intuitionistic fuzzy topological spaces. This concept has been developed by many authors (Bayhan and Çoker[6], Çoker, [7,8], Çoker and Eş [9], Eş and Çoker[12], Gürçay, Çoker and Eş[13], Hanafy [14], Hur, Kim and Ryou [15], Lee and Lee [16]; Lupiáñez [17-21], Turanh and Çoker [41]).\nA few years ago raised some controversy over whether the term ”intuitionistic fuzzy set” was appropriate or not (see [11] and [4]). At present, it is customary to speak of ”Atanassov’ intuitionistic fuzzy set”\nF. Smarandache also defined the notion of neutrosophic topology on the non-standard interval [35]. One can expect some relation between the inuitionistic fuzzy topology on an IFS and the neutrosophic topology. We show in this chapter that this is false. Indeed, the complement of an IFS A is not the complement of A in the neutrosophic operation, the union and the intersection of IFSs do not coincide\nFRANCISCO GALLEGO LUPIAÑEZ\nDept. of Mathematics, Univ.

Also, this author defined the notion of neutrosophic topology on the non-standard interval. One can expect some relation between the intuitionistic fuzzy topology on an IFS and the neutrosophic topology. We show in this work that this is false.\nKeywords: Logic, set-theory,topology, Atanassov's IFSs.\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n305\nwith the corresponding operations for NSs, and finally an intuitionistic fuzzy topology is not necessarily a neutrosophic topology.\nClearly, for their various applications to many areas of knowledge, including philosophy, religion, sociology, .. (see [5,40,42]), the Atanassov’ intuitionistic fuzzy sets and the neutrosophic sets are notions that use knowledge-based techniques to support human decision-making, learning and action.\n1.2. Basic definitions.\nFirst, we present some basic definitions:\nDefinition 1 Let X be a non-empty set. An intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS for short) A, is an object having the form A = {< x, µA, γA > /x ∈ X} where the functions µA : X → I and γA : X → I denote the degree of membership (namely µA(x)) and the degree of nonmembership (namely γA(x)) of each element x ∈ X to the set A, respectively, and 0 ≤ µA(x) + γA(x) ≤ 1 for each x ∈ X. [1].\nDefinition 2 Let X be a non-empty set, and the IFSs A = {< x, µA, γA > |x ∈ X}, B = {< x, µB , γB > |x ∈ X}. Let\nA = {< x, γA, µA > |x ∈ X} A ∩B = {< x, µA ∧ µB , γA ∨ γB > |x ∈ X} A ∪B = {< x, µA ∨ µB , γA ∧ γB > |x ∈ X}.[3].\nDefinition 3 Let X be a non-empty set. Let 0∼ = {< x, 0, 1 > |x ∈ X} and 1∼ = {< x, 1, 0 > |x ∈ X}.[8].\nDefinition 4 An intuitionistic fuzzy topology (IFT for short) on a non-empty set X is a family τ of IFSs in X satisfying:\n(a) 0∼,1∼ ∈ τ, (b) G1 ∩G2 ∈ τ for any G1, G2 ∈ τ , (c) ∪Gj ∈ τ for any family {Gj |j ∈ J} ⊂ τ. In this case the pair (X, τ) is called an intuitionistic fuzzy topological space (IFTS for short) and any\nIFS in τ is called an intuitionistic fuzzy open set (IFOS for short) in X. [8].\nDefinition 5 Let T , I,F be real standard or non-standard subsets of the non-standard unit interval ]−0, 1+[, with\nsupT = tsup , inf T = tinf sup I = isup , inf I = iinf supF = fsup , inf F = finf and nsup = tsup + isup + fsup ninf = tinf + iinf + finf , T , I,F are called neutrosophic components. Let U be an universe of discourse, and M a set included in U . An element x from U is noted with respect to the set M as x(T, I, F ) and belongs to M in the following way: it is t% true in the set, i% indeterminate (unknown if it is) in the set, and f% false, where t varies in T , i varies in I, f varies in F. The set M is called a neutrosophic set (NS). [40].\nRemark. All IFS is a NS.\nDefinition 6 Let S1 and S2 be two (unidimensional) real standard or non-standard subsets, then we define:\nS1 ⊕ S2 = {x|x = s1 + s2, where s1 ∈ S1 and s2 ∈ S2}, S1 S2 = {x|x = s1 − s2, where s1 ∈ S1and s2 ∈ S2}, S1 S2 = {x|x = s1 · s2, where s1 ∈ S1and s2 ∈ S2}. [36].\n306\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\nDefinition 7 One defines, with respect to the sets A an B over the universe U : 1. Complement: if x(T1, I1, F1) ∈ A, then x({1+} T1, {1+} I1, {1+} F1) ∈ C(A). 2. Intersection: if x(T1, I1, F1) ∈ A, x(T2, I2, F2) ∈ B, then x(T1 T2, I1 I2, F1 F2) ∈ A ∩B. 3.Union: if x(T1, I1, F1) ∈ A, x(T2, I2, F2) ∈ B, then x(T1 ⊕ T2 T1 T2, I1 ⊕ I2 I1 I2, F1 ⊕ F2 F1 F2) ∈ A ∪B. [40].\n1.3. Results.\nProposition 1. Let A be an IFS in X, and j(A) be the corresponding NS. We have that the complement of j(A) is not necessarily j(A).\nProof. If A =< x, µA, γA > is x(µA(x), 1− µA(x)− νA(x), νA(x)) ∈ j(A). Then , for 0∼ =< x, 0, 1 > is x(0, 0, 1) ∈ j(0∼) for 1∼ =< x, 1, 0 > is x(1, 0, 0) ∈ j(1∼) and for A =< x, γA, µA > is x(γA(x), 1− µA(x)− νA(x), µA(x)) ∈ j(A). Thus, 1∼ = 0∼ and j( 1∼) 6= C(j(0∼)) because x(1, 0, 0, ) ∈ j( 1∼) but x({1+}, {1+}, {0+}) ∈\nC(j(0∼)).\nProposition 2. Let A and B be two IFSs in X,and j(A) and j(B) be the corresponding NSs. We\nhave that j(A)∪ j(B) is not necessarily j(A ∪B), and j(A)∩ j(B) is not necessarily j(A ∩B) . Proof. Let A =< x, 1/2, 1/3 > and B =< x, 1/2, 1/2 > (i.e. µA, νA, µB , νB are constant maps). Then, A∪B =< x, µA∨µB , γA∧γB >=< x, 1/2, 1/3 > and x(1/2, 1/6, 1/3) ∈ j(A∪B). On the other hand, x(1/2, 1/6, 1/3) ∈ j(A), x(1/2, 0, 1/2) ∈ j(B), x(1, 1/6, 5/6) ∈ j(A)⊕ j(B), x(1/4, 0, 1/6) ∈ j(A) j(B) and x(3/4, 1/6, 2/3) ∈ j(A)∪ j(B) .Thus j(A ∪B) 6= j(A)∪ j(B).\nAnalogously, A ∩ B =< x, µA ∧ µB , γA ∨ γB >=< x, 1/2, 1/2 > and x(1/2, 0, 1/2) ∈ j(A ∩ B), but x(1/4, 0, 1/6) ∈ j(A) ∩ j(B).Thus, j(A ∩B) 6= j(A) ∩ j(B).\nDefinition 8 Let’s construct a neutrosophic topology on NT =]−0, 1+[, considering the associated family of standard or non-standard subsets included in NT , and the empty set which is closed under set union and finite intersection neutrosophic. The interval NT endowed with this topology forms a neutrosophic topological space. [35].\nProposition 3. Let (X, τ) be an intuitionistic fuzy topological space. Then, the family {j(U)|U ∈ τ} is not necessarily a neutrosophic topology.\nProof. Let τ = {1∼, 0∼, A} where A =< x, 1/2, 1/2 > then x(1, 0, 0) ∈ j(1∼), x ∈ (0, 0, 1) ∈ j(0∼) and x(1/2, 0, 1/2) ∈ j(A). Thus {j(1∼), j(0∼), j(A)} is not a neutrosophic topology, because this family is not closed by finite intersections, indeed, x(1/2, 0, 0) ∈ j(1∼) ∩ j(A), and this neutrosophic set is not in the family.\n2 OTHER NEUTROSOPHIC TOPOLOGIES\n2.1. Introduction.\nF. Smarandache also defined various notions of neutrosophic topologies on the non-standard interval [35,40].\nOne can expect some relation between the intuitionistic fuzzy topology on an IFS and the neutrosophic topology. We show in this chapter that this is false. Indeed, the union and the intersection of IFSs do not coincide with the corresponding operations for NSs, and an intuitionistic fuzzy topology is not necessarilly a neutrosophic topology on the non-standard interval, in the various senses defined by Smarandache.\n2.2. Basic definitions. First, we present some basic definitions:\n307\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\nDefinition 9 Let J ∈ {T, I, F} be a component. Most known N-norms are: The algebraic product N-norm: Nn−a lg ebraicJ(x, y) = x · y The bounded N-norm: Nn−boundedJ(x, y) = max {0, x+ y − 1} The default (min) N-norm: Nn−minJ(x, y) = min {x, y} Nn represent the intersection operator in neutrosophic set theory. Indeed x ∧ y = (T∧, I∧, F∧). [40]\nDefinition 10 Let J ∈ {T, I, F} be a component. Most known N-conorms are: The algebraic product N-conorm: Nc−a lg ebraicJ(x, y) = x+ y − x · y The bounded N-conorm: Nc−boundedJ(x, y) = min {1, x+ y} The default (max) N-conorm: Nc−maxJ(x, y) = max {x, y} Nc represent the union operator in neutrosophic set theory.Indeed x ∨ y = (T∨, IV , F∨) [40]\n2.3. Results.\nProposition 1. Let A and B be two IFSs in X, and j(A) and j(B) be the corresponding NSs. We\nhave that j(A)∪ j(B) is not necessarily j(A∪B), and j(A)∩ j(B) is not necessarily j(A∩B), for any of three definitions of intersection of NSs.\nProof. Let A =< x, 1/2, 1/3 > and B =< x, 1/2, 1/2 > (i.e. µA, νA, µB , νB are constant maps). Then, A ∪ B =< x, µA ∨ µB , γA ∧ γB >=< x, 1/2, 1/3 > and x(1/2, 1/6, 1/3) ∈ j(A ∪ B). On the other hand, x(1/2, 1/6, 1/3) ∈ j(A), x(1/2, 0, 1/2) ∈ j(B). Then, we have that: 1) for the union operator defined by the algebraic product N-conorm x(3/4, 1/6, 2/3) ∈ j(A)∪ j(B) . 2) for the union operator defined by the bounded N-conorm x(1, 1/6, 5/6) ∈ j(A)∪ j(B) . 3) for the union operator defined by the default (max) N-conorm x(1/2, 1/6, 1/2) ∈ j(A)∪ j(B) . Thus j(A ∪B) 6= j(A)∪ j(B),with the three definitions. Analogously, A ∩B =< x, µA ∧ µB , γA ∨ γB >=< x, 1/2, 1/2 > and x(1/2, 0, 1/2) ∈ j(A ∩B). And, we have that: 1) for the intersection operator defined by the algebraic product N-norm x(1/4, 0, 1/6) ∈ j(A)∩ j(B) . 2) for the intersection operator defined by the bounded N-norm x(0, 0, 0) ∈ j(A)∩ j(B) . 3) for the intersection operator defined by the default (min) N-norm x(1/2, 0, 1/3) ∈ j(A)∩ j(B) . Thus j(A ∩B) 6= j(A)∩ j(B),with the three definitions.\nDefinition 11 Let’s construct a neutrosophic topology on NT =]−0, 1+[, considering the associated family of standard or non-standard subsets included in NT , and the empty set which is closed under set union and finite intersection neutrosophic. The interval NT endowed with this topology forms a neutrosophic topological space. There exist various notions of neutrosophic topologies on NT , defined by using various N-norm/N-conorm operators. [35, 40].\nProposition 2. Let (X, τ) be an intuitionistic fuzzy topological space. Then, the family {j(U)|U ∈ τ} is not necessarily a neutrosophic topology on NT (in the three defined senses).\nProof. Let τ = {1∼, 0∼, A} where A =< x, 1/2, 1/2 > then x(1, 0, 0) ∈ j(1∼), x ∈ (0, 0, 1) ∈ j(0∼) and x(1/2, 0, 1/2) ∈ j(A). Thus τ∗ = {j(1∼), j(0∼), j(A)} is not a neutrosophic topology, because this family is not closed by finite intersections, for any neutrosophic topology on NT . Indeed,\n1) For the intersection defined by the algebraic product N-norm, we have that x(1/2, 0, 0) ∈ j(1∼) ∩ j(A), and this neutrosophic set is not in the family τ∗.\n2) For the intersection defined by the bounded N-norm, we have also that x(1/2, 0, 0) ∈ j(1∼)∩ j(A), and this neutrosophic set is not in the family τ∗.\n3) For the intersection defined by the default (min) N-norm, we have also that x(1/2, 0, 0) ∈ j(1∼) ∩ j(A), and this neutrosophic set is not in the family τ∗.\n308\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n3 INTERVAL NEUTROSOPHIC SETS AND TOPOLOGY\n3.1. Introduction.\nAlso, Wang, Smarandache, Zhang, and Sunderraman [42] introduced the notion of interval neutrosophic set, which is an instance of neutrosophic set and studied various properties. We study in this chapter relations between interval neutrosophic sets and topology.\n3.2. Basic definitions.\nFirst, we present some basic definitions. For definitions on non-standard Analysis, see [33] :\nDefinition 12 Let X be a space of points (objects) with generic elements in X denoted by x. An interval neutrosophic set (INS) A in X is characterized by thuth-membership function TA, indeteminacymembership function IA and falsity-membership function FA. For each point x in X, we have that TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) ∈ [0, 1]. [42].\nRemark. All INS is clearly a NS.\nWhen X is continuous, an INS A can be written as A = ∫ X 〈T (x), I(x), F (x)〉 /x, x ∈ X When X is discrete, an INS A can be written as\nA = n∑\ni=1\n〈T (xi), I(xi)F (xi)〉 /xi , xi ∈ X\nDefinition 13 a) An interval neutrosophic set A is empty if inf TA(x) = supTA(x) = 0, inf IA(x) = sup IA(x) = 1, inf FA(x) = supFA(x) = 0 for all x in X.\nb) Let 0 =< 0, 1, 1 > and 1 =< 1, 0, 0 > .[42].\nDefinition 14 (Complement) Let CN denote a neutrosophic complement of A. Then CN is a function CN : N → N and CN must satisfy at least the following three axiomatic requirements: 1. CN (0) = 1 and CN (1) = 0 (boundary conditions). 2. Let A and B be two interval neutrosophic sets defined on X, if A(x) ≤ B(x), then CN (A(x)) ≥ CN (B(x)), for all x in X. (monotonicity). 3. Let A be an interval neutrosophic set defined on X, then CN (CN (A(x))) = A(x), for all x in X. (involutivity).[42]. Remark. There are many functions which satisfy the requirement to be the complement operator of interval neutrosophic sets. Here we give one example.\nDefinition 15 (Complement CN1) The complement of an interval neutrosophic set A is denoted by A and is defined by\nT A (x) = FA(x); inf I\nA (x) = 1− sup IA(x);\nsup I A (x) = 1− inf IA(x); F A (x) = TA(x); for all x in X.\nDefinition 16 (N-norm) Let IN denote a neutrosophic intersection of two interval neutrosophic sets A and B. Then IN is a function IN : N ×N → N and IN must satisfy at least the following four axiomatic requirements:\n1. IN (A(x), 1) = A(x), for all x in X. (boundary condition). 2. B(x) ≤ C(x) implies IN (A(x), B(x)) ≤ IN (A(x), C(x)), for all x in X. (monotonicity). 3. IN (A(x), B(x)) = IN (B(x), A(x)), for all x in X. (commutativity). 4. IN (A(x), IN (B(x), C(x))) = IN (IN (A(x), B(x)), C(x)), for all x in X. (associativity).[42]. Remark. Here we give one example of intersection of two interval neutrosophic sets which satis es\nabove N-norm axiomatic requirements. Other diferent definitions can be given for different applications\n309\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\nDefinition 17 (Intersection IN1) The intersection of two interval neutrosophic sets A and B is an interval neutrosophic set C, written as C = A∩B, whose truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership, and false-membership are related to those of A and B by\ninf TC(x) = min(inf TA(x); inf TB(x)), supTC(x) = min(supTA(x); supTB(x)), inf IC(x) = max(inf IA(x); inf IB(x)), sup IC(x) = max(sup IA(x); sup IB(x)), inf FC(x) = max(inf FA(x); inf FB(x)), supFC(x) = max(supFA(x); supFB(x)); for all x in X.\nDefinition 18 (N-conorm) Let UN denote a neutrosophic union of two interval neutrosophic sets A and B. Then UN is a function UN : N ×N → N\nand UN must satisfy at least the following four axiomatic requirements: 1. UN (A(x), 0) = A(x), for all x in X. (boundary condition). 2. B(x) ≤ C(x) implies UN (A(x), B(x)) ≤ UN (A(x), C(x)), for all x in X. (monotonicity). 3. UN (A(x), B(x)) = UN (B(x), A(x)), for all x in X. (commutativity). 4. UN (A(x), UN (B(x), C(x))) = UN (UN (A(x), B(x)), C(x)), for all x in X. (associativity). [42]. Remark. Here we give one example of union of two interval neutrosophic sets which satis es above\nN-conorm axiomatic requirements. Other different definitions can be given for different applications.\nDefinition 19 (Union UN1) The union of two interval neutrosophic sets A and B is an interval neutrosophic set C, written as C = A ∪ B, whose truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership, and falsemembership are related to those of A and B by\ninf TC(x) = max(inf TA(x); inf TB(x)), supTC(x) = max(supTA(x); supTB(x)), inf IC(x) = min(inf IA(x); inf IB(x)), sup IC(x) = min(sup IA(x); sup IB(x)), inf FC(x) = min(inf FA(x); inf FB(x)), supFC(x) = min(supFA(x); supFB(x)), for all x in X.\n3.3. Results.\nProposition 1. Let A be an IFS in X, and j(A) be the corresponding INS. We have that the complement of j(A) is not necessarily j(A).\nProof. If A =< x, µA, γA > is j(A) =< µA, 0, γA > . Then , for 0∼ =< x, 0, 1 > is j(0∼) = j(< x, 0, 1 >) =< 0, 0, 1 >6= 0 =< 0, 1, 1 > for 1∼ =< x, 1, 0 > is j(1∼) = j(< x, 1, 0 > ) =< 1, 0, 0 >= 1 Thus, 1∼ = 0∼ and j( 1∼) = 1 6= CN (j(0∼)) because CN (1) = 0 6= j(0∼).\nDefinition 20 Let’s construct a neutrosophic topology on NT =]−0, 1+[, considering the associated family of standard or non-standard subsets included in NT , and the empty set which is closed under set union and finite intersection neutrosophic. The interval NT endowed with this topology forms a neutrosophic topological space. [35].\nProposition 2. Let (X, τ) be an intuitionistic fuzzy topological space. Then, the family of INSs {j(U)|U ∈ τ} is not necessarily a neutrosophic topology.\nProof. Let τ = {1∼, 0∼, A} where A =< x, 1/2, 1/2 > then j(1∼) = 1, j(0∼) =< 0, 0, 1 >6= ∅ and j(A) =< 1/2, 0, 1/2 >. Thus {j(1∼), j(0∼), j(A)} is not a neutrosophic topology, because the empty INS is not in this family.\n310\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n4 NEUTROSOPHIC PARACONSISTENT TOPOLOGY\nThe history of paraconsistent logic is not very long. It was designed by S. Jaskowski in 1948. Without knowing the work of this author, N.C. A. da Costa, from 1958, using different methods and ideas, began to make statements about this type of logic. After other logicians have developed independently, new systems of paraconsistent logic, as Routley, Meyer, Priest, Asenjo, Sette, Anderson and Benalp, Wolf (with da Costa himself), .... At present there is a thriving movement dedicated to the study of paraconsistent logic in several countries. In the philosophical aspect has meant, in some cases, a real opening of horizons, for example, in the treatment of the paradoxes, in efforts to treat rigorously dialectical thinking, in fact possible to develop a set theory inconsistent. .. Because of this, there is growing interest in understanding the nature and scope.\nJaskowski deductive logic led her to refer to several problems that caused the need for paraconsistent logic:\n1) The problem of organizing deductive theories that contain contradictions, as in the dialectic: ”The principle that no two contradictory statements are both true and false is the safest of all.”\n2) To study theories that there are contradictions engendered by vagueness: ”The contemporary formal approach to logic increases the accuracy of research in many fields, but it would be inappropriate to formulate the principle of contradiction of Aristotle thus:”Two contradictory propositions are not true”. We need to add:”in the same language”or ”if the words that are part of those have the same meaning”. This restriction is not always found in daily use, and also science, we often use terms that are more or less vague.\n3) To study directly some postulates or empirical theories whose basic meanings are contradictory. This applies, for example, the physics at the present stage.\nObjectives and method of construction of paraconsistent logics can be mentioned, besides those mentioned by Jaskowski:\n1) To study directly the logical and semantic paradoxes, for example, if we directly study the paradoxes of set theory (without trying to avoid them, as it normally is), we need to construct theories of sets of such paradoxes arising, but without being formal antinomies. In this case we need a paraconsistent logic.\n2) Better understand the concept of negation. 3) Have logic systems on which to base the paraconsistent theories. For example, set up logical systems for different versions and possibly stronger than standard theories of sets, of dialectics, and of certain physical theories that , perhaps, are inconsistent (some versions of quantum mechanics).\nVarious authors [31] worked on ”paraconsistent Logics”, that is, logics where some contradiction is admissible. We remark the theories exposed by Da Costa [10], Routley and other [34], and Peña [29,30].\nSmarandache defined also the neutrosophic paraconsistent sets [Sm5] and he proposed a natural definition of neutrosophic paraconsistent topology.\nA problem that we consider is the possible relation between this concept of neutrosophic paraconsistent topology and the previous notions of general neutrosophic topology and intuitionistic fuzzy topology. We show in this chapter that neutrosophic paraconsistent topology is not an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy topology.\nFirst, we present some basic definitions:\nDefinition 21 Let M be a non-empty set. A general neutrosophic topology on M is a family Ψ of neutrosophic sets in M satisfying the following axioms:\n(a) 0∼ = x(0, 0, 1) ,1∼ = x(1, 0, 0) ∈ Ψ (b) If A,B ∈ Ψ , then A ∩B ∈ Ψ (c) If a family {Aj |j ∈ J} ⊂ Ψ,then ∪Aj ∈ Ψ. [40]\nDefinition 22 A neutrosophic set x(T, I, F ) is called paraconsistent if inf(T ) + inf(I) + inf(F ) > 1.[39]\nDefinition 23 For neutrosophic paraconsistent sets 0 = x(0, 1, 1) and 1 = x(1, 1, 0).(Smarandache).\nRemark. If we use the unary neutrosophic negation operator for neutrosophic sets [40], nN (x(T, I, F )) = x(F, I, T ) by interchanging the thuth T and falsehood F components, we have that nN (0 ) = 1 .\n311\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\nDefinition 24 Let X be a non-empty set. A family Φ of neutrosophic paraconsistent sets in X will called a neutrosophic paraconsistent topology if:\n(a) 0 and 1 ∈ Φ (b) If A,B ∈ Φ, then A ∩B ∈ Φ (c) Any union of a subfamily of paraconsistent sets of Φ is also in Φ. (Smarandache). Results.\nProposition 1. The neutrosophic paraconsistent topology is not an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy\ntopology. Proof. We have that 0∼ =< x, 0, 1 > and 1∼ =< x, 1, 0 > are members of all intuitionistic fuzzy topology, but x(0, 0, 1) ∈ j(0∼) 6= 0 , and, x(1, 0, 0) ∈ j(1∼) 6= 1 .\nProposition 2. A neutrosophic paraconsistent topology is not a general neutrosophic topology. Proof. Let the family {1 , 0 } . Clearly it is a neutrosophic paraconsistent topology, but 0∼,1∼ are\nnot in this family.\nREFERENCES [1] K.T.Atanassov :”Intuitionistic fuzzy sets”, paper presented at the VII ITKR’s Session, Sofia (June 1983).

Introduction Smarandache [26, 27] introduced the notion of neutrosophic sets, which is a generalization of Zadeh's fuzzy set [28]. In Zadah's sense, there is no precise definition for the set. Later on, Atanassov presented the idea of the intuitionistic fuzzy set [1], where he goes beyond the degree of membership introducing the degree of non-membership of some element in the set. The new presented concepts attracted several authors to develop the classical mathematics. For instance, Chang [2] and Lowen [6] started the discipline known as \"Fuzzy Topology\", where they forwarded the concepts from fuzzy sets to the classical topological spaces. Furthermore, Salama et al. [14, 17, 20] established several notations for what they called, \"Neutrosophic topological spaces\"].\nIn this paper, we study in more details some weaker and stronger structures constructed from the neutrosophic crisp topology introduced in [7], as well as the concepts neutrosophic crisp interior and the neutrosophic closure.\nThe remaining of this paper is structured as follows: in §2, some basic definitions are presented, while the new concepts of neutrosophic crisp nearly open sets are introduced in §3, in addition to providing a study of some of its properties. The neutrosophic crisp continuous function and neutrosophic crisp compact spaces are presented in §4 and §5, respectively.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n316\n2. Terminologies We recollect some relevant basic preliminaries, in particular, the work introduced by We recollect some relevant basic preliminaries, in particular, the work introduced by Smarandache and Salama [7], Salama et al.

Definition 2.1 [7]\nLet \uD835\uDC4B be a non-empty fixed sample space. A neutrosophic crisp set (\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC46 for short) \uD835\uDC34 is an object having the form \uD835\uDC34 = (\uD835\uDC341, \uD835\uDC342, \uD835\uDC343) where \uD835\uDC341, \uD835\uDC342 and \uD835\uDC343 are subsets of \uD835\uDC4B. Where \uD835\uDC341 contains all those members of the space X that accept the event A and \uD835\uDC343 contains all those members of the space X that rejected the event A, while \uD835\uDC342 contains those who stand in a distance from accepting or rejecting A. Definition 2.2\nSalama [7] defined the object having the form \uD835\uDC34 = (\uD835\uDC341, \uD835\uDC342, \uD835\uDC343) to be 1) (Neutrosophic Crisp Set with Type 1),if satisfying \uD835\uDC341∩\uD835\uDC342=∅ , \uD835\uDC341∩\uD835\uDC343 =∅ and \uD835\uDC342∩\uD835\uDC343 = ∅.\n(\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC46 -Type 1 ). 2) (Neutrosophic Crisp Set with Type 2), if satisfying \uD835\uDC341∩\uD835\uDC342=∅ , \uD835\uDC341∩\uD835\uDC343 =∅ and \uD835\uDC342∩\uD835\uDC343 = ∅\nand \uD835\uDC341∪\uD835\uDC342∪\uD835\uDC343 = \uD835\uDC4B (\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC46 -Type 2 ). 3) (Neutrosophic Crisp Set with Type 3) if satisfying \uD835\uDC341∩\uD835\uDC342∩\uD835\uDC343 = ∅ and \uD835\uDC341∪\uD835\uDC342∪\uD835\uDC343 = \uD835\uDC4B.\n(\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC46 -Type3 for short) .

In particular: Either all or none of the neutrosophic crisp topologies of a \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDEFC – class are\nextremely disconnected. Proof\nLet \uD835\uDEE4\uD835\uDEFD = \uD835\uDC35, and suppose there is \uD835\uDC34∊\uD835\uDEE4 such that \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC59(\uD835\uDC34)∉\uD835\uDEE4.

The intersection \uD835\uDC35∩ \uD835\uDEED= {\uD835\uDC43} is not neutrosophic crisp open, since \uD835\uDC43∈ \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC59(\uD835\uDC34)∩\uD835\uDEEDc hence not \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDEFD- open.

Also the characterization of Hausdorff extensions of spaces\nin single valued neutrosophic S∗ centered systems are established.\nKeywords\nSingle valued neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic structure space, single valued\nneutrosophic S∗ centered system, single valued neutrosophic S∗θ− homeomorphism, single\nvalued neutrosophic S∗θ− continuous functions.\n1. Introduction\nFlorentin Smarandache [ 8, 9] combined the non- standard analysis with a tri component logic/set, probabi l i ty t heor y with philosophy and proposed the term neutrosophy which means knowledge of neutral thoughts. This neutral represents the main distinction b e t w e e n fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy logic set. In 1998, Florent in Smarandache defined the neutrosophic set [8, 9]. Florentin Smarandache and his colleagues [5] presented an instance of neutrosophic set, called single valued neutrosophic set. Alexandrov [1] developed a method of centered systems for studying compact extensions of topological spaces. The method o f centered sys t ems in topological spaces was studied b y Iliadis [6] and in fuzzy topological spaces by Uma et al. [10]. We extend the same in single valued neutrosophic topological spaces.\n2. Preliminaries\nDefinition 2.1. [5]\nLet X be a space of points (objects), with a generic element in X denoted by x. A single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) A in X is characterized by truth-membership function TA, indeterminacymembership function IA and falsity-membership function FA.\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n328\nFor each point x in X, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) ∈ [0,1]. When X is continuous, a SVNS A can be written as A, XxxxFxIxTX AAA  ,/)(),(),( .\nWhen X is discrete, a SVNS A can be written as\nXxxxFxIxTA ii n\ni iii   ,/)(),(),( 1\nDefinition 2.2: [10]\nLet R be a fuzzy Hausdorff space. A system p = {λα} of fuzzy open sets of R is called fuzzy centered if any finite collection of the fuzzy sets of the system has a nonempty intersection. The system p is called a maximal fuzzy centered system or a fuzzy end if it cannot be included in any larger fuzzy centered system of fuzzy open sets.\nDefinition 2.3: [10]\nLet θ(R) denote the collection of all fuzzy ends belonging to a given fuzzy Hausdorff space R. A fuzzy topology introduces into θ(R) in the following way. Let Pλ be the set of all fuzzy ends that contain λ as an element, where λ is a fuzzy open set of R. Therefore, Pλ is a fuzzy neighbourhood of each fuzzy end contained in Pλ.\n3. Single valued neutrosophic S* Hausdorff extension spaces\nDefinition 3.1\nLet X be a non- empty set and S be a collection of all single valued neutrosophic sets of\nX. A single valued neutrosophic S∗structure on S is a collection S∗ of subsets of S having the following properties:\n1. φ and S are in S∗.\n2. The union of the elements of any sub collection of S∗ is in S∗.\n3. The intersection of the elements of any finite sub collection of S∗ is in S∗.\nThe collection S together with the structure S∗ is called single valued neutrosophic S∗\nstructure space. The members of S∗ are called single valued neutrosophic S∗ open sets. The\ncomplement of single valued neutrosophic S∗ open set is said to be a single valued\nneutrosophic S∗ closed set.\nExample 3.2:\nLet },{ baX  , \n  \n\n  \n 6.0,4.0,7.0 , 5.0,3.0,8.0\nbaS ,  4321 * ,,,,, SSSSSS  where,\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n329\n, 8.0,2.0,5.0 , 7.0,1.0,6.01 \n  \n\n    baS\n\n  \n\n  \n 9.0,3.0,5.0 , 6.0,2.0,4.02 baS ,          9.0,2.0,5.0 , 7.0,1.0,4.03 baS ,\n. 8.0,3.0,5.0 , 6.0,2.0,6.04 \n  \n\n    baS\nHere ),( *SS is a structure space.\nDefinition 3.3:\nLet A be a member of S.

Introduction\nFlorentin Smarandache [9] combined the non- standard analysis with a tri component logic/set, probability theory with philosophy and proposed the term neutrosophic which means knowledge of neutral thoughts. This neutral represents the main distinction between fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy logic set. In 1998, Florentin Smarandache [6] defined the single valued neutrosophic set involving the concept of standard analysis. Stone [10, 11] applied the apparatus of Boolean rings to investigate spaces more general than completely regular ones, related to some extent to the function-theoretic approach. Using these methods tone [10, 11] obtained a number of important results on Hausdorff spaces and in fact introduced the important topological construction that was later called the absolute. The first proof of Alexandrov-Urysohn compactness criterion without any axiom of countability was given by Stone [10, 11].Cech extension in topological spaces and Alexandrov-Urysohn compactness criterion were constructed by Iliadis and Fomin[7].\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n346\nIn this paper, the concept of absolute in single valued neutrosophic S∗ structure space\nand the single valued neutrosophic S∗ maximal compact extension β(S) (single valued\nneutrosophic S∗ cech extension) of an arbitrary single valued neutrosophic S∗ completely regular space is introduced. Further, the Alexandrov -Urysohn compactness criterion on\nsingle valued neutrosophic S∗ structure has been studied.\n2. Preliminaries\nDefinition 2.1: [6]\nLet X be a space of points (objects), with a generic element in X denoted by x. A single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) A in X is characterized by truth-membership function TA, indeterminacymembership function IA and falsity-membership function FA.\nFor each point x in X, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) ∈ [0,1]. When X is continuous, a SVNS A can be written as A, XxxxFxIxT\nX AAA  ,/)(),(),( .\nWhen X is discrete, a SVNS A can be written as\nXxxxFxIxTA ii n\ni iii   ,/)(),(),( 1\nDefinition 2.2: [3]\nLet X be a non- empty set and S a collection of all single valued neutrosophic sets of X.A\nsingle valued neutrosophic S∗ structure on S is a collection S∗ of subsets of S having the following properties\n1. φ and S are in S∗.\n2. The union of the elements of any sub-collection of S∗ is in S∗.\n3.

Basic definitions for neutrosophic morphological operations are extracted and a study of its algebraic properties is presented. In our work we demonstrate that neutrosophic morphological operations inherit properties and restrictions of Fuzzy Mathematical Morphology.\nKeywords Crisp sets operations, fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, mathematical morphology, fuzzy mathematical morphology.\n1. Introduction Established in 1964, Mathematical Morphology was firstly introduced by Georges Matheron and Jean Serra, as a branch of image processing [12]. As morphology is the study of shapes, Mathematical Morphology mostly deals with the mathematical theory of describing shapes using set theory. In image processing, the basic morphological operators dilation, erosion, opening and closing form the fundamentals of this theory [12]. A morphological operator transforms an image into another image, using some structuring element which can be chosen by the user. Mathematical Morphology stands somewhat apart from traditional linear image processing, since the basic operations of morphology are non-linear in nature, and thus make use of a totally different type of algebra than the linear algebra. At first, the theory was purely based on set theory and operators which defined for binary cases only. Later on the theory was extended to the grayscale images as the theory of lattices was introduced, hence, a representation theory for image processing was given [7]. As a scientific branch, Mathematical Morphology expanded worldwide during the 1990’s. It is also during that period, different models based on fuzzy set theory were introduced [3, 4]. Today, Mathematical Morphology remains a challenging research field [6, 7].\nIn 1995, Samarandache initiated the theory of neutrosophic set as new mathematical tool for handling problems involving imprecise indeterminacy, and inconsistent data [14]. Later on, several researchers such as Bhowmik and Pal [2], and Salama [11], studied the concept of neutrosophic\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n364\nset. Neutrosophy introduces a new concept which represents indeterminacy with respect to some event, which can solve certain problems that cannot be solved by fuzzy logic.\nThis work is devoted for introducing the neutrosophic concepts to Mathematical Morphology. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In §2, we introduce the fundamental definitions from the Mathematical Morphology whereas, the concepts of Fuzzy Morphology are introduced in §3. The basic definitions for Neutrosophic Morphological operations are extracted and a study of its algebraic properties is presented in §4.\n2. Mathematical Morphology [5] Basically, Mathematical Morphology describes an image's regions in the form of sets. Where the image is considered to be the universe with values are pixels in the image, hence, standard set notations can be used to describe image operations [7]. The essential idea, is to explore an image with a simple, pre-defined shape, drawing conclusions on how this shape fits or misses the shapes in the image [12]. This simple pre-defined shape is called the \"structuring element\", and it is usually small relative to the image.\nIn the case of digital images, a simple binary structuring elements like a cross or a square is used. The structuring elements can be placed at any pixel in the image, nevertheless, the rotation is not allowed. In this process, some reference pixel whose position defines where the structuring element is to be placed. The choice of this reference pixel is often arbitrary.\n2.1. Binary Morphology In binary morphology, an image is viewed as a subset of an Euclidean space Rn or the integer grid Zn, for some dimension n. The structuring element is a binary image (i.e., a subset of the space or the grid). In this section we briefly review the basic morphological operations, the dilation, the erosion, the opening and the closing.\n2.1.1. Binary Dilation: (Minkowski addition) Dilation is one of the basic operations in Mathematical Morphology, which originally developed for binary images [15]. The dilation operation uses a structuring element for exploring and expanding the shapes contained in the input image. In binary morphology, dilation is a shiftinvariant (translation invariant) operator, strongly related to the Minkowski addition.\nFor any Euclidean space E and a binary image A in E, the dilation of A by some structuring element B is defined by: \uD835\uDC34⨁\uD835\uDC35 = ∪\n\uD835\uDC4F∈\uD835\uDC35 \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC4F where \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC4F is the translate of the set A along the vector\nb, i.e., \uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDC4F={\uD835\uDC4E + \uD835\uDC4F ∈ \uD835\uDC38|\uD835\uDC4E ∈ \uD835\uDC34 , \uD835\uDC4F ∈ \uD835\uDC35}.\nThe dilation is commutative, and may also be given by: \uD835\uDC34⨁\uD835\uDC35 = \uD835\uDC35⨁\uD835\uDC34 = ∪ \uD835\uDC4E∈\uD835\uDC34 \uD835\uDC35\uD835\uDC4E .\nAn interpretation of the dilation of A by B can be understood as, if we put a copy of B at each pixel in A and union all of the copies, then we get \uD835\uDC34⨁\uD835\uDC35.\nThe dilation can also be obtained by: \uD835\uDC34⨁\uD835\uDC35 = {\uD835\uDC4F ∈ \uD835\uDC38 |(−\uD835\uDC35) ∩ \uD835\uDC34 ≠ ∅}, where (–B) denotes the reflection of B, that is, −\uD835\uDC35 = {\uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC38|−\uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC35}.\nWhere the reflection satisfies the following property: −(\uD835\uDC34⨁\uD835\uDC35) = (−\uD835\uDC34)⨁(−\uD835\uDC35)\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n365\n2.1.2. Binary Erosion: (Minkowski subtraction) Strongly related to the Minkowski subtraction, the erosion of the binary image A by the\nstructuring element B is defined by: \uD835\uDC34 ⊖ \uD835\uDC35 = ⋂ \uD835\uDC4F∈\uD835\uDC35 \uD835\uDC34−\uD835\uDC4F.\nUnlike dilation, erosion is not commutative, much like how addition is commutative while subtraction is not [8, 15]. An interpretation for the erosion of A by B can be understood as, if we again put a copy of B at each pixel in A, this time we count only those copies whose translated structuring elements lie entirely in A; hence \uD835\uDC34 ⊖ \uD835\uDC35 is all pixels in A that these copies were translated to. The erosion of A by B is also may be given by the expression: A ⊖ B = {p ∈ E |Bp ⊆ A}, where \uD835\uDC35\uD835\uDC5D is the translation of B by the vector p, i.e.,\n\uD835\uDC35\uD835\uDC5D = {\uD835\uDC4F + \uD835\uDC5D ∈ \uD835\uDC38 |\uD835\uDC4F ∈ \uD835\uDC35}, ∀ \uD835\uDC5D ∈ \uD835\uDC38.\n2.1.3. Binary Opening [15] The opening of A by B is obtained by the erosion of A by B, followed by dilation of the resulting\nimage by B: \uD835\uDC34 ∘ \uD835\uDC35 = (\uD835\uDC34 ⊖ \uD835\uDC35) ⊕ \uD835\uDC35.\nThe opening is also given by \uD835\uDC34 ∘ \uD835\uDC35 = ∪ \uD835\uDC35\uD835\uDC65⊆\uD835\uDC34 \uD835\uDC35\uD835\uDC65, which means that, an opening can be consider to be the union of all translated copies of the structuring element that can fit inside the object. Generally, openings can be used to remove small objects and connections between objects.\n2.1.4. Binary Closing [6] The closing of A by B is obtained by the dilation of A by B, followed by erosion of the resulting\nstructure by B:A • B = (\uD835\uDC34 ⊕ \uD835\uDC35) ⊖ \uD835\uDC35.\nThe closing can also be obtained by A • B = (Ac ∘ (−B))c, where Ac denotes the complement of A relative to E (that is, Ac = {\uD835\uDC4E ∈ \uD835\uDC38 |\uD835\uDC4E ∉ \uD835\uDC34}). Whereas opening removes all pixels where the structuring element won’t fit inside the image foreground, closing fills in all places where the structuring element will not fit in the image background, that is opening removes small objects, while closing removes small holes.\n2.2. Properties of the Basic Binary Operations Here are some properties of the basic binary morphological operations (dilation, erosion, opening and closing[8]). We define the power set of X, denoted by P(X), to be the set of all crisp subset of X.\nFor all A, B, C ∈ \uD835\uDC43(\uD835\uDC4B), the following properties hold:\n \uD835\uDC34⨁\uD835\uDC35 = \uD835\uDC35⨁\uD835\uDC34,\n \uD835\uDC34 ⊆ \uD835\uDC35 ⟹ (\uD835\uDC34 ⊕ \uD835\uDC36) ⊆ (\uD835\uDC35 ⊕ \uD835\uDC36),\n \uD835\uDC34 ⊆ (\uD835\uDC34 ⊕ \uD835\uDC35),\n (\uD835\uDC34 ⊕ \uD835\uDC35) ⊕ \uD835\uDC36 = \uD835\uDC34 ⊕ (\uD835\uDC35 ⊕ \uD835\uDC36), and (\uD835\uDC34 ⊖ \uD835\uDC35) ⊖ \uD835\uDC36 = \uD835\uDC34 ⊖ (\uD835\uDC35 ⊖ \uD835\uDC36),  Erosion and dilation satisfy the duality that is:\nA ⊕ B = (Ac ⊖ (−B))c, and A ⊖ B = (Ac ⊕ (−B))c,\n \uD835\uDC34 ⊆ \uD835\uDC35 ⟹ (\uD835\uDC34 ∘ \uD835\uDC36) ⊆ (\uD835\uDC35 ∘ \uD835\uDC36),\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n366\n A ∘ B ⊆ \uD835\uDC34,  Opening and closing satisfy the duality that is:\nA • B = (Ac ∘ (−B))c, and A ∘ B = (Ac • (−B)) c .\n3. Fuzzy Mathematical Morphology\nWhen operations are expressed in algebraic or logical terms, one powerful approach leading to good properties consists of formally replacing the classical symbols in the equations by their fuzzy equivalent. This framework led to an infinity of fuzzy Mathematical Morphologies, which are constructed in families with specific properties described in [3, 13].\n3.1. Fuzzy Set Since introduced by Zadeh [16], fuzzy sets have received a great deal of interest [17]. For an ordinary set, a given element either belongs or does not belong to the set, whereas for a fuzzy set the membership of an element is determined by the value of a given membership function, which assigns to each element a degree of membership ranging between zero and one.\n3.1.1. Definition [16]\nLet X be a fixed set. A fuzzy set \uD835\uDC34 of X is an object having the form \uD835\uDC34 = ⟨ \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34 ⟩, where the function ]1,0[: XA defines the degree of membership of the element \uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B to the set \uD835\uDC34. The set of all fuzzy subset of X is denoted by ℱ(\uD835\uDC4B).\nThe fuzzy empty set in X is denoted by 0\uD835\uDC53 = 〈 0 〉, \uD835\uDC64ℎ\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC52 0 ∶ \uD835\uDC4B ⟶ [0 ,1 ] and 0(\uD835\uDC65) = 0, ∀\uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B. Moreover, the fuzzy universe set in X is denoted by 1\uD835\uDC53 = 〈 1 〉, \uD835\uDC64ℎ\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC52 1 ∶ \uD835\uDC4B ⟶ [0 ,1 ] \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC51 1(\uD835\uDC65) = 1, ∀\uD835\uDC65 ∈ \uD835\uDC4B.\n3.2. Fuzzy Mathematical Operations [4] The fuzziness concept was introduced to the morphology by defining the degree to which the structuring element fits into the image. The operations of dilation and erosion of a fuzzy image by a fuzzy structuring element having a bounded support, are defined in terms of their membership functions.\n3.2.1. Fuzzy Dilation [4] Let us consider the notion of dilation within the original formulation of Mathematical Morphology in Euclidean space E. For any two n-dimensional gray-scale images, A and B, the fuzzy dilation, \uD835\uDC34 ⊕ \uD835\uDC35 = 〈\uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34⊕\uD835\uDC35〉, of A by the structuring element B is an n-dimensional grayscale image, that is: \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34⊕\uD835\uDC35 ∶ \uD835\uDC4D2 ⟶ [0,1], and\n\uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34⊕\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC63) = \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC5D \uD835\uDC62∈\uD835\uDC4D2 \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B[ \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC63 + \uD835\uDC62), \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC62)]\nWhere \uD835\uDC62, \uD835\uDC63 ∈ \uD835\uDC4D2 are the spatial co-ordinates of pixels in the image and the structuring element; while \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34 , \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC35 are the membership functions of the image and the structuring element, respectively.\n3.2.2. Fuzzy Erosion [4]\nFor any two n-dimensional gray-scale image, A and B, the fuzzy erosion \uD835\uDC34 ⊖ \uD835\uDC35 = 〈 \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34⊖\uD835\uDC35〉\nof A by the structuring element B is an n-dimensional gray-scale image, that is:\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n367\n\uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34⊖\uD835\uDC35 ∶ \uD835\uDC4D 2 ⟶ [0,1], and\n\uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34⊖\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC63) = \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC53 \uD835\uDC62∈\uD835\uDC4D2 \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65[\uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC63 + \uD835\uDC62), 1 − \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC62)]\nwhere u, v \uD835\uDC4D2are the spatial co-ordinates of pixels in the image and the structuring element; while \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC35 are the membership functions of the image and the structuring element respectively.\n3.2.3. Fuzzy Closing and Fuzzy Opening [3] In a similar way the two fuzzy operations for closing and opening for any two n-dimensional\ngray-scale images, A and B, are defined as follows:\n\uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34•\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC63) = \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC53 \uD835\uDC62∈\uD835\uDC4D2 \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 ( \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC5D \uD835\uDC64∈\uD835\uDC4D2 \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B (\uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC63 − \uD835\uDC62 + \uD835\uDC64), \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC62)), 1 − \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC62))\n\uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34∘\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC63) = \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC5D \uD835\uDC62∈\uD835\uDC4D2 \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B ( \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC53 \uD835\uDC64∈\uD835\uDC4D2 \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 (\uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC63 − \uD835\uDC62 + \uD835\uDC64), \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC62)), 1 − \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC62))\nwhere u, v, w \uD835\uDC4D2 are the spatial co-ordinates of pixels in the image and the structuring element; while \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDF07\uD835\uDC35 are the membership functions of the image and the structuring element respectively.\n3.3.

Neutrosophic Approach to Mathematical Morphology\nSmarandache [14] introduced the neutrosophic components (T, I, F) which represent the membership, indeterminacy, and non-membership values respectively, \uD835\uDC47 , \uD835\uDC3C , \uD835\uDC39 ∶ \uD835\uDC4B →] - 0,1+[ where ]-0,1+[ is non-standard unit interval. Let ε > 0 be some infinitesimal number, hence,  11 and .00 \n4.1. Neutrosophic Sets [1]\nWe denote the set of all neutrosophic subset of X by \uD835\uDCA9(\uD835\uDC4B). In [1, 14], the authors gave different definition for the concept of the neutrosophic sets. For more convenience we are choosing the following definitions to follow up our work for neutrosophic morphology. In the following definitions, we consider a space E and two neutrosophic subsets of X; \uD835\uDC34, \uD835\uDC35 ∈ \uD835\uDCA9(\uD835\uDC4B).\n4.1.1.

Neutrosophic Mathematical Morphology In this section we introduce the concept of neutrosophic morphology based on the fact that the basic morphological operators make use of fuzzy set operators, or equivalently, crisp logical operators. Hence, such expressions can easily be extended using the context of neutrosophic sets.\n4.2.1.

The operations of neutrosophic erosion, dilation, opening and closing of the neutrosophic image by neutrosophic structuring element, are defined in terms of their membership, indeterminacy and non-membership functions; which is defined for the first time as far as we know.\n4.3.1. The Operation of Dilation The process of the structuring element B on the image A and moving it across the image in a way like convolution is defined as dilation operation. The two main inputs for the dilation operator [7] are the image which is to be dilated and a set of coordinate points known as a structuring element which may be considered as a kernel. The exact effect of the dilation on the input image is determined by this structuring element [6].\n4.3.1.1. Definition: (Neutrosophic Dilation) let A and B are two neutrosophic sets; then the neutrosophic dilation is given as\n(A ⊕̃ B) = ⟨TA⊕̃B , IA⊕̃B , FA⊕̃B⟩, where for each u and v ∈ \uD835\uDC4D2.\n\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC34⊕̃\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC63) = \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC5D \uD835\uDC62∈\uD835\uDC4D\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B(\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC63 + \uD835\uDC62), \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC62))\n\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC34⊕̃\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC63) = sup \uD835\uDC62∈\uD835\uDC4D\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B(\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC63 + \uD835\uDC62), \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC62))\n\uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34⊕̃\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC63) = \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC53 \uD835\uDC62∈\uD835\uDC4D\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65(1 − \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC63 + \uD835\uDC62), 1 − \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC35(\uD835\uDC62))\n4.3.2. The Operation of Erosion The erosion process is as same as dilation, but the pixels are converted to 'white', not 'black'.\nThe two main inputs for the erosion operator [12], are the image which is to be eroded and\na structuring element. The exact effect of the erosion on the input image is determined by this structuring element. The following steps are the mathematical definition of erosion for gray-scale images.\n4.3.2.1.

The Operation of Opening and Closing The combination of the two main operations, dilation and erosion, can produce more complex sequences. Opening and closing are the most useful of these for morphological filtering [8]. An opening operation is defined as erosion followed by a dilation using the same structuring element for both operations. The basic two inputs for opening operator are an image to be opened, and a structuring element. Gray-level opening consists simply of gray-level erosion followed by graylevel dilation. The morphological opening ∘ and closing • are defined by:\n\uD835\uDC34 ∘̃ \uD835\uDC35 = (\uD835\uDC34 ⊖̃ \uD835\uDC35) ⊕̃ \uD835\uDC35\nA •̃ B = (\uD835\uDC34 ⊕̃ \uD835\uDC35) ⊖̃ \uD835\uDC35 From a granularity perspective, opening and closing provide coarser descriptions of the set A. The opening describes A as closely as possible using not the individual pixels but by fitting (possibly overlapping) copies of E within A. The closing describes the complement of A by fitting copies of E* outside A. The actual set is always contained within these two extremes: A ∘̃ B ⊆ \uD835\uDC34 ⊆ \uD835\uDC34 •̃ B and the informal notion of fitting copies of E, or of E*, within a set is made precise in these equations:\nThe operator \uD835\uDCA9(E)→ \uD835\uDCA9(E) : A → A∘̃ B is called the opening by B; it is the composition of the erosion ⊖, followed by the dilation ⊕. On the other hand, the operator \uD835\uDCA9(E) → \uD835\uDCA9(E) : A → A •̃ B is called the closing.\nTo understand what e.g., a closing operation does: imagine the closing applied to a set; the dilation will expand object boundaries, which will be partly undone by the following erosion. Small, (i.e., smaller than the structuring element) holes and thin tubelike structures in the interior or at the boundaries of objects will be filled up by the dilation, and not reconstructed by the erosion, inasmuch as these structures no longer have a boundary for the erosion to act upon. In this sense the term ’closing’ is a well-chosen one, as the operation removes holes and thin cavities.

Conclusion\nIn this paper, our aim was to establish a foundation for what we called, Neutrosophic Mathematical Morphology. It is a new approach to Mathematical Morphology based on neutrosophic set theory. Several basic definitions for Neutrosophic Morphological operations were extracted and a study of its algebraic properties was presented. In addition, we were able to prove that Neutrosophic Morphological operations inherit properties and restrictions of fuzzy Mathematical Morphology. In future, we plane to apply the introduced concepts in Image Processing. For instance, Image Smoothing, Enhancement and Retrieval, as well as in medical imaging.\nReferences 1. Alblowi, S.

It was presented as the study of origin, nature, and scope of neutralities; as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra. The aim of this paper is to introduce the concepts of smooth neutrosophic preuniform space, smooth neutrosophic preuniform subspace, and smooth neutrosophic preuniform mappings. Furthermore, some properties of these concepts will be investigated.\nKeywords\nFuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, smooth neutrosophic preuniformity, smooth neutrosophic preuniform subspace, smooth neutrosophic preuniform mappings.\n1. Introduction\nIn 1984, R. Badard [[3], [4]] introduced the concept of a fuzzy preuniformity and he discussed the links between fuzzy preuniformity and fuzzy pretopology. In 1986, R. Badard [6] introduced the basic idea of smooth structure, Badard et al. [5] (1993) investigated some properties of smooth preuniform. Ramadan et al. [10] (2003) introduced smooth topologies induced by a smooth uniformity and investigated some properties of them. In 1983 the intuitionistic fuzzy set was introduced by Atanassov [[1], [2], [7]], as a generalization of fuzzy sets in Zadeh’s sense [16], where besides the degree of membership of each element there was considered a degree of nonmembership. Smarandache [[13], [14], [15]], defined the notion of neutrosophic set, which is a generalization of Zadeh’s fuzzy sets and Atanassov’s intuitionistic fuzzy set. Neutrosophic sets have been investigated by Salama et al. [[11], [12]]. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concepts of smooth neutrosophic preunifrm space, smooth neutrosophic preuniform subspace, and smooth neutrosophic preuniform mappings. We also investigate some of their properties.\n2.

Conclusion\nIn this paper, the concepts of smooth neutrosophic preuniform structures were introduced. In two different types we’ve presented the concepts of smooth neutrosophic preuniform space, smooth neutrosophic preuniform subspace, smooth neutrosophic preuniform mappings. Due to unawareness of the behaviour of the degree of indeterminacy, we’ve chosen for IU to act like TU in the first type, while in the second type we preferred that IU behaves like FU .Therefore, the definitions given above can also be modified in several ways depending on the behaviour of IU .\nReferences 1.

The main idea was to consider an entity, ”A” in relation to its opposite ”Non-A”, and to that which is neither ”A” nor ” Non-A ”, denoted by ”Neut-A”. And from then on, neutrosophy became the basis of neutrosophic logic, neutrosophic probability, neutrosophic set, and neutrosophic statistics. According to this theory every idea ”A” tends to be neutralized and balanced by ”neutA” and ”nonA” ideas - as a state of equilibrium. In a classical way ”A”, ”neutA”, and ”antiA” are disjoint two by two. Nevertheless, since in many cases the borders between notions are vague and imprecise, it is possible that ”A”, ”neutA”, and ”antiA” have common parts two by two, or even all three of them as well.\nIn [10], [11], [12] , Smarandache introduced the fundamental concepts of neutrosophic sets, that had led Salama et al.( see for instance [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [8], [9], and the references therein) to provide a mathematical treatment for the neutrosophic phenomena which already existed in our real world. Hence, neutrosophic set theory turned out to be a generalization of both the classical and fuzzy counterparts.\nIn [4], Salama introduced the concept of neutrosophic crisp sets as a triple structure of the form, AN “ xA1,A2,A3y. The three components - A1,A2, and A3 - refer to three classes of the elements of the universe X with respect to an event A. Where A1 is the class containing those elements that are fully supportive to A, A3 for those elements that totally against A, and A2 for those elements that stand in a distance from being with or against A. The three classes are subsets of X. Furthermore, in [7] the authors suggested three different types of such neutrosophic crisp sets depending on whither there is an overlap between the three classes or not, and whither their union covers the universe or not.\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the elements of the universe which have not been subjected to the classification; those elements belonging to the complement of the union of the three classes. Hence, a fourth component is to be added to the already existed three classes in Salama’s sense.\nHEWAYDA ELGHAWALBY1, A. A. SALAMA2\n1 Faculty of Engineering, Port-Said University, Egypt.

E-mail: drsalama44@gmail.com\nUltra neutrosophic crisp sets and relations\nAbstract In this paper we present a new neutrosophic crisp family generated from the three components’ neutrosophic crisp sets presented by Salama [4]. The idea behind Salam’s neutrosophic crisp set was to classify the elements of a universe of discourse with respect to an event ”A” into three classes: one class contains those elements that are fully supportive to A, another class contains those elements that totally against A, and a third class for those elements that stand in a distance from being with or against A. Our aim here is to study the elements of the universe of discourse which their existence is beyond the three classes of the neutrosophic crisp set given by Salama. By adding more components we will get a four components’ neutrosophic crisp sets called the Ultra Neutrosophic Crisp Sets. Four types of set’s operations is defined and the properties of the new ultra neutrosophic crisp sets are studied. Moreover, a definition of the relation between two ultra neutrosophic crisp sets is given.\nKeywords Crisp Sets Operations, Crisp Sets Relations, Fuzzy Sets, Neutrosophic Crisp Sets\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n395\nFor the purpose of this paper, we will categorize the neutrosophic crisp sets of some universe X into two categories according to whither the union of the three classes covers the universe or not. The first category will contain all the neutrosophic crisp sets whose components do not cover the universe, whether they are mutually exclusive or they have some common parts in-between; two by two, or even all the three of them. While the second category will contain the remaining neutrosophic crisp sets whose components cover the whole universe.\nThe remaining of this paper is organized as follows: in (sec. 2) we introduce some basic definition necessary for this work. The concept of the ultra neutrosophic crisp sets is introduced in (sec. 3). Furthermore, four types of ultra neutrosophic crisp sets’ operations and its properties are presented in (sec. 4) and (sec. 5). Hence, the product and relation between ultra neutrosophic crisp sets are defined in (sec. 6), (sec. 7) and (sec. 8). Finally, conclusions are drawn and future directions of research are suggested in (sec. 9).\n2 PRELIMINARIES\n2.1 Neutrosophic Crisp Sets\n2.1.1 Definition [4] For any arbitrary universe X, a neutrosophic crisp set AN is a triple AN “ xA1,A2,A3y, where Ai P PpXq, i “ 1, 2, 3. The three components of AN represent a classification of the elements of X according to some event A; the subset A1 contains all the elements of X that are fully supportive to A, A3 contains those elements that totally against A, and A2 contains those elements that stand in a distance from being with or against A.\nIf we consider the event A in the ordinary sense, each neutrosophic crisp set will be in the form AN “ xA1, φ,Ac1y, while in the fuzzy sense it will be in the form AN “ xA1, φ,A3y, where A3 Ď A c 1. Moreover, in the intuitionistic fuzzy sense AN “ xA1, pA1 Y A3qc,A3y.\n2.1.2 Definition [4] The complement of a neutrosophic crisp set is defined as:\ncoAN “ xcoA1, coA2, coA3y\n2.1.3 Definition [7] A neutrosophic crisp set AN “ xA1,A2,A3y is called:\n– A neutrosophic crisp set of type1, if satisfying that: Ai X A j “ φ,where i ‰ j and Ť3 i“1 Ai Ă X, @i, j “ 1, 2, 3\n– A neutrosophic crisp set of type2, if satisfying that: Ai X A j “ φ,where i ‰ j and Ť3 i“1 Ai “ X, @i, j “ 1, 2, 3\n– A neutrosophic crisp set of type3, if satisfying that: Ş3\ni“1 Ai “ φ, and Ť3 i“1 Ai “ X, @i, j “ 1, 2, 3\n2.2 Neutrosophic Crisp Sets Operations of Type 1 [7]\nFor any two neutrosophic crisp sets AN and BN, we have that:\nAN Ď BN if A1 Ď B1,A2 Ď B2, and A3 Ě B3, AN “ BN if and only if Ai “ Bi for i “ 1, 2, 3.\nHence, we can define the following:\nAN Y BN “ xA1 Y B1,A2 Y B2,A3 X B3y AN X BN “ xA1 X B1,A2 X B2,A3 Y B3y\n396\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n2.3 Neutrosophic Crisp Sets Operations of Type 2 [7]\nFor any two neutrosophic crisp sets AN and BN, we have that:\nAN Ď BN if A1 Ď B1,A2 Ě B2, and A3 Ě B3, AN “ BN if and only if Ai “ Bi for i “ 1, 2, 3.\nHence, we can define the following:\nAN Y BN “ xA1 Y B1,A2 X B2,A3 X B3y AN X BN “ xA1 X B1,A2 Y B2,A3 Y B3y\n3 ULTRA NEUTROSOPHIC CRISP SETS\nIn this section we consider elements in X which do not belong to any of the three classes of the neutrosophic crisp set defined in (2.1.1).\n3.1 Definition\nLet X be any given universe, the ultra neutrosophic crisp set is defined as:\nĂ “ xA1,A2,A3,MAy, where MA “ cop 3 ď\ni“1 Aiq\nThe family of all ultra neutrosophic crisp sets in X will be denoted by ŬpXq.\n3.2 Definition\nThe complement of any ultra neutrosophic crisp set Ă, is defined as:\ncoĂ “ xcoA1, coA2, coA3, coMAy\n4 ULTRA NEUTROSOPHIC CRISP SETS OPERATIONS\n4.1 Ultra Operations of Type I\nFor any two ultra neutrosophic crisp sets Ă and B̆, we have that:\nĂ ĎI B̆ if A1 Ď B1,A2 Ď B2,A3 Ě B3, and MA Ě MB, Ă “ B̆ if and only if Ai “ Bi fori “ 1, 2, 3 and MA “ MB.\nHence, we can define the following:\nĂZI B̆ “ xA1 Y B1,A2 Y B2,A3 X B3,MA XMBy Ă `I B̆ “ xA1 X B1,A2 X B2,A3 Y B3,MA YMBy\n4.2 Ultra Operations of Type II\nFor any two ultra neutrosophic crisp sets Ă and B̆, we have that:\nĂ ĎII B̆ if A1 Ď B1,A2 Ě B2,A3 Ě B3, and MA Ě MB, Ă “ B̆ if and only if Ai “ Bi fori “ 1, 2, 3 and MA “ MB.\nHence, we can define the following:\nĂZII B̆ “ xA1 Y B1,A2 X B2,A3 X B3,MA XMBy Ă `II B̆ “ xA1 X B1,A2 Y B2,A3 Y B3,MA YMBy\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n397\n4.3 Ultra Operations of Type III\nFor any two ultra neutrosophic crisp sets Ă and B̆, we have that:\nĂ ĎIII B̆ if A1 Ď B1,A2 Ď B2,A3 Ě B3 and MA Ď MB, Ă “ B̆ if and only if Ai “ Bi fori “ 1, 2, 3 and MA “ MB.\nHence, we can define the following:\nĂZIII B̆ “ xA1 Y B1,A2 Y B2,A3 X B3,MA YMBy Ă `III B̆ “ xA1 X B1,A2 X B2,A3 Y B3,MA XMBy\n4.4 Ultra Operations of Type IV\nFor any two ultra neutrosophic crisp sets Ă and B̆, we have that:\nĂ ĎIV B̆ if A1 Ď B1,A2 Ě B2,A3 Ě B3 and MA Ď MB, Ă “ B̆ if and only if Ai “ Bi fori “ 1, 2, 3 and MA “ MB.\nHence, we can define the following:\nĂZIV B̆ “ xA1 Y B1,A2 X B2,A3 X B3,MA YMBy Ă `IV B̆ “ xA1 X B1,A2 Y B2,A3 Y B3,MA XMBy\n4.5 Definition\n– The difference between any two ultra neutrosophic crisp sets Ă and B̆, is defined as ĂzB̆ “ Ă` coB̆. – The symmetric difference between any two ultra neutrosophic crisp sets Ă and B̆, is defined as\nĂ À B̆ “ ĂzB̆Z B̆zĂ.\n5 PROPERTIES OF ULTRA NEUTROSOPHIC CRISP SETS\nKnowing that the four components A1,A2,A3, and MA are crisp subsets of the universe X, we can prove that for all the Types (I, II, III, and IV) the ultra neutrosophic crisp sets operations verify the following properties: 1.

The first three components represent a classification of the universe of discourse with respect to some event; while the fourth component deals with the elements which have not been subjected to that classification. While the elements of the first and the third are considered to be well defined, there is a blurry about the behavior of the elements in both second and fourth components. Consequently, four types of set’s operations were established and the properties of the new ultra neutrosophic crisp sets were studied according to different expectations about the performance of the second and the fourth components. Moreover, the definition of the relation between two ultra neutrosophic crisp sets were given. Finally, the concepts of product and composition of ultra neutrosophic crisp sets were introduced.\nReferences\n1. Alblowi, S., Salama, A. A., and Eisa, M. New concepts of neutrosophic sets.

Introduction\nThe idea of \"neutrosophic crisp set\" was first given by Salama and Smarandache [8]. Neutrosophic crisp operations have been investigated by Salama and Alblowi [4, 5], Salama [6], Salama and Smarandache [7, 8], Salama, and Elagamy [9], Salama et al. [10]. Neutrosophy has laid the foundation for a whole family of new mathematical theories, generalizing both their crisp and fuzzy counterparts [13]. Here we shall present the neutrosophic crisp version of these concepts. In this paper, we introduce and study the concept of \"neutrosophic crisp closed set \"and \"neutrosophic crisp continuous function\".\n2.

Introduction Anti-particle in physics means a particle which has one or more opposite properties to its \"original particle kind\". If one property of a particle has the opposite sign to its original state, this particle is anti-particle, and it annihilates with its original particle.\nThe anti-particles can be electrically charged, color or fragrance (for quarks). Meeting each other, a particle and its anti-particle annihilate into gamma-quanta.\nThis formulation may be mistaken with the neutrosophic <antiA>, which is strong opposite to the original particle kind. The <antiA> state is the ultimate case of anti-particles [6].\nIn [7], F. Smarandache discusses the refinement of neutrosophic logic. Hence, <A>, <neutA> and <antiA> can be split into: <A1>, <A2>, ...; <neutA1>, <neutA2>, ...; <antiA1>, <antiA2>, ...; therefore, more types of matter, more types of unmatter, and more types of antimatter.\nOne may refer to <A>, <neutA>, <anti-A> as \"matter\", \"unmatter\" and \"anti-matter\". Following this way, in analogy to anti-matter as the ultimate case of anti-particles in physics, the unmatter can be extended to \"strong unmatter\", where all properties of a substance or a field are unmatter, and to \"regular unmatter\", where just one of the properties of it satisfies the unmatter.\n2. Objective The aim is to check whether the indeterminacy component \uD835\uDC3C can be split to sub-indeterminacies \uD835\uDC3C1, \uD835\uDC3C2, \uD835\uDC3C3, and then justify that the below are all different: \uD835\uDC3C1 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C2 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C3, \uD835\uDC3C1 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C3 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C2, \uD835\uDC3C2 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C3 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C1, \uD835\uDC3C2 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C1 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C3, \uD835\uDC3C3 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C1 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C2, \uD835\uDC3C3 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C2 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C1.

Comment It is obvious that all above six cases are not equal in pairs; suppose:\n\uD835\uDC52 ∪ \uD835\uDC52+ = \uD835\uDC3C1 = \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC66, P ∪ antiP = \uD835\uDC3C2 = \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC66, N ∪ antiN = \uD835\uDC3C3 = \uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC66.\nConsequently, the statement (2) can be rewritten as: \uD835\uDC3C = \uD835\uDC3C1 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C2 ∩ \uD835\uDC3C3\nbut we cannot get the equality for any pairs in eq. (1).\n5. Remark This example is a response to the article [4], where Florentin Smarandache stated that \"for each application we might have some different order relations on the set of neutrosophic truth values; (…) one can get one such order relation workable for all problems\", and also to a commentary in [5], that \"It would be very useful to define suitable order relations on the set of neutrosophic truth values\".\nReferences 1.

Among them, comparative social sciences clusters include: comparative literature, comparative history, comparative philosophy, and so on; comparative natural sciences clusters include: comparative mathematics, comparative physics, comparative chemistry, comparative medicine, comparative biology, and so on. In addition, comparative literature itself can also be expanded. Under the two main categories of research and practice, comparative literature can be expanded into: comparative literature research, comparative literature practice (including comparative essay, comparative fiction, comparative poetry, comparative drama, and so on), comparative literature research and practice, and so on. This paper discusses the applications of comparative method in comparative sciences clusters and their various branches. Point out that in the existing fields of social sciences and natural sciences, many sprouts of comparative sciences clusters can be found, but a wide range of the achievements of comparative sciences clusters, still are the virgin lands to be developed.\nKeywords Comparative, comparative sciences clusters, comparative social sciences clusters, comparative natural sciences clusters, comparative interdisciplinary sciences clusters, comparative literature, comparative history, comparative philosophy, comparative mathematics, comparative physics, comparative chemistry, comparative medicine, comparative biology, comparative essay, comparative fiction, comparative poetry, comparative drama.\n1. Introduction Comparative literature is the literary branch running comparative study (research) about the relationship between two or more kinds of literatures. It consists of influence study, parallel study, interdisciplinary study, and so on.\nAt present, the research method of comparative literature has expanded into other areas, and establish many disciplines such as comparative sociology, comparative jurisprudence, and so on. But the expansion is not enough. In this paper, we try to expand comparative literature into comparative sciences clusters (including comparative social sciences clusters, comparative natural sciences clusters, comparative interdisciplinary sciences clusters, and so on).\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n416\n2. Basic Contents of Neutrosophy and Basic Contents of Quad-stage Neutrosophy is proposed by Prof. Florentin Smarandache in 1995. Neutrosophy is a new branch of philosophy that studies the origin, nature, and scope of neutralities, as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra.\nThis theory considers every notion or idea <A> together with its opposite or negation <AntiA> and the spectrum of \"neutralities\" <Neut-A> (i.e. notions or ideas located between the two extremes, supporting neither <A> nor <Anti-A>). The <Neut-A> and <Anti-A> ideas together are referred to as <Non-A>.\nNeutrosophy is the base of neutrosophic logic, neutrosophic set, neutrosophic probability and statistics used in engineering applications (especially for software and information fusion), medicine, military, cybernetics, and physics.\nNeutrosophic Logic is a general framework for unification of many existing logics, such as fuzzy logic (especially intuitionistic fuzzy logic), paraconsistent logic, intuitionistic logic, etc. The main idea of NL is to characterize each logical statement in a 3D Neutrosophic Space, where each dimension of the space represents respectively the truth (T), the falsehood (F), and the indeterminacy (I) of the statement under consideration, where T, I, F are standard or non-standard real subsets of ]-0, 1+[ without necessarily connection between them.\nMore information about Neutrosophy can be found in references [1，2].\nQuad-stage (Four stages) is presented in reference [3], it is the expansion of Hegel’s triad-stage (triad thesis, antithesis, synthesis of development). The four stages are \"general theses\", \"general antitheses\", \"the most important and the most complicated universal relations\", and \"general syntheses\". They can be stated as follows.\nThe first stage, for the beginning of development (thesis), the thesis should be widely, deeply, carefully and repeatedly contacted, explored, analyzed, perfected and so on; this is the stage of general theses. It should be noted that, here the thesis will be evolved into two or three, even more theses step by step. In addition, if in other stage we find that the first stage’s work is not yet completed, then we may come back to do some additional work for the first stage.\nThe second stage, for the appearance of opposite (antithesis), the antithesis should be also widely, deeply, carefully and repeatedly contacted, explored, analyzed, perfected and so on; this is the stage of general antitheses. It should be also noted that, here the antithesis will be evolved into two or three, even more antitheses step by step.\nThe third stage is the one that the most important and the most complicated universal relations, namely the seedtime inherited from the past and carried on for the future. Its purpose is to establish the universal relations in the widest scope. This widest scope contains all the regions related and non-related to the \"general theses\", \"general antitheses\", and the like. This stage's foundational works are to contact, grasp, discover, dig, and even create the opportunities, pieces of information, and so on as many as possible. The degree of the universal relations may be different, theoretically its upper limit is to connect all the existences, pieces of information and so on related to matters, spirits and so on in the universe; for the cases such as to create science fiction, even may connect all the existences, pieces of information and so on in the virtual world. Obviously, this stage\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n417\nprovides all possibilities to fully use the complete achievements of nature and society, as well as all the humanity's wisdoms in the past, present and future. Therefore this stage is shortened as \"universal relations\" (for other stages, the universal relations are also existed, but their importance and complexity cannot be compared with the ones in this stage).\nThe fourth stage, to carry on the unification and synthesis regarding various opposites and the suitable pieces of information, factors, and so on; and reach one or more results which are the best or agreed with some conditions; this is the stage of \"general syntheses\". The results of this stage are called \"synthesized second generation theses\", all or partial of them may become the beginning of the next quad-stage.\nFor realizing the innovations in the areas such as science and technology, literature and art, and the like, it is a very useful tool to combine neutrosophy with quad-stage method. For example, in reference [4], expanding Newton mechanics with neutrosophy and quad-stage method, and establishing New Newton Mechanics taking law of conservation of energy as unique source law; in reference [5], negating four color theorem with neutrosophy and quad-stage method, and \"the two color theorem\" and \"the five color theorem\" are derived to replace \"the four color theorem\"; in reference [6], expanding Hegelian triad thesis, antithesis, synthesis with Neutrosophy and Quadstage Method; in reference [7], interpretating and expanding Laozi’s governing a large country is like cooking a small fish with Neutrosophy and Quad-stage Method; in reference [8], interpretating and expanding the meaning of “Yi” with Neutrosophy and Quad-stage Method; in reference [9], Creating Generalized and Hybrid Set and Library with Neutrosophy and Quad-stage Method.\nApplying Neutrosophy and Quad-stage Method, will significantly help us to consider all possible situations. Therefore, Neutrosophy and Quad-stage Method can play a very important role to expand comparative literature.\n3. Expanding Comparative Literature with Neutrosophy and Quad-stage Method The process of expanding comparative literature can be divided into four stages. The first stage (stage of \"general theses\"), for the beginning of development, the thesis (namely \"comparative literature\") should be widely, deeply, carefully and repeatedly contacted, explored, analyzed, perfected and so on.\nCurrently, \"comparative literature\" has become a complex subject. Its research achievements absorb the research results of traditional world literature, as well as a variety of other areas even including natural science research; in fact, the inherent discipline bounds have been broken, and beyond the limitations of region and time, put the Asian-African literature, European-American literature, and so on, as well as classical literature, modern literature, and so on, into one or more overall structures or frames.\nFor example, in the research (study) of comparative literature, the literature can be compared with social sciences (philosophy, psychology, linguistics, history, sociology, anthropology, and so on), and the natural sciences (mathematical statistics, computer technology, system theory, information theory, and so on), as well as other artistic disciplines (painting, sculpture, architecture, music, film, and so on).\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n418\nOf course, we should also see that different scholars may have different viewpoints and interpretations for \"comparative literature\" and the related problems, and the different opinions and arguments will be endless from generation to generation.\nIn the second stage (the stage of \"general antitheses\"), the opposites (antitheses) should be discussed carefully. Obviously, there are more than one opposites (antitheses) of comparative literature here.\nFor example, according to the viewpoint of Neutrosophy, if \"comparative literature\" is considered as the concept <A>, the opposite <Anti-A> may be: \"non-comparative literature\" (such as comparative sociology, comparative jurisprudence, and so on); while the neutral (middle state) fields <Neut-A> including: \"undetermined comparative literature\" (neither \"comparative literature\", nor \"non-comparative literature\"; or, sometimes it is \"comparative literature\", and sometimes it is \"non-comparative literature; and so on\".\nIn the third stage, considering the most important and the most complicated universal relations to link with \"comparative literature\". The purpose of this provision stage is to establish the universal relations in the widest scope.\nFor \"comparative literature\", different people will have different research methods and findings; even if for the same person, at different times and in different situations, he or she may also apply different research methods and reach different research results. Therefore, pursuing the unique right research method and research result do not seem to make sense. So the advisable method of work is to collect all people’s research methods and research results from ancient times to modern times, and plus own research methods and research results, to form the so-called \"full research methods and research results\", and to store up them as Think Tank; while once we need to apply them, then immediately the one or several best research methods and research results can be elected, or according to the information in Think Tank and the reality to obtain one or several best programmes temporarily, thus we can be invincible.\nNow we list some specific research methods and results. The first school of comparative literature in the world is France school. Characterized by respecting the facts, and emphasizing the textual studies; and the research achievements occupy a glorious page in the history of world literature.\nLater, United States school is appeared and takig \"parallel study\" as the symbol, the scholars of this school consider that literature as a discipline should compare with other disciplines.\nAt present, in United Kingdom, Russia, China and other countries, comparative literature studies have achieved fruitful results.\nIn the fourth stage, the comprehensive results of the front three stages can be used to expand \"comparative literature\" with a variety of ways and means. Here we mainly according to Neutrosophy and Quad-stage method to seek expanded results.\nAccording to Neutrosophy and Quad-stage method, if the social sciences can be considered as <A>, then the natural sciences can be considered as the opposite <Anti-A>, and the interdisciplinary sciences can be considered as <Neut-A> (neutral A).\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n419\nFirstly, link to social sciences, \"comparative literature\" should be expanded into \"comparative social sciences\", or \"comparative social sciences clusters\" including comparative literature, comparative history, comparative philosophy, and so on.\nSecondly, link to natural sciences, \"comparative literature\" should be expanded into \"comparative natural sciences\", or \"comparative natural sciences clusters\" including comparative mathematics, comparative physics, chemistry, comparative medicine, comparative biology, and so on.\nThirdly, link to interdisciplinary sciences, \"comparative literature\" should be expanded into \"comparative interdisciplinary sciences\", or \"comparative interdisciplinary sciences clusters\" including comparative mathematical medicine, comparative mathematical biology, and so on.\nIn addition, the \"comparative literature\" itself can also be expanded. In addition, comparative literature itself can also be expanded. In references [10], under the two main categories of research and practice, comparative literature can be expanded into: comparative literature research, comparative literature practice (Including comparative essay, comparative fiction, comparative poetry, comparative drama, and so on), comparative literature research and practice, and so on. For the sake of convenience of classification, and to distinguish with other forms of work, naming the essay created by comparative method as comparative essay, the fiction created by comparative method as comparative fiction, the poetry created by comparative method as comparative poetry, the drama created by comparative method as comparative drama, and so on.\n4. Applications of comparative method in comparative sciences clusters and their\nbranches \"Comparison\" means: according to the certain standards and methodologies, to identify advantages and disadvantages, same and different, beauty and ugliness, and so on between two or more things.\nThe principle of comparison: there shall be the object to be compared with, as well as the common comparative foundation, and the certain standards and methods, and so on; as comparing, we should try to consider all possible situations.\nBased on the above concepts and principles, comparative method can be widely used in comparative sciences clusters and their various branches, and provide a variety of ways and broad space for development.\nFirstly we discuss the comparative objects. In comparative sciences clusters and their various branches, the comparative objects can be selected within the large range, the medium range, and the small range.\nSecondly we discuss the comparative standards. The comparative standards can be selected as: advantages and disadvantages, same and different, beauty and ugliness, and so on. As taking advantages and disadvantages as the comparative standard, the comparative result can be decided by experts, by ordinary scholars and readers, and by all the people (including experts, ordinary scholars and readers).\nAs for the methods and ways for comparison, they are also numerous. For example, to compare according to the time sequence, according to the different spatial locations; or according to the\nFlorentin Smarandache, Surapati Pramanik (Editors)\n420\nlongitudinal direction and transverse direction; as well as qualitative comparison, quantitative comparison, macro-comparison, micro-comparison; and the combination of different methods and ways.\nIt needs to be emphasized that, when comparing, we should try to consider all possible situations. This is also the great feature of comparative sciences clusters and their various branches.\nAs for how to consider all possible situations, we will discuss this problem in another paper. It should be noted that, in the existing fields of social sciences and natural sciences, many sprouts of comparative sciences clusters can be found, but a wide range of the achievements of comparative sciences clusters, still are the virgin lands to be developed.\n5. Conclusions Applying Neutrosophy and Quad-stage Method, as well as comparative methods and ways in comparative sciences clusters and their various branches, will play an extremely important role to promote the development of social sciences, natural sciences, interdisciplinary sciences, and so on; and continue to make new achievements.\nReferences 1.

E-mail: fuyh1945@sina.com\nNew Trends in Neutrosophic Theory and Applications\n425\nNeutrosophic theory and applications have been expanding in\nall directions at an astonishing rate especially after the\nintroduction the journal entitled “Neutrosophic Sets and\nSystems”. New theories, techniques, algorithms have been\nrapidly developed. One of the most striking trends in the\nneutrosophic theory is the hybridization of neutrosophic set with\nother potential sets such as rough set, bipolar set, soft set,\nhesitant fuzzy set, etc. The different hybrid structure such as\nrough neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic rough set,\nbipolar neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic hesitant\nfuzzy set, etc. are proposed in the literature in a short period of\ntime. Neutrosophic set has been a very important tool in all\nvarious areas of data mining, decision making, e-learning,\nengineering, medicine, social science, and some more.\nThe Book “New Trends in Neutrosophic Theories and\nApplications” focuses on theories, methods, algorithms for\ndecision making and also applications involving neutrosophic\ninformation. Some topics deal with data mining, decision\nmaking, e-learning, graph theory, medical diagnosis, probability\ntheory, topology, and some more."

    "abstractText" : "This paper presents a data mining process of single valued neutrosophic information. This approach gives a presentation of data analysis common to all applications. Data mining depends on two main elements, namely the concept of similarity and the machine learning framework. It describes a lot of real world applications for the domains namely mathematical, medical, educational, chemical, multimedia etc. There are two main types of indeterminacy in supervised learning: cognitive and statistical. Statistical indeterminacy deals with the random behavior of nature. All existing data mining techniques can handle the uncertainty that arises (or is assumed to arise) in the natural world from statistical variations or randomness. Cognitive uncertainty deals with human cognition. In real world problems for data mining, indeterminacy components may arise. Neutrosophic logic can handle this situation. In this paper, we have shown the role of single valued neutrosophic set logic in data mining. We also propose a data mining approach in single valued neutrosophic environment.",
