      "text" : "Ensembles of models have long been used as a way to obtain robust performance in the presence of noise. Ensembles typically work by training several classifiers on perturbed input distributions, e.g. bagging randomly elides parts of the distribution for each trained model and boosting re-weights the distribution before training and adding each model to the ensemble. In the last few years, dropout methods have achieved great empirical success in training deep models, by leveraging a noise process that perturbs the model structure itself. However, there has not yet been much analysis relating this approach to classic ensemble methods or other approaches to learning robust models.\nIn this paper, we formalize the notion of a pseudo-ensemble, which is a collection of child models spawned from a parent model by perturbing it with some noise process. Sec. 2 defines pseudoensembles, after which Sec. 3 discusses the relationships between pseudo-ensembles and standard ensemble methods, as well as existing notions of robustness. Once the pseudo-ensemble framework is defined, it can be leveraged to create new algorithms. In Sec. 4, we develop a novel regularizer that minimizes variation in the output of a model when it is subject to noise on its inputs and its internal state (or structure). We also discuss the relationship of this regularizer to standard dropout methods. In Sec. 5 we show that our regularizer can reproduce the performance of dropout in a fullysupervised setting, while also naturally extending to the semi-supervised setting, where it produces state-of-the-art performance on some real-world datasets. Sec. 6 presents a case study in which we extend the Recursive Neural Tensor Network from [19] by converting it into a pseudo-ensemble. We\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n48 64\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 1\ngenerate the pseudo-ensemble using a noise process based on Gaussian parameter fuzzing and latent subspace sampling, and empirically show that both types of perturbation contribute to significant performance improvements beyond that of the original model. We conclude in Sec. 7."

      "text" : "Consider a data distribution pxy which we want to approximate using a parametric parent model fθ. A pseudo-ensemble is a collection of ξ-perturbed child models fθ(x; ξ), where ξ comes from a noise process pξ. Dropout [9] provides the clearest existing example of a pseudo-ensemble. Dropout samples subnetworks from a source network by randomly masking the activity of subsets of its input/hidden layer nodes. The parameters shared by the subnetworks, through their common source network, are learned to minimize the expected loss of the individual subnetworks. In pseudoensemble terms, the source network is the parent model, each sampled subnetwork is a child model, and the noise process consists of sampling a node mask and using it to extract a subnetwork.\nThe noise process used to generate a pseudo-ensemble can take fairly arbitrary forms. The only requirement is that sampling a noise realization ξ, and then imposing it on the parent model fθ, be computationally tractable. This generality allows deriving a variety of pseudo-ensemble methods from existing models. For example, for a Gaussian Mixture Model, one could perturb the means of the mixture components with, e.g., Gaussian noise and their covariances with, e.g., Wishart noise.\nThe goal of learning with pseudo-ensembles is to produce models robust to perturbation. To formalize this, the general pseudo-ensemble objective for supervised learning can be written as follows1:\nminimize θ E (x,y)∼pxy E ξ∼pξ L(fθ(x; ξ), y), (1)\nwhere (x, y) ∼ pxy is an (observation, label) pair drawn from the data distribution, ξ ∼ pξ is a noise realization, fθ(x; ξ) represents the output of a child model spawned from the parent model fθ via ξ-perturbation, y is the true label for x, and L(ŷ, y) is the loss for predicting ŷ instead of y. The generality of the pseudo-ensemble approach comes from broad freedom in describing the noise process pξ and the mechanism by which ξ perturbs the parent model fθ. Many useful methods could be developed by exploring novel noise processes for generating perturbations beyond the independent masking noise that has been considered for neural networks and the feature noise that has been considered in the context of linear models. For example, [17] develops a method for learning “ordered representations” by applying dropout/masking noise in a deep autoencoder while enforcing a particular “nested” structure among the random masking variables in ξ, and [2] relies heavily on random perturbations when training Generative Stochastic Networks."

      "text" : "Pseudo-ensembles are closely related to traditional ensemble methods as well as to methods for learning models robust to input uncertainty. By optimizing the expected loss of individual ensemble members’ outputs, rather than the expected loss of the joint ensemble output, pseudo-ensembles differ from boosting, which iteratively augments an ensemble to minimize the loss of the joint output [8]. Meanwhile, the child models in a pseudo-ensemble share parameters and structure through their parent model, which will tend to correlate their behavior. This distinguishes pseudo-ensembles from traditional “independent member” ensemble methods, like bagging and random forests, which typically prefer diversity in the behavior of their members, as this provides bias and variance reduction when the outputs of their members are averaged [8]. In fact, the regularizers we introduce in Sec. 4 explicitly minimize diversity in the behavior of their pseudo-ensemble members.\nThe definition and use of pseudo-ensembles are strongly motivated by the intuition that models trained to be robust to noise should generalize better than models that are (overly) sensitive to small perturbations. Previous work on robust learning has overwhelmingly concentrated on perturbations affecting the inputs to a model. For example, the optimization community has produced a large body of theoretical and empirical work addressing “stochastic programming” [18] and “robust optimization” [4]. Stochastic programming seeks to produce a solution to a, e.g., linear program that performs\n1It is easy to formulate analogous objectives for unsupervised learning, maximum likelihood, etc.\nwell on average, with respect to a known distribution over perturbations of parameters in the problem definition2. Robust optimization generally seeks to produce a solution to a, e.g., linear program with optimal worst case performance over a given set of possible perturbations of parameters in the problem definition. Several well-known machine learning methods have been shown equivalent to certain robust optimization problems. For example, [24] shows that using Lasso (i.e. `1 regularization) in a linear regression model is equivalent to a robust optimization problem. [25] shows that learning a standard SVM (i.e. hinge loss with `2 regularization in the corresponding RKHS) is also equivalent to a robust optimization problem. Supporting the notion that noise-robustness improves generalization, [25] prove many of the statistical guarantees that make SVMs so appealing directly from properties of their robust optimization equivalents, rather than using more complicated proofs involving, e.g., VC-dimension.\nLayer i-1 Layer i Layer i+1\n(1) (2) (3) (4)\ninput-space noise, as a model can always be extended with an initial “identity layer” that copies the noise-free input. Noise on the input-space can then be reproduced by noise on the initial layer, which is now part of the model-space."

      "heading" : "4 The Pseudo-Ensemble Agreement regularizer",
      "text" : "We now present Pseudo-Ensemble Agreement (PEA) regularization, which can be used in a fairly general class of computation graphs. For concreteness, we present it in the case of deep, layered neural networks. PEA regularization operates by controlling distributional properties of the random vectors {f2θ (x; ξ), ..., fdθ (x; ξ)}, where f iθ(x; ξ) gives the activities of the ith layer of fθ in response to x when layers < i are perturbed by ξ while layer i is left unperturbed. Fig. 1 illustrates the construction of these random vectors. We will assume that layer d is the output layer, i.e.fdθ (x) gives the output of the unperturbed parent model in response to x and fdθ (x; ξ) = fθ(x; ξ) gives the response of the child model generated by ξ-perturbing fθ.\nGiven the random vectors f iθ(x; ξ), PEA regularization is defined as follows:\nR(fθ, px, pξ) = E x∼px E ξ∼pξ [ d∑ i=2 λiVi(f iθ(x), f iθ(x; ξ)) ] , (2)\nwhere fθ is the parent model to regularize, x ∼ px is an unlabeled observation, Vi(·, ·) is the “variance” penalty imposed on the distribution of activities in the ith layer of the pseudo-ensemble spawned from fθ, and λi controls the relative importance of Vi. Note that for Eq. 2 to act on the “variance” of the f iθ(x; ξ), we should have f i θ(x) ≈ Eξ f iθ(x; ξ). This approximation holds reasonably well for many useful neural network architectures [1, 22]. In our experiments we actually compute the penalties Vi between independently-sampled pairs of child models. We consider several different measures of variance to penalize, which we will introduce as needed.\n2Note that “parameters” in a linear program are analogous to inputs in standard machine learning terminology, as they are observed quantities (rather than quantities optimized over)."

      "heading" : "4.1 The effect of PEA regularization on feature co-adaptation",
      "text" : "One of the original motivations for dropout was that it helps prevent “feature co-adaptation” [9]. That is, dropout encourages individual features (i.e. hidden node activities) to remain helpful, or at least not become harmful, when other features are removed from their local context. We provide some support for that claim by examining the following optimization objective 3:\nminimize θ E (x,y)∼pxy [L(fθ(x), y)] + E x∼px E ξ∼pξ [ d∑ i=2 λiVi(f iθ(x), f iθ(x; ξ)) ] , (3)\nin which the supervised loss L depends only on the parent model fθ and the pseudo-ensemble only appears in the PEA regularization term. For simplicity, let λi = 0 for i < d, λd = 1, and Vd(v1, v2) = DKL(softmax(v1)|| softmax(v2)), where softmax is the standard softmax and DKL(p1||p2) is the KL-divergence between p1 and p2 (we indicate this penalty by Vk). We use xent(softmax(fθ(x)), y) for the loss L(fθ(x), y), where xent(ŷ, y) is the cross-entropy between the predicted distribution ŷ and the true distribution y. Eq. 3 never explicitly passes label information through a ξ-perturbed network, so ξ only acts through its effects on the distribution of the parent model’s predictions when subjected to ξ-perturbation. In this case, (3) trades off accuracy against feature co-adaptation, as measured by the degree to which the feature activity distribution at layer i is affected by perturbation of the feature activity distributions for layers < i.\nWe test this regularizer empirically in Sec. 5.1. The observed ability of this regularizer to reproduce the performance benefits of standard dropout supports the notion that discouraging “co-adaptation” plays an important role in dropout’s empirical success. Also, by acting strictly to make the output of the parent model more robust to ξ-perturbation, the performance of this regularizer rebuts the claim in [22] that noise-robustness plays only a minor role in the success of standard dropout."

      "heading" : "4.3 PEA regularization for semi-supervised learning",
      "text" : "PEA regularization works as-is in a semi-supervised setting, as the penalties Vi do not require label information. We train networks for semi-supervised learning in two ways, both of which apply the objective in Eq. 1 on labeled examples and PEA regularization on the unlabeled examples. The first way applies a tanh-variance penalty Vt and the second way applies a xent-variance penalty Vx, which we define as follows:\nVt(ȳ, ỹ) = || tanh(ȳ)− tanh(ỹ)||22, Vx(ȳ, ỹ) = xent(softmax(ȳ), softmax(ỹ)), (11)\nwhere ȳ and ỹ represent the outputs of a pair of independently sampled child models, and tanh operates element-wise. The xent-variance penalty can be further expanded as:\nVx(ȳ, ỹ) = DKL(softmax(ȳ)|| softmax(ỹ)) + ent(softmax(ȳ)), (12)\nwhere ent(·) denotes the entropy. Thus, Vx combines the KL-divergence penalty with an entropy penalty, which has been shown to perform well in a semi-supervised setting [7, 14]. Recall that at non-output layers we regularize with the “direction” penalty Vc. Before the masking noise, we also apply zero-mean Gaussian noise to the input and to the biases of all nodes. In the experiments, we chose between the two output-layer penalties Vt/Vx based on observed performance."

For the supervised tests we used SGD hyperparameters roughly following those in [9]. We trained networks with two hidden layers of 800 nodes each, using rectified-linear activations and an `2-norm constraint of 3.5 on incoming weights for each node. For both standard dropout (SDE) and PEA, we used softmax → xent loss at the output layer. We initialized hidden layer biases to 0.1, output layer biases to 0, and inter-layer weights to zero-mean Gaussian noise with σ = 0.01. We trained all networks for 1000 epochs with no early-stopping (i.e. performance was measured for the final network state).\nSDE obtained 1.05% error averaged over five random initializations. Using PEA penalty Vk at the output layer and computing classification loss/gradient only for the unperturbed parent network, we obtained 1.08% averaged error. The ξ-perturbation involved node masking but not bias noise. Thus, training the same network as used for dropout while ignoring the effects of masking noise on the classification loss, but encouraging the network to be robust to masking noise (as measured by Vk), matched the performance of dropout. This result supports the equivalence between dropout and this particular form of PEA regularization, which we derived in Section 4.2."

Aside from CNN, all methods in the table are “general”, i.e. do not use convolutions or other image-specific techniques to improve performance. The main comparisons of interest are between PEA(+) and other methods for semi-supervised learning with neural networks, i.e. E-NN, MTC+, and PL+. E-NN (EmbedNN from [23]) uses a nearest-neighbors-based graph Laplacian regularizer to make predictions “smooth” with respect to the manifold underlying the data distribution px. MTC+ (the Manifold Tangent Classifier from [16]) regularizes predictions to be smooth with respect to the data manifold by penalizing gradients in a learned approximation of the tangent space of the data manifold. PL+ (the PseudoLabel method from [14]) uses the joint-ensemble predictions on unlabeled data as “pseudo-labels”, and treats them like “true” labels. The classification losses on true labels and pseudo-labels are balanced by a scaling factor which is carefully modulated over the course of training. PEA regularization (without pre-training) outperforms all previous methods in every setting except 100 labeled samples, where PL+ performs better, but with the benefit of pre-training. By adding pretraining (i.e. PEA+), we achieve a two-fold reduction in error when using only 100 labeled samples."

      "text" : "The organizers of the NIPS 2011 Workshop on Challenges in Learning Hierarchical Models [13] proposed a challenge to improve performance on a target domain by using labeled and unlabeled\ndata from two related source domains. The labeled data source was CIFAR-100 [11], which contains 50k 32x32 color images in 100 classes. The unlabeled data source was a collection of 100k 32x32 color images taken from Tiny Images [11]. The target domain comprised 120 32x32 color images divided unevenly among 10 classes. Neither the classes nor the images in the target domain appeared in either of the source domains. The winner of this challenge used convolutional Spike and Slab Sparse Coding, followed by max pooling and a linear SVM on the pooled features [6]. Labels on the source data were ignored and the source data was used to pre-train a large set of convolutional features. After applying the pre-trained feature extractor to the 120 training images, this method achieved an accuracy of 48.6% on the target domain, the best published result on this dataset.\nWe applied semi-supervised PEA regularization by first using the CIFAR-100 data to train a deep network comprising three max-pooled convolutional layers followed by a fully-connected hidden layer which fed into a softmax → xent output layer. Afterwards, we removed the hidden and output layers, replaced them with a pair of fully-connected hidden layers feeding into an `2-hinge-loss output layer5, and then trained the non-convolutional part of the network on the 120 training images from the target domain. For this final training phase, which involved three layers, we tried standard dropout and dropout with PEA regularization on the source data. Standard dropout achieved 55.5% accuracy, which improved to 57.4% when we added PEA regularization on the source data. While most of the improvement over the previous state-of-the-art (i.e. 48.6%) was due to dropout and an improved training strategy (i.e. supervised pre-training vs. unsupervised pre-training), controlling the feature activity and output distributions of the pseudo-ensemble on unlabeled data allowed significant further improvement."

The STB task involves predicting the sentiment of short phrases extracted from movie reviews on RottenTomatoes.com. Ground-truth labels for the phrases, and the “sub-phrases” produced by processing them with a standard parser, were generated using Amazon Mechanical Turk. In addition to pseudoensembles, we used a more “compact” bilinear form in the function f : Rn × Rn → Rn that the RNTN applies recursively as shown in Figure 3. The computation for the ith dimension of the original f (for vi ∈ Rn×1) is:\nfi(v1, v2) = tanh([v1; v2] >Ti[v1; v2] +Mi[v1; v2; 1]), whereas we use:\nfi(v1, v2) = tanh(v > 1 Tiv2 +Mi[v1; v2; 1]),\nin which Ti indicates a matrix slice of tensor T and Mi indicates a vector row of matrix M . In the original RNTN, T is 2n× 2n× n and in ours it is n× n× n. The other parameters in the RNTNs are a transform matrix M ∈ Rn×2n+1 and a classification matrix C ∈ Rc×n+1; each RNTN outputs c class probabilities for vector v using softmax(C[v; 1]). A “;” indicates vertical vector stacking.\nWe initialized the model with pre-trained word vectors. The pre-training used word2vec on the training and dev set, with three modifications: dropout/fuzzing was applied during pre-training (to match the conditions in the full model), the vector norms were constrained so the pre-trained vectors had standard deviation 0.5, and tanh was applied during word2vec (again, to match conditions in the full model). All code required for these experiments is publicly available online.\nWe generated pseudo-ensembles from a parent RNTN using two types of perturbation: subspace sampling and weight fuzzing. We performed subspace sampling by keeping only n2 randomly sampled latent dimensions out of the n in the parent model when processing a given phrase tree. Using the same sampled dimensions for a full phrase tree reduced computation time significantly, as the parameter matrices/tensor could be “sliced” to include only the relevant dimensions6. During\n5We found that `2-hinge-loss performed better than softmax → xent in this setting. Switching to softmax → xent degrades the dropout and PEA results but does not change their ranking.\n6This allowed us to train significantly larger models before over-fitting offset increased model capacity. But, training these larger models would have been tedious without the parameter slicing permitted by subspace sampling, as feedforward for the RNTN is O(n3).\ntraining we sampled a new subspace each time a phrase tree was processed and computed testtime outputs for each phrase tree by averaging over 50 randomly sampled subspaces. We performed weight fuzzing during training by perturbing parameters with zero-mean Gaussian noise before processing each phrase tree and then applying gradients w.r.t. the perturbed parameters to the unperturbed parameters. We did not fuzz during testing. Weight fuzzing has an interesting interpretation as an implicit convolution of the objective function (defined w.r.t. the model parameters) with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. In the case of recursive/recurrent neural networks this may prove quite useful, as convolving the objective with a Gaussian reduces its curvature, thereby mitigating some problems stemming from ill-conditioned Hessians [15].

E.g., dropout [9] in a deep neural network trains a pseudo-ensemble of child subnetworks generated by randomly masking nodes in the parent network. We examine the relationship of pseudo-ensembles, which involve perturbation in model-space, to standard ensemble methods and existing notions of robustness, which focus on perturbation in observation-space. We present a novel regularizer based on making the behavior of a pseudo-ensemble robust with respect to the noise process generating it. In the fully-supervised setting, our regularizer matches the performance of dropout. But, unlike dropout, our regularizer naturally extends to the semi-supervised setting, where it produces state-of-the-art results. We provide a case study in which we transform the Recursive Neural Tensor Network of [19] into a pseudo-ensemble, which significantly improves its performance on a real-world sentiment analysis benchmark.",
