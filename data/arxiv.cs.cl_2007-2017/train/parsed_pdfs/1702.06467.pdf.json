      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Social networks are a resource that millions of people use to support their relationships with friends and family (Chang et al., 2015). In June 2016, Facebook1 reported to have approximately 1.13 billion active users per day; while in June, Twitter2 reported an average of 313 million active users per month.\nDue to the large amount of information that is continuously produced in social networks, to identify certain individual characteristics of users has been a problem of growing importance for different areas like forensics, security and marketing (Rangel et al., 2015); problem that Author profiling aims from an automatic classification approach with the premise that depending of the individual characteristics of each person; such as age, gender or personality, the way of communicating will be different.\nAuthor profiling is traditionally applied in texts like literature, documentaries or essays (Argamon et al., 2003; Argamon et al., 2009); these kind of texts have a relative long length (Peersman et al., 2011) and a standard language. By the other hand, documents produced by social networks users have some characteristics that differ from regular texts and prevents that\n1Facebook website: http://www.facebook.com 2Twitter website: http://www.twitter.com\nthey can be analyzed in a similar way (Peersman et al., 2011). Some characteristics that social networks texts share are their length (significantly shorter that traditional texts) (Peersman et al., 2011), the large number of misspellings, the use of non-standard capitalization and punctuation.\nSocial networks like Twitter have their own rules and features that users use to express themselves and communicate with each other. It is possible to take advantage of these rules and extract a greater amount of stylistic information. (Gimpel et al., 2011) introduce this idea to create a Part of Speech (POS) tagger for Twitter. In our case, we chose to perform a dynamic context-dependent normalization. This normalization allows to group those elements that are capable of providing stylistic information regardless of its lexical variability; this phase helps to improve the performance of the classification process. In (GonzálezGallardo et al., 2016) we presented some preliminary results of this work, that we will extend with more experiments and further description.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we provide an overview of Author profiling applied to age, gender and personality traits prediction. In section 3, a brief presentation of character and POS ngrams is presented. In section 4 we detail the methodology used in the dynamic context-dependent normal-\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n06 46\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 2\n1 Fe\nb 20\nization.

Finally, in section 8 we present the conclusions and some future job prospects."

      "text" : "(Koppel et al., 2002) performed a research with a corpus made of 566 documents of the British National Corpus (BNC)3 in which they identified automatically the gender of the author using function words and POS n-grams, obtaining a precision of 80% with a linear separator.\n(Doyle and Kešelj, 2005) constructed a simple classifier to predict gender in a collection of 495 essays of the BAWE corpus4. The classifier consisted in measuring the distance between the text to classify and two different profiles (man and woman), being the smallest one the class that was assign to the text. A precision of 81% was reported using character, word and POS n-grams as features.\nIn (Peersman et al., 2011), the authors collected 1.5 millions of samples of the Netlog social network to predict the age and gender of the authors. They used a model created with support vector machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1998) taking into account n-grams of words and characters as features. The reported precision was of 64.2%.\n(Carmona et al., 2015) predicted age, gender and personality traits of tweets authors using a high lever representation of features. This representation is composed of discriminatory features (Second Order Atribbutes) (Lopez-Monroy et al., 2013) and descriptive features (Latent Semantic Analysis) (WiemerHastings et al., 2004). For age and gender prediction in Spanish tweets they obtained a precision of 77.27% and for personality traits a RMSE value of 0.1297.\nIn (Grivas et al., 2015), a classification model with SVM was used to predict age, gender and personality traits of Spanish tweets while a SVR model was used to predict personality traits of tweets authors. In this approach two types of feature groups where considered: structural and stylometric. Structural features were extracted form the unprocessed tweets while stylometric features were obtained after html tags, urls, hashtags and references to other users are removed.\n3BNC website http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/ 4BAWE corpus website: http://www2.warwick.ac.\nuk/fac/soc/al/research/collect/bawe/\nA precision of 72.73% was reported for age and gender prediction, while a RMSE value of 0.1495 was obtained for personality traits prediction."

      "text" : "N-GRAMS\nn-grams are sequences of elements of a selected textual information unit (Manning and Schütze, 1999) that allow the extraction of content and stylistic features from text; features that can be used in tasks such as Automatic Summarization, Automatic Translation and Text Classification.\nThe information unit to use changes depending on the task and the type of features that will be extracted. For example, in Automatic Translation and Summarization is common to use word and phrase ngrams (Torres-Moreno, 2014; Giannakopoulos et al., 2008; Koehn, 2010). Within Text Classification, for Plagiarism Detection, Author Identification and Author Profiling; character, word and POS n-grams are used (Doyle and Kešelj, 2005; Stamatatos et al., 2015; Oberreuter and Velásquez, 2013).\nThe information units selected in this research are characters and POS tags. With the character n-grams the goal is to extract as many stylistic elements as possible: characters frequency, use of suffixes (gender, number, tense, diminutives, superlatives, etc.), use of punctuation, use of emoticons, etc (Stamatatos, 2006; Stamatatos, 2009).\nPOS n-grams provide information about the structure of the text: frequency of grammatical elements, diversity of grammatical structures and the interaction between grammatical elements. The POS tags were obtained using the Freeling5 POS tagger, which follows the POS tags proposed by EAGLES6. To fully control the standardization process and make it independent of a detector of names, we preferred to perform a specific normalization for both datasets instead of using the Freeling functionalities (Padró and Stanilovsky, 2012).\nThe POS tags provided by Freeling have several levels of detail that provide insight into the different attributes of a grammatical category depending of the language that is being analyzed. In our case we used only the first level of detail that refers to the category itself. The example in Table 1 shows the Spanish word ”especialización” (specialization), all its at-\n5Freeling website: http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/ freeling/node/1\n6EAGLES website: http://www.ilc.cnr.it/ EAGLES96/annotate/node9.html\ntributes and the selected tag."

      "heading" : "4 DYNAMIC CONTEXT-DEPENDENT NORMALIZATION",
      "text" : "The freedom that social networks users have to encode their messages derives in a varied lexicon. To minimize this variations it is necessary to normalize those elements that are able to provide stylistic information regardless of its lexical variability (references to other users, hyperlinks, hashtags, emoticons, etc). This is what we call Dynamic Contextdependent Normalization which is separated in two phases: Text normalization and POS relabeling. • Text normalization\nThe goal of this phase is to avoid the lexical variability that is present when a user tends to do certain actions in their texts; for example tagging another user or creating a link to a website. In the Twitter case, references to other users are defined as\n@{username}\nThe amount of values that can be assigned to the label username is potentially infinite (depending on the number of users available to the social network). To avoid such variability, the Dynamic Context-dependent Normalization standardize this element in order to highlight the intention: make a reference to a user. So, the tweet\nI was just watching ‘‘update 10.’’ @MKBHD http://t.co/P9Dn7t8zSl\nwill be normalized to I was just watching ‘‘update 10.’’ @us http://t.co/P9Dn7t8zSl\nHyperlinks have a similar behavior: the number of links to Internet sites is also potentially infinite. The important fact is that a reference to an external site is being implemented; so all text strings that match the pattern:\nhttp[s]://{external_site}\nare normalized. Following with the previous example, the tweet\nI was just watching ‘‘update 10.’’ @us http://t.co/P9Dn7t8zSl\nwill be normalized to\nI was just watching ‘‘update 10.’’ @us htt\n• POS relabeling All these lexical variations provide important grammatical information that must be preserved, but conventional POS taggers are unable to maintain. Therefore, it is necessary to relabel certain elements to keep their interaction with the rest of the POS tags of the text. Using Freeling to tag the previous example and taking into account only the categories of the POS tag, the sequence obtained is\nP V R V N Z F N N\nAs it can be seen, the reference to the user and the link to the site is lost and it is no possible to know how those elements interact with the rest of the tags. To overcome this limitation, references to other users, hyperlinks and hashtags are relabeled so that they have their own special tag dealing to the next sequence:\nP V R V N Z REF@USERNAME REF#LINK\nFigure 1 shows a general architecture of the system."

The training phase was done with 70% of the samples from the PAN -CLEF2015 corpus (Spanish). Remember that a sample of this corpus is a group of about 100 tweets.\nTable 11 shows the results of the 5 979 samples that were tested.\nIn the second experiment (E2) we chose to generate samples of 50 comments, size that represent a reasonable compromise between number of samples and number of characters per sample (about 5K characters).\nA total of 121 samples were tested with the learning model of E1. The results are slightly better that E1 but the domain difference seems to affect greatly the system performance (Table 12).\nA third experiment (E3) was done with this corpus; eleven micro experiments with different number of comments per sample were performed: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 41, 50, 57, 64. This was done to measure the impact of the sample size variation in the performance of the algorithm.\nFigures 3 to 6 show the performance of E3 (accuracy, precision, recall and F-score). As it can be seen, something curious happens when the sample is of 50 comments length. At that point the general performance drops about 8%. This is due to an statistical effect that the data shows with the residual sample. For both male and female, a residual sample of 22 comments is present. It is necessary to mention that this effect does not affect the general results of E3, which shows to be consistent with the rest of the experiments."

      "heading" : "8 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK",
      "text" : "Character and POS n-grams have shown to be a useful resource for the extraction of stylistic features in short texts. With character n-grams it was possible to\nextract emoticons, punctuation exaggeration (character flooding), use of capital letters and different kinds of emotional information encoded in tweets and comments. The interaction between the special elements of the social networks, like references to users, hashtags or links, and the rest of the POS tags were captured with the POS n-grams after. Also, for Spanish and English it was possible to capture the most representative series of two and three grammatical elements; for the Italian and Dutch we were able to capture the most common grammatical elements. The Dynamic Context-dependent Normalization showed to be effective in the different domains (Facebook and Twitter), but also showed to have problems when a cross domain evaluation was performed. The poor results obtained in E1 reflect that it is important to keep the ratio size between train and test samples. E2 results show that the change of domain greatly affects the prediction capacity of the system; fact that E3 and the results obtained with the PAN-CLEF2016 s corpus reinforce. A proposal for future work is to repeat E3 applying cross validation. This will show a better\ndistribution of the training and test samples eliminating the possibility of a biased result. Also, this probably balance the 50 comments samples and improves its performance. An interesting development for future work would be to apply the algorithm presented in this article to comments of multimedia sources to separate in an automatic way the different sectors of opinion makers."
