      "text" : "Here, for the first time, we directly compare both approaches on a large-scale, real-world learning task. We additionally contrast to rule-based program synthesis, which uses hand-crafted semantics to guide the program generation. Our neural models use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of variable-sized sets of I/O pairs. Our best synthesis model achieves 92% accuracy on a real-world test set, compared to the 34% accuracy of the previous best neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms a comparable induction model on this task, but we more importantly demonstrate that the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric and end-user application. Finally, we show that we can train our neural models to remain very robust to the type of noise expected in real-world data (e.g., typos), while a highlyengineered rule-based system fails entirely."

The goal of the task is to fill in the blank (i.e., ‘?’ = ‘Green, Steve’). Synthesis approaches achieve this by generating a program like the one shown. Induction approaches generate the new output string directly, conditioned on the the other examples.\nWaldinger & Lee (1969); Manna & Waldinger (1975). The classical approach has been that of rule-based program synthesis (Manna & Waldinger, 1980), where a formal grammar is used to derive a program from a well-defined specification. Providing a formal specification is often more difficult than writing the program itself, so modern program synthesis methods generally rely on input/output examples (I/O examples) to act as an approximate specification. Modern rule-based synthesis methods are typically centered around hand-crafted function semantics and pruning rules to search for programs consistent with the I/O examples (Gulwani et al., 2012; Alur et al., 2013).\nThese hand-engineered systems are often difficult to extend and fragile to noise, so statistical program learning methods have recently gained popularity, with a particular focus on neural network models. This work has fallen into two overarching categories: (1) neural program synthesis, where the program is generated by a neural network conditioned on the I/O examples (Balog et al., 2016; Parisotto et al., 2017; Gaunt et al., 2016; Riedel et al., 2016), and (2) neural program induction, where network learns to generate the output directly using a latent program representation (Graves et al., 2014; 2016; Kurach et al., 2016; Kaiser & Sutskever, 2015; Joulin & Mikolov, 2015; Reed & de Freitas, 2016; Neelakantan et al., 2016). Although many of these papers have achieved impressive results on a variety of tasks, none have thoroughly compared induction and synthesis approaches on a real-world test set. In this work, we not only demonstrate strong empirical results compared ar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n07 46\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 1\nM ar\n2 01\n7\nto past work, we also directly contrast the strengths and weaknesses of both neural program learning approaches for the first time.\nThe primary task evaluated for this work is a Programming By Example (PBE) system for string transformations similar to FlashFill (Gulwani et al., 2012; Gulwani, 2011). FlashFill allows Microsoft Excel end-users to perform regular expression-based string transformations using examples without having to write complex macros. For example, a user may want to extract zip codes from a text field containing addresses, or transform a timestamp to a different format. An example is shown in Figure 1. A user manually provides a small number of example output strings to convey the desired intent and the goal of FlashFill is to generalize the examples to automatically generate the corresponding outputs for the remaining input strings. Since the end goal is to emit the correct output strings, and not a program, the task itself is agnostic to whether a synthesis or induction approach is taken.\nFor modeling, we develop novel variants of the attentional RNN architecture (Bahdanau et al., 2014) to encode a variable-length unordered set of input-output examples. For program representation, we have developed a domain-specific language (DSL), similar to that of Gulwani et al. (2012), that defines an expressive class of regular expression-based string transformations. The neural network is then used to generate a program in the DSL (for synthesis) or an output string (for induction). Both systems are trained end-to-end using a large set of input-output examples and programs uniformly sampled from the DSL.\nWe compare our neural induction model, neural synthesis model, and the rule-based architecture of Gulwani et al. (2012) on a real-world FlashFill test set. We also inject varying amounts of noise (i.e., simulated typos) into the FlashFill test examples to model the robustness of different learning approaches. While the manual approaches work reasonably well for well-formed I/O examples, we show that its performance degrades dramatically in presence of even small amounts of noise. We show that our neural architectures are significantly more robust in presence of noise and moreover obtain an accuracy comparable to manual approaches even for non-noisy examples.\nThis paper makes the following key contributions:\n• We present a novel variant of the attentional RNN architecture, which allows for encoding of a variablesize set of input-output examples. • We evaluate the architecture on 205 real-world FlashFill instances and significantly outperform the previous best statistical system (92% vs. 34% accuracy). • We compare the model to a hand-crafted synthesis algorithm and show that while both systems achieve\nsimilar performance on clean test data, our model is significantly more robust to realistic noise (with noise, 80% accuracy vs. 6% accuracy). • We compare our neural synthesis architecture with a neural induction architecture, and demonstrate that each approach has its own strengths under different evaluation metrics and decoding constraints."

      "text" : "There has been an abundance of recent work on neural program induction and synthesis.\nNeural Program Induction: Neural Turing Machine (NTM) (Graves et al., 2014) uses a neural controller to read and write to an external memory tape using soft attention and is able to learn simple algorithmic tasks such as array copying and sorting. Stack-RNNs (Joulin & Mikolov, 2015) augment a neural controller with an external stackstructured memory and is able to learn algorithmic patterns of small description length. Neural GPU (Kaiser & Sutskever, 2015) presents a Turing-complete model similar to NTM, but with a parallel and shallow design similar to that of GPUs, and is able to learn complex algorithms such as long binary multiplication. Neural ProgrammerInterpreters (Reed & de Freitas, 2016) teach a controller to learn algorithms from program traces as opposed to examples. Neural Random-Access Machines (Kurach et al., 2016) uses a continuous representation of 14 high-level modules consisting of simple arithmetic functions and reading/writing to a variable-size random-access memory to learn algorithmic tasks requiring pointer manipulation and dereferencing to memory. The domain of string transformations is different than the domains handled by these approaches and moreover, unlike RobustFill, these approaches need to be re-trained per problem instance.\nNeural Program Synthesis: The most closely related work to ours uses a Recursive-Reverse-Recursive neural network (R3NN) to learn string transformation programs from examples (Parisotto et al., 2017), and is directly compared in Section 5.1. DeepCoder (Balog et al., 2016) trains a neural network to predict a distribution over possible functions useful for a given task from input-output examples, which is used to augment an external search algorithm. Unlike DeepCoder, RobustFill performs an end-toend synthesis of programs from examples. Terpret (Gaunt et al., 2016) and Neural Forth (Riedel et al., 2016) allow programmers to write sketches of partial programs to express prior procedural knowledge, which are then completed by training neural networks on examples.\nDSL-based synthesis: Non-statistical DSL-based synthesis approaches (Gulwani et al., 2012) exploit independence properties of DSL operators to develop a divide-and-\nconquer based search algorithm with several hand-crafted pruning and ranking heuristics (Polozov & Gulwani, 2015). In this work, we present a neural architecture to automatically learn an efficient synthesis algorithm. There is also some work on using learnt clues to guide the search in DSL expansions (Menon et al., 2013), but this requires handcoded textual features of examples."

For each example set, we assume there exists at least one program P that will correctly transform all of these examples, i.e., P (I1) → O1, ..., P (Iy1 ) → O y 1 , ... Throughout this work, we refer to (Ij , Oj) as observed examples and (I y j , O y j ) as assessment examples. We use InStr and OutStr to generically refer to I/O examples that may be observed or assessment. We refer to this complete set of information as an instance:\nI1 = January O1 = jan I2 = February O2 = feb I3 = March O3 = mar Iy1 = April O y 1 = apr Iy2 = May O y 2 = may P = ToCase(Lower, SubStr(1,3))\nIntuitively, imagine that a (non-programmer) user has a large list of InStr which they wish to process in some way. The goal is to only require the user to manually create a small number of corresponding OutStr, and the system will generate the remaining OutStr automatically.\nIn the program synthesis approach, we train a neural model which takes (I1, O1), ..., (In, On) as input and generates P as output, token-by-token. It is trained fully supervised on a large corpus of synthetic I/O Example + Program pairs. It is not conditioned on the assessment input strings Iyj , but it could be in future work. At test time, the model is provided with new set of observed I/O examples and attempts to generate the corresponding P which it (maybe) has never seen in training. Crucially, the system can actually execute the generated P on each observed input string Ij and check if it produces Oj .1 If not, it knows that P cannot be the correct program, and it can search for a different P . Of course, even if P is consistent on all observed examples,\n1This execution is deterministic, not neural.\nthere is no guarantee that it will generalize to new examples (i.e., assessment examples). We can think of consistency as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition. The actual success metric is whether this program generalizes to the corresponding assessment examples, i.e., P (Iyj ) = O y j . There also may be multiple valid programs.\nIn the program induction approach, we train a neural model which takes (I1, O1), ..., (In, On) and Iy as input and generates Oy as output, character-by-character. Our current model decodes each assessment example independently. Crucially, the induction model makes no explicit use use of program P at training or test time. Instead, we say that it induces a latent representation of the program. If we had a large corpus of real-world I/O examples, we could in fact train an induction model without any explicit program representation. Since such a corpus is not available, it is trained on the same synthesized I/O Examples as the synthesis model. Note that since the program representation is latent, there is no way to measure consistency.\nWe can comparably evaluate both approaches by measuring generalization accuracy, which is the percent of test instances for which the system has successfully produced the correct OutStr for all assessment examples. For synthesis this means P (Iyj ) = O y j ∀(I y j , O y j ). For induction this means all Oy generated by the system are exactly correct. We typically use four observed examples and six assessment examples per test instance. All six must be exactly correct for the model to get credit."

      "heading" : "3.2. The Domain Specific Language",
      "text" : "The Domain Specific Language (DSL) used here to represent P models a rich set of string transformations based on substring extractions, string conversions, and constant strings. The DSL is similar to the DSL described in Parisotto et al. (2017), but is extended to include nested expressions, arbitrary constant strings, and a powerful regexbased substring extraction function. The syntax of the DSL is shown in Figure 2 and the formal semantics are presented in the supplementary material.\nA program P : string ⇒ string in the DSL takes as input a string and returns another string as output. The top-level operator in the DSL is the Concat operator that concatenates a finite list of string expressions ei. A string expression e can either be a substring expression f , a nesting expression n, or a constant string expression. A substring expression can either be defined using two constant positions indices k1 and k2 (where negative indices denote positions from the right), or using the GetSpan(r1, ii, y1, r2, i2, y2) construct that returns the substring between the ith1 occurrence of regex r1 and the ith2 occurrence of regex r2, where y1 and y2 denotes either the start or end of the corresponding regex matches. The\nnesting expressions allow for further nested string transformations on top of the substring expressions allowing to extract kth occurrence of certain regex, perform casing transformations, and replacing a delimiter with another delimiter. The notation e1 | e2 | ... is sometimes used as a shorthand for Concat(e1, e2, ...). The nesting and substring expressions take a string as input (implicitly as a lambda parameter). We sometimes refer expressions such as ToCase(Lower)(v) as ToCase(Lower,v).\nThere are approximately 30 million unique string expressions e, which can be concatenated to create arbitrarily long programs. Any search method that does not encode inverse function semantics (either by hand or with a statistical model) cannot prune partial expressions. Thus, even efficient techniques like dynamic programming (DP) with black-box expression evaluation would still have to search over many millions of candidates."

To do this, we use a strategy of random sampling and generation. First, we randomly sample programs from our DSL, up to a maximum length (10 expressions). Given a sampled program, we compute a simple set of heuristic requirements on the InStr such that the program can be executed without throwing an exception. For example, if an expression in the program retrieves the 4th number, the InStr must have at least 4 numbers. Then, each InStr is generated as a random sequence of ASCII characters, constrained to satisfy the requirements. The corresponding OutStr is generated by executing the\nprogram on the InStr.\nFor evaluating the trained models, we use FlashFillTest, a set of 205 real-world examples collected from Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and provided to us by the authors of Gulwani et al. (2012) and Parisotto et al. (2017). Each FlashFillTest instance has ten I/O examples, of which the first four are used as observed examples and the remaining six are used as assessment examples.2 Some examples of FlashFillTest instances are provided in the supplementary material. Intuitively, it is possible to generalize to a realword test set using randomly synthesized training because the model is learning function semantics, rather than a particular data distribution."

In the most general description, we encode the observed I/O using a series of recurrent neural networks (RNN), and generate P using another RNN one token at a time. The key challenge here is that in typical sequenceto-sequence modeling, the input to the model is a single sequence. In this case, the input is a variable-length, unordered set of sequence pairs, where each pair (i.e., an I/O example) has an internal conditional dependency.

The architecture is shown at the bottom of Figure 3. We did not find it beneficial to add another fully-connected layer or recurrent layer after pooling.\nFormally, the layers labeled “FC” and “MaxPool” perform the operation mi = MaxPoolj∈n(tanh(Whji)), where i is the current timestep, n is the number of observed examples, hji ∈ Rd is the output of Pj at the timestep i, and W ∈ Rd×d is a set of learned weights.

Unlike a typical sequence generation task, where the model is decoded with a beam k and then only the 1-best output is taken, here all k-best candidates are executed one-by-one to determine consistency. If multiple program candidates are consistent with all observed examples, the program with the highest model score is taken as the output.5 This program is referred to as P ∗.\nIn addition to standard beam search, we also propose a variant referred to as “DP-Beam,” which adds a search constraint similar to the dynamic programming algorithm mentioned in Section 3.3. Here, each time an expression is completed during the search, the partial program is executed in a black-box manner. If any resulting partial OutStr is not a string prefix of the observed OutStr, the partial program is removed from the beam. This technique is effective because our DSL is largely concatenative.\nGeneralization accuracy is computed by applying P ∗ to all six assessment examples. The percentage score reported in the figures represents the proportion of test instances for which a consistent program was found and it resulted in the exact correct output for all six assessment examples. Consistency is evaluated in Section 5.2.\nResults are shown in Figure 4.

More concretely, we can train a neural network which takes as input a set of n observed examples (I1, O1), ...(In, On) as well an unpaired InStr, Iy , and generates the corresponding OutStr, Oy . As an example, from Figure 1, I1 = “john Smith”, O1 = “Smith, Jhn”, I2 = “DOUG Q. Macklin”, ... , Iy = “Steve P. Green”, Oy = “Green, Steve”. Both approaches have the same end goal – determine the Oy corresponding to Iy – but have several important conceptual differences.\nThe first major difference is that the induction model does not use the program P anywhere. The synthesis model generates P , which is executed by the DSL to produced Oy . The induction model generates Oy directly by sequentially predicting each character. In fact, in cases where it is possible to obtain a very large amount of real-world I/O example sets, induction is a very appealing approach since it does not require an explicit DSL.7 The core idea is the model learns some latent program representation which can generalize beyond a specific DSL. It also eliminates the need to hand-design the DSL, unless the DSL is needed to synthesize training data.\nThe second major difference is that program induction has no concept of consistency. As described previously, in program synthesis, a k-best list of program candidates is executed one-by-one, and the first program consistent with all observed examples is taken as the output. As shown in Section 5.2, if a consistent program can be found, it is likely to generalize to new inputs. Program induction, on the other hand, is essentially a standard sequence generation task akin to neural machine translation or image captioning – we directly decode Oy with a beam search and take the highest-scoring candidate as our output.\n7In the results shown here, the induction model is trained on data synthesized with the DSL, but the model training is agnostic to this fact."

All noise was applied with uniform random probability into the InStr or OutStr using character insertions, deletions, or substitutions. Noise is not applied to the assessment examples, as this would make evaluation impossible.\nWe compare the models in this paper to the actual FlashFill implementation found in Microsoft Excel, as described in Gulwani et al. (2012). An overview of this model is described in Section 2. The results were obtained using a macro in Microsoft Excel 2016.\nThe noise results are shown in Figure 8. The neural models behave very similarly, each degrading approximately 2% absolute accuracy for each noise character introduced. The behavior of Excel FlashFill is quite different. Without noise, it achieves 92% accuracy,11 matching the best result reported earlier in this paper. However, with just one or two characters of noise, Excel FlashFill is effectively “broken.” This result is expected, since the efficiency of their algorithm is critically centered around exact string matching (Gulwani et al., 2012). We believe that this robustness to noise is one of the strongest attributes of DNN-based approaches to program synthesis."

This matches the performance of a hand-engineered system and outperforms the previous-best neural synthesis model by 58%. Moreover, we have demonstrated that our model remains robust to moderate levels of noise in the I/O examples, while the hand-engineered system fails for even small amounts of noise. Additionally, we carefully contrasted our\n10Standard beam is also used instead of DP-Beam. 11FlashFill was manually developed on this exact set.\nneural program synthesis system with a neural program induction system, and showed that even though the synthesis system performs better on this task, both approaches have their own strength under certain evaluation conditions. In particular, synthesis systems have an advantage when evaluating if all outputs are correct, while induction systems have strength when evaluating which system has the most correct outputs."

      "text" : "Section 3.2 of the paper provides the grammar of our domain specific language, which both defines the space of possible programs, and allows us to easily sample programs. The formal semantics of this language are defined below in Figure 9. The program takes as input a string v and produces a string as output (result of Concat operator).\nAs an implementational detail, we note that after sampling a program from the grammar, we flatten calls to nesting functions (as defined in Figure 2 of the paper) into a single token. For example, the function GetToken(t, i)would be tokenized as a single token GetTokent,i rather than 3 separate tokens. This is possible because for nesting functions, the size of the total parameter space is small. For all other functions, the parameter space is too large for us to flatten function calls without dramatically increasing the vocabulary size, so we treat parameters as separate tokens."

      "heading" : "B. Synthetic Evaluation Details",
      "text" : "Results on synthetically generated examples are largely omitted from the paper since, in a vacuum, the synthetic dataset can be made arbitrarily easy or difficult via different generation procedures, making summary statistics difficult to interpret. We instead report results on an external real-world dataset to verify that the model has learned function semantics which are at least as expressive as programs observed in real data.\nNevertheless, we include additional details about our experiments on synthetically generated programs for readers interested in the details of our approach. As described in the paper, programs were randomly generated from the DSL by first determining a program length up to a maximum of 10 expressions, and then independently sampling each expression. We used a simple set of heuristics to restrict potential inputs to strings which will produce non-empty outputs (e.g. any program which references the third occurrence of a number will cause us to sample strings containing at least three numbers). We rejected any degenerate samples e.g. those resulting in empty outputs, or outputs longer than 100 characters.\nFigure 12 shows several random synthetically generated samples.\nFigure 10 shows the accuracy of each model on the synthetically generated validation set. Model accuracy on the synthetic validation set is generally consistent with accuracy on the FlashFill dataset, with stronger models on the synthetic dataset also demonstrating stronger performance on the real-world data."

      "text" : "Figure 13 shows several randomly sampled (anonymized) examples from the FlashFill test set, along with their predicted programs outputted by the synthesis model.\nFigure 14 shows several examples which were hand-selected to demonstrate interesting limitations of the model. In the case of the first example, the task is to reformat international telephone numbers. Here, the task is underconstrained given the observed input-output examples, because there are many different programs which are consistent with the observed examples. Note that to extract the first two digits, there are many other possible functions which would produce the correct output in the observed examples, some of which would generalize and some which would not: for exampling, getting the second and third characters, getting the first two digits, or getting the first number. In this case, the predicted program extracts the country code by taking the first two digits, a strategy which fails to generalize to examples with different country codes. The third example demonstrates a difficulty of using real world data. Because examples can come from a variety of sources, they may be irregularly formatted. In this case, although the program is consistent with the observed examples, it does not generalize when the second space in the address is removed. In the final example, the synthesis model completely fails, and none of the 100 highest scoring programs from the model were consistent with the observed output examples. The selected program is the closest program scored by character edit distance.\nD. Induction Network Architecture The network architecture used in the program induction setting is described in Section 6.1 of the paper. The network structure is a modification of synthesis Attention-A, using double attention to jointly attend to Ix andOj , and an additional LSTM to encode Ix. We include a complete diagram below in Figure 11."

Recently, two competing approaches for automatic program learning have received significant attention: (1) neural program synthesis, where a neural network is conditioned on input/output (I/O) examples and learns to generate a program, and (2) neural program induction, where a neural network generates new outputs directly using a latent program representation. Here, for the first time, we directly compare both approaches on a large-scale, real-world learning task. We additionally contrast to rule-based program synthesis, which uses hand-crafted semantics to guide the program generation. Our neural models use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of variable-sized sets of I/O pairs. Our best synthesis model achieves 92% accuracy on a real-world test set, compared to the 34% accuracy of the previous best neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms a comparable induction model on this task, but we more importantly demonstrate that the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric and end-user application. Finally, we show that we can train our neural models to remain very robust to the type of noise expected in real-world data (e.g., typos), while a highlyengineered rule-based system fails entirely.",
