      "text" : "   2  \nNovel information retrieval methods to identify citations relevant to a clinical\ntopic can overcome the knowledge gap existing between the primary literature (MEDLINE) and online clinical knowledge resources such as UpToDate. Searching the MEDLINE database directly or with query expansion methods returns a large number of citations that are not relevant to the query. The current study presents a citation retrieval system that retrieves citations for evidence-based clinical knowledge summarization. This approach combines query expansion, concept-based screening algorithm, and conceptbased vector similarity. We also propose an information extraction framework for automated concept (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Disease) extraction. We evaluated our proposed system on all topics (as queries) available from UpToDate for two diseases, heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The system achieved an overall F-score of 41.2% on HF topics and 42.4% on AFib topics on a gold standard of citations available in UpToDate. This is significantly high when compared to a queryexpansion based baseline (F-score of 1.3% on HF and 2.2% on AFib) and a system that uses query expansion with disease hyponyms and journal names, concept-based screening, and term-based vector similarity system (F-score of 37.5% on HF and 39.5% on AFib). Evaluating the system with top K relevant citations, where K is the number of citations in the gold standard achieved a much higher overall F-score of 69.9% on HF topics and 75.1% on AFib topics. In addition, the system retrieved up to 18 new relevant citations per topic when tested on ten HF and six AFib clinical topics. These citations were verified by a cardiologist to provide potentially useful and new information not available in UpToDate. For these sixteen topics, the concept-based screening framework in our system retrieved citations at an F-score of 50.6% on HF and 49.3% on AFib. This\n   3  \nis significantly higher than an existing PICO concept-based information retrieval system that achieved an F-score of 6.0% on HF and 5.1% on AFib for the same set of topics. The proposed system differs from the existing approaches by focusing on obtaining a high precision while maintaining the recall to obtain the most relevant citations for evidencebased clinical knowledge summarization. We showed that a hybrid combination of queryexpansion, concept-based screening and concept-based vector similarity outperformed other approaches.\nKeywords: information retrieval, information extraction, natural language processing, PICO framework, vector space model, clinical knowledge summarization\n   4  "

      "heading" : "INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "The enormous growth of research in the field of medicine is evident with the ever-\nincreasing number of scientific publications in the last decade. More than 700,000 biomedical primary literature articles were added to MEDLINE in 2014 alone.1 Search engines such as MEDLINE1 or enhancements such as HubMed2 supplement the biomedical literature database and provide instant access to citations. However, not all retrieved citations are relevant to specific needs such as evidence-based clinical knowledge summarization. The existing approaches in the biomedical domain widely adapt Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), term frequency weighing, and sentence-level co-occurrence.3,4 However, significant challenges remain in presenting the most relevant citations for clinicians at point of care.\nA previously published clinical knowledge summarization system5 (that uses\nquery expansion based on Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus6) achieved a very low precision for certain clinical topics in UpToDate7, a widely used point of care clinical knowledge resource, when compared to citations already present in UpToDate. This is because a number of domain experts manually review, appraise and synthesize evidence from MEDLINE citations. This is extremely time consuming. On the other hand, most existing automated systems return citations whose abstracts include a few terms from the clinical topic. These approaches do not take into account factors such as: (i) whether the abstract includes information that is relevant to the population group of interest, (ii) whether the abstract is specific to the intervention or comparison of interest, and (iii) whether the relevant information is presented as a conclusion or mentioned as a method or background. Other existing information retrieval approaches use different similarity metrics such as tf-idf8,9   and present citations that rank high based on the\n   5  \nmetrics. Such approaches are also not reliable for evidence-based clinical knowledge summarization as long as the ranking algorithm does not consider the above-mentioned factors.\nCitation retrieval using PICO10 framework has already been shown to perform\ncomparatively well when PICO concepts from the query are manually entered in a structured format.11 However, translating a query to PICO format is challenging12 and abstracting PICO concepts from the unstructured text of the citation is even more complicated. We overcome the limitations by developing two extraction algorithms that uses syntactic regular expressions and custom-tailored dictionaries for extracting PICO concepts. One of these algorithms extracts population, and the other extracts intervention or comparison, and disease.\nThe purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate an approach for tailoring\ncitations relevant to evidence-based clinical knowledge summarization. We extend an existing query-expansion based system5 with disease hyponyms, journal names, conceptbased screening algorithm, and concept-based vector space model.13 The concepts considered in the current study are population, intervention or comparison, and disease. The concept-based screening algorithm filters the citations by considering whether their abstracts prominently include information that is relevant to the population group of interest, and intervention, comparison and disease of interest. The vector space model further measures the similarity between the query and citation based on concepts (as opposed to just terms or words themselves).\nBACKGROUND\n   6  \nEvidence-based medicine and online clinical knowledge resources\nEvidence-based medicine (EBM) is a systematic approach to integrate the best\navailable research evidence into clinical practice.14 The citations supporting clinical knowledge are researched, created and continually updated from high quality studies published in biomedical journals to provide the treatment options for individual patients or population groups. Integration, organization and utilization of the huge number of available clinical information are necessary to advance health care. Clinicians are expected to have broad knowledge of alternative treatments and diagnoses for a wide array of diseases in order to recommend the most suitable option for their patients. Online clinical knowledge resources such as UpToDate and National Guideline ClearingHouse15 are available to meet clinicians’ information needs at point of care. UpToDate,7 one of the most commonly used online clinical knowledge resources, summarizes actionable treatment recommendations for more than 10,500 clinical topics in 22 specialties from over 400,000 MEDLINE citations. It is updated every 4 to 6 months with contributions from more than 6,000 physician authors, editors and peer reviewers.7,16 The recommendations are from a number of resources, including, but not limited to 450 peerreviewed journals, proceedings of major national and international scientific meetings, guidelines, and databases such as The Cochrane Library.16\nMEDLINE Information Retrieval\nMEDLINE or its interface, PubMed uses query-expansion algorithms3 to refine a\nsimple query using Boolean logic and MeSH vocabulary. Users are able to filter the results based on core clinical journals, clinical queries, publication date, etc.17 MeSH18 is a hierarchical vocabulary of medical concepts from the National Library of Medicine\n   7  \n(NLM) used for indexing citations in MEDLINE. Abridged Index Medicus from MEDLINE provides a set of 119 core clinical journals.19 MEDLINE clinical queries retrieve smaller subset of citations of methodologically sound studies meeting evidencebased standards of adult general medicine.20 Extensions to MEDLINE such as HubMed2 searches the query terms within a title or an abstract; Relemed21 uses sentence-level cooccurrence for multi-word queries; and GoPubMed22 classifies citations on Gene Ontology terms."

Clinicians use a specialized framework called PICO for exploring sections of a clinical query that are more applicable to their patients.10,12,23 PICO stands for Patient/Population – Intervention – Comparison – Outcome. PICO framework is expanded to PICOTT (Patient/Population – Intervention – Comparison – Outcome – Type of question being asked – Type of study design),11 PECODR (Patient/Population/Problem – Exposure/Intervention – Comparison – Outcome - Duration - Results)24 and PIBOSO (Population – Intervention – Background – Outcome - Study Design – Other).25 NLM provides a web-based application for PICO with spelling checker for structuring the clinical query.26 Schardt et.al11 utilized the NLM PICO interface to improve the MEDLINE search on a given clinical query. Our approach differs from Schardt et.al11 and is more advanced. We present two extraction algorithms using constituency-tree based patterns, UMLS Metathesaurus,6 and KEGG’s USP drug classification27 for automatically extracting population, intervention or comparison, and\n   8  \ndisease concepts. The extracted concepts are used for retrieving and tailoring the citations and for measuring the similarity between the clinical query and citations using vector space model."

      "text" : "Vector Space Model (VSM) is a mathematical model often used by information\nretrieval (IR) systems.13 The relevance measure with VSM is shown to be effective in the context of IR systems.28,29 The degree of similarity between the input query q and retrieved citation ci (represents a given citation in a set of retrieved citations) is calculated using a similarity metric such as cosine (θ). The cosine similarity metric is represented as a ratio of the dot product of two vectors q and ci to their magnitude.30\n  \n\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDF03 \uD835\uDC5E, \uD835\uDC50! =   \uD835\uDC5E  . \uD835\uDC50! \uD835\uDC5E      \uD835\uDC50!      \nThe term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) is the most common\nweighing method used for representing document relevancy in VSM.8,31  Each term in the vector is assigned a weight to represent its importance in ci and q within the entire set of retrieved citations. The term weight is determined by two factors: the number of occurrences of term j in ci (term frequency, tfi,j) and the total number of occurrences of term j in the entire collection of citations c (document frequency, dfj). With N representing the total number of citations, the inverse document frequency (idfj) of a term j can be defined as:\n   9  \n\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC53! = \uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC54   \uD835\uDC41 \uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC53!\nThe composite weight for a term (tf-idf) in each citation is calculated as the product of term frequency and inverse document frequency.

The search is executed as a Boolean model.\nTo automatically modify the input query, we first extracted the intervention or\ncomparison, and disease by mapping to UMLS Metathesaurus6 using a pipeline of Natural Language Processing (NLP) components combining rule-based and machine learning techniques.36 The intervention or comparison, and disease concepts are\n   11  \nautomatically transformed into MeSH terms and added to the query. Hyponyms of each disease are extracted from World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 classification of human diseases by mapping the text to its parent node.37 These disease mentions are automatically transformed into MeSH terms and added to the query.\nInformation from high quality clinical journals is more reliable than from other\njournals. We revise the query automatically so that it only returns articles published in a set of 200 high quality clinical journals from MEDLINE1 and McMaster Plus Database38, 10 journals identified through a journal prioritization algorithm39 and 642 additional journals and proceedings of major national and international scientific meetings cited by UpToDate. Additionally, based on empirical observation of existing citations in UpToDate, we restricted the articles published before 1974.\nType of publication includes a study with a known study design (systematic\nreview, randomized controlled trial, multiple time series, nonrandomized trial, cohort, case-control, time series, cross-sectional, and case studies),32 practice guideline or editorial.  Articles that do not mention any of these are excluded from the results since they are likely to be non-clinical publications or not peer-reviewed (book chapters, newspaper articles, etc.). Our previous study infers the study design using information present in several sections of a citation, publication type (available from PubMed), MeSH terms, title and abstract.32 The algorithm infers type of publication first from publication type index and then from MeSH index for the citation. If type of publication is not available in both these indexes, the algorithm screens title and abstract sections for its mention.\n   12  \nScreening with PICO framework\nRetrieval using E-Utilities is insufficient to identify relevant citations for a\nspecific purpose. It is challenging to design a search query that returns most of the relevant citations without retrieving many irrelevant citations simultaneously. We approach this challenge by developing two extraction algorithms to search for citations matching the population, intervention or comparison, and disease concepts in the title or abstract with the corresponding concepts in the query."

First, sentences from citations are segmented and are parsed with Stanford lexical parser41 using the PCFG model. The parser generates a constituency parse tree of noun and verb phrases. A sentence may contain more than one noun or verb phrase, and sometimes it is nested within another noun or verb phrase. Then, the generated parse tree is queried using Tregex,42 a tree query language implemented in Stanford parser (Figure 2). We developed a set of Tregex patterns (Table 1) to extract a sub-tree with population. These patterns are similar to regular expressions and are easy to use. However, the sub-tree matching a Tregex pattern do not always account for population.

Our approach is a pipeline of NLP components combining rule-based and machine learning techniques.5 The pipeline consists of four components: tokenization, lexical normalization, UMLS Metathesaurus look-up, and concept screening. The tokenization component splits the query and citation into tokens or words using open NLP suite.44 The lexical normalization component converts words into canonical form using an efficient in-memory data structure similar to a hash table.45 UMLS Metathesaurus look-up is performed using a well-known efficient algorithm called Aho-Corasick string matching.46\n   19  \nThe concept screening component limits UMLS concepts to four semantic groups47: disorders, chemicals (includes drugs), procedures, and devices."

For citations, information from title, abstract and MeSH index are used to extract the required concepts. We use the extraction algorithms to obtain concepts from title and abstract. However, for extracting the concepts from MeSH index, we use the descriptors and their qualifiers.\nEach MeSH term (XML format) includes a Descriptor Name (e.g.\n<DescriptorName …>Heart Failure</DescriptorName>) and an optional Qualifier Name (e.g. <QualifierName …>drug therapy</QualifierName>). The descriptor name is the MeSH term from NLM controlled vocabulary thesaurus and the qualifier name represents the context of the MeSH term in a citation. The qualifier name also mentions whether it is the main topic of the citation (e.g. MajorTopicYN=”Y”). The descriptor name and qualifier name together represents the information available in the citation. For example,\n   23  \npresence of ‘heart failure/drug therapy’ (descriptor name/qualifier name) as the main topic indicates that the citation conveys information on drug therapy for heart failure. In the current study, we restricted the qualifier name to the following clinically significant categories: therapy, diagnosis, diagnostic use, drug therapy, mortality, surgery, ultrasonography, prevention and control, rehabilitation, complications, congenital, epidemiology, ethnology, etiology, therapeutic use, pharmacology, adverse effects, contraindications, administration and dosage, agonists, antagonists and inhibitors, and analogs and derivatives. These qualifier names are derived from the entire list of qualifiers (83 in total) from NLM.53 Certain qualifier names such as blood, blood supply, biosynthesis, chemically synthesis, chemistry, history, metabolism, etc. are not significant.\nFor each concept extracted from the query using our extraction algorithms, the\nscreening algorithm looks for a match within citation’s MeSH index, title and abstract sections.

In the current study, we introduce concept-based vector similarity instead of term-based vector similarity. Here, the contents of vector are concepts (e.g. population, intervention, comparison and disease) instead of terms. Our approach represents the query or citation as three independent vectors namely population vector, intervention or comparison vector, and disease vector. Extraction of population, intervention or comparison, and disease concepts in the query and citation are achieved with our extraction algorithms discussed above. For population vector, we first performed stemming and removal of stopwords. The similarity between the query and citation is estimated by measuring the similarity between the respective concept vectors.\nWe constructed two sets of concepts-based vector space models: one for the query\nand other for the citation. Each set consists of three vectors namely population vector, intervention or comparison vector, and disease vector. The similarity between query and citation is calculated with tf-idf: the similarity in terms of population is estimated as ‘Population similarity score’, the similarity in terms of intervention or comparison is estimated as ‘Intervention similarity score’, and the similarity in terms of disease is\n   25  \nestimated as ‘Disease similarity score’. The overall similarity is estimated as the sum of three similarity scores mentioned above. In addition, we assign weight hyper parameter for each of these similarity scores such that the total weight is always equal to one, w1+w2+w3=1 In the current study intervention or comparison are assigned with a higher weight, i.e. w2=0.4. Disease mentions mostly appear in combination with population (e.g. patients with heart failure) and both are assigned with equal weights, i.e. w1=0.3 and w3=0.3.

Topics relevant to both diseases (e.g. the management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure) are considered under the disease for which it is more relevant. Topics related to other diseases (e.g. the use of bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis) or those that are more general (e.g. fish oil and marine omega-3 fatty acids)\n   26  \nare not included in the study. The topics were collected after the system development and therefore did not bias the evaluation. For system development, three topics suggested by a cardiologist (AJS) (‘Anticoagulation in older adults’; ‘Management of thromboembolic risk in patients with atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease’; and ‘The use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with an acute or prior intracerebral hemorrhage’ topics from UpToDate) were used. The initial performance of the system was tested with all sixteen topics from two clinical areas: anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation (6 topics) and treatment for heart failure due to systolic dysfunction (10 topics). As the performance was promising, we evaluated the system on all topics related to AFib (110 topics) and HF (110 topics). Our system does not learn features or use rules that are based on the topics and the topics used for our evaluation are different from the topics used for development.

The concept-based vector space model (System E) shows a better F-score on both HF topics (41.2% vs. 37.5%) and AFib topics (42.4% vs. 39.5%) when compared to term-based vector space model (System D). The query expansion algorithm (System B) reported a low recall of 18.0% on HF topics and 20.1% on AFib topics even with termbased vector similarity ranking. Our attempt to improve the recall by expanding the input query with disease hyponyms based on ICD-10 classification (as described in Query Expansion with NLM E-Utilities section) significantly increased the recall to 78.9% on HF topics and 85.1% on AFib topics (System C). For example, an input related to intracerebral hemorrhage achieved recall of 5.7% with the query expansion algorithm (System A). Adding of other hemorrhage subtypes, such as cerebral hemorrhage,\n   30  \nintracranial hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, in System C increased its recall to 84.3%. The hybrid approach of combining concept-based screening with concept-based vector space models (System E) improved the F-score significantly to 41.2% on HF topics and 42.4% for AFib topics by removing many irrelevant citations (System E). System E reports a decrease in recall (8.5% (78.9 – 70.4) on HF topics and 8.3% (85.1 – 76.8) on AFib topics) with a remarkable increase in precision (28.9% (29.1 – 0.2) on HF topics and 29.1% (29.3 – 0.2) on AFib topics) when compared to System C. The decrease in recall in the attempt to increase precision is mostly due to citations without abstracts.\nAcross both topics, the automated retrieval system presents 74.1% (6917 citations\nout of 9333 citations) citations available in UpToDate on various clinical topics. Furthermore, the number of citations retrieved and ranked by the system is reasonable when compared to the number of citations in UpToDate for the same topic."

The interface further allows the user to select type of publication: clinical trial, meta-analysis, randomized controlled trial, review, and practice guideline. We evaluated our system that does concept-based screening (System D from Table 3) and NLM PICO interface with population, intervention and comparison concepts. Table 7 shows the\nperformance of our system and NLM PICO interface under these settings: our system (Setting A in Table 7, same as System D from Table 3), our system using population, intervention and comparison concepts manually extracted from the topic title (Setting B in Table 7), NLM PICO interface using concepts automatically extracted from the title using our algorithm (Setting C in Table 7), and NLM PICO interface using manually extracted concepts (Setting D in Table 7). We used sixteen topics from two clinical areas (described in ‘manual analysis of false positives’ subsection). Setting A achieved an overall F-score of 50.6% on HF topics and 49.3% on AFib topics. Setting B achieved an overall F-score of 52.8% on HF topics and 52.1% on AFib topics. This shows that performance of automated extraction (Setting A) is relatively comparable to performance of manually extracted concepts (Setting B). For NLM PICO interface, the performance of automated extraction (Setting C) vs. performance of manually extracted concepts is also almost the same (Table 7). This confirms that our automated extraction performs equally well as that of using manually extracted concepts.\n   39  \nA.

Manually extracted concept, NLM PICO interface\n3.8 17.5 6.2 3.4 19.4 5.8\nThe overall performance of our system is significantly high when compared to the\noverall performance of NLM PICO interface with automated extraction (Setting A vs. Setting C) and manual extraction of concepts (Setting B vs. Setting D) (Table 7). The high performance of our system is due to the following facts:\n(1) Our concept screening algorithm checks whether the population mentioned in\nthe citation is relevant to the query. The algorithm also checks whether the citation is specific to intervention or comparison of interest. It also checks whether the relevant information is from conclusive sentences. When these\n   40  \nfactors are not considered, the performance of existing retrieval approaches are found to be poor (as discussed in introduction section). For example, an overall F-score of 6.0% on HF topics and 5.1% on AFib topics achieved by NLM PICO interface (Setting C from Table 7).\n(2) Our system searches for citations belonging to eleven categories of type of\npublication: systematic review, randomized controlled trial, multiple time series, nonrandomized trial, cohort, case-control, time series, cross-sectional, case studies, practice guideline, and editorial. NLM PICO interface searches for citations belonging to only five categories of type of publication: clinical trial, meta-analysis, randomized controlled trial, review and practice guideline. Furthermore, our system includes other parameters i.e. journals, disease hyponyms and year of publication (described in methods section). Accordingly, the recall of 74.7% on HF topics and 63.9% on AFib topics (Setting A from Table 7) achieved by our system is significantly higher than the recall of 16.2% on HF topics and 16.6% on AFib topics (Setting C from Table 7) achieved by NLM PICO interface.\nFurther analysis of extraction algorithms Performance of population extraction algorithm\nFor preliminary analysis, the algorithm was evaluated on a gold standard of 4,824\nsentences from 18 UpToDate documents and a second gold standard of 714 sentences from MEDLINE citations. UpToDate gold standard includes population information related to coronary artery disease, hypertension, depression, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and prostate cancer. MEDLINE gold standard includes population information\n   41  \nrelated to congestive HF and AFib. The algorithm achieved 91% precision, 97% recall and 94% F-score on UpToDate gold standard.59 The algorithm achieved 90% precision, 83% recall and 87% F-score on MEDLINE gold standard. The algorithm performs well for thousands of sentences talking about multiple disease conditions from two different datasets.\nPerformance of intervention extraction algorithm\nThe algorithm for extracting intervention, comparison and disease consists of two\ncomponents – concept extraction and drug normalization. The concept extraction algorithm (MedTagger) is adopted from our previous study.5 Overall, the precision, recall, and F-measure of the tool are 80%, 57%, and 67% respectively for strict evaluation and 94%, 77%, and 84% for relaxed evaluation60 on the CLEF 2013 shared task. The accuracy of MedTagger on a corpus depends on the contents and accuracy of UMLS Metathesaurus, and the accuracy of lexical normalization resource. These resources are developed by NLM and have been extensively used in several NLP systems. While the system has not been intrinsically evaluated for biomedical abstracts, MedTagger has been used as a component of several literature-mining pipelines.5,59,61\nFor drug normalization algorithm, we performed an intrinsic analysis using a gold\nstandard obtained from 852 MEDLINE citations related to HF and AFib that are cited by the sixteen UpToDate topics used in Table 4. The algorithm achieved a precision of 86.8%, recall of 84.7% and F-score of 85.7%.\nDISCUSSION\n   42  \nIn this study we assessed the feasibility of automatically retrieving relevant\ncitations for evidence-based clinical knowledge summarization. The system retrieved 6917 citations out of 9333 citations from all 220 topics. Error analysis on citations that were not retrieved by the system (false negatives) showed that many of these citations do not have abstracts (e.g. PMID: 22052525, 23741058). Therefore, processing citations at abstract level is unsuccessful in spite of their retrieval by query expansion based baseline system. This resulted in a decrease of system recall by about 8% when compared to query expansion based baseline with disease hyponyms and journal names (Table 3). Such citations are mostly from clinical guidelines and their retrieval needs to be addressed.\nOur system performance is promising in terms of retrieving relevant citations that\nare not available in UpToDate. The system retrieved several new citations with new clinical information and several citations that were cited in related articles. The new citations include new knowledge for UpToDate as agreed between the annotators. The capability of enoximone in improving ventricular function when added to digitalisdiuretics therapy (PMID: 6823859) and prolonging life of many hospitalized patients with heart failure with a specific beta-blocker namely carvedilol (PMID: 15144944) etc. are a few example citations with new knowledge.\nCertain citations are retrieved for multiple topics. For example, PMIDs 15632878,\n17383287, 10809026, 14760332, 9886708, 15846279, 15459606, 17126654, 15894978, 10551702, 15144943, 15144944, 25399276, 23315907, 19717851 are retrieved for two HF topics: ‘use of beta-blockers in heart failure due to systolic dysfunction’ and ‘rationale for and clinical trials of beta blockers in heart failure due to systolic dysfunction’. One possible reason is that certain concepts of both topics (beta-blockers, heart failure and systolic dysfunction) are the same. Additionally, the system retrieved\nPMIDs 14583895, 17996820, 10908096, and 18506054 for ‘use of beta-blockers in heart failure due to systolic dysfunction’ and PMID 21035578 for ‘rationale for and clinical trials of beta blockers in heart failure due to systolic dysfunction’.\nAdditional experiments on system performance\nWe evaluated the system using precision, recall and F-score. Precision is the\nfraction of retrieved documents that are relevant and recall is the fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved. The harmonic mean of precision and recall is reported as a single measure called F-measure. Precision and recall are the most frequent and basic measures for information retrieval effectiveness for unranked retrieval.31 We adopted this approach for evaluating our system because the gold standard is not a ranked list. In addition, we also evaluated the system with two more standard information retrieval evaluation approaches, precision at K and precision-recall curve.31 System performance on Top K citations where K is the number of citations available for that UpToDate topic reports a significantly higher F-scores of 69.9% for HF topics and 75.1% for AFib topics (Table 8). In this analysis, the value of K is not fixed because the number of citations per topic in the gold standard varies between 1 and 155. Nevertheless, this shows that our system can achieve a much higher precision, recall and F-score when the user supplies the system with the number of citations that need to be retrieved.\n   44  \nFor precision-recall curve, we estimated the overall performance of the system on HF topics (110 in total) and AFib topics (110 in total) at various numbers of citations. For each number of citations retrieved (subset), precision and recall is calculated. The system performance for both HF topics and AFib topics shows a decrease in precision with an increase in recall (Table 9). The corresponding precision and recall of each subset of retrieved citations is plotted with precision in y-axis and recall in x-axis. Figure 5 shows the precision-recall curve for HF topics and AFib topics.\n   46  "

      "text" : "Approaches that do not consider the three factors (discussed in introduction\nsection) tend to give poor performance on retrieving citations for evidence-based clinical knowledge summarization (e.g. NLM PICO interface (Table 7)). Here, we would like to correlate these factors and our targeted solutions.\nFactor 1: MEDLINE citation should include information relevant to the population group of interest.\nThe screening algorithm checks whether the population information from\nMEDLINE citation and the query are matching. For achieving this, the population concept from the citation (i.e. title and abstract) and query is extracted with a set of\n   47  \nsyntactic patterns (described in ‘Extraction of population’ subsection). The similarity measure is performed at concept level.\nFactor 2: The citation should be specific to the intervention, comparison and disease of interest.\nThe screening algorithm checks whether the intervention, comparison and disease\nconcepts present in the citation are relevant to the query. For achieving this, the required concepts are extracted from MeSH index, title and abstract of the citation. We proposed an algorithm for extracting the concepts from MeSH index (described in ‘Screening algorithm’ subsection). Extraction of concepts from title and abstract is achieved with our concept extraction algorithm (described in ‘Extraction of intervention, comparison and disease’ subsection).\nFactor 3: The query concepts should be present in the conclusion section of the abstract rather than in background or methods section.\nThe screening algorithm checks for the presence of query concepts (i.e.\npopulation, intervention, comparison and disease) in the conclusion section of a structured abstract. In unstructured abstracts, the conclusion section is identified with related phrases (e.g. ‘In conclusion’, ‘We conclude that’). Otherwise, the presence of query concepts is checked in the last two sentences. Furthermore, the algorithm also checks for the presence of population, intervention, comparison and disease related query concepts in the same or subsequent sentences of the abstract.\nRule-based drug normalization vs. Fuzzy matching\n   48  \nIn the current study, we used a set of rules to normalize the drug mentions for\nmapping to the dictionary. Fuzzy matching can also be used for the same task. A challenge with fuzzy matching is that deciding the threshold can be ad hoc; so, we employed intuitive rules instead of an ad hoc score as a dependency. However, this algorithm of ours can be extended for fuzzy matching. We have implemented a string similarity metric to find the similarity between the normalized drug mention in the citation and the normalized dictionary mention in our code. Our approach can be seen as a special case of fuzzy matching where our threshold is 1.0. Our initial experiments showed no improvement in the accuracy if the threshold is decreased to less than 1.0.\nImpact of weight in concept-based vector similarity\nWe conducted an analysis on the weight hyper parameter (w1, w2 and w3) by\nassigning values to w1, w2 and w3 such that their sum is always one, i.e. w1+w2+w3=1 (Table 9). The overall performance of the system remains constant (F-score) for both HF (110 topics) and AFib (110 topics) when the weights are close to each other. However, the overall performance decreased when we considered only one concept (weights of the other two concepts being 0.0). In the current study, we assigned the weights with the following values: w1=w3=0.3 and w2=0.4. If the weights for the concept vectors were all 0.0 and term-based vectors would have been used instead of concept-based vectors, the F-scores for HF and AFib would have reduced from 41.2% and 42.4% to 37.5% and 39.5% respectively (Table 3, System D).\nTable 10.

First, the system evaluation included\nonly two clinical topics, thus limiting the generalizability of our findings. However, the accuracy of the system is consistent across and within the topics. This is evident from a similar overall F-score of 41.2% (95% confidence interval of 31.9% to 43.1%) for HF and 42.4% (95% confidence interval of 32.0% to 43.2%) for AFib. The preliminary results provide useful insights into the feasibility of the proposed approach and potential improvements required for improved performance.\n   50  \nSecond, PICO framework based filtration at abstract level is limited to citations\nhaving abstracts. However, there are citations (e.g. practice guidelines) where the abstract is not available. Therefore, searching for relevant information should be extended to full text rather than at abstract level.\nThird, our approach implements population, intervention, comparison and disease\nfor concept-based screening algorithm. Outcome is not included because we believe that the metrics for primary and secondary outcomes are fairly standard for a given population, intervention and comparison. However, it is unclear whether the performance of our system could improve when outcome is used.\nFinally, using UpToDate as a gold standard has a major limitation that all relevant\nand potentially useful citations from the primary literature are not always available in UpToDate. Therefore, citations retrieved by the system might include potentially useful information that is not available in UpToDate."

We showed that the accuracy of citation retrieval is significantly improved by using concept-based vector similarity after extracting population, intervention or comparison, and disease concepts. Furthermore, evaluation of the system on Top K citations achieved an overall F-score of 69.9% on heart failure and 75.1% on atrial fibrillation showing the importance of users’ judgment about the number of citations to be used. Overall, the hybrid combination of concept-based screening algorithm for screening citations and for\n   51  \nrelevancy measure using concept-based vector similarity outperformed approaches using only PICO framework, term-based vector similarity, or query expansion. Annotation of apparent false positives by domain experts shows that few of these citations actually have new knowledge that is not available in online clinical resources such as UpToDate."
