The implementation is following the general idea of training RNNs for LM tasks presented in [2] , but is rather using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [3] for a memory cell, and not the more commonly used LSTM [4]. The implementation presented is based on using keras1 [5]."

      "heading" : "2 Motivation",
      "text" : "Language Modeling is an important task in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. These application include clustering, information retrieval, machine translation, spelling and grammatical errors correction. In general, a language model defined as a function that puts a probability measure over strings drawn from some vocabulary. In this work we consider a RNN based language model task, which aims at predicting the next n-th word in a sequence, given the previous n− 1 words. Put otherwise, finding the word with maximum value for P (wn|w1, ..., wn−1) . The n parameter is the ContextWindowSize argument in the algorithm described further. To maximize the effectiveness and performance of the model we use word embeddings into a continuous vector space. The model of embedding we use is the GloVe [1] model, with dimensionality size equal to 300 or 50. We use both pre-trained2 on 42 billion tokens and 1.9 million vocabulary size, and specifically trained for this work vector models, which we trained on SIGIR-2015 and ICTIR-2015 conferences’ proceedings. The model itself is trained as a RNN, with internal GRU for memorizing the prior sequence of words. It was shown lately, that RNNs outperform most language modeling based tasks [2, 3] when tuned and trained correctly.\n1 https://keras.io/ 2 downloaded from: http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n03 75\n9v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 5\nF eb\n2 01\n7"

      "text" : "In this work we use 300-dimensional and 50-dimensional, GloVe word embeddings. In order to embed the words in a vector space, GloVe model is trained by examining word co-occurrence matrix Xij within a huge text corpus. Despite the huge size of the Common Crawl corpus, some words may not exist with the embeddings, so we set these words to random vectors, and use the same embeddings consistently if we encounter the same unseen word again in the text. The RNN is further trained to predict the next word in its embedding form, that is, predicts the next n-dimensional vector, given the ContextWindowSize previous words. We divide the TextF ile into 70% and 30% for training and testing purposes."

      "heading" : "5 Detailed Explanation",
      "text" : "As stated earlier, GloVe model is trained by examining word co-occurrence matrix of two words i and j: Xij within a huge text corpus. While training the main idea is stating that wiTwj + bi + bj = log(Xij) where wi and wj are the trained vectors, bi and bj are the scalar bias terms associated with words i and j. The most important parts of the training process in GloVe are: 1) A weighting function f for elimination of very common words (like stop words) which add noise and not overweighted, 2) rare words are not overweighted 3) the co-occurrence strength, when modeled as a distance, should be smoothed with a log function. Thus, the final loss function for a GloVe model is J = Σi,j∈V f(Xij)(wi\nTwj+bi+bj−log(Xij))2 where V is a complete vocabulary, and f(x) = (x/xmax)α if x < xmax, and f(x) = 1 otherwise. The model that is used in this work was trained with xmax = 100 and α = 0.75.\nTraining of the RNN is somewhat blurred between supervised and unsupervised techniques. That is, no extra labeled data is given, but part of the input is used as labels. In this unfolded training paradigm, which is illustrated on Figure 1, the output is shifted in a way to create a labels for the input train dataset. In this way the RNN can actually learn to predict a next word (vector) in a sequence."

Consider figure 4. The predicted words’ errors distribution differs even more than in the general case, where the vectors were trained on the general Common-Crawl corpora. That is, the performance of the language model, for the task of word prediction is higher.\nThe time took to train this model is 10 seconds. The time took to compute the predictions for evaluations is 0.04 seconds. 3 implemented on python, with scipy package"

The library that was used is Keras, which in the course of this implementation was based on Theano framework. Instead of Theano, the Google’s Tensorflow can be also used behind the scenes of the Keras in this implementation. In order to train the model yourself, you need to follow the next steps:\n1. Download pre-trained GloVe vectors from http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ 2. Obtain a text to train the model on. In our example we use a Wikipdia\nAnarchism entry. 3. Open and adjust the LM_RNN_GloVe.py file parameters inside the main\nfunction: (a) file_2_tokenize_name (example = \"/Users/macbook/corpora/text2tokenize.txt\") (b) tokenized_file_name (example = \"/Users/macbook/corpora/tokenized2vectors.txt\") (c) glove_vectors_file_name (example = \"/Users/macbook/corpora/glove.42B.300d.txt\") (d) extra_vocab_filename (example = \"/Users/macbook/corpora/extra_vocab.txt\").\nThis argument has also a default value in the get_vector function 4.

      "text" : "In this work we implemented and tested the training of a LM based on RNN. To emphasize the strength of such an approach, we have chosen one of the most\npowerful and prominent techniques for word embeddings - the GloVe embeddings. Although there are other approaches, such as the popular word2vec [8] technique, the GloVe embeddings was shown to outperform it on several tasks [1], partially because of the reasons described in section 5. By training the model with two different settings, one of which is order of magnitude more complex than the other we show the power of such LM. The distributions shown on figures 2 and 3 clearly indicate much smaller error on the task of next word prediction.\nThe main limitation of this implementation is the fixed window size, of the prefix in the LM. This approach does not fully show the full power of RNNbased LM. For dynamic size prefix LM please consider the DyNet [6] package for example. DyNet supports a dynamic computation graph and shares the learned parameters across multiple variable length instances during the training."
