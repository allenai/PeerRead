      "text" : "Clustering or grouping of users or sessions into logically meaningful clusters is a well studied branch of research. Clustering has been formulated in various ways by using algorithms such as K-Means, SOM etc. K-Means partitions the objects into clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances between the objects and the centroids of the clusters. Many algorithms have been proposed to improve implementation of the K-Means algorithm.\n1.1 Literature Review\nBentley (1975) suggested kd-trees to improve triangle inequality to enhance K-Means. Bradley and Fayyad (1998) presented a procedure for computing a refined starting condition that is based on a technique for estimating the modes of a distribution to converge to a better local minimum that can be coupled with scalable clustering algorithms. A Kernel-Means algorithm was established by Scholkops in 1998 that maps data points from the input space to a feature space through a non linear transformation minimizing the clustering error in feature space. Samet (1999) devised R-Trees which were not appropriate for problems with high dimensions.\nA partial distance algorithm (PDA) had been proposed in 2000 which allows termination of the distance calculation at an early stage for better results. In 2002 Dhillon suggested refining clusters in high dimensional text data by combining the first variation principal and spherical KMeans. Elkan in 2003 suggested the use of triangle inequality to accelerate K-Means. Refinement of clusters from K-Means with Ant Colony Optimization was suggested by Mary, Raja in 2005. In 2010 refinement of web usage data clustering from K-Means with Genetic Algorithm was suggested by N. Sujatha and K. Iyakutty and in 2011 by Prabha, Saranya. Various initialization methods such as Binary Splitting was reviewed together with several other initialization techniques and compared with KKZ. Multilevel refinement schemes were used for refining and improving the clusters produced by hierarchical agglomerative clustering by Karypis. Self Organizing Feature Maps (SOM) is a type of Artificial Neural Network that is trained using Unsupervised Learning which helps in visualizing high dimensional data into low dimensional data. Researchers have contributed to the improvement of various SOM quality measures such as quantization error, topographic product, topographic error, trustworthiness and neighborhood preservation. The researchers have contributed only to accelerate the algorithms; there is not much contribution in refinement of clusters. In this paper we try to refine the original clusters generated by SOM and K-Means algorithms. We proposed a Knockout Refinement Algorithm (KRA) to refine original clusters using a contingency table to compute dissimilarity among sessions in clusters and eliminating sessions with a higher count of dissimilarity. We then calculate the Davies Bouldin (DB) index, Dunn’s Index, Precision, Recall and F-Measure for the original and refined clusters.\n1.2 Standard K-Means Algorithm\nK-means works using the following steps: 1. Place K objects points into the space that are to\nbe clustered by choosing the initial value of K. Object points represent centroids of initial groups chosen.\n2. Assign each object point to the group that has the closest Centroids.\n3. Re-compute the positions of the K centroids and continue till all object points have been assigned.\n4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until the centroids do not change. This produces a separation of the object points into groups from which the metric to be minimized can be calculated.\nThe algorithm aims to minimize an objective function as in Eq. (1)\nJ = ∑ ∑ ||xi(j)i 1j 1 − cj||2 (1) Where, ║ ( ) − ║2 is a chosen distance measure between a data point and the cluster centre. It indicates the distance of the n data points from their respective cluster centers.\n1.3 Standard SOM Algorithm\n1. Assign random values to the weight vectors of a neuron. 2. Provide an input vector to the network. 3. Traverse each node in the network\na) Find similarity between the input vector and the network’s node’s weight vector using Euclidean Distance.\nb) Find the node that produces the smallest distance which is assigned as the Best Matching Unit (BMU).\n4. Update the nodes in the neighborhood of the BMU by changing the weights using Eq. (2):\n( + ) = ( ) + ( ) ( )( ( ) − ( )) (2) Where,\n t keeps an account of the iteration number  λ is the iteration range  Wv is the current weight vector  D is the target input  Θ(t) is the Gaussian neighborhood function  α(t) is learning rate due to time\n5. Increment t and repeat from step 2 while t< λ.\n1.4 Metrics\n1.4.1 Davies Bouldin Index\nThis index aims to identify sets of clusters that are compact and well separated. The Davies-Bouldin index is defined as in Eq. (3):\n= / ∑ max [ ( ) ( )( , ) ]1 (3) Were K denotes the number of clusters, , are cluster labels, iam(C ) and iam(C ) are the diameters of the clusters C and C , (C , C ) is the average distance between the clusters. Smaller values of average similarity between each cluster and its most similar one indicate a “better” clustering solution.\n1.4.2 Dunn’s Index\nThis index aims at expecting a large distance between the clusters and an expected small diameter of the cluster. The index is defined as in Eq. (4):\n= m n 1….. m n 1……. ( , ) max 1…… ( ) (4) Here ( , ) is to compute the dissimilarity between two clusters defined as in Eq. (5):\n( , ) = m n ∈ , ∈ ( , ) (5) And diam(c) is the diameter of the cluster that defines the maximum distance between two points in a cluster. A large value of Dunn’s index indicates compact and well separated clusters.\n1.4.3 F-Measure, Precision And Recall\nF-measure combines the precision and recall concepts from information retrieval. We then calculate the recall and precision of that cluster for each class as: ll( , ) = x / x\nAndon( , ) = x / x Were x is the number of objects of class that are in cluster , x is the number of objects in cluster , and x , is the number of objects in class . Precision and Recall are measures that help to evaluate the quality of a set of retrieved documents. The – of cluster and class is given by the following Eq. (6):\nF ( , ) = 2 * ll( , ) ( , ) / ( , ) + ( , ) (6)\nThe – values are within the interval [0, 1] and larger values indicate higher clustering quality."

      "text" : "The raw web log file we used for the experiment contained 5999 web requests that can be found at http://www.vtsns.edu.rs/maja/vtsnsNov16 containing information like date/time of request, hit type, page, hostname, referrer, server domain, authenticated user, server response, page views, size etc. For preparing the web log data for the mining process, it needs to be cleared of irrelevant requests; and transformed to a format that can be fed into the clustering algorithm. For Pre-Processing and creation of sessions a tool called Sawmill (Version 7.0), developed by Flower fire Inc. has been used. Sawmill computes session information by tracking the page, date/time, and visitor id for each page view. When a session view is requested, it processes all of these page views at the time of the request. Sawmill groups the hits into initial sessions based on the visitor id by assuming that each visitor contributes to a session. In the next step sorting by time is performed for a click-by-click record of each visitor. A session timeout interval of 30 minutes is considered for generating final sessions and sessions longer than 2 hours are eliminated. Using the Sawmill tool on our web log data led to the creation of sessions and 110\nunique URLs. 72.9% of the total sessions were exported into a .csv format with the help of scripts in tcl language as rest of the sessions had only either one or two page views.\nFurther we optimized our matrix and 59.1% of the sessions and 43 unique URLs were used for experimentation. The optimization was performed on the basis of sessions having less than 3 page views and pages that were viewed 5 or less than 5 times have been removed. The optimized matrix was used for clustering using the Self-Organizing Feature Maps and K-Means algorithms. We used the Spice-SOM tool and SPSS software for implementation of the respective algorithms. Applying the two algorithms we can see that clusters with similarity among sessions have been obtained and can be used for prediction of pages to a user of similar interests. Clusters of sizes 10, 15 and 20 were generated using both the techniques of K-Means and SOM. Apply KRA to refine the original clusters. The quality of obtained clusters is evaluated using the Davies Bouldin and Dunn’s quality measure along with external quality measures such as Precision, Recall and F-Measure. The clusters are listed as Original Clusters (OC) on which we shall apply our proposed Knockout Refinement Algorithm (KRA)."

      "text" : "Where, Dissimilarity can be computed using contingency table which is a 2 by 2 matrix between two sessions.\nWhere q is the number of variables that equal 1 for both i and j sessions, r is the number of variables that equal 1 for session i but that are equal to 0 for session j, s is the number of variables that equal 0 for session i and equal 1 for session j and t is the number of variables that equal 0 for sessions i and j. In this case the factor t is unimportant and is ignored to compute the dissimilarity. The dissimilarity for all sessions is computed as in equation 7:\n, = ∑ + + +1≠ (7) The above computation is applied to every pair of sessions that generates a Symmetric Dissimilarity Matrix (SDM) as follows:\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S1 0 d(S1, S2) d(S1,S3) d(S1,S4) S2 d(S2, S1) 0 d(S2, S3) d(S2,S4) S3 d(S3, S1) d(S3,S2) 0 d(S3,S4) S4 d(S4, S1) d(S4, S2) d(S4, S3) 0\nFor refinement using the above Symmetric Dissimilarity Matrix (SDM) and using a threshold value of 0.3 session pairs are counted and those sessions are removed from the cluster whose count values are greater than 2. Performing the above computation we get refined clusters."

The proposed algorithm (KRA) is tested in the educational domain and results show that it generates better quality clusters in terms of improved metric values.",
