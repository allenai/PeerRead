      "text" : "Using cognitive mapping concepts for DEM registration, has evolved from this basic idea of using the mapping between the space to objects and defining their relationships to form the basic landmarks that need to be marked, stored and manipulated in and about the environment or other candidate environments, namely, in our case, the DEMs. The progressive two-level encapsulation of methods of geo-spatial cognition includes landmark knowledge and layout knowledge and can be useful for DEM registration. Space-based approach, that emphasizes on explicit extent of the environment under consideration, and object-based approach, that emphasizes on the relationships between objects in the local environment being the two paradigms of cognitive mapping can be methodically integrated in this three-architecture for DEM registration. Initially, P-model based segmentation is performed followed by landmark formation for contextual mapping that uses contextual pyramid formation. Apart from landmarks being used for registration key-point finding, Euclidean distance based deformation calculation has been used for transformation and change detection.\nInitially, P-model based segmentation is performed followed by landmark formation for contextual mapping that uses contextual pyramid formation. Landmarks have been categorized to belong to either being flat-plain areas without much variation in the land heights; peaks that can be found when there is gradual increase in height as compared to the flat areas; valleys, marked with gradual decrease in the height seen in DEM; and finally, ripple areas with very shallow crests and nadirs. For the final storage of co-registered DEMs, fractal based compression has been found to give good results in terms of space and computation requirements.\nIn this paper, an attempt has been made to implement DEM-DEM registration based on human spatial cognition method of recollection.

INTRODUCTION DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data files consist of only the elevation or height values of the terrain, covering a specified area in a discreet grid-like 3-D space of the particular surface in consideration. DEMs can be useful for extracting and visualization of terrain parameters, cartographic map generation and updation, modeling water flow or mass movement amongst others [26], [27], [32].\nDEM registration, in general, is a method of overlaying two or more DEMs, or a map. DEM registration is important as it allows for seamless integration of DEMs the same place which may be represented in different orientation, at different times, or may have been processed using different resolutions. Most methods are used for image registration in general that have been emulated in [48 - 52].There are only a handful of methods for DEM registration most of which are for DEMto-topographical map or DEM-to-Remote Sensed Image registration. DEM-toDEM registration is elusive because of the difficulties of finding feature points or control points required for matching and evaluation and error analysis [30]. Human spatial cognition is an interdisciplinary research area in cognitive science and encompasses some of these theoretic and technologic methods of acquiring, managing, visualization, communication and service of geospatial knowledge etc. Route establishment and way-finding typically requires planning and the ability to stay oriented while moving [17], mostly incorporated with the usage of ‘landmarks’ or ‘key-reference-points’. Using cognitive mapping concept for DEM registration has evolved from this basic idea of using the mapping between the space to objects and defining their relationships to form the basic landmarks that need to be acquired and manipulated in and about the environment and route-finding in adjacent or other candidate environment, in our case DEMs. Landmarks or ‘key-reference-points’ serve as anchor points to entertain local environments in one’s cognitive maps and such a method of equation of existence of certain landmarks in one map to other will serve as a complete route finding and for the purpose of registration of these entities. Further on, if learning-based systems were to be used, it would ensure that a repeated encounter with prominent landmarks, so identified, would make the system much faster for registration of DEMs containing such related objects. The basic 2-tier geo-spatial cognition entails landmark knowledge and layout, considering the content it expresses [17]. This progressive encapsulation method can be useful for DEM registration where-in the landmarks or key-feature-points and their subordinate-points may be used for depicting the three-tier architecture for making the registration process much robust as well as well-defined. Two paradigms of cognitive mapping exist: space-based approach, emphasizing on explicit extent of the environment under consideration, and object-based approach, emphasizing on the relationships between objects in the local environment [20]. Such paradigms can be methodically integrated in this threearchitecture for DEM registration. In this paper, an attempt has been made to implement DEM-DEM registration based human spatial cognition method of way-finding and recollection. This may further be extended for DEM-to-topographic map and DEM-to-remote sensed image registration. Also route finding using the landmarks have been attempted. Landmarks may be seen to belong to four categories in DEMs: flat -plain areas without much variation in the land heights; peak formation with gradual increase in height as compared to the flat areas; valley formation with gradual decrease in the height seen in DEM; ripples with very shallow crests and nadirs. The landmark type formation works on the assumption of certain threshold values used, the values of which may be changed if the number of landmarks found is not adequate for a given DEM. DEM registration between two DEMs, say DEMA and DEMB has been implemented in a three fold algorithm. Firstly designating and storing the landmarks. These have been formed by using pyramid manner of calculation.\nSecondly, matching the various landmarks based on their types. Finally, after orientation determination of the candidate DEM with respect to the reference DEM, registration of both the DEMs is performed. If landmarks cannot be formed, contours have been used for anchor point detection. Route-finding or way-finding between two points in a given single DEM or in multiple DEMs ( wherein say point A lies in DEMA and point B lies in DEMB) have been implemented by first registering the DEM if points lie in different DEMs and then retrieving the landmarks from the knowledgebase followed by path-finding and route depiction The remainder of the paper is organized in the following manner: Section II contains the various related terms used in the work. Section III presents our proposed methodology for digital elevation model registration using cognitive method by landmark detection and inexact graph matching and further on, route finding between given two points while Section IV presents the experimental results for both the registration process as well as route-finding method. In Section V we have summarized the literature presented and also outlined our future work.\n2. PRESENT STATE OF THE ART DEM registration is important as it allows for seamless integration of DEMs of the same locality which may have been represented in different orientation, or may have been processed using different resolutions. Most DEM registration methods include DEM-to-topographical map registration or DEM-to-Remote Sensed Images registration and have evolved from methods used for generation and mosaicing of DEMs [33], [35]. There are only a handful of methods for DEM-to-DEM registration. DEM-to-DEM registration is elusive because of the difficulties of finding feature points or control points required for matching and evaluation and error analysis of the techniques so used. Digital elevation models present the bare earth height model. Among the enumerable applications, the generic applications of DEM include - extracting terrain parameters, cartographic map generation and updation, modeling water flow or mass movement (say, avalanches and landslides), creation of relief maps, rendering of 3D visualizations including flight planning, creation of physical models, rectification of aerial photography or satellite imagery, terrain analyses in geomorphology and physical geography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), engineering and infrastructure design, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), line-ofsight analysis, precision farming and forestry, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). DEM's are also utilized in support of the pre-planning and lay-out of corridor surveys, seismic line locations, construction activities, etc [26],[27], [32].DEMs may be illustrated as either depiction of height values only or a 3D view of these mappings. A comparison of the various methods involving elevation models is presented in\nTable 5. It also includes comparison to our presented work. These papers include comparison from [26] - [28], [30], [31], [33] - [41].\nThe methods studied above for DEM-with-DEM fusion or DEM-with-other images, suffer from drawbacks like time and complexity intensive, lack in error matrix evaluation, applicability to only a few chosen images of particular resolution or types amongst other. Also, none prove to be suitable for different\nresolution DEMs. DEM-to-DEM registration is elusive because of the difficulties of finding feature points or control points required for matching and evaluation and error analysis [30].The study performed for this paper proposes a novel method for DEM-to-DEM registration. Using cognitive mapping concept for DEM registration has evolved from this basic idea of using the mapping between the space to objects and defining their relationships to form the basic landmarks that need to be acquired and manipulated in and about the environment and routefinding in adjacent or other candidate environment, in our case DEMs. Landmarks or ‘key-reference-points’ serve as anchor points to entertain local environments in one’s cognitive maps and such a method of equation of existence of certain landmarks in one map to other will serve as a complete route finding and for the purpose of registration of these entities. Further on, if learning-based systems were to be used, it would ensure that a repeated encounter with prominent landmarks would make the system much faster for registration of DEMs containing such related objects. In this paper, an attempt has been made to implement DEM-DEM registration based human spatial cognition method of way-finding and recollection. This may further be extended for DEM-to-topographic map and DEM-to-remote sensed image registration.\n3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY DEM-to-DEM registration has been attempted in this work. Cognitive map concept has been used for DEM registration due to its inherent relationship to marking or forming landmarks for identification in the active environment. Two paradigms of cognitive mapping: space-based approach, emphasizing on explicit extent of the environment under consideration, and object-based approach, emphasizing on the relationships between objects in the local environment, exist [20]. Orientation and distance finding may not be in exact metric terms, rather in semantic terms of number of hops of smaller landmarks, etc [12]. The notion of key-reference-point can be successfully used for landmark forming and storing in the DEMs considered which form the basis for their registration. If supervised-learning system could be adopted, repeated detection of the same landmarks would make the system more robust and faster for registration. Spatial cognition perception includes attributes like locations, separation and connection, size, directions, distances, shapes, patterns and movements. It allows cognitive agents to act and interact in space intelligently and to communicate about spatial environments in meaningful ways. Cognitive mapping and geospatial visualization use the cognitive behavior that has been vastly studied [1] – [6], [15] - [18], [21]. The cognition of geo-space can be divided as a progressive process into landmark knowledge, route knowledge and layout knowledge - three levels, considering the content it expresses [17]. Cognitive mapping of such system basically works in three stages or key assertions. Firstly, understanding or knowing the work space through contrast and similarity, i.e. what is the work space or area? Secondly, understanding of the problem or application requirements, i.e. what is to be done and defining the problem space. And thirdly, for seeking solutions of the defined space by defining hierarchical constructs. Some of these constructs may be depicted to be super-ordinate to others, whereas some may be deemed to be of the same category, like those forming an organizational design.\nFor our working, we have categorized the landmarks as per their prominent geographical feature. They are (i) flat or plain areas – areas without much variation in their height; (ii) peak – area with gradual increase in the pyramid formation; (iii) valley – areas with gradual decrease in the height found through pyramid calculations; (iv) and ripple areas – like sand dunes / small hillocks with very shallow crests and nadirs. These groupings have been done with the aid of threshold values. The landmark type formation works on the assumption of certain threshold values used, the values of which may be changed if the number of landmarks found is not adequate for a given DEM. DEM registration between two DEMs, say DEMref and DEMcand, reference and candidate DEMs respectively, have been implemented in a three fold algorithm. Firstly designating and storing the landmarks. These have been formed by using pyramid manner of calculation. Secondly, matching the various landmarks based on their types. Finally, after orientation determination of the candidate DEM with respect to the reference DEM, registration of both the DEMs is performed. If landmarks cannot be formed, contours have been used for anchor point detection.\nAlgorithm DEM_registration(DEMref, DEMcand, DEMregistered) Input: Two DEMs namely, reference DEM, and candidate DEM - DEMref, DEMcand. Output: registered DEM data file - DEMregistered. Step 1: Preprocessing & p-model based segmentation Step 2 Landmark detection based on the contextual pyramid formation. This step uses cognitive-pyramid formation for extraction of contextual information. This classification may be extended using fuzzy classification techniques as well. Step 3: Classify landmarks, form landmark-based graphs and insert into landmark knowledge base. The above 3 steps are followed only if any or both the DEMs to be registered are not already present in the knowledgebase. Step 4: Find the maximum matched sub-graph Step 5: find orientation and deformations between the maximum matched subgraphs. Step 6: match landmark graphs based on sub-graph matching Step 7: Register the candidate and reference DEMs. Certain preprocessing steps to landmark detection have been performed. P-model based segmentation has been shown to give better results as compared to simple morphology based segmentation. These segments are then fed to the fuzzy cmeans based contextual pyramid forming engine to perform contextual pyramidbased landmark formation and detection. P-algorithm is a modification of watershed and then waterfall models that are used for segmentation. The difference is in the fact that in P algorithm, all the initial contours of the given signal are compared, at each hierarchical level, to the hierarchical image. Also, in P algorithm, not only the contours inside potential maxima-islands but also, the contours embedded in catchment basins are considered. This algorithm is used for its pyramid and hierarchical structure kind of property as the signal structure could be classified and used as per their two external categories of one corresponding to a classical mosaic structure where the\nlower levels of hierarchy may be embedded in to their corresponding higher ones and secondly, the signal structure made of maxima-islands. The landmark type formation works on the assumption of certain threshold values used. These values may be changed if the number of landmarks found is not adequate for a given DEM. Contour lines and graph node have been used as landmarks. These have been formed based on contextual pixel classification. Contextual classifiers and contextual re-classifiers have been used to form the landmarks and the contour points. Such calculations need to be done for all the candidates and the reference DEMs used for registration purpose. The Graph Isomorphism problem (GI) tests whether two given graphs are isomorphic or not. Various details have been dealt by authors in [42] - [44], [46] - [47]. If there are a large number of graphs, subgraph query [44], may be shown as one of the most fundamental procedures in managing graphs and may be used for querying for patterns from large networks. Since in the proposed algorithm, the graphs of each landmark category may or may not contain the same number of nodes in corresponding reference and candidate DEMs, they would be considered as cases for the inexact graph matching. For such class of problems, exact isomorphism, may or may not be found. However, the aim would be to find the best possible matching [46] with maximum number of nodes of the candidate DEM matching to those of reference DEM. This class of problem would be applied for the cases wherein if the set of vertices for candidate DEM is defined as VC and the set of vertices for the reference DEM is said to be VR, then the matching would be performed for cases |VM| < | VR| and separately for | VR| <|VM|, giving rise to the need for solution through sub-graph matching. For such cases, dummy nodes have been considered to complete the number of nodes, for matching purpose, where ever lesser number of nodes was found [46]. This gives rise to the position-oriented graphs. The position relates to the orientation of the matched sub-graph and is used for finding global transformation. After registration, for effective storage, fractal based compression has been used.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS & DISCUSSION\nFor our experiments, we have used DEMs of different places. Each set has been so chosen that there are some common areas so that registration would result in the display the common as well the disparity between the DEMs considered. For computation of the moving concentric window for pyramid-based computation, increasing the concentric window size beyond the computed windows do not yield any new information along with the analysis becoming unnecessarily computationally complex, the window size was restricted to 10 x 10. Every DEM is considered to be having at least 3 major landmarks of the same class. If such major landmarks are not being able to be formed, the initial threshold levels are readjusted.\nRandom sets of DEMs were chosen for experimentation. Their resolution and related data are shown in Table I. The proposed technique was implemented and tested on 5 sets of DEMs each set containing 5 reference and 5 candidate DEMs, making a total of 25 DEMs.\nIn the sets used for experimentation, we have also considered the % of common area and the number of landmarks as shown in table II. As seen from the below shown table, if the common area is approximately less than 60-65 % of common area, the number of landmarks that could be used for the further tasks of registration is insufficient and hence are not used. For better sets of results, the actual % of common area used for registration is in the range above 70%.\nFrom the considered data set, one from each class of set that have been used and their registered data, are shown below. One set of reference, candidate, and their corresponding registered DEMs have been shown. In Figure 1, the third column shows the Output data of registration. These sets belong to the range of 70% to 95% common area.\nThe below shown table, Table III gives the counts of the various landmark types Peak, valley, flat-plain and ripple found after being processed for the DEM sets shown in the above fig 1.\nThe registration process must eventually be evaluated against a method to satisfy the similarity measure between the candidate DEM and registered DEM. Performance of the registration method, so proposed, has been evaluated by the most simplest and easily calculable maximum correlation coefficient. The whole candidate DEM may or may not be registered to the reference DEM, ie., exact and complete matching and registration may not be possible. Therefore, to accommodate the inexact matching and registration process’s evaluation, the mutual information of the common area found in the registered DEM, and candidate DEM and the reference DEM’s have been compared.\nThe method presented in this paper has been tested using Correlation Coefficient similarity metric that gives an easy indication of its merit. As shown from the result set of table IV, the technique is found to give good results for registration.\nThe proposed method also has the merits as compared to other methods by having more comprehensible and logical anchor-point detection method, ease with postdisaster registration of DEMs. Also, DEM specification is not a constraint for the proposed technique. And multi-modal and multi-temporal DEMs can be easily registered using the said approach. Though having high time and computation complexity, the model is much robust as compared to other feature finding techniques.\nRobustness of the proposed algorithm is checked by introducing Gaussian noise of random nature of range -10 to +10 and zero mean and then its performance are evaluated, as shown in Table V. The graph shown in Figure 2 confirms the proposed theory that that the proposed algorithm performs better as compared to the three commonly used methods for registration namely, transform domainbased registration, KLD-based registration, and iterative closest point-based registration.\nThe below shown table, table VI shows the comparison of various similarity measures used for evaluation of performance showing for various amounts of common areas for various sets of DEMs used for registration.\nTable VII shows the comparison of various compression methods used for compressing the registered file. The properties of compression ratio and peak signal-to-noise ratio between before compression and after decompression have been used for comparison. The graph for the same is shown in fig 3.\nComparison with some of the other methods proposed by various other authors have also been done. This is emulated in table VIII.\nThe major problems arise due to the border data which cannot be fully used for finding the landmarks as these are based on contextual pyramid formation which require larger bases. As the number of iterations grows, the base of the contextual pyramid also grows. Hence, the initial time complexity for the complete registration process is high. However, as shown from the comparisons made above once the DEM is included in the landmark knowledge base, its recomputation time for registration reduces drastically.\nThe major problems arise due to the border data which cannot be fully used for finding the landmarks as these are based on contextual pyramid formation which require larger bases.

CONCLUSION & FUTURE RESEARCH\nIf a cluster of similar landmark nodes are found, these can be grouped together by virtue of their proximity, and such cluster may be considered as a major landmark, and the centroid of this cluster would then be constructed and marked as a single landmark rather than a group of similar-landmark-nodes. The vicinity may be decided based on the proximity to the nearest-similar landmarks. If there are more than 3 same class landmarks within a radii threshold distance, they, together, would be grouped together to form a major landmark.\nThe basic steps of geo-spatial cognition entails three levels of knowledge - landmark knowledge, route knowledge and layout knowledge - considering the content it expresses. This progressive encapsulation method can be useful for DEM registration where-in the landmarks or key-feature-points and their subordinate-points may be used for depicting the three-tier architecture for making the registration process much robust as well as well-defined. In this paper, an attempt has been made to implement DEM-DEM registration based human spatial cognition method of recollection. Further on, if learning-based systems would ensure that a repeated encounter with prominent landmarks would make the system much faster for registration of DEMs containing such related objects.\nFor our experimentation, landmarks have been categorized as flat-plain areas, peaks, valleys, and ripple areas based on their inherent characteristics of elevations. The landmark type formation works on the assumption of certain threshold values used, the values of which may be changed if the number of landmarks found is not adequate for a given DEM. The first stage consists of initial finding and classification of the various landmarks found in each of the DEMs. This forms the landmark knowledge-base. For registration, the reference and candidate DEMs are then compared based on the various landmarks found. The matching process is further sustained by the characteristics of the landmarks. Partial and non-exact graph matching is used for the above requirement.\nThe experiment has involved five sets of reference and candidate DEMs to be registered, each set having 5 test data sets i.e., five reference and five candidate DEMs, making a total of 25 DEMs. Random sets of DEMs were chosen for experimentation. As indicated by the normalized mutual information values, the algorithms performance is found to be adequately good in terms of the final output. Experimentation was also performed for various percentages of common area for evaluating the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Robustness measure based on CC and MI values of some of the common methods after adding Gaussian Noise to check the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Comparison with some of the other methods proposed by various other authors was also discussed."

    "abstractText" : "Image Registration implies mapping images having varying orientation, multi-modal or multi-temporal images to map to one coordinate system. Digital Elevation models (DEM) are images having terrain information embedded into them. DEM-to-DEM registration incorporate registration of DEMs having different orientation, may have been mapped at different times, or may have been processed using different resolutions. Though very important only a handful of methods for DEM registration exist, most of which are for DEM-to-topographical map or DEMto-Remote Sensed Image registration. Using cognitive mapping concepts for DEM registration, has evolved from this basic idea of using the mapping between the space to objects and defining their relationships to form the basic landmarks that need to be marked, stored and manipulated in and about the environment or other candidate environments, namely, in our case, the DEMs. The progressive two-level encapsulation of methods of geo-spatial cognition includes landmark knowledge and layout knowledge and can be useful for DEM registration. Space-based approach, that emphasizes on explicit extent of the environment under consideration, and object-based approach, that emphasizes on the relationships between objects in the local environment being the two paradigms of cognitive mapping can be methodically integrated in this three-architecture for DEM registration. Initially, P-model based segmentation is performed followed by landmark formation for contextual mapping that uses contextual pyramid formation. Apart from landmarks being used for registration key-point finding, Euclidean distance based deformation calculation has been used for transformation and change detection. Initially, P-model based segmentation is performed followed by landmark formation for contextual mapping that uses contextual pyramid formation. Landmarks have been categorized to belong to either being flat-plain areas without much variation in the land heights; peaks that can be found when there is gradual increase in height as compared to the flat areas; valleys, marked with gradual decrease in the height seen in DEM; and finally, ripple areas with very shallow crests and nadirs. For the final storage of co-registered DEMs, fractal based compression has been found to give good results in terms of space and computation requirements. In this paper, an attempt has been made to implement DEM-DEM registration based on human spatial cognition method of recollection. This method may further be extended for DEM-totopographic map and DEM-to-remote sensed image registration. Experimental results further cement the fact that DEM registration may be effectively done using the proposed method.",
