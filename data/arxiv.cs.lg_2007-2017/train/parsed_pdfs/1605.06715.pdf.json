      "text" : "The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a wellknown undirected generative model with state-of-the-art performance on various problems. It serves as a building block for many deep generative models, such as the Deep Belief Network (DBN) (Hinton et al., 2006) and the Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009). Other variants of the RBM have been used for modeling discrete time series data, such as human motion (Taylor et al., 2006), videos (Sutskever et al., 2009), and weather prediction (Mittelman et al., 2014). Among these variants is the Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine\nProceedings of the 33 rd International Conference on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016. JMLR: W&CP volume 48. Copyright 2016 by the author(s).\n(CRBM) (Taylor et al., 2006), where the hidden and visible states at the current time step are dependent on directed connections from observations at the last few time steps. Most RBM-based models use Contrastive Divergence (CD) (Hinton, 2002) for efficient learning.\nRecently, there has been a surging interest in deep directed generative models, with applications in both static and dynamic data. In particular, advances in variational methods (Mnih & Gregor, 2014; Kingma & Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) have yielded scalable and efficient learning and inference for such models, avoiding poor inference speed caused by the “explaining away” effect (Hinton et al., 2006). One directed graphical model that is related to the RBM is the Sigmoid Belief Network (SBN) (Neal, 1992).\nThe Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network (TSBN)(Gan et al., 2015c) is a fully directed generative model for discretely sampled time-series data, defined by a sequential stack of SBNs. The hidden state for each SBN is inherited from the states of the previous SBNs in the sequence. The TSBN can be regarded as a generalization of Hidden Markov Models (HMM), with compact hidden state representations, or as a generalization of Linear Dynamical Systems (LDS), characterized by non-linear dynamics. The model can be utilized to analyze many kinds of data, e.g., binary, realvalued, and counts, and has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in many tasks.\nHowever, the TSBN exhibits certain limitations, in that it does not discriminate different types of sequences when training, nor does it utilize (often available) side information during generation. For example, in the case of modeling human motion, the TSBN does not regard “walking” and “running” as different motions, and the style of generated motions is not controlled. To allow for conditional generation, we first propose a straightforward modification of the TSBN, introducing three-way tensors for weight transitions, from which weight matrices for the TSBN are extracted according to the side information provided. We then adopt ideas from Taylor & Hinton (2009), where the\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n06 71\n5v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 2\nM ay\n2 01\nthree-way weight tensor is factored into the multiplication of matrices, effectively reducing the model parameters. In our case, factoring is not directly imposed on the tensor parameters but over the style-dependent transition matrices, which provides a more-compact representation of the transitions, where sequences with different attributes are modeled by a shared set of parameters. The model is able to capture the subtle similarities across these sequences, while still preserving discriminative attributes. Experiments show that the factored model yields better prediction performance than its non-factored counterpart.\nFor cases where side information is not available for the entire training set, we propose a framework for semisupervised learning, inspired by Kingma et al. (2014), to infer that information from observations (e.g., by using a classifier to infer the motion style), while simultaneously training a generative model.\nThe principal contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) A fully directed deep generative model for sequential data is developed, that permits fast conditional generation of synthetic data, and controlled transitioning and blending of different styles. (ii) A new factoring method is proposed, that reduces the number of parameters and improves performance across multiple sequences. (iii) A general framework for semi-supervised learning is constituted, allowing robust sequence classification. (iv) A new recognition model with factored parameters is utilized to perform scalable learning and inference."

Assume that each observation is real-valued, and the t-th time step is denoted vt ∈ RM .

Specifically, in the HMM, each hidden state is represented as a one-hotencoded vector of length J , while the hidden states of the TSBN are encoded by length-J binary vectors, which can express 2J different states. Compared with the Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TRBM) (Sutskever & Hinton, 2007), the TSBN is fully directed, allowing fast sequence generation from the inferred model."

If the number of factors is comparable to that of other terms (i.e., J and M ), this reduces the number of parameters needed for all the W(y) from J ·M · S to (J + M + S) · F , or equivalently, O(N3) to O(N2). In practice, we factor all parameters except for W2 to improve generation by allowing a more flexible transition from ht to vt across multiple styles. 2 We call this model the Factored Conditional Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network (FCTSBN)."

We propose a framework for semisupervised learning based on FCTSBN, with the capacity to simutaneously train a generative model and a classifier from labeled and unlabeled data.\nSpecifically, assume that the side information is generated from the prior distribution pθ(Y;π) parametrized by π (which can be a multinomial distribution if yt are labels), then the generative model can be described as\npθ(V,H,Y) = pθ(Y;π) · pθ(V,H|Y) (12)\nwhere pθ(V,H|Y) is the conditional generative model described in (7).

According to the variational principle (Jordan et al., 1999), we construct a lower bound on the marginal log-likelihood with the following form\nL(V|Y,θ,φ) = J (qφ(H|V,Y), pθ(V,H|Y)) (13)\nwhereJ (q, p) = Eq[log p−log q] is used to save space, and qφ(H|V,Y) is the recognition model.

      "text" : "Probabilistic models for sequential data in the deep learning literature can be roughly divided into two categories. The first category includes generative models without latent variables, which rely on use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Sutskever et al., 2011; Graves, 2013; Chung et al., 2015a). The second category contains generative models with latent variables, which can be further divided into two subcategories: (i) undirected latent variable models, utilizing the RBM as the building block (Taylor et al., 2006; Sutskever & Hinton, 2007; Sutskever et al., 2009; Boulanger-Lewandowski et al., 2012; Mittelman et al., 2014); (ii) directed latent variable models, e.g., extending the variational auto-encoders (Bayer & Osendorfer, 2014; Fabius et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2015b), or utilizing the SBN as the building block (Gan et al., 2015a;b;c).\nAmong this work, the Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (FCRBM) (Taylor & Hinton, 2009) and Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network (TSBN) (Gan et al., 2015c) are most related to the work reported here. However, there exist several key differences. Compared with FCRBM, our proposed model is fully directed, allowing fast generation through ancestral sampling; while in the FCRBM, alternating Gibbs sampling is required to obtain a sample at each time-step. Compared with TSBN, where generation of different styles was purely based on initialization, our model utilizes side information to gate the connections of a TSBN, which makes the model context-sensitive, and permits controlled transitioning and blending (detailed when presenting experiments in Section 5).\nAnother novelty of our model lies in the utilization of a factored three-way tensor to model the multiplicative interactions between side information and sequences. Similar ideas have also been exploited in (Memisevic & Hinton, 2007; Taylor & Hinton, 2009; Sutskever et al., 2011; Kiros et al., 2014a;b). We note that our factoring method is different from the one used in FCRBM. Specifically, in FCRBM, the energy function was factored, while our model factors over the transition parameters, by which we capture the underlying similarities within different sequences, boosting performance.\nMost deep generative models focus on exploring the generative ability (Kingma & Welling, 2014), and little work\n3We use α = 2 · T throughout the experiments, but obtain similar performance for other values of α within [0.1 · T, 4 · T ].\nhas been done on examining the discriminative ability of deep generative models, except Kingma et al. (2014); Li et al. (2015). However, both works are restricted to the application of static data. Our paper is the first to develop a semi-supervised sequence classification method with deep generative models.\nIn terms of inference, the wake-sleep algorithm (Hinton et al., 1995), Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) (Kingma & Welling, 2014) and Neural Variational Inference and Learning (NVIL) (Mnih & Gregor, 2014) are widely studied for training recognition models. We utilize NVIL for scalable inference, and our method is novel in designing a new factored multiplicative recognition model."

Specifically, we consider two datasets: (i) motion sequences performed by subject 35 (Taylor et al., 2006)(mocap2), which contains two types of motions, i.e., walking and running; (ii) motion sequences performed by subject 137 (Taylor & Hinton, 2009)(mocap10), which contains 10 different styles of walking. Both datasets are preprocessed using downsampling and scaling to have zero mean and unit variance. In Section 5.5 and 5.6, we present additional experiments on weather prediction and conditional text generation to further demonstrate the versatility of the proposed model. The weather prediction dataset (Liu et al., 2010) contains monthly observations of time series data of 18 climate agents (data types) over different places in North America.\nThe FCTSBN model with W(y)3 ≡ 0 and W (y) 4 ≡ 0 is denoted Hidden Markov FCTSBN. The deep extension to FCTSBN is abbreviated as dFCTSBN. We use this abbreviation to denote the conditional generative model instead of the semi-supervised model, unless explicitly stated. Furthermore, we allow each observation to be dependent on the hidden and visible states of the previous n time steps, instead of n = 1. We refer to n as the order of the model. The choice of n can be different according to the specific scenario. For mocap2 prediction and mocap10 generation, n is selected to align with previous methods on these tasks; for other prediction tasks, n is chosen to balance between performance and model complexity; for semi-supervised tasks, n = 6 is considered to allow consecutive frames of data to be utilized effectively by the classifier.\nFor CTSBN, the model parameters for weights are initialized by sampling fromN (0, 0.0012I), whereas the bias parameters are initialized as zero. For FCTSBN, the parameters are initialized differently, since the actual initialization value of the weight parameters depends on the product\nof factors. To ensure faster convergence, the initial values Wa, Wb and Wc are sampled fromN (0, 0.012I). We use RMSprop (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) throughout all the experiments. This is a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method that allows the gradients to be adaptively rescaled by a running average of their recent magnitude. The datadependent baseline is implemented with a single-hiddenlayer neural network with 100 tanh units. We update the estimated learning signal with a momentum of 0.9.\nThe prediction of vt given v1:t−1 requires first sampling h1:t−1 from qφ(h1:t−1|v1:t−1,y1:t−1), then calculating the posterior pθ(ht|h1:t−1,v1:t−1,yt) for ht. Given ht, a prediction can be made for vt by sampling from pθ(vt|h1:t,v1:t−1,yt), or by using the expectation of sampled variables. Generating samples, on the other hand, is a similar but relatively easier task, where sequences can be generated through ancestral sampling. A special advantage of the conditional generative model appears when the side information yt changes over time, so that we can generate sequences with style transitions that do not appear in the training data. More details on generating such sequences are discussed in Section 5.4."

      "text" : "One particular advantage of modeling multiple time-series data with one FCTSBN over training several TSBNs for each sequence is that the FCTSBN has a shared hidden representation for all styles, so yt are no longer restricted to a constant value during generation. This flexibility allows generation of sequences that do not appear in the training set, such as transitions between styles, or combinations of multiple styles.\nVideos displaying smooth and efficient style transitions and blending are provided in the supplementary material. Two examples are provided in Figure 6. We also include transitions between walking and running with the generative model trained in Section 5.3. To enable such transition, we transform the side information from one to another using a sigmoid-shaped form as in Figure 5. The entire transition process happens over around 60 frames, which is much faster than the 200-frame transition proposed for FCRBM (Taylor & Hinton, 2009) 5. For style blending, the side information is provided by a convex combination of several one-hot-encoded side information vectors."

We select 25 places in the United States, which are located in a 5 × 5 grid spanning across\n5In practice, a sudden change of labels will result in ”jerky” transitions (Taylor & Hinton, 2009), but we aim to use as few frames as possible during transition.\nmultiple climate regions. The weather data are processed so that for every month in 1990-2002, each place has 17 climate indicator values (e.g., temperature). We use only longitude and latitude as side information.\nOne way of providing yt is by using the geographic information directly, such that yt would be a real-valued vector of length 2 (we call this setting 2d for simplicity). Such representation is oversimplified, since the transition parameters W of a certain location cannot be described as a linear combination of longitude and latitude. Therefore, we consider two other representations of side information. One uses a vector with 10 binary values (10d), which is the concatenation of two one-hot encoded vector of length 5 for longitude and latitude, respectively; the other assumes a one-hot encoded vector of 25, one for each location (25d).\nWe use the monthly climate data from 1990 to 2001 as training set, and the data of 2002 as test set. We consider CTSBN, FCTSBN, and two-layer deep FCTSBN of order n = 6, with 100 hidden variables and 50 factors on each hidden layer. During test time, we predict the weather of every month in 2002 given the information of previous 6 months.\nAverage prediction error of 5 trials with random initializations are provided in Table 2. We observe that the factored model has significantly higher performance than the non-factored CTSBN, since the factored model has shared input-to-factor and factor-to-output parameters, and the factor-to-factor parameters have the potential to capture the correlations among side information at a higher level. Moreover, the performance improves as we increase the dimension of side information, which might be due to the increase of the number of parameters, along with the one-hot embeddings of side information. The 10d model has a significant performance boost compared with the 2d model, while using the 25d model further improves the performance slightly. We also compare our method with the one layer FCRBM model, which has 100 hidden variables and 50 variables for each of the three style factors and features, and achieved better results on the one-layer setting."

We select 4 books (i.e., Napoleon the Little, The Common Law, Mysticism and Logic and The Bible) in the Gutenberg corpus, and use word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) to extract word embeddings, where words with few occurrences are omitted. This preprocessing step provides us with real-valued vectors, which are treated as observations and fit into our current model.\nThe real-valued word vector sequences are trained on a one-layer CTSBN of order 15 and 100 hidden variables. During generation, we clamp each generated value to the nearest possible word vector using cosine similarity. We focus on modeling real-valued sequences, hence the clamping approach is employed, instead of adopting a softmax layer to predict the words directly.\nTable 3 displays the generated samples from the model when provided with the side information of The Bible (B), The Common Law (C) and an even mixture of these two books (BC). As can be seen, our model learns to capture the styles associated with different books. By conditioning on the average of two styles, the model can generate reasonable samples that represent a hybrid of both styles (distinctive words such as<#> and god from B, and application and violence from C), even though such style combinations were not observed during training."

A general framework for semi-supervised sequence classification is also provided, allowing one to train a conditional generative model along with a classifier. Experimental results on several datasets show that the proposed approaches obtain superior predictive performance, boost classification accuracy, and synthesize a large family of sequences.\nWhile we assume side information as a simple vector, it would be interesting to incorporate more structured side information into the model, e.g., utilizing separate style and content components. We are also interested in models that can extract structured properties from side information."

The model is designed by introducing a three-way weight tensor to capture the multiplicative interactions between side information and sequences. The proposed model builds on the Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network (TSBN), a sequential stack of Sigmoid Belief Networks (SBNs). The transition matrices are further factored to reduce the number of parameters and improve generalization. When side information is not available, a general framework for semi-supervised learning based on the proposed model is constituted, allowing robust sequence classification. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-theart predictive and classification performance on sequential data, and has the capacity to synthesize sequences, with controlled style transitioning and blending.",
