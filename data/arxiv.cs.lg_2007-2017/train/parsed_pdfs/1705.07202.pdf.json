      "text" : "In recent years, progress in deep learning has promoted the development of generative models[5, 23, 3, 8, 1] that are able to capture the distributions of high-dimensional dataset and generate new samples. Variational auto-encoder (VAE)[20] is a powerful unsupervised learning framework for deep generative modeling. In VAE, the input data is encoded into latent variables before they are reconstructed by the decoder network. The VAE learns the transformation parameters by optimizing a variational lower bound of the true likelihood. The lower bound consists of two components. The first component is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the approximate posterior and a prior distribution, which is commonly a normal distribution. The second component is the reconstruction loss given a latent variable. The VAE assumes that the output follows a normal distribution given the latent variable, thereby leading to an `2 loss in the objective function. It has been shown that the `2 loss leads to blurry images when the data are drawn from multi-modal distributions.\nTo make the VAE generate high quality images, some approaches have been proposed to improve the decoder network [6, 12, 2]. Since the decoder network is usually implemented with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [15], we can increase the network depth to improve the capacity of decoder networks as in [13, 21, 22]. However, deeper networks can be difficult to optimize. Therefore, we employ the deep residual blocks, which are easy to optimize, to increase the capacity of decoder. By employing residual blocks in the decoder network, the VAE can generate high quality images. However, it still suffers from the effect of `2 loss and thus generates blurry images.\nIn this work, we propose a multi-stage VAE framework to generate high quality images. The key idea of multi-stage VAE is to generate images from coarse to fine. One challenge is that, since the decoder network is trained end-to-end, it is difficult to control the decoder network and make it\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n07 20\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n9 M\nay 2\ngenerate images from coarse to fine. A simple solution is to train two models separately in which the first model generates a coarse image and the second model refines the coarse image. A drawback of this simple approach is that it reduces the efficiency of the model and involves more computational costs. To obtain fine images efficiently, we propose to employ an `2 loss in the middle of the decoder network, thus requiring coarse images to be generated in an intermediate stage of the decoder network. The remaining parts of the encoder network can be considered as a model that takes coarse images as inputs and generates refined versions of them as outputs. Indeed, the second network can be considered as a super-resolution network. Following this interpretation, we can employ any loss functions to refine the images in the super-resolution network[10], thereby overcoming the effect of `2 loss. In this way, we can generate images from coarse to fine and alleviate the effect of `2 loss without introducing extra parameters. Experimental results on the MNIST and CelebA datasets demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage VAE can capture more details and generate sharper images than the original VAE. Some sample results are given in Figure 1"

      "text" : "Variational auto-encoder (VAE) [11] is a generative model that is able to capture the probability distribution over high-dimensional datasets. For image generation tasks, given a dataset X = {x(i)}Ni=1, we wish to learn a distribution function that can capture the dependencies among pixels. To tackle this problem, we can train a distribution model pθ1(x), parameterized by θ1, to approximate the data distribution and optimize the model by maximizing the log likelihood as follows:\nlog pθ1(X) = log pθ1(x (1), . . . , x(N)) = N∑ i=1 log pθ1(x (i)). (1)\nHowever, probability distributions in high-dimensional space are very difficult to model. Thus, a lowdimensional latent variable z is usually introduced. It has been shown in [11] that the latent variable models can be optimized efficiently by maximizing a variational lower bound on the likelihood function as\nlog pθ1(x) ≥ Eqφ(z|x)[log pθ1(x|z)]−DKL[qφ(z|x)|pθ1(z)] = −LV AE , (2)\nwhere LV AE is the loss function we need to minimize in VAE, and qφ(z|x) is an approximate representation of the intractable pθ1(z|x) parameterized by qφ. The output distribution in the first term is often Gaussian as:\npθ1(x|z) = N (x; fθ1(z), σ2I) = C × exp ( − (x− fθ1(z)) 2\n2σ2\n) , (3)\nwhere C is a constant, and fθ1(·) is computed by CNNs [13]. Therefore, the log likelihood can be expressed as:\nlog pθ1(X|z) = N∑ i=1 logC × exp ( − (x (i) − fθ1(z(i)))2 2σ2 ) , (4)\n= N × C − 1 2σ2 N∑ i=1 (x(i) − fθ1(z(i)))2, (5)\nwhereN×C is a constant that is irrelevant to fθ1(·) and can be ignored in optimization. The first term in LV AE is a `2 loss between x and fθ1(z). The second term corresponds to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between qφ(z|x) and pθ1(z). VAE assumes that qφ(z|x) = N (z;µφ(x), ∑ φ(x))\nand pθ(z) = N (z; 0, I). µφ(x) and ∑ φ(x) are also implemented by CNNs. The second term in LV AE can be considered as a prior regularization. Therefore, the loss function of VAE can be written as LV AE = L`2 + Lprior, (6) where\nL`2 = −Eqφ(z|x)[log pθ1(x|z)] = 1\n2σ2 N∑ i=1 (x(i) − fθ1(z(i)))2, (7)\nLprior = DKL[qφ(z|x)|pθ1(z)]. (8)"

      "text" : "VAE has shown promising results in image generation tasks[4, 26, 14]. However, the images generated by VAE are blurry. This is caused by the `2 loss, which is based on the assumption that the data follow a single Gaussian distribution. When samples in dataset have multi-modal distribution, VAE cannot generate images with sharp edges and fine details. In VAE, images are generated by fθ1(·). It is possible to generate better images by using more complex model for fθ1(·). One solution is to employ the autoregressive model [19][24] for decoder function fθ1(·). In the autoregressive model, each pixel is conditioned on previously generated pixels. The autoregressive model increases the dependency between pixels and generates images with fine details. However, since it must generate images pixel by pixel, the prediction procedure of autoregressive model is much slower compared with other generative models such as VAE.\nSince the decoder of VAE is implemented with CNNs, a direct way to generate better images is to employ deeper networks, resulting in increased capacity of the decoder model [21]. The difficulty that deep neural networks facing is the degradation problem. As the network depth increases, the\nperformance of deep networks initially improves and then degrades rapidly. Although deep neural network models with higher capacity usually yield better performance, it is also challenging to optimize them. To efficiently train deep neural networks, the batch normalization method is proposed in Ioffe and Szegedy [9] by reducing internal covariate shift. Another solution is the residual learning framework proposed in He et al. [7], which employs the residual blocks and skip connection to back-propagate the gradients more efficiently in the network. The introduction of skip connection and residual block makes the optimization of deep neural networks more efficient. It is possible to employ deeper neural works on complex tasks. The residual learning framework has already been successfully applied to image recognition, object detection, and image super-resolution. To increase the capacity of decoder in VAE and optimize the model efficiently, we concatenate the original VAE decoder with several residual blocks. The architecture of deep residual VAE is illustrated in Figure 2. Given the original decoder fθ1(z), the deeper decoder networks can be denoted as fθ = fθ2(fθ1(z)), where fθ2(·) corresponds to the residual network. Compared with the original VAE decoder, the deeper decoder networks can capture more details. The loss function of deep residual VAE can be written as: LRSV AE = L`2 + Lprior, (9) where\nL`2 = −Eqφ(z|x)[log pθ1(x|z)] = 1\n2σ2 N∑ i=1 (x(i) − fθ2(fθ1(z(i))))2, (10)\nLprior = DKL[qφ(z|x)|pθ1(z)].

      "text" : "Experiment results in Section 3 show that deep residual VAE can capture more details than the original VAE by adding residual blocks to the decoder network. But the performance of deep residual VAE saturates rapidly as more residual blocks are added. As the depth of decoder network increases, the quality of generated images improves with smaller and smaller margins. This saturation effect is not a surprise as the network still employs `2 loss and thus generates blurry images. On the other hand, it is natural to use a step-by-step procedure to generate high-quality images. Specifically, in image generation, we can generate a coarse image with rough shape and basic colors first and then refine the coarse image to a high quality one. In VAE, the decoder network is trained end-to-end. Thus we cannot control the process of image generation. To make the decoder network generate images step-by-step, we need to divide the decoder network into two components, where the first component generates a coarse image, and the second component refines it to a high quality one. To achieve this, we propose to add a loss function at some location in the decoder network and enforce the network to generate images at that location.\nHere we use two stage deep VAE to illustrate how this idea works. Since in the first stage we only need to generate a coarse image, it is possible for the original VAE to accomplish this using the decode function fθ1(·). Then we need to build a model to refine the coarse images. When we require the sub-network fθ1(·) in the decoder of deep residual VAE to generate a coarse image, the input of fθ2(·) is not some arbitrary intermediate feature maps but a coarse image. In this way, the sub-network fθ2(·) acts as a model to refine the coarse images generated from fθ1(z). The architecture of the proposed multi-stage VAE is illustrated in Figure 3. The loss of the multi-stage VAE can be written as:\nLMSVAE = −Eqφ(z|x)[log pθ(x|z)] +DKL[qφ(z|x)|pθ(z)] + Lrf (x, fθ2(fθ1(z))). (12)\nCompared with deep residual VAE, multi-stage VAE has two cost functions in the decoder network. The cost function of the first stage corresponds to −Eqφ(z|x)[log pθ(x|z)] in the original VAE, and it is used to generate coarse images. The cost function of the second stage corresponds to the third term in Equation 12, and it is used to refine the coarse images. In multi-stage VAE framework, the second network is independent of the VAE model. Therefore, we can employ loss function on Lrf (x, fθ2(fθ1(z))). It also overcomes the effect of `2 loss under the assumption that data have a single Gaussian distribution. By employing different loss functions, the second model can recover more detailed information from blurry images. The LMSVAE can be written as:\nLMSVAE = L`2 + Lprior + Lrf (x, fθ2(fθ1(z))), (13)\nwhere\nLl2 = −Eqφ(z|x)[log pθ1(x|z)] = 1\n2σ2 N∑ i=1 (x(i) − fθ1(z(i)))2, (14)\nLprior = DKL[qφ(z|x)|pθ1(z)]. (15)\nIn addition, generating higher resolution images (e.g., 128×128) is challenging for generative models. In multi-stage VAE, the coarse images generated in the first stage provide additional information and subsequently enables the multi-stage VAE to generate high-resolution images. The idea of tackling complex tasks in a multi-stage manner is also employed by Stack GAN [25]. Stack GAN employs two separate models to generate low-resolution images and high-resolution images, respectively. The two models are trained separately. However, our model divides the decoder network into two components with different loss functions, and both networks are trained jointly."

      "text" : "We employ residual networks in the second stage of our multi-stage VAE to refine the coarse images generated in the first stage. The key idea of the second model is similar to the super-resolution residual net (SRResNet) [16]. In SRResNet, a low-resolution image is fed into a network composed of residual blocks and up-sampling layers. Then an image with high resolution is generated by SRResNet.\nIn multi-stage VAE, we employ a pixel-wise loss function to recover the details between lowresolution images and high-resolution images. Minimizing the pixel-wise loss encourages the model to generate the average of plausible solutions, thus leading to poor perceptual quality [4, 18]. A plausible loss function applied in image super-resolution tasks is the combination of Euclidean distances in feature space and adversarial loss. In fact, our multi-stage VAE framework can work with any plausible super-resolution model by replacing the loss function in Lrf and the model architecture of fθ2(·)."

We can see that at the intermediate location in the decoder network of multi-stage VAE, a blurry image is generated, and it is fed into the residual networks. Through the refined operation of the second network, an image with high quality is generated. Since the whole decoder network of deep residual VAE only contains a single loss function, the generation process suffers from the effect of `2 loss. Therefore, the images generated by deep residual VAE are still blurry.\nFigures 8 and 9 provide some sample images generated by the original VAE, deep residual VAE, and multi-stage VAE when the models are trained on the CelebA and MNIST datasets.

One drawback of VAE is that it generates blurry images due to its Gaussianity assumption and thus `2 loss. To allow the generation of high quality images by VAE, we increase the capacity of decoder network by employing residual blocks and skip connections, which also enable efficient optimization. To overcome the limitation of `2 loss, we propose to generate images in a multi-stage manner from coarse to fine. In the simplest case, the proposed multi-stage VAE divides the decoder into two components in which the second component generates refined images based on the course images generated by the first component. Since the second component is independent of the VAE model, it can employ other loss functions beyond the `2 loss and different model architectures. The proposed framework can be easily generalized to contain more than two components. Experiment results on the MNIST and CelebA datasets demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage VAE can generate sharper images as compared to those from the original VAE.",
