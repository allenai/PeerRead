Recommender systems help customers by presenting products or services that are likely of interest to them based on their preferences, needs, and past buying behaviors. Nowadays, many people use recommender systems in their daily life such as online shopping, reading articles, and watching movies.\nMany of the prominent approaches employed in recommender systems [13] are based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) techniques. The basic idea of these techniques is that people who share similar preferences in the past tend to have similar choices in the future. Many of the most successful CF techniques are based on matrix factorization [13]. They find common factors that can be the underlying reasons for the ratings given by users. For example, in a movie recommender system, these factors can be genre, actors, or director of movies that may affect the rating behavior of users. Matrix factorization techniques not only find these hidden factors, but also learn their importance for each user and how each item satisfies each factor.\nAlthough CF techniques have shown good performance for many applications, the sparsity problem is considered as one of their significant challenges [13]. The sparsity problem arises when the number of items rated by users is insignificant to the total number of items. It happens in many real applications. It is not easy for CF techniques to recommend items with few ratings or to give recommendations to the users with few ratings.\nOne of the approaches employed to address this lack of data is using the information in review text [16, 17]. In many recommender systems, other than the numeric ratings, users can write reviews for the products. Users explain the reasons behind their ratings in text reviews. The reviews contain information which can be used to alleviate sparsity problem. One of the drawbacks of most current CF techniques is that they model users and items just based on the numeric ratings provided by users and ignore the abundant information existed in the review text. Recently, some studies [17] [16] have shown that using review text can improve the prediction accuracy of recommender systems, in particular for the items and users with few ratings [34].\nIn this paper, we propose a neural network (NN) based model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), to model users and items jointly using review text for rating prediction problems. The proposed model learns\nhidden latent features for users and items jointly using two coupled neural networks such that the rating prediction accuracy is maximized. One of the networks models user behavior using the reviews written by the user, and the other network models item properties using the written reviews for the item. The learned latent features for user and item are used to predict the corresponding rating in a layer introduced on the top of both networks. This interaction layer is motivated by matrix factorization techniques [13] to let latent factors of users and items interact with each other.\nTo the best of our knowledge, DeepCoNN is the first deep model that represents both users and items in a joint manner using reviews. It makes the model scalable and also suitable for online learning scenarios where the model needs to get updated continuously with new data. Another key contribution is that DeepCoNN represents review text using pre-trained word-embedding technique [21, 20] to extract semantic information from the reviews. Recently, this representation has shown excellent results in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks [7, 4, 21]. Moreover, a significant advantage of DeepCoNN compared to most other approaches [17, 16] which benefit from reviews is that it models users and items in a joint manner with respect to prediction accuracy. Most of the similar algorithms perform the modeling independently of the ratings. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the learned factors can be beneficial to the rating prediction.\nThe experiments on real-world datasets including Yelp, Amazon [19], and Beer [18] show that DeepCoNN outperforms all the compared baselines in prediction accuracy. Also, the proposed algorithm increases the performance for users and items with fewer ratings more than the ones with a higher number of ratings. It shows that DeepCoNN alleviates the sparsity problem by leveraging review text.\nOur contributions and also advantages of DeepCoNN can be summarized as follows:\n• The proposed Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN) jointly model user behaviors and item properties using text reviews. The extra shared layer at the top of two neural networks connects the two parallel networks such that user and item representations can interact with each other to predict ratings. To the best of our knowledge, DeepCoNN is the first one that jointly models both user and item from reviews using neural networks.\n• It represents review text as word-embeddings using pre-trained deep models. The experimental results demonstrate that the semantic meaning and sentimental attitudes of reviews in this representation can increase the accuracy of rating prediction. All competing techniques which are based on topic modeling [38, 3, 8] use the traditional bag of words techniques.\n• It does not only alleviate the problem of sparsity by leveraging reviews, but also improves the overall performance of the system significantly. It outperforms state-of-the-art techniques [17, 33, 25, 35] in terms of prediction accuracy on all of the evaluated datasets including Yelp, 21 categories of Amazon, and Beer (see Section 3).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe DeepCoNN in detail. Experiments are pre-\nsented in Section 3 to analyze DeepCoNN and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to the state-of-the-art techniques for recommendation systems. In Section 4, we give a short review of the works related to our study. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 5."

      "text" : "The architecture of the proposed model for rating prediction is shown in Figure 1. The model consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layer, one network for users (Netu) and one network for items (Neti). User reviews and item reviews are given to Netu and Neti respectively as inputs, and corresponding rating is produced as the output. In the first layer, denoted as look-up layer, review text for users or items are represented as matrices of word embeddings to capture the semantic information in the review text. Next layers are the common layers used in CNN based models to discover multiple levels of features for users and items, including convolution layer, max pooling layer, and fully connected layer. Also, a top layer is added on the top of the two networks to let the hidden latent factors of user and item interact with each other. This layer calculates an\nobjective function that measures the rating prediction error using the latent factors produced by Netu and Neti. In the following subsections, since Netu and Neti only differ in their inputs, we focus on illustrating the process for Netu in detail. The same process is applied for Neti with similar layers."

      "text" : "A word embedding f : M → ℜn, where M represents the dictionary of words, is a parameterized function mapping words to n-dimensional distributed vectors. Recently, this approach has boosted the performance in many NLP applications [12, 7]. DeepCoNN uses this representation technique to exploit the semantics of reviews. In the look-up layer, reviews are represented as a matrix of word embeddings to extract their semantic information. To achieve it, all the reviews written by user u, denoted as user reviews, are merged into a single document du1:n, consisting of n words in total. Then, a matrix of word vectors, denoted as V u1:n, is built for user u as follows:\nV u 1:n = φ(d u 1 )⊕ φ(du2 )⊕ φ(du3 )⊕ ... ⊕ φ(dun), (1)\nwhere duk indicates the kth word of document d u 1:n, lookup function φ(duk) returns the corresponding c-dimensional word vector for the word duk , and ⊕ is the concatenation operator. It should be considered that the order of words is preserved in matrix V u1:n that is another advantage of this representation comparing to bag-of-words techniques."

Convolution layer consists of m neurons which produce new features by applying convolution operator on word vectors V u1:n of user u. Each neuron j in the convolutional layer\nuses filter Kj ∈ ℜc×t on a window of words with size t. For V u1:n, we perform a convolution operation regarding each kernel Kj in the convolutional layer.\nzj = f(V u 1:n ∗Kj + bj) (2)\nHere symbol ∗ is convolution operator, bj is a bias term and f is an activation function. In the proposed model, we use Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) [22]. It is defined as Eq. 3. Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh units [14].\nf(x) = max{0, x} (3) Following the work of [7], we then apply Eq. 4, a max pooling operation, over the feature map and take the maximum value as the feature corresponding to this particular kernel. The most important feature of each feature map, which has the highest value, has been captured. This pooling scheme can naturally deal with the varied length of the text. After the max pooling operation, convolutional results are reduced to a fixed size vector.\noj = max{z1, z2, ..., z(n−t+1)} (4) We have described the process by which one feature is extracted from one kernel. The model uses multiple filters to obtain various features and the output vector of the convolutional layer is as Eq. 5.\nO = {o1, o2, o3, ..., on1}, (5) where n1 denotes the number of kernel in the convolutional layer.\nxu = f(W ×O + g) (6) The results from the max-pooling layer are passed to a fully connected layer with weight matrix W . As shown in\nEq. 6, the output of the fully connected layer xu ∈ ℜn2×1 is considered as features for user u. Finally, the outputs of both user and item CNN xu and yi can be obtained."

Thus, to map them into the same feature space, we introduce a shared layer on the top to couple Netu and Neti. First, let us concatenate xu and yi into a single vector ẑ = (xu,yi). To model all nested variable interactions in ẑ, we introduce Factorization Machine (FM) [24] as the estimator of the corresponding rating. Therefore, given a batch of N training examples T , we can write down its cost as Eq. 7.\nJ = ŵ0 +\n|ẑ|∑\ni=1\nŵiẑi +\n|ẑ|∑\ni=1\n|ẑ|∑\nj=i+1\n〈v̂i, v̂j〉ẑiẑj , (7)\nwhere ŵ0 is the global bias, ŵi models the strength of the ith variable in ẑ and 〈v̂i, v̂j〉 = ∑|ẑ| f=1 v̂i,f v̂j,f . 〈v̂i, v̂j〉 models the second order interactions."

RMSprop is an adaptive version of gradient descent which adaptively controls the step size with respect to the absolute value of the gradient. It does it by scaling the update value of each weight by a running average of its gradient norm. The updating rules for parameter set θ of the networks are as the following:\nrt ← 0.9( ∂J ∂θ ) 2 + 0.1rt−1 (9)\nθ ← θ − ( λ√ rt + ǫ ) ∂J ∂θ , (10)\nwhere λ is the learning rate, ǫ is a small value added for numerical stability.

Topic modeling techniques infer latent topic variables using the bag-of-words assumption, in which word order is ignored. However, in many text modeling applications, word order is crucial [32]. DeepCoNN is not based on topic modeling and uses word embeddings to create a matrix of word vectors where the order of words are preserved. In this way, convolution operations make use of\nthe internal structure of data and provide a mechanism for efficient use of words’ order in text modeling [11].\n2.7.2 Online Learning Scalability and handling dynamic pools of items and users\nare considered as critical needs of many recommender systems. The time sensitivity of recommender systems poses a challenge in learning latent factors in an online fashion. DeepCoNN is scalable to the size of the training data, and also it can easily get trained and updated with new data because it is based on NN. Updating latent factors of items or users can get performed independently from historical data. All the approaches which employ topic modeling techniques do not benefit from these advantages to this extent."

It contains more than 1M reviews and ratings.\n• Amazon: Amazon Review dataset [19] contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon website2. It includes more than 143.7 million reviews spanning from May 1996 to July 2014. It has 21 categories of items, and as far as we know, this is the largest public available rating dataset with text reviews.\n• Beer: It is a beer review dataset extracted from ratebeer.com. The data span a period of more than 10 years, including almost 3 million reviews up to November 2011 [18].\nAs we can see in Table 2, all datasets contain more than half a million of reviews. However, in Yelp and Amazon, customers provide less than six pair of reviews and ratings on average which shows these two datasets are extremely sparse. This sparsity can largely deteriorate the performance of recommender systems. Besides, in all datasets, each review consists of less than 150 words on average.\nIn our experiments, we adopt the well-known Mean Square Error (MSE) to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. It is selected because most of the related works have used the same evaluation metric[17, 16, 1].

We chose Matrix Factorization (MF) and Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) to validate that review information is helpful for recommender systems, (ii) topic modeling based models which use review information. Most of the recommender systems which take reviews into consideration are based on topic modeling techniques. To compare our model with topic modeling based recommender systems, we select three representative models: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [5], Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) [33] and Hidden Factor as Topic (HFT) [17], and (iii) deep recommender systems. In [35], authors have proposed a state-of-the-art deep recommender system named Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL). Note that all the baselines except MF and PMF have incorporated review information into their models to improve prediction.\n• MF: Matrix Factorization [13] is the most popular CF-based recommendation method. It only uses rating matrix as input and estimates two low-rank matrices to predict ratings. In our implementation, Alternating Least Squares (ALS) technique is adopted to minimize its objective function.\n• PMF:Probabilistic MatrixFactorization is introduced in [25]. It models latent factors of users and items by Gaussian distributions.\n• LDA:LatentDirichletAllocation is a well-known topic modeling algorithm presented in [5]. In [17], it is proposed to employ LDA to learn a topic distribution from a set of reviews for each item. By treating the learned topic distributions as latent features for each item, latent features for each user is estimated by optimizing rating prediction accuracy with gradient descent.\n• CTR: Collaborative Topic Regression has been proposed by [33]. It showed very good performance on recommending articles in a one-class collaborative filtering problem where a user is either interested or not.\n• HFT: Hidden Factor as Topic proposed in [17] employs topic distributions to learn latent factors from user or item reviews. The authors have shown that item specific topic distributions produce more accurate predictions than user specific ones. Thus, we report the results of HFT learning from item reviews.\n• CDL: Collaborative Deep Learning tightly couples a Bayesian formulation of the stacked denoising autoencoders and PMF. The middle layer of auto-encoders serves as a bridge between auto-encoders and PMF."

We use 80% of each dataset as the training set, 10% is treated as the validation set to tune the hyper-parameters, and the rest is used as the test set. All the hyper-parameters of the baselines and DeepCoNN are selected based on the performance on the validation set.\nFor MF and PMF, we used grid search to find the best values for the number of latent factors from {25, 50, 100, 150, 200}, and regularization parameter from {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0}.\nFor LDA, CTR and HFT, the number of topics K is selected from {5, 10, 20, 50, 100} using the validation set. We set K = 10 for LDA and CTR. The CTR model solves the one-class collaborative filtering problem [23] by using two different values for the precision parameter c of a Gaussian distribution. Following the work of [16], in our experiments, we set precision c as the same for all the observed ratings for rating prediction. HFT-k (k = 10, 50) are included to show the impact of the number of latent factors for HFT. By performing a grid search on the validation set, we set hyper-parameters α = 0.1, λu = 0.02 and λv = 10 for CTR and HFT. To optimize the performance of CDL, we performed a grid search on the hyper-parameters λu, λv, λn, λw and L. Similar with CTR, the confidence parameter cij of CDL is set as the same for all observed ratings.\nWe empirically studied the effects of two important parameters of DeepCoNN: the number of latent factors(|xu| and |yi|) and the number of convolutional kernels: n1. In Figure 2, we show the performance of DeepCoNN on the validation set of Yelp with varying |xu| and |yi| from 5 to 100 and n1 from 10 to 400 to investigate its sensitivity. As it can be seen, it does not improve the performance when the number of latent factors and number of kernels is greater than 50 and 100 respectively. Thus, we set |xu| = |yi| = 50 and n1 = 100. Other hyper-parameters: t, c, λ and batch size are set as 3, 300, 0.002 and 100, respectively. These values were chosen through a grid search on the validation sets. We used a pre-trained word embeddings which are trained\non more than 100 billion words from Google News [21] 3.

The experiments are repeated 3 times, and the averages are reported with the best performance shown in bold. The last column indicates the percentage of improvements gained by DeepCoNN compared to the best baseline in the corresponding category.\nIn Table 3, all models perform better on Beer dataset than on Yelp and Amazon. It is mainly related to the sparsity of Yelp and Amazon. Although PMF performs better than MF on Yelp, Beer, and most categories of Amazon, both techniques do not show good performance compared to the ones which use reviews. It validates our hypothesis that review text provides additional information, and considering reviews in models can improve rating prediction.\nAlthough simply employing LDA to learn features from item reviews can help the model to achieve improvements, LDA models reviews independent of ratings. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the learned features can be beneficial to rating prediction. Therefore, by modeling ratings and reviews together, CTR and HFT attain additional improvements. Among those topic modeling based models (LDA, CTR and HFT), both HFT-10 and HFT-50 perform better in all three datasets.\nWith the capability of extracting deep effective features from item review text, as we can see in Table 3, CDL outperforms all topic modeling based recommender systems and advances the state-of-the-art. However, in benefiting from joint modeling capacity and semantic meaning existing from review text, DeepCoNN beats the best baseline in Yelp, Beer and Amazon and gains 8.3% improvement on average."

To answer these questions, we compare the DeepCoNN with its five variants: DeepCoNNUser, DeepCoNN-Item, DeepCoNN-TFIDF, DeepCoNN-Ra ndom and DeepCoNN-DP. These five variants are summarized in the following:\n• DeepCoNN-User: The Neti of DeepCoNN is substituted with a matrix. Each row of the matrix is the latent factors of one item. This matrix is randomly initialized and optimized during the training.\n• DeepCoNN-Item: Similar with DeepCoNN-User, the Netu of DeepCoNN is replaced with a matrix. Each row of the matrix is the latent factors of one user. This matrix is randomly initialized and optimized during the training.\n• DeepCoNN-TFIDF: Instead of using word embedding, the TFIDF scheme is employed to represent review text as input to DeepCoNN.\n• DeepCoNN-Random: Our baseline model where all word representations are randomly initialized as fixedlength vectors.\n• DeepCoNN-DP: The factorization machine in the objective function is substitued with a simple dot product of xu and yi.\nThe performance of DeepCoNN and its variants on Yelp, Beer and one category of the Amazon dataset: Music Instruments are given in Table 4.\nTo demonstrate that the two deep CNNs can cooperate with each other to learn effective latent factors from user and item reviews, DeepCoNN-User and DeepCoNN-Item are trained with only one CNN with review text as input and the other CNN is substituted with a list of latent variables as the parameters to get learned. In this manner, latent factors of users or items are learned without considering their corresponding review text. As it can be seen in Table 4, while DeepCoNN-User and DeepCoNN-Item achieve similar results, DeepCoNN delivers the best performance by modeling both users and items. It verifies that review text is necessary for modeling latent factors of both users and items. Also, it shows that review text has informative information that can help to improve the performance of recommendation.\nFurthermore, to validate the effectiveness of word representation, we compare DeepCoNN with DeepCoNN-TFIDF and DeepCoNN-Random. The DeepCoNN-TFIDF and DeepCoNN-Random are trained to show that word embedding is helpful to capture semantic meaning existed in the review text. While the performance of DeepCoNN-TFIDF is slightly better than DeepCoNN-Random, they both perform considerably weaker than DeepCoNN. It shows the effectiveness of representing review text in semantic space for modeling the latent factors of items or users.\nAt last, to investigate the efficiency of the shared layer, DeepCoNN-DP is introduced that couples the two networks with a simpler objective function. The comparison shows the superiority of the factorization machine coupling. It can be the result of not only modeling the first order interactions but also the second order interactions between xu and yi."

It would not be easy for the system to learn preferences of such users just from their ratings. It has been shown in some of the previous works that exploiting review text can help to alleviate this problem especially for users or items with few ratings [17]. In this section, we conduct a set of experiments to answer the following questions. Can DeepCoNN help to tackle the cold start problem? What is the impact of the number of reviews on the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm?\nIn Fig. 3, we have illustrated the reductions in MSE resulted from DeepCoNN compared to MF technique on three datasets of Yelp, Beer, and a group of Amazon (Music Instruments). By reduction in MSE, we mean the difference between the MSE of MF and the MSE of DeepCoNN. Users and items are categorized based on the number of their reviews, and reductions are plotted for both users and items groups. It can be seen that in all three datasets, reductions are positive, and DeepCoNN can achieve RMS reduction on all groups of users and items with few number of ratings. A more important advantage of DeepCoNN is that higher reductions are gained for groups with fewer ratings. It shows that DeepCoNN can alleviate the sparsity problem and help on the cold start problem.\nIt can also be seen that there exists a relation between the effectiveness of DeepCoNN and the number of ratings for a user or item. For users or items with a lower number of ratings, DeepCoNN reduction in MSE is higher. It shows that review text can be valuable information especially when we have limited information on the users or items."

      "heading" : "4. RELATED WORKS",
      "text" : "There are two categories of studies related to our work: techniques that model users and/or items by exploiting the\ninformation in online review text, and deep learning techniques employed for recommender systems. In this section, we give a short review of these two research areas and distinguish our work from the existing approaches.\nThe first studies that used online review text in rating prediction tasks were mostly focused on predicting ratings for an existing review [2, 38], while in our paper, we predict the ratings from the history of review text written by a user to recommend desirable products to that user.\nOne of the pioneer works that explored using reviews to improve the rating prediction is presented in [10]. It found that reviews are usually related to different aspects, e.g., price, service, positive or negative feelings, that can be exploited for rating prediction. In [17], the authors proposed Hidden Factors as Topics (HFT) to employ topic modeling techniques to discover latent aspects from either item or user reviews. This method achieves significant improvement compared to models which only use ratings or reviews. A similar approach is followed in [3] with the main difference that it models user’s and items’ reviews simultaneously. In [8], a probabilistic model is proposed based on collaborative filtering and topic modeling. It uncovers aspects and sentiments of users and items, but it does not incorporate ratings during modeling reviews. Ratings Meet Reviews (RMR) [16] also tries to harness the information of both ratings and reviews. One difference between HFT and RMR is that RMR applies topic modeling techniques on item review text and aligns the topics with the rating dimensions to improve prediction accuracy.\nOverall, one limitation of the above studies is that their textual similarity is solely based on lexical similarity. The vocabulary in English is very diverse, and two reviews can be semantically similar even with low lexical overlapping. The semantic meaning is of particular importance and has been ignored in these works. Additionally, reviews are represented by using bag-of-words, and words’ order exists in reviews has not been preserved. At last, the approaches\nwhich employ topic modeling techniques suffer from a scalability problem and also cannot deal with new coming users and items.\nRecently, several studies have been done to use neural network based models including deep learning techniques for recommendation tasks. Several works [26, 37, 15] model users and/or items from the rating matrix using neural networks like denoising auto-encoders or Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). They are considered as collaborative based techniques because they just utilize the rating matrix and ignore review text unlike our approach.\nIn [31] and [36], deep models of CNN and Deep Belief Network (DBN) are introduced to learn latent factors from music data for music recommendation. In both models, initially, they find user and item latent factors using matrix factorization techniques. Then, they train a deep model such that it can reconstruct these latent factors for the items from the music content. A similar approach is followed in [35] for movie recommendation by using a generalized Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE) model. In all these works [31, 36, 35], an item’s latent factors are learned from item’s content and review text is ignored.\nIn [9], a multi-view deep model is built to learn the user and item latent factors in a joint manner and map them to a common space. The general architecture of the model seems to have some similarities to our proposed model, but it differs from ours in some aspects. Their model is a contentbased recommender system and does not use review text. Moreover, their outputs are coupled with a cosine similarity objective function to produce latent factors with high similarity. In this way, user and item factors are not learned explicitly in relation to the rating information, and there is no guarantee that the learned factors can help the recommendation task.\nAll the above NN based approaches differ from DeepCoNN because they ignore review text. To the best of our knowledge, the only work which has utilized deep learning techniques to use review text to improve recommendation is presented in [1]. To use the information exists in reviews, they proposed a model consisting of a matrix factorization technique and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The matrix factorization is responsible for learning the latent factors of users and items, and the RNN models the likelihood of a review using the item’s latent factors. The RNN model is combined with the MF simply via a trade-off term as some sort of a regularization term to tame the curse of data sparsity. Due to the matrix factorization technique, handling new users and items is not trivial in this model unlike DeepCoNN that handles them easily. Their proposed algorithm does not model users and items explicitly in a joint manner from their reviews, and it just uses reviews to regularize their model. In addition, since item text is represented by using bag-of-words, semantic meaning existing in words has not been explored."

      "heading" : "5. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "It is shown that reviews written by users can reveal some info on the customer buying and rating behavior, and also reviews written for items may contain info on their features and properties. In this paper, we presented Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN) which exploits the information exists in the reviews for recommender systems. DeepCoNN consists of two deep neural networks coupled to-\ngether by a shared common layer to model users and items from the reviews. It makes the user and item representations mapped into a common feature space. Similar to MF techniques, user and item latent factors can effectively interact with each other to predict the corresponding rating.\nIn comparison with state-of-the-art baselines, DeepCoNN achieved 8.5% and 7.6% improvements on datasets of Yelp and Beer, respectively. On Amazon, it outperformed all the baselines and gained 8.7% improvement on average. Overall, 8.3% improvement is attained by the proposed model on all three datasets.\nAdditionally, in the experiments by limiting modeling to just one of the users and items, we demonstrated that the two networks could not only separately learn user and item latent factors from review text but also cooperate with each other to boost the performance of rating prediction. Furthermore, we showed that word embedding could be helpful to capture semantic meaning of review text by comparing it with a variant of DeepCoNN which uses random or TF-IDF representations for reviews.\nAt last, we conducted experiments to investigate the impact of the number of reviews. Experimental results showed that for the users and items with few reviews or ratings, DeepCoNN obtains more reduction in MSE than MF. Especially, when only one review is available, DeepCoNN gains the greatest MSE reduction. Thus, it validates that DeepCoNN can ëıňĂectively alleviate the sparsity problem."

In this paper, we present a deep model to learn item properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. The shared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interact with each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN significantly outperforms all baseline recommender systems on a variety of datasets.
