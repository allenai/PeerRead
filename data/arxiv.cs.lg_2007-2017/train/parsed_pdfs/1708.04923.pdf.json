      "text" : "Being able to uently understand, retrieve, and generate crossmodal data, like humans do, has been the holy grail search in Arti cial Intelligence (AI). Language and vision has been considered as the most common and challenging domains to measure the growth of arti cial intelligence. Describing an image in words (image captioning) and imagining a text through images (visual abstraction/ description) is highly natural and seamless for human beings. While reading a gripping novel or a book, we o en tend imagine the storyline and the plots through visuals. If a corresponding movie or video exists for a book, most of the imaginative visuals are borrowed from the movie and mapped with the book stories. Another common example is of the movie director (or a movie creation crew), who produces a movie from a book or storyline through creative visualizations.\nConsider the example book snippet from Harry Po er and the Philosopher’s Stone -\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. ”I want to hear you’re training hard, Po er, or I may change my mind about punishing you.” en she suddenly smiled. ”Your father would have been proud,” she said. ”He was an excellent idditch player himself.”\nProf. McGonagall\nIt is natural for readers to imagine and visualize this book snippet through snippets from the corresponding movie. Figure 1 shows two possible visualizations of the book snippet as imagined by two di erent readers. ese visualizations provide information rich interpretations to the books. e examples are not only restricted to the actual book snippets but also towards any fandom, as the following one -\n”As such I do not expect anyone to understand the subtleties of using machine learning in creativity”, scowled Snape, as he charged into the dark classroom and glared into Harry’s pale blue eyes. ”However, our celebrity Harry Po er,” he paused, ”could probably enlighten us with what would happen if I added a LSTM over a CNN”\nFan Fiction\nFigure 2 shows two possible visualizations of the fan ction of the same book, Harry Po er and the Philosopher’s Stone. Motivated by such human behaviors, in this research, we a empt to describe constituent parts of a book or a story through its corresponding movie visuals.\ne publicly available MovieBook [18] dataset contains manually de ned alignment of 11 movies with their corresponding books. Given a book snippet, we retrieve a sequence of movie snippets describing that book snippet, using three independent models:\n(1) Dialog model: Relevant movie snippets are retrieved by matching the text dialog of the movie with the input book snippet using a skip-thought model [4] (2) Visual model: Relevant movie snippets are retrieved by matching only the visual cues of the movie scene with the input book snippet using a neural-storyteller model 1 (3) Hybrid model: Relevant movie snippets are retrieved using both the text dialog and the visual cues from the movie scene\ne rest of the paper is organized as follows; Section 2 talks about existing literature, Section 3 details the dataset used in this 1h ps://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n04 92\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n6 A\nug 2\n01 7\nML4Creativity’17, August 2017, Nova Scotia, Canada Panwar et al.\nVisual Imagination #2:\nVisual Imagination #2:\nresearch, Section 3 explains the technical details of the proposed approach, Section 5 discusses the experimental results, and Section 6 concludes with some future directions."

      "text" : "e de ned problem statement requires the understanding of both the domains: video analysis and natural langauge processing. Textual content and concept based video retrieval has been well explored in the literature [2, 6, 8]. Yang and Meinel [16] used Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to transcribe content from video lectures and perform querying over the extracted content. Tian et al. [12] further extended this by tracking textual content across the frames in a video for be er content generation. Xu et al. [15] learnt a joint text-video embedding model built over independently learnt deep models of language semantic understanding and video embedding. us, they were able to perform both video to text generation and text based video retrieval using the joint model.\nNg et al. [17] considered each frame of a video as a word in a sentence and learnt an LSTM network to temporally embed the video. e representation for each frame was obtained using a deep CNN making the overall network as a CNN-LSTM deep network. Donahue et al. [3] proposed a Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) model for conditionally embedding the video based on the task to be performed. Venugopalan et al. [14] learnt a sequence to sequence model to encode a video frame sequence using an LSTM network and decode its corresponding caption using a conditional LSTM. For understanding large pieces of text, Le and Mikolov [5] extended a word representation word2vec to learn paragraph and document level representation. Arora et al. [1] proposed a simple method of averaging the word embeddings over a sentence and modifying it using PCA. Recently, Kiros et al. [4] came up with an unsupervised method of learning sentence representation called skip-thought vectors which provided comparable results in 8 di erent tasks without the need for task adaptation.\nOne of the closest work to our research is the MovieQA system proposed by Tapaswi et al. [11]. A memory network based question answering system is built on a movie corpus using multiple sources of information such as movie plot, movie video, subtitle, scripts, and Described Video Service (DVS) transcriptions. Our work considers the book content as the input which is, in general, more prose and descriptive than a movie plot or script. Tapaswi et al. [10] further proposed Book2Movie which aims to align book chapters to its\ncorresponding movie scenes. We are working at a much granular level of sentences rather than an entire chapter, which is a more challenging task. Our work is built upon Zhu et al. [18] aligning books and movies at sentence level. While they have performed experiments on describing movies in terms of the book, we a empt to describe the book in terms of the movie which is considered a much more creative problem."

      "text" : "Built upon the work by Zhu et al. [18], the MovieBook dataset is the highly relevant for our problem statement. e dataset contains visual clips (roughly spanning for few seconds) from movies, corresponding dialogue text (SRT) for the visual clips, and small chunks of book text (roughly 3-10 lines) for 11 di erent books. A manual alignment is available for a part of each book and each alignment is done using one of the three cues: (i) Visual cue based on the movie clip, (ii) Dialog cue based on the dialog spoken during that clip, and (iii) Audio cue based on the audio during that clip. e properties of this dataset are shown in Table 1. From the collection of 11 book-movie pairs, there are a total of 29, 436 book paragraphs, 19, 985 movie shots, and 16, 909 sentences in dialog subtitles. Using this corpus, a total of 1, 449 (book paragraph, movie shot) pairs were manually aligned using the dialog subtitles while 621 pairs were aligned using the visual content of the movie shot.\nAdditional to the MovieBook dataset, a huge corpus of books is used to train a model for sentence representation. e BookCorpus dataset has more than 11, 000 from 16 di erent genres containing more than 11 million sentences and a skip-thought model [4] is trained to learn a sentence representation. e pretrained model is already publicly available at: h ps://github.com/ ryankiros/skip-thoughts."

Given a tuple of three sentences, {si−1, si , si+1}, the a RNNmodel encodes the sentence si and two decoders a empts to predict the sentence si−1 and si+1, conditional on the encoding, as shown in Figure 4. us, such a model requires tuples of three sentences and can be trained in an unsupervised fashion. Kiros et al. [4] further show that a generic sentence representation model trained on a huge corpus of books can be directly used in eight di erent applications without the need for ne-tuning or task adaption. Owing to the generalizable nature of the skip-thought model, we use the available pre-trained model for directly extracting the representation of both book sentences and movie dialogue."

      "text" : "Representing videos as an embedded vector representation is well studied. In this research, we want to textually describe a movie clip so that semantic similarity could be computedwith the book snippet. Image captioning and video captioning techniques could generate a single sentence caption for an image or a video. Recently, neuralstoryteller 2 conditioned the image caption on an RNN to generate\n2h ps://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller\na longer story to explain a single image. In this research, we explain the neural-storyteller style of model to generate a longer story for a video than for a single image. Given a video frame, an image caption is generated for every frame using an encoder-decoder model as proposed in [10]. Conditioned on the combined frame captions, an RNN decoder generates a story explaining the entire video clip. e details of the model is explained here: h ps://github.com/ryankiros/ neural-storyteller and the process is illustrated in Figure 5. From an input video sequence, frame are sampled are regular intervals at 2fps. For every frame, a caption is generated using a standard image captioning model. All the generated captions are pooled and provided as input to a conditional LSTM decoder, which generates story that represents the entire video sequence and not each frame in the video. It can be observed from the generated story shown in Figure 5, that the swimming pool is semantically being mapped to water, the person is being mapped as “her” due to the presence of long hair, and speci c semantic a ributes are extracted such as shirtless man, being top of sur oard. ese semantically extracted text could be used to map with the book paragraph which are typically descriptive, in nature."

As proposed in [9], ®b . ®d and abs(®b− ®d) are computed and concatenated. Over these representations, a regression based semantic similarity model is trained [9]. Here the regression model is binary, predicting the input pair as {match, non-match}.\nDuring test phase, for a given book sentence or a random fan ction sentence, its skip-thought representation is calculated and the semantic relevance is computed against all the dialog sentences available. A list of those dialog sentences above a threshold, t , is shortlisted as the relevant movie parts that explains the input book sentence. e video clips corresponding to the retrieved dialog sentences are stitched together and provided to the user."

To compare with the proposed similarity model, a cosine distance based similaritymetric as well the similaritymodel proposed by Tai et al. [9] and trained on SICK dataset, are used.\ne performance of the proposed pipeline is evaluated using top-k Movie Retrieval Accuracy (MRA). is measure calculates the percentage of book sentences input for which all the retrieved movie clips are from the same movie as the input. e performance of the Dialog model and the Visual model are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively. e major observations obtained from the results are as follows:\n(1) A rank-10 MRA of 80% is obtained for the Dialog model and 71% MRA is obtained for the Visual model, using the proposed approach. e proposed semantic similarity fared be er or comparable to the other two approaches, showing the e ectiveness of the similarity method. (2) Although the dataset provides the ground truth alignment, the exact aligned video snippet retrieval accuracy for a given book sentence is irrelevant for our experiments. For a given book sentence, there can be multiple parts in the movie that is semantically related and retrieving those movie snippets is the creative task at hand and not just the manually aligned movie snippet. us, the movie retrieval accuracy is a strong measure to evaluate our creative system rather than the exact alignment retrieval accuracy.\nTo show the e ectiveness of the combined Dialog and Visual Model, a Hybrid model was trained on the entire test set and the results are shown in Figure 8. e results shows that the hybrid model performs be er than the individual models at all ranks, suggesting to use both the modalities for matching during movie retrieval. From Figure 8, it can observed that the Dialog model performs much be er than the Visual model, suggesting that the dialog has richer information than the visual content. e same observation is extended to the Hybrid model, as the Hybrid does not show a rapid improvement compared to the Dialog model. However, there are certain caveats in this comparison as the Visual model is trained on\na much smaller dataset compared with the Dialog model. A working example of the Dialog Model and the Visual Model is shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, respectively."

      "heading" : "6 CONCLUSION AND FUTUREWORK",
      "text" : "In this research, we proposed a creative system which could visualize a snippet of book content using its corresponding movie visuals. We devised three models to retrieve semantically similar movie content of a book snippet: (i) a dialog model which use only the dialog content from the movie, (ii) a visual model which uses only the visual content from the movie, and (iii) a hybrid model which combines both the visual and dialog content from the movie.\nA frame-wise conditional LSTM based decoder is used to generate a single story explaining a movie snippet. Experimental results on the publicly available MovieBook dataset, shows the e ectiveness of the proposed hybrid model providing around 80% rank-10 retrieval accuracy.\nIn future, we plan to extend this approach by creatively generating animated images and video snippets that explains a book snippets [7] [13]. us, the proposed pipeline could be used for unseen book or for books which do not have a corresponding movie and their corresponding visual abstractions could be generated. Such a creative system would eventually be of great use for creative directors and advertisment lm makers as they can visualize stories and scripts before the movie is being produced."

    "abstractText" : "Cross-modal data retrieval has been the basis of various creative tasks performed by Articial Intelligence (AI). One such highly challenging task for AI is to convert a book into its corresponding movie, which most of the creative lm makers do as of today. In this research, we take the rst step towards it by visualizing the content of a book using its corresponding movie visuals. Given a set of sentences from a book or even a fan-ction wrien in the same universe, we employ deep learning models to visualize the input by stitching together relevant frames from the movie. We studied and compared three dierent types of seing to match the book with the movie content: (i) Dialog model: using only the dialog from the movie, (ii) Visual model: using only the visual content from the movie, and (iii) Hybrid model: using the dialog and the visual content from the movie. Experiments on the publicly available MovieBook dataset shows the eectiveness of the proposed models.",
