      "text" : "We describe QCRI’s phrase-based and Neural MT systems. We participated in the Arabic-to-English and English-toArabic MT tracks. Our translation engines have been historically based on the phrase-based system trained using the Moses toolkit [1], but during the course of this evaluation, we made a transition towards the newly emerged Neural MT framework [2], using Nematus, a toolkit used by the top performing team [3], during the recent WMT campaign.\nAn interesting challenge associated with the IWSLT campaign is the problem of domain adaptation. The in-domain data based on TED talks is available in very little quantity compared to the out-domain UN corpus [4], which has been found to be harmful previously when simply concatenated to the training [5]. In this year’s IWSLT, two additional data resources Opus subtitles [6] and the QED corpus [7] were introduced. The latter was also used as an official test-set. Therefore apart from exploring phrase-based versus Neural MT, we geared ourselves towards adapting our system towards TED and QED talks in this multi-domain scenario. With these goals in mind we re-explored both model weighting and data filtering techniques, in these new data settings. Below we itemize the most successful attributes of our\nphrase-based system:\n• We applied MML-based data selection [8] to the UN and Open Sub-title data, with the goals of filtering out harmful data.\n• We trained OSM models [9] on separate corpora, and interpolated them [10] by optimizing perplexity on the tuning-set. We also tried this on the OSM models trained on the word classes [11].\n• We tried the fine-tuning method of training the NNJM model on the out-domain data and fine-tuning with the in-domain TED data [12].\n• We trained big language models using all the English mono data available from the WMT campaign and giga word corpus for Arabic.\nWe trained our Neural MT system using the Nematus toolkit. We used Bidirectional RNN’s for the encoder, 1024 LSTM units, and a word embedding size of 500. Below we itemize what worked when training the neural MT system:\n• We trained our baseline model on all of the UN corpus, then continued training with the Open subtitles corpus, and finally fine-tuned with the in-domain data\n• We fine-tuned all of our models without freezing any layers in the network, since we had sufficient amount of data to train on.\n• We used dropout when fine-tuning with in-domain data, since it is relatively small compared to the UN and Open subtitle data.\n• We trained our final models with an ensemble of the last eight models, where each model was fine-tuned with the in-domain data.\nFinally we applied system combination over the outputs of best Neural MT and phrase-based systems using MEMT [13]. Our efforts were mainly focused towards the AR→EN TED task. In the end we just replicated our best system for the EN→AR direction and the QED task. For our best Neural MT system, we were unable to use an ensemble in the EN→AR direction, since we could not train several comparable models to combine."

This contained two indomain data sets TED talks and QED corpus [14] and two out-domain data sets UN corpus [4] and OPUS data [6]. The statistics are shown in Table 1. For language model we trained using the target side of the parallel corpus and all the available English data from the recent WMT campaign [15], and GigaWord and OPUS mono corpus for Arabic.\nWe segmented Arabic data using both MADAMIRA and Farasa. We found MADAMIRA [16] performed 0.1 BLEU points better than Farasa [17] (See Table 2) and decided to use it for the competition. We tokenized the English side using standard tokenizer of Moses. For English→Arabic, outputs were detokenized using MADA detokenizer. Before scoring the output, we normalized them and reference translations using the QCRI normalizer [5]."

We did not include Opus data (40 Million Sentences) and NNJM in these experiments to get the results quickly. Table 3 shows the results. We found 3.75% (≈685k sentences) to be the optimal threshold. Alternative to data selection, we tried training in-\nand out-domain phrase-tables separately and using the outdomain phrase-table only as a back-off. Second last row of Table 3 shows results. While it gave improvement on top of the baseline system, it was slightly behind MML filtering.\nWe then tried to find optimal cut-off on the OPUS data, and selected 20 Million sentences (half of the Opus). Our best systems used 3.75% of the UN data and half of the Opus data. Adding the selected Opus data gave an average improvement of +1.2 BLEU points."

The intuition behind freezing a layer is to not allow the weights in that layer to change with additional data. This is sometimes useful when we can learn certain layers better from out-domain data. One\nsuch layer in our case is the word embedding layer. We tried a variation in which we do not freeze any layer. This latter variant was found to outperform the default setting (See Table 12).\nDropouts are found to be useful in NN training, when the training data is small. We experimented with using dropouts in our experiments, but did not find any significant difference. Hence we decided to use it only when fine-tuning with the in-domain data (TED/QED), since both of the other datasets (UN and OPUS) were big and did not pose any risk of inducing the problem of overfitting."

In these experiments, we concatenated the 5% and 30% of the UN data with the in-domain data. To evaluate the most promising models, we trained all of the models until the learning plateaued, and then fine-tuned these models with in-domain data.2 The results are shown in in Table 13. Using only 5% of the data proved harmful, and the system did not generalize as well as the other models. The model trained on 30% of the data performed better than the model trained on all the data, by 0.7 BLEU points.\nIn our subsequent experiments we tried to verify if this finding holds when we add the OPUS data. We therefore trained two systems by fine-tuning 30% selected UN data or full UN data using OPUS. Here the results flipped and the we found that model that used all of the UN data performed better (Compare last two rows in Table 13). Therefore, we decided to focus our efforts on the model trained on the entire UN data for all of the following experiments."

To this end we applied MML-based filtering, interpolated OSM and finetuning of NNJM models. Overall, our phrase-based system achieved a gain of 4 BLEU points on top of the baseline system. We also applied data selection for training our NMT. However, the NMT systems quickly overfit and did not perform well. Our experiments showed that the NMT system trained on the full UN data performed best, and the final NMT system made use of all the available out-of-domain data. However, the training was performed incrementally, starting with UN data for 50k iterations, fine tuned on OPUS for 25k more iterations and then fine tuned the final model using TED talks for a few iterations. We simply replicated our settings to train QED systems. Finally we applied system combination of the two systems using MEMT.\nWhile it is computationally expensive, we found training a neural MT system much simpler than a competitive phrase-based system, where a lot of sub-components need to be optimized independently to reach the best configuration. On the contrary, an NMT system requires least supervision. Secondly once a neural system is trained, the effort can be easily reused to adapt the system towards another domain, as in this case we simply fine-tuned our UN+OPUS system with the QED corpus. On the contrary, almost all the subcomponent of a phrase-based system had to be retrained to adapt the system towards QED corpus."

We built both Phrase-based and Neural machine translation models, in an effort to probe whether the newly emerged NMT framework surpasses the traditional phrase-based systems in Arabic-English language pairs. We trained a very strong phrase-based system including, a big language model, the Operation Sequence Model, Neural Network Joint Model and Class-based models along with different domain adaptation techniques such as MML filtering, mixture modeling and using fine tuning over NNJM model. However, a Neural MT system, trained by stacking data from different genres through fine-tuning, and applying ensemble over 8 models, beat our very strong phrase-based system by a significant 2 BLEU points margin in Arabic→English direction. We did not obtain similar gains in the other direction but were still able to outperform the phrase-based system. We also applied system combination on phrase-based and NMT outputs.",
