      "text" : "In the last decade, we have seen the successful application of automated theorem provers to assist interactive theorem proving. Despite the popularity of these so-called “hammer-style” tools, their performance is still suffering from the gap between underlying logics [1].\nTo circumvent this problem, we introduced a proof strategy language, PSL [4], to Isabelle/HOL [5], taking a meta-tool approach. A proof strategy is an abstract description of how to attack proof obligations. Users write strategies in PSL based on their intuitions on a conjecture. Using a strategy, PSL’s runtime system generates many invocations of Isabelle’s native proof tools, called tactics. The runtime tries to find out the appropriate combination of tactics for each goal by trial-and-error. This way, PSL reduces the domain specific procedure of interactive theorem proving to the well-known dynamic tree search problem. The meta-tool language approach brought the following advantages:\n• Domain specific procedures can be added as new sub-tools. • Sub-tools (including Sledgehammer) can be improved independently of PSL. • Generated efficient-proof scripts are native Isabelle proofs.\nWe provided a default strategy, try hard. Our evaluation shows that PSL based on try - hard significantly outperforms Sledgehammer for many use cases [4]. However, PSL’s proof search procedure is still mostly brute-force. For example, when PSL generates many tactics, even though each of these is tailored for the proof goal utilizing the runtime information, it is still the statically written strategy, try hard, that decides:\n• what kind of tactics to generate, • how to combine them, and • in which order to apply generated tactics."

      "text" : "On a fundamental level, this lack of flexibility stems from the procedural nature of Isabelle’s tactic language, which describes how to prove conjectures in a step-by-step manner rather than what to do with conjectures. However, a conventional declarative language would not be a good solution either, since in many cases we cannot determine what to do with a given proof goal with certainty. Our guess may or may not be right: given a proof goal, we cannot tell which tactics to use until we complete the goal.\nProbabilistic Declarative Proof Strategy Language. We propose the development of a probabilistic declarative proof strategy language (PDPSL), which allows for the description of feasible tactics for arbitrary proof obligation. For example, when we apply a proof strategy, str, written in PDPSL, to a proof search graph, pgraph, PDPSL’s runtime:\n(1) picks up the most promising node in pgraph, (2) applies the most promising tactic that has not been applied to that node yet, and (3) adds the resultant node to pgraph, connecting them with a labelled edge representing the\ntactic application and weight indicating how promising that tactic application is.\nThe runtime keeps applying this procedure until it reaches a solved state, in which the proof is complete. This way, PDPSL executes a best-first search at runtime.\nThe major challenge is the design of PDPSL. A strategy written in PDPSL is applied repeatedly during a best-first search against emerging proof obligations, and we cannot predict how these intermediate goals look like prior to the search; therefore, weighting of tactics against concrete proof goals is not good enough. PDPSL should only describe the meta-information on proof goals and information in Isabelle’s standard library. Such meta-information includes:\n• Which ITP mechanism was used to define constants that appear in the proof obligation? • Does the conjecture involve recursive functions?\nThis may sound too restrictive; however, when proof engineers use ITPs, we often reason on the meta level. For instance, Isabelle’s tutorial [5] introduces the following heuristics:\n“Theorems about recursive functions are proved by induction.” “The right-hand side of an equation should (in some sense) be simpler than the left-hand side.”\nThese are independent of user-defined formalisation.\nPosterior Proof Attempt Evaluation. Evaluating a proof goal to write promising tactics is only half the story of typical interactive proof development. The other half is about evaluating the results of tactic applications. We presume that posterior evaluations on tactic application will improve proof search when combined with prior expectations on tactics described in PDPSL. The main challenge is to find a useful measure by:\n• discovering (possibly multiple) useful measures that indicate progress in proof search, and • investigating how to integrate these measures into the best-first search of PDPSL.\nOf course it is not possible to come up with a heuristic that is guaranteed to work for all kinds of proof obligations. But when focusing on a particular problem domain such as systems verification, it is plausible to find a useful measure to narrow the search space at runtime.\nReinforcement Learning of PDPSL using Large Proof Corpora. PDPSL is primarily for engineers to encode their intuitions. But at the next step, we plan to improve this handwritten heuristics using reinforcement learning on the existing proof corpora. The Isabelle community has a repository of formal proofs, called the Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP) [3]. As of 2015, the size of the AFP is larger than one million lines of code. Additionally, the seL4 project open-sourced roughly 400,000 lines of Isabelle proof script [2]. We speculate that these large proof corpora will work as the basis for reinforcement learning of strategies written in PDPSL. The lack of concrete information on proof obligations can be an advantage at this stage: since PDPSL cannot describe concrete proof obligations, it is less likely to cause over-fitting."
