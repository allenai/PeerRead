      "text" : "Machine learning aims to train a predictive model from a training set of inputout pairs, and then use the model to predict an unknown output from a given test input [14,41,38,13,34,1,18]. In this paper, we focus on the machine learning problem of binary pattern classification. In this problem, each input is a feature vector of a data point, and each output is a binary class label of a data point, either positive or negative [5,28,21,23,33,31,30]. To learn the predictive model, i.e., the classification model, we usually compare the true class label of data point against the predicted label using a loss function. For example, hinge loss, logistic loss, and squared ℓ2 norm loss. By minimizing the loss functions over the training set with regard to the parameter of the classification model, we can obtain a optimal classification model. To evaluate the performance of the model, we apply it to a set of test data points to predict their class labels, and then compare the predicted class labels to their true class labels. This comparison can be conducted by using some multivariate performance measures. For example, prediction accuracy, F-score, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) [7,24,25,2], and precision-recall curve break-even point (RPBEP) [37,19,29,22]. A problem of such machine learning procedure is that in the training process, we optimize a simple loss function, such as hinge loss, but in the test process, we use a different and complex performance measure to evaluate the prediction results. It is obvious that the optimization of the loss function cannot leads to a optimization of the performance measure. For example, in the formulation of support vector machine (SVM), the hinge loss is minimized, but usually in the test procedure, the AUROC is used as a performance measure. However, in many real-world application, the optimization of a specific performance measure is desired. To solve this problem, direct optimization of some complex loss functions corresponding to some desired performance measures are studied. These methods try to a complex loss function in the objective function, and the loss functions is corresponding to the performance measure directly. By minimizing the loss function directly to obtain the predictive model, the desired performance measure can be optimized by the predictive model directly. In this paper, we study this problem, and propose a novel method based on sparse learning and maximum likelihood optimization.\n1.1 Related works\nSome existing works proposed to optimize a complex multivariate loss function are briefly introduced as follows.\n– Joachims proposed to learn a support vector machine to optimize a complex loss function [8]. In the proposed model, the complexity of the predictive model is reduced by minimizing squared ℓ2 norm of the model parameter. To minimize the complex loss, its upper bound is approximated and minimized.\n– Mao and Tsang improved the Joachims’s work by integrating feature selection to support vector machine for complex loss optimization [17]. A weight is assigned to each feature before the predictive model is learned. Moreover, the feature weights and the predictive model parameter is learned jointly in an iterative algorithm. – Li et al. proposed a classifier adaptation method to extend Joachims’s work [12]. The predictive model is a combination of a base classifier and an adaptation function, and the learning of the optimal model is transferred to the learning of the parameter of the adaptation function. – Zhang et al. [40] proposed a novel smoothing strategy by using Nesterov’s accelerated gradient method to improve the convergence rate of the method proposed by Joachims [8]. This method, according to the results reported in [40], can achieve converges significantly faster than Joachims’s method [8], but it does not scarify generalization ability.\nAlmost all the existing methods are limited to the support vector machine for multivariate complex loss function. This method uses a linear function to construct the predictive model, and seek both the minimum complexity and loss.\n1.2 Contribution\nIn this paper, we propose a novel predictive model to optimize a complex loss function. This model is based on the likelihood of a positive or negative class given a input feature vector of a data point. The likelihood function is constructed based on a Sigmoid function of a linear function. Given a group of data points, we organize them as a data tuple, and the predicted class label tuple is the one that maximize the logistic likelihood of the data tuple. The learning target is to learn a predictive model parameter, so that with the corresponding predicted class label tuple, the complex loss function can be minimized. Moreover, we also hope the model parameter can be as sparse as possible, so that only the useful can be kept in the model. To this end, we construct an objective function, which is composed of two terms. The first term is the ℓ1 norm of the parameter to impose the sparsity of the parameter, and the second term is the complex loss function to seek the optimal desired performance measure. The problem is transferred to a minimization problem of the objective function with regard to the parameter. To solve this problem, we first approximate the upper bound of the complex as a logistic function of the parameter, and then optimize it by using the fast iterative shrinkagethresholding algorithm (FISTA). The novelty of this paper is summarized as follows,\n1. For the first time, we propose to use the maximum likelihood model to construct a predictive model for the optimization of complex losses. 2. We construct a novel optimization problem for the learning of the model parameter by considering the sparsity of the model, and the minimization of the complex loss jointly.\n3. We develop a novel iterative algorithm to optimize the proposed minimization problem, and a novel method to approximate the upper bound of the complex loss. The approximation of the upper bound of the complex loss is obtained as a logistic function, and the problem is optimized by a FISTA algorithm.\n1.3 Paper organization\nThis paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we introduce the proposed method, in section 3, we evaluate the proposed method on two real-world applications, and in section 4, the paper is concluded and some future works are given.\n2 Proposed method\n2.1 Problem formulation\nSuppose we have a data set of n data points, and we denote them as {(xi, yi)}| n i=1, where xi ∈ R d is the d-dimensional feature vector of the i-th data point, and yi ∈ {+1,−1} is it corresponding class label. We consider the data points as a data tuple, x = (x1, · · · ,xn), and their corresponding class labels as a label tuple, y = (y1, · · · , yn). Under the framework of complex performance measure optimization, we try to learn a multivariate mapping function to map the data tuple x to a class label tuple y∗ = (y∗1 , · · · , y ∗ n) ∈ Y, where y ∗ i ∈ {+1,−1} is the predicted label of the i-th data point, and Y = {+1,−1}n. To measure the performance of the multivariate mapping function, h(x), we use a predefined complex loss function ∆(y, y∗) to compare the true class label tuple y against the predicted class label tuple y∗.\nTo construct the multivariate mapping function h(x), we proposed to apply a linear discriminate function to match the i-th data point xi against the i-th class label y′i in a candidate tuple y ′ = (y′1, · · · , y ′ n),\nfw(xi, y ′ i) = y ′ iw ⊤xi, (1)\nwhere w = [w1, · · · , wd] ∈ R d is the parameter vector of the function. And then we apply a Sigmoid function to the response of this function to impose it to a range of [0, 1],\ng(xi, y ′ i) =\n1\n1 + exp (−f(xi, y′i))\n= 1\n1 + exp (−y′iw ⊤xi)\n.\n(2)\nMoreover,\ng(xi,+1) = 1\n1 + exp (−w⊤xi)\n=\n( 1 + exp ( −w⊤xi )) − exp ( −w⊤xi ) )\n1 + exp (−w⊤xi)\n= 1− exp\n( −w⊤xi ) )\n1 + exp (−w⊤xi)\n= 1− 1\n1 + exp (w⊤xi)\n= 1− g(xi,−1),\n(3)\nthus we can treat g(xi, yi) as the conditional probability of y = y ′ i given x = xi,\nPr(y = y′i|x = xi) = g(xi, y ′ i). (4)\nWe also assume that the data points in the tuple x are conditional independent from each other, and thus the conditional probability of y = y′ given the x is\nPr(y = y′|x) =\nn ∏\ni=1\nPr(y = y′i|x = xi)\n=\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y′iw ⊤xi)\n.\n(5)\nTo constructed the complex mapping function, we map the data tuple to the class tuple y∗ which can give the maximum log-likelihood,\ny∗ ← h(x) = argmax y′∈Y log (Pr(y = y′|x))\n= argmax y′∈Y log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y′iw ⊤xi)\n)\n.\n(6)\nIn this way, we seek the maximum likelihood estimator of the class label tuple as the mapping result for a data tuple.\nTo learn the parameter of the linear discriminative function, w, so that the complex loss function ∆(y, y∗) can be minimized, we consider the following problems,\n– Encouraging sparsity of w: We assume that in a feature vector a data point, only a few features are useful, while most of the remaining features are useless. Thus we need to conduct a feature selection procedure to remove the useless features and keep the useful features, so that we can obtain a parse feature vector. In our method, instead of seeking sparsity of the feature vectors, we seek the sparsity of the parameter vector w. With a sparse w, we can also control the sparsity of the feature effective to the prediction results. To encourage the sparsity of w, we use the ℓ1 norm of w to present its sparsity, and minimize the ℓ1,\nmin w\n\n\n\n1 2 ‖w‖1 = 1 2\nd ∑\nj=1\n|wj |\n= 1\n2\nd ∑\nj=1\nw2j\n|wj | =\n1 2 w⊤diag\n(\n1\n|w1| , · · · ,\n1\n|wd|\n)\nw\n= 1\n2 w⊤Λw\n}\n,\n(7)\nwhere diag (\n1 |w1| , · · · , 1|wd|\n)\n∈ Rd×d is a diagonal matrix with its diagonal\nelements as 1|w1| , · · · , 1 |wd| , and\nΛ = diag\n(\n1\n|w1| , · · · ,\n1\n|wd|\n)\n(8)\nWhen the ℓ1 norm of w is minimized, most elements of w will shrink to zeros, and leads a sparse w. – Minimizing complex performance lose ∆(y, y∗): Given the predicted label tuple y∗, we can measure the prediction performance by comparing it against the true label tuple y by using a complex performance measure. To obtain an optimal mapping function, we minimize a corresponding complex loss of a complex performance measure, ∆(y, y∗),\nmin w\n∆(y, y∗) (9)\nDue to its complexity, we minimize its upper boundary instead of itself. We have the following Theorem to define the upper boundary of ∆(y, y∗).\nTheorem 1: ∆(y, y∗) satisfies\n∆(y, y∗) ≤max y′∈Y\n{\nlog\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y′iw ⊤xi)\n)\n− log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−yiw⊤xi)\n)\n+∆(y, y′)\n}\n=\n{\nlog\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y′′i w ⊤xi)\n)\n− log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−yiw⊤xi)\n)\n+∆(y, y′′)\n}\n,\n(10) where y′ = (y′1, · · · , y ′ n), and y ′′ = (y′1, · · · , y ′ n),\ny′′ =argmax y′∈Y\n{\nlog\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y′iw ⊤xi)\n)\n− log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−yiw⊤xi)\n)\n+∆(y, y′)\n}\n(11) The proof of this Theorem is found in Appendix section.\nAfter we have the upper bound of the loss function, we minimize it instead of ∆(y, y∗) to obtain the mapping function parameter, w,\nmin w\n{\nlog\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y′′i w ⊤xi)\n)\n− log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−yiw⊤xi)\n)\n+∆(y, y′′)\n=\nn ∑\ni=1\nlog\n(\n1 + exp(−yiw ⊤xi) 1 + exp(−y′′i w ⊤xi)\n)\n+∆(y, y′′)\n}\n.\n(12) Please note that y′′ is also a function of w.\nThe overall optimization problem is obtained by combining the problems in (7) and (12),\nmin w\n{\nf(w) = 1\n2 w⊤Λw+ C\n[\nn ∑\ni=1\nlog\n(\n1 + exp(−yiw ⊤xi) 1 + exp(−y′′i w ⊤xi)\n)\n+∆(y, y′′)\n]}\n(13) where C is a tradeoff parameter. Please not that in this objective, both Λ and y′′ are functions of w. In the first term of the objective, we impose the sparsity of the w, and in the second term, we minimize the upper bound of ∆(y, y∗).\n2.2 Optimization\nTo solve the problem of (13), we try to employ the FISTA algorithm with constant step-size to minimize the objective f(w). This algorithm is an iterative algorithm, and in each iteration, we first update a search point according to a previous solution of the parameter vector, and then update the next parameter vector based on the search point. The basic procedures are summarized as the two following steps:\n1. Search point step: In this step, we assume the previous solution of w is wpre, and seek a search point v ∈ R d based on w is wpre and a stepsize L.\n2. Weighting factor step: In this step, we assume we have a weighting factor of previous iteration, τpre, and we update it to a new weighting factor τcur. 3. Solution update step: In this step, we update the new solution of the variable according to the search point. The updated solution is a weighted version of the previous search points, weighted by the weighting factors.\nIn the follows, we will discuss how to implement these three steps."

Due to the complexity of function f(w), the close form of gradient function ∇f(w) is difficult to obtain.

With the search point and a updated weighting factor, we update the mapping function parameter vector, w. This algorithm is called learning of sparse maximum likelihood model (SMLM).\n2.4 Scaling up to big data based on Hadoop\nIn this section, we discuss how to fit the proposed algorithm to big data set. We assume that the number of the training data points, n, is extremely large. One single machine is not able to store the entire data set, the data set is split to m subsets, and stored in m different clusters. The clusters are managed by a big data platform, Hadoop [4,39,10,27]. Hadoop is a software of distributed data management and processing. Given a large data set, it split it to subsets, and store them in different clusters. To process the data and obtain a final output, it uses a Map-Reduce framework [6,26,16,3]. This framework requires a Map program and a Reduce program from the users. The Hadoop software deliver the Map program to each cluster and uses it to process the subset to produce some median results, and then use the Reduce program to combine the median results to produce the final outputs. Using the Map-Reduce the framework, by defining our own Map and Reduce functions, we can implement the critical steps in Algorithm 1. For example, in the sub-step (c) of step k, we need to calculate uk from (17). In this step, the most time consuming step is to calculate the summation of a function over all the data points,\noutput =\nn ∑\ni=1\n(\ny′′i xi exp(−y ′′ i w ⊤ prexi)\n1 + exp(−y′′i w ⊤ prexi)\n− yixi exp(−yiw\n⊤ prexi)\n1 + exp(−yiw⊤prexi)\n)\n= n ∑\ni=1\nfunction(xi, yi, y ′′ i ),\n(20)\nwhere function(xi, yi, y ′′ i ) =\ny′′i xi exp(−y ′′ i w ⊤ prexi)\n1+exp(−y′′ i w ⊤ prexi)\n− yixi exp(−yiw\n⊤ prexi)\n1+exp(−yiw⊤prexi) is the\nfunction applied to each data point. Since the entire data set is split to m subsets, Xm| m j=1, we can design a Map function to calculate the summation over each subset, and then design a Reduce function to combine the to obtain the final output. The Map and Reduce functions are as follows.\nMap function applied to the j-th subset 1. Input: Data points of the j-th subset, {(xi, yi, y ′′ i )}|i:xi∈Xj . 2. Input: Previous parameter, wpre. 3. Initialize: Outputj = 0. 4. For i : xi ∈ Xj\n(a) Outputj = Outputj + function(xi, yi, y ′′ i );\n5. Endfor 6. Output: Outputj\nReduce function to calculate the final output 1. Input: Median outputs of m Map functions, Outputj| m j=1. 2. Initialize: Output = 0. 3. For j = 1, · · · ,m\n(a) Output = Output+Outputj; 4. Endfor 5. Output: Output"

The proposed model is training over the training set, and then used to predict the class labels of the testing data points in the test set. The prediction results are evaluated by a performance measurement. This performance measurement is used to compare the true class labels of the test data points against the predicted class labels. In the training procedure, a complex loss function corresponding to the performance measurement is minimized.\nIn our experiments, we consider three performance measurements, which are F-score, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and precision-recall curve break-even point (RPBEP). To define these performance measures, we first need to define the following items,\n– true positive (TP), the number of correctly predicted positive data points, – true negative (TN), the number of correctly predicted negative data points, – false positive (FP), the number of negative data points wrongly predicted\nto positive data points, and – false negative (FN), the number of positive data points wrongly predicted\nto negative data points.\nWith these measures, we can define F-score as follows,\nF = 2× TP\n2× TP + FP + FN .

These images are from web pages, and are labeled by people manually. The entire data set are split into three subsets, which are one training set, one validation set, and on testing set. The training set contains 1.2 million images, the validation set contains 50,000 images, and the testing set contains 150,000 images. To represent each image, we use the bag-of-features method. Local SIFT features are extracted from each image, and quantized to a histogram. The features can be downloaded directly from http://image-net.org/download-features."

      "text" : "In this experiment, we do not use the 10-fold cross validation, but use the given training/ validation/ testing set splitting. We first perform the proposed algorithm to the training set to learn the classifier, then use the validation set to justify the optimal tradeoff parameters, finally test the classifier over the testing set. The performances of F-score, AUROC, and RPBEP are considered in this experiment. To handle the multi-classification problem, we have a binary classification problem for each class, and in this problem, the considered class is a positive class, while the combination of all other classes is a negative class."

From these figures, we clearly see that the proposed algorithm outperforms the competing methods. This is another strong evidence of the effectiveness of the SMLM algorithm. Moreover, it also shows that the proposed algorithm also works well over the big data.\n3.4 Running time\nThe running time of the proposed algorithm on the three used data sets are given in Fig. 10. It can be observed from this figure that the first two experiments do not consume much time, while the third large scale data set based experiment costs a lot of time. This is natural, because in each iteration of the\nalgorithm, we have a function for each data point, and a summation over the responses of this function."

      "heading" : "4 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimization of complex corresponding to a complex multivariate performance measure. We propose a novel predicative model to solve this problem. This model is based on the maximum likelihood of a class label tuple given a input data tuple. To solve the model parameter, we propose an optimization problem based on the approximation of the upper bound of the loss function and the sparsity of the model. Moreover, an iterative algorithm is developed to solve it. Experiments on two real-world applications show its advantages over state-of-the-art. In the future, we will extend the proposed algorithm to different applications, such as computational biology [35,42,15,20] and multimedia information processing [34,32,31,33].\nAppendix\nProof of Theorem 1: According to (6), we have\ny∗ = argmax y′∈Y log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y′iw ⊤xi)\n)\n,\n⇒ log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y∗iw ⊤xi)\n)\n≥ log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y′iw ⊤xi)\n)\n, ∀y′ ∈ Y,\n⇒ log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y∗iw ⊤xi)\n)\n≥ log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−yiw⊤xi)\n)\n,\n⇒ log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y∗iw ⊤xi)\n)\n− log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−yiw⊤xi)\n)\n≥ 0,\n⇒ log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y∗iw ⊤xi)\n)\n− log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−yiw⊤xi)\n)\n+∆(y, y∗) ≥ ∆(y, y∗),\n⇒max y′∈Y\n{\nlog\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−y′iw ⊤xi)\n)\n− log\n(\nn ∏\ni=1\n1\n1 + exp (−yiw⊤xi)\n)\n+∆(y, y′)\n}\n≥ ∆(y, y∗),\n(24) thus we have (10)."

    "abstractText" : "Traditional machine learning methods usually minimize a simple loss function to learn a predictive model, and then use a complex performance measure to measure the prediction performance. However, minimizing a simple loss function cannot guarantee that an optimal performance. In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing the complex performance measure directly to obtain a predictive model. We proposed to construct a maximum likelihood model for this problem, and to learn the model parameter, we minimize a complex loss function corresponding to the desired complex performance measure. To optimize the loss function, we approximate the upper bound of the complex loss. We also propose impose the sparsity to the model parameter to obtain a sparse model. An objective is constructed by combining the upper bound of the loss function and the sparsity of the model parameter, and we develop an iterative algorithm to minimize it by using the fast iterative shrinkagethresholding algorithm framework. The experiments on optimization on three different complex performance measures, including F-score, receiver operating characteristic curve, and recall precision curve break even point, over three real-world applications, aircraft event recognition of civil aviation safety, intrusion detection in wireless mesh networks, and image classification, show the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.",
