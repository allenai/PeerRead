      "text" : "Large margin models have been widely used in natural language processing for faster learning rate and smaller computational cost. However, the algorithms may still suffer from slow training time when training examples are extremely massive, the weight vector is large, or the inference process is slow. With parallel algorithms, we can make better use of our multi-core machine and reduce the time cost of training process.\nUnluckily, most studies about parallel algorithms mainly focus on SGD. Recht et.al (2011) first proposed a lock-free parallel SGD algorithm called HOGWILD. It is a simple and effective algorithm which outperforms non-parallel algorithms by an order of magnitude. Lian et.al (2015) provide theoretical analysis of asynchronous parallel SGD for nonconvex optimization and a more precise description for lock-free implementation on shared memory system.\nZinkevich et.al (2010) proposed a parallel algorithm for multi-machine called Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD). PSGD is an effective parallel approach on distributed machine but Recht et.al (2011) found that it is not as promising as HOGWILD on a single machine. Zhao and Li (2016) propose a fast asynchronous parallel SGD approach with convergence guarantee. The method has a much faster convergence rate than HOGWILD.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no related research about asynchronous parallel method for large margin models. McDonald et.al (2010) proposed a distributed structured perceptron algorithm but it needs multi-machine. We first propose a generic online parallel learning framework for large margin models. In our framework, each thread updates the weight vector independently without any extra operation or lock. Besides, we analyze the performance of structured perceptron and Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) in our framework. The contribution of our framework can be outlined as follow:\n• Our framework is generic and suitable for most of the large margin algorithms. It is sim-\nple and can be easily implemented on existing systems with large margin models.\n• The framework does not use extra memory. Experiments show that the memory cost is no\nmore than single-thread algorithm. Besides, the parallel framework works on a shared memory system so we have no need to care about the data exchange."

      "text" : "Suppose we have a training dataset with N samples denoted as {(xi, yi)} N i=1, where xi is a sequence (usually a sentence in natural language\nAlgorithm 1 The Generic Parallel Framework Input: training set S with N samples 1: initialize: weight vector w = 0, v = 0 2: for t = 1 to T do 3: Random shuffle training set S 4: Split training set into K part {Si} K i=1\n5: for all threads parallel do\n6: Inference for update term Φi 7: Update wi+1 with Φi 8: v = v + wi+1 9: i = i+ 1 10: end for 11: end for Output: the learned weights w∗ = v/(N ∗ T )\nprocessing) and yi is a structure on sequence xi (usually a tag list or a tree). The whole dataset is trained with T passes. We denote the weight vector as w and after ith update the weight vector will be wi.\nIn each pass, the online learning algorithm will shuffle the dataset after which the weight vector is updated with each sample in the dataset. Generally, gradient-based algorithms like SGD take a lot of time to compute the gradient. Large margin algorithms like perceptron and MIRA spend most of time in decoding. Popular approach to speed up inference process is to take approximate inference instead of exact inference (Huang et al., 2012). However, we can parallel the inference process of several samples and update asynchronously to further accelerate the training process (Sun, 2016).\nIn our parallel framework, we split the dataset into k parts and then assign these split datasets to k threads. Each thread updates independently with a shared memory system. After that, we average the weight vector by the number of iterations (not the number of threads as some distributed parallel algorithms). We can see that our approach has no more computation than large margin algorithms, so it is a simple parallel framework. Since the whole framework runs on a shared memory system, there are mainly two problems about this framework: First, several threads update at the same time so it may be closer to minibatch algorithm instead of online learning algorithm intuitively. Whether the parallel framework will affect the convergence rate of online learning algorithm is a problem. Second, when a thread is working, the weight vector may be overwritten by other threads. Whether it will lead to divergence is an-\nother problem need to be analyzed.\nFor the first problem, Lian et.al (2015) proved that the convergence rate will not be affected under the parallel SGD framework. Our experiments also support that the convergence rate of large margin algorithms is still the same in our parallel framework. For the second problem, Recht et.al (2011) shows that individual SGD steps only modify a small part of the decision variable so memory overwrites are rare and barely any error will be made into the computation. We will also explain this problem on large margin models in Section 3. Experiments show that our parallel algorithm is so robust that the interference among threads will not affect the convergence. In our framework we also average the weight vector by the number of iterations. One reason is that Collins (2002) explains that averaging parameter helps advoid overfitting. Another advantage is that we can ensure every update will contribute to the final learned weight vector."

      "text" : "Crammer and Singer (2003) developed a large margin algorithm called MIRA and later extended by Taskar et.al (?). The algorithm has been widely used in many popular models (McDonald et al., 2005). It tries to minimize ‖w‖ so that the margin between output score s(x, z) and correct score s(x, y) is larger than the loss of output structure:\nminimize‖w‖\nst. ∀z ∈ GEN(x) s(x, y)− s(x, z) ≥ L(y, z)\nDuring the inference process, the algorithm manages to find out the output structure with the highest score. However, in our parallel framework weight vector can be overwritten so we may not get the 1-best structure. Actually, it does not matter because the binary feature representation is so sparse that the output score is still close to 1-best score. We can say that the margin between output score and correct score is larger than the loss, so the margin between 1-best score and correct score will still satisfy the constrain."

It proves to be an effective and efficient structured prediction algorithm with convergence guarantee for separable data (Sun et al., 2009, 2013; Sun, 2015). We denote the binary feature representation of sequence x and structure y to be f(x, y). The set of structure candidates for the input sequence x is denoted as GEN(x). Structured perceptron searches the space of GEN(x) and finds the output z with highest score f(x, z) · w. The weight vector w then updates with the output z.\nIn our parallel framework, the inference and update of different samples runs parallel. The inference and update for structured perceptron can be descibed as:\nz = argmaxt∈GEN(x)f(x, t) · w (1)\nw = w + f(x, y)− f(x, z) (2)\nDuring the inference, although the weight vector may be modified, we can still ensure that the score of the output z is higher than that of correct structure y. Huang et.al (2012) proved that if each update involves a violation (the output has a higher model score than the correct structure), structured perceptron algorithm is bound to converge. Therefore, our parallel framework on structure perceptron is effective theoretically."
