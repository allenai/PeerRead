An example for a pattern is a time-series representing a heart rate during a specific time-range, wherein the time-series is a sequence of data points that represent the changes in the heart rate values. A bio-medical simulator system was developed to acquire a collection of 7,871 price patterns of financial instruments. The financial instruments traded in realtime on three American stock exchanges1, NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX, simulate bio-medical measurements. The system simulates a human in which each price pattern represents one bio-medical sensor. Data provided during trading hours from the stock exchanges allowed real-time classification.

INTRODUCTION\neal-time sensing using wearable technologies includes variety of measurements such as heart rate, brain activity, and hydration levels to name a few. Examples for humangenerated sensing and monitoring systems provided by [1] include: [2]-[6]. [7] provide a comprehensive review of variety of systems and sensing devices, including bio-chemical sensors for collecting fluid [8][9], accelerometers to identify epilepsy seizures [10], accelerometers to monitor COPD [11], photoplethysmographic bio-sensors to monitor cardiovascular activity [12]-[14], and pulse oximeters to monitor oxygen saturation [15]. Additional examples include using Complex Event Processing with bio-sensors, RFID, and accelerometers to evaluate health-related events [16], Zigbee modules to monitor temperature and heart rate [17], Electromyography (EMG), Electrodermal activity (EDA), and pressure respiration\nManuscript received May 12, 2013. In March 2013, Dr. Kartoun accepted a position as research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital’s Shaw Laboratory, working also with Harvard. He plans to conduct research related to data mining and predictive modeling, using patient electronic medical records (EMR) data. Prior to that Dr. Kartoun was with the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 84105, ISRAEL, and with Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA, U.S.A.

An example for a continuous assessment of EDA outside of a laboratory setting is provided in [20].\nNeuroGlasses is a wearable physiological signal monitoring system [21]—the system acquires health-related signals by using OCZ NIA, a head-band with one neurosensory; a location-aware signal correction and a feature-based reconstruction approach were proposed to compensate signal distortion due to the variation of sensor location and other noises. [22] describe an implementation of decision tree and artificial neural network algorithms to classify activities such as walking, running, and cycling; a data collection system was developed and provided measurements to 18 different signals, such as, altitude, audio, chest and wrist acceleration, EKG, humidity, light intensity, heart rate, respiratory effort, and skin temperature. A related study focused on human movement monitoring introduces a method for temporal parameter extraction. The method, Hidden Markov Event Model (HMEM), can be adapted to new movements and new sensors and was validated on a walking data-set by using sensors such as triaxial accelerometer and biaxial gyroscope [23].\nOne limitation of current wearable monitoring and prediction systems is that they are designed to acquire information using specific one or several sensors to address a certain medical condition. The ability to add other sensors to an existing system of the same type or other types is limited and usually requires re-designing the systems. Another limitation is the complexity of fusioning the measurements acquired by multiple sensors. Fusioning is even more challenging as technology is advancing rapidly and new types of sensors are becoming available, e.g., Q-Sensor [24]. Systems that were already developed to fusion several existing sensors are limited in scaling up with new types of sensors. Further, existing systems are typically capable of analyzing sensing information acquired by only a few sensors. In the era of social networks and big data it is expected that the ability to measure human-generated signals both quantitatively and qualitatively will significantly improve over the next few years. The improved ability will allow the systems to provide higher quality of monitoring and better prediction accuracy of undesired medical situations (e.g., an epilepsy seizure, a heart attack, or an occurrence of a fall).\nAnother limitation of existing systems is their relatively simple computational mechanisms which are usually based on observing events, i.e., a certain sensor measurement value is\nR\nabove or below a pre-defined threshold, or they are based on analyzing short patterns of measurements, usually for one sensor at a time.\nAnother limitation relates to discovering associations between the measurements, i.e. to classify measurements from different sensors, for example, to identify a pair comprised of similarly behaving time-series representing skin conductivity and heart rate. Such ability has not yet been sufficiently addressed.\nThis paper describes a time-series based classification approach to identify similarities in patterns. An example of a pattern would be a time-series of values measured by a certain sensor during a specific time period, wherein the time-series is a sequence of data points that represent the change in the sensor value (e.g., measured every second). The approach is based on applying new machine learning methods: selflabeling and similarity ranking that allow classifying of timeseries regardless of type and quantity. The paper describes further the implementation of a simulation system which is capable of acquiring a large collection of time-series and to identify similarities among the time-series. The system is based on three stages of operation: sampling, classification, and tracking. To evaluate the system’s capabilities, a collection of 7,871 price patterns of financial instruments traded in real-time on three American stock exchanges, NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX, was used. No existing biomedical-based system is capable of sampling and analyzing such a large amount of time-series representing sensors in realtime, as it is not yet possible to connect more than a few sensors to a one person. The simulation system could then be observed as a human in which the financial instruments are considered as simulated bio-medical measurements.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows: after introducing the bio-medical simulator in Section II, the time-series classification methods are detailed in Section III. Section IV presents an experiment to validate the classification accuracy. Discussion and conclusions are provided in Sections V and VI, respectively."

      "heading" : "B. Decision Tree Learning",
      "text" : "The patterns are stored and modified using a data preparation procedure as described through (1) - (4). The procedure described through (1) - (4) is applied by acting several tables stored in a database. Values according to (3) and their corresponding labels (4) are served as an input for a\nstandard supervised learning algorithm. The supervised learning algorithm used is a decision tree learning algorithm. The algorithm is applied on the entire price patterns of all financial instruments considered once the sampling stage ends. 7,871 financial instruments are considered for classification including AMEX, NYSE, and NASDAQ. The total time range for classification depends on a time interval value set by the user through the user interface. A time interval, for example, equals to 10 seconds represents a sampling period of one minute considering that the number of samples is a pre-defined value equals to six ( 6n in (3) and (4)) 2.\nAn example for a partial representation of a decision tree is shown in Fig. 3 3 . A decision tree is a data structure that consists of branches and leaves. Leaves (also denoted as “nodes”) represent classifications, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those classifications. Each node has a unique title to distinguish the node from other nodes that the tree is composed of. A node contains two or more records. Each record represents a financial instrument, its feature values (2) and its predictor value (4). The fewer records in a node (the minimum is two), the less this node varies, i.e., a node with fewer records is more likely to represent a better classification between the financial instruments that the node contains.\nThe number of nodes in a generated tree depends on the number of time-steps and the number of financial instruments considered. The classification accuracy of the algorithm depends on its input parameters. Parameters for a decision tree algorithm include complexity penalty, to control the growth of the decision tree, and minimum support, to determine the minimal number of leaf cases required to generate a split.\n2 Sampling period could be longer, depending on Internet communication latency and on potential data access delays. 3 The figure presents a decision tree that includes 344 of the entire set of 7,871 time-series considered. The reason for that—time-series that do not contain all prices for the period considered are omitted from the analysis for that time range (typically six values). Additionally, the algorithm omits financial instruments with insignificant trading activity during the sampling.\nSetting the desired values for the decision tree algorithm parameters depends on the tradeoff between classification accuracy and computational speed. Classifying with perfect or close to perfect accuracy a large number of time-series may require an unfeasible processing time. To reduce the calculation time, the growth of the decision tree is controlled by increasing the complexity penalty level (this decreases the number of splits) and by increasing the level of minimum support. On one hand, controlling the growth of the tree improves computation performance. On the other hand, controlling the growth of the tree may affect classification accuracy.\nWhen the sampling stage ends, a decision tree based classification is performed. For the amount of data considered here, a typical size for one decision tree is in the range of several-hundred nodes. The decision tree includes a main node that contains all financial instruments. The decision tree algorithm generates rules. The rules are based on values for the financial instruments (price change) for every two subsequent samples; as described through (1) - (4). Some nodes in the tree split to two sub-nodes, i.e., children, and other nodes do not. A split, if occurs, is based on the generated rules and separates a group of financial instruments to two smaller groups. For example, for the main node that consists of 344 financial instruments, two rules were generated 4 :\n T4_T3 < -0.052 or >= 0.35, and,\n T4_T3 >= -0.052 and < 0.35.\nSimilarly, other generated rules split nodes across the tree. The decision tree classification results for the sampling stage considered are stored in a database."

      "text" : "To receive a similarity for a financial instrument comprising together a pair, a similarity ranking method is applied (Fig. 4). Consider a financial instrument—the financial instrument denoted as S queries the decision tree data structure.\nSimilarly behaving financial instruments are identified and sorted according to the number of occurrences at the nodes that also contain S . The financial instrument with the highest\ncounter value is picked to be part of the pair. In case two or more financial instruments with an identical counter value were found then one of them is picked arbitrarily.\n4 Tn_Tn-1 for a financial instrument represents the difference given in percent between the price sampled at time Tn to the price sampled at time Tn1."

      "text" : "Providing classifications for signals or time-series is well discussed in the literature; however, what is significant here as described through (1) - (4) is a self-labeling enhancement that facilitates the application of supervised learning methods on unlabeled data sets. Another significance facilitates classifying time-series—the similarity ranking, which applied on a decision tree learning algorithm to classify time-series regardless of type and quantity.\nThe methods described in the paper as applied on financial time-series could be implemented on a large collection of bio-\nmedical sensors—the simulator presented in the paper allows\nsampling and classifying unspecified number of time-series measurements. Additional financial readings, i.e., sensor readings, could be acquired without modifying the design and without having to develop additional software components. Another advantage of the methods is that they have the potential to reduce the complexity that involves in fusioning the measurements acquired by multiple sensors. The ability to fusion readings from multiple and unspecified number of sensors, including new types of sensors, has the potential to include additional sensors as part of an existing monitoring bio-medical system (e.g., Q-Sensor [24]), and may include in the future sensors that not yet fully been explored. Examples for futuristic sensors include physical-measuring wearable sensors that measure the level of dehydration [25], sensors that measure the level of exposure to sunlight, and sensors that measure weight and height. Examples for futuristic sensors include also psychological-measuring wearable sensors that measure the level of patience, sensors that measure the level of boredom, and sensors that measure the level of fatigue.\nAnother advantage of the methods described in this paper relates to discovering associations between different sensor measurements, for example, to identify similarities between cardiovascular patterns and oxygen saturation patterns or to discover associations between levels of skin conductivity measured in multiple human body areas."

An example for a pattern is a time-series representing a heart rate during a specific time-range, wherein the time-series is a sequence of data points that represent the changes in the heart rate values. A bio-medical simulator system was developed to acquire a collection of 7,871 price patterns of financial instruments. The financial instruments traded in realtime on three American stock exchanges, NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX, simulate bio-medical measurements. The system simulates a human in which each price pattern represents one bio-medical sensor. Data provided during trading hours from the stock exchanges allowed real-time classification. Classification is based on new machine learning techniques: self-labeling, which allows the application of supervised learning methods on unlabeled time-series and similarity ranking, which applied on a decision tree learning algorithm to classify time-series regardless of type and quantity.",
