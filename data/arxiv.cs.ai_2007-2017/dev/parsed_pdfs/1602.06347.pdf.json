      "text" : "gence, with an increasingly important impact in industrial and other real-world applications. In a MAS, autonomous agents interact to pursue personal interests and/or to achieve common objectives. Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) have emerged as a prominent agent model to govern the agents’ autonomous behavior, where both algorithms and communication models are driven by the structure of the specific problem. During the last decade, several extensions to the DCOP model have been proposed to enable support of MAS in complex, realtime, and uncertain environments.\nThis survey provides an overview of the DCOP model, offering a classification of its multiple extensions and addressing both resolution methods and applications that find a natural mapping within each class of DCOPs. The proposed classification suggests several future perspectives for DCOP extensions, and identifies challenges in the design of efficient resolution algorithms, possibly through the adaptation of strategies from different areas."

      "text" : "An agent can be defined as an entity (or computer program) that behaves autonomously within an arbitrary system in the pursuit of some goals (Wooldridge, 2009). A multi-agent system (MAS) is a system where multiple agents interact in the pursuit of such goals. Within a MAS, agents may interact with each other directly, via communication acts, or indirectly, by acting on the shared environment. In addition, agents may decide to cooperate, to achieve a common goal, or to compete, to serve their own interests at the expense of other agents. In particular, agents may form cooperative teams, which can in turn compete against other teams of agents. Multi-agent systems play an important role in distributed artificial intelligence, thanks to their ability to model a wide variety of real-world scenarios, where information and control are decentralized and distributed among a set of agents.\nc©1993 AI Access Foundation.

Agents may interact with each other—the dotted lines in the figure define the interaction graph. Agents may move away from the current position—the directional arrows illustrate such actions. In addition, various events that dynamically obstruct the sensors of the agents (e.g., the presence of an obstacle along the sensing range of an agent) may dynamically occur.\nWithin a MAS, an agent is: • Autonomous, as it operates without the direct intervention of humans or other entities and has\nfull control over its own actions and internal state (e.g., in the example, an agent can decide to sense, to move, etc.); • Interactant, in the sense that it interacts with other agents in order to achieve its objectives\n(e.g., in the example, agents may exchange information concerning results of sensing activities); • Reactive, as it responds to changes that occur in the environment and/or to the requests from\nother agents (e.g., in the example, agents may react with a move to the sudden appearance of obstacles). • Proactive, because of its goal-driven behavior, which allows the agent to take initiatives beyond\nthe reactions in response to its environment. Agent architectures are the fundamental mechanisms underlying the autonomous agent components, supporting their behavior in real-world, dynamic and uncertain environments. Currently, agent architectures based on Decision Theory, Game Theory, and Constraint Programming have successfully been developed and are popular in the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community.\nDecision Theory (DT) (Raiffa, 1968) assumes that the agent and the environment are inherently uncertain, and DT models such uncertainty explicitly. Acting in complex and dynamic environments requires agents to deal with various sources of uncertainty. The Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) framework (Bernstein, Givan, Immerman, & Zilberstein, 2002) is one of the most general multi-agent frameworks, focused on team coordination in presence of uncertainty about agents’ actions and observations. The ability to capture a wide range of complex scenarios makes Dec-POMDPs of central interest within MAS research. However, the result of this generality is a high complexity for generating optimal solutions. Dec-POMDPs are non-deterministic exponential (NEXP) complete (Bernstein et al., 2002), even for two-agent problems, and scalability\nremains a critical challenge (Amato, Chowdhary, Geramifard, Ure, & Kochenderfer, 2013).\nGame Theory (GT) (Binmore, 1992) studies interactions between self-interested agents, aiming at maximizing the welfare of the participants. Some of the most compelling applications of game theory to MAS have been in the area of auctions and negotiations (Kraus, 1997; Noriega & Sierra, 1999; Parsons & Wooldridge, 2002). Such approaches model the trading process by which agents can reach agreements on matters of common interest, using market oriented and cooperative mechanisms, such as reaching Nash Equilibria (NEs). Typical resolution approaches aim at deriving a set of equilibrium strategies for each agent, such that, when these strategies are employed, no agent can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategies. A limitation of GT-based approaches is the lack of an agent’s ability to reason upon a global objective, as the underlying model relies on the interactions of self-interested agents.\nConstraint Programming (CP) (Rossi, Beek, & Walsh, 2006) aims at solving decision-making problems formulated as optimization problems of some real-world objective. Constraint programs use the notion of constraints—i.e., relations among entities of the problems (variables)—in both problem modeling and problem solving. CP relies on inference techniques that prevent the exploration of those parts of the solution search space whose assignments to variables are inconsistent with the constraints and/or dominated with respect to the objective function. Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) (Modi, Shen, Tambe, & Yokoo, 2005; Petcu & Faltings, 2005b; Gershman, Meisels, & Zivan, 2009; Yeoh & Yokoo, 2012) are problems where agents need to coordinate their value assignments, in a decentralized manner, to optimize their objective functions. DCOPs focus on attaining a global optimum given the interaction graph of a collection of agents. This approach is flexible and can effectively model a wide range of problems. In general, problem solving and communication strategies are directly linked in DCOPs. This feature makes DCOP’s algorithmic components suitable for exploiting the structure of the interaction graph to generate efficient solutions.\nThe absence of a framework to model dynamic problems and uncertainty makes DCOPs unsuitable at solving certain classes of multi-agent problems, such as those characterized by action uncertainty and dynamic environments. However, since its original introduction, the DCOP model has undergone a process of continuous evolution to capture diverse characteristics of agent behavior and the environment in which they operate. Researchers have proposed a number of DCOP frameworks that differ from each other in terms of expressivity and classes of problem they can target, extending the DCOP model to handle both dynamic and uncertain environments. However, current research has not explored how the different DCOP frameworks relate to each other within the general MAS context, which is critical to understand: (a) What resolution methods could be borrowed from other MAS paradigms, and (b) What applications can be most effectively modeled within each framework. While there are important existing surveys for Distributed Constraint Satisfaction (Yokoo & Hirayama, 2000) and Distributed Constraint Optimization (Meisels, 2008), this survey aims to comprehensively analyze and categorize the different DCOP frameworks proposed by the MAS community. We do so by presenting an extensive review of the DCOP model and its extensions, the different resolution methods, as well as a number of applications modeled within each particular DCOP extension. This analysis also provides opportunities to identify open areas and discuss future directions in the general DCOP research area.\nThis survey paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide an overview on two relevant Constraint Satisfaction models and their generalization to the distributed cases. We then introduce, in Section 3, DCOPs, give an overview on the representation and coordination models adopted in DCOP resolution, and propose a classification of the different variants of DCOPs based on the characteristics of the agents and the environment. Section 4 presents the classical DCOP model as well as two notable extensions characterized, respectively, by asymmetric function utilities and multi-objective optimization. In Section 5, we present DCOP models where the environment changes over time. In Section 6, we discuss DCOP models in which agents act under uncertainty and may have partial knowledge of the environment in which they act. Section 7 discusses DCOP models in which agents are non-cooperative. For each of these models, we introduce their formal definitions, related concepts, and resolution algorithms; Table 6 summarizes the complexity of the various classes of problems. In Section 8, we describe a number of applications that have been proposed in the DCOP literature. Section 9 provides a critical review on the various DCOP variants surveyed and focuses on their applicability. Additionally, it describes some potential future directions for research. Finally, Section 10 provides some concluding remarks. To facilitate the reading of this survey, Table 1 summarizes the most commonly used symbols and notations."

      "text" : "Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) (Golomb & Baumert, 1965; Mackworth & Freuder, 1985; Apt, 2003; Rossi et al., 2006) are decision problems that involve the assignment of values to variables, under a set of specified constraints on how variable values should be related to each other. A number of problems can be formulated as CSPs, including resource allocation, vehicle routing, circuit diagnosis, scheduling, and bioinformatics. Over the years, CSPs have become the paradigm of choice to address hard combinatorial problems, drawing and integrating insights from diverse domains, including Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research (Rossi et al., 2006).\nFormally, a CSP is a tuple 〈X,D,C〉, where: • X={x1, . . . , xn} is a finite set of variables. • D = {D1, . . . , Dn} is a set of finite domains for the variables in X, with Di being the set of\npossible values for the variable xi. • C is a finite set of constraints over subsets of X, where a constraint ci, defined on the k variables xi1 , . . . , xik , is a relation ci ⊆ \"kj=1Dij , where {i1, . . . , ik} ⊆ {1, . . . , n}. The set of variables xi = {xi1 , . . . , xik} is referred to as the scope of ci.1 ci is called a unary constraint if k = 1 and a binary constraint if k = 2. For all other values of k, the constraint is called a k-ary constraint.2\nA partial assignment is a value assignment for a proper subset of variables from X that is consistent with their respective domains, i.e., it is a partial function σ : X → ⋃n i=1Di such that, for each xj ∈ X, if σ(xj) is defined, then σ(xj) ∈ Dj . An assignment is complete if it assigns a value to each variable in X. We will use the notation σ to denote a complete assignment, and, for a set of variables V = {xi1 , . . . , xih} ⊆ X, σV = 〈σ(xi1), . . . , σ(xih)〉 to denote the projection of the values in σ associated to the variables in V, where i1 < · · · < ih. The goal in a CSP is to find a complete assignment σ such that, for each ci ∈ C, σxi ∈ ci, that is, a complete assignment that satisfies all the problem constraints. Such a complete assignment is called a solution of the CSP."

      "heading" : "2.2 Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problems",
      "text" : "A solution of a CSP must satisfy all its constraints. In many practical cases, however, it is not possible to satisfy all constraints of a problem. At the same time, it is desirable to consider complete assignments whose constraints can be violated (according to a violation degree) and in which preferences among them can be expressed. To faithfully represent such properties, researchers introduced the notion of Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problems (WCSPs) (Shapiro & Haral-\n1. We will assume the presence of a fixed ordering of variables. 2. A constraint with k = 3 is also called a ternary constraint and a constraint with k = n is also called a global\nconstraint.\nick, 1981; Larrosa, 2002), which are problems whose constraints are considered as preferences, specifying to what extent they are satisfied (or violated).\nA WCSP is a tuple 〈X,D,F〉, where X and D are the set of variables and their domains as defined in a CSP, and F is a set of weighted constraints. A weighted constraint fi ∈ F is a function, fi : \"xj∈xi Dj → R+ ∪ {⊥}, where xi ⊆ X is the scope of fi and ⊥ is a special element used to denote that a given combination of values for the variables in xi is not allowed, and it has the property that a+⊥ = ⊥+ a = ⊥, for all a ∈ R+. The cost of an assignment σ is the sum of the evaluation of the constraints involving all the variables in σ. A solution is a complete assignment with cost different from ⊥, and an optimal solution is a solution with minimal cost.\nThus, a WCSP is a generalization of a CSP which, in turn, can be seen as a WCSP whose constraints use exclusively the costs 0 and ⊥. The terms WCSP and Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) have been used interchangeably in the literature and the use of the latter term has been widely adopted in the recent years."

Formally, a DisCSP is described by a tuple 〈A,X,D,C, α〉, where X, D, and C are the set of variables, their domains, and the set of constraints, as defined in a CSP; A={a1, . . . , am} is a finite set of autonomous agents; and α : X → A is a surjective function, from variables to agents, which assigns the control of each variable x ∈ X to an agent α(x). The goal in a DisCSP is to find a complete assignment that satisfies all the constraints of the problem.\nDisCSPs can be seen as an extension of CSPs to the multi-agent case, where agents communicate with each other to assign values to the variables they control so as to satisfy all the problem constraints. For a more detailed treatment of the argument we address the reader to (Rossi et al., 2006) (Chapter 20)."

DCOPs can also be viewed as an extension of the COP framework to the multi-agent case, where agents control variables and constraints, and they need to coordinate the value assignment for the variables they control so as to optimize a global objective function. We formally introduce the DCOP framework in the next section."

      "heading" : "3. DCOP Classification",
      "text" : "The DCOP model has undergone a process of continuous evolution to capture diverse characteristics of agent behavior and the environment in which they operate. We propose a classification of DCOP models from a Multi-Agent Systems perspective, which accounts for the different assumptions made about the behavior of agents and their interactions with the environment. The classification is based on the following elements (summarized in Table 2): • Agent Behavior: This parameter captures the stochastic nature of the effects of an action being\nexecuted. In particular, we distinguish between deterministic and stochastic effects. • Agent Knowledge: This parameter captures the knowledge of an agent about its own state and\nthe environment. We distinguish between total and partial (i.e., incomplete) knowledge. • Agent Teamwork: This parameter characterizes the approach undertaken by (teams of) agents\nto solve a distributed problem. It can be either a cooperative resolution approach or a competitive resolution approach. In the former class, all agents cooperate to achieve a common goal (i.e., they all optimize a global cost function). In the latter class, each agent (or team of agents) seeks to achieve its own individual goal (i.e., they each optimize their individual cost functions). • Environment Behavior: This parameter captures the exogenous properties of the environment.\nWe distinguish between deterministic and stochastic responses of the environment to the execution of an action. • Environment Evolution: This parameter captures whether the DCOP is static (i.e., it does not\nchange over time) or dynamic (i.e., it changes over time).

The classical DCOP model is directly inherited from CP and characterized by a static model, a deterministic environment and agent behavior, total agent knowledge, and with cooperative agents. Concepts from auctions and negotiations, traditionally explored in GT, have influenced the DCOP framework, leading to Asymmetric DCOPs, which has asymmetric agent payoffs, and Multi-Objective DCOPs. The DCOP framework has borrowed fundamental DT concepts related to modeling uncertain and dynamic environments, resulting in models like Probabilistic DCOPs and Dynamic DCOPs. Researchers from the DCOP community have also designed solutions that inherit from all of the three communities.\nIn the next sections, we will describe the different DCOP frameworks, starting with classical DCOPs before proceeding to its various extensions. We will focus on a categorization based on three dimensions: Agent knowledge, environment behavior, and environment evolution. We assume a deterministic agent behavior, fully cooperative agent teamwork, and total agent knowledge (unless otherwise specified), as they are, by far, common assumptions adopted by the DCOP community. The DCOP models associated to this categorization are summarized in Table 3. The bottom-right entry of the table is left empty, indicating a promising model with dynamic and uncertain environments that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored yet. There has been only a modest amount of effort in modeling the different aspects of teamwork within the DCOP community. We will describe a formalism that has been adopted to model DCOPs with mixed cooperative and competitive agents in Section 7."

Each function fi represents a factor in a global objective function Fg(X) = ∑k i=1 fi(x\ni). In the DCOP literature, the functions fi are also called constraints, cost functions, utility functions, or reward functions. • α : X → A is a total and onto function, from variables to agents, which assigns the control of\neach variable x ∈ X to an agent α(x). With a slight abuse of notation, we will use α(fi) to denote the set of agents whose variables are involved in the scope of fi, i.e., α(fi) = {α(x) | x ∈ xi}. A partial assignment is a value assignment for a proper subset of variables of X. An assignment is complete if it assigns a value to each variable in X. For a given complete assignment σ, we say that a constraint fi is satisfied by σ if fi(σxi) 6= ⊥. A complete assignment is a solution of a DCOP if it satisfies all its constraints. The goal in a DCOP is to find a solution that minimizes3 the total problem cost expressed by its cost functions:\nσ∗ := argmin σ∈Σ Fg(σ) = argmin σ∈Σ ∑ fi∈F fi(σxi), (1)\nwhere Σ is the state space, defined as the set of all possible solutions. Let us also introduce the following notations. Given an agent ai, we denote with Lai = {xj ∈ X | α(xj) = ai} the set of variables controlled by agent ai, or its local variables, and we denote with Nai = {a′i ∈ A | ai 6= a′i, ∃fj ∈ F, xr, xs ∈ xj . α(xr) = ai ∧ α(xs) = a′i} the set of its neighboring agents. A constraint fi is said to be hard if ∀σ ∈ Σ we have that fi(σxi) ∈ {0,⊥}. Otherwise, the constraint is said to be soft.\nFinding an optimal solution for a classical DCOP is known to be NP-hard (Modi et al., 2005).\n3. Alternatively, one can define a maximization problem by substituting the argmin operator in Equation 1 with argmax. Typically, if the objective functions are referred to as utility functions or reward functions, then the DCOP is a maximization problem. Conversely, if the objective functions are referred to as cost functions, then the DCOP is a minimization problem."

It underlines the agents’ locality of interactions and therefore it is commonly adopted by DCOP resolution algorithms.\nGiven an ordering o on X, we say that a variable xi has a higher priority with respect to a variable xj if xi appears before xj in o. Given a constraint graph GP and an ordering o on its nodes, the induced graph G∗P on o is the graph obtained by connecting nodes, processed in increasing order of priority, to all their higher-priority neighbors. For a given node, the number of higher-priority neighbors is referred to as its width. The induced width w∗o of GP is the maximum width over all the nodes of G∗P on ordering o.\nFigure 4(a) shows an example constraint graph of a DCOP with four agents a1 through a4, each controlling one variable with domain {0,1}.

Edges of GP that are in (respectively out of) ET are called tree edges (respectively backedges).

We use Cai , PCai , Pai , and PPai to denote the set of children, pseudo-children, parent, and pseudo-parents of the agent ai.\nBoth constraint graph and pseudo-tree representations cannot deal explicitly with k-ary constraints (with k > 2). A typical artifact to deal with such constraints in a pseudo-tree representation is to introduce a virtual variable that monitors the value assignments for all the variables in the scope of the constraint, and generates the cost values (Bowring, Tambe, & Yokoo, 2006) – the role of the virtual variables can be delegated to one of the variables participating in the constraint (Pecora, Modi, & Scerri, 2006; Matsui, Matsuo, Silaghi, Hirayama, & Yokoo, 2008).\nFigure 4(b) shows one possible pseudo-tree of the example DCOP in Figure 4(a), where Ca1 = {x2}, PCa1 ={x3}, Pa4 ={x2}, and PPa3 ={x1}.

To do so, they use a similar method as that adopted within pseudo-trees with such constraints: They delegate the control of a factor node to one of the agents controlling a variable in the scope of the constraint. From an algorithmic perspective, the algorithms designed over factor graphs can directly handle k-ary constraints, while algorithms designed over pseudo-trees require changes in the algorithm design so to delegate the control of the k-ary constraints to some particular entity.\nFigure 4(c) shows the factor graph of the example DCOP in Figure 4(a), where each agent ai controls its variable xi and, in addition, a3 controls the constraint f123 and a4 controls constraint f24."

As all these algorithms were originally developed under the assumption that each agent controls exactly one variable, we will describe the properties under this same assumption as well. These properties may change when generalizing the algorithms to allow for agents to control multiple variables, but they will depend on how the algorithms are generalized. Throughout this document, we will often adopt the following notation when discussing the complexity of the algorithms: • n = |X| refers to the number of variables in the problem; in Table 4, n also refers to the number\nof agents in the problem since each agent has exactly one variable; • d = maxDi∈D |Di| refers to the size of the largest domain; • w∗ refers to the induced width of the pseudo-tree; • l = maxai∈A |Nai | refers to the largest number of neighboring agents; and • ` refers to the number of iterations in incomplete algorithms.\nIn addition, each of these classes can be categorized into several groups, depending on the degree of locality exploited by the algorithms, the way local information is updated, and the type of exploration process adopted.

Such approaches explore the concept of partial centralization (Hirayama & Yokoo, 1997; Mailler & Lesser, 2004; Petcu, Faltings, & Mailler, 2007), and thus they are classified as partially centralized algorithms. Typically, partial centralization improves the algorithms’ performance allowing agents to coordinate their local assignments more efficiently. However, such performance enhancement comes with a loss of information privacy, as the centralizing agent needs to be granted access to the local subproblem of other agents in the group (Greenstadt, Grosz, & Smith, 2007; Mailler & Lesser, 2004).

Asynchronous algorithms allow agents to update the assignment for their variables based solely on their local view of the problem, and thus independently from the actual decisions of the other agents (Modi et al., 2005; Farinelli, Rogers, Petcu, & Jennings, 2008; Gershman et al., 2009). In contrast, synchronous algorithms constrain the agents decisions to follow a particular order, typically enforced by the representation structure adopted (Mailler & Lesser, 2004; Petcu & Faltings, 2005b; Pearce & Tambe, 2007).\nSynchronous methods tend to delay the actions of some agents guaranteeing that their local view of the problem is always consistent with that of the other agents. In contrast, asynchronous methods tend to minimize the idle-time of the agents, which in turn can react quickly to each message being processed; however, they provide no guarantee on the consistency of the state of the local view of each agent. Such effect has been studied by Peri and Meisels (2013), concluding that inconsistent agents’ views may cause a negative impact on network load and algorithm performance, and that introducing some level of synchronization may be beneficial for some algorithms, enhancing their performance."

      "text" : "Some of the algorithms described below were originally designed to solve the variant of DCOPs that maximizes rewards, while others solve the variant that minimizes costs. However, the algorithms that maximize rewards can be easily adapted to minimize costs. For consistency, we describe\nthe version of the algorithms that focus on minimization of costs. We also describe their quality, runtime, memory, and communication characteristics as summarized in Table 4.\nSyncBB (Hirayama & Yokoo, 1997). Synchronous Branch-and-Bound (SyncBB) is a complete, synchronous, search-based algorithm that can be considered as a distributed version of a branchand-bound algorithm. It uses a complete ordering of the agents in order to extend a Current Partial Assignment (CPA) via a synchronous communication process. The CPA holds the assignments of all the variables controlled by all the visited agents, and, in addition, functions as a mechanism to propagate bound information. The algorithm prunes those parts of the search space whose solution quality is sub-optimal, by exploiting the bounds that are updated at each step of the algorithm.\nIn the worst case, SyncBB agents performO(dn) number of operations since the lowest priority agent needs to enumerate through all possible value combinations for all variables. While, by default, it is not an anytime algorithm, it can be easily extended to have an anytime property since it is a branch-and-bound algorithm. The memory requirement per SyncBB agent is O(n) since the lowest priority agent will need to store the value assignment of all variables. In terms of communication requirement, SyncBB agents send O(dn) number of messages; specifically, the lowest priority agent will enumerate through all possible value combination for all variables and sends a message for each combination. The largest message, which contains the value assignment of all variables, is of size O(n). Finally, SyncBB agents only communicate through peer-to-peer connections (i.e., only to their neighboring agents) and do not broadcast.\nAFB (Gershman et al., 2009). Asynchronous Forward Bounding (AFB) is a complete, asynchronous, search-based algorithm that can be considered as an asynchronous version of SyncBB. In this algorithm, agents communicate their cost estimates, which in turn are used to compute bounds and prune the search space. In AFB, agents extend a CPA sequentially, provided that the lower bound on their costs does not exceed the global upper bound, that is, the cost of the best solution found so far. Each agent performing an assignment (the “assigning” agent) triggers asynchronous checks of bounds, by sending forward messages containing copies of the CPA to agents that have not yet assigned their variables. The unassigned agents that receive a CPA estimate the lower bound of the CPA given their local view of the constraint graph and send their estimates back to the agent that originated the forward message. This assigning agent will receive these estimates asynchronously and aggregate them into an updated lower bound. If the updated lower bound exceeds the current upper bound, the agent initiates a backtracking phase.\nThe runtime, memory, and communication characteristics of AFB are identical to those of SyncBB for the same reasons. The only exception is that AFB agents broadcast some of their messages while SyncBB agents do not.\nADOPT (Modi et al., 2005). Asynchronous Distributed OPTimization (ADOPT) is a complete, asynchronous, search-based algorithm that can be considered as a distributed version of a memorybounded best-first search algorithm. It makes use of a DFS pseudo-tree ordering of the agents. The algorithm relies on maintaining, in each agent, lower and upper bounds on the solution cost for the subtree rooted at its node in the DFS tree. Agents explore partial assignments in best-first order, that is, in increasing lower bound order. They use COST messages (propagated upwards in the\nDFS pseudo-tree) and THRESHOLD and VALUE messages (propagated downwards in the tree) to iteratively tighten the lower and upper bounds, until the lower bound of the minimum cost solution is equal to its upper bound. ADOPT agents store lower bounds as thresholds, which can be used to prune partial assignments that are provably sub-optimal.\nSimilar to SyncBB and AFB, ADOPT agents perform O(dn) number of operations since the lowest priority agent needs to enumerate through all possible value combinations for all variables when the pseudo-tree degenerates into a pseudo-chain. It is also not an anytime algorithm as it is a best-first search algorithm. The memory requirement per ADOPT agent is O(n+ ld), where O(n) is used to store a context, which is the value assignment of all higher-priority variables, and O(ld) is used to store the lower and upper bounds for each domain value and variable belonging to the agent’s child agents. Finally, its communication characteristics are also identical to that of SyncBB and for the same reasons as in SyncBB.\nADOPT has been extended in several ways. In particular, BnB-ADOPT (Yeoh, Felner, & Koenig, 2010; Gutierrez & Meseguer, 2012b) uses a branch-and-bound method to reduce the amount of computation performed during search, and ADOPT(k) combines both ADOPT and BnBADOPT into an integrated algorithm (Gutierrez, Meseguer, & Yeoh, 2011). There are also extensions that trade solution optimality for smaller runtimes (Yeoh, Sun, & Koenig, 2009a), extensions that use more memory for smaller runtimes (Yeoh, Varakantham, & Koenig, 2009b), and extensions that maintain soft arc-consistency (Bessiere, Gutierrez, & Meseguer, 2012; Bessiere, Brito, Gutierrez, & Meseguer, 2014; Gutierrez & Meseguer, 2012a; Gutierrez, Lee, Lei, Mak, & Meseguer, 2013).\nFinally, the No-Commitment Branch and Bound (NCBB) algorithm, proposed by Chechetka and Sycara (2006), can be considered as a variant of ADOPT and SyncBB. Similar to ADOPT, NCBB agents exploit the structure defined by a pseudo-tree order to decompose the global cost function. This allow the agents to search non-intersecting parts of the search space concurrently. Another main feature of NCBB is the eager propagation of lower bounds on solution cost: An NCBB agent propagates its lower bound every time it learns about its ancestors’ assignments. This feature provides an efficient pruning of the search space (Chechetka & Sycara, 2006). The runtime, memory, and communication characteristics of NCBB are the same as those of ADOPT except that NCBB is an anytime algorithm.\nConcFB (Netzer, Grubshtein, & Meisels, 2012). Concurrent Forward Bounding (ConcFB) is a complete, asynchronous, search-based algorithm that essentially runs multiple parallel versions of AFB concurrently. By running multiple concurrent search procedures, it is able to quickly find a solution, apply a forward bounding process to detect regions of the search space to prune, and to dynamically create new search processes when detecting promising sub-spaces. Similar to AFB, it uses a complete ordering of agents and variables instead of pseudo-trees. As such, it is able to simplify the management of reordering heuristics, which can provide substantial speed up to the search process (Zivan & Meisels, 2006).\nThe algorithm operates as follows: Each agent maintains a global upper bound, which is updated during the search process. The highest-priority agent begins the process by generating a\nnumber of different search processes (SP), one for each value of its variable. It then sends an LB Request message to all unassigned agents. This LB Request message contains the current CPA and triggers a calculation of the lower bounds of the receiving agents, which are sent back to the sender agent via a LB Report message. If the sum of the aggregated costs and the current CPA cost is no smaller than the current upper bound, the agent selects another value for its variable and repeats the process. If the agent has exhausted all value assignments for its variable, then it backtracks, sending the CPA to the last assigning agent. If the CPA cost is lower than the current upper bound, then it forwards the CPA message to the next non-assigned agent. Upon receiving a CPA message, the agent repeats the above process. When the lowest-priority agent finds a solution and finds a new upper bound, it broadcasts the upper bound via a UB message, which is then stored by each each agent.\nNetzer et al. (2012) described a series of enhancements that can be used to speed up the search process of ConcFB, including dynamic variable ordering and dynamic splitting. Note that despite the process within a subproblem is carried out in a synchronous fashion, different subproblems are explored independently. Thus, the agents act asynchronously and concurrently. The runtime, memory, and communication characteristics of ConcFB are identical to those of AFB since it is essentially an algorithm that runs multiple parallel versions of AFB concurrently.\nDPOP (Petcu & Faltings, 2005b). Distributed Pseudo-tree Optimization Procedure (DPOP) is a complete, synchronous, inference-based algorithm that makes use of a DFS pseudo-tree ordering of the agents. It involves three phases. In the first phase, the agents order themselves into a DFS pseudo-tree. In the second phase, called the UTIL propagation phase, each agent, starting from the leaves of the pseudo-tree, aggregates the costs in its subtree for each value combination of variables in its separator.4 The aggregated costs are encoded in a UTIL message, which is propagated from children to their parents, up to the root. In the third phase, called the VALUE propagation phase, each agent, starting from the root of the pseudo-tree, selects the optimal value for its variable. The optimal values are calculated based on the UTIL messages received from the agent’s children and the VALUE message received from its parent. The VALUE messages contain the optimal values of the agents and are propagated from parents to their children, down to the leaves of the pseudo-tree.\nIn the worst case, DPOP agents perform O(dw ∗ ) number of operations. When an agent optimizes for each value combination of variables in its separator, it takes O(dw ∗ ) operations since there are w∗ variables in the separator set in the worst case. It is not an anytime algorithm as it terminates upon finding its first solution, which is an optimal solution. The memory requirement per DPOP agent is O(dw ∗ ) since it needs to store all value combinations of variables in its separator. In terms of communication requirement, DPOP agents send O(n) messages in total; O(n) UTIL messages are propagated up the pseudo-tree and O(n) VALUE messages are propagated down the pseudo-tree. The largest message sent by an agent, which contains the aggregated costs in its subtree for each value combination of variables in its separator, is O(dw ∗ ). Finally, DPOP agents only\n4. The separator of ai contains all ancestors of ai in the pseudo-tree (through tree edges or backedges) that are connected to ai or one of its descendants.\ncommunicate through peer-to-peer connections (i.e., only to their neighboring agents) and do not broadcast.\nDPOP has also been extended in several ways to enhance its performance and capabilities. ODPOP and MB-DPOP trade runtimes for smaller memory requirements (Petcu & Faltings, 2006, 2007a), A-DPOP trades solution optimality for smaller runtimes (Petcu & Faltings, 2005a), SSDPOP trades runtime for increased privacy (Greenstadt et al., 2007), PC-DPOP trades privacy for smaller runtimes (Petcu et al., 2007), H-DPOP propagates hard constraints for smaller runtimes (Kumar, Petcu, & Faltings, 2008), BrC-DPOP enforces branch consistency for smaller runtimes (Fioretto, Le, Yeoh, Pontelli, & Son, 2014), and ASP-DPOP is a declarative version of DPOP that uses Answer Set Programming (Le, Son, Pontelli, & Yeoh, 2015).\nOptAPO (Mailler & Lesser, 2004). Optimal Asynchronous Partial Overlay (OptAPO) is a complete, asynchronous, search-based algorithm. It trades agent privacy for smaller runtimes through partial centralization. It employs a cooperative mediation schema, where agents can act as mediators and propose value assignments to other agents. In particular, agents check if there is a conflict with some neighboring agent. If a conflict is found, the agent with the highest priority acts as a mediator. During mediation, OptAPO solves subproblems using a centralized branch-and-boundbased search, and when solutions of overlapping subproblems still have conflicting assignments, the solving agents increase the degree of centralization to resolve them. By sharing their knowledge with centralized entities, agents can improve their local decisions, reducing the communication costs. For instance, the algorithm has been shown to be superior to ADOPT on simple combinatorial problems (Mailler & Lesser, 2004). However, it is possible that several mediators solve overlapping problems, duplicating efforts (Petcu et al., 2007), which can be a bottleneck especially for dense problems.\nIn the worst case, OptAPO agents perform O(dn) number of operations as a mediator agent may solve the entire problem. Like ADOPT and DPOP, OptAPO is not an anytime algorithm. The memory requirement per OptAPO agent is O(nd) since it needs to store all value combinations of variables in its mediation group, which is of size O(n). In terms of communication requirement, OptAPO agents send O(dn) messages in the worst case, though the number of messages decreases with increasing partial centralization. The size of the messages is bounded by O(d+ n), where in the initialization phase of each mediation step, each agent sends its domain to its neighbors and the list of variables that it seeks to mediate. Finally, the agents only communicate through peer-to-peer connections (i.e., only to their neighboring agents) and do not broadcast.\nThe original version of OptAPO has been shown to be incomplete due to the asynchronicity of the different mediators’ groups, which can lead to race conditions. Grinshpoun and Meisels (2008) proposed a complete variant that remedies this issue."

      "text" : "As some incomplete algorithms were also originally designed to maximize rewards, similar to Section 4.3.5, we also describe variants of these algorithms that minimize costs here to maintain consistency.\nMax-Sum (Farinelli et al., 2008). Max-Sum is an incomplete, synchronous, inference-based algorithm based on belief propagation. It operates on factor graphs by performing a marginalization process of the cost functions, and optimizing the costs for each given variable. This process is performed by recursively propagating messages between variable nodes and functions nodes. The value assignments take into account their impact on the marginalized cost function. Max-Sum is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution in acyclic graphs, but convergence is not guaranteed on cyclic graphs.\nIn the worst case, Max-Sum agents perform O(dl) number of operations in each iteration, where each agent needs to optimize for all value combinations of neighboring variables. It is not an anytime algorithm. The memory requirement per Max-Sum agent isO(dl) since it needs to store all value combinations of neighboring variables. In terms of communication requirement, in the worst case, each Max-Sum agent sendsO(l) messages in each iteration, one to each of its neighbor. Thus, the total number of messages sent across all agents is O(`nl). Each message is of size O(d) as it needs to contain the current aggregated costs of all the agent’s variable’s values. Finally, the agents only communicate through peer-to-peer connections (i.e., only to their neighboring agents) and do not broadcast.\nMax-Sum has also been extended in several ways to improve it. Bounded Max-Sum is able to bound the quality of the solutions found by removing a subset of edges from a cyclic DCOP graph to make it acyclic, and by running Max-Sum to solve the acyclic problem (Rogers, Farinelli, Stranders, & Jennings, 2011), Improved Bounded Max-Sum improves on the error bounds (Rollon & Larrosa, 2012), and Max-Sum ADVP guarantees convergence in acyclic graphs through a twophase value propagation phase (Zivan & Peled, 2012). Max-Sum and its extensions have been successfully employed to solve a number of large scale, complex MAS applications (see Section 8).\nRegion Optimal (Pearce & Tambe, 2007). Region-optimal algorithms are incomplete, synchronous, search-based algorithms that allow users to specify regions of the constraint graph and solve the subproblem within each region optimally. Regions may be defined to have a maximum size of k agents (Pearce & Tambe, 2007), t hops from each agent (Kiekintveld, Yin, Kumar, & Tambe, 2010), or a combination of both size and hops (Vinyals, Shieh, Cerquides, RodriguezAguilar, Yin, Tambe, & Bowring, 2011). The concept of k-optimality is defined with respect to the number of agents whose assignments conflict, whose set is denoted by c(σ, σ′), for two assignments σ and σ′. The deviating cost of σ with respect to σ′, denoted by ∆(σ, σ′), is defined as the difference of the aggregated cost associated to the assignment σ (F (σ)) minus the cost associated to σ′ (F (σ′)). An assignment σ is k-optimal if ∀σ′ ∈ Σ, such that |c(σ, σ′)| ≤ k, we have that ∆(σ, σ′) ≥ 0. In contrast, the concept of t-distance emphasizes the number of hops from a central agent a of the region Ωt(a), that is the set of agents which are separated from a by at most t hops. An assignment σ is t-distance optimal if, ∀σ′ ∈ Σ, F (σ) ≥ F (σ′) with c(σ, σ′) ⊆ Ωt(a), for any a ∈ A. Therefore, the solutions found have theoretical error bounds that are a function of k and/or t.\nIn the worst case, region-optimal agents perform O(dw ∗ ) number of operations in each iteration, as each agent runs DPOP to solve the problem within each region optimally. It is also an\nanytime algorithm as solutions of improving quality are found until they are region-optimal. The memory requirement per region-optimal agent is O(dw ∗ ) since its region may have an induced width of w∗ and it uses DPOP to solve the problem within its region. In terms of communication requirement, in the worst case, each region-optimal agent sends O(n) messages, one to each agent within its region. Thus, the total number of messages sent across all agents is O(`n2). Each message is of size O(dw ∗ ) as it uses DPOP. Finally, the agents do broadcast, but only to all agents within its region – either to a distance of bk2c or t hops away. An asynchronous version of regional-optimal algorithms, called Distributed Asynchronous Local Optimization (DALO), was proposed by Kiekintveld et al. (2010). The DALO simulator provides a mechanism to coordinate the decision of local groups of agents based on the concepts of k-optimality and t-distance.\nMGM (Maheswaran, Pearce, & Tambe, 2004a). Maximum Gain Message (MGM) is an incomplete, synchronous, search-based algorithm that performs a distributed local search. Each agent starts by assigning a random value to each of its variables. Then, it sends this information to all its neighbors. Upon receiving the values of its neighbors, it calculates the maximum gain (i.e., the maximum decrease in cost) if it changes its value and sends this information to all its neighbors as well. Upon receiving the gains of its neighbors, it changes its value if its gain is the largest among its neighbors. This process repeats until a termination condition is met. MGM provides no quality guarantees on the returned solution.\nIn the worst case, MGM agents perform O(ld) number of operations in each iteration, as each agent needs to compute the cost for each of its values by taking into account the values of all its neighbors. It is also an anytime algorithm since agents only change their values when they have a non-negative gain. The memory requirement per MGM agent is O(l) since it needs to store the values of all its neighboring agents. In terms of communication requirement, in the worst case, each MGM agent sends O(l) messages, one to each of its neighboring agents. Thus, the total number of messages sent across all agents is O(`nl). Each message is of constant size O(1) as it contains either the agent’s current value or the agent’s current gain. Finally, the agents only communicate through peer-to-peer connections (i.e., only to their neighboring agents) and do not broadcast.\nDSA (Zhang, Wang, Xing, & Wittenberg, 2005). Distributed Stochastic Algorithm (DSA) is an incomplete, synchronous, search-based algorithm that is similar to MGM, except that each agent does not send its gains to its neighbors and it does not change its value to the value with the maximum gain. Instead, it decides stochastically if it takes on the value with the maximum gain or other values with smaller gains. This stochasticity allows DSA to escape from local minima. Similar to MGM, it repeats the process until a termination condition is met, and it cannot provide quality guarantees on the returned solution. The runtime, memory, and communication characteristics of DSA are identical to those of MGM since it is essentially a stochastic variant of MGM.\nDUCT (Ottens, Dimitrakakis, & Faltings, 2012). The Distributed Upper Confidence Tree (DUCT) algorithm is an incomplete, synchronous, sampling-based algorithm that is inspired by MonteCarlo Tree Search and employs confidence bounds to solve DCOPs. DUCT emulates a search process analogous to that of ADOPT, where agents select the values to assign to their variables\naccording to the information encoded in their context messages (i.e., the assignments to all the variables in the receiving variable’s separator). However, rather than systematically selecting the next value to assign to their own variables, DUCT agents sample such values. To focus on promising assignments, DUCT constructs a confidence bound B, such that cost associated to the best value for any context is at least B, and hence agents sample the choice with the lowest bound. This process is started by the root agent of the pseudo-tree: After sampling a value for its variable, it communicates its assignment to its children in a context message. When an agent receives this message, it repeats this process until the leaf agents are reached. When the leaf agents choose a value assignment, they calculate the cost within their context and propagate this information up to the tree in a cost message. This process continues for a given number of iterations or until convergence is achieved, i.e., until the sampled values in two successive iterations do not change. Therefore, DUCT is able to provide quality guarantees on the returned solution.\nIn the worst case, DUCT agents perform O(ld) number of operations in each iteration, as each agent needs to compute the cost for each of its values by taking into account the values of all its neighbors. It is also an anytime algorithm since the quality guarantee improves with increasing number of iterations. The memory requirement per DUCT agent is O(dn)5 in the worst case since it needs to store the best cost for all possible contexts. In terms of communication requirement, in each iteration, each DUCT agent sends one message to its parent in the pseudo-tree and one message to each of its children in the pseudo-tree. Thus, the total number of messages sent across all agents is O(`n). Each message is of size O(n) in the worst case; context messages contain the value assignment for all higher priority agents. Finally, the agents only communicate through peer-to-peer connections (i.e., only to their neighboring agents) and do not broadcast.\nD-Gibbs (Nguyen, Yeoh, & Lau, 2013). The Distributed Gibbs (D-Gibbs) algorithm is an incomplete, synchronous, sampling-based algorithm that extends the Gibbs sampling process (Geman & Geman, 1984) by tailoring it to solve DCOPs in a decentralized manner. The Gibbs sampling process is a centralized Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm that can be used to approximate joint probability distributions. By mapping DCOPs to maximum a-posteriori estimation problems, probabilistic inference algorithms like Gibbs sampling can be used to solve DCOPs.\nLike DUCT, it too operates on a pseudo-tree, and the agents sample sequentially from the root of the pseudo-tree down to the leaves. Like DUCT, each agent also stores a context (i.e., the current assignment to all the variables in its separator) and it samples based on this information. Specifically, it computes the probability for each of its values given its context and chooses its current value based on this probability distribution. After it chooses its value, it informs its lower priority neighbors of its value, and its children agents start to sample. This process continues until all the leaf agents sample. Cost information is propagated up the pseudo-tree. This process continues for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence. Like DUCT, D-Gibbs is also able to provide quality guarantees on the returned solution.\n5. It is actually O(dt), where t is the depth of the pseudo-tree. However, in the worst case when the pseudo-tree degenerates into a pseudo-chain, then t = n.\nThe runtime characteristics of D-Gibbs are identical to that of DUCT and for the same reasons. However, its memory requirements are smaller: The memory requirement per D-Gibbs agent is O(l) since it needs to store the current values of all its neighbors. In terms of communication requirement, in each iteration, each D-Gibbs agent sends O(l) messages, one to each of its neighbor. Thus, the total number of messages sent across all agents is O(`nl). Each message is of constant size O(1) since they contain only the current value of the agent or partial cost of its solution. Finally, the agents only communicate through peer-to-peer connections (i.e., only to their neighboring agents) and do not broadcast.\nA version of the algorithm that speeds up the agents’ sampling process with Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) is described in (Fioretto, Yeoh, & Pontelli, 2016a)."

The reason is that many of the search algorithms’ performance typically perform some amount of redundant computation and communication. Thus, the overall runtime when using DPOP is usually smaller than when using the search algorithms. • If the agents in the application have limited amounts of memory, then one has to use the search-\nbased algorithms (e.g., SyncBB, AFB, ADOPT, ConcFB, OptAPO), which have small memory requirements. The exception is when the problem has a small induced width (e.g., the constraint graph is acyclic), in which case DPOP is also preferred. • If partial centralization is allowed by the application, then OptAPO is preferred as it has been\nshown to outperform many of the other search algorithms (Mailler & Lesser, 2004). • Otherwise, ConcFB is recommended as it has been shown to outperform AFB due to the con-\ncurrent search (Netzer et al., 2012), and AFB has been shown to outperform ADOPT and SyncBB (Gershman et al., 2009).

Bounded Max-Sum allows users to choose the error bound as a function of the different subsets of edges that can be removed from the graph to make it acyclic. Region-optimal algorithms allow users to parameterize the error bound according to the size of the region k or the number of hops t that the solution should be optimal for. Finally, DUCT and D-Gibbs allow users to parameterize the error bound based on the number of sampling iterations to conduct. The error bounds for these two algorithms are also probabilistic bounds (i.e., the likelihood that the quality of the solution is within an error bound is a function of the number of iterations). Therefore, the choice of algorithm will depend on the type of error bound one would like to impose on the solutions. One may also choose to use a number of extensions of complete algorithms (e.g., Weighted (BnB-)ADOPT and A-DPOP) that allow users to parameterize the error bound, which will also affect the degree of speedup. • If the solution returned need not have quality guarantees, then one can also use Max-Sum, MGM,\nor DSA. Between these three algorithms, their performance depends on a number of factors: If the problem has large domain sizes, MGM and DSA is likely to do better since the memory and computational complexities of Max-Sum grows exponentially with the domain size. However, if the problem has small induced widths (e.g., the constraint graph is acyclic), then Max-Sum is very efficient. It is even guaranteed to find optimal solutions when the induced width is 1. In general, Max-Sum tends to find better solutions especially when considering the improvements proposed in recent literature on incomplete classical DCOP algorithms (Zivan, Parash, Cohen, Peled, & Okamoto, 2017). • If the problem has hard constraints (i.e., certain value combinations are prohibited), then the\nsampling algorithms (i.e., DUCT and D-Gibbs) cannot be used as they are not able to handle such problems. They require the cost functions to be smooth, and exploit that characteristic to explore the whole search space. Thus, one is restricted to the other incomplete algorithms. • In general, MGM and DSA are good robust benchmarks as they tend to find reasonable solutions\nin practice.

Then, the goal in Asymmetric DCOPs is to find the solution σ∗:\nσ∗ := argmin σ∈Σ ∑ fj∈F ∑ ai∈α(fj) fj(σxj , ai) (2)\nAs in classical DCOPs, solving Asymmetric DCOPs is NP-hard. In particular, it is possible to reduce any Asymmetric DCOP to an equivalent classical DCOP by introducing a polynomial number of variables and constraints, as described in the next section."

      "text" : "One way to solve MAS problems with asymmetric costs via classical DCOPs is through the Private Event As Variables (PEAV) model (Maheswaran et al., 2004a). It can capture asymmetric costs by introducing, for each agent, as many “mirror” variables as the number of variables held by neighboring agents. The consistency with the neighbors’ state variables is imposed by a set of equality constraints. However, this formalism suffers from scalability problems, as it may result in a significant increase in the number of variables in a DCOP. In addition, Grinshpoun et al. (2013) showed that most of the existing incomplete classical DCOP algorithms cannot be used to effectively solve Asymmetric DCOPs, even when the problems are reformulated through the PEAV model. They show that such algorithms are unable to distinguish between different solutions that satisfy all hard constraints, resulting in a convergence to one of those solutions and the inability to escape that local optimum. Therefore, it is important to design specialized algorithms to solve Asymmetric DCOPs."

      "text" : "The current research direction in the design of Asymmetric DCOP algorithms has focused on adapting existing classical DCOP algorithms to handle the asymmetric costs. Asymmetric DCOPs require that each agent, whose variables participate in a cost function, coordinate the aggregation of their individual costs. To do so, two approaches have been identified (Brito, Meisels, Meseguer, & Zivan, 2009):\n• A two-phase strategy, where only one side of the constraint (i.e., the cost induced by one agent) is considered in the first phase. The other side(s) (i.e., the cost induced by the other agent(s)) is considered in the second phase once a complete assignment is produced. As a result, the costs of all agents are aggregated. • A single-phase strategy, which requires a systematic check of each side of the constraint before\nreaching a complete assignment. Checking each side of the constraint is often referred to as back checking, a process that can be performed either synchronously or asynchronously.\nCOMPLETE ALGORITHMS\nSyncABB-2ph (Grinshpoun et al., 2013). Synchronous Asymmetric Branch and Bound - 2-phase (SyncABB-2ph) is a complete, synchronous, search-based algorithm that extends SyncBB with the two-phase strategy. Phase 1 emulates SyncBB, where each agent considers the costs of its constraints with higher-priority agents. Phase 2 starts once a complete assignment is found. During this phase, each agent aggregates the sides of the constraints that were not considered during Phase 1 and verifies that the known bound is not exceeded. If the bound is exceeded, Phase 2 ends and the agents restart Phase 1 by backtracking and resuming the search from the lower priority agent that exceeded the bound. The worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of SyncBB.\nSyncABB-1ph (Grinshpoun et al., 2013; Levit, Grinshpoun, Meisels, & Bazzan, 2013). Synchronous Asymmetric Branch and Bound - 1-phase (SyncABB-1ph) is a complete, synchronous, search-based algorithm that extends SyncBB with the one-phase strategy. Each agent, after having extended the CPA, updates the bound with its local cost associated to the constraints involving its variables–as done in SyncBB. In addition, the CPA is sent back to the assigned agents to update its bound via a sequence of back checking operations. The worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of SyncBB.\nATWB (Grinshpoun et al., 2013). The Asymmetric Two-Way Bounding (ATWB) algorithm is a complete, asynchronous, search-based algorithm that extends AFB to accommodate both forward bounding and backward bounding. The forward bounding is performed analogously to AFB. The backward bounding, instead, is achieved by sending copies of the CPA backward to the agents whose assignments are included in the CPA. Similar to what is done in AFB, agents that receive a copy of the CPA compute their estimates and send them forward to the assigning agent. The worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of AFB.\nINCOMPLETE ALGORITHMS\nACLS (Grinshpoun et al., 2013). Asymmetric Coordinated Local Search (ACLS) is an incomplete, synchronous, search-based algorithm that extends DSA. After a random value initialization, each agent exchanges its values with all its neighboring agents. At the end of this step, each agent knows the values of all its neighboring agents, and identifies all possible improving assignments for its\nown variables, given the current neighbors choices. Each agent then picks one such assignments, according to the distribution of gains (i.e., reductions in costs) from each proposal assignment, and exchanges it with its neighbors. When an agent receives a proposal assignment, it responds with the evaluation of its side of the constraints, resulting from its current assignment and the proposal assignments of the other agents participating in the constraint. After receiving the evaluations from each of its neighbors, each agent estimates the potential gain or loss derived from its assignment, and commits to a change with a given probability, similar to agents in DSA, to escape from local minima. The worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of DSA.\nMCS-MGM (Grinshpoun et al., 2013). Minimal Constraint Sharing MGM (MCS-MGM) is an incomplete, synchronous, search-based algorithm that extends MGM by considering each side of the constraint. Like MGM, the agents operate in an iterative fashion, where they exchange their current values at the start of each iteration. Afterwards, each agent sends the cost for its side of each constraint to its neighboring agents that participate in the same constraint.6 Upon receiving this information, each agent knows the total cost for each constraint – by adding together the costs of both sides of the constraint. Therefore, like in MGM, the agent can calculate the maximum gain (i.e., maximum reduction in costs) if it changes its values, and will send this information to all its neighbors. Upon receiving the gains of its neighbors, each agent changes its value if its gain is the largest among its neighbors. The worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of MGM."

      "text" : "A Multi-Objective DCOP (MO-DCOP) is defined by a tuple 〈A,X,D, ~F, α〉, where A,X,D, and α are as defined in Definition 4.1, and ~F = [F1, . . . , Fh]T is a vector of multi-objective functions, where each Fi is a set of objective functions fj as defined in Definition 4.1. For a complete assignment σ of a MO-DCOP, let the cost for σ according to the ith multi-objective optimization function set Fi, where 1 ≤ i ≤ h, be\nFi(σ) := ∑ fj∈Fi fj(σxj ) (3)\n6. We actually describe a version of the algorithm with a guarantee that it will converge to a local optima. In the original version of the algorithm, which does not have such guarantee, each agent sends the cost only if its gain with the neighbor’s new values is larger than the neighbor’s last known gain.\nThe goal of a MO-DCOP is to find a complete assignment σ∗ such that:\nσ∗ := argmin σ∈Σ ~F(σ) = argmin σ∈Σ [F1(σ), . . . , Fh(σ)] T (4)\nwhere ~F(σ) is a cost vector for the MO-DCOP. A solution to a MO-DCOP involves the optimization of a set of partially-ordered assignments. Note that we consider, in the above definition, point-wise comparison of vectors—i.e., ~F(σ) ≤ ~F(σ′) if Fi(σ) ≤ Fi(σ′) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ h. Typically, there is no single global solution where all the objectives are optimized at the same time. Thus, solutions of a MO-DCOP are characterized by the concept of Pareto optimality, which can be defined through the concept of dominance:\nDefinition 1 (Dominance) A solution σ ∈ Σ is dominated by a solution σ∗ ∈ Σ iff ~F(σ∗) ≤ ~F(σ) and Fi(σ∗) < Fi(σ) for at least one Fi.\nDefinition 2 (Pareto Optimality) A solution σ∗ ∈ Σ is Pareto optimal iff it is not dominated by any other solution.\nTherefore, a solution is Pareto optimal iff there is no other solution that improves at least one objective function without deteriorating the cost of another function. Another important concept is the Pareto front:\nDefinition 3 (Pareto Front) The Pareto front is the set of all cost vectors of all Pareto optimal solutions.\nSolving a MO-DCOP is equivalent to finding the Pareto front. However, even for tree-structured MO-DCOPs, the size of the Pareto front may be exponential in the number of variables.7 Thus, multi-objective algorithms often provide solutions that may not be Pareto optimal but may satisfy other criteria that are significant for practical applications. A widely-adopted criterion is that of weak Pareto optimality:\nDefinition 4 (Weak Pareto Optimality) A solution σ∗ ∈ Σ is weakly Pareto optimal iff there is no other solution σ ∈ Σ such that ~F(σ) < ~F(σ∗).\nIn other words, a solution is weakly Pareto optimal if there is no other solution that improves all of the objective functions simultaneously. An alternative approach to Pareto optimality is one that uses the concept of utopia points:\nDefinition 5 (Utopia Point) A cost vector ~F◦ = [F ◦1 , . . . , F ◦h ] T is a utopia point iff F ◦i = maxσ∈Σ Fi(σ) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ h.\n7. In the worst case, every possible solution is a Pareto optimal solution.\nThus, a utopia point is the vector of costs obtained by independently optimizing h DCOPs, each associated to one objective of the multi-objective function vector. In general, ~F◦ is unattainable. Therefore, different approaches focus on finding a compromise solution (Salukvad, 1971), which is a Pareto optimal solution that is close to the utopia point. The concept of close is dependent on the approach adopted.\nSimilar to their centralized counterpart, MO-DCOPs have been shown to be NP-hard (their decision versions), and #P-hard (the related counting versions), and to have exponentially many efficient solutions and non-dominated points (Glaßer, Reitwießner, Schmitz, & Witek, 2010)."

Multi-Objective Synchronous Branch and Bound (MO-SBB) is a complete, synchronous, search-based algorithm that extends SyncBB. It uses an analogous search strategy to that of the mono-objective SyncBB: After establishing a complete ordering, MO-SBB agents extend a CPA with their own value assignments and the current associated cost vectors. Once a non-dominated solution is found, it is broadcasted to all agents, which add the solution to a list of global bounds. Thus, agents maintains an approximation of the Pareto front, which is used to bound the exploration, and extend the CPA only if the new partial assignment is not dominated by solutions in the list of global bounds. When the algorithm terminates, it returns the set of Pareto optimal solutions obtained by filtering the list of global bounds by dominance. The worst case runtime and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of SyncBB. In terms of memory requirement, each MO-SBB agent needs O(np) amount of memory, where p is the size of the Pareto set.\nPseudo-tree Based Algorithm (Matsui, Silaghi, Hirayama, Yokoo, & Matsuo, 2012). The proposed algorithm is a complete, asynchronous, search-based algorithm that extends ADOPT. It introduces the notion of boundaries on the vectors of multi-objective values, which extends the concept of lower and upper bounds to vectors of values. The proposed approach starts with the assumption that |F1| = · · · = |Fh| = k. Furthermore, functions within each Fi are sorted according to a predefined ordering, and for each 1 ≤ j ≤ k, we have that the scope of f ij (i.e., the jth function in Fi) is the same for each i (i.e., all functions in the same position in different Fi have the same scope). Thus, without loss of generality, we will refer to the scope of f ij as x\nj . In such a context, for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, given a complete assignment σ, we define the vector of cost\nvalues ~σj = [σ1fj , . . . , σ h fj ] = [f1j (σxj ), . . . , f h j (σxj )]. The notion of non-dominance is applied to these vectors, where a vector ~σj is non-dominated iff there is no other vector ~σ′j such that ub(σ′j\ns) ≤ lb(σsj ) for all 1 ≤ s ≤ h and ub(σ′js) < lb(σsj ) for at least one s. The algorithm uses the notion of non-dominance for bounded vectors to retain exclusively non-dominated vectors.\nThe worst case runtime and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of ADOPT. In terms of memory requirement, each agent needs O(np) amount of memory. However, notice that the number of combinations of cost vectors grows exponentially with the number of tuples of cost values, in the worst case. This algorithm has also been extended to solve Asymmetric MO-DCOPs (Matsui, Silaghi, Hirayama, Yokoo, & Matsuo, 2014), which is an extension of both Asymmetric DCOPs and MO-DCOPs.\nINCOMPLETE ALGORITHMS\nB-MOMS (Delle Fave et al., 2011). Bounded Multi-Objective Max-Sum (B-MOMS) is an incomplete, asynchronous, inference-based algorithm, and was the first MO-DCOP algorithm introduced. It extends Bounded Max-Sum to compute bound approximations for MO-DCOPs. It consists of three phases. The Bounding Phase generates an acyclic subgraph of the multi-objective factor graph, using a generalization of the maximum spanning tree problem to vector weights. During the Max-sum Phase, the agents coordinate to find the Pareto optimal set of solutions to the acyclic factor graph generated in the bounding phase. This is achieved by extending the addition and marginal maximization operators adopted in Max-Sum to the case of multiple objectives. Finally, the Value Propagation Phase allows agents to select a consistent variable assignment, as there may multiple Pareto optimal solutions. The bounds provided by the algorithm are computed using the notion of utopia points.\nThe worst case runtime requirement of this algorithm is the same as those of Max-Sum. In terms of communication requirement, the number of messages sent is also like Max-Sum, but the size of each message is nowO(pdn). In terms of memory requirement, each B-MOMS agent needs O(pdn) amount of memory to store and process the messages received.\nDP-AOF (Okimoto, Clement, & Inoue, 2013). Dynamic Programming based on Aggregate Objective Functions (DP-AOF) is an incomplete, synchronous, inference-based algorithm. It adapts the AOF technique (Miettinen, 1999), designed to solve centralized multi-objective optimization problems, to solve MO-DCOPs. Centralized AOF adopts a scalarization to convert a MOO problem into a single objective optimization. This is done by assigning weights (α1, . . . , αh) to each of the functions in the objective vector [F1, . . . , Fh]T such that ∑h i=1 αi = 1 and αi > 0 for\nall 1 ≤ i ≤ h. The resulting mono-objective function ∑h\ni=1 αi Fi can be solved using any monoobjective optimization technique with guarantee to find a Pareto optimal solution (Miettinen, 1999).\nDP-AOF proceeds in two phases. First, it computes the utopia point ~F◦ by solving as many mono-objective DCOPs as the number of objective functions in the MO-DCOP. DP-AOF uses DPOP to solve these mono-objective DCOPs. It then constructs a new problem building upon the solutions obtained from the first phase. Such a problem is used to assign weights to each objective function of the MO-DCOP to construct the new mono-objective function in the same way as centralized AOF, which then can be solved optimally. The worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of DPOP, except that the number of operations and the number of messages are larger by a factor of h since it runs DPOP h times to solve the h mono-objective DCOPs.\nMO-DPOPLp (Okimoto, Schwind, Clement, & Inoue, 2014). Multi-Objective Lp-norm based Distributed Pseudo-tree Optimization Procedure (MO-DPOPLp) is an incomplete, synchronous, inference-based algorithm. It adapts DPOP using a scalarization measure based on the Lp-norm to find a subset of the Pareto front of a MO-DCOP. Similar to DP-AOF, the algorithm proceeds in two phases. Its first phase is the same as the first phase of DP-AOF: It solves h mono-objective DCOPs using DPOP to find the utopia point ~F◦. In the second phase, the agents coordinate to find a solution that minimizes the distance from ~F◦ according to the Lp-norm. The algorithm is guaranteed to find a Pareto optimal solution only when the L1-norm (Manhattan norm) is adopted. In this case, MO-DPOPL1 finds a Pareto optimal solution that minimizes the average cost values of all objectives. The worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of DP-AOF.\nDIPLS (Wack, Okimoto, Clement, & Inoue, 2014). Distributed Iterated Pareto Local Search (DIPLS) is an incomplete, synchronous, search-based algorithm. It extends the Pareto Local Search (PLS) algorithm (Paquete, Chiarandini, & Sttzle, 2004), which is a hill climbing algorithm designed to solve centralized multi-objective optimization problems, to solve MO-DCOPs. The idea behind DIPLS is to evolve an initial solution toward the Pareto front. To do so, it starts from an initial set of random assignments, and applies PLS iteratively to generate new non-dominated solutions. DIPLS requires a total ordering of agents and elects one agent as the controller. At each iteration, the controller filters the set of solutions by dominance and broadcasts them to the agents in the MODCOP. Upon receiving a solution, an agent generates a list of neighboring solutions by modifying the assignments of the variables that it controls, and sends them back to the controller. When the controller receives the messages from all agents, it proceeds to filter (by dominance) the set of solutions received, and if a new non-dominated solution is found, it repeats the process.\nThe worst case runtime of this algorithm is O(`kp) as the controller agent is required to check the dominance of the newly generated solutions at each iteration. In terms of memory requirement, DIPLS agents use O(np) space to store the Pareto front. Finally, in terms of communication requirement, the controller agent broadcasts messages that contain the current Pareto front. Thus, the message size is O(np)."

Thus, the information flow modifies the environment over time. To cope with such a requirement, researchers have introduced the Dynamic DCOP (DDCOP) model, where cost functions can change during the problem solving process, agents may fail, and new agents may be added to the DCOP being solved. With respect to our categorization described in Section 3, in the D-DCOP model, the agents are completely cooperative and they have\ndeterministic behavior and total knowledge.

The goal in a D-DCOP is to solve the DCOP at each time step optimally. We assume that the agents have total knowledge about their current environment (i.e., the current DCOP), but they are unaware of changes to the problem in future time steps.\nIn a dynamic system, agents are required to adapt as fast as possible to environmental changes. Stability (Dijkstra, 1974; Verfaillie & Jussien, 2005) is a core algorithmic concept, where an algorithm seeks to minimize the number of steps that it requires to converge to a solution each time the problem changes. In such a context, these converged solutions are also called stable solutions. Self-stabilization is a related concept derived from the area of fault-tolerance:\nDefinition 6 (Self-stabilization) A system is self-stabilizing iff the following two properties hold: • Convergence: The system reaches a stable solution in a finite number of steps, starting from any given state. In the DCOP context, this property expresses the ability of the agents to coordinate a joint variables assignment that optimizes the problem at time step t + 1, starting from an assignment of the problem’s variables at time step t. • Closure: The system remains in a stable solution, provided that no changes in the environ-\nment happens. In the DCOP context, this means that agents do not change the assignment for their variables after converging to a solution.\nAn extension of the concept of self-stabilization is that of super-stabilization (Dolev & Herman, 1995), which focuses on stabilization after topological changes. In the context of D-DCOPs, differently from self-stabilizing algorithms, where convergence after a single change in the constraint graph can be as slow as the convergence from an arbitrary starting state, super-stabilizing algorithms take special care of the time required to adapt to a single change in the constraint graph.\nSolving D-DCOPs is NP-hard, as it requires to solve each DCOP of the D-DCOP independently."

These procedures work as in DPOP and they are invoked whenever any change in the DCOP problem sequence is revealed. Petcu and Faltings (2005c) discuss two self-stabilizing extensions, namely super-stabilization and fault-containment, which can be used to provide guarantees about the way the system transitions from a valid state to the next, after an environment change.\nThe worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm to solve the DCOP at each time step are the same as those of DPOP.

In the incremental any-space versions of the algorithms, each agent maintains bounds for multiple contexts; in contrast, agents in ADOPT and BnB-ADOPT maintain bounds for one context only. By doing so, when solving the next DCOP in the sequence, agents may reuse the bounds information computed in the previous DCOP. In particular, the algorithms identify affected agents, which are agents that cannot reuse the information computed in the previous iterations, and they recompute bounds exclusively for such agents.\nThe worst case runtime and communication requirements of this algorithm to solve the DCOP at each time step are the same as those of ADOPT.

It uses two types of messages: is-good and no-good. Is-good messages contain an ordered partial assignment and are exchanged among neighboring agents upon a change in their value assignments. Each agent, upon receiving a message, decides what value to assign to its own variables, attempting to minimize their local costs, and communicates such decisions to its neighboring agents via is-good messages. No-good messages are used in response to violations of hard constraints, or in response to obsolete assignments. A no-good message is augmented with a justification, that is, the set of hard constraints that are violated, and are saved locally within each agent. This information is used to discard partial assign-\nments that are supersets of one of the known no-goods. The changes of the dynamic environment are communicated via messages, which are sent from the environment to the agents. In particular, changes in hard constraints require the update of all the justifications in all no-goods.\nThe worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of SyncBB each time the problem changes.\nFMS (Ramchurn, Farinelli, Macarthur, & Jennings, 2010).

(2010) exploit domain-specific properties in a task allocation problem to reduce the number of states over which each factor has to compute its solution.

In this proposed model, agents have commitment deadlines and stability constraints. In other words, some of the variables may be unassigned at a given point in time, while others must be assigned within a specific deadline. Commitment deadlines are either hard or soft. Hard commitments model irreversible processes. When a hard committed variable is assigned, its value cannot be changed. Soft commitments model contracts with penalties. If a soft committed variable xti has been assigned at time step t, its value can be changed at time step t\n′ > t, at the price of a cost penalty. Such costs are modeled via stability constraints, which are defined as binary relations si : Di ×Di → R+, representing the cost of changing the value of variable xi from time step t to time step t+ 1. Given the set of stability constraints S ⊆ F, at each time step t, the goal is to find a solution σ∗t :\nσ∗t := argmin σ∈Σ Fg(σ) + ∑ sj∈S sj(σ ∗ t−1(xj), σ(xj))  . The latter term accounts for the penalties associated to the value assignment updates for the soft\ncommitted variables. RS-DPOP has the same order complexity as S-DPOP.\nTo solve this problem, Petcu and Faltings (2007b) extended S-DPOP to RS-DPOP.8 Like SDPOP, it is a synchronous, inference-based algorithm, Unlike S-DPOP, it’s UTIL and VALUE propagation phases now take into account the commitment deadlines. The worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm to solve the DCOP at each time step are the same as those of S-DPOP.\nDistributed Q-learning and R-learning (Nguyen, Yeoh, Lau, Zilberstein, & Zhang, 2014). In this proposed model, called Markovian Dynamic DCOPs (MD-DCOPs), the DCOP in the next time step Dt+1 depends on the solution (i.e., assignment of all variables) adopted by the agents for the DCOP in the current time step Dt. However, the transition function between these two DCOPs are not known to the agents and the agents must, thus, learn them. The Distributed Q-learning and Rlearning algorithms are synchronous reinforcement-learning-based algorithms that extend the centralized Q-learning (Abounadi, Bertsekas, & Borkar, 2001) and centralized R-learning (Schwartz, 1993; Mahadevan, 1996) algorithms. Each agent maintains Q-values and R-values for each σt−1, dti pair, where σt−1 is the solution for the DCOP Dt−1 and dti is the value of its variables in the cost function f ti ∈ Ft. These Q- and R-values represent the predicted cost the agent will incur if it assigns its variables values according to dti when σt−1 is the previous solution. The agents repeatedly refine these values at every time step and choose the values with the minimum Q- or R-value at each time step.\nThe worst case runtime, communication, and memory requirements of these two algorithms to solve the DCOP at each time step are the same as those of DPOP, as they use DPOP as a subroutine to update the Q- and R-values. The exception is that agents in the Distributed Q-learning algorithm also broadcast their value assignments at each time step to all other agents. Thus, they send O(m2) messages in each time step instead of the O(m) complexity of DPOP.9\nA very similar and related model is the Proactive Dynamic DCOPs (PD-DCOPs) (Hoang, Fioretto, Hou, Yokoo, Yeoh, & Zivan, 2016; Hoang, Hou, Fioretto, Yokoo, Yeoh, & Zivan, 2017), where the transition function between two subsequent DCOPs are known and can be exploited by the agents. Additionally, another key difference between these two models are that the DCOP in the next time step Dt+1 does not depend on the solution in the current time step, but instead depend on the values of random variables at the current time step. Researchers have introduced a number of offline proactive and online reactive algorithms to solve this problem (Hoang et al., 2016, 2017)."

      "text" : "A common strategy to model uncertainty is to augment the outcome of the cost functions with a stochastic character (Atlas & Decker, 2010; Stranders, Delle Fave, Rogers, & Jennings, 2011; Nguyen, Yeoh, & Lau, 2012). Another method is to introduce additional random variables to the cost functions, which simulate exogenous uncontrollable traits (Léauté & Faltings, 2009, 2011; Wang, Sycara, & Scerri, 2011). To cope with such a variety, we introduce the Probabilistic DCOP (P-DCOP) model, which generalizes the proposed models of uncertainty. A P-DCOP is defined by a tuple 〈A,X,D,F, α, I,Ω,P, E ,U〉, where A and D are as defined in Definition 4.1. In addition, • X is a mixed set of decision variables and random variables. • I = {r1, . . . , rq} ⊆ X is a set of random variables modeling uncontrollable stochastic events,\nsuch as weather or a malfunctioning device. • F = {f1, . . . , fk} is the set of cost functions, each defined over a mixed set of decision variables\nand random variables, and such that each value combination of the decision variables on the cost function, results in a probability distribution. As a result, fi is itself a random variable, given the local value assignment σxi\\I and a realization for the random variables involved in fi. • α : X \\I → A is a mapping from decision variables to agents. Notice that random variables are\nnot controlled by any agent, as their outcomes do not depend on the agents’ actions. • Ω = {Ω1, . . . ,Ωq} is the (possibly discrete) set of events for the random variables (e.g., different\nweather conditions or stress levels a device is subjected to) such that each random variable ri ∈ I takes values in Ωi. In other words, Ωi is the domain of random variable ri. • P = {p1, . . . , pq} is a set of probability distributions for the random variables, such that pi :\nΩi → [0, 1] ⊆ R assigns a probability value to an event for ri and ∫ ω∈Ωi pi(ω) dω = 1 for each\nrandom variable ri ∈ I. • E is an evaluator function from random variables to real values, that, given an assignment of\nvalues to the decision variables, summarizes the distribution of the aggregated cost functions. • U is a utility function that given a random variable returns an ordered set of different outcomes,\nand it is based on the decision maker preferences. This function is needed when the cost functions have uncertain outcomes, and thus these distributions are not readily comparable.\nThe goal in a P-DCOP is to find a solution σ∗, that is, an assignment of values to all the decision variables, such that:\nσ∗ := arg min/max σ∈Σ E ∑ fi∈F U ( fi(σxi\\I) ) (5) where argmin or argmax are selected depending on the algorithm adopted, ∑ is the operator that is used to aggregate the values from the functions fi ∈ F. Typically such an operator is a summation, however, to handle continuous distributions, other operators have been proposed.\nThe probability distribution over the domain of random variables ri ∈ I is called a belief. An assignments of all random variables in I describes a (possible) scenario governed by the environment. As the random variables are not under the control of the agents, they act independently of the decision variables. Specifically, their beliefs are drawn from probability distributions. Furthermore, they are assumed to be independent of each other and, thus, they model independent sources of exogenous uncertainty.\nThe utility function U enables us to compare the uncertain cost outcomes of the cost functions. In general, the utility function is non-decreasing, that is, the lower the cost, the higher the utility. However, the utility function should be defined for the specific application of interest. For example, in farming, the utility increases with the amount of produce harvested. However, farmers may prefer a smaller but highly certain amount of produce harvested over a larger but highly uncertain and, thus, risky outcome.\nThe evaluation function E is used to summarize in one criterion the costs of a given assignment that depends on the random variables. A possible evaluation function is the expectation function: E [·] = E[·].\nLet us now introduce some concepts that are commonly adopted in the study of P-DCOPs.\nDefinition 7 (Convolution) The convolution of the probability density function (PDF) f(x) and g(x) of two independent random variables X and Y is the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted:\nh(z) = (f ∗ g)(z) := ∫ ∞ −∞ f(τ) g(z − τ) dτ = ∫ ∞ −∞ f(z − τ) g(τ) dτ (6)\nIt produces a new PDF h(z) that defines the overlapping area between f(x) and g(y) as a function of the quantity that one of the original functions is translated by. In other words, the convolution is a method of determination of the sum of two random variables. The counterpart for the distribution of the sum Z = X + Y of two independent discrete variables is:\nP (Z = z) = ∞∑\nk=−∞ P (X = k)P (Y = z − k). (7)\nIn a P-DCOP, the value returned by a function fi, for an assignment on its scope xi, is a random variable Vi (Vi ∼ fi(xi)). Thus, the global value ∑ fi∈F Vi is also a random variable,\nwhose probability density function is the convolution of the PDFs of the individual Vi’s. Thus, the concept of convolution of two PDFs in a P-DCOP is related to the summation of the utilities of two cost functions in classical DCOPs.\nA common concept in optimization with uncertainty is that of ranking a set of random variables {r1, r2, . . . } with Cumulative PDFs (CDFs) {F1(x), F2(x), . . . }. Such distributions are also commonly called lotteries, a concept related to that of stochastic dominance, which is a form of stochastic ordering based on preference regarding outcomes. It refers to situations where a probability distribution over possible outcomes can be ranked as superior to another.\nThe first-order stochastic dominance refers to the situation when one lottery is unambiguously better than another:\nDefinition 8 (First-Order Stochastic Dominance) Given two random variables ri and rj with CDFs Fi(x) and Fj(x), respectively, Fi first-order stochastically dominates Fj iff:\nFi(x) ≤ Fj(x), (8)\nfor all x with a strict inequality over some interval.\nIf Fi first-order stochastically dominates Fj , then Fi necessarily has a strictly smaller expected value: E[Fi(x)] < E[Fj(x)]. In other words, if Fi dominates Fj , then the decision maker prefers Fi over Fj regardless of his utility function U is, as long as it is weakly increasing.\nIt is not always the case that one CDF will first-order stochastically dominate another. In such a case, one can use the second-order stochastic dominance to compare them. The latter refers to the situation when one lottery is unambiguously less risky than another:\nDefinition 9 (Second-Order Stochastic Dominance) Given two random variables ri and rj with CDFs Fi(x) and Fj(x), respectively, Fi second-order stochastically dominates Fj iff:∫ c\n−∞ Fi(x) dx ≤ ∫ c −∞ Fj(x) dx, (9)\nfor all c with a strict inequality for some values of c.\nIf Fi second-order stochastically dominates Fj , then E[Fi(x)] ≤ E[Fj(x)]. If Equation 9 holds for all c ≥ c′, for some sufficiently large c′, then E[Fi(x)] = E[Fj(x)]. In this case, as both lotteries are equal in expectation, the decision maker prefers the lottery Fi, which has less variance and is, thus, less risky.\nAnother common concept in P-DCOPs is that of regret. In decision theory, regret expresses the negative emotion arising from learning that a different solution than the one adopted, would have had a more favorable outcome. In P-DCOPs the regret of a given solution is typically defined as the difference between its associated cost and that of the theoretical optimal solution. The notion of regret is especially useful in allowing agents to make robust decisions in settings where they have limited information about the cost functions.\nAn important type of regret is the minimax regret. Minimax regret is a decision rule used to minimize the possible loss for a worst case (i.e, maximum) regret. As opposed to the (expected) regret, minimax regret is independent of the probabilities of the various outcomes. Thus, minimax regret could be used when the probabilities of the outcomes are unknown or difficult to estimate.\nSolving P-DCOPs is PSPACE-hard, as in general, the process is required to remember a solution for each possible state associated to the uncertain random variables. The study of complexity classes for P-DCOPs is largely unexplored. Thus, we foresee this as a potential direction for future research, in which particular focus could be given in determining fragments of P-DCOPs characterized by lower complexity than the one above."

This is due to the greater modeling flexibility offered by the P-DCOP framework. As such, the proposed algorithms are often not directly comparable one another.

      "text" : "E[DPOP] (Léauté & Faltings, 2011). E[DPOP] is a synchronous, sampling-based and inferencebased algorithm. It can be either complete or incomplete based on the E[DPOP] variant used, which we describe below. E[DPOP] uses a collaborative sampling strategy, where all agents concerned with a given random variable agree on a common sample set that will be used to estimate the PDF of that random variable. Agents performing collaborative sampling independently propose sample sets for the random variables influencing the variables they control, and elect one agent among themselves as responsible for combining the proposed sample sets into one. The algorithm is defined over P-DCOPs with I 6= ∅, and deterministic cost function outcomes, that is, for each combination of values for the variables in xi, fi(σxi\\I) is a degenerate distribution (i.e., a distribution that results in a single value) and the utility function U is the identity function. E is an arbitrary evaluator function summing over all functions in F.\nE[DPOP] builds on top of DPOP, and proceeds in four phases: In Phase 1, the agents order themselves into a pseudo-tree ignoring the random variables. In Phase 2, the agents bind random variables to some decision variable. In Phases 3 and 4, the agents run the UTIL and VALUE propagation phases like in DPOP except that random variables are sampled. Based on different strategies adopted in binding the random variables in Phase 2, the algorithm has two variants (Léauté & Faltings, 2009). In Local-E[DPOP], a random variable ri ∈ I is assigned to each decision variable\nresponsible for enforcing a constraint involving ri. In this approach, the agents do not collaborate by exchanging information about how their utilities depend on the random variables. In contrast, Global-E[DPOP] assigns ri to the lowest common ancestor agent,10 which is responsible for combining the proposed samples. While this additional information can produce higher-quality solutions, both algorithms are generally incomplete. One exception is when the evaluation function E adopted is linear, as in the case of the expectation function, in which case the algorithms are complete.\nThe worst case runtime, memory, and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of DPOP. The exception is the message size of Global-E[DPOP], which is O(dw ∗ sq), where s is the largest sample set size; the UTIL messages have this size when the root as well as all leaves of the pseudo-tree are constrained with all q random variables.\nSD-DPOP (Nguyen et al., 2012). Stochastic Dominance DPOP (SD-DPOP) also operates on a P-DCOP model, where I = ∅, E is the second order stochastic dominance criteria, and Σ denotes the convolution of the distributions fi(σxi\\I), while U is the identity function. It is a complete synchronous inference-based algorithm that extends DPOP to solve P-DCOPs. Similar to DPOP, it has three phases. In Phase 1, like DPOP, it constructs a pseudo-tree. In Phase 2, instead of summing up costs, the agents convolve cost functions, and instead of propagating costs up the pseudo-tree, they propagate convolved cost functions. In Phase 3, like DPOP, the agents choose values for their variables. However, instead of choosing values that minimize the cost of their subtrees, the agents choose their values according to the second-order stochastic dominance criteria.\nLike DPOP, SD-DPOP requires a linear number of messages. In addition, in SD-DPOP, VALUE messages contain each Pareto optimal value of the sending agent, and UTIL messages contain a representation of the cost function for each Pareto optimal solution and each combination of values of the parent and pseudo-parents of the sending agents. Thus, for continuous PDFs that could be represented by mean and variance, the message size is O(pdw ∗ ), where p is the size of the Pareto set. If the cost functions are represented by discretized bins, then the message size is O(bpdw ∗ ), where b is the maximum number of bins used to represent a cost function. The memory requirement of each SD-DPOP agent is similarly O(pdw ∗ ) or O(bpdw ∗ ) as above, as they need to store and process the messages received. The worst case runtime requirement and the number of messages sent by SD-DPOP are the same as those of DPOP."

      "text" : "DNEA (Atlas & Decker, 2010). The P-DCOP model proposed by Atlas and Decker (2010) is characterized by uncertainty exclusively at the level of the outcome of the cost functions, and not due to random variables. Thus, I = ∅. In addition, the utility function U is the identity function, while E is a given evaluator function (e.g., the expectation) for the functions fi ∈ F. In such settings, by employing the evaluation function, they show that one can reduce the uncertainty\n10. The agent that is separated by the smallest number of tree edges from all variables constrained with the given random variable.\nassociated to each cost function to the deterministic case. Thus, one can solve the proposed PDCOP problems using classical DCOP approaches.\nIn particular, they propose the Distributed Neighbor Exchange Algorithm (DNEA), which is an incomplete, synchronous, search-based algorithm that is similar to DSA. Each agent starts by assigning a random value to each of its variables and sends this information to all its neighbors. Upon receiving the values of its neighbors, it computes a cost vector, which contains the costs for each possible combination of values for all its variables under the assumption that its neighbors’ values are those in the messages received. It then sends this cost vector to all its neighbors. Upon receiving the cost vector of its neighbors, it computes the best value for each of its variables, assigns those values to its variables probabilistically, and sends the assigned values to all its neighbors. This process repeats until a termination condition is satisfied.\nThe worst case runtime requirement of this algorithm is O(`(ld+ d2)). In terms of communication requirement, the number of messages sent is O(`nl), and the size of each message is O(d). In terms of memory requirement, each DNEA agent needs O(ld) amount of memory to store and process the messages received.\nU-GDL (Stranders et al., 2011). The P-DCOP model proposed by Stranders et al. (2011) also assumes that the cost functions are not dependent on random variables. Thus, I = ∅. Additionally, they assume that E is the expectation of the convolution (Σ) of the distributions fi(σxi\\I), and U is a given risk function. They propose the Uncertain Generalized Distributive Law (U-GDL) algorithm, which is an incomplete asynchronous inference-based algorithm similar to Max-Sum, and operates on acyclic graphs. A cyclic constraint graphG is converted into an acyclic graph Ĝ by merging variables until the new resulting graph contains no cycles. Merging two variables creates a new one whose domain is the cartesian product of the domain of the merged variables. U-DGL extends the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL) algorithm (Aji & McEliece, 2000) by redefining the (min,+)11 algebra to the setting where costs are random variables rather than scalars. The + operator is extended to perform convolution of two random variables. To cope with the potential issue that not all PDFs are closed under convolution, Stranders et al. (2011) suggest to resort to sampling methods to approximate such operations. The min operator is defined to distribute over convolution and to select the minimal elements from a set of random variables based on their expected cost. In order to filter partial potential solutions that can never achieve global optimality, the authors introduce a first-order stochastic dominance condition, which is employed in the context of the min operator. They also discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for dominance, where the former discards all dominated solutions, but it might also discard some non-dominated solution as well – this is equivalent to using a classical DCOP algorithms to solve the P-DCOP model adopted in their work. The latter preserves optimal solutions, but retains, in general, sub-optimal ones as well.\nThe worst case runtime requirement of this algorithm is O(pd̂l), where d̂ is the size of the largest domain of the merged variables in Ĝ. In terms of memory requirement, each U-GDL agent\n11. U-GDL was originally defined for maximization problems. We adapt its presentation to minimization problems for consistency of the DCOP models objective presented in this survey.\nneeds O(pd̂l) amount of memory to store all value combinations of neighboring variables for each solution in its current Pareto frontier. In terms of communication requirement, the number of messages sent is O(δ(Ĝ)), where δ(Ĝ) is the diameter of the resulting acyclic graph, and the size of each message is O(pd̂) as agents need to send the current aggregated costs of all the agent’s variable’s values for each solution in its current Pareto frontier."

That is, the cost functions are only partially known and, therefore, agents may discover the unknown costs via exploration (Taylor, Jain, Tandon, Yokoo, & Tambe, 2011). The new model aims at capturing those domains where agents have an “explorative nature,” i.e., one of the agents’ goals is to acquire knowledge about the environment in which they act. Agents are concerned with a total, online, cost achievable in a limited time frame. In this context, agents must balance the coordinated exploration of the unknown environment and the exploitation of the known portion of the costs, in order to minimize the global utility.

Thus, the algorithms presented in this section are targeted to coordinate agents to solve a sequence of optimization problems in order to simultaneously reduce uncertainty about the local cost functions (exploration) and optimize the global objective (exploitation). In addition, the following algorithms are incomplete.\nBE-Rebid (Taylor et al., 2010). The Balanced Exploration Rebid (BE-Rebid) is a synchronous, search-based algorithm that solves P-DCOPs with I = ∅, and U and E are the identity functions. It\nextends MGM as it calculates and communicates its expected gain. The algorithm is introduced in the context of a wireless sensor network problem, where agents can perform small movements in order to enhance their communication capabilities, which are characterized by the distance between pairs of agents. Each agent can perform three actions: stay in the current position, explore another position, or backtrack to a previously explored position and halt movement. In each time step, BERebid computes the expected cost of executing the explore or backtrack actions, assuming complete knowledge of the underlying distribution of the cost functions. Exploring is evaluated by using order statistics and is based on the cost of the best value found during exploration. Backtracking to a known position results in a cost associated to the backtracked state for the remainder of the time steps (i.e., it stays in that state).\nFollowing the region-optimal approaches presented in the context of classical DCOPs, the Taylor et al. (2011) propose a version of the algorithm, called BE-Rebid-2, that allows pairs of agents to explore in a coordinated fashion. Interestingly, in such settings, the authors find that increasing coordination (measured by the number of agents that can execute a joint action) can decrease solution quality. This phenomenon is referred to as team uncertainty penalty. The worst case runtime and communication requirements of this algorithm are the same as those of MGM.\nHeist (Stranders, Tran-Thanh, Fave, Rogers, & Jennings, 2012). HEIST is a synchronous, inference-based algorithm that solves P-DCOPs with I = ∅, E is the expectation function, and U is the identity function. Thus, it aims at minimizing the expected utility of the cumulative cost function Fg, within the finite time horizon T . It does so by modifying a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) approach (Vermorel & Mohri, 2005) to a distributed scenario. A MAB is a slot machine with multiple arms, each of which yields a cost, drawn from an unknown but fixed probability distribution. It trades exploration and exploitation by pulling the arms in order to minimize the cumulative cost over a finite horizon. To cope with the uncertain and stochastic nature of the cost functions, HEIST models each cost function as a MAB, such that the joined assignment of the variables in the scope of the given cost function becomes an arm of that bandit. It seeks to minimize the expected cumulative optimization cost received over a finite time horizon by repeatedly pulling the MAB arms to select the joint action with the highest estimated upper confidence bound (UCB) (Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, & Fischer, 2002) on the sum of the local gains received in a single time step. To do so, it employs a belief propagation algorithm, known as generalized distributive law (GDL) (Aji & McEliece, 2000), in order to minimize the UCB in a decentralized fashion. Stranders et al. (2012) show that HEIST enables agents to balance between exploration and exploitation, and derive optimal asymptotic bounds on the regret of the global cumulative cost attained.\nThe worst case runtime requirement of this algorithm is O(`Tdl) as each agent computes the maximum marginal UCB for its variable assignment for each time step before the horizon. In terms of memory requirement, each Heist agent needs O(dl) amount of memory to store all value combinations of neighboring variables. In terms of communication requirement, the number of messages sent is O(`T l), one to each neighbor and time step in each iteration, and the size of each message is O(Td) as it contains the aggregated costs of all the agent’s variable’s values for each time step.\nICG-Max-Sum (Wu & Jennings, 2013). The Iterative Constraint Generation Max-Sum (ICGMax-Sum) algorithm is a synchronous, inference-based algorithm that solves P-DCOPs with I 6= ∅, E is the identity function, and U(fi(·)) is the maximal regret function. The algorithm aims at minimizing the sum of maximal regrets for all the functions in F. Furthermore, the horizon is T = 1. Thus, unlike the previous algorithms, IGC-Max-Sum does not attempt to learn the outcome of the cost functions. Its objective is to find robust solutions to the uncertain problem distributions; it does so by finding the solution that minimizes the maximum regret. The algorithm extends the Iterative Constraint Generation (ICG) method (Benders, 1962; Regan & Boutilier, 2010) to the decentralized case, by decomposing the overall problem into a master problem and a subproblem that are iteratively solved until convergence. At each iteration, the resolutions of these problems are attained by using Max-Sum. The master problem solves a relaxation of the minimax regret goal, where only a subset of all possible joint beliefs is considered, attempting to minimize the loss for the worst case derived from the considered joint belief. Once it generates a solution, the subproblem finds the maximally violated constraint associated to such a solution. This is referred to as the witness point, indicating that the current solution is not the best one in terms of the minimax regret. This point is added to the set of joint beliefs considered by the master problem, and the process is repeated until no new witness points can be found.\nThe worst case runtime requirement of this algorithm is O(`|I|dl), which is dominated by the master problem, whose computation is exponential in the number of variables in the scope of the associated cost function for each belief and iteration of the algorithm. In terms of memory requirement, each ICG-Max-Sum agent needs O(|I|dl) amount of memory (dominated by the master problem again) to store all value combinations of neighboring variables for each belief. In terms of communication requirement, the number of messages sent is the same as that of Max-Sum since two parallel iterations of Max-Sum is executed in each ICG-Max-Sum iteration. However, the size of each message is O(|I|d) as it contains the aggregated cost of all the agent’s variable’s value for each belief.\nA variation of this algorithm that aims at minimizing the expected regret, rather than minimizing the maximum regret, was introduced by Le, Fioretto, Yeoh, Son, and Pontelli (2016)."

In QCSPs and QDCSPs, all variables are associated to quantifiers and the constraints should be satisfied independently of the value taken by universally quantified variables. Analogously, in QDCOPs, existential (∃) and universal (∀) quantifiers are introduced to differentiate the cooperative agents from the adversarial ones.\nA QDCOP has the form Q(F) := q0x0 . . . qnxn.12 Q is a sequence of quantified variables, where each qi ∈ {∃, ∀} quantifies the variable xi. The goal of a QDCOP is to find a global optimal solution of the corresponding DCOP. However, a universally quantified variable is not coordinated nor assigned, as the result has to hold when it takes any value from its domain. In contrast, an existentially quantified variable takes exactly one value from its domain, as in (cooperative) DCOPs. Thus, the optimal solution of a QDCOP may be different from that of the corresponding DCOP. While a DCOP solution defines a single value, associated to its cost, a QDCOP defines upper and lower bounds to the optimal solution. In particular, the best choice in a QDCOP defines the smallest lower bound. In the worst case, the universally quantified variables can worsen the overall objective as much as possible. Therefore, the worst case defines the smallest upper bound. While finding an optimal solution for a DCOP is NP-hard, solving a QDCOP is, in general, P-SPACE-hard (Benedetti et al., 2008; Lallouet, Lee, Mak, & Yip, 2015)."

To keep the ordering of the quantifiers unchanged, the pseudo-tree can be reshaped by applying extra null edges for each pair of nodes, if necessary.\nAll the algorithms presented here are complete, and are based on the intuition that universally quantified variables can be seen as adversarial virtual agents, whose goal is to minimize the overall objective.

Upon receiving VALUE messages from all higher-priority neighbors, the agent updates its context and repeats the same process by choosing an assignment\n12. In the original proposal, the set F is separated in a set of constraints C, representing relationships among variables, and a set of functions F , assigning values to each valid assignment.\nthat minimizes its local cost. In Min-max ADOPT, the existentially quantified variables are used to compute the lower bound, while the universally quantified variables are used to compute the upper bound. This process is executed until the root agent detects that the upper bound is equal to the lower bound. This algorithm has a relatively simple structure and does not adopt any major pruning strategy.\nAlpha-beta ADOPT (Matsui et al., 2010). Alpha-beta ADOPT is an asynchronous, search-based algorithm that extends Min-max ADOPT by adapting the alpha-beta search strategy, a common pruning strategy adopted in game-tree search. This strategy employs two boundary parameters, alpha and beta, representing the lower bound and the upper bound for each possible cost of an assignment, respectively. Alpha represents the lower bound, controlled by the universally quantified variables, while beta represents the upper bound, controlled by the existentially quantified variables. Lower bound and upper bound can be modified exclusively by universally quantified and existentially quantified variables, respectively. In Alpha-beta ADOPT, when an agent reports the cost value of the current partial assignment, its parent reduces the alpha/beta threshold accordingly. Thus, the new alpha/beta values are used to prune the search when an agent detects that the current assignment cannot be better than any other solution already evaluated. Alpha and beta values are obtained using a backtracking technique similar to how thresholds are obtained through backtracking in the original ADOPT.\nBi-threshold ADOPT (Matsui et al., 2010). Bi-threshold ADOPT extends ADOPT by employing two backtracking thresholds instead of one as in ADOPT. In ADOPT, each agent ai maintains the threshold invariant lb∗i ≤ ti ≤ ub∗i , where lb∗i and ub∗i are the smallest lower and upper bounds, respectively, of the agent over all of its values, and ti is the threshold of the agent. In contrast, in Bi-threshold ADOPT, each agent maintains the threshold invariant lb∗i ≤ tαi ≤ t β i ≤ ub∗i , where tαi is a lower bound on the threshold, similar to alpha in Alpha-beta ADOPT, and tβi is an upper bound on the threshold, similar to beta in Alpha-beta ADOPT."

      "text" : "Disaster management and coordination problems refer to how to efficiently and effectively respond to an emergency. In such scenarios, low-powered mobile devices that require limited bandwidth are\noften deployed and utilized. Due to their decentralized nature, the DCOP approach fits naturally with this application. We now describe several problems within this application domain.\nDisaster Evacuation Problems. In a disaster scenario, moving evacuees to the closest refuge shelter can quickly overwhelm shelter capacities. A number of researchers have proposed a DCOP model for disaster evacuation, in which several groups of evacuees have to be led to available shelters (Carpenter, Dugan, Kopena, Lass, Naik, Nguyen, Sultanik, Modi, & Regli, 2007; Kopena, Sultanik, Lass, Nguyen, Dugan, Modi, & Regli, 2008; Lass, Kopena, Sultanik, Nguyen, Dugan, Modi, & Regli, 2008a; Lass, Regli, Kaplan, Mitkus, & Sim, 2008b; Kinoshita, Iizuka, & Iizuka, 2013). Group leaders can communicate via mobile devices to monitor and coordinate actions. Each group is represented by a DCOP agent managing variables that represent shelter allocations. Thus, the domain of each variable corresponds to the available shelters. Group sizes and shelter capacity, as well as additional group requirements (e.g., medical needs) and the distance of a group to shelters, are encoded as cost functions. Solving the DCOP ensures an assignment of all groups\nto shelters that minimizes overflow, such that groups receive the services they need and their travel distances are minimal.\nCoalition Formation with Spatial and Temporal Constraints Problems. In a Coalition Formation with Spatial and Temporal Constraints (CFST) problem (Ramchurn et al., 2010; PujolGonzalez, Cerquides, Farinelli, Meseguer, & Rodriguez-Aguilar, 2015; Steinbauer & Kleiner, 2012), ambulance and fire brigade agents cooperate in order to react efficiently to an emergency scenario so as to rescue victims and extinguish fires located in different parts of a city. Agents can travel from one location to another in a given time. Each task (i.e., rescuing a victim, extinguishing a fire) has a deadline, representing the time until which the victim will survive, and a workload, denoting the amount of time necessary to rescue the victim or put out the fire. The locations of the victims and the fires may be unknown to the agents, and need to be discovered at runtime, which requires agents to dynamically update the sequence of the tasks they will attempt, taking account of two main constraints: (1) Spatial constraints, which model where an agent can travel and at what time; and (2) Temporal constraints, which model task deadlines and completion times. Agents may also form coalitions to execute a given task faster or if the requirements of a given task cannot be met by a single agent. Hence, the agents’ arrival times at each task need to be coordinated in order to form the desired coalition. The objective is to maximize the number of tasks to be completed.\nA DCOP formalization for the CFST is described by Ramchurn et al. (2010), where ambulances and fire brigades are modeled as DCOP agents. Each agent controls a variable that encodes the current task that the agent will attempt, and whose domain represents task locations. Unary constraints restrict the set of reachable locations, according to distance from a destination and the victim’s deadline. Agents’ coalitions are defined as groups of agents traveling to the same location. Each task is associated to a utility, which encodes the success for a coalition to complete such task. The goal is to find an assignment of agents to tasks that maximizes the overall utility.\nA variant of the CFST problem, called the Law Enforcement Problem (LEP), was introduced by Amador, Okamoto, and Zivan (2014). Similar to the CFST problem, in a LEP, police officers need to execute a number of tasks, and may form coalitions to improve their response quality. Additionally, and differently from the CFST, new tasks can be revealed to the agents dynamically over time. Agents can choose to interrupt their current task to perform a new revealed task at the cost of a penalty that is proportional to the importance of the task being interrupted."

      "text" : "The performance of a wireless local area network (WLAN) depends on the channel assignments among neighboring access points (APs). Neighboring transmissions occurring in APs on the same channel or adjacent channels degrade network performance due to transmission interference. Typically, in dense urban areas, APs may belong to different administrative domains, whose control are delegated to different entities. Thus, a distributed approach to the channel assignment is necessary.\nCooperative Channel Assignment Problems. In a cooperative channel assignment problem (Hollos, Karl, & Wolisz, 2004; Monteiro, Pellenz, Penna, Enembreck, Souza, & Pujolle, 2012a; Monteiro, Pujolle, Pellenz, Penna, Enembreck, & Demo Souza, 2012b), APs need to be config-\nured in order to reduce the overall interference between simultaneous transmissions on neighboring channels. Monteiro et al. (2012a, 2012b) proposed a DCOP-based approach for cooperative channel assignment in WLANs where APs may belong to different administration entities. In the proposed model, each AP is represented by a DCOP agent, which controls a decision variable modeling a choice for the AP’s channels. The signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio perceived by an AP or a client is modeled as a cost function, as the overall concurrent transmissions occurring in the same channel and in partially overlapped adjacent channels. The goal is to find an assignment of channels to APs that minimizes the total interference experienced in the WLAN.\nXie, Howitt, and Raja (2007) and Mir, Merghem-Boulahia, and Gaı̈ti (2010) study dynamic solutions to the problem of allocating and utilizing the wireless network’s available spectrum. In such a problem, the agents operate in a dynamic radio frequency environment that is composed of time-varying interference sources, which are periodically sampled and measured."

      "text" : "Recommendation systems are tools that provide user-tailored information about items to users. These systems provide information that is tailored to the characteristics and preferences of the users.\nGroup Recommendation Problems. Like individual recommendations, group recommendations need to take into account the preferences of all group members and formulate a recommendation that suits the whole group. Lorenzi, dos Santos, Ferreira Jr, and Bazzan (2008) proposes a DCOPbased travel package recommendation system for groups of users. The users in the group share a common goal (the travel package recommendation), and have individual preferences for each travel service (hotel, flight companies, tour operators, etc). In such a problem, the objective is to find a group recommendation that optimizes the users’ preferences. The proposed DCOP solution is composed of two types of agents: user agents and recommender agents. Each user agent controls a decision variable that models that user’s travel choices, while each recommender agent controls a decision variable that models a travel service supplier’s recommendations. User travel preferences are modeled via unary constraints on the user agents’ decision variables. Binary constraints between user agents in a group and their associated recommender agent ensure that each user’s choice in the group is compatible to the recommendation of the recommender agent. The goal is to find the best recommendation for the entire group."

      "heading" : "8.4 Scheduling Problems",
      "text" : "Scheduling problems are an important class of problems, and they have been long studied in the area of Constraint Programming and Operations Research (Giffler & Thompson, 1960; Solomon, 1987; Minton, Johnston, Philips, & Laird, 1992; Hentenryck & Michel, 2009). In such problems, time schedules are to be associated to resource usage. The problem is made particularly difficult when the scheduling process needs to be coordinated in a distributed manner across several entities. In such a context, many scheduling problems can be naturally mapped to DCOPs.\nDistributed Meeting Scheduling Problems. The distributed meeting scheduling problem captures generic scheduling problems where one wishes to schedule a set of events within a time range (Jennings & Jackson, 1995; Garrido & Sycara, 1996). Each event is defined by: (i) the resources required for it to be completed, (ii) the time required for it to be completed, within which it holds the required resources, and (iii) the cost of using such resources at a given time. A scheduling conflict occurs if two events with at least one common resource are scheduled in overlapping time slots. The goal is to maximize the utilities over all the resources, defined as the net gain between the opportunity benefit and opportunity cost of scheduling various events.\nMaheswaran, Tambe, Bowring, Pearce, and Varakantham (2004b) discuss three possible DCOP formulations for this problem: Time slots as variables (TSAV), events as variables (EAV), and private events as variables (PEAV). We describe the EAV formulation and refer the reader to the original article for the other two formulations and additional details. In the EAV formulation, events are considered as decision variables. Each variable can take on a value from the time slot range that is sufficiently early to schedule the required resources for the required amount of time or zero to denote that an event is not scheduled. If a variable takes on a non-zero value, then all its required resources cannot be assigned to any other overlapping event.\nWater Allocation Scheduling Problems. The management of water resources in large-scale systems is often associated with multiple institutionally-independent decision makers, which may represent different and conflicting interests, such as flood prevention, hydropower production, and water supply (Giuliani, Castelletti, Amigoni, & Cai, 2014). The aim of such problems is to find an efficient use of water allocation and distribution according to the different users’ interests.\nGiuliani et al. (2014) formalize a regulatory mechanism in water management as a DCOP. The model involves several active human agents and passive ecological agents. Each agent is associated with an objective function that it seeks to maximize. Active agents make decisions about the amount of water to divert from the river or to be released from a dam in order to maximize their corresponding objective functions. Passive agents, on the other hand, represent ecological interests through their associated objective functions and do not make decisions. The agents model different water supplies for cities and agricultural districts, hydropower productions, and ecological preservation. The goal is to optimize the agents’ objective functions, satisfying hard (physical) constraints and maximizing the soft (normative) constraints, which aim at protecting the interests of the passive agents. A solution to such problem, which makes use of a multi-objective DCOP formalization, is presented in (Amigoni, Castelletti, & Giuliani, 2015).\nVessel Rotation Planning Problem. In a large port, vessels are scheduled to visit different terminals for loading and unloading operations. The sequence of terminals visited by a vessel is called the vessel rotation. Due to the different nature of the terminal visits (e.g., loading, unloading containers, different inland shipping activities) there are often dependencies between activities performed at the terminals. Additionally, vessel operators have their own preferences on when to visit a particular terminal. The vessel rotation planning problem (VRPP) (Li, Negenborn, & Lodewijks, 2016) describes the problem of assigning rotations to vessels, consisting of sequences of visits to terminals and arrival and departure times of vessels to terminals in a port area, while\nsatisfying the terminals’ visits dependencies and taking into account operators’ preferences. Due to the geographically distributed nature of the resources (vessels, terminals, loading facilities) and the distributed coordination process undertaken by vessels operators this problem fits naturally in the DCOP framework.\nLi et al. (2016) proposed a DCOP model for the VRPP, where vessels and terminals are modeled as DCOP agents. The problem variables are the time slot for which a vessel i is at terminal j (xij), the arrival and departure times of vessel i at terminal j (aij and dij , respectively), and the number of time steps a vessel i waits at terminal j (wij). A vessel agent i governs variables xij , aij , dij , and wij , for each terminal j that it can visit, while a terminal agent controls auxiliary variables yij for each vessel i that can visit j, which has the same value of xij and is used by terminal agents to represent the terminal capacities. The problem constraints represent the preferences of vessels of being at a given terminal in a given time, the penalty occurring for a waiting vessel, and the time windows during which a vessel can visit a terminal.\nPatient Scheduling Problems. Medical appointments scheduling problems are related to meeting scheduling problems, as they need to associate patients to resources (e.g., doctors, medical machinery) and times, but they require different types of constraints. Patients may require several services from different departments within the same hospital or in multiple hospitals. In general, the objective is to minimize the patient treatment waiting time under limited resource conditions, as well as to ensure efficient resource usage, taking into account patient preferences.\nHannebauer and Müller (2001) formulate the problem of scheduling patients to diagnostic units in an hospital as a DCOP, where appointments are modeled as variables, whose domains describe times, durations, and locations. The constraints of the problem model the schedule feasibility, the patient preferences over hospitalization times, the workplace constraints, which restricts the types of appointment for a given workplace, and diagnostic unit constraints, which model resource usage.\nBilliau, Chang, Ghose, and Miller (2012b, 2012c) propose a Dynamic DCOP model for a radiotherapy patients scheduling problem. In this problem, each agent represents a patient, and it controls variables that represent private information (e.g., type of tumor, number of radiation doses per day, the use of chemotherapy) and public information (e.g., current schedule of the radiotherapy machine). The constraints of the problem model the duration of each daily treatment, as well as tumor-specific treatment restrictions. The problem objective considers patient waiting times to receive their treatment, patient priorities (based on tumor aggressiveness), and patient preferences."

      "heading" : "8.5 Sensor Network Problems",
      "text" : "Sensor networks typically consist of a large number of inexpensive and autonomous sensor nodes, constrained by a limited communication range and battery life. These networks have been deployed for environmental sensing (temperature, humidity, etc.), military applications (e.g., battlefield surveillance), and target tracking (Akyildiz, Su, Sankarasubramaniam, & Cayirci, 2002). When deploying sensor networks, it may not be possible to pre-determine the position of each sensor node. The distributed nature of the problem and the presence of several communication and sensing constraints create a natural fit for DCOPs to solve a wide range of related applications.\nTarget Tracking Problems. In a typical target tracking application (Zhang et al., 2005; Matsui & Matsuo, 2008; Jain, Taylor, Tambe, & Yokoo, 2009; Ota, Matsui, & Matsuo, 2009; Stranders, Farinelli, Rogers, & Jennings, 2009; Semnani & Basir, 2013), a collection of small Doppler sensors are scattered in an area to detect possible moving targets in the region. Each sensor is batterypowered, can communicate with one another through radio communication, and can scan and detect an object within a fixed range. Communication incurs an energy cost. Thus, to save energy, a sensor may turn itself off. Multiple sensors may be necessary to detect a single target with high accuracy. The overall objective is to maximize the number of targets detected, as quickly as possible and, at the same time, preserve energy so as to prolong the system’s lifetime\nZhang et al. (2005) moldes a simplified version of the above problem as a weighted graph coloring problem, where the total weight of violated constraints needs to be minimized. A node corresponds to a sensor, an edge between two nodes represents the constraint of a shared region between agents, and the weight captures the importance of the common region. The size of the common region reflects the amount of energy loss when two sensors scan the shared region at the same time. Each color corresponds to a time slot in which a sector is scanned. A node must have at least one color so that the corresponding sector is scanned at least once. This graph coloring problem is mapped to a DCOP, where agents represent nodes, agent’s variables represent the agents decision on their color, and cost functions represent the graph edges.\nSemnani and Basir (2013) use a hierarchical DCOP approach to scale to larger problems. The authors partition the original problem into n local regions, and use n DCOPs to solve the smaller subproblems. Their solutions are then combined in a hierarchical approach, solved by a DCOP that encompasses variables and constraints shared among the connected regions of the lower hierarchy DCOPs.\nRobotic Network Optimization Problems. The robotic network optimization problem describes a sensor network problem where sensors are placed on top of robots that have limited movement capability. In such a problem, robots can make small movements to optimize the wireless connectivity with their neighbors, without affecting the network topology (Choxi & Modi, 2007; Jain et al., 2009).\nJain et al. (2009) proposed a DCOP formulation where each robot is represented by an agent. Each agent controls one variable describing the decision on the robots’ possible movements. Thus, the variables’ domains consist of the valid positions the agent can move to. The cost functions of the problem model the power loss (or gain, depending on the optimization criteria) of the wireless link from a transmitter and a receiver robot, and depend on their positions. Radio communication in wireless sensor networks have a predictable signal strength loss that is roughly inversely proportional to the square of the distance between transmitter and receiver. However, radio wave interference is very difficult to predict (Molisch, 2012). Thus, Jain et al. (2009) use a P-DCOPbased approach with partial agent knowledge to capture the robot’s partial knowledge on its cost functions, and to balance exploration of the unknown costs and exploitation of the known portion of the costs.\nMobile Sensor Team Problem. The Mobile Sensor Team (MST) problem is similar to the target tracking problem with the difference that agents are capable of moving autonomously within the environment and that time is modeled explicitly as a discrete sequence of time steps. In an MST, agents are placed on a grid. For an agent ai, cur pos i denotes the agent’s current position; SRi denotes the agent’s perception sensing range, which determines the coverage range within which an agent can detect targets; MRi denotes the agent’s mobility range, which defines the maximum distance that the agent can move within a single time step; and cred i denotes the agent’s credibility, which reflects the likelihood of the correctness of the detected targets. The targets are defined implicitly through an environmental requirement (ER) function, which defines, for each point in space, the minimum joint credibility value (the sum of the credibility variables) required for that point to be sensed. In such a representation, targets are points p with ER(p) > 0. Given a set of agents SRp whose sensing range covers a target p, the remaining coverage requirement of p is the environmental requirement diminished by the joint credibility of the agents currently covering p: Cur REQ(p) = max{0, ER(p) ∑ ai∈SRp cred i}, where : R × R → R is an operator that defines how the environmental requirement decreases by the joint credibility. The goal of the agents is to find positions that minimize the values of Cur REQ for all targets.\nMST problems are modeled through a subclass of Dynamic DCOPs, named DCOP MST (Zivan, Glinton, & Sycara, 2009; Yedidsion, Zivan, & Farinelli, 2014; Yedidsion & Zivan, 2014). Each agent ai controls one variable xi representing its position, and whose domain contains all locations within MRi of cur pos i. Thus, the domains are updated each time the agent moves.\n13 The constraint Cp of a target p involves exclusively those agents ai whose variable’s domain includes a location within SRi of p. Thus, at each time step, both domains and constraints may change. As a consequence, the constraint graph changes as well–the neighbors of each agent has to be updated at each time step. Finally, in a DCOP MST two agents are neighbors if their sensing areas overlap.\nSensor Sleep Scheduling Problem. Wireless sensor nodes are equipped with a radio, which can be used to communicate with neighboring nodes, and a limited power source. These sensor nodes are often deployed in inaccessible terrains, thus replacing their power sources may not be possible. The wireless sensor sleeping scheduling problem aims at switching on/off a particular sensor node component (such as the sensor or the radio) for a certain period of time, so to ensure power conservation, maximizing the lifetime of the sensor network.\nChachra and Marefat (2006) proposed a DCOP model for this problem, where each sensor is an agent whose variables denote its status (on or off) for each time step. Hard constraints are employed to enforced that if a sensor is on, then all its neighbors should be off, and that sensors cannot stay on for two consecutive time steps. The overall objective is to minimize the delay induced in the network.\nA similar problem is solved by Stranders et al. (2009), where sensors are also able to harvest energy from the environment (e.g. using a photo-voltaic cell or vibration-harvesting microgenerators). In such a context, the goal is to find a schedule that maximizes the probability of detecting\n13. An alternative representation is that of modeling the domain of each variable as the entire grid, and to constrain the agent variable, at each agent move, in order to hide those points lying outside MRi.\nevents while maintaining energy-neutral operations (that is, exhibit an indefinite lifetime for each of the agents)."

      "heading" : "8.6 Service-Oriented Computing Problems",
      "text" : "The service-oriented computing paradigm is one that relies on sharing resources over a network, focusing on maximizing the effectiveness of the shared resources, which are used by multiple applications. Efficient solutions with optimal use of resources are crucial in this paradigm and have a wide industrial impact (Moreno-Vozmediano, Montero, & Llorente, 2013). The distributed nature of the resources and the privacy concerns arising when different clouds are involved in the deployment, makes DCOP appealing to solve a range of problems in this paradigm (Mejias & Roy, 2010).\nApplication Component Placement Problems. An application component placement (ACP) problem is defined over a network of servers offering storage devices with various capabilities, and component-based application with requirements for processing, communication, and storage (Jin, Cao, & Li, 2011; Li, Wang, Ding, & Li, 2014). The ACP problem is a problem of deciding which server to assign to each application component. The component-based application is described by a set of characteristics that establish their requirements in terms of hardware (e.g., CPU speed, storage capacity) as well as constraints between components of the same application (e.g., minimum bandwidth, secure communication channel requirement). When the APC involves deployment on multiple clouds data privacy must be preserved. Additionally, in cloud environments computing resources are shared by many applications and the infrastructure is dynamically changing, making centralized solutions unfeasible.\nJin et al. (2011) proposed a DCOP model for the ACP problem where servers bid for a component to host, with an emphasis that is proportional to the affinity of the server characteristics and the component hardware and software requirements. Each server is modeled by an agent, which controls a decision variable representing the server bids. Thus, the domain of each variable is the set of possible components that may be deployed on the server. Unary functions express utility for each component. Hard constraints are employed to ensure that each component is deployed exactly on a single server, and that two components are placed between servers satisfying the required communication bandwidth. The objective is to find a feasible assignment of component to servers that maximizes the utilities.\nServer Allocation Problems. Services-oriented middleware networks are composed of entities that can both provide and require multiple services connected within a physical network. In turn, each service can be provided by multiple servers and can serve multiple clients. A service request from a given client, takes into account various quality of service (QoS) parameters (e.g., service response time, service completion time). When a client generates a service request, it can be satisfied by any of the servers offering such requests. The server allocation problem is a problem of selecting servers to allocate services, ensuring maximum social welfare, while meeting the QoS requirements of all clients.\nChoudhury, Dey, Dutta, and Choudhury (2014) presented a DCOP model for this problem where agents correspond to network entities, variables correspond to services, and their values are either 1, if the associated agent is willing to provide/forward the service, or 0, otherwise. Clients’ service requests are mapped to servers’ service offers, accounting for the delays that occur when traversing between intermediate nodes using a routing multicast protocol (Yan, Lee, Shen, & Qiao, 2013). Moreover, in order to provide a service, all requested QoS requirements need to be satisfied. The utility associated to each variable is the combination of the utility for such a node when acting as a service consumer, a service provider, and a service forwarder, and depends on several parameters, such as available GPU cycles, battery power, memory, and bandwidth. The problem may change dynamically when a new request is made, or when a new service is offered or released, and as such can be modeled as a Dynamic DCOP."

      "text" : "The smart grid is a vision of the future electricity grid, where bidirectional flow of both electricity and information, in an automated fashion, improves efficiency and reliability of energy production and distribution. The development of smart grids poses several challenges: (1) How to deal with the increasing electric grid utilization due to growth of loads, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps; (2) How to efficiently integrate a diverse range of energy sources, including intermittent generators, into the power network; and (3) How to deal with the uncertainty in the equipment as well as in the participation of consumers through demand-side technologies. Due to the distributed and dynamic nature of loads and generators participating in the smart grid, agent-based decentralized autonomous control of smaller distributed microgrids is a very compelling solution (Davidson, Dolan, McArthur, & Ault, 2009; Ramchurn, Vytelingum, Rogers, & Jennings, 2012). In particular, several agent-based decentralized optimization solutions have been explored to deliver this vision (Kumar, Faltings, & Petcu, 2009; Matsui & Matsuo, 2011; Miller, Ramchurn, & Rogers, 2012; Jain, Ranade, Gupta, & Pontelli, 2012). The following is a list of the most prominent DCOP approaches for smart grid and smart homes applications.\nEconomic Dispatch Problems. Economic Dispatch (ED) is the problem of coordinating the various settings of the power generators in order to meet the power loads with the lowest cost possible, while satisfying the physical network constraints (Wood & Wollenberg, 2012). Researchers have cast this problem as a DCOP (Miller et al., 2012; Jain et al., 2012; Gupta, Jain, Yeoh, Ranade, & Pontelli, 2013a; Athanasiadis, Kockar, & McArthur, 2013), considering a network of nodes (agents), each of which relays power to other nodes, but can also contain a combination of generators and loads. Generators are distributed across nodes, and are represented through variables whose domain describe a certain set of discrete power outputs. The power lines connecting nodes of the networks, are also associated to DCOP variables, each of which has a thermal capacity describing the maximum power that it can safely carry. The DCOP function describes a particular optimization criteria, such as minimizing the carbon emissions of generators within the network, as well as the imposed load and network constraints. In particular, the constraints ensure that the\noverall demand and supply are in balance and that thermal capacity constraints of the power lines are satisfied.\nA version of the ED problem with a planning horizon has been proposed by Fioretto, Yeoh, Pontelli, Ma, and Ranade (2017b). This formalization extends the ED model described above by capturing the physical restrictions of transmission lines, power loads, and power generators arising when deploying a sequence of solutions (set-points for generators and loads) over time. In particular, it models the maximum incremental power that can be supplied or reduced in one time step to each power generator, which depends on the mechanical characteristics of the generators. This problem has been cast as a Dynamic DCOP, where, in addition to the variables and constraints of the classic ED problem, a set of constraints is introduced between each two consecutive time steps to limit the maximum variation of the generators’ output.\nPower Supply Restoration Problems. After (multiple) line failures, a power grid must be reconfigured to ensure restoration of power supply. A power network distribution is a network of power lines connected by switching devices (SDs) and fed by circuit breakers (CBs). SDs are analogous to sinks (transformer stations), while CBs are analogous to power sources. Both of these devices can operate in two states: open or closed. Closed SDs consume some power and forward the rest of it on other lines. Open SDs stop power flow. CBs feed the network when they are closed. The configuration of the devices’ state is such that energy flow traversing CBs takes the form of a (feeder) tree, and that no SD is powered by more than a single power line. Flow conservation and transmission line capacity constraints must be enforced. The power supply restoration problem is the problem of finding a configuration that ensures power restoration for the maximum number of sinks affected by the line failures.\nResearchers have proposed a DCOP formulation for this problem (Kumar et al., 2009; Agrawal, Kumar, & Varakantham, 2015). In such a framework, each node of the distribution network is controlled by an agent that owns all variables and constraints corresponding to that node. Two DCOP variables are associated to each network node: A load variable and a direction variable. Load variables model the amount of incoming flow for sink nodes, and the number of sinks fed for power source nodes. Direction variables model all the possibilities of feeding a node, as the set of possible configurations in which its neighboring nodes can forward power to it. The acyclicity of the power flow and the flow conservation are modeled as constraints. The former restricts the power path to be a tree as well as defines the optimization criterion. The latter enforces Kirchhoff’s law, that the amount of incoming power flow to the node i must equal the sum of power consumed at i and the amount of power forwarded to other nodes.\nMicrogrid Islanding Problems. A microgrid islanding problem is the problem of creating islands (i.e., clusters of generator units and loads able to operate without external energy supply) in response to major power outages and blackouts. Gupta, Yeoh, Pontelli, Jain, and Ranade (2013b) formalized this problem as a DCOP, where agents represent nodes in the network, and each agent has its own power generation and power consumption capabilities. Variables represent the amount of power that an agent generates and consumes, as well as transmission line flows and switch status between network nodes. Flow variables are constrained by their maximum transmission line\ncapacities, while switches are modeled as binary variables that can be turned on or off. Flow conservation are modeled as constraints to enforce Kirchhoff’ s law. The goal is to find a switching configuration that minimizes the unserved load of the system.\nProsumer Energy Trading Problems. In its more general form, a smart grid is populated by prosumers capable of both generating and consuming resources. The prosumer energy trading problem aims at setting market-based prices for prosumers to directly trade over the smart grid, while taking account of the grid constraints. This problem has been cast as an optimization problem called the energy allocation problem, where, given a graph with nodes representing prosumers and edges describing transmission lines connecting adjacent prosumers, the goal is to find an allocation that maximizes the benefits of all the prosumers while satisfying the capacity constraints of the network.\nCerquides, Picard, and Rodrı́guez-Aguilar (2015) proposed a DCOP formalization for this problem, where each prosumer is an agent. Variables are associated with edges of the energy trading network (i, j) and describe the number of units of energy that prosumer i sells to/buys from prosumer j. Thus, two variables (i, j) and (j, i) are associated to each edge of the network. For each prosumer, an energy balance constraint models the utility of a given instantiation of its offers as the sum of the offers associated to the energy traded with each of its neighbor. Line capacity and flow conservation constraints ensure that the energy traded along the transmission lines is within their maximum capacity and is consistent with Kirchhoff’s law.\nSmart Building Devices Scheduling Problems. A smart building is a residential or commercial building that is partially automated through the introduction of smart devices (e.g., smart thermostats, circulator heating, washing machines). Due to the availability of a variety of smart plugs allowing users to intelligently control devices by remotely switching them on and off, smart device scheduling can be executed by householders without the control of a centralized authority. The distributed nature of smart devices within a smart building, and of smart buildings within a neighborhood, as well as data privacy concerns, make this domain suitable to DCOP solutions.\nWithin a smart building, the Smart Environment Configuration Problem (SECP) proposed by Rust, Picard, and Ramparany (2016) is the problem of coordinating several smart devices (light bulbs, roller shutters, luminosity sensors, etc.) whose actions affect the building environment, with the goal of reaching a desired goal state (e.g., a given luminosity level for a room). This resource allocation problem is cast to a DCOP in which devices are described via DCOP agents, each of which controls a single variable describing the devices’ action. The domain of the variables model the possible device’s actions. Finally, the impact of the device’s action onto the building environment is captured by a set of soft constraints. The goal is that of finding an action assignment for the building devices which satisfies the given goals states while minimizing the some cost function (e.g., the energy consumption of each device).\nWithin a smart city, the Smart Home Device Scheduling Problem (SHDS) proposed by Fioretto, Yeoh, and Pontelli (2017a) is the problem of coordinating the schedule of several smart homes’ devices so to minimize the aggregated energy peaks as well as to minimize the users energy bill cost, when adopting a real-time energy price schema. In the SHDS problem, each smart home controls\na set of smart sensors and smart devices. Within each smart home, users establish scheduling rules defining goal states upon certain home’s properties (e.g., reaching a certain room temperature by a given time of the day, or to charge the battery of an electric vehicle of at least some amount during the night). Each device’s action has an associated energy consumption and a cost (which depends on the time of the day in which the action is executed and on its required power). Each user in a smart home attempts to find a schedule for its smart devices that satisfies its scheduling rules while minimizing the energy cost. Additionally, multiple smart homes coordinate their devices’ schedules so to minimize the daily energy peak consumption. Fioretto et. al map the SHDS problem as a DCOP where each agent models a smart home. Agents control multiple variables, each representing a smart device (a sensor or an actuator). Similar to the SECP problem, variables’ domains model the possible actions of a device, and constraints capture the actions’ costs, energy consumption, and user preferences. Additionally, a set of hard constraints is used to model the user’s temporal goals. A dataset for the SHDS problem has been recently released (Kluegel, Iqbal, Fioretto, Yeoh, & Pontelli, 2017)."

      "heading" : "8.8 Supply Chain Management Problems",
      "text" : "The management of large businesses involves the management of the flow of goods from suppliers to customers. This flow of goods is called a supply chain. Supply chains have to be carefully managed to ensure that a sufficient quantity of raw material is available at factories for production and a sufficient quantity of processed goods is available at stores for consumers to buy. Additionally, since goods can be purchased from different producers and sold to different consumers, there is also the need to consider how much to buy/sell the goods and who to buy/sell the goods to. In such an environment, information, decision making and control are inherently decentralized.\nSupply Chain Formation Problems. A supply chain formation problem is the process of determining the participants in a supply chain, who will exchange what, with whom, and the terms of the exchange. Several DCOP-based approaches for this problem have been proposed in the literature (Gaudreault, Frayret, & Pesant, 2009; Penya-Alba, Cerquides, Rodriguez-Aguilar, & Vinyals, 2012; Penya-Alba, Vinyals, Cerquides, & Rodriguez-Aguilar, 2012; Winsper & Chli, 2013; PenyaAlba, Vinyals, Cerquides, & Rodriguez-Aguilar, 2014). In general, they rely on the notion of a Task Dependency Network (TDN) introduced by Walsh and Wellman (2000), which is a graphbased representation to capture dependencies among production processes. A TDN is a bipartite directed acyclic graph representing exchanges, where nodes in the graph correspond to producers and consumers and edges in the graph correspond to feasible exchanges of goods between the producers and consumers. A path from potential producers and consumers defines a feasible supply chain configuration and the goal is to find the feasible configuration that optimizes a particular cost function. A DCOP encoding for this problem models producers and consumers as agents, each of which controls a variable describing the agent’s decision regarding whom to buy from/sell to as well as its associated quantities and costs. Cost functions are associated with each edge of the TDN encoding the willingness of the producer and consumer to trade with each other.\nA dynamic version of the above formalization has been investigated by Chli and Winsper (2015). Such a model allows for the entry and departure of producers and consumers as well as changes in properties of the problem (e.g., prices of goods, production capacity of producers, and consumption requirements of consumers)."

      "heading" : "8.9 Traffic Flow Control Problems",
      "text" : "A challenge for the increase of transportation demand is to enforce traffic flow control using the existing infrastructure, such as traffic lights, loop detectors, and cameras. Coordinating the actions of these individual devices aims at smoothing the traffic flow at the network level. Such coordinated actions often generates coherent traffic control plans faster and more accurately compared to those of a human traffic operator (Van Katwijk, De Schutter, & Hellendoorn, 2009). Due to the distributed nature of such devices, multi-agent solutions are particularly suitable for this class of problems.\nTraffic Light Synchronization Problem. This problem is the problem of finding a synchronization schema for the traffic lights in adjacent intersections that creates green waves, which are waves of vehicles that are traveling at a given speed and are able to cross multiple intersections without stopping at red lights.\nde Oliveira, Bazzan, and Lesser (2005) and Junges and Bazzan (2008) model this problem as a DCOP, where agents represent traffic lights, each controlling one variable that models the coordination direction for the associated traffic signal. Thus, the domain of the variables is given by two possible directions of coordination (north-south/south-north, east-west/west-east). Conflicts that arise when two neighboring traffic signals choose different directions are modeled as constraints. Cost functions are defined to model the number of incoming vehicles in a junction, and the costs are influenced by whether two adjacent agents agree on a direction of coordination or not. The goal is to minimize the global cost. Due to the dynamic nature of the problem, the proposed algorithms fall under the umbrella of Dynamic DCOP algorithms.\nPham, Tawfik, and Taylor (2013) and Brys, Pham, and Taylor (2014) proposed a Probabilistic DCOP-based approach with partial agent knowledge to solve the traffic light synchronization problem in the context where agents have partial information about their cost functions. In particular, the authors argue that traffic patterns may vary during time and, thus, the agents should learn them to update their cost functions. In this context, agents are given a limited amount of time to explore different signal duration intervals, whose associated costs are learned by evaluating the average travel time of the first 100 cars traveling across the agent’s traffic light."

      "text" : "DCOPs have emerged as a popular formalism for distributed reasoning and coordination in multiagent systems. It provides an elegant modeling framework, which offers flexibility in both the agents’ reasoning and coordination strategies. Its ability to support the notions of preferences and constraints makes it suitable to model a variety of multi-agent optimization problems. Preferences\nare a central concept of decision making and arise in a multitude of contexts in multi-agent systems. They are fundamental for the analysis of human choice behavior, and allow agents to express their inclinations through specific actions and behaviors. Constraints have been long studied in centralized systems (Rossi et al., 2006) and have been proved especially practical and efficient for modeling and solving resource allocation and scheduling problems. They are naturally handled within DCOPs and offer a flexible and effective mean to model a variety of complex problems. In addition, DCOPs support several aspects that are crucial in multi-agent systems, such as agent privacy, autonomy in reasoning, and cooperation.\nThe classical DCOP notion is unable to capture important aspects of the problem related with the environment characteristics, such as partial observability, environment evolution, and uncertainty. Therefore, several DCOP model extensions have been recently presented. Each DCOP model imposes distinctive algorithmic requirements, which concern both the agent’s reasoning and cooperation aspects. These requirements, in turn, are strictly related to the characteristics of the problem domain. Due to the performance variability imposed by such requirements, an appropriate selection of the DCOP model and algorithm is essential to obtain desirable performances in realistic application domains."

      "heading" : "9.1 Comparative Overview of DCOP Models",
      "text" : "Classical DCOPs can be used to represent a wide range of MAS applications where agents in a team need to work cooperatively to achieve a single goal in a static, deterministic, and fully observable environment. Exploring the domain structural properties, as well as understanding the requirements of the problem designer, is crucial to design and apply effective DCOP algorithms. A discussion on how to choose an appropriate algorithm based on the characteristic of the application at hand is provided in Section 4.4.\nAsymmetric DCOPs are suitable when constrained agents incur different costs for a joint action, which arise especially in scenarios where privacy is a particular concern, where agents cannot reveal to the other agents the costs associated to their putative actions. Examples of problems that can be suitably modeled as Asymmetric DCOPs are resource allocation problems where agents may have different gains from using the same resource, and where their preferences and constraints regarding usage time slots and durations are expected to be different. Asymmetric DCOPs are particularly attractive to model those domains that can be represented as graphical games (Kearns, Littman, & Singh, 2001), and where constraint reasoning could be actively used to exploit problem structure. In a graphical game, the utilities of each agent are affected exclusively by its neighboring agents. It is important to note that, even though the Asymmetric DCOP model bears similarities with many game-theoretic approaches, these two models are fundamentally different. While gametheoretic agents are self-interested, and their non-cooperative actions lead to a desirable global target, Asymmetric DCOP agents are cooperative and seek to minimize the global cost even at the expense of larger local costs.\nMulti-Objective DCOPs are tailored to represent those classes of distributed problems that cannot be modeled with a single optimization function. The observations above for classical DCOPs\nstill hold for Multi-Objective DCOPs and, in addition, agents cooperate to optimize multiple objectives. A number of MAS applications fall in the category of multi-objective optimization. One example is that of disaster management and coordination problems, where agents coordinate to effectively respond to an emergency scenario (see Section 8.1). Due to memory requirements, which are proportional to the number of objectives and the size of the Pareto set, incomplete strategies seem particularly promising for this research area.\nDynamic DCOPs capture the dynamic behavior of the evolving environment in which agents act. Dynamic environments play a fundamental role in real-wold MAS applications. Virtually all complex MAS applications involve dynamic situations, which may restructure the network topology due to agent movements, or bring additional information to the problem being solved. For example, in a search and rescue operation during disaster management, as the environment evolves over time, new information becomes available about the civilians to be rescued and new agencies may arrive at any time to help conduct rescue operations (see Section 8.1). In a smart grid domain, real-time pricing is commonly enforced. Thus, agent preferences need to be adapted over time, while energy costs are updated (see Section 8.7). Dynamic DCOPs are therefore a modern area that presents an exciting field for groundbreaking research.\nProbabilistic DCOPs extend the classical DCOP model to include the capability of handling uncertain events, allowing DCOP agents to handle a wider range of applications. In particular, Probabilistic DCOPs are suitable to capture those applications characterized by a static environment evolution with exogenous uncertain events (e.g., when the actions of agents on the environment can have different outcomes, based on external, uncertain factors) and, yet, agents have total knowledge of their own actions and of the observable environment and act in a fully cooperative context. The domain of multi-agent task planning and scheduling encompasses diverse problems that require complex models and robust solutions under uncertainty (see Section 8.4). The Probabilistic DCOP model for agents with partial knowledge is suitable to model those applications where agents have no prior knowledge of how the environment reacts to some of the actions. In such a model, the agents are aware of their own actions, which are performed deterministically. However, there is uncertainty in the cost associated to such actions, which is influenced by uncertain events that can be discovered over time. Thus, a common approach in such cases is to resort to sampling strategies, in order to obtain simple approximations of the probability distributions – in the form of sample realizations of the probabilistic costs. Due to the uncertainty arising in such problems, it is especially appealing to recur to solutions that adopt approaches to decision making under uncertainty, such as minimax, maximin, and regret-based methods.\nAs outlined in Table 3, more research effort is needed to solve DCOP models in which agents act in a combined uncertain and dynamic environment. This is by far the most realistic setting for teams of agents acting within a MAS. More generally, a coordination strategy that can adapt to the situation where the environment or network problem is evolving dynamically and rapidly and where several scenarios require different approaches to coordination, has not yet been studied.\nFinally, Quantified DCOPs model adversarial agents, which are common in many MAS applications. In a Quantified DCOP, universally quantified variables can be considered as the choice of the nature of an adversary. Quantified DCOPs can thus formalize application problems where\na team of agents seeks to limit the effect of the adversarial agents, as well as problems associated to planning under uncertainty. Examples of relevant applications include distributed surveillance planning problems, where sensors in a network need to coordinate their surveillance areas to detect intruders, whose positions are unknown and who are trying to avoid detection. Thus, the sensors try to find a robust plan that can handle different intruding scenarios (see Section 8.5).\nIn terms of complexity, solving classical, Asymmetric, Multi-Objective, and Dynamic DCOPs optimally is NP-hard. In contrast, the Probabilistic DCOP extension to include the capability of handling uncertain events and the Quantified DCOP extension to model adversarial agents comes at a cost of increasing complexity. Both Probabilistic DCOPs and Quantified DCOPs are PSPACEhard. Table 6 summarizes the complexity of the DCOP models discussed in this survey."

      "heading" : "9.2 Algorithms and Theoretical Analysis",
      "text" : "Despite the fact that classical DCOPs have reached a sufficient level of maturity from the algorithmic perspective, most of the other proposed formalisms fall short on both algorithmic and theoretical foundations. The proposed algorithms mostly extend classical DCOP algorithms and, therefore, they result in similar performance. Investigating strategies that are based on different backgrounds could help propel the evolution of this area.\nInter-disciplinary Research: In particular, further investigations on relating DCOPs to the areas of game theory and decision theory are necessary. Similar to the work of Chapman, Rogers, and Jennings (2008), where the authors study relationship between DCOPs and potential games, analyzing the relationship of DCOPs to auctions mechanisms could shed light on how to effectively address coordination and reasoning strategies in DCOP with partially cooperative agents. Another direction is to relate DCOP with machine learning techniques. For instance, as outlined by Kumar and Zilberstein (2011) and Ghosh, Kumar, and Varakantham (2015), one can use inference-based algorithms, such as expectation-maximization, and convex optimization machinery to develop efficient message-passing algorithm for solving large DCOPs. Additionally, merging insights from decision theory, such as handling partial observability, with the inherent DCOP ability of naturally exploiting problem structure could result in improved performance and/or refined models (Nair, Varakantham, Tambe, & Yokoo, 2005; Hoang et al., 2016, 2017).\nAnytime Mechanisms: Due to the complexity of the DCOP models, the study of incomplete approaches to solve large DCOPs whose agents may act in a dynamic and/or uncertain environment\nseems particularly suitable. Within the current incomplete methods proposed, a considerable effort has been employed in developing anytime algorithms (Zilberstein, 1996). Anytime algorithms can return a valid solution even if the DCOP agents are interrupted at any time before the algorithm terminates, and are expected to seek for solutions of increasing quality as they keep running (Zivan, Okamoto, & Peled, 2014). In addition to the anytime mechanism, which constrains the problem resolution within a particular time requirement, any-space algorithms have been proposed to limit the amount of space needed to an agent during problem resolution (Petcu & Faltings, 2007a; Yeoh et al., 2009b, 2011; Gutierrez et al., 2011). Similar to these mechanisms, we see an urge for investigating algorithms that allow problem resolution within any particular network load restriction. For instance, in a congested network agents might need to exchange smaller messages, or to communicate less frequently and/or with a restricted set of neighbors. Situations like these may arise in problems where a multitude of interconnected systems share the same medium, and thus limited bandwidth and interference may cause unsuitable delays. This context may be exacerbated with the advent of concepts such as the Internet of the Things, which expects to see million of connected devices, possibly sharing several mediums (Atzori, Iera, & Morabito, 2010; Chen, 2012; Miorandi, Sicari, De Pellegrini, & Chlamtac, 2012). Thus, orthogonal to the direction pursed by anytime and any-space algorithms, we envision the development of any-communication procedures.\nCoordination and Cooperation Study: Another open question is related to agent coordination. It has been observed that simple coordination strategies give good results in extremes (high or low) agent workload environments. However, at intermediate workload levels, such strategies lose their effectiveness, and more complex coordination strategies are necessary (Lesser, Decker, Wagner, Carver, Garvey, Horling, Neiman, Podorozhny, Prasad, Raja, et al., 2004; Zhang & Lesser, 2013). For example, Zhang and Lesser (2013) study agent learning, where coordination is driven by a dynamic decomposition of a DCOP, each solving smaller independent subproblems. Their proposal effectively produced near-optimal agent policies for learning and significantly reduced the amount of communication. These empirical observations suggest the existence of phase transition behaviors occurring at the level of agent coordination. A formal understanding of these phenomena, which looks at the environment, agents’ local reasoning strategies, their assumptions on other agents states, as well as team coordination, could help researchers to understand the inherent complexity of coordination problems. Such a formal framework could be useful to build new and more efficient coordination strategies for a wide variety of multi-agent applications, perhaps resembling the way studies of phase transitions of NP-hard problems (Monasson, Zecchina, Kirkpatrick, Selman, & Troyansky, 1999) led to the understanding of problem complexity and creation of effective heuristics and search strategies."

      "heading" : "9.3 Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks",
      "text" : "DCOP Solving Assumptions Modeling many real-world problems as DCOPs often require each agent to solve large complex subproblems, each requiring many variables and constraints. A limitation of most DCOP algorithms is the assumption that each agent controls exactly one variable, and that all constraints are binary. Such assumptions simplify the algorithm organization and pre-\nsentation. To operate under this assumption, reformulation techniques are commonly adpoted to transform a general DCOP into one where each agent controls exclusively one variable. There are two commonly used reformulation techniques (Burke & Brown, 2006; Yokoo, 2001): (i) Compilation (or complex variables) where each agent creates a new pseudo-variable whose domain is the Cartesian product of the domains of all variables of the agent; and (ii) Decomposition (or virtual agents) where each agent creates a pseudo-agent for each of its variables. While both techniques are relatively simple, they can be inefficient. In compilation, the memory requirement for each agent grows exponentially with the number of variables that it controls. In decomposition, the DCOP algorithms will treat two pseudo-agents as independent entities, resulting in unnecessary computation and communication costs. A more realistic view is to allow each agent to solve its local subproblem (in a centralized fashion) since it is independent of the subproblems of other agents. The agent’s subproblem resolution can then explore techniques from centralized reasoning, such as constraint optimization problems, linear programming, and graphical models. One can even exploit novel hardware platforms, such as graphical processing units (GPUs) to parallelize such solvers (Fioretto et al., 2016a; Fioretto, Le, Yeoh, Pontelli, & Son, 2015; Bistaffa, Farinelli, & Bombieri, 2014).\nResearchers have proposed re-designed versions of existing algorithms to be able to handle multi-variables agents problems (Davin & Modi, 2006; Khanna, Sattar, Hansen, & Stantic, 2009; Portway & Durfee, 2010). Additionally, recently, Grinshpoun (2015) and Fioretto, Yeoh, and Pontelli (2016b) have proposed general DCOP problem decompositions which are able to solve problems where agents control multiple variables.\nDCOP Modeling Language: Despite the wide applicability of the DCOP model, unfortunately, there is no general language being used to formally specify a DCOP. While there are several DCOP simulators, that include implementations of various DCOP algorithms using a common language specification (Sultanik, Modi, & Regli, 2007; Léauté, Ottens, & Szymanek, 2009; Wahbi, Ezzahir, Bessiere, & Bouyakhf, 2011), by and large, most stand-alone algorithms specify DCOPs in an ad-hoc manner. As a result, it is often inconvenient to experimentally compare different algorithms. More importantly, the great majority of such languages requires constraints values to be specified explicitly. Such requirement makes unpractical to convert problems which are naturally defined as mathematical optimization problems (such as Mixed Integer Programs) into an explicit form which specifies the utilities for each value combination of the variables in the scope of the problem constraints. The adoption of a common distributed constraint modeling language, which allows one to express constraints as standard algebraic or logic expressions, may be beneficial for developing standard benchmarks. Additionally, it would provide a tool for researchers outside the AI communities to model and test the applicability of new problems, extending the applicability of DCOPs to new areas. For instance, within the CP community, the adoption of the MiniZinc language (Nethercote, Stuckey, Becket, Brand, Duck, & Tack, 2007) to model CSPs and COPs has gained wide traction, and it is becoming a modeling choice even outside the CP community.\nDCOP Simulators: DCOP simulators are multi-agent software tools that simulate the execution of DCOP algorithms. These framework are a valid resource both for researchers within and out-\nside the MAS community, whom can implement, test, and compare different DCOP models or algorithms. There are currently several MAS simulators which have been adopted by researchers to develop and compare DCOP algorithms: • DisChoco (Wahbi et al., 2011) is a Java open-source framework for simulating DCOP algorithms\nwhere agents are executed asynchronously (each in a separate execution thread) and communication is implemented via messages passing. The simulator includes some problem generators and the possibility to take into account message loss, message corruption, and message delay. It supports models in which agents control multiple variables and problems with n-ary constraints. Additionally, it has the ability to be executed in a distributed environment. • Frodo (Léauté et al., 2009) is a Java open-source framework for DCOP which implements sev-\neral complete and incomplete classic DCOP algorithms, including DPOP and some of it variants, Max-Sum, MGM, and DSA. It can be executed either in a synchronous or in an asynchronous mode. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the problem structure and algorithm execution, and it includes some problem generators for benchmarking. It supports problems with n-ary constraints and models in which agents need to control the assignment of several variables. Additionally, it has the ability to be executed in a distributed environment. Finally, in addition to simulating DCOP algorithms in a centralized environment, it provides support for executing agents in a distributed environment. • AgentZero (Lutati, Gontmakher, Lando, Netzer, Meisels, & Grubshtein, 2014) is a Java open-\nsource framework for various MAS applications. It provides distributed runtime environment, which can be used to simulate both synchronous and asynchronous algorithms. AgentZero offers several high-level APIs which allow to easily handle complex tasks, such as the construction of a pseudo-tree and the evaluation of assignments. Additionally, it provides some built-in performance measures and some visualization tools which can be especially useful to debug distributed programs. It support the notion of message delays, message corruptions, and message losses. While it does not supports models in which agents control multiple variables, it can deal with n-ary constraints.\nIn addition to using DCOP simulators, researchers have developed and deployed DCOP algorithms using more general MAS platforms. In particular, the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE) (Bellifemine, Caire, & Greenwood, 2007) is a multi-agent platform that is compliant with the FIPA specifications.14 It includes a runtime environment where agents act, a set of APIs to define agents’ behaviors, and a suite of graphical tools that can be used to monitor the agents activity. JADE agents’ messages are specified by the ACL language, defined by the FIPA international standard for agent interoperability. JADE allows the deployment of agents on several environments, including mobile and wireless environments and fault-tolerant platforms.\nWe provide a summary of the simulators’ features in Table 7, in which we describe whether the simulator execution mode supports synchronous or asynchronous algorithms; whether it provides visualization tools; the type of implementation of messages passing simulation (i.e., using pointers, deep copying the message structure into the receiving agent’s message queue, etc.); if the\n14. http://www.fipa.org/\nframework provides support to simulate/handle message delays, message corruptions, and message losses; if it supports DCOP models in which agents control multiple variables and n-ary constraints; if the framework provides tools for debugging the algorithms; the programming language in which the simulator is implemented; whether it provides documentation; and whether it provides support for deployment. For a comprehensive review of multi-agent platforms, we refer the interested reader to the survey by Kravari and Bassiliades (2015).\nThe development of DCOP simulators have provided researchers with useful tools to develop new DCOP algorithms and to facilitate comparison of existing DCOP algorithms. However, all the DCOP simulators described above focus on the classical DCOP model, while Dynamic and Probabilistic DCOP simulators have received little attention. Thus, we see the need of developing high-fidelity simulators for Dynamic DCOPs, which simulate how the environment can vary over time, as well as for Probabilistic DCOPs, which simulate the stochastic nature of exogenous events.\nEvaluation and Metrics: Another open question in this research area concerns the definition of a systematic process to evaluate and compare the DCOP algorithms. There are multiple metrics that can be used to measure the runtime of an algorithm, such as the number of non-concurrent constraint checks (NCCCs) (Meisels, Kaplansky, Razgon, & Zivan, 2002), the simulated runtime (Sultanik, Lass, & Regli, 2008), and the number of cycles (Lynch, 1996). However, there is no consensus on a standard metric. Such issues, combined with absence of a general DCOP language, makes it inconvenient to experimentally compare different algorithms. In addition, new proposed algorithms are, in general, evaluated on arbitrary benchmarks, some inherited from the CSP literature, some other from approximations of real-world problems. To cope with these issues, it would be useful to develop a benchmark repository, perhaps by taking inspiration from the efforts made by the CP community with CSPLib,15 a library of test problems for constraint solvers, or by the planning community with their international planning competitions.16\n15. http://www.csplib.org/ 16. http://icaps-conference.org/index.php/Main/Competitions"

This point is added to the set of joint beliefs considered by the master problem, and the process is repeated until no new witness points can be found. The worst case runtime requirement of this algorithm is O(`|I|dl), which is dominated by the master problem, whose computation is exponential in the number of variables in the scope of the associated cost function for each belief and iteration of the algorithm. In terms of memory requirement, each ICG-Max-Sum agent needs O(|I|dl) amount of memory (dominated by the master problem again) to store all value combinations of neighboring variables for each belief. In terms of communication requirement, the number of messages sent is the same as that of Max-Sum since two parallel iterations of Max-Sum is executed in each ICG-Max-Sum iteration. However, the size of each message is O(|I|d) as it contains the aggregated cost of all the agent’s variable’s value for each belief. A variation of this algorithm that aims at minimizing the expected regret, rather than minimizing the maximum regret, was introduced by Le, Fioretto, Yeoh, Son, and Pontelli (2016).",

    "abstractText" : "The field of Multi-Agent System (MAS) is an active area of research within Artificial Intelligence, with an increasingly important impact in industrial and other real-world applications. In a MAS, autonomous agents interact to pursue personal interests and/or to achieve common objectives. Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) have emerged as a prominent agent model to govern the agents’ autonomous behavior, where both algorithms and communication models are driven by the structure of the specific problem. During the last decade, several extensions to the DCOP model have been proposed to enable support of MAS in complex, realtime, and uncertain environments. This survey provides an overview of the DCOP model, offering a classification of its multiple extensions and addressing both resolution methods and applications that find a natural mapping within each class of DCOPs. The proposed classification suggests several future perspectives for DCOP extensions, and identifies challenges in the design of efficient resolution algorithms, possibly through the adaptation of strategies from different areas.",
