This paper presents a Recurrent Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder architecture, in which an LSTM-based decoder is introduced to select, aggregate semantic elements produced by an attention mechanism over the input elements, and to produce the required utterances. The proposed generator can be jointly trained both sentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language sentences.

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Natural Language Generation (NLG) plays a critical role in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) with task is to convert a meaning representation produced by the Dialogue Manager into natural language utterances. Conventional approaches still rely on comprehensive hand-tuning templates and rules requiring expert knowledge of linguistic representation, including rulebased (Mirkovic et al., 2011), corpus-based ngram models (Oh and Rudnicky, 2000), and a trainable generator (Stent et al., 2004).\nRecently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) based approaches have shown promising performance in tackling the NLG problems. The RNNbased models have been applied for NLG as a\njoint training model (Wen et al., 2015a,b) and an end-to-end training model (Wen et al., 2016c). A recurring problem in such systems is requiring annotated datasets for particular dialogue acts1 (DAs). To ensure that the generated utterance representing the intended meaning of the given DA, the previous RNN-based models were further conditioned on a 1-hot vector representation of the DA. Wen et al. (2015a) introduced a heuristic gate to ensure that all the slot-value pair was accurately captured during generation. Wen et al. (2015b) subsequently proposed a Semantically Conditioned Long Short-term Memory generator (SC-LSTM) which jointly learned the DA gating signal and language model.\nMore recently, Encoder-Decoder networks (??), especially the attentional based models (Wen et al., 2016b; Mei et al., 2015) have been explored to solve the NLG tasks. The Attentional RNN Encoder-Decoder (Bahdanau et al., 2014) (ARED) based approaches have also shown improved performance on a variety of tasks, e.g., image captioning (Xu et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016), text summarization (Rush et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016).\nWhile the RNN-based generators with DA gating-vector can prevent the undesirable semantic repetitions, the ARED-based generators show signs of better adapting to a new domain. However, none of the models show significant advantage from out-of-domain data. To better analyze model generalization to an unseen, new domain as well as model leveraging the out-ofdomain sources, we propose a new architecture which is an extension of the ARED model. In order to better select, aggregate and control the semantic information, a Refinement Adjustment LSTM-based component (RALSTM) is introduced\n1A combination of an action type and a set of slot-value pairs. e.g. inform(name=’Bar crudo’; food=’raw food’)\nto the decoder side. The proposed model can learn from unaligned data by jointly training the sentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language sentences. We conducted experiments on four different NLG domains and found that the proposed methods significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods regarding BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and slot error rate ERR scores (Wen et al., 2015b). The results also showed that our generators could scale to new domains by leveraging the out-of-domain data. To sum up, we make three key contributions in this paper:\n• We present an LSTM-based component called RALSTM cell applied on the decoder\nside of an ARED model, resulting in an endto-end generator that empirically shows significant improved performances in comparison with the previous approaches.\n• We extensively conduct the experiments to evaluate the models training from scratch on\neach in-domain dataset.\n• We empirically assess the models’ ability to: learn from multi-domain datasets by pool-\ning all available training datasets; and adapt to a new, unseen domain by limited feeding amount of in-domain data.\nWe review related works in Section 2. Following a detail of proposed model in Section 3, Section 4 describes datasets, experimental setups, and evaluation metrics. The resulting analysis is presented in Section 5. We conclude with a brief summary and future work in Section 6."

      "text" : "Recently, RNNs-based models have shown promising performance in tackling the NLG problems. Zhang and Lapata (2014) proposed a generator using RNNs to create Chinese poetry. Xu et al. (2015); Karpathy and Fei-Fei (2015); Vinyals et al. (2015) also used RNNs in a multimodal setting to solve image captioning tasks. The RNN-based Sequence to Sequence models have applied to solve variety of tasks: conversational modeling (???), machine translation (??)\nFor task-oriented dialogue systems, Wen et al. (2015a) combined a forward RNN generator, a CNN reranker, and a backward RNN reranker to\ngenerate utterances. Wen et al. (2015b) proposed SC-LSTM generator which introduced a control sigmoid gate to the LSTM cell to jointly learn the gating mechanism and language model. A recurring problem in such systems is the lack of sufficient domain-specific annotated data. Wen et al. (2016a) proposed an out-of-domain model which was trained on counterfeited data by using semantically similar slots from the target domain instead of the slots belonging to the out-of-domain dataset. The results showed that the model can achieve a satisfactory performance with a small amount of in-domain data by fine tuning the target domain on the out-of-domain trained model.\nMore recently, RNN encoder-decoder based models with attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014) have shown improved performances in various tasks. Yang et al. (2016) proposed a review network to the image captioning, which reviews all the information encoded by the encoder and produces a compact thought vector. Mei et al. (2015) proposed RNN encoderdecoder-based model by using two attention layers to jointly train content selection and surface realization. More close to our work, Wen et al. (2016b) proposed an attentive encoder-decoder based generator which computed the attention mechanism over the slot-value pairs. The model showed a domain scalability when a very limited amount of data is available.\nMoving from a limited domain dialogue system to an open domain dialogue system raises some issues. Therefore, it is important to build an open domain dialogue system that can make as much use of existing abilities of functioning from other domains. There have been several works to tackle this problem, such as (Mrkšić et al., 2015) using RNN-based networks for multi-domain dialogue state tracking, (Wen et al., 2016a) using a procedure to train multi-domain via multiple adaptation steps, or (Gašić et al., 2015; Williams, 2013) adapting of SDS components to new domains."

      "heading" : "3 Recurrent Neural Language Generator",
      "text" : "The recurrent language generator proposed in this paper is based on a neural language generator (Wen et al., 2016b), which consists of three main components: (i) an Encoder that incorporates the target meaning representation (MR) as the model inputs, (ii) an Aligner that aligns and controls the semantic elements, and (iii) an RNN Decoder that\ngenerates output sentences. The generator architecture is shown in Figure 1. The Encoder first encodes the MR into input semantic elements which are then aggregated and selected by utilizing an attention-based mechanism by the Aligner. The input to the RNN Decoder at each time step is a 1-hot encoding of a token2 wt and an attentive DA representation dt. At each time step t, RNN Decoder also computes how much the feature value vector st−1 retained for the next computational steps, and adds this information to the RNN output which represents the probability distribution of the next token wt+1. At generation time, we can sample from this conditional distribution to obtain the next token in a generated sentence, and feed it as the next input to the RNN Decoder. This process finishes when an end sign is generated (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015), or some constraints are reached (Zhang and Lapata, 2014). The model can produce a sequence of tokens which can finally be lexicalized3 to form the required utterance.\n2Input texts are delexicalized where slot values are replaced by its corresponding slot tokens.\n3The process in which slot token is replaced by its value."

The i index runs over the L given slot-value pairs. In this work, we use a 1-layer, Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) to encode the sequence of slotvalue pairs4 embedding. The Bi-LSTM consists of forward and backward LSTMs which read the sequence of slot-value pairs from left-to-right and right-to-left to produce forward and backward sequence of hidden states ( −→ e1 , .., −→ eL), and ( ←− e1 , .., ←− eL), respectively.

Element-wise multiplication ⊙ plays a part in word-level matching which not only learns the vector similarity, but also preserves information about the two vectors. Wrh acts like a key phrase detector that learns to capture the pattern of generation tokens or the relationship between multiple tokens. In other words, the new input xt consists of information of the original input token wt, the DA representation dt, and the hidden context ht−1. rt is called a Refinement gate because the input tokens are refined by a combination gating information of the attentive DA representation dt and the\nprevious hidden state ht−1. By this way, we can represent the whole sentence based on the refined inputs.\nSecondly, the traditional LSTM network proposed by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (2014) in which the input gate ii, forget gate ft and output gates ot are introduced to control information flow and computed as follows:\n\n   it ft ot ĉt\n\n   =\n\n  \nσ σ σ\ntanh\n\n   W4n,4n\n\n xt dt\nht−1\n\n (8)\nwhere n is hidden layer size, W4n,4n is model parameters. The cell memory value ct is modified to depend on the DA representation as:\nct = ft ⊙ ct−1 + it ⊙ ĉt + tanh(Wcrrt) h̃t = ot ⊙ tanh(ct) (9)\nwhere h̃t is the output.\nThirdly, inspired by work of Wen et al. (2015b) in which the generator was further conditioned on a 1-hot representation vector s of given dialogue act, and work of Lu et al. (2016) that proposed a visual sentinel gate to make a decision on whether the model should attend to the image or to the sentinel gate, an additional gating cell is introduced on top of the traditional LSTM to gate another controlling vector s. Figure 6 shows how RALSTM controls the DA vector s. First, starting from the 1-hot vector of the DA s0, at each time step t the proposed cell computes how much the LSTM output h̃t affects the DA vector, which is computed as follows:\nat = σ(Waxxt + Wahh̃t) st = st−1 ⊙ at (10)\nwhere Wax, Wah are weight matrices to be learned. at is called an Adjustment gate since its task is to control what information of the given DA have been generated and what information should be retained for future time steps. Second, we consider how much the information preserved in the DA st can be contributed to the output, in which an additional output is computed by applying the output gate ot on the remaining information in st as follows:\nca = σ(Wosst) h̃a = ot ⊙ tanh(ca) (11)\nwhere Wos is a weight matrix to project the DA presentation into the output space, h̃a is the Adjustment cell output. Final RALSTM output is a combination of both outputs of the traditional LSTM cell and the Adjustment cell, and computed as follows:\nht = h̃t + h̃a (12)\nFinally, the output distribution is computed by applying a softmax function g, and the distribution can be sampled to obtain the next token,\nP (wt+1 | wt, ...w0,DA) = g(Whoht) wt+1 ∼ P (wt+1 | wt, wt−1, ...w0,DA) (13)\nwhere DA = (s, z)."

Overall, the proposed models consistently achieve the better performance regarding both evaluation metrics across all domains in all test cases.\nModel Comparison in an Unseen Domain\nThe ablation studies (Tables 2, 3) demonstrate the contribution of different model components\n5https://github.com/shawnwun/RNNLG\nin which the models were assessed without Adjustment cell (w/o A), or without Refinement cell (w/o R). It clearly sees that the Adjustment cell contributes to reducing the slot error rate ERR score since it can effectively prevent the undesirable slot-value pair repetitions by gating the DA vector s. A comparison between the ARED-based models (denoted by ♯ in Table 2) shows that the proposed models not only have better performance with higher the BLEU score but also significantly reduce the slot error rate ERR score by a large margin about 2% to 4% in every datasets. Moreover, a comparison between the models with gating the DA vector also indicates that the proposed models (w/o R, RALSTM) have significant improved performance on both the evaluation metrics across the four domains compared to the SCLSTM model. The RALSTM cell without the Refinement cell is similar as the SCLSTM cell. However, it obtained the results much better than the\nSCLSTM baselines.

This paper presents a Recurrent Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder architecture, in which an LSTM-based decoder is introduced to select, aggregate semantic elements produced by an attention mechanism over the input elements, and to produce the required utterances. The proposed generator can be jointly trained both sentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language sentences. The proposed model was extensively evaluated on four different NLG datasets. The experimental results showed that the proposed generators not only consistently outperform the previous methods across all the NLG domains but also show an ability to generalize from a new, unseen domain and learn from multi-domain datasets.",
