      "text" : "Human learning is characterized by the cooperative transmission of data [21]. In addition to direct observations and taking actions in one’s own environment, humans also engage in purposeful selection of data whose goal is conveying knowledge about the world to less knowledgeable agents. Moreover, less knowledgeable agents assume purposeful, cooperative selection and leverage cooperation to augment learning. The cooperative selection of data, and learning from such data, plays a central role in theories of cognition [1], cognitive development [11], and cultural evolution [22]. Indeed, this cooperative inference is argued to be the feature that drives accumulation of knowledge over generations [23, 6].\nSuch communication through cooperative inference has received relatively limited attention in machine learning. The principles that appear to drive human cultural knowledge accumulation may also be leveraged in machines to achieve similar ends. A recent effort in this direction is machine teaching [25, 10], which formalizes how to translate and communicate model inferences using data. While this development begins to address how communication between learning models could occur, it is mute on the effectiveness of communication between models, and does not formalize cooperative inference by both the teacher and the learner.\nIn this paper, we address this lack by introducing a measure of communication effectiveness in the cooperative setting. The role that this measure plays in cooperative knowledge accumulation is analogous to the role that training and test errors play in traditional machine learning. We also use the measure to extend the teaching dimension [12, 26]—a classical measure of communication efficiency1—from deterministic to probabilistic settings. We show how analyzing this measure reveals the conditions, in terms of constraints on learning model’s inductive biases, under which cooperation may produce optimal communication.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we first introduce a Transmission Index that quantifies communication effectiveness for any pair of probabilistic inference and data selection processes.

In Sections 4, we introduce cooperative inference based on previous research in human social learning [15, 17], present a Cooperative Index by extend the Transmission index to the cooperative setting, and identify the condition that must be satisfied to achieve optimal communication. In Section 5, we conclude with connections to human, machine, and human-machine learning."

      "text" : "In this section, we define Transmission Index to quantify the communication effectiveness. Communication occurs between two agents, which we call a teacher and a learner. Here the teacher represents the process of selecting data to convey a particular concept, and the learner represents the inference process of interpreting the received data. In a probabilistic setting, the effectiveness of communication is related to the probability that the learner’s interpretation matches the teacher’s intended concept.\nDefinition 2.1. Let h be a concept in a finite concept space H. A data set space, D, is a collection of subsets of a given finite set of data points. D ∈ D is called a data set. Further, let PT(D|h) be the teacher’s probability of selecting a data set D for communicating a given concept h and PL(h|D) be the learner’s posterior for h given data set D. We denote the size of H and D by |H| and |D|, respectively.\nBecause H and D are both discrete, in matrix notation, we can form the row-stochastic learner’s inference matrix, L ∈ [0, 1]|D|×|H|, having elements PL(h|D), and the column-stochastic teacher’s selection matrix, T ∈ [0, 1]|D|×|H|, having elements PT(D|h).\nDefinition 2.2. The Transmission Index (TI) is defined as\nTI(L,T) = 1\n|H| |H|∑ j=1 |D|∑ i=1 Li,jTi,j .\nIn connection to information theory, the Transmission Index can be understood as a measure of the effectiveness of information through coding information, sending the code, and then decoding. In our context, the channel is not arbitrary but is restricted to be the data, i.e., information is transmitted by passing data. Similarly, the decoding and coding are not arbitrary but correspond to the inference process and data selection process, and does not need to be agreed upon beforehand.\nNow we give a few examples to show that TI captures how well on average a concept in a given concept space can be communicated with a given data set space. Also, note that in the case where H and D are clear from the context, we represent TI(L,T) simply by TI.\nExample 2.3. Let |D| = |H| = 2. Consider this teacher’s selection matrix, T = (\n1 0 0 1\n) , and these three\nlearner’s inference matrices, L(a) = ( 1 0 0 1 ) , L(b) = ( 0 1 1 0 ) , and L(c) = ( 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 ) .\nIn the first case (a), TI(L(a),T) = 1, because the concept that the teacher intends to teach through a certain data set matches perfectly what the learner would infer given that data set. In the second case (b), TI(L(b),T) = 0, because the concept that the teacher intends to teach through a certain data set leads the learner to infer the other concept with certainty. In the last case (c), TI(L(c),T) = 12 . Here the learner’s inference is ambiguous, and TI captures that. In summary, TI captures the expected probability that the learner will interpret the teacher’s intention correctly.\nProposition 2.4. The range of the Transmission Index is 0 ≤ TI ≤ 1, and TI = 1 if and only if two conditions hold: (i) Li,j = 1 if Ti,j > 0 for all i, j, and (ii) there is no zero column in L and T. Also, TI = 1 implies that |D| ≥ |H|, with equality achieved when L and T are the same permutation matrix.\nProof. TI ≥ 0 because T and L are stochastic matrices, and TI = 0 if and only if for any i, j, either Li,j = 0 or Ti,j = 0.\nWe show TI ≤ 1:\nTI(L,T) = 1\n|H| |H|∑ j=1 |D|∑ i=1 Li,jTi,j ≤ (a) 1 |H| |H|∑ j=1  |D|∑ i=1 Ti,j  ≤ (b) 1 |H| |H|∑ j=1 1 = 1. (1)\nInequality (a) in (1) becomes an equality if and only if condition (i) is satisfied. This is because in order for Li,jTi,j = Ti,j , we need (Li,j − 1)Ti,j = 0, and this implies that Li,j = 1 or Ti,j = 0, for any i, j. Inequality (b) in (1) follows from T being a column-stochastic matrix, and it becomes an equality if and only if condition (ii) is satisfied.\nGiven that L is a row-stochastic matrix, if Li,j = 1, then there is no other non-zero elements in row i. This means that there are at most |D| elements with value one in L; hence, by condition (i) the number of non-zero elements in T is at most |D|. Also, condition (ii) requires that the number of non-zero elements in T be at least |H|. Therefore, |D| ≥ |H|, with equality achieved if and only if T has only one positive element for each column. Together with condition (i), this implies that L has at least one element with value one in each column. Because L is row-stochastic, this implies L is a permutation matrix. Condition (i) also implies that if Li,j < 1, then Ti,j = 0. Together with condition (ii), T is the same permutation matrix.\nRemark 2.5. TI is invariant under joint row and column permutations of L and T. When |H| = |D| and TI = 1, row and column exchangeability implies that L and T can always be arranged into an identity matrix of order |H|.\nRemark 2.6. TI is well-defined even when one of H and D is countably infinite; that is, the definition of TI can be modified to\nTI(L,T) := lim n→|H| lim m→|D|\n1\nn n∑ j=1 m∑ i=1 Li,jTi,j ,\nand the limit exists in those two cases. For the case where |D| → ∞ and |H| is finite, one can show that the above limit exists because TI increases with m and has an upper bound. For the case where |H| → ∞ and |D| is finite, TI(L,T) = 0 because there is always infinitely many untaught concepts given finitely many examples. However, when both H and D are countably infinite, TI is not generally well-defined. In particular, it is possible to construct a pair of L and T that causes the limit of TI to bounce in the interval [0, 1]. See Supplementary Material for full detail."

      "heading" : "3 Connection to Average Teaching Dimension",
      "text" : "In this section, we make the connection between the Transmission Index and the Average Teaching Dimension. The Average Teaching Dimension is a variant of Teaching Dimension, a classic measure for quantifying the efficiency of teaching. The Teaching Dimension is well-studied; it has formal connections with the VC Dimension [12] and has been analyzed for certain models in continuous concept space [14] and in cooperative settings [26, 8]. However, Teaching Dimension and these analyses assume a deterministic the learning model and focus on efficiency rather than effectiveness. To make connection to the analysis of Teaching Dimension, we first extend the Transmission Index, a measure of effectiveness, to the Expected Teaching Dimension, a measure of efficiency. Then we show that the Expected Teaching Dimension, which is well-defined for probabilistic knowledge transmission, is the same as the Average Teaching Dimension as the knowledge transmission becomes deterministic.\nThe analyses of Teaching Dimension are typically couched in the concept learning framework. In this framework, a concept, h, is a function that maps an instance, x, to a label, y. By observing examples, pairs of (x, y), the learner can rule out concepts that are not consistent with the examples. With this notation, we can define the Average Teaching Dimension:\nDefinition 3.1 (Average Teaching Dimension). A concept h ∈ H is consistent with a data set D if and only if for every data point (x, y) ∈ D, h(x) = y. D ∈ D is a teaching set for concept h ∈ H if h, but no other concept in H, is consistent with D. Let D∗(h) ⊂ D be the collection of teaching sets in D for concept h. The classical version of Average Teaching Dimension [8] is defined as follows: First, for any h ∈ H, let\nTD(h) = { ∞ if D∗(h) is empty minD∈D∗(h)|D| otherwise ,\nwhere |D| is the size of the data set D. Then, the Average Teaching Dimension (ATD) for the concept space H is\nATD(H) = 1 |H| ∑ h∈H TD(h).\nExpected Teaching Dimension extends the Transmission Index to incorporate data set size as follows:\nDefinition 3.2. The Expected Teaching Dimension (ETD) is defined as ETD(H) = ∑ h∈H ∑ D∈D |D|PL(h|D)PT(D|h)∑\nh∈H ∑ D∈D PL(h|D)PT(D|h) .\nDefinition 3.3. Let M ∈ [0, 1]|D|×|H| be a matrix, where the element M i,j represents the probability that hi is consistent with Dj . We define C ∈ {0, 1}|D|×|H| to be a consistency matrix, where Ci,j = 1 if hi is consistent with Dj and Ci,j = 0 otherwise. C can be sampled from M by treating Ci,j as the outcome of a Bernoulli trial with parameter M i,j .\nProposition 3.4. Let |H| = |D| = N , and C be a consistency matrix of size N ×N . Let L and T be the the row-normalized and column-normalized matrices of C, respectively. Then, ATD(H) is finite if and only if TI(L,T) = 1.\nProof. ATD(H) is finite if and only if TD(h) is finite for all h ∈ H. Finite TD(h) means that there is at least one teaching set D ∈ D for h. Let αi ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , N} be the index set for the teaching sets of hi. Because every D can only belong to at most one D∗(hi), so αi ⊂ {1, · · · , N}\\ ∪j 6=i αj for every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}. Further because |D| = |H|, this construction of αi implies that if |αi| > 1 for some i, then there must exist at least one j 6= i with the property that |αj | = 0. However, because TD(hi) is finite, αi cannot be an empty set for any i. Hence, |αi| = 1 for all i. In particular, this implies that C is a permutation matrix. Thus, ATD(H) is finite if and only if C is a permutation matrix. C being a permutation matrix implies that C = L = T, which by Proposition 2.4 is equivalent to TI(L,T) = 1.\nExample 3.5. If L = T and is a permutation matrix, C = T. As we proved in Proposition 3.4, ETD is the same as ATD.\nExample 3.6. We give an example when ETD is finite but ATD is infinite in the probabilistic setting. Let |H| = |D| = 2, M = (\n1 1/2 0 1/2\n) . There are four possible consistency matrices that can be sampled from\nM : C(a) = ( 1 0 0 0 ) , C(b) = ( 1 0 0 1 ) , C(c) = ( 1 1 0 0 ) , C(d) = ( 1 1 0 1 ) . For C(a), C(c) and C(d), the corresponding ATD(H) is ∞, and for C(b) it is |D1|+|D2|2 . Let L (∗) and T(∗) be the row-normalized and columnnormalized matrices of C(∗), respectively, for ∗ ∈ {a, b, c, d}. Then, TI(L(a),T(a)) = 12 , TI(L (b),T(b)) = 1, TI(L(c),T(c)) = 12 , and TI(L (d),T(d)) = 58 , with ETD(H) = |D1|, |D1|+|D2| 2 , |D1|, 3|D1|+2|D2| 5 , respectively. Thus, ETD can be seen as an generalization of ATD from scenarios of perfect transmission (TI = 1) to those of imperfect transmission (0 ≤ TI ≤ 1) as well.\nIn Definition 3.3, probabilistic transmission is expressed as the sampling of consistency matrices. This corresponds to the view that there is a distribution of learning scenarios and the learner can be uncertain which scenario is selected. Another way probabilistic transmission can enter is that M represents the degree of consistency between data and hypotheses. In this case, the learner would need to make a decision on\nwhat the underlying true consistency matrix is. Consider M = ( 1 1/2 0 1/2 ) again. A simple decision rule is to round up M i,j to 1 if it exceeds a threshold and down to 0 otherwise. This decision rule would result in either C(a) or C(d), both of which correspond to ATD =∞."

      "heading" : "4 Optimal cooperative inference",
      "text" : "The Transmission Index introduced in Section 2 assumes that the learner and teacher, or more abstractly, the inference process and the data selection process, are independent. However, communication for the transmission of knowledge is often cooperative (e.g., in pedagogy [9, 10] and conversations [13]). Here, cooperation implies that the teacher’s selection of data depends on what the learner is likely to infer and vice versa. In this section, we formalize cooperative inference, which captures this inter-dependency between the two processes of inference and selection [15, 17]. It can be seen as a way to map a common convention to another one that is more effective at transmitting knowledge without a priori agreement on the encoding of data-concept pairs [26]. We define Cooperative Index as a measure of communication effectiveness in the cooperative setting by applying the Transmission Index to cooperative inference. Finally, we provide proofs regarding the form of the shared likelihood matrix required to maximize the cooperative index and optimize cooperative inference.\nDefinition 4.1. [Cooperative inference] Let D ∈ D and h ∈ H, we define cooperative inference as a system of two equations:\nPL(h|D) = PT(D|h)PL0(h)\nPL(D) (2a)\nPT(D|h) = PL(h|D)PT0(D)\nPT(h) , (2b)\nwhere PL(h|D) and PT(D|h) are defined in Definition 2.1, PL0(h) is the learner’s prior of h, PT0(D) is the teacher’s prior of selecting D, PL(D) = ∑ h∈H PT(D|h)PL0(h) is the normalizing constant for PL(h|D), and\nPT(h) = ∑ D∈D PL(h|D)PT0(D) is normalizing constant for PT(D|h).\nThe cooperative inference equations in (2) can be solved using fixed-point iteration [15, 17]: Define an initial likelihood, or common convention, PT(D|h) = P0(D|h), for the first evaluation of (2a). Then, given PL0(h) and PT0(D), one can evaluate (2a), use the resulting PL(h|D) to evaluate (2b), and iterate until convergence. By symmetry, the iteration can also begin with (2b). This symmetry implies that the initial likelihood matrix, M ∈ [0, 1]|D|×|H| with elements P0(D|h), can be an arbitrary non-negative matrix because it always gets appropriately normalized in the first iteration.\nFor the remainder of the paper, we assume that PL0 and PT0 are uniform distributions over H and D, respectively. In this case, the the fixed-point iteration of (2) depends only on M and is simply the repetition of column and row normalization on M . Without loss of generality, we also assume that the iteration begins with (2a).\nDefinition 4.2. Let L(k) and T(k) be the matrices with elements PL(h|D) and PT(D|h), respectively, at the kth iteration of (2). If the iteration of (2) converges, we define L(∞) := limk→∞ L\n(k) and T(∞) := limk→∞T (k).\nDefinition 4.3 (Cooperative Index, CI). Given M and assuming that the fixed-point iteration of (2) converges, we define the cooperative index as\nCI(M ) = TI(L(∞),T(∞)) = 1\n|H| |H|∑ j=1 |D|∑ i=1 L (∞) i,j T (∞) i,j .\nWe further assume that M is a square matrix unless otherwise stated. Then, the iteration of (2) becomes the well-known Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, which provably converges under certain conditions by Sinkhorn’s theorem [19]. Below, we state a simpler version of Sinkhorn’s theorem.\nDefinition 4.4 (Positive diagonal). If M is a n×n square matrix and σ is a permutation of {1, · · · , n}, then a sequence of positive elements {M i,σ(i)}ni=1 is called a positive diagonal. If σ is the identity permutation, the diagonal is called the main diagonal.\nTheorem 4.5 (A simpler version of Sinkhorn’s theorem [19]). Given any nonnegative square matrix M with at least one positive diagonal, L(k) and T(k) in the fixed-point iteration of (2) converges to the same doubly stochastic matrix, M(∞), as k →∞.\nProof. Here we provide a sketch of the proof (see Supplementary Material for full detail). We pick one positive diagonal. First we show the product of all elements on that diagonal is positive and upper-bounded by 1 throughout the fixed-point iteration of (2). Given uniform priors on both hypothesis and data set space, we then use inequality of arithmetic and geometric means to prove that the product either stay the same or increase throughout the iteration. Finally, monotone convergence theorem of real numbers guarantees that the product will converge to its supremum, at which point L and T must have converged to the same doubly stochastic matrix.\nAs is for TI, If M is clear from the context, we denote CI(M ) simply by CI for brevity. Now, we give two simple examples: The first demonstrates the fixed-point iteration of (2); the second compares cooperative inference with machine teaching [25].\nExample 4.6. Let M = ( 1 1 0 1 ) , then L(k) = ( 1− 12k 1 2k 0 1 ) and T(k) = ( 1 12k+1 0 1− 12k+1 ) . Notice that zero elements remain zero throughout the iteration process, but non-zero elements may converge to zero. Since\nL(∞) and T(∞) are both the identity matrix, CI = 1. In contrast, after one iteration of (2), L(1) = ( 1/2 1/2 0 1 ) ,\nT(1) = ( 1 1/3 0 2/3 ) , and TI(L(1),T(1)) is only 23 . Similarly, for any k, TI(L (k),T(k)) < 1. Thus, cooperative inference increases the effectiveness of communication.\nExample 4.7. We apply cooperative index to examples previously used in human teaching [4] and machine teaching [14], and compare the effectiveness of cooperative inference and other communication protocols.\nThe first example [4, 5, 16] tested children’s learning of hidden functions of a novel toy after observing data presented by an experimenter. Empirical results [4, 5] have shown that when the experimenter activated one function accidentally (accidental demonstration), children inferred the toy to afford at least one function, and they also explored possible additional functions. However, when the experimenter activated one function pedagogically (pedagogical demonstration), children inferred that the toy afford one and only one function, which restrained their exploration of additional functions.\nThese results can be explained as two different communication protocols having different effectiveness. In the case of accidental demonstration (A), the learner assigns equal likelihood to all hypotheses that are consistent with the observed data, and assumes the experimenter to randomly choose a random subset of functions to demonstrate. The experiment considered three concepts (the novel toy has zero, one, or two functions) and three data sets (zero, one, or two functions demonstrated). Given this order for the concepts\nand data sets, L(A) = 1/3 1/3 1/30 1/2 1/2 0 0 1  and T(A) = 1 1/2 1/30 1/2 1/3 0 0 1/3 . This communication protocol entails much uncertainty for the correspondence between data and hypothesis, which is captured by a low TI: TI(L(A),T(A)) = 0.453. In contrary, under pedagogical demonstration (P), both parties apply cooperative inference on the selection and interpretation of data [16], which leads to a perfectly effective communication protocol, TI(L(P ),T(P )) = CI(M = L(A)) = 1. This explains the empirical finding that children inferred the toy to afford exactly the number of functions demonstrated by the experimenter.\nThe second example [14] considers a version-space learner who is trying to learn a threshold classifier hθ, θ ∈ {1 . . . 3}. For x ∈ {0 . . . 3}, hθ returns y = − if x < θ and y = + if x ≥ θ. Assume a teacher provides training sets D = {(x1, y1), (x2, y2)}, and the learner assigns the same likelihood to all hypotheses that are consistent with the data. Following [14], machine teaching chooses data that maximize the likelihood for the learner to infer the correct hypothesis:\nL = {x1, y1, x2, y2}\\hθ h1 h2 h3 {0,−, 1,+} 1 0 0 {0,−, 2,+} 1/2 1/2 0 {0,−, 3,+} 1/3 1/3 1/3 {1,−, 2,+} 0 1 0 {1,−, 3,+} 0 1/2 1/2 {2,−, 3,+} 0 0 1 , T(mt) = {x1, y1, x2, y2}\\hθ h1 h2 h3 {0,−, 1,+} 1 0 0 {0,−, 2,+} 0 0 0 {0,−, 3,+} 0 0 0 {1,−, 2,+} 0 1 0 {1,−, 3,+} 0 0 0 {2,−, 3,+} 0 0 1 .\nTI of L and T(mt) can be understood as the effectiveness of machine teaching as a communication protocol. When all data sets are considered (as shown above), the effectiveness of machine teaching is perfect, TI(L,T(mt)) = 1, which is higher than the effectiveness of cooperative inference, CI(M = L) = 0.734. However when data sets are restricted, such as when only considering the first three rows of the data above, the effectiveness of cooperative inference can be higher than that of machine teaching CI(L ′ ) = 1. TI(L,T(mt) ′ ) = 0.611.\nGiven the cooperative index, which quantifies the effectiveness of transmission for cooperative inference, we can prove conditions under which M maximizes CI:\nDefinition 4.8. A square matrix is triangular if it has a positive main diagonal, and has only zeros below (upper-triangular) or above (lower-triangular) the main diagonal.\nTheorem 4.9 (Representation theorem for cooperative inference). Let M be a nonnegative square matrix with at least one positive diagonal, then the following are equivalent.\n(a) The corresponding cooperative index is optimal, i.e. CI(M ) = 1;\n(b) M has exactly one positive diagonal;\n(c) M is a permutation of an upper-triangular matrix.\nProof. From Proposition 2.4 we know that CI(M ) = TI(M(∞),M(∞)) = 1 if and only if M(∞) is a permutation matrix. Since elements of M that lie in a positive diagonal do not tend to zero during cooperative inference [19] (i.e. if M i,j 6= 0 lies in a positive diagonal, then M(∞)i,j 6= 0), M(∞) is a permutation matrix if and only if M has exactly one positive diagonal. So we have (a) ⇐⇒ (b). (b) ⇐⇒ (c) is a fact of linear algebra which can be proved by induction on the dimension n of M (see Supplementary Material for full detail).\nTheorem 4.9 shows that in order to achieve optimal cooperative inference and thereby effective knowledge accumulation, the shared inductive bias should be one that constraints the form of M to be upper triangular (or permutation thereof). This in turn constraints the learner’s likelihood function such that it applies zero probability to particular data-concept relationships. Below, we show an example of using CI to investigate the form of the likelihood that leads to optimal transmission effectiveness.\nExample 4.10. Consider polynomial regression. In order to have a triangular M , the likelihood must have finite support. We explore the behavior of CI under different likelihood functions, ranging from fat-tailed to compact. In particular, we explore the conditions under which the different distributions lead to optimal CI.\nLet {xi}6i=1 = {−1,−1, 0, 0, 1, 1} and {yi}6i=1 = {a,−a,∆ + a,∆ − a, a,−a}. ∆/a can be viewed as a signal-to-noise ratio for a second-order polynomial. Let D = {D1, D2}, where D1 = {x1, . . . , x4, y1, . . . , y4} and D2 = {x1, . . . , x6, y1, . . . , y6}. Let H = {h1, h2}, where hi is a polynomial of order i with a likelihood function that defines the assumed noise distribution. The likelihood function is a q-Gaussian Nq(z;µ) set to have unit variance. We construct the M via maximum likelihood as a function of ∆ and a for q = (0, 1, 1.5). Briefly, we find the maximum-likelihood estimate of hi to Dj , then assign M i,j the likelihood produced by that estimate (see Supplementary Material for more details). Having obtained these M matrices, we iterate them according to (2) to explore the behavior of CI.\nIn Figure 1 we show the phase diagrams of CI for the three q-Gaussian distributions, which correspond to a compact (q = 0), normal (q = 1), and fat-tailed (q = 1.5) distributions respectively. This result shows that when the error likelihood is a compact distribution, there exists at least one setting of a such that CI = 1 for all ∆ > 0. This is not the case when the error likelihood has infinite support, i.e. q = 1 or q = 1.5. As suggested by Theorem 4.9, modeling choices that yield M s that are closer to triangular, such as compact likelihood functions, can produce optimal cooperative inference."

We have presented a Transmission Index to\nquantify the effectiveness of knowledge transmission via data, connected to previous approaches focusing on efficiency, presented a Cooperative Index to quantify effectiveness of cooperative transmission, proven bidirectional conditions that relate inductive biases to optimal cooperative inference, and provided a simulation that illustrates how to modify classic learning models to improve cooperative transmission of knowledge.\nOur results inform theory across fields. For fields interested in human learning, our representation theorem for cooperative inference (Theorem 4.9) provides the first predictions about how cognition would be structured if it were optimized to facilitate transmission of knowledge in over generations. For fields interested in machine learning, there has been much interest in whether machine learning is interpretable or explainable (e.g., banking [20], medicine [18], self-driving cars [3]). We have provided a theoretical framework for evaluating the degree to which an algorithm is explainable, and presented one case where simple modifications may yield improved explanation by examples."

We denote the matrix with elements PL(h|D) by L ∈ [0, 1]|D|×|H|, the matrix with elements PT(D|h) by T ∈ [0, 1]|D|×|H|, and the matrix with elements P0(D|h) by M ∈ [0, 1]|D|×|H|. Further, denote the vectors consisting of PL0(h) and PT(h) by a,d ∈ [0, 1]|H|×1, vectors consisting of PT0(D) and PL(D) by b, c ∈ [0, 1]|D|×1, respectively. Given a, b, and M , the fixed-point iteration of the cooperative inference equations can be expressed as:\nPL1(h|D) = P0(D|h)PL0(h)\nPL1(D) ⇐⇒ L(1) = Diag\n( 1\nM a\n) M Diag(a) (3a)\nPTk+1(D|h) = PLk+1(h|D)PT0(D)\nPTk+1(h) ⇐⇒ T(k+1) = Diag(b) L(k+1)Diag\n( 1\nd(k+1)\n) (3b)\nPTk+1(h) = ∑ D∈D PLk(h|D)PT0(D) ⇐⇒ d(k+1) = (L(k+1))T b (3c)\nPLk+1(h|D) = PTk(D|h)PL0(h)\nPLk+1(D) ⇐⇒ L(k+1) = Diag\n( 1\nc(k+1)\n) T(k)Diag(a) (3d)\nPLk+1(D) = ∑ h∈H PTk(D|h)PL0(h) ⇐⇒ c(k+1) = T(k)a, (3e)\nwhere, k denotes the iteration step, and Diag(z) denotes the diagonal matrix with elements of the vector z on its diagonal, and 1z denotes element-wise inverse for any vector z.\nNote that (3b) and (3c) are the operations to column normalize Diag(b) L(k), and (3d) and (3e) are the operations to row normalize T(k)Diag(a). Zero rows in L(k) and zero columns in T(k) are fixed throughout the iteration of (3). This is equivalent to removing the zero rows and zero columns of M for (3) and inserting them back at convergence or when the iteration is stopped.\nNow we provide a version of the proof using the notations introduced in the paper. The original proof can be found in [19]. Remember that a and b are assumed to be uniform.\nProof. Let σ be a permutation of {1, · · · , n} that makes {M i,σ(i)}ni=1 a positive diagonal. Define\ne(k) := n∏ i=1 L (k) i,σ(i); f (k) := n∏ i=1 T (k) i,σ(i).\nApplying (3a), L(1) is a row-stochastic matrix, and {L(1)i,σ(i)} n i=1 is a positive diagonal, hence e (1) is positive. Also, by applying (3b),\nf (1) = n∏ i=1 T (1) i,σ(i) = n∏ i=1 biL(1)i,σ(i) d (1) σ(i)  = e(1) nn ∏n i=1 d (1) σ(i) = e(1) nn ∏n i=1 d (1) i . (4)\nBy the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, (∏n\ni=1 d (1) i ) 1 n ≤ 1n ∑n i=1 d (1) i . Also, L (1) is a row-\nstochastic matrix and we assumed uniform prior on data set space, hence by (3c),\nnn n∏ j=1 d (1) j ≤  n∑ j=1 d (1) j n =  n∑ i=1 n∑ j=1 bjL (1) i,j n =  1 n n∑ i=1 n∑ j=1 L (1) i,j n = 1 (5) The Equality in (5) is achieved if and only if d = ( 1 n , . . . , 1 n ) , or equivalently, L(1) being a doubly stochastic matrix. Because f (1) is the product of n values between 0 and 1,\n0 < e(1) ≤ (a) f (1) ≤ (b) 1, (6)\nwith equality in (a) if and only if L(1) is a doubly stochastic matrix, and equality in (b) if and only if L(1) is a permutation matrix. By the same logic applied to equations (3d) and (3e),\n0 < f (1) ≤ (c) e(2) ≤ (d) 1,\nwith equality in (c) if and only if T(1) is a doubly stochastic matrix, and equality in (d) if and only if T(1) is a permutation matrix. Repeating this argument, we get the increasing sequence\n0 < e(1) ≤ f (1) ≤ e(2) ≤ f (2) ≤ · · · ≤ 1.\nMonotone convergence theorem of real numbers guarantees that this sequence converges to its supremum\nlim k→∞ e(k) = lim k→∞ f (k) = sup{e, f}.\ne(k) = f (k) = e(k+1) asymptotically, therefore L(k) and T(k) are both doubly stochastic matrices.

      "text" : "Proof. (1) (a) ⇐⇒ (b): We first prove that (a) CI(M ) = 1, and (b) M has exactly one positive diagonal, are equivalent. Since M is an n × n nonnegative matrix with at least one positive diagonal, Theorem 4.5 guarantees that the iteration of equation set (3) converges to a doubly stochastic matrix, M(∞). According to Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem [2, 24], there exist θ1, . . . , θk ∈ (0, 1] with ∑ i θi = 1 and distinct permutation\nmatrices P1, . . . , Pk such that M (∞) = θ1P1 + · · ·+ θkPk. To simplify, we adopt the inner product notation between matrices: A · B = ∑ i,j Ai,jBi,j , for any two n × n square matrices A and B. Then the following holds.\nCI = TI(M(∞),M(∞)) = (I)\n1 n M(∞) · M(∞) = (II) 1 n ( ∑ i θiPi) · ( ∑ j θjPj) = (III) 1 n ∑ i,j θiθjPi · Pj\nEquality (I) comes from rewriting TI in the inner product notation. Equality (II) comes from substituting M(∞) by its Birkhoff–von Neumann decomposition. Equality (III) comes from distribution.\nFurther as permutation matrices, Pi · Pj ≤ n, and the equality holds if and only if Pi = Pj . So we have that,\nCI(M ) = 1\nn ∑ i,j θiθjPi · Pj ≤ (IV ) 1 n ∑ i,j θiθjn = ∑ i,j θiθj = ( ∑ i θi)× ( ∑ j θj) = 1\nThe equality in (IV) holds if and only if Pi = Pj for any i, j. Note that P1, . . . , Pk are distinct, i.e. Pi 6= Pj when i 6= j. So the equality in (IV) is achieved precisely when k = 1 and M(∞) = P1. Hence, CI(M ) is maximized if and only if M(∞) is a permutation matrix.\nWe then prove that M(∞) is a permutation matrix if and only if M has exactly one positive diagonal. This follows the claim (1): elements of M that lie in a positive diagonal do not tend to zero during the cooperative inference iteration [19] (i.e. if M i,j 6= 0 lies in a positive diagonal, then M(∞)i,j 6= 0). Claim (1) implies that M(∞) and M have the same number of positive diagonals. Further note that a doubly stochastic matrix has exactly one diagonal if and only it is a permutation matrix. So as a doubly stochastic matrix, M(∞) is a permutation matrix if and only if M has exactly one positive diagonal. Thus, CI is maximized if and only if M has exactly one positive diagonal.\nTo complete the proof for (a) ⇐⇒ (b), we only need to justify Claim (1). Note that the product of any positive diagonal converges to a positive number sup{e, f} (shown in the proof for Theorem 4.5) and all elements on the positive diagonal is upper-bounded by 1 and lower-bounded by sup{e, f}. Therefore elements on a diagonal of M cannot converge to 0.\n(2) (b)⇐⇒ (c): This follows immediately from a slightly more general claim below. Claim (2): Let A be an n×n-square matrix. Then A has exactly one non-zero diagonal (i.e. a diagonal with no zero element) if and only if A is a permutation of an upper-triangular matrix. We now prove Claim (2). The if direction is clear since an upper-triangular matrix always has exactly one non-zero diagonal, which is its main diagonal. The only if direction is proved by induction on the dimension n of A.\nStep 1 - Induction basis: When n = 2, it is easy to check that any 2 × 2 matrix with exactly one\ndiagonal is either of the form ( a b 0 c ) or ( a 0 b c ) , where a, c 6= 0. So it is a permutation of an upper-triangular matrix.\nStep 2 - Inductive step: Suppose that the claim - an n× n-square matrix A has exactly one non-zero diagonal if and only if it is a permutation of an upper-triangular matrix - holds for any n < N . We need to show that the claim also holds when n = N .\nThe following notation will be used. Let A be an n× n-square matrix. Ai,j denotes the element of A at row i and column j. Ãi,j denotes the (n − 1) × (n − 1) sub-matrix obtained from A by crossing out row i and column j.\nFirst, we will prove three handy observations. Observation 1 If A has exactly one non-zero diagonal and Ai,j 6= 0, then Ãi,j has at most one non-zero\ndiagonal. In particular, if Ai,j is on that non-zero diagonal, then Ãi,j has exactly one non-zero diagonal.\nProof of Observation 1 : Suppose that Ãi,j has more than one diagonal. Then these diagonals for Ãi,j along with Ai,j form different diagonals for A, contradiction.\nObservation 2 If A has exactly one non-zero diagonal and A has a row or a column with exactly one non-zero element, then A is a permutation of an upper-triangular matrix.\nProof of Observation 2 : Suppose that A has a column with exactly one non-zero element. Then by permutation, we may assume that it is the first column of A and the only non-zero element is A1,1. A1,1 must be on the non-zero diagonal of A. Hence according to observation 1, Ã1,1 is a (N − 1×N − 1)-square matrix has exactly one non-zero diagonal. Then by the inductive assumption, we may permute Ã1,1 into an upper-triangular matrix. Note that each permutation of Ã1,1 induces a permutation of A. So there exist permutations that convert A into A′ such that A′i,j = 0 when j > 1 and i > j. Moreover, permutations that convert A to A′ never switch column 1 (row 1) of A with any other columns (rows). So A′i,1 = 0 for i 6= 1 as A1,1 is the only non-zero element in the first column of A. Thus, we have A ′ i,j = 0 when i > j which implies that A′ is an upper-triangular matrix. If A has a row with exactly one non-zero element. Then up to permutation, we may assume it is the last row of A and the only non-zero element is AN,N . Following similar argument as above, we may show that ÃN,N can be arranged into an upper-triangular matrix by permutations. And corresponding permutations of A will also convert A into an upper triangular matrix. So observation 2 holds.\nObservation 3 If the main diagonal ofA is the only non-zero diagonal ofA, thenAt1,t2At2,t3 · · ·Atk−1,tkAtk,t1 = 0 for any distinct t1, t2, . . . , tk.\nProof of Observation 3 : Suppose that At1,t2At2,t3 · · ·Atk−1,tkAtk,t1 6= 0. Then a different non-zero diagonal for A other than the main diagonal is form by {Ai,i|i 6= t1, . . . , tk} and At1,t2 , At2,t3 , · · · , Atk−1,tk , Atk,t1 .\nNow back to the inductive step. Suppose that A is an N ×N -square matrix with exactly one non-zero diagonal. By permutation, we may assume that the main diagonal of A is the only non-zero diagonal. In particular, A1,1 6= 0. According to Observation 1, Ã1,1 has exactly one non-zero diagonal and so can be arranged into an upper-triangular matrix by permutations. The corresponding permutations convert A into a new form, denoted by A1 with the property that A1i,j = 0 when j > 1 and i > j. In particular, A 1 Nj = 0 when j 6= 1 and j 6= N . Ã11,1 is an upper-triangular matrix implies that A1N,N 6= 0. If A1N,1 = 0, then the last row of A1 contains only one non-zero element A1N,N . So we are done by Observation 2.\nOtherwise, according to Observation 1, Ã1N,N can be arranged into an upper-triangular matrix by permutation. Hence, after the corresponding permutations, we may convert A1 into a new form, denoted by A2 with the property that A2i,j = 0 when i > j and i 6= N . Moreover, permutations that convert A1 to A2 never switch row N (column N) of A1 with any other rows (columns). So only one of {A2N,j |j 6= N} is not zero. If A2N,1 = 0, along with A 2 i,1 = 0 for N > i > 1, we have that first column of A 2 contains exactly one non-zero element A21,1. So by Observation 2, we are done. Otherwise, A2N,1 6= 0. According to Observation 3, A2N,1A21,kA2k,N = 0, for k = 2, . . . , N − 1. So we have that A21,kA 2 k,N = 0, for k = 2, . . . , N − 1. We will proceed by analyzing cases from k = 2 to k = N − 1\nWhen k = 2, if A21,2 = 0, then column 2 of A 2 contains only one non-zero element A22,2 and we are done by Observation 2. Otherwise, we may assume that A21,2 6= 0 and A22,N = 0. When k = 3, if A23,N 6= 0, then A21,3 = 0. According to Observation 3, A2N,1A21,2A22,3A23,N = 0 and this implies that A22,3 = 0. Hence column 3 of A 2 contains only one non-zero element A23,3 and again we are done by Observation 2. Otherwise, we may assume that A23,N = 0 and one of {A21,3, A22,3} is not zero. When k = k, if A24,N 6= 0, then A21,4 = 0. Similarly as in the case where k = 3 (by Observation 3), A2N,1A 2 1,2A 2 2,4A 2 3,N = 0 and this implies that A 2 2,4 = 0. One of {A21,3, A22,3} is not zero =⇒ either A2N,1A 2 1,3A 2 3,4A 2 3,N = 0 or A 2 N,1A 2 1,2A 2 2,3A 2 3,4A 2 3,N = 0 =⇒ A23,4 = 0. Hence column 4 of A2 contains only one non-zero element A24,4 and again we are done by Observation 2. Otherwise, we may assume that A 2 4,N = 0 and at least one of {A21,4, A22,4, A23,4} is not zero. Inductively, either one of column k’s of A2 contains only one non-zero element or A2k,N = 0 for all k = 2, . . . , N − 1. Note the latter case implies that the column N of A2 contains only one non-zero element A2N,N as A 2 N,1 6= 0 =⇒ A21,N = 0. Either way, the proof is then completed by Observation 2."

Although well studied in human learning, there has been less attention to cooperative transmission of data in machine learning, and we consequently lack strong formal frameworks through which we may reason about the benefits and limitations of cooperative inference. We present such a framework. We introduce a novel index for measuring the effectiveness of probabilistic information transmission, and cooperative information transmission specifically. We relate our cooperative index to previous measures of teaching in deterministic settings. We prove conditions under which optimal cooperative inference can be achieved, including a representation theorem which constrains the form of inductive biases for learners optimized for cooperative inference. We conclude by demonstrating how these principles may inform the design of machine learning algorithms and discuss implications for human learning, machine learning, and human-machine learning systems.",
