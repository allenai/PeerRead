      "text" : "We address the issue of regularization in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Recurrent nets have recently been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in many machine learning domains including speech recognition [Miao et al., 2015], computer vision [Yao et al., 2015], language modeling [Kim et al., 2015] and machine translation [Bahdanau et al., 2014]. Solving machine learning tasks requires high capacity models, such as RNNs, that are flexible enough to capture complex relationships in the data. Regularizing neural networks often yields large performance gains when data is a limiting factor, as indicated by the frequent use of early stopping.\nThe use of RNNs is also motivated by their ability to sequentially construct fixed-length representations of arbitrary-length sequences by folding new observations into their hidden state using an input-dependent transition operator. The repeated application of the same transition operator, however, can make the dynamics of an RNN sensitive to minor perturbations in the hidden state.\nMotivated by the desire to improve robustness in the hidden dynamics of RNNs, and inspired by dropout [Hinton et al., 2012, Srivastava et al., 2014], we propose a novel regularizer, called zoneout, which stochastically modifies the transition operator during training. Instead of setting some units’ activations to 0, as in dropout, zoneout replaces some units’ activations with their activations from the previous time-step. As in dropout, we use the expectation of the random noise at test time.\nCompared with dropout, zoneout is appealing because it preserves information flow forwards and backwards through the network. Moreover, RNNs are frequently trained with output parameters which are shared across time-steps1, and this parameter sharing encourages recurrent units’ activations to be semantically consistent\n1This is the case both when training with targets at every time-step, e.g. as in language modelling, or with a single target at the end of a variable-length sequence, e.g. as in sentiment analysis.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 30\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.N E\n] 3\nacross time. Thus zoning out a unit in an RNN preserves not only its activation, but its meaning as well. We empirically evaluate zoneout on classification using the permuted sequential MNIST dataset, and on language modeling using the Penn Treebank dataset, where we demonstrate competitive performance. In particular, we show the benefit of our approach compared with the most successful application of dropout on recurrent connections [Semeniuta et al., 2016] and other proposed regularizers for RNNs."

      "text" : "Concurrent with our work, Singh et al. [2016] propose zoneout for feedforward nets, calling the technique SkipForward. In their experiments on feedforward nets, zoneout is outperformed by stochastic depth, dropout, and their proposed swapout technique, which randomly drops either or both of the identity or residual connections, and gives the best performance on image recognition tasks. Contrarily, we find that zoneout outperforms stochastic depth and recurrent dropout in our experiments with RNNs."

      "heading" : "2.1 Relationship to dropout",
      "text" : "Zoneout is named after the popular dropout [Srivastava et al., 2014] regularization technique. In zoneout, instead of dropping out (being set to 0), units zone out and are set to their previous value (ht = ht−1). Zoneout, like dropout, trains a pseudo-ensemble [Bachman et al., 2014], but uses a stochastic “identity-mask” rather than a zero-mask. We conjecture that identity-masking is more appropriate for RNNs, since it makes it easier for the network to preserve information from previous time-steps going forwards, and it facilitates, rather than hinders, the flow of gradient information going backwards. Zoneout can also be seen as a selective application of dropout to only some of the nodes in a modified computational graph, as shown in Figure 1. This justifies our use of the expected identity-mask at test time."

      "heading" : "2.2 Dropout in RNNs",
      "text" : "Initially successful applications of dropout in RNNs [Pham et al., 2013, Zaremba et al., 2014] only apply dropout to feed-forward connections (“up the stack”), and not recurrent connections (“forward through time”). Bayer et al. [2013] successfully apply fast dropout [Wang and Manning, 2013], a deterministic approximation of dropout, to RNNs. We now describe several recent works [Semeniuta et al., 2016, Moon et al., 2015, Gal, 2015] that propose variants of dropout for use in RNNs.\nSemeniuta et al. [2016] apply recurrent dropout to the updates to LSTM memory cells (or GRU states), i.e. they drop out the input/update gate in LSTM/GRU. Their motivation is to prevent the loss of long-term memories stored in the memory cells of an LSTM (or the states of a GRU). Their proposed method is similar to zoneout applied to these models. Zoneout differs, however, in that zoned-out units’ states are preserved exactly. This difference is most salient when zoning out the hidden states (not the memory cells) of an LSTM, for which there is no analogue in recurrent dropout. Whereas saturated output gates or output nonlinearities would cause recurrent dropout to suffer from the vanishing gradient problem [Bengio et al., 1994], the identity-masked units in zoneout still propagate gradients effectively in this situation. Furthermore,\nwhile the recurrent dropout method is specific to LSTMs and GRUs, zoneout generalizes their intuition to any model that sequentially builds distributed representations of its input.\nAlso motivated by preventing memory loss, Moon et al. [2015] propose rnnDrop. This technique amounts to using the same dropout mask at every time-step, which the authors show results in improved performance on speech recognition in their experiments. Gal [2015] proposed the same technique and evaluated it on natural language processing tasks. His motivation, however, came from a variational inference perspective, i.e. he views dropout masks as applied to parameters rather than hidden units."

      "heading" : "2.3 Relationship to Stochastic Depth",
      "text" : "Zoneout can also be viewed as a per-unit version of stochastic depth [Huang et al., 2016]. Recently introduced as a method to efficiently train very deep feed-forward neural networks, stochastic depth randomly drops entire layers. To our knowledge, this method has not been extended to a recurrent setting. This is equivalent to zoning out all of the units of a layer at the same a time in a feedforward network. In a typical RNN, there is a new input at each time-step, causing issues for a naive implementation of stochastic depth. Firstly, Huang et al. [2016] train deep residual networks (ResNets [He et al., 2015]) and preserve the identity connections when dropping a layer, so that the inputs from the previous layer are fed into the next layer in the stack. Including such residual connections in recurrent nets led to instability in our experiments, presumably due to the parameter sharing in RNNs. Zoning out an entire layer in an RNN also means the input at the corresponding time-step is completely ignored, whereas zoning out individual units allows the RNN to process each element of its input sequence."

      "text" : "Recurrent neural networks process data x1, x2, . . . , xT sequentially, constructing a corresponding sequence of representations, h1, h2, . . . , hT . The transition operator, T , of a recurrent neural network converts the present hidden state and input into a new hidden state: ht = Tt(ht−1, xt). Thus each hidden state is trained (implicitly) to remember and emphasize all task-relevant aspects of the preceding inputs, and to incorporate new inputs into its representation of state.\nAnother way to see zoneout is as a modification of the transition operator, similar to dropout. For both methods, the masking coefficient, dt, is a Bernoulli random vector sampled independently at each time-step during training, and is replaced by its expectation at test time. Then, zoneout mixes the original transition operator T̃t with the identity operator, as opposed to the null operator used in dropout:\nZoneout: Tt = dt T̃t + (1− dt) 1 Dropout: Tt = dt T̃t + (1− dt) 0\nIn simple RNNs, the hidden state is computed by a standard “linear layer”, i.e., an affine transform followed by a nonlinearity φ:\nht = φ(Whht−1 +Wxxt + b),\nA naive application of dropout here is to simply apply a stochastic zero-mask to the updated ht; zoneout is similarly straightforward."

      "heading" : "3.2 Long short-term memory",
      "text" : "In long short-term memory RNNs (LSTMs), the hidden state is divided into memory cells ct which are intended for internal long-term storage, and hidden state, ht which is used as a transient representation of state at time-step t. In an LSTM, ct and ht are computed via a set of four “gates”, including the forget gate, ft, which directly connects ct to the memories of the previous time-step ct−1, via an element-wise multiplication. Large values of the (ironically named) forget gate cause the cell to remember most (but not all) of its previous value. The other gates control the flow of information in (it, gt) and out (ot) of the cell. Each gate has its own weight matrices and bias vector; for example the forget gate has Wxf , Whf , and bf . For brevity, we will write these as Wx,Wh, b.\nAn LSTM is defined as follows:\nit, ft, ot = σ(Wxxt +Whht−1 + b)\ngt = tanh(Wxgxt +Whght−1 + bg)\nct = ft ct−1 + it gt ht = ot tanh(ct)\nA naive application of dropout in LSTMs zero-masks either or both of the memory cells and hidden states. For example, here is an LSTM with dropout applied to the memory cells:\nit, ft, ot = σ(Wxxt +Whht−1 + b)\ngt = tanh(Wxgxt +Whght−1 + bg)\nct = dt (ft ct−1 + it gt) ht = ot tanh(ct)\nAlternatives abound, however; masks can be applied to any subset of the gates, cells, and states. Recently, Semeniuta et al. [2016] proposed zero-masking the input gate (which they call recurrent dropout):\nit, ft, ot = σ(Wxxt +Whht−1 + b)\ngt = tanh(Wxgxt +Whght−1 + bg)\nct = (ft ct−1 + dt it gt) ht = ot tanh(ct)\nWhen the input gate is masked like this, there is no additive contribution from the input or hidden state, and the value of the memory cell simply decays according to the forget gate.\n3.3 Zoneout in LSTMs\nIn zoneout, the values of the hidden state and memory cell may stick to their previous value (stochastically), or be updated as usual. This introduces stochastic identity connections between subsequent time steps:\nct = dt ct−1 + (1− dt) ( ft ct−1 + it gt ) ht = dt ht−1 + (1− dt) ( ot tanh ( ft ct−1 + it gt\n)) We also experiment with a variant of recurrent dropout that reuses the input dropout mask to zoneout\nthe corresponding output gates:\nit, ft, ot = σ(Wxxt +Whht−1 + b)\ngt = tanh(Wxgxt +Whght−1 + bg)\nct = (ft ct−1 + dt it gt) ht = ((1− dt) ot + dt ot−1) tanh(ct)\nThe motivation for this variant is to prevent the network from being forced (by the output gate) to expose a memory cell which has not been updated, and hence may contain misleading information."

The learning rate is set to 0.001 and the gradients are clipped to a maximum norm of 1.0 [Pascanu et al., 2013]. The recurrent dropout probability and zoneout probabilites are both set to 0.15.

      "text" : "We have introduced zoneout, a novel way to regularize RNNs. Instead of dropping out hidden units, we zoneout hidden units, stochastically replacing their activations with the activations from one timestep earlier. We find zoneout brings significant performance improvements on the permuted sequential MNIST and Penn Treebank datasets, outperforming alternative regularizers, and achieving state of the art performance on character-level language modelling.\nWe conjecture that the improved generalization of zoneout arises from two main factors:\n• The stochasticity introduced by zoneout makes the network more robust to changes in the hidden state.\n• The identity connections of zoneout improve the flow of information through the network.\nFuture work could allow recurrent networks to adaptively set the probabilities of updating various units based on the input sequence. This could be used to learn a dynamic version of the hierarchical RNN proposed by Hihi and Bengio [1996], where the network would learn when to update different dimensions of its hidden state, which could be used to store information about different time-scales."

But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units, gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks. We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find encouraging results: zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks, yielding state-ofthe-art results in character-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset and competitive results on word-level Penn Treebank and permuted sequential MNIST classification tasks.",
