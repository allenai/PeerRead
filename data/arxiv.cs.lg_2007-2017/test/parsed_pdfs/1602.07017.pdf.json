INTRODUCTION\nW ITH advancements in mathematics, linear represen-tation methods (LRBM) have been well studied and have recently received considerable attention [1, 2].

Sparse representation has shown huge potential capabilities in handling these problems.\nSparse representation, from the viewpoint of its origin, is directly related to compressed sensing (CS) [11–13], which is one of the most popular topics in recent years. Donoho [11] first proposed the original concept of compressed sensing. CS theory suggests that if a signal is sparse or compressive, the original signal can be reconstructed by exploiting a few measured values, which are much less than the ones suggested by previously used theories such as Shannon’s sampling theorem (SST). Candes et al. [13], from the mathematical perspective, demonstrated the rationale of CS theory, i.e. the original signal could be precisely reconstructed by utilizing a small portion of Fourier transformation coefficients. Baraniuk [12] provided a concrete analysis of compressed sensing and presented a specific interpretation on some solutions of different signal reconstruction algorithms. All these literature [11–17] laid the foundation of CS theory and provided the theoretical basis for future research. Thus, a large number of algorithms based on CS theory have been proposed to address different problems in various fields. Moreover, CS theory always includes the three basic components: sparse representation, encoding measuring, and reconstructing algorithm. As an indispensable prerequisite of CS theory, the sparse representation theory [4, 7–10, 17] is the most outstanding technique used to conquer difficulties that appear in many fields. For example, the methodology of sparse representation is a novel signal sampling method for the sparse or compressible signal and has been successfully applied to signal processing [4–6].\nSparse representation has attracted much attention in recent years and many examples in different fields can be found where sparse representation is definitely beneficial and favorable [18, 19]. One example is image classification, where the basic goal is to classify the given test image into several predefined categories. It has been demonstrated that natural images can be sparsely represented from the perspective of the properties of visual neurons. The sparse representation based classification (SRC) method [20] first assumes that the test sample can be sufficiently represented by samples from the same subject. Specifically, SRC exploits the linear combination of training samples to represent the test sample and computes sparse representation coefficients of the linear representation system, and then calculates the reconstruction residuals of each class employing the sparse representation\ncoefficients and training samples. The test sample will be classified as a member of the class, which leads to the minimum reconstruction residual. The literature [20] has also demonstrated that the SRC method has great superiorities when addressing the image classification issue on corrupted or disguised images. In such cases, each natural image can be sparsely represented and the sparse representation theory can be utilized to fulfill the image classification task.\nFor signal processing, one important task is to extract key components from a large number of clutter signals or groups of complex signals in coordination with different requirements. Before the appearance of sparse representation, SST and Nyquist sampling law (NSL) were the traditional methods for signal acquisition and the general procedures included sampling, coding compression, transmission, and decoding. Under the frameworks of SST and NSL, the greatest difficulty of signal processing lies in efficient sampling from mass data with sufficient memory-saving. In such a case, sparse representation theory can simultaneously break the bottleneck of conventional sampling rules, i.e. SST and NSL, so that it has a very wide application prospect. Sparse representation theory proposes to integrate the processes of signal sampling and coding compression. Especially, sparse representation theory employs a more efficient sampling rate to measure the original sample by abandoning the pristine measurements of SST and NSL, and then adopts an optimal reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct samples. In the context of compressed sensing, it is first assumed that all the signals are sparse or approximately sparse enough [4, 6, 7]. Compared to the primary signal space, the size of the set of possible signals can be largely decreased under the constraint of sparsity. Thus, massive algorithms based on the sparse representation theory have been proposed to effectively tackle signal processing issues such as signal reconstruction and recovery. To this end, the sparse representation technique can save a significant amount of sampling time and sample storage space and it is favorable and advantageous."

      "heading" : "A. Categorization of sparse representation techniques",
      "text" : "Sparse representation theory can be categorized from different viewpoints. Because different methods have their individual motivations, ideas, and concerns, there are varieties of strategies to separate the existing sparse representation methods into different categories from the perspective of taxonomy. For example, from the viewpoint of “atoms”, available sparse representation methods can be categorized into two general groups: naive sample based sparse representation and dictionary learning based sparse representation. However, on the basis of the availability of labels of “atoms”, sparse representation and learning methods can be coarsely divided into three groups: supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and unsupervised learning methods. Because of the sparse constraint, sparse representation methods can be divided into two communities: structure constraint based sparse representation and sparse constraint based sparse representation. Moreover, in the field of image classification, the representation based classification methods consist of two main categories in terms\nof the way of exploiting the “atoms”: the holistic representation based method and local representation based method [21]. More specifically, holistic representation based methods exploit training samples of all classes to represent the test sample, whereas local representation based methods only employ training samples (or atoms) of each class or several classes to represent the test sample. Most of the sparse representation methods are holistic representation based methods. A typical and representative local sparse representation methods is the two-phase test sample sparse representation (TPTSR) method [9]. In consideration of different methodologies, the sparse representation method can be grouped into two aspects: pure sparse representation and hybrid sparse representation, which improves the pre-existing sparse representation methods with the aid of other methods. The literature [22] suggests that sparse representation algorithms roughly fall into three classes: convex relaxation, greedy algorithms, and combinational methods. In the literature [23, 24], from the perspective of sparse problem modeling and problem solving, sparse decomposition algorithms are generally divided into two sections: greedy algorithms and convex relaxation algorithms. On the other hand, if the viewpoint of optimization is taken into consideration, the problems of sparse representation can be divided into four optimization problems: the smooth convex problem, nonsmooth nonconvex problem, smooth nonconvex problem, and nonsmooth convex problem. Furthermore, Schmidt et al. [25] reviewed some optimization techniques for solving l1norm regularization problems and roughly divided these approaches into three optimization strategies: sub-gradient methods, unconstrained approximation methods, and constrained optimization methods. The supplementary file attached with the paper also offers more useful information to make fully understandings of the ‘taxonomy’ of current sparse representation techniques in this paper.\nIn this paper, the available sparse representation methods are categorized into four groups, i.e. the greedy strategy approximation, constrained optimization strategy, proximity algorithm based optimization strategy, and homotopy algorithm based sparse representation, with respect to the analytical solution and optimization viewpoints.\n(1) In the greedy strategy approximation for solving sparse representation problem, the target task is mainly to solve the sparse representation method with l0-norm minimization. Because of the fact that this problem is an NP-hard problem [26], the greedy strategy provides an approximate solution to alleviate this difficulty. The greedy strategy searches for the best local optimal solution in each iteration with the goal of achieving the optimal holistic solution [27]. For the sparse representation method, the greedy strategy approximation only chooses the most k appropriate samples, which are called ksparsity, to approximate the measurement vector.\n(2) In the constrained optimization strategy, the core idea is to explore a suitable way to transform a non-differentiable optimization problem into a differentiable optimization problem by replacing the l1-norm minimization term, which is convex but nonsmooth, with a differentiable optimization term, which is convex and smooth. More specifically, the constrained optimization strategy substitutes the l1-norm minimization term\nwith an equal constraint condition on the original unconstraint problem. If the original unconstraint problem is reformulated into a differentiable problem with constraint conditions, it will become an uncomplicated problem in the consideration of the fact that l1-norm minimization is global non-differentiable.\n(3) Proximal algorithms can be treated as a powerful tool for solving nonsmooth, constrained, large-scale, or distributed versions of the optimization problem [28]. In the proximity algorithm based optimization strategy for sparse representation, the main task is to reformulate the original problem into the specific model of the corresponding proximal operator such as the soft thresholding operator, hard thresholding operator, and resolvent operator, and then exploits the proximity algorithms to address the original sparse optimization problem.\n(4) The general framework of the homotopy algorithm is to iteratively trace the final desired solution starting from the initial point to the optimal point by successively adjusting the homotopy parameter [29]. In homotopy algorithm based sparse representation, the homotopy algorithm is used to solve the l1norm minimization problem with k-sparse property."

If any sample can be approximately represented by a linear combination of dictionary D and the number of the samples is larger than the dimension of samples in D, i.e. n > d, dictionary D is referred to as an over-complete dictionary. A signal is said to be compressible if it is a sparse signal in the original or transformed domain when there is no information or energy loss during the process of transformation.\n“sparse” or “sparsity” of a vector means that some elements of the vector are zero. We use a linear combination of a basis matrix A ∈ RN×N to represent a signal x ∈ RN×1, i.e. x = As where s ∈ RN×1 is the column vector of weighting coefficients. If only k (k ≪ N ) elements of s are nonzero and the rest elements in s are zero, we call the signal x is k-sparse."

It means the sum of absolute values of the elements in vector v , and its geometric interpretation is shown in Fig. 2b, which is a square with a forty-five degree rotation.\nWhen p=2, it is called the l2-norm or Euclidean norm. It is defined as ‖v‖2 = (v21 + v22 + · · ·+v2n)1/2, and its geometric interpretation in 2-D space is shown in Fig. 2c which is a circle.\nIn the literature, the sparsity of a vector v is always related to the so-called l0-norm, which means the number of the nonzero elements of vector v. Actually, the l0-norm is the limit as p → 0 of the lp-norms [8] and the definition of the l0-norm is formulated as\n‖v‖0 = lim p→0 ‖v‖pp = lim p→0\nn∑\ni=1\n|vi|p (II.4)\nWe can see that the notion of the l0-norm is very convenient and intuitive for defining the sparse representation problem. The property of the l0-norm can also be presented from the perspective of geometric interpretation in 2-D space, which is shown in Fig. 2a, and it is a crisscross.\nFurthermore, the geometric meaning of the lp-norm (0<p<1) is also presented, which is a form of similar recessed pentacle shown in Fig. 2d.\nOn the other hand, it is assumed that f(x) is the function of the lp-norm (p>0) on the parameter vector x, and then the following function is obtained:\nf(x) = ‖x‖pp = ( n∑\ni=1\n|xi|p) (II.5)\nThe relationships between different norms are summarized in Fig. 3. From the illustration in Fig. 3, the conclusions are as follows. The l0-norm function is a nonconvex, nonsmooth, discontinuity, global nondifferentiable function. The lp-norm (0<p<1) is a nonconvex, nonsmooth, global nondifferentiable function. The l1-norm function is a convex, nonsmooth, global nondifferentiable function. The l2-norm function is a convex, smooth, global differentiable function.\nIn order to more specifically elucidate the meaning and solutions of different norm minimizations, the geometry in 2-D space is used to explicitly illustrate the solutions of the l0-norm minimization in Fig. 4a, l1-norm minimization in Fig. 4b, and l2-norm minimization in Fig. 4c. Let S = {x∗ : Ax = y} denote the line in 2-D space and a hyperplane will be formulated in higher dimensions. All possible solution x∗ must lie on the line of S. In order to visualize how to obtain the solution of different norm-based minimization problems, we take the l1-norm minimization problem as an example to explicitly interpret. Suppose that we inflate the l1ball from an original status until it hits the hyperplane S at some point. Thus, the solution of the l1-norm minimization problem is the aforementioned touched point. If the sparse solution of the linear system is localized on the coordinate axis, it will be sparse enough. From the perspective of Fig. 4, it can be seen that the solutions of both the l0-norm and l1-norm minimization are sparse, whereas for the l2norm minimization, it is very difficult to rigidly satisfy the\ncondition of sparsity. However, it has been demonstrated that the representation solution of the l2-norm minimization is not strictly sparse enough but “limitedly-sparse”, which means it possesses the capability of discriminability [30].\nThe Frobenius norm, L1-norm of matrix X ∈ Rm×n, and l2-norm or spectral norm are respectively defined as\n‖X‖F = ( n∑\ni=1\nm∑\nj=1\nX2j,i) 1/2, ‖X‖L1 = maxj=1,...,n\nm∑\ni=1\n|xij |,\n‖X‖2 = δmax(X) = (λmax(XTX))1/2 (II.6)\nwhere δ is the singular value operator and the l2-norm of X is its maximum singular value [31].\nThe l2,1-norm or R1-norm is defined on matrix term, that is\n‖X‖2,1 = n∑\ni=1\n(\nm∑\nj=1\nX2j,i) 1/2 (II.7)\nAs shown above, a norm can be viewed as a measure of the length of a vector v. The distance between two vectors x and y, or matrices X and Y , can be measured by the length of their differences, i.e.\ndist(x,y) = ‖x− y‖22, dist(X,Y ) = ‖X − Y ‖F (II.8) which are denoted as the distance between x and y in the context of the l2-norm and the distance between X and Y in the context of the Frobenius norm, respectively.\nAssume that X ∈ Rm×n and the rank of X , i.e. rank(X) = r. The SVD of X is computed as\nX = UΛV T (II.9)\nwhere U ∈ Rm×r with UTU = I and V ∈ Rn×r with V TV = I . The columns of U and V are called left and right singular vectors of X , respectively. Additionally, Λ is a diagonal matrix and its elements are composed of the singular values of X , i.e. Λ = diag(λ1, λ2, · · · , λr) with λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λr > 0. Furthermore, the singular value decomposition can be rewritten as\nX =\nr∑\ni=1\nλiuivi (II.10)\nwhere λi, ui and vi are the i-th singular value, the i-th column of U , and the i-th column of V , respectively [31]."

      "heading" : "III. SPARSE REPRESENTATION PROBLEM WITH DIFFERENT NORM REGULARIZATIONS",
      "text" : "In this section, sparse representation is summarized and grouped into different categories in terms of the norm regularizations used. The general framework of sparse representation is to exploit the linear combination of some samples or “atoms” to represent the probe sample, to calculate the representation solution, i.e. the representation coefficients of these samples or “atoms”, and then to utilize the representation solution to reconstruct the desired results. The representation results in sparse representation, however, can be greatly dominated by the regularizer (or optimizer) imposed on the representation solution [32–35]. Thus, in terms of the different norms used in optimizers, the sparse representation methods can be roughly grouped into five general categories: sparse representation with the l0-norm minimization [36, 37], sparse representation with the lp-norm (0<p<1) minimization [38– 40], sparse representation with the l1-norm minimization [41– 44], sparse representation with the l2,1-norm minimization [45–49], sparse representation with the l2-norm minimization [9, 50, 51].\nA. Sparse representation with l0-norm minimization Let x1,x2, · · · ,xn ∈ Rd be all the n known samples and matrix X ∈ Rd×n (d<n), which is constructed by known samples, is the measurement matrix or the basis dictionary and should also be an over-completed dictionary. Each column of X is one sample and the probe sample is y ∈ Rd , which is a column vector. Thus, if all the known samples are used to approximately represent the probe sample, it should be expressed as:\ny = x1α1 + x2α2 + · · ·+ xnαn (III.1)\nwhere αi (i=1,2,· · · ,n) is the coefficient of xi and Eq. III.1 can be rewritten into the following equation for convenient description:\ny = Xα (III.2)\nwhere matrix X=[x1,x2, · · · ,xn] and α=[α1,α2, · · · ,αn]T . However, problem III.2 is an underdetermined linear system of equations and the main problem is how to solve it. From the viewpoint of linear algebra, if there is not any prior knowledge or any constraint imposed on the representation solution α, problem III.2 is an ill-posed problem and will never have a unique solution. That is, it is impossible to utilize equation III.2 to uniquely represent the probe sample y using the measurement matrix X . To alleviate this difficulty, it is feasible to impose an appropriate regularizer constraint or regularizer function on representation solution α. The sparse representation method demands that the obtained representation solution should be sparse. Hereafter, the meaning of ‘sparse’ or ‘sparsity’ refers to the condition that when the linear combination of measurement matrix is exploited to represent the probe sample, many of the coefficients should\nbe zero or very close to zero and few of the entries in the representation solution are differentially large.\nThe sparsest representation solution can be acquired by solving the linear representation system III.2 with the l0norm minimization constraint [52]. Thus problem III.2 can be converted to the following optimization problem:\nα̂ = argmin ‖α‖0 s.t. y = Xα (III.3)\nwhere ‖ · ‖0 refers to the number of nonzero elements in the vector and is also viewed as the measure of sparsity. Moreover, if just k (k < n) atoms from the measurement matrix X are utilized to represent the probe sample, problem III.3 will be equivalent to the following optimization problem:\ny = Xα s.t. ‖α‖0 ≤ k (III.4)\nProblem III.4 is called the k-sparse approximation problem. Because real data always contains noise, representation noise is unavoidable in most cases. Thus the original model III.2 can be revised to a modified model with respect to small possible noise by denoting\ny = Xα+ s (III.5)\nwhere s ∈ Rd refers to representation noise and is bounded as ‖s‖2 ≤ ε. With the presence of noise, the sparse solutions of problems III.3 and III.4 can be approximately obtained by resolving the following optimization problems:\nα̂ = argmin ‖α‖0 s.t. ‖y −Xα‖22 ≤ ε (III.6)\nor\nα̂ = argmin ‖y −Xα‖22 s.t. ‖α‖0 ≤ ε (III.7)\nFurthermore, according to the Lagrange multiplier theorem, a proper constant λ exists such that problems III.6 and III.7 are equivalent to the following unconstrained minimization problem with a proper value of λ.\nα̂ = L(α, λ) = argmin ‖y −Xα‖22 + λ‖α‖0 (III.8)\nwhere λ refers to the Lagrange multiplier associated with ‖α‖0.\nB. Sparse representation with l1-norm minimization\nThe l1-norm originates from the Lasso problem [41, 42] and it has been extensively used to address issues in machine learning, pattern recognition, and statistics [53–55]. Although the sparse representation method with l0-norm minimization can obtain the fundamental sparse solution of α over the matrix X , the problem is still a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem and the solution is difficult to approximate [26]. Recent literature [20, 56–58] has demonstrated that when the representation solution obtained by using the l1-norm minimization constraint is also content with the condition of sparsity and the solution using l1-norm minimization with sufficient sparsity can be equivalent to the solution obtained by l0-norm minimization with full probability. Moreover, the l1-norm optimization problem has an analytical solution and can be solved in polynomial time. Thus, extensive sparse representation methods with the l1-norm minimization have\nbeen proposed to enrich the sparse representation theory. The applications of sparse representation with the l1-norm minimization are extraordinarily and remarkably widespread. Correspondingly, the main popular structures of sparse representation with the l1-norm minimization , similar to sparse representation with l0-norm minimization, are generally used to solve the following problems:\nα̂ = argmin α\n‖α‖1 s.t. y = Xα (III.9)\nα̂ = argmin α\n‖α‖1 s.t. ‖y −Xα‖22 ≤ ε (III.10)\nor\nα̂ = argmin α\n‖y −Xα‖22 s.t. ‖α‖1 ≤ τ (III.11)\nα̂ = L(α, λ) = argmin α\n1 2 ‖y −Xα‖22 + λ‖α‖1 (III.12)\nwhere λ and τ are both small positive constants.\nC. Sparse representation with lp-norm (0<p<1) minimization\nThe general sparse representation method is to solve a linear representation system with the lp-norm minimization problem. In addition to the l0-norm minimization and l1-norm minimization, some researchers are trying to solve the sparse representation problem with the lp-norm (0<p<1) minimization, especially p = 0.1, 12 , 1 3 , or 0.9 [59–61]. That is, the sparse representation problem with the lp-norm (0<p<1) minimization is to solve the following problem:\nα̂ = argmin α\n‖α‖pp s.t. ‖y −Xα‖22 ≤ ε (III.13)\nor\nα̂ = L(α, λ) = argmin α\n‖y −Xα‖22 + λ‖α‖pp (III.14)\nIn spite of the fact that sparse representation methods with the lp-norm (0<p<1) minimization are not the mainstream methods to obtain the sparse representation solution, it tremendously influences the improvements of the sparse representation theory.\nD. Sparse representation with l2,1-norm minimization\nThe representation solution obtained by the l2-norm minimization is not rigorously sparse. It can only obtain a ‘limitedlysparse’ representation solution, i.e. the solution has the property that it is discriminative and distinguishable but is not really sparse enough [30]. The objective function of the sparse representation method with the l2-norm minimization is to solve the following problem:\nα̂ = argmin α\n‖α‖22 s.t. ‖y −Xα‖22 ≤ ε (III.15)\nor\nα̂ = L(α, λ) = argmin α\n‖y −Xα‖22 + λ‖α‖22 (III.16)\nOn the other hand, the l2,1-norm is also called the rotation invariant l1-norm, which is proposed to overcome the difficulty of robustness to outliers [62]. The objective function of the sparse representation problem with the l2,1-norm minimization is to solve the following problem:\nargmin A\n‖Y −XA‖2,1 + µ‖A‖2,1 (III.17)\nwhere Y = [y1,y2, · · · ,yN ] refers to the matrix composed of samples, A = [a1,a2, · · · ,aN ] is the corresponding coefficient matrix of X , and µ is a small positive constant. Sparse representation with the l2,1-norm minimization can be implemented by exploiting the proposed algorithms in literature [45–47]."

The core idea of the greedy strategy [7, 23] is to determine the position based on the relationship between the atom and probe sample, and then to use the least square to evaluate the amplitude value. Greedy algorithms can obtain the local optimized solution in each step in order to address the problem. However, the greedy algorithm can always produce the global optimal solution or an approximate overall solution [7, 23]. Addressing sparse representation with l0-norm regularization, i.e. problem III.3, is an NP hard problem [20, 56]. The greedy strategy provides a special way to obtain an approximate sparse representation solution.

      "heading" : "A. Matching pursuit algorithm",
      "text" : "The matching pursuit (MP) algorithm [63] is the earliest and representative method of using the greedy strategy to approximate problem III.3 or III.4. The main idea of the MP is to iteratively choose the best atom from the dictionary based on a certain similarity measurement to approximately obtain the sparse solution. Taking as an example of the sparse decomposition with a vector sample y over the over-complete dictionary D, the detailed algorithm description is presented as follows:\nSuppose that the initialized representation residual is R0 = y, D = [d1,d2, · · · ,dN ] ∈ Rd×N and each sample in dictionary D is an l2-norm unity vector, i.e. ‖di‖ = 1. To approximate y, MP first chooses the best matching atom from D and the selected atom should satisfy the following condition:\n|〈R0,dl0〉| = sup|〈R0,di〉| (IV.1) where l0 is a label index from dictionary D. Thus y can be decomposed into the following equation:\ny = 〈y,dl0〉dl0 +R1 (IV.2) So y = 〈R0,dl0〉dl0 +R1 where 〈R0,dl0〉dl0 represents the orthogonal projection of y onto dl0 , and R1 is the representation residual by using dl0 to represent y. Considering the fact that dl0 is orthogonal to R1, Eq. IV.2 can be rewritten as\n‖y‖2 = |〈y,dl0〉|2 + ‖R1‖2 (IV.3)\nTo obtain the minimum representation residual, the MP algorithm iteratively figures out the best matching atom from the over-completed dictionary, and then utilizes the representation residual as the next approximation target until the termination condition of iteration is satisfied.

Thus, the probe sample can be represented by a small number of elements from a large dictionary. In the context of the specific representation error, the termination condition of sparse representation is that the representation residual is smaller than the presupposed value.

      "text" : "It is an excellent choice to employ the greedy strategy to approximate the solution of sparse representation with the l0-norm minimization. These algorithms are typical greedy iterative algorithms. The earliest algorithms were the matching pursuit (MP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). The basic idea of the MP algorithm is to select the best matching atom from the overcomplete dictionary to construct sparse approximation during each iteration, to compute the signal representation residual, and then to choose the best matching atom till the stopping criterion of iteration is satisfied. Many more greedy algorithms based on the MP and OMP algorithm such as the efficient orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm [65] subsequently have been proposed to improve the pursuit algorithm. Needell et al. proposed an regularized version of orthogonal matching pursuit (ROMP) algorithm [37], which recovered all k sparse signals based on the Restricted Isometry Property of random frequency measurements, and then proposed another variant of OMP algorithm called compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm [66], which incorporated several existing ideas such as restricted isometry property (RIP) and pruning technique into a greedy iterative structure of OMP. Some other algorithms also had an impressive influence on future research on CS. For example, Donoho et al. proposed an extension of OMP, called stage-wise orthogonal matching pursuit (StOMP) algorithm [67], which depicted an iterative algorithm with three main steps, i.e. threholding, selecting and projecting. Dai and Milenkovic proposed a new method for sparse signal reconstruction named subspace pursuit (SP) algorithm [68], which sampled signals satisfying the constraints of the RIP with a constant parameter. Do et al. presented a sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) algorithm [69], which borrowed the idea of the EM algorithm to alternatively estimate the sparsity and support set. Jost et al. proposed a tree-based matching pursuit (TMP) algorithm [70], which constructed a tree structure and employed a structuring strategy to cluster similar signal atoms from a highly redundant dictionary as a new dictionary. Subsequently, La and Do proposed a new tree-based orthogonal matching pursuit (TBOMP) algorithm [71], which treated the sparse tree representation as an additional prior knowledge for linear inverse systems by using a small number of samples. Recently, Karahanoglu and Erdogan conceived a forward-backward pursuit (FBP) method [72] with two greedy stages, in which the forward stage enlarged the support estimation and the backward stage removed some unsatisfied atoms. More detailed treatments of the greedy pursuit for sparse representation can be found in the literature [23]."

      "text" : "The core idea of the gradient projection sparse representation method is to find the sparse representation solution along with the gradient descent direction. The first key procedure of gradient projection sparse reconstruction (GPSR) [73] provides a constrained formulation where each value of α can be split into its positive and negative parts. Vectors α+ and α− are introduced to denote the positive and negative coefficients of α, respectively. The sparse representation solution α can be formulated as:\nα = α+ −α−, α+ ≥ 0, α− ≥ 0 (V.1) where the operator (·)+ denotes the positive-part operator, which is defined as (x)+=max{0, x}. Thus, ‖α‖1 = 1Tdα++ 1 T dα−, where 1d = [1, 1, · · · , 1\n︸ ︷︷ ︸\nd\n]T is a d–dimensional vector\nwith d ones.

The value of z can be iteratively obtained by utilizing\nargmin zt+1 = zt − σ∇G(zt) (V.5)\nwhere the gradient of ∇G(zt) = c + Azt and σ is the step size of the iteration.

Interior-point method based sparse representation strategy\nThe Interior-point method [31] is not an iterative algorithm but a smooth mathematic model and it always incorporates the Newton method to efficiently solve unconstrained smooth problems of modest size [28]. When the Newton method is used to address the optimization issue, a complex Newton equation should be solved iteratively which is very timeconsuming. A method named the truncated Newton method can effectively and efficiently obtain the solution of the Newton equation. A prominent algorithm called the truncated Newton based interior-point method (TNIPM) exists, which can be utilized to solve the large-scale l1-regularized least squares (i.e. l1 ls) problem [74].\nThe original problem of l1 ls is to solve problem III.12 and the core procedures of l1 ls are shown below: (1) Transform the original unconstrained non-smooth problem to a constrained smooth optimization problem. (2) Apply the interior-point method to reformulate the constrained smooth optimization problem as a new unconstrained smooth optimization problem. (3) Employ the truncated Newton method to solve this unconstrained smooth problem.\nThe main idea of the l1 ls will be briefly described. For simplicity of presentation, the following one-dimensional problem is used as an example.\n|α| = arg min −σ≤α≤σ σ (V.10)\nwhere σ is a proper positive constant.\nThus, problem III.12 can be rewritten as\nα̂ = argmin 12‖y −Xα‖22 + λ‖α‖1 = argmin 12‖y −Xα‖22 + λ ∑N i=1 min−σi≤αi≤σi σi\n= argmin 12‖y −Xα‖22 + λmin−σi≤αi≤σi ∑N i=1 σi = argmin−σi≤αi≤σi 1 2‖y −Xα‖22 + λ ∑N i=1 σi\n(V.11) Thus problem III.12 is also equivalent to solve the following\nproblem:\nα̂ = arg min α,σ∈RN\n1 2 ‖y−Xα‖22+λ\nN∑\ni=1 σi s.t. −σi ≤ αi ≤ σi (V.12)\nor\nα̂ = arg min α,σ∈RN\n1 2 ‖y −Xα‖22 + λ\nN∑\ni=1\nσi\ns.t. σi + αi ≥ 0, σi −αi ≥ 0 (V.13)\nThe interior-point strategy can be used to transform problem V.13 into an unconstrained smooth problem\nα̂ = arg min α,σ∈RN\nG(α,σ) = v\n2 ‖y−Xα‖22+λv\nN∑\ni=1\nσi−B(α,σ)\n(V.14) where B(α,σ) =\n∑N i=1 log(σi+αi)+ ∑N i=1 log(σi−αi) is\na barrier function, which forces the algorithm to be performed within the feasible region in the context of unconstrained condition.\nSubsequently, l1 ls utilizes the truncated Newton method to solve problem V.14. The main procedures of addressing problem V.14 are presented as follows: First, the Newton system is constructed\nH [ △α △σ ] = −∇G(α,σ) ∈ R2N (V.15)\nwhere H = −∇2G(α,σ) ∈ R2N×2N is the Hessian matrix, which is computed using the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm, and then the direction of linear search [△α,△σ] is obtained. Second, the Lagrange dual of problem III.12 is used to construct the dual feasible point and duality gap: a) The Lagrangian function and Lagrange dual of problem III.12 are constructed. The Lagrangian function is reformulated as\nL(α, z,u) = zT z + λ‖α‖1 + u(Xα− y − z) (V.16)\nwhere its corresponding Lagrange dual function is\nα̂ = argmaxF (u) = −1 4 uTu− uTy s.t.\n|(XTu)i| ≤ λi (i = 1, 2, · · · , N) (V.17)\nb) A dual feasible point is constructed\nu = 2s(y−Xα), s = min{λ/|2yi−2(XTXα)i|}∀i (V.18)\nwhere u is a dual feasible point and s is the step size of the linear search.\nc) The duality gap is constructed, which is the gap between the primary problem and the dual problem:\ng = ‖y −Xα‖+ λ‖α‖1 − F (u) (V.19)\nThird, the method of backtracking linear search is used to determine an optimal step size of the Newton linear search. The stopping condition of the backtracking linear search is\nG(α+ηt△α,σ+ηt△σ) > G(α,σ)+ρηt∇G(α,σ)[△α,△σ] (V.20) where ρ ∈ (0, 0.5) and ηt ∈ (0, 1) is the step size of the Newton linear search. Finally, the termination condition of the Newton linear search is set to\nζ = min{0.1, βg/‖h‖2} (V.21)\nwhere the function h = ∇G(α,σ), β is a small constant, and g is the duality gap. The main steps of algorithm l1 ls are summarized in Algorithm 3. For further description and analyses, please refer to the literature [74].\nAlgorithm 3. Truncated Newton based interior-point method (TNIPM) for l1 ls Task: To address the unconstraint problem:\nα̂ = argminα 1 2 ‖y −Xα‖22 + λ‖α‖1\nInput: Probe sample y, the measurement matrix X , small constant λ Initialization: t = 1, v = 1\nλ , ρ ∈ (0, 0.5), σ = 1N\nStep 1: Employ preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to obtain the approximation of H in Eq. V.15, and then obtain the descent direction of linear search [△αt,△σt].\nStep 2: Exploit the algorithm of backtracking linear search to find the optimal step size of Newton linear search ηt , which satisfies the Eq. V.20.\nStep 3: Update the iteration point utilizing (αt+1,σt+1) = (αt,σt)+ (△αt +△σt).\nStep 4: Construct feasible point using eq. V.18 and duality gap in Eq. V.19, and compute the termination tolerance ζ in Eq. V.21.\nStep 5: If the condition g/F (u) > ζ is satisfied, stop; Otherwise, return to step 1, update v in Eq. V.14 and t = t+ 1. Output: α\nThe truncated Newton based interior-point method (TNIPM) [75] is a very effective method to solve the l1-norm regularization problems. Koh et al. [76] also utilized the TNIPM to solve large scale logistic regression problems, which employed a preconditioned conjugate gradient method to compute the search step size with warm-start techniques. Mehrotra proposed to exploit the interior-point method to address the primal-dual problem [77] and introduced the second-order derivation of Taylor polynomial to approximate a primal-dual trajectory. More analyses of interior-point method for sparse representation can be found in the literature [78]."

      "text" : "Sparse reconstruction by separable approximation (SpaRSA) [84] is another typical proximity algorithm based on sparse representation, which can be viewed as an accelerated version of ISTA. SpaRSA provides a general algorithmic framework for solving the sparse representation problem and here a simple specific SpaRSA with adaptive continuation on ISTA is introduced. The main contributions of SpaRSA are trying to optimize the parameter λ in problem VI.8 by using the worm-starting technique, i.e. continuation, and choosing a\nmore reliable approximation of Hf (α) in problem VI.9 using the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) spectral method [85]. The wormstarting technique and BB spectral approach are introduced as follows. (1) Utilizing the worm-starting technique to optimize λ\nThe values of λ in the sparse representation methods discussed above are always set to be a specific small constant. However, Hale et al. [86] concluded that the technique that exploits a decreasing value of λ from a warm-starting point can more efficiently solve the sub-problem VI.14 than ISTA that is a fixed point iteration scheme. SpaRSA uses an adaptive continuation technique to update the value of λ so that it can lead to the fastest convergence. The procedure regenerates the value of λ using\nλ = max{γ‖XTy‖∞, λ} (VI.18)\nwhere γ is a small constant. (2) Utilizing the BB spectral method to approximate Hf (α)\nISTA employs 1τ I to approximate the matrix Hf (α), which is the Hessian matrix of f(α) in problem VI.9 and FISTA exploits the Lipschitz constant of ∇f(α) to replace Hf (α). However, SpaRSA utilizes the BB spectral method to choose the value of τ to mimic the Hessian matrix. The value of τ is required to satisfy the condition:\n1\nτ t+1 (αt+1 −αt) ≈ ∇f(αt+1)−∇f(αt) (VI.19)\nwhich satisfies the minimization problem\n1 τ t+1 =argmin ‖ 1 τ (αt+1 −αt)− (∇f(αt+1)−∇f(αt))‖22\n= (αt+1 −αt)T (∇f(αt+1)−∇f(αt))\n(αt+1 −αt)T (αt+1 −αt) (VI.20)\nFor problem VI.14, SpaRSA requires that the value of λ is a decreasing sequence using the Eq. VI.18 and the value of τ should meet the condition of Eq. VI.20.

The lp-norm (0<p<1) regularization problem is always difficult to be efficiently addressed and it has also attracted wide interests from large numbers of research groups. However, the research group led by Zongben Xu summarizes the conclusion that the most impressive and representative algorithm of the lp-norm (0<p<1) regularization is sparse representation with the l1/2-norm regularization [87]. Moreover, they have proposed some effective methods to solve the l1/2norm regularization problem [60, 88].\nIn this section, a half proximal algorithm is introduced to solve the l1/2-norm regularization problem [60], which matches the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm for the l1-norm regularization discussed above and the iterative hard thresholding algorithm for the l0-norm regularization. Sparse representation with the l1/2-norm regularization is explicitly to solve the problem as follows:\nα̂ = argmin{F (α) = ‖Xα− y‖22 + λ‖α‖ 1/2 1/2} (VI.21)\nwhere the first-order optimality condition of F (α) on α can be formulated as\n∇F (α) = XT (Xα− y) + λ 2 ∇(‖α‖1/21/2) = 0 (VI.22)\nwhich admits the following equation:\nXT (y −Xα) = λ 2 ∇(‖α‖1/21/2) (VI.23)\nwhere ∇(‖α‖1/21/2) denotes the gradient of the regularization term ‖α‖1/21/2. Subsequently, an equivalent transformation of Eq. VI.23 is made by multiplying a positive constant τ and adding a parameter α to both sides. That is,\nα+ τXT (y −Xα) = α+ τ λ 2 ∇(‖α‖1/21/2) (VI.24)\nTo this end, the resolvent operator [60] is introduced to compute the resolvent solution of the right part of Eq. VI.24, and the resolvent operator is defined as\nRλ, 1 2 (•) =\n(\nI + λτ\n2 ∇(‖ • ‖1/21/2)\n)−1 (VI.25)\nwhich is very similar to the inverse function of the right part of Eq. VI.24. The resolvent operator is always satisfied no matter whether the resolvent solution of ∇(‖ • ‖1/21/2) exists or not [60]. Applying the resolvent operator to solve problem VI.24\nα = (I + λτ\n2 ∇(‖ • ‖1/21/2)) −1(α+ τXt(y −Xα)) = Rλ,1/2(α+ τX T (y −Xα)) (VI.26)\ncan be obtained which is well-defined. θ(α) = α+ τXT (y− Xα) is denoted and the resolvent operator can be explicitly expressed as:\nRλ, 1 2 (x) = (fλ, 1 2 (x1), fλ, 1 2 (x2), · · · , fλ, 1 2 (xN )) T (VI.27)\nwhere\nfλ, 1 2 (xi) =\n2 3 xi(1 + cos( 2π 3 − 2 3 gλ(xi)),\ngλ(xi) = arg cos( λ 8 ( |xi| 3 )− 3 2 )\n(VI.28)\nwhich have been demonstrated in the literature [60]. Thus the half proximal thresholding function for the l1/2norm regularization is defined as below:\nhλτ, 1 2 (xi) =\n{\nfλτ, 1 2 (xi), if |xi| > 3 √ 54 4 (λτ) 2 3\n0, otherwise (VI.29)\nwhere the threshold 3 √ 54 4 (λτ) 2 3 has been conceived and demonstrated in the literature [60]. Therefore, if Eq. VI.29 is applied to Eq. VI.27, the half proximal thresholding function, instead of the resolvent operator, for the l1/2-norm regularization problem VI.25 can be explicitly reformulated as:\nα = Hλτ, 1 2 (θ(α)) (VI.30)\nwhere the half proximal thresholding operator H [60] is deductively constituted by Eq. VI.29.\nUp to now, the half proximal thresholding algorithm has been completely structured by Eq. VI.30. However, the options of the regularization parameter λ in Eq. VI.24 can seriously dominate the quality of the representation solution in problem VI.21, and the values of λ and τ can be specifically fixed by\nτ = 1− ε ‖X‖2 and λ =\n√ 96\n9τ |[θ(α)]k+1 | 3 2 (VI.31)\nwhere ε is a very small constant, which is very close to zero, the k denotes the limit of sparsity (i.e. k-sparsity), and [•]k refers to the k-th largest component of [•]. The half proximal thresholding algorithm for l1/2-norm regularization based sparse representation is summarized in Algorithm 7 and more detailed inferences and analyses can be found in the literature [60, 88].\nAlgorithm 7.

In this section, the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) is introduced to solve the sparse representation problem III.9.\nFirst, the augmented Lagrangian function of problem III.9 is conceived by introducing an additional equality constrained function, which is enforced on the Lagrange function in problem III.12. That is,\nL(α, λ) = ‖α‖1+ λ\n2 ‖y−Xα‖22 s.t. y−Xα = 0 (VI.32)\nThen, a new optimization problem VI.32 with the form of the Lagrangain function is reformulated as\nargminLλ(α, z) = ‖α‖1 + λ\n2 ‖y −Xα‖22 + zT (y −Xα)\n(VI.33) where z ∈ Rd is called the Lagrange multiplier vector or dual variable and Lλ(α, z) is denoted as the augmented Lagrangian function of problem III.9. The optimization problem VI.33 is a joint optimization problem of the sparse representation coefficient α and the Lagrange multiplier vector z. Problem VI.33 is solved by optimizing α and z alternatively as follows:\nαt+1 = argminLλ(α, z t)\n= argmin(‖α‖1 + λ\n2 ‖y −Xα‖22 + (zt)TXα)\n(VI.34)\nzt+1 = zt + λ(y −Xαt+1) (VI.35)\nwhere problem VI.34 can be solved by exploiting the FISTA algorithm. Problem VI.34 is iteratively solved and the parameter z is updated using Eq. VI.35 until the termination condition is satisfied. Furthermore, if the method of employing ALM to solve problem VI.33 is denoted as the primal augmented Lagrangian method (PALM) [89], the dual function of problem III.9 can also be addressed by the ALM algorithm, which is denoted as the dual augmented Lagrangian method (DALM) [89]. Subsequently, the dual optimization problem III.9 is discussed and the ALM algorithm is utilized to solve it.\nFirst, consider the following equation:\n‖α‖1 = max ‖θ‖∞≤1 〈θ,α〉 (VI.36)\nwhich can be rewritten as\n‖α‖1 = max{〈θ,α〉 − IB1 ∞ } or ‖α‖1 = sup{〈θ,α〉 − IB1\n∞\n} (VI.37)\nwhere Bλp = {x ∈ RN | ‖x‖p ≤ λ} and IΩ(x) is a indicator function, which is defined as IΩ(x) = { 0 ,x ∈ Ω ∞ ,x 6∈ Ω .\nHence,\n‖α‖1 = max{〈θ,α〉 : θ ∈ B1∞} (VI.38)\nSecond, consider the Lagrange dual problem of problem III.9 and its dual function is\ng(λ) = inf α {‖α‖1+λT (y−Xα)} = λTy−sup α {λTXα−‖α‖1} (VI.39) where λ ∈ Rd is a Lagrangian multiplier. If the definition of conjugate function is applied to Eq. VI.37, it can be verified that the conjugate function of IB1\n∞ (θ) is ‖α‖1. Thus Eq. VI.39 can be equivalently reformulated as\ng(λ) = λTy − IB1 ∞ (XTλ) (VI.40)\nThe Lagrange dual problem, which is associated with the primal problem III.9, is an optimization problem:\nmax λ\nλTy s.t.

      "heading" : "A. LASSO homotopy",
      "text" : "Because of the significance of parameters in l1-norm minimization, the well-known LASSO homotopy algorithm is proposed to solve the LASSO problem in III.9 by tracing the whole homotopy solution path in a range of decreasing values of parameter λ. It is demonstrated that problem III.12 with an appropriate parameter value is equivalent to problem III.9 [29]. Moreover, it is apparent that as we change λ from a very large value to zero, the solution of problem III.12 is converging to the solution of problem III.9 [29]. The set of varying value λ conceives the solution path and any point on the solution path is the optimality condition of problem III.12. More specifically, the LASSO homotopy algorithm starts at an large initial value of parameter λ and terminates at a point of λ, which approximates zero, along the homotopy solution path so that the optimal solution converges to the solution of problem III.9. The fundamental of the homotopy algorithm is that the homotopy solution path is a piecewise linear path with a discrete number of operations while the value of the homotopy parameter changes, and the direction of each segment and the step size are absolutely determined by the sign sequence and the support of the solution on the corresponding segment, respectively [96].\nBased on the basic ideas in a convex optimization problem, it is a necessary condition that the zero vector should be a solution of the subgradient of the objective function of problem III.12. Thus, we can obtain the subgradiential of the objective function with respect to α for any given value of λ, that is,\n∂L ∂α = −XT (y −Xα) + λ∂‖α‖1 (VII.1)\nwhere the first term r = XT (y −Xα) is called the vector of residual correlations, and ∂‖α‖1 is the subgradient obtained by\n∂‖α‖1 = { θ ∈ RN ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ θi = sgn(αi), αi 6= 0 θi ∈ [−1, 1], αi = 0 }\nLet Λ and u denote the support of α and the sign sequence of α on its support Λ, respectively. XΛ denotes that the indices of all the samples in XΛ are all included in the support set Λ. If we analyze the KKT optimality condition for problem III.12, we can obtain the following two equivalent conditions of problem VII.1, i.e.\nXΛ(y −Xα) = λu; ‖XTΛc(y −Xα)‖∞ ≤ λ (VII.2)\nwhere Λc denotes the complementary set of the set Λ. Thus, the optimality conditions in VII.2 can be divided into N constraints and the homotopy algorithm maintains both of the conditions along the optimal homotopy solution path for any λ ≥ 0. As we decrease the value of λ to λ − τ , for a small value of τ , the following conditions should be satisfied\nXTΛ (y −Xα) + τXTΛXδ = (λ− τ)u (a) ‖p+ τq‖∞ ≤ λ− τ (b) (VII.3)\nwhere p = XT (y−Xα), q = XTXδ and δ is the update direction.\nGenerally, the homotopy algorithm is implemented iteratively and it follows the homotopy solution path by updating the support set by decreasing parameter λ from a large value to the desired value. The support set of the solution will be updated and changed only at a critical point of λ, where either an existing nonzero element shrinks to zero or a new nonzero element will be added into the support set. The two most important parameters are the step size τ and the update direction δ. At the l-th stage (if (XTΛXΛ)\n−1 exists), the homotopy algorithm first calculates the update direction, which can be obtained by solving\nXTΛXΛδl = u (VII.4)\nThus, the solution of problem VII.4 can be written as\nδl =\n{ (XTΛXΛ) −1u, on Λ 0, otherwise\n(VII.5)\nSubsequently, the homotopy algorithm computes the step size τ to the next critical point by tracing the homotopy solution path. i.e. the homotopy algorithm moves along the update direction until one of constraints in VII.3 is not satisfied. At this critical point, a new nonzero element must enter the support Λ, or one of the nonzero elements in α will be shrink to zero, i.e. this element must be removed from the support set Λ. Two typical cases may lead to a new critical point, where either condition of VII.3 is violated. The minimum step size which leads to a critical point can be easily obtained by computing τ∗l = min(τ + l , τ − l ), and τ + l and τ − l are computed by\nτ+l = mini∈Λc\n( λ− pi\n1− xTi XΛδl , λ+ pi 1 + xTi XΛδl\n)\n+\n(VII.6)\nτ−l = mini∈Λ (−αil δil ) +\n(VII.7)\nwhere pi = xTi (y − xiαil) and min(·)+ denotes that the minimum is operated over only positive arguments. τ+l is the minimum step size that turns an inactive element at the index i+ in to an active element, i.e. the index i+ should be added into the support set. τ−l is the minimum step size that shrinks the value of a nonzero active element to zero at the index i− and the index i− should be removed from the support set. The solution is updated by αl+1 = αl + τ∗l δ, and its support and sign sequence are renewed correspondingly.\nThe homotopy algorithm iteratively computes the step size and the update direction, and updates the homotopy solution and its corresponding support and sign sequence till the\ncondition ‖p‖∞ = 0 is satisfied so that the solution of problem III.9 is reached. The principal steps of the LASSO homotopy algorithm have been summarized in Algorithm 9. For further description and analyses, please refer to the literature [29, 96].\nAlgorithm 9.

Here the iterative reweighting algorithm via homotopy is introduced. The objective function of the weighted l1-norm minimization is formulated as\nargmin 1\n2 ‖Xα− y‖22 + ‖Wα‖1 (VII.11)\nwhere W = diag[w1, w2, · · · , wN ] is the weight of the l1-norm and also is a diagonal matrix. For more explicit description, problem VII.11 can be rewritten as\nargmin 1\n2 ‖Xα− y‖22 +\nN∑\ni=1\nwi|αi| (VII.12)\nA common method [42, 73] to update the weight W is achieved by exploiting the solution of problem VII.12, i.e. α, at the previous iteration, and for the i-th element of the weight wi is updated by\nwi = λ\n|αi|+ σ (VII.13)\nwhere parameters λ and σ are both small constants.

Apparently, problem VII.14 can be evolved to problem VII.12 with the increasing value of the\nhomotopy parameter by tracing the homotopy solution path. Similar to the LASSO homotopy algorithm, problem VII.14 is also piecewise linear along the homotopy path, and for any value of σ, the following conditions should be satisfied\nxTi (Xα− y) = −((1− σ)wi + σŵi)ui for i ∈ Λ (a) |xTi (Xα− y)| < (1 − σ)wi + σŵi for i ∈ Λc (b)\n(VII.15) where xi is the i-th column of the measurement X , wi and ŵi are the given weight and new obtained weight, respectively. Moreover, for the optimal step size σ, when the homotopy parameter changes from σ to σ+ τ in the update direction δ, the following optimality conditions also should be satisfied\nXTΛ (Xα− y) + τXTΛXδ = −((1− σ)W + σŴ )u + τ(W − Ŵ )u (a) |p− τq| ≤ r + τs (b)\n(VII.16)\nwhere u is the sign sequence of α on its support Λ, pi = xTi (Xα − y), qi = xTi Xδ, ri = (1 − σ)wi + σŵi and si = ŵi − wi. Thus, at the l-th stage (if (XTi Xi)−1 exists), the update direction of the homotopy algorithm can be computed by\nδl =\n{\n(XTΛXΛ) −1(W − Ŵ )u, on Λ 0, otherwise (VII.17)\nThe step size which can lead to a critical point can be computed by τ∗l = min(τ + l , τ − l ), and τ + l and τ − l are computed by\nτ+l = mini∈Λc ( ri − pi qi − si , −ri − pi qi + si )\n+\n(VII.18)\nτ−l = mini∈Λ (−αil δil ) +\n(VII.19)\nwhere τ+l is the minimum step size so that the index i + should be added into the support set and τ−l is the minimum step size that shrinks the value of a nonzero active element to zero at the index i−. The solution and homotopy parameter are updated by αl+1 = αl + τ∗l δ, and σl+1 = σl + τ ∗ l , respectively. The homotopy algorithm updates its support set and sign sequence accordingly until the new critical point of the homotopy parameter σl+1 = 1. The main steps of this algorithm are summarized in Algorithm 11 and more information can be found in literature [96]."

      "heading" : "A. Sparse representation in dictionary learning",
      "text" : "The history of modeling dictionary could be traced back to 1960s, such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) [103]. An\nover-complete dictionary that can lead to sparse representation is usually achieved by exploiting pre-specified set of transformation functions, i.e. transform domain method [5], or is devised based on learning, i.e. dictionary learning methods [104]. Both of the transform domain and dictionary learning based methods transform image samples into other domains and the similarity of transformation coefficients are exploited [105]. The difference between them is that the transform domain methods usually utilize a group of fixed transformation functions to represent the image samples, whereas the dictionary learning methods apply sparse representations on a over-complete dictionary with redundant information. Moreover, exploiting the pre-specified transform matrix in transform domain methods is attractive because of its fast and simplicity. Specifically, the transform domain methods usually represent the image patches by using the orthonormal basis such as over-complete wavelets transform [106], super-wavelet transform [107], bandelets [108], curvelets transform [109], contourlets transform [110] and steerable wavelet filters [111]. However, the dictionary learning methods exploiting sparse representation have the potential capabilities of outperforming the pre-determined dictionaries based on transformation functions. Thus, in this subsection we only focus on the modern over-complete dictionary learning methods.\nAn effective dictionary can lead to excellent reconstruction results and satisfactory applications, and the choice of dictionary is also significant to the success of sparse representation technique. Different tasks have different dictionary learning rules. For example, image classification requires that the dictionary contains discriminative information such that the solution of sparse representation possesses the capability of distinctiveness. The purpose of dictionary learning is motivated from sparse representation and aims to learn a faithful and effective dictionary to largely approximate or simulate the specific data. In this section, some parameters are defined as matrix Y = [y1,y2, · · · ,yN ], matrix X = [x1,x2, · · · ,xt]T , and dictionary D = [d1,d2, · · · ,dM ].\nFrom the notations of the literature [22, 112], the framework of dictionary learning can be generally formulated as an optimization problem\narg min D∈Ω,xi\n{\n1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n( 1\n2 ‖yi −Dxi‖22 + λP (xi))\n}\n(VIII.1)\nwhere Ω = {D = [d1,d2, · · · ,dM ] : dTi di = 1, i = 1, 2, · · · ,M} (M here may not be equal to N ), N denotes the number of the known data set (eg. training samples in image classification), yi is the i-th sample vector from a known set, D is the learned dictionary and xi is the sparsity vector. P (xi) and λ are the penalty or regularization term and a tuning parameter, respectively. The regularization term of problem VIII.1 controls the degree of sparsity. That is, different kinds of the regularization terms can immensely dominate the dictionary learning results.\nOne spontaneous idea of defining the penalty term P (xi) is to introduce the l0-norm regularization, which leads to the sparsest solution of problem VIII.1. As a result, the theory of sparse representation can be applied to dictionary\nlearning. The most representative dictionary learning based on the l0-norm penalty is the K-SVD algorithm [8], which is widely used in image denoising. Because the solution of l0-norm regularization is usually a NP-hard problem, utilizing a convex relaxation strategy to replace l0-norm regularization is an advisable choice for dictionary learning. As a convex relaxation method of l0-norm regularization, the l1-norm regularization based dictionary learning has been proposed in large numbers of dictionary learning schemes. In the stage of convex relaxation methods, there are three optimal forms for updating a dictionary: the one by one atom updating method, group atoms updating method, and all atoms updating method [112]. Furthermore, because of over-penalization in l1norm regularization, non-convex relaxation strategies also have been employed to address dictionary learning problems. For example, Fan and Li proposed a smoothly clipped absolution deviation (SCAD) penalty [113], which employed an iterative approximate Newton-Raphson method for penalizing least sequences and exploited the penalized likelihood approaches for variable selection in linear regression models. Zhang introduced and studied the non-convex minimax concave (MC) family [114] of non-convex piecewise quadratic penalties to make unbiased variable selection for the estimation of regression coefficients, which was demonstrated its effectiveness by employing an oracle inequality. Friedman proposed to use the logarithmic penalty for a model selection [115] and used it to solve the minimization problems with non-convex regularization terms. From the viewpoint of updating strategy, most of the dictionary learning methods always iteratively update the sparse approximation or representation solution and the dictionary alternatively, and more dictionary learning theoretical results and analyses can be found in the literature [116, 117].\nRecently, varieties of dictionary learning methods have been proposed and researchers have attempted to exploit different strategies for implementing dictionary learning tasks based on sparse representation. There are several means to categorize these dictionary learning algorithms into various groups. For example, dictionary learning methods can be divided into three groups in the context of different norms utilized in the penalty term, that is, l0-norm regularization based methods, convex relaxation methods and non-convex relaxation methods [118]. Moreover, dictionary learning algorithms can also be divided into three other categories in the presence of different structures. The first category is dictionary learning under the probabilistic framework such as maximum likelihood methods [119], the method of optimal directions (MOD) [120], and the maximum a posteriori probability method [121]. The second category is clustering based dictionary learning approaches such as KSVD [122], which can be viewed as a generalization of K-means. The third category is dictionary learning with certain structures, which are grouped into two significative aspects, i.e. directly modeling the relationship between each atom and structuring the corrections between each atom with purposive sparsity penalty functions. There are two typical models for these kinds of dictionary learning algorithms, sparse and shift-invariant representation of dictionary learning and structure sparse regularization based dictionary learning,\nsuch as hierarchical sparse dictionary learning [123] and group or block sparse dictionary learning [124]. Recently, some researchers [22] categorized the latest methods of dictionary learning into four groups, online dictionary learning [125], joint dictionary learning [126], discriminative dictionary learning [127], and supervised dictionary learning [128].\nAlthough there are extensive strategies to divide the available sparse representation based dictionary learning methods into different categories, the strategy used here is to categorize the current prevailing dictionary learning approaches into two main classes: supervised dictionary learning and unsupervised dictionary learning, and then specific representative algorithms are explicitly introduced.\n1) Unsupervised dictionary learning: From the viewpoint of theoretical basis, the main difference of unsupervised and supervised dictionary learning relies on whether the class label is exploited in the process of learning for obtaining the dictionary. Unsupervised dictionary learning methods have been widely implemented to solve image processing problems, such as image compression, and feature coding of image representation [129, 130]. (1) KSVD for unsupervised dictionary learning\nOne of the most representative unsupervised dictionary learning algorithms is the KSVD method [122], which is a modification or an extension of method of directions (MOD) algorithm. The objective function of KSVD is\nargmin D,X {‖Y −DX‖2F} s.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ k, i = 1, 2, · · · , N (VIII.2) where Y ∈ Rd×N is the matrix composed of all the known examples, D ∈ Rd×N is the learned dictionary, X ∈ RN×N is the matrix of coefficients, k is the limit of sparsity and xi denotes the i-th row vector of the matrix X . Problem VIII.2 is a joint optimization problem with respect to D and X , and the natural method is to alternatively optimize the D and X iteratively.\nAlgorithm 12. The K-SVD algorithm for dictionary learning Task: Learning a dictionary D: argminD,X ‖Y −DX‖2F s.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ k, i = 1, 2, · · · , N Input: The matrix composed of given samples Y = [y1,y2, · · · ,ym]. Initialization: Set the initial dictionary D to the l2–norm unit matrix, i = 1. While not converged do\nStep 1: For each given example yi, employing the classical sparse representation with l0-norm regularization to solve problem VIII.3 for further estimating Xi,set l = 1.\nWhile l is not equal to k do Step 2: Compute the overall representation residual\nEl = Y − ∑ j 6=l djx T j .\nStep 3: Extract the column items of El which corresponds to the nonzero elements of xTl and obtain E P l . Step 4: SVD decomposes EPl into E P l = UΛV\nT . Step 5: Update dl to the first column of U and update\ncorresponding coefficients in xTl by Λ(1, 1) times the first column of V .\nStep 6: l = l+ 1. End While\nStep 7: i = i+ 1. End While Output: dictionary D\nMore specifically, when fixing dictionary D, problem VIII.2\nis converted to\nargmin X ‖Y −DX‖2F s.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ k, i = 1, 2, · · · , N (VIII.3) which is called sparse coding and k is the limit of sparsity. Then, its subproblem is considered as follows:\nargmin xi\n‖yi −Dxi‖22 s.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ k, i = 1, 2, · · · , N\nwhere we can iteratively resort to the classical sparse representation with l0 -norm regularization such as MP and OMP, for estimating xi.\nWhen fixing X , problem VIII.3 becomes a simple regression model for obtaining D, that is\nD̂ = argmin D\n‖Y −DX‖2F (VIII.4)\nwhere D̂ = Y X† = Y XT (XXT )−1 and the method is called MOD. Considering that the computational complexity of the inverse problem in solving problem VIII.4 is O(n3), it is favorable, for further improvement, to update dictionary D by fixing the other variables. The strategy of the KSVD algorithm rewrites the problem VIII.4 into\nD̂ =argmin D ‖Y −DX‖2F = argmin D\n‖Y − N∑\nj=1\ndjx T j ‖2F\n=argmin D\n‖(Y − ∑\nj 6=l djx\nT j )− dlxTl ‖2F\n(VIII.5)\nwhere xj is the j-th row vector of the matrix X . First the overall representation residual El = Y − ∑ j 6=l djx T j is computed, and then dl and xl are updated. In order to maintain the sparsity of xTl in this step, only the nonzero elements of xTl should be preserved and only the nonzero items of El should be reserved, i.e. EPl , from dlx T l . Then, SVD decomposes EPl into E P l = UΛV\nT , and then updates dictionary dl. The specific KSVD algorithm for dictionary learning is summarized to Algorithm 12 and more information can be found in the literature [122]. (2) Locality constrained linear coding for unsupervised dictionary learning\nThe locality constrained linear coding (LLC) algorithm [130] is an efficient local coordinate linear coding method, which projects each descriptor into a local constraint system to obtain an effective codebook or dictionary. It has been demonstrated that the property of locality is more essential than sparsity, because the locality must lead to sparsity but not vice-versa, that is, a necessary condition of sparsity is locality, but not the reverse [130].\nAssume that Y = [y1,y2, · · · ,yN ] ∈ Rd×N is a matrix composed of local descriptors extracted from examples and the objective dictionary D = [d1,d2, · · · ,dN ] ∈ Rd×N . The objective function of LLC is formulated as\nargmin xi,D\nN∑\ni=1\n‖yi −Dxi‖22 + µ‖b⊙ xi‖22\ns.t. 1Txi = 1, i = 1, 2, · · · , N (VIII.6)\nwhere µ is a small constant as a regularization parameter for adjusting the weighting decay speed, ⊙ is the operator of the element-wise multiplication, xi is the code for yi, 1 ∈ RN×1 is defined as a vector with all elements as 1 and vector b is the locality adaptor, which is, more specifically, set as\nb = exp\n( dist(yi, D)\nσ\n)\n(VIII.7)\nwhere dist(yi, D) = [dist(yi,d1), · · · , dist(yi,dN)] and dist(yi,dj) denotes the distance between yi and dj with different distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance and Chebyshev distance. Specifically, the i-th value of vector b is defined as bi = exp ( dist(yi,di)\nσ\n)\n. The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to generate the codebook D, and then the solution of LLC can be deduced as:\nx̂i = (Ci + µ diag 2(b))\\1 (VIII.8)\nxi = x̂i/ 1 T x̂i (VIII.9)\nwhere the operator a\\b denotes a−1b, and Ci = (DT − 1yTi )(D\nT − 1yTi )T is the covariance matrix with respect to yi. This is called the LLC algorithm. Furthermore, the incremental codebook optimization algorithm has also been proposed to obtain a more effective and optimal codebook, and the objective function is reformulated as\nargmin xi,D\nN∑\ni=1\n‖yi −Dxi‖22 + µ‖b⊙ xi‖22\ns.t. 1Txi = 1, ∀i; ‖dj‖22 ≤ 1, ∀j (VIII.10)\nActually, the problem VIII.10 is a process of feature extraction and the property of ‘locality’ is achieved by constructing a local coordinate system by exploiting the local bases for each descriptor, and the local bases in the algorithm are simply obtained by using the K nearest neighbors of yi. The incremental codebook optimization algorithm in problem VIII.10 is a joint optimization problem with respect to D and xi, and it can be solved by iteratively optimizing one when fixing the other alternatively. The main steps of the incremental codebook optimization algorithm are summarized in Algorithm 13 and more information can be found in the literature [130]. (3) Other unsupervised dictionary learning methods\nA large number of different unsupervised dictionary learning methods have been proposed. The KSVD algorithm and LLC algorithm are only two typical unsupervised dictionary learning algorithms based on sparse representation. Additionally, Jenatton et al. [123] proposed a tree-structured dictionary learning problem, which exploited tree-structured sparse regularization to model the relationship between each atom and defined a proximal operator to solve the primaldual problem. Zhou et al. [131] developed a nonparametric Bayesian dictionary learning algorithm, which utilized hierarchical Bayesian to model parameters and employed the truncated beta-Bernoulli process to learn the dictionary. Ramirez and Shapiro [132] employed minimum description length to\nAlgorithm 13. The incremental codebook optimization algorithm Task: Learning a dictionary D: argminxi,D ∑N i=1 ‖yi−Dxi‖22+µ‖b⊙ xi‖22 s.t. 1Txi = 1, ∀i; ‖dj‖22 ≤ 1, ∀j Input: The matrix composed of given samples Y = [y1,y2, · · · ,yN ]. Initialization: i = 1, ε = 0.01, D initialized by K-Means clustering algorithm. While i is not equal to N do\nStep 1: Initialize b with 1×N zero vector. Step 2: Update locality constraint parameter b with\nbj = exp ( − dist(yi,dj) σ )\nfor ∀j. Step 3: Normalize b using the equation b = b−bmin\nbmax−bmin . Step 4: Exploit the LLC coding algorithm to obtain xi. Step 5: Keep the set of Di, whose corresponding entries of the code xi\nare greater than ε, and drop out other elements, i.e. index ← {j | abs{xi(j)} > ε} ∀j and Di ← D(:, index).\nStep 6: Update xi exploiting argmax ‖yi−Dixi‖22 s.t. 1Txi = 1. Step 7: Update dictionary D using a classical gradient descent method\nwith respect to problem VIII.6. Step 8: i = i+ 1.\nEnd While Output: dictionary D\nmodel an effective framework of sparse representation and dictionary learning, and this framework could conveniently incorporate prior information into the process of sparse representation and dictionary learning. Some other unsupervised dictionary learning algorithms also have been validated. Mairal et al. proposed an online dictionary learning [133] algorithm based on stochastic approximations, which treated the dictionary learning problem as the optimization of a smooth convex problem over a convex set and employed an iterative online algorithm at each step to solve the subproblems. Yang and Zhang proposed a sparse variation dictionary learning (SVDL) algorithm [134] for face recognition with a single training sample, in which a joint learning framework of adaptive projection and a sparse variation dictionary with sparse bases were simultaneously constructed from the gallery image set to the generic image set. Shi et al. proposed a minimax concave penalty based sparse dictionary learning (MCPSDL) [112] algorithm, which employed a non-convex relaxation online scheme, i.e. a minimax concave penalty, instead of using regular convex relaxation approaches as approximation of l0norm penalty in sparse representation problem, and designed a coordinate descend algorithm to optimize it. Bao et al. proposed a dictionary learning by proximal algorithm (DLPM) [118], which provided an efficient alternating proximal algorithm for solving the l0-norm minimization based dictionary learning problem and demonstrated its global convergence property.\n2) Supervised dictionary learning: Unsupervised dictionary learning just considers that the examples can be sparsely represented by the learned dictionary and leaves out the label information of the examples. Thus, unsupervised dictionary learning can perform very well in data reconstruction, such as image denoising and image compressing, but is not beneficial to perform classification. On the contrary, supervised dictionary learning embeds the class label into the process of sparse representation and dictionary learning so that this leads to the learned dictionary with discriminative information for effective classification.\n(1) Discriminative KSVD for dictionary learning Discriminative KSVD (DKSVD) [127] was designed to solve image classification problems. Considering the priorities of supervised learning theory in classification, DKSVD incorporates the dictionary learning with discriminative information and classifier parameters into the objective function and employs the KSVD algorithm to obtain the global optimal solution for all parameters. The objective function of the DKSVD algorithm is formulated as\n〈D,C,X〉 = arg min D,C,X ‖Y −DX‖2F + µ‖H − CX‖2F +η‖C‖2F s.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ k\n(VIII.11)\nwhere Y is the given input samples, D is the learned dictionary, X is the coefficient term, H is the matrix composed of label information corresponding to Y , C is the parameter term for classifier, and η and µ are the weights. With a view to the framework of KSVD, problem VIII.11 can be rewritten as\n〈D,C,X〉 = arg min D,C,X\n‖ (\nY√ µH\n) − (\nD√ µC\n)\nX‖2F +η‖C‖2F s.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ k\n(VIII.12)\nIn consideration of the KSVD algorithm, each column of the dictionary will be normalized to l2-norm unit vector and(\nD√ µC\n)\nwill also be normalized, and then the penalty\nterm ‖C‖2F will be dropped out and problem VIII.12 will be reformulated as\n〈Z,X〉 = argmin Z,X ‖W −ZX‖2F s.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ k (VIII.13)\nwhere W = ( Y√ µH ) , Z = ( D√ µC ) and apparently the formulation VIII.13 is the same as the framework of KSVD [122] in Eq. VIII.2 and it can be efficiently solved by the KSVD algorithm.\nMore specifically, the DKSVD algorithm contains two main phases: the training phase and classification phase. For the training phase, Y is the matrix composed of the training samples and the objective is to learn a discriminative dictionary D and the classifier parameter C. DKSVD updates Z column by column and for each column vector zi, DKSVD employs the KSVD algorithm to obtain zi and its corresponding weight. Then, the DKSVD algorithm normalizes the dictionary D and classifier parameter C by\nD′ = [d′1,d ′ 2, · · · ,d′M ] = [ d1‖d1‖ , d2 ‖d2‖ , · · · , dM ‖dM‖ ] C′ = [c′1, c ′ 2, · · · , c′M ] = [ c1‖d1‖ , c2 ‖d2‖ , · · · , cM ‖dM‖ ] x′i = xi × ‖di‖ (VIII.14) For the classification phase, Y is the matrix composed of the test samples. Based on the obtained learning results D′ and C′, the sparse coefficient matrix x̂i can be obtained for\neach test sample yi by exploiting the OMP algorithm, which is to solve\nx̂i = argmin ‖yi −D′x′i‖22 s.t. ‖x′i‖0 ≤ k (VIII.15)\nOn the basis of the corresponding sparse coefficient x̂i, the final classification, for each test sample yi, can be performed by judging the label result by multiplying x̂i by classifier C′, that is,\nlabel = C′ × x̂i (VIII.16)\nwhere the label is the final predicted label vector. The class label of yi is the determined class index of label.\nThe main highlight of DKSVD is that it employs the framework of KSVD to simultaneously learn a discriminative dictionary and classifier parameter, and then utilizes the efficient OMP algorithm to obtain a sparse representation solution and finally integrate the sparse solution and learned classifier for ultimate effective classification. (2) Label consistent KSVD for discriminative dictionary learning\nBecause of the classification term, a competent dictionary can lead to effectively classification results. The original sparse representation for face recognition [20] regards the raw data as the dictionary, and then reports its promising classification results. In this section, a label consistent KSVD (LC-KSVD) [135, 136] is introduced to learn an effective discriminative dictionary for image classification. As an extension of DKSVD, LC-KSVD exploits the supervised information to learn the dictionary and integrates the process of constructing the dictionary and optimal linear classifier into a mixed reconstructive and discriminative objective function, and then jointly obtains the learned dictionary and an effective classifier. The objective function of LC-KSVD is formulated as\n〈D,A,C,X〉 = arg min D,A,C,X ‖Y −DX‖2F + µ‖L−AX‖2F +η‖H − CX‖2F s.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ k\n(VIII.17)\nwhere the first term denotes the reconstruction error, the second term denotes the discriminative sparse-code error, and the final term denotes the classification error. Y is the matrix composed of all the input data, D is the learned dictionary, X is the sparse code term, µ and η are the weights of the corresponding contribution items, A is a linear transformation matrix, H is the matrix composed of label information corresponding to Y , C is the parameter term for classifier and L is a joint label matrix for labels of Y and D. For example, providing that Y = [y1 . . . y4] and D = [d1 . . . d4] where y1, y2, d1 and d2 are from the first class, and y3, y4, d3 and d4 are from the second class, and then the joint label matrix\nL can be defined as L =\n\n   1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1\n\n   . Similar to the\nDKSVD algorithm, the objective function VIII.17 can also be reformulated as\n〈Z,X〉 = argmin Z,X ‖T − ZX‖22 s.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ k (VIII.18)\nwhere T =\n\n Y√ µL√ ηH\n\n, Z =\n\n D√ µA√ ηC\n\n.\nThe learning process of the LC-KSVD algorithm, as is DKSVD, can be separated into two sections, the training term and the classification term. In the training section, since problem VIII.18 completely satisfies the framework of KSVD, the KSVD algorithm is applied to update Z atom by atom and compute X . Thus Z and X can be obtained. Then, the LCKSVD algorithm normalizes dictionary D, transform matrix A, and the classifier parameter C by\nD′ = [d′1,d ′ 2, · · · ,d′M ] = [ d1‖d1‖ , d2 ‖d2‖ , · · · , dM ‖dM‖ ] A′ = [a′1,a ′ 2, · · · ,a′M ] = [ a1‖d1‖ , a2 ‖d2‖ , · · · , aM ‖dM‖ ] C′ = [c′1, c ′ 2, · · · , c′M ] = [ c1‖d1‖ , c2 ‖d2‖ , · · · , cM ‖dM‖ ]\n(VIII.19) In the classification section, Y is the matrix composed of the test samples. On the basis of the obtained dictionary D′, the sparse coefficient x̂i can be obtained for each test sample yi by exploiting the OMP algorithm, which is to solve\nx̂i = argmin ‖yi −D′x′i‖22 s.t. ‖x′i‖0 ≤ k (VIII.20) The final classification is based on a simple linear predictive\nfunction\nl = argmax f\n{f = C′ × x̂i} (VIII.21)\nwhere f is the final predicting label vector and the test sample yi is classified as a member of the l-th class.\nThe main contribution of LC-KSVD is to jointly incorporate the discriminative sparse coding term and classifier parameter term into the objective function for learning a discriminative dictionary and classifier parameter. The LC-KSVD demonstrates that the obtained solution, compared to other methods, can prevent learning a suboptimal or local optimal solution in the process of learning a dictionary [135]. (3) Fisher discrimination dictionary learning for sparse representation\nFisher discrimination dictionary learning (FDDL) [137] incorporates the supervised information (class label information) and the Fisher discrimination message into the objective function for learning a structured discriminative dictionary, which is used for pattern classification. The general model of FDDL is formulated as\nJ(D,X) = argmin D,X {f(Y,D,X) + µ‖X‖1 + ηg(X)} (VIII.22) where Y is the matrix composed of input data, D is the learned dictionary, X is the sparse solution, and µ and η are two constants for tradeoff contributions. The first component is the discriminative fidelity term, the second component is the sparse regularization term, and the third component is the discriminative coefficient term, such as Fisher discrimination criterion in Eq. (VIII.23).\nConsidering the importance of the supervised information, i.e. label information, in classification, FDDL respectively updates the dictionary and computes the sparse representation solution class by class. Assume that Y i denotes the matrix of i-th class of input data, vector X i denotes the sparse representation coefficient of the learned dictionary D over Y i and X ij denotes the matrix composed of the sparse representation solutions, which correspond to the j-th class coefficients from X i. Di is denoted as the learned dictionary corresponding to the i-th class. Thus, the objective function of FDDL is\nJ(D,X) = argmin D,X (\nc∑\ni=1\nf(Y i, D,X i) + µ‖X‖1+\nη(tr(SW (X)− SB(X)) + λ‖X‖2F )) (VIII.23)\nwhere f(Y i, D,X i) = ‖Y i − DX i‖2F + ‖Y i − DiX ii‖2F +∑ j 6=i ‖DjX ij‖2F and SW (X) and SB(X) are the within-class scatter of X and between-class scatter of X , respectively. c is the number of the classes. To solve problem VIII.23, a natural idea of optimization is to alternatively optimize D and X class by class, and then the process of optimization is briefly introduced.\nWhen fixing D, problem VIII.23 can be solved by computing X i class by class, and its sub-problem is formulated as\nJ(X i) = argmin Xi\n( f(Y i, D,X i) + µ‖X i‖1 + ηg(X i) )\n(VIII.24) where g(X i) = ‖X i−Mi‖2F − ∑c t=1 ‖Mt−M‖2F +λ‖X i‖2F and Mj and M denote the mean matrices corresponding to the j-th class of X i and X i, respectively. Problem VIII.23 can be solved by the iterative projection method in the literature [138].\nWhen fixing α, problem VIII.23 can be rewritten as\nJ(D) = argmin D\n(‖Y i −DiX i − ∑\nj 6=i DjXj‖2F+\n‖Y i −DiX ii‖2F + ∑\nj 6=i ‖DiX ij‖2F )\n(VIII.25)\nwhere X i here denotes the sparse representation of Y over Di. In this section, each column of the learned dictionary is normalized to a unit vector with l2-norm. The optimization of problem VIII.25 computes the dictionary class by class and it can be solved by exploiting the algorithm in the literature [139].\nThe main contribution of the FDDL algorithm lies in combining the Fisher discrimination criterion into the process of dictionary learning. The discriminative power comes from the method of constructing the discriminative dictionary using the function f in problem VIII.22 and simultaneously formulates the discriminative sparse representation coefficients by exploiting the function g in problem VIII.22. (4) Other supervised dictionary learning for sparse representation\nUnlike unsupervised dictionary learning, supervised dictionary learning emphasizes the significance of the class label\ninformation and incorporates it into the learning process to enforce the discrimination of the learned dictionary. Recently, massive supervised dictionary learning algorithms have been proposed. For example, Yang et al. [139] presented a metaface dictionary learning method, which is motivated by ‘metagenes’ in gene expression data analysis. Rodriguez and Sapiro [140] produced a discriminative non-parametric dictionary learning (DNDL) framework based on the OMP algorithm for image classification. Kong et al. [141] introduced a learned dictionary with commonalty and particularity, called DL-COPAR, which integrated an incoherence penalty term into the objective function for obtaining the class-specific sub-dictionary. Gao et al. [142] learned a hybrid dictionary, i.e. category-specific dictionary and shared dictionary, which incorporated a crossdictionary incoherence penalty and self-dictionary incoherence penalty into the objective function for learning a discriminative dictionary. Jafari and Plumbley [143] presented a greedy adaptive dictionary learning method, which updated the learned dictionary with a minimum sparsity index. Some other supervised dictionary learning methods are also competent in image classification, such as supervised dictionary learning in [144]. Zhou et al. [145] developed a joint dictionary learning algorithm for object categorization, which jointly learned a commonly shared dictionary and multiply category-specific dictionaries for correlated object classes and incorporated the Fisher discriminant fidelity term into the process of dictionary learning. Ramirez et al. proposed a method of dictionary learning with structured incoherence (DLSI) [140], which unified the dictionary learning and sparse decomposition into a sparse dictionary learning framework for image classification and data clustering. Ma et al. presented a discriminative lowrank dictionary learning for sparse representation (DLRD SR) [146], in which the sparsity and the low-rank properties were integrated into one dictionary learning scheme where subdictionary with discriminative power was required to be lowrank. Lu et al. developed a simultaneous feature and dictionary learning [147] method for face recognition, which jointly learned the feature projection matrix for subspace learning and the discriminative structured dictionary. Yang et al. introduced a latent dictionary learning (LDL) [148] method for sparse representation based image classification, which simultaneously learned a discriminative dictionary and a latent representation model based on the correlations between label information and dictionary atoms. Jiang et al. presented a submodular dictionary learning (SDL) [149] method, which integrated the entropy rate of a random walk on a graph and a discriminative term into a unified objective function and devised a greedybased approach to optimize it. Si et al. developed a support vector guided dictionary learning (SVGDL) [150] method, which constructed a discriminative term by using adaptively weighted summation of the squared distances for all pairwise of the sparse representation solutions."

      "heading" : "B. Sparse representation in image processing",
      "text" : "Recently, sparse representation methods have been extensively applied to numerous real-world applications [151, 152]. The techniques of sparse representation have been gradually ex-\ntended and introduced to image processing, such as superresolution image processing, image denoising and image restoration.\nFirst, the general framework of image processing using sparse representation especially for image reconstruction should be introduced:\nStep 1: Partition the degraded image into overlapped patches or blocks.\nStep 2: Construct a dictionary, denoted as D, and assume that the following sparse representation formulation should be satisfied for each patch or block x of the image: α̂ = argmin ‖α‖p s.t. ‖x−HDα‖22 ≤ ε where H is a degradation matrix and 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. Step 3: Reconstruct each patch or block by exploiting x̂ = Dα̂. Step 4: Put the reconstructed patch to the image at the corresponding location and average each overlapped patches to make the reconstructed image more consistent and natural.\nStep 5: Repeat step 1 to 4 several times till a termination condition is satisfied.\nThe following part of this subsection is to explicitly introduce some image processing techniques using sparse representation.\nThe main task of super-resolution image processing is to extract the high super-resolution image from its low resolution counterpart and this challenging problem has attracted much attention. The most representative work was proposed to exploit the sparse representation theory to generate a superresolution (SRSR) image from a single low-resolution image in literature [153].\nSRSR is mainly performed on two compact learned dictionaries Dl and Dh, which are denoted as dictionaries of low-resolution image patches and its corresponding highresolution image patches, respectively. Dl is directly employed to recover high-resolution images from dictionary Dh. Let X and Y denote the high-resolution and its corresponding lowresolution images, respectively. x and y are a high-resolution image patch and its corresponding low-resolution image patch, respectively. Thus, x = Py and P is the projection matrix. Moreover, if the low resolution image Y is produced by downsampling and blurring from the high resolution image X , the following reconstruction constraint should be satisfied\nY = SBX (VIII.26)\nwhere S and B are a downsampling operator and a blurring filter, respectively. However, the solution of problem VIII.26 is ill-posed because infinite solutions can be achieved for a given low-resolution input image Y . To this end, SRSR [153] provides a prior knowledge assumption, which is formulated as\nx = Dhα s.t. ‖α‖0 ≤ k (VIII.27)\nwhere k is a small constant. This assumption gives a prior knowledge condition that any image patch x can be approximately represented by a linear combination of a few training samples from dictionary Dh. As presented in Subsection III-B, problem VIII.27 is an NP-hard problem and sparse representation with l1-norm regularization is introduced. If\nthe desired representation solution α is sufficiently sparse, problem VIII.27 can be converted into the following problem:\nargmin ‖α‖1 s.t. ‖x−Dhα‖22 ≤ ε (VIII.28)\nor argmin ‖x−Dhα‖22 + λ‖α‖1 (VIII.29)\nwhere ε is a small constant and λ is the Lagrange multiplier. The solution of problem VIII.28 can be achieved by two main phases, i.e. local model based sparse representation (LMBSR) and enhanced global reconstruction constraint. The first phase of SRSR, i.e. LMBSR, is operated on each image patch, and for each low-resolution image patch y, the following equation is satisfied\nargmin ‖Fy − FDlα‖22 + λ‖α‖1 (VIII.30)\nwhere F is a feature extraction operator. One-pass algorithm similar to that of [154] is introduced to enhance the compatibility between adjacent patches. Furthermore, a modified optimization problem is proposed to guarantee that the superresolution reconstruction coincides with the previously obtained adjacent high-resolution patches, and the problem is reformulated as\nargmin ‖α‖1 s.t. ‖Fy−FDlα‖22 ≤ ε1; ‖v−LDhα‖22 ≤ ε2 (VIII.31) where v is the previously obtained high-resolution image on the overlap region, and L refers to the region of overlap between the current patch and previously obtained highresolution image. Thus problem VIII.31 can be rewritten as\nargmin ‖ŷ −Dα‖22 + λ‖α‖1 (VIII.32)\nwhere ŷ = [ Fy v ] and D = [ FDl LDh ] . Problem VIII.32 can be simply solved by previously introduced solution of the sparse representation with l1-norm minimization. Assume that the optimal solution of problem VIII.32, i.e. α∗, is achieved, the high-resolution patch can be easily reconstructed by x = Dhα\n∗. The second phase of SRSR enforces the global reconstruction constraint to eliminate possible unconformity or noise from the first phase and make the obtained image more consistent and compatible. Suppose that the high-resolution image obtained by the first phase is denoted as matrix X0, we project X0 onto the solution space of the reconstruction constraint VIII.26 and the problem is formulated as follows\nX∗ = argmin ‖X −X0‖22 s.t. Y = SBX (VIII.33)\nProblem VIII.33 can be solved by the back-projection method in [155] and the obtained image X∗ is regarded as the final optimal high-resolution image. The entire super-resolution via sparse representation is summarized in algorithm 14 and more information can be found in the literature [153].\nFurthermore, extensive other methods based on sparse representation have been proposed to solve the super-resolution image processing problem. For example, Yang et al. presented a modified version called joint dictionary learning via sparse representation (JDLSR) [156], which jointly learned\nAlgorithm 14. Super-resolution via sparse representation\nInput: Training image patches dictionaries Dl and Dh, a low-resolution image Y . For each overlapped 3×3 patches y of Y using one-pass algorithm, from left to right and top to bottom\nStep 1: Compute optimal sparse representation coefficients α∗ in problem (VIII.32). Step 2: Compute the high-resolution patch by x = Dhα∗. Step 3: Put the patch x into a high-resolution image X0 in corresponding\nlocation. End\nStep 4: Compute the final super-resolution image X∗ in problem (VIII.33). Output: X∗\ntwo dictionaries that enforced the similarity of sparse representation for low-resolution and high-resolution images. Tang et al. [157] first explicitly analyzed the rationales of the sparse representation theory in performing the super-resolution task, and proposed to exploit the L2-Boosting strategy to learn coupled dictionaries, which were employed to construct sparse coding space. Zhang et al. [158] presented an image super-resolution reconstruction scheme by employing the dualdictionary learning and sparse representation method for image super-resolution reconstruction and Gao et al. [159] proposed a sparse neighbor embedding method, which incorporated the sparse neighbor search and HoG clustering method into the process of image super-resolution reconstruction. FernandezGranda and Candes [160] designed a transform-invariant group sparse regularizer by implementing a data-driven nonparametric regularizers with learned domain transform on group sparse representation for high image super-resolution. Lu et al. [161] proposed a geometry constrained sparse representation method for single image super-resolution by jointly obtaining an optimal sparse solution and learning a discriminative and reconstructive dictionary. Dong et al. [162] proposed to harness an adaptive sparse optimization with nonlocal regularization based on adaptive principal component analysis enhanced by nonlocal similar patch grouping and nonlocal self-similarity quadratic constraint to solve the image high super-resolution problem. Dong et al. [163] proposed to integrate an adaptive sparse domain selection and an adaptive regularization based on piecewise autoregressive models into the sparse representations framework for single image superresolution reconstruction. Mallat and Yu [164] proposed a sparse mixing estimator for image super-resolution, which introduced an adaptive estimator models by combining a group of linear inverse estimators based on different prior knowledge for sparse representation.\nNoise in an image is unavoidable in the process of image acquisition. The need for sparse representation may arise when noise exists in image data. In such a case, the image with noise may lead to missing information or distortion such that this results in a decrease of the precision and accuracy of image processing. Eliminating such noise is greatly beneficial to many applications. The main goal of image denoising is to distinguish the actual signal and noise signal so that we can remove the noise and reconstruct the genuine image. In the presence of image sparsity and redundancy representation\n[4, 7], sparse representation for image denoising first extracts the sparse image components, which are regarded as useful information, and then abandons the representation residual, which is treated as the image noise term, and finally reconstructs the image exploiting the pre-obtained sparse components, i.e. noise-free image. Extensive research articles for image denoising based on sparse representation have been published. For example, Donoho [8, 29, 165] first discovered the connection between the compressed sensing and image denoising. Subsequently, the most representative work of using sparse representation to make image denoising was proposed in literature [166], in which a global sparse representation model over learned dictionaries (SRMLD) was used for image denoising. The following prior assumption should be satisfied: every image block of image x, denoted as z, can be sparsely represented over a dictionary D, i.e. the solution of the following problem is sufficiently sparse:\nargmin α\n‖α‖0 s.t. Dα = z (VIII.34)\nAnd an equivalent problem can be reformulated for a proper value of λ, i.e.\nargmin α\n‖Dα− z‖22 + λ‖α‖0 (VIII.35)\nIf we take the above prior knowledge into full consideration, the objective function of SRMLD based on Bayesian treatment is formulated as\narg min D,αi,x\nδ‖x− y‖22 + M∑\ni=1\n‖Dαi − Pix‖22 + M∑\ni=1 λi‖αi‖0 (VIII.36)\nwhere x is the finally denoised image, y the measured image with white and additive Gaussian white noise, Pi is a projection operator that extracts the i-th block from image x, M is the number of the overlapping blocks, D is the learned dictionary, αi is the coefficients vector, δ is the weight of the first term and λi is the Lagrange multiplier. The first term in VIII.36 is the log-likelihood global constraint such that the obtained noise-free image x is sufficiently similar to the original image y. The second and third terms are the prior knowledge of the Bayesian treatment, which is presented in problem VIII.35. The optimization of problem VIII.35 is a joint optimization problem with respect to D, αi and x. It can be solved by alternatively optimizing one variable when fixing the others. The process of optimization is briefly introduced below.\nWhen dictionary D and the solution of sparse representation αi are fixed, problem VIII.36 can be rewritten as\nargmin x\nδ‖x− y‖22 + M∑\ni=1\n‖Dαi − z‖22 (VIII.37)\nwhere z = Pix. Apparently, problem VIII.37 is a simple convex optimization problem and has a closed-form solution, which is given by\nx =\n( M∑\ni=1\nPTi Pi + δI\n)−1( M∑\ni=1\nPTi Dαi + δy\n)−1\n(VIII.38)\nWhen x is given, problem (VIII.36) can be written as\narg min D,αi\nM∑\ni=1\n‖Dαi − Pix‖22 + M∑\ni=1\nλi‖αi‖0 (VIII.39)\nwhere the problem can be divided into M sub-problems and the i-th sub-problem can be reformulated as the following dictionary learning problem:\narg min D,αi\n‖Dαi − z‖22 s.t. ‖αi‖0 ≤ τ (VIII.40)\nwhere z = Pix and τ is small constant. One can see that the sub-problem VIII.39 is the same as problem VIII.2 and it can be solved by the KSVD algorithm previously presented in Subsection VIII-A2. The algorithm of image denoising exploiting sparse and redundant representation over learned dictionary is summarized in Algorithm 15, and more information can be found in literature [166].\nAlgorithm 15. Image denoising via sparse and redundant representation over learned dictionary Task: To denoise a measured image y from white and additional Gaussian white noise: argminD,αi,x δ‖x− y‖22 + ∑M i=1 ‖Dαi − Pix‖22 + ∑M i=1 λi‖αi‖0 Input: Measured image sample y, the number of training iteration T . Initialization: t = 1, set x = y, D initialized by an overcomplete DCT dictionary. While t ≤ T do\nStep 1: For each image patch Pix, employ the KSVD algorithm to update the values of sparse representation solution αi and corresponding dictionary D.\nStep 2: t = t + 1 End While\nStep 3: Compute the value of x by using Eq.(VIII.38). Output: denoised image x\nMoreover, extensive modified sparse representation based image denoising algorithms have been proposed. For example, Dabov et al. [167] proposed an enhanced sparse representation with a block-matching 3-D (BM3D) transform-domain filter based on self-similarities and an enhanced sparse representation by clustering similar 2-D image patches into 3-D data spaces and an iterative collaborative filtering procedure for image denoising. Mariral et al. [168] proposed the use of extending the KSVD-based grayscale algorithm and a generalized weighted average algorithm for color image denoising. Protter and Elad [169] extended the techniques of sparse and redundant representations for image sequence denoising by exploiting spatio-temporal atoms, dictionary propagation over time and dictionary learning. Dong et al. [170] designed a clustering based sparse representation algorithm, which was formulated by a double-header sparse optimization problem built upon dictionary learning and structural clustering. Recently, Jiang et al. [171] proposed a variational encoding framework with a weighted sparse nonlocal constraint, which was constructed by integrating image sparsity prior and nonlocal self-similarity prior into a unified regularization term to overcome the mixed noise removal problem. Gu et al. [172] studied a weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) method with F -norm fidelity under different weighting rules optimized by non-local self-similarity for image denoising. Ji et al. [173] proposed a patch-based video denoising algorithm by stacking similar\npatches in both spatial and temporal domain to formulate a low-rank matrix problem with the nuclear norm. Cheng et al. [174] proposed an impressive image denoising method based on an extension of the KSVD algorithm via group sparse representation.\nThe primary purpose of image restoration is to recover the original image from the degraded or blurred image. The sparse representation theory has been extensively applied to image restoration. For example, Bioucas-Dias and Figueirdo [175] introduced a two-step iterative shrinkage/thresholding (TwIST) algorithm for image restoration, which is more efficient and can be viewed as an extension of the IST method. Mairal et al. [176] presented a multiscale sparse image representation framework based on the KSVD dictionary learning algorithm and shift-invariant sparsity prior knowledge for restoration of color images and video image sequence. Recently, Mairal et al. [177] proposed a learned simultaneous sparse coding (LSSC) model, which integrated sparse dictionary learning and nonlocal self-similarities of natural images into a unified framework for image restoration. Zoran and Weiss [178] proposed an expected patch log likelihood (EPLL) optimization model, which restored the image from patch to the whole image based on the learned prior knowledge of any patch acquired by Maximum A-Posteriori estimation instead of using simple patch averaging. Bao et al. [179] proposed a fast orthogonal dictionary learning algorithm, in which a sparse image representation based orthogonal dictionary was learned in image restoration. Zhang et al. [180] proposed a groupbased sparse representation, which combined characteristics from local sparsity and nonlocal self-similarity of natural images to the domain of the group. Dong et al. [181, 182] proposed a centralized sparse representation (CSR) model, which combined the local and nonlocal sparsity and redundancy properties for variational problem optimization by introducing a concept of sparse coding noise term.\nHere we mainly introduce a recently proposed simple but effective image restoration algorithm CSR model [181]. For a degraded image y, the problem of image restoration can be formulated as\ny = Hx+ v (VIII.41)\nwhere H is a degradation operator, x is the original highquality image and v is the Gaussian white noise. Suppose that the following two sparse optimization problems are satisfied\nαx = argmin ‖α‖1 s.t. ‖x−Dα‖22 ≤ ε (VIII.42)\nαy = argmin ‖α‖1 s.t. ‖x−HDα‖22 ≤ ε (VIII.43)\nwhere y and x respectively denote the degraded image and original high-quality image, and ε is a small constant. A new concept called sparse coding noise (SCN) is defined\nvα = αy −αx (VIII.44)\nGiven a dictionary D, minimizing SCN can make the image better reconstructed and improve the quality of the image restoration because x∗ = x̂ − x̃ = Dαy − Dαx = Dvα.\nThus, the objective function is reformulated as\nαy = argmin α ‖y −HDα‖22 + λ‖α‖1 + µ‖α−αx‖1 (VIII.45) where λ and µ are both constants. However, the value of αx is difficult to directly evaluate. Because many nonlocal similar patches are associated with the given image patch i, clustering these patches via block matching is advisable and the sparse code of searching similar patch l to patch i in cluster Ωi, denoted by αil, can be computed. Moreover, the unbiased estimation of αx, denoted by E[αx], empirically can be approximate to αx under some prior knowledge [181], and then SCN algorithm employs the nonlocal means estimation method [183] to evaluate the unbiased estimation of αx, that is, using the weighted average of all αil to approach E[αx], i.e.\nθi = ∑\nl∈Ωi wilαil (VIII.46)\nwhere wil = exp ( −‖xi − xil‖22/h ) /N , xi = Dαi, xil = Dαil, N is a normalization parameter and h is a constant. Thus, the objective function VIII.45 can be rewritten as\nαy = argmin α\n‖y −HDα‖22 + λ‖α‖1 + µ M∑\ni=1 ‖αi − θi‖1 (VIII.47)\nwhere M is the number of the separated patches. In the j-th iteration, the solution of problem VIII.47 is iteratively performed by\nαj+1y = argmin α\n‖y −HDα‖22 + λ‖α‖1 + µ M∑\ni=1 ‖αi − θji ‖1 (VIII.48)\nIt is obvious that problem VIII.47 can be optimized by the augmented Lagrange multiplier method [184] or the iterative shrinkage algorithm in [185]. According to the maximum average posterior principle and the distribution of the sparse coefficients, the regularization parameter λ and constant µ can be adaptively determined by λ = 2 √ 2ρ2\nσi and µ = 2\n√ 2ρ2\nηi ,\nwhere ρ, σi and ηi are the standard deviations of the additive Gaussian noise, αi and the SCN signal, respectively. Moreover, in the process of image patches clustering for each given image patch, a local PCA dictionary is learned and employed to code each patch within its corresponding cluster. The main procedures of the CSR algorithm are summarized in Algorithm 16 and readers may refer to literature [181] for more details."

      "text" : "In addition to these effective applications in image processing, several other fields for sparse representation have been proposed and extensively studied in image classification and visual tracking. Since Wright et al. [20] proposed to employ sparse representation to perform robust face recognition, more and more researchers have been applying the sparse representation theory to the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition, especially in image classification and object tracking.\nAlgorithm 16. Centralized sparse representation for image restoration\nInitialization: Set x = y, initialize regularization parameter λ and µ, the number of training iteration T , t = 0, θ0 = 0. Step 1: Partition the degraded image into M overlapped patches. While t ≤ T do Step 2: For each image patch, update the corresponding dictionary for each cluster via k-means and PCA.

Step 6: t = t + 1 End While Output: Restored image x = Dαt+1y\nExperimental results have suggested that the sparse representation based classification method can somewhat overcome the challenging issues from illumination changes, random pixel corruption, large block occlusion or disguise.\nAs face recognition is a representative component of pattern recognition and computer vision applications, the applications of sparse representation in face recognition can sufficiently reveal the potential nature of sparse representation. The most representative sparse representation for face recognition has been presented in literature [18] and the general scheme of sparse representation based classification method is summarized in Algorithm 17. Suppose that there are n training samples, X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] from c classes. Let Xi denote the samples from the i-th class and the testing sample is y.\nAlgorithm 17. The scheme of sparse representation based classification method\nStep 1: Normalize all the samples to have unit l2-norm. Step 2: Exploit the linear combination of all the training samples to represent the test sample and the following l1-norm minimization problem is satisfied α∗ = argmin ‖α‖1 s.t. ‖y −Xα‖22 ≤ ε. Step 3: Compute the representation residual for each class ri = ‖y −Xiα∗i ‖22 where α∗i here denotes the representation coefficients vector associated with the i-th class. Step 4: Output the identity of the test sample y by judging\nlabel(y) = argmini(ri).\nNumerous sparse representation based classification methods have been proposed to improve the robustness, effectiveness and efficiency of face recognition. For example, Xu et al. [9] proposed a two-phase sparse representation based classification method, which exploited the l2-norm regularization rather than the l1-norm regularization to perform a coarse to fine sparse representation based classification, which was very efficient in comparison with the conventional l1norm regularization based sparse representation. Deng et al. [186] proposed an extended sparse representation method (ESRM) for improving the robustness of SRC by eliminating the variations in face recognition, such as disguise, occlusion, expression and illumination. Deng et al. [187] also proposed a framework of superposed sparse representation based classification, which emphasized the prototype and vari-\nation components from uncontrolled images. He et al. [188] proposed utilizing the maximum correntropy criterion named CESR embedding non-negative constraint and half-quadratic optimization to present a robust face recognition algorithm. Yang et al. [189] developed a new robust sparse coding (RSC) algorithm, which first obtained a sparsity-constrained regression model based on maximum likelihood estimation and exploited an iteratively reweighted regularized robust coding algorithm to solve the pre-proposed model. Some other sparse representation based image classification methods also have been developed. For example, Yang et al. [190] introduced an extension of the spatial pyramid matching (SPM) algorithm called ScSPM, which incorporated SIFT sparse representation into the spatial pyramid matching algorithm. Subsequently, Gao et al. [191] developed a kernel sparse representation with the SPM algorithm called KSRSPM, and then proposed another version of an improvement of the SPM called LScSPM [192], which integrated the Laplacian matrix with local features into the objective function of the sparse representation method. Kulkarni and Li [193] proposed a discriminative affine sparse codes method (DASC) on a learned affineinvariant feature dictionary from input images and exploited the AdaBoost-based classifier to perform image classification. Zhang et al. [194] proposed integrating the non-negative sparse coding, low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition (LR-Sc+SPM) method, which exploited non-negative sparse coding and SPM for achieving local features representation and employed low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition for sparse representation, for image classification. Recently, Zhang et al. [195] presented a low-rank sparse representation (LRSR) learning method, which preserved the sparsity and spatial consistency in each procedure of feature representation and jointly exploited local features from the same spatial proximal regions for image classification. Zhang et al. [196] developed a structured low-rank sparse representation (SLRSR) method for image classification, which constructed a discriminative dictionary in training terms and exploited low-rank matrix reconstruction for obtaining discriminative representations. Tao et al. [197] proposed a novel dimension reduction method based on the framework of rank preserving sparse learning, and then exploited the projected samples to make effective Kinect-based scene classification. Zhang et al. [198] proposed a discriminative tensor sparse coding (RTSC) method for robust image classification. Recently, low-rank based sparse representation became a popular topic such as non-negative low-rank and sparse graph [199]. Some sparse representation methods in face recognition can be found in a review [83] and other more image classification methods can be found in a more recent review [200].\nMei et al. employed the idea of sparse representation to visual tracking [201] and vehicle classification [202], which introduced nonnegative sparse constraints and dynamic template updating strategy. It, in the context of the particle filter framework, exploited the sparse technique to guarantee that each target candidate could be sparsely represented using the linear combinations of fewest targets and particle templates. It also demonstrated that sparse representation can be propagated to address object tracking problems. Extensive sparse\nrepresentation methods have been proposed to address the visual tracking problem. In order to design an accelerated algorithm for l1 tracker, Li et al. [203] proposed two realtime compressive sensing visual tracking algorithms based on sparse representation, which adopted dimension reduction and the OMP algorithm to improve the efficiency of recovery procedure in tracking, and also developed a modified version of fusing background templates into the tracking procedure for robust object tracking. Zhang et al. [204] directly treated object tracking as a pattern recognition problem by regarding all the targets as training samples, and then employed the sparse representation classification method to do effective object tracking. Zhang et al. [205] employed the concept of sparse representation based on a particle filter framework to construct a multi-task sparse learning method denoted as multi-task tracking for robust visual tracking. Additionally, because of the discriminative sparse representation between the target and the background, Jia et al. [206] conceived a structural local sparse appearance model for robust object tracking by integrating the partial and spatial information from the target based on an alignment-pooling algorithm. Liu et al. [207] proposed constructing a two-stage sparse optimization based online visual tracking method, which jointly minimized the objective reconstruction error and maximized the discriminative capability by choosing distinguishable features. Liu et al. [208] introduced a local sparse appearance model (SPT) with a static sparse dictionary learned from k-selection and dynamic updated basis distribution to eliminate potential drifting problems in the process of visual tracking. Bao et al. [209] developed a fast real time l1-tracker called the APG-l1tracker, which exploited the accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to improve the l1-tracker solver in [201]. Zhong et al. [210] addressed the object tracking problem by developing a sparsitybased collaborative model, which combined a sparsity-based classifier learned from holistic templates and a sparsity-based template model generated from local representations. Zhang et al. [211] proposed to formulate a sparse feature measurement matrix based on an appearance model by exploiting nonadaptive random projections, and employed a coarse-to-fine strategy to accelerate the computational efficiency of tracking task. Lu et al. [212] proposed to employ both non-local selfsimilarity and sparse representation to develop a non-local selfsimilarity regularized sparse representation method based on geometrical structure information of the target template data set. Wang et al. [213] proposed a sparse representation based online two-stage tracking algorithm, which learned a linear classifier based on local sparse representation on favorable image patches. More detailed visual tracking algorithms can be found in the recent reviews [214, 215]."

      "heading" : "IX. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION",
      "text" : "In this section, we take the object categorization problem as an example to evaluate the performance of different sparse representation based classification methods. We analyze and compare the performance of sparse representation with the most typical algorithms: OMP [36], l1 ls [76], PALM [89], FISTA [82], DALM [89], homotopy [99] and TPTSR [9].\nPlenties of data sets have been collected for object categorization, especially for image classification. Several image data sets are used in our experimental evaluations.\nORL: The ORL database includes 400 face images taken from 40 subjects each providing 10 face images [216]. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, with varying lighting, facial expressions, and facial details. All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement). Each image was resized to a 56×46 image matrix by using the down-sampling algorithm.\nLFW face dataset: The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) face database is designed for the study of unconstrained identity verification and face recognition [217]. It contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web under the unconstrained conditions. Each face has been labeled with the name of the people pictured. 1680 of the people\npictured have two or more distinct photos in the database. In our experiments, we chose 1251 images from 86 peoples and each subject has 10-20 images [218]. Each image was manually cropped and was resized to 32×32 pixels.\nExtended YaleB face dataset: The extended YaleB database contains 2432 front face images of 38 individuals and each subject having around 64 near frontal images under different illuminations [219]. The main challenge of this database is to overcome varying illumination conditions and expressions. The facial portion of each original image was cropped to a 192×168 image. All images in this data set for our experiments simply resized these face images to 32×32 pixels.\nCOIL20 dataset: Columbia Object Image Library (COIL20) database consists of 1,440 size normalized gray-scale images of 20 objects [220]. Different object images are captured at every angle in a 360 rotation. Images of the objects were taken from varying angles at pose intervals of five degrees and\neach object has 72 images. Fifteen scene dataset: This dataset contains 4485 images under 15 natural scene categories presented in literature [221] and each category includes 210 to 410 images. The 15 scenes categories are office, kitchen, living room, bedroom, store, industrial, tall building, inside cite, street, highway, coast, open country, mountain, forest and suburb. A wide range of outdoor and indoor scenes are included in this dataset. The average image size is around 250×300 pixels and the spatial pyramid matching features are used in our experiments."

      "heading" : "A. Parameter selection",
      "text" : "Parameter selection, especially selection of the regularization parameter λ in different minimization problems, plays an important role in sparse representation. In order to make fair comparisons with different sparse representation algorithms, performing the optimal parameter selection for different sparse representation algorithms on different datasets is advisable and indispensable. In this subsection, we perform extensive experiments for selecting the best value of the regularization parameter λ with a wide range of options. Specifically, we implement the l1 ls, FISTA, DALM, homotopy and TPTSR algorithms on different databases to analyze the importance of the regularization parameter. Fig. 5 summarizes the classification accuracies of exploiting different sparse representation based classification methods with varying values of regularization parameter λ on the two face datasets, i.e. ORL and LFW face datasets, and two object datasets, i.e. COIL20 and Fifteen scene datasets. On the ORL and LFW face datasets, we respectively selected the first five and eight face images of each subject as training samples and the rest of image samples for testing. As for the experiments on the COIL20 and fifteen scene datasets, we respectively treated the first ten images of each subject in both datasets as training samples and used all the remaining images as test samples. Moreover, from Fig. 5, one can see that the value of regularization parameter λ can significantly dominate the classification results, and the values of λ for achieving the best classification results on different datasets are distinctly different. An interesting scenario is that the performance of the TPTSR algorithm is almost not influenced by the variation of regularization parameter λ in the experiments on fifteen scene dataset, as shown in Fig. 5(d). However, the best classification accuracy can be always obtained within the range of 0.0001 to 1. Thus, the value of the regularization parameter is set within the range from 0.0001 to 1."

      "heading" : "B. Experimental results",
      "text" : "In order to test the performance of different kinds of sparse representation methods, an empirical study of experimental results is conducted in this subsection and seven typical sparse representation based classification methods are selected for performance evaluation followed with extensive experimental results. For all datasets, following most previous published work, we randomly choose several samples of every class as training samples and used the rest as test samples and\nthe experiments are repeated 10 times with the optimal parameter obtained using the cross validation approach. The gray-level features of all images in these data sets are used to perform classification. For the sake of computational efficiency, principle component analysis algorithm is used as a preprocessing step to preserve 98% energy of all the data sets. The classification results and computational time have been summarized in Table I. From the experimental results on different databases, we can conclude that there still does not exist one extraordinary algorithm that can achieve the best classification accuracy on all databases. However, some algorithms are noteworthy to be paid much more attention. For example, the l1 ls algorithm in most cases can achieve better classification results than the other algorithms on the ORL database, and when the number of training samples of each class is five, the l1 ls algorithm can obtain the highest classification result of 95.90%. The TPTSR algorithm is very computationally efficient in comparison with other sparse representation with l1-norm minimization algorithms and the classification accuracies obtained by the TPTSR algorithm are very similar and sometimes even better than the other sparse representation based classification algorithms.\nThe computational time is another indicator for measuring the performance of one specific algorithm. As shown in Table I, the average computational time of each algorithm is shown at the bottom of the table for one specific number of training samples. Note that the computational time of OMP and TPTSR algorithms are drastically lower than that of other sparse representation with l1-norm minimization algorithms. This is mainly because the sparse representation with l1norm minimization algorithms always iteratively solve the l1norm minimization problem. However, the OMP and TPTSR algorithms both exploit the fast and efficient least squares technique, which guarantees that the computational time is significantly less than other l1-norm based sparse representation algorithms."

      "heading" : "C. Discussion",
      "text" : "Lots of sparse representation methods have been available in past decades and this paper introduces various sparse representation methods from some viewpoints, including their motivations, mathematical representations and the main algorithms. Based on the experimental results summarized in Section IX, we have the following observations.\nFirst, a challenging task of choosing a suitable regularization parameter for sparse representation should make further extensive studies. We can see that the value of the regularization parameter can remarkably influence the performance of the sparse representation algorithms and adjusting the parameters in sparse representation algorithms requires expensive labor. Moreover, adaptive parameter selection based sparse representation methods is preferable and very few methods have been proposed to solve this critical issue.\nSecond, although sparse representation algorithms have achieved distinctly promising performance on some real-world databases, many efforts should be made in promoting the accuracy of sparse representation based classification, and the\nrobustness of sparse representation should be further enhanced. In terms of the recognition accuracy, the algorithms of l1 ls, homotopy and TPTSR achieve the best overall performance. Considering the experimental results of exploiting the seven algorithms on the five databases, the l1 ls algorithm has eight highest classification accuracies, followed by homotopy and TPTSR, in comparison with other algorithms. One can see that the sparse representation based classification methods still can not obtain satisfactory results on some challenge databases. For example, all these representative algorithms can achieve relatively inferior experimental results on the LFW dataset shown in Subsection IX-B, because the LFW dataset is designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition [217] and most of the face images are captured under complex environments. One can see that the PALM algorithm has the worst classification accuracy on the LFW dataset and the classification accuracy even decreases mostly with the increase of the number of the training samples. Thus, devising more robust sparse representation algorithm is an urgent issue.\nThird, enough attention should be paid on the computational inefficiency of sparse representation with l1-norm minimization. One can see that high computational complexity is one of the most major drawbacks of the current sparse representation methods and also hampers its applications in real-time processing scenarios. In terms of speed, PALM, FISTA and DALM take much longer time to converge than the other methods. The\naverage computational time of OMP and TPTSR is the two lowest algorithms. Moreover, compared with the l1-regularized sparse representation based classification methods, the TPTSR has very competitive classification accuracy but significantly low complexity. Efficient and effective sparse representation methods are urgently needed by real-time applications. Thus, developing more efficient and effective methods is essential for future study on sparse representation.\nFinally, the extensive experimental results have demonstrated that there is no absolute winner that can achieve the best performance for all datasets in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. However, l1 ls, TPTSR and homotopy algorithms as a whole outperform the other algorithms. As a compromising approach, the OMP algorithm can achieve distinct efficiency without sacrificing much recognition rate in comparison with other algorithms and it also has been extensively applied to some complex learning algorithms as a function."

      "heading" : "X. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "Sparse representation has been extensively studied in recent years. This paper summarizes and presents various available sparse representation methods and discusses their motivations, mathematical representations and extensive applications. More specifically, we have analyzed their relations in theory and empirically introduced the applications including dictionary\nlearning based on sparse representation and real-world applications such as image processing, image classification, and visual tracking.\nSparse representation has become a fundamental tool, which has been embedded into various learning systems and also has received dramatic improvements and unprecedented achievements. Furthermore, dictionary learning is an extremely popular topic and is closely connected with sparse representation. Currently, efficient sparse representation, robust sparse representation, and dictionary learning based on sparse representation seem to be the main streams of research on sparse representation methods. The low-rank representation technique has also recently aroused intensive research interests and sparse representation has been integrated into low-rank representation for constructing more reliable representation models. However, the mathematical justification of low-rank representation seems not to be elegant as sparse representation. Because employing the ideas of sparse representation as a prior can lead to state-of-the-art results, incorporating sparse representation with low-rank representation is worth further research. Moreover, subspace learning also has been becoming one of the most prevailing techniques in pattern recognition and computer vision. It is necessary to further study the relationship between sparse representation and subspace learning, and constructing more compact models for sparse subspace learning becomes one of the popular topics in various research fields. The transfer learning technique has emerged as a new learning framework for classification, regression and clustering problems in data mining and machine learning. However, sparse representation research still has been not fully applied to the transfer learning framework and it is significant to unify the sparse representation and low-rank representation techniques into the transfer learning framework to solve domain adaption, multitask learning, sample selection bias and covariate shift problems. Furthermore, researches on deep learning seems to become an overwhelming trend in the computer vision field. However, dramatically expensive training effort is the main limitation of current deep learning technique and how to fully introduce current sparse representation methods into the framework of deep learning is valuable and unsolved.\nThe application scope of sparse representation has emerged and has been widely extended to machine learning and computer vision fields. Nevertheless, the effectiveness and efficiency of sparse representation methods cannot perfectly meet the need for real-world applications. Especially, the complexities of sparse representation have greatly affected the applicability, especially the applicability to large scale problems. Enhancing the robustness of sparse representation is considered as another indispensable problem when researchers design algorithms. For image classification, the robustness should be seriously considered, such as the robustness to random corruptions, varying illuminations, outliers, occlusion and complex backgrounds. Thus, developing an efficient and robust sparse representation method for sparse representation is still the main challenge and to design a more effective dictionary is being expected and is beneficial to the performance improvement.\nSparse representation still has wide potential for various\npossible applications, such as event detection, scene reconstruction, video tracking, object recognition, object pose estimation, medical image processing, genetic expression and natural language processing. For example, the study of sparse representation in visual tracking is an important direction and more depth studies are essential to future further improvements of visual tracking research.\nIn addition, most sparse representation and dictionary learning algorithms focus on employing the l0-norm or l1-norm regularization to obtain a sparse solution. However, there are still only a few studies on l2,1-norm regularization based sparse representation and dictionary learning algorithms. Moreover, other extended studies of sparse representation may be fruitful. In summary, the recent prevalence of sparse representation has extensively influenced different fields. It is our hope that the review and analysis presented in this paper can help and motivate more researchers to propose perfect sparse representation methods."

Sparse representation also has a good reputation in both theoretical research and practical applications. Many different algorithms have been proposed for sparse representation. The main purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive study and an updated review on sparse representation and to supply a guidance for researchers. The taxonomy of sparse representation methods can be studied from various viewpoints. For example, in terms of different norm minimizations used in sparsity constraints, the methods can be roughly categorized into five groups: sparse representation with l0-norm minimization, sparse representation with lp-norm (0<p<1) minimization, sparse representation with l1-norm minimization and sparse representation with l2,1-norm minimization. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of sparse representation is provided. The available sparse representation algorithms can also be empirically categorized into four groups: greedy strategy approximation, constrained optimization, proximity algorithmbased optimization, and homotopy algorithm-based sparse representation. The rationales of different algorithms in each category are analyzed and a wide range of sparse representation applications are summarized, which could sufficiently reveal the potential nature of the sparse representation theory. Specifically, an experimentally comparative study of these sparse representation algorithms was presented. The Matlab code used in this paper can be available at: http://www.yongxu.org/lunwen.html.",
