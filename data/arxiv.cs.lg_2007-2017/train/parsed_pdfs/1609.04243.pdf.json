      "text" : "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been actively used for various music classification tasks such as music tagging [1, 2], genre classification [3, 4], and user-item latent feature prediction for recommendation [5].\nCNNs assume features that are in different levels of hierarchy and can be extracted by convolutional kernels. The hierarchical features are learned to achieve a given task during supervised training. For example, learned features from a CNN that is trained for genre classification exhibit low-level features (e.g., onset) to high-level features (e.g., percussive instrument patterns) [6].\nRecently, CNNs have been combined with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are often used to model temporal data such as audio signals or word sequences. This hybrid model is called a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). A CRNN can be described as a modified CNN by replacing the last convolutional layers with a RNN. In\n∗This work has been part funded by FAST IMPACt EPSRC Grant EP/L019981/1 and the European Commission H2020 research and innovation grant AudioCommons (688382).

Adopting an RNN for aggregating the features enables the networks to take the global structure into account while local features are extracted by the remaining convolutional layers. This structure was first proposed in [7] for document classification and later applied to image classification [8] and music transcription [9].\nCRNNs fit the music tagging task well. First, RNNs are more flexible in selecting how to summarise the local features than CNNs which are rather static by using weighted average (convolution) and subsampling. This flexibility can be helpful because some of the tags (e.g., mood tags) may be affected by the global structure while other tags such as instruments can be affected by local and short-segment information. Second, RNNs can effectively deal with variable length of music signal, while CNNs expect a fixed input size.\nIn this paper, we introduce CRNNs for music tagging. We compare the proposed CRNN with two existing CNNs. For correct comparisons, we carefully control the hardware, data, and optimisation techniques, while varying two attributes of the structure: i) the number of parameters and ii) computation time. In other words, the representation power of the structures is evaluated with respect to memory usage and computation complexity."

For all networks, the input is assumed to be of size 96×1366 (mel-frequency band×time frame). Sigmoid functions are used as activation at output nodes because music tagging is a multi-label classification task.\nFor a correct comparison, it is necessary to equip the networks with identical optimisation techniques since they greatly improve the performances of networks having essentially the same structure. For example, techniques such as batch normalization (BN) [10] and exponential linear unit (ELU) [11] improve both training speed and accuracy by nudging the distribution of the outputs of intermediate layers to be standardised without changing the structure.\nIn this paper, therefore, all the convolutional and fully-\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n04 24\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.N E\n] 1\n4 Se\np 20\nconnected layers are equipped with identical optimisation techniques and activation functions – a dropout of 0.5 [12], batch normalization [10], and ELU activation function [11]."

      "text" : "Conv1D in Figure 1a is motivated by structures for music tagging [1] and genre classification [13]. The network consists of 4 convolutional layers that are followed by 2 fully-connected layers. One-dimensional convolutional layers (1×8 for all, i.e., convolution along time-axis) and maxpooling layers ((1×4)-(1×5)-(1×8)-(1×8)) alternate, and resulting in narrow-and-tall feature maps. They are flattened and fed into a fully-connected layer, which acts as the classifier.\nThis model relies on the assumption of non-stationarity along the frequency axis of music spectrograms. It preserves the frequency band information until the end of convolutional layers. In other words, each element of the last feature map (the output of the 4-th sub-sampling layer) encodes a feature for each band.\nIn [1], 29s-long signal are trimmed into less than 4-sec subsegments, and then the final tag predictions are averaged. The author’s more recent work1 directly takes the whole 30slong signal as an input. We adopt the approach from the latter in this paper."

Conv2D consists of five convolutional layers of 3×3 kernels and max-pooling layers ((2×4)-(2×4)-(2×4)- (3×5)-(4×4)) as illustrated in Figure 1b. The network reduces the size of feature maps to 1×1 at the final layer, where each feature covers the whole input rather than each frequency band. Temporal information is also gradually aggregated during the size reduction.\nThis model assumes that there are two-dimensional patterns in the time-frequency plane. Also, using twodimensional subsampling enables the network to be fullyconvolutional, which ultimately results in fewer parameters.\n1http://benanne.github.io/2014/08/05/ spotify-cnns.html\nThis is because fully-connected layers are often responsible for large portion of the network’s parameters."

The assumption underlying this model is that the temporal pattern can be aggregated better with RNNs then CNNs, while relying on CNNs on input side for local feature extraction.\nThis structure is first proposed in [7] for document classification. In CRNN, RNNs are used to aggregate the temporal patterns instead of, for instance, averaging the results from shorter segments as in [1] or convolution and sub-sampling as in Conv2D. In its CNN sub-structure, the sizes of convolutional layers and max-pooling layers are 3×3 and (2×2)-(3×3)-(4×4)-(4×4). This sub-sampling results in a feature map size of N×1×15 (number of feature maps×frequency×time). They are then fed into a 2-layer RNN, of which the last hidden state is connected to the output of the network."

Considering the limitation of current hardware and the dataset size, 3M-parameter networks are presumed to provide an approximate upper bound of the structure complexity. Table 1 summarises the details of different structures including the layer width (the number of feature maps or hidden units).\nThe widths of layers are based on [1] for Conv1D and [2] for Conv2D. For CRNN, the widths are determined based on preliminary experiments which showed the relative importance of the numbers of the feature maps of convolutional layers over the number of hidden units in RNNs.\nLayer widths are changed to control the number of parameters of a network while the depths and the convolutional kernel shapes are kept constant. Therefore, the hierarchy of learned features is preserved while the numbers of the features in each hierarchical level (i.e., each layer) are changed. This is to maximise the representation capabilities of networks, considering the relative importance of depth over width [16]."

We train the networks to predict the top-50 tag, which includes genres (e.g., rock, pop), moods (e.g., sad, happy), instruments (e.g., female vocalist, guitar), and eras (60s – 00s). 214,284 (201,680 for training and 12,605 for validation) and 25,940 clips are selected by using the originally provided training/test splitting and filtering out items without any top50 tags. The occurrences of tags range from 52,944 (rock) to 1,257 (happy).\nWe use 30-60s preview clips which are provided after trimming to represent the highlight of the song. We trim audio signals to 29 seconds at the centre of preview clips and downsample them from 22.05 kHz to 12 kHz using Librosa [18]. Log-amplitude mel-spectrograms are used as input since they have outperformed STFT and MFCCs, and linear-amplitude mel-spectrograms in earlier research [2, 1]. The number of mel-bins is 96 and the hop-size is 256 samples, resulting in an input shape of 96×1366.\nThe model is built with Keras [19] and Theano [20]. We use ADAM for learning rate control [21] and binary crossentropy as a loss function. The reported performance is measured on test set and by AUC-ROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) given that tagging is a multilabel classification.\nWe use early-stopping for the all structures – the training is stopped if there is no improvement bigger than a threshold (0.002 AUC) on the validation set while iterating half of the training data. An exception is applied to 3M-networks, for which the threshold is set to 0 and iterating for the whole training data because the convergence rate per training samples is slower in more complex networks."

      "text" : "Figure 2 shows the AUCs for each network against the number of parameters. With the same number of parameters, the ranking of AUC is CRNN > Conv2D > Conv1D except for 3M-parameter structures. This indicates that CRNN can be preferred when the bottleneck is memory usage. For 3M-\nparameter structures, Conv2D outperforms CRNN while both of them outperform the state-of-the-art structure [2].\nCRNN outperforms Conv2D in all cases except when using 3M parameters. Because they share the same 2Dconvolutional layers, this difference is probably a consequence of the difference in RNNs and CNNs the ability of summarising the features over time. This may indicate that learning a global structure is more important than focusing on local structures for summarisation. One may focus on the different layer widths of two structures – because recurrent layers use less parameters than convolutional layers, CRNN has wider convolutional layers than Conv2D with same number of parameters. However, even CRNN with narrower layer widths (0.1M parameters) shows better performance than Conv2D with wider widths (0.25M and 0.5M parameters). With 3M parameters, CRNN suffers from slower convergence rate than Conv2D due to its deeper RNN structure. This results in a lower AUC for CRNN compared to Conv2D.\nConv2D shows higher AUCs than Conv1D in all cases. This shows that the model of Conv2D, which encodes local invariance and captures local time-frequency relationships, is more effective than Conv1D, which ignores local frequency relationships. Conv2D also uses parameters in a more flexible way with its fully-convolutional structure, while Conv1D allocates only a small proportion of the parameters to the feature extraction stage. For example, with 0.5M parameters, only 13% of the parameters are used by convolutional layers while the rest, 87%, are used by the fully-connected layers."

The computational complexity is directly related to the training and prediction time and varies depending not only on the number of parameters but also on the structure. The wall-clock training times for 2500 samples are summarised in Table 1 and plotted in Figure 2.\nWith similar training time, CRNN shows the best performance for training time < 150s. However, Conv2D with training time of 180s (3M parameters) outperforms CRNN with similar or longer training times (0.5M, 1M, and 3M parameters). This result indicates that either Conv2D or CRNN can be used depending on the target time budget.\nWith the same number of parameters, the ranking of training speed is always Conv2D > Conv1D > CRNN. In other words, speed is negatively correlated with the depths of the networks (5, 6, and 20, respectively)."

From the multiple-task classification perspective, this result indicates that a structure that outperforms in one of the four tasks may perform best in the other tasks as well.\nAlthough the dataset is imbalanced, the tag popularity (number of occurrence of each tag) is not correlated to the performance. Spearman rank correlation between tag popularity and the ranking of AUC scores of all tags is 0.077."

In the experiment, we controlled the size of the networks by varying the numbers of parameters to investigate two scenarios, memory-controlled and computation-controlled comparison. Our experiments revealed that Conv2D and CRNN perform comparably to each other with a large number of parameters. However, with a modest number of parameters, however, we observed an interesting trade-off between speed and memory. The feedforward pass of Conv2D is faster than that of CRNN across all parameter settings, while the CRNN tends to outperform Conv2D with the same number of parameters. Future work will investigate RNN-based structures and audio input requirements for deep learning approaches."

CRNNs take advantage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction and recurrent neural networks for temporal summarisation of the extracted features. We compare CRNN with two CNN structures that have been used for music tagging while controlling the number of parameters with respect to their performance and training time per sample. Overall, we found that CRNNs show strong performance with respect to the number of parameter and training time, indicating the effectiveness of its hybrid structure in music feature extraction and feature summarisation.",
