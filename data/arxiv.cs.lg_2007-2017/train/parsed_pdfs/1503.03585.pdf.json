Models that are tractable can be analytically evaluated and easily fit to data (e.g. a Gaussian or Laplace).

Copyright 2015 by the author(s).\nthese models are unable to aptly describe structure in rich datasets. On the other hand, models that are flexible can be molded to fit structure in arbitrary data. For example, we can define models in terms of any (non-negative) function φ(x) yielding the flexible distribution p (x) = φ(x)Z , where Z is a normalization constant. However, computing this normalization constant is generally intractable. Evaluating, training, or drawing samples from such flexible models typically requires a very expensive Monte Carlo process.\nA variety of analytic approximations exist which ameliorate, but do not remove, this tradeoff–for instance mean field theory and its expansions (T, 1982; Tanaka, 1998), variational Bayes (Jordan et al., 1999), contrastive divergence (Welling & Hinton, 2002; Hinton, 2002), minimum probability flow (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2011b;a), minimum KL contraction (Lyu, 2011), proper scoring rules (Gneiting & Raftery, 2007; Parry et al., 2012), score matching (Hyvärinen, 2005), pseudolikelihood (Besag, 1975), loopy belief propagation (Murphy et al., 1999), and many, many more. Non-parametric methods (Gershman & Blei, 2012) can also be very effective1."

We build a generative Markov chain which converts a simple known distribution (e.g. a Gaussian) into a target (data) distribution using a diffusion process. Rather than use this Markov chain to approximately evaluate a model which has been otherwise defined, we explicitly define the probabilistic model as the endpoint of the Markov chain. Since each step in the diffusion chain has an analytically evaluable probability, the full chain can also be analytically evaluated.\nLearning in this framework involves estimating small perturbations to a diffusion process. Estimating small perturbations is more tractable than explicitly describing the full distribution with a single, non-analytically-normalizable, potential function. Furthermore, since a diffusion process exists for any smooth target distribution, this method can capture data distributions of arbitrary form.\nWe demonstrate the utility of these diffusion probabilistic models by training high log likelihood models for a twodimensional swiss roll, binary sequence, handwritten digit (MNIST), and several natural image (CIFAR-10, bark, and dead leaves) datasets."

      "text" : "The wake-sleep algorithm (Hinton, 1995; Dayan et al., 1995) introduced the idea of training inference and generative probabilistic models against each other. This approach remained largely unexplored for nearly two decades, though with some exceptions (Sminchisescu et al., 2006; Kavukcuoglu et al., 2010). There has been a recent explosion of work developing this idea. In (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Gregor et al., 2013; Rezende et al., 2014; Ozair & Bengio, 2014) variational learning and inference algorithms were developed which allow a flexible generative model and posterior distribution over latent variables to be directly trained against each other.\nThe variational bound in these papers is similar to the one used in our training objective and in the earlier work of (Sminchisescu et al., 2006). However, our motivation and model form are both quite different, and the present work retains the following differences and advantages relative to these techniques:\n1. We develop our framework using ideas from physics, quasi-static processes, and annealed importance sampling rather than from variational Bayesian methods.\n2. We show how to easily multiply the learned distribution with another probability distribution (eg with a conditional distribution in order to compute a posterior)\n3. We address the difficulty that training the inference model can prove particularly challenging in variational inference methods, due to the asymmetry in the objective between the inference and generative models. We restrict the forward (inference) process to a simple functional form, in such a way that the reverse (generative) process will have the same functional form.\n4. We train models with thousands of layers (or time steps), rather than only a handful of layers.\n5. We provide upper and lower bounds on the entropy production in each layer (or time step)\nThere are a number of related techniques for training probabilistic models (summarized below) that develop highly flexible forms for generative models, train stochastic trajectories, or learn the reversal of a Bayesian network. Reweighted wake-sleep (Bornschein & Bengio, 2015) develops extensions and improved learning rules for the original wake-sleep algorithm. Generative stochastic networks (Bengio & Thibodeau-Laufer, 2013; Yao et al., 2014) train a Markov kernel to match its equilibrium distribution to the data distribution. Neural autoregressive distribution estimators (Larochelle & Murray, 2011) (and their recurrent (Uria et al., 2013a) and deep (Uria et al., 2013b) extensions) decompose a joint distribution into a sequence of tractable conditional distributions over each dimension. Adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) train a generative model against a classifier which attempts to distinguish generated samples from true data. A similar objective in (Schmidhuber, 1992) learns a two-way mapping to a representation with marginally independent units. In (Rippel & Adams, 2013; Dinh et al., 2014) bijective deterministic maps are learned to a latent representation with a simple factorial density function. In (Stuhlmüller et al., 2013) stochastic inverses are learned for Bayesian networks. Mixtures of conditional Gaussian scale mixtures (MCGSMs) (Theis et al., 2012) describe a dataset using Gaussian scale mixtures, with parameters which depend on a sequence of causal neighborhoods. There is additionally significant work learning flexible generative mappings from simple latent distributions to data distributions – early examples including (MacKay, 1995) where neural networks are introduced as generative models, and (Bishop et al., 1998) where a stochastic manifold mapping is learned from a latent space to the data space. We will compare experimentally against adversarial networks and MCGSMs.\nRelated ideas from physics include the Jarzynski equality (Jarzynski, 1997), known in machine learning as An-\nt = 0 t = T2 t = T\nq ( x(0···T ) ) 2 0 2 2 0\n2\n2 0 2 2\n0\n2\n2 0 2 2\n0\n2\np ( x(0···T ) ) 2 0 2 2 0\n2\n2 0 2 2\n0\n2\n2 0 2 2\n0\n2\nfµ ( x(t), t ) − x(t)\nFigure 1.

In (Burda et al., 2014) it is shown that AIS can also be performed using the reverse rather than forward trajectory. Langevin dynamics (Langevin, 1908), which are the stochastic realization of the Fokker-Planck equation, show how to define a Gaussian diffusion process which has any target distribution as its equilibrium. In (Suykens & Vandewalle, 1995) the Fokker-Planck equation is used to perform stochastic optimization. Finally, the Kolmogorov forward and backward equations (Feller, 1949) show that for many forward diffusion processes, the reverse diffusion processes can be described using the same functional form."

(5)\nFor both Gaussian and binomial diffusion, for continuous diffusion (limit of small step size β) the reversal of the diffusion process has the identical functional form as the forward process (Feller, 1949). Since q ( x(t)|x(t−1) ) is a Gaussian (binomial) distribution, and if βt is small, then q ( x(t−1)|x(t) ) will also be a Gaussian (binomial) distribution. The longer the trajectory the smaller the diffusion rate β can be made.\nDuring learning only the mean and covariance for a Gaussian diffusion kernel, or the bit flip probability for a binomial kernel, need be estimated. As shown in Table App.1, fµ ( x(t), t ) and fΣ ( x(t), t ) are functions defining the mean and covariance of the reverse Markov transitions for a Gaussian, and fb ( x(t), t ) is a function providing the bit flip probability for a binomial distribution. The computational cost of running this algorithm is the cost of these functions, times the number of time-steps. For all results in this paper, multi-layer perceptrons are used to define these functions. A wide range of regression or function fitting techniques would be applicable however, including nonparameteric methods."

The derivation of this bound parallels the derivation of the log likelihood bound in variational Bayesian methods.\nAs in Section 2.3 if the forward and reverse trajectories are identical, corresponding to a quasi-static process, then the inequality in Equation 13 becomes an equality.\nTraining consists of finding the reverse Markov transitions which maximize this lower bound on the log likelihood,\np̂ ( x(t−1)|x(t) ) = argmax p(x(t−1)|x(t)) K. (15)\nThe specific targets of estimation for Gaussian and binomial diffusion are given in Table App.1.\nThus, the task of estimating a probability distribution has been reduced to the task of performing regression on the functions which set the mean and covariance of a sequence of Gaussians (or set the state flip probability for a sequence of Bernoulli trials).\n2.4.1. SETTING THE DIFFUSION RATE βt\nThe choice of βt in the forward trajectory is important for the performance of the trained model. In AIS, the right schedule of intermediate distributions can greatly improve the accuracy of the log partition function estimate (Grosse et al., 2013). In thermodynamics the schedule taken when moving between equilibrium distributions determines how much free energy is lost (Spinney & Ford, 2013; Jarzynski, 2011).\nIn the case of Gaussian diffusion, we learn2 the forward diffusion schedule β2···T by gradient ascent on K. The variance β1 of the first step is fixed to a small constant to prevent overfitting. The dependence of samples from q ( x(1···T )|x(0) ) on β1···T is made explicit by using ‘frozen noise’ – as in (Kingma & Welling, 2013) the noise is treated as an additional auxiliary variable, and held constant while computing partial derivatives of K with respect to the parameters.\nFor binomial diffusion, the discrete state space makes gradient ascent with frozen noise impossible. We instead choose the forward diffusion schedule β1···T to erase a constant fraction 1T of the original signal per diffusion step, yielding a diffusion rate of βt = (T − t+ 1)−1."

The core of our algorithm consists of estimating the reversal of a Markov diffusion chain which maps data to a noise distribution; as\nthe number of steps is made large, the reversal distribution of each diffusion step becomes simple and easy to estimate. The result is an algorithm that can learn a fit to any data distribution, but which remains tractable to train, exactly sample from, and evaluate, and under which it is straightforward to manipulate conditional and posterior distributions."

This holds without qualification for the binomial distribution, and holds for variance 1 training data for the Gaussian case. For the Gaussian case, training data must therefore be scaled to have unit norm for the following equalities to hold. It need not be whitened. The upper bound is derived as follows,\nHq\n( X(t) ) ≥ Hq ( X(t−1) ) (28)\nHq\n( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) ≤ 0 (29)\nHq\n( X(t−1)|X(t) ) ≤ Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) . (30)\nA lower bound on the entropy difference can be established by observing that additional steps in a Markov chain do not increase the information available about the initial state in the chain, and thus do not decrease the conditional entropy of the initial state,\nHq\n( X(0)|X(t) ) ≥ Hq ( X(0)|X(t−1) ) (31)\nHq\n( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) ≥ Hq ( X(0)|X(t−1) ) +Hq ( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(0)|X(t) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) (32)\nHq\n( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) ≥ Hq ( X(0),X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(0),X(t) ) (33)\nHq\n( X(t−1) ) −Hq ( X(t) ) ≥ Hq ( X(t−1)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(t)|X(0) ) (34)\nHq\n( X(t−1)|X(t) ) ≥ Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) +Hq ( X(t−1)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(t)|X(0) ) . (35)\nCombining these expressions, we bound the conditional entropy for a single step,\nHq\n( X(t)|X(t−1) ) ≥ Hq ( X(t−1)|X(t) ) ≥ Hq ( X(t)|X(t−1) ) +Hq ( X(t−1)|X(0) ) −Hq ( X(t)|X(0) ) , (36)\nwhere both the upper and lower bounds depend only on the conditional forward trajectory q ( x(1···T )|x(0) ) , and can be analytically computed."

Remove the edge effect at t = 0\nIn order to avoid edge effects, we set the final step of the reverse trajectory to be identical to the corresponding forward diffusion step,\np ( x(0)|x(1) ) = q ( x(1)|x(0) ) π (x(0)) π ( x(1) ) = Tπ (x(0)|x(1);β1) .

Rewrite in terms of posterior q ( x(t−1)|x(0)\n) Because the forward trajectory is a Markov process,\nK = T∑ t=2 ∫ dx(0···T )q ( x(0···T ) ) log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t) ) q ( x(t)|x(t−1),x(0) )]−Hp (X(T )) . (47) Using Bayes’ rule we can rewrite this in terms of a posterior and marginals from the forward trajectory,\nK = T∑ t=2 ∫ dx(0···T )q ( x(0···T ) ) log [ p ( x(t−1)|x(t) ) q ( x(t−1)|x(t),x(0) ) q (x(t−1)|x(0)) q ( x(t)|x(0) ) ]−Hp (X(T )) .

Note that unlike many MNIST sample figures, these are true samples rather than the mean of the Gaussian or binomial distribution from which samples would be drawn.\nB.4.

      "text" : "D.1. Toy Problems\nD.1.1. SWISS ROLL\nA probabilistic model was built of a two dimensional swiss roll distribution. The generative model p ( x(0···T ) ) consisted of 40 time steps of Gaussian diffusion initialized at an identity-covariance Gaussian distribution. A (normalized) radial basis function network with a single hidden layer and 16 hidden units was trained to generate the mean and covariance functions fµ ( x(t), t ) and a diago-\nnal fΣ ( x(t), t ) for the reverse trajectory. The top, readout, layer for each function was learned independently for each time step, but for all other layers weights were shared across all time steps and both functions. The top layer output of fΣ ( x(t), t ) was passed through a sigmoid to restrict it between 0 and 1. As can be seen in Figure 1, the swiss roll distribution was successfully learned.\nD.1.2. BINARY HEARTBEAT DISTRIBUTION\nA probabilistic model was trained on simple binary sequences of length 20, where a 1 occurs every 5th time bin, and the remainder of the bins are 0. The generative model consisted of 2000 time steps of binomial diffusion initialized at an independent binomial distribution with the same mean activity as the data (p ( x\n(T ) i = 1\n) = 0.2). A\nmultilayer perceptron with sigmoid nonlinearities, 20 input units and three hidden layers with 50 units each was trained to generate the Bernoulli rates fb ( x(t), t ) of the reverse trajectory. The top, readout, layer was learned independently for each time step, but for all other layers weights were shared across all time steps. The top layer output was passed through a sigmoid to restrict it between 0 and 1. As can be seen in Figure 2, the heartbeat distribution was successfully learned. The log likelihood under the true generating process is log2 ( 1 5 ) = −2.322 bits per sequence. As can be seen in Figure 2 and Table 1 learning was nearly perfect.\nD.2. Images\nD.2.1. ARCHITECTURE\nReadout In all cases, a convolutional network was used to produce a vector of outputs yi ∈ R2J for each image pixel i. The entries in yi are divided into two equal sized subsets, yµ and yΣ.\nTemporal Dependence The convolution output yµ is used as per-pixel weighting coefficients in a sum over timedependent “bump” functions, generating an output zµi ∈ R\nfor each pixel i,\nzµi = J∑ j=1 yµijgj (t) . (62)\nThe bump functions consist of\ngj (t) = exp\n( − 12w2 (t− τj) 2 )\n∑J k=1 exp ( − 12w2 (t− τk) 2 ) , (63)\nwhere τj ∈ (0, T ) is the bump center, and w is the spacing between bump centers. zΣ is generated in an identical way, but using yΣ.\nFor all image experiments a number of timesteps T = 1000 was used, except for the bark dataset which used T = 500.\nMean and Variance Finally, these outputs are combined to produce a diffusion mean and variance prediction for each pixel i,\nΣii = σ ( zΣi + σ −1 (βt) ) , (64)\nµi = (xi − zµi ) (1− Σii) + z µ i . (65)\nwhere both Σ and µ are parameterized as a perturbation around the forward diffusion kernel Tπ ( x(t)|x(t−1);βt ) , and zµi is the mean of the equilibrium distribution that would result from applying p ( x(t−1)|x(t) ) many times. Σ is restricted to be a diagonal matrix.\nMulti-Scale Convolution We wish to accomplish goals that are often achieved with pooling networks – specifically, we wish to discover and make use of long-range and multi-scale dependencies in the training data. However, since the network output is a vector of coefficients for every pixel it is important to generate a full resolution rather than down-sampled feature map. We therefore define multi-scale-convolution layers that consist of the following steps:\n1. Perform mean pooling to downsample the image to multiple scales. Downsampling is performed in powers of two.\n2. Performing convolution at each scale. 3. Upsample all scales to full resolution, and sum the re-\nsulting images. 4. Perform a pointwise nonlinear transformation, con-\nsisting of a soft relu (log [1 + exp (·)]).\nThe composition of the first three linear operations resembles convolution by a multiscale convolution kernel, up to blocking artifacts introduced by upsampling. This method of achieving multiscale convolution was described in (Barron et al., 2013).\nInput\nDense Multi-scaleconvolution\nConvolution 1x1 kernel\nTemporal coefficients Temporal coefficients\nDense Multi-scaleconvolution\nMean image\nCovariance image\nConvolution 1x1 kernel\nFigure D.1. Network architecture for mean function fµ ( x(t), t )\nand covariance function fΣ\n(\nx(t), t\n)\n, for experiments in Section\n3.2. The input image x(t) passes through several layers of multiscale convolution (Section D.2.1). It then passes through several convolutional layers with 1 × 1 kernels. This is equivalent to a dense transformation performed on each pixel. A linear transformation generates coefficients for readout of both mean µ(t) and covariance Σ(t) for each pixel. Finally, a time dependent readout function converts those coefficients into mean and covariance images, as described in Section D.2.1. For CIFAR-10 a dense (or fully connected) pathway was used in parallel to the multi-scale convolutional pathway. For MNIST, the dense pathway was used to the exclusion of the multi-scale convolutional pathway.\nDense Layers Dense (acting on the full image vector) and kernel-width-1 convolutional (acting separately on the feature vector for each pixel) layers share the same form. They consist of a linear transformation, followed by a tanh nonlinearity."

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.",
