      "text" : "We consider the university course timetabling problem, which is one of the most studied problems in educational timetabling. In particular, we focus our attention on the formulation known as curriculumbased course timetabling problem (CB-CTT), which has been tackled by many researchers and has many available benchmarks.\nThe contributions of this paper are twofold. On the one side, we propose an effective and robust single-stage simulated annealing search method for solving the problem. On the other side, we design and apply an extensive and statistically-principled analysis methodology for the algorithm parameter tuning procedure. The outcome of this analysis is a linear regression model between instance features and search method parameters, that allows us to set the parameters for unseen instances on the basis of a simple inspection of the instance itself. Using this method, our algorithm, despite its apparent simplicity, has been able to achieve very good experimental results on a set of popular benchmark testbeds.\nar X\niv :1\n40 9.\n71 86\nFinally, we propose many new, real-world instances, that could be used as ground for future comparisons.\nKeywords: Course Timetabling, Simulated Annealing, Metaheuristics, Feature Analysis, Parameter Tuning"

      "text" : "Designing the timetable for the courses is a typical problem that universities have to face every term or semester. There exists a large number of variants of this problem, depending on the specific requirements of the institution involved (see, e.g., Kingston, 2013; Lewis, 2008; Schaerf, 1999).\nThanks mainly to the international timetabling competitions ITC-2002 and ITC-2007 (McCollum et al., 2010), two formulations have, to some extent, lifted up to the status of “standard”. These are the so-called PostEnrolment Course Timetabling (PE-CTT) (Lewis et al., 2007) and CurriculumBased Course Timetabling (CB-CTT) (Di Gaspero et al., 2007). These two formulations have received attention in the research community, so that many recent articles deal with either one of them.\nThe distinguishing difference between the two formulations is the origin of conflicts between courses, which is based on student enrolment, in one case, and on predefined curricula, in the other. This is however only one of the differences, which actually include also many other distinctive features and cost components. For example, in the PE-CTT, each course is a selfstanding event, whereas in CB-CTT a course consists of multiple lectures. Consequently, the soft constraints are different: in PE-CTT they are all related to events, penalizing late, consecutive, and isolated ones; in CBCTT they mainly involve curricula and courses, ensuring compactness in a curriculum, trying to evenly spread the lectures of a course in the weekdays, and possibly preserving the same room for a course.\nIn this work we focus on CB-CTT, and we build upon our previous work on this problem (Bellio et al., 2012). The key ingredients of our method are, on the one side, a fast single-stage Simulated Annealing (SA) method, and, on the other side, a comprehensive statistical analysis methodology and a principled parameter tuning phase. The result of the analysis is that we have been able to find a linear regression model between the most relevant parameters of the solver and the features of the problem instance under\nconsideration. Thanks to this linear regression model, we are able to predict the ideal parameter setting for each instance. The adequacy of this method is confirmed by the experimental results on unseen instances. Indeed, we show that our method compares favorably with all the state of the art methods on the available testbed instances. Finally, we propose many new real-world instances that will be added to the set of benchmarks to be used also by other researchers, and thus included in future comparison."

Alternative formulations are described in (Bonutti et al., 2012).\nThe problem consists of the following entities:\nDays, Timeslots, and Periods. We are given a number of teaching days in the week. Each day is split in a fixed number of timeslots. A period is a pair composed of a day and a timeslot.\nCourses and Teachers. Each course consists of a fixed number of lectures to be scheduled in distinct periods, it is attended by a number of students, and is taught by a teacher. For each course there is a minimum number of days that the lectures of the course should be spread across, moreover there are some periods in which the course cannot be scheduled.\nRooms. Each room has a capacity, i.e., a number of available seats.\nCurricula. A curriculum is a group of courses such that any pair of courses in the group have students in common. Therefore, courses belonging to the same curriculum are in conflict and cannot be scheduled at the same period.\nA solution of the problem is an assignment of a period (day and timeslot) and a room to all lectures of each course, so as to satisfy a set of hard constraints and to minimize the violations of soft constraints."

The algorithm won two out of three tracks of ITC-2007 and was among the finalists in the remaining track.\nAlso the Adaptive Tabu Search proposed by Lü and Hao (2009) follows a three stage scheme: in the initialization phase a feasible timetable is built using a fast heuristic; then the intensification and diversification phases are alternatively applied through an adaptive tabu search, in order to reduce the violations of the soft constraints.\nA novel hybrid metaheuristic technique, obtained combining Electromagnetic -like Mechanisms and the Great Deluge algorithm, has been applied by Abdullah et al. (2012). They obtained good results on both CB-CTT and PE-CTT testbeds.\nFinally, Lü et al.

(2010b) engineered a hybrid method based on the decomposition of the whole problem into different sub-problems, each one solved using a mix of different IP formulations. Subsequently (Burke et al., 2010a), the authors presented a new MIP formulation based on the concept of “supernode” which is used to model graph coloring problems. This new encoding has been applied to CB-CTT benchmarks, and compared with the standard\ntwo-index MILP model implemented in CPLEX, showing that the supernodes formulation is able to considerably reduce computational time. Lastly, in (Burke et al., 2012) a Branch-and-Cut procedure is developed and lower bounds are obtained for various formulations.\nLach and Lübbecke (2012) proposed an IP approach that decomposes the problem in two stages: the first one, whose goal is to assign courses to periods, focused mainly on satisfying the hard constraints; the second one takes care of soft constraints and assigns lectures to rooms by solving a matching problem.\nHao and Benlic (2011) developed a partition-based approach to compute new lower bounds: The original instance is divided into sub-instances through an Iterative Tabu Search procedure, and each subproblem is solved via an ILP solver using the model proposed by Lach and Lübbecke (2012). The lower bound for the original problem is obtained summing up the lower bounds of the sub-instances.\nRecently, Cacchiani et al. (2013) computed new lower bounds using an approach somewhat similar to the one by Hao and Benlic (2011), however in this case the partition is based on soft constraints. Once the initial problem is partitioned, two separated problems are formulated as ILPs and then solved to optimality by a Column Generation technique.\nAśın Achá and Nieuwenhuis (2012) presented an application of several satisfiability (SAT) solvers to the CB-CTT problem. The difference among these SAT-solvers is in the encoding used, that defines in each case which constraints are considered soft or hard. Using different encodings, they were able to compute new lower bounds and obtain new best solutions for the benchmarks.\nFinally, Banbara et al. (2013) translated the CB-CTT formulation into an Answer Set Programming (ASP) problem and solved it by the ASP solver clasp.\nA summary of the results of the cited contributions is given in Table 1 that reports the lower bounds for the instances of ITC-2007 testbed, called comp, where the tightest ones are highlighted in boldface. In the table, we also report the best results known at the time of writing. Best values marked with an asterisk are guaranteed optima (i.e., they match the lower bound)."

      "text" : "We now discuss research activities on CB-CTT that consider other issues, besides the development of a search method for the problem.\nFirst, we mention the development of principled instance generators. The first one has been devised by Burke et al. (2010a) based on the structure of the comp instances. This contribution has been improved by Lopes and Smith-Miles (2010), who base their work on a deeper insight on the features of the instances. We use the generator developed in the latter work, which is publicly available, for our experimental analysis.\nA further issue is the study of the problem as a multi-objective one. To this regard, Geiger (2009) investigates the CB-CTT problem as a multicriteria decision problem by studying the influence of the weighted sum aggregation methodology in the performance of the solution technique.\nRelated to the multi-objective question, is the issue of fairness. In fact, in the standard formulation, some curricula can be heavily penalized in order to obtain the best overall result. Mühlenthaler and Wanka (2013) consider various notions of fairness and compare their effects with the other objectives."

In detail, the move selection strategy proceeds in two stages: first the neighborhood is randomly selected with a non-uniform probability with bias sr, then a random move in the selected neighborhood is uniformly drawn."

      "heading" : "4.3 Cost function",
      "text" : "The cost of a solution s is a weighted sum of the violations of the hard constraints Conflicts and RoomOccupancy and of the objectives (i.e., the violations of the soft constraints):\nCost(s) = Conflicts(s) × whard + RoomOccupancy(s) × whard + MinWorkingDays(s) × wwd + RoomStability(s) × wrs + RoomCapacity(s) × wrc + IsolatedLectures(s) × wil ,\nwhere the weights wwd = 5, wrs = wrc = 1 and wil = 2 are defined by the problem formulation, while whard is a parameter to the algorithm (see Section 4.5). In fact, this value should be high enough to give precedence to feasibility over the objectives, but it should not be too high so as to allow the SA metaheuristic (whose move acceptance criterion is based on the difference in the cost function) to select also moves that will increase the number of violations in early stages of the search."

      "text" : "In (Bellio et al., 2012) the metaheuristic that guides the search is a combination (token-ring) of Tabu Search and a “standard” version of SA. In this work, we show that a single-stage enhanced version of the SA, once properly tuned, can outperform such a combination. The main differences of the SA approach implemented in this algorithm with respect to the SA in (Bellio et al., 2012) are the following:\n1. a cutoff-based temperature cooling scheme (Johnson et al., 1989);\n2. a different stopping condition for the solver, based on the maximum number of allowed iterations;\nAnother major difference with respect to Bellio et al. (2012) consists in the statistical analysis and the tuning process. Indeed, in this work we perform a thorough tuning process of the SA method, that has been carried out and validated on a extensive set of instances (see Section 5 for details). The statistical analysis aims at distinguishing a fixed setting of the parameters that generalizes reasonably well over the whole set of instances, and an automatic procedure to predict the ideal parameter setup, on the basis of computable features of the instance at hand.\nIn the rest of this section we are going to describe the main algorithmic aspects of the SA method, and we defer the explanation of the statistical analysis and the tuning process to Section 6.\nCutoff-based cooling scheme In order to better exploit the time at its disposal, our algorithm employs a cutoff-based cooling scheme. In practice, instead of sampling a fixed number ns of solutions at each temperature level (as it is customary in SA implementations), the algorithm is allowed to decrease the temperature prematurely, i.e., by multiplying it for the cooling rate cr, if a portion na ≤ ns of the sampled solutions has been accepted already. This allows to speed-up the search in the initial stages of the search, thus saving iterations that can be used in the final stages, where intensification sets in.\nStopping condition To allow a fair comparison with the existing work in literature, our SA variant stops based on an iteration budget (which will be roughly equivalent to a time budget, given that the cost of one iteration is\napproximately constant), rather than when a specific (minimum) temperature tmin is reached. This has the drawback that when the budget runs out, the temperature might still be too high. In order to overcome this problem, we fix an expected minimum temperature tmin to a reasonable value and we compute the number ns (see Equation 1) of solutions sampled at each temperature so that the minimum temperature is reached exactly when the maximum number of iterations is met.\nns = itermax\n/( − log (t0/tmin)\nlog cr\n) . (1)\nBecause of the cutoff-based cooling scheme, at the beginning of the search the temperature decreases before all ns solutions have been sampled, thus tmin is reached k iterations in advance, where k depends on the cost landscape and on the ratio na/ns. These k iterations are thus saved to be exploited at the end of the search, i.e., when tmin has been reached, to carry out further (intensification) moves.\nMoreover, given the dependence of the cutoff-based scheme on the ratio na/ns and the relation na ≤ ns, in order to simplify the parameters of the algorithm, we decided to indirectly specify the value of the parameter na by employing a real-valued parameter ρ ∈]0, 1] that represents the ratio of the number of sampled solutions that will be accepted."

In order to have a wider range of values necessary for our objectives, however, we have created our own instances using the generator.\nSpecifically, we have created 5 instances for each pair of values of the two parameters. The number of lectures ranges in {i · 50 | i = 1, . . . , 24},\nso that they will be comprised between 50 and 1200. As the percentage of occupation we consider the four values {50%, 70%, 80%, 90%}.

Ideally, the results of this study should carry over to unseen instances, thus making the approach more general than typical parameter tuning. This is, in fact, an attempt to alleviate the effect of the No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization (Wolpert and Macready, 1997), which state that, for any algorithm (resp. any parameter setup), any elevated performance over one class of problems is exactly paid for in performance over another class.\n1Contributed by Moritz Mühlenthaler 2See http://www.easystaff.it\nOn the other hand, as the outcome of these analysis, we aim at obtaining a robust tuning of the various parameters of our algorithm, so that its performances compare favorably with those obtained by other state of the art methods.\nIn the following, we first illustrate the experimental setting and the statistical methodology we employ in this study.

The compared parameter setups are sampled from the Hammersley point set (Hammersley et al., 1965), for the ranges whose bounds are reported in Table 2. This choice has been driven by two properties that make this point generation strategy particularly suitable for parameter tuning. First, the Hammersley point set is scalable, both with respect to the number of sampled parameter setups, and to the dimensions of the sampled space. Sec-\nond, the sampled points exhibit low discrepancy, i.e., they are space-filling, despite being random-like. For these reasons, by sampling the sequence, one can generate any number of representative combinations of any number of parameters. Note that the sequence is deterministic, and must be seeded with a list of prime numbers. Also, the sequence generates points p ∈ [0, 1]n, which must then be re-scaled in their desired intervals.\nAll the experiments were generated and executed using json2run (Urli, 2013) on an Ubuntu Linux 13.04 machine with 16 Intel® Xeon® CPU E52660 (2.20 GHz) physical cores, hyper-threaded to 32 virtual cores.

The first involved running a F-Race(RSD) tuning (Birattari et al., 2010) over the training instances with a 95% confidence, in order to establish a baseline for further comparisons. The race ended with more than one surviving setups, mainly differing for the values of whard and cr, but giving a clear indication about the good values for the other parameters. This suggested that setting a specific value for whard and cr, at least within the investigated intervals, was essentially irrelevant to the performance, and allowed us to simplify the analysis, by fixing whard = 100 and cr = 0.99 (see Table 4). Observe that, removing a parameter from the analysis has the double benefit of removing some experimental noise, and to allow a finer-grained tuning of the other parameters, at the same computational cost. We thus repeated the race with fewer parameters, and found a single winning setup, fixing ρ = 0.0364, t0 = 30, tmin = 0.16 and sr = 0.43.\nThe second step consisted in testing all the sampled parameter setups against the whole set of training instances. This allowed us to further refine our study in two ways. First, we realized that our initial estimates over the parameters intervals were too conservative, encompassing low-performance areas of the parameters space. A notable finding was that, on the whole set of training instances, a golden spot for sr was around 0.43, the same value found with F-Race; we thus fixed this parameter as well, along with whard and cr. Table 4 summarizes the whole parameter space after this preliminary phase (parameters in boldface have not been fixed in this phase, and are the subject of the following analysis). Second, by running a KruskalWallis test (see Hollander and Wolfe, 1999) with significance level 10% on the\ndependence of cost distribution on parameter values, we realized that some of the instances were irrelevant to our analysis, and we therefore decided to drop them, and to limit our study to the significant ones (314 instances).\nFinally, we sampled 20 parameter setups from the remaining 3-dimensional (t0, ρ, tmin) Hammersley point set, and performed 10 independent runs of each parameter setup on every instance.

      "text" : "For each instance, the basic idea is to approximate the cost as a function of the parameters by a regression model, be encoding them as experimental factors assuming values in the [-1,1] range. As we cannot exclude interactions between the three parameters under study, we decided to consider all of them together. In particular, we compared three different models.\nLinear model (M1): A simple model approximates the cost as a linear function of the parameters. Namely, for i = 1, . . . , n, with n equal to the\nsample size for each instance (n = 20 × 10), the deterministic component of the model is given by\ng1(xi, β) = β0 + 3∑\nj=1\nxij βj , (2)\nwhere xij is the i-th value for the j-th encoded parameter (j = 1, 2, 3) and xi = (xi1, xi2, xi3), whereas β = (β0, β1, β2, β3) are coefficients that are estimated from the experimental data.\nQuadratic model (M2): This model extends the previous one by including quadratic terms for each encoded parameter and interaction term\ng2(xi, β) = β0 + 3∑\nj=1\nβj xij + 3∑\nj=1\nβj+3 x 2 ij\n+ β7 xi1 xi2 + β8 xi1 xi3 + β9 xi2 xi3 . (3)\nGroup-effect model (M3): These models simply assume a constant level of cost at each different experimental point, namely\ng3(xi, β) = βj , with j = m(i) , (4)\nwhere m(i) is the function that returns the experimental point associated to each observation, namely m(i) ∈ {1, . . . , 20}. This can be seen as the model corresponding to one-way ANOVA analyses.\nBased on the idea of experimental response surfaces (see Bellio et al., 2012, Section 4.2), we first fitted both M1 and M2, and compared them with the M3 model. From the result of the preliminary Kruskal-Wallis test it was already known that the selected instances were those where M3 was a meaningful model, therefore the task performed at this step correspond to checking whether a lower-dimensional linear or quadratic function of the parameters could approximate significantly well the fit provided by the groupeffect model.\nAll the models were fitted by median regression, rather than ordinary least squares. Median regression assumes that the deterministic function gj(xi, β), j = 1, 2, 3 approximates the median cost, rather than the mean cost, corresponding to a certain combination of parameters. Denoting by yi the\ncost of the i-th observation, the estimated β coefficients are the coefficients that minimize the objective function\nn∑ i=1 |yi − gj(xi, β)| , (5)\nand therefore the technique is also known as Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) regression. Being based on the median rather than the mean, median regression is much less influenced by outliers in the response then ordinary least squares.\nMedian regression is therefore suited for robust estimation of regression models from experimental data where outliers may arise in the response, such as in the algorithm under study here. Inferential usage of the method does not require the normality assumption of the response variable, hence it is not crucial to choose the right scale for the cost. This is a clear advantage when data from multiple instances are analyzed, as the normalizing transformations of cost typically vary across instances. Last but not least, median regression models can be easily trained by casting the optimization of (5) as a linear programming problem, as done by the R package quantreg (Koenker, 2013). All in all, we find such reasons quite\ncompelling to endorse the usage of median regression, or, more generally, quantile regression, for the analysis of the performances of stochastic algorithms.\nThe model among M1,M2,M3 that provided the best fit was selected by means of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection (Koenker, 2005, Section 4.9.1), which is known to have good performances for prediction. When the linear or quadratic regression models were selected, the parameter setup corresponding to the minimum predicted cost was then\nselected, and the corresponding parameters deemed as being optimal. When the group-effect model was selected by the AIC criterion, we simply selected the design point corresponding to the smallest sample median, as M3 model fitted by median regression corresponds to computing a different sample median at each design point. Figure 1 displays the box-plots of cost values on a single training instance corresponding to each design point, projected on t0."

      "text" : "Once the ideal parameter setup has been identified for each instance, we include instance features in the process. We thus build a new median regression model for each parameter that we want to predict, and we use the instance features, together with the identified ideal setups, to train the model. Clearly, not all features are equally relevant for the prediction of our parameters, therefore we start from a model involving the complete set of features and, again by using the AIC criterion, we select the best fitting model, i.e., the one with smallest AIC.\nAs it turns out, only three of the considered features are significant for predicting the algorithm parameters, namely the total number of lectures (Le), the number of curricula (Cu), and the average number of daily lectures per curriculum (DL). Moreover, different parameters are predicted by different features. In particular, in order to predict the ideal t0 and ρ we need to know the total number of lectures and the number of curricula, while to compute the ideal tmin we need the number of lectures and the average number of daily lectures per curriculum. Table 5 reports the coefficients of our fitted linear models, together with the intercept term (Int).\nBy looking at the predicted parameter values for the validation instances, with respect to their features (see Figure 2), some conclusions can be drawn. First, t0 and ρ are highly correlated with the number of lectures, a fea-\nture which, in literature, is commonly considered as a measure of instance hardness. This was, in fact, an expected result of the analysis. Second, by increasing the number of lectures, the starting temperature increases as well, suggesting that, when instances become more difficult, it is beneficial to accept a lot of worsening solutions at the beginning of the search. This will foster the exploration of the search space in the hope of finding basins of attraction of lower cost. Moreover, the ideal number of neighbors that have to be accepted before decreasing the temperature gets lower when the problem gets harder. This indicates that the cutoffs mechanism, described in Section 4.4, plays a determinant role in achieving good performances on the larger instances. Finally, the ideal minimum temperature increases linearly with the increase of the average number of lectures per curriculum, which is another measure related to instance hardness. The consequence of this choice is that the temperature will decrease more quickly on larger instances, supporting the effect of cutoffs, and performing a lot of intensification towards the end of the search. Note that, in order for this strategy to perform a sufficient amount of diversification, the initial temperature must be higher (as suggested by the predictor)."

We report the results obtained with both feature-based tuning (FBT) and standard F-Race tuning (further discussed in Section 6.5). The figures show that our approach matches or outperforms the state of the art algorithms in more than half of the instances, also improving on our previous results (Bellio et al., 2012).\nThis outcome is particularly significant also because, differently from all the previous approaches, we have not involved the validation instances in the tuning process."

The figures reveal that the feature-based tuning outperforms the F-Race approach on most instances.\nHowever the difference in performance is not as large as we could have expected, since feature-based tuning, should exhibit a better generalization behavior over unseen instances. We looked for an explanation of this effect in the training phase of our regression models, and found out that, in fact, the per-instance tuning (ideally the best possible, see Section 6.3.1), has itself a quality comparable to standard F-Race. By looking at Figure 1, which is representative of a large portion of the training instances, it is possible to see why. The parameter space (in this case for t0) is split in two well-distinct parts. One part (the leftmost in Figure 1) yields poor results, while any choice of values inside the other part is reasonably safe. In our scenario, the portion of the parameter space leading to poor results is typically very narrow, while the portion leading to better results is broader. This suggests that the chosen algorithm is rather robust with respect to parameter choice, at least for this problem domain. As a consequence, it is possible, for F-Race, to find a parameter setup that works consistently well across a large set of instances."

These experiments were carried out outside of the ITC-2007 competition setup, as they were allotted 3 · 108 maximum iterations. The results are reported both for the F-Race and the feature-based tuning. Regarding the latter, the lack of results on the Erlangen family can be attributed to the particular structure of such instances, caused by the peculiar way in which the original timetabling problem is mapped on the described formulation. In particular, the average number of lectures is very close to the average number of courses (see Table 3), suggesting that, in almost all cases, lectures actually correspond to courses. Similarly, the number of curricula, which is typically smaller than the number of courses, is instead one order of magnitude larger, possibly because each curriculum represents the choice of a single student. The different semantics of the involved features make it impossible to use our feature-based predictor. This kind of mapping is closer in structure to the one used in the PE-CTT formulation, which has been addressed in Ceschia et al. (2012)."

For example, we plan to consider the version that includes reheating. In addition, we plan to investigate other metaheuristics techniques for the problem and let them go through the same statistical analysis. Finally, we aim at applying this search and tuning technique to\nother timetabling problems, including other variants of CB-CTT and PECTT."

The contributions of this paper are twofold. On the one side, we propose an effective and robust single-stage simulated annealing search method for solving the problem. On the other side, we design and apply an extensive and statistically-principled analysis methodology for the algorithm parameter tuning procedure. The outcome of this analysis is a linear regression model between instance features and search method parameters, that allows us to set the parameters for unseen instances on the basis of a simple inspection of the instance itself. Using this method, our algorithm, despite its apparent simplicity, has been able to achieve very good experimental results on a set of popular benchmark testbeds. 1 ar X iv :1 40 9. 71 86 v1 [ cs .A I] 2 5 Se p 20 14 Finally, we propose many new, real-world instances, that could be used as ground for future comparisons.",
