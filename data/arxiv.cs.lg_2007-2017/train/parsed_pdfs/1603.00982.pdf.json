      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Representing variable-length audio segments as fixed-length feature vectors is important for many speech applications. In speaker identification [1], audio emotion classification [2], and spoken term detection (STD) [3, 4, 5], the audio segments are usually represented as feature vectors to apply typical classifiers to determine their speaker labels, emotion labels or whether containing input queries. In query-by-example STD, by representing each word segment as a feature vector, indexing the segments can be easier, which makes retrieval much more efficient [6].\nAudio segment representation is still an open problem. It is common to use i-vectors to represent utterances in speaker identification [1], and there are several approaches successfully used in STD [6, 3, 4, 5]. Deep learning is also used for extracting representations [7, 8]. By learning Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with an audio segment as input and the word corresponding to the segment as target, the outputs of the hidden layer at the last few time steps can be used as the representation of the input segment [8]. However, this approach needs a large amount of audio segments with word labeling as training data.\nOn the other hand, Autoencoder has been one of the most prominent machine learning techniques for extracting representations in an unsupervised way [9, 10], but its input should be vectors of fixed dimensionality. Such limitation is dreadful be-\ncause sentences, speech and video are intrinsically expressed in arbitrary length sequences. Therefore, a general framework to encode a sequence using sequence to sequence Autoencoder is proposed [11, 12, 13, 14], in which a RNN is used to encode a sequence into a fixed-length representation, and then another RNN is used to decode a sequence out of that representation. This general framework has been applied on natural language processing [12, 13] and video processing [14], but not yet on speech processing.\nIn this paper, we propose to use Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (SA) to represent variable-length audio segments by fixed-length feature vectors. The audio segments that sound alike would have feature vectors nearby in the space. Different from the previous work [7, 8], learning SA does not need any supervision. That is, only the audio segments without any labeling are needed. This makes it very suitable for the applications in the low resource scenario. Inspired from denoising Autoencoder [15, 16], we further propose Denoising Sequenceto-sequence Autoencoder (DSA) that improves the learned representations. The learned representations can be used in a wide variety of speech applications. In this preliminary study, we show that the audio segment representations from SA can be very helpful in query-by-example STD. Here the audio database is first segmented by the word boundaries, and then each segment is transformed into a vector by the SA. When a spoken query is entered, it is also transformed into a vector by the same SA, and then the segments in the database are ranked according to the similarities with the spoken query based on their vectors. Query-by-example STD using audio segment representation is much more efficient than the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based approaches because instead of computing the similarities between sequences by DTW, only the similarities between single vectors are needed. The retrieval performance using the learned representations outperformed using representations designed heuristically and the DTW approach."

      "text" : "In this section, we describe the approach for learning audio segment representations without any supervision. An audio segment is usually expressed with a variable-length input x = (x1, x2, ..., xT ), where each symbol xt is an acoustic feature such as MFCC. The goal here is to automatically encode any audio segment sequence x with different T into a fixedlength vector representation z ∈ Rd, where d is the dimension of the encoded space. The learned representation z can be used in a wide variety of applications, for example, query-byexample STD as described in Section 3. Below we first give a brief recap on the RNN Encoder-Decoder framework [17, 18], which is widely used to realize the sequence-to-sequence learning in Section 2.1.

      "text" : "RNN are neural networks whose hidden neurons form a directed cycle. Given a sequence x = (x1, x2, ..., xT ), RNN updates its hidden state ht according to the current input xt and the hidden state at the last time step ht−1. The hidden state ht acts as an internal memory at time step t that enables the network to capture dynamic temporal information and also allows the network to process variable-length of sequence. In practice, RNN does not seem to learn long-term dependencies [19], so LSTM [20] is designed to conquer such difficulty. Because many amazing results were achieved by LSTM, RNN is usually equipped with LSTM units [21, 22, 23, 24, 18, 25, 26].\nRNN Encoder-Decoder [18, 17] consists of an Encoder RNN and a Decoder RNN. The Encoder RNN reads the input sequence x = (x1, x2, ..., xM ) sequentially and the hidden state ht of the RNN is updated accordingly. After the last symbol xM is processed, the hidden state hM is interpreted as the learned representation of the whole input sequence. Then, by taking hM as input, the Decoder RNN generates the output sequence y = (y1, y2, ..., xN ) sequentially, where M and N can be different. Such RNN Encoder-Decoder framework is able to handle variable-length of input. Although there may exists a considerable time lag between the input symbols and their corresponding output symbols, LSTM units in RNN are able to handle such case well due to their powerfulness on modeling long-term dependencies.\n2.2. Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (SA)\nIn this section, we describe the Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (SA) which combines the RNN Encoder-Decoder framework with Autoencoder for unsupervised learning of audio segment representations. Figure 1 depicts its structure. SA consists of an Encoder RNN (the left part of Figure 1) and a Decoder RNN (the right part). Given an audio segment represented as an acoustic feature sequence x = (x1, x2, ..., xT ) with any length T , the Encoder RNN reads each acoustic feature xt sequentially and the hidden state ht is updated accordingly. After\nthe last acoustic feature xT has been read and processed, the hidden state hT of the Encoder RNN is viewed as the learned representation z of the input sequence (the small black block in Figure 1). The Decoder RNN takes hT as the first input and generates its first output y1. Then it takes y1 as input to generate y2, and so on. Following the philosophy of Autoencoder [9, 10], the target of the output sequence y = (y1, y2, ..., yT ) is the input sequence x = (x1, x2, ..., xT ). In other words, the RNN Encoder and Decoder are jointly trained by minimizing the reconstruction error, measured by the general mean squared error∑T\nt=1 ‖xt − yt‖ 2. Because the input sequence is taken as the learning target, the training process does not need any labelled data. The fixed-length vector representation z will be meaningful representation for the input audio segment x because if the whole input sequence x can be reconstructed from z by RNN Decoder, z must contain the information of the whole input sequence x."

The target of unsupervised query-by-example STD is to locate the occurrence regions of the term in the input spoken query without speech recognition. Figure 2 shows how we used the representation z in unsupervised query-by-example. This framework is inspired from the previous work [6], but completely different approach is used to represent the audio segments here. In the upper half of Figure 2, the audio archives in the database are segmented based on word boundaries into a set of variablelength segments, and then the system exploits the RNN encoder in Figure 1 to encode the word audio segments to fixed-length vectors. Given the query audio (the left lower corner of Figure 2), it is also encoded by the RNN encoder into a vector.\nThe system then calculates the cosine similarities between the query vector and all the vectors of the word audio segments in the database, and then return a list of searched audio segments ranked according to the similarities."

      "text" : "We used LibriSpeech1 corpus [27], which is derived from read audiobooks from the LibriVox2 project, as data for experiments. For the lack of computation power, only the 5.4 hours dev-clean subset was used for training SA and DSA. The 5.4 hours testclean subset was the testing set. Both the training and testing sets contain 40 different speakers. MFCCs of 13-dim were used as the acoustic features. Both the training and testing sets were segmented according to the word boundaries obtained by forced alignment with respect to the reference transcriptions. Although the oracle word boundaries were used, since the baselines used the same segmentation as well, the comparison in this paper was fair.\nSA and DSA were implemented with Theano [28, 29]. The network structure and hyper parameters were set as below without further tuning if no specified:\n• Both RNN Encoder and Decoder consisted one hidden layer with 100 LSTM units. That is, each input segment was mapped into a 100-dim vector representation by SA or DSA. We adopted the LSTM version described in the previous work [30], and the peephole connections [31] were added.\n• The networks were trained by stochastic gradient descent without momentum for 500 epochs, with a fixed learning rate of 0.3 for the first 400 epochs and 0.35 for the rest 100 epochs.\n• For DSA, zero-masking [16] was used to generate the noisy input x̃, which randomly wiped out some elements in each input acoustic feature and set them to zero. The possibility to be wiped out was set to 0.3.\nFor query-by-example STD, the testing set also served as the audio database to be searched through. Each word segment in the testing set was taken as a spoken query once. When a word segment was taken as a query, it would be excluded from the database. There were 5557 queries in total. Mean Average Precision (MAP) [32] was used as the evaluation measure for query-by-example STD as the previous work [33]."

      "text" : "In this section, we want to validate that the words with similar pronunciations would have close SA and DSA vector representations. We used the SA and DSA learned from the training set to encode the segments in the testing set, which were never seen in the training stage, and then computed the cosine similarity between each segment pair in the testing set. The results\n1http://www.openslr.org/12/ 2https://librivox.org\nare in Table 1, in which the average cosine similarity of the segment pairs corresponding to the word pairs with different phoneme edit distances are displayed in each row. It is clear that when two segments are words with larger phoneme edit distances (that is, more distinct pronunciations), on an average, the cosine similarity of their vector representations is smaller. We also found that SA and DSA can even distinguish the words only with one different phoneme because the similarity of the case that edit distance is 0 (same pronunciation) is remarkably larger than the case that edit distance equals 1. The results show that SA and DSA can encode the acoustic information in their vector representations. However, it is difficult to know whether the performance of DSA is superior to SA from Table 1. Their performance will be further compared with other baselines in Section 4.3.\nBecause RNN Encoder in Figure 1 reads the input acoustic sequence sequentially, it is possible that the last few acoustic features dominate the vector representation, and the words with the same suffixes are hard to be distinguished by the learned representation. To justify the hypothesis, we analyze the following two sets of words with the same suffixes:\n• Set #1: father, mother, another\n• Set #2: ever, never, however\nSame with the previous analysis, we used cosine similarity to measure the differences between two encoded vectors. The result is displayed in Table 2. From Set #1, we found the vector\nrepresentations of audio segments of “father” are much more similar to each other than the vectors of “mother” and “another” (0.5047 v.s. 0.2639, 0.1964 for SA, and 0.5209 v.s. 0.2748, 0.1861 for DSA) even though “farther”, “mother” and\n“another” have the same suffix “-ther”. Set #2 (“ ever”, “never” and “however”) show the same phenomenon. The other examples also show similar phenomenon, but we just display two sets of words here due to space limitation. The results show that although the RNN Encoder read the acoustic sequence sequentially, the words with the same suffix are still distinguishable from the learned vectors."

      "text" : "Here we compared the performance of using the representations from SA and DSA in query-by-example with two baselines. The first baseline used DTW [34] which is a common algorithm used in current query-by-example application. Here we used DTW to directly compute the similarities between the input query and the audio segments, and ranked the segments according to the similarities. Only the vanilla version of DTW was used here, and the Euclidean distance was used to evaluate the difference between acoustic features.\nThe second baseline used the same framework in Figure 2, except that the RNN Encoder is replaced by a manually designed encoder. We use the example in Figure 3 to illustrate this approach. The approach contains three procedures: di-\nvide, average, and concatenate. Assume there is an input sequence x = (x1, x2, ..., x18), where each symbol xt contains 13 elements, and the goal is to compress it into a 39- dim vector representation. The approach first divides x into 39/13 = 3 groups: (x1, x2, ..., x6), (x7, x8, ..., x12), and (x13, x14, ..., x18). Then, for each group, the method computes their average, yielding three vectors x(1) = 1\n6 ∑6 t=1 xt,\nx(2) = 1 6 ∑12 t=7 xt, and x (3) = 1 6 ∑18 t=13 xt, respectively. Finally, the three vectors are concatenated together and form a 39-dim vector representation [x(1);x(2);x(3)]. We will refer to this approach as Naı̈ve Encoder (NE) in the following paper. Although NE is simple, similar approaches have been used in STD and achieved some successful results [3, 4, 5]. In Table 3, we show the MAP obtained by NE with different encoded space dimensionality, which is the subscript number after each word “NE” in the table. Because MFCCs of 13 dim are the acous-\ntic features, the dimensions of NE was always the multiple of\n13. We found that NE with 52 and 104 dimensions, or NE52 and NE104, yielded the best results, so we will compare the proposed approaches with NE52 and NE104 in the following paper 3.\nFigure 4 shows the retrieval performances of DTW, NE52, NE104, SA and DSA. The y-axis is for MAP, and the x-axis is the number of epochs. The number of epochs is only related to SA and DSA, and have nothing to do with DTW, NE52 and NE104. Besides the DTW approach, the other four approaches mapped the variable-length audio segments to fixed-length vectors, but different approaches were used. DTW is not comparable with NE52 and NE104 probably because only the vanilla version was used, and NE was able to consider the temporal information. As the training epochs increased, both of SA and DSA resulted in higher MAP. The retrieval performance of SA is comparable with NE52 and NE104 after 450 epochs. DSA outperformed SA in most cases, and defeated NE52 and NE104 since 360 epochs, and its performance still increased after that. The experimental results shows that learned representations can be much better than the manually designed ones, and verified that the learned representations were better when learning with denoising criterion."

    "abstractText" : "Representing audio segments expressed with variablelength acoustic feature sequences as fixed-length feature vectors is usually needed in many speech applications, including speaker identification, audio emotion classification and spoken term detection (STD). In this paper, we apply and extend sequence-to-sequence learning framework to learn representations for audio segments without any supervision. The model we used is called Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (SA), which consists of two RNNs equipped with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units: the first RNN acts as an encoder that maps the input sequence into a vector representation of fixed dimensionality, and the second RNN acts as a decoder that maps the representation back to the input sequence. The two RNNs are then jointly trained by minimizing the reconstruction error. We further propose Denoising Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (DSA) that improves the learned representations. The vector representations learned by SA and DSA are shown to be very helpful for query-by-example STD. The experimental results have shown that the proposed models achieved better retrieval performance than using audio segment representation designed heuristically and the classical Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach.",
