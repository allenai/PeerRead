      "text" : "Recently, deep learning has greatly impacted the natural language processing field as well as computer vision. Machine translation (MT) with deep neural networks (DNN), proposed by (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014) and (Bahdanau et al., 2014) competed successfully in the last year’s WMT evaluation campaign (Bojar et al., 2015).\nIn the same trend, generating descriptions from images using DNNs has been proposed by (Elliott et al., 2015). Several attempts have been made to incorporate features from different modalities in order to help the automatic system to better model the task at hand (Elliott et al., 2015; Kiros et al., 2014b; Kiros et al., 2014a).\nThis paper describes the systems developed by LIUM and CVC who participated in the two proposed tasks for the WMT 2016 Multimodal Machine Translation evaluation campaign: Multimodal machine translation (Task 1) and multimodal image description (Task 2).\nThe remainder of this paper is structured in two parts: The first part (section 2) describes the architecture of the four systems (two monomodal and two multimodal) submitted for Task 1. The standard phrase-based SMT systems based on Moses are described in section 2.1 while the neural MT systems are described in section 2.2 (monomodal) and section 3.2 (multimodal). The second part (section 3) contains the description of the two systems submitted for Task 2: The first one is a monomodal neural MT system similar to the one presented in section 2.2, and the second one is a multimodal neural machine translation (MNMT) with shared attention mechanism.\nIn order to evaluate the feasibility of the multimodal approach, we also asked humans to perform the two tasks of this evaluation campaign. Results show that the additional English description sentences improved performance while the straightforward translation of the sentence without the image did not provide as good results. The results of these experiments are presented in section 4."

This system is trained using the data provided by the organizers and tuned using MERT (Och, 2003) to maximize BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007) scores on the validation set.\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n09 18\n6v 4\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n6 A\nug 2\n01 6\nWe also used Continuous Space Language Model1 (CSLM) (Schwenk, 2010) with the auxiliary features support as proposed by (Aransa et al., 2015). This CSLM architecture allows us to use sentence-level features for each line in the training data (i.e. all n-grams in the same sentence will have the same auxiliary features). By this means, better context specific LM estimations can be obtained.\nWe used four additional scores to rerank 1000- best outputs of our baseline system: The first two scores are obtained from two separate CSLM(s) trained on the target side (i.e. German) of the parallel training corpus and each one of the following auxiliary features:\n• VGG19-FC7 image features: The auxiliary feature used in the first CSLM are the image features provided by the organizers which are extracted from the FC7 layer (relu7) of the VGG-19 network (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014). This allows us to train a multimodal CSLM that uses additional context learned from the image features.\n• Source side sentence representation vectors: We used the method described in (Le and Mikolov, 2014) to compute continuous space representation vector for each source (i.e. English) sentence that will be provided to the second CSLM as auxiliary feature. The idea behind this is to condition our target language model on the source side as additional context.\nThe two other scores used for n-best reranking are the log probability computed by our NMT system that will be described in the following section and the score obtained by a Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNNLM) (Mikolov et al., 2010). The weights of the original moses features and our additional features were optimized to maximize the BLEU score on the validation set."

Each source and target word is represented with an embedding vector of dimension EX and EY respectively:\nX = (x1, x2, ..., xN ), xi ∈ REX (1) Y = (y1, y2, ..., yM ), yj ∈ REY (2)\nA bidirectional recurrent encoder reads an input sequenceX in forwards and backwards to produce two sets of hidden states based on the current input and the previous hidden state. An annotation vector hi for each position i is then obtained by concatenating the produced hidden states.\nAn attention mechanism, implemented as a simple fully-connected feed-forward neural network, accepts the hidden state ht of the decoder’s recurrent layer and one input annotation at a time, to produce the attention coefficients. A softmax activation is applied on those attention coefficients to obtain the attention weights used to generate the weighted annotation vector for time t. The initial hidden state h0 of the decoder is determined by a feed-forward layer receiving the mean annotation vector.\nWe use Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Chung et al., 2014) activation function for both recurrent encoders and decoders."

The training times were 16 and 26 hours respectively for monomodal and multimodal systems on a Tesla K40 GPU.\nFinally, we used a classical left to right beamsearch with a beam size of 12 for sentence generation during test time."

This dataset consists of 29K parallel sentences (direct translations of image descriptions from English to German) for training, 1014 for validation and finally 1000 for the test set. We preprocessed the dataset using the punctuation normalization, tokenization and lowercasing scripts from Moses. In order to generalize better over the compound structs in German, we trained and applied a compound splitter3 (Sennrich and Haddow, 2015) over the German vocabulary of training and validation sets. This reduces the target vocabulary from 18670 to 15820 unique tokens. During translation generation, the splitted compounds are stitched back together."

Overall, we were able to improve test set scores by around 0.4 and 0.8 on METEOR and BLEU respectively over a strong phrase-based baseline using auxiliary features.\nRegarding the NMT systems, the monomodal NMT achieved a comparative BLEU score of 32.50 on the test set compared to 33.45 of the phrase-based baseline. The multimodal NMT system that will be described in section 3.2, obtained relatively lower scores when trained using Task 1’s data."

      "heading" : "3.1 Visual Data Representation",
      "text" : "To describe the image content we make use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In a breakthrough work, Krizhevsky et al. (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) convincingly show that CNNs yield a far superior image representation compared to previously used hand-crafted image features. Based on this success an intensified research effort started to further improve the representations based on CNNs. The work of Simonyan and Zisserman (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) improved the network by breaking up large convolutional features into multiple layers of small convolutional features, which allowed to train a much deeper network. The organizers provide these features to all participants. More precisely they provide the features from the fifth convolutional layer, and the features from the second fully connected layer of VGG-19. Recently, Residual Networks (ResNet) have been proposed (He et al., 2015). These networks learn residual functions which are constructed by adding skip layers (or projection layers) to the network. These skip layers prevent the vanishing gradient problem, and allow for much deeper networks (over hundred layers) to be trained.\nTo select the optimal layer for image representation we performed an image classification task on a subsection of images from SUN scenes (Xiao et al., 2010). We extract the features from the various layers of ResNet-50 and evaluate the classification performance (Figure 1). The results increase during the first layers but stabilize from Block-4 on. Based on these results and considering that a higher spatial resolution is better, we have selected layer ’res4f relu’ (end of Block-4, after ReLU) for the experiments on multimodal MT. We also compared the features from different networks on the task of image description generation with the system of Xu et al. (Xu et al., 2015). The results for generating English descriptions (Table 3) show a clear performance improvement from VGG-19 to ResNet-50, but comparable results are obtained when going to ResNet-152. Therefore, given the increase in computational cost, we have decided to use ResNet-50 features for our submission."

We decided to use the smaller subset of 145K sentences.\nThe preprocessing is exactly the same as Task 1 except that we only kept sentence pairs with sentence lengths ∈ [3, 50] and with a ratio of at most 3. This results in a final training dataset of 131K\nsentences (Table 4). We picked the most frequent 10K German words and replaced the rest with an UNK token for the target side.

      "text" : "As we can see in Table 5, the multimodal system does not surpass monomodal NMT system. Several explanations can clarify this behavior. First, the architecture is not well suited for integrating image and text representations. This is possible as we did not explore all the possibilities to benefit from both modalities. Another explanation is that the image context contain too much irrelevant information which cannot be discriminated by the lone attention mechanism. This would need a deeper analysis of the attention weights in order to be answered."

      "heading" : "4 Human multimodal description",
      "text" : "To evaluate the importance of the different modalities for the image description generation task, we have performed an experiment where we replace\nthe computer algorithm with human participants. The two modalities are the five English description sentences, and the image. The output is a single description sentence in German. The experiment asks the participants for the following tasks:\n• Given both the image and the English descriptions: ’Describe the image in one sentence in German. You can get help from the English sentences provided.’ • Given only the image: ’Describe the image\nin one sentence in German.’ • Given only one English sentence: ’Translate\nthe English sentence into German.’\nThe experiment was performed by 16 native German speakers proficient in English with age ranging from 23 to 54 (coming from Austria, Germany and Switzerland, of which 10 are female and 6 male). The experiment is performed on the first 80 sentences of the validation set. Participants performed 10 repetitions for each task, and not repeating the same image across tasks. The results of the experiments are presented in Table 6. For humans, the English description sentences help to obtain better performance. Removing the image altogether and providing only a single English description sentence results in a significant drop. We were surprised to observe such a drop, whereas we expected good translations to obtain competitive results. In addition, we have provided the results of our submission on the same subset of images; humans clearly obtain better performance using METEOR metrics, but our approach is clearly outperforming on the BLEU metrics. The participants were not trained on the train set before performing the tasks, which could be one of the reasons for the difference. Furthermore, given the lower performance of only translating one of the English description sentences on both metrics, it could possibly be caused by existing biases in the data set."

Results show that integrating image features into a multimodal neural MT system with shared attention mechanism does not yet surpass the performance obtained with a monomodal system using only text input. However, our multimodal systems do improve upon an image captioning system (which was expected). The phrase-based system can benefit from rescoring with multimodal neural language model as well as rescoring with a neural MT system.\nWe have also presented the results of a human evaluation performing the same tasks as proposed in the challenge. The results are rather clear: image captioning can benefit from multimodality."
