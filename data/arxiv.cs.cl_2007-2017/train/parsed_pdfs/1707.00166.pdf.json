Most existing methods have heavy reliance on annotations labeled by human experts, which are costly and time-consuming. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel framework, REHESSION, to conduct relation extractor learning using annotations from heterogeneous information source, e.g., knowledge base and domain heuristics. These annotations, referred as heterogeneous supervision, often conflict with each other, which brings a new challenge to the original relation extraction task: how to infer the true label from noisy labels for a given instance. Identifying context information as the backbone of both relation extraction and true label discovery, we adopt embedding techniques to learn the distributed representations of context, which bridges all components with mutual enhancement in an iterative fashion. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of REHESSION over the state-of-the-art."

      "text" : "One of the most important tasks towards text understanding is to detect and categorize semantic relations between two entities in a given context. For example, in Fig. 1, with regard to the sentence of c1, relation between Jesse James and Missouri should be categorized as died in. With accurate identification, relation extraction systems can provide essential support for many applications. One\n∗Equal contribution.\nexample is question answering, regarding a specific question, relation among entities can provide valuable information, which helps to seek better answers (Bao et al., 2014). Similarly, for medical science literature, relations like protein-protein interactions (Fundel et al., 2007) and gene disease associations (Chun et al., 2006) can be extracted and used in knowledge base population. Additionally, relation extractors can be used in ontology construction (Schutz and Buitelaar, 2005).\nTypically, existing methods follow the supervised learning paradigm, and require extensive annotations from domain experts, which are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate such drawback, attempts have been made to build relation extractors with a small set of seed instances or human-crafted patterns (Nakashole et al., 2012, 2011; Carlson et al., 2010), based on which more patterns and instances will be iteratively generated by bootstrap learning. However, these methods often suffer from semantic drift (Mintz et al., 2009). Besides, knowledge bases like Freebase have been leveraged to automatically generate training data and provide distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009). Nevertheless, for many domain-specific applications, distant supervision is either non-existent or insufficient (usually less than 25% of relation mentions are covered (Ren et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2012)).\nOnly recently have preliminary studies been developed to unite different supervisions, including knowledge bases and domain specific patterns, which are referred as heterogeneous supervision. As shown in Fig. 1, these supervisions often conflict with each other (Ratner et al., 2016). To address these conflicts, data programming (Ratner et al., 2016) employs a generative model, which encodes supervisions as labeling functions, and adopts the source consistency assumption: a source is likely to provide true information with\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n00 16\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nJ ul\n2 01\n7\nthe same probability for all instances. This assumption is widely used in true label discovery literature (Li et al., 2016) to model reliabilities of information sources like crowdsourcing and infer the true label from noisy labels. Accordingly, most true label discovery methods would trust a human annotator on all instances to the same level.\nHowever, labeling functions, unlike human annotators, do not make casual mistakes but follow certain “error routine”. Thus, the reliability of a labeling function is not consistent among different pieces of instances. In particular, a labeling function could be more reliable for a certain subset (Varma et al., 2016) (also known as its proficient subset) comparing to the rest. We identify these proficient subsets based on context information, only trust labeling functions on these subsets and avoid assuming global source consistency.\nMeanwhile, embedding methods have demonstrated great potential in capturing semantic meanings, which also reduce the dimension of overwhelming text features. Here, we present REHESSION, a novel framework capturing context’s semantic meaning through representation learning, and conduct both relation extraction and true label discovery in a context-aware manner. Specifically, as depicted in Fig. 1, we embed relation mentions in a low-dimension vector space, where similar relation mentions tend to have similar relation types and annotations. ‘True’ labels are further inferred based on reliabilities of labeling functions, which are calculated with their proficient subsets’ representations. Then, these inferred true labels would serve as supervision for all components, including context representation, true label discovery and relation extraction. Besides, the context representation bridges relation extraction with true label discovery, and allows them to enhance each other.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the framework proposed here is the first method that utilizes representation learning to provide heterogeneous supervision for relation extraction. The high-quality context representations serve as the backbone of true label discovery and relation extraction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over the state-ofthe-art.\nThe remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the definition of relation extraction with heterogeneous supervision. We then present the REHESSION model and the learning algorithm in Section 3, and report our experimental evaluation in Section 4. Finally, we briefly survey related work in Section 5 and conclude this study in Section 6."

      "text" : "In this section, we would formally define relation extraction and heterogeneous supervision.\nRelation Extraction. For a sentence d, an entity mention is a token span in d which represents an entity, and a relation mention is a triple (e1, e2, d) which consists of an ordered entity pair (e1, e2) and d. The relation extraction task is to categorize relation mentions into a given set of relation types R, or Not-Target-Type (None) which means the type of the relation mention does not belong toR. Heterogeneous Supervision. Similar to (Ratner et al., 2016), we employ labeling functions as basic units to encode supervision information and generate annotations. Since different supervision information may have different proficient subsets, we require each labeling function to encode only one elementary supervision information. Specifically, in the relation extraction scenario, we require each labeling function to only annotate one\nrelation type based on one elementary piece of information, e.g., four examples are listed in Fig. 1.\nProblem Definition. For a POS-tagged corpus D with detected entities, we refer its relation mentions as C = {ci = (ei,1, ei,2, d), ∀d ∈ D}. Our goal is to annotate entity mentions with relation types of interest (R = {r1, . . . , rK}) or None. We require users to provide heterogeneous supervision in the form of labeling function Λ = {λ1, . . . , λM}, and mark the annotations generated by Λ as O = {oc,i|λi generate annotation oc,i for c ∈ C}. We record relation mentions annotated by Λ as Cl, and refer relation mentions without annotation as Cu. Then, our task is to train a relation extractor based on Cl and categorize relation mentions in Cu."

      "heading" : "3 The REHESSION Framework",
      "text" : "Here, we present REHESSION, a novel framework to infer true labels from automatically generated noisy labels, and categorize unlabeled instances into a set of relation types. Intuitively, errors of annotations (O) come from mismatch of contexts, e.g., in Fig. 1, λ1 annotates c1 and c2 with ’true’ labels but for mismatched contexts ‘killing’ and ’killed’. Accordingly, we should only trust labeling functions on matched context, e.g., trust λ1 on c3 due to its context ‘was born in’, but not on c1 and c2. On the other hand, relation extraction can be viewed as matching appropriate relation type to\na certain context. These two matching processes are closely related and can enhance each other, while context representation plays an important role in both of them. Framework Overview. We propose a general framework to learn the relation extractor from automatically generated noisy labels. As plotted in Fig. 1, distributed representation of context bridges relation extraction with true label discovery, and allows them to enhance each other. Specifically, it follows the steps below:\n1. After being extracted from context, text features are embedded in a low dimension space by representation learning (see Fig. 2); 2. Text feature embeddings are utilized to calculate relation mention embeddings (see Fig. 2); 3. With relation mention embeddings, true labels are inferred by calculating labeling functions’ reliabilities in a context-aware manner (see Fig. 1); 4. Inferred true labels would ‘supervise’ all components to learn model parameters (see Fig. 1).\nWe now proceed by introducing these components of the model in further details."

      "text" : "As shown in Table 2, we extract abundant lexical features (Ren et al., 2016; Mintz et al., 2009; Chan and Roth, 2010) to characterize relation mentions. However, this abundance also results in the gigantic dimension of original text features (∼ 107 in our case). In order to achieve better generalization ability, we represent relation mentions with low dimensional (∼ 102) vectors. In Fig. 2, for example, relation mention c3 is first represented as bag-offeatures. After learning text feature embeddings, we use the average of feature embedding vectors to derive the embedding vector for c3. Text Feature Representation. Similar to other principles of embedding learning, we assume text features occurring in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings (also known as distributional hypothesis(Harris, 1954)). Furthermore, we let each text feature’s embedding vector to predict other text features occurred in the same relation mentions or context. Thus, text features with similar meaning should have similar embedding vectors. Formally, we mark text features as F = {f1, · · · , f|F|}, record the feature set for ∀c ∈ C as fc, and represent the embedding vector for fi as vi ∈ Rnv , and we aim to maximize the following\nlog likelihood: ∑ c∈Cl ∑ fi,fj∈fc log p(fi|fj), where\np(fi|fj) = exp(vTi v∗j )/ ∑ fk∈F exp(vTi v ∗ k).\nHowever, the optimization of this likelihood is impractical because the calculation of ∇p(fi|fj) requires summation over all text features, whose size exceeds 107 in our case. In order to perform efficient optimization, we adopt the negative sampling technique (Mikolov et al., 2013) to avoid this summation. Accordingly, we replace the log likelihood with Eq. 1 as below:\nJE = ∑ c∈Cl\nfi,fj∈fc\n(log σ(vTi v ∗ j )− V∑ k=1 Efk′∼P̂ [log σ(−v T i v ∗ k′)])\n(1) where P̂ is noise distribution used in (Mikolov et al., 2013), σ is the sigmoid function and V is number of negative samples. Relation Mention Representation. With text feature embeddings learned by Eq. 1, a naive method to represent relation mentions is to concatenate or average its text feature embeddings. However, text features embedding may be in a different semantic space with relation types. Thus, we directly learn a mapping g from text feature representations to relation mention representations (Van Gysel et al., 2016a,b) instead of simple heuristic rules like concatenate or average (see Fig. 2):\nzc = g(fc) = tanh(W · 1 |fc| ∑ fi∈fc vi) (2)\nwhere zc is the representation of c ∈ Cl, W is a nz × nv matrix, nz is the dimension of relation mention embeddings and tanh is the element-wise hyperbolic tangent function.\nIn other words, we represent bag of text features with their average embedding, then apply linear map and hyperbolic tangent to transform the embedding from text feature semantic space to relation mention semantic space. The non-linear tanh function allows non-linear class boundaries in other components, and also regularize relation mention representation to range [−1, 1] which avoids numerical instability issues."

      "heading" : "3.2 True Label Discovery",
      "text" : "Because heterogeneous supervision generates labels in a discriminative way, we suppose its errors follow certain underlying principles, i.e., if a labeling function annotates a instance correctly / wrongly, it would annotate other similar instances correctly / wrongly. For example, λ1 in Fig. 1 generates wrong annotations for two similar instances c1, c2 and would make the same errors on other similar instances. Since context representation captures the semantic meaning of relation mention and would be used to identify relation types, we also use it to identify the mismatch of context and labeling functions. Thus, we suppose for each labeling function λi, there exists an proficient subset Si onRnz , containing instances that λi can precisely annotate. In Fig. 1, for instance, c3 is in the proficient subset of λ1, while c1 and c2 are not. Moreover, the generation of annotations are not really random, and we propose a probabilistic model to describe the level of mismatch from labeling functions to real relation types instead of annotations’ generation.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, we assume the indicator of whether c belongs to Si, sc,i = δ(c ∈ Si), would first be generated based on context representation\np(sc,i = 1|zc, li) = p(c ∈ Si) = σ(zTc li) (3)\nThen the correctness of annotation oc,i, ρc,i = δ(oc,i = o ∗ c), would be generated. Furthermore, we assume p(ρc,i = 1|sc,i = 1) = φ1 and\np(ρc,i = 1|sc,i = 0) = φ0 to be constant for all relation mentions and labeling functions.\nBecause sc,i would not be used in other components of our framework, we integrate out sc,i and write the log likelihood as\nJT = ∑\noc,i∈O\nlog(σ(zTc li)φ δ(oc,i=o\n∗ c ) 1 (1− φ1) δ(oc,i 6=o∗c )\n+ (1− σ(zTc li))φ δ(oc,i=o\n∗ c ) 0 (1− φ0) δ(oc,i 6=o∗c )) (4)\nNote that o∗c is a hidden variable but not a model parameter, and JT is the likelihood of ρc,i = δ(oc,i = o ∗ c). Thus, we would first infer o ∗ c = argmaxo∗c JT , then train the true label discovery model by maximizing JT ."

Furthermore, we create validation sets by randomly sampling 10% mentions from each test set and used the remaining part as evaluation sets.\nFeature Generation. As summarized in Table 2, we use a 6-word window to extract context features for each entity mention, apply the Stanford CoreNLP tool (Manning et al., 2014) to generate entity mentions and get POS tags for both datasets. Brown clusters(Brown et al., 1992) are derived for each corpus using public implementation2. All these features are shared with all compared methods in our experiments.\nLabeling Functions. In our experiments, labeling functions are employed to encode two kinds of supervision information. One is knowledge base, the other is handcrafted domain-specific patterns. For domain-specific patterns, we manually design a number of labeling functions3; for knowledge base, annotations are generated following the procedure in (Ren et al., 2016; Riedel et al., 2010).\nRegarding two kinds of supervision information, the statistics of the labeling functions are summarized in Table 4. We can observe that heuristic patterns can identify more relation types for KBP datasets, while for NYT datasets, knowledge base can provide supervision for more relation types. This observation aligns with our intuition that single kind of information might be insufficient while different kinds of information can complement each other.\nWe further summarize the statistics of annotations in Table 5. It can be observed that a large portion of instances is only annotated as None,\n2https://github.com/percyliang/ brown-cluster\n3labeling functions can be accessed at: https:// github.com/\nwhile lots of conflicts exist among other instances. This phenomenon justifies the motivation to employ true label discovery model to resolve the conflicts among supervision. Also, we can observe most conflicts involve None type, accordingly, our proposed method should have more advantages over traditional true label discovery methods on the relation extraction task comparing to the relation classification task that excludes None type."

BFK (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) applies bag-offeature kernel to train a support vector machine; DSL (Mintz et al., 2009) trains a multi-class logistic classifier4 on the training data; MultiR (Hoffmann et al., 2011) models training label noise by multi-instance multi-label learning; FCM (Gormley et al., 2015) performs compositional embedding by neural language model. CoType-RM (Ren et al., 2016) adopts partial-label loss to handle label noise and train the extractor.\nMoreover, two different strategies are adopted to feed heterogeneous supervision to these methods. The first is to keep all noisy labels, marked as ‘NL’. Alternatively, a true label discovery method, Investment (Pasternack and Roth, 2010), is applied to resolve conflicts, which is based on the source consistency assumption and iteratively updates inferred true labels and label functions’ reliabilities. Then, the second strategy is to only feed the inferred true labels, referred as ‘TD’.\nEvaluation Metrics. For relation classification task, which excludes None type from training / testing, we use the classification accuracy (Acc) for evaluation, and for relation extraction task, precision (Prec), recall (Rec) and F1 score (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Bach and Badaskar, 2007) are employed.

On the other hand, as discussed in Sec. 4.4, our method introduces context-awareness to true label discovery, while the inferred true label guides the relation extractor achieving the best performance. This observation justifies the motivation of avoiding the source consistency assumption and the effectiveness of proposed true label discovery model.\nOne could also observe the difference between REHESSION and the compared methods is more significant on the NYT dataset than on the WikiKBP dataset. This observation accords with the\nfact that the NYT dataset contains more conflicts than KBP dataset (see Table 5), and the intuition is that our method would have more advantages on more conflicting labels.\nAmong four tasks, the relation classification of Wiki-KBP dataset has highest label quality, i.e. conflicting label ratio, but with least number of training instances. And CoType-RM and DSL reach relatively better performance among all compared methods. CoType-RM performs much better than DSL on Wiki-KBP relation classification task, while DSL gets better or similar performance with CoType-RM on other tasks. This may be because the representation learning method is able to generalize better, thus performs better when the training set size is small. However, it is rather vulnerable to the noisy labels compared to DSL. Our method employs embedding techniques, and also integrates context-aware true label discovery to de-noise labels, making the embedding method rather robust, thus achieves the best performance on all tasks."

For example, our method infers born-in as the true label for the first two relation mentions; after replacing born with other words (elected and examined), our method no longer trusts born-in since the modified contexts are no longer matched, then infers None as the true label.\nEffectiveness of True Label Discovery. We explore the effectiveness of the proposed context-aware true label discovery component by comparing REHESSION to its variant REHESSION-TD, which uses the Investment method to resolve conflicts. The averaged evaluation scores are summarized in Table 7. We can observe that REHESSIONTD achieves much worse performance compared to the REHESSION.

To alleviate the dependency of annotations given by human experts, weak supervision (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Etzioni et al., 2004) and distant supervision (Ren et al., 2016) have been employed to automatically generate annotations based on knowledge base (or seed patterns/instances). Here we propose a more general framework to consolidate heterogeneous information and further refine the true label from noisy labels, which gives the re-\nlation extractor potential to detect more types of relations in a more precise way.\nWord embedding has demonstrated great potential in capturing semantic meaning (Mikolov et al., 2013), and achieved great success in a wide range of NLP tasks like relation extraction (Zeng et al., 2014; Takase and Inui, 2016; Nguyen and Grishman, 2015). In our model, we employed the embedding techniques to represent context information, and reduce the dimension of text features, which allows our model to generalize better.\nTrue Label Discovery. True label discovery methods have been developed to resolve conflicts among multi-source information (Li et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2012; Zhi et al., 2015). Specifically, in the spammer-hammer model (Karger et al., 2013, 2011), each source could either be a spammer, which annotates instances randomly, or a hammer, which annotates instances precisely. In this paper, we assume each labeling function would be a hammer on its proficient subset, and would be a spammer otherwise, while the proficient subsets are identified in the embedding space.\nBesides data programming, socratic learning (Varma et al., 2016) has been developed to conduct binary classification under heterogeneous supervision. Its true label discovery module supervises the discriminative module in label level, while the discriminative module influences the true label discovery module by selecting a feature subset. Although delicately designed, it fails to make full use of the connection between these modules, i.e., not refine the context representation for classifier. Thus, its discriminative module might suffer from the overwhelming size of text features."

Most existing methods have heavy reliance on annotations labeled by human experts, which are costly and time-consuming. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel framework, REHESSION, to conduct relation extractor learning using annotations from heterogeneous information source, e.g., knowledge base and domain heuristics. These annotations, referred as heterogeneous supervision, often conflict with each other, which brings a new challenge to the original relation extraction task: how to infer the true label from noisy labels for a given instance. Identifying context information as the backbone of both relation extraction and true label discovery, we adopt embedding techniques to learn the distributed representations of context, which bridges all components with mutual enhancement in an iterative fashion. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of REHESSION over the state-of-the-art.",
