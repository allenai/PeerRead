      "text" : "Neural networks (NN) with attention mechanisms have recently proven to be successful at different computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as image captioning (Xu et al., 2015), machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and factoid question answering (Hermann et al., 2015). However, most recent work on neural attention models have focused on one-way attention mechanisms based on recurrent neural networks designed\n.\nfor generation tasks.\nAnother important family of machine learning tasks are centered around pair-wise ranking or classification, which have a broad set of applications, including but not limited to, question answering, entailment, paraphrasing and any other pair-wise matching problems. The current state-ofthe-art models usually include NN-based representation for the input pair, followed by a discriminative ranking or classification models. For example, a convolution (or a RNN) and a max-pooling is used to independently construct distributed vector representations of the input pair, followed by a large-margin training (Hu et al., 2014; Weston et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2014; dos Santos et al., 2015).\nThe key contribution of this work is that we propose Attentive Pooling (AP), a two-way attention mechanism, that significantly improves such discriminative models’ performance on pair-wise ranking or classification, by enabling a joint learning of the representations of both inputs as well as their similarity measurement.\nSpecifically, AP enables the pooling layer to be aware of the current input pair, in a way that information from the two input items can directly influence the computation of each other’s representations. The main idea in AP consists of learning a similarity measure over projected segments (e.g. trigrams) of the two items in the input pair, and using the similarity scores between the segments to compute attention vectors in both directions. Next, the attention vectors are used to perform pooling.\nThere are a few key benefits of our model.\n• Thanks to the two-way attention, our model projects the paired inputs, even though they may not be always semantically comparable for some applications (e.g., questions and answers in question answering), into a common representation space that they can be compared in a more plausible way.\n• Our model is effective in matching pairs of inputs with significant length variations.\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n03 60\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n1 Fe\nb 20\n16\n• The two-way attention mechanism is independent of the underlying representation learning. For example, AP can be applied to both CNNs and RNNs, which is in contrast to the one-way attention used in the generation models mostly based on recurrent nets.\nIn this work, we perform an extensive number of experiments on applying attentive pooling CNNs (AP-CNN) and biLSTMs (AP-biLSTM) for the answer selection task. In this task, given a question q and an candidate answer pool P = {a1, a2, · · · , ap} for this question, the goal is to search for and select the candidate answer a ∈ P that correctly answers q. We perform experiments with three publicly available benchmark datasets, which vary in data scale, complexity and length ratios between question and answers: InsuranceQA, TREC-QA and WikiQA. For the three datasets, AP-CNN and AP-biLSTM respectively outperform the CNN and the biLSTM that do not use attention. Additionally, AP-CNN achieves state-of-the-art results for the three datasets.\nOur experimental results also demonstrate that attentive pooling makes the CNN more robust to large input texts. This is an important finding, since recent work have demonstrated that, in the context of semantically equivalent question retrieval, CNN based representations do not scale well with the size of the input text (dos Santos et al., 2015). Additionally, as AP-CNN does not rely only on the final vector representation to capture interactions between the input question and answer, it requires much less convolutional filters than the regular CNN. It means that APCNN-based representations are more compact, which can help to speed up the training process.\nAlthough we demonstrate experimental results for NLP tasks only, AP is a general method that can be also applied to different types of NNs that perform matching of two inputs. Therefore, we believe that AP can be useful for different applications, such as computer vision and bioinformatics.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe two NN architectures for answer selection that have been recently proposed in the literature. In Section 3, we detail the attentive pooling approach. In Section 4, we discuss some related work. Sections 5 and 6 detail our experimental setup and results, respectively. In Section 7 we present our final remarks."

In this section we briefly review two NN\narchitectures that have previously been applied to the answer selection task: QA-CNN (Feng et al., 2015) and QAbiLSTM (Tan et al., 2015). Given a pair (q, a) consisting of a question q and a candidate answer a, both networks score the pair by first computing fixed-length independent continuous vector representations rq and ra, and then computing the cosine similarity between these two vectors.\nIn Figure 1 we present a joint illustration of these two neural networks. The first layer in both QA-CNN and QAbiLSTM transforms each input word w into a fixed-size real-valued word embedding rw ∈ Rd. Word embeddings (WEs) are encoded by column vectors in an embedding matrix W 0 ∈ Rd×|V |, where V is a fixed-sized vocabulary and d is the dimention of the word embeddings. Given the input pair (q, a), where the question q contains M tokens and the candidate answer a contains L tokens, the output of the first layer consists of two sequences of word embeddings qemb = {rw1 , ..., rwM } and aemb = {rw1 , ..., rwL}. Next, QA-CNN and QA-biLSTM use different approaches to process these sequences. While QA-CNN process both qemb and aemb using a convolution, QA-biLSTM uses a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory RNN (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) to process these sequences."

The output of the convolution with c filters over the question q is computed as follows:\nQ =W 1Zq + b1 (1)\nwhere each column m in Q ∈ Rc×M contains features extracted in a context window around them-th word of q.

      "text" : "Our LSTM implementation is similar to the one in (Graves et al., 2013) with minor modification.

The input gate can determine how incoming vectors rwt alter the state of the memory cell. The output gate can allow the memory cell to have an effect on the outputs. Finally, the forget gate allows the cell to remember or forget its previous state. W ∈ RH×d, U ∈ RH×H and b ∈ RH×1 are the network parameters.\nSingle direction LSTMs suffer a weakness of not utilizing the contextual information from the future tokens. Bidirectional LSTM utilizes both the previous and future context by processing the sequence on two directions, and generate two independent sequences of LSTM output vectors. One processes the input sequence in the forward direction, while the other processes the input in the reverse direction.\nThe output at each time step is the concatenation of the two output vectors from both directions, ie. ht = −→ ht ‖ ←− ht . We define c = 2×H for the notation consistency with the previous subsection. After computing the hidden state ht for each time step t, we generate the matrices Q ∈ Rc×M and A ∈ Rc×L, where the j-th column in Q (A) corresponds to j-th hidden state hj that is computed by the biLSTM when processing q (a). The same network parameters are used to process both questions and candidate answers."

As in (Weston et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2014), we define the training objective as a hinge loss:\nL = max{0,m− sθ(q, a+) + sθ(q, a−)} (12)\nwhere m is constant margin, sθ(q, a+) and sθ(q, a−) are scores generated by the network with parameter set θ. During training, for each question we randomly sample 50 negative answers from the entire answer set, but only use the one with the highest score to update the model.\nWe use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the loss function with respect to θ. The backpropagation algorithm is used to compute the gradients of the network."

The main idea consists of learning a similarity measure over the projected segments in the input pairs, and uses the similarity scores between the segments to compute attention vectors. When AP is applied to CNN, which we call AP-CNN, the network learns the similarity measure over the convolved input sequences. When AP is applied to biLSTM, which we call AP-biLSTM, the network learns the similarity measure over the hidden states produced by the biLSTM when processing the two input sequences. We use a similarity measure that has a bilinear form but followed by a non-linearity.\nIn Fig. 2, we illustrate the application of AP over the output of the convolution or the biLSTM to construct the representations rq and ra. Consider the input pair (q, a) where the question has size M and the answer has size L1. After we compute the matrices Q ∈ Rc×M and A ∈ Rc×L, either by convolution or biLSTM, we compute the matrix G ∈ RM×L as follows:\nG = tanh ( QTUA ) (13)\nwhere U ∈ Rc×c is a matrix of parameters to be learned by the NN. When the convolution is used to compute Q and A, the matrix G contains the scores of a soft alignment between the convolved k-size context windows of q and a. When the biLSTM is used to compute Q and A, the matrix G contains the scores of a soft alignment between the hidden vectors of each token in q and a.\nNext, we apply column-wise and row-wise max-poolings over G to generate the vectors gq ∈ RM and ga ∈ RL, respectively. Formally, the j-th elements of the vectors gq and ga are computed as follows:\n[gq]j = max 1<m<M [Gj,m] (14)\n[ga]j = max 1<l<L [Gl,j ] (15)\nWe can interpret each element j of the vector ga as an importance score for the context around the j-th word in the candidate answer a with regard to the question q. Likewise, each element j of the vector gq can be interpreted as the importance score for the context around the j-th word in the question q with regard to the candidate answer a.\nNext, we apply the softmax function to the vectors gq and ga to create attention vectors σq and σa. For instance, the j-th element of the vector σq is computed as follows:\n[σq]j = e[g q ]j∑ 1<l<M e[g q ]l\n(16)\n1In Fig. 2, q has a size of five and a has a size of seven.\nFinally, the representations rq and ra are computed as the dot product between the attention vectors σq and σa and the output of the convolution (or biLSTM) over q and a, respectively:\nrq = Qσq (17)\nra = Aσa (18)\nLike in QA-CNN and QA-biLSTM, the final score is also computed using the cosine similarity between rq and ra. We use SGD to train AP-CNN and AP-biLSTM by minimizing the same pairwise loss function used in QA-CNN and QA-biLSTM."

      "text" : "Traditional work on answer selection have normally used feature engineering, linguistic tools, or external resources (Yih et al., 2013; Wang & Manning, 2010; Wang et al., 2007). Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches have been exploited for this task and achieved significant outperformance compared to traditional non-DL methods. For example, in (Yu et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2015; Severyn & Moschitti, 2015), the authors generate the representations of questions and answers separately, and score a QA pair using a similarity metric on top of these representations. In Wang & Nyberg (2015), first a joint feature vectors is learned from a joint long short-term memory (LSTM) model connecting questions and answers, and then the task is converted into a learning-to-rank problem.\nAt the same time, attention-based systems have shown very promising results on a variety of NLP tasks, such as machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sutskever et al., 2014), caption generation (Xu et al., 2015) and factoid question answering (Hermann et al., 2015). Such models learn to focus their attention to specific parts of their input.\nSome recently-proposed approaches introduce attention mechanisms in the answer selection task. Tan et al. (2015) developed an attentive reader based on bidirectional long short-term memory, which emphasizes certain part of the answer according to the question embedding. Unlike (Tan et al., 2015), in which attention is imposed only on answer embedding generation, AP-CNN and AP-biLSTM consider the interdependence between questions and answers.\nIn the context of two-way attention, two very recent work are related to ours. Rocktäschel et al. (2015), propose a two-way attention method that is inspired by bidirectional LSTMs that read a sequence and its reverse for improved encoding. Their approach, which is designed for RNNs only, differs in many aspects from the approach described in this work, which can be easily applied for CNNs and RNNs. Yin et al. (2015) present a two-way attention mechanism that is tailored to CNNs. Some of the main differ-\nences between their approach and this work are: (1) they use a simple Euclidean distance to compute the interdependence between the two input texts, while in this work we apply similarity metric learning, which has the potential to learn better ways to measure the interaction between segments of the input items; (2) the models in (Yin et al., 2015) compute the attention vector using sum-pooling over the alignment matrix and use the convolutional outputs updated by the attention as the input for another level of convolutional layer. In this work we use max-pooling over the alignment matrix plus softmax, in order to explicitly create an attention vector that is used to perform the pooling. Experimental results show that such difference yields substantial improvement of performance on WikiQA dataset."

On the bottom part of this table, we can see that AP-CNN outperforms QA-CNN by a large margin in both test sets, as well as in the dev set. AP-biLSTM also outperforms the QA-biLSTM in all the three sets. AP-CNN and APbiLSTM have similar performance.\nOn the top part of Table 3 we present the results of two state-of-the-art systems for this dataset. In (Feng et al., 2015), the authors present a CNN architecture that is similar to QA-CNN, but that uses a different similarity metric instead of cosine similarity. In (Tan et al., 2015), the authors use a biLTSM architecture that employs unidirectional attention. Both AP-CNN and AP-biLSTM outperform the state-of-the-art systems.\nOne important characteristic of AP-CNN is that it requires less convolutional filters than QA-CNN. For the InsuranceQA dataset, AP-CNN uses 10x less filters (400) than QA-CNN (4000). Using 800 filters in AP-CNN produces very similar results as using 400. On the other hand, as also found in (Feng et al., 2015), QA-CNN requires at least 2000 filters to achieve more than 60% accuracy on Insur-\nanceQA. AP-CNN needs less filters because it does not rely only on the final vector representation to capture interactions between the input question and answer. As a result, although AP-CNN has a more complex architecture, its training time is two times faster than QA-CNN. Using a Tesla K20Xm, our Theano implementation of AP-CNN takes about 16 minutes to complete one epoch (training + inference over validation set) for InsuranceQA, which consists on processing 1.5 million text segments.\nIn figures 3 and 4, we plot the aggregated accuracy of AP-CNN and QA-CNN for answers up to a certain length for the Test1 and Test2 sets, respectively. We can see in both plots that the performance of both system is better for shorter answers. However, while the performance of QA-CNN continues to drop as larger answers are considered, the performance of AP-CNN seems to be stable after reaching a length of∼90 tokens. These results give support to our hypothesis that attentive pooling helps the CNN to become robust to larger input texts."

In the context of pair-wise ranking or classification with neural networks, AP enables the pooling layer to be aware of the current input pair, in a way that information from the two input items can directly influence the computation of each other’s representations. Along with such representations of the paired inputs, AP jointly learns a similarity measure over projected segments (e.g. trigrams) of the pair, and subsequently, derives the corresponding attention vector for each input to guide the pooling. Our two-way attention mechanism is a general framework independent of the underlying representation learning, and it has been applied to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in our studies. The empirical results, from three very different benchmark tasks of question answering/answer selection, demonstrate that our proposed models outperform a variety of strong baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance in all the benchmarks.",
