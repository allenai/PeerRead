Mandic (2017), “Tensor Networks for Dimensionality Reduction and Large-scale Optimization: Part 2 Applications and Future perspectives”, Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning: Vol. 9: No. 6, pp 431-673.\nAbstract\nPart 2 of this monograph builds on the introduction to tensor networks and their operations presented in Part 1. It focuses on tensor network models for super-compressed higher-order representation of data/parameters and related cost functions, while providing an outline of their applications in machine learning and data analytics.\nA particular emphasis is on the tensor train (TT) and Hierarchical Tucker (HT) decompositions, and their physically meaningful interpretations which reflect the scalability of the tensor network approach. Through a graphical approach, we also elucidate how, by virtue of the underlying low-rank tensor approximations and sophisticated contractions of core tensors, tensor networks have the ability to perform distributed computations on otherwise prohibitively large volumes of data/parameters, thereby alleviating or even eliminating the curse of dimensionality.\nThe usefulness of this concept is illustrated over a number of applied areas, including generalized regression and classification (support tensor machines, canonical correlation analysis, higher order partial least squares), generalized eigenvalue decomposition, Riemannian optimization, and in the optimization of deep neural networks.\nPart 1 and Part 2 of this work can be used either as stand-alone separate texts, or indeed as a conjoint comprehensive review of the exciting field of low-rank tensor networks and tensor decompositions.\n1\nChapter 1\nTensorization and Structured Tensors\nThe concept of tensorization refers to the generation of higher-order structured tensors from the lower-order data formats (e.g., vectors, matrices or even low-order tensors), or the representation of very large scale system parameters in low-rank tensor formats. This is an essential step prior to multiway data analysis, unless the data itself is already collected in a multiway format; examples include color image sequences where the R, G and B frames are stacked into a 3rd-order tensor, or multichannel EEG signals combined into a tensor with modes, e.g., channel ˆ time ˆ epoch. For any given original data format, the tensorization procedure may affect the choice and performance of a tensor decomposition in the next stage.\nEntries of the so constructed tensor can be obtained through: i) a particular rearrangement, e.g., reshaping of the original data to a tensor, ii) alignment of data blocks or epochs, e.g., slices of a third-order tensor are epochs of multi-channel EEG signals, or iii) data augmentation through, e.g., Toeplitz and Hankel matrices/tensors. In addition, tensorization of fibers of a lower-order tensor will yield a tensor of higher order. A tensor can also be generated using transform-domain methods, for example, by a time-frequency transformation via the short time Fourier transform or wavelet transform. The latter procedure is most common for multichannel data, such as EEG, where, e.g., S channels of EEG are recorded over T time samples, to produce S matrices of F ˆ T dimensional time-frequency spectrograms stacked together into an F ˆ T ˆ S dimensional third-order tensor. A tensor can also represent the\n2\ndata at multi-scale and orientation levels by using, e.g., the Gabor, countourlet, or pyramid steerable transformations. When exploiting statistical independence of latent variables, tensors can be generated by means of higher-order statistics (cumulants) or by partial derivatives of the Generalised Characteristic Functions (GCF) of the observations. Such tensors are usually partially or fully symmetric, and their entries represent mutual interaction between latent variables. This kind of tensorization is commonly used in ICA, BSS and blind identification of a mixing matrix. In a similar way, a symmetric tensor can be generated through measures of distances between observed entities, or their information exchange. For example, a third-order tensor, created to analyse common structures spread over EEG channels, can comprise distance matrices of pair-wise correlation or other metrics, such as causality over trials. A symmetric third-order tensor can involve three-way similarities. For such a tensorization, symmetric tensor decompositions with nonnegativity constraints are particularly well-suited.\nTensorization can also be performed through a suitable representation of the estimated parameters in some low-rank tensor network formats. This method is often used when the number of estimated parameters is huge, e.g., in modelling system response in a nonlinear system, in learning weights in a deep learning network. In this way, computation on the parameters, e.g., multiplication, convolution, inner product, Fourier transform, can be performed through core tensors of smaller scale.\nOne of the main motivations to develop various types of tensorization is to take advantage of data super-compression inherent in tensor network formats, especially in quantized tensor train (QTT) formats. In general, the type of tensorization depends on a specific task in hand and the structure presented in data. The next sections introduce some common tensorization methods employed in blind source separation, harmonic retrieval, system identification, multivariate polynomial regression, and nonlinear feature extraction."

      "heading" : "1.1 Reshaping or Folding",
      "text" : "The simplest way of tensorization is through the reshaping or folding operations, also known as segmentation [Boussé et al., 2015, Debals and De Lathauwer, 2015]. This type of tensorization preserves the number of original data entries and their sequential ordering, as it only rearranges a vector to a matrix or tensor. Hence, folding does not require additional\n3\nmemory space. Folding. A tensor Y of size I1 ˆ I2 ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ IN is considered a folding of a vector y of length I1 I2 ¨ ¨ ¨ IN , if\nY(i1, i2, . . . , iN) = y(i) , (1.1)\nfor all 1 ď in ď In, where i = 1 + řN n=1(in ´ 1) śn´1\nk=1 Ik is a linear index of (i1, i2, . . . , i2).\nIn other words, the vector y is vectorization of the tensor Y, while Y is a tensorization of y.\nAs an example, the arrangement of elements in a matrix of size Iˆ L/I, which is folded from a vector y of length L is given by\nY =  y(1) y(I + 1) ¨ ¨ ¨ y(L´ I + 1) y(2) y(I + 2) ¨ ¨ ¨ y(L´ I + 2) ... ... . . . ...\ny(I) y(2I) ¨ ¨ ¨ y(L)  . (1.2) Higher-order folding/reshaping refers to the application of the folding procedure several times, whereby a vector y P RI1 I2¨¨¨IN is converted into an Nth-order tensor of size I1 ˆ I2 ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ IN . Application to BSS. It is important to notice that a higher-order folding (quantization) of a vector of length qN (q = 2, 3, . . .), sampled from an exponential function yk = azk´1, yields an Nth-order tensor of rank 1. Moreover, wide classes of functions formed by products and/or sums of trigonometric, polynomial and rational functions can be quantized in this way to yield (approximate) low-rank tensor train (TT) network formats [Khoromskij, 2011a,b, Oseledets, 2012]. Exploitation of such low-rank representations allows us to separate the signals from a single or a few mixtures, as outlined below.\nConsider a single mixture, y(t), which is composed of J component signals, xj(t), j = 1, . . . , J, and corrupted by additive Gaussian noise, n(t), to give\ny(t) = a1x1(t) + a2x2(t) + ¨ ¨ ¨+ aJ xJ(t) + n(t). (1.3)\nThe aim is to extract the unknown sources (components) xj(t) from the observed signal y(t). Assume that higher-order foldings, Xj, of the component signals, xj(t), have low-rank representations in, e.g., the CP or Tucker format, given by\nXj = JGj; U (1) j , U (2) j , . . . , U (N) j K ,\n4\nor in the TT format\nXj = xxG (1) j , G (2) j , . . . , G (N) j yy,\nor in any other tensor network format. Because of the multi-linearity of this tensorization, the following relation between the tensorization of the mixture, Y, and the tensorization of the hidden components, Xj, holds\nY = a1X1 + a2X2 + ¨ ¨ ¨+ aJXJ + N , (1.4) where N is the tensorization of the noise n(t).\nNow, by a decomposition of Y into J blocks of tensor networks, each corresponding to a tensor network (TN) representation of a hidden component signal, we can find approximations of Xj and the separate component signals up to a scaling ambiguity. The separation method can be used in conjunction with the Toeplitz and Hankel foldings. Example 9 illustrates the separation of damped sinusoid signals."

Then, we use the rows Y(k, :) to generate Toeplitz matrices, Yk of size I2ˆ I3.

      "text" : "The Hankel and Toeplitz foldings are multilinear tensorizations, and can be applied to the BSS problem, as in (1.4). When the Hankel and Toeplitz tensors of the hidden sources are of low-rank in some tensor network representation, the tensor of the mixture is expressed as a sum of low rank tensor terms.\nFor example, the Hankel and Toeplitz matrices/tensors of an exponential function, vk = azk´1, are rank-1 matrices/tensors, and consequently Hankel matrices/tensors of sums and/or products of exponentials, sinusoids, and polynomials will also be of low-rank, which is equal to the degree of the function being considered.\nHadamard Product. More importantly, when Hankel/Toeplitz tensors of two vectors u and v have low-rank CP/TT representations, the Hankel/Toeplitz tensor of their element-wise product, w = uf v, can also be represented in the same CP/TT tensor format\nH(u)fH(v) = H(uf v) T (u)f T (v) = T (uf v) .\nThe CP/TT rank of H(uf v) or T (uf v) is not larger than the product of the CP/TT ranks of the tensors of u and v.\nExample 5\n15\nThe third-order Hankel tensor of u(t) = sin(ωt) is a rank-3 tensor, and the third-order Hankel tensor of v(t) = t is of rank-2; hence the Hankel tensor of the w(t) = t sin(ωt) has at most rank-6. Symmetric CP and Vandermonde decompositions. It is important to notice that a Hankel tensor Y of size I ˆ I ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ I can always be represented by a symmetric CP decomposition\nY = Iˆ1 Aˆ2 A ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN A .\nMoreover, the tensor Y also admits a symmetric CP decomposition with Vandermonde structured factor matrix [Qi, 2015]\nY = diagN(λ)ˆ1 V T ˆ2 VT ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN VT , (1.19)\nwhere λ comprises R non-zero coefficients, and V is a Vandermonde matrix generated from R distinct values v = [v1, v2, . . . , vR]\nV =  1 v1 v21 . . . v I´1 1 1 v2 v22 . . . v I´1 2 ... ... ... . . .\n... 1 vR v2R . . . v I´1 R  . (1.20) By writing the decomposition in (1.19) for the entries Y(I1, . . . , In´1, : , 1, . . . , 1) (see (1.12)), the Vandermonde decomposition of the Hankel tensor Y becomes a Vandermonde factorization of y [Chen, 2016], given by\ny =  1 1 . . . 1 v1 v2 . . . vR v21 v 2 2 . . . v 2 R ... ... . . . ...\nvL´11 v L´1 2 . . . v L´1 R\n λ .\nObserve that various Vandermonde decompositions of the Hankel tensors of the same vector y, but of different tensor orders N, have the same generating Vandermonde vector v. Moreover, the Vandemonde rank, i.e, the minimum of R in the decomposition (1.19), therefore cannot exceed the length L of the generating vector y.\nQTT representation of Toeplitz/Hankel tensor. As mentioned previously, the zero-padded convolution tensor of (N + 1)th-order can be represented\n16\nin a QTT format of rank of at most N. Hence, if a vector y of length 2D N has a QTT representation of rank-(R1, . . . , RD), given by\ny = rY(1) |b| rY(2) |b| ¨ ¨ ¨ |b| rY(D+1) , (1.21)\nwhere rY(d) is an Rd´1ˆRd block matrix of the core tensor Y(d) of size Rd´1ˆ 2ˆ Rd, for d = 1, . . . , D, or of Y(D+1) of size RD ˆ N ˆ 1, then following the relation between the convolution tensor and the Toeplitz tensor of the generating vector y, we have\nT (y) = C ¯̂ N+1 y . (1.22)\nThis Nth-order Toeplitz tensor can also be represented by a QTT tensor with rank of at most N(R1, . . . , RD), as\nT (y) = rT(1) |b| rT(2) |b| ¨ ¨ ¨ |b| rT(D) , (1.23)\nwhere rT (d)\nis a block tensor of the core tensor T(d). The core T(1) is of size 1 ˆ 2 ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ 2 ˆ N R1, and cores T(2), . . . , T(D´1) are of size NRd´1 ˆ 2 ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ 2 ˆ NRd, while the last core tensor T(D) is of size NRD´1 ˆ 2ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ 2ˆ 1. These core tensors are core contractions between the two core tensors C(d) and Y(d). Figure 1.3 illustrates the generation of a Toeplitz matrix as a tensor-vector product of a third-order convolution tensor C and a generating vector, x, of length 2D+1, both in QTT-formats. The core tensors of C are given in Example 3.\nRemarks:\n• Because of zero-padding within the convolution tensor, the Toeplitz tensor of y, generated in (1.22) and (1.23), takes only entries y(N), y(N + 1), . . . , y(2D N), i.e., it corresponds to the Toeplitz tensor of the generating vector y(N), y(N + 1), . . . , y(2D N).\n• The Hankel tensor also admits a QTT representation in the similar form to a Toeplitz tensor (cf. (1.23)).\n• Low-rank TN representation of the Toeplitz and Hankel tensors has been exploited, e.g., in blind source separation and harmonic retrieval. By verifying a low-rank TN representation of the signal in hand, we can confirm the existence of a low-rank TN representation of Toeplitz/Hankel tensors of the signal.\n17\n• QTT rank of the Toeplitz tensor in (1.23) is at most N times the QTT rank of the generating vector y. The rank may not be minimal. For example, the sinusoid signal is of rank-2 in QTT format, and its Toeplitz tensor also has a rank-2 QTT representation.\n• Fast convolution of vectors in QTT formats. A straightforward consequences is that when vectors xn are given in their QTT formats, their convolution x1 ˚ x2 ˚ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˚ xN can be computed through core contractions between the core tensors of the convolution tensor and those of the vectors."

When considered as transfer functions, such type of approximations are much more powerful than the polynomial approximations, as in this way it is also possible to model discontinuities and spiky data. The optimal order of such a rational approximation is given by the rank of the Löwner matrix. In the context of tensors, this allows us to construct a model of the original dataset which is amenable to higherorder tensor representation, has minimal computational complexity, and for which the accuracy is governed by the rank of the Löwner matrix.

More applications of this tensorization can be found in [Debals et al., 2016a].\n1.4 Tensorization based on Cumulant and Derivatives of the Generalised Characteristic Functions\nThe use of higher-order statistics (cumulants) or partial derivatives of the Generalised Characteristic Functions (GCF) as a means of tensorization is useful in the identification of a mixing matrix in a blind source separation.\nConsider linear mixtures of R stationary sources, S, received by an array of I sensors in the presence of additive noise, N (see Figure 1.4 for a general principle). The task is to estimate a mixing matrix H P RIˆR from only the knowledge of the noisy observations\nX = HS + N , (1.24)\nunder some mild assumptions, i.e., the sources are statistically independent and non-Gaussian, their number is known, and the matrix H has no pairwise collinear columns (see also [Comon and Rajih, 2006, Yeredor, 2000])\nA well-known approach to this problem is based on the decomposition of a high dimensional structured tensor, Y, generated from the observations, X, by means of partial derivatives of the second GCFs of the observations at multiple processing points. Derivatives of the GCFs. More specifically, we next show how to generate the tensor Y from the observation, X. We shall denote the first and second GCFs of the observations evaluated at a vector u of length I, respectively by\nφx(u) = E [ exp(uTx) ] , Φx(u) = log φx(u) . (1.25)\nSimilarly, φs(v) and Φs(v) designate the first and second GCFs of the sources, where v is of length R. Because the sources are statistically\n19\nindependent, the following holds\nΦs(v) = Φs1(v1) + Φs2(v2) + ¨ ¨ ¨+ ΦsR(vR) , (1.26)\nwhich implies that Nth-order derivatives of Φs(v) with respect to v result in Nth-order diagonal tensors of size Rˆ Rˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ R, where N = 2, 3, . . ., that is\nΨs(v) = BNΦs(v) BvN = diagN \" dNΦs1 dvN1 , dNΦs2 dvN2 , . . . , dNΦsR dvNR * . (1.27)\nIn addition, for the noiseless case x(t) = H s(t), and since Φx(u) = Φs(HTu), the Nth-order derivative of Φx(u) with respect to u yields a symmetric tensor of Nth-order which admits a CP decomposition of rankR with N identical factor matrices H, to give\nΨx(u) = Ψs(H Tu)ˆ1 Hˆ2 H ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN H . (1.28)\n20\nIn order to improve the identification accuracy, the mixing matrix H should be estimated as a joint factor matrix in decompositions of various derivative tensors, evaluated at distinct processing points u1, u2, . . . , uK. This is equivalent to a decomposition of an (N + 1)th-order tensor Y of size I ˆ I ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ I ˆ K concatenated from the K derivative tensors as\nY(:, . . . , :, k) = Ψx(uk), k = 1, 2, . . . , K. (1.29)\nThe CP decomposition of the tensor Y can be written in form of\nY = Iˆ1 Hˆ2 H ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN HˆN+1 D , (1.30)\nwhere the last factor matrix D is of size Kˆ R, and each row comprises the diagonal of the symmetric tensor Ψs(HTuk).\nIn the presence of statistically independent, additive and stationary Gaussian noise, we can eliminate the derivatives of the noise terms in the derivative tensor Ψx(u) by subtracting any other derivative tensor Ψx(ũ), or by an average of derivative tensors. Estimation of Derivatives of GCF. In practice, the GCF of the observation and its derivatives are unknown, but can be estimated from the sample first GCF [Yeredor, 2000]. Detailed expression and the approximation of the derivative tensor Ψx(u) for some low orders N = 2, 3, . . . , 7, are given in Appendix 1. Cumulants. When the derivative is taken at the origin, u = [0, . . . , 0]T, the tensor K(N)x = Ψ(N)x (0) is known as the Nth-order cumulant of x, and a joint diagonalization or the CP decomposition of higher-order cumulants is a well-studied method for the estimation of the mixing matrix H.\nFor the sources with symmetric probabilistic distributions, their oddorder cumulants, N = 3, 5, . . ., are zero, and the cumulants of the mixtures are only due to noise. Hence, a decomposition of such tensors is not able to retrieve the mixing matrix. However, the odd-order cumulant tensors can be used to subtract the noise term in the derivative tensors evaluated at other processing points.\nExample 6 Blind identification (BI) in a system of 2 mixtures and R binary signals.\nTo illustrate the efficiency of higher-order derivatives of the second GCF in blind identification we considered a system of two mixtures, I = 2, linearly composed by R signals of length T = 100ˆ 2R, the entries of which can take the values 1 or ´1, i.e., sr,t = 1 or ´1. The mixing matrix H of size 2ˆ R was randomly generated, where R = 4, 6, 8. The signal-to-noise ratio\n21\nwas SNR = 20 dB. The main purpose of BI is to estimate the mixing matrix H.\nWe constructed 50 tensors Yi (i = 1, . . . , 50) of size R ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ R ˆ 3, which comprise three derivative tensors evaluated at the two leading left singular vectors of X, and a unit-length processing point, generated such that its collinearity degree with the first singular vector uniformly distributed over a range of [´0.99, 0.99]. The average derivative tensor was used to eliminate the noise term in Yi.\nCP decomposition of derivative tensors. The tensors Yi were decomposed by CP decompositions of rank-R to retrieve the mixing matrix H. The mean of Squared Angular Errors SAE(hr, ĥr) = ´20 log10 arccos( hTr ĥr |hr|2|ĥr|2\n) over all columns hr was computed as a performance index for one estimation of the mixing matrix.\nThe averages of the mean and best MSAEs over 100 independent runs for the number of the unknown sources R = 4, 6, 8 are plotted in Figure 1.5. The results indicate that with a suitably chosen processing point, the decomposition of the derivative tensors yielded good estimation of the mixing matrix. Of more importance is that higher-order derivative tensors, e.g., 7th and 8th orders, yielded better performance than lowerorder tensors, while the estimation accuracy deteriorated with the number of sources.\nCP decomposition of cumulant tensors. Because of symmetric pdfs, the odd order cumulants of the sources are zero. Only decompositions of cumulants of order 6 or 8 were able to retrieve the mixing matrix H. For all the test cases, better performances could be obtained by a decomposition of three derivative tensors.\nTensor train decomposition of derivative tensors. The estimation of the mixing matrix H can be performed in a two-stage decomposition\n• A tensor train decomposition of high-order derivative tensors, e.g., tensor order exceeds 5.\n• A CP decomposition of the tensor in TT-format, to retrieve the mixing matrix.\nExperimental results confirmed that the performances with prior TTdecomposition were more stable and yielded an approximately 2 dB higher mean SAE than those using only CP decomposition for derivative tensors of orders 7 and 8 and a relatively high number of unknown sources.\n22"

      "text" : "Another method to generate tensors of relatively high order in BSS is through modelling modulus of the estimated signals as roots of a polynomial.\nConsider a linear mixing system X = HS with R sources of length K, and I mixtures, where the modulus of the sources S is drawn from a set of given moduli. For simplicity, we assume I = R. For example, the binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signal in telecommunication consists of a sequence of 1 and ´1, hence, it has a constant modulus of unity. The quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signal takes one of the values ˘1˘ 1i, i.e., it has a constant modulus ? 2. The 16-QAM signal has three squared moduli of 2, 10 and 18. For this BSS problem for single constant modulus signals, Lathauwer [2004] linked the problem to CP decomposition of a fourth-order tensor. For multi-constant modulus signals, Debals et al. [2016b] established a link to a coupled CP decomposition.\n23\nA common method to extract the original sources S is to use a demixing matrix W of size I ˆ R or a vector w of length I such that y = wTX is an estimate of one of the source signals. The constant modulus constraints require that each entry, |yk|, must be one of given moduli, c1, c2, . . . , cM. This means that for all entries of y the following holds\nf (yk) = M ź\nm=1\n(|yk|2 ´ cm) = 0 .

(1.32)\nBy expressing |yk|2 = (wbw˚)T(xk b x˚k ), and\n|yk|2m = (wbm b (wbm)˚)T(xbmk b (x bm k ) ˚) ,\nwhere the symbol “˚” represents the complex conjugate, xbm = x b x b ¨ ¨ ¨ b x denotes the Kronecker product of m vectors x, and bearing in mind that the rank-1 tensors w˝m = w ˝w ˝ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˝w are symmetric, and in general have only (R+m´1)!m!(R´1)! distinct coefficients, the rank-1 tensors w ˝m ˝ (w˝m)˚\nhave at least ( (R+m´1)! m!(R´1)! )2 distinct entries. We next introduce the operator K which keeps only distinct entries of the symmetric tensor w˝m ˝ (w˝m)˚ or of the vector wbm b (wbm)˚. The constant modulus constraint of yk can then be rewritten as\nf (yk) = α1 + M+1 ÿ\nm=2\nαm(wbm b (wbm)˚)T(xbmk b (x bm k ) ˚)\n= α1 + M+1 ÿ\nm=2\nαm(K(wbm b (wbm)˚))T diag(dm)K(xbmk b (x bm k ) ˚)\n= α1 + [ . . . , (K(wbm b (wbm)˚))T, . . . ] [. . . ,K(xbmk b (x bm k ) ˚)T diag(αmdm), . . .]T ,\n24\nwhere dm(i) represents the number of occurrences of an entry of K(xbmk b (xbmk ) ˚) in xbmk b (x bm k )\n˚. The vector of the constant modulus constraints of y is now given by\nf = [. . . , f (yk), . . .]T = α11 + Qv , (1.33)\nwhere\nv =  ...\nK(wbm b (wbm)˚) ...\n , Q =  ... diag(αmdm)K(Xdm d (Xdm)˚)\n...\n T .\nThe constraint vector is zero for the exact case, and should be small for the noisy case. For the exact case, from (1.33) and f (yk+1) ´ f (yk) = 0, this leads to\nLQv = 0 ,\nwhere L is the first-order Laplacian implying that the vector v is in the null space of the matrix Q̃ = LQ. The above condition holds for other demixing vectors w, i.e., Q̃V = 0, where V = [v1, . . . , vR], and each vr is constructed from a corresponding demixing vector wr.\nWith the assumption I = R, and that the sources have complex values, and the mixing matrix does not have collinear columns, it can be shown that the kernel of the matrix Q̃ has the dimension of R [Debals et al., 2016b]. Therefore, the basis vectors, zr, r = 1, . . . , R, of the kernel of Q̃ can be represented as linear combination of V, that is\nzr = Vλr .\nNext we partition zr into M parts, zr = [zrm], each of the length( (R+m´1)! m!(R´1)! )2 , which can be expressed as\nzrm = R ÿ\ns=1\nλrsK(wbms b (wbms )˚) = K ( R ÿ\ns=1\nλrswbms b (wbms )˚ ) ,\nthus implying that W and W˚ are factor matrices of a symmetric tensor Zrm of (2m)th-order, constructed from the vector zrm, i.e., K(vec(Zrm)) = zrm, in the form\nZrm = Jdiag2m(λr); W, . . . , Wloooomoooon m terms , W˚, . . . , W˚ loooooomoooooon m terms K . (1.34)\n25\nBy concatenating all R tensors Z1m, . . . , ZRm into one (2m + 1)th-order tensor Zm, the above R CP decompositions become\nZm = JI; W, . . . , Wloooomoooon m terms , W˚, . . . , W˚ loooooomoooooon m terms , ΛK . (1.35)\nAll together, the M CP decompositions of Z1, . . . , ZM form a coupled CP tensor decomposition to find the two matrices W and Λ.\nExample 7 [Separation of QAM signals.] We performed the separation of two rectangular 32- or 64-QAM signals of length 1000 from two mixture signals corrupted by additive Gaussian noise with SNR = 15 dB. Columns of the real-valued mixing matrix had unit-length, and a pair-wise collinearity of 0.4. The 32-QAM signal had M = 5 constant moduli of 2, 10, 18, 26 and 34, whereas the 64-QAM signal had M = 9 squared constant moduli of 2, 10, 18, 26, 34, 50, 58, 74 and 98. Therefore, for the first case (32-QAM), the demixing matrix was estimated from 5 tensors of size 2 ˆ 2 ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ 2 and of respective orders 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, while for the later case (64-QAM), we decomposed 9 quantized tensors of orders 3, 5, . . . , 19. The estimated QAM signals for the two cases were perfectly reconstructed with zero bit error rates. Scatter plots of the recovered signals are shown in Figure 1.6."

      "text" : "The Multivariate Polynomial Regression (MPR) is an extension of the linear and multilinear regressions which allows us to model nonlinear interaction between independent variables [Billings, 2013, Chen and Billings, 1989, Vaccari, 2003]. For illustration, consider a simple example of fitting a curve to data with two independent variables x1 and x2, in the form\ny = w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + w12x1x2 . (1.38)\nThe term w12 then quantifies the strength of interaction between the two independent variables in the data, x1 and x2. Observe that the model is still linear with respect to the variables x1 and x2, while involving the crossterm w12x1x2. The above model can also have more terms, e.g., x21, x1x 2 2, to describe more complex functional behaviours. For example, the full quadratic polynomial regression for two independent variables, x1 and x2, can have up to 9 terms, given by\ny = w0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + w12x1x2 +w11x21 + w22x 2 2 + w112x 2 1x2 + w122x1x 2 2 + w1122x 2 1x 2 2 .

However, since the number of parameters in the model in (1.41) grows exponentially with the number of variables, N, the MPR demands a huge amount of data in order to yield a good model, and therefore, it is computationally intensive in a raw tensor format, and thus\n30\nnot suitable for very high-dimensional data. To this end, low-rank tensor network representation emerges as a viable approach to accomplishing MPR. For example, the weight tensor W can be constrained to be in low rank TT-format [Chen et al., 2016]. An alternative approach would be to consider a truncated model which takes only two entries along each mode of W in (1.41). In other words, this truncated model becomes linear with respect to each variable xn [Novikov et al., 2016], leading to\ny = Wt ¯̂ 1 [ 1 x1 ] ¯̂ 2 [ 1 x2 ] ¨ ¨ ¨ ¯̂ N [ 1 xN ] , (1.44)\nwhere Wt is a tensor of size 2ˆ 2ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ 2 in the QTT-format.

This example illustrates the use of Toeplitz-based tensorization in the separation of damped sinusoid signals from a short-length observation. We considered a single signal composed by P = 3 damped sinusoids of length L = 66, given by\ny(t) = P ÿ\np=1\nap xp(t) + n(t) , (1.81)\nwhere\nx(t) = exp( ´pt 30 ) sin( 2π fp fs t + pπ 7 ) (1.82)\nwith frequencies fp = 10, 11 and 12 Hz, the sampling frequency fs = 300 Hz, and the mixing factors ap = p. Additive Gaussian noise n(t) was generated at a specific signal-noise-ratio.\nIn order to separate the three signals, xp(t), from the mixture y(t), we first tensorized the observed signal to a 7th-order Toeplitz tensor of size\n44\n16ˆ 8ˆ 8ˆ 8ˆ 8ˆ 8ˆ 16, then folded this tensor to a 23th-order tensor of size 2ˆ 2ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ 2. With this tensorization, according to (1.77) and (1.69), each damped sinusoid xp(t) had a TT-representation of rank-(2, 2, . . . , 2). The result produced by minimizing the cost function (1.73), annotated by TT-SEPA, is shown in Figure 1.13 as a solid line with star marker. The so obtained performance was much better than in Example 9, even for the signal length of only 66 samples.\nWe note that the parameters of the damped signals can be estimated using linear self-prediction (auto-regression) methods, e.g., singular value decomposition of the Hankel-type matrix as in the Kumaresan-Tufts (KT) method [Kumaresan and Tufts, 1982]. As shown in Figure 1.13, the obtained results based on the TT-decomposition were slightly better than those using the KT method. For this particular problem, the estimation performance can even be higher when applying self-prediction algorithms, which exploit the low-rank structure of damped signals, e.g., TT-KT, and TT-linear prediction methods based on SVD. For a detailed derivation of these algorithms, see [Phan et al., 2017]."

      "text" : "This chapter has introduced several common tensorization methods, together with their properties and illustrative applications in blind source separation, blind identification, denoising, and harmonic retrieval. The\n46\nmain criterion for choosing a suitable tensorization is that the tensor generated from lower-order original data must reveal the underlying lowrank tensor structure in some tensor format. For example, the folded tensors of mixtures of damped sinusoid signals have low-rank QTT representation, while the derivative tensors in blind identification admit the CP decomposition. The Toeplitz and Hankel tensor foldings augment the number of signal entries, through the replication of signal segments (redundancy), and in this way become suited to modeling of signals of short length. A property crucial to the solution via the tensor networks shown in this chapter, is that the tensors can be generated in the TT/QTT format, if the generating vector admits a low-rank QTT representation.\nIn modern data analytics problems, such as regression and deep learning, the number of model parameters can be huge, which renders the model intractable. Tensorization can then serve as a remedy, by representing the parameters in some low-rank tensor format. For further discussion on tensor representation of parameters in tensor regression, we refer to Chapter 2. A wide class of optimization problems including of solving linear systems, eigenvalue decomposition, singular value decomposition, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) are addressed in Chapter 3. The tensor structures for Boltzmann machines and convolutional deep neural networks (CNN) are provided in Chapter 4.\n47\nChapter 2\nSupervised Learning with Tensors Learning a statistical model that formulates a hypothesis for the data distribution merely from multiple input data samples, x, without knowing the corresponding values of the response variable, y, is refereed to as unsupervised learning. In contrast, supervised learning methods, when seen from a probabilistic perspective, model either the joint distribution p(x, y) or the conditional distribution p(y|x), for given training data pair tx, yu. Supervised learning can be categorized into regression, if y is continuous, or classification, if y is categorical (see also Figure 2.1).\nRegression models can be categorized into linear regression and nonlinear regression. In particular, multiple linear regression is associated with multiple smaller-order predictors, while multivariate regression corresponds to a single linear regression model but with multiple predictors and multiple responses. Normally, multivariate regression tasks are encountered when the predictors are arranged as vectors, matrices or tensors of variables. A basic linear regression model in the vector form is defined as\ny = f (x; w, b) = xx, wy+ b = wTx + b, (2.1)\nwhere x P RI is the input vector of independent variables, w P RI the vector of regression coefficients or weights, b the bias, and y the regression output or a dependent/target variable.\nSuch simple linear models can be applied not only for regression but also for feature selection and classification. In all the cases, those models approximate the target variable y by a weighted linear combination of input variables, wTx + b.\nTensor representations are often very useful in mitigating the small sample size problem in discriminative subspace selection, because the\n48\nNo data labels\ninformation about the structure of objects is inherent in tensors and is a natural constraint which helps reduce the number of unknown parameters in the description of a learning model. In other words, when the number of training measurements is limited, tensor-based learning machines are expected to perform better than the corresponding vector-based learning machines, as vector representations are associated with several problems, such as loss of information for structured data and over-fitting for highdimensional data."

      "heading" : "2.1 Tensor Regression",
      "text" : "Regression is at the very core of signal processing and machine learning, whereby the output is typically estimated based on a linear combination of regression coefficients and the input regressor, which can be a vector, matrix, or tensor. In this way, regression analysis can be used to predict dependent variables (responses, outputs, estimates), from a set of independent\n49\nvariables (predictors, inputs, regressors), by exploring the correlations among these variables as well as explaining the inherent factors behind the observed patterns. It is also often convenient, especially regarding ill-posed cases of matrix inversion, which is inherent to regression to jointly perform regression and dimensionality reduction through, e.g., principal component regression (PCR) [Jolliffe, 1982], whereby regression is performed on a well-posed low-dimensional subspace defined through most significant principal components. With tensors being a natural generalization of vectors and matrices, tensor regression can be defined in an analogous way.\nA well established and important supervised learning technique is linear or nonlinear Support Vector Regression (SVR) [Smola and Vapnik, 1997], which allows for the modeling of streaming data and is quite closely related to Support Vector Machines (SVM) [Cortes and Vapnik, 1995]. The model produced by SVR only depends on a subset of training data (support vectors), because the cost function for building the model ignores any training data that is close (within a threshold ε) to the model prediction.\nStandard support vector regression techniques have been naturally extended to Tensor Regression (TR) or Support Tensor Machine (STM) methods [Tao et al., 2005]. In the (raw) tensor format, the TR/STM can be formulated as\ny = f (X; W, b) = xX, Wy+ b, (2.2)\nwhere X P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN is the input tensor regressor, W P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN the tensor of weights (also called regression tensor or model tensor), b the bias, and y the regression output, xX, Wy = vec(X)T vec(W) is the inner product of two tensors.\nWe shall denote input samples of multiple predictor variables (or features) by X1, . . . , XM (tensors), and the actual continuous or categorical response variables by y1, y2, . . . , yM (usually scalars). The training process, that is the estimation of the weight tensor W and bias b, is carried out based on the set of available training samples tXm, ymu for m = 1, . . . , M. Upon arrival of a new training sample, the TR model is used to make predictions for that sample.\nThe problem is usually formulated as a minimization of the following squared cost function, given by\nJ(X, y | W, b) = M ÿ\nm=1\n( ym ´ ( xW, Xmy+ b ))2 (2.3)\n50\nor the logistic loss function (usually employed in classification problems), given by\nJ(X, y | W, b) = M ÿ\nm=1\nlog (\n1 1 + e´ym(xW,Xmy+b)\n) . (2.4)\nIn practice, for very large scale problems, tensors are expressed approximately in tensor network formats, especially using Canonical Polyadic (CP), Tucker or Tensor Train (TT)/Hierarchical Tucker (HT) models [Grasedyck, 2010, Oseledets, 2011a]. In this case, a suitable representation of the weight tensor, W, plays a key role in the model performance. For example, the CP representation of the weight tensor, in the form\nW = R ÿ\nr=1\nu(1)r ˝ u (2) r ˝ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˝ u (N) r\n= Iˆ1 U(1) ˆ2 U(2) ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN U(N), (2.5)\nwhere “˝” denotes the outer product of vectors, leads to a generalized linear model (GLM), called the CP tensor regression [Zhou et al., 2013].\nAnalogously, upon the application of Tucker multilinear rank tensor representation\nW = Gˆ1 U(1) ˆ2 U(2) ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN U(N), (2.6)\nwe obtain Tucker tensor regression [Hoff, 2015, Li et al., 2013, Yu et al., 2016]. An alternative form of the multilinear Tucker regression model, proposed by Hoff [2015], assumes that the replicated observations tXm, YmuMm=1 are stacked in concatenated tensors X P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆINˆM and Y P RJ1ˆ¨¨¨ˆJNˆM, which admit the following model\nY = Xˆ1 W1 ˆ2 W2 ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN WN ˆN+1 DM + E, (2.7)\nwhere DM is an M ˆ M diagonal matrix, Wn P RJnˆIn are the weight matrices within the Tucker model, and E is a zero-mean residual tensor of the same order as Y. The unknown regression coefficient matrices, Wn can be found using the procedure outlined in Algorithm 1.\nIt is important to highlight that the Tucker regression model offers several benefits over the CP regression model, which include:\n1. A more parsimonious modeling capability and a more compact model, especially for a limited number of available samples;\n51\nAlgorithm 1: Multilinear Tucker Regression Input: X P RI1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆINˆM and Y P RJ1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆJNˆM.

Ability to fully exploit multi-linear ranks, through the freedom to choose a different rank for each mode, which is essentially useful when data is skewed in dimensions (different sizes in modes);\n3. Tucker decomposition explicitly models the interaction between factor matrices in different modes, thus allowing for a finer grid search over a larger modeling space.\nBoth the CP and Tucker tensor regression models can be solved by alternating least squares (ALS) algorithms which sequentially estimate one factor matrix at a time while keeping other factor matrices fixed. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, various tensor network decompositions can be applied, such as the TT/HT decomposition for very high-order tensors [Grasedyck, 2010, Oseledets, 2011a]. When the weight tensor W in (2.2) is represented by a low-rank HT decomposition, this is referred to as the H-Tucker tensor regression [Hou, 2017].\nRemark 1. In some applications, the weight tensor, W, is of a higherorder than input tensors, Xm, this yields a more general tensor regression model\nYm = xXm|Wy+ Em, m = 1, . . . , M, (2.8)\nwhere xXm|Wy denotes a tensor contraction along the first N modes of an Nth-order input (covariate) tensor, Xm P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN , and a Pth-order weight tensor, W P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIP , with P ą N, while E P RIP+1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIP is the residual tensor and Y P RIP+1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIP the response tensor.\n52\nObserve that the tensor inner product is equivalent to a contraction of two tensors of the same order (which is a scalar) while a contraction of two tensors of different orders, X P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN and W P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIP , with P ą N, is defined as a tensor Y P RIN+1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIP of (P´ N)th-order with entries\nxX|WyiN+1,...,iP = I1 ÿ\ni1=1\n¨ ¨ ¨ IN ÿ\niN=1\nxi1,...,iN wi1,...,iN ,iN+1,...,iP . (2.9)\nMany regression problems are special cases of the general tensor regression model in (2.8), including the multi-response regression, vector autoregressive model and pair-wise interaction tensor model (see [Raskutti and Yuan, 2015] and references therein).\nIn summary, the aim of tensor regression is to estimate the entries of a weight tensor, W, based on available input-output observations tXm, Ymu. In a more general scenario, support tensor regression (STR) aims to identify a nonlinear function, f : RI1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN Ñ R, from a collection of observed input-output data pairs tXm, ymuMm=1 generated from the model\nym = f (Xm) + ε, (2.10)\nwhere the input Xm has a tensor structure, the output ym is a scalar, and ε is also a scalar which represents the error.\nUnlike linear regression models, nonlinear regression models have the ability to characterize complex nonlinear dependencies in data, in which the responses are modeled through a combination of nonlinear parameters and predictors, with the nonlinear parameters usually taking the form of an exponential function, trigonometric function, power function, etc. The nonparametric counterparts, so called nonparametric regression models, frequently appear in machine learning, such as Gaussian Processes (GP) (see [Hou, 2017, Zhao et al., 2013b] and references therein)."

      "heading" : "2.2 Regularized Tensor Models",
      "text" : "Regularized tensor models aims to reduce the complexity of tensor regression models through constraints (restrictions) on the model parameters, W. This is particularly advantageous for problems with a large number of features but a small number of data samples.\nRegularized linear tensor models can be generally formulated as\nmin W,b f (X, y) = J(X, y | W, b) + λR(W), (2.11)\n53\nwhere J(X, y | W, b) denotes a loss (error) function, R(W) is a regularization term, while the parameter λ ą 0 controls the trade-off between the contributions of the original loss function and regularization term.\nOne such well-known regularized linear model is the Frobeniusnorm regularized model for support vector regression, called Grouped LASSO [Tibshirani, 1996a], which employs logistic loss and `1-norm regularization for simultaneous classification (or regression) and feature selection. Another very popular model of this kind is the support vector machines (SVM) [Cortes and Vapnik, 1995] which uses a hinge loss in the form l(ŷ) = max(0, 1´ yŷ), where ŷ is the prediction and y the true label.\nIn regularized tensor regression, when the regularization is performed via the Frobenius norm, }W}2F = xW, Wy, we arrive at the standard Tikhonov regularization, while using the `1 norm, } ¨ }`1 , we impose classical sparsity constraints. The advantage of tensors over vectors and matrices is that we can exploit the flexibility in the choice of sparsity profiles. For example, instead of imposing global sparsity for the whole tensor, we can impose sparsity for slices or fibers if there is a need to enforce some fibers or slices to have most of their entries zero. In such a case, similarly to group LASSO, we can apply group-based `1-norm regularizers, such as the `2,1 norm, i.e., }X}2,1 = řJ j=1 }xj}2.\nSimilarly to matrices, the various rank properties can also be employed for tensors, and are much richer and more complex due to the multidimensional structure of tensors. In addition to sparsity constraints, a low-rank of a tensor can be exploited as a regularizer, such as the canonical rank or multilinear (Tucker) rank, together with various more sophisticated tensor norms like the nuclear norm or latent norm of the weight tensor W.\nThe low-rank regularization problem can be formulated as\nmin W J(X, y | W, b), s.t. multilinear rank(W) ď R. (2.12)\nSuch a formulation allows us to estimate a weight tensor, W P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN , that minimizes the empirical loss J, subject to the constraint that the multilinear rank of W is at most R. Equivalently, this implies that the weight tensor, W, admits a low-dimensional factorization in the form W = Gˆ1 U(1) ˆ2 U(2) ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN U(N).\nLow rank structure of tensor data has been successfully utilized in applications including missing data imputation [Liu et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2015], multilinear robust principal component analysis [Inoue et al., 2009], and subspace clustering [Zhang et al., 2015a]. Instead of low-rank\n54\nproperties of data itself, low-rank regularization can be also applied to learning coefficients in regression and classification [Yu et al., 2016].\nSimilarly, for very large-scale problems, we can also apply the tensor train (TT) decomposition as the constraint, to yield\nmin W\nJ(X, y | W, b), s.t. W = xxG(1), . . . , G(N)yy. (2.13)\nIn this way, the weight tensor W is approximated by a low-TT rank tensor of the TT-rank (R1, . . . , RN´1) of at most R.\nThe low-rank constraint for the tensor W can also be formulated through the tensor norm, in the form [Wimalawarne et al., 2016]\nmin W,b (J(X, y | W, b) + λ}W}), (2.14)\nwhere } ¨ } is a suitably chosen tensor/matrix norm. One of the important and useful tensor norms is the tensor nuclear norm [Liu et al., 2013] or the (overlapped) trace norm [Wimalawarne et al., 2014], which can be defined for a tensor W P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN as\n}W}˚ = N ÿ\nn=1\n}W(n)}˚, (2.15)\nwhere }W(n)}˚ = ř i σi, σi denotes the ith singular value of W(n). The overlapped tensor trace norm can be viewed as a direct extension of the matrix trace norm, since it uses unfolding matrices of a tensor in all of its modes, and then computes the sums of trace norms of those unfolding matrices. Regularization based on the overlapped trace norm can also be viewed as an overlapped group regularization, due to the fact that the same tensor is unfolded over all modes and regularized using the trace norm.\nRecently Tomioka and Suzuki [2013] proposed the latent trace norm of a tensor, which takes a mixture of N latent tensors, W(n), and regularizes each of them separately, as in (2.15), to give\n}W}latent = inf W\nN ÿ\nn=1\n}W(n) (n)}˚, (2.16)\nwhere W = W(1) + W(2) + ¨ ¨ ¨+ W(N) and W(n) (n) denotes the unfolding of W(n) in its nth mode. In contrast to the nuclear norm, the latent tensor trace norm effectively regularizes different latent tensors in each unfolded mode,\n55\nwhich makes it possible for the latent tensor trace norm to identify (in some cases) a latent tensor with the lowest possible rank. In general, the content of each latent tensor depends on the rank of its unfolding matrices.\nRemark 2. A major drawback of the latent trace norm approach is its inability to identify the rank of a tensor, when the rank value is relatively close to its dimension (size). In other words, if a tensor has a mode with a dimension (size) much smaller than other modes, the latent trace norm may be incorrectly estimated. To deal with this problem, the scaled latent norm was proposed by Wimalawarne et al. [2014] which is defined as\n}W}scaled = inf W\nN ÿ\nn=1\n1? In }W(n) (n)}˚, (2.17)\nwhere W = W(1) + W(2) + ¨ ¨ ¨+ W(N). Owing to the normalization by the mode size, in the form of (2.17), the scaled latent trace norm scales with mode dimension, and thus estimates more reliably the rank, even when the sizes of various modes are quite different.\nThe state-of-the-art tensor regression models therefore employ the scaled latent trace norm, and are solved by the following optimization problem\nP(W, b) = min W,b\n( M ÿ\nm=1\n( ym ´ ( xW, Xmy+ b ))2 + N ÿ\nn=1\nλn}W(n)(n)}˚ ) , (2.18)\nwhere W = W(1) + W(2) + ¨ ¨ ¨+ W(N), for n = 1, . . . , N, and for any given regularization parameter λ, where λn = λ in the case of latent trace norm and λn = λ?In in the case of the scaled latent trace norm, while W (n) (n) denotes the unfolding of W(n) in its nth mode. Remark 3. Note that the above optimization problems involving the latent and scaled latent trace norms require a large number (N ś\nn In) of variables in N latent tensors.\nMoreover, the existing methods based on SVD are infeasible for very large-scale applications. Therefore, for very large scale high-order tensors, we need to use tensor network decompositions and perform all operations in tensor networks formats, taking advantage of their lower-order core tensors.\n56"

The matrices P and C represent loadings (PLS regression coefficients), and E, F are respectively the residuals for X and Y, while D is a scaling diagonal matrix.\nThe PLS procedure is recursive, so that in order to obtain the set of first latent components in T, the standard PLS algorithm finds the two sets of weight vectors, w and c, through the following optimization problem\nmax tw,cu\n( wTXTYc )2 , s.t. wTw = 1, cTc = 1.

For a 3rd-order tensor, X P RIˆJˆK, and a multivariate response matrix, Y P RIˆM, with the respective elements xijk and yim, the tensor of independent variables, X, is decomposed into one latent vector t P RIˆ1 and two loading vectors, p P RJˆ1 and q P RKˆ1, i.e., one loading vector per mode. As shown in Figure 2.3, the 3-way PLS (the N-way PLS for N = 3) performs the following simultaneous tensor and matrix decompositions\nX = R ÿ\nr=1\ntr ˝ pr ˝ qr + E, Y = R ÿ\nr=1\ndrr trcTr + F.

Such a model allows us to find the optimal subspace approximation of X, in which the independent and dependent variables share a common set of latent vectors in one specific mode (i.e., samples mode). More specifically, we assume that X is decomposed as a sum of rank-(1, L1, . . . , LN) Tucker blocks, while Y is decomposed as a sum of rank-(1, K1, . . . , KN) Tucker blocks, which can be expressed as\nX = R ÿ\nr=1\nGxrˆ1 trˆ2 P (1) r ¨ ¨ ¨ˆN+1 P (N) r +ER,\nY = R ÿ\nr=1\nGyrˆ1 trˆ2 Q (1) r ¨ ¨ ¨ˆN+1Q (N) r +FR,\n(2.33)\n62\nwhere R is the number of latent vectors, tr P RM is the r-th latent vector, !\nP(n)r )N\nn=1 P RInˆLn and\n!

The core tensors, Gx and Gy, have a special blockdiagonal structure (see Figure 2.4) and their elements indicate the level of local interactions between the corresponding latent vectors and loading matrices.\nBenefiting from the advantages of Tucker decomposition over the CP model, HOPLS generates approximate latent components that better model the data than N-way PLS. Specifically, the HOPLS differs substantially from the N-way PLS model in the sense that the sizes of loading matrices are controlled by a hyperparameter, providing a tradeoff between the model fit and model complexity. Note that HOPLS simplifies into N-way PLS if we impose the rank-1 constraints for the Tucker blocks, that is @n : tLnu = 1 and @m : tKmu = 1.\nThe optimization of subspace transformation according to (2.33) can be formulated as a problem of determining a set of orthogonal loadings and latent vectors. Since these terms can be optimized sequentially, using the same criteria and based on deflation, in the following, we shall illustrate the procedure based on finding the first latent vector, t, and two sequences of loading matrices, P(n) and Q(n).

Consider N pairs of tensor observations t(Xm, Ym)uMm=1, where Xm denotes an Nth-order independent tensor and Ym an Lth-order dependent tensor. Note that the data tensors, Xm and Ym, can be concatenated to form an (N + 1)th-order tensor X P RMˆI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN and (L + 1)th-order tensor Y P RMˆJ1ˆ¨¨¨ˆJL . Within the kernel framework, the data tensors X and Y are mapped onto the Hilbert space by a reproducing kernel mapping φ : Xm ÞÝÑ φ (Xm). For simplicity, we shall denote φ(X) by Φ and φ(Y) by Ψ. The KTPLS then aims to perform the tensor decompositions, corresponding to those in (2.35), such that\nΦ = GX ˆ1 Tˆ2 P(1) ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN+1 P(N) + EX, Ψ = GY ˆ1 Uˆ2 Q(1) ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆL+1 Q(L) + EY, U = TD + EU .\n(2.38)\nSince within the kernel framework, the tensors rGX = GX ˆ2 P(1) ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN+1 P(N) and rGY = GY ˆ2 Q(1) ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆL+1 Q(L) can be respectively represented as a linear combination of tφ(Xm)u and tφ(Ym)u, i.e., rGX = Φˆ1 TT and rGY = Ψˆ1 UT, for the KTPLS solution we only need to find the latent vectors of T = [t1, . . . , tR] and U = [u1, . . . , uR], such that they exhibit maximum pairwise covariance, through solving sequentially the following optimization problems\nmaxtw(n)r ,v(l)r u [cov(tr, ur)] 2, (2.39)\nwhere\ntr = Φ ¯̂ 2w (1) r ¨ ¨ ¨ ¯̂ N+1w (N) r ,\nur = Ψ ¯̂ 2v (1) r ¨ ¨ ¨ ¯̂ L+1v (L) r .\n(2.40)\nUpon rewriting (2.40) in a matrix form, this yields tr = Φ(1) rwr where rwr = w (N) r b ¨ ¨ ¨ b w (1) r and ur = Ψ(1)rvr where rvr = v (N) r b ¨ ¨ ¨ b v (1) r , which can be solved by a kernelized version of the eigenvalue problem, i.e., Φ(1)Φ T (1)Ψ(1)Ψ T (1)tr = λtr and ur = Ψ(1)Ψ T (1)tr [Rosipal and Trejo, 2002].

      "text" : "Kernel functions can be considered as a means for defining a new topology which implies a priori knowledge about the invariance in the input space [Schölkopf and Smola, 2002] (see Figure 2.5). Kernel algorithms can also be used for estimation of vector-valued nonlinear and nonstationary signals [Tobar et al., 2014]. In this section, we discuss the kernels for tensor-valued\n67\ninputs, which should exploit multi-way structures while maintaining the notion of similarity measures.\nMost straightforward tensor-valued reproducing kernels are a direct generalization from vectors to Nth-order tensors, such as the following kernel functions k : Xˆ X Ñ R, given by\nLinear kernel: k(X, X1) = xvec(X), vec(X1)y, Gaussian-RBF kernel: k(X, X1) = exp ( ´ 1\n2β2 }X´ X1}2F\n) .\n(2.42)\nIn order to define a similarity measure that directly exploits the multilinear algebraic structure of input tensors, Signoretto et al. [2011, 2012] proposed a tensorial kernel which both exploits the algebraic geometry of tensors spaces and provides a similarity measure between the different subspaces spanned by higher-order tensors. Another such kernel is the product kernel which can be defined by N factor kernels, as k(X, X1) = śN\nn=1 k ( X(n), X1(n) )\n, where each factor kernel represents a similarity measure between mode-n matricizations of two tensors, X and X1.\nOne similarity measure between matrices is the so called Chordal distance, which is a projection of the Frobenius norm on a Grassmannian manifolds [Signoretto et al., 2011]. For example, for an Nth-order tensor, X, upon the applications of SVD to its mode-n unfolding, that is, X(n) = U(n)X Σ (n) X V (n)T X , the Chordal distance-based kernel for tensorial data is\n68\ndefined as\nk(X, X1) = N ź\nn=1\nexp ( ´ 1\n2β2\n› ›\n› V(n)X V (n)T X ´V (n) X1 V (n)T X1\n› › ›\n2\nF\n) , (2.43)\nwhere β is a kernel parameter. It should be emphasized that such a tensor kernel ensures (provides) rotation and reflection invariance for elements on the Grassmann manifold [Signoretto et al., 2011].\nZhao et al. [2013c] proposed a whole family of probabilistic product kernels based on generative models. More specifically, an Nth-order tensor-valued observation is first mapped onto an N-dimensional model space, then information divergence is applied as a similarity measure in such a model space (see also [Cichocki et al., 2011, 2015]).\nThe advantage of probabilistic tensor kernels is that they can deal with multiway data with missing values and with variable data length. Given that probabilistic kernels provide a way to model one tensor from N different viewpoints which correspond to different lower-dimensional vector spaces, this makes it possible for multiway relations to be captured within a similarity measure.\nA general similarity measure between two tensors, X and X1, in mode-n can be defined as\nSn(X}X1) = D ( p(x|ΩXn )}q(x|ΩX 1 n ) ) , (2.44)\nwhere p and q are distributions which respectively represent the probability density function for X and X1, D(p}q) is an information divergence between two distributions, while ΩXn denotes the parameters of a moden distribution of X, which depends on the model assumption.\nFor simplicity, we usually assume Gaussian models for all modes of tensor X, so that Ω can be expressed by the mean values and covariance matrices of that distribution. One simple and very useful information divergence is the standard symmetric Kullback-Leibler (sKL) divergence [Moreno et al., 2003], expressed as\nDsKL ( p(x|λ)}q(x|λ1) ) =\n1 2\nż +8\n´8 p(x|λ) log p(x|λ) q(x|λ1) dx\n+ 1 2\nż +8\n´8 q(x|λ1) log q(x|λ\n1) p(x|λ) dx, (2.45)\nwhere λ and λ1 are parameters of the probability distributions. An alternative simple divergence is the symmetric Jensen-Shannon (JS)\n69\ndivergence [Chan et al., 2004, Cichocki et al., 2011, Endres and Schindelin, 2003], given by\nDJS(p}q) = 1 2 KL(p}r) + 1 2 KL(q}r), (2.46)\nwhere KL(¨}¨) denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence and r(x) = p(x)+q(x)\n2 . In summary, a probabilistic product kernel for tensors can be defined as\nk(X, X1) = α2 N ź\nn=1\nexp ( ´ 1\n2β2n Sn(X}X1)\n) , (2.47)\nwhere Sn(X}X1) is a suitably chosen probabilistic divergence, α denotes a magnitude parameter and [β1, . . . , βN ] are length-scale parameters.\nAn intuitive interpretation of the kernel function in (2.47) is that Nthorder tensors are assumed to be generated from N generative models, while the similarity of these models, measured by information divergence, is employed to provide a multiple kernel with well defined properties and conditions. This kernel can then effectively capture the statistical properties of tensors, which promises to be a powerful tool for multidimensional structured data analysis, such as video classification and multichannel feature extraction from brain electrophysiological responses.\nThere are many possibilities to define kernel functions for tensors, as outlined in Table 2.1 and Figure 2.6.\n70\n71"

      "text" : "Gaussian processes (GP) can be considered as a class of probabilistic models which specify a distribution over a function space, where the inference is performed directly in the function space [Rasmussen and Williams, 2006]. The GP model for tensor-valued input spaces, called the Tensor-based Gaussian Processes (Tensor-GP), is designed so as to take into account the tensor structure of data [Hou et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013c, 2014].\nGiven a paired dataset of M observations D = t(Xm, ym)|m = 1, . . . , Mu, the tensor inputs for all M instances (cases) are aggregated into an (N + 1)th-order design concatenated tensor X P RMˆI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN , while the targets are collected in the vector y = [y1, . . . , yM]T. After observing the training data D = tX, yu, the aim is to make inferences about the relationship between the inputs X and targets (output y), i.e., to perform estimation of the conditional distribution of the targets given the inputs, and in doing so to perform the prediction based on a new input, X˚, which has not been seen in the training set.\nThe distribution of observations can be factored over cases in the training set by y „\nśM m=1N (ym| fm, σ2), where fm denotes the latent\nfunction f (Xm), and σ2 denotes noise variance. A Gaussian process prior can be placed over the latent function, which implies that any finite subset of latent variables has a multivariate Gaussian distribution, denoted by\nf (X) „ GP(m(X), k(X, X1) | θ), (2.48)\nwhere m(X) is the mean function which is usually set to zero for simplicity, and k(X, X1) is the covariance function (e.g., kernel function) for tensor data, with a set of hyper-parameters denoted by θ.\nThe hyper-parameters from the observation model and the GP prior are collected in Θ = tσ, θu. The model is then hierarchically extended to the third level by also giving priors over the hyperparameters in Θ.\nTo incorporate the knowledge that the training data provides about the function f(X), we can use the Bayes rule to infer the posterior of the latent function f(X) = [ f (X1), . . . , f (XM)]T by\np (f|D, Θ) = p (y|f, σ) p (f|X, θ)ş p (y|f, σ) p (f|X, θ) df , (2.49)\nwhere the denominator in (2.49) can be interpreted as the marginal\n72\nlikelihood obtained by the integration over f, to yield\ny|X, θ, σ2 „ N (y|0, K + σ2I), (2.50)\nwhere (K)ij = k(Xi, Xj) denotes the covariance matrix or kernel matrix. Note that, since the Gaussian observation model is analytically tractable and so it avoids the approximate inference, the conditional posterior of the latent function f is Gaussian, and the posterior of f˚ is also Gaussian, together with the observation y˚.\nFinally, the predictive distribution of y˚ corresponding to X˚ can be inferred as y˚|X˚, X, y, Θ „ N (y˚, cov(y˚)), where\ny˚ = k(X˚, X)(k(X, X) + σ 2 nI) ´1y,\ncov(y˚) = k(X˚, X˚)´ k(X˚, X)(k(X, X) + σ2I)´1k(X, X˚). (2.51)\nThe classification problem consisting of Nth-order tensors Xm P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN which are associated with target classes ym P t1, . . . , Cu, where C ą 2 and m = 1, . . . , M, was investigated by Zhao et al. [2013b]. All class labels are collected in the Mˆ 1 target vector y, and all tensors are concatenated in an (N + 1)th-order tensor X of size Mˆ I1ˆ¨ ¨ ¨ˆ IN . Given the latent function fm = [ f 1m, f 2m, . . . , f Cm ]T = f(Xm) at the observed input location Xm, the class labels ym are assumed to be independent and identically distributed, as defined by a multinomial probit likelihood model p(ym|f). The latent vectors from all observations are denoted by f = [ f 11 , . . . , f 1 M, f 2 1 , . . . , f 2 M, . . . , f C1 , . . . , f C M]\nT. The objective of TVGP is to predict the class membership for a new input tensor, X˚, given the observed data, D = tX, yu. Gaussian process priors are placed on the latent function related to each class, which is the common assumption in multi-class GP classification (see [Rasmussen and Williams, 2006, Riihimäki et al., 2012]).\nSuch a specification results in the zero-mean Gaussian prior for f, given by p(f|X) = N (0, K), (2.52) where K is a CMˆCM block-diagonal covariance matrix and every matrix K1, . . . , KC (of size Mˆ M) on its diagonal corresponds to each class. The element Kci,j in a cth class covariance matrix defines the prior covariance between f ci and f c j , which is governed by a kernel function k(Xi, Xj), i.e., Kci,j = k(Xi, Xj) = Cov( f c i , f c j ) within the class c. Note that since the kernel function should be defined in tensor-variate input space, hence commonly used kernel functions, such as Gaussian RBF, are infeasible. Therefore, the\n73\nframework of probabilistic product kernel for tensors, described in Sec.2.7, should be applied. In a kernel function, the hyperparameters are defined so as to control the smoothness properties and overall variance of latent functions, and are usually combined into one vector θ. For simplicity, we use the same θ for all classes.

First, the posterior distribution of the latent function, f˚, is given as p(f˚|D, X˚, θ) = ş\np(f˚|f, X˚, θ)p(f|D, θ)df. Then, we compute the posterior predictive probability of X˚, which is given by p(y˚|D, X˚, θ) = ş\np(y˚|f˚)p(f˚|D, X˚, θ)df˚. Since the non-Gaussian likelihood model results in an analytically intractable posterior distribution, variational approximative methods can be used for approximative inference. The additive multiplicative nonparametric regression (AMNR) model constructs f as the sum of local functions which take the components of a rank-one tensor as inputs [Imaizumi and Hayashi, 2016]. In this approach, the function space and the input space are simultaneously decomposed.\nFor example, upon applying the CP decomposition, to give X = řR\nr=1 u (1) r ˝ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˝ u (N) r , function f is decomposed into a set of local functions\nas\nf (X) = f (U(1), . . . , U(N)) = R ÿ\nr=1\nN ź\nn=1\nf (n)r (u (n) r ). (2.55)\n74\nFor each local function, f (n)r , consider the GP prior GP( f (n) r ), which is represented as a multivariate Gaussian distribution N (0In , K (n) r ). The likelihood function is then ś\nmN (ym| f (Xm), σ2). By employing the Gaussian processes regression, we can obtain the posterior distribution p( f |X, y), and the predictive distribution of p( f ˚|X, y, X˚)."

The benefits of this scheme are twofold:\n1. The use of a direct CP representation is intuitively closer to the idea of properly processing tensorial input data, as the data structure is more efficiently retained;\n2. The use of simple CP decompositions allows for multiple projections of the input tensor along each mode, leading to considerable improvements in the discriminative ability of the resulting classifier.\nThe corresponding optimization problems can be solved in an iterative manner utilizing, e.g., the standard CP decomposition, where at each iteration the parameters corresponding to the projections along a single tensor mode are estimated by solving a typical STM-type optimization problem.\nThe aim of the so formulated STM is therefore to learn a multilinear decision function, g : RI1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN Ñ [´1, 1], which classifies a test tensor X P RI1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN , by using the nonlinear transformation g(X) = sign(xX, Wy+ b).\nThe weight tensor, W, is estimated by solving the following soft STMs optimization problem\nmin W,b,ξ 1 2 xW, Wy+ C\nM ÿ\nm=1\nξm,\ns.t. ym (xW, Xmy+ b) ě 1´ ξm, ξm ě 0, m = 1, . . . , M,\n(2.74)\nwhere b is the bias term, ξ = [ξ1, . . . , ξm]T is the vector of slack variables and C is the term which controls the relative importance of penalizing the training errors. The training is performed in such a way that the margin of the support tensors is maximized while the upper bound on the misclassification errors in the training set is minimized.\nConsider, as an example, the case where the weight parameter, W, is represented via a CP model, to give\nW = R ÿ\nr=1\nu(1)r ˝ u (2) r ˝ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˝ u (N) r , (2.75)\nwhere u(n)r P RIn , n = 1, 2, . . . , N.

(2.77)\nThe above optimization problem, however, is not convex with respect to all sets of parameters in W. For this reason, we adopt an iterative scheme in which at each iteration we solve only for the parameters that are associated with the n-th mode of the parameter tensor W, while keeping all the other parameters fixed, similarly to the ALS algorithm. More specifically, for the n-th mode, at each iteration we solve the following optimization problem\nmin W(n),b,ξ 1 2\ntr (\nW(n)W T (n)\n) + C M ÿ\nm=1\nξm,\ns.t. ym ( tr ( W(n)X T m(n) ) + b ) ě 1´ ξm, ξm ě 0,\nm = 1, . . . , M, n = 1, . . . , N,\n(2.78)\nUnder the assumption that the tensor W is represented as a sum of rank one tensors, we can replace the above matrices by W(n) = U(n)(U(´n))T, and thus the above equation becomes\nmin U(n),b,ξ 1 2\ntr(U(n)(U(´n))T(U(´n))(U(n))T) + C M ÿ\nm=1\nξm,\ns.t. ym ( tr ( U(n)(U(´n))TXTm(n) ) + b ) ě 1´ ξm, ξm ě 0,\nm = 1, . . . , M, n = 1, . . . , N.\n(2.79)\nAt each iteration the optimization problem is solved for only one set of matrices U(n) for the mode n, while keeping the other matrices U(k) for k ‰ n, fixed. Note that the optimization problem defined in (2.79) can also be solved using a classic vector-based SVM implementation.\nLet us define A = U(´n) T U(´n), which is a positive definite matrix, and\nlet rU(n) = U(n)A 1 2 . Then,\ntr[U(n)(U(´n))T(U(´n))(U(n))T] = tr[rU(n)(rU(n))T]\n= vec(rU(n))Tvec(rU(n)).

In other words, such a procedure leads to a straightforward implementation of the algorithm by solving (2.82) with respect to rU(n) using a standard SVM implementation, and then solving for U(n) as U(n) = rU(n)A´ 1 2 ."

Here, B´n denotes the mode-n between-class scatter matrix in the partially projected tensor\n87\nsubspace (by all tensor modes except for mode n). The mode-n between class scatter matrix characterizes the separation between C classes in terms of mode-n unfolding of the tensor samples.\nSimilarly, the mode-n within-class scatter matrix is\nSn =WTn\n$\n&\n%\nC ÿ\nc=1\nMc ÿ\nm=1\n[ (Xcm ´ Lc) N ź\nk=1,k‰n ˆkWTk ] (n)[\n(Xcm ´ Lc) N ź\nk=1,k‰n ˆkWTk ]T (n) , . - Wn\n=WTnS´nWn,\n(2.96)\nwhere S´n represents the mode-n within-class scatter matrix in the partially projected tensor subspace (in all tensor modes except for n).

For big data classification problems quite perspective and promising is a quantum computing approach [Biamonte et al., 2016, Chatterjee and Yu, 2016, Li et al., 2015, Rebentrost et al., 2014, Schuld et al., 2015] and a tensor network approach discussed in the next Chapter 3.\n88\nChapter 3\nTensor Train Networks for Selected Huge-Scale Optimization Problems\nFor extremely large-scale, multidimensional datasets, due to curse of dimensionality, most standard numerical methods for computation and optimization problems are intractable. This chapter introduces feasible solutions for several generic huge-scale dimensionality reduction and related optimization problems, whereby the involved optimized cost functions are approximated by suitable low-rank TT networks. In this way, a very large-scale optimization problem can be converted into a set of much smaller optimization sub-problems of the same kind [Cichocki, 2014, Dolgov et al., 2014, Holtz et al., 2012a, Kressner et al., 2014a, Lee and Cichocki, 2016b, Schollwöck, 2011, 2013], which can be solved using standard methods.\nThe related optimization problems often involve structured matrices and vectors with over a billion entries (see [Dolgov, 2014, Garreis and Ulbrich, 2017, Grasedyck et al., 2013, Hubig et al., 2017, Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016] and references therein). In particular, we focus on Symmetric Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD/PCA) and Generalized Eigenvalue Decomposition (GEVD) [Dolgov et al., 2014, Hubig et al., 2015, Huckle and Waldherr, 2012, Kressner and Uschmajew, 2016, Kressner et al., 2014a, Zhang et al., 2016], SVD [Lee and Cichocki, 2015], solutions of overdetermined and undetermined systems of linear algebraic equations [Dolgov and Savostyanov, 2014, Oseledets and Dolgov, 2012], the Moore– Penrose pseudo-inverse of structured matrices [Lee and Cichocki, 2016b], and LASSO regression problems [Lee and Cichocki, 2016a]. Tensor\n89\nnetworks for extremely large-scale multi-block (multi-view) data are also discussed, especially TN models for orthogonal Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and related Higher-Order Partial Least Squares (HOPLS) problems [Hou, 2017, Hou et al., 2016b, Zhao et al., 2011, 2013a]. For convenience, all these problems are reformulated as constrained optimization problems which are then, by virtue of low-rank tensor networks, reduced to manageable lower-scale optimization sub-problems. The enhanced tractability and scalability is achieved through tensor network contractions and other tensor network transformations.\nPrior to introducing solutions to several fundamental optimization problems for very large-scale data, we shall describe basic strategies for optimization with cost functions in TT formats."

In this way, a large-scale task is replaced by easier-to-handle sub-tasks, whereby the aim is to extract a specific TT core or its slices from the whole TT network. For this purpose, the TT sub-trains can be defined as follows [Holtz et al., 2012a, Kressner et al., 2014a]\nGăn = xxG(1), G(2), . . . , G(n´1)yy P RI1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆIn´1ˆRn´1 (3.1) Gąn = xxG(n+1), G(n+2), . . . , G(N)yy P RRnˆIn+1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN (3.2)\nwhile their corresponding unfolding matrices, also called interface matrices, are given by:\nGăn = [Găn]ăn´1ą P RI1 I2¨¨¨In´1ˆRn´1 , Gąn = [Gąn](1) P RRnˆIn+1¨¨¨IN .

For feasibility, the procedure is replaced by a sequence of optimizations carried out over one core at a time, that is X(n) = arg min J(X(1), . . . , X(n), . . . , X(N)).\nThe idea behind the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization3 (also known as the Alternating Linear Scheme or one-site DMRG (DMRG1)) is that in each local optimization (called the micro-iteration step), only one core tensor, X(n), is updated, while all other cores are kept fixed. Starting from some initial guess for all cores, the method first updates, say, core X(1), while cores X(2), . . . X(N), are fixed, then it updates X(2) with X(1), X(3), . . . , X(n) fixed and so on, until X(N) is optimized. After completing this forward half-sweep, the algorithm proceeds backwards along the sequence of cores N, N´ 1, . . . , 1, within the so-called backward half-sweep. The sequence of forward and backward iterations complete one full sweep4, which corresponds to one (global-) iteration. These iterations are repeated until some stopping criterion is satisfied, as illustrated in Algorithm 7 and Figure 3.4.\nAs in any iterative optimization based on gradient descent, the cost function can only decrease, however, there is no guarantee that a global minimum would be reached. Also, since the TT rank for the desired solution is unknown, the standard ALS relies on an initial guess for the TT rank; for some initial conditions the iteration process can therefore be very slow. To alleviate these problems, the modified ALS (MALS/DMRG2) scheme aims to merge two neighboring TT cores (blocks), optimize the resulting “super-node” also called “super-core” or “super-block”, and split\n3The ALS algorithms can be considered as the block nonlinear Gauss-Seidel iterations. 4Note that this sweeping process operates in a similar fashion as the self-consistent\nrecursive loops, where the solution is improved iteratively and gradually.\n97\n98\nagain the result into separate factors by low-rank matrix factorizations, usually using truncated SVD 5. Some remarks:\n• If the global cost (loss) function J(X) is quadratic, so too are the local cost functions Jn(X(n)), and the problem reduces to solving a small-scale optimization at each micro-iteration. In addition, local problems in the micro-iterations are usually better conditioned, due to the orthogonalization of TT cores.\n• In most optimization problems considered in this monograph the TT decomposition is assumed to be in an orthogonalized form, where all cores are left– or right–orthogonal with respect to the core X(n), which is being optimized (see also Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5) [Dolgov and Khoromskij, 2013, Holtz et al., 2012a]."

As a matter of fact, quantum physicists use rather the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm in order to optimize matrix product states (TT/MPS) (for more detail see Orús [2014], Orus and Vidal [2008], Vidal [2003].)\n99\nFor a large-scale high-order reconstruction tensor represented in the TT format, that is, X = xxX(1), X2), . . . , X(N)yy, the above optimization problem can be converted by the ALS approach to a set of smaller optimization problems.

These can be estimated by, for example, starting with a maximum rank Rmax and reducing gradually ranks by TT rounding. Alternatively, starting from a minimum rank, Rmin, the ranks could be gradually increased. The rank increasing procedure can start with rTT = t1, 1, . . . , 1u, and the so obtained result is used for another run (sweep), but with rTT = t1, 2, . . . , 1u. In other words, the rank R2 between the second and third core is increased, and so on until either the prescribed residual tolerance ε or Rmax is reached. As the rank value is a key factor which determines the complexity of the ALS, the second approach is often more efficient and is computationally comparable with rank-adaptive approaches [Grasedyck et al., 2015, Steinlechner, 2016a,b].\n101"

This computational bottleneck can be very efficiently dealt with through low-rank tensor approximations, and the last 10 years have witnessed the development of such techniques for several classes of optimization problems, including EVD/PCA and SVD [Dolgov et al., 2014, Kressner et al., 2014a, Lee and Cichocki, 2015]. The principle is to represent the cost function in a tensor format; under certain conditions, such as that tensors can be often quite well approximated in a low-rank TT format, thus allowing for low-dimensional parametrization.\nIn other words, if a structured symmetric matrix A and its eigenvector x admit low-rank TT approximations, a large-scale eigenvalue problem\n102\ncan be converted into a set of smaller optimization problems by representing the eigenvector, x P RI , and the matrix, A P RIˆI , in TT (MPS/MPO) formats, i.e., a TT/MPS for an Nth-order tensor X – xxX(1), . . . , X(N)yy P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN and a matrix TT/MPO for a 2Nth-order tensor A – xxA(1), . . . , A(N)yy P RI1ˆI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆINˆIN , where I = I1 I2 ¨ ¨ ¨ IN .\nFigure 3.6 illustrates this conversion into a set of much smaller sub-\n103\nproblems by employing tensor contractions and the frame equations (see section 3.1)\nx = X‰n x(n), n = 1, 2, . . . , N, (3.24)\nwith the frame matrices\nX‰n = Xăn bL IIn bL (Xąn)T P RI1 I2¨¨¨INˆRn´1 InRn .

(3.28)\nIn practice, the matrices A(n) are never computed directly by (3.27). Instead, we compute matrix-by-vector multiplication6, A(n) x(n), iteratively via optimized contraction of TT cores within a tensor network. The concept of optimized contraction is illustrated in Figure 3.7.\nIt should be noted that the contraction of the matrix A in TT/MPO format, with corresponding TT cores of the vectors x and xT in TT/MPS format, leads to the left- and right contraction tensors Lăn and Rąn, as illustrated in Figure 3.6.

In a practical implementation, the full network contraction is never carried out globally, but through iterative sweeps from right to left or vice-versa, to build up Lăn and Rąn from the previous steps. The left and right orthogonalization of the cores can also be exploited to simplify the tensor contraction process [Dolgov et al., 2014, Kressner et al., 2014a, Lee and Cichocki, 2015, 2016b, Schollwöck, 2011].\n105\nRemark.

In general, the block TT format is suitable for approximate representation of tall and skinny structured matrices using almost the same number of data samples as for representation a single vector/matrix. Within the block-n TT, all but one cores are 3rd-order tensors, the remaining core is a 4th-order tensor and has an additional physical index K which represents the number of eigenvectors, as shown in Figure 3.9. The position of this 4th-order core X(n) which carries the index K is not fixed; during sequential optimization, it is moved backward and forward from position 1 to N [Dolgov et al., 2014,\nHoltz et al., 2012a].

During the optimization process, the neighbouring core tensors need to be appropriately reshaped, as explained in detail in Algorithm 8 and Algorithm 9.\nWhen using the block-n TT model to represent the K mutually orthogonal vectors, the matrix frame equation takes a slightly modified form\nX = X‰n X(n) P RIˆK, n = 1, 2, . . . , N, (3.30)\nwhere X(n) = X(n)ă3ą = X (n) T (4) P R Rn´1 InRnˆK.

This reduces a large-scale optimization problem to a set of smaller-scale optimization problems, although the MALS sub-problems are essentially of bigger size than those for the ALS.\nAfter local optimization (micro-iteration) on a merged core tensor, X(n,n+1) = X(n) ˆ1 X(n+1), it is in the next step decomposed (factorized) into two separate TT-cores via a δ-truncated SVD of the unfolded matrix,\n110\nAlgorithm 10: One full sweep of the ALS algorithm for symmetric EVD [Dolgov and Savostyanov, 2014]\nInput: A symmetric matrix A P RIˆI , and initial guesses for X P RI1 I2¨¨¨INˆK in block-1 TT format and with right orthogonal cores X(2), . . . , X(N) Output: Approximative solution X in the TT format 1: for n = 1 to N ´ 1 do 2: Perform tensor network contractions (Figure 3.9) and solve a\nreduced EVD problem (3.31), for the TT core X(n)\n3: Transform block-n TT to block-(n + 1) TT by applying Algorithm 8, such that the updated core X(n) is left-orthogonal 4: end for 5: for n = N to 2 do 6: Perform tensors network contraction and solve a reduced EVD problem\n(3.31) for the TT core X(n)\n7: Transform block-n TT to block-(n´ 1) TT by applying Algorithm 9, so that the updated core X(n) is right-orthogonal 8: end for 9: return X = xxX(1), X(2), . . . , X(N)yy\nX(n,n+1)ă2ą P RRn´1 In ˆ In+1Rn+1 , as\n[U, S, V] = tSVD ( X(n,n+1)ă2ą ) , (3.34)\nwhich allows us to both update the cores, X(n)ă2ą = U and X (n+1) ă1ą = SVT, and to estimate the TT rank between the cores as Rn = min(size(U, 2), Rmax).\nIn this way, the TT-ranks can be adaptively determined during the iteration process, while the TT-cores can be left- or right-orthogonalized, as desired. The truncation parameter, δ ą 0, can be selected heuristically or adaptively (see e.g. [Lee and Cichocki, 2015, Oseledets and Dolgov, 2012]).\nThe use of truncated SVD allows us to: (1) Estimate the optimal rank, Rn, and to (2) quantify the error associated with this splitting. In other words, the power of MALS stems from the splitting process which allows for a dynamic control of TT ranks during the iteration process, as well as from the ability to control the level of error of low-rank TN approximations.\n111"

      "heading" : "3.4.4 Alternating Minimal Energy Method for EVD (EVAMEn)",
      "text" : "Recall that the standard ALS method cannot adaptively change the TT ranks during the iteration process, whereas the MALS method achieves this in intermediate steps, through the merging and then splitting of two neighboring TT cores, as shown in the previous section. The cost function J(X) is not convex with respect to all the elements of the core tensors of X and as consequence the ALS is prone to getting stuck in local minima and suffers from a relatively slow convergence speed. On the other hand, the intermediate steps of the MALS help to alleviate these problems and improve the convergence speed, but there is still not guarantee that the algorithm will converge to a global minimum.\nThe Alternating Minimal Energy (AMEn) algorithm aims to avoid the problem of convergence to non-global minimum by exploiting the information about the gradient of a cost function or information about the value of a current residual by “enriching” the TT cores with additional information during the iteration process [Dolgov and Savostyanov, 2014]. In that sense, the AMEn can be considered as a subspace correction technique. Such an enrichment was efficiently implemented first by Dolgov and Savostyanov to solve symmetric as well as nonsymmetric linear systems [Dolgov et al., 2016] and was later extended to symmetric EVD in [Kressner et al., 2014a] and [Hubig et al., 2015].\nSimilar to the ALS method, at each iteration step, the AMEn algorithm updates a single core tensor (see Figure 3.11). Then, it concatenates the updated TT core X(n) with a core tensor Z(n) obtained from the residual vector. At each micro-iteration, only one core tensor of the solution is enriched by the core tensor computed based on the gradient vector. By concatenating two core tensors X(n) and Z(n), the AMEn can achieve global convergence, while maintaining the computational and storage complexities as low as those of the standard ALS [Dolgov and Khoromskij, 2015, Dolgov and Savostyanov, 2014].\nThe concatenation step of the AMEn is also called the (core) enrichment, the basis expansion, or the local subspace correction. The concept was proposed by White [2005] as a corrected one-side DMRG1 method, while [Dolgov and Savostyanov, 2014] proposed a significantly improved AMEn algorithm for solving large scale systems of linear equations together with theoretical convergence analysis. [Kressner et al., 2014a] and [Hubig et al., 2015] developed AMEn type methods for solving large scale eigenvalue problems.\nIn this case, the goal is to compute a single or only a few (K ě 1) extreme\n112\n113\neigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a very large symmetric matrix A P RIˆI , with I = I1 I2 ¨ ¨ ¨ IN . To this end, we exploit a cost function in the form of the block Rayleigh quotient, J(X) = tr(XTAX), where the matrix X = [x1, x2, . . . , xK] P RIˆK is assumed to be represented in a block TT format.\nIn the AMEn algorithm for the EVD, each core tensor, X(n) P RRn´1ˆInˆRnˆK of X, is updated at each micro-iteration, similarly to the ALS algorithm. Next, a core tensor Z(n) P RRn´1ˆInˆQnˆK is constructed and is concatenated with the core X(n) as\nrX (n) Ð X(n) ‘3 Z(n) P RRn´1ˆInˆ(Rn+Qn)ˆK, (3.35)\nor equivalently using tensor slices\nrX(n):,in,:,k Ð [X (n) :,in,:,k , Z(n):,in,:,k] P R Rn´1ˆ(Rn+Qn), @in,@k.\nFor the consistency of sizes of TT cores, the neighboring core tensor is concatenated with a tensor consisting all zero entries, to yield\nrX(n+1):,in+1,: Ð [ X(n+1):,in+1,: 0 ] P R(Rn+Qn)ˆRn+1 .\nAlgorithm 11 describes the AMEn for computing several extreme eigenvalues, Λ = diag(λ1, . . . , λK), and the corresponding eigenvectors, X.\nIn principle, the TT cores Z(n) are estimated from the residual7 as\nR – AX´ XΛ P RIˆK (3.36)\nwith Λ = XTAX P RKˆK. This corresponds to an orthogonal projection of the gradient of J(X) = tr(XTAX) onto the tangent space of the Stiefel manifold [Absil et al., 2008]. [Kressner et al., 2014a] formulated the local residual of the MALS method for EVD as\nRn,n+1 = A (n,n+1)X(n,n+1) ´ X(n,n+1)Λ\n= XT‰n,n+1(AX´ XΛ) P RRn´1 In In+1Rn+1ˆK, (3.37)\nwhere A(n,n+1) = XT‰n,n+1AX‰n,n+1 and X (n,n+1)(:, k) = vec(X(n):,:,:,k ˆ 1 X(n+1)), k = 1, . . . , K.\n7In order to improve convergence, the residual R is often defined as R – M´1(AX´ XΛ), where M is a suitably designed preconditioning matrix.\n114\nAlgorithm 11: One full sweep of the AMEn algorithm for EVD (EVAMEn) [Hubig et al., 2015, Kressner et al., 2014a]\nInput: A symmetric matrix A P RI1¨¨¨INˆI1¨¨¨IN , and an initial guess for X P RI1¨¨¨INˆK in a block-1 TT format with right-orthogonal cores X(2), . . . , X(N) Output: Approximate solution X in the TT format 1: for n = 1 to N ´ 1 do 2: Perform tensor network contraction (Figure 3.9) and solve\nthe reduced EVD problem (3.31) for the TT core X(n)\n3: Compute the core Z(n) defined in (3.39) by a contraction of the block Lăn and the cores A(n), X(n) (See Figure 3.11(a)) 4: Augment the two cores X(n) and X(n+1) with Z(n) and 0 of compatible sizes, to give the slices\nX(n):,in,:,k Ð [ X(n):,in,:,k, Z (n) :,in,:,k ] , X(n+1):,in+1,: Ð X(n+1):,in+1,: 0  5: Transform block-n TT into block-(n + 1) TT by applying Algorithm 8, so that the updated core X(n) is left-orthogonal 6: end for 7: for n = N to 2 do 8: Perform tensors network contraction and solve the reduced EVD problem (3.31) for the TT core X(n). 9: Compute the core Z(n) by a contraction of the block Rąn\nand the cores A(n), X(n) (See Figure 3.11(b)). 10: Augment the two cores X(n´1) and X(n) with 0 and Z(n) of\ncompatible sizes, to give the slices\nX(n´1):,in´1,: Ð [ X(n´1):,in´1,:, 0 ] , X(n):,in,:,k Ð X(n):,in,:,k Z(n):,in,:,k  11: Transform block-n TT into block-(n´ 1) TT by applying Algorithm 9 such that the updated core X(n) is right-orthogonal. 12: end for 13: return X = xxX(1), X(2), . . . , X(N)yy\n115\nProvided that the matrices A and X are given in a TT format, it is possible to build two core tensors Z(n) P RRn´1ˆInˆQnˆK and Z(n+1) P RQnˆIn+1ˆRn+1 separately, such that\nRn,n+1(:, k) ” vec(Z (n) :,:,:,k ˆ 1 Z(n+1)), (3.38)\nwhere the size Qn is equal to that of the residual, Qn = PnRn + Rn, unless preconditioned.\nAlternatively, [Hubig et al., 2015] developed a more efficient algorithm, whereby instead of using the exact residual AX ´ XΛ to compute the enrichment term, which is computationally expensive, they show that it is sufficient to exploit only the AX term. Note that if R = AX ´ XΛ, then the column space is preserved as range([X, R]) = range([X, AX]). See also the discussion regarding the column space of X‰n+1 in Section 3.8.2. Through this the simplified form, the expressions (3.37) and (3.38) can be written as Rn,n+1 = XT‰n,n+1AX, Rn,n+1(:, k) ” vec(Z (n) :,:,:,k ˆ 1 Z(n+1)). (3.39)\nIt is important to note that the TT cores Z(n) and Z(n+1) can be estimated independently without explicitly computing A(n,n+1) or X(n,n+1). Specifically, Z(n) can be computed by a sequential contraction of the block Lăn and the cores A(n) and X(n). Figures 3.11(a) and (b) illustrate the core enrichment procedure in the AMEn algorithm during the left-to-right or the right-to-left half-sweep. In the figure, for simplicity Z(n) is computed based on the expression (3.39) for eigenvalue problems, with K = 1 eigenvalue [Hubig et al., 2015]. Furthermore, it has been found that even a rough approximation to the residual / gradient for the enrichment Z(n) will lead to a faster convergence of the algorithm [Dolgov and Savostyanov, 2014]. See also Section 3.8.2 for another way of computing TT cores Z(n).\nIn general, the core tensor Z(n) is computed in a way dependent on a specific optimization problem and an efficient approximation strategy.\n116"

Note that the TT ranks tSnu of the preconditioned gradient zk are typically quite large due to the operations involved in the computation of the gradient.\nRecall that the basic linear algebraic operations such as the matrixby-vector multiplication can be performed efficiently, with a logarithmic\n143\ncomputational complexity, via the TT representations for large matrices and vectors. Since the algebraic operations on TT formats usually result in increased TT ranks, truncation (e.g., TT-rounding [Oseledets, 2011a]) needs to be subsequently performed. It should be emphasized that truncated iteration methods are not limited to the TT format but also apply to any low-rank tensor formats.\nLet Te denote a truncation operator which truncates ranks of a tensor format with a tolerance e ą 0. Truncated iteration methods can be described as a preconditioned gradient step combined with truncation, as\nxk+1 = Te ( xk ´ αkTη(M´1k ∇J(xk)) ) , e, η ą 0.\nThe rank truncation can be carried out by a hard thresholding scheme or\n144\na soft thresholding scheme [Bachmayr et al., 2016]. In the iterative hard thresholding scheme, singular values below some threshold are set to zero as in the truncated SVD or TT rounding [Oseledets, 2011a]. In the iterative soft thresholding scheme, on the other hand, each of the singular values is shrunk to zero by the function sκ(x) = sign(x)max(|x| ´ κ, 0) for some κ ě 0. The soft thresholding is equivalent to minimizing the nuclear norm of a matrix, which is a convex relaxation of rank. Both types of thresholding schemes adaptively change the ranks during iteration process.\nThe truncated iteration approach has been already investigated and extensively tested for several very large-scale data applications using various low-rank tensor formats, especially for:\n• Solving huge systems of linear equations and discretization of PDEs by iterative algorithms (e.g., Richardson, CG GMRES) and combined with CP format [Beylkin and Mohlenkamp, 2005, Khoromskij and Schwab, 2011], CP and Tucker formats [Billaud-Friess et al., 2014], TT format [Dolgov, 2013, Khoromskij and Oseledets, 2010], HT format [Bachmayr and Dahmen, 2015, Bachmayr and Schneider, 2016, Kressner and Tobler, 2011a], and a subspace projection method combined with HT format [Ballani and Grasedyck, 2013];\n• A subspace projection method combined with HT format [Ballani and Grasedyck, 2013];\n• Computing extreme eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors by Lanczos method combined with TT format [Huang et al., 2016, Huckle and Waldherr, 2012], preconditioned inverse iteration with TT format [Mach, 2013], block CG method (LOBPCG) combined with TT format [Lebedeva, 2011] and with HT format [Kressner and Tobler, 2011b];\n• Iterative hard thresholding for low-rank matrix/tensor completion [Foucart and Rauhut, 2013, Tanner and Wei, 2013].\nAn advantage of truncated iteration methods is that we do not need to construct tensor networks for a specific cost (loss) function. Moreover, theoretical global convergence properties hold under some restricted conditions (see [Bachmayr et al., 2016] for more detail). In addition, due to the analogy between low-rank truncation and sparse signal estimation techniques, truncated iteration-type algorithms are also suitable for largescale compressed sensing [Blumensath and Davies, 2009].\nHowever, truncated iteration methods have a few drawbacks. They require the estimation of several auxiliary vectors. In addition to\n145\nthe desired vector, x, right-hand vector, z, need to have a low-rank representation in the specific tensor format. For example, in the GMRES method [Dolgov, 2013], even if the solution vector and the right-hand side vector are well approximated by the TT format, the residuals and Krylov vectors involved in intermediate iterations usually have high TT ranks. Moreover, all the core tensors and factor matrices of the solution vector have to be truncated at each iteration step, which often incurs high computational costs, especially when ranks are large."

      "text" : "Methods of Riemannian Optimization (RO) have been recently a subject of great interest in data analytics communities; see, for example, [Absil et al., 2007, 2008, Bento et al., 2016, Bonnabel, 2013, Cambier and Absil, 2016]. Some optimization problems discussed in previous sections, can be naturally formulated on Riemannian manifolds, so as to directly benefit from the underlying geometric structures that can be exploited to significantly reduce the cost of obtaining solutions. Moreover, from a Riemannian geometry point of view, constrained optimization problems can often be viewed as unconstrained ones. It is therefore natural to ask whether Riemannian optimization can also help open up new research directions in conjunction with tensor networks; see for example [Ishteva et al., 2011, Kasai and Mishra, 2015, Sato et al., 2017, Steinlechner, 2016a, Zhou et al., 2016].\nRiemannian optimization for tensors can be formulated in the following generalized form\nmin XPMr J(X), (3.100)\nwhere J(X) is a scalar cost function of tensor variables and the search space, Mr, is smooth, in the sense of a differentiable manifold structure. Note that to perform optimization, the cost function needs to be defined for points on the manifoldMr. The optimization problem in the form (3.100) is quite general, and most of the basic optimization problems can be cast into this form.\nIn our applications of RO, Mr is a certain low-rank tensor manifold. One of the potential advantages of using Riemannian optimization tools for tensors is therefore that the intrinsic geometric and algebraic properties of\n146\nthe manifold allow us to convert a constrained optimization problems to an unconstrained one, in other words, to perform unconstrained optimization on a constrained space.\nManifold structure for Tucker model. The Riemannian optimization (also called the differential geometric optimization) has been successfully applied to the computation of the best Tucker approximation [Ishteva et al., 2009, 2011, Steinlechner, 2016a], whereby the Tucker manifold structure can be formulated through a set of Tucker tensors of fixed multilinear rank rML = tR1, . . . , RNu\nMr := tX P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN | rankML(X) = rMLu,\nwhich forms a smooth embedded submanifold of RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN of dimension\ndimMr = N ź\nn=1\nRn + N ÿ\nn=1\n(Rn In ´ R2n). (3.101)\nManifold structure for TT model. The set of TT tensors of fixed TTrank, rTT = tR1, . . . , RN´1u, given by\nMr := tX P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN | rank(X)TT = rTT],\nforms a smooth embedded submanifold of RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN of dimension\ndimMr = N ÿ\nn=1\nRn´1 InRn ´ N´1 ÿ\nn=1\nR2n, (3.102)\nwith RN = 1. If the inner product of two tensors induces a Euclidean metric on the embedding space RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN , then the above submanifold Mr is a Riemannian manifold [Holtz et al., 2012b, Steinlechner, 2016a, Uschmajew and Vandereycken, 2013].\nSimilar results are also available for the more general hierarchical Tucker models. For example, [Uschmajew and Vandereycken, 2013] developed the manifold structure for the HT tensors, while Lubich et al. [2013] developed the concept of dynamical low-rank approximation for both HT and TT formats. Moreover, Riemannian optimization in the Tucker and TT/HT formats has been successfully applied to large-scale tensor completion problems [Da Silva and Herrmann, 2013, Kasai and Mishra, 2015, Zhou et al., 2016].\nIt is important to emphasize that the condition of full TN rank is a pre-requisite for the sets Mr to be smooth manifolds. Otherwise, a set of\n147\ntensors for which the ranks are only bounded from above by Rmax would no longer be a smooth manifold, but an algebraic variety, for which special optimization methods are needed, at least for theoretical justification.\nThe fundamental and basic algorithms for Riemannian optimization [Absil et al., 2008] are quite attractive, but are still not widely used as they are more technically complicated than, e.g., standard gradient descent or conjugate gradient (CG) used in the classical optimization algorithms of low-rank tensor manifolds. However, in many cases Riemannian manifolds can be relatively easily implemented and often provide much better performance than the standard algorithms [Kasai and Mishra, 2015, Kressner et al., 2014b].\nThe MANOPT package [Boumal et al., 2014] (for a Python version see [Koep and Weichwald, 2016]) provides a useful interface for many standard matrix Riemannian optimization techniques, however, extensions for tensors (especially in high dimensions) are not easy and should be performed very carefully. The key idea is to work in the full space, but with the restrictions: i) the solution lies on a non-linear smooth manifold, and ii) the manifold condition is enforced implicitly (i.e., the derivatives with respect to the parametrization are not explicitly used).\nIn order to apply optimization algorithms based on line search, we must consider a direction on a manifold. The tangent space at X P Mr is the set of all tangent vectors (directions) at X, denoted by TXMr. The tangent space is a linear space, which, at a point on the manifold, provides us with a vector space of tangent vectors that allow us to find a search direction on the manifold. A Riemannian metric allows us to compute the angle and length of directions (tangent vectors). Roughly speaking, the optimization is performed on the tangent space, by either performing linear search or building a local model, in order to estimate the tangent vector and perform the next iteration on the manifold. The retraction operator provides a method to map the tangent vector to the next iterate (see the next section).\nThe smoothness condition of the manifold is crucial, since this allows us to define a tangent space, TXMr, for each point on the manifold, which locally approximates the manifold with second-order accuracy. Such a linearization of the manifold allows us to compute the next approximation restricted to the tangent space, which is a linear subspace. We shall next describe the general setting in which Riemannian optimization resides.\n148"

For a sufficiently small α, the value of the cost function J(X) will decrease. However, this does not provide a restriction that Xk+1 should lie on a manifold; although Xk is on the manifold, the step in the direction of the negative gradient will leave the manifold. If the manifold is a linear subspace, then the solution is quite simple — we just need to take a projected gradient step, i.e., project ∇J(Xk) to this subspace. For a general smooth manifold we can do the same, but the projection is computed onto the tangent space of the manifold at the current iteration point, that is\nXk+1 = Xk ´ αkPTXkMr(∇J(Xk)).

This is, however, not guaranteed for the discretized version in (3.103), which can be viewed as a forward Euler scheme applied to (3.104). This also has important computational consequences.\nAn iterative optimization algorithm involves the computation of a search direction and then performing a step in that direction. Note that all iterations on a manifoldMr should be performed by following geodesics11. However, in general geodesics may be either expensive to compute or even not available in a closed form. To this end, in practice, we relax the constraint of moving along geodesics by applying the concept of Retraction, which is any map RX : TXMr ÑMr that locally approximates a geodesic, up to first order, thereby reducing the computational cost of the update and ensuring convergence of iterative algorithms.\nMore precisely the Retraction can be defined, as follows\n11A geodesic is the shortest path on the manifold, which generalizes the concept of straight lines in Euclidean space.\n149\nDefinition 1 [Adler et al., 2002] A mapping RX is called the retraction, if\n1.

(3.105)\nFigure 3.23 illustrates the three-step procedure within the Riemannian gradient descent iteration given in (3.105). From the implementation viewpoint, the main difficulty is to compute the projection of the gradient PTXkMr(∇J(Xk)). For the optimization problems mentioned above, this projection can be computed without forming the full gradient.\n150"

The idea of vector transport is quite simple: it represents a mapping from one tangent space TXMr, to another tangent space, TYMr. For low-rank matrix/tensor manifolds, the orthogonal projection to a tangent space PTYMr is an example of a vector transport.\nRiemannian CG Method. Figure 3.24 illustrates the vector transport during a Riemannian CG iteration, which transforms a tangent vector in TXMr at a certain point X P Mr to another tangent space TYMr at Y P Mr. In the Riemannian CG iteration, the previous update direction ηk´1 P TXk´1Mr is mapped to a tangent vector in TXkMr, and the transformed vector is combined with the Riemannian (projected) gradient vector to complete the CG iteration.

Recently, in order to achieve a better global convergence, an alternative version of the Riemannian Newton method called the Trust-Region scheme was developed by Absil et al.

Indeed, some fundamental results can be found in the quantum molecular dynamics community which has used the so-called Multi Configurational Time-Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method already since the 1990s [Manthe et al., 1992]. As an example, consider a time-varying matrix A(t) which we wish to approximate by a low-rank matrix X(t). Of course, this can be achieved on a sample-by-sample basis, by computing SVD for each t, but this does not involve any “memory” about the previous steps.\nA Dirac-Frenkel principle states that the optimal trajectory should not minimize the distance }A(t)´ Y(t)} over all matrices of rank R, but instead the local dynamics given by\n}dA dt ´ dY dt }. (3.113)\nFor the Euclidean norm, the minimization of the cost function (3.113) leads the following differential equations on manifoldMr\ndY dt = PTYMr dA dt , Y(0) PMr. (3.114)\nIn other words, the approximated trajectory Y(t) is such that the velocity dYdt always lies in the tangent space, and thus the trajectory always stays on the manifold. The dynamical approximation in (3.114) allows us to construct (and actually strictly define) low-rank approximation to the dynamical systems. If A(t) admits the representation\ndA dt = F(A, t), (3.115)\nwhich is a typical case in quantum mechanics, where the idea was first proposed, we obtain a dynamical system for the point on a low-rank manifold in the form\ndY dt = PTYMr F(Y, t). (3.116)\nSuch a system can be efficiently treated using only the parametrization of a point on a such manifold, thereby greatly reducing the cost (and if the manifold approximates the solution well,with a sufficiently good accuracy). Note that the continuous variant of the Riemannian gradient in (3.103) can be written exactly in the form (3.116), with\nF(Y, t) = ´∇J.\n155\nRetraction is needed only in the discrete case, since in the continuous case the exact solution lies exactly on the manifold. Thus, if we have an efficient way to solve (3.116) numerically, that would give an efficient way of solving Riemannian optimization problems.\nThere are two straightforward ways of solving (3.116). The original approach of Koch and Lubich [2007] (later generalized to the Tucker and TT models [Koch and Lubich, 2010]) is to write down ordinary differential equations for the parameters U(t), S(t), V(t) of the SVD like decomposition in the form\nY(t) = U(t)S(t)VT(t).\nThe second approach is also straightforward: apply any time integration scheme to the equation (3.116). In this case, a standard method will yield the solution which is not on the manifold, and a retraction would be needed. In Lubich and Oseledets [2014] a simple and efficient solution to this problem, referred to as the projector-splitting scheme, was proposed, based on the special structure of the manifold. This stable and explicit second-order scheme for the integration of (3.116) examines the projector onto the tangent space\nPTYMr Z = UU TZ + ZVVT ´UUTZVVT = PU + PV ´ PUV ,\nand represents it as a sum of three projectors, in order to apply the classical Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme. For each projector, the equations of dynamical low-rank approximations can now be easily integrated. Indeed, the equation\ndY dt = dA dt VVT,\nhas a simple solution; the V component does not change and the new point is just\nY1 = Y0 + (A1 ´A0)V, (3.117)\nwhere A1 = A(t + h), A0 = A(t). Similar formulas are valid for PV and PUV . What is not trivial is the order in which the splitting steps are taken: we should make a step in PU , then in PUV , and then in PV . This leads to a much better convergence, and moreover an exactness result [Lubich and Oseledets, 2014] can be proven if A1 and A0 are on the manifold, and Y0 = A0, then this scheme is exact.\nThrough the link with the Riemannian optimization, the projectorsplitting scheme can be also used here, which can be viewed as a secondorder retraction [Absil and Oseledets, 2015]. A simple form can be obtained\n156\nfor a given X and a step Z, where for the matrix case the retraction is\nU1S 1 2 = QR((X + Z)V0), V1ST1 = QR((X + Z) TU1).\nThis is just one step of a block power method, applied to (X+Z). Although this is only a crude approximation of the SVD of (X + Z) which is the standard retraction, the projector-splitting retraction is also a second-order retraction.\nThe generalization to the TT network was proposed by Lubich et al. [2015], and can be implemented within the framework of sweeping algorithms, allowing for the efficient TT-approximation of dynamical systems and solution of optimization problems with non-quadratic functionals."

One way forward is to look for the desingularization [Khrulkov and Oseledets, 2016], another technique is to employ the concept of tangent bundle.

Consider the training data, t(xm, ym)uMm=1, where xm = [x1,m, . . . , xN,m]T is an N-dimensional feature vector and ym the target value of the m-th object.\nIn the special case of N = 3, the linear model which incorporates interactions between the features x1, x2 and x3, can be described by\npy(x) = w000 + w100x1 + w010x2 + w001x3 + w110x1x2 + w101x1x3 + w011x2x3 + w111x1x2x3,\nwhere the parameters wijk denote the strength of interactions between the features xi, xj and xk (see also Chapter 1).\nNote that in the general case of N features, the number of pairwise interactions is O(N2), and the number of all possible interactions grows exponentially as O(2N).

See [Novikov et al., 2016] for more technical details, such as the initialization, step-size selection and dropout.\nThis Riemannian optimization algorithm has been successfully applied to analyze formally a tensor with 2160 entries (i.e. to analyze a text with 160 words, where interactions between all words have been exploited). Furthermore, the Exponential Machine has been applied to a recommender system datasets MovieLens with 105 users [Novikov et al., 2016]."

The disadvantage is that without additional tricks, the optimization is performed with full matrices, whereas the Riemannian approach still works in the low-parametric representation, which makes it more efficient especially in the tensor case. Attempts have been made to generalize the nuclear norm concept to the tensor case [Phien et al., 2016], but a recent negative result shows that it is not possible to provide a good convex surrogate for the TT-manifold [Rauhut et al., 2016], thus making the Riemannian optimization the most promising tool for low-rank constrained optimization. For enhanced efficiency it is desirable to create instruments for the construction of such methods in the spirit of modern deep learning frameworks that are based on automatic differentiation techniques. The Pymanopt [Koep and Weichwald, 2016] is the first step in this direction, but it is still quite far from big-data problems, since it works with full matrices even for a low-rank manifold, and in the tensor case that would be prohibitive. The stochastic variants of the Riemannian gradient can be readily derived [Bonnabel, 2013, Novikov et al., 2016, Shalit et al., 2010] and such methods are applicable to a large number of data points (similar to stochastic gradient descent). Derivation of methods which are more complex than Riemannian stochastic gradient descent is still work in progress.\n160"

The TT toolbox supports advanced applications, which rely on solving sets of linear equations (including the AMEn algorithm), symmetric eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), and inverse/psudoinverse of huge matrices.\nRelated and complementary algorithms implemented by Kressner et al. [2014a] are available within the MATLAB TTeMPS Toolbox (http://anchp.epfl.ch/TTeMPS). This MATLAB toolbox is designed to accommodate various algorithms in the Tensor Train (TT) / Matrix Product States (MPS) format, making use of the object-oriented programming techniques in current MATLAB versions. It also provides an implementation of the efficient AMEn algorithm for calculating multiple extremal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of high-dimensional symmetric eigenvalue decompositions.\nFor standard TDs (CPD, Tucker models) the Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB, originally developed by Kolda and Bader, provides several general-purpose functions and special facilities for handling sparse, dense, and structured TDs [Bader and Kolda, 2006, 2015], while the N-Way Toolbox for MATLAB, by Andersson and Bro, was developed mostly for Chemometrics applications [Andersson and Bro, 2000].\nThe Tensorlab toolbox developed by Vervliet, Debals, Sorber, Van Barel and De Lathauwer builds upon a complex optimization framework and offers efficient numerical algorithms for computing the CP, BTD, and constrained Tucker decompositions. The toolbox includes a library of many constraints (e.g., nonnegativity, orthogonality) and offers the possibility to combine and jointly factorize dense, sparse and incomplete tensors [Vervliet et al., 2016]. The new release introduces a tensorization framework and offers enhanced support for handling large-scale and structured multidimensional datasets. Furthermore, sophisticated tools for the visualization of tensors of an arbitrary order are also available.\nOur own developments include the TDALAB (http://bsp.brain. riken.jp/TDALAB) and TENSORBOX Matlab toolboxes (http://www.bsp.\n161\nbrain.riken.jp/~phan), which provide a user-friendly interface and advanced algorithms for basic tensor decompositions (CP, Tucker, BTD) [Phan et al., 2012, Zhou and Cichocki, 2013].\nThe Hierarchical Tucker toolbox by Kressner and Tobler (http://www. sam.math.ethz.ch/NLAgroup/htucker_toolbox.html) focuses mostly on HT type of tensor networks [Kressner and Tobler, 2014], which avoid explicit computation of the SVDs when truncating a tensor which is already in a HT format [Espig et al., 2012, Grasedyck et al., 2013, Kressner and Tobler, 2014].\nIn quantum physics and chemistry, a number of software packages have been developed in the context of DMRG techniques for simulating quantum networks. One example is the intelligent Tensor (iTensor) by Stoudenmire and White [2014], an open source C++ library for rapid development of tensor network algorithms. The iTensor is competitive against other available software packages for basic DMRG calculations, and is especially well suited for developing next-generation tensor network algorithms.\nThe Universal Tensor Network Library (Uni10), developed in C++ by Ying-Jer Kao, provides algorithms for tensor network contraction and a convenient user interface (http://uni10.org/about.html). The library is aimed towards more complex tensor networks such as PEPS and MERA [Kao et al., 2015]. The Kawashima group in the University of Tokyo has developed a parallel C + + library for tensor calculations, “mptensor” (https://github.com/smorita/mptensor). This is the first library which can perform parallel tensor network computation on supercomputers.\nTensor Networks for huge-scale optimization problems are still in their infancy, however, comprehensive computer experiments over a number of diverse applications have validated the significant performance advantages, enabled by this technology. The following paradigms for large-scale structured datasets represented by TNs have been considered in the recent publications listed below:\n• Symmetric EVD, PCA, CCA, SVD and related problems [Dolgov et al., 2014, Kressner and Macedo, 2014, Kressner et al., 2014a, Lee and Cichocki, 2015],\n• Solution of huge linear systems of equations, together with the inverse/pseudoinverse of matrices and related problems [Bolten et al., 2016, Dolgov, 2013, Dolgov and Savostyanov, 2014, Lee and Cichocki, 2016b, Oseledets and Dolgov, 2012],\n162\n• Tensor completion problems [Grasedyck et al., 2015, Karlsson et al., 2016, Kressner et al., 2014b, Steinlechner, 2016b],\n• Low-rank tensor network methods for dynamical and parametric problems [Cho et al., 2016, Garreis and Ulbrich, 2017, Liao et al., 2015, Lubich et al., 2015],\n• TT/HT approximation of nonlinear functions and systems [Dolgov and Khoromskij, 2013, Khoromskij, 2011b, Khoromskij and Miao, 2014],\n• CP decomposition and its applications [Choi and Vishwanathan, 2014, Kamal et al., 2016, Kang et al., 2012, Shin et al., 2017, Vervliet and Lathauwer, 2016, Wang et al., 2015, Wetzstein et al., 2012],\n• Tucker decompositions and their applications [Caiafa and Cichocki, 2013, 2015, Jeon et al., 2015, 2016, Oseledets et al., 2008, Zhao et al., 2016, Zhe et al., 2016a],\n• TT/HT decompositions and their applications in numerical methods for scientific computing [Benner et al., 2016, Corona et al., 2015, Dolgov et al., 2016, Khoromskaia and Khoromskij, 2016, Khoromskij and Veit, 2016,?, Litsarev and Oseledets, 2016, Zhang et al., 2015b],\n• Classification and clustering problems using the TT format [Stoudenmire and Schwab, 2016, Sun et al., 2016, Zhe et al., 2016b].\nWhen it comes to the implementation, the recently introduced TensorFlow system is an open-source platform, developed by Google, which uses hardware tensor processing units and provides particularly strong support for deep neural networks applications."

      "text" : "In this chapter, we have demonstrated that tensor networks are promising tools for very large-scale optimization problems, numerical methods (scientific computing) and dimensionality reduction. As we move towards real-world applications, it is important to highlight that the TN approach requires the following two assumptions to be satisfied:\n1. Datasets admit sufficiently good low-rank TN approximations,\n163\n2. Approximate solutions are acceptable.\nChallenging issues that remain to be addressed in future research include the extension of the low-rank tensor network approach to complex constrained optimization problems with multiple constraints, non-smooth penalty terms, and/or sparsity and/or nonnegativity constraints. It would be particularly interesting to investigate low-rank tensor networks for the following optimization problems, for which efficient algorithms do exist for small- to medium-scale datasets:\n1.

When Q = 0 then the above QP problem reduces to the standard form of Linear Program (LP).\nIf the nonnegativity constraints, x ě 0, are replaced by conic constraints, x P K, then the standard QP becomes a quadratic conic program, while Semidefinite Programs (SDPs) are the generalization of linear programs to matrices. In the standard form, an SDP minimizes a linear function of a matrix, subject to linear equality constraints and a positive definite matrix constraint\nmin Xľ0\ntr(CX) + γ tr(Xq), s.t. tr(AiX) = bi, i = 1, . . . , I,\nwhere Ai, C and X are NˆN square matrices and X must be a positive definite matrix.\n164\nAnother important generalization of LPs is Semi-Infinite Linear Programs (SILPs), which are linear programs with infinitely many constraints. In other words, SILPs minimize a linear cost function subject to an infinite number of linear constraints.\n3.

(3.130)\nThe solution to these open problems would be important for a more wide-spread use of low-rank tensor approximations in practical applications.\nAdditional important and challenging issues that have to be addressed include:\n• Development of new parallel algorithms for wider classes of optimization problems, with the possibility to incorporate diverse cost functions and constraints. Most of algorithms described in this monograph are sequential; parallelizing such algorithms is important but not trivial.\n• Development of efficient algorithms for tensor contractions. Tensors in TT and HT formats can be relatively easily optimized, however, contracting a complex tensor network with cycles (loops) such as PEPS, PEPO, and MERA, is a complex task which requires large computational resources. Indeed, for complex tensor network structures, the time needed to perform an exact contraction may in some cases increase exponentially with the order of the tensor. The work in this direction is important because, although approximate contractions may be sufficient for certain applications, they may also brings difficulties in controlling the approximation error.\n166\n• Finding the “best” tensor network structures or tensor network formats for specific datasets or specific applications, so as to provide low-rank TN approximations of a sufficiently low-order and with a relatively low computational complexity.\nThe term “best” is used here in the sense of a tensor network which provides linear or sub-linear compression of large-scale datasets, so as to reduce storage cost and computational complexity to affordable levels.\nIn other words, the challenge is to develop more sophisticated and flexible tensor networks, whereby the paradigm shift is in a full integration of complex systems and optimization problems, e.g., a system which simulates the structure of biological molecule [Savostyanov et al., 2014].\n• Current implementations of tensor train decompositions and tensor contractions still require a number of tuning parameters, such as the approximation accuracy and the estimation of TN ranks. A step forward would be the development of improved and semiautomatic criteria for the control of approximation accuracy, and a priori errors bounds. In particular, the unpredictable accumulation of the rounding error and the problem of TT-rank explosion should be carefully addressed.\n• Convergence analysis tools for TN algorithms are still being developed but are critical in order to better understand convergence properties of such algorithms.\n• Theoretic and methodological approaches are needed to determine the kind of constraints imposed on factor matrices/cores, so as to be able to extract only the most significant features or only the desired hidden (latent) variables with meaningful physical interpretations.\n• Investigations into the uniqueness of various TN decompositions and their optimality properties (or lack thereof) are a prerequisite for the development of faster and/or more reliable algorithms.\n• Techniques to visualize huge-scale tensors in tensor network formats are still missing and are urgently needed.\n167\nChapter 4\nTensor Networks for Deep Learning\nRecent breakthroughs in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have been largely triggered by the emergence of the class of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), often simply called CNNs. The CNNs have become a vehicle for a large number of practical applications and commercial ventures in computer vision, speech recognition, language processing, drug discovery, biomedical informatics, recommender systems, robotics, gaming, and artificial creativity, to mention just a few.\nIt is important to recall that widely used linear classifiers, such as the SVM and STM discussed in Chapter 2, can be considered as shallow feedforward neural networks (NN). They therefore inherit the limitations of shallow NNs, when compared to deep neural networks1 (DNNs), which include:\n• Inability to deal with highly nonlinear data, unless sophisticated kernel techniques are employed;\n• Cumbersome and non-generic extensions to multi-class paradigms2;\n• Incompatibility of their shallow architectures to learn high-level features which can only be learnt through a multiscale approach, that is, via DNNs.\n1A deep neural network comprises two or more processing (hidden) layers in between the input and output layers, in contrast to a shallow NN, which has only one hidden layer.\n2The multi-class version of the linear STM model is essentially either a one-versus-rest or one-versus-one extension of the two-class version.\n168\nThe renaissance of deep learning neural networks [Goodfellow et al., 2016, LeCun et al., 2015, Schmidhuber, 2015, Schneider, 2017] has both created an active frontier of research in machine learning and has provided many advantages in applications, to the extent that the performance of DNNs in multi-class classification problems can be similar or even better than what is achievable by humans.\nDeep learning is also highly interesting in very large-scale data analytics, since:\n1. Regarding the degree of nonlinearity and multi-level representation ability of features, deep neural networks often significantly outperform their shallow counterparts;\n2. High-level representations learnt by deep NN models, that are easily interpretable by humans, can also help us to understand the complex information processing mechanisms and multi-dimensional interaction of neuronal populations in the human brain;\n3. In big data analytics, deep learning is very promising for mining structured data, e.g., for hierarchical multi-class classification of a huge number of images.\nRemark. It is well known that both shallow and deep NNs are universal function approximators3 in the sense of their ability to approximate arbitrarily well any continuous function of N variables on a compact domain; this is achieved under the condition that a shallow neural network has an unbounded width (i.e., the size of a hidden layer), that is, an unlimited number of parameters. In other words, a shallow NN may require a huge (intractable) number of parameters (curse of dimensionality), while DNNs can perform such approximations using a much smaller number of parameters.\nDespite recent advances in the theory of DNNs, for a continuing success and future perspectives of DNNs (especially DCNNs), the following fundamental challenges need to be further addressed:\n• Ability to generalize while avoiding overfitting in the learning process;\n3Universality refers to the ability of a neural network to approximate any function, when no restrictions are imposed on its size (width). On the other hand, depth efficiency refers to the phenomenon whereby a function realized by polynomially-sized deep neural network requires shallow neural networks to have super-polynomial (exponential) size for the same accuracy of approximation (curse of dimensionality). This is often referred to as the expressive power of depth.\n169\n• Fast learning and the avoidance of “bad” local and spurious minima, especially for highly nonlinear score (objective) functions;\n• Rigorous investigation of the conditions under which deep neural networks are “much better” than the shallow networks (i.e., NNs with one hidden layer);\n• Theoretical and practical bounds on the expressive power of a specific architecture, i.e., quantification of the ability to approximate or learn wide classes of unknown nonlinear functions;\n• Ways to reduce the number of parameters without a dramatic reduction in performance.\nThe aim of this chapter is to discuss the many advantages of tensor networks in addressing the last two of the above challenges and to build up both intuitive and mathematical links between DNNs and TNs. Revealing such inherent connections will both cross-fertilize the areas of deep learning and tensor networks and provide new insights. In addition to establishing the existing and developing new links, this will also help to optimize existing DNNs and/or generate new, more powerful, architectures.\nWe start with an intuitive account of DNNs based on a simplified hierarchical Tucker (HT) model, followed by alternative simple and efficient architectures. Finally, more sophisticated TNs, such as MERA and 2D tensor network models are briefly discussed in order to enable more flexibility, potentially improved performance, and/or higher expressive power of the next generation DCNNs."

      "text" : "Several research groups have recently investigated the application of tensor decompositions to simplify DNNs and to establish links between deep learning and low-rank tensor networks [Chen et al., 2017, Cohen et al., 2016, Lebedev and Lempitsky, 2015, Novikov et al., 2015, Poggio et al., 2016, Yang and Hospedales, 2016]. For example, Chen et al. [2017] presented a general and constructive connection between Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and TNs, together with the correspondence between\n170\ngeneral Boltzmann machines and the TT/MPS model (see detail in the next section).\nIn a series of research papers [Cohen and Shashua, 2016, Cohen and Shashua, 2016, Cohen et al., 2016, Sharir et al., 2016] the expressive power of a class of DCNNs was analyzed using simplified Hierarchal Tucker (HT) models (see the next sections). Particulary, Convolutional Arithmetic Circuits (ConvAC), also known as Sum-Product Networks, and Convolutional Rectifier Networks (CRN) have been theoretically analyzed as variants of the HT model. The authors claim that a shallow (single hidden layer) network corresponds to the CP (rank-1) tensor decomposition, whereas a deep network with log2 N hidden layers realizes or corresponds to the HT decomposition (see the next section). Some authors also argued that the “unreasonable success” of deep learning can be explained by inherent laws of physics within the theory of TNs, which often employ physical constraints of locality, symmetry, compositional hierarchical functions, entropy, and polynomial log-probability, that are imposed on the measurements or input training data [Chen et al., 2017, Lin and Tegmark, 2016, Poggio et al., 2016].\nThis all suggests that a very wide range of tensor networks can be potentially used to model and analyze some specific classes of DNNs, in order to obtain simpler and/or more efficient neural networks in the sense of enhanced expressive power or reduced complexity. In other words, consideration of tensor networks in this context may give rise to new NN architectures which could even be superior to the existing ones; this topic has so far been overlooked by practitioners.\nFurthermore, by virtue of redundancy present in both TNs and DNNs, methods used for the reduction or approximation of TNs may become a vehicle to achieve more efficient DNNs, and with a reduced number of parameters. Also, given that usually neither TNs nor DNNs are unique (two NNs with different connection weights and biases may be modeling the same nonlinear function), the knowledge about redundancy in TNs can help simplify DNNs.\nThe general concept of optimization of DNNs via TNs is illustrated in Figure 4.1. For a specific DNN, we first construct its equivalent or corresponding TN representation; then the TN is transformed into a reduced or canonical form by performing, e.g., truncated SVD. This will reduce the rank value to the minimal requirement determined by a desired accuracy of approximation. Finally, the reduced and optimized TN is mapped back to another DNN of similar universal approximation power to the original DNN, but with a considerably reduced number of parameters.\n171\nThis follows from the fact that a rounded (approximated) TN has a smaller number of parameters.\nIt should be noted that, in practice, the reduction of DNNs through lowrank TN approximations offers many potential advantages over a direct reduction of redundant DNNs, owing to the availability of many efficient optimization methods to reduce the number of parameters and achieve a pre-specified approximation error. Moreover, low-rank tensor networks are capable of avoiding the curse of dimensionality through low-order sparsely interconnected core tensors.\nOn the other hand, in the past two decades, quantum physicists and computer scientists have developed solid theoretical understanding and efficient numerical techniques for low-rank TN decompositions, especially the TT/MPS and TT/MPO. The entanglement entropy4, Renyi’s\n4Entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles, such as photons, electrons, or qubits, are generated or interact in such way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others, so that a quantum state must be described for the system as a whole. Entanglement entropy is therefore a\n172\nentropy, entanglement spectrum and long-range correlations are the most widely used quantities (calculated from a spatial reduced density matrix) investigated in the theory of tensor networks. The spatial reduced density matrix is determined by splitting a TN into two parts, say, regions A and B, where a density matrix in region A is generated by integrating out all the degrees of freedom in region B. The entanglement spectra are determined by the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix [Eisert et al., 2010, Zwanziger, 1994]. Entanglement entropy also characterizes the information content of a bipartition of a specific TN. Furthermore, the entanglement area law explains that the entanglement entropy increases only proportionally to the boundary between the two tensor sub-networks. Also, entanglement entropy characterizes the information content of the distribution of singular values of a matricized tensor, and can be viewed as a proxy for the correlations between the two partitions; uncorrelated data has zero entanglement entropy at any bipartition.\nNote that TNs are usually designed to efficiently represent large systems which exhibit a relatively low entanglement entropy. In practice, similar to deep neural networks, we often need to only care about a small fraction of the input measurements or training data among a huge number of possible inputs. This all suggest that certain guiding principles in DNNs correspond to the entanglement area law used in the theory of tensor networks. These may then be used to quantify the expressive power of a wide class of DCNNs. Note that long range correlations also typically increase with the entanglement. We therefore conjecture that realistic datasets in most successful machine learning applications have relatively low entanglement entropies [Calabrese and Cardy, 2004]. On the other hand, by exploiting the entanglement entropy bound of TNs, we can rigorously quantify the expressive power of a wide class of DNNs applied to complex and highly correlated datasets."

Strictly speaking, entanglement entropy is a measure of how quantum information is stored in a quantum state and is mathematically expressed as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix.\n173\nprobability distributions of a variety of input data, including natural image and speech signals.\nThe RBMs are fundamental basic building blocks in a class of Deep (restricted) Boltzmann Machines (DBMs) and Deep Belief Nets (DBNs). In such deep neural networks, after training one RBM layer, the values of its hidden units can be treated as data for training higher-level RBMs (see Figure 4.3).\nTo create an RBM, we first perform a partition of variables into at least two sets: visible (observed) variables, v P RM, and hidden variables, h P RK. The goal of RBMs is then to learn a higher-order latent representation, h P RK, typically for binary variables5, within a bipartite undirected graphical model encoding these two layers, as illustrated in Figure 4.2(a).\nThe basic idea is that the hidden units of a trained RBM represent relevant features of observations. In other words, an RBM is a probabilistic graphical model based on a layer of hidden variables, which is used to build the probability distribution over input variables. The standard RBM assigns energy to a joint configuration (v, h) as (see Figure 4.2(b))\nE(v, h; θ) = ´(F (v) + vTWh + aTv + bTh), (4.1)\nwhere a P RM and b P RK are the biases corresponding to the visible and hidden variables, W P RMˆK is the (coupling) matrix of mapping parameters, θ = ta, b, Wu is a set of the model parameters to be estimated, and F (v) is a type-specific function, e.g., F (v) = 0 for a binary input and F (v) = ´0.5 ř\nm v 2 m for Gaussian variables. Such an RBM model obeys the\nBoltzmann distribution for binary variables, as follows\np(v, h | θ) = 1 Z(θ) exp (´E(v, h; θ)) , (4.2)\nwhere Z(θ) is the normalization constant. The absence of connections between hidden binary variables within RBMs allows us to calculate relatively easily the marginal distribution of the visible variables, as follows\np(v | θ) = ÿ\nh\np(v, h | θ) = 1 Z ÿ\nh\nexp (´E(v, h; θ)) (4.3)\n= 1 Z\nM ź\nm=1\nexp (amvm) K ź\nk=1\n( 1 + exp ( bk + M ÿ\nm=1\nwmkvm\n)) ,\n5There are several extensions of RBMs for continuous data values.\n174\nand the distribution of the hidden variables\np(h | θ) = ÿ v p(v, h | θ) = 1 Z ÿ v exp(´E(v, h; θ)) (4.4)\n= 1 Z exp\n( K ÿ\nk=1\nbkhk\n) M ź\nm=1\n( 1 + exp ( am + K ÿ\nk=1\nwmkhk\n)) .\nThe above formulas indicate that an RBM can be regarded as a product of\n176\n“experts”, in which a number of experts for individual observations are combined multiplicatively [Fischer and Igel, 2012].\nThe RBM model can be converted into an equivalent (or corresponding) tensor network model. Figure 4.2(c) [Chen et al., 2017] shows that such a tensor network model comprises a set of interconnected diagonal core tensors: Kth-order tensors Λ(m)v = diagK(1, e\nam) and Mth-order tensors Λ\n(k) h = diagM(1, e bk), all of sizes 2 ˆ 2 ˆ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆ 2. This means that the core tensors are extremely sparse since only the diagonal entries Λ (m) v (1, 1, . . . , 1) = 1, Λ (m) v (2, 2, . . . , 2) = eam , and Λ (k) h (1, 1, . . . , 1) = 1 , Λ(k)h (2, 2, . . . , 2) = e bk are non-zero. The diagonal core tensors in the visible and hidden layer are interconnected via the 2ˆ 2 matrices Cmk = [1, 1; 1, ewmk ].\nThe bipartite structure of the RBM enables units in one layer to become conditionally independent of the other layer. Thus, the conditional distributions over the hidden and visible variables can be factorized as\np(v|h; θ) = śM m=1 p(vm|h), p(h|v; θ) = K ź\nk=1\np(hk|v), (4.5)\nand\np(vm = 1|h) = σ ( ÿ\nk\nwmkhk + am\n) ,\np(hk = 1|v) = σ ( ÿ\nm wmkvm + bk\n) ,\n(4.6)\nwhere σ(x) = 1/(1 + exp(´x)) is the sigmoid function. Higher-order RBMs. The modeling power of an RBM can be enhanced by increasing the number of hidden units, or by adding and splitting visible layers and/or adding conditional and activation layers. The standard RBM can be generalized and extended in many different ways. The most natural way is to jointly express the energy for more than two set of variables. For example, for four sets of binary variables, v, h, x, y, the energy function (with neglected biases) can be expressed in the following form (see Figure 4.4)\nE(v, h, x, y) = ´ I ÿ\ni=1\nJ ÿ\nj=1\nM ÿ\nm=1\nK ÿ\nk=1\nwijmk xi yj vm hk\n= ´W ¯̂ 1 x ¯̂ 2 y ¯̂ 3 v ¯̂ 4h. (4.7)\n177\nUnfortunately, higher-order RBM models suffer from a large number of parameters, which scales with the product of visible, hidden and conditioning variables. To alleviate this problem, we can perform dimensionality reduction via low-rank tensor network approximations."

The TvRBMs are highly compact, in that the number of free parameters grows only linearly with the number of modes, while their multiway factoring of mapping parameters link data modes and hidden units. Modes interact in a multiplicative fashion gated by hidden units, and TvRBM uses tensor data and the hidden layer to construct an (N + 1)-mode tensor.\n179\n+ -A\nV\nJM + H\n-B IK\nV\nH\n-W (1) W (2)\nR\nI K\n-W\nJ M\nIn a TvRBM, the set of visible units is represented by an Nth-order tensor, V P RI1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN , and the hidden units h are the same as in RBM. The goal is to model the joint distribution, p(V, h), by the optimization of the energy function\nE(V, h; θ) = ´F (V)´ xA, Vy ´ bTh´ xW, V ˝ hy, (4.10)\nwhere F (V) is a type-specific function, A P RI1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN are visible biases, and W P RI1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆINˆK are mapping parameters.\nThe hidden posterior is then given by\np(hk = 1|V; θ) = σ (bk + xV, W(:, . . . , :, k)y) , (4.11)\nwhere σ(x) is the sigmoid function. The generative distribution, p(V|h), on the other hand is type-specific.\n180\nThe most popular cases are the binary and Gaussian inputs. For a binary input, we have F (V) = 0, and the following generative distribution\np(vi1i2 ...iN |h) = σ ( ai1i2 ...iN + W(i1, . . . , iN , :) T h ) . (4.12)\nFor a Gaussian input, assuming unit variance, i.e. F (V) = ´0.5xV, Vy, the generative distribution becomes\np(vi1i2...iN |h) = N ( tai1i2...in + W(i1, . . . , iN , :) T hu; 1 ) , (4.13)\nwhere 1 P RI1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN is the tensor with unit elements. A major problem with the parameterizations of W is the excessively large number of free parameters, which scales with the product of data modes and hidden dimensions. In particular, the (N + 1)th-order weight tensor W has K ś\nn In elements, and its size quickly reaches billions of entries, even when the mode dimensionalities K, (I1, . . . , IN) and N are quite moderate. This makes learning in the raw tensor format extremely difficult or even impossible, since robust estimation of parameters would require a huge dataset. To this end, low-rank tensor network decompositions can be employed to construct approximate interactions between visible modes and hidden units.\nIn the simplest scenario, we can approximately represent W by a rank-R CP tensor\nW = R ÿ\nr=1\nλr ¨ (w(1)r ˝ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˝w (N) r ˝w (N+1) r ) (4.14)\n= Λˆ1 W(1) ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN W(N) ˆN+1 W(N+1),\nwhere the matrix W(n) = [w(n)1 , . . . , w (n) R ] P RInˆR for n = 1, . . . , N represents the mode-factor weights, and W(N+1) = W(h) P RKˆR the hidden-factor matrix. Such factoring allows for multiplicative interactions between modes to be moderated by the hidden units through the hiddenfactor matrix W(h). Thus, the model captures the modes of variation through the new representation, enabled by h. By employing the CP decomposition, the number of mapping parameters may be reduced down to R(K + ř\nn In), which grows linearly rather than exponentially in N. Importantly, the conditional independence among intra-layer variables, i.e. p(h|V) =\nśK k=1 p(hk|V) and p(V|h) = ś n śIn in=1 p(vi1i2 ...iN |h), is not affected. Therefore, the model preserves the fast sampling and interface properties of RBM.\n181"

      "heading" : "4.3 Basic Features of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks",
      "text" : "Basic DCNNs are characterized by at least three features: locality, weight sharing (optional) and pooling, as explained below:\n• Locality refers to the connection of a (artificial) neuron to only neighboring neurons in the preceding layer, as opposed to being fed by the entire layer (this is consistent with biological NNs).\n• Weight sharing reflects the property that different neurons in the same layer, connected to different neighborhoods in the preceding layer, often share the same weights. Note that weight sharing, when combined with locality, gives rise to standard convolution6.\n• Pooling is essentially an operator which gradually decimates (reduces) layer sizes by replacing the local population of neural activations in a spatial window by a single value (e.g., by taking their maxima, average values or their scaled products). In the context of images, pooling induces invariance to translation, which often does not affect semantic content, and is interpreted as a way to create a hierarchy of abstractions in the patterns that neurons respond to [Anselmi et al., 2015, Cohen et al., 2016].\nUsually, DCNNs perform much better when dealing with compositional function approximations7 and multi-class classification problems than shallow neural network architectures with one hidden layer. In fact, DCNNs can even efficiently and conveniently select a subset of features for multiple classes, while for efficient learning a DCNN model can be pre-trained by first learning each DCNN layer, followed by fine tuning of the parameter of the entire model, using e.g., stochastic gradient descent. To summarize, deep learning neural networks have the ability to arbitrarily well exploit and approximate the complexity of compositional hierarchical functions, a wide class of functions to which shallow networks are blind.\n6Although weight sharing may reduce the complexity of a deep neural network, this step is optional. However, the locality at each layer is a key factor which gives DCNNs an exponential advantage over shallow NNs in terms of the representation ability [Anselmi et al., 2015, Mhaskar and Poggio, 2016, Poggio et al., 2016].\n7A compositional function can take, for example, the following form h1(¨ ¨ ¨ h3(h21(h11(x1, x2)h12(x3, x4)), h22(h13(x5, x6)h14(x7, x8)) ¨ ¨ ¨ ))).\n182"

Such a representation is quite natural for many high-dimensional data – in images, the local structures represent vectorization of patches consisting of S pixels, while in audio data can be represented through spectrograms.\nFor this kind of problems, DCNNs can be described by a set of multivariate score functions\ny = hc(x1, . . . , xN) = I1 ÿ\ni1=1\n¨ ¨ ¨ IN ÿ\niN=1\nW c(i1, . . . , iN) N ź\nn=1\nfθin (xn),\n(4.15)\nwhere W c P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN is an Nth-order coefficient tensor, with all dimensions In = I, @n, N is the number of (overlapped) input patches txnu, In is the size (dimension) of each mode W c, and fθ1 , . . . , fθIn are referred to as the representation functions (in the representation layer) selected from a parametric family of nonlinear functions8.\nIn general, the one-dimensional basis functions could be polynomials, splines or other sets of basis functions. Natural choices for this family of nonlinear functions are also radial basis functions (Gaussian RBFs), wavelets9, and affine functions followed by point-wise activations. Note that the representation functions in standard (artificial) neurons have the form\nfθi(x) = σ(w̃ T i x + bi), (4.16)\nfor the set of parameters θi = tw̃i, biu, where σ(¨) is a suitably chosen activation function.\nThe representation layer play a key role to transform the inputs, by means of I nonlinear functions, fθi(xn) (i = 1, 2, . . . , I), to template input patches, thereby creating I feature maps [Cohen and Shashua, 2016].

Equivalently, the representation layer can be described as a rank one tensor (see Figure 4.6(a))\nF = fθ(x1) ˝ fθ(x2) ˝ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˝ fθ(xN) P R I1ˆI2ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN . (4.18)\nThis allows us to represent the score function as an inner product of two tensors, as illustrated in Figure 4.6(a)\nhc(x1, . . . , xN) = xWc, Fy = Wc ¯̂ 1 fθ(x1) ¯̂ 2 fθ(x2) ¨ ¨ ¨ ¯̂ N fθ(xN).

The grid tensor of the nonlinear score function hc(x1, , ..., xN) determined over all the templates x(1), x(2), ..., x(I) can be expressed, as follows\nW(hc) = Wc ˆ1 Fˆ2 F ¨ ¨ ¨ ˆN F. (4.20)\nOf course, since the order N of the coefficient (core) tensor is large, it cannot be implemented, or even saved on a computer due to the curse of dimensionality.\nTo this end, we represent the weight tensor in some low-rank tensor network format with a smaller number of parameters. A simple model is the CP representation, which leads to a shallow network as illustrated in Figure 4.6(c). However, this approach is associated with two problems: (i) the rank R of the coefficient tensor Wc can be very large (so compression ratio cannot be very high), (ii) the existing CP decomposition algorithms are not very stable for very high-order tensors, and so an alternative promising approach would be to apply tensor networks such as HT that enable us to avoid the curse of dimensionality.\nFollowing the representation layer, a DCNN may consists of a cascade of L convolutional hidden layers with pooling in-between, where the number of layers L should be at least two. In other words, each hidden layer performs 3D or 4D convolution followed by spatial window pooling, in order to reduce (decimate) feature maps by e.g., taking a product of the entries in sub-windows. The output layer is a linear dense layer.\nClassification can then be carried out in a standard way, through the maximization of a set of labeled score functions, hc for C classes, that is, the predicted label for the input instants X = (x1, . . . , xN) will be the index ŷ for which the score value attains a maximum, that is\nŷ = argmaxtcuhc(x1, . . . , xN). (4.21)\nSuch score functions can be represented through their coefficient tensors which, in turn, can be approximated by low-rank tensor network decompositions.\n185\nOne restriction of the so formulated score functions (4.15) is that they allow for a straightforward implementation of only a particular class of DCNNs, called convolutional Arithmetic Circuit (ConvAC). However, the score functions can be approximated indirectly and almost equivalently using more popular CNNs (see the next section). For example, it was shown recently how NNs with a univariate rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearity may perform multivariate function approximation [Poggio et al., 2016].\nAs discussed in Part 1 and in Chapter 1 the main idea is to employ a low-rank tensor network representation to approximate and interpolate a multivariate function hc(x1, . . . , xN) of N variables by a finite sum of separated products of simpler functions (i.e., via sparsely interconnected core tensors). Tensorial Mixture Model (TMM). Recently, the model in (4.15) has been extended to a corresponding probabilistic model, referred to as the Tensorial Mixture Model (TMM), given by Sharir et al. [2016]\nP(x1, x2, . . . , xN | y = c) (4.22)\n= I ÿ\ni1=1\n¨ ¨ ¨ I ÿ\niN=1\nPy=c(i1, . . . , iN) N ź\nn=1\nP(xn|in; θin),\nwhere P(y=c)(i1, . . . , iN) (corresponding to W c(i1, . . . , iN)) are jointly decomposed prior tensors and tP(xn|in; θin)u (corresponding to fθin (xn)) are mixing components (marginal likelihoods) shared across all input samples xn (n = 1, . . . , N) and classes tcu, (c = 1, 2, . . . , C). Note that for computational tractability, suitable scaling and nonnegativity constraints must be imposed on the TMM model.\nThe TMM can be considered as a generalization of standard mixture models widely used in machine learning, such as the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). However, unlike the standard mixture models, in the TMM we cannot perform inference directly from (4.23), nor can we even store the prior tensor, P(y=c)(i1, . . . , iN) P RIˆ¨¨¨ˆI , given its exponential size of IN entries. Therefore, the TMM presented by (4.23) is not tractable directly but only in a distributed form, whereby the coefficient tensor is approximated by low-rank tensor network decompositions with nonnegative cores. The TMM based on the HT decompositions is promising for multiple classification problems with partially missing training data, and potentially even regardless of the distribution of missing data [Sharir et al., 2016].\n186"

A more flexible and powerful HT model is shown in Figure 4.8, in which the constraints imposed on 3rd-order cores have been completely removed. In fact this is the standard HT tensor network, which can be mathematically\n189\nexpressed as (with a slight abuse of notation), as follows\nw(ď0,j)r = w (0,j) r\nW(ďl,j)r = R(l´1,2j´1) ÿ\nr1=1\nR(l´1,2j) ÿ\nr2=1\nw(l,j)r1,r2,r ¨ ( W(ďl´1,2j´1)r1 ˝W (ďl´1,2j) r2 ) (4.26)\nW c = W (ďL,1),\nfor l = 1, . . . , L and j = 1, . . . , 2L´l . The HT model can be further extended by using more flexible and general Tree Tensor Networks States (TTNS). As illustrated in Figure 4.9, the use of the TTNS, instead HT tensor networks, allows for more flexibility in the choice of the size of pooling-window, as the pooling size in each hidden layer can be adjusted by applying core tensors with a suitable variable order in each layer. For example, if we use 5th-order (4rd-order)\n190\ncore tensors instead 3rd-order cores, then the pooling layer will employ a size-4 pooling window (size-3 pooling) instead of only size-2 pooling window when using 3rd-order core tensors in HT tensor networks.

      "text" : "The convolutional arithmetic circuit (ConvACs) model employs the standard outer (tensor) products, which for two tensors, A P RI1ˆ¨¨¨ˆIN and B P RJ1ˆ¨¨¨ˆJM , are defined as\n(A ˝ B)i1,...,iN ,j1,...,jM = ai1,...,iN ¨ bj1,...,jM .\nIn order to convert ConvAC tensor models to widely used convolutional rectifier networks, we need to employ the generalized (nonlinear) outer products, defined as [Cohen and Shashua, 2016]\n(A ˝ρ B)i1,...,iN ,j1,...,jM = ρ(ai1,...,iN , bj1,...,jM), (4.27)\n191\nwhere the ρ operator can take various forms, e.g.,\nρ(a, b) = ρσ,P(a, b) = P[σ(a), σ(b)], (4.28)\nand is referred to as the activation-pooling function11, which meets the associativity and the commutativity requirements: ρ(ρ(a, b), c) = ρ(a, ρ(b, c)) and ρ(a, b) = ρ(b, a), @a, b, c P R). For two vectors, a P RJ and b P RJ , it is defined as a matrix C = a ˝ρ b P RIˆJ , with entries cij = ρ(ai, bj). Note that the nonlinear function ρ can also take special form: cij = maxtaibj, 0u or cij = maxtai, bj, 0u.\nFor a particular case of the convolutional rectifier network with max pooling, we can use the following activation-pooling operator\nρσ,P(a, b) = maxt[a]+, [b]+u = maxta, b, 0u. (4.29)\nIn an analogous way, we can define the generalized Kronecker and the Khatri-Rao products.\nExample 11 Consider a generalized CP decomposition, which corresponds to a shallow rectifier network in the form [Cohen and Shashua, 2016]\nW c = R ÿ\nr=1\nλ (c) r ¨ (w (1) r ˝ρ w (2) r ˝ρ ¨ ¨ ¨ ˝ρ w (N) r ), (4.30)\nwhere the coefficients λ(c)r represent weights of the output layer, vectors w(n)r P RIn are weights in the hidden layer and the operator ˝ρ denotes the nonlinear outer products defined above.\nThe generalized CP decomposition can be expressed in an equivalent vector form, as follows\nwc = vec(Wc) = [W (N) dρ W(N´1) dρ ¨ ¨ ¨ dρ W(1)]λ(c), (4.31)\nwhere dρ is the generalized Khatri-Rao product of two matrices. It should be noted that if we employ weight sharing, then all vectors w(n)r = wr, @n, and consequently the coefficient tensor, W c, must be a symmetric tensor which further limits the ability of this model to\n11The symbols σ(¨) and P(¨) are respectively the activation and pooling functions of the network.\n192\napproximate a desired function.\nExample 12 Consider the simplified HT model as shown Figure 4.7, but with the generalized outer product defined above. Such nonlinear tensor networks can be rigorously described for I1 = I2 = ¨ ¨ ¨ = IN = I, as follows\nw(ď0,j) r(0) = w(0,j) r(0)\nW(ďl,j) r(l)\n= R(l´1) ÿ\nr(l´1)=1\nw(l,j) r(l´1),r(l)\n¨ (\nW(ďl´1,2j´1) r(l´1) ˝ρ W (ďl´1,2j) r(l´1)\n) P RIˆ¨¨¨ˆI\nWc = W (ďL,1),\nfor l = 1, . . . , L and j = 1, . . . , 2L´l , or in an equivalent matrix form as\nW(ď0,j) = W(0,j) P RIˆR(0) W(ďl,j) = ( W(ďl´1,2j´1) dρ W(ďl´1,2j) ) W(l,j) P RI2 lˆR (l)\nvec(Wc) = ( W(ďL´1,1) dρ W(ďL´1,2) ) λ(c) P RIN ,\n(4.32)\nfor l = 1, . . . , L´ 1, where the core tensors are reduced to matrices W(l,j) P RR\n(l´1)ˆR(l) with entries w(l,j) r(l´1),r(l´1),r(l)\n. We should emphasize that the HT/TTNS architectures are not the only suitable TN architectures which can be used to model DCNNs, and the whole family of powerful tensor networks can be employed for this purpose. Particularly attractive and simple are the TT/MPS, TT/MPO and TC models for DNNs, for which efficient decomposition and tensor completion algorithms already exist. The TT/MPS, TT/MPO and TC networks provide not only simplicity in comparison to HT, but also very deep TN structures, that is, with N hidden layers. Note that the standard HT model generates architectures of DCNNs with L = log2(N) hidden layers, while TT/TC networks may employ N hidden layers. Taking into account the current trend in deep leaning to use a large number of hidden layers, it would be quite attractive to employ QTT tensor networks with a relatively large number of hidden layers, L = N ¨ log2(I).\nTo summarize, deep convolutional neural networks may be considered as a special case of hierarchical architectures, which can be indirectly simulated and optimized via relatively simple and well understood tensor networks, especially HT, TTNS, TT/MPS, TT/MPO, and TC (i.e., using\n193\nunbalanced or balanced binary trees and graphical models). However, more sophisticated tensor network diagrams with loops, discussed in the next section may provide potentially better performance and the ability to generate novel architectures of DCNNs."

      "heading" : "4.7 MERA and 2D TNs for a Next Generation of DCNNs",
      "text" : "The Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA) tensor network was first introduced by Vidal [2008], and for this network numerical algorithms to minimize some specific cost functions or local Hamiltonians used in quantum physics already exist [Evenbly and Vidal, 2009]. The MERA is a relatively new tensor network, widely investigated in quantum physics based on variational Ansatz, since it is capable of capturing many of the key complex physical properties of strongly correlated ground states [Evenbly and Vidal, 2015]. The MERA also shares many relationships with the AdS/CFT (gauge-gravity) correspondence, through its complete holographic duality with the tensor networks framework. Furthermore, the MERA can be regarded as a TN realization of an orthogonal wavelet transform [Evenbly and White, 2016a,b, Matsueda, 2016].\nFor simplicity, this section focuses on 1D binary and ternary MERA architectures (see Figure 4.10(a) for basic binary MERA). Instead of writing complex mathematical formulas, it is more convenient to describe MERA tensor networks graphically, as illustrated in Figures 4.10(a), (b) and (c). Using the terminology from quantum physics, the standard binary MERA architecture contains three classes of core tensors: (i) disentanglers – 4thorder cores; (ii) isometries, also called the coarse-grainers, which are typically 3rd-order cores for binary MERA and 4th-order cores for ternary MERA; and (iii) one output core which is usually a matrix or a 4th-order core. Each MERA layer is constructed of a row of disentanglers and a row of coarse-grainers or isometries. Disentanglers remove the short-scale entanglement between the adjacent modes, while isometries renormalise each pair of modes to a single mode. Each renormalisation layer performs these operations on a scale of different length.\nFrom the mapping perspective, the nodes (core tensors) can be considered as processing units, that is, the 4th-order cores map matrices to other matrices, while the coarse-grainers take matrices and map them to vectors. The key idea here is to realize that the “compression” capability\n194\n195\narises from the hierarchy and the entanglement. As a matter of fact, the MERA network embodies the mutual information chain rule.\nIn other words, the main idea underlying MERA is that of disentangling the system at scales of various lengths, following coarse graining Renormalization Group (RG) flow in the system. The MERA is particularly effective for (scale invariant) critical points of physical systems. The key properties of MERA can be summarized, as follows [Evenbly and Vidal, 2015]:\n• MERA can capture scale-invariance in input data;\n• It reproduces a polynomial decay of correlations between inputs, in contrast to HT or TT networks which reproduce only exponential decay of correlations;\n• MERA has the ability to compress tensor data much better than TT/HT tensor networks;\n• It reproduces a logarithmic correction to the area law, therefore MERA is more powerful tensor network than HT/TTNS or TT/TC networks;\n• MERA can be efficiently contracted due to unitary constraints imposed on core tensors.\nMotivated by these features, we are currently investigating MERA tensor networks as powerful tools to model and analyze DCNNs. The main objective is to establish a precise connection between MERA tensor networks and extended models of DCNNs. This connection may provide exciting new insights about deep learning while also allowing for the construction of improved families of DCNNs, with potential application to more efficient data/image classification, clustering and prediction. In other words, we conjecture that the MERA and 2D TNs (see Figure 4.11) will lead to useful new results, potentially allowing not only for better characterization of expressive power of DCNNs, but also for new practical implementations. Conversely, the links and relations between TNs and DCNNs could lead to useful advances in the design of novel deep neural networks.\nThe MERA tensor networks, shown in Figure 4.10, may provide a much higher expressive power of deep learning in comparison to networks corresponding to HT/TT architectures, since this class of tensor networks can model more complex long-term correlations between input\n196\ninstances. This follows from the facts that for HT and TT tensor networks correlations between input variables decay exponentially, and the entanglement entropy saturates to a constant, while the more sophisticated MERA tensor networks provide polynomially decaying correlations.\nWe firmly believe that the insights into the theory of tensor networks and quantum many-body physics can provide better theoretical understanding of deep learning, together with the guidance for optimized DNNs design.\nTo summarize, the tensor network methodology and architectures discussed briefly in this section may be extended to allow analytic construction of new DCNNs. Moreover, systematic investigation of the correspondences between DNNs and a wide spectrum of TNs can provide a very fruitful perspective including verification of the existing conjectures and claims about operational similarities and correspondences between DNNs and TNs into a more rigorous and constructive framework.\n197\nChapter 5\nDiscussion and Conclusions Machine learning and data mining algorithms are becoming increasingly important in the analysis of large volume, multi-relational and multi-modal datasets, which are often conveniently represented as multiway arrays or tensors. The aim of this monograph has therefore been to provide the ML and data analytics communities with both a state-of-the-art review and new directions in tensor decompositions and tensor network approaches for fundamental problems of large-scale optimization. Our focus has been on supervised and unsupervised learning with tensors, tensor regression, support tensor machines, tensor canonical coloration analysis, higher-order and kernel partial least squares, and deep learning.\nIn order to demystify the concepts of tensor algebra and to provide a seamless transition from the flat view linear algebra to multi-view multilinear algebra, we have employed novel graphical representations of tensor networks to interpret mathematical expressions directly and intuitively on graphs rather than through tedious multiple-index relationships. Our main focus has been on the Tucker, Tensor Train (TT) and Hierarchical Tucker (HT) decompositions and their extensions or generalizations. To make the material self-contained, we have also addressed the important concept of tensorization and distributed representation of structured lower-order data in tensor network formats, as a tool to provide efficient higher-order representation of vectors, matrices and low-order tensors and the optimization of cost (loss) functions.\nIn order to combat the curse of dimensionality and possibly obtain a linear or even sub-linear complexity of storage and computational complexities, we have next addressed distributed representation of tensor functions through low-rank tensor networks. Finally, we have demonstrated how such approximations can be used to solve a wide class of huge-scale linear/multilinear dimensionality reduction and related\n198\noptimization problems that are far from being tractable when using classical machine learning methods.\nThe lynchpin of this work are low-rank tensor network approximations and the associated tensor contraction algorithms, and we have elucidated how these can be used to convert otherwise intractable huge-scale optimization problems into a set of much smaller linked and/or distributed sub-problems of affordable sizes and complexity. In doing so, we have highlighted the ability of tensor networks to account for the couplings between the multiple variables, and for multimodal, incomplete and/or noisy data.\nThe Part 2 finishes with a discussion of the potential of tensor networks in the design of improved and optimized deep learning neural network architectures. It is our firm conviction that the links between tensor networks and deep learning provide both exciting new insights into multi-layer neural networks and a platform for the construction of improved families of DNNs, with potential applications in highly efficient data/image classifications, clustering and prediction.\n199\nAppendices"

Similar to the ALS method, at each iteration step, the AMEn algorithm updates a single core tensor (see Figure 3.11). Then, it concatenates the updated TT core X(n) with a core tensor Z(n) obtained from the residual vector. At each micro-iteration, only one core tensor of the solution is enriched by the core tensor computed based on the gradient vector. By concatenating two core tensors X(n) and Z(n), the AMEn can achieve global convergence, while maintaining the computational and storage complexities as low as those of the standard ALS [Dolgov and Khoromskij, 2015, Dolgov and Savostyanov, 2014].

    "abstractText" : "Part 2 of this monograph builds on the introduction to tensor networks and their operations presented in Part 1. It focuses on tensor network models for super-compressed higher-order representation of data/parameters and related cost functions, while providing an outline of their applications in machine learning and data analytics. A particular emphasis is on the tensor train (TT) and Hierarchical Tucker (HT) decompositions, and their physically meaningful interpretations which reflect the scalability of the tensor network approach. Through a graphical approach, we also elucidate how, by virtue of the underlying low-rank tensor approximations and sophisticated contractions of core tensors, tensor networks have the ability to perform distributed computations on otherwise prohibitively large volumes of data/parameters, thereby alleviating or even eliminating the curse of dimensionality. The usefulness of this concept is illustrated over a number of applied areas, including generalized regression and classification (support tensor machines, canonical correlation analysis, higher order partial least squares), generalized eigenvalue decomposition, Riemannian optimization, and in the optimization of deep neural networks. Part 1 and Part 2 of this work can be used either as stand-alone separate texts, or indeed as a conjoint comprehensive review of the exciting field of low-rank tensor networks and tensor decompositions.",
