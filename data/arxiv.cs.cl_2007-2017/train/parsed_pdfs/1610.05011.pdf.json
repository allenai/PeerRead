By repeatedly reading the representation of source sentence, which keeps fixed after generated by the encoder (Bahdanau et al., 2015), the attention mechanism has greatly enhanced state-of-the-art NMT. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism, called INTERACTIVE ATTENTION, which models the interaction between the decoder and the representation of source sentence during translation by both reading and writing operations. INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can keep track of the interaction history and therefore improve the translation performance. Experiments on NIST Chinese-English translation task show that INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can achieve significant improvements over both the previous attention-based NMT baseline and some state-of-the-art variants of attention-based NMT (i.e., coverage models (Tu et al., 2016)). And neural machine translator with our INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can outperform the open source attention-based NMT system Groundhog by 4.22 BLEU points and the open source phrase-based system Moses by 3.94 BLEU points averagely on multiple test sets."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has made promising progress in recent years (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a; Jean et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015b; Tang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Tu et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016), in which attention model plays an increasingly important role. Attention-based NMT represents the source sentence as a sequence of vectors after a RNN or bi-directional RNN (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997), and then simultaneously conducts dynamic alignment with a gating neural network and generation of the target sentence with another RNN. Usually NMT with attention model is more efficient than its attention-free counterpart: it can achieve comparable results with far less parameters and training instances (Jean et al., 2015). This superiority in efficiency comes mainly from the mechanism of dynamic alignment, which avoids the need to represent the entire source sentence with a fixed-length vector (Sutskever et al., 2014).\nHowever, conventional attention model is conducted on the representation of source sentence (fixed after generated) only with reading operation (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a). This may let the decoder tend to ignore past attention information, and lead to over-translation and undertranslation (Tu et al., 2016). To address this problem, Tu et al. (2016) proposed to maintain tag vec-\n∗The majority of this work was completed when the first author studied at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

Inspired by neural turing machines (Graves et al., 2014), we propose INTERACTIVE ATTENTION model from the perspective of memory reading-writing, which provides a conceptually simpler and practically more effective mechanism for attention-based NMT. The NMT with INTERACTIVE ATTENTION is called NMTIA, which can keep track of the interaction history with the representation of source sentence by both reading and writing operations during translation. This interactive mechanism may be helpful for the decoder to automatically distinguish which parts have been translated and which parts are under-translated.\nWe test the efficacy of NMTIA on NIST Chinese-English translation task. Experiment results show that NMTIA can significantly outperform both the conventional attention-based NMT baseline (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and coverage models (Tu et al., 2016). And neural machine translator with our INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can outperform the open source attention-based NMT system Groundhog by 4.22 BLEU points and the open source phrase-based system Moses by 3.94 BLEU points.\nRoadMap: In the remainder of this paper, we will start with a brief overview of attention-based neural machine translation in Section 2. Then in Section 3, we will detail the INTERACTIVE ATTENTIONbased NMT (NMTIA). In Section 4, we report our empirical study of NMTIA on a Chinese-English translation task, followed by Section 5 and 6 for related work and conclusion."

Therefore, we take an overview of the attention-based NMT in this section before detail the NMTIA in next section."

      "text" : "Figure 1 shows the framework of attention-based NMT. Formally, given an input source sequence x= {x1, x2, · · · , xN} and the previously generated target sequence y<t = {y1, y2, · · · , yt−1}, the probability of the next target word yt is\np(yt|y<t,x) = softmax(f(ct, yt−1, st)) (1)\nwhere f(·) is a non-linear function, and st is the state of decoder RNN at time step t which is calculated as\nst = g(st−1, yt−1, ct) (2)\nwhere g(·) can be any activation function, here we adopt a more sophisticated dynamic operator as in Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014). In the remainder of the paper, we will also use GRU to stand for the operator. And ct is a distinct source representation for time t, calculated as a weighted sum of the source annotations:\nct =\nN∑\nj=1\nat,jhj (3)\nFormally, hj = [ −→ hj T , ←− hj\nT ]T is the annotation of xj , which is computed by a bi-directional RNN (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997) with GRU and contains information about the whole input sequence with a strong focus on the parts surrounding xj . And its weight at,j is computed by\nat,j = exp(et,j)∑N k=1 exp(et,k)\n(4)\nwhere et,j = vTa tanh(Wast−1+Uahj) scores how well st−1 and hj match. This is called automatic alignment (Bahdanau et al., 2015) or attention model (Luong et al., 2015a), but it is essentially reading with content-based addressing defined in (Graves et al., 2014). With the attention model, it releases the need to summarize the entire sentence with a single fixed-length vector (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014). Instead, it lets the decoding network focus on one particular segment in source sentence at one moment, and therefore better resolution."

Intuitively, it should be beneficial to directly exploit the information of yt−1 when reading from the representation of source sentence, which is not implemented in the original attention-based NMT (Bahdanau et al., 2015). As illustrated in Figure 2, we add this implementation into the attention model, inspired by the latest implementation of attention-based NMT1. This kind of attention model can find a more effective alignment path by using both previous hidden state st−1 and the previous context word yt−1. Then, the calculation of e(t, j) becomes\net,j = v T a tanh(Was̃t−1 +Uahj) (5)\nwhere s̃t−1 = GRU(st−1, eyt−1) is an intermediate state tailored for reading from the representation of source sentence with the information of yt−1 (its word embedding being eyt−1) added.

      "text" : "In this section, we will elaborate on the proposed INTERACTIVE ATTENTION-based NMT, called NMTIA. Figure 3 shows the framework of NMTIA with two rounds of interactive read-write operations (indicated by the yellow and red arrows respectively), which adopts the same prediction model (Eq. 1) with improved attention-based NMT. With annotations H={h1,h2, . . . ,hN} of the source sentence x={x1, x2, · · · , xN}, we take H as a memory, which contains N cells with the jth cell being hj . As illustrated in Figure 3, INTERACTIVE ATTENTION in NMTIA contains two key parts at each time step t: 1) attentive reading from H, and 2) attentive writing to H. Since the content in H changes with time, we will add time stamp on H (hence H(t)) and its cells (hence h(t)j ).\nAt time t, the state st−1 first meets the prediction yt−1 to form an “intermediate” state s̃t−1, which can be calculated as follows\ns̃t−1 = GRU(st−1, eyt−1) (7)\nwhere eyt−1 is the word-embedding associated with the previous prediction word yt−1. This “intermediate” state s̃t−1 is used to read the source memory H(t−1)\nct = Read(s̃t−1,H (t−1)) (8)\nAfter that, s̃t−1 is combined with ct to update the new state\nst = GRU(s̃t−1, ct) (9)\nFinally, the new state st is used to update the source memory by writing to it to finish the interaction in a round of state-update\nH(t) = Write(st,H (t−1)) (10)\nThe details of Read and Write in Eq. 8 and 10 will be described later in next section. From the whole framework of NMTIA, we can see that the new attention mechanism can timely update the representation of source sentence along with the update-chain of the decoder RNN state. This may let the decoder keep track of the attention history during translation. Clearly, INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can subsume the coverage models in (Tu et al., 2016) as special cases while conceptually simpler. Moreover, with the attentive writing, INTERACTIVE ATTENTION potentially can modify and add more on the source representation than just history of attention, and is therefore a more powerful model for machine translation, as empirically verified in Section 4."

In this paper, we adopt the latter one.2\nAttentive Write Inspired by the writing operation of neural turing machines (Graves et al., 2014), we define two types of operation on writing to the memory: FORGET and UPDATE.

More specifically, the vector Ft ∈ Rm specifies the values to be forgotten or removed on each dimension in memory cells, which is then assigned to each cell through normalized weights wWt . Formally, the memory (“intermediate”) after FORGET operation is given by\nh̃ (t) i = h (t−1) i (1−w W t (i) · Ft), i = 1, 2, · · · , n (12)\nwhere\n• Ft = σ(WF , st) is parameterized with WF ∈ Rm×m, and σ stands for the Sigmoid activation function;\n• wWt ∈ R n specifies the normalized weights assigned to the cells in H(t), and wWt (i) specifies\nthe weight associated with the ith cell in the same parametric form as wRt .\nUPDATE is similar to the update gate in GRU, deciding how much current information should be written to the memory as the added content\nh (t) i = h̃ (t) i +w W t (i) ·Ut, i = 1, 2, · · · , n (13)\nwhere Ut = σ(WU , st) is parameterized with WU ∈ Rm×m, and Ut ∈ Rm.

We also use dropout for our baseline NMT systems and NMTIA to avoid over-fitting (Hinton et al., 2012). In our experiments, dropout was applied on the output layer with dropout rate setting to 0.5.\nInspired by the effort on easing the training of very deep architectures (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006), we use a simple pre-training strategy to train our NMTIA. First we train a regular attention-based NMT model (Bahdanau et al., 2015).

      "heading" : "4.5 INTERACTIVE ATTENTION Vs. Coverage Model",
      "text" : "Tu et al. (2016) proposed two coverage models to let the NMT system to consider more about untranslated source words. Basically, they maintain a coverage vector for each hidden state for source to keep track of the attention history and feed the coverage vector to the attention model to help adjust future attention. Although we do not maintain a coverage vector, our INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can potentially do similar things, therefore subsuming coverage models as special cases. We hence compare our INTERACTIVE ATTENTION model with the coverage model in (Tu et al., 2016). There are two coverage models proposed in (Tu et al., 2016), including linguistic coverage model and neural network based coverage model (NN-Cover). Since the neural network based coverage model generally yields better results, we mainly compare with the neural network based coverage model. Although the coverage models are originally implemented on Groundhog in (Tu et al., 2016), they can be easily adapted to the “RNNsearch⋆”. Following the setting in (Tu et al., 2016), we conduct the comparison with the training sentences of length up to 80 words. Clearly from Table 2, our NMTIA-80 outperforms the NN-Cover-80 by +1.04 BLEU scores averagely on four test sets.\nA more detailed comparison between conventional attention model (RNNsearch⋆-80), neural network based coverage model (NN-Cover-80) (Tu et al., 2016) and NMTIA-80 suggests that our NMTIA80 is quite consistent on outperforming the conventional attention model and the coverage model. Figure 4 shows the BLEU scores of generated translations on the test sets with respect to the length of the\nsource sentences. In particular, we test the BLEU scores on sentences longer than {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60} in the merged test set of MT03, MT04, MT05 and MT06. Clearly, on sentences with different length, NMTIA-80 always yields consistently higher BLEU scores than the conventional attentionbased NMT and the enhanced version with the neural network based coverage model. We conjecture that with the attentive writing (described in Section 3.1), INTERACTIVE ATTENTION potentially can modify and add more on the source representation than just history of attention, and is therefore a more powerful model for machine translation.\nWe also provide some actual translation examples (see Appendix) to show that our INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can get better performance then baselines, especially on solving under-translation problem. We think the interactive mechanism of NMTIA is helpful for the decoder to automatically distinguish which parts have been translated and which parts are under-translated."

      "heading" : "5 Related Work",
      "text" : "Our work is related to recent works that focus on improving attention models (Luong et al., 2015a; Cohn et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2016). Luong et al. (2015a) proposed to use global and local attention models to improve translation performance. They use a global one to attend to all source words and a local one to look at a subset of source words at a time. Cohn et al. (2016) extended the attentionbased NMT to include structural biases from word-based alignment models, which achieved improvements across several language pairs. Feng et al. (2016) added implicit distortion and fertility models to attention-based NMT to achieve translation improvements. These works are different with our INTERACTIVE ATTENTION approach, as we use a rather generic attentive reading while at the same time performing attentive writing.\nOur work is inspired by recent efforts on attaching an external memory to neural networks, such as neural turing machines (Graves et al., 2014), memory networks (Weston et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2015) and exploiting an external memory (Tang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) during translation. Tang et al. (2016) exploited a phrase memory for NMT, which stores phrase pairs in symbolic form. They let the decoder utilize a mixture of word-generating and phrase-generating component, to generate a sequence of multiple words all at once. Wang et al. (2016) extended the NMT decoder by maintaining an external memory, which is operated by reading and writing opera-\ntions of neural turing machines (Graves et al., 2014), while keeping a read-only copy of the original source annotations along side the “read-write” memory. These powerful extensions have been verified on Chinese-English translation tasks. Our INTERACTIVE ATTENTION is different from previous works. We take the annotations of source sentence as a memory instead of using an external memory, and we design a mechanism to directly read from and write to it during translation. Therefore, the original source annotations are not accessible in later steps. More specially, our model inherited the notation and some simple operations for writing from (Graves et al., 2014), while NMTIA extends it to “unbounded” memory for representing the source. In addition, although the read-write operations in INTERACTIVE ATTENTION are not exactly the same with those in (Graves et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016), our model can also achieve good performance."

By repeatedly reading the representation of source sentence, which keeps fixed after generated by the encoder (Bahdanau et al., 2015), the attention mechanism has greatly enhanced state-of-the-art NMT. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism, called INTERACTIVE ATTENTION, which models the interaction between the decoder and the representation of source sentence during translation by both reading and writing operations. INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can keep track of the interaction history and therefore improve the translation performance. Experiments on NIST Chinese-English translation task show that INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can achieve significant improvements over both the previous attention-based NMT baseline and some state-of-the-art variants of attention-based NMT (i.e., coverage models (Tu et al., 2016)). And neural machine translator with our INTERACTIVE ATTENTION can outperform the open source attention-based NMT system Groundhog by 4.22 BLEU points and the open source phrase-based system Moses by 3.94 BLEU points averagely on multiple test sets.",
