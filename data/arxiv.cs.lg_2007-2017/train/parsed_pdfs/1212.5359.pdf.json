      "text" : "The genes are responsible for regulating the growth of cells and keeping them healthy. Normally, each cell is divided into two with control of gene. From the two cells healthy new cell take over and old ones die out. Thus the expression of a gene provides a measure of activity of a gene under certain biochemical conditions. It is known that certain diseases, such as cancer, are reflected in the change of the expression values of certain genes. In a cancer cell, mutations can “turn on” and “turn off” others in a cell.\nGene expression represents the activation level of each gene within an organism at a particular point of time. The expression value provides activity of a gene under certain biochemical conditions (also represents Samples). A gene expression data set from a microarray experiment can be represented by a real-valued expression matrix M= as shown in Figure- 1 where the rows represent (G = expression patterns of genes, the columns (S = represent the expression profiles of samples, and each cell wij is the measured expression level of gene i in sample j [1]. Fig 2 represents the process flow of the gene clustering approach.\nThe clustering algorithms classify gene expression data into clusters and the functionally related genes are grouped together in an efficient manner. The groupings are constructed such that the degree of relationship is strong among members of the same cluster and weak among members of different clusters. There are several clustering algorithms constructed for clustering Gene expression data such as K-means, K-medoid clustering, CLARAN’S, Fuzzy C -means, Rough Kmeans and so on. In this paper, Comparative analysis of the proposed work is made with two bench mark algorithms like K-Means and Rough K-Means which is explained in section ————————————————  K .Dhanalakshmi M.phil Scholar , Dept. of Compuert Science, Periyar University,Tamil Nadu, India, E-mail:dhanalakshmi.src.cs@mail.com  H.

Most of the definitions presented in this section may be found in [10][13][14].

Let U be an initial universe set and E be a set of parameters.\nLet P(U) denote the power set of U and A pair (F, A) is called a soft set over U, where F is a mapping given by F: A→ P (U). In other words, a soft set over U is a parameterized family of subsets of the universe U. For ɛ Є A, F (ɛ) may be considered as the set of ɛ approximate elements of the soft set (F, A). Definition 2. For two soft set (F, A) and (G, B) over a common universe U, we say that (F, A) is a soft sub set of (G, B) if\n(i). B, and\n(ii). are identical approximations. We write .

Gene expression dataset may contain\nuncertain expression values. The soft set theory is a new mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainties, which traditional mathematical tools cannot handle [2]. Previous clustering algorithms so far have not used any soft set concepts and it’s only applied for feature selection and classification based decision making problem. In our proposed work, we applied the Fuzzy Soft set concept for gene clustering problem. The analytical goal is to find clusters of Genes which are more similar to each other than they are to observations in different clusters.\nThis research area focuses on to improve the performance of gene clustering approach. To analyse which clustering algorithm gives better results among various gene expression cancer data sets, comparative analysis is made with the Kmeans and Rough K-means algorithms. It gives an opportunity to examine individual genes, for further medical treatments and drug discovery."

      "text" : "Pre-processing of gene expression data is an essential process. Various approaches for gene filtering and different types of gene clustering methods are discussed in [3]. Data clustering analysis has been extensively applied to extract information from gene expression profiles obtained with DNA microarrays [4]. Cluster analysis technique is used to identify sets of genes that are coordinately regulated. Many clustering techniques have been applied for gene expression data. For example, Limin Fu and Enzo Medico introduced a novel fuzzy clustering method for the analysis of DNA microarray data [5]. Jie Zhang, et al., have identified a set of genes that are potential biomarkers for breast cancer prognosis which can categorize the patients into two groups with distinct prognosis [6]. The authors Daxin Jiang Chun Tang Aidong Zhang, gives extensive survey for cluster analysis for gene Expression data [3].\nThe author S. Belciug et al. applied K-Means, SOM, and the cluster network algorithm to detect breast cancer recurrent events. The result clearly shows that the best performance was obtained by the cluster network, followed by SOM and K-Means [7]. The Author Georg Perers first introduced the Rough K-means clustering algorithm, which is applied for web mining [8].\nParvesh kumar, Siri Krishan Wasan applied both K-means and Rough K-means algorithms for Cancer data sets [9]. In this paper we have applied fuzzy soft set based similarity approach, which is taken from generalized fuzzy soft set as introduced by Pinaki Majumdar et al. [10]. Soft Set Theory was first proposed by D. Molodtsov in 1999 for dealing with uncertainties [11]. The soft sets theory can work well on the parameters that have a binary number but difficult to work with real number. To overcome this problem, Maji et al. have introduced general concepts for soft set theory, namely the fuzzy soft set, which can be used with real numbers [12], [13]. Bana Handaga and Mustafa Mat Deris used the similarity Approach on Fuzzy Soft Set based Numerical Data Classification [14]. Pinaki Majumdar et al. defined a concept generalized fuzzy soft set and several similarity measures of fuzzy soft set [15]. In This work we applied Fuzzy Soft similarity concepts in Rough K-means algorithm [16], [8] it works well\non soft set theory based classification problems, but in our proposed work we use fuzzy soft sets for clustering problem."

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nTo evaluate the performance of the various Clustering al-\ngorithms described in this paper such as Fuzzy Soft Rough Kmeans, Rough K-means, K-means algorithm.

For experimentation, we used a set of gene expression data that contains a serious of gene expression measurement of the transcript (mRNA) level of gene. In clustering gene expression data, the genes were treated as objects and the samples are treated as attributes. The cluster validity measures such as Xie-Beni index and DB-index are used as validation measures [18] [19]."

    "abstractText" : "Clustering is one of the widely used data mining techniques for medical diagnosis. Clustering can be considered as the most important unsupervised learning technique. Most of the clustering methods group data based on distance and few methods cluster data based on similarity. The clustering algorithms classify gene expression data into clusters and the functionally related genes are grouped together in an efficient manner. The groupings are constructed such that the degree of relationship is strong among members of the same cluster and weak among members of different clusters. In this work, we focus on a similarity relationship among genes with similar expression patterns so that a consequential and simple analytical decision can be made from the proposed Fuzzy Soft Rough K-Means algorithm. The algorithm is developed based on Fuzzy Soft sets and Rough sets. Comparative analysis of the proposed work is made with bench mark algorithms like K-Means and Rough K-Means and efficiency of the proposed algorithm is illustrated in this work by using various cluster validity measures such as DB index and Xie-Beni index.",
