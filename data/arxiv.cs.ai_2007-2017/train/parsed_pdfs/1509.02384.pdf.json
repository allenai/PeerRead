Hence, it is safe to say that\nScheduling is one of the most important subjects in the fields of Operations Research and\nManagement Science.\nA particular branch of the scheduling theory arises in the context of Just-In-Time (JIT)\nmanufacturing systems. Problems of this branch of scheduling are generally referred to\nas earliness-tardiness (E-T) scheduling problems, where penalties are incurred if a job is\ncompleted before or after its due date. Moreover, they often include several additional\nfeatures commonly found in the scheduling literature such as multiple machines (identical,\nuniform, unrelated), release dates, sequence-dependent setup times, among others.\nWeighted E-T problems are usually NP-hard, since they include the single machine\ntotal weighted tardiness scheduling problem (1|| ∑\nwjTj) as a particular case, which is\nknown to be NP-hard (Lawler, 1977; Lenstra et al., 1977). Therefore, solving this type\nof problems to optimality is an extremely hard task. Nevertheless, there has been a\ncontinuous effort towards the development of efficient exact algorithms for this type\nof problems (Sourd and Kedad-Sidhoum, 2003; Sourd, 2005; Sourd and Kedad-Sidhoum,\n2008; Tanaka and Fujikuma, 2008; Sourd, 2009; Tanaka et al., 2009; Pessoa et al., 2010;\nTanaka and Fujikuma, 2012; Tanaka, 2012). In some particular situations, often involving\na single machine environment without sequence-dependent setup times, they seem to be\nvery effective, even solving instances with up to 300 jobs (Tanaka et al., 2009; Tanaka,\n2012), but in most cases their application are still limited to small/medium-size instances.\nHeuristic algorithms are thus the natural alternative for trying to generate high quality\nfeasible solutions within an acceptable computational time.\nThe large majority of heuristic algorithms proposed for scheduling problems were\ndevised for a particular variant. While there are unified methods for polynomial\nproblems (Leyvand et al., 2010) as well as polynomial time approximation schemes\n(Kumar et al., 2009; Epstein et al., 2013) and exact approaches (Chen and Powell, 1999;\nTanaka and Fujikuma, 2008, 2012; Lin, 2013) for classes of NP-hard problems, we are\nnot aware of general heuristics developed for similar purposes, as opposed, for example,\nto the field of vehicle routing, where there has been a trend in the development of efficient\nunified heuristics (Cordeau et al., 2001; Røpke and Pisinger, 2006; Pisinger and Røpke,\n2007; Cordeau and Maischberger, 2012; Subramanian et al., 2013; Vidal et al., 2013, 2014;\nDerigs and Vogel, 2014).\nVehicle routing and single/parallel-machine scheduling problems have some similarities\nin the sense that in both problems one should determine the order in which the tasks\n(deliver goods to customers, processing a job in a machine, etc.) must be performed.\nHowever, there is a clear distinction between these two problems, especially when it comes\nto the objective function. In classical vehicle routing problems the objective is frequently\nto minimize the sum of the travel costs, whereas in scheduling problems the variety of\nobjectives is more notable, ranging from minimizing the makespan or the total weighted\ncompletion time to minimizing the total weighted (earliness-)tardiness and so on. These\ndifferences on the objective functions have a direct influence, for instance, on the local\nsearch performance of a heuristic. In standard vehicle routing problems, a move can be\noften computed in constant time, while in scheduling problems more complex and specific\nprocedures are generally required for evaluating the cost of a move. Moreover, while some\naspects such as idle (waiting) times do not usually (directly) affect the objective function\nvalue in, for example, feasible solutions of vehicle routing problems with time windows,\nthey may cause a considerable impact on the solution cost of E-T scheduling problems.\nThese are just few examples of many of the issues that arise in scheduling problems that\nare generally relatively easier to handle in vehicle routing algorithms.\nIn addition, a heuristic that works well for scheduling problems without idle time\nmay end up having a poor performance when applied to a variant in which idle time is\nallowed, mainly because in the latter one should solve a subproblem known as timing\nproblem (Vidal et al., 2015b) that consists of determining the optimal start times of the\njobs given a sequence. In fact, parts of a heuristic algorithm that were not designed to\nallow idle time should be substantially redesigned to address this point. Note that the\nopposite can also happen, that is, a heuristic designed to handle idle time may turn out\nto have a slow performance when considering instances without idle time.\nIn summary, it seems more challenging to devise a unified heuristic for standard\nscheduling problems than for vehicle routing problems, which may explain the lack of this\nkind of algorithms in the scheduling literature. Furthermore, we strongly believe that\nunified methods are extremely important in practice. For example, commercial packages\nmust be designed to be both robust and general enough to efficiently deal with many\nreal-life problems. Also, these type of methods can be a good source of reference if one\nintends to evaluate the performance of specially-tailored algorithms for some particular\nvariants.\nThis work attempts to start filling the aforementioned gap by proposing a unified\nheuristic algorithm for single/parallel-machine scheduling problems. By “unified” we\nmean that several specific ingredients are put together into a single framework that is\ncapable of efficiently solving a large class of distinct scheduling problems. However, due\nto the countless number of variants existing in the literature, we decided to focus our\nattention on a subset of them, in particular, E-T problems without preemption. We\nconsider a class of problems that may or may not consider earliness penalties, sequence-\ndependent setup times, release dates, due dates and idle time, resulting in a broad range\nof variants that include other type of objectives such as minimizing the total weighted\ntardiness; total (average) weighted completion time; and total (average) weighted flow\ntime.\nThe developed heuristic algorithm extends the one of Subramanian (2012);\nSubramanian et al. (2013) that was successfully applied to solve a class of vehicle rout-\ning problems. The conceptual idea of the proposed method is quite simple, however,\nin contrast to the original algorithm, some specific parts rely on sophisticated proce-\ndures (Ibaraki et al., 2005, 2008; Ergun and Orlin, 2006; Liao et al., 2012) for efficiently\nperforming local search according to the characteristics of the problem. One particular\ncontribution of this work is the development of efficient move evaluation approaches for\na class of parallel machine problems. Such approaches generalize the ideas presented in\nErgun and Orlin (2006) and Liao et al. (2012) for single machine total weighted tardiness\nproblems. The algorithm was tested in benchmark instances of several E-T problems.\nThe results obtained show that our unified heuristic is capable of producing high quality\nsolutions when compared to the best ones available in the literature that were obtained\nby specific methods.\nWe also provide an extensive annotated bibliography on the problems related to those\nconsidered in this work, where we not only indicate the approach(es) used in each publica-\ntion, but we also point out the characteristics of the problem(s) considered. In addition,\nwe classify the heuristic and exact methods in different categories so as to have a better\nidea of the popularity of each type of solution procedure.\nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section 3 presents an annotated\nbibliography on E-T works related to the class of problems considered in this research.\nSection 2 specifies the range of problems solve by our unified heuristic whose detailed\ndescription can be found in Section 4. Computational experiments are reported in Section\n5. Finally, Section 6 contains the concluding remarks.\n2 Problems considered\nIn this section we enumerate the class of E-T problems, including some particular cases,\nthat our unified heuristic is capable of solving. We start by characterizing the general\nproblem followed by a list of particular cases.\nLet J = {1, . . . , n} be a set of jobs to be scheduled on a set of unrelated parallel\nmachines given by M = {1, . . . , m}. For each job j ∈ J , let pkj , dj , rj , w ′ j and wj be\nits processing time in machine k ∈ M , due date, release date, earliness penalty weight\nand tardiness penalty weight, respectively. Also, let skij be the setup time required before\nstarting to process job j ∈ J if j is scheduled immediately after job i ∈ J in machine\nk ∈ M . The objective is to minimize ∑ w′jEj + wjTj , where Ej = max{dj − Cj, 0}\nand Tj = max{Cj − dj, 0} are the earliness and tardiness of a job j ∈ J , respectively,\nthat depends on its completion time Cj . Idle time is allowed to be inserted between\ntwo consecutive jobs. According to the notation suggested by Graham et al. (1979), this\nproblem can be referred to as R|rj, s k ij|\n∑\nw′jEj + wjTj .\nA large number of problems arise as a special case of the problem described above,\nincluding well-known single machine problems without sequence-dependent setup times\nsuch as 1|| ∑ wjTj, 1|rj| ∑ wjTj , 1|| ∑ w′jEj + wjTj , 1|rj| ∑ w′jEj + wjTj , 1|rj| ∑ wjCj\nthat can be efficiently solved by the exact algorithm of Tanaka and Fujikuma (2012) for\ninstances with up to 200 jobs (sometimes even 300 jobs as in the case of 1|| ∑\nwjTj). Note\nthat the latter problem, which consists of minimizing the average weighted completion\ntime, is a particular case of problem 1|rj| ∑ wjTj when all due dates are admitted to\nbe zero, i.e., Tj = max{Cj − 0, 0} = Cj , ∀j ∈ J . Although the proposed heuristic is\ncapable of dealing with these problems, its performance is simply not as good as some\nexact algorithms such as the one of Tanaka and Fujikuma (2012). In fact, it is really hard\nto devise heuristic algorithms with a superior or at least equivalent performance than the\nexact ones for these problems, even for large size instances. Our heuristic still finds high\nquality solutions for most of the existing instances, but not as fast as the state-of-the-art\nexact methods. For brevity, we decided not to report computational results for these\nproblems.\nAnother type of objective function that arise as particular case of ∑\nwjTj is when one\naims at minimizing the average weighted flow time, which is given by ∑ wjFj = ∑ wj(Cj−\nrj). Note that by setting dj = rj, ∀j ∈ J , we obtain Tj = max{Cj − rj , 0} = Fj , ∀j ∈ J .\nTable 1 lists some of the main problems that appear as special case of problem\nR|rj, skij| ∑ w′jEj+wjTj and where our heuristic can be applied, including those mentioned\nabove for the sake of completeness. Problems like 1||wjCj do not appear in the table be-\ncause we only considered NP-hard problems. We also do not explicitly include problems\nwith unitary weights because they are simply particular cases of the weighted problems.\nFor example, problem 1|sij| ∑ Tj is well studied in the literature, but in principle any algorithm developed for problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj can be used to solve the former one. In fact, some recent works on problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj (Kirlik and Oğuz, 2012; Tanaka and Araki,\nSingle machine Identical machines Uniform machines Unrelated machines\n1|| ∑ wjTj P || ∑ wjTj Q|| ∑ wjTj R|| ∑ wjTj 1|rj | ∑ wjTj P |rj | ∑ wjTj Q|rj | ∑ wjTj R|rj | ∑ wjTj 1|sij | ∑ wjTj P |sij | ∑ wjTj Q|s k ij | ∑ wjTj R|s k ij | ∑ wjTj 1|rj , sij | ∑ wjTj P |rj , sij | ∑ wjTj Q|rj , s k ij | ∑ wjTj R|rj , s k ij | ∑ wjTj 1|| ∑ w′jEj + wjTj P || ∑ w′jEj + wjTj Q|| ∑ w′jEj + wjTj R|| ∑ w′jEj + wjTj 1|rj | ∑ w′jEj + wjTj P |rj | ∑ w′jEj + wjTj Q|rj | ∑ w′jEj +wjTj R|rj | ∑ w′jEj + wjTj 1|sij | ∑ w′jEj + wjTj P |sij | ∑ w′jEj + wjTj Q|s k ij | ∑ w′jEj + wjTj R|s k ij | ∑ w′jEj +wjTj 1|rj , sij | ∑ w′jEj + wjTj P |rj , sij | ∑ w′jEj +wjTj Q|rj , s k ij | ∑ w′jEj + wjTj R|rj , s k ij | ∑ w′jEj + wjTj 1|rj | ∑ wjCj P || ∑ wjCj Q|| ∑ wjCj R|| ∑ wjCj 1|sij | ∑ wjCj P |rj | ∑ wjCj Q|rj | ∑ wjCj R|rj | ∑ wjCj 1|rj , sij | ∑ wjCj P |sij | ∑ wjCj Q|s k ij | ∑ wjCj R|s k ij | ∑ wjCj 1|rj | ∑ wjFj P |rj , sij | ∑ wjCj Q|rj , s k ij | ∑ wjCj R|rj , s k ij | ∑ wjCj 1|rj , sij | ∑ wjFj P |rj | ∑ wjFj Q|rj | ∑ wjFj R|rj | ∑ wjFj\nP |rj , sij | ∑ wjFj Q|rj , s k ij | ∑ wjFj R|rj , s k ij | ∑ wjFj\nWe did not perform computational experiments for all problems, not only for the\nreasons mentioned above, but also due to lack of publicly available instances. In addition,\nfor some particular problems in which there are available instances, the authors who\nproposed them did not report lower/upper bounds.\n3 An annotated bibliography for E-T problems related to those\nconsidered in this work\nThere is a vast literature on (E-)T scheduling. The first publications started to appear in\nthe 1980s and they were surveyed by Baker and Scudder (1990). Another survey was later\nperformed by Lauff and Werner (2004) for E-T problems in a multi-machine environment.\nRecently, Ratli et al.

Tables 3, 4\nand 5 summarize these works according to the environment, namely identical, uniform\nand unrelated parallel machine.\nThe heuristic approaches proposed for parallel machine problems can be classified as\nfollows:\n• Constructive and/or improvement heuristics (Lee and Pinedo, 1997;\nBank and Werner, 2001; Weng et al., 2001; Sun and Wang, 2003; Feng and Lau,\n2008; Biskup et al., 2008; Kedad-Sidhoum et al., 2008; Pfund et al., 2008;\nMason et al., 2009; Xi et al., 2015).\n• Population based metaheuristics:\n– GA (Sivrikaya-Şerifoğlu and Ulusoy, 1999; Vallada and Ruiz, 2012;\nAmorim et al., 2013; Amorim, 2013; Schaller, 2014).\n– EA (Yousefi and Yusuff, 2013; Lin and Hsieh, 2014).\n– ACO (Zhou et al., 2007).\n• Local search based metaheuristics:\n– SA (Guinet, 1995; Lee and Pinedo, 1997; Koulamas, 1997;\nRadhakrishnan and Ventura, 2000; Bank and Werner, 2001).\n– TS (Eom et al., 2002; Bilge et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2006; Logendran et al., 2007;\nLee et al., 2013; Schaller, 2014).\n– ILS (Rodrigues et al., 2008; Amorim, 2013).\n– GRASP (Armentano and de França Filho, 2007).\n– Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) (Rios-Solis and Sourd, 2008).\n• Hybrid metaheuristics (Anghinolfi and Paolucci, 2007; Della Croce et al., 2012;\nM’Hallah and Al-Khamis, 2012; Nogueira et al., 2014).\n• Artificial Intelligence based heuristics (Akyol and Bayhan, 2008; Raja et al., 2008;\nPolyakovskiy and M’Hallah, 2014; Li et al., 2014).\n• Mathematical Programming based heuristics (Kedad-Sidhoum et al., 2008;\nŞen and Bülbül, 2015).\nThe exact methods developed for parallel machine problems can be classified as follows:\n• B&B based on domination rules (Azizoglu and Kirca, 1998, 1999; Yalaoui and Chu,\n2002; Liaw et al., 2003; Yalaoui and Chu, 2006; Shim and Kim, 2007a,b;\nJouglet and Savourey, 2011; Nessah et al., 2008; Schaller, 2014).\n• B&B + LR (Belouadah and Potts, 1994; Tanaka and Araki, 2008).\n• B&B over linear programming (LP) relaxations based on CG and/or cutting planes\n(Chen and Powell, 1999; Pessoa et al., 2010).\n• Compact MIP formulations (Balakrishnan et al., 1999; Zhu and Heady, 2000;\nOmar and Teo, 2006; Vallada and Ruiz, 2012; Lin, 2013).\n• Preemption based relaxation (Bülbül and Şen, 2016).\n4 The unified heuristic algorithm\nThe proposed unified heuristic, called UILS, is mostly based on ILS (Lourenço et al.,\n2002). This metaheuristic basically alternates between intensification (local search) and\ndiversification (perturbation) procedures in order to escape from local optima. We modi-\nfied the original ILS algorithm by allowing multiple restarts of the method. Previous works\nshowed that this type of implementation, along with a Randomized Variable Neighbor-\nhood Descent (RVND) approach in the local search phase, yielded high quality results\nfor different kinds of problems (Subramanian et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2012; Penna et al.,\n2013; Subramanian and Battarra, 2013; Martinelli et al., 2013; Subramanian et al., 2014;\nVidal et al., 2015a; Subramanian and Farias, 2015), most of them in the field of routing,\nincluding the unified algorithms presented in Subramanian (2012); Subramanian et al.\n(2013).\nGiven the previous successful implementations of the multi-start ILS-RVND algorithm,\nwe decided to extend this method to E-T scheduling problems. However, as pointed out\nin Section 1, several issues arise when dealing with scheduling problems that usually do\nnot appear in vehicle routing problems. The main adaptation was in the local search\nphase where we implemented a tailored move evaluation approach according to the char-\nacteristics of the problem, such as the existence or not of earliness penalties, idle time,\nrelease dates and sequence-dependent setup times. This is one of the key aspects for the\nversatility and potential scalability of the proposed heuristic when facing problems with\ndistinct features.\nThe multi-start heuristic starts by generating an initial solution using a very simple\ngreedy randomized or a completely randomized insertion procedure. Next, a local search\nis performed using RVND, but with a specific move evaluation scheme that depends on the\ncharacteristics of the problem. On the one hand, when idles times are not considered, the\nchoice of the move evaluation scheme to be used depends on the existence of setup times.\nOn the other hand, when idle times are taken into account, the decision on the move\nevaluation scheme to be used depends on the presence of earliness penalties. Note that\nin this latter case, the existence of setup times does not affect such decision. Moreover, if\nthe maximum number of consecutive perturbations without improvements (IILS) is not\nachieved (ILS stopping criterion), then the algorithm modifies the incumbent solution\nof the current multi-start iteration by applying a perturbation mechanism and then it\nrestarts the local search procedure from that perturbed solution. Otherwise, the algorithm\nrestarts from the beginning. If the maximum number of restarts (IR) is achieved then the\nheuristic stops and returns the best solution found.\n4.1 Initial Solutions\nFor problems involving multiple machines, the initial solutions are generated at random,\nwhereas for single machine problems without release date the solutions are built either at\nrandom or following the earliest due date (EDD) method. When release dates are con-\nsidered, the initial solutions are generated using the earliest release date (ERD) criterion.\nFor the sake of diversification, EDD and ERD were implemented based on the greedy\nrandomized approach of the constructive phase of GRASP (Feo and Resende, 1995).\nIt is worth mentioning that, based on preliminary experiments, the use of more so-\nphisticated methods for building initial solutions do not significantly affect, on average,\nneither the quality of the final solution, nor the speed of convergence towards a local\noptimum. Hence, for simplicity, we decided to keep the constructive procedure as simple\nas possible.\n4.2 Local Search\nThe local search is performed by a RVND procedure (Mladenović and Hansen, 1997;\nSubramanian, 2012), which consists of randomly choosing an unexplored neighborhood\nto proceed with the search every time another one fails to find an improved solution.\nOtherwise, all neighborhoods are allowed to be selected.\nIn what follows, we describe the neighborhood structures used in RVND, as well as\nthe move evaluation procedures which can vary depending on the characteristics of the\nproblem.\n4.2.1 Neighborhood structures\nWith a view of better illustrating the neighborhood structures used in our algorithm\nwe resort to a block representation, which is commonly adopted in the scheduling lit-\nerature. Let πk = (πk(0), πk(1), . . . , πk(nk)) be a sequence of nk + 1 jobs associated\nwith a machine k ∈ M , with πk(0) = 0 as a dummy job that is necessary for consid-\nering an eventual setup sk0πk(1) for processing the initial job of the sequence. A block B consists of subsequence of consecutive jobs. An example involving 10 jobs divided\ninto three blocks (B1 = (πk(0), πk(1), πk(2), πk(3), πk(4)), B2 = (πk(5), πk(6), πk(7)),\nB3 = (πk(8), πk(9), πk(10))) is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe neighborhoods used in RVND are based on insertion and swap moves involving\nsubsequences of jobs (blocks) and they are described next.\n• l-block insertion intra-machine — consists of moving (reinserting) a block of size l,\nstarting from job πk(i), to the position after job πk(j) in the same machine. A block\n(B2) is moved forward (after B3) when i = 1, . . . , nk− l and j = i+ l, . . . , nk, if i < j;\nand moved backward (B3 before B2) when i = 2, . . . , nk+1− l and j = 0, . . . , nk − l,\nif i > j, as depicted in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.\n• (l, l′)-block swap intra-machine — consists of interchanging a block (B2) of size l,\nstarting from job πk(i), with another one belonging to the same machine (B4) of size\nl′, starting from job πk(j), as shown in Fig. 5.\n• l-block insertion inter-machine — consists of removing a block (B2) of size l from\na machine k, starting from πk(i), and inserting it in machine k ′ at position j, after\nblock B4, as illustrated in Fig. 6.\n• (l, l′)-block swap inter-machine — consists of interchanging a block (B2) of size l of\na machine k, starting from job πk(i), with a block (B5) of size l ′ of a machine k′ that\nstarts from job πk′(j), as presented in Fig. 7.\nThe size(s) of the block(s) in each type of neighborhood is an input parameter. Let\nLintra, Linter, L ′ intra and L ′ inter be the set of possible block sizes for the neighborhoods l-block insert intra-machine, l-block insert inter-machine, (l, l′)-block swap intra-machine\nand (l, l′)-block swap inter-machine, respectively. For example, if Lintra = {1, 2, . . . , 7},\nwe assume that there are 7 neighborhoods of the type l-block insert intra-machine to\nbe considered in the RVND procedure, each with a distinct value for l. Similarly, if\nL′inter = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}, then the RVND procedure will consider 6 neighborhoods of the type (l, l′)-block swap inter-machine, each of them with a different\nsetting for (l, l′).\nThe size of each individual neighborhood of any of the four types mentioned above\nis O(n2). For problems without idle time, a straightforward move evaluation can be\nperformed in O(n) (Subramanian and Farias, 2015), leading to an overall complexity of\nO(n3) for enumerating and examining all possible moves from that neighborhood. How-\never, when there are no sequence-dependent setup times, the move evaluation can be\nperformed in amortized O(1) time by extending the ideas presented in Ergun and Orlin\n(2006), yielding an overall complexity of O(n2). Otherwise, it is known that the move\nevaluation can still be performed in amortized O(1) time, but with an overall complexity\nof O(n2logn), by extending the approach proposed in Liao et al. (2012). Nevertheless, it\nappears that this approach is only worth to be implemented in practice for large sized\ninstances/sequences.\nFor problems with idle time, one should solve the timing problem, i.e., determine\nthe optimal start of the jobs associated with the solution under evaluation, which is\nusually solved by dynamic programming (Ibaraki et al., 2005), and the resulting overall\ncomplexity if often greater than the case without idle time. However, when earliness\npenalties are not considered and the need for idle time is due to the existence of release\ndates, the timing problem becomes trivial and one should only ensure that the job does\nnot start before its release date. This can be done in O(n) time and therefore the overall\ncomplexity in this case is O(n3).\nThe next four sections present different ways of performing the move evaluation ac-\ncording to the characteristics of the problem.\n4.2.2 Straightforward move evaluation for problems without idle time\nDefine a and b as the position associated with the first and last jobs of u-th block Bu in\nthe sequence, respectively, and define b′ as the position associated with the last job of\nthe preceding block Bu−1 in the sequence. Let C b ′ be the completion time of the job in\nposition b′. Alg. 1 shows how to compute the cost of block Bu in O(|Bu|) steps.\nThe cost of a neighbor solution can be computed by simply summing up the cost of\neach block involved in the move. For example, when evaluating the cost of a move related\nto the (l, l′)-block swap intra-machine neighborhood, one can directly sum the costs of\nthe blocks B1, B4, B3, B2, and B5 (see Fig. 5) in this particular order. Note that the\ncost of a block depends on the completion time of the last job of the previous sequence,\nas illustrated in Alg. 1. In the worst case, the affected blocks may together contain all\njobs of the instance, which imply in O(n) operations for computing the cost.\nIn order to speed up the process of computing the cost one can keep track of the\nAlgorithm 1 CompCostBlock\n1: procedure CompCostBlock(b′ , a, b, πk, C b ′) 2: cost ← 0 3: Ctemp ← C b′ + sk\nπk(b ′),πk(a) + pk πk(a)\n⊲ Global variable that stores a temporary completion time\n4: if Ctemp > dπk(a) then 5: cost ← wπk(a) × ( Ctemp − dπk(a) ) 6: else 7: cost ← w′\nπk(a) ×\n( dπk(a) − Ctemp )\n8: for a′ = a+ 1 . . . b do 9: Ctemp ← Ctemp + sk\nπk(a ′ −1),πk(a\n′) + pk\nπk(a ′)\n10: if Ctemp > dπk(a′) then 11: cost ← cost+wπk(a′) × ( Ctemp − dπk(a′) ) 12: else 13: cost ← cost+w′\nπk(a ′) ×\n( dπk(a′) − Ctemp )\n14: return cost\ncumulated cost up to a particular position of the sequence. Hence, define W kj as a data\nstructure that stores the cumulated cost up to the position j of a sequence πk, more\nprecisely:\nW kj =\nj ∑\ni=1\ncki , j = 1, . . . nk\nwhere:\ncki =\n{\nw′πk(i)(dπk(i) − Cπk(i)), if Cπk(i) ≤ dπk(i) wπk(i)(Cπk(i) − dπk(i)), if Cπk(i) ≥ dπk(i) (1)\nFor example, the cost of block B1 = (πk(0), . . . , πk(5)) can be accessed in O(1) time\nby directly verifying the value of W k5 .\nWe remark that the straightforward way of computing the cost of a move described\nin this section is not new and we refer to Subramanian and Farias (2015) for a detailed\ndescription of the move evaluation using this type of approach. It is worthy of note that\nthe same authors developed a local search limitation strategy, based on the setup variation\ndue to a move, for problem 1|sij| ∑ wjTj that turned out to be very efficient in practice.\nThey implemented a filtering mechanism that avoids unpromising moves to be evaluated.\nWe believe that this idea can be extended for problems involving multiple machines and\nsequence-dependent setup times.\n4.2.3 Move evaluation for problems without both idle time and sequence-dependent setup\ntimes\nErgun and Orlin (2006) presented ways of evaluating the moves of the neighborhoods 1-\nblock insertion intra-machine, 1-block swap intra-machine and block reverse (a.k.a. twist)\nin amortized O(1) time for problem 1|| ∑\nwjTj . In this work we extend their approaches\nfor the neighborhoods described in Section 4.2.1 to solve problem R|| ∑ w′jEj+wjTj (with-\nout idle time) and its particular cases, that is, all problems without sequence-dependent\nsetup times and release dates shown in Table 1.\nBefore describing the move evaluation schemes for all neighborhoods, we will introduce\nsome useful auxiliary functions and data structures.\nLet ρkj (t) be a non-negative, convex and piecewise linear function that represents the\npenalty of start processing job j ∈ J in machine k ∈ M at time t:\nρkj (t) =\n\n \n \nM(rj − t) + w′j(dj − p k j − t), t ∈ [0, rj] w′j(dj − p k j − t), t ∈ [rj, dj − p k j ] wj(t− dj + p k j ), t ∈ [dj − p k j ,+∞)\n(2)\nwhereM is constant, positive and sufficiently large, used to penalize release date violation.\nFor the ease of presentation we assume that rj ≤ dj − pkj . If this condition is not satisfied in practice, i.e. rj > dj − pkj , then the functions above should be modified accordingly.\nEach function ρkj (t) is composed of three segments, where the transition points, a.k.a. breakpoints, are defined by rj , dj and p k j . Release dates were considered for the sake of\ngenerality, but their existence typically enforce the presence of idle times. Since we are\nnot considering idle times in this section, we can simply disregard one of the segments by\nsetting rj = 0, ∀j ∈ J , and the functions will remain valid, but with two segments each.\nNow, for a given sequence πk, let g k j (t) be a piecewise linear function denoting the cost\nof a block composed of jobs πk(j), πk(j + 1), . . . , πk(nk) sequenced in machine k in this\norder and that job πk(j) starts to be processed at time t. Note that nk is the index of the\nlast job assigned to machine k. Each function gkj (t), ∀j ∈ J, ∀k ∈ M , can be determined\nby the following recursion:\ngkj (t) =\n{\nρkj (t), j=nk, t∈[0,+∞) gkj+1(t+ p k j + s k j,j+1) + ρ k j (t), j∈(0,nk) t∈(0,+∞)\nTo better clarify the meaning of functions ρkj (t) and g k j (t), consider the example given in\nTable 6, but disregarding the release dates and setup times. Now assuming, for instance,\ng12(t+ p 1 1) =\n{\n2− 1t, t ∈ [0, 2]\n2(t− 2), t ∈ [2,+∞)\ng11(t) =\n\n \n \n12− 3t, t ∈ [0, 2]\n6, t ∈ [2, 5]\n6 + 6(t− 5), t ∈ [5,+∞)\nFig. 8 illustrates a graphical representation of the piecewise linear functions.\nFig. 10 shows an example of how function g11(t) of Fig. 8 is stored in memory using\nthe linked list L 1 1.\n1: procedure CreateProcessingList(πk , k ′, l) 2: pB ← 0 ⊲ pB is the total processing time of the block of size l 3: for i′ = 1, . . . , l do 4: pB ← pB + p k′\nπk(i ′)\n5: for i ← 1, . . . , nk − l + 1 do 6: ProcessingList.pos[i]← i 7: ProcessingList.p[i] ← pB 8: pB ← pB − pk ′\nπk(i) + pk\n′\nπk(i+l)\n9: sort(ProcessingList,p) 10: return ProcessingList\nOnce the auxiliary functions and data structures were defined, it is now possible to\nshow how to compute the cost of a sequence π′k generated after applying one of the\nneighborhood operators.\nFor a given sequence πk, g k j (t) can have at most nk breakpoints. Since g k j (t) are\npiecewise linear functions, the complexity of obtaining the cost of a block (πk(j), πk(j +\n1), . . . , πk)) starting at time t is, in principle, O(nk), because in the worst case t can be\ngreater than the last breakpoint of the function. Hence, the complexity of evaluating a\nmove would be O(nk). However, it is possible to evaluate a move of the neighborhoods in\namortized O(1) time if the costs that depend on gkj (t) are precomputed following a given\norder.\nTable 7 shows how to compute the cost of the modified solution in amortized O(1) time\ngiven that the costs that depend on gkj (t) are precomputed in O(n 2 k). The first column\nidentifies the blocks related to the move using the same convention adopted in Figures\n3-7, while the remaining ones show how to compute the cost of each particular block\ndepending on the neighborhood and machines involved in the move. Also, as shown in\nthe referred figures, we can observe that the number of resulting blocks of a move varies\nfrom 4 to 6, according to the neighborhood. For example, a move of the neighborhood\nl–block insertion inter considers blocks B1 and B3 on machine k, and blocks B2, B4 and\nB5 on machine k ′. For a given solution, the indices i and j refer to the initial position of\nthe blocks associated with the move (see Section 4.2.1 for more details). Hence, the cost\nof a neighbor solution can be computed by summing up the costs of the blocks involved\nin the move.\nW ki−1 + [g k i (t2) − g k i+l(t3)] + [g k i+l(t1) − g k j+1(t2)] + [W k nk − W kj ] (see Table 7). The terms of this expression that depend on W k are precomputed in O(nk) steps, as shown in (1),\nwhile the terms of this expression that depend on gk can be precomputed in O(n2k) steps,\nas explained next.\nFor example, in order to store all values of gki (t2 = C k j − ∑i+l−1 a=i p k πk (a)) in O(n2k) steps,\nit is first necessary to sort the values of Ckj − ∑i+l−1 a=i p k πk (a) in ascending order. Note that this is possible to be achived by sorting the values of Ckj in ascending order, which can be\ndone in O(nk log nk) by using a standard sorting procedure. Next, for every i, it is now\npossible to compute the values of gki (t2 = C k j − ∑i+l−1 a=i p k πk (a)) in O(nk) steps, because this function has at most n segments, which leads to an overall complexity of O(n2k). A\nsimilar rationale can be applied to the other neighborhoods.\nWe will conclude this section by presenting alternative and simpler local search al-\ngorithms for the l-block insertion neighborhoods that do not rely on the auxiliary data\nstructures and functions mentioned above. The overall complexity of the search using\nsuch algorithms is O(lmaxn2k) and they are also based on the work of Ergun and Orlin\n(2006).\nIn the case of the intra-machine neighborhood, two similar but distinct procedures are\nrequired to move a block forward and backward in the sequence, respectively. Alg. 3\nshows how the moves are evaluated when a block of size l is removed and reinserted in\na forward position in the sequence. It can be observed that moves are evaluated in O(l)\nsteps (lines 9-12) by making use of the move evaluation performed immediately before the\ncurrent one. The same rationale can be applied for moving blocks of size l to a backward\nposition in the sequence. Therefore, it can be verified that the overall complexity of Alg.\n3 is O(ln2k).\nAlgorithm 3 l–block insertion intra forward\n1: procedure l-BlockInsertionIntraF(πk , fπk , l, C) 2: π∗\nk ← πk; f ∗ k ← fπk ⊲ πk is the current sequence of machine k with associated cost fπk and π ∗ k is the best improving neighbor sequence with associated cost f∗k 3: pB ← 0 ⊲ pB is the total processing time of the block considered for reinsertion 4: for i′ = 1, . . . , l do 5: pB ← pB + p\nk πk(i ′)\n6: for i = 1, . . . , nk − l do ⊲ nk is the number of jobs in machine k 7: fπ′\nk ← fπk ; ⊲ fπ′ k is the cost of the neighbor sequence π′k under evaluation\n8: for j = i+ l, . . . , nk − 1 do 9: lateness ← Cπk(j) − pB − dπk(j) 10: fπ′\nk ← fπ′ k +max{wπk(j) × lateness, w ′ πk(j) × (−lateness)}\n11: fπ′ k ← fπ′ k − fπk(j) ⊲ fπk(j) is the cost of job πk(j) in the sequence 12: fπ′ k ← fπ′ k + CompCostBlock(j, i, i+ l − 1, πk, πk, Cπk(j) − pB) 13: if fπ′ k < f∗ k then 14: π∗ k ← π′ k ; f∗ k ← fπ′\nk\n15: pB ← pB − pkπk(i) + pk πk(i+l) 16: return f∗ k\nAlg. 4 shows the pseudocode of the neighborhood l-block insertion inter-machine. Note\nthat when a block of size l is removed from machine k, one needs to compute the cost of\nthe new sequence of k only once and this can be done in O(nk) steps as in Section 4.2.2.\nAs for machine k′, where the block is going to be inserted in several positions, the cost of\neach modified sequence can be computed in O(l) using the same idea presented in Alg.\n3 after computing the cost of inserting the block in the first position in O(nk′) also as in\nSection 4.2.2. Hence, the overall complexity of Alg. 4 is O(ln2k).\nAlgorithm 4 l–block insertion inter\n1: procedure l-BlockInsertionInter(π, f, l) 2: π∗ ← π, f∗ ← fπ ⊲ π is the current solution with associated cost fπ and π∗ is the best improving neighbor with\nassociated cost f∗\n3: for k = 1, . . . m do 4: for k′ = 1, . . . m do 5: if k 6= k′ then 6: for i = 1, . . . , nk − l + 1 do 7: fπ′\nk ← W ki−1 + CompCostBlock\n(\ni− 1, i+ l, nk, πk, π ′ k , Cπk(i−1)\n)\n⊲ fπ′ k is the cost of the modified\nsequence π′k 8: π̃k′ ← 〈πk(i), . . . , πk(i+ l− 1)〉 ⊕ 〈πk′ 〉 9: fπ′\nk′ ← l-blockInsertionIntraF(π̃k′ , fπ̃k′ , l) only for i = 1 (lines 9-14 of Alg. 3) ⊲ fπ′k′ is the cost of\nthe modified sequence π′ k′\n10: if fπ − fπk − fπk′ + fπ′k + fπ′ k′ < f∗ then 11: f∗ ← fπ − fπk − fπk′ + fπ′k + fπ′\nk′\n12: π∗ ← π′ 13: return f∗\n4.2.4 Move evaluation for problems with sequence-dependent setup times but without idle\ntime\nLiao et al. (2012) showed, for problem 1|sij|wjTj, that is possible to perform the move\nevaluations of the same neighborhoods considered by Ergun and Orlin (2006) in amortized\nO(1) time, but at the expense of preprocessing the required auxiliary data structures in\nO(n2 log n) operations. Their method is based on the one of the latter authors and it can\nbe extended to solve problem R|skij | ∑ w′jEj + wjTj and its particular cases (only those\nwithout idle time) by using the same rationale presented in Section 4.2.3.\nThe main difference between the approaches of Liao et al. (2012) and Ergun and Orlin\n(2006) is the preprocessing phase, where the sorting procedure should be called for each\ni before computing the values of gki (t) for each j in the sequence, because t now depends on the existing setup times, thus leading to a complexity of O(n2logn).\nNevertheless, this approach seems to be indicated for large scale instances, as suggested\nby the experiments performed in Liao et al. (2012). For small-medium scale instances the\nprocedure described in Section 4.2.2 appears to be more suitable to address the problems\nwith sequence-dependent setup times listed in Table 1.\n4.2.5 Move evaluation for problems with idle time\nIbaraki et al. (2005) proposed an efficient approach for evaluating the moves during the\nlocal search when idle times are considered. In this case, the timing problem, which\nconsists of determining the optimal start time of each job in the sequence, should also\nbe solved when evaluating the cost of a solution. The authors first present a dynamic\nprogramming based algorithm to solve this problem and then they show how to integrate\nsuch method within the local search.\nAs in Ergun and Orlin (2006), the method of Ibaraki et al. (2005) relies on auxiliary\ndata structures and functions. The idea is to determine functions that return the minimum\npenalty of the subsequences (blocks) when starting at a particular time t, both forward\nand backward. The cost of the solution under evaluation is thus computed by using such\ninformation over the resulting sequence obtained after concatenating certain subsequences.\nIn Ibaraki et al. (2008) the authors suggested a balanced binary tree based implemen-\ntation that allows for solving the timing problem in O(nk log δk) time, where δk denotes\nthe total number of segments of the penalty function for the jobs sequenced in machine k.\nAs demonstrated by the authors, a move can be evaluated in amortized O(log δmax) time,\nwhere δmax is the largest δk among the machines involved. The necessary functions of each\nmachine k can be precomputed in O(δk log δk) steps. However, for simplicity, we used a\nlinked list based implementation (Ibaraki et al., 2005), which yields an amortized com-\nplexity of O(δmax) where the necessary functions for each machine k can be precomputed\nin O(nkδk) steps.\nFor the neighborhoods considered in this work, the modified solutions can be obtained\nby concatenating at most three subsequences, as described in detail in Ibaraki et al. (2005,\n2008).\n4.3 Perturbation Mechanisms\nThe following three perturbation mechanisms were implemented:\n• (l, l′)-block swap intra-machine: one (l, l′)-block swap intra-machine move is per-\nformed at random with l and l′ ∈ {2, . . . , n/4}.\n• Multiple (1, 1)-insertion inter-machine: a job j from a machine k is moved to a\nmachine k′, while a job j′ from k′ is moved to k. The jobs, machines and positions\nto be inserted are all chosen at random and such procedure is repeated one, two or\nthree consecutive times.\n• Multiple (l, l′)-block insertion inter-machine: this perturbation generalizes the pre-\nvious one but in this case blocks of jobs of sizes l and l′, respectively, are involved in\nthe move with l ∈ {1, 2} and l′ ∈ {2, 3}.\nThe first mechanism is only applied for single machine problems, while the second and\nthird are only applied for parallel machine problems and they are chosen at random.\n5 Computational experiments\nThe UILS algorithm was coded in C++ and the experiments were executed in an Intel\nCore i7-2600 with 3.40 GHz and 16 GB of RAM running under Ubuntu Linux 12.04.\nOnly a single thread was used in our testing. The proposed algorithm was executed 10\ntimes for each instance in the final experiments. Furthermore, with a view of better\ncomparing the runtime performance between UILS and other methods from the literature\nthat used machines with a quite inferior hardware performance than ours, we have scaled\nthe CPU time values reported in their work to our machine. This was done by means of\napproximation factors that were computed using the single thread rating values reported\nin https://www.cpubenchmark.net/.\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of the problems listed in Table 1 does not have publicly\navailable instances. Most authors usually generate the instances for a particular problem\nthemselves but they seldom make them easily accessible for the research community. Table\n8 lists some problems in which we are aware that there are instances available online. We\nexecuted the UILS algorithm only for those with results reported in the literature.\nWe remark that we do not present the results obtained by our algorithm for the\npublicly available instances of problems 1|sij| ∑ Tj and 1|sij| ∑ wjTj , because those\nfound by a similar and simplified version of this algorithm were already reported in\nSubramanian et al. (2014). UILS still finds slightly better results than the simpli-\nfied algorithm, but for brevity we chose not report them here. We also do not re-\nport the results found for the publicly available instances of single machine prob-\nlems without sequence-dependent setup times, in particular, 1|| ∑ wjTj, 1|rj| ∑ wjTj , 1|| ∑\nw′jEj + wjTj, 1|rj| ∑ w′jEj + wjTj , 1|rj| ∑ wjCj, because they are well-solved by\nthe highly sophisticated exact algorithms of Tanaka et al. (2009); Tanaka and Fujikuma\n(2012). UILS even finds the optimal solutions of such instances but not as fast as the\nexact methods. Moreover, we are not aware of any heuristic method whose performance\nis comparable to the exact ones for these problems.\nTable 8: Selected problems with publicly available instances\nProblem #Instances |J| |M| Related work\nP || ∑ Tj 2250 1 20 and 25 2 to 10 Tanaka and Araki (2008) P || ∑ wjTj 1125 2 40 to 100 2, 4, 10, 20 and 30 Rodrigues et al.

We used an incremental\napproach where we included one neighborhood at a time in ascending order of l and l′,\nand then we evaluated the impact on the solution quality after such inclusion. More pre-\ncisely, for every new neighborhood considered, we applied the RVND procedure over an\ninitial solution and then we computed the value of the gap of the resulting local optimum\nwith respect to the initial solution. Initially, only one neighborhood of a particular type\nwas considered, namely 1-block insertion intra-machine, and then we kept increasing the\nset until no improvement was verified. In this case, we stopped adding the l-block inser-\ntion intra-machine neighborhoods and started including (l, l′)-block swap intra-machine\nneighborhoods until no improvement was observed. Then we included the l-block insertion\ninter-machine neighborhoods and, finally, the (l, l′)-block swap intra-machine neighbor-\nhoods.\nWe selected 24 challenging instances among those available for problem P || ∑ w′jEj +\nwjTj (without idle time) to determine the neighborhood sets. For each instance and for\neach combination of neighborhoods, we ran the RVND procedure 5 times over different\ninitial solutions and we stored the average improvement obtained. Table 9 reports the\naverage improvements obtained for each combination. Strikethrough entries correspond\nto those neighborhoods that have been disregarded due to lack of average improvement\non the solution quality. The following sets were selected: Lintra = {1, 2}, L′intra = {(1, 1)}, Linter = {1, 2} and L′inter = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)}.\nIt is worth mentioning that for single machine problems we considered Lintra = {1, 2, 3}\nand L′intra = (1, 1) as in Subramanian et al.

Idle times are also permitted. We performed similar comparisons and\nanalyses as for problem R|| ∑\nwjTj . Aggregated results are provided in Table 17, while\ndetailed results are presented in Tables 47-58 (see Appendix A.4).\nFrom Table 17, we can observe that the proposed algorithm managed to improve the\nbest known upper bounds of 634 instances and to equal the best results of another 84,\nincluding all known 33 optimal solutions. As expected, the CPU times are much higher\nthan problem R|| ∑\nwjTj, even for IILS = n rather than IILS = 4 × n, because of the\nexistence of idle times, which make the local search procedure more time consuming.\nMoreover, UILS spent, on average, more CPU time than PR+Benders+SiPSi, but at\nthe same time we can observe that the average gaps found by our heuristic was always\nsmaller than those obtained by PR+Benders+SiPSi. Finally, despite the higher total\nruntimes, UILS required, on average, 48.8 seconds to find or improve the best solutions\nof 718 instances.\nthe speedup achieved by UILSFast, which is given by the ratio between the average CPU\ntime spent by UILSTrad and the one spent by UILSFast.\n6 Concluding Remarks\nThis paper proposed a unified Iterated Local Search based heuristic algorithm, denoted as\nUILS, for a large class of earliness-tardiness scheduling problems. There is a huge number\nof scheduling problems in the literature and they are usually solved by specific resolution\nmethods. Because each problem has its own particularities, the development of a more\ngeneral approach becomes a highly challenging task. This also partially explains the lack\nof unified algorithms for scheduling problems, especially when it comes to heuristics, which\noften have to be considerably modified to efficiently cope with different characteristics such\nas the inclusion of sequence-dependent setup and/or idle times. Therefore, we strongly\nbelieve that the introduction of an efficient unified heuristic approach capable of solving\na number of scheduling problems can be seen as a relevant and important contribution.\nDue to the large number of works related to the variants considered in the present\npaper, performing a complete literature review can be very tough. Hence, another contri-\nbution of this work was to present an annotated bibliography containing more than 130\nrelated works published in the last 25 years.\nIn addition to dealing with a significant variety of problems, the proposed unified algo-\nrithm also takes into account the particularities of each problem by efficiently performing\nthe move evaluation during the local search. UILS automatically detects the most ef-\nficient method to be used according to some characteristics of the problem such as the\nexistence of sequence-dependent setup times, release dates, idle times and so on. The effi-\ncient move evaluation schemes used in this work were mostly based on those presented in\nIbaraki et al. (2005), Ibaraki et al. (2008), Ergun and Orlin (2006) and Liao et al. (2012).\nWhile we directly applied the method of the first two works for problems with idle times,\nwe had to generalize the ideas of the latter two in order to deal with parallel machines\nproblems without idle times. This generalization was also a crucial contribution of the\npaper, since it improved the performance of UILS in terms of CPU time in some problems,\nmore especially, those without sequence-dependent setup times.\nUILS was tested in hundreds of instances from the literature and the results obtained\nwere compared with the best ones available. The computational experiments revealed\nthat the unified method was capable of finding high quality solutions in competitive CPU\ntimes.\nDespite the remarkable results found by the unified algorithm for the variants with\navailable test-problems and results, the lack of existing benchmark instances prevented\nUILS to have its robustness better evaluated. Future avenues of research include the\ngeneration of new set of instances for the problems where it was not possible to test the\nproposed algorithm, as well as the development of a simple and general exact method\ncapable of tackling the variants considered in this work, so as to provide lower bounds for\nthe instances to be created.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Dr. Halil Şen and Dr. Kerem Bülbül for the valuable comments\nand suggestions.

    "abstractText" : "This work proposes a unified heuristic algorithm for a large class of earliness-tardiness (E-T)<lb>scheduling problems. We consider single/parallel machine E-T problems that may or may not consider<lb>some additional features such as idle time, setup times and release dates. In addition, we also consider<lb>those problems whose objective is to minimize either the total (average) weighted completion time or<lb>the total (average) weighted flow time, which arise as particular cases when the due dates of all jobs are<lb>either set to zero or to their associated release dates, respectively. The developed local search based<lb>metaheuristic framework is quite simple, but at the same time relies on sophisticated procedures for<lb>efficiently performing local search according to the characteristics of the problem. We present efficient<lb>move evaluation approaches for some parallel machine problems that generalize the existing ones for<lb>single machine problems. The algorithm was tested in hundreds of instances of several E-T problems<lb>and particular cases. The results obtained show that our unified heuristic is capable of producing<lb>high quality solutions when compared to the best ones available in the literature that were obtained<lb>by specific methods. Moreover, we provide an extensive annotated bibliography on the problems<lb>related to those considered in this work, where we not only indicate the approach(es) used in each<lb>publication, but we also point out the characteristics of the problem(s) considered. Beyond that, we<lb>classify the existing methods in different categories so as to have a better idea of the popularity of<lb>each type of solution procedure.",
