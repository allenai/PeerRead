      "text" : "In Recommender Systems research, algorithms are often characterized as either Collaborative Filtering (CF) or Content Based (CB). CF algorithms are trained using a dataset of user explicit or implicit preferences while CB algorithms are typically based on item profiles. These approaches harness very different data sources hence the resulting recommended items are generally also very different. This paper presents a novel model that serves as a bridge from items content into their CF representations. We introduce a multiple input deep regression model to predict the CF latent embedding vectors of items based on their textual description and metadata. We showcase the effectiveness of the proposed model by predicting the CF vectors of movies and apps based on their textual descriptions. Finally, we show that the model can be further improved by incorporating metadata such as the movie release year and tags which contribute to a higher accuracy.\nKeywords Recommender Systems, Collaborative Filtering, Neural Embedding, Multi-view Representation Learning, Item2vec, SkipGram, Word2vec, Cold Start, Content Based Filtering, Item Similarity"

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "In Recommender Systems research, CF models are commonly used for a variety of personalization tasks [9]–[11]. A common approach in CF is to learn a low-dimensional latent space that captures the user’s preference patterns or “taste”. For example, Matrix Factorization (MF) models [8] are commonly used to map users and items into a dense manifold using a dataset of usage patterns or explicit ratings. An alternative to the CF approach is the Content Based (CB) approach which uses item profiles such as metadata and item descriptions, etc. CF approaches are generally accepted to more accurate than CB approaches [32].\nOur goal is to predict the CF representation of items based on their CB profiles. The CB profiles are obtained from multiple sources such as item tags, numeric values and textual descriptions. Hence, the CB profiles are a mix of categorical, continuous and unstructured data. For example, the CB representation of a movie contains tags (genres, actors, director, languages), numeric values (release year) and textual description (plot summary). To obtain the CF representations, we have used the item2vec [12] algorithm.\nFinally, to learn a mapping from items CB representation to their CF representation, we propose a novel multiple input deep regression model that receives the CB representation as input and uses the CF latent vectors as labels.\nWe demonstrate the application of the proposed model for movies and apps recommender systems. We utilize a CNN on top of word2vec representation to learn a mapping from textual description of items (movie plots or app descriptions) to their CF latent vectors based on item2vec. We note that the approach in this paper is not restricted to item2vec and can be trivially extended to any CF algorithm that is based on a low-dimensional latent embedding such as most common MF models [8].\nBeyond the textual descriptions, the model can be enhanced by adding different types of structured metadata as input. This metadata can be used as additional input along the textual descriptions to produce a mapping which is more accurate than when using each information source separately.\nThis paper makes several contributions: First, we introduce a model for bridging the gap between items’ CB profiles and their CF representations. This can be particularly useful for recommending new items where usage and preference data is not available (the items “cold-start” problem). Secondly, we present a multi-source architecture that supports a combination of categorical, continuous and unstructured data as an input. Finally, we investigate the contribution of each information source with respect to the ultimate CF prediction task.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related work and contrasts it with the current one. Section 3 explains the proposed model in detail. Section 4, presents the experimental setup, the datasets used in this paper and provides both quantitative and qualitative results. Finally, Section 5 concludes and discusses future research."

      "text" : "Deep learning models are being applied in a growing number of machine learning applications. Considerable technological advancements have been achieved in the fields of computer vision [1] and speech recognition [2]. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), deep learning methods have been mostly focused on learning word vector representations [3]-[6], [30]. Specifically, Skip-Gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS) [5], known also as word2vec, has drawn much attention for its versatile uses in several linguistic tasks.\nWord2vec maps a sparse 1-of-V encoding (where V is the size of the vocabulary) into a dense low-dimensional latent space which encodes semantic information. The resulting word representations span a manifold in which semantically related words are close to each other. A recent work by Kim [7] has further enhanced this approach by applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) on top Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page. To copy otherwise, or republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists, requires prior specific permission and/or a fee.\nof the latent word representations to glean more information from unstructured textual data.\nThe first part of our model starts from a very similar architecture: First, a word2vec model is established in order to map words taken from the item descriptions into a latent semantic manifold. Then, a CNN model is placed in cascade in order to utilize the semantic information for predicting the CF representation of the items. Therefore, the model in this paper serves as a mapping between the content profiles of items and their CF representations.\nAn interesting observation is that the principle behind CF models such as MF models bears much similarity to SGNS models: both approaches work by “summarizing” a large dataset of sparse entities into a dense manifold that facilitates extraction of useful information. In the case of a word2vec model, the manifold encodes semantic information, while in MF the manifold encodes user preference information. Moreover, a simple neural network that maps a sparse 1-of-M encoding of users (where M is the number of users) into a sparse encoding of N items using a single hidden layer is in fact identical to a MF model: The weight parameters on the incoming and outgoing edges of the hidden layer are respectively equivalent to the user and items vectors of a MF model. The similarity of SGNS to MF has been thoroughly studied in [24].\nItem2vec [12] is a variant of the SGNS with a modified objective aimed at learning item representations for CF tasks. Training is performed using sets of items that were co-purchased or coconsumed by users. Unlike MF models, in item2vec the users are not modeled directly in the latent space. Instead, in item2vec, users are treated as sets of items that are analogous to sentences in word2vec – these users are the “glue” that indicates relevance between co-occurring items.\nMany attempts have been taken to leverage multiple views for representation learning. Ngiam et al. [25] proposed a ‘split autoencoder’ approach to extract a joint representation by reconstructing both views from a single view. Andrew et al. [26] introduce a deep variant of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) [29] dubbed Deep CCA (DCCA). In DCCA, two deep neural networks were trained in order to extract representations for two views, where the canonical correlation between the representations is maximized. Other variants of DCCA are investigated in [27, 28].\nIn the context of Recommender Systems, Wang et al. [20] proposed a hierarchical Bayesian model for learning a joint representation for content information and collaborative filtering ratings. Djuric et al. [21] introduced hierarchical neural language models for joint representation of streaming documents and their content with application to personalized recommendations. Xiao and Quan [22] suggested a hybrid recommendation algorithm based on collaborative filtering and word2vec, where recommendations scores are computed by a weighted combination of CF and CB scores.\nThis paper differs from the aforementioned works by several aspects: first, we do not learn a joint representation for both CF and CB views nor do we optimize CCA variants. Instead, we learn a mapping from the CB view directly into the CF view. Second, we introduce a flexible model architecture that supports a combination of various types of input, simultaneously. Third, our model does not produce representation for users, as our task is to predict the CF representation of items. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce such a setup, hence a direct comparison of these models is not valid."

      "text" : "In this section we provide a detailed description of the proposed model. Our task is to predict the CF representation for each item from its content (textual description / metadata). Given an effective\nfinite set of items 1{ } K kI k == ⊂ ℕ and co-occurrences matrix\n{0,1}K KA ×∈ , we first employ item2vec [12] to produce a mapping\n: nCFM I →ℝ from an item k to a CF vector v .\nThe CB profile of an item k is obtained by using different mappings for different information sources. For the textual descriptions (e.g. movie plot summaries), we consider two different mappings: 2 : l m w vM I × → ℝ is a mapping from an item to a matrix\nthat consists of l rows, where each row is a m -dimensional word vector obtained by word2vec [5]. This matrix corresponds to the\nfirst l words in the textual description of the item. If the number of\nwords is less than l , we pad the matrix with zero rows. 2w vM is\nused to generate the input for the CNN-based text component (Section 3.1).\nThe second mapping for textual data maps an item to its bag of words (BOW) representation denoted by : [0,1]bBOWM I → . This\nmapping is obtained by first applying k-means clustering on the word2vec representations of the entire vocabulary. We denote the number of clusters by b. Then, given the item’s description text, soft alignment is applied between each word vector in the text and the b centroids. The result is a histogram vector, which is then\nnormalized into probabilities to form the BOW representations. This approach is inspired by prominent BOW models in computer vision [15].\nFor CB information in the form of tags / categories we define a\nmapping : {0,1} T\ntags M I → from an item to binary vector in size\nT , where T is the size of available tags. Each entry in the binary vector corresponds to a different tag and the value indicates whether the tag related to the item or not.\nThe last mapping we applied is used for numerical inputs and denoted by : cnumM I → ℝ . This mapping maps an item to a c - dimensional vector, where each element corresponds to one of c continuous features. In the examples we have used, the only numeric feature was a movie’s release year. Therefore, in this case\nnumM is reduced to :numM I →ℕ .\nIn order to harness the different information sources, we utilize a multiple input deep regression model consisting of three distinct types of components corresponding to each type of information source: textual, tags and numeric information. In what follows, we describe this architecture in detail."

      "text" : "The text components are designed to receive raw text as input and output a fixed size vector. In this work, we implement two different types of text components: dubbed ‘CNN’ and ‘BOW’ (marked red in Fig. 1). The CNN approach follows Kim’s ‘CNN non-static’\nmodel from [7]. As explained earlier, using 2w vM , we map the\nsequence of words in the textual input to a matrix which serves as the input to a CNN network. An illustration of this approach (taken from [7]) appears in Fig. 1(d). We note that the backpropagation process continues through the CNN onto the initial word2vec representations allowing the word embedding to freely adjust with respect to the CF prediction task at hand. Hence, the initial mapping\n2w vM is fine-tuned throughout the training process.\nOur CNN consists of a single 1D convolutional layer with a filter length of 3 and L2 regularization on its weights. This is followed by a global max pooling layer (convolution and pooling are applied over the time axis) and an additional fully connected (FC) layer. In contrast to [7], we did not apply parallel convolutional layers with different filter lengths. We did experiment with multiple filter\nlengths (2-12), but these attempts failed to materialize into any gains with respect to our objective. A similar observation was also made in [31].\nWe applied a random dropout of words before feeding them into the CNN. This technique was instrumental in improving the model’s generalization capability and avoiding overfitting. The probability for dropping words can be either fixed or proportional to the words’ frequency. We found that both methods yield similar results and therefore resulted to using a fixed dropping probability of 0.2.\nWe considered several additional variants of CNN-based models as in [7]: (1) the ‘CNN random’ model learns the word\nrepresentation 2w vM from scratch by using random initialization of\nthe word vectors; (2) the ‘CNN static’ model that keeps the\nword2vec representation 2w vM fixed during the entire training\nprocess; (3) the ‘CNN multichannel’ model, which is a combination of both the ‘non-static’ and ‘static’ models. However, the ‘CNN non-static’ variant outperformed all the rest. In the remainder of this paper we refer to this variant as our CNN component.\nOur second approach for utilizing textual information is based on a Bag of Words (BOW) on top of the word2vec representations.\nThe BOW representation is computed by BOWM and is fed into a\nneural network with two FC layers and dropout in between. The BOW network architecture is presented in Fig. 1(c)."

The tags network component is a binary input vector in the dimension of number of tags and a single FC hidden layer with L2 regularization on its weights. No further improvement was gained by including additional layers. The input for the tags component is given by\ntags M . The tags component is illustrated in Fig 1(a).\nIn the movies examples, we used different tags components for different types of tags: genres, actors, directors and language tags. The hidden layer dimension is determined for each component according to the number of tags and their available combinations. For example, the actors component might be assigned with a higher output dimension than the language component. This is due to the fact that the number of actors is much larger than the number of languages. Moreover, movies usually contain multiple actors, but a single language."

Genres, actors, directors and languages are modeled as tags components, the movie plot summary is modeled as text component. In this implementation, the text component can be either CNN or BOW network. The movie’s release year is modeled as a numeric component. All of the components outputs are then fed into the combiner component that outputs a predicted CF vector. The loss function we use to train the model is the Mean Square Error (MSE), which is a common choice for regression tasks.\nReLU [1] activations are used in all of the model components. It is worth noting that we experimented with other types of activations such as sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent, however, these were found to perform worse. The only exception is the output layer of the combiner, where we use linear activations, which is a common practice for regression models.\nIt is important to emphasize that the propose model is extremely flexible in the sense that each component can be easily disconnected from the combiner and the extension for additional information sources is straightforward.

This results in 173,266 sets that contain 11,108 unique items (movies) as the effective training data for learning the item2vec model [12].\nFor each movie, we collected metadata from IMDB [33]. Three types of information sources are collected: movie plot (given as raw text), genres / actors / directors / languages (given as tags) and release year (given as a natural number). In the metadata tags, we filtered tags that with less than 5 occurrences resulting in a remainder of 23 genres, 1526 actors, 470 directors and 72 languages.\nWe created movie CB profiles as follows: First, we represented each movie’s plot summary by taking the first 500 words with word2vec mapping. We used zero padding for the plot descriptions shorter than 500 words. Then, the metadata fields from above were added to the movie profiles. Note that some of the movies had missing information.

Formally, MSE\nis measured as follows: = | | ∑ − ∈ , where is the set of all test set items, is the original CF vector, and is the predicted vector. Minimizing the MSE is the objective of all the systems in this paper. It quantifies the ability of the different systems to reconstruct the original CF vectors. However, MSE does not have any direct business interpretation with regard to the ultimate collaborative filtering task. Hence, our next evaluation measures are borrowed from the field of CF research and directly quantify the quality of the predicted vectors with regard to the CF task.\nOur second measure quantifies the quality of the predicted vectors in terms of item similarities in the CF latent manifold. For each predicted CF vector, we compute item similarities to all other items as well as to its own original CF vector. Then, we measure the Mean Percentile Rank (MPR) of the original item with respect to all other items. Formally, we denote by the ranked position of the original item, when measured against the other items based on similarity to the predicted vector. For a dataset of M items, the best possible rank is = 0 and the worst is = − 1. The MPR\nmeasure is computed according to = | | ∑ ∈ . Note that 0 ≤ ≤ 1, where = 0 is the optimal value and = 0.5 can be achieved by random predictions. Our final evaluation measure was chosen to quantify the ability of the predicted vectors to maintain the original item similarities. Specifically, we care more about the ability to find the most relevant item to each test item. Hence, we chose to use the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain for the top K most similar items or ! . This measure is computed by finding the K items most similar to the predicted vector, and summing their discounted relevance scores based on the original item vector. Formally, for the i’th test item the Discounted Cumulative Gain at K is given by ! = \"# +∑ %& '\n()*+ ,-\n. ,/ , where \"# , is the\nrelevance score of the k’th retrieved item to the i’th test item. The relevance scores are simply the similarities of the retrieved items to the test item based on its original vector. Then, the normalized discounted commutative gain at K is computed by normalizing the item’s ! score by its maximum possible value also known as the Ideal Discounted Commutative Gain at K or 0 ! . The 0 ! is achieved by ranking the items according to the original (item2vec) CF vector and taking the K most similar items. The final measure is computed by averaging over all the test set\n! ≤ 1 and ! = 1 indicates a “perfect” prediction for the top K most similar items."

In most cases, the three evaluation measures are highly correlated. In what follows, we identify common trends across all evaluation measures and provide interpretations to these trends.\nFirst, let us consider the ‘BOW’ vs. the ‘CNN’ systems. Both systems are based purely on the movie textual descriptions. Our results show that ‘CNN’ approach achieves better results than the ‘BOW’ approach. This showcases the ability of the ‘CNN’ model to benefit from the semantic information encoded in the word2vec representations as well as the ability of the ‘CNN’ filters to pick up the semantical context encoded by word propagation in the text. Next, we turn to consider the tags data. As explained in Section 3.2, there are four types of tags based systems: ‘Genres’, ‘Actors’, ‘Directors’, and ‘Language’ and we consider each system separately. Table 1 and Fig. 3 show that these systems were outperformed by ‘CNN’ across all measures. This indicates the ability of the ‘CNN’ system to utilize the textual information even beyond these very informative data sources.\nThe ‘Year’ system, based on movies release year, outperforms each of the previous systems including the ‘CNN’. Clearly, a movie’s release year alone cannot make for a good recommender system. Nevertheless, it captures a key pattern in the MovieLens dataset, which is characterized by many users who watch movies with adjacent release dates. Typically, movies are heavily promoted during their release period and much of the viewing patterns recorded in the MovieLens dataset occur during that period. Many MovieLens users watch multiple movies with close release dates. Hence, a movie’s release date explains a very dominant pattern in the dataset.\nFinally, we turn to consider systems in which different information sources are combined. We notice that each combined model generates a considerable performance boost over its respective systems. Ultimately, the ‘CNN+Tags+Year’ system (the ‘full’ model) outperforms all the rest by combining all these information sources together."

The third column presents recommendations produced by the ‘CNN+Tags+Year’ system (the ‘full’ model) that utilizes all information sources. The last column presents recommendations produced by the ‘CNN’ system that leverages textual description of movies (plots) solely.\nThree well-known movies from the test set are considered: ‘Shrek’ (2001), ‘The Hangover’ (2011) and ‘Gladiator’ (2000). We notice the tendency of the CF based recommendations to prefer popular movies. The ‘full’ model tends to pick recommendations from adjacent years having the same genre / actors and with similar plots. The ‘CNN’ model produces recommendations that are not restricted to a specific year. Therefore, it contains the recommendations ‘Shrek the Third’ and ‘Shrek Forever After’ that are the third and fourth movies in the ‘Shrek’ series released in later years (2007 and 2010). The ‘CNN’ model exhibits the same behavior, when recommending the third movie in ‘The Hangover’ series. This showcases the ability of the ‘CNN’ model to accurately identify the movie type in the query by analyzing its plot and provide recommendations that are competitive with the other two models.\nIn the word2vec paper by Mikolov et al. [5], the authors illustrated the ability of their model to automatically organize word representations that capture semantical relations. For example, they showed that the relationship between a country and its capital is captured by the difference between their respective vector representations (Fig. 2 in [5]). Inspired by this work, we demonstrate the ability of our model to encode relationships between actors. Representations for actors are produced by setting the corresponding entry of the actor in the ‘Actors’ component to 1 and setting all other entries to 0.\nTable 4 presents the learned relationships. The left column presents a relationship between actors captured by the distance vector between their representations. In the right column, this relationship is applied to a new actor by adding the distance vector\nto a new origin. The closest artist is then retrieved (according to cosine similarity) and presented as the result of the summation.\nThe first example demonstrates a relationship based on a generational (~ 20 years) gap between actors that play in movies from the same genres. The second example demonstrates a transition from versatile actors to more comedy oriented actors in both genders. Finally, the third example demonstrates a transition from American to British actors across different genres.\nFigure 4 depicts a t-SNE [13] embedding of the original (item2vec) CF vectors (a) and the predicted vectors by our ‘full’ model (b) for a random pick of 900 movies from the top six genres in the test set. For movies with multiple genre tags, we depict the first tag as their genre. Figure 4 shows that genre clustering exists both in the original CF space and even more so in the predicted space.\nFigure 5 depicts a random pick of 1100 movies from the test set and the t-SNE embedding of their original CF vectors (a) and the vectors predicted by our model (b). This figure investigates the importance of a movie release dates in finding similar items. In accordance with the evaluation measures, Fig. 5 indicates that a release date is an important factor in the original CF similarities as well as in the resulting predictions."

The second column presents recommendations that were produced using the original CF vectors based on item2vec. The third column presents recommendations produced by the ‘CNN’ system. As we can see, the ‘CNN’ system manages to provide accurate recommendations with respect to the given seed item based on textual description of apps solely."

      "text" : "In this paper, we introduce a novel model that maps content based item information to its CF representation. We focus on movie and app recommendations and show a network architecture that maps movie structured metadata as well as unstructured textual descriptions into their latent CF representations. The textual\ndescriptions were processed using a word2vec model followed by a CNN that scans the text in a similar fashion to latest NLP models [7]. In our evaluation, we show the effectiveness of the system in predicting useful movie and app recommendations and explore the contribution of each of its components.\nIn the future, we plan to investigate additional directions. Specifically, we plan to train a model to predict both metadata tags and the CF representation, simultaneously, from textual descriptions. This model will use a hybrid loss function that consists of classification and regression losses. We also plan to expand the model presented in this paper to include additional information sources such as audio, image and video. We further plan to apply the same ideas to books and music datasets."

CF algorithms are trained using a dataset of user explicit or implicit preferences while CB algorithms are typically based on item profiles. These approaches harness very different data sources hence the resulting recommended items are generally also very different. This paper presents a novel model that serves as a bridge from items content into their CF representations. We introduce a multiple input deep regression model to predict the CF latent embedding vectors of items based on their textual description and metadata. We showcase the effectiveness of the proposed model by predicting the CF vectors of movies and apps based on their textual descriptions. Finally, we show that the model can be further improved by incorporating metadata such as the movie release year and tags which contribute to a higher accuracy.",
