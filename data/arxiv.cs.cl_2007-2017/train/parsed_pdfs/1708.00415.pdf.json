      "text" : "Generative models defining joint distributions over parse trees and sentences are good theoretical models for interpreting natural language data, and appealing tools for tasks such as parsing, grammar induction and language modeling (Collins, 1999; Henderson, 2003; Titov and Henderson, 2007; Petrov and Klein, 2007; Dyer et al., 2016). However, they often impose strong independence assumptions which restrict the use of arbitrary features for effective disambiguation. Moreover, generative parsers are typically trained by maximizing the joint probability of the parse tree and the sentence—an objective that only indirectly relates to the goal of parsing. At test time, these models require a relatively expensive recognition algo-\n1Our code is available at https://github.com/cheng6076/virnng.git.\nrithm (Collins, 1999; Titov and Henderson, 2007) to recover the parse tree, but the parsing performance consistently lags behind their discriminative competitors (Nivre et al., 2007; Huang, 2008; Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010), which are directly trained to maximize the conditional probability of the parse tree given the sentence, where linear-time decoding algorithms exist (e.g., for transition-based parsers).\nIn this work, we propose a parsing and language modeling framework that marries a generative model with a discriminative recognition algorithm in order to have the best of both worlds. The idea of combining these two types of models is not new. For example, Collins and Koo (2005) propose to use a generative model to generate candidate constituency trees and a discriminative model to rank them. Sangati et al. (2009) follow the opposite direction and employ a generative model to re-rank the dependency trees produced by a discriminative parser. However, previous work combines the two types of models in a goal-oriented, pipeline fashion, which lacks model interpretations and focuses solely on parsing.\nIn comparison, our framework unifies generative and discriminative parsers with a single objective, which connects to expectation maximization and variational inference in grammar induction settings. In a nutshell, we treat parse trees as latent factors generating natural language sentences and parsing as a posterior inference task. We showcase the framework using Recurrent Neural Network Grammars (RNNGs; Dyer et al. 2016), a recently proposed probabilistic model of phrase-structure trees based on neural transition systems. Different from this work which introduces separately trained discriminative and generative models, we integrate the two in an auto-encoder which fits our training objective. We show how the framework enables grammar induction, parsing and language\nmodeling within a single implementation. On the English Penn Treebank, we achieve competitive performance on constituency parsing and state-ofthe-art single-model language modeling score."

      "heading" : "2 Preliminaries",
      "text" : "In this section we briefly describe Recurrent Neural Network Grammars (RNNGs; Dyer et al. 2016), a top-down transition-based algorithm for parsing and generation. There are two versions of RNNG, one discriminative, the other generative. We follow the original paper in presenting the discriminative variant first.\nThe discriminative RNNG follows a shiftreduce parser that converts a sequence of words into a parse tree. As in standard shift-reduce parsers, the RNNG uses a buffer to store unprocessed terminal symbols and a stack to store partially completed syntactic constituents. At each timestep, one of the following three operations2 is performed:\n• NT(X) introduces an open non-terminal X onto the top of the stack, represented as an\nopen parenthesis followed by X, e.g., (NP.\n• SHIFT fetches the terminal in the front of the buffer and pushes it onto the top of the stack.\n• REDUCE completes a subtree by repeatedly popping the stack until an open non-terminal\nis encountered. The non-terminal is popped as well, after which a composite term representing the entire subtree is pushed back onto the top of the stack, e.g., (NP the cat).\nThe above transition system can be adapted with minor modifications to an algorithm that generates trees and sentences. In generator transitions, there is no input buffer of unprocessed words but there is an output buffer for storing words that have been generated. To reflect the change, the previous SHIFT operation is modified into a GEN operation defined as follows:\n• GEN generates a terminal symbol and add it to the stack and the output buffer.\n2To be precise, the total number of operations under our description is |X|+2 since the NT operation varies with the non-terminal choice X."

      "text" : "Our framework unifies generative and discriminative parsers within a single training objective. For illustration, we adopt the two RNNG variants introduced above with our customized features. Our starting point is the generative model (§ 3.1), which allows us to make explicit claims about the generative process of natural language sentences. Since this model alone lacks a bottom-up recognition mechanism, we introduce a discriminative recognition model (§ 3.2) and connect it with the generative model in an encoder-decoder setting. To offer a clear interpretation of the training objective (§ 3.3), we first consider the parse tree as latent and the sentence as observed. We then discuss extensions that account for labeled parse trees. Finally, we present various inference techniques for parsing and language modeling within the framework (§ 3.4)."

      "text" : "The decoder is a generative RNNG that models the joint probability p(x, y) of a latent parse tree y and an observed sentence x. Since the parse tree is defined by a sequence of transition actions a, we write p(x, y) as p(x, a).3 The joint distribution p(x, a) is factorized into a sequence of transition probabilities and terminal probabilities (when actions are GEN), which are parametrized by a transitional state embedding u:\np(x, a) = p(a)p(x|a)\n=\n|a|∏\nt=1\np(at|ut)p(xt|ut) I(at=GEN) (1)\nwhere I is an indicator function and ut represents the state embedding at time step t. Specifically, the conditional probability of the next action is:\np(at|ut) =\n|a|∏\nt=1\nexp(atu T t + ba)∑\na′∈A exp(a ′uTt + ba′)\n(2)\nwhere at represents the action embedding at time step t, A the action space and ba the bias. Similarly, the next word probability (when GEN is invoked) is computed as:\np(wt|ut) =\n|a|∏\nt=1\nexp(wtu T t + bw)∑\nw′∈W exp(w ′uTt + bw′)\n(3)\n3We assume that the action probability does not take the actual terminal choice into account.\nwhere W denotes all words in the vocabulary. To satisfy the independence assumptions imposed by the generative model, ut uses only a restricted set of features defined over the output buffer and the stack — we consider p(a) as a context insensitive prior distribution. Specifically, we use the following features: 1) the stack embedding dt which encodes the stack of the decoder and is obtained with a stack-LSTM (Dyer et al., 2015, 2016); 2) the output buffer embedding ot; we use a standard LSTM to compose the output buffer and ot is represented as the most recent state of the LSTM; and 3) the parent non-terminal embedding nt which is accessible in the generative model because the RNNG employs a depth-first generation order. Finally, ut is computed as:\nut = W2 tanh(W1[dt,ot,nt] + bd) (4)\nwhere Ws are weight parameters and bd the bias."

However, the decoder alone does not have a bottom-up recognition mechanism for computing the posterior. Thanks to the encoder, we can compute an approximated posterior q(a|x) in linear time and select the parse tree that maximizes this approximation. An alternative is to generate candidate trees by sampling from q(a|x), re-rank them with respect to the joint p(x, a) (which is proportional to the true posterior), and select the sample that maximizes the true posterior.\nLanguage Modeling In language modeling, our goal is to compute the marginal probability p(x) = ∑\na p(x, a), which is typically intractable. To approximate this quantity, we can use Equation (8) to compute a lower bound of the log likelihood log p(x) and then exponentiate it to get a pessimistic approximation of p(x).7\nAnother way of computing p(x) (without lower bounding) would be to use the variational approximation q(a|x) as the proposal distribution as in the importance sampler of Dyer et al. (2016). We discuss details in Appendix A."

This technique has been previously used for topic modeling (Miao et al., 2016) and sentence compression\n7As a reminder, the language modeling objective is exp(NLL/T ), where NLL denotes the total negative log likelihood of the test data and T the token counts.\n(Miao and Blunsom, 2016). Another interpretation of the proposed framework is from the perspective of guided policy search in reinforcement learning (Bachman and Precup, 2015), where a generative parser is trained to imitate the trace of a discriminative parser. Further connections can be drawn with the importance-sampling based inference of Dyer et al. (2016). There, a generative RNNG and a discriminative RNNG are trained separately; during language modeling, the output of the discriminative model serves as the proposal distribution of an importance sampler p(x) = Eq(a|x) p(x,a) q(a|x) . Compared to their work, we unify the generative and discriminative RNNGs in a single framework, and adopt a joint training objective."

      "heading" : "5 Experiments",
      "text" : "We performed experiments on the English Penn Treebank dataset; we used sections 2–21 for training, 24 for validation, and 23 for testing. Following Dyer et al. (2015), we represent each word in three ways: as a learned vector, a pretrained vector, and a POS tag vector. The encoder word embedding is the concatenation of all three vectors while the decoder uses only the first two since we do not consider POS tags in generation. Table 1 presents details on the hyper-parameters we used. To find the MAP parse tree argmaxa p(a, x) (where p(a, x) is used rank the output of q(a|x)) and to compute the language modeling perplexity (where a ∼ q(a|x)), we collect 100 samples from q(a|x), same as Dyer et al. (2016).\nExperimental results for constituency parsing and language modeling are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. As can be seen, the single framework we propose obtains competitive parsing performance. Comparing the two inference\nmethods for parsing, ranking approximated MAP trees from q(a|x) with respect to p(a, x) yields a small improvement, as in Dyer et al. (2016). It is worth noting that our parsing performance lags behind Dyer et al. (2016). We believe this is due to implementation disparities, such as the modeling of the reduce operation. While Dyer et al. (2016) use an LSTM as the syntactic composition function of each subtree, we adopt a rather simple composition function based on embedding averaging, which gains computational efficiency but loses accuracy.\nOn language modeling, our framework achieves lower perplexity compared to Dyer et al. (2016) and baseline models. This gain possibly comes from the joint optimization of both the generative and discriminative components towards a language modeling objective. However, we acknowledge a subtle difference between Dyer et al. (2016) and our approach compared to baseline language models: while the latter incrementally estimate the next word probability, our approach (and Dyer et al. 2016) directly assigns probability to the entire sentence. Overall, the advantage of our framework compared to Dyer et al. (2016) is that it opens an avenue to unsupervised training."

      "heading" : "A Comparison to Importance Sampling",
      "text" : "(Dyer et al., 2016)\nIn this appendix we highlight the connections between importance sampling and variational inference, thereby comparing our method with Dyer et al. (2016).\nConsider a simple directed graphical model with discrete latent variables a (e.g., a is the transition action sequence) and observed variables x (e.g., x is the sentence). The model evidence, or the marginal likelihood p(x) = ∑\na p(x, a) is often intractable to compute. Importance sampling transforms the above quantity into an expectation over a distribution q(a), which is known and easy to sample from:\np(x) = ∑\na\np(x, a) q(a)\nq(a) = Eq(a)w(x, a) (11)\nwhere q(a) is the proposal distribution and w(x, a) = p(x,a) q(a) the importance weight. The proposal distribution can potentially depend on the observations x, i.e., q(a) , q(a|x).\nA challenge with importance sampling lies in choosing a proposal distribution which leads to low variance. As shown in Rubinstein and Kroese (2008), the optimal choice of the proposal distribution is in fact the true posterior p(a|x), in which case the importance weight p(a,x) p(a|x) = p(x) is constant with respect to a. In Dyer et al. (2016), the proposal distribution depends on x, i.e., q(a) , q(a|x), and is computed with a separately-trained, discriminative model. This proposal choice is close to optimal, since in a fully supervised setting a is also observed and the discriminative model can be trained to approximate the true posterior well. We hypothesize that the performance of their importance sampler is dependent on this specific proposal distribution. Besides, their training strategy does not generalize to an unsupervised setting.\nIn comparison, variational inference approach approximates the log marginal likelihood log p(x) with the evidence lower bound. It is a natural choice when one aims to optimize Equation (11)\ndirectly:\nlog p(x) = log ∑\na\np(x, a) q(a)\nq(a)\n≥ Eq(a) log p(x, a)\nq(a)\n(12)\nwhere q(a) is the variational approximation of the true posterior. Again, the variational approximation can potentially depend on the observation x (i.e., q(a) , q(a|x)) and can be computed with a discriminative model. Equation (12) is a well-defined, unsupervised training objective which allows us to jointly optimize generative (i.e., p(x, a)) and discriminative (i.e., q(a|x)) models. To further support the observed variable a, we augment this objective with supervised terms shown in Equation (10), following Kingma et al. (2014) and Miao and Blunsom (2016).\nEquation (12) can be also used to approximate the marginal likelihood p(x) (e.g., in language modeling) with its lower bound. An alternative choice without lower bounding is to use the variational approximation q(a|x) as the proposal distribution in importance sampling (Equation (11)). Ghahramani and Beal (2000) show that this proposal distribution leads to improved results of importance samplers."
