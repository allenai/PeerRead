      "text" : "1 Introduction\nA recognition problem is one of inferring the presence of some entity from some input, typically from ob serving the presence of other entities and the relations between them. We will make the common assumption that high-level recognition is accomplished by select ing an appropriate schema from a schema library. A schema is a generalized internal description of a class of entities in terms of their parts, their properties, and the relations between them. In the schema selection paradigm, to recognize a \"foo\" in the input is to cre ate a schema instance fool of type foo and assign a high degree of belief in the proposition that fool ex ists. (Henceforth we will assign the degree of belief in the existence of a schema instance to the proposi tion that the instance is of the appropriate type, e.g., that fool is of type foo.) In plan recognition, the gen eralized plans are schemas. While the system which we will discuss has been applied to plan recognition in the context of story understanding, we will continue to talk of schema, since we wish to emphasize that our system is applicable to high-level recognition in gen eral.\nA crucial problem faced by schema selection is that of searching the schema library for the right schema; typically a single piece of local evidence is multiply ambiguous as to the schema which it could indicate. For example, an act of getting a rope might fit into many schemas.\nOne of the few concrete suggestions here has been marker passing (Alterman [1985]; Charniak [1983];\nCharniak [1986]; Collins & Quillian (1969]; Hendler [1988]; Norvig [1987a]). Marker-passing uses a breadth-first search to find paths between concepts in an associative network made up of concepts and their part-subpart relations. In our case, the concepts will be schemas, i.e. plans and/ or actions. The idea is that a path between two schemas suggests which schema(s) to consider for recognition. For example, a knob in stance and a hinge instance might suggest a door (in stance); since there are links between the schemas door and knob and between door and hinge in the associa tive network (they are part-subpart relations), there is therefore a path from knob to door to hinge. Unfortu nately, most marker-passer systems have found many more bad paths, suggesting incorrect schemas, than good ones (Charniak (1986]; Norvig [1987b]). We will show in this paper that the good/bad path ratio can be raised quite high by exploiting probability informa tion; we realize this benefit by (cheaply) controlling the marker-passer's search, both extending it in promising directions and terminating it in unpromising ones.\nIn this paper we will give a probabilistic account of marker passing. This account will have two goals - first it should shed further light on when marker passing is an appropriate technique, and second it should show how to improve the performance of marker-passing algorithms by increasing the likelihood that the paths generated will, in fact, suggest the cor rect schema. In section 2 we will consider schema eval uation within a probabilistic framework. That is, given we have a potential schema, how do we evaluate the probability that it is the correct explanation of the in put. In particular, we will be adopting a Bayesian net work (or belief network) formulation of the problem, so the probability distributions correspond to DAGs with probabilities associated with each node. Sec tion 3 will then be concerned with schema selection, i.e., how our marker passing system works, and how the schema suggestions (paths) from the marker-passer map to Bayesian networks. In Section 4 we will show how to use probability information from the knowledge base to intelligently limit the marker-passing search. Specifically, we will describe how to calculate on the fly\n70 Carroll and Charniak\na measure which is an upper bound on the joint proba bility of the schemas which a candidate path suggests. Thanks to properties of the marker-passer paths and our probabilistic model, we can avoid constructing and evaluating a Bayesian network to evaluate each path, an NP-hard problem (Cooper [1987]), so our evalua tion need not be expensive. This section has the bulk of the new work in the paper. We summarize and ex plain results in section 5.\nThe opening sections of this paper alternate some what irregularly between the marker-passer and the Bayesian network; while it might appear to be sim pler to fully describe first one and then the other, this would leave much of what we have to say completely unmotivated and very likely obscure. Once we reach section 4, we treat the two systems together, showing how paths map to Bayesian networks, and how path calculations yield an upper bound on the joint proba bility of the nodes in the Bayesian network.\n2 Probabilistic Schema Evaluation\nWe adopt a standard first-order theory of schema in which a schema is a set and asserting that an entity is an instance of that schema is asserting that it is an element of the set. We use the predicate inst for this purpose.\n(inst instance schema).\nSc�emas are related in the usual isa-hierarchy (subset) as 1n\n(isa specific-schema general-schema).\nIn this paper we assume that isa relations form a tree, not a lattice, and thus all the immediate isa subsets of a given parent are disjoint.\nSlots or roles in schemas are represented using func tions from a schema instance to the slot-filler schema instance. Equality is used to assert that a partic ular entity fills that role. For example, to assert that a particular store store-25 fills the store-of role in supermarket-shopping-3 we assert\n(== (store-of supermarket-shopping-3) store-25) Facts about the relations between the parts of a schema are then universally quantified facts about the corresponding functions. For example, to say that every store-of a supermarket-shopping must be filled with an instance of a supermarket (another schema) we would say\n(inst ?x supermarket-shopping) -+ (inst (store-of ?x) supermarket)\nTo abbreviate this we will write: (role supermarket shopping store-of supermarket). More generally,\n(role schema1 slot schema2)\nstates that anything which fills slot in schema1 must be an instance of schema2• Note that role is not a predicate of our plan recognition language, but is rather an abbreviation for formulas of the above form.\nIn our probabilistic version we will determine the prob ability of a plan by embedding inst and == state ments in a Bayesian network. We will not attempt to summarize Bayesian networks but rather will assume the reader has a working knowledge of them. (See (Pearl [1988]) for a good introduction.) Equality ( ==) statements will become random variables with possi ble values 1 and 0 (true and false). inst statements become random variables which can take any maxi mally specific schema type as their value1. Thus the probability of the statement (inst sms1 supermarket shopping) would become the probability that the in stance sms1 takes on the value supermarket-shopping. However, often we will talk as if the statement (inst sms1 supermarket-shopping) appears in the network (with values 1 and 0). Most of the time the two rep resentations are interchangeable.\nWe intend our prior and conditional probabilities to come from a sample space of explanations for some large corpus of stories. For example, the prior prob ability of a supermarket-shopping plan would be the number of supermarket-shopping plans that appear in our set of explanatory plans, divided by the total num ber of explanatory plans. See (Goldman [1991]) for a detailed description of the probability model.\n3 Probabilistic Schema Selection\n3.1 Marker-Passing\nMarker-passing searches for paths between schemas in a graph whose nodes are schemas and whose arcs are isa and role statements. Marker-passing works as fol lows: the marker-passer is given some schema, derived from a new inst statement, e.g., (inst supermarketl su permarket). It places a mark on that schema, and then proceeds in breadth-first order to place marks on all the neighbors in the graph, their neighbors' neighbors, and so on. For example, our supermar ket schema has two neighbors, supermarket-shopping, which is connected by the statement (role supermarket shopping store-of supermarket) and store-, which is con nected by the statement (isa supermarket store-). Both of these would be marked after supermarket, and then their neighbors would be marked. Each mark has a numeric value, which generally diminishes according to its distance from the original mark (c.f., \"zorch\" in (Charniak [1986])). This value is used to cut off marker-passing, since otherwise we would continue un til the entire graph was covered. For our value, we\n1Thus, the sum over all possible values is 1.0, which would not be true if they could take on non-maximally specific types.\nA Probabilistic Analysis of Marker-Passing Techniques for Plan-Recognition 71\nuse an upper bound on the schemas and relations suggested by the path; we will be precise in section 4. After marking a node, the marker-passer checks for marks from some other origin on the same node. If such a mark is found, both it and the new mark are back-traced to their respective origins, and the re sulting lists of statements are glued together to form a path. For example, suppose we found a mark on supermarket-shopping which had originated at go. We would have as a path:\n(inst supermarket2 supermarket) (role supermarket-shopping store-of supermarket) (isa shopping supermarket-shopping) (role shopping go-step go) (inst go1 go)\nWe include the original inst statements, even though the marker-passer does not, strictly speaking, pass marks over these links. It will be convenient for us to refer to them as part of the path, and they serve to disambiguate this path from other paths which may have the same links but different origins.\nThe marker-passer returns a list of all the paths which it found once the marking has terminated. For more detail on how marker-passing works, see (Hendler [1988]).\n3.2 Valid Paths and Interpretations\nIntuitively, we wish to interpret a path as a claim about how its ends are related to each other. In or der to do this, we need to translate the path through the semantic network (a list of inst, isa, and role state ments) into a set of Bayesian network nodes (inst and equality statements) and arcs. Before we describe this mapping, we must confess that our marker-passing system is not precisely the very sim pie one described above. We employ a DFA at each node in our net work to control the marker-passing, allowing us to re strict the form of paths which we generate and report. This allows us to skip paths which are malformed in the sense that either they cannot be translated into a consistent set of statements in our schema theory, or they embody demonstrably bad schema suggestions. A valid path is one which is not malformed in the above sense.\nNoTATION. By isa- we mean isa with the order of ar guments reversed. So,\n(is a specific-frame general-frame) iff (isa general-frame specific-frame)\nSimilarly for role and role-:\n(role filler-frame filled-frame slot) iff (role- filled-frame filler-frame slot)\nIn future discussions we will often fail to distinguish\nbetween the predicates and their \"-\" versions.\nDEFINITION 3.1. A valid path from it to i2 has the form {lnst it St) (predt St s2) . . . (predn Sn Sn+t) {lnst i2 Sn+t)\nwhere\n• pred; may be one of isa, isa-, role and role-, • at least one role appears among the predi . • no sequence (is a ... )(isa- ... ) appears among the\npred; • if pred; is a role-, then no predk where k > i can\nbe a role\nOur last two restrictions prohibit isa-plateaus, where an isa is followed by an isa-, and slot-filler valleys, where a role- is followed by a role, possibly with isa's between them. We have calculated, off-line, the joint probability of the statements associated with paths which violate the above restrictions; in all cases the joint probability falls below our threshold for being worth computing2•\nWe will now define the statements associated with a path P, written S(P).\nNoTATION. By P[n] we mean the nth statement of a path P.\nThe relevant instance at P[n] (written I(P[n])) is de fined as follows:\nDEFINITION 3.2.\n1. If ( inst i s) = P[n], then I(P[n]) = i. 2.

Similarly for role-.\nIntuitively we wish to interpret a path P as a claim about how its ends are related to each other. \"Every s E S( P) is true\" is intended to be the formalization of\n2To summarize: for isa-plateaus, the left and right side of the Bayesian net in which we embed the statements are independent, so they cannot support one another. For the slot-filler valleys, there is no evidence to support the ob ject which must appear in two schemas. See (Charniak & Carroll [1991]) for details.\nthis claim. For example, the path in Figure 3.1 would have as its S(P) the statements shown in Figure 3.2. We actually need only a subset of S(P), namely the rel evant statements associated with P, (written RS(P)) which we will define below. First we give two more definitions necessary for defining RS(P).\nWe define isa* as\nDEFINITION 3 .4. V t, t' (is a* t t') iff ((is a t t') or 3 t\" ({isa t t\") and (is a* t\" t' )]).\nWe define the relevant type of an inst (written R T( i)) to be the most specific schema type of the node; more formally,\nDEFINITION 3.5. R T( i) = t such that (inst i t) E S(P) and V t' ((inst i t'} E S(P) -> (is a* t t') or t = t' ) .\nWe define the relevant statements associated with P as\nDEFINITION 3.6.\n1. If (inst i t) E S(P) and R T( i) = t then (inst i t) E RS(P). 2. If(== (slo t i) j) E S(P), then(== ( slo t i) j) E RS(P).\nIn effect, we remove superfluous instance statements from S(P), whose statements are stll implied by those retained in RS(P).\nOur formal measure of a path P is defined by embed ding the members of RS(P) in a Bayesian network, and then evaluating the probability that each node is true, given the evidence. In general there may be sev eral paths for the same entities, indicating alternative possible plans. In what follows we will be looking at Bayesian networks in which there is only one RS(P). The idea is that we are interested in getting a prelimi nary guess as to how likely a particular interpretation-\nan RS(P)- is, and we can do this without detailed comparisons with its competitors.\n3.3 Vertebrate Bayesian Networks\nWith each path P we will associate a Bayesian network with a particular structure which will prove important to our calculations. We call such networks ver tebr ate Bayesian networks, because they have spines.\nDEFINITION 3.7. A Bayesian network is a \"ver tebr ate\" Bayesian network iff it consists of two parts, to be de fined below, called the spine, and the interior.\nNoTATION. We use ij to name inst nodes. Recall that equality nodes represent slot-filler relation ships for us.\nNoTATION. We use =j to name equality nodes, indi cating in this case that the parent node i; is the slot filler.\nThere are other types of nodes which act as evidence for our equality and inst nodes. For example, the ap pearance of a word in text provides evidence for the existence of a particular i nst. Although these nodes come in several flavors, we can treat them generically for our purposes, so we will name all of them simply \"evidence\" nodes.\nNOTATION. We use ej to name evidence nodes.\nOur definition describes a structure topologically; thus, we imply that a node subscripted by j is not equal to any node subscripted by k, where k f= j.\nLegal spines are recursively defined as follows:\nDEFINITION 3.8.\nBase step: Any Bayesian network whose node set is {i1, i2, =1, e1, e2} and whose edge set is {i1 -+ e�, i2 -+ e2, i1 -+ ==1, i2 -t =1} is a s pine. See Figure 3.3. Recursion: If S is a spine with the nodes i1 and e 1 and the edge i1 -> e1, then S' is a spine, where\nN(S') = N(S) u { i', =i'} (1)\nA Probabilistic Analysis of Marker-Passing Techniques for Plan-Recognition 73\nand E(S') == {E(S)- {it --+ e1}} U\nSee Figure 3.-f.\nti;·�: .... .. � ....\n·, .... :.;:�1)\ne1 �/ before\n{it -+ i', i' --+ e1, it --+ =i1 1 i' ---+ :=i1}\nafter\nFIG. 3.4. Before and after nodes are added to a spine.\n(2)\nAs for the \"interior\" of a vertebrate Bayesian network, intuitively it is the evidence supporting the equality nodes of the vertebrate Bayesian network. We may assume, without loss of generality that there is only once such evidence node E1• More formally:\nDEFINITION 3.9. If V is a vertebrate Bayesian network with spine S, and S has the non-evidence nodes N and the evidence node& E, then the interior of V is an evidence node E1 disjoint from E and a set of edges D from every equality node in N to E1.\nThe assumption that there will be supporting evi dence, some E1 node, is the crucial one for marker passing. When there is no evidence, the posterior probabilities of the abductive hypotheses generated from our paths turn out to be abysmally low; plainly put, they are bad guesses. In general, we believe that\nCLAIM 3.1. A domain is suitable for search by means of marker-passing only if there will usually be supporting evidence for paths returned by the marker-pas ser.\nWe will support our claim by showing that, in our do main, which meets the evidence condition, we can in crease the ratio of good to bad paths returned from the marker-passer to better than 90%. Our claim should not be interpreted as saying that the marker-passer has no responsibility for the quality of paths it returns; quite the opposite is true. Most of the remainder of this paper will focus on the calculations which allow us to determine whether or not a path is worthwhile, as suming that there is evidence for it. If we could not make these calculations, then doubtless many of the paths which would be returned would in fact fail to have associated evidence. We can safely throw them out because they are bad paths regardless of whether they have evidence.\n3.4 Relating Paths to Networks\nWe will now show that each path corresponds to a unique vertebrate Bayesian network, and that the joint probability of S( P) in the network can be calculated from each step of the path.\nTHEOREM 3.1. If P is a valid path, then there exists a unique vertebrate Bayesian network V such that the statements in RS(P) have formulas in one-to-one cor respondence with the non-evidence nodes of V.\nProof. The proof is by induction on the length of the path.\nThe basis follows from the definition of the simplest spine, and RS( P) for the shortest valid path. The spine and RS(P) have one == node (statement, re spectively) and two inst nodes (statements, respec tively). For the induction step, suppose we have proved there is a unique network for P. Let P' have the same structure as P, with an extra isa statement inserted in some location which does not violate our constraints for path validity. We first note that isa statements do not add statements to RS(P), they only change the schemas named in statements already there. Hence, if we have a vertebrate Bayesian network for P, we can use the same structure (with different relevant types for some nodes) for P'. If P' is P with an extra role statement (again, inserted in some location which respects path validity) , this corresponds to applying clause 2, the recursion step, of the definition of a spine. The role statement adds an === statement and an inst statement to RS(P), and applying clause 2 adds the corresponding nodes to the network. Since each step determines a unique transformation and each transformation results in a unique vertebrate Bayesian network, P corresponds to a unique vertebrate Bayesian network, which we call V(P), or, where unambiguous, just V. D\nFrom the above, it should be obvious that we can construct a vertebrate Bayesian network by sequen tially processing a path from left to right, adding new nodes and arcs for each role statement we come across, and changing the relevant type of our last added node when we encounter an isa-. We will use this fact, together with some distribution properties of verte brate Bayesian networks to calculate our measure of path utility without vertebrate Bayesian network cor responding to the path.\n4 Path Calculations\n4.1 The Spinal Contribution\nOur calculations will not compute the exact joint prob ability of the network which we construct. Instead we will compute an upper bound on the joint probability,\n74 Carroll and Charniak\nFIG. 4.1. The basic vertebrate Bayesian network.\nunder assumptions to be detailed below, which we call the spinal contribution. We will define the spinal con tribution momentarily, in terms of the joint probability of the network. To begin with, the exact joint proba bility of the simplest vertebrate Bayesian network (the basic spine with an added interior evidence node, E1, pictured in Figure 4.1) is\np(e1li1)p(E1I =1)p(eali2)p(il)p(i2)P(=1 li1, i2) p(e11 E1,ea) (3)\nWe use conditional probability and independence to transform the denominator into\n(4)\nFor the numerator, we note that\np(e1lil) = p(ide1)p(el)jp(il) (5)\nand similarly for p(eali2). The slot-filler term, p( =1 li1, i2), requires some discus sion. Recall that role statements specify a particular type for each slot that a schema has. The probability that i1 fills this particular slot in h is the probability that any two things of the specified type are equal. This, in turn, is equal to the prior probability of ·any two things being equal, divided by the prior probabil ity of a thing being the specified type.\nNOTATION. We write p(==) for the prior probability of any two things being equal.\nThis allows us to rewrite the last term in our formula as follows:\n(6)\nApplying the substitutions in equations 4, 5, and 6 to 3, and then cancelling and regrouping yields (p(i1le1)p(i2lea)) (p(==)p(E11 =1)) (7)\np{i1) p(E1Ie1, ea)\nThe right-hand group of terms will appear in the ex act calculations for every vertebrate Bayesian network, with the difference that E1 may be conditioned on more nodes, if they are present. By our earlier as sumptions about the distributions for E1, this group has an upper bound of 1.0.\nThe left-hand group of terms we call the spinal con tribution of our joint probability; more generally, any terms not included in the bounded group, will be part of the spinal contribution, and calculating it will be the focus of the rest of this section. Since those terms not in the spinal contribution have an upper bound of 1.0, the spinal contribution is an upper bound on the joint probability of the network.\n4.2 Calculations\nTHEOREM 4.1. As a path P is traversed, our measure of the spinal contribution of the corresponding vertebrate Bayesian network fragment, SC( V), can be computed recursively in the following manner:\n1. The initial value, corresponding to the (inst i1 s1) node/statement 3 is p(i1 lel), our current belief in the node. 2. As each subsequent statement is traversed, we compute the new value by multiplying the current value by the number given in table 4.1.\nMarker-passing produces whole paths as output; in ternally, however, it builds these from two half-paths which resulted from passing marks from two differing origins (at different times). We would like to use our measure of spinal contribution to cut off the depth of marker-passing, which requires that we compute it as the half-path is built, before the two halves are put together. We now show that this is possible, and that the calculations for an entire path, above, comprise the bulk of the work for computing half-paths. Our lemma concerns the spine, not the entire vertebrate Bayesian network, since the interior evidence node is not part of our spinal contribution.\nDEFINITION 4.1. By cleaving a vertebrate Bayesian net work graph at some inst node n, we mean that\n• the cleaved node n appears in both halves\n'This is a node in the Bayesian network, and a state ment in the path. Since we will be discussing probabilities from now on, we will generally call them nodes.\nA Probabilistic Analysis of Marker-Passing Techniques for P lan-Recognition 75\n• the left half include& the evidence node e1, all inst node& i1 through i,. and all arcs between them, and similarly for the right half • equality node& with both parents among inst node& i1 through i,. and all arc& incident to them are in the left half, and similarly for the right\nSee Figure 4.2.\nLEMMA 4.2. A &pine can be cleaved into two halve& H1 and H 2 at any inst node, &uch that the &pinal contri bution of the whole graph i& given by\nSC( V) = SC(H1) x SC(H2)jp(n) (8)\nwhere n is the node at which the graph is cleaved.\nProof. Omitted due to space limitations. See (Char niak & Carroll [ 1991]) . 0\nLemma 4.2 means that we can track the spinal contri bution incrementally as we extend a half-path. When the measure drops below a threshold, T, we can cut safely cut off marker-passing; that is, we will miss no complete paths whose measure would be above T2• Currently we have T set at 30. We have arrived at this value through experimentation with a set of paths generated from a set of stories which we use for de bugging and tuning our system. Generally, there is a large gap, a factor of 10 or more, between the spinal contribution of those paths which have the right ex planations and those which do not. While our system does rely on the prior probabilities for our schema, this gap suggests that we can get by with priors that are only approximately correct.\n5 Results\nWe have employed our marker-passer in the Wimp3 story understanding system (Goldman [1991]) to find explanatory plans. The results quoted in table 5.1 are those obtained both on Wimp3's debugging cor pus of 25 1-to-4 line \"stories\" and on its evaluation corpus4 of 25 stories. We counted paths at four points in the flow of control. First, we counted paths which left the marker passer. As described above, we in tegrated the probability valuation of paths into the marker-passing mechanism itself, using it to control the spread of marks. This makes it impossible to es timate how many paths were eliminated due to low probability values. Likewise, we cannot say how many paths were eliminated by employing DFA's to prohibit generation of invalid paths. We can only give the to tal number of paths returned, with the invalid and low probability paths already weeded out. Second, we counted paths which were \"asserted\", i.e., used for\n'The debugging corpus is used for testing and tuning of para'?'eters. The evaluation corpus is for evaluation only, and 1s therefore a cleaner test, in some sense.\nforward-chaining and Bayesian network construction. These are paths which passed various secondary filters reported in (Carroll & Charniak [1989]). Third, we counted paths whose resulting statements were actu ally evaluated using our Bayesian network evaluation mechanism. Some paths could be eliminated without evaluation, as we will describe shortly. Finally, we counted those paths which we approved after evalua tion; for a path to be approved the posterior probabil ity of the suggested plans given the evidence had to be 1,000 times higher than the prior probability for the plans. The ratio of approved paths to asserted paths was 68% for the debugging corpus, and 59% for the test corpus, a significant improvement on the 10% good to bad path ratio reported earlier, (Charniak Neat 1986 Norvig 1987 Berkeley ]) and strong support for our claim that the key to the viability of marker-passing is the supporting evidence, our E1. Our analysis suggested one more improvement which could be made. As we commented earlier, the marker passer's probability calculations are an upper bound, based on the assumption that there is evidence in fa vor of the path (other than the nodes at either end). That is, after the marker passer produces an accept able path P, Wimp3 constructs a Bayesian network which includes RS(P). Among the paths which were not approved, we found that there was often no ev idence supporting some of the statements in RS( P). While we cannot determine whether evidence is miss ing before network construction, we can do so before network evaluation. While the former takes time lin ear in the size of the network (making reasonable as sumptions about the process), the latter, in general, takes exponential time (and is NP-hard). Indeed, network evaluation accounts for approximately 90% of Wimp3's running time, and thus the only really bad paths are those which cannot be removed before network evaluation and are not approved afterwards. Weeding out paths with no evidence accounts for the difference between paths which were asserted-used for network construction-and paths which were evaluated. A combined total of 151 paths had to be evaluated by Wimp3, and, of these, all but 9 were good, for a per centage of about 94%. This leads us to extend our claim to say that: A domain is suitable for search by mean& of marker-passing only if there will usually be supporting evidence for paths returned by the marker pa&ser, or paths without evidence can be cheaply iden tified.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work has been supported by the National Science Foundation under grant IRI-8911122 and by the Office of Naval Research, under contract N00014-88-K-0589.\nReferences\nAlterman, Richard.
