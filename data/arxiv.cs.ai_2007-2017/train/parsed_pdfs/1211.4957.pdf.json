We will see that a reasonable number of them is expressible within such computationally efficient language. We expect that, in a long-term view, a temporalization of description logics, and consequently, of OWL(2), can open new perspectives for the inclusion in this language of a greater number of ontologies of the testbed and, hopefully, of the “real world”.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the last years, Semantic Web has increasingly expanded its area of influence. Being an innovative instrument for the retrieval of not expressly stored information and a way of organizing concepts and relations by their meaning, it broadens up plenty of horizons for knowledge representation. Though, only a bunch of experts and researchers know that under a suprisingly vast dimension of new features there lies amathematical and logical structure inside which they fight day by day for the balancing of expressiveness and efficiency. The Description Logics formalisms, which wewill see in Section 1, are the formal bases for the so-calledWeb 3.0, that should allow one to automatically infer (and retrieve) new information from reasoning on “sematicized” knowledge repositories. Some examples of families of logics are described in the following, together with a short coverage of arguments such as RDF graphs and OWL.\nSection 2 introduces the description logic DL<∀π0>, showing notable characteristics of expressive power and polynomial complexity. In the same section, a more detailed description of the analysis, which may be seen as a conceptual experiment, follows. Our purpose is to show that a good number of real-world ontologies may be related to this family of logics. Results are promising enough to spur us to stay on this path and complement it with studies on temporalization of Description Logics and, consequently, of Semantic Web (briefly touched in this report), which we will approach in the near future.\nThe SPARQL query which was specifically created to assess the membership of some real-world ontologies to the aforementioned logic is reported in Appendix A."

      "text" : "Description Logics (DLs) are a family of formalisms for knowledge representation, built on logic-based semantics. They are founded on some fundamental ideas:\n• basic syntactic “blocks” are atomic concepts (1-ary predicates), atomic roles (2-ary predicates) and individuals (costants);\n• the expressiveness of a certain language depends on the use of a set of chosen constructors, that give birth to complex concepts and roles starting from existing ones;\n• bymeans of classification of concepts, a subsumption hierarchy is established, which specifies what concept includes or is included by another;"

      "text" : "• implied knowledge is automatically obtained through a logic procedure, called reasoning, essentially based on the application of inference rules to subsumption between concepts, and an instance definitions between individuals and the latter.\nOn the assumption that a Knowledge Representation System (KR-System) is to give an answer to a user query, reasoning algorithms for DLs should be regarded as decisional procedures which return a positive or negative verdict. This raises the decision problem for such languages. Furthermore, having an answer does not alwaysmean getting it in a reasonable lapse of time, and that compels us to consider also the complexity of algorithms at stake. Decidability and complexity directly depend on the expressive power of the description logic we use: whereas very expressive DLs tend to have inference problems and be computationally hard (or even undecidable), the DLs that are more efficient in reasoning turn out to be not espressive enough to represent all concepts and relations in the domain of interest. Research still going on in the field of DLs just aims at the ability of balancing expressiveness against efficiency, while not dropping semantic precision that could make it applicable to real world situations.\nADescription Logics Knowledge Base (DLKB) is made of two components: TBox (Terminological Box) and ABox (Assertional Box). The former contains the vocabulary, i.e., the definitions of atomic and non-atomic concepts and roles, called axioms, whereas the latter describes individuals in terms of this vocabulary, i.e. it includes the declarations, called assertions, of their instances. By means of the TBox we can name complex descriptions of concepts and roles. The language for such a naming is what distinguishes one DL from another and is based on a model-theoretic semantics. Thus statements in TBox and ABox can be regarded as first-order logic formulas. Reasoning procedures for the terminological part are used to verify the satisfiability of a description (i.e., its noncontradictoriness), or whether it may be subsumed by another (i.e., whether the latter is more general than the former), while those for the assertive part establish whether its set of assertion is consistent (i.e., it has a model or it entails that a certain individual is an instance of a given concept). Satisfiability tests for descriptions and consistency tests for a set of assertion allow one to establish whether the knowledge base is meaningful or not, whereas subsumption tests allow one to maintain a hierarchy of concepts ab universali; finally, instance tests give one the ability of querying the system against single individuals.\nMore formally, a generic DL axiom is a formula of one of the following types:\n• C ≡ D (equivalence between concepts)\n• C ⊑ D (subsumption between concepts)\n• R ≡ S (equivalence between roles)\n• R ⊑ S (subsumption between roles),1\nwhere the symbols C,D are names or expressions of complex concepts, which are formed by 1-ary or 2-ary operations on/between atomic (indicated by A in the following) or complex concepts, while R,S are names or expressions of complex roles which are formed by 1-ary or 2-ary operations on/between atomic (indicated by P in the following) or complex roles.\nA generic DL assertion is a formula of one of the following types:\n• C (a) (concept assertion)\n• R (a, b) (role assertion),\nwhere the symbols a, b are names of individuals, for which the concept C or the roleR holds.2\nFrom a semantical point of view, an interpretation I is a pair (∆I , ·I), where the non-empty set∆I represents the domain of the interpretation and the interpretation function ·I associates a set AI ⊆ ∆I to every atomic concept A , a relation P I ⊆ ∆I × ∆I to every atomic role P , and an element aI ∈ ∆I to every individual a. We write:3\n• I |= (C ≡ D) iff4 CI = DI\n• I |= (C ⊑ D) iff CI ⊆ DI\n• I |= (R ≡ S) iff RI = SI\n• I |= (R ⊑ S) iff RI ⊆ SI\n1The equivalence and subsumption between roles may be indicated also by the symbols= and⊆, respectively. 2A large number of constructs is listed in the table at the end of this section. 3In the following, I |= φmeans “I satisfies φ, where φ can be an axiom or an assertion. A syntax/semantical reference for themain axioms,\nassertions and property declarations is listed in the table at the end of this section. 4“Iff” is short for “if and only if”."

The latter is said to be consistent if there exists at least an interpretation satisfying it, and the search of this interpretation (consistency problem) is just the clue to reasoning."

      "text" : "As already observed, distinct DLs are characterized by the constructs allowed to form complex concepts and roles starting from atomic ones. The names are usually specified by a series of alphabet letters and symbols. In the following, we will not concentrate on formal semantics, but, for the sake of clarity, we will only hint at themeaning of some constructs.\nBy way of an example, we briefly describe the ALC logic (Attributive Language with Complements). Its syntax obeys the following rules:\nC,D → A | ⊤ | ⊥ | ¬C | C ⊓D | C ⊔D | ∀R.C | ∃R.C ,\nwhere ⊤ denotes the concept enclosing any other one (top concept), ⊥ denotes the concept enclosed in any other one (bottom concept), ¬ negates a concept; ⊔ represents the union of concepts (notice the analogy with the corresponding set operators) and⊓ represents the intersectionof concepts. The last two constructs are called respectively universal and existential restriction, and are pivotal in research connected to this report. The concepts that can be built inALC are calledALC -concepts.The axioms and assertions that may be expressed in theALC logic are\nC ≡ D, C ⊑ D, C (a) ,\nwhich indicate, respectively, equivalence and subsumption (also called GCI, General Concept Inclusion) between two concepts, and the membership of a concept. However, reasoning in ALC has a PSPACE-complete computational complexity.\nIn addition to those seen above, the most common constructs for concepts which can be formed in DLs are ≤ 1.R (functional restriction, denoted F , that is equivalent to ∃R.⊤), ≤ nR and ≥ nR (numerical restrictions , N , which enclose the functional one), ≤ nR.C and ≥ nR.C (qualified restrictions, Q , that include the numerical ones), {a} and {a1, . . . , an} (nominals, O ), and ∃R.Self (self-concept). Contructs for roles are often denoted by an operator symbol inside brackets after the name of the logic. They are R− (inverse role, I), R ∪ S,R ∩ S and ¬R (role union, intersection and complement, respectively), R ◦ S (role composition, also used in chain), R+ and R∗ (transitive and reflexive-transitive closure of roles), id (C)(concept identity), and RC|, R|D and RC|D (role restrictions). Sometimes, the symbols U (or ∇, universal role, defining the role which encloses any other one) and N (or △, empty role, defining the role enclosed in any other one) are used. Other kinds of axioms which can be introduced are R ≡ S (equivalence between roles), R ⊑ S (hierarchy between roles, H , denoted also by R ⊆ S), and the relative assertionR (a, b) (role instance). The reflexive, irreflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, transitive, intransitive, disjunctive (two roles having no pair of elements in common), functional and inverse functional properties for roles are denoted by symbols that often differ in literature, but are never ambiguous, e.g. respectively Sym (R) ,Asym (R) ,Refl (R) , Irrefl (R) ,Tr (R) , Intr (R) ,Disj (R) ,Fn (R) , InvFn (R). When transitive property is allowed, we use the symbol S , which corresponds to ALC(+). Sometimes, even small differences among logics (e.g., limitation on the use of atomic rather than complex roles on the right or left part of an assertion) can make a big difference in expressiveness and complexity. Thus, it is not always easy to concisely denote DLs, that consequently constitute an ever-open research field.\nOne ormore among the abovedescripted constructs, axioms and assertions are present in the families of logics that are the base of languages used in ontologies. Among these, an important example is the logic sROIQ(D) (in literature always denoted by SROIQ(D) ), at the bottom of the OWL 2 DL profile, which will be discussed in the following (the letter in parenthesis indicates the use of concrete domains, that will not be discussed here). Its syntax is easily inferred from the symbols, while its complexity is N2EXPTIME-hard.5\n5By the symbol R , we mean that a DL allows complex inclusions of the kindR ◦ S ⊑ R andR ◦ S ⊑ S."

Indeed, contents are still exclusively made up of pages connected by links, whose nontrivial words, together with metadata, are indexed by search engines, by means of which a correspondence between those and the one inserted by users can be found. In this way, notwithstanding the high efficiency and precision of the algorithms involved, such engines constitute a “stupid” example of information retrieval, where the matching between terms, even if advanced, weighs more than their meaning.\nThe change brought by the so-called Semantic Web (SW orWeb 3.0) addresses the main issue that in the Web, as we know it, most of the contents are structured in order to be read by humans, rather than investigated by programs in an automatic way. A computer can jump from page to page by following links, but it does not make any assumption on the semantics of their contents. SW is an extension of “previous”Web that allows one to assign a meaning to information and providesmachineswith the ability to elaborate and “understand”what in the past they could only show. For all this to work, computers should be able to access well-structured information schemas and apply inference rules to permit automatic reasoning, in order to delocalize knowledge representation and spread it over theNet. The languages these rules apply should be expressive enough tomake theWeb capable of “reasoning” in a versatile and widespread way. That is made possibile by tools such as eXstensible Markup Language (XML), Resource Description Framework (RDF ) and the ontologies described by the Ontology Web Language (OWL)."

      "text" : "RDF is a model for representation of information on the Web. The basic idea is that every resource (concept, class, property, object, value, etc.) can be univocally described in terms of simple or identified-by-valueproperties. All this permits to schematize an RDF model by means of an oriented graph, whose nodes represent primitive objects and whose edges denote properties. The limited vocabulary of RDF is extended by RDFS (RDF Schema), which allows one to define classes and properties in a more powerful way. E.g., it is possibile to define a property as a relation by indicating its domain and/or range, or say what class is a subclass of another.\nFrom a data structure point of view, an RDF graph may be seen as a set of triples of type (subject predicate object). For each triple, subject and object are two nodes connected by an edge that represents a predicate; thus, the subject of a triple may be the object of another and viceversa. Each of these nodes may be identified by a URI/IRI, and so it can represent a resource, or it may be simply a “connector” (in this case, it is called a blank node, bnode, or anonymous node). If an object is not a subject of another triple, it may also be a literal, i.e., a datum representing a value in a certain domain.\nOn the representation side, W3C suggests five types of serializations for an RDF graph, themost used of which are RDF/XML (XML language is used) and Turtle (descriptions through lists of triples).7 XML is used because of its precise representation of data. Thus, they can be shared, by means of RDF, among various Web applications while preserving their original meaning."

      "text" : "OWLontologies extend RDFS vocabulary further.8 If RDFS guarantees generality and precision in constructing knowledge representation, withOWLwe reach such an expressiveness that we can “argue” about described information and “extract” more, through reasoning. It provides powerful tools to define classes (that represent concepts), properties (relations among classes) and individuals (their instances), and gives the chance to combine them in logic constraints by means of which necessity and/or sufficiency may be expressed.\nUpon a W3C recommendation, OWL is made up of three sublanguages with increasing expressiveness: OWL Lite, OWL DL and OWL Full. The first two have an almost total correspondence between two peculiar DLs (resp. SHIF (D)and SHOIN (D)).\n9 The last one uses the same subset of OWL DL constructs, but allows them to be unconstrained, according to RDF style. Due to the lack of restrictions on transitive property and to the possibility of handling concepts as individuals (metamodeling), OWL Full turns out to be undecidable and thus, for the correspondence between that and any of the aforesaid DLs, OWL DL is the most expressive decidable sublanguage of OWL.10\nOWL 2 extends OWL by enhancing its features and expressiveness. Apart from a limited number of cases, OWL 2 is perfectly “backward compatible” with the old OWL (which we call OWL 1 to differentiate it from the OWL 2), i.e., all the ontologies of the latter keep the same semantics as that they had before, even if “fed” to a reasoner for OWL 2. Concisely, OWL 2 introduces a simplification into the writing of the most common statements, it permits\n7The serialization of an object is the process which allows one to represent it in an accessible way, in our case a text file. 8Computer science ambitiously draw on the philosophical term ontology to show that the OWL language can describe the world starting from its ultimate constituents and from relations among them. 9OWL-Lite and OWL-DL provide the possibility of defining annotations, which correspondent DLs do not do. In any case, annotations affect neither reasoning, nor complexity, nor decidability. For the sake of precision, OWL-Lite is considered a “syntactic subset” of OWL-DL. 10Obviously, nothing excludes there is another decidable and more expressive−but not studied yet−sublanguage."

Though the former may be syntactically seen as the union of the latter with RDFS, it is semantically compatible with OWL 2 DL(insofar as its semantics allows one to draw all the inferences that can be drawn by using the semantics of OWL 2 DL). Similarly to the analogue sublanguage OWL 1 Full, OWL 2 finds application in the modelling of concepts where reasoning is not required. A new feature of OWL 2 is the use of profiles (i.e., fragments of language) OWL 2 EL, OWL 2 QL and OWL 2 RL:11 the first is useful for applications involving ontologies that contain a great number of classes and/or properties; the second aims at those applications with large volumes of instances, where answering the queries is of primary importance (from which the name QL, Query Language); the last profile is useful in applications not requiring the sacrifice of too much expressiveness to efficiency.

Although it has lots of analogies with SQL, most of which syntactical, it is equipped with a fundamentally different semantics. As query languages for databases essentially work on tables and handle logic conditions to select the rows of these tables that satisfy them, the WHERE clause in SPARQL finds matches between the triples of the query and those of the ontology indicated in the FROM clause. The logic assessments are relegated to the FILTER operator, which possesses a big expressive power, thanks to its several functions, but is rarely used due to the loss of efficiency that its presence may cause.13 The SELECT clause is very similar to that of SQL. It accepts DISTINCT as a keyword and the classical aggregation operators (COUNT, SUM, MIN, AVG and MAX), while the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses are often used (another similarity) to refine the selection. The involved variables are preceded by the symbol ’?’, whereas constants do not have a particular syntax, even if they generally coincide with URI/IRIs of resources present in the ontology one is handling.\nAnalyzing in finer detail the WHERE clause, one can say that the triples tomatch are enclosed in a blockbetween braces and separated by a dot, which implies their intersection. Inside these braces, more sub-blocks may be found, which are useful in making the union (UNION operator) and the difference (MINUS operator) between sets. The matching is valid if the variables having the same names in the clause have the same values in the ontology. There exist some useful shortenings, such as the use of semicolon or colon in place of dot, which act respectively in the following way:\n?s ?p1 ?o1 ; ?p2 ?o2 . shortens ?s ?p1 ?o1 . ?s ?p2 ?o2 .\n?s ?p ?o1 , ?o2 . shortens ?s ?p ?o1 . ?s ?p ?o2 .\nIn addition to selection, one can also have the DESCRIBE, ASK and CONSTRUCT query types, which wewill not review here. The employment of the PREFIX clauses, that precede the real query and indicate the abbreviations for namespaces used inside of it, is quite peculiar.\n11In this way, OWL 1 Lite, OWL 1 DL and OWL 2 DL may be considered profiles of OWL 2. 12The correspondences between namespaces and prefixes are:\nrdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\n13Depending on implementation, the FROM clausemay be implied because software loads in memory the ontology model separately."

If this is not the case, we find a match, according to line 8; otherwise, we must control that neither of the following cases occurs (lines 11-17):18\n– the anonymous node corresponding to a restriction is in the right part of any triple (line 12): that allows one to include all the axioms with the restriction and the various operators (e.g., union, intersection, complement, etc.) which work on lists and single classes in the right part;\n– the above-mentioned node is in the left part of a triple corresponding to an axiom (lines 13-16): that allows one to include single and multiple equivalences and disjunctions.\n• The second clause (lines 19-33) includes the triples corresponding to universal restrictions (line 20). When a triple of this kind is found, in order for amatching to be valid, it is also necessary to check that at least either of the following cases occurs (lines 22-31):\n– the anonymous node corresponding to a restriction is in the right part of a triple (line 23), but this triple is not a subsumption (line 24), nor that node is the domain of a property (line 25);\n16Role domain corresponds to the DLs’ axiom ∃R.⊤ ⊑ C, so it is necessary to verify that C is satisfactorily expressed by the language. 17Cf. footnote 16. 18The second-level MINUS operator could be optimized by including the various triples contained in its clauses after line 8; nonetheless, we must not forget that the matching of triples is a notoriusly not very much efficient operation: the choice of double-nesting concurs to avoid that SPARQL engine performs useless searches when no subsumption in line 10 is found."

Here we proceed (line 36 and lines 39-43) as in the first clause, with the difference (line 37) that the cardinality value must be not greater than 1 too.19\n• The remaining clauses (lines 47-51) check for datatype (lines 47 and 48), qualified cardinality (line 49: the onClass property is peculiar to this kind of restriction), exact and maximum cardinality (lines 50 and 51) triples.\n• For the purpose of accelerating the execution, the use of the LIMIT operator (line 52) reduces the size of results to only one element, which is enough to reject the ontology.\n1 PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22 -rdf -syntax-ns#> 2 PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf -schema#> 3 PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> 4 5 SELECT * 6 WHERE { 7 { 8 ?left owl:someValuesFrom ?class . 9 MINUS {\n10 ?left rdfs:subClassOf ?right . 11 MINUS { 12 { ?s ?p ?left . } UNION 13 { ?left owl:equivalentClass ?right . } UNION 14 { ?left owl:disjointWith ?right . } UNION 15 { ?left owl:members ?right . } UNION 16 { ?left owl:disjointUnionOf ?right . } 17 } 18 } 19 } UNION { 20 ?restr owl:allValuesFrom ?class . 21 { 22 { 23 ?x ?prop ?restr . 24 MINUS { ?x rdfs:subClassOf ?restr . } 25 MINUS { ?x rdfs:domain ?restr . } 26 } UNION { 27 ?restr ?prop ?x . 28 MINUS { ?restr rdf:type ?x . } 29 MINUS { ?restr owl:onProperty ?x . } 30 MINUS { ?restr owl:allValuesFrom ?x . } 31 } 32 } 33 } UNION { 34 ?left owl:minCardinality ?num . 35 MINUS { 36 ?left rdfs:subClassOf ?right . 37 FILTER (?num <=1) . 38 MINUS { 39 { ?s ?p ?left . } UNION 40 { ?left owl:equivalentClass ?right . } UNION 41 { ?left owl:disjointWith ?right . } UNION 42 { ?left owl:members ?right . } UNION 43 { ?left owl:disjointUnionOf ?right . } 44 }\n19Footnote 18 holds also for the nested MINUSes.\nA ANALYSIS OF THE SPARQL QUERY 13\n45 } 46 } UNION 47 { ?s ?p owl:DatatypeProperty . } UNION 48 { ?s ?p rdfs:Datatype . } UNION 49 { ?s owl:onClass ?o . } UNION 50 { ?s owl:cardinality ?o . } UNION 51 { ?s owl:maxCardinality ?o . } 52 } LIMIT 1"
