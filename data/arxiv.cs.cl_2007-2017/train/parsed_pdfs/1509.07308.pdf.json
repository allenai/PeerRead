      "text" : "A huge body of work in distributional semantics and word representation learning almost exclusively revolves around the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954) - an idea which states that similar words occur in similar contexts. All current corpus-based approaches to semantics rely on the contextual evidence in one way or another. Roughly speaking, word representations are typically learned using these two families of distributional context-based models: (1) global matrix factorization models such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Landauer & Dumais, 1997) or generative probabilistic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003), which model the word co-occurrence at the document or paragraph level; or (2) local context window models that represent words as sparse high-dimensional context vectors, and model the word co-occurrence at the level of selected neighboring words (Turney & Pantel, 2010), or generative probabilistic models that learn the probability distribution of a vocabulary word in the context window as a latent variable (Deschacht & Moens, 2009; Deschacht, De Belder, & Moens, 2012).\nOn the other hand, dense real-valued vectors known as distributed representations of words or word embeddings (WEs) (e.g., Bengio, Ducharme, Vincent, & Janvin, 2003; Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mikolov, Chen, Corrado, & Dean, 2013a; Pennington, Socher, & Manning, 2014) have been introduced recently, first as part of neural network based archi-\nc©xxxx AI Access Foundation.

WEs serve as richer and more coherent word representations than the ones obtained by the aforementioned traditional distributional semantic models, with illustrative comparative studies available in the recently published relevant work (e.g., Mikolov, Yih, & Zweig, 2013d; Baroni, Dinu, & Kruszewski, 2014; Levy, Goldberg, & Dagan, 2015).\nA natural extension of interest from monolingual to multilingual word embeddings has occurred recently (e.g., Klementiev, Titov, & Bhattarai, 2012; Hermann & Blunsom, 2014b). When operating in multilingual settings, it is highly desirable to learn embeddings for words denoting similar concepts that are very close in the shared bilingual embedding space (e.g., the representations for the English word school and the Spanish word escuela should be very similar). These BWEs may then be used in a myriad of multilingual natural language processing tasks and beyond, such as fundamental tasks leaning on such bilingual meaning representations, e.g., computing cross-lingual and multilingual semantic word similarity and extracting bilingual word lexicons using the induced bilingual embedding space (see fig. 1). However, all these models critically require sentence-aligned parallel data and readily-available translation dictionaries to induce bilingual word embeddings (BWEs) that are consistent and closely aligned over different languages.\nContributions. To the best of our knowledge, this article presents the first work to showcase that bilingual word embeddings may be induced directly on the basis of comparable data without any additional bilingual resources such as sentence-aligned parallel data or translation dictionaries. The focus is on document-aligned comparable corpora (e.g., Wikipedia articles aligned through inter-wiki links, news texts discussing the same theme).\nOur new bilingual distributed representation learning model makes use of pseudo-bilingual documents constructed by merging the content of two coupled documents from a document pair, where we propose and evaluate two different strategies on how to construct such pseudo-bilingual documents: (1) merge and randomly shuffle strategy which randomly permutes words from both languages in each pseudo-bilingual document, and (2) length-ratio shuffle strategy, a deterministic method that retains monolingual word order while intermingling the words cross-lingually. These additional pre-training shuffling strategies ensure that both source language words and target language words occur in the contexts of each source and target language word. A monolingual model such as skip-gram with negative sampling from the word2vec package (Mikolov, Sutskever, Chen, Corrado, & Dean, 2013c) is then trained on these “shuffled” pseudo-bilingual documents. By this procedure, we steer semantically similar words from different languages towards similar representations in the shared bilingual embedding space, and effectively use available bilingual contexts instead of monolingual ones. The model treats documents as bags-of-words (i.e., it does not include any syntactic information) and does not even rely on any sentence boundary information. In summary, the main contributions of this article are:\n(1) We present the first model that induces bilingual word embeddings directly from document-aligned non-parallel data. We test and evaluate two main variants of the model based on the pre-training shuffling step. (2) We provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the model. We draw analogies and comparisons with prior work on inducing word representations from the same data type: document-aligned comparable corpora (e.g., models relying on the multilingual probabilistic\ntopic modeling framework (MuPTM)). (3) We demonstrate the utility of induced BWEs at the word type level in the task of bilingual lexicon extraction (BLE) from Wikipedia data (Vulić & Moens, 2013b) for three language pairs. A BLE model based on our BWEs significantly outperforms MuPTM-based and context-counting BLE models, and acquires the best reported scores on the benchmarking BLE datasets. (4) We demonstrate the utility of induced BWEs at the word token level in the task of suggesting word translations in context (SWTC) (Vulić & Moens, 2014) for the same three language pairs. A SWTC model based on our BWEs again significantly outscores the best scoring MuPTM-based SWTC models in the same setting without any use of parallel data and translation dictionaries, and again acquires the best reported results on the benchmarking SWTC datasets. (5) We also present a comparison with state-of-the-art BWE induction models (Mikolov, Le, & Sutskever, 2013b; Gouws, Bengio, & Corrado, 2015; Chandar, Lauly, Larochelle, Khapra, Ravindran, Raykar, & Saha, 2014) in BLE and SWTC. Results reveal that our simple yet effective approach is on-par with or outperforms other BWE induction models that rely on parallel data or readily available dictionaries to learn shared bilingual embedding spaces."

      "text" : "The idea of representing words as continuous real-valued vectors dates way back to mid80s (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986; Elman, 1990). The idea met its resurgence a decade ago (Bengio et al., 2003), where a neural language model learns word embeddings as part of a neural network architecture for statistical language modeling. This work inspired other approaches that learn word embeddings within the neural-network language modeling framework (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Collobert, Weston, Bottou, Karlen, Kavukcuoglu, & Kuksa, 2011). Word embeddings are tailored to capture semantics and encode a continuous notion of semantic similarity (as opposed to semantically poorer discrete representations), necessary to share information between words and other text units.\nRecently, the skip-gram and continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model from Mikolov et al. (2013a, 2013c) revealed that the full neural-network structure is not needed at all to learn high-quality word embeddings (with extremely decreased training times compared to the full-fledged neural network models, see Mikolov et al.’s (2013a) work for the full analysis of complexity of the models). These models are in fact simple single-layered architectures, where the objective is to predict a word’s context given the word itself (skip-gram) or predict a word given its context (CBOW). Similar models called vector log-bilinear models were recently proposed (Mnih & Kavukcuoglu, 2013). Other models inspired by skip-gram and CBOW are GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) (Pennington et al., 2014), which combines local and global contexts of a word into a unified model, and a model which relies on dependency-based contexts instead of simpler word-based contexts (Levy &\nGoldberg, 2014a), and new models are steadily emerging (e.g., Lebret & Collobert, 2014; Lu, Wang, Bansal, Gimpel, & Livescu, 2015; Stratos, Collins, & Hsu, 2015; Trask, Gilmore, & Russell, 2015; Liu, Jiang, Wei, Ling, & Hu, 2015).\nAn interesting finding has been discussed recently (Levy & Goldberg, 2014b): the popular skip-gram model with negative sampling (SGNS) (Goldberg & Levy, 2014) is simply a model which implicitly factorizes a word-context matrix, with its cells containing pointwise mutual information (PMI) scores of the respective word and context pairs, shifted by a global constant. In other words, the SGNS performs exactly the same thing as traditional distributional models (i.e., context counting plus context weighting and/or dimensionality reduction), with a slight improvement in performance with SGNS (Baroni et al., 2014; Levy et al., 2015).\nAll these low-dimensional vectors, besides improving computational efficiency, lead to better generalizations, even allowing to generalize over the vocabularies observed in labelled data, and hence partially alleviating the ubiquitous problem of data sparsity. Their utility has been validated and proven in various semantic tasks such as semantic word similarity, synonymy detection or word analogy solving (Mikolov et al., 2013d; Baroni et al., 2014; Pennington et al., 2014). Moreover, word embeddings have been proven to serve as useful unsupervised features for plenty of downstream NLP tasks such as named entity recognition, chunking, semantic role labeling, part-of-speech tagging, or selectional preferences (Turian, Ratinov, & Bengio, 2010; Collobert et al., 2011).\nDue to its simplicity, as well as its efficacy and consequent popularity in various tasks (Mikolov et al., 2013c; Levy & Goldberg, 2014b), with a clear advantage on similarity tasks when compared to traditional models from distributional semantics (Levy et al., 2015) in this article we will focus on the adaptation of the skip-gram model with negative sampling (Mikolov et al., 2013c). In sect. 3, we provide a very brief overview of the model, and then follow up with our new bilingual model which is based on SGNS."

      "text" : "Bilingual word representations could serve as an useful source knowledge for problems in cross-lingual information retrieval (Levow, Oard, & Resnik, 2005; Vulić, De Smet, & Moens, 2013), statistical machine translation (Wu, Wang, & Zong, 2008), document classification (Ni, Sun, Hu, & Chen, 2011; Klementiev et al., 2012; Hermann & Blunsom, 2014b; Chandar et al., 2014; Vulić, De Smet, Tang, & Moens, 2015), bilingual lexicon extraction (Tamura, Watanabe, & Sumita, 2012; Vulić & Moens, 2013a), or knowledge transfer and annotation projection from resource-rich to resource-poor languages for a myriad of NLP tasks (Yarowsky & Ngai, 2001; Padó & Lapata, 2009; Peirsman & Padó, 2010; Das & Petrov, 2011; Täckström, Das, Petrov, McDonald, & Nivre, 2013; Ganchev & Das, 2013; Tiedemann, Agić, & Nivre, 2014). Moreover, by making the transition from monolingual to bilingual settings and building a shared bilingual embedding space (see again fig. 1 for an illustrative example), one is able to extend or rather generalize semantic tasks such as semantic similarity computation, synonymy detection or word analogy computation across languages. Following the success in monolingual settings, a body of recent work on word representation learning has therefore focused on learning bilingual word embeddings (BWEs).\nThe current research on inducing BWEs critically relies on sentence-aligned parallel data or readily available bilingual lexicons to achieve the coherence of representations across languages (e.g., to build similar representations for similar concepts in different languages such as January-januari, dog-hund or sky-hemel). We may cluster the current work in three different groups: (1) the models that rely on hard word alignments obtained from parallel data to constrain the learning of BWEs (Klementiev et al., 2012; Zou, Socher, Cer, & Manning, 2013; Wu, Dong, Hu, Yu, He, Wu, Wang, & Liu, 2014); (2) the models that use the alignment of parallel data at the sentence level (Kočiský, Hermann, & Blunsom, 2014; Hermann & Blunsom, 2014a, 2014b; Chandar et al., 2014; Shi, Liu, Liu, & Sun, 2015; Gouws et al., 2015); (3) the models that critically require readily available bilingual lexicons (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Faruqui & Dyer, 2014; Xiao & Guo, 2014). The main disadvantage of all these models is the limited availability of parallel data and bilingual lexicons, resources which are scarce and/or domain-restricted for plenty of language pairs. In this work, we significantly alleviate the requirements: unlike prior work, we show that BWEs may be induced solely on the basis of document-aligned comparable data without any additional need for parallel data or bilingual lexicons.1"

In order to tackle this issue, recent work relies on the knowledge-lighter framework of multilingual probabilistic topic modeling (MuPTM)\n1. In theory, the work from (Hermann & Blunsom, 2014b; Chandar et al., 2014) may also be extended to the same setting with document-aligned data, as these two models originally rely on sentence embeddings computed as aggregations over their single word embeddings plus sentence alignments. However, some preliminary studies show that these models do not work well in practice after replacing the very strong bilingual signal coded in parallel sentences with the noisy bilingual signal given by document alignments and non-parallel data.\n(Mimno, Wallach, Naradowsky, Smith, & McCallum, 2009; Boyd-Graber & Blei, 2009; De Smet & Moens, 2009; Ni, Sun, Hu, & Chen, 2009; Zhang, Mei, & Zhai, 2010; Fukumasu, Eguchi, & Xing, 2012) or other similar models for latent structure induction (Haghighi, Liang, Berg-Kirkpatrick, & Klein, 2008; Daumé III & Jagarlamudi, 2011).\nWords in this setting are represented as real-valued vectors with conditional topic probability scores P (zk|wi), regardless of their actual language. Topics zk are in fact latent inter-lingual concepts discovered directly from multilingual comparable data using a multilingual topic model such as bilingual LDA. We discuss the MuPTM-based representations in more detail in sect. 3.3.\nMuPTM-based bilingual word representations induced from comparable data have demonstrated its utility in tasks such as cross-lingual semantic similarity computation and bilingual lexicon extraction (Vulić, De Smet, & Moens, 2011; Liu, Duh, & Matsumoto, 2013) and suggesting word translations in context (Vulić & Moens, 2014). In this work, we compare the state-of-the-art MuPTM-based word representations induced from the same type of comparable corpora with BWEs learned by our new model in these two semantic tasks."

      "text" : "Our departure point is the log-linear SGNS from Mikolov et al. (2013c) as implemented in the word2vec package.2 The SGNS model learns word embeddings (WEs) in a similar way to neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert & Weston, 2008), but without a non-linear hidden layer.\nIn the monolingual setting, we assume one language L with vocabulary V , and a corpus of words w ∈ V , along with their contexts c ∈ V c, where V c is the context vocabulary. Contexts for each word wn are typically neighboring words in a context window of size cs (i.e., wn−cs, . . . , wn−1, wn+1, . . . , wn+cs), so effectively it holds V\nc ≡ V .3 Each word type w ∈ V is associated with a vector ~w ∈ Rd (its pivot word representation or pivot word embedding, see fig. 2), and a vector ~wc ∈ Rd (its context embedding). d is the dimensionality of the WE vectors, which, as a model input parameter, has to be set in advance before the training procedure commences. The entries in these vectors are latent, and treated as parameters θ to be learned by the model. In short, the idea of the\n2. https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ 3. Testing other options for context selection such as dependency-based contexts (Levy & Goldberg, 2014a)\nis beyond the scope of this work, and it was shown that these contexts may not lead to any gains in the final WEs (Kiela & Bottou, 2014).\nskip-gram model is to scan through the corpus (which is typically unannotated, Mikolov et al., 2013a) word by word in turn (i.e., these are the pivot words), and learn from the pairs (word, context). The learning goal is to maximize the ability of predicting context words for each pivot word in the corpus. Let ob = 1 denote that the pair (w, v) is observed in the corpus and thus belongs to the training set D. The probability of (w, v) ∈ D is defined by the softmax function:\nP (ob = 1|w, v, θ) = 1 1 + exp(−~w · ~vc)\n(1)\nEach word token w in the corpus is treated in turn as the pivot and all pairs of word tokens (w,w ± 1),...,(w,w ± t(cs)) are appended to D, where t(cs) is an integer sampled from a uniform distribution on {1, . . . , cs}.4 The global training objective J is then to maximize the probabilities that all pairs from D are indeed observed in the corpus:\nJ = arg max θ ∑ (w,v)∈D log 1 1 + exp(−~w · ~vc) (2)\nwhere θ are the parameters of the model, that is, pivot and context word embeddings which have to be learned. One may see that this objective function has a trivial solution by setting ~w = ~vc, and ~w · ~vc = V al, where V al is a large enough number (Goldberg & Levy, 2014). In order to prevent this trivial training scenario, the negative sampling procedure comes into the picture (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013c).\nIn short, the idea behind negative sampling is to present the model with a set D′ of artificially created or sampled “negative pivot-context” pairs (w, v′), which by assumption serve as negative examples, that is, they do not occur as observed/positive (word, context) pairs in the training corpus. The model then has to adjust the parameters θ in such a way to also maximize the probability that these negative pairs will not occur in the corpus. While the interested reader may find further details about the negative sampling procedure, and the new exact objective function along with its derivation elsewhere (Levy & Goldberg, 2014b), for illustrative purposes and simplicity, here we present the approximative objective function with negative sampling by Goldberg and Levy (2014):\nJ = arg max θ ∑ (w,v)∈D log 1 1 + exp(−~w · ~vc) + ∑ (w,v′)∈D′ log 1 1 + exp(~w · ~v′c) (3)\nThe free parameters θ are updated using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation, with learning rate typically controlled by Adagrad (Duchi, Hazan, & Singer, 2011) or with a global linearly decreasing learning rate. By optimizing the objective from eq. (3), the model incrementally pushes observed pivot WEs towards context WEs of their collocates in the corpus. In the words of distributional hypothesis - after training, words that occur in similar contexts should end up having similar word embeddings. In other words, to link the terminology of distributional hypothesis and the modeling assumptions of SGNS - words that predict similar contexts end up having similar word embeddings.\n4. The original skip-gram model utilizes dynamic window sizes, where cs denotes the maximum window size. Moreover, the model takes into account sentence boundaries in context selection, that is, it selects as context words only words occurring in the same sentence as the pivot word."

      "text" : "In the next step, we propose a novel method to extend SGNS to work with bilingual document-aligned comparable data. Let us assume that we possess a document-aligned comparable corpus, defined as C = {d1, d2, . . . , dN} = {(dS1 , dT1 ), (dS2 , dT2 ), . . . , (dSN , dTD)}. dj = (d S j , d T j ) denotes a pair of aligned documents in the source language LS and the target language LT respectively, and N is the number of documents in the corpus. V S and V T are vocabularies associated with languages LS and LT . The goal is to learn a shared bilingual embedding space given the data (fig. 1) and document alignments as the only bilingual signal during training. We present two strategies that, coupled with SGNS, lead to such shared bilingual spaces. An overview of the architecture for learning BWEs from document-aligned comparable data with the two strategies is given in fig. 2(a) and fig. 2(b).\n(1) Merge and Shuffle. In the first step, we merge two documents dSj and d T j\nfrom the aligned document pair dj into a single “pseudo-bilingual” document d ′ j . Following that, we randomly shuffle the newly constructed pseudo-bilingual document. A shuffle is a (random) permutation of the word tokens given in two different languages forming the pseudo-bilingual document. The pre-training shuffling step (see fig. 2(a)) assures that each word w, regardless of its actual language, obtains word collocates from both vocabularies. The idea of obtaining bilingual contexts for each pivot word in each pseudo-bilingual document will steer the final model towards constructing a shared bilingual space. Since the model depends on the alignment at the document level, in order to ensure the bilingual contexts instead of monolingual contexts, it is intuitive to assume that larger window sizes will lead to better bilingual embeddings. We test this hypothesis and the effect of window size in sect. 5.3. In another interpretation, since the model relies only on (pseudo-bilingual) document level co-occurrence, the window size parameter then just controls the amount of random data dropout, that is, the number of positive document-level training examples. The locality of SGNS is not preserved due to the shuffling procedure.\n(2) Length-Ratio Shuffle. The non-deterministic and uncontrollable nature of the merge and shuffle procedure opens up a possibility of accidentally obtaining “bad shuffles” that will result in sub-optimal word representations. Therefore, we also propose a deterministic strategy for building pseudo-bilingual documents suitable for bilingual training. Source and target language words are inserted into an (initially empty) pseudo-bilingual document in turn based on the ratio of document lengths, with word order preserved. Document lengths are measured in terms of word tokens, and let us denote them as mS and mT for an aligned document pair (d S j , d T j ). Let us assume, without loss of generality, that mS ≥ mT . The procedure then proceeds as follows (if mT > mS the procedure proceeds in an analogous manner with the roles of dSj and d T j reversed):\n1. Pseudo-bilingual document d′j is empty: d ′ j = {}. 2. Compute the ratio: R = bmSmT c. 3. Scan through aligned documents dS and dT simultaneously and (3.1) append R word\ntokens from dSj into d ′ j ; then (3.2) append 1 word token from d T j . Repeat steps 3.1 and 3.2 until all word tokens from dTj have been inserted into d ′ j .\n4. Insert remaining mS mod mT word tokens from d S j into d ′ j .\nUsing a simple example, assume that we have an English (EN) document {Frodo, Sam, orcs, goblins,Mordor, ring} and a Spanish (ES) document {anillo, orcos,mago}: the pseudobilingual document would be formed by inserting 1 Spanish word after 2 English words (as the length ratio is 6:3 = 2:1). The final pseudo-bilingual document is: {FrodoEN , SamEN , anilloES , orcsEN , goblinsEN , orcosES ,MordorEN , ringEN ,magoES}.\nIn another interpretation, the length-ratio shuffle strategy constructs a single permutation/shuffle of the pseudo-bilingual document controlled by the word order in two aligned documents as well as their length ratio. As before, the model relies on pseudo-bilingual document level co-occurrence, and the window size parameter controls the amount of (now\nnon-random) data dropout. A difference lies in the fact that this procedure now keeps word order intact monolingually while constructing a pseudo-bilingual document.\nThe final BWE Skip-gram (BWESG) model then relies on the monolingual variant of SGNS (or any other monolingual WE induction model) trained on these shuffled/permuted pseudo-bilingual documents (using strategies (1) or (2)).5 The model learns word embeddings for source and target language words aligned over the d shared embedding dimensions. The BWESG-based representation of word w, regardless of its actual language, is then a d-dimensional vector: ~w = [f1, . . . , fk, . . . , fd]. fk ∈ R denotes the score for the k-th shared inter-lingual feature within the d-dimensional shared bilingual embedding space. Since all words share the embedding space, semantic similarity between words may be computed both monolingually and across languages. We will extensively use this property in our evaluation tasks."

      "text" : "The early approaches (e.g., Dumais, Landauer, & Littman, 1996; Carbonell, Yang, Frederking, Brown, Geng, Lee, Frederking, E, Geng, & Yang, 1997) tried to mine topical structure from document-aligned comparable texts using a monolingual topic model (e.g., LSA or LDA) trained on pseudo-bilingual documents with the target document simply appended to its source language counterpart, and then used the discovered latent topical structure as a shared semantic space in which both words and documents from two languages may be represented in a uniform way.\nMore recent work on multilingual probabilistic topic modeling (MuPTM) (Mimno et al., 2009; De Smet & Moens, 2009; Vulić et al., 2011) showed that word representations of higher quality may be built if a multilingual topic model such as bilingual LDA (BiLDA) is trained jointly on document-aligned comparable corpora by retaining the structure of the corpus intact (i.e., there is no need to construct pseudo-bilingual documents).\nMuPTM discovers the latent structure of the observed data in the form of K latent cross-lingual topics z1, . . . , zK which optimally describe the generation of observed data. Extracting latent cross-lingual topics actually implies learning per-document topic distributions for each document in the corpus (probability scores P (zk|dj)), and discovering language-specific representations of these topics given by per-topic word distributions in each language (probability scores P (wSi |zk) and P (wTi |zk)). Latent cross-lingual topics are in fact distributions over vocabulary words, and have their language-specific representation in each language. Per-document topic distributions and per-topic word distributions are obtained after training the topic model on multilingual data. The representation of some word w ∈ V S (or in an analogous manner w ∈ V T ) is then a K-dimensional vector: ~w = [P (z1|w), . . . , P (zk|w), . . . , P (zK |w)].\nWe call this representation model (RM) Basic-MuPTM. Since the number of topics, that is, the number of vector dimensions K is typically high (Dinu & Lapata, 2010; Vulić et al.,\n5. We were also experimenting with GloVe and CBOW, but they were falling short of SGNS on average.\n2011), additional feature pruning (Reisinger & Mooney, 2010) may be employed in order to retain only the most descriptive dimensions in the MuPTM-based representation, which was shown to improve the performance on several semantic tasks (e.g., BLE or SWTC) (Vulić & Moens, 2013a; Vulić et al., 2015).\nA multilingual topic model is typically trained by Gibbs sampling (Geman & Geman, 1984; Steyvers & Griffiths, 2007; Vulić et al., 2015). Similar to the SGNS/BWESG training procedure, Gibbs sampling for MuPTM/BiLDA also scans the training corpus word by word, and then cyclically updates topic assignments for each word token. However, unlike BWESG which uses only a subset of document-level training examples, Gibbs sampling for MuPTM uses all words from the source language document as well as all words from its coupled target language document to influence the topic assignment for the pivot word. The BWESG design relying on data dropout leads to decreased training times and computation costs to obtain final representations compared to Basic-MuPTM."

Since this approach relies on the MuPTM training plus additional |V S | · |V T | computations to estimate association scores, the cost of obtaining Association-MuPTM representations is even higher than for BasicMuPTM, but it leads to more robust word representations for the BLE task (Vulić & Moens, 2013a). While both Basic-MuPTM and Association-MuPTM produce high-dimensional real-valued vectors with plenty of near-zero dimensions (the number of dimensions is typically measured in thousands) which have to be pruned afterwards with the pruning parameter often set ad-hoc, BWESG produces lower-dimensional dense real-valued vectors, and no additional post-hoc feature pruning is required for BWESG."

      "text" : "Finally, a traditional approach to building bilingual word representations in (cross-lingual) distributional semantics is to compute weighted co-occurrence scores (e.g., using PMI, TFIDF) between pivot words and their context words in a window of predefined size, plus an external bilingual lexicon to align context words/dimensions across languages (Gaussier et al., 2004; Laroche & Langlais, 2010). A weighting function (WeF), which is a standard choice in distributional semantics and yields optimal or near-optimal results over a group of semantic tasks (Bullinaria & Levy, 2007), is the smoothed positive pointwise mutual information statistic (Pantel & Lin, 2002; Turney & Pantel, 2010). Furthermore, in order to induce context words without the need for a readily available lexicon, we employ the bootstrapping procedure from (Peirsman & Padó, 2011; Vulić & Moens, 2013b). This representation model is called Traditional-PPMI. The word representation is an R-dimensional vector: ~w = [sc1(w, c1), . . . , sck(w, ck), . . . , scR(w, cR)]. The dimensions of the vector space\nare R one-to-one word translation pairs ck = (c S k , c T k ), and sck(w, ck) is the weighted cooccurrence score of the pivot word w and the k-th context feature, where one computes the co-occurrence score using cSk if w ∈ V S , or cTk if w ∈ V T .\nVector dimensions ck = (c S k , c T k ) in the Traditional-PPMI representation and similar models with other WeFs are typically the most frequent and reliable translation pairs in the corpus. As opposed to BWESG, the obtained word vectors are again high-dimensional (typically thousands of dimensions) sparse real-valued vectors. In addition, traditionalPPMI is a purely local distributional model deriving distributional context knowledge from narrow context windows (typically 3-10 surrounding words, e.g., Laroche & Langlais, 2010). A bootstrapping approach (Vulić & Moens, 2013b) which we use to induce the TraditionalPPMI representation starts from a seed lexicon of one-to-one translation pairs obtained using some other model (e.g., Basic-MuPTM or Association-MuPTM), and then gradually detects new dimensions of the shared bilingual semantic space. We refer the interested reader to the relevant literature (Vulić & Moens, 2013b) for more details."

      "text" : "Assume now that we have induced bilingual word representations, regardless of the chosen RM. Given two words wi and wj , irrespective to their actual language, we may compute the degree of their semantic similarity by applying a similarity function (SF) on their vector representations −→wi and −→wj : sim(wi, wj) = SF (−→wi,−→wj). Different choices (or rather families of) SFs are cosine, the Kullback-Leibler or the Jensen-Shannon divergence, the Hellinger distance, the Jaccard index, etc. (Lee, 1999; Cha, 2007), and different RMs typically require different SFs to produce optimal or near-optimal results over various semantic tasks. When working with word embeddings, a standard choice for SF is cosine similarity (cos) (Mikolov et al., 2013c), which is also a typical choice in traditional distributional models (Bullinaria & Levy, 2007). The similarity is then computed as follows:\nsim(wi, wj) = cos(wi, wj) = −→wi · −→wj |−→wi| · |−→wj |\n(4)\nOn the other hand, a good choice for SF when working with probabilistic RMs such as Basic-MuPTM and Association-MuPTM RS is the Hellinger distance (Pollard, 2001; Cha, 2007; Kazama, Saeger, Kuroda, Murata, & Torisawa, 2010), which displays excellent results in the BLE task (Vulić & Moens, 2013a). The similarity between words wi and wj using the Hellinger distance is computed as follows:\nsim(wi, wj) = 1√ 2 √√√√ K∑ i=1 (√ P (f ′k|wi)− √ P (f ′k|wj) )2 (5)\nNote that the Hellinger distance is applicable only if word representations are probability distributions, which is the case for Basic-MuPTM and Association-MuPTM. P (f ′k|wi) denotes the probability score for the k-th dimension (f ′k) in the vector representation with Basic-MuPTM or Association-MuPTM.\nFor each word wi, we can build a ranked list RL(wi) which consists of all other words wj ranked according to their respective semantic similarity scores sim(wi, wj). Additionally,\nwe label the ranked list RL(wi) that is pruned at position M as RLM (wi). Since we may retain language labels for words when training in multilingual settings (e.g., language labels are marked by different colors in fig. 2), we may compute: (1) monolingual similarity, e.g., given wi ∈ V S , we retain only wj ∈ V S in the ranked list (analogous for wi ∈ V T ), (2) cross-lingual similarity (CLSS), e.g., given wi ∈ V S , we retain only wj ∈ V T , and (3) multilingual similarity, where we retain all words wj ∈ V S ∪ V T . When computing CLSS for wi, the most similar word cross-lingually is called the cross-lingual nearest neighbor.\nWe will employ the models of context-insensitive CLSS at the word type level to extract bilingual lexicons from comparable document-aligned data, and to compare all representation models in the BLE task from document-aligned comparable texts in sect. 5."

      "heading" : "3.5 Context Sensitive Models of (Cross-Lingual) Semantic Similarity",
      "text" : "Models of semantic similarity briefly discussed in sect. 3.4 provide ranked lists of semantically similar words invariably or in isolation, and they operate at the level of word types. These models do not explicitly encode different senses of words. In practice, it means that, given a sentence “The coach of his team was not satisfied with the game yesterday.”, these context-insensitive models of cross-lingual semantic similarity are not able to detect that the Spanish word entrenador is more similar to the polysemous English word coach in the context of this sentence than the Spanish word autocar, although autocar is listed as the most semantically similar word to coach globally/invariably without any observed context. In another example, while the Spanish words partido, encuentro, cerilla or correspondencia are all highly similar to another ambiguous English word match when observed in isolation, given the Spanish sentence ”She was unable to find a match in her pocket to light up a cigarette.”, it is clear that the strength of cross-lingual semantic similarity should change in context as only cerilla exhibits a strong cross-lingual semantic similarity to match within this particular sentential context.\nThe goal now is to build BWESG-based models of cross-lingual semantic similarity in context, similar to context-aware cross-lingual semantic similarity models proposed in (Vulić & Moens, 2014). Two key questions are: (i) How to provide BWE-based representations beyond word level to represent the context of a word token?; (ii) How to use the contextual knowledge in a context-sensitive model of semantic similarity?\nFollowing Vulić and Moens (2014), given a word token w in context (e.g., a window of words, a sentence, a paragraph, or a document), we build its context set or rather context bag Con(w) = {cw1, . . . , cwr} by harvesting r neighboring words in the chosen context scope (e.g., the context bag may comprise all content-bearing words in the same sentence as the pivot word token, the so-called sentential context). In order to present the context Con(w) in the d-dimensional embedding space, we need to apply a model of semantic composition to learn its d-dimensional vector representation −−−−−→ Con(w).\nFormally, given word w, we may specify the vector representation of the context bag Con(w) as the d-dimensional vector/embedding:\n−−−−−→ Con(w) = −−→cw1 ?−−→cw2 ? . . . ?−−→cwr (6)\nwhere −−→cw1, . . . ,−−→cwr are d-dimensional WEs learned from the data, and ? is a compositional vector operator such as addition, point-wise multiplication, tensor product, etc.\nA plethora of models for semantic composition have been proposed in the relevant literature, differing in their choice of vector operators, input structures and required knowledge (Mitchell & Lapata, 2008; Baroni & Zamparelli, 2010; Rudolph & Giesbrecht, 2010; Socher, Huval, Manning, & Ng, 2012; Blacoe & Lapata, 2012; Clarke, 2012; Hermann & Blunsom, 2014b; Milajevs, Kartsaklis, Sadrzadeh, & Purver, 2014), to name only a few. In this work, driven by the observed linear linguistic regularities in the embedding spaces (Mikolov et al., 2013d), we opt for simple addition (denoted by +) from Mitchell and Lapata (2008) as the compositional operator, due to its simplicity, the ease of applicability on bag-of-words contexts, and its relatively solid performance in various compositional tasks (Mitchell & Lapata, 2008; Milajevs et al., 2014). The d-dimensional embedding −−−−−→ Con(w) is then:\n−−−−−→ Con(w) = −−→cw1 +−−→cw2 + . . .+−−→cwr (7)\nIf we use the BWESG representation model, we may compute the context-sensitive semantic similarity score sim(wi, tj , Con(wi)) between tj and wi given its context Con(wi) in the shared inter-lingual embedding space as follows:\nsim(wi, tj , Con(wi)) = SF ( −→ w′i, −→ tj ) (8)\ntj ∈ V T is any target language word, and −→ tj its word representation, while −→ w′i is the new “contextualized” vector representation for wi modulated by its context Con(wi), that is, its context-aware representation. Vulić and Moens (2014) introduced a linear interpolation of two d-dimensional vectors as a plausible solution for the modulation/contextualization. The modulation of representation for wi is computed as follows:\n−→ w′i = (1− λ) · −→wi + λ · −−−−−→ Con(wi) (9)\nwhere −→wi is the word embedding for wi computed at the word type level, −−−−−→ Con(wi) is the embedding for the context bag computed using eq. (9), and λ is an interpolation parameter. Another set of similar models that can yield context-sensitive similarity computations has been proposed very recently, and has displayed very competitive results regardless of its simplicity (Melamud, Levy, & Dagan, 2015). Here, we present two best scoring contextsensitive models which we adapt to the bilingual setting:\nAdd-Melamud: sim(wi, tj , Con(wi)) = SF (wi, tj) +\n∑ cwi∈Con(wi) SF (cwi, tj)\n|C|+ 1 (10)\nMult-Melamud: sim(wi, tj , Con(wi)) = |C|+1 √ SF (wi, tj) · ∏ cwi∈Con(wi) SF (cwi, tj) (11)\nNote that for the Mult model one has to avoid negative values, so a simple shift to an allpositives interval is required, e.g., the shifted cosine score becomes cos′(x, y) = cos(x,y)+12 . Unlike the models from Vulić and Moens (2014), these two models do not aggregate single word representations into one vector that represents the context, but compute similarity scores separately with each word from the context. For more details regarding the models, we refer the interested reader to the original paper (Melamud et al., 2015).\nWe will employ the models of context-sensitive CLSS at the word token level to compare all representation models in the task of suggesting word translations in context in sect. 6."

All corpora are theme-aligned comparable corpora, that is, the aligned document pairs discuss similar themes, but are in general not direct translations of each other.\nFollowing prior work (Koehn & Knight, 2002; Haghighi et al., 2008; Prochasson & Fung, 2011; Vulić & Moens, 2013b, 2014), we retain only nouns that occur at least 5 times in the corpus. Lemmatized word forms are recorded when available, and original forms otherwise. TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) is used for POS tagging and lemmatization. After the preprocessing steps vocabularies comprise between 7,000 and 13,000 noun types for each language in each language pair. Exactly the same training data and vocabularies are used to train all representation models in comparison.\nTrained BWESG Models. To test the effect of random shuffling in the merge and shuffle BWESG strategy, we have trained the BWESG model with 10 random corpora shuffles for all three training corpora. We also train BWESG with the length-ratio shuffle strategy. All parameters are set to default suggested parameters for SGNS from the word2vec package: stochastic gradient descent with a linearly decreasing global learning rate of 0.025, 25 negative samples, subsampling rate 1e− 4, and 15 epochs.\nWe have varied the number of dimensions d = 100, 200, 300. We have also trained BWESG with d = 40 to be directly comparable to readily available sets of BWEs from prior work (Chandar et al., 2014; Gouws et al., 2015). Moreover, to test the effect of window size on the final results, i.e., the number of positives used for training, we have varied the maximum window size cs from 4 to 60 in steps of 4.7\nWe will make our pre-training and training code for BWESG publicly available, along with all BWESG-based bilingual word embeddings for the three language pairs at: http://liir.cs.kuleuven.be/software.php.\nA Roadmap to Experiments. In the first experiment, we quickly visually inspect the obtained lists of semantically similar words using the BWESG bilingual representation model. Following that, we compare BWESG-based models for bilingual lexicon extraction (BLE) and suggesting word translations in context (SWTC) against baseline models for the two tasks relying on the baseline multilingual representation models discussed in sect. 3.3 as well as against several benchmarking BWE induction models (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Chandar et al., 2014; Gouws et al., 2015). The experiments and results for the BLE task are presented in sect. 5, while the experiments and results for SWTC are presented in sect. 6.\n6.

Since we can build a one-to-one bilingual lexicon by harvesting one-to-one translation pairs, the lexicon qualiy is best reflected in the Acc1 score, that is, the number of source language (ES/IT/NL) words wSi from ground truth translation pairs for which the top ranked word cross-lingually is the correct translation in the other language (EN) according to the ground truth over the total number of ground truth translation pairs (=1000) (Gaussier et al., 2004; Tamura et al., 2012; Vulić & Moens, 2013b).\nModels in Comparison.

      "text" : "Tab. 1 displays top 10 semantically similar words monolingually, across-languages and combined/multilingually for one ES, IT and NL word. The BWESG+cos model is able to find semantically coherent lists of words for all three directions of similarity (i.e., monolingual, cross-lingual, multilingual). In the combined (multilingual) ranked lists, words from both languages are represented as top similar words. This initial qualitative analysis already demonstrates the ability of BWESG to induce a shared bilingual embedding space using only document alignments as bilingual signals.9\nIn another brief analysis, we qualitatively compare the cross-lingual ranked lists acquired by the BWESG+cos model with the other three baseline CLSS/BLE models tailored for document-aligned data. The lists for one ES word and one IT word are presented in tab. 2. For the two example words, BWESG+cos is the only model which is able to rank the actual correct translations as nearest cross-lingual neighbors. It is already symptomatic that the word gulf, which is the correct translation for golfo, does not occur in the ranked list RL10(golfo) at all in case of the three baseline models. We will soon quantitatively confirm this initial suspicion, and demonstrate that the BWESG+cos model is superior to the three baseline models in the BLE task.\nAs an aside, tab. 2 also clearly reveals the difficulty of judging the quality of models for computing semantic similarity/relatedness solely based on the observed output of the models. The lists RL10(cebolla) and RL10(golfo) appear significantly different across all four models, yet all these lists contain words which appear semantically related to the source word. Therefore, we require a more systematic quantitative task-oriented comparison of induced word representations.\n9. We also conducted a small experiment on solving word analogies using monolingual English embedding spaces, and then we repeated the experiment with the same vocabulary and bilingual EnglishSpanish/Italian/Dutch embedding spaces. The results follow the findings from (Faruqui & Dyer, 2014), where only slight (and often insignificant) fluctuations for SGNS vectors were reported (e.g., the fluctuations are < 1% on average in our experiments) when moving from monolingual to bilingual embedding spaces. We may conclude that the linguistic regularities (Mikolov et al., 2013d) established for monolingual embedding spaces induced by SGNS also hold in bilingual embedding spaces induced by BWESG."

      "text" : "Tab. 3 shows the first set of results on the BLE task: we report scores with two different BWESG strategies as well as with a BWESG model which does not shuffle pseudo-bilingual documents. The previous best reported Acc1 scores with baseline representations for the same training+test combination are also reported in the table. By zooming into the table multiple times, we summarize the most important findings.\nBWESG vs Baseline Representations. The results clearly reveal the superior performance of the BWESG-cos model for BLE which relies on our new framework for inducing bilingual word embeddings from document-aligned comparable data over other BLE models relying on previously used bilingual word representations from the same type of training data. The increase in Acc1 scores over the best scoring baseline models is 22.2% for ES-EN, 7% for IT-EN and 67.5% for NL-EN.\nBWESG Shuffling Strategy. Although both BWESG strategies display results that are above established baselines, there is a clear advantage to the length-ratio shuffle strategy, which displays a solid and robust performance across a variety of parameters and all three language pairs. Another advantage of that strategy is the fact that it has a deterministic outcome and does not suffer from “sub-optimal” random shuffles. In summary, we suggest using the length-ratio shuffle strategy in future work, and along the same line we opt for that strategy in all further experiments.\nThe results also reveal that shuffling is universally useful, as BWESG without shuffling relies largely on monolingual contexts and cannot reach the performance of BWESG with shuffling. A partial remedy for the problem is to train BWESG with more documentlevel training pairs (i.e., by increasing the window size), but that leads to prohibitively expensive models, and nonetheless BWESG without shuffling with larger cs-s still falls short of BWESG with both shuffling strategies (see also fig. 3(a)-3(c)).\nWindow Size: Number of Training Pairs. The results confirm the intuition that larger window sizes, i.e., more training examples lead to better results in the BLE task. For\nall embedding dimensions d-s, BWESG+cos exhibits a superior performance for cs = 48 than for cs = 16, and the performance with cs = 48 and cs = 60 seems relatively stable: intuitively, more training pairs leads to a slightly better BLE performance, but the curve slowly flattens out (fig. 3(a)-3(c)). This finding reveals that even a coarse tuning of these parameters might lead to optimal or near-optimal scores for BLE with BWESG+cos.\nDifferences across Language Pairs. A lower increase in Acc1 scores for IT-EN is attributed to the fact that the test set for IT-EN comprises IT words with occurrence frequen-\ncies above 200 in the training data (Vulić & Moens, 2013a), while the other two test sets comprise randomly sampled words covering all frequency spectra. As expected, all models in comparison are able to effectively utilize distributional signals for higher-frequency words, but BWESG+cos still displays the best performance, and these improvements in Acc1 scores are statistically significant (using McNemar’s statistical significance test, p < 0.05).\nFurther, the lowest overall scores for all models in comparison are observed for NL-EN. We attribute it to using less training data for NL-EN when compared to ES-EN and IT-EN (i.e., training corpora for ES-EN and IT-EN are almost triple the size of training corpora for NL-EN). However, we observe that the increase obtained by BWESG+cos is even more prominent in this setting with limited training data. The lower results of TPPMI+cos compared to other two baseline models are also attributed to the overall lower quality and size of NL-EN training data, which is then reflected in a lower quality of seed lexicons necessary to start the bootstrapping procedure from Vulić and Moens (2013b).\nComputational Complexity. BWESG trained with larger values for d and cs yields richer semantic representations, but also naturally leads to increased training times. However, due to a lightweight design of the supporting SGNS, the times are by the order of magnitude lower than the training times for Basic-MuPTM or Association-MuPTM. Typically, several hours are needed to train BWESG with d = 300 and cs ≈ 48− 60, whereas it takes two to three days to train a bilingual topic model with K = 2000 on the same training set using the multi-threaded architectures on 8 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 2.90GHz processors."

      "text" : "All further experiments are conducted using BWESG with the length-ratio shuffle strategy.\nAnother BWE induction that can be used in this setting with document-aligned data is the well known model from Mikolov et al. (2013b): First, two monolingual embedding spaces are induced separately in each of the two languages using a standard monolingual WE model such as SGNS. The bilingual signal is provided in the form of readily available one-to-one word translation pairs. Training is then cast as a multivariate regression problem, which implies learning a function that maps the source language vectors from the training data to their corresponding target language vectors. A standard approach (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Dinu, Lazaridou, & Baroni, 2015) is to assume a linear map.\nWe train two monolingual SGNS models on monolingual parts of our document-aligned training sets with the same parameters as with BWESG, and use the same set of translation pairs as for the TPPMI model in previous experiments to learn the mapping. Therefore, this model uses exactly the same data sources as all other models compared in sect. 5.3.2. The results with the Mikolov et al.’s model are summarized in tab. 4: a comparison with the results from tab. 3 reveals a clear and prominent advantage for the BWESG model given the same data and training setup.\nAlthough the focus of this article is on the specific multilingual data type: documentaligned comparable data, we also test how well our simple and cheap yet effective BWESG framework fares against other state-of-the-art BWE induction models which also induce shared bilingual embedding spaces, but rely on stronger bilingual signals for training (i.e., parallel data, translation pairs): We compare against two benchmarking BWE induction models that rely on parallel data (Chandar et al., 2014; Gouws et al., 2015). We use a set\nof pre-trained 40-dimensional word embeddings for Spanish-English from Chandar et al. (2014) which are available online.10 We also train 40-dimensional embeddings from Gouws et al.

The results clearly reveal that, although both other BWE models critically rely on parallel Europarl data for training, and Gouws et al. (2015) in addition train on entire monolingual Wikipedias in both languages, our simple BWE induction model trained on much smaller amounts of document-aligned non-parallel data produces significantly higher BLI scores for IT-EN and ES-EN with sufficiently large windows. However, the results for NL-EN with all BLI models from comparable data from tab. 3 are significantly lower than with the Gouws BWEs.

For each polysemous noun, the test sets provide 24 sentences extracted from Wikipedia which illustrate different senses and translations of the pivot polysemous noun, accompanied by the annotated correct translation for each sentence. It yields 360 test sentences for each language pair (and 1080 test sentences in total). An additional set of 100 IT sentences (5 other polysemous IT nouns plus 20 sentences for each noun) is used as a development set to tune the parameter λ (see sect. 3.5) for all language pairs and all models in comparison. In summary, the final aim may be formulated as follows: For each polysemous word wi in ES/IT/NL, the goal is to suggest its correct translation in English given its sentential context.\nEvaluation Metrics. Since the task is to present a list of possible translations to a SWTC model, and then let the model decide a single most likely translation given the word and its sentential context, we measure the performance again as Top 1 accuracy (Acc1).\nModels in Comparison. We have again tested various families of SFs (Lee, 1999; Cha, 2007) for each baseline word representation, and have opted for the best scoring SF for each representation. These are the SWTC models in comparison: (1) BWESG+add. RM: BWESG. SF: cosine similarity. Composition: addition. λ = 1.0. The value for λ suggests that only context is used to disambiguate the meaning of a polysemous word and to guess its most likely translation in context.12 (2) BMu+HD+S. RM: BasicMuPTM. SF: Hellinger distance. Composition: SmoothedFusion model from (Vulić & Moens, 2014). λ = 0.9. (3) BMu+Cue+S. RM: BasicMuPTM. SF: Cue or Association measure (Steyvers & Grif-\n12. We have also experimented with the context-sensitive CLSS models proposed by Melamud et al. (2015), but we do not report the actual scores as this model, although displaying a similar relative ranking of different representation models, was consistently outperformed by the models from (Vulić & Moens, 2014) in our evaluation runs: ≈0.75-0.80 vs ≈ 0.60-0.65 for the models from Melamud et al. (2015).\nfiths, 2007; Vulić & Moens, 2013a). Composition: Smoothed-Fusion. λ = 0.9. The Cue similarity is tailored for probabilistic models and computed as the association score P (ti|w′i) = ∑K k=1 P (ti|zk)P (zk|w′i), where zk denotes k-th latent feature, and P (zk|w′i) denotes the modulated probability score obtained by smoothing the probabilistic representations of wi and its context Con(wi) (see the paper from Vulić and Moens (2014) for a more detailed description). (4) TPPMI+add. RM: Traditional-PPMI. SF: cosine similarity. Composition: addition. λ = 0.9. We have also experimented with pair-wise multiplication for composition, but these models have not displayed any improvements over TPPMI+add.\nAgain, all parameters of the baseline representation models are adopted directly from prior work (Vulić & Moens, 2014) where they were optimized on the same training and test sets. In addition, BMu+HD+S and BMu+Cue+S also rely on the procedure of context sorting and pruning (Vulić & Moens, 2014), where the idea is to retain only context words which are most semantically similar to the given pivot polysemous word, and then use them in computations. The procedure, however, produces significant gains only for probabilistic models (BMu+HD+S and BMu+Cue+S), and therefore, we employ it only for these models. BMu+HD+S and BMu+Cue+S with context sorting and pruning were the best scoring models in the introductory SWTC paper (Vulić & Moens, 2014) and currently produce state-of-the-art SWTC results on these test sets.13"

      "text" : "As for BLE, we first investigate whether our BWESG model yields bilingual word representations which lead to better SWTC models. Tab. 6 summarizes the results on the SWTC task. NO-CONTEXT refers to the context-insensitive majority baseline (i.e., always choosing the most semantically similar translation candidate obtained by BWESG+cos at the word type level, without taking into account any context information). BWESG vs Baseline Representations. The results reveal that BWESG outperforms baseline bilingual word representations also in the SWTC task. The improvements are prominent for all reported values of parameters d and cs, and are often statistically significant even when compared to the strongest baseline (which is the fine-tuned BMu+Cue+S model with context sorting and pruning for all three language pairs from Vulić and Moens (2014)). The increase in Acc1 scores over the strongest baseline is 12.9% for ES-EN, 11.9% for IT-EN, and 12.4% for NL-EN. The obtained results surpass previous state-of-the-art scores and are currently the best reported results on the SWTC datasets when using nonparallel data to learn semantic representations. BWESG Shuffling Strategy. Although BWESG without shuffling (due to a reduced complexity of the SWTC task compared to BLE) already displays encouraging results, there is again a clear advantage to the length-ratio shuffle strategy, which displays an excellent performance for all three language pairs. In simple words, shuffling is again useful. Dimensionality and Number of Training Pairs. Unlike in the BLE task, the highest Acc1 scores on average are obtained by using lower-dimensional word embeddings (i.e.,\n13. We omit results for the Association-MuPTM RM since SWTC models based on Association-MuPTM were consistently outperformed by SWTC models based on Basic-MuPTM across different settings.\nd = 100, similar or even higher results with d = 40, see tab. 9). The phenomenon may be attributed to the effect of semantic composition and the reduced complexity of the SWTC task compared to the BLE task. First, although enlarging the dimensionality of embeddings leads to an increased semantic expressiveness within the shared bilingual embedding space, it may be harmful when working with composition models, since the simple additive model of semantic composition may produce more erroneous dimensions when constructing higher-dimensional context embeddings out of single word embeddings. Second, due to its design, the SWTC task requires coarser-grained representations than BLE. While in the BLE task the goal is to detect a translation of a word from a vocabulary which typically spans (tens of) thousands of words, in the SWTC task the goal is to detect the most likely translation of a word given its sentential context, but from a small closed vocabulary of 2-4 possible translations from the translation inventory. Therefore, it is highly likely that even low-dimensional embeddings are sufficient to produce plausible rankings for the SWTC task, while at the same time, they are not sufficient and expressive enough to find correct translations in BLE. More training pairs (i.e., larger windows) still yield better results on average in the SWTC task. In summary, the choice of representation granularity is dependent on the actual task, which consequently leads to the conclusion that optimal values for d and cs are largely task-specific (compare also results in tab. 3 and tab. 6).\nTesting Polysemy. In order to test whether the gain in performance for BWESG+add is derived mostly from the effective handling of the easiest set of words, that is, bisemous words (polysemous words with only 2 translation candidates), we have performed an additional experiment, where we have measured Acc1 scores separately for words with 2, 3, and 4 different senses. Results indicate that the performance gain comes mostly from gains on trisemous and tetrasemous words, while the scores on bisemous words are comparable. Tab. 7 shows Acc1 over different clusters of words for ES-EN, and similar scoring patterns are observed for IT-EN and NL-EN. Differences across Language Pairs. Due to the reduced complexity of SWTC, we may also observe relatively higher results for NL-EN when compared to ES-EN and IT-EN, as opposed to their relative performance in the BLE task, where the scores for NL-EN are much lower than scores for ES-EN and IT-EN. Since SWTC is a less difficult task which requires coarse-grained representations, even limited amounts of training data may be sufficient to learn word embeddings which are useful for the specific task. This finding is in line with the recent work from Gouws and Søgaard (2015)."

      "text" : "We again test other BWE induction models in the SWTC task, using the same training setup and sets of embeddings as introduced in sect. 5.3.3 for the BLE task. The representations were now plugged in a variety of context-sensitive CLSS models from sect. 3.5, and the optimization of parameters for SWTC has been conducted in the same manner as for BWESG. The results for the BWE induction model from Mikolov et al. (2013b) are summarized in tab. 8, while the results with the other two models (Chandar et al., 2014; Gouws et al., 2015) are provided in tab. 9.\nBWESG outperforms other BWE induction models in the SWTC task and further confirms its utility in cross-lingual semantic modeling. The model from Mikolov et al. (2013b) constitutes a stronger baseline: Good results in the SWTC task with this model are an interesting finding per se. While the model is not competitive with BWESG and other baseline representations models from document-aligned data in a more difficult BLE task when using noisy one-to-one translation pairs, its performance on the less complex SWTC task with a reduced search space is solid even when the model relies on the imperfect set of translation pairs to learn the mapping between two monolingual embedding spaces."

      "text" : "By analyzing the influence of pre-training shuffling on the results in two different evaluation tasks, we may safely establish its utility when inducing bilingual word embeddings using the BWESG model. While we have already presented two shuffling strategies in this work, one line of future work will investigate different possibilities of “blending in” words from two different vocabularies into pseudo-bilingual documents in a more structured and systematic manner. For instance, one approach to generating pseudo-training sentences for learning from textual and perceptual modalities has been recently introduced (Hill & Korhonen, 2014). However, it is not straightforward how to extend this approach to the generation of pseudo-bilingual training documents.\nAnother idea in the same vein is to build artificial training data of higher-quality starting from noisy comparable data by: (1) computing semantically similar words monolingually and across-languages from the noisy data, (2) retaining only highly reliable pairs of similar words using an automatic selection procedure (Vulić & Moens, 2012), (3) building pseudobilingual documents using only reliable context word pairs. In other words, the questions is: Is it possible to choose positive training pairs more systematically to reduce the noise stemming from non-parallel data? The construction of such artificial training data and training on such data would then proceed in a bootstrapping fashion, and the model should be able to steadily reduce noise inherently present in comparable data. The idea of “improving corpus comparability” was only touched upon in previous work (Li & Gaussier, 2010; Li, Gaussier, & Aizawa, 2011).\nWhile the entire framework proposed in this article is in theory completely language pair agnostic as it does not make any language pair dependent modeling assumptions, we acknowledge the fact that all three language pairs comprise languages coming from the same phylum, that is, the Indo-European language family. Future extensions also include porting the framework to other more distant language pairs that do not share the same roots nor the same alphabet (e.g., English-Chinese/Hindi/Arabic), and for which benchmarking test sets are still scarce for a variety of semantic tasks (e.g., SWTC) (Camacho-Collados, Pilehvar, & Navigli, 2015)."

      "heading" : "7. Conclusions and Future Work",
      "text" : "We have proposed and described Bilingual Word Embeddings Skip-Gram (BWESG), a simple yet effective bilingual word representation learning model which is able to induce bilingual word embeddings solely on the basis of document-aligned comparable data. BWESG is based on the omnipresent skip-gram with negative sampling (SGNS). We have presented\ntwo ways to build pseudo-bilingual documents on which a monolingual SGNS (or any monolingual WE induction model) may be trained to produce shared bilingual embedding spaces. The BWESG model does not make any language-pair dependent assumptions nor requires language-pair specific external resources such as bilingual lexicons, predefined category/ontology knowledge or parallel data.\nWe have employed induced BWEs in two semantic tasks: (1) bilingual lexicon extraction (BLE), and (2) suggesting word translations in context (SWTC). Our new BWESG-based BLE and SWTC models outperform previous state-of-the-art models for BLE and SWTC from document-aligned comparable data and related BWE induction models (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Chandar et al., 2014; Gouws et al., 2015). The findings in this article follow the recently published surveys from Baroni et al. (2014), Levy et al. (2015) regarding a solid and robust performance of neural word representations/word embeddings in semantic tasks: our new BWESG-based models for BLE and SWTC significantly outscore previous state-of-theart distributional approaches on both tasks across different parameter settings. Even more encouraging is the fact that these new state-of-the-art results are attained using default parameter settings for the BWESG model as suggested in the word2vec package without any development set. Further (finer) tuning of model parameters in future work may lead to higher-quality bilingual embedding spaces.\nSeveral straightforward lines of future research have already been tackled in sect. 5 and sect. 6. For instance, the current length-ratio shuffling strategy may be replaced by a more advanced shuffling method in future work. Moreover, BWEs induced by BWESG may be used in other semantic tasks besides the ones discussed in this work, and it would be interesting to experiment with other types of context aggregation and selection beyond the bag-of-words assumption, such as dependency-based contexts (Levy & Goldberg, 2014a), or other objective functions during training in the same vein as proposed by Levy and Goldberg (2014b). Similar to the evolution in multilingual probabilistic topic modeling, another path of future work may lead to investigating bilingual models for learning BWEs which will be able to jointly learn from separate documents in aligned document pairs, without the need to construct pseudo-bilingual documents.\nA natural step in the text representation learning research is to extend the focus from single word representations to composite phrase, sentence and document representations (Hermann & Blunsom, 2013; Kalchbrenner, Grefenstette, & Blunsom, 2014; Le & Mikolov, 2014; Soyer, Stenetorp, & Aizawa, 2015). In this article, we have relied on a simple composition model based on vector addition, and have shown that this model performs excellent in the SWTC task. However, in the long run this model is not by any means sufficient to effectively capture all complex compositional phenomena in the data. Several models which aim to learn sentence and document embeddings have been proposed recently, but they critically rely on sentence-aligned parallel data. It is yet to be seen how to build structured multilingual phrase, sentence and document embeddings solely on the basis of comparable data. Such low-cost multilingual embeddings beyond the word level extracted from comparable data may find its application in a variety of tasks such as statistical machine translation (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Zou et al., 2013; Zhang, Liu, Li, Zhou, & Zong, 2014; Wu et al., 2014), semantic tasks such as multilingual semantic textual similarity (Agirre, Banea, Cardie, Cer, Diab, Gonzalez-Agirre, Guo, Mihalcea, Rigau, & Wiebe, 2014), cross-lingual\ninformation retrieval (Vulić et al., 2013; Vulić & Moens, 2015) or cross-lingual document classification (Klementiev et al., 2012; Hermann & Blunsom, 2014b; Chandar et al., 2014).\nIn another future research path, we may use the knowledge of BWEs obtained by BWESG from document-aligned data to learn bilingual correspondences (e.g., word translation pairs or lists of semantically similar words across languages) which may in turn be used for learning from large unaligned multilingual datasets (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Al-Rfou, Perozzi, & Skiena, 2013). In the long run, this idea may lead to large-scale learning models from huge amounts of multilingual data without any requirement for parallel data or manually built bilingual lexicons."

    "abstractText" : "We propose a new model for learning bilingual word representations from non-parallel document-aligned data. Following the recent advances in word representation learning, our model learns dense real-valued word vectors, that is, bilingual word embeddings (BWEs). Unlike prior work on inducing BWEs which heavily relied on parallel sentence-aligned corpora and/or readily available translation resources such as dictionaries, the article reveals that BWEs may be learned solely on the basis of document-aligned comparable data without any additional lexical resources nor syntactic information. We present a comparison of our approach with previous state-of-the-art models for learning bilingual word representations from comparable data that rely on the framework of multilingual probabilistic topic modeling (MuPTM), as well as with distributional local context-counting models. We demonstrate the utility of the induced BWEs in two semantic tasks: (1) bilingual lexicon extraction, (2) suggesting word translations in context for polysemous words. Our simple yet effective BWE-based models significantly outperform the MuPTM-based and contextcounting representation models from comparable data as well as prior BWE-based models, and acquire the best reported results on both tasks for all three tested language pairs.",
