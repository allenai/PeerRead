      "text" : "Most existing semantic parsing efforts employ a CKY-style bottom-up parsing strategy to generate a meaning representation in simply typed lambda calculus Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005); Lu and Ng (2011) or its variants Wong and Mooney (2007); Liang et al. (2011). Although these works led to fairly accurate semantic parsers, there are two major drawbacks: efficiency and expressiveness.\nFirst, as many researches in syntactic parsing Nivre (2008); Zhang and Clark (2011) have shown, compared to cubic-time CKY-style parsing, incremental parsing can achieve comparable accuracies while being linear-time, which means orders of magnitude faster in practice. We therefore introduce the first incremental parsing algorithm for semantic parsing. More interestingly, unlike syntactic parsing, our incremental semantic parsing algorithm, being strictly type-driven, directly employs type checking to automatically determine the direction of function application on-the-fly, thus reducing the search space and eliminating the need for a syntactic grammar such as CCG which explicitly encodes the direction of function application.\nHowever, to fully exploit the power of type-driven incremental parsing, we need a more sophisticated type system than simply typed lambda calculus. We argue that it is beneficial to incorporate an explicit subtype hierarchy, such that ambiguous terms can be grounded based on context in a more explicit and declarative fashion. Compare the following two phrases:\n(1) the mayor of New York?\n(2) the capital of New York?\nIf we know that mayor is a function from city to person, then the first New York can only be of type city; similarly knowing capital maps states to cities disambiguates the second New York to be of type state. This can not be done using a simple type system with just entities and booleans.\nNow let us consider a more complex question which will be our running example in this paper:\n(3) What is the capital of the largest state by area?\nar X\niv :1\n41 1.\n53 79\nv3 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n1 6\nD ec\n2 01\n4\nSince we know capital takes a state as input, we expect the largest state by area to return a state. But does largest always return a state type? Notice that it is polymorphic, for example, largest city by population, or largest lake by perimeter. So there is no unique type for largest: its return type should depend on the type of its first argument (city, state, or lake). This observation motivates us to introduce the powerful mechanism of parametric polymorphism from programming languages into the type system for natural language. For example, we can define the type of largest to be a template\nlargest : ('a→t)→('a→i)→'a\nwhere 'a is a type variable that can match any type (for formal details see Section 3). Just like in functional programming languages such as ML or Haskell, type variables can be bound to a real type (or a range of types) during function application, using the technique of type inference. In the above example, when largest is applied to city, we know that type variable 'a is bound to type city (or its subtype), so that largest would eventually return a city.\nWe make the following contributions:\n• We design a linear-time incremental semantic parsing algorithm (Section 2), which is much more efficient than the majority of existing semantic parsers that are cubic-time CKY-based.\n• In line with classical Montague theory Heim and Kratzer (1998), our parser is type-driven parsing instead of syntax-driven as in CCG-based efforts Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005); Kwiatkowski et al. (2011); Krishnamurthy and Mitchell (2014) (Section 2.3).\n• We introduce parametric polymorphism into natural language semantics (Section 3), along with proper treatment of subtype polymorphism, and implement Hindley-Milner style type inference (Pierce, 2005, Chap. 10) during parsing (Section 3.2).1\n• We adapt the latent-variable max-violation perceptron training from machine translation Yu et al. (2013), which is a perfect fit for semantic parsing due to its huge search space (Section 4).\nExperiments on GEOQUERY, JOBS and ATIS domains show close to state-of-the-art performances, and demonstrate the advantage of a powerful type system."

Steps 5–6 and 10 are skip actions and thus omitted. The stack and queue in each row are the results after each action.\nThe simply typed lambda calculus Heim and Kratzer (1998); Lu and Ng (2011) augments the system with types, including base types (entities e, truth values t, or numbers i), and function types (e.g., e→t). So function capital is of type e→e, state is of type e→t, and size is of type e→i. The argmax function is of type (e→t)→(e→i)→e.2 The simply typed MR is now written as\n(capital :e→e (argmax :(e→t)→(e→i)→e state :e→t size :e→i)))."

      "text" : "We use the above running example to explain our type-driven incremental semantic parsing algorithm. Figure 1 (a) illustrates the full derivation.\nSimilar to a standard shift-reduce parser, we maintain a stack and a queue. The queue contains words to be parsed, while the stack contains subexpressions of the final MR, where each subexpression is a valid typed lambda expression. At each step, the parser choose to shift or reduce, but unlike standard shift-reduce parser, there is also a third possible action, skip, which skips a semantically vacuous word (e.g., “the”, “of”, “is”, etc.). For example, the first three words of the example question “What is the ...” are all skipped (steps 1–3 in Figure 1 (a)).\nThe parser then shifts the next word, “capital”, from the queue to the stack. But unlike incremental syntactic parsing where the word itself is moved onto the stack, here we need to find a grounded\n2Note that the type notation is always curried, i.e., we represent a binary function as a unary function that returns another unary function. Also the type notation is always right-associative, so (e→t)→((e→i)→e) is also written as (e→t)→(e→i)→e.\npredicate in the GeoQuery domain for the current word. In this example we find the predicate:\ncapital :e→e\nand put it on the stack (step 4). Next, words “of the” are skipped (steps 5–6). Then for word “largest”, we shift the predicate\nargmax : (e→t)→(e→i)→e\nonto the stack (step 7), which becomes\ncapital :e→e argmax : (e→t)→(e→i)→e.\nAt this step we have two expressions on the stack and we could attempt to reduce. But type checking fails because for left reduce, argmax expects an argument (its “domain” function) of type (e→t) which is different from capital’s type (e→e), so is the case for right reduce.\nSo we have to shift again. This time for word “state” we shift the predicate\nstate :e→t\nonto the stack, which becomes:\ncapital :e→e argmax : (e→t)→(e→i)→e state :e→t."

      "heading" : "2.3 Type-Driven Reduce",
      "text" : "At this step we can finally perform a reduce action, since the top two expressions on the stack pass the type-checking for rightward function application (a partial application): argmax expects an (e→t) argument, which is exactly the type of state. So we conduct a right-reduce, applying argmax on state, and the resulting expression is:\n(argmax state) : (e→i)→e\nwhile the stack becomes (step 9)\ncapital :e→e (argmax state) : (e→i)→e\nNow if we want to continue reduction, it does not type check for either left or right reduction, so we have to shift again.\nSo we move on to shift the final word “area” with the grounded predicate in GeoQuery database:\nsize :e→i\nand the stack becomes (step 11):\ncapital :e→e (argmax state) : (e→i)→e size :e→i.\nNow apparently we can do a right reduce supported by type checking (step 12):\ncapital :e→e (argmax state size) :e\nfollowed by another, final, right reduce (step 13):\n(capital (argmax state size)) :e.\nHere we can see the novelty of our shift-reduce parser: its decisions are largely driven by the type system. When we attempt a reduce, at most one of the two reduce actions (left, right) is possible thanks to type checking, and when neither is allowed, we have to shift (or skip). This observation suggests\nthat our incremental parser is more deterministic than those syntactic incremental parsers whose each step always faces a three-way decision (shift, left-reduce, right-reduce). We also note that this typechecking mechanism, inspired by the classical type-driven theory in linguistics Heim and Kratzer (1998), eliminates the need for an explicit encoding of direction as in CCG, which makes our formalism much simpler than the synchronous syntactic-semantic ones in most other semantic parsing efforts Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005, 2007); Wong and Mooney (2007).\nAs a side note, besides function application, reduce also occurs when the top two expressions on the stack can be combined to represent a more specific meaning, which we call union.\nFor example, when parsing the phrase “major city”, we have the top two expressions on the stack\nmajor :e→t city :e→t\nWe can combine the two expressions using predicate and since their types match, and get\nλx :e . (and : t→t→t (major :e→t x) (city :e→t x)),\nwhere type t→t→t takes two booleans and return one (again, using currying notation)."

Furthermore, currently function capital can apply to any entity type, for example capital(boston), which should have been disallowed by the type checker. So we need a more sophisticated type system that helps ground terms to real-world entities, and this refined type system will in turn help type-driven parsing."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.1 Augmenting MR with Subtyping",
      "text" : "We first augment the meaning representation with a type hierarchy which is domain specific. For example Figure 2 shows a (slightly simplified) version of the type hierarchy for GEOQUERY domain. Here the root type top has a subtype of locations, lo, which consists of two different kinds of locations, administrative units (au) including states (st) and cities (ct), and nature units (nu) including rivers (rv) and lakes (lk). We use <: to denote the (transitive, reflexive, and antisymmetric) subtyping relation between types; for example in GEOQUERY we have st <: lo, rv <: nu, and T <: top for any type T.\nIn addition we have an integer type i derived from the root type top. The boolean type t does not belong to the type hierarchy, because it does not represent the semantics from the task domain.\nEach constant in the GEOQUERY domain is well typed. For example, there are states (mississippi:st), cities (boston:ct), rivers (mississippi:rv), and lakes (tahoe:lk). Note that the names like mississippi appears twice for two different entities. The fact that we can distinguish them by type is a crucial advantage of a typed semantic formalism.\nSimilarly each predicate is also typed. For example, we can query the length of a river, len:rv→i, or the population of some administrative unit, population:au→i. Notice that population(·) can be applied to both states and cities, since they are subtypes of administrative unit, i.e., st <: au and ct <: au. This is because, as in Java and C++, a function that expects a type T argument can always take an argument of another type S which is a subtype of T. More formally:\ne2 : S S <: T\n(λx :T . e1) e2→ [x 7→ e2]e1 , (4)\nwhere [x 7→ e2]e1 means substituting all occurrences of variable x in expression e1 with expression e2. For example, we can query whether two locations are adjacent, using next_to:lo→(lo→t), and similarly the next_to(·, ·) function can be applied to two states, or to a river and a city, etc.\nThe above type system works smoothly for first-order functions (i.e., predicates taking atomic type arguments), but the situation with higher-order functions (i.e., predicates that take functions as input) is more involved. What is the type of argmax? One possibility is to define it to be as general as possible, as in the simply typed version (and many conventional semantic parsers):\nargmax : (top→t)→(top→i)→top.\nBut this actually no longer works for our sophisticated type system for the following reason. Intuitively, remember that capital:st→ct is now a function that takes a state as input, so the return type of argmax must be a state or its subtype, rather than top which is a supertype of st. But we can not simply replace top by st, since argmax can also be applied in other scenarios such as “the largest city” or “the longest river”. In other words, argmax is a polymorphic function, and to assign a correct type for it we have to introduce type variables (widely used in functional programming languages such as Haskell and ML, and also in C++ templates). We define\nargmax : ('a→t)→('a→i)→'a\nwhere the type variable 'a is a place-holder for “any type”. Before we move on, there is an important consequence of polymorphism worth mentioning here. For the types of unary predicates such as city(·) and state(·) that characterize its argument, we define theirs argument types to be the required type, i.e., city : ct→t, and state : st→t. This might look a little weird since everything in the domain of those functions are always mapped to true; i.e., f(x) is either undefined or true, and never false for such f ’s. This is different from classical simply-typed Montague semantics Heim and Kratzer (1998) which defines such predicates as type top→t so that city(mississippi : st) returns false. The reason for our design is, again, due to subtyping and polymorphism: capital takes a state type as input, so argmax must returns a state, and therefore its first argument, the state function, must have type st→t so that the matched type variable 'a will be bound to st. This more refined design will also help prune unnecessary argument matching using type checking."

Luckily, there is a rule about function types in type theory that exactly fits here:\nA <: B\nB→C <: A→C (5)\nwhich states the input side is reversed (contravariant). This might look counterintuitive at the first glance, but the intuition is that, it is safe to allow the function size of type lo→i to be used in the context where another type st→i is expected, since in that context the argument passed to size will be state type (st), which is a subtype of location type (lo) that size expects, which in turn will not surprise size.

In our type-driven incremental semantic parsing task, the spurious ambiguity is caused by how the expression templates are chosen and grounded during the shift step, and the different reduce orders that lead to the same result. We treat this unknown information as latent variable.\nMore formally, we denote D(x) to be the set of all partial and full parsing derivations for an input sentence x, and mr(d) to be the MR yielded by a full derivation d. Then we define the sets of (partial and full) reference derivations as:\ngood i(x, y) ∆ = {d ∈ D(x) | |d| = i,∃full derivation d′ s.t.\nd is a prefix of d′,mr(d′) = y},\nThose “bad” partial and full derivations that do not lead to the annotated MR can be defined as:\nbad i(x, y) ∆ = {d ∈ D(x) | d 6∈ good i(x, y), |d| = i}.\nAt step i, the best reference partial derivation is\nd+i (x, y) ∆ = argmax\nd∈goodi(x,y) w ·Φ(x, d), (6)\nwhile the Viterbi partial derivation is\nd−i (x, y) ∆ = argmax\nd∈badi(x,y) w ·Φ(x, d), (7)\nwhere Φ(x, d) is the defined feature set for derivation d.

Second, our parser, being type-driven instead of syntax-driven, uses type-checking to decide the direction of reduction, which eliminates the need for a syntactic grammar such as CCG. Third, to fully exploit the power of type-driven semantic parsing beyond simple types (such as entities and truth values), we borrow from programming language theory the concepts of subtype polymorphism and parametric polymorphism to enrich the type system in order to better guide the parsing. Our system learns very accurate parses in GEOQUERY, JOBS and ATIS domains.",
