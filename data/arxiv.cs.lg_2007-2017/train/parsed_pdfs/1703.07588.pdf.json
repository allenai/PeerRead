      "text" : "Deep learning has achieved great success in many areas [1][2][3]. For problems related to sequential data such as audio, video and text, significant improvements have been achieved by Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (GRNN), in which the hidden neurons form a directed cycle suitable for processing sequential data [4][5][6][7]. In addition to taking the neural network outputs to be used in the target applications, internal signals within the neural networks were also found useful. A good example is the bottleneck features [8][9].\nOn the other hand, in the era of big data, huge quantities of unlabeled speech data are available but difficult to annotate, and unsupervised approaches to effectively extract useful information out of such unlabeled data are highly attractive [10][11]. Autoencoder structures have been used for extracting bottleneck features [12], while GRNN with various structures can be learned very well without labeled data. As one example, the outputs of GRNN learned in an unsupervised fashion have been shown to carry phoneme boundary information and used in phoneme segmentation [13][14].\nIn this paper, we try to analyze the gate activation signals (GAS) in GRNN, which are internal signals within such networks. We found such signals have temporal structures highly related to the phoneme boundaries, which was further verified by phoneme segmentation experiments."

      "text" : "Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are neural networks whose hidden neurons form a directed cycle. Given a sequence x = (x1, x2, ..., xT ), RNN updates its hidden state ht at time index t according to the current input xt and the previous hidden state ht−1. Gated recurrent neural networks (GRNN) achieved better performance than RNN by introducing gates in the units to control the information flow. Two popularly used gated units are LSTM and GRU [15][16].\nThe signals within an LSTM recurrent unit are formulated as:\nft = σ(Wfxt + Ufht−1 + bf ) (1)\nit = σ(Wixt + Uiht−1 + bi) (2)\nc̃t = tanh(Wcxt + Ucht−1 + bc) (3)\nct = ftct−1 + itc̃t (4)\not = σ(Woxt + Uoht−1 + bo) (5)\nht = ottanh(ct) (6)\nwhere ft, it, ot, ct, c̃t and ht are the signals over the forget gate, input gate, output gate, cell state, candidate cell state and hidden state at time t, respectively; σ(·) and tanh(·) are the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activation functions respectively; W? and U? are the weight matrices and b? are the biases.\nThe GRU modulates the information flow inside the unit without a memory cell,\nht = (1− zt)ht−1 + zth̃t (7)\nzt = σ(Wzxt + Uzht−1 + bz) (8)\nh̃t = tanh(Whxt + Uh(rt ht−1) + bh) (9)\nrt = σ(Wrxt + Urht−1 + br) (10)\nwhere zt, rt, ht and h̃t are the signals over the update gate, reset gate, hidden state and candidate hidden state at time t, respectively; means element-wise product [17].\nHere we wish to analyze the gate activations computed in equations (1), (2), (5), (8), (10) [18] and consider their temporal structures. For a GRNN layer consisting of J gated units, we view the activations for a specific gate at time step t as a vector gt with dimensionality J , called gate activation signals (GAS). Here gt can be ht, it, ot, zt or rt above. Figure 1 is the schematic plot showing how GAS may imply for a gate in an gated unit.\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n07 58\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.S D\n] 3\n1 A\nug 2\n01 7"

We can have an autoencoder with GRNN as in Figure 2 called AEGRNN here. Given an input utterance represented by its acoustic feature sequence {x1, x2, ..., xT }, at each time step t, AEGRNN takes the input vector xt, and produces the output x̂t, the reconstruction of xt. Due to the recurrent structure, to generate x̂t, AE-GRNN actually considers all information up to xt in the sequence, x1, x2, ..., xt, or x̂t = AE-GRNN(x1, x2, ..., xt). The loss function L of AE-GRNN in (11) is the averaged squared `-2 norm for the reconstruction error of xt.\nL = N∑ n Tn∑ t 1 d ‖xnt − AE-GRNN(xn1 , xn2 , ..., xnt )‖2 (11)\nwhere the superscript n indicates the n-th training utterance with length Tn, andN is the number of utterances used in training. d indicates the number of dimensions of xnt ."

We train models on the training utterances, and perform analysis on the testing ones.\nIn the AE-GRNN tested, both the encoder and the decoder consisted of a recurrent layer and a feed-forward layer. The recurrent layers consisted of 32 recurrent units, while the feedforward layers consisted of 64 neurons. We used ReLU as the activation function for the feed-forward layers [20]. The dropout rate was set to be 0.3 [21]. The networks were trained with Adam [22]. The acoustic features used were the MFCCs of 39-dim with utterance-wise cepstral mean and variance normalization (CMVN) applied."

The upper three subfigures (a)(b)(c) are for LSTM gates, while the lower two (d)(e) for GRU gates. The temporal variations of GRU gates are similar to the forget gate of LSTM to some degree, and looks like the negative of the input gate of LSTM except for a level shift. More importantly, when compared with the phoneme boundaries shown as the blue dashed lines, a very strong correlation can be found. In other words, whenever the signal switches from a phoneme to the next across the phoneme boundary, the changes in signal characteristics are reflected in the gate activation signals. This is consistent to the previous finding that the sudden bursts of gate activations indicated that there were boundaries of phonemes in a speech synthesis task [23]."

We can then compute the difference GAS as the following:\n∆ḡt = ḡt+1 − ḡt (12)\nThe difference GAS can also be evaluated for each individual gated unit for each dimension of the vector gt,\n∆ḡjt = ḡ j t+1 − ḡ j t (13)\nwhere gjt is the j-th component of the vector gt. We plotted the difference GAS and the individual difference GAS for the first 8 units in a GRNN over the frame index for an example utterance as in Figure 4. We see those differences bear even stronger correlation with phoneme boundaries shown by vertical dashed\nlines. All these results are consistent with the finding that the gate activations of forget gate over recurrent LSTM units in the same layer have close correlation with phoneme boundaries in speech synthesis [23], although here the experiments were performed with AE-GRNN."

In our preliminary experiments, a periodic predictor which predicted a boundary for every 40 ms gave F1-score 71.07 with precision 55.13 and recall 99.99, which didn’t look reasonable. It has been shown that a better evaluation metric is the R-value [24], which properly penalized the over segmentation phenomenon. The approach proposed in a previous work [25] achieved an r-value 76.0, while the 40-ms periodic predictor only achieved 30.53. Therefore, we chose to use R-value on the performance measure."

      "heading" : "5.2. Comparison among different gates",
      "text" : "The R-values using different gates of LSTM and GRU are shown in Table 1. The results for LSTM gates are consistent with the findings in the previous works [23][26]. In LSTM, the forget gate clearly captures the temporal structure most related to phoneme boundaries. GRU outperformed LSTM which is also consistent with earlier results [17][26]. The highest Rvalue is obtained with the update gate of GRU. The update gate in GRU is similar to the forget gate in LSTM. Both of them control whether the memory units should be overwritten. Interestingly, the reset gate of GRU achieved an R-value significantly higher than the corresponding input gate in LSTM. The reason is probably the location of reset gate. In GRU, the reset gate does not control the amount of the candidate hidden state independently, but shares some information of the update gate, thus has better access to more temporal information for phoneme segmentation [17]. The update gate in GRU was used for extracting GAS in the following experiments."

      "heading" : "5.3. Comparison among different approaches",
      "text" : "In Table 2, we compared the R-value obtained from the temporal information provided by RPM, without or with its GAS (rows (a)(b)(c)(d)). The best result in Table 1 is in row(e), which was obtained with update gates of GRU in AE-GRNN. We considered two structures of RPM: the same as AE-GRNN (4 layers) or only use the encoder part (2 layers, a feed-forward layer plus a recurrent layer). The latter used the same number\nof parameters as AE-GRNN. We also tested the conventional approach of using hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) as shown in row (f) [27][28]. We further added a white noise with 6dB SNR to the original TIMIT corpus (the right column). The last row (g) is for the periodic predictor predicted a boundary every 80 ms, serving as a naive baseline. Precision-Recall curves in Figure 6 illustrate the overall performance on clean TIMIT corpus with different thresholds.\nWe found that the RPM performance was improved by the interpolation with GAS (RPM+GAS v.s. RPM). Larger improvements were gained when data became noisy. We further analyzed the segmentation results on clean corpus with the highest R-values of 2-layered RPM and AE-GRNN. We analyzed the results of AE-GRNN by observing ∆ḡt and ∆ḡjt . Likewise, we analyzed the results of RPM by observing Et and Ejt , where E j t indicates the squared prediction error in the jth dimension computed in (15). We showed their relations in Figure 5. We see that the curve of Et is smooth and significantly different from the sharp curve of ∆ḡt. The smoothness led RPM to suffer from over segmentation. The smoothness was caused by the fact that there were always a subset of Ejt which were significantly large. On the other hand, the curves of ∆ḡjt are more consistent. The consistency enables curve of ∆ḡt to be sharp and thus AE-GRNN would not suffer from over segmentation. This explains why GAS are helpful here.\nAlso, we can see RPM alone didn’t benefit much from adding more layers (rows (c) v.s. (a)). Providing if RPM is powerful enough to predict next frames better, there will be no\nerror signals and thus no temporal information. This side effect balanced the advantage of increased model size. Interestingly, not only GAS offered improvements (rows (b) v.s. (a) and rows (d) v.s. (c)), but with more layers, the interpolation with GAS achieved larger improvements (rows (d) v,s, (b)). The best performances in both clean and noisy corpora are achieved by 4-layered RPM with GAS. Last but not least, performance of approaches using GAS and HAC are more robust to noise."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusions",
      "text" : "We show that the gate activation signals (GAS) obtained in an unsupervised fashion have temporal structures highly correlated with the phoneme changes in the signals, and this correlation was verified in the experiments for phoneme segmentation. Also, our experiments also showed that GAS bring improvements to RPM without additional parameters. Like bottleneck features, GAS are obtained from the element of neural networks, instead of networks’ outputs, and both of them are shown to bring improvements. With the promising results of GAS shown in the paper, we hope GAS can brought the same improvements as the ones brought by bottleneck features."
