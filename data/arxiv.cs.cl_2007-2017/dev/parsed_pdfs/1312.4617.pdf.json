      "text" : "attention. This is attributed to the affordability of accessing social network sites such as Twitter, Google+, Facebook and other social network sites through the internet and the web 2.0 technologies. Many people are becoming interested in and relying on the SM for information and opinion of other users on diverse subject matters. It is important to translate sentiment expressed by SM users to useful information using data mining techniques [39]. This underscores the importance of data mining techniques on SM. Data mining techniques are capable of handling the three dominant research issues with SM data which are size, noise and dynamism. This paper reviews data mining techniques currently in use on analysing SM and looked at other data mining techniques that can be considered in the field.\nKeywords: Social Media, Social Media Analysis, Data Mining\n1. Introduction\nSocial Media (SM) is a group of Internet-based applications that improved on the concept and technology of Web 2.0, and enable the formation and exchange of User Generated Content [38]. SM sites can also be referred to as web-based services that allow individuals to create a public/semi-public profile within a domain such that they can communicatively connect with a list of other users within the network [11]. SM is an important source of learning of opinions, sentiments, subjectivity, assessments, approaches, evaluation, influences, observations, feelings, borne out in text, reviews, blogs, discussions, news, remarks, reactions, or some other documents [51]. Before the advent of SM, the homepages was popularly used in the late 1990s which made it possible for average internet users to share information. However, the activities on today’s SM seem to have transformed the World Wide Web into its intended original creation. SM platforms enable rapid information exchange between users regardless of the location. SM can be referred to as network of human interaction where communication and relationships form nodes and edges [4]; the nodes include entities and the relationships between them make up the edges. Many organisations, individuals and even government of countries follow the activities on SM in order to obtain knowledge on how their audience reacts to postings that concerns them. SM permits the effective collection of large scale data and this gives rise to major computational challenges. Nevertheless the efficient mining of the information retrieved from these large scale data helps to discover valuable knowledge of paramount importance in different fields like marketing, banking, government and defence. Again effectively mined SM data can be used as decision support tool by different entities that make use of SM contents for different purposes.\nSM sites are commonly known for information dissemination, opinion/sentiment expression, and product reviews. News alerts, breaking\nnews, political debates and government policy are also discussed and analysed on SM sites. However, while some opinions on SM assist users and other entities to make useful decisions, some are mere assertions and therefore misleading [45]. Users’ opinions/sentiments on SM such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Yahoo are basically positive, negative or neutral (neutral being commonly regarded as no opinion expressed). Online opinions can be discovered using traditional methods but this is conversely inadequate considering the large volume of information generated on all SM sites as present in Fig.1. Reviews of works in SM analysis in as well as sentiment analysis on SM are discussed in section 2.\n2. Literature Review\nAccording to Technorati, about 75,000 new blogs and 1.2 million new posts giving opinion on products and services are generated every day [41]. Massive data are generated every minute on different common SM sites as revealed in Fig.2 [71]. The enormous data constantly collected on these sites make it difficult for traditional methods like the use of field agents, clipping services and ad hoc research to handle SM data [62]. In view of the foregoing, it is necessary to employ tools capable of analysing SM especially the expression of opinions/sentiments which are main characteristics of SM. Data mining techniques has shown to be capable of mining big data generated on SM sites. This is made possible by way of extracting information from large data set generated on SM and transforming them into understandable structure for further use. This has buttress the relevance of data mining techniques in analysing SM data.\nFig.2. Estimated Data Generated on SM Site Every Minute http://mashable.com/2012/06/22/data-created-every-minute/\nIn recent decades several works in data mining have been devoted to the SM [16], [61], [5], [21]. Different data mining techniques are currently used in analysing opinions/sentiments expressed on SM [4], [61]. Data mining algorithms have been used to analyse opinion/sentiments expressed on different SM sites. Research revealed that Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy were majorly considered among other data mining techniques available when analysing opinion/sentiment in SM [19], [58]. Authors of [19] used k-nearest neighbours, Bayesian networks and Decision tree in their experiment on favourability analysis which according to the authors is similar to sentiment analysis. In our recent experiment [1] we use Association Rule Mining (ARM) to analyse hashtags present in tweets on same topic over consecutive time periods t and t+1. We also use Rule Matching (RM) to detected changes in rule patterns such as `emerging', `unexpected', `new' and `dead' rules in tweets at t and t +1. We coined this proposed method Transaction-based Rule Change Mining (TRCM). Finally, we linked all the detected rules to real life situations such as events and news reports.\nThe rest of this review paper is organised as follows. Section 3 examines the SM background. Section 4 enumerates the research issues and challenges facing data mining techniques in sentiment analysis in SM. In Section 5 we present sentiment analysis tools. In Section 6 different data mining techniques in sentiment analysis are discussed. Section 7 lists data mining techniques currently used in sentiment analysis. The review is concluded in section 8 with a summary and pointers to future work.\n3. Social Media Background\nIn the last decade SM have become not only popular but also affordable and universal communication means which has thrived in making the world a global village. SM play an active role in publicising how people feel about certain products/services, issues and events in many aspects of life. This can be said to be as a result of the affordability of accessing the social network sites through the internet and the advances in web 2.0 technologies.\nMore people are becoming interested in and relying on the SM for information, breaking news and other diverse subject matters. Users find out what other people’s views are about certain product/service, film, school, or even more major issues like seeking other people’s opinion on political candidates in national election poll [61]. Millions of people access SM sites such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and MySpace to search out for information, breaking news and news updates. Most of the updates are often posted by unfamiliar people they have never and may never have contact with. Consequently information gathered on SM is sometimes used to make valuable decisions. While some groups are retrieving information from SM sites, others are posting information for the use of other internet users [61]. The amounts of data transmitted on the SM are very large and this makes the networks very noisy. Also data sent via SM are very rapid and require data mining techniques to mine them for accuracy and timeliness.\nSM has bestowed an unimaginable power on its user by way of expressing their views and sentiments on SM sites, be it positive or negative [4], [61]. Organizations are now conscious of the significance of the opinion of consumers (as posted on SM) to the development of their products or services Personalities make efforts to protect their image and are being conscious of how they are perceived on SM. Organizations, political groups and even private individuals follow the activities on the SM to keep abreast with how their audience reacts to issues that concerns them [32], [12], [17].\nData representation on SM consists of nodes and links in data graph. The nodes are made up of the entities while the links are the relationships between the entities as shown in Fig.3. A real world example of this is an individual on Facebook where friends, relatives and colleagues represent the nodes that are connected to that individual via links. This explains why Chi, Y et al (2009) apply the graph structure to sentiment analysis on SM in order to make concrete reasoning [18].\nOpinion/sentiment analysis are common content generated on SM site and it is of considerable importance to critically analyse opinion/sentiment expressed by users on SM. Sentiment analysis on SM is discussed in the next section of this review.\n4. Sentiment Analysis on Social Media\nHaving explained the background of SM, we are now going to discuss sentiment analysis on SM. Sentiment analysis research has its roots in papers published by [24] and [73] where they analysed market sentiment, and later gained more ground the year after where authors like [75] and [58] have reported their findings. Opinions expressed by SM users are often convincing and these indicators can be used to form the basis of choices and decisions made by people on patronage of certain products and services or endorsement of political candidate during elections [39], [62]. Sentiment analysis can be referred to as discovery and recognition of positive or negative expression of opinion by people on diverse subject matters of interest.\nIt is worthy of note that the enormous opinions of several millions of SM users are overwhelming, ranging from very important ones to mere assertions (e.g. “The phone does not come in my favourite colour, therefore it is a waste of money”). Consequentially it has become necessary to analyse sentiment expressed by SM users using data mining techniques in order to generate a meaningful framework that can be used as decision support tool. This can be made possible by employing algorithms and techniques to ascertain sentiment that matters to the topic, text, document or personality under review. The motive behind opinion investigation and sentiment analysis is basically to recognize potential drift in the society as it concerns the attitudes, observations, sentiment and the expectations of stakeholder or the populace and to make prompt necessary decisions. It is more important to translate sentiment expressed to useful knowledge by way of mining and analysis [39]. In this review, different data mining techniques in sentiment analysis of SM will be assessed and possible new ones that can be employed in the field will be considered."

      "heading" : "4.1 Research Issues and Challenges in Sentiment Analysis on SM",
      "text" : "A number of research issues and challenges facing the realisation of utilising data mining techniques in sentiment analysis could be identified as follows:\n● The implication of social procedures from data, and the problem of safeguarding individual privacy when analysing SM [44]. While most research conducted on SM use public data, rich\nemerging source of social interaction data comes from strongly protected private data like e-mail, phone conversations and instant messaging. Investigations are being conducted on information hunt, community creation and gaining popularity and influence on SM [40], [43].\n● The problem of link inference – This is the problem of envisaging the links that are not currently present in the SM. By so\ndoing the relevant forthcoming linkages and the fundamental knowledge of enemies and terrorists networks on the SM will be known before they emerge [4], [49].\n● Issues of valence when categorizing sentiment [63] – Even though sentiment analysis is all about positive and negative\nfeelings; neutral being the midpoint of positive and should not be neglected as the inclusion of neutral training instances in learning enhance the dissimilarities in positive and negative sentiments (Koppel & Schler, 2006). However, in most studies so far, neutral sentiment is ignored when training classification models.\n● The problem of query classification [62]; KDD Cup, [60]. This problem lies in the issue of short queries and the implied and\nsubjective intentions of the users. The two issues pose a question of how researchers will understand straightaway the user intension when searching the web using the search queries. Query classification therefore becomes an issue that needs to be addressed by researchers in the field. KDD Cup, 2005, in the year’s competition, required participants to classify 800,000 search queries into 67 pre-defined classes. These classes were in grading with 2 levels. The 7 top-most categories have many second level sub categories. The arrangement was employed for two reasons; first is to include the major aspects in the internet information space; and second is for the competition to be relevant in actuality. The end result of the competition shows that: There is no direct training data\n● Rating-inference problem [60] - Moving further from categorizing texts or products based on just positive or negative to\nusing numerical rating (one star to five stars). Pang and Lee assessed human performance at the task against meta-algorithm based on a metric labelling formulation of the setback, making sure that comparable entries receive the same labels by altering a specified n-ray classifier’s output in a clearly defined effort. It was proved that meta-algorithm was capable of offering outstanding improvements far above SVM’s multi-class and regression when a new comparison measure commensurate to the problem was used.\n● Ambiguity in the sentiment portray by users - Sentiment expressed by reviewer may sometimes be fuzzy and indirect [7]. It\ncan be said to be neither here nor there. (e.g., “The laptop is lightweight, the keys are soft and easy to punch, comes in nice colours, but the price is unreasonable; I can’t really say if it’s worth it or not”).\nHaving presented some of the research issues and challenges in sentiment analysis in SM, the following section discusses some of the sentiment analysis tools used on SM data.\n5. Sentiment Analysis Tools in Social Media\nDifferent systems have been developed in the effort to enumerate/analyse the sentiment arising from products, services, event or personality review on SM [29]. There are tools already used in sentiment analysis, ranging from simple counting methods to machine learning. This includes categorizing opinion-based text using binary distinction of positive against negative [31], [58], [75], [25]. Binary distinction of positive against negative is found to be insufficient when ranking items in terms of recommendation or comparison of several reviewers’ opinions [60] (e.g., using actors starred in two different films to decide which of them to see at the cinema). Determining players from documents on SM has also become valuable as influential actors are considered as variables in the documents [81] when applying data mining techniques on SM. The idea of co-occurrence can also be seen as viable information [28].\nThe data mining tools reviewed in this paper are majorly the ones currently in use which range from unsupervised, semi-supervised to supervised learning. A table itemizing those covered in this paper is presented in section 7.\n5.1 Aspect-Based/Feature-Based Opinion Mining Problem\nAspect-based also known as feature-based analysis is the process of mining the area of entity customers has reviewed [34]. This is because not all aspects/features of an entity are often reviewed by customers. It is then necessary to summarise the aspects reviewed to determine the polarity of the overall review whether they are positive or negative. Sentiments expressed on some entities are easier to analyse than others [51], one of the reason being that some reviews are ambiguous.\nAccording to [51] aspect-based opinion problem lies more in blogs and forum discussions than in product or service reviews. The aspect/entity (which may be a computer device) reviewed is either ‘thumb up’ or ‘thumb down’, thumb up being positive review while thumb down means negative review. Conversely, in blogs and forum discussions both aspects and entity are not recognized and there are high levels of insignificant data which constitute noise. It is therefore necessary to Identify opinion sentences in each review to determine if indeed each opinion sentence is positive or negative [34]. Opinion sentences can be used to summarize aspect-based opinion which enhances the overall mining of product or service review [51].\nAn opinion holder [6], [42], [78] expresses either positive or negative opinion on an entity or a portion of it when giving a regular opinion and nothing else [34]. However, [45] put necessity on differentiating the two assignments of finding out neutral from non-neutral sentiment, and also positive and negative sentiment. This is believed to greatly increase the correctness of computerised structures.\n6. Data Mining Techniques Used in Social Media\nData mining techniques are capable of handling the three dominant disputes with SM data which are size, noise and dynamism. SM data sets are very voluminous and require automated information processing for analysing it within a reasonable time. As data mining also require huge data sets to mine remarkable patterns from data, SM sites appear to be perfect sites to work on especially where opinion/sentiment expression is involved [22]. SM data sets are also characterised by noisy data such as spam blogs and irrelevant tweets in case of twitters. The dynamism in SM data sets causes it to evolve rapidly over time and data mining techniques are versatile in handling such dynamic data. The use of data mining techniques on SM data is an enabling factor for advanced search results in search engines and also help in better understanding of data for research and organizational functions [4].\nOpinion/sentiment analysis on a movie review discovered that machine learning turned out a better technique than uncomplicated counting methods [58]. Using the combination of Naïve Bayes classification, Maximum Entropy Classification and Support Vector Machine (SVM) reveals that SVM produced the best result. Though the viewpoints associated with these three algorithms are clearly diverse; all of them were efficient in earlier text classification learning. Data mining techniques capable of mining stream data are faced with classification problem when handling micro-blogs such as twitter because of the high data stream model used by twitter to transmit data. Algorithm design also faces severe problem with the algorithm predicting the real time within a very minute space of time and memory. [7]. Twitter has been proved to be the most commonly used microblogging application around today. With about 500 million estimated registered users as of June, 2012, Twitter has evolved to be a credible medium of sentiment/opinion expression. It is also a notable medium for information dissemination since it was launched in 2007. Twitter data (known as tweets) can be referred to as ‘news in real time’. The network reports useful information from different perspectives for better understanding. Tweets\nposted online include news, major events and topics which could be of local, national or global interest. Different events/occurrences are tweeted in real time all around the world making the network generate data rapidly.\nIn January, 2013, the citizens of the Japan set a record as the New Year began, reaching 33,388 tweets per second. As of March, 2013, Twitter network generates 340 million tweets daily. Many organisations, individuals and even government bodies follow activities on the network in order to obtain knowledge on how their audience reacts to tweets that affect them. Twitter users follow other users on the network and by so doing they are able to read tweets posted by their “following” users. This is also a way of filtering tweets of interest out of the enormous tweets posted on the network on daily basis. A common way of labelling a tweet is by including a number of hashtags symbols (#) that describe its contents. Twitter as a social network and hashtags as tweet labels can be analysed in order to detect changes in event patterns using Association Rules (ARs). We can use postings on Twitter (known as tweets) to analyse patterns associated with events by detecting the dynamics of the tweets. Association Rule Mining (ARM) can find the likelihood of co-occurrence of hashtags. In our previous paper [1] we use ARM to analyse tweets on the same topic over consecutive time periods t and t+1. We also use Rule Matching (RM) to detected changes in patterns such as `emerging', `unexpected', `new' and `dead' rules in tweets. This is obtained by setting a user-defined Rule Matching Threshold (RMT) to match rules in tweets at time t with those in tweets at t + 1 in order to detect rules that fall into the different patterns. We coined this proposed method Transaction-based Rule Change Mining (TRCM) as described in Fig.4. Finally, we linked all the detected rules to real life situations such as events and news reports.\nIn our recent experiment we use TRCM to discover the rule trend of tweets’ hashtags over a consecutive period of time. We created Time Frame Windows (TFWs) (Fig. 5) showing different rule evolvement patterns which can be applied to evolvements of news and events in reality.\nFig.5. Different Sequences of Time Frame Windows (TFWs)\nWe also use the time frame of rules present in tweets’ hashtags to\ncalculate the lifespan of specific hashtags on Twitter. Using our experimental study result, we are able to substantiate that the lifespan of tweets’ hashtags can be related to evolvements of news and events in reality. The time frame of rules depicts that while some rule trend may last for few days, others may last for much longer time. Lifespan of hashtags on Twitter are affected by different factors including interestingness of the tweet (for example tweet of global concern such as global warming). Both experiments can be said to be the first time ARM was used to mine Twitter data.\nDetermining semantic orientation of words is also an issue raise when using data mining techniques in analysing sentiment on SM. Adjectives divided with AND are known to have the equal polarity while the ones divided by BUT are known to have reverse polarity [31]. Adjectives of the same affinity can be grouped into clusters using statistical model [29].\n6.1 Unsupervised Classification\nA straightforward unsupervised learning algorithm can be used to rate a review as ‘thumbs up’ or ‘thumbs down’ [75]. This can be by way of digging out phrases that include adjective or adverbs (part of speech tagging) [66]. The semantic orientation of every phrase can be approximated using PMI-IR [74] and then classify the review using the average semantic orientation of the phrase. An earlier experiment conducted to establish the semantic orientation of adjective used complex algorithm that was limited to isolated adjective to adverbs or longer phrases [31]. Cogency of title, body and comments generated from blog post has also been used in clustering similar blogs into significant groups. In this case keywords played very important role which may be multifaceted and bare [3]. EM-based and constrained-LDA were utilized to cluster aspect phrases into aspect categories."

      "text" : "This is a dictionary of sentimental words reviewers often used in their expression. Sentiment lexicon is list of the common words that enhances data mining techniques when used mining sentiment in document. Different corpus of sentiment lexicon can be created for variety of subject matters.\nFor instance sentimental words used in sport are often different from those used in politics. Expanding the occurrence of sentiment lexicon helps to focus more on analysing topic-specific occurrence, but with the use of high manpower [29]. Lexicon-based approaches require parsing to work on simple, comparative, compound, conditional sentences and questions [26].\nSentiment lexicon can be expanded by use of synonyms. Nonetheless, lexicon expansion through the use of synonyms has a drawback of the wording loosing it primary meaning after a few recapitulation. Sentiment lexicon can also be enhanced by ‘throwing away’ neutral words that are neither expressed positively nor negatively."

      "text" : "Extensive information gives rise to challenge of automatic summarization. Opinion definition and opinion summarization are essential techniques for recognizing opinion. Opinion definition can be located in a text, sentence or topic in a document; it can also reside in the entire document. Opinion summarization sums up different opinions aired on piece of writing by analyzing the sentiment polarities, degree and the associated occurrences [46]. This approach is examined by intermediary sentences. Opinion extraction is vital for summarization and subsequent tracking. Texts, topics and documents are searched to extract opinionated part. It is necessary of summarise opinion because not all opinion expressed in a document are expected to be of importance to issue under consideration. Opinion summarization is quiet useful to businesses and government alike, as it helps in improving policies and products respectively [25], [55]. It also helps in taking care of information excess [76]."

On the other hand sellers make use of SO for their rating standard in other to safeguard irrelevant or misleading reviews present to reviewers the 5-star scale rating with five signifying best rated while one signifies poor rating. In [82] SO was used to improve the performance of mood classification. Livejournal blog corpus dataset was used to train and evaluate the method used. The paper presented a modular proficient hierarchical classification technique easily implemented together with SO attributes and machine learning techniques. The initial result of classification accuracy was only slightly above the baseline owing to the fact that it was a first attempt.\nA flexible hierarchy-based mood approach was then incorporated to mood classification by considering all possible mood labels. The latter result discovers that attributes that points to accurate classification of mood expression can still be chosen despite the enormous amount of words present in the blog corpus in the various domain."

      "heading" : "6.1.4 Opinion Extraction",
      "text" : "Sentiment analysis deals with establishing and classifying the subjective information present in a material [79]. This might not necessarily be factbased as people have different feelings toward the same product, service, topic, event or person. Opinion extraction is necessary in order to target the exact part of the document where the real opinion is expressed. Opinion from an individual in a specialised subject may not count except if the individual is an authority in the field of the subject matter. Nevertheless, opinion from several entities necessitates both opinion extraction and summarization [51].\nOpinion extraction is necessary because the more the number of people that give their opinion in a particular subject, the more important that portion might be worth extracting. Sentiment/opinion can aim at a particular article while on the other hand can compare two or more articles. The formal is a regular opinion while the latter is comparative [35], [51]. Opinion extraction identifies subjective sentences with sentimental classification of either positive or negative.\nOther Unsupervised learning currently in use includes: POS (Part of Speech) tagging. In POS adjectives are tagged to display positive and negatives ones. Sentiment polarity is the binary classification of an opinionated document into a largely positive and negative opinion [62]. In review this is commonly termed with the ‘thumps up’ and ‘thumps down’ expressions. The polarity of positive against negative is weighed to give an overall analysis of sentiment expressed on issue under review. Bootstrapping forms part of the unsupervised approaches. It utilizes obtainable primary classifier to make labelled data which a supervised process can build upon [65], [78], [37]. Another unsupervised approached already considered is an approach [62] refer to as the blank slate. Semantic orientation is also one of the unsupervised approaches currently used for sentiment analysis on SM. It makes use of different meaning to a single word – synonym. This could either be positive or negative (for example ‘the party is bad’ may in actual fact mean the party is fun). Direction and intensity of words used can determine the semantic orientation of the opinion expressed [15]."

      "heading" : "6.1.5 Basic Clustering Techniques",
      "text" : "K-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering can be used to analyse small text document. The k of the cluster is inputted to the k-means algorithm detecting the declared k in the document and in subsequent documents [13]. The coordinate in vector space is initially clustered randomly, then iteratively with every inputted text document being apportioned to the strongest cluster. The coordinate in the vector space is recomputed be stand as the center of all document apportioned to the cluster. However, the experiment needed to be repeated until a stable result is generated. It was resolved that even when the N dimensions have just two probable values (positive and negative) the number of inputted documents is always too insignificant to populate each of the 2 N potential cells in the vector space. This brand most of the dimension unfeasible for similarity computations with it unsupervised nature making it difficult to identify the inadequacy. With the shortcomings, K- means fall short of being an appropriate technique for mining sentiment analysis in SM considering the volume of postings generated on these sites."

      "heading" : "6.1.6 Using Clustering for Opinion Formation",
      "text" : "Sentiments expressed by SM users are based largely on personal opinion and cannot be hold as absolute fact but they are capable of affecting the decisions of other users on diverse subject matters. There are different players on SM; while there are influential players, there are also docile ones. The opinion/reviews of influential users on SM often count. These users are capable of influencing the opinion of other users on the media, by so doing opinion formation evolves.\nClustering technique of data mining can be used to model opinion formation by way of assessing the affected nodes and unaffected nodes. Users that depict the same opinion are linked under the same nodes and those with opposing opinion are linked in other nodes. Behaviour of participants in each node is therefore subject to adjustments in awareness of the behaviour of participants in other nodes [39]. Opinion formation starts from the initial stage where bulk of participants pays no attention to\nrecourse action on significant issue at this stage. This is so because they do not consider the action viable. When cogent information is introduced opinion is cascaded and participants begin to make either positive or negative decisions. At this stage the decision of influential participants who are either efficient in the field or in communication skill attracts the followership of the minority. At this point the initial stage (as presented Fig. 6) is transformed to alert stage (as shown in Fig. 7). The percolate stage sets in when the minority are able to form a different opinion based on other agents’ behaviour and introduction of new information.\n6.2 Semi-supervised Classification\nSemi-supervised learning is a goal-targeted activity but unlike unsupervised; it can be specifically evaluated. Authors of [27] worked on a mini training set of seed in positive and negative expressions selected for training a term classifier. Synonym and antonym comparatives were added to the seed sets in an online dictionary. The approach was meant to produce the extended sets P’ and N’ that makes up the training sets. Other learners were employed and a binary classifier was built using every glosses in the dictionary for both term in P’∪ N’ and translating them to a vector [27], [51], their approach discovers the origin of information which they reported was missing in earlier techniques used for the task . Semi-supervised lexical classification proposed by [68] integrating lexical knowledge into supervised learning and spread the approach to comprise unlabelled data. Cluster assumption was engaged by grouping together two documents with\nthe same cluster basically supporting the positive - negative sentiment words as sentiment documents. It was noted that the sentiment polarity of document decides the polarity of word and vice versa.\nIn semi-supervised learning, [64] used polarity detection as semisupervised label propagation problem in a graph. Each node representing words whose polarity was to be discovered. The results shows label propagation progresses outstandingly above the baseline and other semisupervised techniques like Mincuts and Randomized Mincuts. The work of [30] compared graph-based semi-supervised learning with regression and [60] metric labelling which runs SVM regression as the original label preference function comparable to similarity measure they proposed. Their result shows that the graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm as per PSP comparison (SSL+PSP) proved to perform well."

      "heading" : "6.3 Supervised Classification",
      "text" : "While clustering techniques are used where basis of data is established but data pattern is unknown [4], classification techniques are supervised learning techniques used where the data organisation is already identified. It is worthy of mention that understanding the problem to be solved and opting for the right data mining tool is very essential when using data mining techniques to solve SM issues. Pre-processing and considering privacy rights of individual (as mentioned under research issues of this paper) should also be taken into account. Nonetheless, since SM is a dynamic platform, impact of time can only be rational in the issue of topic recognition, but not substantial in the case of network enlargement, group behaviour/ influence or marketing. This is because this attributes are bound to change from time to time. Information updates in some SM such as twitters and Facebook present Application Programmers Interfaces (APIs) that makes it possible for crawler, which gather new information in the site, to store the information for later usage and update.\nA supervised learning algorithm [75] used the combination of multiple bases of facts to label couple of adjectives having similar or dissimilar semantic orientations. The algorithm resulted in a graph with nodes and links which represents adjectives and similarity (or dissimilarity) of semantic orientation respectively. On the other hand [58] employed naive Bayes, Maximum entropy classification and Support Vector Machines to examine whether it is enough to treat sentiment classification exclusively as a topic-based categorization of positive or negative, or probably special sentiment-categorization methods had to be built.\n6.3.1 Classification Algorithms\nNaïve Bayes, SVM and Maximum Entropy classification techniques have been the three major ones commonly in use when dealing with sentiment analysis [9], [70], [58], Clarke et al use WEKA tokenizer with standard setting, and other classification tools like Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbour land Bayesian networks to create Error Reduction (JRip). Combination of Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy, was employed by way of pipeline cascade style to discover the emotions expressed by people in Dutch, French and English language. The technique was used to discover to their experience in consumption of certain products. The approach endorsed the use of active learning in labelling training examples providing obvious enhancements in the total results. Different attribute selection comparism including MI, IG, CHI and DF together with learning methods such as K-NN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Centroid and Window classifier in opinion mining for Chinese manuscripts was conducted by [70]. Their experiment proved IG as the premium for sentiment phrases collection while SVM performs best for sentiment classification. In their work, it was obvious that sentiment\nclassifier rely solely on topics and domain. Features of supervised learning are perhaps the most widely studies problem [51].\n6.3.2 Support Vector Machine\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the majorly experimented data mining techniques in sentiment analysis of SM. It is a kernel-based supervised learning technique. SVM is still an unresolved research problem but a very fast technique in training the evaluation. The use of SVM in sentiment analysis can be said to be popular because of its non-linear nature which makes it simple to evaluate both theoretically and computationally. SVM is a model of input-output efficient relationship with the output variable capable of being uttered nearly as a linear blend in its input vector components. SVM has the greatest efficiency at traditional text categorization when compared with other classification techniques like Naïve Bayes and Maximum Entropy [67].\n6.3.3 Naïve Bayes\nNaïve Bayes algorithm uses conditional probabilities by counting the occurrence of values and combinations of values in the historical data. It is therefore called the probabilistic method. Naïve Bayes is also an efficient technique of mining weather forecast. Naïve Bayes is one of the three majorly used supervised learning in sentiment analysis [9], [70], [58]. In [20] Naïve Bayes algorithm and binary keyword were simultaneously used to produce a single dimensional degree of sentiment entrenched in tweets from twitter network. Authors [54] used a combination of contextual lexical knowledge with Naïve Bayes. A generative model of sentiment lexicon was created with another model trained on labelled article. A multinomial Naïve Bayes was generated with the distribution from the two models pooled together to incorporate the two bases of information.\nWork of [69] recommended Adapted Naïve Bayes (ANB) in attempt to deal with the problem of domain-transfer common to supervised sentiment classifier. In their experiment they made use of the old-domain data and the labelled new-domain data suggesting an effective measure to control information from the old-domain data. The result of their experiment shows that recommended method can enhance the performance of base classifier significantly and produce greater performance than the naïve Bayes Transfer Classifier (NTBC) which is transfer-learning baseline.\n6.3.4 Neural Network\nNeural Network (NN) unlike the SVM is a non-linear technique which makes it not very popular datamining technique to use in sentiment analysis. There are two main setbacks associated with non-linear techniques namely; 1) problem of analysing theoretically and 2) problem of deciphering them computationally (Zhang, 2001). However, as a kernel-based technique, it is positive that with required features the prediction strength of linear techniques can be transformed to be as effective as that of non-linear techniques. According to [80] this can be achieved by altering NN technique to function in a linear way by utilizing weighted averaging over all likely NN in the structure. To make this possible, a non-linear feature needs to be included in the component.\nNN is commonly used for predicting financial performance and making financial decision. The back-propagation algorithm of NN was employed in [47] paper to incorporate vital and technical analysis for financial performance prediction which demonstrates NN integration thrives more during economic recession. The experiment result reports that NN performed above the minimum benchmark on diverse investment approach.\n6.3.5 K-Nearest Neighbour\nBased on research done so far, kNN has not received high level of attention in sentiment analysis as much as SVM, Naïve Bayes and Maximum Entropy which are widely explored in large number of experiments in sentiment analysis of SM [58], [59], [8], [57]. In [19] experiment on favourability analysis and sentiment analysis included kNN as one of the classification algorithm while testing the pseudo-subjectivity task. Their result revealed the advantage of using attribute selection and pseudo-sentiment task. Conversely, the experiment result did not report the performance of kNN classifier or use it as trade-off as interpretability improvement. This makes the relevance of its inclusion in the experiment insubstantial.\nFig.8. Flow chart of supervised machine learning algorithms (Shi & Li, 2011)\n6.3.6 Decision Tree\nSimilar to kNN, Decision Tree (DT) has not been considered majorly as a data mining technique in sentiment analysis. However Jia et al (2009) in experiment on candidate score (CS) DT was used to determine the polarity of CS using SVM-Light as the classifier. The technique was use with selected terms as tree and review sets of positive and negative as leaf nodes. The most significant review formed the root of the tree. DT was used as trade-off for highly predictive techniques (SVM and Naïve Bayes). Its inclusion in the experiment was worthwhile as it assist in understanding predictive performance profile in sentiment analysis. C4.5 DT was employed in learning semantic constraints while discovering part-whole relations in text mining. However, it performance was not reported in the survey as to whether the technique yielded any useable outcome.\n6.3.7 CHAID (Chi-square Automatic Interaction Selection)\nCHAID is a classification tool which can be used to analyse categorical data. It combines a dependant viable of more than two categories. The procedure was used to achieve a predictive pattern in ascertaining the actionable and non-actionable sections in respondent’s willingness to recommend or not to recommend to others based on their experience on services received through patronage [17]. It was noticed that willingness to make recommendations was an effective pointer in evaluating tourists’ aggregate allegiance to a destination rather than the willingness to re-visit.\n6.4 Text Mining\nAspect-rating is numerical evaluations in relation to the aspect pointing to the level of satisfaction portrayed in the comments gathered toward this aspect and the aspect rating. It makes use of diminutive phrases and their modifiers (Liu, 2011), for example ‘good product, excellent price’. Each aspect is extracted and collated using Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). It can be used in place of structure of the phrase. The already known complete post is exploited to ascertain the aspect rating [51]. Aspect cluster are words that communally stands for an aspect that users are concerned in and would comment on.\nLatent Aspect Rating Analysis (LARA) approach attempts to analyse opinion borne by different reviewers by doing a text mining at the point of topical aspect. This enables the determinance of every reviewer’s latent score on each aspects and the relevant influence on them when arriving at an affirmative conclusion. The revelation of the latent scores on different aspects can instantly sustain aspect-base opinion summarization. The aspect influences are proportional to analysing score performance of reviewers. The fusion latent scores and aspect influences is capable of sustaining personalised aspect-level scoring of entities using just those reviews originated from reviewers with comparable aspect influences to those considered by a particular user [76]. An aspect-based summarization make use of set of user reviews of a subject as input and creates a set of important aspects taking into consideration the combined sentiment of each aspect and supporting textual indication[72].\n6.4.1 Reviews and Ratings (RnR) Architecture (Rahaya, 2010)\nRnR is a conceptual architecture created as an interactive structure. It is user input oriented that develops relative new reviews. The user supplies the name of product or service whose performance has been earlier reviewed online by customers. This systems checks through the corpus of already reviewed to find out if it is stored in the local cache of the architecture for latest reviews. If the supplied data is found to be recent, it is subsequently used. If it is found to be obsolete, crawling is done on secondary site such as TripAdvisor.com and Expedia.com.au. The data retrieved on these sites are then locally built to discover the required justification. RnR architecture produced complete remarks of product and service (under review) within a time line by utilising temporal dimension analysis with scatter plot and linear regression. Free accessible domain ontology for feature identification by tagging few numbers of words was used. This was done because tagging POS of each word in whole reviews and opinion word identification process could be time consuming and computationally expensive even though it produces high accuracy. The use of neighbour word (words around the feature occurrences) also aids the pruning down of computational overhead.\nHaving discussed different datamining techniques used in sentiment analysis on SM, section 7 presents a table of list of data mining techniques currently used in sentiment analysis on SM.\n7. List of Data Mining Techniques Currently Used In Sentiment\nAnalysis\nDifferent data mining techniques have been used in sentiment analysis on SM ranging from unsupervised, semi-supervised and the supervised learning methods. So far different levels of success have being made with the use of these techniques either singularly or combined. The outcome of many experiments in sentiment analysis of SM has shed more light to the activities of SM. It has also revealed the different ways the opinion of SM users can be considered when making valuable decisions either at individual, organisational or governmental level. Different data mining techniques\n(unsupervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised) used in sentiment analysis on SM as much as this review could cover are highlighted in Table.1.\nTable.1 List of Data mining Techniques currently in Used in Sentiment\nAnalysis on SM\n8. Conclusion\nAnalysing SM data especially opinions/sentiments expressed by SM users with data mining techniques has proved effective and useful considering the research carried out so far in the field. This is so because of the capacity data mining possess in handling noisy, large and dynamic data. Different authors have come up with several algorithms that can be used to mine the opinions of online users of the SM. Large number of works reviewed majorly utilized Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy.\nAlthough some authors considered other data mining techniques like Association Rule Mining, Decision Tree, KNN and Neural Network, these techniques have not gained popularity as much as SVM, Naïve Bayes and Maximum Entropy. However their reports have been helpful for trade-off interpretability purpose. It is expected that future work will make use of both currently used and yet-to-be-explored data mining techniques to delve deeper into mining the ever increasing online data generated daily on SM. The results of the investigations are expected to assist different entities in retrieving vital information on SM and consequently using this information as decision support tools.\nReferences\n1.
