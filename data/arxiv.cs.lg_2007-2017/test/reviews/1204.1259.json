State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on the explicit case cannot be straightforwardly transformed to the implicit case if scalability should be maintained. There are few if any implicit feedback benchmark datasets, therefore new ideas are usually experimented on explicit benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware implicit feedback recommender algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS apply a fast, ALS-based tensor factorization learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zero elements in the tensor. The method also allows us to incorporate diverse context information into the model while maintaining its computational efficiency. In particular, we present two such context-aware implementation variants of iTALS. The first incorporates seasonality and enables to distinguish user behavior in different time intervals. The other views the user history as sequential information and has the ability to recognize usage pattern typical to certain group of items, e.g. to automatically tell apart product types or categories that are typically purchased repetitively (collectibles, grocery goods) or once (household appliances). Experiments performed on three implicit datasets (two proprietary ones and an implicit variant of the Netflix dataset) show that by integrating context-aware information with our factorization framework into the state-of-the-art implicit recommender algorithm the recommendation quality improves significantly.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Apr 2012 15:34:30 GMT  (1871kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1259v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 4 Apr 2013 15:33:31 GMT  (465kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1259v2", "Accepted for ECML/PKDD 2012, presented on 25th September 2012, Bristol, UK"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR cs.NA", "authors": ["bal\\'azs hidasi", "domonkos tikk"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.1259"}
