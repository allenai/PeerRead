      "text" : "Stochastic optimization problems are encountered in numerous real world domains including engineering design Wang & Shan [2007], finance Ziemba & Vickson [2006], natural sciences Floudas & Pardalos [2000], or in machine learning for selecting models by tuning the parameters of learning algorithms Snoek et al. [2012]. We aim at finding the input of a given system which optimizes the output (or reward). In this view, an iterative procedure uses the previously acquired measures to choose the next query predicted to be the most useful. The goal is to maximize the sum of the rewards received at each iteration, that is to minimize the cumulative regret by balancing exploration (gathering information by favoring locations with high uncertainty) and exploitation (focusing on the optimum by favoring locations with high predicted reward). This optimization task becomes challenging when the dimension of the search space is high and the evaluations are noisy and expensive. Efficient algorithms have been studied to tackle this challenge such as multiarmed bandit Auer et al. [2002], Kleinberg [2004], Bubeck et al. [2011], Audibert et al. [2011], active learning Carpentier et al. [2011], Chen & Krause [2013] or Bayesian optimization Mockus [1989], Grunewalder et al. [2010], Srinivas et al. [2012], de Freitas et al. [2012]. The theoretical analysis of such optimization procedures requires some prior assumptions on the underlying function f . Modeling f as a function distributed from a Gaussian process (GP) enforces near-by locations to have close associated values, and allows to control the general smoothness of f with high probability according to the kernel of the GP Rasmussen & Williams [2006]. Our main contribution is twofold: we propose a generic algorithm scheme for Gaussian process optimization and we prove sharp upper bounds on its cumulative regret. The theoretical analysis has a direct impact on strategies built with the GP-UCB algorithm Srinivas et al. [2012] such as Krause & Ong [2011], Desautels et al. [2012], Contal et al. [2013]. We suggest an alternative policy which achieves an exponential speed up with respect to the cumulative regret. We also introduce a novel algorithm, the Gaussian Process Mutual Information algorithm (GP-MI), which improves furthermore upper bounds for the cumulative regret from O( a\nT (log T )d+1) for GP-UCB, the current state of the art, to the spectacular O( a\n(log T )d+1), where T is the number of iterations, d is the dimension of the input space and the kernel function is Gaussian. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. We first introduce the setup and notations. We define the GP-MI algorithm in Section 2. Main results on the cumulative regret bounds are presented in Section 3. We then provide technical details in Section 4. We finally confirm the performances of GP-MI on real and synthetic tasks compared to the state of the art of GP optimization and some heuristics used in practice.\n2 Gaussian process optimization and the GP-MI algorithm"

The exploitation ability of the procedure is driven by µt, while the exploration is governed by φt : X → R, which is an increasing function of σ2t (x). The novelty in the GP-MI algorithm is that φt is empirically controlled by the amount of exploration that has been already done, that is, the more the algorithm has gathered information on f , the more it will focus on the optimum. In the GP-UCB algorithm from Srinivas et al. [2012] the exploration coefficient is aO(log t) and therefore tends to infinity. The parameter α in Algorithm 1 governs the trade-off between precision and confidence, as shown in Theorem 2. The efficiency of the algorithm is robust to the choice of its value. We confirm empirically this property and provide further discussion on the calibration of α in Section 5.\nAlgorithm 2 Generic Optimization Scheme (φt) for t = 1, 2, . . . do\nCompute µt and φt xt ← argmaxx∈X µt(x) + φt(x) Sample xt and observe yt\nend for\nMutual information.

We only require φt to be measurable with respect to Yt−1, the observations available at iteration t− 1. The theoretical analysis of Algorithm 2 can be used as a plug-in theorem for existing algorithms. For example the GP-UCB algorithm with parameter βt = O(log t) is obtained with φt(x) = a\nβtσ2t (x). A generic analysis of Algorithm 2 leads to the following upper bounds on the cumulative regret with high probability.\nTheorem 1 (Regret bounds for the generic algorithm). For all δ > 0 and T > 0, the regret RT incurred by Algorithm 2 on f distributed as a GP perturbed by independent Gaussian noise with variance σ2 satisfies the following bound with high probability, with C1 = 2log(1+σ−2) and α = log 2 δ :\nPr\n« RT ≤ T∑ t=1 pφt(xt)− φt(x?)q + 4 a α(C1γT + 1) + ? α 2 ∑T t=1 σ 2 t (x ?)? C1γT + 1 ff ≥ 1−δ .\nThe proof of Theorem 1, relies on concentration guarantees for Gaussian processes (see Section 4.1). Theorem 1 provides an intermediate result used for the calibration of φt to face the exploration/exploitation trade-off. For example by choosing φt(x) =? α 2 σ 2 t (x) (where the dimensional constant is hidden), Algorithm 2 becomes a variant\nof the GP-UCB algorithm where in particular the exploration parameter ? βt is fixed to ? α 2 instead of being an increasing function of t. The upper bounds on the cumulative regret with this definition of φt are of the form RT = O(γT ), as stated in Corollary 1. We then also consider the case where the kernel k of the Gaussian process is under the form of a squared exponential (RBF) kernel, k(x1, x2) = exp ´ − ‖x1−x2‖ 2\n2l2\n¯\n, for all x1, x2 ∈ X and length scale l ∈ R. In this setting, the maximum mutual information γT satisfies the upper bound γT = Op(log T )d+1q, where d is the dimension of the input space Srinivas et al. [2012]. Corollary 1. Consider the Algorithm 2 where we set φt(x) = ? α 2 σ 2 t (x). Under the assumptions of Theorem 1, we have that the cumulative regret for Algorithm 2 satisfies the following upper bounds with high probability:\n• For f sampled from a GP with general kernel: RT = O(γT ).\n• For f sampled from a GP with RBF kernel: RT = Op(log T )d+1q.\nTo prove Corollary 1 we apply Theorem 1 with the given definition of φt and then Equation 3, which leads to Pr rRT ≤ ? α 2 C1γT + 4 a\nα(C1γT + 1)s ≥ 1 − δ. The previously known upper bounds on the cumulative regret for the GP-UCB algorithm are of the form RT = Op ? TβT γT q where βT = Op log Tδ q. The improvement of the generic Algorithm 2 with φt(x) = ? α 2 σ 2 t (x) over the GP-UCB algorithm with respect to the cumulative regret is then exponential in the case of Gaussian processes with RBF kernel. For f sampled from a GP with linear kernel, corresponding to f(x) = wTx with w ∼ N (0, I), we obtain RT = Opd log T q. We remark that the GP assumption with linear kernel is more restrictive than the linear bandit framework, as it implies a Gaussian prior over the linear coefficients w. Hence there is no contradiction with the lower bounds stated for linear bandit like those of Dani et al. [2008]. We refer to Srinivas et al.

[2012], and a commonly used heuristic, the Expected Improvement (EI) algorithm with GP Jones et al. [1998]. The tasks used for assessment come from two real applications and five synthetic problems described here. For all data sets and algorithms the learners were initialized with a random subset of 10 observations {(xi, yi)}i≤10. When the prior distribution of the underlying function was not known, the Bayesian inference was made using a squared exponential kernel. We first picked the half of the data set to estimate the hyper-parameters of the kernel via cross validation in this subset. In this way, each algorithm was running with the same prior information. The value of the parameter δ for the GP-MI and the GP-UCB algorithms was fixed to δ = 10−6 for all these experimental tasks. Modifying this value by several orders of magnitude is insignificant with respect to the empirical mean cumulative regret incurred by the algorithms, as discussed in Section 5.2. The results are provided in Figure 3. The curves show the evolution of the average regret RTT in term of iteration T . We report the mean value with the confidence interval over a hundred experiments.\nDescription of the data sets. We describe briefly all the data sets used for assessment.\n• Generated GP. The generated Gaussian process functions are random GPs drawn from an isotropic Matérn kernel in dimension 2 and 4, with the kernel bandwidth set to 1 for dimension 2, and 16 for dimension 4. The Matérn parameter was set to ν = 3 and the noise standard deviation to 1% of the signal standard deviation.\n(a) Gaussian mixture (b) Himmelblau\nthe VOLNA code Dutykh et al.

The Mackey-Glass delay-differential equation is a chaotic system in dimension 6, but without noise. It models real feedback systems and is used in physiological domains such as hematology, cardiology, neurology, and psychiatry. The highly chaotic behavior of this function makes it an exceptionally difficult optimization problem. It has been used as a benchmark for example by Flake & Lawrence [2002].\nEmpirical comparison of the algorithms. Figure 3 compares the empirical mean average regret RTT for the three algorithms. On the easy optimization assessments like the Branin data set (Fig. 3(e)) the three strategies behave in a comparable manner, but the GP-UCB algorithm incurs a larger cumulative regret. For more difficult assessments the GP-UCB algorithm performs poorly and our algorithm always surpasses the EI heuristic. The improvement of the GP-MI algorithm against the two competitors is the most significant for exceptionally challenging optimization tasks as illustrated in Figures 3(a) to 3(d) and 3(h), where the underlying functions present several local optima. The ability of our algorithm to deal with the exploration/exploitation trade-off is emphasized by these experimental results as its average regret decreases directly after the first iterations, avoiding unwanted exploration like GP-UCB on Figures 3(a) to 3(d), or getting stuck in some local optimum like EI on Figures 3(c), 3(g) and 3(h). We further mention that the GP-MI algorithm is empirically robust against the number of dimensions of the data set (Fig. 3(b), 3(g), 3(h))."

The Mackey-Glass delay-differential equation is a chaotic system in dimension 6, but without noise. It models real feedback systems and is used in physiological domains such as hematology, cardiology, neurology, and psychiatry.

The upper bounds we derive on the cumulative regret for this generic algorithm improve by an exponential factor the previously known bounds for algorithms like GP-UCB. We also introduce the novel Gaussian Process Mutual Information algorithm (GP-MI), which significantly improves further these upper bounds for the cumulative regret. We confirm the efficiency of this algorithm on synthetic and real tasks against the natural competitor, GP-UCB, and also the Expected Improvement heuristic. Preprint for the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2014) 1 ar X iv :1 31 1. 48 25 v3 [ st at .M L ] 8 J un 2 01 5 Erratum After the publication of our article, we found an error in the proof of Lemma 1 which invalidates the main theorem. It appears that the information given to the algorithm is not sufficient for the main theorem to hold true. The theoretical guarantees would remain valid in a setting where the algorithm observes the instantaneous regret instead of noisy samples of the unknown function. We describe in this page the mistake and its consequences. Let f : X → R be the unknown function to be optimized, which is a sample from a Gaussian process. Let’s fix x, x1, . . . , xT ∈ X and the observations yt = f(xt)+ t where the noise variables t are independent Gaussian noise N (0, σ). We define the instantaneous regret rt = f(x?)− f(xt) and, MT = T ∑",
