      "text" : "Embedding learning, a.k.a. representation learning, is an essential ingredient of successful natural language models and deep architectures [125, 18, 17, 19, 90, 58] and has been the basis for modelling large-scale semantic knowledge graphs [110, 138, 104, 22, 23, 130, 40, 106, 107].1 A key concept is a mapping of the knowledge graph to a tensor representation whose entries are predicted by models using latent representations of generalized entities. Latent variable models are well suited to deal with the high dimensionality and sparsity of typical knowledge graphs. In recent publications the embedding models were extended to also consider temporal evolutions, time patterns and subsymbolic representations [48, 49]. These extended models were used successfully to predict clinical\n1Some authors make a distinction between latent representations, which are application specific, and embeddings, which are identical across applications and might represent universal properties of entities [120, 124].\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n07 97\n2v 9\n[ cs\n.A I]\n7 M\nay 2\n01 6\nHuman Memory\nevents like procedures, lab measurements, and diagnoses. In this paper, we attempt to map these embedding models, which were developed purely as solutions to technical problems, to various cognitive memory functions. Our approach follows the tradition of latent semantic analysis (LSA), which is a classical representation learning approach that on the one hand has found a number of technical applications and on the other hand could be related to cognitive semantic memories [88, 87, 38].\nCognitive memory functions are typically classified as long-term, short-term, and sensory memory, where long-term memory has the subcategories declarative memory and non-declarative memory [42, 6, 131, 14, 35, 54, 57]. Figure 1 shows these main categories and finer subcategories and shows the role of working memory [9]. There is evidence that these main cognitive categories are partially dissociated from one another in the brain, as expressed in their differential sensitivity to brain damage [54]. However, there is also evidence indicating that the different memory functions are not mutually independent and support each other [76, 61].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce the unique-representation hypothesis as the basis for exchanging information between different memory functions. We present the different tensor representations of the main memory functions and discuss offline learning of the models. In Section 3 we introduce different representations for the indicator mapping function used in the memory models and in Section 4 we show how likely triples can be generated from the model using a simulated-annealing based sampling perspective. In Section 5 we discuss the path from sensory input to a semantic representation of scene information and to long-term semantic and episodic memory. In Section 6 we explain how the different memory representations form the basis of a prediction system and relate this to working memory. Section 7 represents the main results of this paper in form of a discussion of a number of postulated hypotheses for human memory. Section 8 contains our conclusions."

      "heading" : "2.1 Unique-Representation Hypothesis",
      "text" : "In this section we discuss how the different memory functions can be coded as tensors and how inference and generalization can be achieved by coupled tensor decompositions.\nWe begin by considering declarative memories. The prime example of a declarative memory is the semantic memory which stores general world knowledge about entities. Second, there is concept memory which stores information about the concepts in the world and their hierarchical organization. In contrast to the general setting in machine learning, in this paper entities are the prime focus and concepts are of secondary interest. Finally, episodic memory stores information of general and personal events [139, 140, 141, 54]. Whereas semantic memory concerns information we “know”, episodic memory concerns information we “remember” [57]. The portion of episodic memory that concerns an individual’s life involving personal experiences is called autobiographic memory.\nSemantic memories and episodic memories are long-term memories. In contrast, we also consider sensory memory, which is the shortest-time element of memory. It is the ability to retain impressions of sensory information after the original stimuli have ended [54].\nFinally, working memory is the topic of Section 6. Working memory uses the other memories for tasks like prediction, decision support and other high-level functions.\nThe unique-representation hypothesis assumed in this paper is that each entity or concept ei, each predicate ep and each time step et has a unique latent representation —ai, ap, respectively, at— in form of a vector of real numbers. The assumption is that the representations are shared between all memory functions, and this permits information exchange and inference between the different memories. For simplicity we assume that the dimensionalities of these latent representations are all identical r̃ such that ai P Rr̃, ap P Rr̃, and at P Rr̃. Figure 3 shows a simple network realization."

      "heading" : "2.2 A Semantic Knowledge Graph Model",
      "text" : "A technical realization of a semantic memory is a knowledge graph (KG) which is a triple-oriented knowledge representation. Popular large-scale KGs are DBpedia [7], YAGO [134], Freebase [21], NELL [27], and the Google Knowledge Graph [126].\nHere we consider a slight extension to the subject-predicate-object triple form by adding the value in the form (es, ep, eo; Value) where Value is a function of s, p, o and, e.g., can be a Boolean variable (True or 1, False or 0) or a real number. Thus (Jack, likes, Mary; True) states that Jack (the subject or head entity) likes Mary (the object or tail entity). Note that es and eo represent the entities for subject index s and object index o. To simplify notation we also consider ep to be a generalized entity associated with predicate type with index p. We encode attributes also as triples, mostly to simplify the discussion.\nWe now consider an efficient representation of a KG. With this representation, it is also possible to generalize from known facts to new facts (inductive inference). First, we introduce the threeway semantic adjacency tensor X where the tensor element xs,p,o is the associated Value of the triple (es, ep, eo). Here s “ 1, . . . , S, p “ 1, . . . , P , and o “ 1, . . . , O. One can also define a companion tensor Θ with with the same dimensions as X and with entries θs,p,o. It contains the natural parameters of the model and the connection to X for Boolean variables is\nP pxs,p,o|θs,p,oq “ sigpθs,p,oq (1)\nwhere sigpargq “ 1{p1 ` expp´argqq is the logistic function (Bernoulli likelihood) . If xs,p,o is a real number then we can use a Gaussian distribution with P pxs,p,o|θs,p,oq „ N pθs,p,o, σ2q. Unless specified otherwise, we will assume a Bernoulli distribution for the rest of the paper.\nAs mentioned, the key concept in embedding learning is that each entity e has an r̃-dimensional latent vector representation a P Rr̃. In particular, the embedding approaches used for modeling KGs assume that θsemantics,p,o “ f semanticpaes ,aep ,aeoq. (2) Here, the function f semanticp¨q predicts the value of the natural parameter. In the case of a KG with a Bernoulli likelihood, sigpθsemantics,p,o q represents the confidence that the Value of the triple (es, ep, eo) is true and we call the function an indicator mapping function and we discuss examples in the next section.\nLatent representation approaches have been used very successfully to model large KGs, such as the YAGO KG, the DBpedia KG and parts of the Google KG. It has been shown experimentally that models using latent factors perform well in these high-dimensional and highly sparse domains. Since an entity has a unique representation, independent of its role as a subject or an object, the model permits the propagation of information across the KG. For example if a writer was born in Munich, the model can infer that the writer is also born in Germany and probably writes in the German language [104, 105]. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is typically being used as an iterative approach for finding both optimal latent representations and optimal parameters in f semanticp¨q [106, 85]. For a recent review, please consult [106].\nDue to the approximation, sigpθsemanticJack,marriedTo,eq might be smaller than one for the true spouse. The approximation also permits inductive inference: We might get a large sigpθsemanticJack,marriedTo,eq also for persons e that are likely to be married to Jack and sigpθsemantics,p,o q can, in general, be interpreted as a confidence value for the triple pes, ep, eoq. More complex queries on semantic models involving existential quantifier are discussed in [84].\nA concept memory would technically correspond to classes with a hierarchical subclass structure. In [103, 102] such a structure was learned from the latent representations by hierarchical clustering. In KGs, a hierarchical structure is described by type and subclass relations.\nLatent representations for modeling semantic memory functions have a long history in cognitive modeling, e.g., in latent semantic analysis [87] which is restricted to attribute-based representations. Generalizations towards probabilistic models are probabilistic latent semantic indexing [72] and latent Dirichlet allocation [20]. Latent clustering and topic models [78, 146, 2] are extensions toward multi-relational domains and use discrete latent representations. See also [93, 62, 63]. Spreading activation is the basis of the teachable language comprehender (TLC), which is a network model\nof semantic memory [30]. Associate models are the symbolic ACT-R [4, 5] and SAM [114]. [107] explores holographic embeddings with representation learning to model associative memories. An attractive feature here is that the compositional representation has the same dimensionality as the representation of its constituents. Connectionists memory models are described in [73, 96, 28, 82, 67, 68]."

      "heading" : "2.3 An Event Model for Episodic Memory",
      "text" : "Whereas a semantic KG model reflects the state of the world, e.g, of a clinic and its patients, observations and actions describe factual knowledge about discrete events, which, in our approach, are represented by an episodic event tensor. In a clinical setting, events might be a prescription of a medication to lower the cholesterol level, the decision to measure the cholesterol level and the measurement result of the cholesterol level; thus events can be, e.g., actions, decisions and measurements.\nThe episodic event tensor is a four-way tensor Z where the tensor element zs,p,o,t is the associated Value of the quadruple (es, ep, eo, et). The indicator mapping function then is\nθepisodics,p,o,t “ f episodicpaes ,aep ,aeo ,aetq\nwhere we have added a representation for the time of an event by introducing the generalized entity et with latent representation aet . This latent representation compresses all events that happen at time t.\nAs examples, the individual can recall “Who did I meet last week?” by eo “ arg maxe θ episodic Myself,meet,e,LastWeek and “When did I meet Jack?” by et “ arg maxe θ episodic Myself,meet,Jack,e.\nExamples from our clinical setting would be: (Jack, orderBloodTest, Cholesterol, Week34; True) for the fact that a cholesterol blood test was ordered in week 34 and (Jack, hasBloodTest, Cholesterol, Week34; 160) for the result of the blood test. Note that we consider an episodic event memory over different subjects, predicates and objects; thus episodic event memory can represent an extensive event context!\nAn event model can be related to the cognitive concept of an episodic memory (Figure 1). Episodic memory represents our memory of experiences and specific events in time in a serial form (a “mental time travel”), from which we can reconstruct the actual events that took place at any given point in our lives [127]2. In contrast to semantic memory, it requires recollection of a prior experience [140].\nFor a particular instance in time t, the “slice” of the event tensor Zt describes events as a, typically very sparse, triple graph. Some of the elements of this triple graph will affect changes in the KG [48, 49] (see also the discussion in Section 7). For example the event model might record a diagnosis which then becomes a fact in the KG. Also the common representations for subject, predicate, and object lead to a transfer from the event model to the semantic KG model (see also the discussion in Section 7)."

      "heading" : "2.4 Autobiographical Event Tensor",
      "text" : "In some applications we want to consider the episodic information specific to an individual. For example, in a patient model, one is interested in what happened to the individual at time t and not what happened to all patients at time t. The autobiographical event tensor is simply the sub-tensor Zs concerning the events of the individual only. We then obtain a personal time es“i,t with latent representation aes“i,t . Whereas aet is a latent representation for all events for all patients at time t, aes“i,t is a latent representation for all events for patients i at time t [48, 49].\nThe autobiographical event tensor would correspond to the autobiographical memory, which stores autobiographical events of an individual on a semantic abstraction level [33, 54]. The autobiographical event tensor can be related to Baddeley’s episodic buffer and, in contrast to Tulving’s concept of episodic memory, is a temporary store and is considered to be a part of working memory [10, 76, 11].\n2http://www.human-memory.net/types episodic.html"

      "text" : "We assume that the sensor input consists of Q-channels and that at each time step t a buffer is constructed of N samples of the Q channels. γ “ 0, . . . , N specifies the time location within the buffer (see also Figure 2). In contrast to the event buffer, the sensory buffer operates at a subsymbolic level. Technically it might represent measurements like temperature and pressure, and in a cognitive model, it might represent input channels from the senses. The sensory buffer might be related to the mini-batches in Spark Streaming where data is captured in buffers that hold seconds to minutes of the input streams [149].\nThe sensory buffer is described by a three-way tensor U where the tensor element uq,γ,t is the associated Value of the triple (eq, eγ , et). eq is a generalized entity for the q-th sensory channel, eγ specifies the time location in the buffer and et is a generalized entity representing the complete buffer at time t.\nWe model θsensoryq,γ,t “ f sensorypaeq ,aeγ ,aetq\nwhere aeq is the latent representations for the sensor channel eq and aeγ is the latent representations for eγ . Latent components corresponds to complex time patterns (chunks) whose amplitudes are determined by the components of aet ; thus complex sensory events and sensory patterns can be modelled.\nIn a technical application [49], the sensors measure, e.g., wind speed, temperature, and humidity at the location of wind turbines and the sensory memory retains the measurements from t´ 1 to t. In human cognition, sensory memory (milliseconds to a second) represents the ability to retain impressions of sensory information after the original stimuli have ended [139, 31, 54]. The transfer of sensory memory to short-term memory (e.g., the autobiographical episodic buffer) is the first step in some memory models, in particular in the modal theory of Atkinson and Shiffrin [6]. New evidence suggests that short-term memory is not the sole gateway to long-term memory [54]. Sensory memory is thought to be located in the brain regions responsible for the corresponding sensory processing. Sensory memory can be the basis for sequence learning and the detection of complex time patterns."

Under the unique-representation hypothesis assumed in this paper, the latent representations of generalized entities are central for retrieval and prediction: the memory does not need to store all the facts and relationships about an entity. Also, there is no need to explicitly store the semantic graph explicitly. At any time, an approximation to the graph can be reconstructed from the latent representations. See also the discussion in Section 7."

Note that this is a global optimization step involving all available data.3 In general, we assumed a unique-representation for an entity, for example we assume that aes is the same in the prediction model and in the semantic model. Sometimes it makes sense to relax that assumption and only assume some form of a coupling. Technically there are a number of possibilities: For example, the prediction model might be trained on its own cost function, using the latent representations from the knowledge graph as an initialization; alternatively, one can use different weights for the different cost function terms. Some investigators propose that only some dimensions of the latent representations should be shared [3, 1]. 4 [89, 19, 17] contain extensive discussions on the transfer of latent representations. It is important to note that by considering only conditional probability\n3In human memory, one might speculate that this might be a step performed during sleep. 4In the technical solutions [48, 49], we got best results by focussing on the cost function that corresponded to the problem to solve. For example in prediction tasks we optimized the latent representations and the parameters using the prediction cost function.\nmodels (e.g., Value, conditioned on subject, predicate and object), no global normalization needs to be considered in training."

Among other advantages, a common representation would explain why background information about an entity is seemingly effortlessly integrated into sensor scene understanding and decision support by humans, at least for entities familiar to the individual.\nResearchers have reported on a remarkable subset of medial temporal lobe (MTL) neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names [113, 112]. For example, neurons have been shown to selectively respond to famous actors like “Halle Berry”. Thus a local encoding of index neurons seems biologically plausible.\nAs stated before, we do not insist that index neurons representing single entities exist as such in the brain, rather that there is a level of abstraction, which is equivalent to an index neuron, e.g., an ensemble of neurons.\nOur hypothesis supports both locality and globality of encoding [96, 43], since index neurons are local representations of generalized entities, whereas the representation layers would be highdimensional and non-local.\nFigure 10 shows index layers and representation layers for entities and relation types on the left. Note, that in the figure we draw different index neurons for entities in their roles as subject and object. In a way this is an artefact of the visualization of the sampling process. We maintain the hypothesis that an entity has a unique index neuron and a unique latent representation.\nAn interesting question is if the latent dimensions have a sensible and maybe useful interpretation, which the brain might exploit!\nOften neurons with similar receptive fields are clustered together in sensory cortices and form a topographic map [57]. Topological maps might also be the organizational form of neurons representing entities. Thus, entities with similar latent representations might be topographically close. A detailed atlas of semantic categories has been established in extensive fMRI studies showing the involvement of the lateral temporal cortex (LTC), the ventral temporal cortex (VTC), the lateral parietal cortex (LPC), the medial parietal cortex (MPC), the medial prefrontal cortex, the superior prefrontal cortex (SPFC) and the inferior prefrontal cortex (IPFC) [74].\nAlthough the established assumption is that no new neurons are generated in the adult cortex, topographic maps might change, e.g., due to injury, and exhibit considerably plasticity. Consequently, one might speculate that index neurons for novel entities not yet represented in the cortex need to be integrated in the existing topographic organization. This would not be a contradiction to our model, since, although we require some representation for index neurons, it is irrelevant which individual neurons represent which entities. Index and representation neurons for new entities might be allocated in the hippocampus, although, and their function later be transferred to the cortex."

Concept learning is not the main focus of this paper and we only want to describe one simple realization. Consider that we treat a concept simply as another entity with its own latent representation, as, e.g., in [105]. We can introduce the relation type type, which links entities with their concepts.

The time index neurons might be ordered sequentially, so the brain maintains a notion of temporal closeness and temporal order. Index neurons for time, i.e., et, might be formed in the hippocampal region of the brain. Evidence for time cells have recently been found [46, 44, 80, 79]. It has been observed that the hippocampus becomes activated when the temporal order of events is being processed [91, 119, 118]. Our model is in accordance with the concept that perceived sensations are decoded in the various sensory areas of the cortex, and then combined in the brains hippocampus into one single experience.\nAccording to our proposed model, the hippocampus would need to assign new time neurons during lifetime. In fact, it has been observed that the adult macaque monkey forms a few thousand new neurons daily [57, 59], possibly to encode new information [16]. Neurogenesis has been established in the dentate gyrus (part of the hippocampal formation) which is thought to contribute to the formation of new episodic memories.\nThe hippocampus might be the place where new index neurons and representations are generated in general, i.e., also for new places and entities. Certainly, the hippocampus is involved in forming new spatial representations. There are multiple, functionally specialized, cell types of the hippocampalentorhinal circuit, such as place, grid, and border cells [99]. Place cells fire selectively at one or few locations in the environment. Place, grid and border cells likely to interact with each other to yield a global representation of the individuals changing position. Once encoded, the memories must be consolidated. Spatial memories, as other memories, are thought to be slowly induced in the neocortex by a gradual recruitment of neocortical memory circuits in long-term storage of hippocampal memories [97, 132, 52, 99].\nThe fast implementation of weight patterns in the hippocampal area is discussed under the term synaptic consolidation and occurs within minutes to hours, and as such is considered the “fast” type of consolidation.\nAccording to our theory, the hippcampus would need to be well connected to the association areas of the cortex. Indeed, the hippocampus receives inputs from the unimodal and polymodal association areas of the cortex (visual, auditory, somatosensory) by a pathway involving the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices which project to the entorhinal cortex which then projects to the hippocampus. All these structures are part of the MTL. The perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices also project back to the association areas of the cortex [54].\n10A simple special case is when u:,:,t already is on a semantic level. This is the case in the medical application described in [49, 48] where u:,:,t describes procedures and diagnosis and one can think of fM p¨q as being an encoder system and f episodicp¨q as being a decoder and the complex as being an autoencoder [24, 70].\nFigure 10 (bottom right) also indicates a slow transfer to long-term episodic memory. The hypothesis is that the index neurons and their latent representation form the basis for episodic memory! Biologically, this is referred to as system consolidation, where hippocampus-dependent memories become independent of the hippocampus over a period of weeks to years. According to the standard model of memory consolidation [132, 51] memory is retained in the hippocampus for up to one week after initial learning, representing the hippocampus-dependent stage. Later the hippocampus representations of this information become active in explicit (conscious) recall or implicit (unconscious) recall like in sleep. During this stage the hippocampus is “teaching” the cortex more and more about the information and when the information is recalled it strengthens the cortico-cortical connection thus making the memory hippocampus-independent. Therefore from one week and beyond the initial training experience, the memory is slowly transferred to the neo-cortex where it becomes permanently stored. In this sense the MTL would act as a relay station for the various perceptual input that make up a memory and stores it as a whole event. After this has occurred the MTL directs information towards the neocortex to provide a permanent representation of the memory.\nIn our technical model we consider two mechanisms for the transfer: Index neurons generated in the hippocampus and their representation pattern might become part of the episodic memory, or neurons in the episodic memory are trained by replay: this teaching process would be performed by the activation of the time index neurons, which then activate the “sketchpad” aet which then trains the weight patterns of time index neurons in long-term episodic memory.\nAs events are transferred from the hippocampus to episodic memory, index neurons for places and entities and their latent representations would be consolidated in semantic long-term memory.\nThe frontal cortex, associated with higher functionalities, plays a role in which new information gets encoded as episodic and semantic memory and what gets forgotten [57].\nThe consolidation of memory might be guided by novelty, attention, and emotional significance. There is growing evidence that the amygdala is instrumental for storing emotionally significant memories. The amygdala belongs to the MTL and consists of several nuclei but is not considered to be a part of memory itself [26]. The amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex might also provide reward-related information to the hippocampus [118].\nIt has been shown in many studies that a loss of function of the hippocampus/MTL brain region leads to a loss of the consolidation of memory to episodic long-term memory, but that this loss does not affect semantic memory. Our model supports this hypothesis, since semantic memory only relies on the latent representation of subject, predicate, and object, whereas episodic memory also relies on a latent representation of time, i.e., aet ."

      "text" : "htimet is generated from sensory input and is the basis for episodic memory. For a semantic interpretation of sensory input and for a recall of episodic memory, htimet can be rapidly decoded by the semantic decoder shown in the center of Figure 10. As discussed in Sections 5 and 4, our model suggests that decoding happens by the generation of ps, p, oq-triples by a stochastic sampling procedure. Since a sensory input, in general, is described by several triples, this generation process is repeated several times, generating a number of ps, p, oq-triples. By sequential sampling, only one triples is active at a time and the ensemble of triples represents the query answer. Sequential sampling might also be influenced by attention mechanisms, e.g., in the decoding of complex scenes [145, 142, 77].\nThe proposed model can be related to encoder-decoder networks [135] which produce text sequences, whereas we produce a set of likely triples. fM p¨q would be the encoder, potentially with internal feedback loops, htimet would be the representation shared between encoder and decoder, and the semantic decoder in our proposed model would correspond to the decoder.\nA clear indication that a semantic decoding is happening quickly is that an individual can describe a scene verbally immediately after it has happened.11\nIn the past, a number of neural winner-takes-all networks have been proposed where the neuron with the largest activation wins over all other neurons, which are driven to inactivity [94, 69]. Due to the inherent noise in real spiking neurons, it is likely that winner-takes-all networks select one of the neurons with large activities, not necessarily the one with the largest activity. Thus winner-takesall sampling might be close to the sampling process specified in the theoretical model. One might speculate that a winner-tales-all operation is performed in the complex formed by the dentate gyrus and the region III of hippocampus proper (CA3). It is known that CA3 contains many feedback connections, essential for winner-takes-all computations [95, 56, 118]. CA3 is sometimes modelled as a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) with excitatory recurrent colateral connections and global inhibition [118].\nThe sampling denoises the scene interpretation. Each ps, p, oq-sample represents a sharp hypothesis; an advantage of the sampling approach is that no complex feedback mechanisms are required for the generation of attractors, as in other approaches.\nThe proposed sampling procedure is a step-wise procedure which generates independent samples. An alternative might be a Gibbs sampler which could be implemented as easily. The advantage of a Gibbs sampler is that it does not require marginalization; a disadvantage is that the generated samples are not independent. On the other hand, correlated samples might be the basis for free recall, associative thinking and chaining.\nFor association we can fix an entity s, generate its latent representation aes and then sample a new entity s1 based on this latent representation, thus, we can explore entities that are very similar to the original entity. Thus Barack Obama might produce Michelle Obama. During sampling the roles of subjects might be interchanged. Thus the triple (Obama, presidentof, USA) might produce samples describing properties and relationships of the USA.\nThe restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) might be an interesting option for supporting the decoding process [128, 66].\nAs discussed in the caption of Figure 10 it is even possible to operate the model in reverse: If we consider a person s to be the input, marginalize out p and o and consider htimet as the output, then we can recall when we met the person by exciting the time index neuron, and we can even recall her appearance by operating fM p¨q in reverse. According to our model the recall of episodic memory would be driven by an activation of the time latent representation aet , which is then semantically decoded and elucidates sensory impressions. This fits the subjective feeling of a reconstruction of past memory.\nM -mapping, prediction, and semantic decoding are fast operations possibly involving many parts of the cortex.12\nThe semantic coding and decoding in our proposed model might biologically be located in the MTL. There is growing evidence that the hippocampus plays an important role not just in encoding but also in decoding of memory and is involved in the retrieval of information from long-term memory [54]. The binding of items and cortex (BIC) theory states that the perirhinal cortex (anterior part of the parahippocampal region) connects to the “who” and what” pathways of unimodal sensory brain regions. In our model this information is decoded into ps, p, oq-triples. In contrast the “when” and “where” parts pass through the posterior part of the parahippocampal region. Both types of information then pass through the entorhinal cortex but only converge within the hippocampus where it enables a full recognition of an episodic event [45, 39, 115, 54]. The “what” pathway is involved in the anterior temporal (AT) system also involving parts of the temporal lobe (ventral temporopolar cortex) and is associated with semantic memory. The “where” pathway is part of the posterior\n11The language considered here is very simple and consists of triple statements. 12The physicist Eugene Wigner has speculated on the “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences” [144]; in other words mathematics is the right code for the natural sciences. Similarly, semantics might be considered the language for the world, in as far as humans are involved and one might speculate about its unreasonable effectiveness as well.\nmedial (PM) system also involving parts of the parietal cortex (retrospinal cortex) and is associated with semantic memory."

But what about semantic memory? In Section 3 (Figures 4 and Figures 6) we describe a semantic memory which is implemented as a separate indicator mapping function that is also based on the latent representations of subject, predicate and object.\nBiologically it might be quite challenging to transfer episodic memory into semantic memory. An alternative, with a number of interesting consequences, is that the semantic memory is generated from episodic memory by marginalizing time, as shown in the bottom of Figure 7. In this interpretation, semantic memory is a long-term storage for episodic memory. Thus to answer the query “what events happened at time t”, the system needs to retrieve aet and perform a semantic decoding into ps, p, oq-triples. In contrast, to decode a triple from semantic memory, aet is replaced with ā “ ř\nt aet , which can either be calculated by inputting a vectors of ones or by learning a long-term average (Figure 12(D)).13\nThis form of a semantic memory is very attractive since it requires no additional modelling effort and can use the same structures that are needed for episodic memory! It has been argued that semantic memory is information we have encountered repeatedly, so often that the actual learning episodes are blurred [32, 57]. A gradual transition from episodic to semantic memory can take place, in which episodic memory reduces its sensitivity and association to particular events, so that the information can be generalized as semantic memory. Without doubt, semantic and episodic memories support one another [61]. Thus some theories speculate that episodic memory may be the “gateway” to semantic memory [12, 131, 8, 133, 129, 97, 148, 86]. [98] is a recent overview on the topic. Our model would also support the alternative view of Tulving that episodic memory depends on the semantic memory, i.e., the representations of entities and predicates [141, 57]. But note that studies have also found an independent formation of semantic memories, in case that the episodic memory is dysfunctional, as in certain amnesic patients: Amnesic patients might learn new facts without remembering the episodes during which they have learned the information [54]. This phenomenon is supported by our proposed model since there is a direct path from sensory input to the representations of subject, predicate and object.\nOur model supports inductive inference in form of a probabilistic materialization. Certainly humans are capable of some form of logical inference, but this might be a faculty of working memory. The approximations that are performed in the tensor models, respectively in the the multiway neural networks, lead to a form of a probabilistic materialization, or unconscious inference: As an example, consider that we know that Max lives in Munich. The probabilistic materialization that happens in the factorization should already predict that Max also lives in Bavaria and in Germany. Thus both facts and inductively inferred facts about an entity are represented in its local environment. There is a certain danger in probabilistic materialization, since it might lead to overgeneralizations, reaching from national prejudice to false memories. In fact in many studies it has been shown that individuals produce false memories but are personally absolutely convinced of their truthfulness [117, 92].\nOur model assumes symmetrical connections between index neurons and representation neurons. The biological plausibility of symmetric weights has been discussed intensely in computational neuroscience and many biologically oriented models have that property [73, 69]. Reciprocal connectivity is abundant in the brain, but perfect symmetry is typically not observed."

      "text" : "An interesting feature of the proposed model is that no learning or adaptation is necessary in operation, as long as sensory information can be described by the entities and predicates already known. The only structural adaptation that happens online is the forming of the index neuron et and its representation pattern aet .\n13One can also easily be only considering semantic memory of a certain time span by just inputting ones for the time index neurons of interest.\nIf decoding is not successful, e.g., if the decoded triples have low likelihood, one might consider a mechanism for introducing new index neurons with new latent representations for entities and predicates not yet stored in memory. Thus, only when the available resources (entities and predicates) are insufficient for explaining the sensory data, new index neurons for entities and predicates are introduced.\nAt a slower time scale it might be necessary to fine-tune all parameters in the system, possibly also the latent representations for entities and predicates. One might look at the model in Figure 10 as a complex neural network with inputs u:,:,t and targets ps, p, oq, possibly with some recurrence via the prediction module. Powerful learning algorithms are available to train such a system in a supervised way, and this might be the solution in a technical application. Of course for a biological system, the target information is unavailable.\nSo how can such a complex system be trained without clear target information? The future prediction model can be trained to lead to high quality predictions of future sensory inputs [70, 36, 116, 81, 83, 137, 64, 55, 53]. For the remaining parameters we suggest a form of bootstrap learning: the model parameters should be adapted such that they lead to stable semantic interpretation of sensory input. We call this the semantic-attractor learning hypothesis: In a sense the semantic descriptions form attractors for decoded sensory data and, conversely, the attractors are adapted based on sensory data. This can be related to the phenomenon of “emergence” which is a process whereby larger patterns and regularities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities that themselves do not exhibit such properties. Thus the emerging semantics hypothesis is that the semantic description is an emergent property of the sensory inputs!"

Note that aes is not considered constant; for example, an individual might be diagnosed with a disease, which would be reflected in a change in aes . Large differences between predicted and sensory-decoded latent representations aet represent novelty and might be a component of an attention mechanism. As discussed before, novelty might be an important factor that determines which sensory information is stored in episodic memory, as speculated by other models and supported by cognitive studies [37, 75, 123, 53, 15].\nAn interesting aspect is that the predicted htimet can be semantically decoded for a cognitive analysis of predicted events (see Figure 10) and can lead to mental imagery, a sensory representation of predicted events. Mental imagery can be viewed as the conscious and explicit manipulation of simulations in working memory to predict future events [13]. The link between episodic memory and mental imagery has been studied in [122] and [65].\nIn Section 6 we discussed a predictive ARX model and an RNN model. In human cognition, both might be significant: The RNN would be part of the model dynamics, whereas the ARX model would purely serve as a predictive component.\nPrediction of events and actions on a semantic level is sometimes considered to be one of the important functions of a cognitive working memory [108]. Working memory is the limited-capacity store for retaining information over the short term and for performing mental operations on the contents of this store. As in our prediction model, the contents of working memory could either originate from sensory input, the episodic buffer, or from semantic memory [54]. Cognitive models of working memory are described in [12, 9, 11, 34, 47] and computational models are described in [100, 41, 50, 25, 76, 108].\nThe terms “predictive brain” and “anticipating brain” emphasize the importance of “looking into the future”, namely prediction, preparation, anticipation, prospection or expectations in various cognitive domains [29]. Prediction has been a central concept in recent trends in computational neuroscience, in particular in recent Bayesian approaches to brain modelling [70, 36, 116, 81, 83, 137, 64, 55, 53]. In some of these approaches, probabilistic generative models generate hypothesis about observations (top-down) assuming hidden causes, which are then aligned with actual observations (bottom-up).\nWorking memory is not the only brain structure involved in prediction. Predictive control is crucial for fast and ballistic movements where the cerebellum plays a crucial role in implicit tasks. The cerebellum is involved in trial-and-error learning based on predictive error signals [54]. Reward prediction is a task of the basal ganglia where dopamine neurons encode both present rewards and future rewards, as a basis for reinforcement learning [54, 57].\nWorking memory, assumed to be located in the frontal cortex, can use the representations in Figure 10 in many ways, not just for prediction. In general, working memory is closely tied to complex problem solving, planning, organizing, and decision support, and might assume an important role in consciousness. There is evidence that a strong working memory is associated with general intelligence [57].\nOne influential cognitive model of working memory is Baddeleys multicomponent model [12]. Cognitive control is executed by a central executive system. It is supported by two subsystems responsible for maintenance and rehearsal: the phonological loop, which maintains verbal information and the visuospatial sketchpad, which maintains visual and spatial information. More recently the episodic buffer has been added to the model. The episodic buffer integrates short-term and longterm memory, holding and manipulating a limited amount of information from multiple domains in time and spatially sequenced episodes (Figure 1). There is an emerging consensus that functions of working memory are located in the prefrontal cortex and that a number of other brain areas are recruited [109, 54]. More precisely, the central executive is attributed to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the phonological loop with the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (the semantic information is anterior to the phonological information) and the visuospatial sketchpad in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex [57]. The function of the frontal lobe, in particular of the orbitofrontal cortex, includes the ability to project future consequences (predictions) resulting from current actions [57]."

      "heading" : "8 Conclusions and Discussion",
      "text" : "We have discussed how a number of technical memory functions can be realized by representation learning and we have made the connection to human memory. A key assumption is that a knowledge graph does not need to be stored explicitly, but only latent representations of generalized entities need to be stored from which the knowledge graph can be reconstructed and inductive inference can be performed (tensor memory hypothesis). Thus, in contrast to the knowledge graph, where an entity is represented by a single node in a graph and its links, in embedding learning, an entity has a distributed representation in form of a latent vector, i.e., in form of multiple latent components. Unique representations lead to a global propagation of information across all memory functions during learning [104].\nWe proposed that the latent representation for a time t, which summarizes all sensory information present at time t, is the basis for episodic memory and that semantic memory depends on the latent representations of subject, predicate, and object. One theory we support is that semantic memory is a long-term aggregation of episodic memory. The full episodic experience depends on both semantic (“who” and “what”) and context representations (“where” and “when”). On the other hand there is also a certain independence: the pure storage of episodic memory does not depend on semantic memory and semantic memory can be acquired even without a functioning episodic memory. The same relationships between semantic and episodic memories can be found in the human brain.\nThe latent representations of the semantic memory, episodic memory, and sensory memory can support working memory functions like prediction and decision support. In addition to the latent representations, the models contain parameters (e.g., neural network weights) in mapping functions, memory models and prediction models. One can make a link between those parameters and implicit skill memory [121]. Refining the mapping from sensory input to its latent representation corresponds to perceptual learning in cognition.\nWe showed how both a recall of previous memories and the mental imagery of future events and sensory impressions can be supported by the presented model.\nMore details on concrete technical solutions can be found in [48, 49] where we also present successful applications to clinical decision modeling, sensor network modeling and recommendation engines."

    "abstractText" : "Embedding learning, a.k.a. representation learning, has been shown to be able to model large-scale semantic knowledge graphs. A key concept is a mapping of the knowledge graph to a tensor representation whose entries are predicted by models using latent representations of generalized entities. Latent variable models are well suited to deal with the high dimensionality and sparsity of typical knowledge graphs. In recent publications the embedding models were extended to also consider time evolutions, time patterns and subsymbolic representations. In this paper we map embedding models, which were developed purely as solutions to technical problems for modelling temporal knowledge graphs, to various cognitive memory functions, in particular to semantic and concept memory, episodic memory, sensory memory, short-term memory, and working memory. We discuss learning, query answering, the path from sensory input to semantic decoding, and the relationship between episodic memory and semantic memory. We introduce a number of hypotheses on human memory that can be derived from the developed mathematical models. There are four main hypotheses. The first one is that semantic memory is described as triples and that episodic memory is described as triples in time. A second main hypothesis is that generalized entities have unique latent representations which are shared across memory functions and that are the basis for prediction, decision support and other functionalities executed by working memory (tensor memory hypothesis). A third main hypothesis is that the latent representation for a time t, which summarizes all sensory information available at time t, is the basis for episodic memory. Finally, our proposed model suggests that semantic memory and episodic memory depend on each other: Episodic decoding depends on semantic memory and semantic memory is developed as a long term store of episodic memory. On the other hand there is also a certain independence: the pure storage of episodic memory does not depend on semantic memory and semantic memory can be acquired even without a functioning episodic memory. The same relationships between semantic and episodic memories can be found in the human brain.",
