      "text" : "Image captioning, the task of automatically describing the content of an image with natural language, has attracted increasingly interests in computer vision. It is interesting because it aims at endowing machines with one of the core human intelligence to understand the huge amount of visual information and to express it in natural language.\nRecent state-of-the-art approaches [3, 44, 30, 17, 7, 46, 15, 48, 43] follow an encoder-decoder framework to generate captions for the images. They generally employ convolutional neural networks to encode the visual information and utilize recurrent neural networks to decode that infor-\n∗This work was done when the author was at Snap Inc.\nmation to coherent sentences. During training and inference, they try to maximize the probability of the next word based on recurrent hidden state.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel decision-making framework for image captioning. Instead of learning a sequential recurrent model to greedily look for the next correct word, we utilize a “policy network” and a “value network” to jointly determine the next best word at each time step. The policy network, which provides the confidence of predicting the next word according to current state, serves as a local guidance. The value network, that evaluates the reward value of all possible extensions of the current state, serves as a global and lookahead guidance. Such value network adjusts the goal of predicting the correct words towards the goal of generating captions that are similar to ground truth captions. Our framework is able to include the good words that are with low probability to be drawn by using the policy network alone. Figure 1 shows an example to illustrate the proposed framework. The word holding is not among the top choices of our policy network at current\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n03 89\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n2 A\npr 2\n01 7\nstep. But our value network goes forward for one step to the state supposing holding is generated and evaluates how good such state is for the goal of generating a good caption in the end. The two networks complement each other and are able to choose the word holding.\nTo learn the policy and value networks, we use deep reinforcement learning with embedding reward. We begin by pretraining a policy network using standard supervised learning with cross entropy loss, and by pretraining a value network with mean squared loss. Then, we improve the policy and value networks by deep reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning has been widely used in gaming [38], control theory [32], etc. The problems in control or gaming have concrete targets to optimize by nature, whereas defining an appropriate optimization goal is nontrivial for image captioning. In this paper, we propose to train using an actor-critic model [21] with reward driven by visualsemantic embedding [11, 19, 36, 37]. Visual-semantic embedding, which provides a measure of similarity between images and sentences, can measure the correctness of generated captions and serve as a reasonable global target to optimize for image captioning in reinforcement learning.\nWe conduct detailed analyses on our framework to understand its merits and properties. Extensive experiments on the Microsoft COCO dataset [29] show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches consistently across different evaluation metrics, including BLEU [34], Meteor [25], Rouge [28] and CIDEr [42]. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n• We present a novel decision-making framework for image captioning utilizing a policy network and a value network. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MS COCO dataset. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that applies decisionmaking framework to image captioning.\n• To learn our policy and value networks, we introduce an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm driven by visual-semantic embedding. Our experiments suggest that the supervision from embedding generalizes well across different evaluation metrics."

      "text" : "Many image captioning approaches have been proposed in the literature. Early approaches tackled this problem using bottom-up paradigm [10, 23, 27, 47, 24, 8, 26, 9], which first generated descriptive words of an image by object recognition and attribute prediction, and then combined them by language models. Recently, inspired by the successful use of neural networks in machine translation [4], the encoder-decoder framework [3, 44, 30, 17, 7, 46, 15, 48, 43] has been brought to image captioning. Researchers\nadopted such framework because “translating” an image to a sentence was analogous to the task in machine translation. Approaches following this framework generally encoded an image as a single feature vector by convolutional neural networks [22, 6, 39, 41], and then fed such vector into recurrent neural networks [14, 5] to generate captions. On top of it, various modeling strategies have been developed. Karpathy and Fei-Fei [17], Fang et al. [9] presented methods to enhance their models by detecting objects in images. To mimic the visual system of humans [20], spatial attention [46] and semantic attention [48] were proposed to direct the model to attend to the meaningful fine details. Dense captioning [16] was proposed to handle the localization and captioning tasks simultaneously. Ranzato et al. [35] proposed a sequence-level training algorithm.\nDuring inference, most state-of-the-art methods employ a common decoder mechanism using greedy search or beam search. Words are sequentially drawn according to local confidence. Since they always predict the words with top local confidence, such mechanism can miss good words at early steps which may lead to bad captions. In contrast, in addition to the local guidance, our method also utilizes a global and lookahead guidance to compensate such errors."

Reinforcement learning [45, 21, 40, 31], known as “a machine learning technique concerning how software agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward”, is well suited for the task of decisionmaking. Recently, professional-level computer Go program was designed by Silver et al. [38] using deep neural networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search. Human-level gaming control [32] was achieved through deep Q-learning. A visual navigation system [49] was proposed recently based on actor-critic reinforcement learning model.\nDecision-making framework has not been applied to image captioning. One previous work in text generation [35] has used REINFORCE [45] to train its model by directly optimizing a user-specified evaluation metric. Such metricdriven approach [35] is hard to generalize to other metrics. To perform well across different metrics, it needs to be re-trained for each one in isolation. In this paper, we propose a training method using actor-critic reinforcement learning [21] driven by visual-semantic embedding [11, 19], which performs well across different evaluation metrics without re-training. Our approach shows significant performance improvement over [35]. Moreover, we use a decision-making framework to generate captions, while [35] follows the existing encoder-decoder framework."

It is similar to the basic image captioning model [44] used in the encoderdecoder framework. As shown in Figure 2, firstly we use CNNp to encode the visual information of image I.

As the hidden state ht ∈ Rm of RNNp evolves over time t, the policy at each time step to take an\naction at is provided.

We propose to utilize visual-semantic embedding similarities as the reward.\nVisual-semantic embedding has been successfully applied to image classification [11, 37], retrieval [19, 36, 33], etc. Our embedding model is comprised of a CNN, a RNN and a linear mapping layer, denoted as CNNe, RNNe and fe. By learning the mapping of images and sentences into one semantic embedding space, it provides a measure of similarity between images and sentences. Given a sentence S, its embedding feature is represented using the last hidden state of RNNe, i.e., h′T (S). Let v denote the feature vector of image I extracted by CNNe, and fe(·) is the mapping function from image features to the embedding space. We train the embedding model using the same image-sentence pairs as in image captioning. We fix the CNNe weight, and learn the RNNe weights as well as fe(·) using a bidirectional ranking loss defined as follows: Le= ∑ v ∑ S− max(0, β−fe(v) · h′T (S)+fe(v) · h′T (S−))\n+ ∑ S ∑ v− max(0, β−h′T (S) · fe(v)+h′T (S) · fe(v−)) (6)\nwhere β is the margin cross-validated, every (v, S) are a ground truth image-sentence pair, S− denotes a negative description for the image corresponding to v, and vice-versa with v−.\nGiven an image with feature v∗, we define the reward of a generated sentence Ŝ to be the embedding similarity between Ŝ and v∗:\nr = fe(v ∗) · h′T (Ŝ) ‖fe(v∗)‖‖h′T (Ŝ)‖\n(7)"

      "heading" : "3.3. Training using deep reinforcement learning",
      "text" : "Following [38], we learn pπ and vθ in two steps. In the first step, we train the policy network pπ using standard supervised learning with cross entropy loss, where the loss function is defined as Lp′ = −log p(w1, ..., wT |I;π) = −∑Tt=1 log pπ(at|st). And we train the value network by minimizing the mean squared loss, ||vθ(si) − r||2 where r is the final reward of the generated sentence and si denotes a randomly selected state in the generating process. For one generated sentence, successive states are strongly correlated, differing by just one word, but the regression target is shared for each entire captioning process. Thus, we randomly sample one single state from each distinct sentence, to prevent overfitting.\nIn the second step, we train pπ and vθ jointly using deep reinforcement learning (RL). The parameters of our agent\nare represented by Θ = {π, θ}, and we learn Θ by maximizing the total reward the agent can expect when interacting with the environment: J(Θ) = Es1...T∼pπ ( ∑T t=1 rt). As rt = 0 ∀ 0 < t < T and rT = r, J(Θ) = Es1...T∼pπ (r). Maximizing J exactly is non-trivial since it involves an expectation over the high-dimensional interaction sequences which may involve unknown environment dynamics in turn. Viewing the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process, however, allows us to bring techniques from the RL literature to bear: As shown in [45, 40, 31], a sample approximation to the gradient is:\n∇πJ ≈ T∑ t=1 ∇πlog pπ(at|st) (r − vθ(st)) (8) ∇θJ = ∇θvθ(st) (r − vθ(st)) (9)\nHere the value network vθ serves as a moving baseline. The subtraction with the evaluation of value network leads to a much lower variance estimate of the policy gradient. The quantity r − vθ(st) used to scale the gradient can be seen as an estimate of the advantage of action at in state st. This approach can be viewed as an actor-critic architecture where the policy pπ is the actor and vθ is the critic.\nHowever, reinforcement learning in image captioning is hard to train, because of the large action space comparing to other decision-making problems. The action space of image captioning is in the order of 103 which equals the vocabulary size, while that of visual navigation in [49] is only 4, which indicates four directions to go. To handle this problem, we follow [35] to apply curriculum learning [1] to train our actor-critic model. In order to gradually teach the model to produce stable sentences, we provide training samples with gradually more difficulty: iteratively we fix the first (T − i ×∆) words with cross entropy loss and let the actor-critic model train with the remaining i×∆ words, for i = 1, 2, ..., until reinforcement learning is used to train the whole sentence. Please refer to [35] for details."

      "heading" : "3.4. Lookahead inference with policy network and",
      "text" : "value network\nOne of the key contributions of the proposed decisionmaking framework over existing framework lies in the inference mechanism. For decision-making problems, the inference is guided by a local guidance and a global guidance, e.g., AlphaGo [38] utilized MCTS to combine both guidances. For image captioning, we propose a novel lookahead inference mechanism that combines the local guidance of policy network and the global guidance of value network. The learned value network provides a lookahead evaluation for each decision, which can complement the policy network and collaboratively generate captions.\nBeam Search (BS) is the most prevalent method for decoding in existing image captioning approaches, which\nstores the top-B highly scoring candidates at each time step. Here B is the beam width. Let us denote the set of B sequences held by BS at time t as Wdte = {w1,dte, ...,wB,dte}, where each sequence are the generated words until then, wb,dte = {wb,1, ..., wb,t}. At each time step t, BS considers all possible single word extensions of these beams, given by the setWt+1 = Wdte × Y , and selects the top-B most scoring extensions as the new beam sequences Wdt+1e:\nWdt+1e= argtopB wb,dt+1e∈Wt+1 S(wb,dt+1e), s.t. wi,dt+1e 6=wj,dt+1e\nwhere operator argtopB denotes the obtaining top-B operation that is implemented by sorting the B × |Y| members of Wt+1, and S(·) denotes the scoring function of a generated sequence. In existing BS of image captioning, S(·) is the log-probability of the generated sequence. However, such scoring function may miss good captions because it assumes that the log-probability of every word in a good caption must be among top choices. This is not necessarily true. Analogously, in AlphaGo not every move is with top probability. It is beneficial to sometimes allow some actions with low probability to be selected as long as the final reward is optimized.\nTo this end, we propose a lookahead inference that combines the policy network and value network to consider all options in Wt+1. It executes each action by taking both the current policy and the lookahead reward evaluation into consideration, i.e.,\nS(wb,dt+1e) = S({wb,dte, wb,t+1}) (10) = S(wb,dte) + λ log pπ(at|st) + (1− λ) vθ({st, wb,t+1})\nwhere S(wb,dt+1e) is the score of extending the current sequence wb,dte with a wordwb,t+1, log pπ(at|st) denotes the confidence of policy network to predictwb,t+1 as extension, and vθ({st, wb,t+1}) denotes the evaluation of value network for the state supposingwb,t+1 is generated. 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 is a hyperparameter combining policy and value network that we will analyze experimentally in Section 4.5."

For fair comparison, we adopt the commonly used splits proposed in [17], which use 82,783 images for training, 5,000 images for validation, and 5,000 images for testing. Each image is given at least five captions by different AMT workers. We follow [17] to preprocess the captions (i.e. building dictionaries, tokenizing the captions).\nNetwork architecture As shown in Figure 2 and 3, our policy network, value network both contain a CNN and a RNN. We adopt the same CNN and RNN architectures for them, but train them independently. We use VGG-16 [39] as our CNN architecture and LSTM [14] as our RNN architecture. The input node dimension and the hidden state dimension of LSTM are both set to be 512, i.e., m = n = 512. There are many CNN, RNN architectures in the literature, e.g., ResNet [12], GRU [5], etc. Some of them have reported better performance than the ones we use. We do not use the latest architecture for fair comparison with existing methods. In our value network, we use a three-layer MLP that regresses to a scalar reward value, with a 1024-dim and a 512-dim hidden layers in between. In Figure 3, a state st is represented by concatenating the visual and semantic features. The visual feature is a 512-dim embedded feature, mapped from the 4096-dim CNNv output. The semantic feature is the 512-dim hidden state of RNNv at the last time step. Thus, the dimension of st is 1024.\nVisual-semantic embedding Visual-semantic embedding can measure the similarity between images and sentences by mapping them to the same space. We followed [19] to use VGG-16 [39] as CNNe and GRU [5] as RNNe. The image feature v in Equation 6 is extracted from the last 4096-dim layer of VGG-16. The input node dimension and the hidden state dimension of GRU are set as 300 and 1024. fe(·) is a 4096×1024 linear mapping layer. The margin β in Equation 6 is set as 0.2.\nTraining details In training, we use Adam [18] algorithm to do model updating. It is worth noting that, other than using the pretrained VGG-16 model, we only use the images and captions provided in the dataset to train our networks and embedding, without any external data. We set ∆ in curriculum learning as 2. In testing, a caption is formed by drawing words sequentially until a special end token is reached, using the proposed lookahead inference mechanism. We do not use ensemble of models."

It makes their results incomparable to other methods that do not use extra training data. Surprisingly, even without external training data, our method outperforms [48, 13]. Comparing to methods other than [48, 13], our approach shows significant improvements in all the metrics except Bleu-1 in which our method ranks the second. Bleu1 is related to single word accuracy, the performance gap of Bleu-1 between our method and [46] may be due to different preprocessing for word vocabularies. MIXER [35] is a metric-driven trained method. A model trained with Bleu-4 using [35] is hard to generalize to other metrics. Our embedding-driven decision-making approach performs well in all metrics. Especially, considering our policy network shown in Figure 2 is based on a mechanism similar to the very basic image captioning model similar to Google NIC [44], such significant improvement over [44] validates the effectiveness of the proposed decision-making framework that utilizes both policy and value networks. Moreover, the proposed framework is modular w.r.t. the network design. Other powerful mechanisms such as spatial attention, semantic attention can be directly integrated into our policy network and further improve our performance.\nSince the proposed embedding-driven decision-making framework is very different from existing methods, we want to perform insightful analyses and answer the following questions: 1) How powerful is embedding? Is the performance gain more because of the framework or embedding\nalone? 2) How important is lookahead inference? 3) How important is reinforcement learning in the framework? 4) Why the value network is designed as in Figure 3? 5) How sensitive is the method to hyperparameter λ and beam size?

To evaluate the impact of embedding, we incorporate SL with embedding as follows: in the last step of beam search of SL, when a beam of candidate captions are generated, we rank those candidates according to their embedding similarities with the test image other than their log-probabilities, and finally output the one with highest embedding score. This baseline is named as (SL-Embed).

The proposed embedding-driven decision-making framework is the merit of our method. 2. By using lookahead inference, SL-RawVN is much better than the SL baseline. This validates the importance of the proposed lookahead inference that utilizes both local and global guidance. 3. After reinforcement learning, our Full-model performs better than the SL-RawVN. This validates the importance of using embedding-driven actor-critic learning for model training.\nWe show some qualitative captioning results of our method and the SL baseline in Figure 4. GT stands for ground truth caption. In the first three columns, we compare our method and SL baseline. As we see, our method is better at recognizing key objects that are easily missed by SL, e.g., the snowboard and umbrellas in the first column images. Besides, our method can reduce the chance of generating incorrect word and accumulating errors, e.g., we generate the word eating other than sitting for the image in the lower second column. Moreover, thanks to the global guidance, our method is better at generating correct captions at global level, e.g., we can recognize the airplane\nand painting for the images in the third column. Finally, we show two failure cases of our method in the last column, in which cases we fail to understand some important visual contents that only take small portions of the images. This may be due to our policy network architecture. Adding more detailed visual modeling techniques such as detection and attention can alleviate such problem in the future."

In this section, we analyze their sensitivity to answer question 5) above.\nIn Table 3, we show the evaluation of λ’s impact on our method. As in Equation 10, λ is a hyperparameter combining policy and value networks in lookahead inference, 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. λ = 0 means we only use value network to guide our lookahead inference; while λ = 1 means we only use policy network, which is identical to beam search. As shown in Table 3, the best performance is when λ = 0.4. As λ goes down from 0.4 to 0 or goes up from 0.4 to 1, overall the performance drops monotonically. This validates the importance of both networks; we should not emphasize too much on either network in lookahead inference. Besides, λ = 0 performs much worse than λ = 1. This is because policy network provides local guidance, which is very important in sequential prediction. Thus, in lookahead inference, it is too weak if we only use global guidance, i.e. value network in our approach.\nIn Table 4, we provide the evaluation of different beam sizes’ impact on SL baseline and our full model. As discovered in previous work such as [17], the image captioning performance becomes worse as the beam size gets larger. We validate such discovery for existing encoder-decoder framework. As shown in the upper half of Table 4, we test our SL baseline with 5 different beam sizes from 5 to 100.\nNote that SL is based on beam search, which follows the encoder-decoder framework as most existing approaches. As we see, the impact of beam size on SL is relatively big. It’s mainly because that as we increase the beam size, bad word candidates are more likely to be drawn into the beam, since the confidence provided by the sequential word generator is only consider local information.\nOn the other hand, as shown in the lower part of Table 4, our method is less sensitive to beam sizes. The performance variations between different beam sizes are fairly small. We argue that this is because of the proposed lookahead inference that considers both policy and value networks. With local and global guidances, our framework is more robust and stable to policy mistakes."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this work, we present a novel decision-making framework for image captioning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark. Different from previous encoder-decoder framework, our method utilizes a policy network and a value network to generate captions. The policy network serves as a local guidance and the value network serves as a global and lookahead guidance. To learn both networks, we use an actor-critic reinforcement learning approach with novel visual-semantic embedding rewards. We conduct detailed analyses on our framework to understand its merits and properties. Our future works include improving network architectures and investigating the reward design by considering other embedding measures."

    "abstractText" : "Image captioning is a challenging problem owing to the complexity in understanding the image content and diverse ways of describing it in natural language. Recent advances in deep neural networks have substantially improved the performance of this task. Most state-of-the-art approaches follow an encoder-decoder framework, which generates captions using a sequential recurrent prediction model. However, in this paper, we introduce a novel decision-making framework for image captioning. We utilize a “policy network” and a “value network” to collaboratively generate captions. The policy network serves as a local guidance by providing the confidence of predicting the next word according to the current state. Additionally, the value network serves as a global and lookahead guidance by evaluating all possible extensions of the current state. In essence, it adjusts the goal of predicting the correct words towards the goal of generating captions similar to the ground truth captions. We train both networks using an actor-critic reinforcement learning model, with a novel reward defined by visual-semantic embedding. Extensive experiments and analyses on the Microsoft COCO dataset show that the proposed framework outperforms state-ofthe-art approaches across different evaluation metrics.",
