INTRODUCTION\nACOUSTIC modeling with deep learning has demon-strated remarkable performance improvements in automatic speech recognition [1]–[4]. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are trained to label each frame of processed speech data with the state of a hidden Markov model (HMM). However, there is a difficulty due to the fact that acoustic features vary widely in frequency and articulation rate depending on harmonics of the vocal tract and characteristic speaking styles.\nEfforts to effectively handle these variations can be categorized into feature-level and model-level approaches. Amongst feature-level approaches, speaker-adapted methods such as fMLLR [5] have been proposed. Acoustic features concatenated with i-vectors, which represent speaker information, also have been employed as input for DNNs [6], [7]. Model-level approaches have employed hybrid NN-HMM systems with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [8]–[10] and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [11]–[13].\nIn particular, CNNs have advantages in terms of capturing local features through weight sharing while remaining robust to slight translations of these features through pooling.\nThis work was supported by the ICT R& D program of MSIP IITP.

(e-mail: shoh@mokwon.ac.kr)\nStructural advantages of CNNs enable the modeling of speech data without feature-level engineering, such as spectrograms or mel filter-banks. Previous researchers introduced time-delayed neural networks (TDNNs), which are CNNs with convolutions along the time axis to learn the temporal dynamics of features [14]–[16]. Other researchers have applied convolutions along the frequency axis to attain invariance to frequency-shifts [8], [17]. However, acoustic features of speech vary in frequency, so that weight sharing along the frequency axis may not be appropriate. The limited weight sharing method in which weights are convolved only within a subsection of frequencybands has been employed in efforts to overcome this problem [10]. However, settling on appropriate band divisions and filters will require further work.\nOne limitation common to the preceding approaches is that most of them have employed only one or two convolution and pooling layers. Another limitation is that the relationship or topography of filters trained in supervised learning has not been intensively investigated. For unsupervised feature extraction, previous researchers imposed sparsity terms over small groups or neighborhoods in feature maps of image [18]– [20] and speech data [21], [22]. They attained topographicallyorganized maps of smoothly varying oriented edge filters or tonotopic disordered topography of spectrotemporal features, such as those found in the primary visual or auditory cortex (V1, A1) respectively.\nIn this paper, we argue that convolution along the time axis is more effective than along the frequency axis for acoustic models. In order that the network learns temporal dynamics adequately, we increase the depth of convolution layers that have small filters. Instead of frequency-axis convolution and pooling, we propose the addition of a convolutional maxout layer, namely an intermap pooling (IMP) layer in order to increase robustness to spectral variations. Previously, a convolutional maxout network has been proposed [23], however, it applied convolutions along the frequency axis. We show that the IMP CNNs with the time convolution reduce the word error rates more. As a result, the IMP CNNs can both model temporal dynamics and remain robust to spectral variations."

      "text" : "CNNs consist of the alternation of convolution and pooling layers, and fully connected layers in the top-most layer. Let H\n(l) stand for input to the lth convolution layer having K filters, with the kth convolution filter denoted W(l)\nk ∈ RM×N×G\nwith M and N denoting a filters height and width respectively, and G designating the number of feature maps of the input.\n2 A bias term b(l) k\nis shared inside the kth feature map. Thus, from any input H(l), the output H̃(l+1) ∈ RI×J×K can be calculated as\nH̃ (l+1) (i,j,k) = f((H(l) ∗W (l) k )(i,j) + b (l) k )\n(for 1 ≤ i ≤ I, 1 ≤ j ≤ J), (1)\nwhere I and J are height and width of each output feature map, and f is a non-linear function such as sigmoid or rectified linear unit (ReLU).\nAn intramap pooling layer, typically called “max-pooling”, propagates the maximum value from each sub-region in each feature map. For non-overlapping sub-regions with height p and width q, the output from this pooling layer is given by\nH (l) (i,j,k)\n= max α=−p+1,...,0 β=−q+1,...,0\nH̃ (l) (ip+α,jq+β,k) . (2)\nIntramap pooling layers have blurring effects on feature maps, with the result being that the CNN is more robust to locally translated features.\nIII. INTERMAP POOLING LAYERS\nThere are several categories of acoustic features such as harmonics, formants, and on/offsets (i.e., start and end points of speech). Spectral variations of acoustic features appear as shifts in the frequency axis over time (spectro-temporal modulation). In order to ensure the robustness of our model to spectral variations, we propose the addition of a convolutional maxout layer, the intermap pooling (IMP) layer. Like the maxout networks [24], this layer groups the filters, and pools the feature maps inside a group.\nSpecifically, an intermap pooling layer partitions feature maps into a set of groups. Then each group propagates the maximum activation value at each position. Formally, the output of the kth group consisting of r consecutive feature maps is given by\nH (l) (i,j,k)\n= max γ=−r+1,...,0\nH̃ (l) (i,j,kr+γ) . (3)\nThe structural comparison of intermap and intramap pooling layers is shown in Fig.1. Note that the method pursued in this paper does not introduce any additional learning terms except for the intermap grouping of filters.\nThe central idea to the IMP CNN is that the filters in each group learn common but spectrally variant features, such as frequency-shifted harmonics, and the pooled feature map is invariant to those feature variations within the group. The pooled feature maps H(l) are representative of the feature maps in each group. Through supervised learning, the pooled feature maps become discriminative of features for recognizing phonemes. For a phoneme, since spectral variations among different speakers and utterances are not discriminative information, the individual filters in a group spontaneously represent common but spectrally variant features, even though the layer does not ensure this."

The pooling size is denoted as ‘(the freq. axis):(the time axis):(the feature axis)’. The convolution input is padded with zeros at both ends in the time axis in order to preserve frame length after convolutions.\ntime axis is reasonable. However, sharing filters along the frequency axis may not be suitable, because features within lower frequency-band regions are significantly different from those in the higher regions. Instead of convolution along the frequency axis, our architecture employs an intermap pooling layer following the first convolution layer. This approach demonstrates robustness not only to frequency-shifted features but also to spectro-temporally distorted features. Moreover, it does not require engineered efforts to consider the varying characteristics of different frequency-bands.\nA sufficiently deep depth of convolution and pooling layers is necessary to precisely represent complex acoustic features with temporal and spectral variations. Individual frames also should be labeled as minutely as the number of HMM states, which is more than thousands in tri-phone modeling. However, context windowed inputs are too tiny (e.g., 21 frames) and stacking multiple intramap pooling layers decreases the feature map size in proportion to the pooling size, thereby restricting the depth of CNNs. Since, previous researchers have chosen large convolution filter and intramap pooling sizes, sufficient increases in depths of CNNs have not been realized.\nAs illustrated in Fig.1, the IMP CNN architecture applies convolution and intramap pooling layers only along the time axis. The pooling size of the intramap pooling layers is small so that it does not decrease temporal resolution much. Furthermore, motivated by the performance of very deep CNNs [25], we inserted convolution layers with small filters (of size 1x3) between two intramap pooling layers. The combination of filters before pooling layers increases non-linearity, and this results in a network that has rich feature expressions."

We used 40-dimensional log-mel filter bank features without the energy coefficient, and concatenated frames with a context window size of 21 (±10 frames) to feed them into networks as inputs. We trained the GMM-HMM system over fMLLR features. The forced alignment of each frame by the GMM-HMM baseline system is the target label of the neural networks.\nAfter random initialization of weights and biases from the Gaussian distribution N (0,0.01) and N (0,0.5) respectively, the CNNs were optimized by the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. In particular, for CNNs deeper than 9-layers, we faced with infeasible training, because each layer backpropagates errors by multiplying its small initial weights, resulting in vanishing gradients. Therefore, we increased the standard deviation (σ) of the Gaussian distribution in lower layers. Each layer is trained with a momentum of 0.9, an L2-decay term of 0.0005, and mini-batch size of 512. After one epoch of training, the trained model is accepted if the validation cost decreases. Otherwise, the trained model is rejected and training starts again from the latest accepted model with a halved learning rate. The initial learning rate is 0.01, and the training stops after 50 epochs. Our implementation is developed upon the KALDI toolkit [28].\nFor the SWBD task, we decode speech using a trigram language model (LM) of 30k vocabularies which is trained on 3M words, and then we rescore the decoding results using 4- gram LM which is trained on Fisher English Part 1 transcripts [29]. For the WSJ and Aurora4 corpus, we used a 146K word extended dictionary and the trigram pruned language model which is exactly the same as the ‘s5 ’recipe in the KALDI."

(3) The on/off-set detecting filters are temporally selective, but are also sensitive to several frequencies. (4) The features of Gabor-like filters are centered on some frequency-bands, which presumably detect formants. (5) The features of formant changes are directional diagonal lines, spectrotemporal modulations, in the middle frequency-bands. Note that different features appear in different frequency-bands, and that local features of each type have different bandwidth sizes.\nThe trained filters in each group of the intermap pooling layer are presented in Fig.4 (b). Importantly, most filters in a group belong to a common category. For example, the filters in harmonic extractor and formant change detector groups have marginally shifted features on the frequency axis. This figure verifies that the intermap pooling lead the filters of a group to extract common but spectrally variant features, although there are no additional architectural constraints to guarantee this.\nThe consecutive trained filters of the IMPO layer are drawn in Fig. 4(c). The filters form a 1-dimensional topological map, where neighboring filters respond to similar spectrotemporal features. Along the topological map axis, filters appear discontinuously between feature categories, reflecting the fact that feature categories become definitely distinguishable to the system as it is trained. In recent neurophysiological studies, there is consensus that multiple tonotopic maps exist in the human auditory system [30]. However, few studies suggest that this topography includes other sound features, such as temporal, spectral, and joint modulations [31]–[33]. The trained topography may provide a clue as to how human auditory neurons organize to efficiently process information in A1."

However, this is inappropriate with regard to the fact that acoustic features vary in frequency. In this paper, we contend that convolution along the time axis is more effective. We also propose the addition of an intermap pooling (IMP) layer to deep CNNs. In this layer, filters in each group extract common but spectrally variant features, then the layer pools the feature maps of each group. As a result, the proposed IMP CNN can achieve insensitivity to spectral variations characteristic of different speakers and utterances. The effectiveness of the IMP CNN architecture is demonstrated on several LVCSR tasks. Even without speaker adaptation techniques, the architecture achieved a WER of 12.7% on the SWB part of the Hub5’2000 evaluation test set, which is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.",
