      "text" : "Recent progress in deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) has considerably changed the landscape of computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012a) and NLP (Bahdanau et al., 2014). However, a state-of-the-art DCNN usually has a lot of parameters and high computational complexity, which both impedes its application in embedded devices and slows down the iteration of its research and development. For example, the training process of a DCNN may take up to weeks on a modern multiGPU server for large datasets like ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). In light of this, substantial research efforts are invested in speeding up DCNNs at both run-time and training-time, on both general-purpose (Vanhoucke et al., 2011; Gong et al., 2014; Han et al., 2015b) and specialized computer hardware (Farabet et al., 2011; Pham et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014a;b). Various approaches like quantization (Wu et al., 2015) and sparsification (Han et al., 2015a) have also been proposed. Recent research efforts (Courbariaux et al., 2014; Kim & Smaragdis, 2016; Rastegari et al., 2016; Li & Liu, 2016; Merolla et al., 2016) have considerably reduced both model size and computation complexity by using low bitwidth weights and low bitwidth activations. In particular, in BNN (Courbariaux & Bengio, 2016) and XNOR-Net (Rastegari et al., 2016), both weights and input activations of convolutional layers are binarized. Hence during the forward pass the most computationally expensive convolutions can be done by XNORbitcount kernel, thanks to the following equivalence which computes the dot product of two\n1We are preparing a demo for CVPR ’16 on behalf of Megvii Inc., based on this work.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n06 16\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.N E\n] 2\n0 Ju\nn 20\n16\nbit vectors x and y: ∑ i xiyi = bitcount(xnor(xi, yi)), xi, yi ∈ {0, 1} ∀i. (1)\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has succeeded in quantizing gradients to numbers with bitwidth less than 8 during the backward pass, while still achieving comparable prediction accuracy. In some previous research (Gupta et al., 2015; Courbariaux et al., 2014), convolutions involve at least 10-bit numbers. In BNN and XNOR-Net, though weights are binarized, gradients are in full precision, therefore the backward-pass still requires convolution between 1-bit numbers and 32-bit floating-points. As training a neural network involves both forward pass and backward pass, the inability to exploit bit convolution during the backward pass means that backward time of BNN and XNOR-Net would be much longer than their forward time. This paper makes the following contributions:\n1. We generalize the method of binarized neural networks to allow creating DoReFaNet, a CNN that has arbitrary bit-width in weights, activations, and even gradients. As convolutions during forward/backward passes can then operate on low bit weights and activations/gradients respectively, DoReFa-Net can use bit convolution kernels to accelerate its training process significantly.\n2. As bit convolutions can be efficiently implemented on FPGA and ASIC, DoReFa-Net opens the way to accelerate low bitwidth neural network training with specialized hardware. FPGA and ASIC would also help improve power efficiency of low bitwidth neural network training.\n3. We explore the configuration space of bit-width for weights, activations and gradients for DoReFa-Net, and find 1-bit weights, 2-bit activations and 4-bit gradients to be a good configuration for SVHN and AlexNet, in terms of prediction accuracy, training time, inference time and storage size. In particular, using 2-bit activations rather than binary activations is found to be effective in lessening the accuracy degradation. We name our model “DoReFa-Net” to note this specific configuration.\n4. We release in TensorFlow (Abadi et al.) format a DoReFa-Net 2 derived from AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) that gets 47% in single-crop top-1 accuracy on ILSVRC12 validation set."

      "text" : "The set of real numbers representable by a low bitwidth k only has a small ordinality 2k. However, mathematically any continuous function whose range is a small finite set would necessarily always have zero gradient with respect to its input. We adopt the “straightthrough estimator” (STE) method (Hinton et al., 2012b; Bengio et al., 2013) to circumvent this problem. An STE can be thought of as an operator that has human-defined forward and backward operations. A simple example is the STE defined for Bernoulli sampling with probability p ∈ [0, 1]:\nForward: q ∼ Bernoulli(p)\nBackward: ∂c ∂p = ∂c ∂q .\nHere c denotes the objective function. The motivation here is that since q is closely related to p, we may use the well-defined gradient ∂c∂q to update p in SGD.\nAn STE we will use extensively in this work is quantizek that quantizes a real number input ri ∈ [0, 1] to a k-bit number output ro ∈ [0, 1]. This STE is defined as below:\nForward: ro = 1\n2k − 1 round((2 k − 1)ri) (4)\nBackward: ∂c ∂ri = ∂c ∂ro . (5)\nIt’s obvious by construction that the output q of quantizek STE is a real number representable by k bits. Also, since round((2k − 1)ri) is a k-bit fixed-point integer, the dot product of two sequences of such k-bit real numbers can be efficiently calculated, by using fixed-point integer dot product in Eqn. 2 followed by a constant scaling."

      "heading" : "2.3 Low Bitwidth Quantization of Weights",
      "text" : "In this section we detail our approach to getting low bitwidth weights. In previous works, STE has been used to binarize the weights. For example in BNN, weights are binarized by the following STE:\nForward: ro = sign(ri)\nBackward: ∂c ∂ri = clip( ∂c ∂ro ,−1, 1).\nNote that although sign(ri) may produce exact zero when ri = 0, in practice, due to the limited precision of floating-point numbers, ro will almost for sure be of two possible values: {−1, 1}. In XNOR-Net, weights are binarized by the following STE, with the difference being that weights are scaled after binarized:\nForward: ro = sign(ri)×EF (|ri|)\nBackward: ∂c ∂ri = ∂c ∂ro .\nIn XNOR-Net, the scaling factor EF (|ri|) is the mean of absolute value across the whole filter. The rationale is that introducing this scaling factor will increase the value range of weights, while still being able to exploit bit convolution kernels. However, the channel-wise scaling factors will make it impossible to exploit bit convolution kernels when computing the convolution between gradients and the weights during back propagation. Thankfully, in our experiments, we find using a constant scalar to scale all filters does not cause degradation in prediction accuracy compared to channel-wise scaling. Therefore we use the following STE in all experiments that have binary weights in this paper:\nForward: ro = sign(ri)×E(|ri|) (6)\nBackward: ∂c ∂ri = ∂c ∂ro . (7)\nTo keep k-bit representation of the weights rather than binarize them, we apply the STE fkω to weights as follows:\nForward: ro = fkω(ri) = 2 quantizek( tanh(ri) 2 max(| tanh(ri)|) + 12)− 1. (8)\nBackward: ∂c ∂ri = ∂c ∂ro ∂ro ∂ri 3 (9)\nNote here we use tanh to limit the value range to [−1, 1] before quantizing to k-bit. We found that using tanh helps bound the value and therefore improve the stability of training. By construction, tanh(ri)2 max(| tanh(ri)|) + 1 2 is a number in [0, 1], where the maximum is taken over all weights in that layer. quantizek will then quantize this number to k-bit fixed-point ranging in [0, 1]. Finally an affine transform will bring the range of fkω(ri) to [−1, 1]. Note that when k = 1, Eqn. 8 is different from Eqn. 6, providing a different way of binarizing weights. Nevertheless, we find this difference insignificant in experiments."

In BNN and XNOR-Net, activations are binarized in the same way as weights. However, we fail to reproduce the results of XNOR-Net if we follow their methods of binarizing activations, and the binarizing approach in BNN is claimed by (Rastegari et al., 2016) to cause severe prediction accuracy drop. Hence instead, we apply a different STE on input activations r of each weight layer. Here we assume the output of the previous layer has passed through a bounded activation function h, which ensures r ∈ [0, 1]. In DoReFa-Net, quantization of activations r to k-bit is simply:\nfkα(r) = quantizek(r). (10)\nWe observed that the choice of activation function h has a profound impact on network prediction accuracy. In our experiments we find following activations functions to be useful:\n1. h(x) = tanh(x)+12 2. h(x) = clip(x, 0, 1)\n3. h(x) = min(1, |x|)\n3Here ∂ro ∂ri is well-defined because we already defined quantizek as an STE"

      "text" : "We have demonstrated deterministic quantization to produce low bitwidth weights and activations. However, we find stochastic quantization is necessary for low bitwidth gradients to be effective. This is in agreement with experiments of (Gupta et al., 2015) on 16-bit weights and 16-bit gradients. To quantize gradients to low bitwidth, it is important to note that the magnitude of gradient is unbounded and may be significantly larger than activation. Recall in Eqn. 10, we mapped the range of activation to [0, 1] by introducing proper nonlinear activations. However, this kind of convenience does not exist for gradients, and we’d actually prefer to keep the magnitude of gradients unaffected for SGD to work. Therefore we designed the following k-bit quantization function:\nfkγ (dr) = 2 max0(|dr|) [ quantizek(\ndr 2 max0(|dr|) + 12)− 1 2\n] .\nHere dr = ∂c∂r is the back-propagated gradient of the output r of some layer, and the maximum is taken over all axis of the gradient tensor dr except for the mini-batch axis (therefore each instance in a mini-batch will have its own scaling factor). The above function first applies an affine transform on the gradient, to map it into [0, 1], and then inverts the transform after quantization. To further compensate the potential bias introduced by gradient quantization, we introduce an extra noise function N(x) = clip(x + σ2k−1 , 0, 1) where σ ∼ Uniform(−0.5, 0.5). The noise therefore has the same magnitude as the possible quantization error. We found this stochasticity crucial in achieving good performance. Finally, the expression we’ll use to quantize gradients to k-bit numbers is as follows:\nfkγ (dr) = 2 max0(|dr|) [ quantizek[N(\ndr 2 max0(|dr|) + 12)]− 1 2) ] . (11)\nThe quantization of gradient is done on the backward pass only. Hence we apply the following STE on the output of each weight layer:\nForward: ro = ri (12)\nBackward: ∂c ∂ri = fkγ ( ∂c ∂ro ).

By construction, there is always an affine mapping between these low bitwidth numbers and fixed-point integers. As a result, all the expensive operations can be accelerated significantly by the fixed-point integer dot product kernel (Eqn. 2)."

It is an interesting question whether these differences would cause the first and last layer to exhibit different behavior when converted to low bitwidth counterparts.

Based on this intuition as well as the observation that the inputs to the first layer often contain only a few channels and constitutes a small proportion of total computation complexity, we perform most of our experiments by not quantizing the weights of the first convolutional layer, unless noted otherwise. Nevertheless, the outputs of the first convolutional layer are quantized to low bitwidth as they would be used by the consequent convolutional layer. Similarly, when the output number of class is small, to stay away from potential degradation of prediction accuracy, we leave the last fully-connected layer intact unless noted otherwise. Nevertheless, the gradients back-propagated from the final FC layer are properly quantized. We will give the empirical evidence in Section 3.3."

      "text" : "One of the motivations for creating low bitwidth neural network is to save run-time memory footprint in inference. A naive implementation of Algorithm 1 would involve applying a nonlinear activation h on ak, resulting in full-precision numbers and would consume much memory during run-time. Besides, if h involves floating-point arithmetics, there will be non-negligible amount of non-bitwise operations related to computations of ak. There are simple solutions to this problem. Notice that it is possible to fuse Step 3, Step 4, Step 6 to avoid storing ak in full-precision. Apart from this, when h is monotonic, fα · h is also monotonic, the few possible values of abk corresponds to several non-overlapping value ranges of ak, hence we can implement computation of abk = fα(h(ak)) by several comparisons and avoid generating intermediate results. Similarly, it would also be desirable to fuse Step 11 ∼ Step 12, and Step 13 of previous iteration to avoid generating gak . The situation would be more complex when there are intermediate pooling layers. Nevertheless, if the pooling layer is max-pooling, we can do the fusion as quantizek function commutes with max function:\nquantizek(max(a, b)) = max(quantizek(a), quantizek(b))), (14)\nhence again gbak can be generated from gak by several comparisons."

The listed prediction accuracy is the maximum accuracy over 200 epochs. We use ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2014) learning rule with 0.001 as learning rate. In general, having low bitwidth weights, activations and gradients will cause degradation in prediction accuracy. But it should be noted that low bitwidth networks will have much reduced resource requirement. As balancing between multiple factors like training time, inference time, model size and accuracy is more a problem of practical trade-off, there will be no definite conclusion as which combination of (W, A, G) one should choose. Nevertheless, we find in these experiments that weights, activations and gradients are progressively more sensitive to bit-width, and using gradients with G ≤ 2 would significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Based on these observations, we take (W, A, G) = (1, 2, 4) as a rational combination and use it in our experiments on ImageNet dataset. Interestingly, By comparing row (W, A, G) = (1, 2, 32) with row (W, A, G) = (1, 2, 4), it can also be seen that for low bitwidth networks, training with low bit gradients may boost prediction accuracy. The credit may belong to the regularization effect introduced by the noise in gradients, similar to previous works in adding noise to gradients (Neelakantan et al., 2015). Table 1 also shows that the relative number of channels significantly affect the prediction quality loss resulting from bit-width reduction. For example, there is no significant loss of prediction accuracy when going from 32-bit model to DoReFa-Net for Model A, but it not the case for Model C. We conjecture that “more capable” models like those with more channels will be less sensitive to bit-width differences. On the other hand, Table 1 also\nsuggests a method to compensate for the prediction quality loss, by increasing bit-width of activations for models with less channels, at the cost of increasing inference time and training time computation complexity. However, optimal bit-width of gradient seems less related to model channel numbers and prediction quality saturates with 4-bit gradients across the table."

We replace the Local Contrast Renormalization layer with Batch Normalization layer (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015). From the table, it can be seen that increasing bitwidth of activation from 1-bit to 2-bit and even to 4-bit, while still keep 1-bit weights, leads to significant accuracy increase, quickly approaching the accuracy of model where both weights and activations are 32-bit. Rounding gradients to 4-bit is also found to be a good local minimum, as the combination“1-2-8” leads to worse final accuracy than “1-2-4”. The rows with “initialized” means the model training has been initialized with a 32-bit model.

However, the number of additions between high-bit numbers remains at the same order of magnitude as before.

However, the work is more concerned with decreasing the amount of communication traffic, and does not deal with the bit-width of gradient used in backpropagation. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to reduce the bit-width of gradient to 4-bit and lower, while still achieving comparable prediction accuracy without altering other aspects of neural network model, such as increasing the number of channels.

In particular, during backward pass, parameter gradients are stochastically quantized to low bitwidth numbers before being propagated to convolutional layers. As convolutions during forward/backward passes can now operate on low bitwidth weights and activations/gradients respectively, DoReFa-Net can use bit convolution kernels to accelerate both training and inference. Moreover, as bit convolutions can be efficiently implemented on CPU, FPGA, ASIC and GPU, DoReFatNet opens the way to accelerate training of low bitwidth neural network on these hardware. Our experiments on SVHN and ImageNet datasets prove that DoReFa-Net can achieve comparable prediction accuracy as 32-bit counterparts. For example, a DoReFa-Net derived from AlexNet that has 1-bit weights, 2-bit activations, can be trained from scratch using 4-bit gradients to get 47% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet validation set.1 The DoReFa-Net AlexNet model is released publicly.",
