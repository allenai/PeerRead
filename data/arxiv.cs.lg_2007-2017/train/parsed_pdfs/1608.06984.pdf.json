      "text" : "Optimal control and/or design problems often have large variable spaces and highly non-convex objectives and constraints, preventing effective or even tractable searches via existing algorithms. Despite this, human beings\n∗tbsexton@asu.edu †yiren@asu.edu\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n06 98\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\nhave demonstrated ability at finding good solutions for high-dimensional optimization problems. Examples can be found from crowdsourcing scientific solutions for protein folding [2, 3], RNA synthesis [4, 5], genome sequence alignment [6], robot arm movements [7], to name a few, as well as from our daily achievements in packing luggage, scheduling conference sessions [8], and playing games [1,9,10]. As a particular example, our previous study investigated the value of crowdsourcing optimal design and control problems with nondeterministic polynomial time by comparing the search performance of an anonymous crowd with a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm on an electric vehicle time-trial game [1]. In the game, the player needs to both determine the control policy and the final gear ratio to minimize energy consumption for completing a given track in 36 seconds. We found that the majority of the crowd had worse convergence performance, yet a small group of players identified good solutions earlier than the algorithm (see Fig. 1). While often attributed to the “creativity” or “intuition” of human beings, we consider such ability as prior knowledge, in the form of algorithmic parameters, that helps to enhance an inherent search algorithm used by human beings to find good solutions. The variability in the prior knowledge for a particular problem leads to different search capabilities of players. The above evidence and hypothesis motivate the question: Can we recover a player’s knowledge and use it to improve an optimization algorithm?\nTo answer this question, we investigate in this paper (1) how algorithmic parameters, when they exist, can be estimated based on demonstrated search trajectories, and (2) whether recovered parameters from a player can be used to improve the convergence of the solver, using the ecoRacer game as a case study. Specifically, we assume that a player’s search trajectory is produced from BO (also called “Efficient Global Optimization” [11]) where each new trial optimizes an expected improvement function learned and adjusted by the player during the search. We make the assumption for two reasons: First, BO has been widely used for non-convex optimization problems with high evaluation costs [11,12], which includes the design of dynamical systems where the evaluation of the objective involves long-term simulation of the system [12,13]. Secondly, it is recently found that BO best resembles human search, which outperforms an extensive set of optimization algorithms in 1D problems [14]. Based on this assumption, we propose a model that calculates the likelihood of BO parameters given the observed search trajectory, and discuss the derivation of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the BO parameters. We call the process of estimating BO parameters using human search trajectory “Inverse BO” (IBO).\nThis paper has two contributions: First, we use simulation studies to show that IBO can successfully recover BO parameters when the search trajectories are created by BO. We also use IBO to learn BO parameters from a human player with fast improvement, and apply the resultant BO to the ecoRacer game. Results show that the BO with learned parameters achieves better convergence than a self-adaptive BO. This indicates that IBO can be used to accelerate a search even when only a good search strategy, rather than good solutions, are observed. Secondly, we elucidate the connection between IBO and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and use the connections between the two to explain the current limitations and opportunities for IBO in design crowdsourcing."

Model update: BO first updates a Gaussian Process (GP) model [15] to predict objective values, based on current observations hk and Gaussian parameters λ. Without considering random noise in evaluating the objective, the GP model can be derived as f̂(x;hk,λ) = b+ r\nTR−1(fk − b), where b = 1T R−1fk 1T R−11 , r is a column vector with elements ri = exp ( −(x− xi)TΛ(x− xi) ) for i = 1, · · · , k, R is a symmetric matrix withRij = exp ( −(xi − xj)TΛ(xi − xj)\n) for i, j = 1, · · · , k, and 1 is a column vector with ones.

Sampling the solution space: The second step is to determine the next sample using the GP model. A common sampling strategy is to pick the new solution in X that maximizes the expected improvement from the current best objective value fmin := min fk (assuming a minimization problem):\nQEI(x;hk,λ) = (fmin− f̂)Φ ( fmin−f̂\nσ\n) +σφ ( fmin−f̂\nσ\n) . Here Φ(·) and φ(·) are\nthe cumulative distribution function and probability density function of the standard normal distribution, respectively. The new sample is thus obtained by solving\nxk+1 = argmaxx∈XQEI(x;hk,λ). (2)\nNote that QEI is non-convex with respect to x and its maximization may involve a nested global optimization routine, such as Genetic Algorithm, DIRECT [16], and BARON [17]. The exploration set h0 that is necessary to initialize the GP model is usually created by Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS, see [11] for details). Both the solution of Eq. 2 and LHS introduce randomness to the BO search trajectory. Fig. 2 demonstrates four iterations of BO in optimizing a 1D function, with the GP model and the expected improvement function updated in each iteration."

      "text" : "IBO estimates λ, along with the size of the initial exploration set K0, given the trajectory hK . To do so, we minimize a cost function consisting of the exploration cost of h0, denoted as LINI , and the BO cost of the rest of hK , denoted as LBO. LINI := − logDp(X0) where p(X0) is the joint probability of the exploration set and D := |X | is the size of the solution space. And LBO := − logDp(hK −h0|h0) = − ∑K−1 k=0 logDp(xk+1|hk) where p(xk+1|hk) is the density for choosing xk+1. Here log(·) stands for natural logarithm. The derivation of LINI and LBO are as follows: To calculate LINI , we assume that each new sample during the exploration phase, xi for i = 1, · · · ,K0, tends to maximize its minimum Euclidean distance d(xi,X<i) to previous samples X<i, this is referred to as the max-min sampling scheme in the sequel. Let the joint probability of the exploration set be p(X0) = p(x1)p(x2|x1) · · · p(xK0 |X<K0) and each conditional probability follow a Boltzmann distribution: p(xi|X<i) = exp (αINId(xi,X<i)) /ZINI(xi, αINI). Here\nthe scalar αINI represents how strictly each sample from X0 follows the maxmin sampling scheme, and ZINI(xi, αINI) = ∫ x∈X exp (αINId(x,X<i)) dx is\na partition function that ensures that ∫ X p(xi|X<i)dx = 1. Note that the first sample in the exploration set is considered to be uniformly drawn, and thus only contributes a constant to the cost.\nTo calculate LBO, the conditional probability density of sampling x ∈ X based on current hk can be similarly modeled as a Boltzmann distribution:\np(x|hk) = exp (αBOQEI(x;hk,λ)) /ZBO(hk,λ, αBO), (3)\nwhere ZBO(hk,λ, αBO) = ∫ x∈X exp (αBOQEI(x;hk,λ)) dx is also a partition function. The parameter αBO serves for a similar purpose as αINI . For simplicity, we define l̃i := − log (Dp(xi|X<i)) and lk := − log (Dp(x|hk)), so that LINI = ∑K0 i=1 l̃i and LBO = ∑K−1 k=0 lk. A lower value of l̃ or l represents higher probability density of the current sample to be drawn using INI or BO, respectively, and a zero value indicates that the sample can be considered as uniformly drawn. The IBO solves the following problem\nmin αINI ,αBO,λ,K0 L := LINI + LBO (4)\nto derive λ̂. Note that to find the optimal K0 for any given αINI , αBO, and λ, one can first calculate the optimal l̃i and lk for i, k = 2, · · · ,K, with respect to αINI , αBO, and λ, and then scan K0 = 2, · · · ,K to find the lowest value of LINI + LBO. The scan starts at K0 = 2 because it is not meaningful to initialize BO with a single sample.\n4 Numerical Integration for ZBO\nThe calculation of each l requires an approximation of ZBO(hk,λ, αBO). Note that QEI(x;hk,λ) is usually a highly non-convex function with respect to x, with function values dropping significantly around local maxima. See Fig.2 for example. Thus we propose to approximate ZBO with importance sampling using a customized proposal density function that combines a uniform distribution with density p(x) = 1/D and a multivariate normal distribution with density q(x) = ( √ 2πσpI )\n−1 exp(−||x−µ||2/2σ2I ), where σI and µ are parameters of q(x). The uniform distribution is used to sample over X , while the normal distribution helps to improve the approximation by capturing the potential peak at the current sample xk+1. Thus we set µ := xk+1. Let x u i ∈ U for i = 1, ..., I and xnj ∈ N for j = 1, ..., J be\nsamples from the uniform and the normal distributions, respectively. The approximation ẐBO can be calculated by\nẐBO := ∑ U DQEI(x u i ) I (1 +Dq(xui )) + ∑ N\nDQEI(x n j ) J ( 1 +Dq(xnj ) ) , (5)\nwith arguments of QEI omitted for simplicity. The derivation of Eq. (5) is deferred to the appendix. Note that this approximation works under the assumption that ∫ x∈X q(x)dx ≈ 1, which is plausible as the normal distribution is designed to have a narrow shape to match the local peak at xk+1. In this paper, the shape of this normal distribution is set by σI = 0.01 universally. While the setting of σI affects the variance of the approximation, we found this setting performs well in practice. For ZINI , since the minimum Euclidean distance function in a high dimensional space with limited samples is a relatively smooth function, we use Monte Carlo sampling for its approximation."

To initialize BO, we use LHS to draw 10 samples from X . BO terminates when the expected improvement for the next iteration is less than 10−3. At each iteration, the expected improvement is maximized using a multi-start gradient descent algorithm [18] with 100 LHS initial guesses. A set of BO parameters, Λ = 0.01I, 0.1I, 1.0I, 10.0I, are used to perform the search, where I is the identity matrix.

      "heading" : "5.1.2 Analysis of the results",
      "text" : "To understand the results from Fig. 3, we shall first discuss the properties of the costs l and l̃.\nProperties of l and l̃ From Sec. 4, the unbiased estimation of l(x, αBO) through importance sampling is:\nl̂(x, αBO) = − log exp(αBOQEI(x))\nẐBO/D . (6)\nl̂(x, αBO) has the following properties. Property 1: αBO = 0 leads l̂(x, 0) = 0, indicating that x is uniformly sampled. One can see that the optimal cost of LBO is non-positive, as one can always achieve LBO = 0 by considering samples to be uniformly drawn. Property 2: When the expected improvement function is constant almost everywhere, i.e., Pr(QEI(x) = C) = 1, we have Pr(l̂(x, αBO) = 0) = 1. Property 3: Notice that 1 + Dq(xi) ≈ 1 for xi ∈ U due to the small σI (see Sec. 4), and exp(αBOQEI(xi))1+Dq(xi) ≈ 0 for large D and small αBO. The gradient of l̂(x, 0) is approximated as:\n∂l̂(x, 0)\n∂αBO = c(αBO) ∑ U ∆ai, (7)\nwhere c(αBO) > 0 and ∆ai := QEI(xi)−QEI(x). Here we introduce a conjecture: Let Q̄EI := ∫ X QEI(x)dx/D be the average expected improvement,\nand A := ∫ X 1(QEI(x) > Q̄EI)dx be the measure of a subspace where the sampled expected improvement value is higher than Q̄EI . A decreases from above to below D/2 along the increase of the BO sample size. In other words, a uniformly drawn sample has a chance of more (less) than 50% to have an expected improvement value higher than Q̄EI at the early (late) stage of BO.\nOne evidence of the conjecture is illustrated in Fig. 2: In the first iteration, Q̄EI is slightly lower than 7.5 while the majority of X has QEI > Q̄EI ; in the fourth iteration, however, only a small region around the peak has QEI > Q̄EI . Using this conjecture, we can show that ∑ U ∆ai < 0 when the sample size is small, thus ∂l̂(x,0)∂αBO < 0. Together with Property 1, we have l̂(x, αBO) < 0 for small αBO and small sample size. Property 4: We notice that in this experiment, the discrepancy between LHS and the modeled max-min sampling scheme leads to overall high l̃ values, indicating that the samples do not follow the model. Nonetheless, negative l̃ values can still be observed when αINI is low. This further suggests that given the LHS samples, a loosely executed max-min sampling is more probable than a strict one.\nMajor findings from Fig. 3 Finding 1: A comparison between αINI = 1.0 and 10.0 leads to a finding consistent with Property 4. Since the samples are not likely to be drawn from a strictly executed max-min sampling scheme, the entire search trajectory is considered to be created from BO in the case of αINI = 10.0. While the early samples (less than 10) can be considered as from exploration when αINI = 1.0 (l̃ < 0), the low magnitude of l̃ causes this difference to be only visible in the case of Λ = 10.0I, where the magnitude of l is also low. Finding 2: IBO correctly identifies the true Λ within a few iterations after the initial exploration, except for the case of Λ = 10.0I. To explain this inconsistency in IBO performance, we first note that Λ = 10.0I leads to an expected improvement function that is constant almost everywhere (except for the sampled locations where QEI = 0) and thus a BO that reduces to uniform sampling. From Property 2, LBO = 0 almost surely when we have the correct guess on Λ. Also recall from Property 4 that LINI > 0 when αINI is high. The above two together explain why with the correct guess of Λ = 10.0I, we have L close to zero when αINI = 10.0 and slightly negative when αINI = 1.0.\n1 To explain the negative L values for the incorrect guesses of Λ, we use Property 3 to show that when the sample size is small and the expected improvement function is not flat, LBO < 0 for a small αBO, and thus L < 0. As a takeaway point, Finding 2 suggests that for a search trajectory with a limited length that resembles a random search, the proposed IBO approach will consider it being derived from a BO that loosely solves Eq. 4. However, this caveat is of little practical concern, since (1) a random search rarely outperforms BO with non-trivial settings, and (2) a BO with low αBO (instead of high Λ) can equally simulate a random search."

      "text" : "The above study showed that the correct BO setting λ can be learned through IBO. This subsection further demonstrates the advantage of “learning from others”, i.e., updating λ through IBO, over ”self-adaptation”, i.e., finding the MLE of λ using hk. The settings follow the last study and results\n1But why does the guess of Λ = 10.0I lead to significantly decreasing L in the other three cases? This is because in those cases, BO does not resemble random sampling, i.e., the sequences of samples are more clustered. When a new sample is among this cluster, its similarities to existing ones are non-zero even when a large Λ is assumed, due to the small Euclidean distance among the pairs. And in turn, the expected improvement function has peaks within the clusters, and remain constant far away from them. As a result, the optimal value of l̂(x, αBO) with respect to αBO becomes negative, even when Λ is incorrectly guessed as 10.0I.\nare shown in Fig. 4. First, to show the significant influence of λ on search effectiveness, we show the convergence of two fixed search strategies with Λ = 0.01 and 10.0. Note that while neither converges to the optimal solution within 50 iteration, the former is significantly more effective than the latter. For “self-adaptive BO”, we use a grid search (GΛ = {0.01I, 0.1I, 1.0I, 10.0I}) to find Λ̂GP that maximizes Eq. (1) at each iteration, and use it to find the next sample. We show in Fig. 4b the percentages of the four guesses being Λ̂GP along the search, using GΛ as the initial guesses. We can see that Λ̂GP does not converge to Λ = 0.01I as quickly as in IBO through self-adaptation. The “learning from others” case starts with Λ = 10.0I, and uses IBO to derive Λ̂ from the trajectory produced by Λ = 0.01I. Since IBO identifies the good BO parameter earlier than the MLE of GP in most cases, “learning from others” outperforms “self-adaptation”. It is worth noting that in contrary to this result, we found the two strategies to have similar convergence performance when applied to 2D functions. One potential explanation for this is that effective GP parameters for BO search can be identified with a smaller number of samples in a lower dimensional space."

      "text" : "Each game play dataset consists of (1) a final gear ratio used for the vehicle, (2) a control signal with acceleration and braking records, and (3) a corresponding game score. The length of a raw control signal matches that of the track, i.e., actions are stored for each of the 18160 distance steps. Due to the fact that control signals across plays share common patterns, and that BO is ineffective for high-dimensional problems, it is necessary to encode the control signals from all players to a lower dimensional space. In a previous\nstudy on ecoRacer [1], this was done by introducing state-dependent basis functions (i.e., polynomials of the velocity of the car, slope of the track, distance to the terminal, remaining battery energy, and time spent) to parameterize the control signals. Nonetheless, the underlying assumption that human players are aware of all the state-dependent bases is untested.\nThis work explores a different approach to dimension reduction by ICA. The justification is as follows. In experimental psychological literature, research has shown that humans are prone to focusing on only salient features of their environment or problem, filtering out other information. In fact, concurrent performance of multiple tasks consistently leads to impairment in one or more of those tasks [19]. This causes us to switch between tasks quickly if they must be performed at the same time, and the time we spend on each task before switching back is related to our observed productivity at it, called discretionary task interleaving. Such a view is derived from optimal foraging theory, which understands animal foraging as an optimization of the rate of energy gain, and then viewing human behavioral solutions as ones that optimize the rate of information gain in the problem [20]. An example of this is a studying strategy while preparing for an exam, and the tendency we have to switch between difficult and easy topics depending on our perceived productivity at learning them [21]. Similarly, we propose that a human will split the problem presented to them in ecoRacer into separate sub-tasks, in such a way as to maximize their rate of information gain as they switch between exclusive focus on each one. Each sub-task will be an update decision for a salient feature of the control space. One natural separation of the tasks is to spatially segment the large track into smaller stretches of track. To maximize the information gained from exclusive focus on each, we hypothesize that these segments will contain a minimum amount of shared information with each other. The control decisions in each segment will therefore be minimally influenced by the shape of other segments.\nSpecifically, we hypothesize that human players segment the solution space X into m discrete sections: {Xi|∀i≤mXi ⊆ X}, such that some measure of independence F (X1, · · · ,Xm) is maximized. Separation of observed signals into a number of independent components is the task of blind source separation [22], which can be elegantly addressed using ICA [23]. Compared with Principal Component Analysis which minimizes the covariance of the data, our implementation of ICA maximizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence, thus identifying independent components for non-Gaussian signals, such as the control signal data. By applying ICA to the recorded human plays, we reduce the dimensionality of the control space from 18160 to 30. Because ICA tends to separate complicated non-periodic domains into a set\nof edge-filter-like bases [24], the components arrived at using ICA are naturally correlated with spatial locations, much like wavelets, with each having a peak at some unique position (see Fig. 5). While it is theoretically possible to find some “most likely” number of bases using information-theoretic criteria for model selection [25]2, the choice of 30 basis is reasonable because (1) over 95% of the variance is explained, and (2) the resultant solution space (30 control variables and one design variable) is small enough for BO to be effective."

      "text" : "Based on the hypothesis that a player acquires a good search strategy when he/she improves his performance quickly, we pick the search trajectory from a player, referred to as “P2”, who achieved the second highest score within 31 plays, much less than the 150 plays from whom achieved the highest score. To apply IBO, we first encode all control solutions from P2 using the learned ICA bases. Together with the final drive ratios, all 31 solutions are then normalized to be within [−1, 1]31. We also found that the probability for P2 to have followed the max-min sampling scheme is lower than that of following BO, as the minimal values of l̃(xk, αINI) for k = 2, ..., 31 (with respect to αINI) are dominated by those of l(xk, αBO). This suggests that either the player did not perform pure exploration following the max-min scheme, or this modeled scheme is worse than BO at explaining the exploration. Thus the search for λ̂ is performed by solving Eq. (4) using λ ∈ [0.01, 10.0]31, αBO ∈ GαBO , and with a minimal number of initial samples (K0 = 2) required for BO. For comparison, we obtain λ̂GP using the same 31 plays. Note that both Eq. (4) and Eq. (1) are non-convex. In order to avoid inferior local solutions, gradient-based search is applied to a series of initial guesses.

While these dimensionalities could make sense from a neurological perspective (e.g., given that the game takes 36 seconds, a decision interval of 36s/187 = 192ms is close to the range for the time-frame of attentional blink, which is 200-500 ms [19]), the resultant high-dimensional solution spaces are unfavorable for BO."

We shall note that the actions in the optimization, i.e., the next solutions, are determined not necessarily by the current state, such as in MDP, but by the entire search trajectory, such as in BO. To\nconsider the optimization process as an MDP, we need to redefine the state as the continuously growing search trajectory, i.e., elements in the state set S represent all possible search trajectories, rather than samples in X ."

      "text" : "The relationship between DO and an optimization process is analogous to that between RL and an MDP: As RL searches for the control parameters that maximizes the value of a MDP, DO similarly searches for settings of an optimization algorithm that maximizes the improvement in the objective. Since MDP is one type of decision process, RL belongs to DO. Further, DO is recursive: The optimal design of any DO algorithm is by itself a DO problem. We shall note that there is a significant difference between RL and DO: While RL algorithms can be developed based on the Bellman’s optimality principle and the Markovian property of MDP, DO in general is usually done empirically and manually. For example, in either gradient-based methods (e.g., sequential quadratic programming) or heuristic methods (e.g., genetic algorithms), good algorithmic parameters are suggested based on experience, rather than being optimized for a specific problem."

      "heading" : "7.1.4 IRL vs. IBO",
      "text" : "While RL identifies an optimal control policy for an MDP with a given reward function, real-world applications hardly define a reward function, e.g., the reward for “drives well” cannot be explicitly defined. Alternatively, it is easier for a human expert to demonstrate state-action sequences that are near-optimal for a certain task. IRL techniques have thus been developed to identify the inherent reward (and thus the Q-function) that explains human demonstrations, either by estimating the reward parameters so that the demonstrated policy has a higher value than any other policies by a margin [26,29,32,33], or by maximizing the likelihood of control parameters by assuming near-optimal control of the demonstration [27,34].\nThe IBO approach introduced in this paper, as a type of DO, is closely related to latter type of IRLs, and in particular to the maximum entropy method proposed by Ziebart et al. [27]. Briefly, the maximum entropy IRL proposes the following MLE of parameters λ based on a set of demonstrations h:\nλ̂ = argmaxλ logP (h|λ)\n= argmaxλ log exp\n(∑ (si,ai)∈hR(si,ai,λ) ) ∏\n(si,ai)∈h Zi(λ) ,\n(8)\nwhere Zi(λ) is a partition function for the visited state si. One can notice the similarities between Eqs. (8) and (4): (1) Both are maximum likelihood estimations of parameters related to a instantaneous cost, the reward in Eq. (8) and the expected improvement in IBO. (2) Both involves partition functions that are computationally expensive, and dependent on the state s and the parameters λ. Due to this dependency of partition function on λ, a direct Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in the space of λ (e.g., as in [34]) cannot be applied to optimize the likelihood function since the partition values for two different samples of λ do not cancel. Ziebart et al. discussed on alternative approach to address this computational challenge by using an “Expected Edge Frequency Calculation” algorithm that has a complexity of O(N |S||A|) for each gradient calculation of the objective in Eq. (8), where N is a large number [27]. However, this approach can be infeasible for the IBO estimation problem in Eq. (4) since (1) the space X is usually continuous, and (2) even with a discretization of X , the enormous size of S and A can easily make the calculation intractable, based on the discussion in Sec. 7.1.2.\nBesides the computational challenge of IBO due to the underlying nonMarkovian optimization process and the large solution space X , there is another subtle difference between IRL and IBO in their assumptions about human demonstrations and thus their applications. IRL is developed for RL problems where the reward function cannot be quantitatively defined, but rather has to be learned through human demonstrations. Since these demonstrations fulfil the inherent requirements of the designer, they are assumed to be near-optimal, i.e., they lead to near-optimal cumulative rewards over a finite time horizon. In BO, however, the reward is explicitly defined as the improvement in the objective. Nonetheless, evaluating the reward can be costly for a machine due to its lack of knowledge about the state transition function, e.g., unlike human beings, the machine cannot “imagine” but has to calculate the outcome of ecoRacer. To this end, BO uses the GP model and the expected improvement function to analytically approximate the state transition and the reward functions, respectively. Since there lacks a goodness measure of this approximation, we resort to IBO to estimate “good” GP parameters, by assuming that the search trajectories used for the estimation are near-optimal, i.e., they achieve near-optimal improvement in the objective value in a fixed number of iterations. It should be noted that this assumption does not require the availability of near-optimal solutions in the demonstration.\nTo summarize: IRL can be used when the machine is told to mimic existing solutions, by understanding why these solutions are considered as\nbeing good. IBO can be used when the machine is meant to mimic the process of searching for good solutions, by understanding how to evaluate the expected improvement of solutions."
    }, {
      "heading" : "7.2 The potential value of IBO",
      "text" : "We saw that IBO has limited appeal in the presented ecoRacer case as it only led to marginal improvement from a default BO setting after observing 31 solutions from P2. In fact, one could achieve faster convergence with a default BO (λ = 1.0I) by initializing the search with these solutions. In the following, we discuss three situations when IBO and DO in general will fail, and what future research are needed to avoid failures.\nThe first situation is when the human search strategy cannot be explained by BO. Studies in cognitive science have identified some of the core ingredients of human intelligence, including intuitive physics [35–38], problem decomposition skills [39–41], the ability of learning-to-learn [42], and others [43]. While evidence have shown the connection between BO and human search [14], suitable models of human search strategies can very likely be problem dependent. Specific to ecoRacer, and other design and control problems of dynamical systems, a potentially more reasonable human search model could be to incorporate human intuitive physics models into the evaluation of expected improvement. Thus instead of estimating GP parameters, one could estimate a statistical model of the state transition function.\nThe second situation is when the demonstration is insufficient to provide a good estimation of λ of an effective search. An evidence is shown in Fig. 7 where we apply BO to ecoRacer with λ̂ learned from the first 11 plays of P2. Its performance is compared with that of a default BO, and is shown to only allows marginal improvements in a short term. One potential solution to this would be to use the covariance of the estimator, i.e., the Hessian of the likelihood function, to inform an incentive mechanism. For example, if λ̂ learned from an effective search trajectory has a high variance, the crowdsourcing system could track down the player and offer higher reward for more solutions. It would also be interesting to understand the influence of the properties of the problem, e.g., the size of the solution space, on the convergence of the variance of the estimator.\nThe third situation is when the demonstration is insufficient for the designer, or the crowdsourcing system, to tell who is actually more effective at searching, i.e., learning an effective search within a fixed number of iterations may not guarantee that the search will continue to be effective. We\nargue, however, that this is a universal challenge in IRL as well. For example, demonstrations on pancake flipping does not guarantee a good solution to egg flipping due to the change in physical properties and thus in state transition. The fundamental challenge across IRL, IBO and other potential DO approaches, is that we may not be able to identify a fixed set of optimal λ̂ when the true optimum changes. A common solution to this in IRL is to adapt λ̂ to the observed new environments. We shall investigate if such adaption, e.g., through the maximum likelihood estimator of the GP, will work for IBO.\nTo summarize, IBO is useful, as in the simulation study, when (1) the underlying human search mechanism follows BO, (2) the search trajectory is sufficient for an estimation with low variance, and (3) the true optimal BO setting for a long-term search can be estimated from the trajectory of an effective short-term search."
    }, {
      "heading" : "8 Conclusions",
      "text" : "This paper was motivated by the observation that it is more likely to crowdsource effective solution search data than optimal design solutions. We hypothesized that human search data contain useful information to enhance an optimization algorithm. To test this hypothesis, we introduced the Inverse Bayesian Optimization method that attempts to mimic human searches through Bayesian Optimization. Simulation studies on the 30D Rosenbrock function showed that IBO can correctly identify the best BO parameters using a small number of observations and the resultant BO can outperform the one with self-adaptive parameters. We than applied IBO to the real human search data collected from the game ecoRacer. The marginal improvement achieved by IBO from default and self-adaptive BO settings indicated the limitations of this approach. Potential solutions to these limitations are discussed in depth, with the help of an analogy between IBO and IRL.\nWe conclude with a bigger picture. Design crowdsourcing faces a dilemma: It is believed to be a promising solution to computationally challenging design problems according to speculations, yet in reality its success is highly doubted even by the academia due to its high overhead cost and the high uncertainty solution quality. This paper establishes a line of research that aims to turn high quality search into high quality solutions. Since the former is more often available from the crowd, this research could potentially lowering the uncertainty on crowdsourced solution quality and thus improve the chance of success of design crowdsourcing activities."

This work attempts to quantify the search strategy of human beings to enhance a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm for an optimal design and control problem. We consider the sequence of human solutions (called a search trajectory) as generated from BO, and propose to recover the algorithmic parameters of BO through maximum likelihood estimation. The method is first verified through simulation studies and then applied to human solutions crowdsourced from a gamified design problem [1]. We learn BO parameters from a player who achieved fast improvement in his/her solutions and show that applying the learned parameters to BO achieves better convergence than using a self-adaptive BO. The proposed method is different from inverse reinforcement learning in that it only requires a good search strategy, rather than near-optimal solutions from humans.",
