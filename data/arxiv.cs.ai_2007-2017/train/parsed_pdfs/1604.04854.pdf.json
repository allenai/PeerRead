      "text" : "any particular underwater mission to fulfil the mission objectives successfully and ensure its safety in all stages of the mission in a large scale operating filed. In this paper, a novel combinatorial conflict-free-task assignment strategy consisting an interactive engagement of a local path planner and an adaptive global route planner, is introduced. The method is established upon the heuristic search potency of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to address the discrete nature of routing-task assignment approach and the complexity of NP-hard path planning problem. The proposed hybrid method, is highly efficient for having a reactive guidance framework that guarantees successful completion of missions specifically in cluttered environments. To examine the performance of the method in a context of mission productivity, mission time management and vehicle safety, a series of simulation studies are undertaken. The results of simulations declare that the proposed method is reliable and robust, particularly in dealing with uncertainties, and it can significantly enhance the level of vehicle’s autonomy by relying on its reactive nature and capability of providing fast feasible solutions.\nKeywords-Autonomous underwater vehicles, Path planning, Route planning, Autonomy, Evolutionary optimization\n1. Introduction\nAutonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have been discovered as the most cost-effective and expedient technology over the past and coming years. Recent breakthroughs in computer systems and sensor technologies have greatly expanded the range of missions to be performed by AUVs in the past years. This widening operating range, however, is intertwined with the appearance of new complexities, for instance propagation of uncertainty and accumulation of data, crystalizing the underwater mission into a challenging scenario. Increasing the mission productivity and ensuring the vehicles safety are two main concepts that should be satisfied in all stages of the mission considering dynamic changes of environment. Hence, vehicle needs a certain degree of autonomy to perform efficacious and safe operation in such a severe environment. An efficient motion planning strategy is a requisite to reach a satisfactory level of autonomy toward accomplishing underwater mission objectives. Efficient routing strategy promotes vehicles capability in task priority assignment, mission time management, and increasing mission productivity, while real-time local path planner is capable of satisfying safe and optimal deployment in uncertain, dynamic, and cluttered ocean environments. Respectively, the previous attempts in this scope can be divided into two main categories of vehicles optimum path planning along with the vehicle routing and task scheduling approaches.\nThe path planning strategies are known as flexible methods in vehicle’s guidance toward the\ndestination encountering the local unexpected dynamic changes of the environment. Various strategies such as heuristic search algorithms [1-4], evolutionary and artificial intelligence based strategies [5-14] have been applied to AUV’s path planning problem in recent years. Any research in this area attempts to cover shortcomings of previous investigations. Fast Marching (FM) algorithm is a heuristic approach utilized by Petres [3] to solve path planning problem, which uses a first order numerical approximation of the nonlinear Eikonal equation. This method is accurate but also computationally expensive than A*. Later on, Petres [4] employed an upgraded version of FM known as FM* or heuristically guided FM. The FM* keeps the efficiency of the FM along with the accuracy of the A* algorithm, but it is restricted to use linear anisotropic cost to attain computational efficiency. Particularly, the main drawback of the heuristic search methods is that their time complexity increases exponentially with increasing the problem space, which is inappropriate for real-time applications. Evolution based algorithms are another approaches applied successfully on path planning problem. Evolutionary algorithms are population based optimization methods that are advantaged to be implemented on a parallel machine with multiple processors, which speeds up the computation process [5]. It has been proven that evolutionary algorithms are efficient methods in dealing\nwith path planning as a Non-deterministic Polynomial-time (NP) hard problem [7]. The evolution based strategies are fast enough to satisfy time restrictions of the real-time applications. The PSO [6] and GA [8- 11] are two popular types of optimization algorithms applied successfully in path planning application. Later on, a Quantum-based PSO (QPSO) has been employed by Zeng and colleagues [12-13] for AUVs on-line path planning in dynamic marine environment. Although most of the proposed path planning techniques are capable of accurately guide the vehicle toward the predefined destination, however AUVoriented applications still has several difficulties when operating across a large-scale geographical area. In a large scale operations, accurate estimation of the next state of the operating field (e.g., obstacles behavior, etc.), far beyond vehicles current position and sensor coverage is computationally hard and experimentally impractical. Moreover, the computational complexity grow exponentially with enlargement of search space dimensions. A huge load of data about update of whole terrain condition should be computed repeatedly. This huge data load from whole environment should be analyzed continuously every time that path replanting is required, which is computationally inefficient and unnecessary as only awareness of environment in vicinity of the vehicle such that the vehicle can be able to perform reaction to environmental changes is enough. On the other hand, in a case that terrain is cluttered with different waypoints and vehicle is required to carry out a specific sequence of prioritized tasks (assigned to distance between waypoints in operation network), path planning is not able to carry out the task assignment and time management considering graph routing restrictions. Thus, a routing strategy is required to generate a global route that gives a general overview of the vehicles trajectory toward the final destination, and to carry out the task assignment considering graph search constraints.\nMany attempts have been carried out in scope of single or multiple vehicles routing and task\nscheduling in a graph like operation environment based on different strategies. For instance, in the presented work by [14], a time-optimal conflict free route, relying on a few waypoints, was generated by a kind of an adaptive GA that could facilitate the underwater vehicle for operating in a large terrain. A large scale AUV routing and task assignment joint problem has been investigated in [15] by transforming the problem space into a NP-hard graph context, in which the heuristic search nature of GA and PSO employed to find the best series of waypoints. The biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and PSO based route plane task assign system is provided by [16] for AUV’s real-time operation in a semi dynamic network. The merit of the proposed solution [15,16] is that being independent of the graph size that is not the case with most of deterministic algorithms such as the proposed mixed integer linear programming (MILP) applied for governing multiple AUVs in [17]. However, mentioned researches mostly focused on task/target assignment and time scheduling problems without considering dynamicity of the terrain and requirements for vehicles safe deployment. The vehicles’ routing strategies are not flexible like path planning methods in terms copping environmental prompt changes, but they give a general overview of the area that AUV should fly through (general route), which means cut off the operation area to smaller beneficent zone for vehicle’s deployment regardless of terrain’s dynamic behaviors.\nIt is apparent from the literature that existing approaches mainly are able to cover only a part of\nthis problem either task assignment together with time management or path planning with safety consideration. Respectively, this research contributes a reactive combinatorial conflict-free-task assignment scheme encompassing an adaptive global route and local path planning to cover shortcomings associated with each of the planners. The route planner, in this context, is capable of generating a time efficient route with the best sequence of tasks to ensure the AUV has a productive journey and reaches to the destination on-time, while the local path planner is responsible to generate collision-free optimum local path in smaller scale to handle prompt changes of the environment. In fact the path planner operates in the context of the global route planner concurrently in parallel, while a constant interaction and information sharing is carried out between both planners. Parallel execution of the planners speed up the computation process and refuses unnecessary computation of updates of whole terrain. On the other hand, passing the distance between waypoints may have delay due to dynamic unexpected changes in the environment. Compensation of the wasted time in dealing with raised difficulty inbreeds a requirement for proper re-planning scheme. Hence, route re-planning is performed to manage the lost time and improve the robustness and reactive ability of the AUV to the environmental changes.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2, the problem formulation is demonstrated.\nPSO paradigm and its application on vehicle’s global route planning and local path planning is provided in section 3. The discussion on simulation results is proposed in section 4, and section 5 concludes the paper\n2. Problem Formulation\nThe presented framework, in essence, is a decentralized model of high-level task assign route planner that searches for the tasks with the highest priority in a limited time and low level local path planning, in which the model involves a decision maker core for determining the continuation of the path planning or need of the re-assignment of new tasks. This process ensures that the vehicle executes as many tasks as possible and provides a secure adaptive deployment toward the destination without time dissipation. Therefore, the problem formulated in two steps as follows.\n2.1 Routing Problem Formulation\nThe mathematical representation of the AUVs’ routing problem should be simple enough to prevent extensive computations. Exploiting a priori knowledge of the underwater terrain, the initial step is to transform the problem space into a graph problem as depicted in Figure 2. The vehicle starts its mission from initial position of WP1:(x1,y1,z1) and should pass sufficient number of waypoints to reach the destination WPD:(xD,yD,zD). The waypoints’ location are randomized according to a uniform distribution of ~U(0,10000) for WPix,yand ~U(0,100) for WPiz. Waypoints in the terrain are connected with an arbitrary edge like qi from a set of q={q1,…,qm}, where m is the number of edges in the graph. Each edge of the network like qi is assigned with a specific task from a set of Task={Task1,…,Taskk} k∈m . Each task involves three parameters of priority ρi, absolute risk percentage ξT, and absolute completion time δT that are initialized randomly in advance. The goal is to find the optimum route through the given waypoints covering the maximum number of highest priority tasks with smallest risk percentage in a time interval that battery’s capacity allows. The route can be represented as Ri=(x1,y1,z1,…,xi,yi,zi,…,xD,yD,zD), where WPi:(xi,yi,zi) is the coordinate of any arbitrary waypoint in geographical frame. The mathematical representation of AUV’s route planning problem in 3D environment described by:\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\n\nij\nij\nij\nij\nT\nT\nT\nq\nijT\nAUV\nij\nij\nijijijij\nij Task\nV\nd t\nzzyyxxd\nq\nξ\nδ\nρ\n: δ\n)()()(\n:\n222\n(1)\n}1,0{,δ 00        \n   \nl V\nd lqtlqT n\nij i\nijT AUV\nij\nij\nn\nij i\nijijRoute (2)\nThe problem involves multiple objectives that should be satisfied during the optimization process.\nOne approach in solving multi-objective problems is to transform it into a constrained single-objective problem. In this regard, the objective function of the route planner is defined in a form of hybrid cost function comprising weighted functions that are required to be maximized or minimized. In this model, the total weight of route should be maximized while route travel time approaches the mission available time, presented by\n}1,0{,max ξ\nρ\n000\n   \n\n  \n  \n     \nlwlqwlqlqW n\nij i\nijij\nn\nij i\nijij\nn\nij i ij\nij\nijR (3)\n \n  Availab leRoute\nAvailab le\nn\nij i\nijT\nAUV\nij\nijAva ilab leRoute\nTT ts\nT V\nd lqTT\n\n  \n\n  \n \n        \nmax ..\nδminmin 0 (4)\nwhere TRoute is the required time to pass the route, TAvailable is the total mission time, l is the selection variable, tij is the required time to pass the distance dij between two waypoint of WPi and WPjthat includes the corresponding task’s completion time δTij, ρTij and ξTij are the priority and risk percentage of the task, respectively. The next step is generating time/distance optimum trajectory in smaller scale between each pair of waypoints included in optimum global route.\n2.2 Path Planning Problem Formulation\nThe main objective of the path planner is to find a time optimum collision-free local path ℘i (shortest path) between specific pair of waypoints in the presence different types of uncertain obstacles. The resultant path should be safe and flyable (feasible). Dynamicity of the operation terrain Γ3D addressed by encountering different type of static and floating obstacles Θ with uncertain position and velocity, where the floating obstacles affected by current flow. Obstacle’s velocity vectors and coordinates can be measured by the\nsonar sensors with a certain uncertainty modelled with a Gaussian distributions. The state of obstacle(s) continuously measured and sent to state predictor to provide the estimation of the future states of the obstacles for the local path planner. The state predictor estimates the obstacles behavior during the vehicles deployment in specified operation window. Three different type of obstacles are conducted in this study to evaluate the performance of the proposed path planner, in which the obstacle is presented by three components of position, radius and uncertainty Θ(i):(Θp,Θr,,ΘUr). The obstacle position Θp initialized using normal distribution of ~\uD835\uDCA9(0,σ2) bounded to position of start waypoint WPax,y,zand position of target waypoint WPbx,y,z , where σ2≈Θr. Therefore the obstacles position Θp on WPax,y,z<Θp< WPbx,y,z has a truncated normal distribution, where its probability density function defined as follows:\n  i r b zyx a zyx i p WPWP  ,,,, , (5)\n   \n\n\n  \n\n\n              i r\ni p a zyx\ni r\ni p b zyx\ni r\ni pb\nzyx a zyx i r i p\nWPWP WPWPf ,,,,\n2,,,, ),,,0;( (6)\nThe obstacle radius initialized using a Gaussian normal distribution of ~(0,100). Different type of considered obstacles in this research explained in the rest.\ni. Static Known Obstacles: The location of these obstacles is known in advance and their position\ncan be obtained from the offline map. No uncertainty growth considered for position of these type of obstacles (e.g. known rocks in the terrain). ii. Static Obstacles with Certain Growth of Uncertainty: These obstacles classified as the Quasistatic obstacles that usually known as no flying zones. The obstacles in this category has an\nuncertain radius varied in a specified bound with a Gaussian normal distribution ~(Θp,σ0), where the value of Θr in each iteration is independent of its previous value. iii. Moving Obstacles with Propagated Uncertainty in Position and Radius: Another type of\nconsidered obstacle is self-motivated moving obstacle that affected by current force and moving with a self-motivated velocity to a random direction, denoted by (7) and (8). Here, the effect of current presented by uncertainty propagation proportional to current magnitude URC=|VC| ~\uD835\uDCA9(0,0.3) that radiating out from the centre of the obstacle in a circular format, while it is: ),()1()(\n0  ppp Utt  (7)\n  \n\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n \n  \n\n  \n\n\n \n)(\n0 0 , 1 1 0 ,\n100\n010\n0)(1\n)1()(\n321\n3)1(21\ntU\nBB\ntU\nB\nBXBtBt\nC R\nC R\nUrtrr\n(8)\nwhere ΘUr~σ is the rate of change in objects position, andX(t-1)~\uD835\uDCA9(0,σ0)is the Gaussian normal distribution that assigned to each obstacle and gets updated in each iteration t.\nIn all cases, obstacle’s position and quantity initialized randomly with a Gaussian distributions in\noperating zone bundled to location of two waypoints that vehicle is required to travel. This operating zone shifts to next pair of waypoints in sequence provided by the global route planner. The proposed path planner in this study, generates the potential trajectories ℘i={℘1,℘2,…} using B-Spline curves captured from a set of control points like ϑ={ϑ1, ϑ2,…, ϑi,…, ϑn} in the problem space with coordinates of ϑ1:(x1,y1,z1),…, ϑn:(xn,yn,zn), where n is the number of corresponding control points. These control points play a substantial role in determining the optimal path. The mathematical description of the B-Spline coordinates is given by eq(9) and Figure 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\ni Kii\nn\ni Kii\nn\ni Kii\ntBztZ\ntBytY\ntBxtX\n1 ,\n1 ,\n1 ,\n)()(\n)()(\n)()(\n(9)\nwhere Bi,K(t) is the curve’s blending functions, t is the time step, and K is the order of the curve represents the smoothness of the curve, where bigger K correspond to smoother curves. For further information refer to [8].\nThe path travelled time Tpath-flight between two waypoints for℘ishould be minimized. The ocean current velocity is assumed to be constant. The path planner is applied in a small scale area, and the AUV considered to have constant thrust power; therefore, the battery usage for a path is a constant multiple of the time and distance travelled. Performance of the generated trajectory is evaluated based on overall collision avoidance capability and time consumption which is proportional to energy consumption and travelled distance. Obviously a specific amount of battery and time will be wasted for handling collision avoidance within path planning process. So that the remained time and energy should be updated after occurrence of an undesired event. Then, the optimum route to target should be re-planned based on new start position. Figure 2 is an example that clarifies process of this combinational strategy and despite the difference between them.\nGiven a candidate route in a sequence of waypoints (e.g. initial optimum route:{S-1-7-3-4-5-6-9-\n10-13-17-19-D} in Figure 2) along with environment information, the local path planner provides a trajectory to guide the vehicle to safely move through the waypoints. The provided trajectory is then sent to the guidance controller to generate the guidance commands for the vehicle. After visiting each waypoint, the re-planning criteria is investigated. If re-planning is required, the operation graph and mission available time get updated; then the global route planner is recalled to provide new optimum route based on mission updates(e.g. new optimum route:{ 9-8-10-16-D}). This process continues until mission ends and vehicle reaches the required waypoint.\n3. Overview of Particle Swarm Optimization\nThe PSO is one of the fastest optimization methods for solving variety of the complex problems and widely used in past decades. The process of PSO is initialized with a population of particles. Each particle involves a position and velocity in the search space. The position and velocity of each particle gets updated in each iteration. Then, the performance of particles evaluated according to the fitness/cost functions. Each particle has memory to save previous state values and the best position in its experience as the personal best PP-best and global best P G-best positions. The current state value of the particle is compared to the PP-best and P Gbest in each iteration. More detail about the algorithm can be found in [18]. Particle position and velocity gets updated using (10).\n    )()1()( )1()1()1()1()1()( 2211 ttt ttPrcttPrctt\nijijij\nij\nbestG\nijij\nbestP\nijijij\n\n\n\n  (10)\nwhere c1and c2 are acceleration coefficients, χi and υi are particle position and velocity at iteration t. r1 and r2 are two independent random numbers in [0,1]. ω exposes the inertia weight and balances the PSO algorithm between the local and global search. The PSO applied on both path planning and route planning problems. The argument for using the PSO in both route and path planning problems is strong enough due to its superior capability in scaling well with complex and multi-objective problems. The PSO operates in a continuous space originally and it is well suited for solving vehicles path planning problem due to continuous nature of this problem. However, a particular problem arises with proper coding of the particles as route candidate in implementation of PSO on vehicles global route planning due to discrete nature of search space in vehicle’s task assign-routing problem. To solve the raised problem with PSO, this research contributes a priority based route generation approach on the underlying search space (provided in section 3.2). These modifications increase the speed of the algorithm in finding optimum solution and prevent trapping in a local optima.\n3.1 Particle Swarm Optimization on Path Planning Approach\nThe path planning is an optimization problem in which the main goal is to minimize the travel distance and time, and avoid colliding obstacle(s). Water current may have positive or disturbing affect in this process, as an undesirable current can push floating obstacles across the AUV’s trajectory. The potential trajectories in this research generated using B-Spline curves obtained from control points. Each particle in the swarm assigned by a potential path. The position and velocity parameters of the particles corresponds to the coordinates of the B-spline control points ϑ that utilizes in path generation. As the PSO iterates, every particle is attracted towards its respective local attractor based on the outcome of the particle’s individual and swarm search. The pseudo code of the PSO algorithm and its mechanism on path planning process is provided in Figure 3.\n3.1.1 Generating Corresponding Control Points for B-Spline\nAll control points should be located in respective search region constraint to predefined bounds of βiϑ=[Uiϑ,Liϑ]. If ϑi:(xi,yi,zi) represent one control point in Cartesian coordinates in tth path iteration, Liϑ is the lower bound; and Uiϑ is the upper bound of all control points at (x-y-z) coordinates given by (11):\n],,...,,...,,[\n],,...,,...,,[\n],,...,,...,,[\n],,...,,...,,,[\n],,...,,...,,,[\n],,...,,...,,,[\n21)(\n21)(\n21)(\n11210)(\n11210)(\n11210)(\nniz\nniy\nnix\nniz\nniy\nnix\nzzzzU\nyyyyU\nxxxxU\nzzzzzL\nyyyyyL\nxxxxxL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(11)\nWith respect to given relations (11), each control point ϑi:(xi,yi,zi) is generated from (12):\n)()(\n)()(\n)()(\n)()()(\n)()()(\n)()()(\ni\nz\ni\nz\nz i i z i\ni\ny\ni\ny\ny\ni\ni\ny\ni\ni\nx\ni\nx\nx i i x i\nLURandLtz\nLURandLty\nLURandLtx\n\n\n\n\n\n (12)\nwhere (x0, y0, z0) and (xn, yn, zn) are the position of the start and target points in the local path planning, respectively.\n3.1.2 Path Optimality Evaluation\nThe main objective of the local path planner is to find a distance/time optimum collision free path ℘ between specific pair of waypoints. The resultant path should be safe and flyable (feasible). If the ϑ={ϑ1, ϑ2,…, ϑi,…, ϑn} is the sequence of control points along each arbitrary path ℘i, to evaluate a path, the path cost function defined based on total time ti≈Tpath-flight required to travel along the path segments. The generated path is evaluated by\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nsss zyx jzjzjyjyjxjx\nj zyx\njj\n,,\n2\n)()1(\n2\n)()1(\n2\n)()1(,,\n1 1\n)()()(\n,,\n\n (13)\n         \n1\n1\n1 3 1\n1\nAUV\nt i t ii\ntD\nn\niflightpath V\ntT\nii\ni\n  (14)\n \n\n\n\nN\nUrrpDj t j\nflightpath\njandtj\nts\nTCost\ni ),,()(},...,0{\n..\n)min(\n3 (15)\nwhere j is any arbitrary point from the generated path, ϑi is the control-point along the path℘. Cost℘ is the path cost function. It is assumed the vehicle moves with constant linear velocity VAUV. The corresponding generated path shouldn’t cross the forbidden area covered by obstacle Θ(NΘ):(Θp,Θr,,ΘUr), where NΘ is number of obstacles. The generated path gets penalty value for colliding any obstacle. This process in general promotes algorithms evolution capability toward proposing the optimum feasible solution.\n3.2 Particle Swarm Optimization on AUV’s Task Assign-Routing Problem\nWith respect to the combinatorial nature AUV’s routing and task allocation, which is analogous to both TSP and Knapsack problem, there should be a compromise among the mission available time, maximizing number of highest priority tasks with minimum risk percentage, and guaranteeing reaching to the predefined destination, which is combination of a discrete and a continuous optimization problem at the same time. To this end, the global route planner simultaneously tends to determine the optimum route in terrain network cluttered with several waypoints, trade-off between prioritizing the available tasks and managing the mission available time. The proposed time optimum global route may have several alternatives and generally contains optimum set of tasks with a proper sequence of waypoints, in which the tasks prioritized according to their priority value and tasks absolute risk percentage (regardless of terrain hazards). A general overview of the PSO mechanism on route planning is provided in a flowchart given in Figure 4.\nDeveloping a suitable coding scheme for particle representation is the most critical step in\nformulating the problem in a PSO framework. Hence, encoding the routes correctly into particles and efficient representation of the particles has direct impact on overall performance of the algorithm and optimality of the solutions.\n3.2.1 Particle Encoding (Initialization Phase of PSO- Route Generation)\nA particle in the proposed method corresponds to a feasible route vector including a sequence of nodes. The route vectors take variable length, but limited to maximum number of nodes included in the graph, since it never required for a route to include nodes more than whole number of nodes in the graph. The route should be feasible according to following criteria:\n A valid route should be commenced and ended with predefined start and target nodes.\n The generated route should not include edges that are not presented in the graph.\n The multiple appearance of the same node in a route makes it invalid.\n The route should not traverse an edge for more than once.\n The route travel time should not exceed the maximum range of AUVs’ total available time.\nA priority based strategy has been used in this research in order to generate feasible routes. For\nthis purpose some guiding information of priority is added to each node at the initial phase. The priority vector initialized randomly. The sequence of nodes are selected based on their corresponding value in priority vector and adjacency matrix (adjacency matrix represents relations and edges in a graph). To prevent generating infeasible routes some modifications have been applied as follows:\n Each node take positive or negative priority values in the specified range of [-100,100]. The selected node in a route sequence gets a large negative priority value that prevents repeated visits\nto a node.\n The visited edges get eliminated from the Adjacency matrix. So that, the selected edge will not be a candidate for future selection.\n Adjacency relations are used for adding nodes to a specific route, so that nodes are added to the route sequence one by one according to priority vector and adjacency matrix. Using the adjacency\ninformation prevents appearance of non-existed edges in the graph.\n To satisfy the termination criteria of a feasible route, if the route ends with a non-destination node and/or the length of the route exceeds the number of existed nodes in the graph, the last node of\nthe sequence gets be replaced by index of the destination node.\nAn example of the route generating process according to a sample adjacency matrix(Ad) of a graph\nwith 18 nodes and a random priority array (Ui) is presented by Figure 5. To generate a feasible route in a graph based on topological information, the first node is selected and added to the sequence as the start position. Then from adjacency matrix the connected nodes to node-1 is considered. In graph shown in Figure 5, this sequence is {2,3,4,5}. The node with the highest priority in this sequence is selected and\nadded to the route sequence as the next visited node. This procedure continue until a legitimate route is built (destination visited).\nThe termination of the PSO process can be defined according to completion of the maximum\nnumber of iterations, appearance of no change in population fitness after several iterations, and approaching to a stall generation. The most important step in finding an optimum route by PSO is forming an appropriate and efficient cost function, so that the algorithm tends to compute the cost value for each route to find the best fitted route with the minimum cost.\n3.2.2 Adaptive Route Re-planning\nAs mentioned earlier, the local path planner operates in context of the global route planner and concurrently tends to generate the safe collision-free path between pairs of waypoints encountering dynamicity of the terrain. The path absolute time Tpath-flight is calculated at the end of the trajectory. Traversing the distance between two specific waypoints may take more time than what expected (TExpected) due to dynamic unexpected changes in the environment. Compensation of the wasted time in dealing with raised difficulty, inbreeds a requirement for proper re-planning procedure. Obviously in such a case, a specific amount of battery and mission available time TAvaliableis wasted for handling raised difficulty within path planning process, so the TAvaliable should be updated after occurrence of an undesired event. Hence, the previous optimum route cannot be optimum anymore due to mentioned reason. In such a situation it is required to re-plan a new optimum route according mission updates. The process of the re-planning process is presented in Figure 6.\nIt would be computation and time dissipation for an AUV to pass a specific edge (distance) for\nmore than ones that means repeating a task for several times. Hence, if re-routing is required at any situation, the TAvaliable gets updated; the passed edges get eliminated from the operation network (so the search space shrinks); and the location of the present waypoint is considered as the new start position for\nboth local path planner and global route planner. Afterward, the global route planner tends to find the optimum route based on new information and updated network topology. Using such an adaptive replanning scheme improves the robustness and reactive ability of the AUV with respect to the environmental changes and compensates the time dissipation.\n3.2.3 Global Route Optimality Evaluation\nGiven a candidate route in a sequence of waypoints along with environmental information, the local path planner provides a trajectory to safely guide the vehicle through the waypoints. The route cost has direct relation to the passing distance among each pair of selected waypoints. Hence, the path cost\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC61℘ for any optimum local path gets used in the context of the global route planner. The model is seeking an optimal solution in the sense of the best combination of path, route, and task cost. After visiting each waypoint, the re-planning criteria is investigated. A computation cost encountered any time that re-planning is required. Thus, total cost for the model defined as:\n  AvailableRoutei\nAvailable\nn\nij i\nijT\nAUV\nij\nijRoute\nAvailableRouteRoute\nTTR\nts\nlT V\nCost lqCost\nTTCost\n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n  \n\nmax\n..\n}1,0{, 0  (16)\n}1,0{, 0       \n \nllqCost n\nij i Route\nRoute ijTask \n (17)\n  r\ncomputeRouteTaskTotal TCostCostCostCost 1 11 )( (18)\nwhere CostTask is the absolute cost of the task completion, δTij is completion time of the task assigned to qij, ξRoute and ρRoute respectively, represent the risk percentage and priority of the selected tasks in context of any candidate route sequence. CostRoute is a function of path costCost℘. Tcompute is the time required for checking the re-planning criteria and computing the new optimum route. r is the number of repeating the re-planning procedure. φ1andφ2 are two positive numbers that determine amount of participation of CostTask and CostRoute on calculation of total cost. Giving the appropriate value for coefficients of engaged factors in the cost function has a significant effect on performance of the model.\n4. Simulation Results and Discussion\nThe main purpose of the simulation experiments in this paper, is evaluating the performance of entire combinational model in terms of increasing mission productivity (task assignment and time management) and guaranteeing vehicles safety during the mission. To verify the efficiency of the proposed strategy, first the efficiency of the local path planner is individually assessed; afterward, its performance in context of the global route planner and overall system’s coherence and proficiency is investigated.\n4.1 Simulation Results for PSO Based Local Path Planner\nDuring deployment between two points, the local path planner can compromise dynamic changes of the environment. The purpose of path planner is to minimize the travel distance and time, and to avoid colliding obstacle(s). It is assumed the vehicles is moving with constant (3 m/s) velocity. The operating field is modelled as a realistic underwater environment that randomly covered by different uncertain static, floating and moving obstacles Θ, where the floating obstacles are affected by current force varied according to |VC|~(0,0.3).Three different scenarios are implemented in simulation of the environment for the local path planner. In the first one, the AUV starts its deployment in a pure static operating filed and it is required to pass the shortest collision free distance to reach to the specified target waypoint. Making the AUV’s mission more challenging, in the second scenario, the robustness of the method is tested in a dynamic environment in which obstacles are under the exposure of varying levels of position and radius uncertainty. In the third scenario, the terrain becomes more complicated by encountering the effect of current flow on floating obstacles. The purpose of increasing complexity of the obstacles is to evaluate sustainability of the path planner’s performance to complexity of the terrain and evaluating the ability of the method in balancing between searching unexplored operating filed and safely moving toward the target point. For this purpose, a distinctive number of runs are performed to analyze the performance of the method in satisfying the\nproblem constrains for all mentioned scenarios.The PSO optimization configuration also set as follows: the maximum number of iterations set on 100, the initial population size set on 150 particles, the expansioncontraction coefficient set on 2.0 and 2.5 over the 100 iterations. Number of control points for each Bspline path is set on 8. The performance of the algorithm for all scenarios represented in Figure 7 to 9 for different number of obstacles separately, where each obstacle generated randomly with uncertain position and radius in specified operating window between two particular waypoints.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 7.(a) 2D presentation of the generated path encountering random number of static known obstacles.

(b)Violation variation as collision penalty. (c)Path flight time variation in each iteration. (d)Algorithms performance on cost variation over 100 iterations.\nThe gradual increment of collision boundary of each obstacle has been presented in Figure 8(a)\nand 9(a) in which the uncertainty propagation is assumed linear with iteration. The trajectory should be regenerated simultaneously to avoid crossing the corresponding collision boundaries and this process repeated until vehicle reaches to the target waypoint. If vehicles trajectory does not cross inside the corresponding collision boundary, no collision will occur. As presented in Figures 7(b), 8(b), and 9(b) the algorithm efficiently manages the trajectory to eliminate the collision penalty within100 iterations. It is evident from Figure 7(a), 8(a), and 9(a) that the algorithm accurately satisfies the collision constraints encountering all types of obstacles. The path travel time is an important performance index that is proportional to path cost and should be minimized. It is inferable from Figure 7(c,d), 8(c,d), and 9(c,d), the algorithm accurately tends to minimize path travel time and path cost over 100 iterations, while the performance of the algorithm is almost stable against increasing the complexity of the terrain.\nAdditional to addressed common performance indexes discussed above, two other performance\nfactors are highlighted for the purpose of this research that are investigated along the evaluation of the global route planner. In this research, the first critical factors for the local path planner is the computational\ntime. The reason for highlighting this index is that the local path planner must operate concurrently and synchronous to the global route planner, thus a large computational time causes the local path planner drop behind the operation of the global path planner, which it flaws the routine flow and cohesion of the whole system. The second important performance index is the path flight time (TPath-flight) that should have a persuasive relation to the expected time (TExpected), in other words, existence a big gap between values of TPath-flight and TExpected is not acceptable. This issue is investigated at meantime with the evaluation of the global route planner along the checking process for requisition of the re-planning.\n4.2 Simulation Results for Reactive Global Route Planner\nThe main goal is to take maximum use of the mission time, to increase the mission productivity by optimum routing, to guarantee on-time termination of the mission; and concurrently ensuring the vehicles safety by copping dynamic unexpected challenges during vehicle’s deployment toward the final destination. The global route gives a general overview of the area that AUV should fly through by cutting off the operation area to smaller beneficent zone for vehicle’s deployment. It operates based on offline map information and does not deal with dynamic environmental changes as this issue is covered by the path planner that operates concurrently in an inner layer. This combinational strategy is able to furnish the addressed objectives by accurate synchronization of the inputs and outputs to the main model and concurrent cooperation of the global and local motion planners. Hence, the entire combinational scheme should be fast enough to track environmental changes, cope with dynamic changes, and carry out prompt re-planning to compute new route according to new updates.\nTo this end, a number of performance metrics have been investigated through 6 individual\nexperiment to evaluate the robustness and stability of the model in enhancement of the vehicles autonomy in terms of motion planning and task assignment. One of these metrics is the reliability percentage of the route representing the chance of the mission success, which is combination of route violation depending on travel time and feasibility of the route. Other metrics involve the number of completed tasks, total obtained weight, total cost, and the time optimality of the generated route with respect to complexity of the graph. These metrics altogether perform a single vehicles mission productivity in a specific time interval. The initial configuration of the operation network has been set on 30 waypoints and 985 edges involving a fixed sequence of tasks with specified characteristics (priority, risk percentage, completion time) in 10 km2 (xy),100 m (z)space. The waypoints location are randomized according to ~U(0,10000)for WPix,yand ~U(0,100) for WPiz. The mission available time for all experiments is fixed on TAvailable=9000(sec)=2.5(hours). The vehicle starts its mission at initial location WP1and end its mission at WP30. The operating field is modelled as a realistic underwater environment that randomly covered by different obstacles. The PSO configured with the same initial conditions of the local path planner. For the purposes of this study, the implementation was performed on a desktop PC with an Intel i7 3.40 GHz quadcore processor using MATLAB® R2014a.\nThe local path planner operates as an inner component in context of the global route planner and\noutput of each one concurrently feeds to another one. The full process of one experiment out of six separate missions is explained in Table.1(A-B) to clarify operation flow of the proposed combinational strategy in different stages of a specific mission toward carrying out the mentioned objectives.\nThe mission starts with calling the global route planner for the first time to produces a valid\noptimum route in order to take maximum use of available time (valid route TRoute ≤ TAvailable). Referring Table.1(A), the initial optimum route covers number of 7 tasks with total weight of 18and cost of 2.2097 with estimated completion time of TRoute=8597 (sec). In the second step, the local path planner is recalled to generate optimum collision free trajectory through the listed sequence of waypoint included in the initial route. Referring to Table.1(B), the local path planner got the first pair of waypoints (1-23) and generated optimum trajectory between location of WP1to location of WP23 with total cost of the 0.328, and travel time of Tpath=1476, which is smaller than expected travel time TExpected=1514.3. The TExpected for the local path planner is calculated based on estimated travel time for the generated route TRoute. In cases that Tpath is smaller than TExpected the re-planning flag would be zero which means the initial optimum route is still valid and optimum, so the vehicle is allowed the follow the next pair of waypoints included in initial optimum route. After each run of the local path planner, the path time Tpath is reduced from the total available time TAvailable. The second pair of waypoints (23-16) is shifted to the local path planner and the same process is repeated. However, if Tpath exceeds the TExpected, re-planning flag gets value of one, which means some of the available time is wasted in passing the distance between two waypoints due to copping collision avoidance, as it is happened for WP16to WP28.In such a case, the TAvailable gets updated and visited edges (1- 12, and 23-16) get eliminated from the graph. Afterward, instead of local path planner, the global route planner is recalled to generate new optimum route from the current waypoint WP28to the predefined destination WP30 according to updated operation network and TAvailable. In experimental results presented in Table.1, the global route planner is recalled for 5 times and the local path planner called for 10 times within 5 optimum routes. This synchronization among two global and local motion planners continues until vehicle reaches to the destination (success) or TAvailable gets a minus value (failure: vehicle runs out of battery). The final route passed by the vehicle in this mission through the 5 route re-planning and 10 path planning is the sequence of waypoints including {1-23-16-28-18-5-25-21-8-20-30} with total cost of 1.878, total weight of 22, and total time of 8912. From simulation results in Table.1(A), it is noted that in all cases route travelling time obtained by the PSO is smaller than total available time and violation value for all solutions is equal to zero that confirms feasibility of the produced route, which means the model acts according to defined constraints.\nThe most appropriate outcome for a mission is completion of the mission with the minimum\nremained time which means maximizing the use of mission available time. The provided results in Table.1(A) confirm that the model acts efficiently in terms of maximizing mission productivity by taking maximum use of the available time as TRoute approaches TAvailable. Referring Table.1(B), the remaining time is 87.8 second out of mission available time of TAvailable=9000(sec)=2.5(h), which is considerably approached to zero. Considering the fact that reaching to the destination, as a big concern for vehicles safety, is more important than maximizing the vehicles productivity, a big penalty value is assigned to global route planner to strictly prevent generating routes with TRoute bigger than TAvailable.\nTo measure the performance and stability of the proposed model in a quantitative manner, the\nrobustness of the model in enhancement of the vehicles autonomy in satisfying addressed objectives is evaluated by testing 6 missions’ through 6 individual experiments with the same initial condition that closely matches actual underwater mission scenarios, presented in Figure 10, 11 and12.\nIt is derived from simulation results in Figure 10 that the proposed architecture is capable of taking\nmaximum use of mission available time as apparently the mission time in all experiments approach the TAvailable and meet the above constraints denoted by the upper bound of 9000(sec) =2.5 hours, which presents the stability of the model in mission time management. It is evident from Figure 11 that the average cost variation of the global route planner in each experiment is centralized over the total cost of final route produced in the corresponding mission. It is also noteworthy to mention from analyze the results in Table.1(A-B) that the proposed methodology takes a very short computational time that makes it highly suitable for real-time application. The stability of both global and local planners in variation of the computational time in Figure 12, also confirm applicability the model for real-time implementation. More importantly, the violation percentage for both planners presented in Table.1, reveals robustness of the model to the variations of the operation network parameters and environmental conditions, so that the vehicle can compromise the dynamic challenges of the terrain and guarantee safe deployment and on-time completion of the mission.\n5. Conclusion\nThis paper focuses on developing a reactive combinational conflict-free-task assignment method based on reactive global route planning and collision-free local path planning that ensures the consistent situational awareness of the environment and guarantees a real-time implementation. Exploiting a priori knowledge of the underwater terrain, the global route planner generates a time efficient route with best sequence of tasks to be carried out to ensure the AUV has a beneficial operation and reaches to the destination on-time as it’s an obligatory requirement for vehicles safety. Along with an efficient route planner, a local path planner is produced in smaller scale to safely guide the vehicle through the specified waypoints in the global route with minimum time/energy cost. The employed PSO-based local path planner is efficient and fast enough to rapidly react to prompt changes of the environment and generate a collision-free optimum path. Re-route planning, meanwhile, is performed to compensate the wasted time in dealing with unexpected changes of the environment that promotes robustness and reactive ability of the AUV in such a severe environment.\nOn the other hand, stability of the model in time management is the most critical factor\nrepresenting robustness of the method. So that the value of the remaining time that has inverse relation to mission time, should be minimized but it should not be equal to zero. Minimizing the remaining time maximizes the mission productivity. The results obtained from analyze of 6 different missions, demonstrate the inherent robustness and drastic efficiency of the proposed scheme in enhancement of the vehicles autonomy in terms of mission productivity, mission time management.\nFor future works, the global route planner and local path planner would be developed to cover\nother considerations of the dynamic terrain and improve vehicles overall situational awareness based on current information and estimation of the one step forward.\n6.

    "abstractText" : "An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) needs to acquire a certain degree of autonomy for any particular underwater mission to fulfil the mission objectives successfully and ensure its safety in all stages of the mission in a large scale operating filed. In this paper, a novel combinatorial conflict-free-task assignment strategy consisting an interactive engagement of a local path planner and an adaptive global route planner, is introduced. The method is established upon the heuristic search potency of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to address the discrete nature of routing-task assignment approach and the complexity of NP-hard path planning problem. The proposed hybrid method, is highly efficient for having a reactive guidance framework that guarantees successful completion of missions specifically in cluttered environments. To examine the performance of the method in a context of mission productivity, mission time management and vehicle safety, a series of simulation studies are undertaken. The results of simulations declare that the proposed method is reliable and robust, particularly in dealing with uncertainties, and it can significantly enhance the level of vehicle’s autonomy by relying on its reactive nature and capability of providing fast feasible solutions.
