ADRs are one of most common causes to withdraw some drugs from market [1 ]. Now two major methods for detecting ADRs are spontaneous reporting system (SRS) [ 2 , 3 ], and prescription event monitoring (PEM) [ 4 , 5 ]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a signal in pharmacovigilance as \"any reported information on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug, the relationship being unknown or incompletely documented previously\"[ 6]. For spontaneous reporting system, many machine learning methods are used to detect ADRs, such as Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) [7], decision support method [8], genetic algorithm [9], knowledge based approach [10], etc. One limitation is the reporting mechanism to submit ADR reports [8], which has serious underreporting and is not able to accurately quantify the corresponding risk. Another limitation is hard to detect ADRs with small number of occurrences of each drug-event association in the database.\nIn this paper we propose feature selection approach to detect ADRs from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. First feature matrix, which represents the medical events for the patients before and after taking drugs, is created by linking patients' prescriptions and corresponding medical events together. Then significant features are selected based on feature selection methods, comparing the feature matrix before patients take drugs with one after patients take drugs. Finally the significant ADRs can be detected from thousands of medical events based on corresponding features. Experiments are carried out on the drug Simvastatin. Good performance is achieved."

      "heading" : "A. The Extraction of Feature Matrix",
      "text" : "To detect the ADRs of drugs, first feature matrix is extracted from THIN database, which describes the medical events that patients occur before or after taking drugs. Then feature selection method of Student's t-test is performed to select the significant features from feature matrix containing thousands of medical events. Figure 1 shows the process to detect the ADRs using feature matrix. Feature matrix A describes the medical events for each patient during 60 days before they take drugs. Feature matrix B reflects the medical events during 60 days after patients take drugs. In order to reduce the effect of the small events, and save the computation time and space, we set 100 patients as a group. Matrix X and Y are feature matrix after patients are divided into groups."

      "text" : "Medical events or symptoms are represented by medical\ncodes or Readcodes. There are 103387 types of medical events in \"Readcodes\" database. The Read Codes used in general practice (GP), were invented and developed by Dr James Read in 1982. The NHS (National Health Service) has expanded the codes to cover all areas of clinical practice. The code is hierarchical from left to right or from level 1 to level 5. It means that it gives more detailed information from level 1 to level 5. Table 1 shows the medical symptoms based on Readcodes at level 3 and at level 5. 'Other soft tissue disorders' is general term using Readcodes at level 3. `Foot pain', 'Heel pain', etc., give more details using Readcodes at level 5."

      "text" : "Simvastatin [20], under the trade name Zocor, is a hypolipidemic drug used to control elevated cholesterol, or hypercholesterolemia. It is a member of the statin class of pharmaceuticals. Simvastatin has side effects [20,21,22]: severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue; unusual hoarseness); burning, numbness, or tingling; change in the amount of urine produced; confusion; dark or red-colored urine; decreased sexual ability; depression; dizziness; fast or irregular heartbeat; fever, chills, or persistent sore throat; joint pain; loss of appetite; memory problems; muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness (with or without fever and fatigue); pale stools; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin; severe or persistent nausea or stomach or back pain; shortness of breath; trouble sleeping; unusual bruising or bleeding; unusual tiredness or weakness; vomiting; yellowing of the skin or eyes.\n14905 patients from 20GP data in THIN database are taking Simvastatin, and 13060 medical events are obtained based on Readcodes at level 1-5. After grouping them, 149x13060 feature matrix is obtained. For Readcodes at level 1-3, 149x2693 feature matrix is obtained.\nTable 2 shows the top 30 detected results in ascending order of p value of Student's t-test, using Readcodes at level 1-5 and at level 1-3. The detected results are using p value less than 0.05, which represent the significant change after patients take the drug. Table 3 shows the results in descending order of the ratio of the number of patients after taking the drug to one before taking the drug. Table 4 shows potential ADRs related cancer for Simvastatin. The detected ADRs are based on our computerized method, further investigation is needed.\nIt is clear that our detected results are consistent with published side effects for statin drugs [21, 22]. Major ADRs of 'muscle and musculoskeletal' events for statin drugs are detected not only based on Readcodes at level 1-5, but also based on Readcodes at level 1-3.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this study we propose a novel method to successfully detect the ADRs using feature matrix and feature selection. A feature matrix, which characterizes the medical events before patients take drugs or after patients take drugs, is created from THIN database. The feature selection method of Student's t-test is used to detect the significant features from thousands of medical events. The significant ADRs, which are corresponding to significant features, are detected. Experiments are performed on the drug Simvastatin. Compared to other computerized method, our proposed method achieves good performance.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.
