This Semantic Networks is used to describe the knowledge of an \"ideal\" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximate and uncertain knowledge of novice users who intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from an \"ideal\" expert. The technical system we consider is a word processor software, with Objects such as \"Word\" and Goals such as \"Cut\" or \"Copy\". We suggest to consider the set of the system's Goals as a set of linguistic variables to which corresponds a set of possible linguistic values based on the fuzzy set. We consider, therefore, a set of interpretation's levels for these possible values to which corresponds a set of membership functions. We also propose a method to measure the similarity degree between different fuzzy linguistic variables for the partition of the semantic network in class of similar objects to make easy the diagnosis of the user's fuzzy queries.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Jun 2012 20:05:48 GMT  (102kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1061v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mohamed nazih omri", "mohamed ali mahjoub"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.1061"}
