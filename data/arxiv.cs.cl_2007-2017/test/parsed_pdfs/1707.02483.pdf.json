      "text" : "Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental information extraction task that automatically detects named entities in text and classifies them into pre-defined entity types such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, GPE (GeoPolitical Entities),\nEVENT, LOCATION, TIME, DATE, etc. NER provides essential inputs for many information extraction applications, including relation extraction, entity linking, question answering and text mining. Building fast and accurate NER systems is a crucial step towards enabling large-scale automated information extraction and knowledge discovery on the huge volumes of electronic documents existing today.\nThe state-of-the-art NER systems are supervised machine learning models (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007), including maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) (McCallum et al., 2000), conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) and neural networks (Collobert et al., 2011; Lample et al., 2016). To achieve high accuracy, a NER system needs to be trained with a large amount of manually annotated data, and is often supplied with language-specific resources (e.g., gazetteers, word clusters, etc.). Annotating NER data by human is rather expensive and timeconsuming, and can be quite difficult for a new language. This creates a big challenge in building NER systems of multiple languages for supporting multilingual information extraction applications.\nThe difficulty of acquiring supervised annotation raises the following question: given a welltrained NER system in a source language (e.g., English), how can one go about extending it to a new language with decent performance and no human annotation in the target language? There are mainly two types of approaches for building weakly supervised cross-lingual NER systems.\nThe first type of approaches create weakly labeled NER training data in a target language. One way to create weakly labeled data is through annotation projection on aligned parallel corpora or translations between a source language and a target language, e.g., (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Zitouni and Florian, 2008; Ehrmann et al., 2011). Another way is to utilize the text and structure of\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n02 48\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nJ ul\n2 01\n7\nWikipedia to generate weakly labeled multilingual training annotations, e.g., (Richman and Schone, 2008; Nothman et al., 2013; Al-Rfou et al., 2015).\nThe second type of approaches are based on direct model transfer, e.g., (Täckström et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2016). The basic idea is to train a single NER system in the source language with language independent features, so the system can be applied to other languages using those universal features.\nIn this paper, we make the following contributions to weakly supervised cross-lingual NER with no human annotation in the target languages. First, for the annotation projection approach, we develop a heuristic, language-independent data selection scheme that seeks to select good-quality projection-labeled NER data from comparable corpora. Experimental results show that the data selection scheme can significantly improve the accuracy of the target-language NER system when the alignment quality is low and the projectionlabeled data are noisy.\nSecond, we propose a new approach for direct NER model transfer based on representation projection. It projects word representations in vector space (word embeddings) from a target language to a source language, to create a universal representation of the words in different languages. Under this approach, the NER system trained for the source language can be directly applied to the target language without the need for re-training.\nFinally, we design two co-decoding schemes that combine the outputs (views) of the two projection-based systems to produce an output that is more accurate than the outputs of individual systems. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches on both in-house and open NER data sets for a number of target languages. The results show that the combined systems outperform the state-of-the-art cross-lingual NER approaches proposed in Täckström et al. (2012), Nothman et al. (2013) and Tsai et al. (2016) on the CoNLL NER test data (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).\nWe organize the paper as follows. In Section 2 we introduce three NER models that are used in the paper. In Section 3 we present an annotation projection approach with effective data selection. In Section 4 we propose a representation projection approach for direct NER model transfer. In Section 5 we describe two co-decoding schemes that effectively combine the outputs of\ntwo projection-based approaches. In Section 6 we evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches. We describe related work in Section 7 and conclude the paper in Section 8."

      "text" : "Conditional random fields (CRFs) are a class of discriminative probabilistic graphical models that provide powerful tools for labeling sequential data (Lafferty et al., 2001). CRFs learn a conditional probability model pλ(l|x) from a set of labeled training data, where x = (x1, ...,xn) is a random sequence of input words, l = (l1, ..., ln) is the sequence of label variables (NER tags) for x, and l has certain Markov properties conditioned on x. Specifically, a general-order CRF with order o assumes that label variable li is dependent on a fixed number o of previous label variables li−1, ..., li−o, with the following conditional distribution:\npλ(l|x) = e ∑n i=1 ∑K k=1 λkfk(li,li−1,...,li−o,x)\nZλ(x) (1)\nwhere fk’s are feature functions, λk’s are weights of the feature functions (parameters to learn), and Zλ(x) is a normalization constant. When o = 1, we have a first-order CRF which is also known as a linear-chain CRF.\nGiven a set of labeled training data D = (x(j), l(j))j=1,...,N , we seek to find an optimal set of parameters λ∗ that maximize the conditional log-likelihood of the data:\nλ∗ = arg max λ N∑ j=1 log pλ(l (j)|x(j)) (2)\nOnce we obtain λ∗, we can use the trained model pλ∗(l|x) to decode the most likely label sequence l∗ for any new input sequence of words x (via the Viterbi algorithm for example):\nl∗ = arg max l pλ∗(l|x) (3)\nA related conditional probability model, called maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM) (McCallum et al., 2000), assumes that l is a Markov\nchain conditioned on x:\npλ(l|x) = n∏ i=1 pλ(li|li−1, ..., li−o,x)\n= n∏ i=1 e ∑K k=1 λkfk(li,li−1,...,li−o,x) Zλ(li−1, ..., li−o,x) (4)\nThe main difference between CRFs and MEMMs is that CRFs normalize the conditional distribution over the whole sequence as in (1), while MEMMs normalize the conditional distribution per token as in (4). As a result, CRFs can better handle the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001). This benefit, however, comes at a price. The training time of order-o CRFs grows exponentially (O(Mo+1)) with the number of output labels M , which is typically slow even for moderate-size training data ifM is large. In contrast, the training time of order-o MEMMs is linear (O(M)) with respect to M independent of o, so it can handle larger training data with higher order of dependency. We have implemented both a linear-chain CRF model and a general-order MEMM model."

We adopt a locally normalized model (the conditional distribution is normalized per token as in MEMMs) and introduce context dependency by conditioning on the previously assigned tags. We use a target word and its surrounding context as features. We do not use other common features such as gazetteers or character-level representations as such features might not be readily available or might not transfer to other languages.\nWe have deployed two neural network architectures. The first one (called NN1) uses the word embedding of a word as the input. The second one (called NN2) adds a smoothing prototype layer that computes the cosine similarity between a word embedding and a fixed set of prototype vectors (learned during training) and returns a weighted average of these prototype vectors as the input. In our experiments we find that with the\nsmoothing layer, NN2 tends to have a more balanced precision and recall than NN1. Both networks have one hidden layer, with sigmoid and softmax activation functions on the hidden and output layers respectively. The two neural network models are depicted in Figure 1."

      "text" : "The existing annotation projection approaches require parallel corpora or translations between a source language and a target language with alignment information. In this paper, we develop a heuristic, language-independent data selection scheme that seeks to select good-quality projection-labeled data from noisy comparable corpora. We use English as the source language.\nSuppose we have comparable1 sentence pairs (X,Y) between English and a target language, where X includes N English sentences x(1), ...,x(N), Y includes N target-language sentences y(1), ...,y(N), and y(j) is aligned to x(j) via an alignment model, 1 ≤ j ≤ N . We use a sentence pair (x,y) as an example to illustrate how the annotation projection procedure works, where x = (x1, x2, ..., xs) is an English sentence, and y = (y1, y2, ..., yt) is a target-language sentence that is aligned to x.\nAnnotation Projection Procedure\n1. Apply the English NER system on the English sentence x to generate the NER tags l = (l1, l2, ..., ls) for x.\n2. Project the NER tags to the target-language sentence y using the alignment information. Specifically, if a sequence of English words (xi, ..., xi+p) is aligned to a sequence of target-language words (yj , ..., yj+q), and (xi, ..., xi+p) is recognized (by the English NER system) as an entity with NER tag l,\n1Ideally, the sentences would be translations of each other, but we only require possibly parallel sentences.\nthen (yj , ..., yj+q) is labeled with l2. Let l′ = (l′1, l ′ 2, ..., l ′ t) be the projected NER tags for the target-language sentence y.\nWe can apply the annotation projection procedure on all the sentence pairs (X,Y), to generate projected NER tags L′ for the target-language sentences Y. (Y, L′) are automatically labeled NER data with no human annotation in the target language. One can use those projection-labeled data to train an NER system in the target language. The quality of such weakly labeled NER data, and consequently the accuracy of the target-language NER system, depend on both 1) the accuracy of the English NER system, and 2) the alignment accuracy of the sentence pairs.\nSince we don’t require actual translations, but only comparable data, the downside is that if some of the data are not actually parallel and if we use all for weakly supervised learning, the accuracy of the target-language NER system might be adversely affected. We are therefore motivated to design effective data selection schemes that can select good-quality projection-labeled data from noisy data, to improve the accuracy of the annotation projection approach for cross-lingual NER."

We construct a frequency table T which includes all the entities in the projectionlabeled target-language sentences. For each entity e, T also includes the projected NER tags for e and the relative frequency (empirical probability) P̂ (l|e) that entity e is labeled with tag l. Table 1 shows a snapshot of the frequency table where the target language is Portuguese.\nWe use P̂ (l|e) to measure the reliability of labeling entity e with tag l in the target language. The intuition is that if an entity e is labeled by a tag l with higher frequency than other tags in the projection-labeled data, it is more likely that the annotation is correct. For example, if the joint accuracy of the source NER system and alignment system is greater than 0.5, then the correct tag of a random entity will have a higher relative frequency than other tags in a large enough sample.\nBased on the frequency scores, we calculate the quality score of a projection-labeled target-\n2If the IOB (Inside, Outside, Beginning) tagging format is used, then (yj , yj+1, ..., yj+q) is labeled with (B-l, I-l,...,I-l).\nlanguage sentence y by averaging the frequency scores of the projected entities in the sentence:\nq(y) = Σe∈yP̂ (l ′(e)|e) n(y)\n(5)\nwhere l′(e) is the projected NER tag for e, and n(y) is the total number of entities in sentence y.\nWe use q(y) to measure the annotation quality of sentence y, and n(y) to measure the amount of annotation information contained in sentence y. We design a heuristic data selection scheme which selects projection-labeled sentences in the target language that satisfy the following condition:\nq(y) ≥ q; n(y) ≥ n (6)\nwhere q is a quality score threshold and n is an entity number threshold. We can tune the two parameters to make tradeoffs among the annotation quality of the selected sentences, the annotation information contained in the selected sentences, and the total number of sentence selected.\nOne way to select the threshold parameters q and n is via a development set - either a small set of human-annotated data or a sample of the projection-labeled data. We select the threshold parameters via coordinate search using the development set: we first fix n = 3 and search the best q̂ in [0, 0.9] with a step size of 0.1; we then fix q = q̂ and select the best n̂ in [1, 5] with a step size of 1."

The alignment systems between English and the target languages are maximum entropy models (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005), with an accuracy of 69.4/62.0/76.1/88.0 F1 score on independent Japanese/Korean/German/Portuguese alignment test sets.\nFor each target language, we randomly select 5% of the projection-labeled data as the development set and the remaining 95% as the training set. We compare an NER system trained with all the projection-labeled training data with no data selection (i.e., (q, n) = (0, 0)) and an NER system trained with projection-labeled data selected by the data selection scheme where the development set is used to select the threshold parameters q and n via coordinate search. Both NER systems are 2nd-order MEMM models3 which use the same template of features.\nThe results are shown in Table 2. For different target languages, we use the same source (English) NER system for annotation projection, so the differences in the accuracy improvements are mainly due to the alignment quality of the comparable corpora between English and different target languages.

However, confidence scores of two weakly supervised systems may not be directly comparable, especially when comparing O tags with non-O tags (i.e., entity tags). We consider an exclude-O confidence-based co-decoding scheme which we find to be more effective empirically. It is similar to the pure confidence-based scheme, with the only difference that it always prefers a non-O tag of one system to an O tag of the other system, regardless of their confidence scores.\nIn our experiments we find that the annotation projection system tends to have a high precision and low recall, i.e., it detects fewer entities, but for the detected entities the accuracy is high. The representation projection system tends to have a more balanced precision and recall. Based on this observation, we develop the following rank-based co-decoding scheme that gives higher priority to the high-precision annotation projection system:\n1.

For example, suppose the output tag sequence of annotation projection is (B-PER,O,O,O,O), of representation projection is (B-ORG,I-ORG,O,B-LOC,I-LOC), then the combined output under the rank-based scheme will be (B-PER,O,O,B-LOC,I-LOC).\n4Two entities detected by two different systems conflict with each other if either 1) the two entities have different spans but overlap with each other; or 2) the two entities have the same span but with different NER tags."

Wang and Manning (2014) proposed a variant of annotation projection which projects expectations of tags and uses them as constraints to train a model based on generalized expectation criteria. Annotation projection has also been applied to several other cross-lingual NLP tasks, including word sense disambiguation (Diab and Resnik, 2002), part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Yarowsky et al., 2001) and dependency parsing (Rasooli and Collins, 2015).\nWikipedia has been exploited to generate weakly labeled multilingual NER training data. The basic idea is to first categorize Wikipedia pages into entity types, either based on manually constructed rules that utilize the category information of Wikipedia (Richman and Schone, 2008) or Freebase attributes (Al-Rfou et al., 2015), or via a classifier trained with manually labeled Wikipedia pages (Nothman et al., 2013). Heuristic rules are then developed in these works to automatically label the Wikipedia text with NER tags. Ni and Florian (2016) built high-accuracy, high-coverage multilingual Wikipedia entity type mappings using weakly labeled data and applied those mappings as decoding constrains or dictionary features\nto improve multilingual NER systems. For direct NER model transfer, Täckström et al. (2012) built cross-lingual word clusters using monolingual data in source/target languages and aligned parallel data between source and target languages. The cross-lingual word clusters were then used to generate universal features. Tsai et al. (2016) applied the cross-lingual wikifier developed in (Tsai and Roth, 2016) and multilingual Wikipedia dump to generate languageindependent labels (FreeBase types and Wikipedia categories) for n-grams in a document, and those labels were used as universal features.\nDifferent ways of obtaining cross-lingual embeddings have been proposed in the literature. One approach builds monolingual representations separately and then brings them to the same space typically using a seed dictionary (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Faruqui and Dyer, 2014). Another line of work builds inter-lingual representations simultaneously, often by generating mixed language corpora using the supervision at hand (aligned sentences, documents, etc.) (Vulić and Moens, 2015; Gouws et al., 2015). We opt for the first solution in this paper because of its flexibility: we can map all languages to English rather than requiring separate embeddings for each language pair. Additionally we are able to easily add a new language without any constraints on the type of data needed. Note that although we do not specifically create interlingual representations, by training mappings to the common language, English, we are able to map words in different languages to a common space. Similar approaches for cross-lingual model transfer have been applied to other NLP tasks such as document classification (Klementiev et al., 2012), dependency parsing (Guo et al., 2015) and POS tagging (Gouws and Søgaard, 2015)."

      "text" : "In this paper, we developed two weakly supervised approaches for cross-lingual NER based on effective annotation and representation projection. We also designed two co-decoding schemes that combine the two projection-based systems in an intelligent way. Experimental results show that the combined systems outperform three state-ofthe-art cross-lingual NER approaches, providing a strong baseline for building cross-lingual NER systems with no human annotation in target languages."

However, annotating NER data by human is expensive and time-consuming, and can be quite difficult for a new language. In this paper, we present two weakly supervised approaches for cross-lingual NER with no human annotation in a target language. The first approach is to create automatically labeled NER data for a target language via annotation projection on comparable corpora, where we develop a heuristic scheme that effectively selects goodquality projection-labeled data from noisy data. The second approach is to project distributed representations of words (word embeddings) from a target language to a source language, so that the sourcelanguage NER system can be applied to the target language without re-training. We also design two co-decoding schemes that effectively combine the outputs of the two projection-based approaches. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches on both in-house and open NER data for several target languages. The results show that the combined systems outperform three other weakly supervised approaches on the CoNLL data.",
