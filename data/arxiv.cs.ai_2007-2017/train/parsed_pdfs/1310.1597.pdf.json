      "text" : "Supervised statistical learning methods have enjoyed great popularity in Natural Language Processing (NLP) over the past decade. The success of supervised methods depends heavily upon the availability of large amounts of annotated training data. Manual curation of annotated corpora is a costly and time consuming process. To date, most annotated resources resides within the English language, which\nhinders the adoption of supervised learning methods in many multilingual environments.\nTo minimize the need for annotation, significant progress has been made in developing unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches to NLP (Collins and Singer 1999; Klein 2005; Liang 2005; Smith 2006; Goldberg 2010; inter alia) . More recent paradigms for semi-supervised learning allow modelers to directly encode knowledge about the task and the domain as constraints to guide learning (Chang et al., 2007; Mann and McCallum, 2010; Ganchev et al., 2010). However, in a multilingual setting, coming up with effective constraints require extensive knowledge of the foreign1 language.\nBilingual parallel text (bitext) lends itself as a medium to transfer knowledge from a resource-rich language to a foreign languages. Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) project labels produced by an English tagger to the foreign side of bitext, then use the projected labels to learn a HMM model. More recent work applied the projection-based approach to more language-pairs, and further improved performance through the use of type-level constraints from tag dictionary and feature-rich generative or discriminative models (Das and Petrov, 2011; Täckström et al., 2013).\nIn our work, we propose a new project-based method that differs in two important ways. First, we never explicitly project the labels. Instead, we project expectations over the labels. This pseudo-\n1For experimental purposes, we designate English as the resource-rich language, and other languages of interest as “foreign”.

Secondly, we encode the expectations as constraints and train a model by minimizing divergence between model expectations and projected expectations in a Generalized Expectation (GE) Criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2010) framework.\nWe evaluate our approach on Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for English-Chinese and English-German language pairs on standard public datasets. We report results in two settings: a weakly supervised setting where no labeled data or a small amount of labeled data is available, and a semisupervised settings where labeled data is available, but we can gain predictive power by learning from unlabeled bitext."

      "text" : "Most semi-supervised learning approaches embody the principle of learning from constraints. There are two broad categories of constraints: multi-view constraints, and external knowledge constraints.\nExamples of methods that explore multi-view constraints include self-training (Yarowsky, 1995; McClosky et al., 2006),2 co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Sindhwani et al., 2005), multiview learning (Ando and Zhang, 2005; Carlson et al., 2010), and discriminative and generative model combination (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008; Druck and McCallum, 2010).\nAn early example of using knowledge as constraints in weakly-supervised learning is the work by Collins and Singer (1999). They showed that the addition of a small set of “seed” rules greatly improve a co-training style unsupervised tagger. Chang et al. (2007) proposed a constraint-driven learning (CODL) framework where constraints are used to guide the selection of best self-labeled examples to be included as additional training data in an iterative EM-style procedure. The kind of constraints used in applications such as NER are the ones like “the words CA, Australia, NY are LOCATION” (Chang et al., 2007). Notice the similarity of this particu-\n2A multi-view interpretation of self-training is that the selftagged additional data offers new views to learners trained on existing labeled data.\nlar constraint to the kinds of features one would expect to see in a discriminative model such as MaxEnt. The difference is that instead of learning the validity (or weight) of this feature from labeled examples — since we do not have them — we can constrain the model using our knowledge of the domain. Druck et al. (2009) also demonstrated that in an active learning setting where annotation budget is limited, it is more efficient to label features than examples. Other sources of knowledge include lexicons and gazetteers (Druck et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2007).\nWhile it is straight-forward to see how resources such as a list of city names can give a lot of mileage in recognizing locations, we are also exposed to the danger of over-committing to hard constraints. For example, it becomes problematic with city names that are ambiguous, such as Augusta, Georgia.3 To soften these constraints, Mann and McCallum (2010) proposed the Generalized Expectation (GE) Criteria framework, which encodes constraints as a regularization term over some score function that measures the divergence between the model’s expectation and the target expectation. The connection between GE and CODL is analogous to the relationship between hard (Viterbi) EM and soft EM, as illustrated by Samdani et al. (2012).\nAnother closely related work is the Posterior Regularization (PR) framework by Ganchev et al. (2010). In fact, as Bellare et al. (2009) have shown, in a discriminative model these two methods optimize exactly the same objective.4 The two differ in optimization details: PR uses a EM algorithm to approximate the gradients which avoids the expensive computation of a covariance matrix between features and constraints, whereas GE directly calculates the gradient. However, later results (Druck, 2011) have shown that using the Expectation Semiring techniques of Li and Eisner (2009), one can compute the exact gradients of GE in a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) at costs\n3This is a city in the state of Georgia in USA, famous for its golf courses. It is ambiguous since both Augusta and Georgia can also be used as person names.\n4The different terminology employed by GE and PR may be confusing to discerning readers, but the “expectation” in the context of GE means the same thing as “marginal posterior” as in PR.\nno greater than computing the gradients of ordinary CRF. And empirically, GE tends to perform more accurately than PR (Bellare et al., 2009; Druck, 2011).\nObtaining appropriate knowledge resources for constructing constraints remain as a bottleneck in applying GE and PR to new languages. However, a number of past work recognizes parallel bitext as a rich source of linguistic constraints, naturally captured in the translations. As a result, bitext has been effectively utilized for unsupervised multilingual grammar induction (Alshawi et al., 2000; Snyder et al., 2009), parsing (Burkett and Klein, 2008), and sequence labeling (Naseem et al., 2009).\nA number of recent work also explored bilingual constraints in the context of simultaneous bilingual tagging, and showed that enforcing agreements between language pairs give superior results than monolingual tagging (Burkett et al., 2010; Che et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). They also demonstrated a uptraining (Petrov et al., 2010) setting where taginduced bitext can be used as additional monolingual training data to improve monolingual taggers. A major drawback of this approach is that it requires a readily-trained tagging models in each languages, which makes a weakly supervised setting infeasible. Another intricacy of this approach is that it only works when the two models have comparable strength, since mutual agreements are enforced between them.\nProjection-based methods can be very effective in weakly-supervised scenarios, as demonstrated by Yarowsky and Ngai (2001), and Xi and Hwa (2005). One problem with projected labels is that they are often too noisy to be directly used as training signals. To mitigate this problem, Das and Petrov (2011) designed a label propagation method to automatically induce a tag lexicon for the foreign language to smooth the projected labels. Fossum and Abney (2005) filter out projection noise by combining projections from from multiple source languages. However, this approach is not always viable since it relies on having parallel bitext from multiple source languages. Li et al. (2012) proposed the use of crowd-sourced Wiktionary as additional resources for inducing tag lexicons. More recently, Täckström et al. (2013) combined token-level and type-level constraints to constrain legitimate label sequences and and recalibrate the probability distri-\nbution in a CRF. The tag dictionary used for POS tagging are analogous to the gazetteers and name lexicons used for NER by Chang et al. (2007).\nOur work is also closely related to Ganchev et al. (2009). They used a two-step projection method similar to Das and Petrov (2011) for dependency parsing. Instead of using the projected linguistic structures as ground truth (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), or as features in a generative model (Das and Petrov, 2011), they used them as constraints in a PR framework. Our work differs by projecting expectations rather than Viterbi one-best labels. We also choose the GE framework over PR. Experiments in Bellare et al. (2009) and Druck (2011) suggest that in a discriminative model (like ours), GE is more accurate than PR."

      "text" : "Given bitext between English and a foreign language, our goal is to learn a CRF model in the foreign language from little or no labeled data. Our method performs Cross-Lingual Pseudo-Projection Expectation Regularization (CLiPPER).\nFigure 1 illustrates the high-level workflow. For every aligned sentence pair in the bitext, we first compute the posterior marginal at each word position on the English side using a pre-trained English CRF tagger; then for each aligned English word, we project its posterior marginal as expectations to the aligned word position on the foreign side.\nWe would like to learn a CRF model in the foreign language that has similar expectations as the projected expectations from English. To this end, we adopt the Generalized Expectation (GE) Criteria framework introduced by Mann and McCallum (2010). In the remainder of this section, we follow the notation used in (Druck, 2011) to explain our approach."

      "text" : "The general idea of GE is that we can express our preferences over models through constraint functions. A desired model should satisfy the imposed constraints by matching the expectations on these constraint functions with some target expectations (attained by external knowledge like lexicons or in our case transferred knowledge from English). We\ndefine a constraint function φi,lj for each word position i and output label assignment lj as a label identity indicator:\nφi,lj (y) = { 1 if lj = yi and Ai 6= ∅ 0 otherwise\nThe set {l1, · · · , lm} denotes all possible label assignment for each yi, and m is number of label values. Ai is the set of English words aligned to Chinese word i. The condition Ai 6= ∅ specifies that the constraint function applies only to Chinese word positions that have at least one aligned English word. Each φi,lj (y) can be treated as a Bernoulli random variable, and we concatenate the set of all φi,lj into a random vector φ(y), where φk = φi,lj if k = i ∗m+ j. We drop the (y) in φ for simplicity.\nThe target expectation over φi,lj , denoted as φ̃i,lj , is the expectation of assigning label lj to English word Ai5 under the English conditional probability model.\nThe expectation over φ under a conditional probability model P (y|x;θ) is denoted as EP (y|x;θ)[φ], and simplified as Eθ[φ] whenever it is unambiguous.\nThe conditional probability model P (y|x;θ) in our case is defined as a standard linear-chain CRF:6\nP (y|x;θ) = 1 Z(x;θ) exp ( n∑ i θf(x, yi, yi−1) ) 5An English word aligned to foreign word at position i. When multiple English words are aligned to the same foreign word, we average the expectations.\n6We simplify notation by dropping the L2 regularizer in the CRF definition, but apply it in our experiments.\nwhere f is a set of feature functions; θ are the matching parameters to learn; n = |x|.\nThe objective function to maximize in a standard CRF is the log probability over a collection of labeled documents:\nLCRF (θ) = a′∑ a=1 logP (y∗a|xa;θ) (1)\na′ is the number of labeled sentences. y∗ is an observed label sequence.\nThe objective function to maximize in GE is defined as the sum over all unlabeled examples (foreign side of bitext), over some cost function S between between the model expectation (Eθ[φ]) and the target expectation (φ̃) over φ.\nWe choose S to be the negative L22 squared error, 7\ndefined as:\nLGE(θ) = n′∑ b=1 S ( EP (y|xb;θ)[φ(yb)], φ̃(yb )\n= b′∑\nb=1\n−‖φ̃(yb)− Eθ[φ(yb)]‖22 (2)\nb′ is the total number of unlabeled bitext sentence pairs.\nWhen both labeled and bitext training data are available, the joint objective is the sum of Eqn. 1 and 2. Each is computed over the labeled training data and foreign half in the bitext, respectively.\n7In general, other loss functions such as KL-divergence can also be used for S. We found L22 to work well in practice.\nWe can optimize this joint objective by computing the gradients and use a gradient-based optimization method such as L-BFGS. Gradients of LCRF decomposes down to the gradients over each labeled training example (x,y∗), computed as:\n∂\n∂θ (logP (y∗a|xa;θ) = Ẽ[θ]− E[θ]\nwhere Ẽ[θ] and E[θ] are the empirical and expected feature counts, respectively.\nComputing the gradient of LGE decomposes down to the gradients of S(EP (y|xb;θ[φ]) for each unlabeled foreign sentence x and the constraints over this example φ . The gradients can be calculated as:\n∂\n∂θ S(Eθ[φ]) = −\n∂\n∂θ\n( φ̃− Eθ[φ] )T ( φ̃− Eθ[φ] ) = 2 ( φ̃− Eθ[φ] )T ( ∂ ∂θ Eθ[φ] )\nWe redefine the penalty vector u = 2 ( φ̃− Eθ[φ] ) to be u. ∂∂θEθ[φ] is a matrix where each column contains the gradients for a particular model feature θ with respect to all constraint functions φ. It can be computed as:\n∂\n∂θ Eθ[φ] = ∑ y φ(y) ∂ ∂θ P (y|x;θ)\n= ∑ y φ(y) ∂ ∂θ ( 1 Z(x;θ) exp(θT f(x,y)) )\n= ∑ y φ(y)\n( 1\nZ(x;θ)\n( ∂\n∂θ exp(θT f(x,y))\n)\n+ exp(θT f(x,y))\n( ∂\n∂θ\n1\nZ(x;θ)\n))\n= ∑ y φ(y) ( P (y|x;θ)f(x,y)T\n− P (y|x;θ) ∑ y′ P (y′|x;θ)f(x,y′)T )\n= ∑ y P (y|x;θ) ∑ y φ(y)f(x,y)T\n− (∑\ny\nP (y|x;θ)φ(y) )(∑\ny\nP (y|x;θ)f(x,y)T )\n= COVP (y|x;θ) (φ(y), f(x,y)) (3) = Eθ[φf T ]− Eθ[φ]Eθ[fT ] (4)\nEqn. 3 gives the intuition of how optimization works in GE. In each iteration of L-BFGS, the model parameters are updated according to their covariance with the constraint features, scaled by the difference between current expectation and target expectation. The term Eθ[φfT ] in Eqn. 4 can be computed using a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, but solving it directly requires us to store a matrix of the same dimension as fT in each step of the DP. We can reduce the complexity by using the following trick:\n∂\n∂θ S(Eθ[φ]) = u\nT\n( ∂\n∂θ Eθ[φ] ) =uT ( Eθ[φf T ]− Eθ[φ]Eθ[fT ] )\n=Eθ[u TφfT ]− Eθ[uTφ]Eθ[fT ] =Eθ[φ ′fT ]− Eθ[φ′]Eθ[fT ] (5)\nφ′ = uTφ\nNow in Eqn. 5, Eθ[φ′] becomes a scalar value; and to compute the termEθ[φ′fT ], we only need to store a vector in each step of the following DP algorithm (Druck, 2011, 93):\nEθ[φ ′fT ] = n∑ i=1 ∑ yi ∑ yi+1 {[ n∑ j=1 ∑ yj P (yi, yi+1, yj |x)\n· φ(yj) ] · f(yi, yi+1,x)T }\nThe bracketed term can be broken down to two parts:\nn∑ j=1 ∑ yj P (yi, yi+1, yj |x)φ(yj)\n= i∑\nj=1 ∑ yj P (yi, yi+1, yj |x)φ(yj)\n+ n∑\nj=i+1 ∑ yj P (yi, yi+1, yj |x)φ(yj)\n= α(yi, yi+1, i) + β(yi, yi+1, i)\nα(y0, y1, 0) ≡ P (y0, y1|x)φ(y0) α(yi, yi+1, i) ≡ P (yi, yi+1|x)φ(yi)+\nP (yi+1|yi,x) ∑ yi−1 α(yi−1, yi, i− 1)\nβ(yn−1, yn, n− 1) ≡ P (yn−1, yn|x)φ(yn) β(yi, yi+1, i) ≡ P (yi, yi+1|x)φ(yi+1)+\nP (yi|yi+1,x) ∑ yi+2 β(yi+1, yi+2, i+ 1)\nThe resulting algorithm has complexity O(nm2), which is the same as the standard forward-backward inference algorithm for CRF."

      "text" : "Projecting expectations instead of one-best label assignments from English to foreign language can be thought of as a soft version of the method described in (Das and Petrov, 2011) and (Ganchev et al., 2009). Soft projection has its advantage: when the English model is not certain about its predictions, we do not have to commit to the current best prediction. The foreign model has more freedom to form its own belief since any marginal distribution it produces would deviates from a flat distribution by just about the same amount. In general, preserving uncertainties till later is a strategy that has benefited many NLP tasks (Finkel et al., 2006). Hard projection can also be treated as a special case in our framework. We can simply recalibrate posterior marginal of English by assigning probability mass 1 to the most likely outcome, and zero everything else out, effectively taking the argmax of\nthe marginal at each word position. We refer to\nthis version of expectation as the “hard” expectation. In the hard projection setting, GE training resembles a “project-then-train” style semi-supervised CRF training scheme (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Täckström et al., 2013). In such a training scheme, we project the one-best predictions of English CRF to the foreign side through word alignments, then include the newly “tagged” foreign data as additional training data to a standard CRF in the foreign language. The difference between GE training and this scheme is that they optimize different objectives: CRF optimizes maximum conditional likelihood of the observed label sequence, whereas GE minimizes squared error between model’s expectation and “hard” expectation based on the observed label sequence. We compare the hard and soft variants of GE with the project-then-train style CRF training in our experiments and report results in Section 4.2."

Odd-numbered documents are used as development set, and even-numbered documents are held out as blind test set. The rest of OntoNotes annotated with NER tags are used to train the English and Chinese CRF base taggers. There are about 16k and 39k labeled sentences for Chinese and English training, respectively. The English CRF tagger trained on this training corpus gives F1 score of 81.68% on the OntoNotes test set. Four entities types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION and GPE) are used with a BO tagging scheme.

Quite remarkably, on Chinese test set, our proposed method (CLiPPER) achieves a F1 score of 64.4% with 80k bitext, when no labeled training data is used. In contrast, the supervised CRF baseline would require as much as 12k labeled sentences to attain the same accuracy. Results on the German test set is less striking. With no labeled data and 40k of bitext, CLiPPER performs at F1 of 60.0%, the equivalent of using 1.5k labeled examples in the supervised setting. When combined with 1k labeled examples, performance of CLiPPER reaches 69%, a gain of over 5% absolute over supervised CRF. We also notice that supervised CRF model learns much faster in German than Chinese. This result is not too surprising, since it is well recognized that Chinese NER is more challenging than German or English due to the lack of orthographical features, such as word capitalization. Chinese NER relies more on lexicalized features, and therefore needs more labeled data to achieve good coverage. The results also suggest that CLiPPER seems to be very effective at transferring lexical knowledge from English to Chinese.\nThe bottom two figures in Figure 2 compares soft GE projection with hard GE projection and the “project-then-train” style CRF training scheme (cf.

With more unlabeled data, we notice a tradeoff between precision and recall on Chinese. The final F1 score on Chinese at 80k level is only marginally better than 10k.

All semi-supervised baselines are tested with the same number of unlabeled bitext as CLiPPER in each language. The “project-then-train” semi-supervised training scheme severely hurts performance on Chinese, but gives a small improvement on German. Moreover, on Chinese it learns to achieve high precision but at a significant loss in recall. On German its behavior is the opposite.

Without having previously observed this word as a person name in the labeled training data, the CRF model does not have enough evidence to believe that this is a PERSON, instead of LOCATION. But the aligned words in English (“Gao Gang”) are clearly part of a person name as they were preceded by a title (“Vice President”). The English model has high expectation that the aligned Chinese word of ”Gao Gang” is also a PERSON. Therefore, projecting the English expec-\ntations to Chinese provides a strong clue to help disambiguating this word. Figure 3b gives another example: the word “黄河”(Huang He, the Yellow River of China) can be confused with a person name since “黄”(Huang or Hwang) is also a common Chinese last name.17.

    "abstractText" : "We consider a multilingual weakly supervised learning scenario where knowledge from annotated corpora in a resource-rich language is transferred via bitext to guide the learning in other languages. Past approaches project labels across bitext and use them as features or gold labels for training. We propose a new method that projects model expectations rather than labels, which facilities transfer of model uncertainty across language boundaries. We encode expectations as constraints and train a discriminative CRF model using Generalized Expectation Criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2010). Evaluated on standard Chinese-English and German-English NER datasets, our method demonstrates F1 scores of 64% and 60% when no labeled data is used. Attaining the same accuracy with supervised CRFs requires 12k and 1.5k labeled sentences. Furthermore, when combined with labeled examples, our method yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art supervised methods, achieving best reported numbers to date on Chinese OntoNotes and German CoNLL-03 datasets.",
