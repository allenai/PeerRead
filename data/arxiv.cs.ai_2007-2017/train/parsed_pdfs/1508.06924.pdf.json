      "text" : "As artificial intelligence tasks like fact-based question answering [Ferrucci et al., 2013] and face recognition [Taigman et al., 2014] become mostly solved, there is a need for harder tasks. Consider the following questions from the children’s magazine Highlights:\nWhy doesn’t every key open every lock?\nWhich is older, a tree or a leaf on the tree?\nWhy aren’t pants pockets as big as backpacks?\nFlags wave, people wave, and the ocean has waves. How are these waves alike?\nWhat part of a fish is farthest from the head?\nIs an ice-cream cone wider at the bottom or at the top?\nCould you sing a song in a dark room? Could you put together a puzzle?\nWhy can’t you move faster than your shadow?\nWhat might happen if you put a bee in your pocket?\nIf you could not remember today’s date, what are five ways you could find out?\nAlthough these questions are short and designed to be answered by young children, they are very hard for computers. It is unlikely that the reader has heard these questions before, and yet correct answers can be produced by most children within seconds, as well as explanations of the reasoning behind these answers. The embarrassing fact is that answering and learning from these questions is way beyond the capabilities of existing AI systems. They are wide open. We propose answering and learning from thoughtprovoking children’s questions (TPCQs), which are available in the BrainPlay1 column of Highlights, as a useful metric for driving research and evaluating general-purpose AI systems. TPCQs test a system’s ability to make novel connections, which is necessary for intelligence. While this method does require that the system have a powerful language facility, this is a crucial capability for a large class of useful AI systems. Without the system having the capacity to understand and generate language, it is extremely difficult for researchers to communicate abstract goals and tasks to the system, to draw its attention to salient topics, to receive answers to questions, and for the system to explain its behavior.\nTask Definition 1 (TPCQ) Given a thought-provoking children’s questionQ, produce\n• one or more answers to the question A1, A2, . . .\n• one or more learned generalizations L1, L2, . . .\nExample: Q: Name three animals that hatch from eggs. A1: birds A2: chickens A3: ducks A4: snakes L1: Animals with feathers hatch from eggs. Learning doesn’t only happen through real experiences and doesn’t always require the addition of new knowledge.A hallmark of human-level intelligence is the ability to combine existing knowledge through imagined situations, to answer questions which you have never before been asked. You may have pieces of knowledge whose connections are not apparent until someone pushes you to notice them. This is what BrainPlay questions are designed to do.\n1BrainPlay questions are published each month in Highlights, which is available from https://www.highlights.com/."

      "heading" : "Highlights BrainPlay",
      "text" : "Highlights magazine was started in 1946 by Garry Cleveland Myers and Caroline Clark Myers. The magazine includes a BrainPlay column, which was called Headwork before November 2004. In this paper, we use the term BrainPlay for both Headwork and BrainPlay questions. The Highlights editors develop BrainPlay questions with great care. The questions are designed to “[stimulate] children from five to twelve to think and reason by working over in their heads what is already there, arriving at new ideas not learned from books” [Myers, 1968]. For example, consider the BrainPlay question “In a room with a staircase leading to the second floor, how can you figure out the height of the first-floor ceiling?” This question suggests a novel technique: to measure the height of a ceiling when there is a staircase leading up to the next floor, multiply the rise of the steps by the number of steps. BrainPlay first appeared in the second issue of Highlights in September 1946 [Wood, 1986]. Each month, BrainPlay presents around 20 questions arranged by age level [Myers and Myers, 1964]. Correct answers to the questions aren’t provided."

      "heading" : "Analysis of BrainPlay Questions",
      "text" : "To get an idea of what we’re up against, we performed an analysis of BrainPlay questions in the Highlights issues from January 2000 to December 2000. We started by segmenting each top-level question into one or more subquestions. For example, the top-level question\nWould you rather wear a hood or a hat? Why?\nis segmented into a first question and a second question. Table 1 shows the composition of subquestions. Table 2 gives statistics on the length of subquestions. The first question tends to be the longest. The second and following questions typically ask for explanations for the answer to the first question, ask variations on the first question (often involving coreference), or follow up in some other way. For the remainder of the analysis, we considered only first questions. We annotated each first question with exactly one question type, question class, answer cardinality, and answer class, and we annotated each first question with one or more types of knowledge needed and types of reasoning needed. We developed an initial set of annotation tags likeOpen-Ended and What-If and revised them as needed during the annotation process."

      "heading" : "Question Class",
      "text" : "Statistics on the question class are shown in Table 4.\nFacts Asks about facts (may require reasoning). Name three animals that hatch from eggs. How does a turtle protect itself?\nCaring Stimulates thought about caring and kindness. What could you do today to help someone else? If your family has company, what can you do to be a good host?\nWhat-If Asks about a hypothetical scenario. If you had a pet that could talk, what would the two of you talk about? If you could change your schedule at school, what would you change?\nComparative Involves a comparative. Is it easier to swallow a pill or a spoonful of medicine? Would it be easier to remember the date of a party or the date of a haircut appointment?\nPersonal Experience Asks about personal experiences. Have you ever been so busy that you forgot to eat a meal? What popular sayings did you first hear in a song or movie?\nPersonal Preference Asks about personal preferences. Describe your favorite place to go for a walk. If you could meet any person in the world, who would it be?\nTheory of Mind Evaluates theory of mind [Doherty, 2009]. Ryan looked at the sliced apple and said, “This must have been sliced a while ago.” How might he have known? When Otis arrived at the pool, he quickly figured out which person was the new swim coach. How might he have guessed?\nPurpose Asks about the purpose or function of something. What tools do you need for drawing? Name three uses for bells.\nDifference Asks for the differences between two things. How is taking a music lesson different from playing music on your own? What’s the difference between a riddle and a joke?\nReason Asks about the reason for something. Why do babies cry more often than adults? Why do we frame paintings and photos before hanging them up?\nMeaning Asks for the meaning of a word or phrase. What is meant by the saying “Money doesn’t grow on trees”? What does it mean to “go the extra mile”?\nAction Asks for an action to be performed like singing or drawing. Draw a heart in the air with your finger. Make a hand signal that means “good job.”\nPersonal Facts Asks about personal facts. Are you ticklish? How many teeth do you have?\nSimilarity Asks for the similarities between two things. How are socks and mittens alike? How is honey like maple syrup?\nSuperlative Involves a superlative. What is the best smell in spring? Where do you laugh the most: at school, at home, or with friends?\nDebugging Requires debugging of a problem or situation. When Erik looked at his plane tickets, it seemed as if his flight from Oregon to Rhode Island would take six hours longer than\nhis flight from Rhode Island to Oregon. Why was this? Jackson and his family were watching TV when suddenly they lost reception. What might have caused this?\nDescription Asks for a description. Describe some rocks you’ve seen. Describe how a wheel works.\nCount Asks for a count. How many pets do you know by name?\nSort Asks for items to be sorted by some attribute. List these in order of size: moon, bird, star, airplane.\nA number of questions involve personal experiences, preferences, and facts. The answers to these questions are persondependent. How shall we deal with these? The first reaction might be simply to throw them out. But consider that an intelligent, autonomous AI system will have its own personal experiences and preferences. These are essential aspects of a general-purpose AI system. Therefore it would be a mistake to throw these questions out. Because there is no gold standard answer key for them, answers can be judged for plausibility by human judges, as in the Turing test [Turing, 1950]. Some questions request an action to be performed. Again, we could throw these out, but then we would be throwing out some of the most revealing questions. Instead, the system can perform the actions in a three-dimensional simulator (or in the world if the system has a body), and the results can be judged by humans. Human judging is more time-consuming, but it is currently the best way of evaluating novel, previously unseen answers to novel, previously unseen questions. A question like “Have you ever been so busy that you forgot to eat a meal?” makes sense for an AI system, because the question probes essential knowledge of goals, plans, and mental states. General-purpose AI systems must be able to recognize, remember, and apply concepts like “being busy” and “forgetting to perform a task.”"

A rough correspondence between these sections and BrainPlay is shown in Table 10. (“VI Memory” includes prediction and imagination.) We see that BrainPlay questions span many aspects of intelligence. By design and intent, many of the thought-provoking children’s questions are designed to push the system into gener-\nating new knowledge, because many of the answers are openended and most often unlikely to have been seen before and stored explicitly. It is a hallmark of human-level intelligence that new knowledge can and often must be generated from existing knowledge when needed to accomplish a novel goal, and these questions are designed to exercise and expose those mechanisms."

      "heading" : "Related Work",
      "text" : "In Aristo [Clark, 2015], a multiple choice elementary school science exam question is taken as input, and an answer is produced as output. Whereas Aristo probes science knowledge studied in school, the BrainPlay/TPCQ task explores knowledge any child acquires simply through experience. Elementary science exam questions evaluate understanding of connections learned in school, while TPCQs encourage creation of new connections. In the bAbI tasks [Weston et al., 2015], a simple story and question about the story are taken as input, and an answer is produced as output. The stories are generated using a simulator based on a simple world containing characters and objects. The questions are very simple and restricted compared to TPCQs. The MCTest dataset [Richardson et al., 2013] consists of short stories, multiple choice questions about the stories, and correct answers to the questions. The questions were designed such that answering them (1) requires information from two or more story sentences and (2) does not require a knowledge base. MCTest questions evaluate the ability to read, understand, and combine information provided in a text. TPCQs require knowledge and experience not provided in the question. In the recognizing textual entailment (RTE) task [Dagan et al., 2013], a text T and a hypothesis H are taken as input, and a label T entails H , H contradicts T , or unknown is produced as output. RTE is quite general, and resources that recognize entailment could be used as resources for performing the TPCQ task. The Winograd schema (WS) challenge [Levesque et al., 2012] is a variant of the RTE task more heavily focused on reasoning. In the VQA task [Antol et al., 2015], an image and a multiple choice or open-ended question about the image are taken as input, and an answer is produced as output. The VQA task often involves significant reasoning, like the TPCQ task. At the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines, the Turing++ questions on images [Poggio and Meyers, 2016] will be used to evaluate not only a system’s responses to questions, but also how accurately the system matches human behavior and neural physiology. The system will be compared with fMRI and MEG recordings in humans and monkeys."

These questions are designed to stimulate thought and learning in children, and they can be used to do the same thing in AI systems, while demonstrating the system’s reasoning capabilities to the evaluator. We introduce the TPCQ task, which which takes a TPCQ question as input and produces as output (1) answers to the question and (2) learned generalizations. We discuss how BrainPlay questions stimulate learning. We analyze 244 BrainPlay questions, and we report statistics on question type, question class, answer cardinality, answer class, types of knowledge needed, and types of reasoning needed. We find that BrainPlay questions span many aspects of intelligence. Because the answers to BrainPlay questions and the generalizations learned from them are often highly open-ended, we suggest using human judges for evaluation.",
