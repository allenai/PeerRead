Questions such as “what if we model common cause Z” and “what if Y’s dependence on X reverses” inspire many candidate models to consider and compare, yet current tools emphasize constructing a final model all at once.\nTo more naturally reflect exploration when debating numerous models, we\npropose an interactive model construction framework grounded in composable operations. Primitive operations capture core steps refining data and model that, when verified, form an inductive basis to prove model validity. Derived, composite operations enable advanced model families, both generic and specialized, abstracted away from low-level details.\nWe prototype our envisioned framework in ModelWizard, a domain-specific\nlanguage embedded in F# to construct Tabular models. We enumerate language design and demonstrate its use through several applications, emphasizing how language may facilitate creation of complex models. To future engineers designing data science languages and tools, we offer ModelWizard’s design as a new model construction paradigm, speeding discovery of our universe’s structure.\nAuthor: Dylan Hutchison Advisor: David Naumann Date: 6 May 2015 Department: Computer Science Degree: Master of Science - Computer Science\niv"

      "text" : "We address three scientific goals:\n• Prediction of unseen states.1\nE.g., an apple dropped from a tall building will fall about 122 meters in 5 seconds.\n• Understanding of the structure that naturally generates states.\nE.g., the force of gravity decreases apple elevation quadratically with time. Equivalently, gravity linearly decreases a hidden variable, apple velocity, which in turn linearly decreases apple elevation with time.\n• Generalization of common structure to other problems and domains.\nE.g., quadratic regression generalizes to polynomial regression, a relationship we may apply to light dispersion, roller coasters and plenty other datasets.\n1State is a domain-specific term whose definition is clear in the context of a problem. A chemical engineer working on oil refinery design may use state to refer to the chemical composition of fluid in a reactor; a statistical physicist to refer to a specific configuration of a thermodynamic system; a computer architect to refer to the contents of each register on a CPU; a stockbroker to refer to the price of equities at a given time. More examples abound.\nIn the context of data science, we address these goals by analyzing datasets:\npredicting unseen data values, understanding the structure that generates data, and generalizing that structure to other datasets. We apply these principles to the apple freefall example by imagining a dataset of apple elevations over time in the form of Table 1.1. Each row consisting of a (time, elevation) pair is a data point. We aim to predict unseen rows with missing time or elevation, to understand the structure that generates these pairs, and to generalize that structure to other contexts.\nBy structure we refer to some mechanism that generates data points. As-\nsuming the standpoint of epistemic uncertainty,2 there exists a true mechanism that generates data points in reality that we do not fully know. We call the unknown true mechanism true structure, and we call a guess at the true structure a candidate structure, shortened to structure for brevity. We also refer to structure as a model. We use the language of probability to describe uncertain knowledge of true structure.\nTrue structure includes everything up to recording a data point. Including how\nwe collect data points in models can therefore be helpful, in addition to how “nature” generates data points. In the Apple Freefall data for example, if we know our method of recording elevation is particularly inaccurate or imprecise, we ought to reflect\n2in contrast to aleatory uncertainty, which holds that no true structure may ever be known due to intrinsic randomness. Distinguishing the two types of uncertainty may be useful for determining what uncertainty is reducible by further data collection [KD09], but for our purposes we consider true structure completely discoverable in the limit of infinite data.\n3 that knowledge in our model.3 We may also introduce noise to account for model imprecision: that a model may partly account for the true structure mechanism. The magnitude of noise reflects how well that model accounts.\nModels represent a (joint) probability distribution over data points. Impossible\ndata points that a model cannot generate have zero probability mass. Possible data points receive probability mass proportional to likelihood that the model will generate them. We create candidate models using the subset of possible data points present in a dataset’s non-missing values.\nWe are specifically interested in structure taking the form of machine learning\nmodels. These are models with a computable sampling procedure to output a data point. Sampling algorithms such as rejection sampling compute samples that satisfy conditions. Inference algorithms solve the reverse problem: computing the probability that the model will generate a data point.\nSome models are able to sample and infer data point probabilities for every\ncolumn in their dataset. We call those models generative, since they specify a distribution that can be used to generate samples over any column. We may also consider discriminative models that do not define distributions over every column.4 We cannot sample or infer data point probabilities of “unmodeled” columns in a discriminative model, instead using them as known inputs to sample or infer other columns. Data scientists may find discriminative models relieving because they do not have to specify distributions behind unmodeled columns, saving work required to justify why a certain distribution makes sense for a column.\nDefine model construction as the process of creating machine learning models\nfor a dataset. A well-built model solves all three goals: predicting unseen states\n3See how the Apple Freefall model noise term reflects data imprecision in Figure 1.1a and 1.1b. 4See [BBB+07] for an overview of generative and discriminative models.\n4 by (conditional) sampling, understanding structure by examining model components, and generalizing structure by applying components to machine learning models for other datasets. Prediction is a key link, because high predictive power on unseen data indicates that a machine learning model is close to the true structure generating data. Simplicity is another guide that increases understanding and generalizability; see [Fre14] for further reading on scoring machine learning models for comprehensibility.\nIn constructing our final model we may consider alternative models, comparing\nthem as we imagine them and choosing models that are simpler and fit our dataset better. We call this process model exploration.\nThe goal of the ModelWizard project is to develop a tool that supports the\nmodel exploration workflow. We aim to facilitate creativity, increase interactivity, introduce safety and support abstraction when writing a ModelWizard script that ultimately constructs a Tabular machine learning model."

      "text" : "We now introduce ModelWizard’s exploration workflow through a small example, focusing on how a user guides exploration through questions and fitness metrics. Subsections address issues to consider before basing judgements on ModelWizard’s output, and then on the underlying Bayesian methematics.\nAssume the perspective of a data scientist, unaware of gravity, presented with\nthe apple-in-freefall data of Table 1.1, collected on a windy day or by an imprecise instrument to add non-determinism. We may ask several questions: where is the apple at 4 or 5 seconds? What happens past 6 seconds when we observe the apple at elevation zero? At what time does the apple reach an elevation of 50m? We incorporate our questions into the dataset in Table 1.2.\nAn initial model we may posit for this dataset is a linear relationship between\ntime and apple elevation. To create this model, we use the ModelWizard operations\nLinReg \"Elevation\" \"Time\" (1.1)\nModel \"tmain\" \"Time\" (1.2)\nOperation 1.1 places a noisy linear regression model on elevation with explanatory variable time. Operation 1.2 places an uninformative Gaussian distribution on time.\nFigure 1.1a shows the resulting linear model. The rows in the bottom table\nlabelled ‘tmain’ list the name, type and model of corresponding columns in the original dataset of Table 1.2. The giant LinReg function block implements linear regression in Tabular syntax such that the Elevation column model may call linear regression as a macro. Detail-oriented readers may skip to Chapter 2 for deeper Tabular syntax and semantics, but for now we recommend accepting linear regression as is, focusing instead on ModelWizard’s workflow. The linear function block’s one addition to usual regression is the noise term, a probabilistic analogue to what statisticians call regression error. Larger inferred noise precision (equivalently, smaller inferred noise variance) tends to indicate less error and greater model fit, though we should take\n6 caution to avoid too high precision which is prone to overfit.\nOperation 1.2 converts the model from discriminative to generative. Because\nthe last row of our dataset in Table 1.2 contains a missing value for time, we must use a generative model in order to have a way to predict time. A generative model also allows us to answer questions such as “what is the apple elevation” without specifying time, equivalent to using the posterior distribution (see Section 1.2.2) on time to determine a distribution over elevation. Alternatively, if we omit the last row of Table 1.2 and only care about predicting elevation given time, then we could omit Operation 1.2, leaving time as an input and disallowing missing time values in our dataset. The advantage of the alternative discriminative model is not needing to specify and justify a distribution on time, which we questionably list as a Gaussian distribution. In summary, ModelWizard may construct both generative and discriminative versions of the linear model, and both have advantages in different situations.\nFigure 1.1c shows results of inference5 on the linear model. Inference consists of\ntraining a given model on observed (non-missing) values in the input dataset to form a posterior model, outputting posterior model parameters in the left of Figure 1.1c, and outputting marginal distributions from the posterior model on missing values, each conditioned on the observed values in the same row, in the right of Figure 1.1c. Greybackground “PointMass” distributions correspond to observed values in the original dataset of Table 1.2, whereas green-background cells are more meaningful posterior distributions for missing values in the dataset.\nIt seems suspicious that the linear model predicts positive elevation at 7 sec-\nonds, one second after the apple is known to reach 0m elevation. To better evaluate the linear model’s performance using a method less prone to overfitting, we use leave-one-out cross-validation on the known rows of Table 1.1 with the operation\n5We use the Expectation Propagation inference algorithm throughout the Apple Freefall example.\n8 CrossValidate kFold RMSE \"tmain\" \"Elevation\" 5 and similarly for Time. Resulting root mean square errors (not shown in Figure 1.1c) are 14.996m for elevation and 1.046s for time. Viewing these numbers alone, we do not know whether the linear model is optimal or whether other models could deliver lower error.\nCould a more complicated model like quadratic regression between time and\napple elevation add enough predictive power to merit its increase in model complexity? An answer to this question in either direction—whether quadratic regression is a viable or ill-suited model—is an important clue to understanding the dataset’s structure. Ruling out a model family like the family of quadratic models can be just as informative to a data scientist as showing a model’s plausibility.\nWe build the quadratic regression model shown in Figure 1.1b by replacing\nOperation 1.1 with\nQuadReg \"Elevation\" \"Time\"\nFigure 1.1d tables inference results.\nIt is heartening to see that the quadratic model predicts negative elevation at\n7 seconds and that it has higher noise precision. Running the same cross-validation operation returns root mean square errors of 13.546m for elevation and 0.759s for time, both lower than the linear model. Comparing cross-validation numbers, we see evidence that a quadratic relationship more likely governs the structure behind our dataset than a linear relationship.\nOf course, bringing in knowledge of gravity, the quadratic model parameters\nmake more sense than those of the linear model; the inferred parameter a = −8.625 is reasonably close to Earth’s −9.8m/s2 true force of gravity. The error is a result of the noisy data set, as the skeptical reader may verify by calculating elevation = 200− 9.8 2 t2 for observed times t in Table 1.1 and comparing them to the means of the quadratic\n9 model’s posterior distributions.\nModel evidence, the probability of observing the dataset under a model, does\nnot function as well as cross-validation for evaluating model fitness, as seen from the quadratic model evidence in Figure 1.1d being lower than the linear model evidence in Figure 1.1c. We demonstrate inference using model evidence in Section 3.1 and then switch to (5-fold, i.e. leave-n/5-out) cross-validation for other applications."

      "heading" : "1.2.1 Model Selection Matters: Overfitting and Consistency",
      "text" : "Overfit models perform well on training datasets but do not perform well on other datasets generated from the same true structure. Formally, we say a model overfits if it performs better on a training set of data but worse on the distribution of all possible data sets than an alternative model [Mit97]. The Apple Freefall models, for example, would clearly overfit if their noise precisions are excessively high. They would predict tight distributions accurately on their training set that do not predict well on non-training set data.6\nModel comparison methods can be another source of overfitting. We strive\nto compare models in a way that does not favor specialized, overfit models. Luckily for the Apple Freefall example, model comparison by leave-one-out cross-validation is equivalent to model comparison by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [Sto77], which has a desirable model complexity penalty [Boz87] that penalizes models with larger degrees of freedom. The complexity penalty enables realistic comparison between the simpler linear model and the more adaptive and thereby more likely to overfit quadratic model.\nWe also strive to compare models consistently, that is, to compare models\n6We ignore the case of modeling a perfectly deterministic true structure, in which case a (zero variance) Dirac delta distribution may perfectly capture a deterministic relationship between columns.\n10\nwith a guarantee that the probability of choosing the “correct” model closer to the true structure converges to 1 as the number of data points approaches infinity. Unfortunately AIC is an inconsistent model comparison method [Sha93], which means that AIC may not choose the best model even after training on infinite data observations. We employ leave-one-out cross-validation anyway for convenience in the Apple Freefall example. Consistent model comparison methods include leave-nv-out cross-validation, Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Bayes factors for models with a finite number of parameters, and consistent methods exist for comparing nonparametric models too [JWC+10]."

      "text" : "We obtain cross-validation scores used to compare models via inference, characterized by its use of Bayes’ Rule. Beginning with a prior predictive model7 that specifies Pr(row) for any row of data, we use Bayes’ Rule to iteratively condition on each observed row of a dataset and form a posterior predictive distribution:\nPr(row | obsRow)︸ ︷︷ ︸ posterior pred. model := αPr(obsRow | row)︸ ︷︷ ︸ obsRow likelihood Pr(row)︸ ︷︷ ︸ prior pred. model\nwhere obsRow is a row of observed (non-missing) data points and row is a row of data for which we wish to calculate its probability via a model that incorporates the data evidence in obsRow. For example, obsRow may be (time = 1, elevation = 196) and row may be (time = 2, elevation = 0). We hope our model assigns Pr(row | obsRow) infinitesimal probability.\nα is a normalizing constant that ensures the posterior predictive model is a\n7Vocabulary note: a (prior or posterior) predictive model specifies a distribution over a row of data, whereas a (prior or posterior) model specifies a distribution over model parameters. We refer to the latter as parameter models to disambiguate. See [GvD07] for examples of each.\n11\nvalid probability distribution, i.e., that ∫ Pr(row) drow = 1, integrating over all possible rows:\nα = 1\nPr(obsRow) = 1∑ row Pr(obsRow, row) = 1∑ row Pr(obsRow | row) Pr(row)\nThe reasoning is that if Pr(obsRow | row) > Pr(obsRow), then row increases obsRow’s likelihood, which indicates we should raise Pr(row | obsRow) since obsRow is in fact observed. The ‘<’ version similarly decreases Pr(row | obsRow).\nIn the context of the apple freefall example, we tune our model from prior\nto posterior by adjusting the value of regression coefficients—free parameters in the model for which we specify (usually uninformative) prior distributions:\nPr(param | obsRow)︸ ︷︷ ︸ posterior param dist. := αPr(obsRow | param)︸ ︷︷ ︸ param likelihood Pr(param)︸ ︷︷ ︸ prior param dist.\nWe use parameters in our model to determine a distribution over possible rows of data by Pr(row) = Pr(row | param) Pr(param).\nThe inference algorithms we use in Tabular and ModelWizard are forms of\nvariational inference,8 a process that fits an easier-to-analyze probability distribution as close as possible to an arbitrary probability distribution like the one our apple freefall model represents. In exchange for approximation error in using the easierto-analyze distribution in place of the original distribution, we gain computational speedup in estimating the posterior distribution. Other forms of inference are exact inference,9 explicitly calculating an exact posterior distribution, and sampling-based inference,10 sampling from a posterior distribution without explicitly calculating it.\n8e.g., variational message passing, expectation propagation, ... 9e.g., variable elimination, junction tree, conjugate distributions, ...\n10e.g., rejection sampling, likelihood weighting, MCMC and its variants, ...\n12\nCross-validation calls inference as a subroutine by using the resulting probabil-\nity distribution from inference to make predictions on held out data. Well-performing models recover held out data accurately as indicated by low cross-validation error. Cross-validation performs inference in several rounds, holding out different sets of data randomly at each round. Thus, a model with high cross-validation score generally maintains performance when trained on different subsets of data, which is an excellent guard against overfitting as discussed in Section 1.2.\nIt is useful to imagine comparing models by cross-validation (or other model\nscoring measures such as model evidence) as an extension of Bayes’ Rule where we select the best fitting model at the same time as the best fitting parameters for each model:\nPr(model, param | obsRow)︸ ︷︷ ︸ posterior model and param dist. := αPr(obsRow | param)︸ ︷︷ ︸ param likelihood Pr(param | model)︸ ︷︷ ︸ prior param dist. Pr(model)︸ ︷︷ ︸ prior model dist.\nWe select model and its parameters with highest probability. Using the cross-validation method, this is the model (with parameters set by usual inference) that scores the least prediction error. Using the model evidence method, this is the model with greatest likelihood. Methods such as BIC, Bayes’ factors and others discussed in Section 1.2 follow the Bayes’ rule pattern similarly. The extension of the distribution over possible rows of data is Pr(row) = Pr(row | param) Pr(param | model) Pr(model), though after selection Pr(model) is a point mass distribution on the selected model.\nAn alternative to model selection is model mixing: taking a sum over possible\nmodels weighted by likelihood, instead of selecting one “mode” model with highest likelihood. Model mixing has more robustness to change in data when two models both explain the data well, since a small shift in data could change a selected model abruptly while a small shift in data will smoothly change a mixture of models\n13\n[HMRV99]. We use the model selection approach because understanding is one of our goals. It is easier to interpret a single model than a mixture of models, especially when we use our model as a proxy for true structure in nature.\nThere is a potential vocabulary conflict with statisticians, who define inference\nas “the process of deducing properties of an underlying distribution by analysis of data” [UC08]. Recalling that true structure is a probability distribution over possible data, there is no conflict; true structure is the underlying distribution, whose properties we capture in models we create through model construction. “Structure learning” is also equivalent, as seen from the similar breakdown of a model into “structure” and “form” in [KT08].\nIn this thesis, “model construction” refers to the entire process of finding a\nmodel close to true structure, “inference” refers to Bayesian inference procedures to answer queries and calculate posterior distributions by conditioning on data using Bayes’ rule, and “model exploration” refers to determining model family/form, using the term “learning” whenever a choice is guided by dataset predictive power."

In this manner, model construction naturally fits into the scientific method. To illustrate the benefits of interactivity, imagine two other extremes of model construction: manual and automated.\nScientists adopting a manual model construction strategy take years to study\na scenario well enough to become expert and build a good model. The approach works but at high labor cost, whose fruits tend to be one-off, special purpose models applicable to a single problem.\n14\nScientists adopting an automated exploration strategy, using algorithms that\noutput good families, face tractability problems trying to search through the space of all models.

Further, many automated algorithms such as multilayer neural network training generate “black box” models, which predict accurately but offer no insight into why the models work.\nInteractivity delivers a happy medium between the two extremes. Data scien-\ntists will work hand-in-hand with computers to navigate the space of models, leveraging scientists’ creative insight to guide model search and computers’ automation to present statistics, model performance results and model suggestions as feedback.

The beauty of derived operations is that we may abstract them, treating them as a reusable single piece by forgetting the bricks and glue that compose them. We construct the mightiest models, machine learning castles indeed, composing all available operations in the blueprint of F#.\nWe find ModelWizard’s primitive operations naturally capture common ma-\nchine learning paradigms that when composed into derived models, offer easy access to many model families, such as clustering and Naive Bayes. Creating models as compositions lends understanding into how the models work, since we can “open the box” of a derived operation and inspect its component operations and code to see how it works. At the same time, abstraction allows analysts to consider derived models without worrying about their low-level details by using the models as “closed black boxes.”\nFor example, operations 1.1 and 1.2 that construct the Apple Freefall model\nare derived operations, abstracting details of regression and automating choice of model by deducing that time is a real-valued variable.

A table\nhas a name, an ordered array of column names and a two-dimensional data array,1 of\n1The System.IComparable[,] type on Data indicates Data values have a total order. Do not think deeply into the total ordering; it is a pragmatic requirement that makes working with F# libraries easier.\nThe total order may be unrelated to the actual meaning of data values. For example, string values are compared lexicographically such that ‘blue’ “is less than” ‘red.’ For modeling purposes we may still treat color as a nominal column, that is, one whose data values have no semantic total order\n20\nwhich the first dimension indicates row number and the second dimension indicates column. Missing values have value null.\nSchema is analogous to the Tabular Schema type [GGR+14]. Its first component\nis a representation of a classical relational database schema, composed of a list of named tables, each of which has a list of named and typed columns. Its second component is annotations on columns with probabilistic model expressions that define distributions over the data entries corresponding to the schema columns. The Tabular compiler compiles Schemas into code in a probabilistic programming language, with which we run inference using the language’s inference engine. Thus, by manipulating Schema in ModelWizard, we manipulate the machine learning model that we use in inference.\nStateOp<’R> is an operation on State, returning a new State plus additional\ninformation of type ’R. ’R could include information about the new state such as outlier data points or oddly fitting model components, information on other States worth considering, or anything else the user writes in the StateOp function.

      "heading" : "2.1.1 Defining “Valid” States",
      "text" : "The State type by itself offers no guarantee that a State is valid. Before we may provide any notion of validity, let alone the safe construction of valid states, we must define what we mean by “valid” and “safe.”\nWe call a State valid when its component Schema is valid on its own and when\nthe component Schema conforms to the State’s component Data in the categories listed below. Safety refers to a process of constructing a state that preserves state validity, or informally, that “valid states in yield valid states out; garbage states in and can be semantically compared only for equality.\n21\nyield garbage.”\nThe following categories outline the main kinds of Schema validity and Schema-\nData conformance that we check in the ModelWizard implementation:\n1. Naming conflicts. Table names must be unique, column names must be unique\nwithin each table, and table and column names present in a Schema must correspond to tables and columns in the Data it is paired with. ModelWizard always checks for naming conflicts, especially when parsing arguments that create an operation and executing operations that create new columns or tables.\n2. Type checking. Modeled columns in a Schema (that is, columns with Tabular\nmodel expressions) must have a type that can be generated by the model on that column. It would not make sense, for example, that a column with a real type have a Discrete model expression. Data values must in turn match column types in the Schema they are paired with. ModelWizard performs type checking at runtime when there is a chance that data may not match a new type, explained further in Section 2.4.\n3. Primary and foreign key correctness. ModelWizard guarantees columns with the\nannotation ‘pk’ are unmodeled and have no duplicate values, such that each value in a primary key column is unique. Further, (foreign key) columns whose domain is that of another (primary key) column may only assume values that are a subset of those in the primary key domain. Section 2.4 and 3.3.1 introduce the primitive operations CreateTableUniques, Link and Exact that carefully check these requirements.\n4. Cyclic dependencies. Tabular requires that columns and tables only refer to pre-\nviously declared columns and tables. We enforce this requirement in Section 2.5.3\n22\nvia Schema-reordering operations.\nChecking state validity at runtime ensures that states are actually valid, at\nthe sacrifice of scalability to big data or big models. While unimplemented, we lower barriers to scalability by running checks only when necessary, running checks lazily in background threads or using other techniques discussed in Section 4.1.\nThe following notions of state validity are outside the scope of ModelWizard:\n1. Detecting data valid according to type and syntax but questionable ac-\ncording to data likelihood. For example, an int-type column with values {1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 9001, 2, 3, 1} is valid syntactically and type-wise, but the value 9001 is a huge outlier worth questioning. However, it would be straightforward to write an operation that returns unlikely Data values.\n2. Suggesting corrections to data values with syntax or type errors. For example,\nsuppose we have the data value ‘15B’. If present in a column containing with many other integers, we could propose that the ‘B’ is a typo, accidentally inserted. We may also interpret the value as hexadecimal and propose replacing ‘15B’ with the decimal ‘347’. With supporting evidence from other columns, a third plausible alternative is that ‘15B’ is the concatenation of two columns, such as an airline seat reservation with row number 15 and seat position B for “aisle.”\nWe refrain from heroically suggesting remedies for invalid states. More extensive data cleaning is the subject of active research, as seen in the DataTamer [SBI+13] and Potter’s Wheel [RH01] systems among others. We would welcome integrating data cleaning techniques with ModelWizard in order to create a better end-to-end data analytics and model construction platform.\n3. Detecting models valid according to type and syntax but questionable according\n23\nto data likelihood. For example, nothing in our system prevents a user from placing a Gaussian distribution with mean 10,000 and variance 1 on a column with values {1, 5, 2, 2}. However, we do provide features that make model scoring and comparison easier, such as running inference, computing data likelihood scores and running cross-validation. We welcome contributions that perform model scoring in the background, alerting the user if he performs an operation that leads to a very unlikely model.\n4. Guaranteeing models are inferable by a particular back-end inference engine. See\nSection 4.2 for a discussion on model inferability.\nDefining and enforcing validity as outlined above allows us to make the guaran-\ntee that every model constructed by ModelWizard has a valid Tabular counterpart and will pass Tabular’s type checking, a strong enough guarantee to be useful in practice but not so strong as to result in intractable model checking."

CGaussian has in fact, another hyperparameter MeanMean that is the table-level µ in Figure 2.1 which comes into play when MeanPrec is sufficiently large.\nWe create these distributions on a column, independent of all other columns,\nin ModelWizard by the primitive operations ModelDiscrete and ModelGaussian. ModelDiscrete may be performed on any column of type upto(N) or link(T). Link(T) columns are essentially upto columns with N set to the number of rows in table T. ModelGaussian may be performed on columns of type real or int, converting the column to type real in the int case. We enforce type constraints by throwing an exception if one operates on a mismatching type.\nTo make it easier to independently model a column, we use the derived oper-\nation Model to place a “default” distribution appropriate for the column’s type by means of a call to ModelDiscrete or ModelGaussian. Columns of type string, the raw text type, are handled by a TypeNominal operation described in the next section.\nFuture work may extend the “two-level” Gaussian and Discrete conjugate dis-\ntributions to higher levels of hierarchical models. This can be done partially for the\n28\nprior on the mean of a Gaussian distribution, since the prior is itself another Gaussian distribution. A Gaussian distribution’s precision (alternatively, variance) is more tricky. As for the Dirichlet distribution, the prior of a Discrete distribution, placing a prior on a Dirichlet requires the nonparametric Dirichlet process [Teh10], which is historically hard to perform variational inference on because the number of variational parameters is nonconstant. Recent work has had more success [BJ04].\nWe also leave integrating other base distributions into ModelWizard as future\nwork. Good candidates are Gamma, Wishart, Poisson and Binomial, as these distributions all have existing representations in Tabular. Multivariate Gaussian is a particularly excellent candidate as it creates a new way to couple continuous columns alongside polynomial regression. We do not include the Beta and Bernoulli distributions as they are special cases of the Dirichlet and Discrete distributions, respectively. It may also be worth investigating other prior distributions; for example, Gelman argues that a Gaussian distribution truncated to only place probability mass on positive values tends to perform better as a prior on the variance of a Gaussian than the inverse-Gamma we use in CGaussian [Gel06].\nA challenge to additional base distributions is their level of inference support\nin Infer.Net. Using other back-end inference engines such as Stan [Sta14] or R2 [NHRS14] may add diversity to other base distributions’ level of inference support."

These operations are checked such that they will not place an improper type on a column, and they are only allowed to act on unmodeled input columns. For example, TypeReal will check the data to ensure that the target column’s data really are real-valued when there is a chance the data may not be, say when converting from type string as opposed to type int. TypeUpto and TypeLink act similarly. TypeInt is also implemented but not discussed here or in the API as no machine learning models use the int type, taking upto or real in its place.\nString types have special handling. One could use the former three type oper-\nations to convert a string column that contains numeric data, but it is more common that a string column has nominal data, that is, data whose values are only comparable by equality like {red, blue, red, green}.\nWe handle a nominal column C in table T with the primitive operation\nCreateTableUniques T [C]. It creates a new Tabular table (call it NT) whose rows contain the unique values of column C. Thus, NT’s rows form the domain of C. We bind the domain of C in T to NT by the operation Link NT [C,C] T C, which changes column C to type link. Read the Link operation as “map column C in foreign table T to column C in primary table NT and store the corresponding row matches in foreign table T’s column C.”\nComposing CreateTableUniques with Link forms the derived operation\nTypeNominal, an operation that effectively types a string column as a nominal column. It is also possible to run TypeNominal on int and real columns, effectively treating the numbers in those columns as nominal labels instead of numeric values. Running TypeNominal on an upto column is redundant and disallowed.\nA promising future direction is handling ordinal columns. Ordinal data have\nranking in addition to equality comparison, like the data {first, second, third}. One way to represent ordinal data is by logistic regression, supposing that ordinal values\n30\nare delineated by continuous thresholds and then more easily inferring a continuous number and seeing which “bucket” between thresholds the continuous number lies in. “Indicator” columns perform the logistic regression in Tabular to indicate when a column is “greater than” its threshold value.

The user specifies the domain and the range of the regression as input to the operations. Polynomial regression is a generic, “default” way to couple continuous columns without special knowledge of the structure of a dataset.\nWe add noise to polynomial regression in order to place a non-point-mass\ndistribution over the range column when the domain column is deterministic (e.g., when the domain column is unmodeled with markup input). The noise has fixed mean 0 so that we may infer the constant term properly (‘b’ in linear regression, ‘c’ in quadratic), or else the noise and constant term would conflict in explaining regression bias. Inferred noise variance corresponds to regression error magnitude.\nLinReg and QuadReg rely on the function tables in Figure 1.1a and Figure 1.1b\ndefined above the main tables to implement regression in an abstracted manner. Function tables use a special syntax in Tabular to implement a generic function that involves table-level inputs with default parameters (“hyper” columns), additional table-level columns determined by the inputs (“param” columns), concrete row-level inputs from a table (“input” columns), additional row-level columns that depend on the inputs (“latent” columns), and a row-level “output” column that returns a function’s result to the table that calls it. “Table-level” refers to columns that have\n32\nthe same value for every row in a table, whereas “row-level” refers to columns whose value may differ for each row of data. Tabular’s compiler inserts function tables inline into the non-function tables that call them, a process similar to macro expansion. The insertion should occur in a way that does not conflict with names in the calling table.\nUnfortunately, Tabular syntax forbids function tables that reference other func-\ntion tables, recursively or not. If we had the ability to conduct recursive calls, then we could implement polynomial regression in a recursive, more concise manner. Imagine the operation PolyReg N rngcol domcol to do N-ary polynomial regression between domain column domcol and range column rngcol. We may implement PolyReg N by adding an Nth degree term in the function and then recursively calling PolyReg (N-1) for the rest of the regression, down to PolyReg 0 base case. Even without the recursive implementation, it is possible to implement PolyReg N without individually using the operations LinReg, QuadReg, and so on by using a symbolic algebra algorithm to create an Nth degree regression as a function table in F# code, though we have not presently implemented this in ModelWizard.\nThe regression operations place a distribution over the range column deter-\nmined by the domain column, effectively meaning that the domain column value determines the range column. If the domain column is modeled (i.e., has a probability distribution as opposed to an input column), then the regression on the range column distribution is a function of the domain column distribution."

The copy distributions are identical to the original range column distribution, except that the copies have their own parameters.\nThe indexed range column may have any model. We use the notation\nModel[DomCol] to indicate indexing the range column’s model by discrete domain column DomCol. Section 3.1 and 3.2 show models where a Discrete and Gaussian distribution, respectively, are indexed by a discrete variable. It is also possible to index a LinReg or QuadReg model by a discrete variable. Such an indexing would make sense in the context of Section 1.2’s apple freefall example if we had data for apples on different planets (each with their own force of gravity). We could index the regression on apple elevation by the planet the apple is on.\nFigure 2.2a graphically depicts one of the indexed distributions from Sec-\ntion 3.1’s Bayesian network in terms of gates [MW09] and plates [Bun94]. PVec is the probability vector governing sampled outcomes of rain on each row. Alpha is the\n34\nconcentration vector for the Dirichlet distribution used as the prior for the Discrete distribution. Alpha is a vector of 1s when left unspecified. N=2 sets the dimension of the vectors at 2, which is equal to the number of states of rain (a boolean-valued column, typed as upto(2)).\nThe dashed box is a plate, which means that its contents are replicated; there is\na distinct PVec for every value of cloudy (also of type upto(2), though the dimension of the domain column need not equal the dimension of the range column in general). Inputs to the plate (Alpha) are sent to each replicated PVec. The square inside a box is a gate, which determines the output of the plate (rain) by the indexing variable cloudy. Figure 2.2b shows the “unfolded” version of the gate and plate.\nA helpful way to think about the notation is that there are distinct PVec\nparameters for the Discrete distribution governing rain. The distribution of cloudy determines the weights with which we use each parameter. Thus, we say that cloudy determines the distribution over rain.\nIn terms of operations, Index is a simple primitive operation. Index verifies\nthat the domain column is discrete and the range column is modeled, throwing an exception if either condition does not hold, and replaces the range column’s distribution by an indexed version. Syntactically, however, Index is more complicated due to the occasional need to index distributions across table links. The user may specify a list of table links to traverse. See Figure 3.9 in the Applications chapter for an example where movie ratings are indexed across a table link to a cluster column in a user table and a title table.\nIndex and LinReg/QuadReg offer venues for a discrete column to determine\na discrete column, for a discrete column to determine a continuous column, and for a continuous column to determine a continuous column. We do not have a way for a continuous column to determine a discrete column. As mentioned in Section 2.4\n35\nabove, we may create a way in the future by implementing a logistic regression operation. With that future addition, we would have “default” ways to couple columns of any type, a valuable ability for users experimenting with dependencies in a dataset."

In other words, the overall model must fit into a directed acyclic graph.\nWe guard against cyclic dependencies by checking the set of columns that a\ncolumn depends on at operation-runtime.

      "text" : "In this section we demonstrate how one constructs an acyclic discrete Bayesian network in ModelWizard, and how to search over and select different models using inference to score them. Our model search example is small, selecting between two Bayesian networks that differ in one arrow. One may extend it to larger search spaces bearing in mind computational feasibility.\nSuppose we want to model Figure 3.1’s Bayesian network, modified from\n[Mur01] adding uncertainty in the arrow between wet grass and rain. Does wet grass determine rain’s distribution, rain determine wet grass’s distribution, or are wet grass and rain independent? We answer by building and comparing each candidate model, using data likelihood as selection criterion.\nWe begin with a default all-input model and dataset that performs no predic-\n39\ntion, shown in Figure 3.1a, and walk through the operations in Figure 3.1 to construct a predictive model. Figure 3.2 tables intermediate models.\nA natural first step is to model each column independently, in this case using\nModelDiscrete since all columns are nominal. ModelDiscrete allows inference of each nominal value’s probability (see Section 2.3 for details) and prediction of missing values, as with rain’s missing value in Figure 3.1a. Recall that Tabular inference consists of training a given model on observed (non-missing) values in the input dataset to form a posterior model, outputting posterior model parameters that in this case form conditional probability tables, and outputting marginal distributions from the posterior model on each missing value, conditioned on the observed values in the same row of that missing value.\nIndex correlates two columns. Taking Index \"tmain\" \"rain\" \"cloudy\" (read\n“Index the distribution of rain by cloudy”), for example, Index creates separate distributions on rain for each value of cloudy, effectively creating a conditional probability table where rain depends on cloudy. Rain’s Tabular model suffix ‘[cloudy]’ indicates the new dependence.\n40\nlet s0 = readValidState inputFile let le1 ,s1 =\ns0 |> runValidOp (OPM { do! ModelDiscrete \"tmain\" \"cloudy\" do!

Rain and wet-\nGrass are independent in model s1, rain indexes the distribution of wetGrass in model s2, and wetGrass indexes the distribution of rain in model s3. We use the ScoreLogEvidence procedure to compile the current Tabular model into Infer.NET inference code, execute inference and return model log evidence scores under 1000 rows of input data, storing scores in le1 through le3.\nAn unusual paradigm in the example is the reuse of State s1 in the construc-\ntion of s2 and s3. Many monads are “single-track” in the sense that they disallow storing and reusing internal state because it could lead to undesirable operations, such as saving a pointer to a file, then deleting the file, then attempting to access the file through the pointer. This kind of behavior is also disallowed in OpMonad since OpMonad expressions evaluate to a single ValidState. We had to jump outside the OpMonad construct into general F# let bindings in order to save state s1 and use it in the construction of two different states bound at the top level. We retain “single-track” enforcement in OpMonad for efficiency, since copying State in the current implementation entails copying Data within that State eagerly. Section 4.1 discusses delayed approaches to updating Data.\nWe find model s3 is most likely because le3 is greatest, fulfilling our intuition\nthat rain more likely causes wet grass (assuming conditions necessary for causal interpretation; see [KTHO05]). We also recover the same conditional probability tables (not shown) from Tabular inference as the Infer.NET program, proof that Tabular succeeded in learning the true model for this simple scenario. In fact, we generated the 1000 rows of input data from an Infer.NET probabilistic program with model s3 as ground truth and fixed conditional probability tables,1 and so model s3 is the true\n1Adapted from http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/infernet/ docs/discrete%20bayesian%20network.aspx\n42\nmodel.\nWe call our procedure interactive model search because the user specifies the\nsearch space through scripts like Figure 3.1. The user may initiate a larger search, perhaps over the space of all Bayesian networks as an automated search algorithm would, by searching over the presence and direction of every arrow. See [CG01b] for a survey of learning algorithms on several variants of Bayesian networks. In short, ModelWizard opens a design space in which the user insightfully scripts ad hoc searches through model subspaces, writing in automated selection or prioritization as needed to search spaces large enough to be useful without resorting to infeasible, exhaustive search.\nModel selection by data likelihood is prone to overfitting. In remaining exam-\nples we switch to the cross-validation inference scoring method: holding out a test set of data and measuring test set predictive accuracy according to a user-defined error function, such as the 0-1 loss function on predicting rain."

The derived operation in Code Listing 3.3 provides one such expression to facilitate its construction on future datasets. It offers abstraction in that we no longer need worry about its component operations or F# code and can treat it as a black box. Alternatively, we gain understanding into how Naive Bayes works by looking at its code. The derived operation simplifies Code Listing 3.2 to the one-liner do! NaiveBayes \"tmain\" \"gender\".\nWe anticipate users use derived operations in two ways. On a basic level, users\nmay record a list of operations on a dataset, initially taken ad-hoc, for replay on a similar dataset.

Predicting whether a plant is wild or propagate is a key step in identifying illegal plant sales. Perhaps more important than prediction, it is important to understand how strongly other columns impact Wild Propagate, including sale price, country of sale, plant conservation priority, and status on the CITES list of endangered plant species [CIT73].\nIn database literature [Dat90], a functional dependence (FD) between domain\ncolumns and a range column hold when domain column values uniquely determine range column value.

Table normalization is the process of decomposing a table into smaller tables to eliminate redundancies. Normalization to BCNF requires that the only FDs present in a table are either trivial FDs where the range is a subset of the domain, or FDs where the domain is a superkey (a superset of a candidate key: a set of columns that uniquely determine the FD’s range). We meet these requirements.\nOne could imagine extending the ExactInfer infrastructure to discover all the\nFDs within a table and not just the ones with a particular given domain, similar to automated table normalization work in [BNB08]. However, fully automated table normalization tends to discover spurious FDs, that is, FDs present in a dataset but not true in general. Nevertheless, it is possible to improve ExactInfer’s FD-discovery\n49\nalgorithms by following recent work in [HQRA+13] and older work in its references."

In fact, a user that knows about the FDs in a dataset will almost surely account for them before beginning the modeling process at the point where he architects dataset table layout. What if the user does not know about a dataset FD, perhaps when there are hundreds of columns? This is the ideal scenario for ModelWizard to help an analyst discover and take advantage of a dataset fact during the modeling process. We leave it to future studies to determine whether the additional flexibility from conducting pre-processing at the same time as modeling will help in practice.\nIt is worth considering how the model would work in the case that we do not\nuse a separate table T Genus Species to capture functional dependencies. In this case, we would have a single table, tmain, with On CITES and conserve priority indexed by Genus and Species. Indexing the range columns by Genus and Species in the main table instead of a separate table models a FD in a looser sense, because we no longer restrict the range columns to a unique value given domain column values.\nIn the limit of an infinite dataset, the single-table model is equivalent to multi-\ntable one because the CDiscrete distributions on On CITES and conserve priority collapse to point mass distributions for each unique (Genus, Species) pair. Fixing a (Genus, Species) pair, the collapse occurs after running Bayesian updating on infinite datapoints that are all the same. In the case of finite data, the single-table model incurs some predictive performance penalty. This penalty grows small quickly if prior distributions are not too strong and dataset size is at least moderately large.\nBoth the single-table and multi-table model perform better than not captur-\ning a FD at all, i.e., indexing On CITES and conserve priority by Wild Propagate.\n50\nThis is because using tightly dependent columns—the range and domain columns— too grossly violates the Naive Bayes assumption that features are independent given Wild Propagate.\nA prime future improvement to Figure 3.6’s model is capturing the ordinal\nnature of column conserve priority. A common way to do this is to create a table of real-valued thresholds for each value of conserve priority (H, H-M, M, ...) and model the chosen conserve priority as a real-valued variable discretized by those thresholds. An “ordinal column template” may make a nice addition to ModelWizard’s primitive operations, and it serves as another activity typically performed during preprocessing that aids users during modeling.\nWe imagine many other kinds of pre-processing activities from related work\nmay enhance interactive model construction. The Bellman system presents algorithms to discover possible foreign key dependencies, columns formed from a concatenation or format change from other columns, different ways two tables may be joined through intermediate tables, and more, by comparing summary structures computed for database tables [DJMS02]. BayesDB offers capabilities to do similar preprocessing steps in the presence of more general data error through concepts like “stochastic primary key and foreign key,” which can be taken as primary keys containing duplicates due to noise and foreign keys containing changed or non-matching values due to noise [Bax14]. Integrating probabilistic models of internal database structure in the style of BayesDB with models of column value distributions in the style of Tabular is an open avenue for future work.\n51"

We replace the Bernoulli distribution used by Singh and Graepel with equivalent Discrete2\n2Recall that we use Discrete as a synonym for a Categorical distribution.\n52\ndistributions of dimension two.\nEach table has a number of clusters. Tables with no foreign links (“leaf tables”)\nhave a fixed number of clusters, chosen by hand since the number of clusters is a crucial hyperparameter. Tables with foreign links (“body tables”) have a number of clusters equal to the product of linked tables’ numbers of clusters. Thus, a table with foreign links has clusters equivalent to the cross product of the clusters of tables it links to.\nEach row has a distribution over the clusters in its table. The distribution\nover clusters determines the parameters of each column’s base distribution. The resulting parameters are a weighted average over each cluster’s parameters, with weights determined by a Discrete distribution over clusters. Values for each column are drawn from their base distribution with these resulting parameters. For example, in a table with an age column that has 4 clusters, the age for a row in that table is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with parameters determined by that row’s distribution over the four clusters by taking a weighted average.\nEach cluster’s parameters are drawn from an uninformative prior distribution.\nThese priors are Gaussian (µ = 0, σ = 108) for the mean of a Gaussian, Gamma (k = 1,θ = 10) for the precision of a Gaussian, and Dirichlet α = 1 for the probability vector of a Discrete. We chose these hyperparameters to match those used by Singh and Graepel.\nPresented another way, Singh and Graepel generate a clustering model formed\ninductively on tables:3\n1. Table T base case: no foreign links: create a hidden cluster variable that determines\nparameters of the distribution behind each column of T . The distribution behind a column depends on its type.

Table T recursive case: T has foreign links: create a hidden cluster variable de-\ntermined by the cross product of clusters of rows in tables that T links to. A particular row’s distribution over clusters is determined by the distribution over clusters in each linked row in foreign tables.\nThis model uses soft clustering in that we allow a row to take a non-point-\nmass distribution over clusters. Calculations involving a row’s cluster take weighted averages over this distribution. This is also true of foreign links in the case of missing values for user and movie; we infer distributions over possible users and movies. This process is called link prediction. Its use case is when we have rows in our ratings table with a rating and movie, for example, and we wish to calculate which users are most likely to have given the movie that rating.

NoSQL and NewSQL databases [GHTC13] are\n62\nalso in scope, though each additional database supported will require a separate set of drivers that operations interface with to access data— unless recent projects such as SQL++ [OPV14], D4M [KCGJ15], or the larger BigDawg proposal [DEK+15] succeed in providing a common language interface to many types of databases.\nThe shift in thinking is to construct a function that will check and modify\ndata, throwing an exception for data that does not fit an operation rather than eagerly modify data. Viewing operations as database transactions additionally enables parallel execution of nonconflicting operations—that is, operations that do not modify the same part of Schema or Data as another operation that reads or modifies that part.\nSampling, lazy evaluation and background evaluation are further promising\ntechniques that would help ModelWizard handle larger datasets. Instead of running data-transforming operations on a dataset right away, we could run operations on samples from a dataset to see a preview of how the operation will affect the entire dataset. The same principle holds for inference operations; one can gauge how well a model performs by running on a sample. After obtaining preliminary results, ModelWizard can start a background process to run the operation on larger and larger samples, up to the full dataset, asynchronously returning progressively more accurate estimations of an operation’s effect. This allows us to retain interactivity using quick estimations on samples, without losing correctness and accuracy when the user does not mind waiting.\nModelWizard script reuse will help in the case of many datasets with similar\ncolumns. A user may create a ModelWizard script that operates on one dataset and share that script with colleagues that have similar datasets, who can then apply the script with little to no change. It is easy to imagine libraries of ModelWizard scripts developed and downloaded for data scientists within and across organizations.\n63\nThe first component of velocity, high rate of data acquisition, is outside Model-\nWizard’s scope. ModelWizard is designed to operate on fixed datasets with unknown structure rather than streaming data. A compromise is using ModelWizard to build a well-performing machine learning model for a fixed segment of streaming data on a development server, and then extract the machine learning model and implement it on a production server for streaming analysis. C# code for Tabular models built from ModelWizard is available through the Tabular GUI. Thus to reemphasize: ModelWizard is a tool for model exploration and construction, not for top-performance model deployment.\nThe second component of velocity, decreasing data value with time, is directly\nmodelable. We can include the time a data value is recorded as itself another column in the dataset. For example, take the problem of object tracking with dataset columns position and time. If our goal is to infer the object’s position at time t, position observations close to time t are valuable whereas position observations farther before or after time t yield decreasingly less information. We may account for time dependence in modeling by including time difference between observations in the variance of position difference between observations.\nVeracity, the phenomena of data uncertainty, is also directly modelable. In-\ncluding data accuracy and precision information as additional columns enables us to use those columns in probabilistic modeling. For example, we could imagine extending Section 1.2’s apple freefall example by including the imperfect mechanism by which we record apple elevations. Such an addition will not change the mean, most likely value of a predicted elevation (assuming the same mechanism records all data points), but it will return higher, more realistic variances. It also allows us to more strongly weigh sample rows that we have more confidence in, such as rows from using a higher precision measuring device.\n64\nModelWizard handles data variety fairly well, especially heterogeneous data\ntypes. ModelWizard’s machine learning models operate on nominal, string-valued data, numeric data, and in the future, ordinal data. Multiple data sources are no problem as ModelWizard represents each with a separate table, from which we may create cross-table links.\nHigh dimensional data is not a strong suit for ModelWizard. Imagine importing\nraw image processing data: a single megapixel image in truecolor (one row) will have a million columns, each with a 24-bit integer. Large numbers of columns are not ideal for manual analysis, though one could write ModelWizard operations to process them systematically. A better use case for interactive modeling with ModelWizard is after feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, when each column has an interpretable meaning to data analysts."

      "heading" : "4.2 Extending Model Safety to Model Inferability",
      "text" : "ModelWizard’s ValidState, ValidOp and OpMonad constructs guarantee a base level of model safety: every model constructed by ModelWizard has a valid Tabular counterpart and will pass Tabular’s type checking. Is it possible to extend model safety to guarantee that models constructed by ModelWizard are inferable, that is, can be run by the back-end inference engine to produce posterior distributions on parameters and missing values? Such a strong guarantee would enable data scientists to freely conjure models using the suite of operations available (respecting types so as not to throw exceptions), without worrying whether the model they construct will run.\nThe short answer is with great difficulty. Providing inferability guarantees is\ninherently specific to choice of inference engine. A formal proof requires modeling the syntax and semantics of a probabilistic program to prove that a certain subset\n65\nof programs are inferable by a particular inference engine, and then prove that ModelWizard operations will only generate programs (after Tabular compilation) within that inferable subset. All probabilistic programs are theoretically inferable, but different inference engine implementations will support some probabilistic program families more than others.\nAs a heuristic example derived from the author’s experience, Infer.NET’s ex-\npectation propagation algorithm performs more reliably for models with real-valued columns. Infer.NET’s variational message passing algorithm performs more reliably for models with discrete columns. Some models containing both real-valued and discrete columns are inferable by neither algorithm, a problem that surfaced during model exploration for Section 3.3’s Internet Plant Sales application. A chief cause of non-inferability is unimplemented message passing factors due to open research problems in variational inference."

      "text" : "Many researchers believe usability is a key factor in the extent of success for probabilistic programming tools [Gor13]. To truly make incremental model construction accessible to data scientists, we imagine a GUI or IDE wrapping ModelWizard’s state, sketched in Figure 4.1. Regular users will find model exploration easier using a GUI, and “power users” who want to create custom operations may do so via script editing.\nThe GUI would show the currently constructed State, with the ability to zoom\nin on Tabular Schema and a preview or sample of Data. At the right, we envision a list of operations performed so far. The GUI may tag operations with a model score based on given scoring criteria, such as cross-validation on a particular column of interest. Model log evidence is a useful default.\n66\nThe menu at the top of Figure 4.1 contains buttons that trigger operations,\ngrouped by category such as “Typing” and “Base Models.” Right clicking on columns in the Schema or Data preview will list operations relevant to that column’s type. At a more advanced stage, we imagine suggesting operations based on common modeling paradigms learned from users modeling similar datasets.\nA particularly powerful meta-feature is undo: the ability to roll back an op-\neration and quickly try another one. One can implement undo by extending the OpMonad computation expression to include State monad functionality by tracking past states (or diffs between states) within the monad. Even in the current ModelWizard implementation, users could save intermediate states via ordinary F# let bindings, as demonstrated by state s1 in Figure 3.1, after which performing undo is simply reusing saved state. Undo enables users can quickly try an operation, see whether it makes sense or is silly, and quickly proceed or rollback.\nThe idea for a ModelWizard GUI is inspired by Microsoft Power Query’s data\ntransformation script editor [Web14] and Proof General’s Coq theorem proving script editor [Asp00]. Both editors lower the barrier for new users, raise situational awareness, and increase productivity while writing scripts. We wish the same for Model-\n67\nWizard users tackling model exploration.\nIn addition to visualization and interactive editing, a growing theme in systems\ndesign is to integrate the “whole machine learning pipeline” from data mining and enrichment to data cleaning and modeling into a common framework, as outlined in [MBGM14] to support the activities of data enthusiasts that do not have formal training in data science. We view ModelWizard as a forward step in creating such an integrated analytics framework, paritcularly in the combination of preprocessing with modeling. Much future work (or combination with existing tools) is needed to incorporate data enrichment and cleaning."

      "heading" : "4.4 Interactive Theorem Proving Analogy",
      "text" : "Model construction bears many similarities to theorem proving. Both benefit from interactivity as a happy medium between two extremes.\nManually proving theorems on pencil and paper requires expert knowledge and\ntraining to navigate the space of all possible proofs and formalize one that proves the theorem. The approach works as with manual model construction but at high labor cost, sometimes taking years of study in the proof’s domain.\nAutomatically proving theorems requires powerful algorithms. For example,\nthe automated SMT solver Z3 [DMB08] succeeds for simple theorems but will fail for complex enough theorems due to the size of the space of all proofs. Automated model construction similarly fails in an unrestricted model space.\nWe aspire to use the design of interactive theorem provers as inspiration for\ninteractive model construction. Imagine operations as model construction tactics, lower ones like ModelDiscrete akin to Coq’s rewrite tactic [BC04] and higher ones like ExactInfer akin to Isabelle’s sledgehammer tactic [PB10]. Like tactics, operations\n68\nmay fail by throwing an exception and leaving state unchanged."

      "text" : "Probabilistic programs offer a universal space to create machine learning models for a dataset. ModelWizard presents a new take on constructing machine learning models, focusing on iterative construction one-to-one with model exploration, rather than traditional specification of a probabilistic program entirely at once.\nOur primary contribution is planting the seeds for an interactive framework,\napplicable to any language and inference engine, to view data transformation and machine learning models in terms of composable building blocks we call operations, glued together by program code (F# in our case). In doing so we simultaneously realize realms of pre-processing, manual analysis, automated analysis and modeling itself. We further realize these realms in naturally familiar program structure such as conditionals, iteration, and procedural abstraction, along with opportunity for classic programming language boons such as static analysis, syntactic safety and compilation optimization.\nWe proffer ModelWizard as a solution scheme to three scientific goals: predic-\ntion, retained from inference on constructed machine learning models; understanding, built from model decomposition into understandable operations; and generalization, found through application of operations to new problems and domains. We postulate future work building on our framework’s principles will naturally integrate with and augment data scientists’ modus operandi to discover our world’s true structure.\n69"
