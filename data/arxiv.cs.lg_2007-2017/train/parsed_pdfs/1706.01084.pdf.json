      "text" : "Personalized recommendation has gained a lot of a ention during the past few years [15, 25, 30]. Many models and algorithms have been proposed for personalized recommendation, among which, collaborative ltering techniques such as matrix factorization [14, 24] are shown to be most e ective. For these approaches, historical behavior data is critical for learning latent factors of both users and items. However, in many scenarios, behavior data is not available or very sparse, which motivates us to incorporate content/text information for recommendation. In this work, we study the problem of content-based recommendation for completely new items/texts, where historical user behavior data is not available for new items at the time of recommendation. However, when it comes to text ∗Work done while the rst author was an intern at Yahoo!

On one hand, traditional content-based [21] recommendation methods are usually based on simple text processing methods such as cosine similarity or logistic regression where both text and users are represented as bag-of-words. e limitations of such representation include the inability to encode similarity between words, as well as losing word order information [10, 19]. On the other hand, for collaborative ltering methods, although some of which has been extended to incorporate auxiliary information, text feature extraction functions are usually simple, and cannot leverage recent proposed representation learning techniques for text [5, 22, 27].\nWe address these issues with an approach that marries text embedding to personalized recommendation. In our proposed model, users and texts are simultaneously embedded into latent space where preferences can be depicted by simple dot product. While each user is directly associated with an embedding vector, text embedding requires an embedding function that maps a text sequence into a vector. Both user embedding and text embedding function can be trained end-to-end based on user-item interactions directly. With sophisticated neural networks (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) as text embedding function, high-level textual features can be be er captured.\nWhile end-to-end training of the embedding function delivers focused supervision for learning the task related representations. Interaction data is usually sparse, and there are still large amount of unlabeled data/corpora. Hence, we further propose a joint text embedding model to leverage unsupervised text embeddings that are pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled copora. To e ectively fuse both types of information, a novel combination module is constructed and incorporated into the uni ed framework. Experimental results on two real-world data sets demonstrate the e ectiveness of the proposed joint text embedding framework.\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n01 08\n4v 2\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 2\n3 Ju\nn 20"

      "text" : "Existing methods of personalized recommendation algorithms can be roughly categorized into there categories: (1) collaborative ltering methods, (2) content-based methods, and (3) hybrid methods.\nMatrix factorization (MF) techniques [14, 24] is one of the most e ective collaborative ltering (CF) methods. In MF, each user or item is associated with latent factor vectors u or v and the score between a pair of user and item is computed by their dot product, i.e. si j = uTi vj . Since each item j is associated with latent factors vj , an new item cannot be handled properly as the training of vj depends on its interaction with users.\nContent based methods [21] usually build model for user and content based on term weighting schemes like TF-IDF. And cosine similarity or logistic regression can be used to match between a pair of user and item. It is di cult to work with such representations to encode similarities between words, as well as word orders.\nHybrid methods can improve so-called “cold-start” issue by incorporating side information [5, 22, 27], or item content information [8, 30, 31]. However, most of these methods cannot deal with completely new items.\nere are some work aiming at leveraging neural networks for be er text recommendations, such as Collaborative Deep Learning [31], and others [1]. Compared to their work, 1) we treat the problem as a ranking problem instead of a rating prediction problem, thus pairwise loss functions are adopted; 2) our model provide a more general framework, enabling various text embedding functions, thus subsumes [1] as a special case; 3) our model incorporates unsupervised text embedding from large-scale unlabeled corpora."

Text embedding techniques aim at mapping text into vector representation that can be utilized for future predictive tasks. Such models have been proposed for addressing text classi cation/categorization problem [10, 12, 16]. Our task resembles a personalized text classi cation/ranking problem, in the sense that we try to classify/rank an article according to its interestingness w.r.t. a given user.

      "text" : "To simultaneously capture interests of users and semantics of texts, we embed both user and text into a common latent feature space, where dot product can be used to quantify their proximity.\nEach user i is directly associated with an embedding vector ui , which represents user’s interests. For a text sequence x j for the j-th item, it is mapped into a xed-sized vector by an embedding function f (x j ) ∈ Rk . e proximity score si j between the user and item pair (i, j) is computed by the dot product between their embeddings, as follows:\nsi j = u T i f (x j )\nText embedding function f (x). In our framework, the text embedding function is very exible. It can be speci ed by any di erentiable function that maps a text sequence into a x-sized embedding vector. Many neural network structures can be applied, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and etc. Here we introduce two such functions, MoV and CNN, while other extensions are straightforward.\nMean of Vectors (MoV). To represent a text sequence x of length T , we rst embed each word in the text with an embedding vector w [18, 19], and then use the average of word embeddings to form the text/article embedding as follows:\nh = 1 t T∑ i=1 wxi\nTo be er extract non-linear interactions among words, a denselyconnected layer with non-linear activation can be applied. A single layer of such transformation is given by:\nh′ = Relu(Wh + b)\nwhere Relu(·) = max(0, ·) is Recti ed Linear Unit. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Although MoW model is simple and relatively e cient, since text sequence is treated as a bag of words, orderings among words are ignored. As demonstrated in [10], ordering information of words can be helpful. To\nScore\n( : > ) ( : > ) …...\naddress the issue, Convolutional Neural Networks is adopted for text embedding.\nIn CNN, instead of averaging over all word embeddings, it maintains several lters of given size(s). Each lter will slide over the whole text sequence. Additionally, at each position, an activation is computed by a dot product between the lter and local embedding vectors. To be more speci c, we use D = wx1 ⊕wx2 ⊕ · · · ⊕wxT ∈ RT×k to denote the concatenation of word vectors for the text. To apply convolution on text sequence D, we compute the j-th entry from applying i-th lter according to:\ncij = Relu(W j · Di :i+s−1 + b j ).\nHereW j ∈ Rs×k is the j-th lter of size s , and b j is the bias term. e output c of convolution layer can be downsized by pooling operator, such as taking max over all temporal dimensions of c, so a xed sized vector h can be produced. Due to the page limit, we refer the reader to [12] for more clear detailed descriptions.\nObjective Function and Training. To learn the user embedding and text embedding function, the output scores for each pair of user and item are used to predict their interactions. For a given user, we want to rank his/her interested articles higher than those he/she is not. So for each user i , a pair of a positive item p and a negative item n are both sampled, and similar to [23], the score di erence between positive and negative items is maximized, leading to a pairwise ranking loss function as follows:\nL = E(i,p,n)∼D [ − logσ (sip − sin ) ] (1)\nwhere p is a positive item for user i , and n is a negative item for user i . Each triplet (i,p,n) is drawn from some prede ned data distribution D. And σ is sigmoid function. e objective can be optimized by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). In order to get triplets {(i,p,n)} for training, positive interactions {(i,p)} are rst sampled, and then negative items are sampled according to some prede ned distribution (e.g. item frequency).\ne framework is demonstrated in Figure 1. We name the above proposed framework TER, short for Text Embedding for contentbased Rcommendation."

      "text" : "ere are two challenges faced by the supervised text embedding framework proposed above: 1) user-item interaction data may be sparse, and 2) there are many texts with li le to none user interactions. ese issues can lead to over- ing. To alleviate sparsity in interaction data and leverage a large amount of text data with li le to none user interactions, we propose to incorporate unsupervised text embedding with a new combination function. e overall framework with joint text embedding is summarized in Figure 2a.\nDi erent from the supervised model, a pre-trained text embedding module is added, so each text is rst mapped into two embedding vectors: h1 from text embedding function f (x) and h2 from pre-trained embedding matrix M . en to generate a cohesive text embedding vector for the item, we propose a combination function д(h1,h2) to explicitly combine h1 and h2. Below we introduce these two additional components in detail.\nUnsupervised Text EmbeddingMatrixM . Unlike supervised text embedding, which requires user interactions for training mapping function f (x). e unsupervised text embedding can be pretrained with only text articles themselves, requiring no additional labels. To leverage a large-scale text corpus, we adopt Paragraph Vector [16] in our framework.\nGiven a set of text articles, Paragraph Vector associates each word i with a word embedding vector wi and each document d with a document embedding vector vd . To learn both types of embedding vectors simultaneously, a prediction task is formed: for each word occurrence, we rstly hide the word, and then model is asked to predict the exact word given neighboring word embeddings and the document embedding. e probability of the word is given as follows:\nP(token = i) = exp(vTdwi ) exp(∑j vTdw j ) As introduced in [16], the model is trained by maximum likelihood with negative sampling.\nA er training Paragraph Vector on the whole corpus, which includes text articles that have no related user interaction associated. We obtain a pre-trained text embedding module with embedding\nmatrix M , where each row Mi is an unsupervised text embedding vector for the i-th text article.\nCombination Functionд(h1,h2). To combine both text embedding vectors, i.e. h1 from text embedding function f (x), andh2 from pre-trained embedding matrix M , we introduce a combination function д(h1,h2) ∈ Rk where k is the user-de ned output dimension. Since the relation between two text embedding vectors h1 and h2 can be complicated and non-linear, in order to combine them e ectively, we specify the combination function д(·) with a small neural network: Firstly a concatenation of the two vectors are formed, i.e. h = [h1,h2], and then it is further transformed by a denselyconnected layer with non-linear activations, i.e. h′ = Relu(Wh +b).\nAlthough unsupervised text embeddings can provide useful text features [16], they might not be directly relevant to the task. So to control the degree of trust for unsupervised text embeddings, we introduce dropout [28] into unsupervised text vectors, i.e. h2, which randomly select entries and set them to zero. On one hand, when se ing the dropout to zero, the whole embedding vector is utilized; on the other hand, when se ing the dropout to one, the whole text vector is set to zero, hence it is equivalent to use none of pre-trained embeddings. When the dropout rate is between zero and one, it can be seen as a trade-o for the unsupervised module. Figure 2b illustrates the combination module.\nTraining of the Joint Model. e training procedure is separated into two stages. At the rst stage, a unsupervised text embedding matrix M is trained using unlabeled texts. At the second stage, similar to the supervised framework, the training objective is also pairwise ranking objective in Eq. 1. e parameters in the second stage involve both user embeddings and parameters in f (x) and д(h1,h2). Finally we name the extended model TER+."

From the result we clearly see the distinction between meanings of word learned from both methods. For example, the nearest word “neural” learned in unsupervised text embedding (articles with and without user like behavior) is mostly related to arti cial neural networks, but in supervised text embedding, it is mostly related to neuroscience, which is more close to biology. is is because that in the CiteULike data set, there exist a lot of biologists, so the word embedding learned from supervised text embedding is likely to be dominated by the neuroscience perspective. However, by incorporating the unsupervised text embedding learned from a larger corpus, more meanings of the words can be recovered.\nTable 5 shows the similar articles given a randomly selected queried article.

    "abstractText" : "Learning a good representation of text is key to many recommendation applications. Examples include news recommendation where texts to be recommended are constantly published everyday. However, most existing recommendation techniques, such as matrix factorization based methods, mainly rely on interaction histories to learn representations of items. While latent factors of items can be learned eectively from user interaction data, in many cases, such data is not available, especially for newly emerged items. In this work, we aim to address the problem of personalized recommendation for completely new items with text information available. We cast the problem as a personalized text ranking problem and propose a general framework that combines text embedding with personalized recommendation. Users and textual content are embedded into latent feature space. e text embedding function can be learned end-to-end by predicting user interactions with items. To alleviate sparsity in interaction data, and leverage large amount of text data with lile or no user interactions, we further propose a joint text embedding model that incorporates unsupervised text embedding with a combination module. Experimental results show that our model can signicantly improve the eectiveness of recommendation systems on real-world datasets.",
