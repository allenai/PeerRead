These models provide probabilistic interpretations of common combinatorial optimization tasks such as image segmentation. In this paper, we focus primarily on parameter estimation in the models from known upper-bounds on the intractable log-partition function. We show that the bound based on separable optimization on the base polytope of the submodular function is always inferior to a bound based on \"perturb-and-MAP\" ideas. Then, to learn parameters, given that our approximation of the log-partition function is an expectation (over our own randomization), we use a stochastic subgradient technique to maximize a lower-bound on the log-likelihood. This can also be extended to conditional maximum likelihood. We illustrate our new results in a set of experiments in binary image denoising, where we highlight the flexibility of a probabilistic model to learn with missing data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Aug 2016 13:55:41 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05258v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["tatiana shpakova", "francis r bach"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.05258"}
