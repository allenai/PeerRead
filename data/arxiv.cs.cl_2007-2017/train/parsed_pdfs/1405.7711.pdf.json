      "text" : "We present a novel framework for learning to interpret and generate language using only perceptual context as supervision. We demonstrate its capabilities by developing a system that learns to sportscast simulated robot soccer games in both English and Korean without any language-specific prior knowledge. Training employs only ambiguous supervision consisting of a stream of descriptive textual comments and a sequence of events extracted from the simulation trace. The system simultaneously establishes correspondences between individual comments and the events that they describe while building a translation model that supports both parsing and generation. We also present a novel algorithm for learning which events are worth describing. Human evaluations of the generated commentaries indicate they are of reasonable quality and in some cases even on par with those produced by humans for our limited domain."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Most current natural language processing (NLP) systems are built using statistical learning algorithms trained on large annotated corpora. However, annotating sentences with the requisite parse trees (Marcus, Santorini, & Marcinkiewicz, 1993), word senses (Ide & Jéronis, 1998) and semantic roles (Kingsbury, Palmer, & Marcus, 2002) is a difficult and expensive undertaking. By contrast, children acquire language through exposure to linguistic input in the context of a rich, relevant, perceptual environment. Also, by connecting words and phrases to objects and events in the world, the semantics of language is grounded in perceptual experience (Harnad, 1990). Ideally, a machine learning system would be able to acquire language in a similar manner without explicit human supervision. As a step in this direction, we present a system that can describe events in a simulated soccer game by learning only from sample language commentaries paired with traces of simulated activity without any language-specific prior knowledge. A screenshot of our system with generated commentary is shown in Figure 1.\nWhile there has been a fair amount of research on “grounded language learning” (Roy, 2002; Bailey, Feldman, Narayanan, & Lakoff, 1997; Barnard, Duygulu, Forsyth, de Freitas, Blei, & Jordan, 2003; Yu & Ballard, 2004; Gold & Scassellati, 2007), most of the focus has been on dealing with raw perceptual data rather than language issues. Many of these systems aimed to learn meanings of words and phrases rather than interpreting entire sentences. Somemore recent work has dealt with fairly complex language data (Liang, Jordan, & Klein, 2009; Branavan, Chen, Zettlemoyer, &\nc©2010 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nBarzilay, 2009) but do not address all three problems of alignment, semantic parsing, and natural language generation. In contrast, our work investigates how to build a complete language learning system using parallel data from the perceptual context. We study the problem in a simulated environment that retains many of the important properties of a dynamic world with multiple agents and actions while avoiding many of the complexities of robotics and computer vision. Specifically, we use the RoboCup simulator (Chen, Foroughi, Heintz, Kapetanakis, Kostiadis, Kummeneje, Noda, Obst, Riley, Steffens, Wang, & Yin, 2003) which provides a fairly detailed physical simulation of robot soccer. While several groups have constructed RoboCup commentator systems (André, Binsted, Tanaka-Ishii, Luke, Herzog, & Rist, 2000) that provide a textual natural-language (NL) transcript of the simulated game, their systems use manually-developed templates and are not based on learning.\nOur commentator system learns to semantically interpret and generate language in the RoboCup soccer domain by observing an on-going commentary of the game paired with the evolving simulator state. By exploiting existing techniques for abstracting a symbolic description of the activity on the field from the detailed states of the physical simulator (André et al., 2000), we obtain a pairing of natural language with a symbolic description of the perceptual context in which it was uttered. However, such training data is highly ambiguous because each comment usually co-occurs with several events in the game. We integrate and enhance existing methods for learning semantic parsers and NL generators (Kate & Mooney, 2007; Wong & Mooney, 2007) in order to learn to understand and generate language from such ambiguous training data. We also develop a system that, from the same ambiguous training data, learns which events are worth describing, so that it can also perform strategic generation, that is, deciding what to say as well as how to say it (tactical generation). 1\n1. For conciseness, we use this terminology from early work in generation (e.g., McKeown, 1985). Strategic and tactical\ngeneration are now also commonly referred to as content selection and surface realization, respectively\nWe evaluate our system and demonstrate its language-independence by training it to generate commentaries in both English and Korean. Experiments on test data (annotated for evaluation purposes only) demonstrate that the system learns to accurately semantically parse sentences, generate sentences, and decide which events to describe. Finally, subjective human evaluation of commentated game clips demonstrate that in our limited domain, the system generates sportscasts that are in some cases similar in quality to those produced by humans.\nThere are three main contributions we make in this paper. First, we explore the possibility of learning grounded language models from the perceptual context in the form of ambiguous parallel data. Second, we investigate several different methods of disambiguating this data and determined that using a combined score that includes both tactical and strategic generation scores performed the best overall. Finally, we built a complete system that learns how to sportscast in multiple languages. We carefully verified through automatic and human evaluations that the system is able to perform several tasks including disambiguating the training data, semantic parsing, tactical and strategic generation. While the language involved in this work is restricted compared to handcrafted commercial sportscasting systems, our goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of learning a grounded language system with no language-specific prior knowledge.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides background on previous work that we utilize and extend to build our system. Section 3 describes the sportscasting data we collected to train and test our approach. Section 4 and Section 5 present the details of our basic methods for learning tactical and strategic generation, respectively, and some initial experimental results. Section 6 discusses extensions to the basic system that incorporate information from strategic generation into the process of disambiguating the training data. Section 7 presents experimental results on initializing our system with data disambiguated by a recent method for aligning language with facts to which it may refer. Section 8 discusses additions that try to detect “superfluous” sentences that do not refer to any extracted event. Section 9 presents human evaluation of our automatically generated sportscasts. Section 10 reviews related work, Section 11 discusses future work, and Section 12 presents our conclusions."

      "heading" : "2. Background",
      "text" : "Systems for learning semantic parsers induce a function that maps natural-language (NL) sentences to meaning representations (MRs) in some formal logical language. Existing work has focused on learning from a supervised corpus in which each sentence is manually annotated with its correct MR (Mooney, 2007; Zettlemoyer & Collins, 2007; Lu, Ng, Lee, & Zettlemoyer, 2008; Jurcicek, Gasic, Keizer, Mairesse, Thomson, & Young, 2009). Such human annotated corpora are expensive and difficult to produce, limiting the utility of this approach. Kate and Mooney (2007) introduced an extension to one such system, KRISP (Kate & Mooney, 2006), so that it can learn from ambiguous training data that requires little or no human annotation effort. However, their system was unable to generate language which is required for our sportscasting task. Thus, we enhanced another system called WASP (Wong & Mooney, 2006) that is capable of language generation as well as semantic parsing in a similar manner to allow it to learn from ambiguous supervision. We briefly describe the previous systems below. All of these systems assume they have access to a formal deterministic context-free grammar (CFG) that defines the formal meaning representation language (MRL). Since MRLs are formal computer-interpretable languages, such a grammar is usually easily available."

      "text" : "KRISP (Kernel-based Robust Interpretation for Semantic Parsing) (Kate & Mooney, 2006) uses support vector machines (SVMs) with string kernels to build semantic parsers. SVMs are state-ofthe-art machine learning methods that learn maximum-margin separators to prevent over-fitting in very high-dimensional data such as natural language text (Joachims, 1998). They can be extended to non-linear separators and non-vector data by exploiting kernels that implicitly create an even higher dimensional space in which complex data is (nearly) linearly separable (Shawe-Taylor & Cristianini, 2004). Recently, kernels over strings and trees have been effectively applied to a variety of problems in text learning and NLP (Lodhi, Saunders, Shawe-Taylor, Cristianini, & Watkins, 2002; Zelenko, Aone, & Richardella, 2003; Collins, 2002; Bunescu & Mooney, 2005). In particular, KRISP uses the string kernel introduced by Lodhi et al. (2002) to classify substrings in an NL sentence.\nFirst, KRISP learns classifiers that recognize when a word or phrase in an NL sentence indicates that a particular concept in the MRL should be introduced into its MR. It uses production rules in the MRL grammar to represent semantic concepts, and it learns classifiers for each production that classify NL substrings as indicative of that production or not. When semantically parsing a sentence, each classifier estimates the probability of each production covering different substrings of the sentence. This information is then used to compositionally build a complete MR for the sentence. Given the partial matching provided by string kernels and the over-fitting prevention provided by SVMs, KRISP has been experimentally shown to be particularly robust to noisy training data (Kate & Mooney, 2006).\nKRISPER (Kate & Mooney, 2007) is an extension to KRISP that handles ambiguous training data, in which each sentence is annotated with a set of potential MRs, only one of which is correct. Psuedocode for the method is shown in Algorithm 1. It employs an iterative approach analogous to expectation maximization (EM) (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977) that improves upon the selection of the correct NL–MR pairs in each iteration. In the first iteration (lines 3-9), it assumes that all of the MRs paired with a sentence are correct and trains KRISP with the resulting noisy supervision. In subsequent iterations (lines 11-27), KRISPER uses the currently trained parser to score each potential NL–MR pair, selects the most likely MR for each sentence, and retrains the parser on the resulting disambiguated supervised data. In this manner, KRISPER is able to learn from the type of weak supervision expected for a grounded language learner exposed only to sentences in ambiguous contexts. However, the system has previously only been tested on artificially corrupted or generated data."

      "text" : "WASP (Word-Alignment-based Semantic Parsing) (Wong & Mooney, 2006) uses state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques (Brown, Cocke, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, Jelinek, Lafferty, Mercer, & Roossin, 1990; Yamada & Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005) to learn semantic parsers. SMTmethods learn effective machine translators by training on parallel corpora consisting of human translations of documents into one or more alternative natural languages. The resulting translators are typically significantly more effective than manually developed systems and SMT has become the dominant approach to machine translation. Wong and Mooney (2006) adapted such methods to learn to translate from NL to MRL rather than from one NL to another.\nFirst, an SMT word alignment system, GIZA++ (Och & Ney, 2003; Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, & Mercer, 1993), is used to acquire a bilingual lexicon consisting of NL substrings coupled\nAlgorithm 1 KRISPER\ninput sentences S and their associated sets of meaning representations MR(s) output BestExamplesSet , a set of NL-MR pairs,\nSemanticModel , a KRISP semantic parser\n1: 2: main 3: //Initial training loop 4: for sentence si ∈ S do 5: for meaning representation mj ∈MR(si) do 6: add (si ,mj ) to InitialTrainingSet 7: end for 8: end for\n9: SemanticModel = Train(InitialTrainingSet) 10: 11: //Iterative retraining 12: repeat 13: for sentence si ∈ S do 14: for meaning representation mj ∈MR(si) do 15: mj .score = Evaluate(si, mj ,SemanticModel) 16: end for 17: end for 18: BestExampleSet ← The set of consistent examples T = {(s, m)|s ∈ S, m ∈ MR(s)} such that ∑ T m.score is maximized 19: SemanticModel = Train(BestExamplesSet) 20: until Convergence or MAX ITER reached 21: end main\n22: 23: function Train(TrainingExamples) 24: Train KRISP on the unambiguous TrainingExamples 25: return The trained KRISP semantic parser 26: end function\n27: 28: function Evaluate(s, m, SemanticModel ) 29: Use the KRISP semantic parser SemanticModel to find a derivation of meaning representa-\ntion m from sentence s\n30: return The parsing score 31: end function\nwith their translations in the target MRL. As formal languages, MRLs frequently contain many purely syntactic tokens such as parentheses or brackets, which are difficult to align with words in NL. Consequently, we found it was much more effective to align words in the NL with productions of the MRL grammar used in the parse of the corresponding MR. Therefore, GIZA++ is used to produce an N to 1 alignment between the words in the NL sentence and a sequence of MRL productions corresponding to a top-down left-most derivation of the corresponding MR.\nComplete MRs are then formed by combining these NL substrings and their translations using a grammatical framework called synchronous CFG (SCFG) (Aho & Ullman, 1972), which forms the basis of most existing syntax-based SMT (Yamada & Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005). In an SCFG, the right hand side of each production rule contains two strings, in our case one in NL and the other in MRL. Derivations of the SCFG simultaneously produce NL sentences and their correspondingMRs. The bilingual lexicon acquired from word alignments over the training data is used to construct a set of SCFG production rules. A probabilistic parser is then produced by training a maximum-entropy model using EM to learn parameters for each of these SCFG productions, similar to the methods used by Riezler, Prescher, Kuhn, and Johnson (2000), and Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005). To translate a novel NL sentence into its MR, a probabilistic chart parser (Stolcke, 1995) is used to find the most probable synchronous derivation that generates the given NL, and the corresponding MR generated by this derivation is returned.\nSince SCFGs are symmetric, they can be used to generate NL fromMR as well as parse NL into MR (Wong & Mooney, 2007). This allows the same learned grammar to be used for both parsing and generation, an elegant property that has important advantages (Shieber, 1988). The generation system, WASP−1, uses a noisy-channel model (Brown et al., 1990):\narg max e Pr(e|f) = arg max e Pr(e) Pr(f |e) (1)\nWhere e refers to the NL string generated for a given input MR, f . Pr(e) is the language model, and Pr(f |e) is the parsing model provided by WASP’s learned SCFG. The generation task is to find a sentence e such that (1) e is a good sentence a priori, and (2) its meaning is the same as the input MR. For the language model, we use a standard n-gram model, which is useful in ranking candidate generated sentences (Knight & Hatzivassiloglou, 1995)."

      "heading" : "3. Sportscasting Data",
      "text" : "To train and test our system, we assembled human-commentated soccer games from the RoboCup simulation league (www.robocup.org). Since our focus is language learning and not computer vision, we chose to use simulated games instead of real game video to simplify the extraction of perceptual information. Based on the ROCCO RoboCup commentator’s incremental event recognition module (André et al., 2000) we manually developed symbolic representations of game events and a rule-based system to automatically extract them from the simulator traces. The extracted events mainly involve actions with the ball, such as kicking and passing, but also include other game information such as whether the current playmode is kickoff, offside, or corner kick. The events are represented as atomic formulas in predicate logic with timestamps. These logical facts constitute the requisite MRs, and we manually developed a simple CFG for this formal semantic language. Details of the events detected and the complete grammar can be found in Appendix A.\nFor the NL portion of the data, we had humans commentate games while watching them on the simulator. We collected commentaries in both English and Korean. The English commentaries were\nproduced by two different people while the Korean commentaries were produced by a single person. The commentators typed their comments into a text box, which were recorded with a timestamp. To construct the final ambiguous training data, we paired each comment with all of the events that occurred five seconds or less before the comment was made. Examples of the ambiguous training data are shown in Figure 2. The edges connect sentences to events to which they might refer. English translations of the Korean commentaries have been included in the figure for the reader’s benefit and are not part of the actual data. Note that the use of English words for predicates and constants in the MRs is for human readability only, the system treats these as arbitrary conceptual tokens and must learn their connection to English or Korean words.\nWe annotated a total of four games, namely, the finals for the RoboCup simulation league for each year from 2001 to 2004. Word statistics about the data are shown in Table 1. While the sentences are fairly short due to the nature of sportscasts, this data provides challenges in the form of synonyms (e.g. “Pink1”, “PinkG” and “pink goalie” all refer to the same player) and polysemes (e.g. “kick” in “kicks toward the goal” refers to a kick event whereas “kicks to Pink3” refers to a pass event.) Alignment statistics for the datasets are shown in Table 2. The 2001 final has almost twice the number of events as the other games because it went into double overtime.\nNatural Language Commentary Meaning Representation\nFor evaluation purposes only, a gold-standard matching was produced by examining each comment manually and selecting the correct MR if it exists. The matching is only approximate because sometimes the comments contain more information than present in the MRs. For example, a comment might describe the location and the length of a pass while theMR captures only the participants of a pass. The bold lines in Figure 2 indicate the annotated correct matches in our sample data. Notice some sentences do not have correct matches (about one fifth of the English data and one tenth of the Korean data). For example, the sentence “Purple team is very sloppy today” in Figure 2(a) cannot be represented in our MRL and consequently does not have a corresponding correct MR. For another example, the Korean sentence with the translation “pink3 passes to pink goalie” in Figure 2(b) can be represented in our MRL, but does not have a correct match due to the incomplete event detection. A free kick was called while pink3 was passing to the pink goalie so the pass event was not retrieved. Finally, in the case of the sentence “Pink11 makes a long pass to Pink8” in Figure 2(a), the correct MR falls outside of the 5-second window. For each game, Table 2 shows the total number of NL sentences, the number of these that have at least one recent extracted event to which it could refer, and the number of these that actually do refer to one of these recent extracted events. The maximum, average, and standard deviation for the number of recent events paired with each comment is also given."

We need a system that can both deal with ambiguous supervision like KRISPER and generate language like WASP. We introduce three systems below that can do both. An overview of the differences between the existing systems and the new systems we present are shown in Table 3.\nAll three systems introduced here are based on extensions to WASP, our underlying language learner. The main problem we need to solve is to disambiguate the training data so that we can train WASP as before to create a language generator. Each of the new system uses a different disambiguation criteria to determine the best matching between the NL sentences and the MRs."

It uses an EM-like retraining to handle ambiguously annotated data, resulting in a system we call WASPER. In general, any system that learns semantic parsers can be extended to handle ambiguous data as long as it can produce confidence levels for given NL–MR pairs. Given a set of sentences s ∈ S and the set of MRs associated with each sentence MR(s), we disambiguate the data by finding pairs (s, m), s ∈ S and m ∈MR(s) such that m = arg maxm Pr(m|s). Although probability is used here, a ranking of the relative potential parses would suffice. The pseudocode for WASPER is shown in Algorithm 2. The only difference compared to the KRISPER pseudocode is that we now use a WASP semantic parser instead of a KRISP parser. Also, we produce a WASP language generator as well which is the desired final output for our task.\nAlgorithm 2 WASPER\ninput sentences S and their associated sets of meaning representations MR(s) output BestExamplesSet , a set NL-MR pairs,\nSemanticModel , a WASP semantic parser/language generator\n1: main 2: same as Algorithm 1 3: end main\n4: 5: function Train(TrainingExamples) 6: Train WASP on the unambiguous TrainingExamples 7: return The trained WASP semantic parser/language generator 8: end function\n9:\n10: function Evaluate(s, m, SemanticModel ) 11: Use the WASP semantic parser in SemanticModel to find a derivation of meaning represen-\ntation m from sentence s\n12: return The parsing score 13: end function"

This is important when training on the very noisy training data used to initialize the parser in KRISPER’s first iteration. However, KRISPER cannot learn a language generator, which is necessary for our sportscasting task. As a result, we create a new system called KRISPER-WASP that is both good at disambiguating the training data and capable of generation. We first use KRISPER to train on the ambiguous data and produce a disambiguated training set by using its prediction for the most likely MR for each sentence. This unambiguous training set is then used to train WASP to produce both a parser and a generator."

      "text" : "In both KRISPER and WASPER, the criterion for selecting the best NL–MR pairs during retraining is based on maximizing the probability of parsing a sentence into a particular MR. However, since WASPER is capable of both parsing and generation, we could alternatively select the best NL–MR pairs by evaluating how likely it is to generate the sentence from a particular MR. Thus, we built another version of WASPER called WASPER-GEN that disambiguates the training data in order to maximize the performance of generation rather than parsing. The pseudocode is shown in Algorithm 3. The algorithm is the same as WASPER except for the evaluation function. It uses a generation-based score rather than a parsing-based score to select the best NL–MR pairs.\nSpecifically, an NL–MR pair (s, m) is scored by computing the NIST score, a machine translation (MT) metric, between the sentence s and the best generated sentence for m (lines 9-12).2 Formally, given a set of sentences s ∈ S and the set of MRs associated with each sentence MR(s), we disambiguate the data by finding pairs (s, m), s ∈ S and m ∈MR(s) such that m = arg maxm NIST (s, argmaxs′Pr(s ′|m)).\nNIST measures the precision of a translation in terms of the proportion of n-grams it shares with a human translation (Doddington, 2002). It has also been used to evaluate NL generation. Another popular MT metric is BLEU score (Papineni, Roukos, Ward, & Zhu, 2002), but it is inadequate for our purpose since we are comparing one short sentence to another instead of comparing whole documents. BLEU score computes the geometric mean of the n-gram precision for each value of n, which means the score is 0 if a matching n-gram is not found for every value of n. In the common setting in which the maximum n is 4, any two sentences that do not have a matching 4-gram would receive a BLEU score of 0. Consequently, BLEU score is unable to distinguish the quality of most of our generated sentences since they are fairly short. In contrast, NIST uses an additive score and avoids this problem."

We use WASP trained on the gold matching which consists of the correct NL–MR pairs annotated by a human as the upper baseline. This represents an upper-bound on what our systems could achieve if they disambiguated the training data perfectly.\nWe evaluate each system on three tasks: matching, parsing, and generation. The matching task measures how well the systems can disambiguate the training data. The parsing and generation tasks measure how well the systems can translate from NL to MR, and from MR to NL, respectively.\nSince there are four games in total, we trained using all possible combinations of one to three games. For matching, we measured the performance on the training data since our goal is to disambiguate this data. For parsing and generation, we tested on the games not used for training. Results were averaged over all train/test combinations. We evaluated matching and parsing using F-measure, the harmonic mean of recall and precision. Precision is the fraction of the system’s annotations that are correct. Recall is the fraction of the annotations from the gold-standard that the system correctly produces. Generation is evaluated using BLEU scores which roughly estimates how well the produced sentences match with the target sentences. We treat each game as a whole document to avoid the problem of using BLEU score for sentence-level comparisons mentioned earlier. Also, we increase the number of reference sentences for each MR by using all of the sentences in the test data corresponding to equivalent MRs, e.g. if pass(PinkPLayer7, PinkPlayer8) occurs multiple times in the test data, all of the sentences matched to this MR in the gold matchings are used as reference sentences for this MR."

Each trained system is used to parse and produce an MR for each sentence in the test set that has a correct MR in the gold-standard matching. A parse is considered correct if and only if it matches the gold standard exactly. Parsing is a fairly difficult task because there is usually more than one way to describe the same event. For example, “Player1 passes to player2” can refer to the same event as “Player1 kicks the ball to player2.” Thus, accurate parsing requires learning all the different ways people describe\nan event. Synonymy is not limited to verbs. In our data, “Pink1”, “PinkG” and “pink goalie” all refer to player1 on the pink team. Since we are not providing the systems with any prior knowledge, they have to learn all these different ways of referring to the same entity.\nThe parsing results shown in Figure 4 generally correlate well with the matching results. Systems that did better at disambiguating the training data also did better on parsing because their supervised training data is less noisy. WASPER-GEN again does the best overall on both the English and Korean data. It is interesting to note that KRISPER did relatively well on the English data compared to its matching performance. This is because KRISP is more robust to noise than WASP (Kate & Mooney, 2006) so even though it is trained on a noisier set of data than WASPER-GEN it still produced a comparable parser."

      "heading" : "4.4.3 GENERATION",
      "text" : "The third evaluation task is generation. All of the WASP-based systems are given eachMR in the test set that has a gold-standard matching NL sentence and asked to generate an NL description. The quality of the generated sentence is measured by comparing it to the gold-standard using BLEU scoring.\nThis task is more tolerant to noise in the training data than parsing because the system only needs to learn one way to accurately describe an event. This property is reflected in the results, shown in Figure 5, where even the baseline system, WASP with random matching, does fairly well, outperforming KRISPER-WASP on both datasets and WASPER on the Korean data. As the number of event types is fairly small, only a relatively small number of correct matchings is required to perform this task well as long as each event type is associated with some correct sentence pattern more often than any other sentence pattern.\nAs with the other two tasks, WASPER-GEN is the best system on this task. One possible explanation of WASPER-GEN’s superior performance stems from its disambiguation objective function. Systems like WASPER and KRISPER-WASP that use parsing scores attempt to learn a good translation model for each sentence pattern. On the other hand, WASPER-GEN only tries to learn a good\ntranslation model for each MR pattern. Thus, WASPER-GEN is more likely to converge on a good model as there are fewer MR patterns than sentence patterns. However, it can be argued that learning good translation models for each sentence pattern will help in producing more varied commentaries, a quality that is not captured by the BLEU score. Another possible advantage for WASPER-GEN is that it uses a softer scoring function. While the probabilities of parsing from a particular sentence to a MR can be sensitive to noise in the training data, WASPER-GEN only looks at the top generated sentences for each MR. Even with noise in the data, this top generated sentence remains relatively constant. Moreover, minor variations of this sentence do not change the results dramatically since the NIST score allows for partial matching."

      "text" : "A language generator alone is not enough to produce a sportscast. In addition to tactical generation which is deciding how to to say something, a sportscaster must also preform strategic generation which is choosing what to say (McKeown, 1985).\nWe developed a novel method for learning which events to describe. For each event type (i.e. for each predicate like pass, or goal), the system uses the training data to estimate the probability that it is mentioned by the sportscaster. Given the gold-standard NL–MR matches, this probability is easy to estimate; however, the learner does not know the correct matching. Instead, the system must estimate the probabilities from the ambiguous training data. We compare two basic methods for estimating these probabilities.\nThe first method uses the inferred NL–MRmatching produced by the language-learning system. The probability of commenting on each event type, ei, is estimated as the percentage of events of type ei that have been matched to some NL sentence.\nThe second method, which we call Iterative Generation Strategy Learning (IGSL), uses a variant of EM, treating the matching assignments as hidden variables, initializing each match with a prior probability, and iterating to improve the probability estimates of commenting on each event type. Unlike the first method, IGSL uses information about MRs not explicitly associated with any sentence in training. Algorithm 4 shows the pseudocode. The main loop alternates between two steps:\n1. Calculating the expected probability of each NL–MR matching given the current model of\nhow likely an event is commented on (line 6)\n2. Update the prior probability that an event type is mentioned by a human commentator based\non the matchings (line 9).\nIn the first iteration, each NL–MR match is assigned a probability inversely proportional to the\namount of ambiguity associated with the sentence ( ∑\ne∈Event(s) Pr(e) = |Event(s)|). For example,\na sentence associated with five possible MRs will assign each match a probability of 15 . The prior probability of mentioning an event type is then estimated as the average probability assigned to instances of this event type. Notice this process does not always guarantee a proper probability since a MR can be associated with multiple sentences. Thus, we limit the probability to be at most one. In the subsequent iterations, the probabilities of the NL–MR matchings are updated according to these new priors. We assign each match the prior probability of its event type normalized across all the associated MRs of the NL sentence. We then update the priors for each event type as before using\nAlgorithm 4 Iterative Generation Strategy Learning\ninput event types E = {e1, ..., en}, the number of occurrences of each event type TotalCount(ei) in the entire game trace, sentences S and the event types of their associated meaning represen-\ntations Event(s) output probabilities of commenting on each event type Pr(ei) 1: Initialize all Pr(ei) = 1 2: repeat\nthe new estimated probabilities for the matchings. This process is repeated until the probabilities converge or a pre-specified number of iterations has occurred.\nTo generate a sportscast, we use the learned probabilities to determine which events to describe. For each time step, we first determine all the events that are occurring at the time. We then select one randomly based on their normalized probabilities. To avoid being overly verbose, we do not want to make a comment every time something is happening, especially if it’s an event rarely commented on. Thus, we stochastically decide whether to comment on this selected event based on its probability. An example of this process is shown in Figure 6."

For the first approach, results using the inferred matchings produced by KRISPER, WASPER, and WASPER-GEN as well as the gold and random matching for establishing baselines are all presented in Figure 7. From the graph, it is clear that IGSL outperforms learning from the inferred matchings and actually performs at a level close to using the gold matching. However, it is important to note that we are limiting the potential of learning from the gold matching by using only the predicates to decide whether to talk about an event.\nFor the English data, the probabilities learned by IGSL and by inferred matchings fromWASPER-\nGEN for the five most frequently occurring events are shown in Table 4. While WASPER-GEN learns fairly good probabilities in general, it does not do as well as IGSL for the most frequent events. This is because IGSL uses occurrences of events that are not associated with any possible comments in its training iterations. Rarely commented events such as ballstopped and kick often occur without any comments being uttered. Consequently, IGSL assigns low prior probabilities to them which lowers their chances of being matched to any sentences. On the other hand, WASPER-GEN does not use these priors and sometimes incorrectly matches comments to them. Thus, using the inferred\nmatches from WASPER-GEN results in learning higher probabilities of commenting on these rarely commented events.\nWhile all our methods only use the predicates of the MRs to decide whether to comment or not, they perform quite well on the data we collected. In particular, IGSL performs the best, so we use it for strategic generation in the rest of the paper."

In the previous section, we described several ways to learn strategic generation, including IGSL which learns directly from the ambiguous training data. Knowing what events people tend to talk about should also help resolve ambiguities in the training data. Events that are more likely to be discussed should also be more likely to be matched to an NL sentence when disambiguating the training data.

WASPER-GEN uses NIST score to pick the best MR for a sentence by finding the MR that generates the sentence closet to the actual NL sentence. WASPER-GEN-IGSL combines tactical (NIST) and strategic (IGSL) generation scores to pick the best NL–MR pairs. It simply multiplies the NIST score and the IGSL score together to form a composite score. This new score biases the selection of matching pairs to include events that IGSL determines are, a priori, more likely to be discussed. This is very helpful, especially in the beginning when WASP does not produce a particularly good language generator. In many instances, the generated sentences for all of the possible MRs are equally bad and do not overlap with the target sentence. Even if generation produces a perfectly good sentence, the generation score can be unreliable because it is comparing a single sentence to a single reference that is often very short as well. Consequently, it is often difficult for WASPER-GEN to distinguish among several MRs with equal scores. On the other hand, if their event types have very different strategic generation scores, then we can default to choosing the MR with the higher prior probability of being mentioned.

For example, it is not normalized, which may affect the performance of WASPER-GENIGSL when it is combined with the IGSL score. Another limitation comes from using higher-order N-grams. Commentaries in our domain are often short, so there are frequently no higher-order N-gram matches between generated sentences and target NL sentences.\nThe METEOR metric (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005) was designed to resolve various weaknesses of the BLEU and NISTmetrics, and it is more focused on word-to-word matches between the reference\nAlgorithm 5 WASPER-GEN-IGSL\ninput sentences S and their associated sets of meaning representations MR(s) output BestExamplesSet , a set of NL-MR pairs,\nSemanticModel , a WASP semantic parser/language generator\n1: main 2: same as Algorithm 1 3: end main\n4: 5: function Train(TrainingExamples) 6: same as Algorithm 2 7: end function\n8: 9: function Evaluate(s, m, SemanticModel ) 10: Call Algorithm 4 to collect IGSL scores 11: GeneratedSentence ← Use the WASP language generator in SemanticModel to produce a sentence from the meaning representation m 12: TacticalGenerationScore ← The NIST score between GeneratedSentence and s 13: StrategicGenerationScore ← Pr(event type of m) from the result of Algorithm 4 14: return TacticalGenerationScore × StrategicGenerationScore 15: end function\nsentence and the test sentence.

For both the English and the Korean datasets, WASPER-GEN-IGSL and its variant using the METEOR metric clearly outperform WASPER-GEN which does not utilize strategic information.

As one of their evaluation domains, they used our English RoboCup sportscasting data. Their method solves the matching (alignment) problem for our data, but does not address the tasks of semantic parsing or language generation. However, their generative model elegantly integrates simple strategic and tactical language generation models in order to find the overall most probable alignment of sentences and events. They demonstrated improved matching performance on our English data, generating more accurate NL–MR pairs than our best system. Thus, we were curious if their results could be used to improve our own systems, which also perform semantic parsing and generation. We also ran their code on our new Korean data but that resulted in much worse matching results compared to our best system as can be seen in Table 5.\nThe simplest way of utilizing their results is to use the NL–MR pairs produced by their method as supervised data for WASP. As expected, the improved NL–MR pairs for the English data resulted in improved semantic parsers as can be seen in the results in Table 6. Even for the Korean dataset, training on matchings produced by their system ended up doing fairly well even though the matching performance was poor. For tactical generation, using their matching only produced marginal improvement on the English dataset and a surprisingly large improvement on the Korean data as\nshown in Table 7. Overall, using the alignments produced by Liang et al.’s system resulted in good semantic parsers and tactical generators.\nIn addition to training WASP with their alignment, we can also utilize their output as a better starting point for our own systems. Instead of initializing our iterative alignment methods with a model trained on all of the ambiguous NL–MR pairs, they can be initialized with the disambiguated NL–MR pairs produced by Liang et al.’s system.\nInitializing the systems in this manner almost always improved the performance on all three tasks (Tables 5, 6, and 7). Moreover, the results from the best systems exceed that of simply training WASP with the alignment in all cases except for semantic parsing on the English data. Thus, combining Liang et al.’s alignment with our disambiguation techniques seems to produce the best overall results. For the English data, WASPER with initialization performs the best on both matching and generation. It does slightly worse on the semantic parsing task compared to WASP trained on Liang et al.’s alignment. For the Korean data, all the systems do better than just training WASP on the alignment. WASPER-GEN-IGSL-METEOR with initialization performs the best on matching and semantic parsing while WASPER-GEN with initialization performs the best on generation.\nOverall, initializing our systems with the alignment output of Liang et al.’s generative model improved performance as expected. Starting with a cleaner set of data led to better initial semantic parsers and language generators which led to better end results. Furthermore, by incorporating a semantic parser and a tactical generator, we were able to improve on the Liang et al.’s alignments and achieve even better results in most cases."

      "heading" : "8. Removing Superfluous Comments",
      "text" : "So far, we have only discussed how to handle ambiguity in which there are multiple possible MRs for each NL sentence. During training, all our methods assume that each NL sentence matches exactly one of the potential MRs. However, some comments are superfluous, in the sense that they do not refer to any currently extracted event represented in the set of potential MRs. As previously shown in Tables 2, about one fifth of the English sentences and one tenth of the Korean sentences are superfluous in this sense.\nThere are many reasons for superfluous sentences. They occur naturally in language because people do not always talk about the current environment. In our domain, sportscasters often mention past events or more general information about particular teams or players. Moreover, depending on the application, the chosen MRL may not represent all of the things people talk about. For example, our RoboCup MRL cannot represent information about players who are not actively engaged with the ball. Finally, even if a sentence can be represented in the chosen MRL, errors in the perceptual system or an incorrect estimation of when an event occurred can also lead to superfluous sentences. Such perceptual errors can be alleviated to some degree by increasing the size of the window used to capture potential MRs (the previous 5 seconds in our experiments). However, this comes at the cost of increased ambiguity because it associates more MRs with each sentence.\nTo deal with the problem of superfluous sentences, we can eliminate the lowest-scoring NL–MR pairs (e.g. lowest parsing scores for WASPER or lowest NIST scores for WASPER-GEN). However, in order to set the pruning threshold, we need to automatically estimate the amount of superfluous commentary in the absence of supervised data. Notice that while this problem looks similar to the strategic generation problem (estimating how likely an MR participates in a correct matching as opposed to how likely an NL sentence participates in a correct matching), the approaches used there cannot be applied. First, we cannot use the matches inferred by the existing systems to estimate the fraction of superfluous comments since the current systems match every sentence to some MR. It is also difficult to develop an algorithm similar to IGSL due to the imbalance between NL sentences and MRs. Since there are many more MRs, there are more examples of events occurring without commentaries than vice versa."

      "heading" : "8.1 Estimating the Superfluous Rate Using Internal Cross Validation",
      "text" : "We propose using a form of internal (i.e. within the training set) cross validation to estimate the rate of superfluous comments. While this algorithm can be used in conjunction with any of our systems, we chose to implement it for KRISPER which trains much faster than our other systems. This makes it more tractable to train many different semantic parsers and choose the best one. The basic idea is to use part of the ambiguous training data to estimate the accuracy of a semantic parser even though we do not know the correct matchings. Assuming a reasonable superfluous sentence rate, we know that most of the time the correct MR is contained in the set of MRs associated with an NL sentence. Thus, we assume that a semantic parser that parses an NL sentence into one of the MRs associated with it is better than one that parses it into an MR not in the set. With this approach to estimating accuracy, we can evaluate semantic parsers learned using various pruning thresholds and pick the best one. The algorithm is briefly summarized in the following steps:\n1. Split the training set into an internal training set and an internal validation set.\n2. Train KRISPER N times on the internal training set using N different threshold values (elim-\ninating the lowest scoring NL–MR pairs below the threshold in each retraining iteration in Algorithm 1).\n3. Test the N semantic parsers on the internal validation set and determine which parser is able\nto parse the largest number of sentences into one of their potential MRs.\n4. Use the threshold value that produced the best parser in the previous step to train a final parser\non the complete original training set."

For matching, we only show results for KRISPER because it is responsible for disambiguating the training data for both systems (so KRISPER-WASP’s results are the same). For generation, we only show results for KRISPER-WASP, since KRISPER cannot perform generation.\nThe matching results shown in Figure 11 demonstrate that removing superfluous sentences does improve the performance for both English and Korean, although the difference is small in absolute terms. The parsing results shown in Figure 12 indicate that removing superfluous sentences usually improves the accuracy of both KRISPER and KRISPER-WASP marginally. As we have observed many times, the parsing results are consistent with the matching results. Finally, the tactical generation results shown in Figure 13 suggest that removing superfluous comments actually decreases performance somewhat. Once again, a potential explanation is that generation is less sensitive to noisy training data. While removing superfluous comments improves the purity of the training data, it also removes potentially useful examples. Consequently, the system does not learn how to generate sentences that were removed from the data. Overall, for generation, the advantage of having cleaner disambiguated training data is apparently outweighed by the loss of data."

      "heading" : "9. Human Subjective Evaluation",
      "text" : "At best, automatic evaluation of generation is an imperfect approximation of human assessment. Moreover, automatically evaluating the quality of an entire generated sportscast is even more difficult. Consequently, we used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to collect human judgements of the produced sportscasts. Each human judge was shown three clips of simulated game video in one sitting. There were 8 video clips total. The 8 clips use 4 game segments of 4 minutes each, one from each of the four games (2001-2004 RoboCup finals). Each of the 4 game segments is commentated once by a human and once by our system. We use IGSL to determine the events to comment on and WASPER-GEN (our best performing system for tactical generation) to produce the commentaries. To make the commentaries more varied, we took the top 5 outputs from WASPER-GEN and chose one stochastically weighted by their scores. The system was always trained on three games, leaving out the game from which the test segment was extracted. The video clips were accompanied by commentaries that both appear as subtitles on the screen as well as audio produced by a automated text to speech system 3 The videos are shown in random counter-balanced order to ensure no consistent bias toward segments being shown earlier or later. We asked the judges to score the commentaries using the following metrics:\nSemantic Sportscasting\nScore Fluency Correctness Ability\n5 Flawless Always Excellent 4 Good Usually Good 3 Non-native Sometimes Average 2 Disfluent Rarely Bad 1 Gibberish Never Terrible\nFluency and semantic correctness, or adequacy, are standard metrics in human evaluations of NL translations and generations. Fluency measures howwell the commentaries are structured, including syntax and grammar. Semantic correctness indicates whether the commentaries accurately describe what is happening in the game. Finally, sportscasting ability measures the overall quality of the sportscast. This includes whether the sportscasts are interesting and flow well. In addition to these metrics, we also asked them whether they thought the sportscast was composed by a human or a computer (Human?).\nSince Mechanical Turk recruits judges over the Internet, we had to make sure that the judges were not assigning ratings randomly. Thus, in addition to asking them to rate each video, we also asked them to count the number of goals in each video. Incorrect responses to this question caused their ratings to be discarded. This is to ensure that the judges faithfully watched the entire clip before assigning ratings. After such pruning, there was on average 36 ratings (from 40 original ratings) for each of the 8 videos for the English data. Since it was more difficult to recruit Korean judges over the Internet, we recruited them in person and collected 7 ratings on average for each video in the Korean data. Table 8 and 9 show the results for the English and Korean data, respectively. Statistically significant results are shown in boldface.\nResults are surprisingly good for the English data across all categories with the machine actually scoring higher than the human on average. However, the differences are not statistically significant\n3. Sample video clips with sound are available on the web at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/\nclamp/sportscasting/.\nbased on an unpaired t-test (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, it is encouraging to see the machine being rated so highly. There is some variance in the human’s performance since there were two different commentators. Most notably, compared to the machine, the human’s performance on the 2002 final is quite good because his commentary included many details such as the position of the players, the types of passes, and comments about the overall flow of the game. On the other hand, the human’s performance on the 2003 final is quite bad because the human commentator was very “mechanical” and used the same sentence pattern repeatedly. The machine performance was more even throughout although sometimes it gets lucky. For example, the machine serendipitously said ”This is the beginning of an exciting match.” near the start of the 2004 final clip simply because this statement was incorrectly learned to correspond to an extracted MR that is actually unrelated.\nThe results for Korean are not as impressive. The human beats the machine on average for all categories. However, the largest difference between the scores in any category is only 0.8. Moreover, the absolute scores indicate that the generated Korean sportscast is at least of acceptable quality. The judges even mistakenly thought they were produced by humans one third of the time. Part of the reason for the worse performance compared to the English data is that the Korean commentaries were fairly detailed and included events that were not extracted by our limited perceptual system. Thus, the machine simply had no way of competing because it is limited to only expressing information that is present in the extracted MRs.\nWe also elicited comments from the human judges to get a more qualitative evaluation. Overall, the judges thought the generated commentaries were good and accurately described the actions on the field. Picking from the top 5 generated sentences also added variability to the machine-generated sportscasts that improved the results compared with earlier experiments presented by Chen and Mooney (2008). However, the machine still sometimes misses significant plays such as scoring or corner kicks. This is because these plays happen much less frequently and often coincide with many other events (e.g. shooting the ball and kickoffs co-occur with scoring). Thus, the machine has a harder time learning about these infrequent events. Another issue concerns our representation. Many people complain about long gaps in the sportscasts or lack of details. Our event detector only concentrates on ball possession and not on positions or elapsed time. Thus, a player holding onto a ball or dribbling for a long time does not produce any events detected by our simulated perceptual system. Also, a short pass in the backfield is treated exactly the same as a long pass across the field to near the goal. Finally, people desired more colorful commentary (background information, statistics, or analysis of the game) to fill in the voids. This is a somewhat orthogonal issue since our goal was to build a play-by-play commentator that described events that were currently happening."

Since the world never provides any direct feedback on syntactic structure, language-learning methods that\nrequire syntactic annotation are not directly applicable to grounded language learning. Therefore, methods that learn from only semantic annotation are critical to learning language from perceptual context.\nWhile we use logic formulas as our MRs, the particular MRL we use contains only atomic formulas and can be equivalently represented as frames and slots. There are systems that use transformation-based learning (Jurcicek et al., 2009), or Markov logic (Meza-Ruiz, Riedel, & Lemon, 2008) to learn semantic parsers using frames and slots.

In contrast, we concentrate on the learning problem and induce the generation components from ambiguous training data. Nevertheless, augmenting our system with some of the other components in these systems could improve the final sportscasts produced.\nThere is also prior work on learning a lexicon of elementary semantic expressions and their corresponding natural language realizations (Barzilay & Lee, 2002). This work uses multiple-sequence alignment on datasets that supply several verbalizations of the corresponding semantics to extract a dictionary.\nDuboue andMcKeown (2003) were the first to propose an algorithm for learning strategic generation automatically from data. Using semantics and associated texts, their system learns a classifier that determines whether a particular piece of information should be included for presentation or not.\nThere has been some recent work on learning strategic generation using reinforcement learning (Zaragoza & Li, 2005). This work involves a game setting where the speaker must aid the listener in reaching a given destination while avoiding obstacles. The game is played repeatedly to find an optimal strategy that conveys the most pertinent information while minimizing the number of messages. We consider a different problem setting where such reinforcements are not available to our strategic generation learner.\nIn addition, there has also been work on performing strategic generation as a collective task (Barzilay & Lapata, 2005). By considering all strategic generation decisions jointly, it captures dependencies between utterances. This creates more consistent overall output and is more consistent with how humans perform this task. Such an approach could potentially help our system produce better overall sportscasts."

The system first transforms raw visual data into geometrical representations. Next, a set of rules extract spatial relations and interesting motion events from those representations. Presumed intentions, plans, and plan\ninteractions between the agents are also extracted based on domain-specific knowledge. However, since their system is hand-coded it cannot be adapted easily to new domains.\nSrihari and Burhans (1994) used captions accompanying photos to help identify people and objects. They introduced the idea of visual semantics, a theory of extracting visual information and constraints from accompanying text. For example, by using caption information, the system can determine the spatial relationship between the entities mentioned, the likely size and shape of the object of interest, and whether the entity is natural or artificial. However, their system is also based on hand-coded knowledge.\nSiskind (1996) performed some of the earliest work on learning grounded word meanings. His learning algorithm addresses the problem of ambiguous training or “referential uncertainty” for semantic lexical acquisition, but does not address the larger problems of learning complete semantic parsers and language generators.\nSeveral robotics and computer vision researchers have worked on inferring grounded meanings of individual words or short referring expressions from visual perceptual context (e.g., Roy, 2002; Bailey et al., 1997; Barnard et al., 2003; Yu & Ballard, 2004). However, the complexity of the natural language used in this existing work is very restrictive, many of the systems use pre-coded knowledge of the language, and almost all use static images to learn language describing objects and their relations, and cannot learn language describing actions. The most sophisticated grammatical formalism used to learn syntax in this work is a finite-state hidden-Markov model. By contrast, our work exploits the latest techniques in statistical context-free grammars and syntax-based statistical machine translation that handle more of the complexities of natural language.\nMore recently, Gold and Scassellati (2007) built a system called TWIG that uses existing language knowledge to help it learn the meaning of new words. The robot uses partial parses to focus its attention on possible meanings of new words. By playing a game of catch, the robot was able to learn the meaning of “you” and “me” as well as “am” and “are” as identity relations.\nThere has also been a variety of work on learning from captions that accompany pictures or videos (Satoh, Nakamura, & Kanade, 1997; Berg, Berg, Edwards, & Forsyth, 2004). This area is of particular interest given the large amount of captioned images and video available on the web and television. Satoh et al. (1997) built a system to detect faces in newscasts. However, they use fairly simple manually-written rules to determine the entity in the picture to which the language refers. Berg et al. (2004) used a more elaborate learning method to cluster faces with names. Using the data, they estimate the likelihood of an entity appearing in a picture given its context.\nSome recent work on video retrieval has focused on learning to recognize events in sports videos and connecting them to English words appearing in accompanying closed captions (Fleischman & Roy, 2007; Gupta & Mooney, 2009). However, this work only learns the connection between individual words and video events and does not learn to describe events using full grammatical sentences. To avoid difficult problems in computer vision, our work uses a simulated world where perception of complex events and their participants is much simpler.\nIn addition to observing events passively, there has also been work on grounded language learning in more interactive environments such as in computer video games (Gorniak & Roy, 2005). In this work, players cooperate and communicate with each in order to accomplish a certain task. The system learns to map spoken instructions to specific actions; however, it relies on existing statistical parsers and does not learn the syntax and semantics of the language from the perceptual environment alone. Kerr, Cohen, and Chang (2008) developed a system that learns grounded word-meanings for nouns, adjectives, and spatial prepositions while a human is instructing it to perform tasks in a vir-\ntual world; however, the system assumes an existing syntactic parser and prior knowledge of verb semantics and is unable to learn these from experience.\nRecently, there has been some interest in learning how to interpret English instructions describing how to use a particular website or perform other computer tasks (Branavan et al., 2009; Lau, Drews, & Nichols, 2009). These systems learn to predict the correct computer action (pressing a button, choosing a menu item, typing into a text field, etc.) corresponding to each step in the instructions. Instead of using parallel training data from the perceptual context, these systems utilize direct matches between words in the natural language instructions and English words explicitly occurring in the menu items and computer instructions in order to establish a connection between the language and the environment.\nOne of the core subproblems our work addresses is matching sentences to facts in the world to which they refer. Some recent projects attempt to align text from English summaries of American football games with database records that contain statistics and events about the game (Snyder & Barzilay, 2007; Liang et al., 2009). However, Snyder and Barzilay (2007) use a supervised approach that requires annotating the correct correspondences between the text and the semantic representations. On the other hand, Liang et al. (2009) have developed an unsupervised approach using a generative model to solve the alignment problem. They also demonstrated improved results on matching sentences and events on our RoboCup English sportscasting data. However, their work does not address semantic parsing or language generation. Section 7 presents results showing how our methods can improve the NL–MR matches produced by this approach as well as use them to learn parsers and generators."

      "text" : "As previously discussed, some of the limitations of the current system are due to inadequacies in the perception of events extracted from the RoboCup simulator. Some of the language commentary, particularly in the Korean data, refers to information about events that is not currently represented in the extractedMRs. For example, a player dribbling the ball is not captured by our perceptual system. The event extractor could be extended to include such information in the output representations.\nCommentaries are not always about the immediate actions happening on the field. They can also refer to statistics about the game, background information, or analysis of the game. While some of these are difficult to obtain, it would be simple to augment the potential MRs to include events such as the current score or the number of turnovers, etc. While these may be difficult to learn correctly, they potentially would make the commentaries much more natural and engaging.\nSome statements in the commentaries specifically refer to a pattern of activity across several recent events rather than to a single event. For example, in one of the English commentaries, the statement “Purple team is very sloppy today.” appears after a series of turn-overs to the other team. The simulated perception could be extended to extract patterns of activity such as “sloppiness;” however this assumes that such concepts are predefined, and extracting many such higher-level predicates would greatly increase ambiguity in the training data. The current system assumes it already has concepts for the words it needs to learn and can perceive these concepts and represent them in MRs. However, it would be interesting to include a more “Whorfian” style of language learning (Whorf, 1964) in which an unknown word such as “sloppiness” could actually cause the creation of a new concept. For content words that do not seem to consistently correlate with any perceived event, the system could collect examples of recent activity where the word is used and try\nto learn a new higher-level concept that captures a regularity in these situations. For example, given examples of situations referred to as “sloppy,” an inductive logic programming system (Lavrac̆ & Dz̆eroski, 1994) should be able to detect the pattern of several recent turnovers.\nAnother shortcoming of the current system is that each MR is treated independently. This fails to exploit the fact that manyMRs are related to each other. For example, a pass is preceded by a kick, and a bad pass is followed by a turnover. A more natural way is to use a graphical representation to represent not only the entities and events but also the relationships between them.\nCurrently tactical and strategic generation in our system are only loosely coupled. However, conceptually they are much more closely related, and solving one problem should help solve the other. Initializing our systemwith the output from Liang et al. (2009), which uses a generative model that includes both strategic and tactical components, produced somewhat better results. However, the interaction between all these components is very loose and a tighter integration of the different pieces could yield stronger results in all the tasks.\nAn obvious extension to the current work is to apply it to real RoboCup games rather than simulated ones. Recent work by Rozinat, Zickler, Veloso, van der Aalst, and McMillen (2008) analyzes games in the RoboCup Small Size League using video from the overhead camera. By using the symbolic event trace extracted by such a real perceptual system, our methods could be applied to real-world games. Using speech recognition to accept spoken language input is another obvious extension.\nWe are currently exploring extending our approach to learn to interpret and generate NL instructions for navigating in a virtual environment. The system will observe one person giving English navigation instructions (e.g. ”Go down the hall and turn left after you pass the chair.”) to another person who follows these directions to get to a chosen destination. By collecting examples of sentences paired with the actions that were executed together with information about the local environment, the system will construct an ambiguous supervised dataset for language learning. Such an approach could eventually lead to virtual agents in games and educational simulations that can automatically learn to interpret and generate natural language instructions."

      "text" : "We have presented an end-to-end system that learns to generate natural-language sportscasts for simulated RoboCup soccer games by training on sample human commentaries paired with automatically extracted game events. By learning to semantically interpret and generate language without explicitly annotated training data, we have demonstrated that a system can learn language by simply observing linguistic descriptions of ongoing events. We also demonstrated the system’s language independence by successfully training it to produce sportscasts in both English and Korean.\nDealing with the ambiguous supervision inherent in the training environment is a critical issue in learning language from perceptual context. We have evaluated various methods for disambiguating the training data in order to learn semantic parsers and language generators. Using a generation evaluation metric as the criterion for selecting the best NL–MR pairs produced better results than using semantic parsing scores when the initial training data is very noisy. Our system also learns a model for strategic generation from the ambiguous training data by estimating the probability that each event type evokes human commentary. Moreover, using strategic generation information to help disambiguate the training data was shown to improve the results. We also demonstrated that our system can be initialized with alignments produced by a different system to achieve better\nresults than either system alone. Finally, experimental evaluation verified that the overall system learns to accurately parse and generate comments and to generate sportscasts that are competitive with those produced by humans."

Some recent work on video retrieval has focused on learning to recognize events in sports videos and connecting them to English words appearing in accompanying closed captions (Fleischman & Roy, 2007; Gupta & Mooney, 2009). However, this work only learns the connection between individual words and video events and does not learn to describe events using full grammatical sentences. To avoid difficult problems in computer vision, our work uses a simulated world where perception of complex events and their participants is much simpler. In addition to observing events passively, there has also been work on grounded language learning in more interactive environments such as in computer video games (Gorniak & Roy, 2005). In this work, players cooperate and communicate with each in order to accomplish a certain task. The system learns to map spoken instructions to specific actions; however, it relies on existing statistical parsers and does not learn the syntax and semantics of the language from the perceptual environment alone. Kerr, Cohen, and Chang (2008) developed a system that learns grounded word-meanings for nouns, adjectives, and spatial prepositions while a human is instructing it to perform tasks in a vir-",

We demonstrate its capabilities by developing a system that learns to sportscast simulated robot soccer games in both English and Korean without any language-specific prior knowledge. Training employs only ambiguous supervision consisting of a stream of descriptive textual comments and a sequence of events extracted from the simulation trace. The system simultaneously establishes correspondences between individual comments and the events that they describe while building a translation model that supports both parsing and generation. We also present a novel algorithm for learning which events are worth describing. Human evaluations of the generated commentaries indicate they are of reasonable quality and in some cases even on par with those produced by humans for our limited domain.",
