The attention-based encoder-decoder models can be used for the generation of corrections, in addition to error identification, which is of interest for certain end-user applications. We show that a character-based encoder-decoder model is particularly effective, outperforming other results on the AESW Shared Task on its own, and showing gains over a word-based counterpart. Our final model—a combination of three character-based encoder-decoder models, one word-based encoder-decoder model, and a sentence-level CNN—is the highest performing system on the AESW 2016 binary prediction Shared Task."

      "text" : "The recent confluence of data availability and strong sequence-to-sequence learning algorithms has the potential to lead to practical tools for writing support. Grammatical error identification is one such application of potential utility as a component of a writing support tool. Much of the recent work in grammatical error identification and correction has made use of hand-tuned rules and features that augment data-driven approaches, or individual classifiers for human-designated subsets of errors. Given a large, annotated dataset of scientific journal articles, we propose a fully data-driven approach for\nthis problem, inspired by recent work in neural machine translation and more generally, sequence-tosequence learning (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014).\nThe Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing (AESW) 2016 dataset is a collection of nearly 10,000 scientific journal articles (over 1 million sentences) published between 2006 and 2013 and annotated with corrections by professional, native English-speaking editors. The goal of the associated AESW Shared Task is to identify whether or not a given unedited source sentence was corrected by the editor (that is, whether a given source sentence has one or more grammatical errors, broadly construed).\nThis system report describes our approach and submission to the AESW 2016 Shared Task, which establishes the current highest-performing public baseline for the binary prediction task. Our primary contribution is to demonstrate the utility of an attention-based encoder-decoder model for the binary prediction task. We also provide evidence of tangible performance gains using a character-aware version of the model, building on the characteraware language modeling work of Kim et al. (2016). In addition to sentence-level classification, the models are capable of intra-sentence error identification and the generation of possible corrections. We also obtain additional gains by using an ensemble of a generative encoder-decoder and a discriminative CNN classifier."

Grammar correction and error identification can be cast as a sequence-to-sequence translation problem, in which an unedited (source) sentence is “translated” into a corrected (target) sentence in the same language. Using this framework, sentence-level error identification then simply reduces to an equality check between the source and target sentences.\nThe goal of the AESW shared task is to identify whether a particular sentence needs to be edited (contains a “grammatical” error, broadly construed1). The dataset consists of sentences taken from academic articles annotated with corrections by professional editors. Annotations are described via insertions and deletions, which are marked with start and end tags. Tokens to be deleted are surrounded with the deletion start tag <del> and the deletion end tag </del> and tokens to be inserted are surrounded with the insertion start tag <ins> and the insertion end tag </ins>. Replacements (as shown in Figure 1) are represented as deletioninsertion pairs. Unlike the related CoNLL-2014 Shared Task (Ng et al., 2014) data, errors are not labeled with fine-grained types (article or determiner error, verb tense error, etc.).\nMore formally, we assume a vocabulary V of natural language word types (some of which have orthographic errors) and a set Q = {<ins>,</ins>,<del>,</del>} of annotation tags. Given a sentence s = [s1, . . . , sI ], where si ∈ V is the i-th token of the sentence of length I , we seek to predict whether or not the gold, annotated target sentence t = [t1, . . . , tJ ], where tj ∈ Q ∪ V is the j-th token of the annotated sentence of length J , is identical to s. We are given both s and t for supervised training. At test time, we are only given access to sequence s. We learn to predict sequence t.\nEvaluation of this binary prediction task is via the F1-score, where the positive class is that indicating an error is present in the sentence (that is, where s 6= t)2.\n1Some insertions and deletions in the shared task data represent stylistic choices, not all of which are necessarily recoverable given the sentence or paragraph context. For the purposes here, we refer to all such edits as “grammatical” errors.\n2The 2016 Shared Task also included a probabilistic esti-\nEvaluation is at the sentence level, but the paragraph-level context for each sentence is also provided. The paragraphs, themselves, are shuffled so that full article context is not available. A coarse academic field category is also provided for each paragraph. Our models described below do not make use of the paragraph context nor the field category, and they treat each sentence independently.\nFurther information about the task is available in the Shared Task report (Daudaravicius et al., 2016)."

      "text" : "While this is the first year for a shared task focusing on sentence-level binary error identification, previous work and shared tasks have focused on the related tasks of intra-sentence identification and correction of errors. Until recently, standard handannotated grammatical error datasets were not available, complicating comparisons and limiting the choice of methods used. Given the lack of a large hand-annotated corpus at the time, Park and Levy (2011) demonstrated the use of the EM algorithm for parameter learning of a noise model using error data without corrections, performing evaluation on a much smaller set of sentences hand-corrected by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers.\nMore recent work has emerged as a result of a series of shared tasks, starting with the Helping Our Own (HOO) Pilot Shared Task run in 2011, which focused on a diverse set of errors in a small dataset (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011), and the subsequent HOO 2012 Shared Task, which focused on the automated detection and correction of preposition and determiner errors (Dale et al., 2012). The CoNLL-2013 Shared Task (Ng et al., 2013)3 focused on the correction of a limited set of five error types in essays by second-language learners of English at the National University of Singapore. The follow-up CoNLL-2014 Shared Task (Ng et al., 2014)4 focused on the full generation task of correcting all errors in essays by second-language learners.\nAs with machine translation (MT), evaluation of\nmation track. We leave for future work the adaptation of our approach to that task.\n3http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/˜nlp/ conll13st.html\n4http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/˜nlp/ conll14st.html\nthe full generation task is still an open research area, but a subsequent human evaluation ranked the output from the CoNLL-2014 Shared Task systems (Napoles et al., 2015). The system of Felice et al. (2014) ranked highest, utilizing a combination of a rule-based system and phrase-based MT, with re-ranking via a large web-scale language model. Of the non-MT based approaches, the IllinoisColumbia system was a strong performer, combining several classifiers trained for specific types of errors (Rozovskaya et al., 2014)."

We utilize the one-layer CNN architecture of Kim (2014) with the publicly available5 word vectors trained on the Google News dataset, which contains about 100 billion words (Mikolov et al., 2013). We experiment with keeping the word vectors static (CNN-STATIC) and fine-tuning the vectors (CNN-NONSTATIC). The CNN models only have access to sentence-level labels and are not given correction-level annotations."

      "heading" : "4.2 Encoder-Decoder",
      "text" : "While it may seem more natural to utilize models trained for binary prediction, such as the aforementioned CNN, or for example, the recurrent network\n5https://code.google.com/archive/p/ word2vec/\napproach of Dai and Le (2015), we hypothesize that training at the lowest granularity of annotations may be useful for the task. We also suspect that the generation of corrections is of sufficient utility for endusers to further justify exploring models that produce corrections in addition to identification. We thus use the Shared Task as a means of assessing the utility of a full generation model for the binary prediction task.\nWe propose two encoder-decoder architectures for this task. Our word-based architecture (WORD) is similar to that of Luong et al. (2015). Our character-based models (CHAR) still make predictions at the word-level, but use a CNN and a highway network over characters instead of word embeddings as the input to the encoder and decoder, as depicted in Figure 1. We follow past work (Sutskever et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015) in stacking multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) networks, in both the encoder and decoder.\nHere, we model the probability of the target given the source, p(t | s), with an encoder neural network that summarizes the source sequence and a decoder neural network that generates a distribution over the target words and tags at each step given the source.\nWe start by describing the basic encoder and decoder architectures in terms of the WORD model, and then we describe the CHAR model departures from WORD.\nEncoder The encoder reads the source sentence and outputs a sequence of vectors, associated with each word in the sentence, which will be selectively accessed during decoding via a soft attentional mechanism. We use a LSTM network to obtain the hidden states hsi ∈ Rn for each time step i,\nhsi = LSTM(h s i−1,x s i ).\nFor the WORD models, xsi ∈ Rm is the word embedding for si, the i-th word in the source sentence. (The analogue for the CHAR models is discussed below.) The output of the encoder is the sequence of hidden state vectors [hs1, . . . ,h s I ]. The initial hidden state of the encoder is set to zero (i.e. hs0 ← 0).\nDecoder The decoder is another LSTM that produces a distribution over the next target word/tag\ngiven the source vectors [hs1, . . . ,h s I ] and the previously generated target words/tags t<j = [t1, . . . tj ]. Let\nhtj = LSTM(h t j−1,x t j)\nbe the summary of the target sentence up to the j-th word, where xtj is the word embedding for tj in the WORD models. The current target hidden state htj is combined with each of the memory vectors in the source to produce attention weights as follows,\nuj,i = h t j ·Wαhsi αj,i = expuj,i∑\nk∈[1,I] expuj,k\nThe source vectors are multiplied with the respective attention weights, summed, and interacted with the current decoder hidden state htj to produce a context vector cj ,\nvj = ∑ i∈[1,I] αj,ih s i\ncj = tanh(W[vj ;h t j ])\nThe probability distribution over the next\nword/tag is given by applying an affine transformation to cj followed by a softmax,\np(tj+1 | s, t<j) = softmax(Ucj + b)\nFinally, as in Luong et al. (2015), we feed cj as additional input to the decoder for the next time step by concatenating it with xtj , so the decoder equation is modified to,\nhtj = LSTM(h t j−1, [x t j ; cj−1])\nThis allows the decoder to have knowledge of previous (soft) alignments at each time step. The decoder hidden state is initialized with the final hidden state of the encoder (i.e. ht0 ← hsI ).\nCharacter Convolutional Neural Network For the CHAR models, instead of a word embedding, our input for each word in the source/target sentence is an output from a character-level convolutional neural network (CharCNN) (depicted in Figure 1). Our character model closely follows that of Kim et al. (2016).\nSuppose word si is composed of characters [p1, . . . , pl]. We concatenate the character embeddings to form the matrix Pi ∈ Rc×l, where the k-th\ncolumn corresponds to the character embedding for pk (of dimension c).\nWe then apply a convolution between Pi and a filter H ∈ Rc×w of width w, after which we add a bias and apply a nonlinearity to obtain a feature map fi ∈ Rl−w+1. The k-th element of fi is given by,\nfi[k] = tanh(〈Pi[∗, k : k + w − 1],H〉+ b)\nwhere 〈A,B〉 = Tr(ABT ) is the Frobenius inner product and Pi[∗, k : k + w − 1] is the k-to-(k + w − 1)-th column of Pi. Finally, we take the maxover-time\nzi = max k fi[k]\nas the feature corresponding to filter H. We use multiple filters H1, . . .Hh to obtain a vector zi ∈ Rh as the representation for a given source/target word or tag. We have separate CharCNNs for the encoder and decoder.\nHighway Network Instead of replacing the word embedding xi with zi, we feed zi through a highway network (Srivastava et al., 2015). Whereas a multilayer perceptron produces a new set of features via the following transformation (given input z),\nẑ = f(Wz+ b)\na highway network instead computes,\nẑ = r f(Wz+ b) + (1− r) z\nwhere f is a non-linearity (in our models, ReLU), is the element-wise multiplication operator, and r = σ(Wrz+br) and 1−r are called the transform and carry gates. We feed zi into the highway network to obtain ẑi, which is used to replace the input word embeddings in both the encoder and the decoder.\nInference Exact inference is computationally infeasible for the encoder-decoder models given the combinatorial explosion of possible output sequences, but we follow past work in NMT using beam search. We do not constrain the generation process of words outside insertion tags to words in the source, and each low-frequency holder token generated in the target sentence is replaced with the source token associated with the maximum attention weight. We use a beam size of 10 for all models,\nwith the exception of one of the models in the final system combination, for which we use a beam of size 5, as noted in Section 6.\nNote that this model generates corrections, but we are only interested in determining the existence of any error at the sentence-level. As such, after beam decoding, we simply check for whether there were any corrections in the target. However, we found that decoding in this way under-predicts sentencelevel errors. It is therefore important to calibrate the weights associated with corrections, which we discuss in Section 5.3."

To the best of our knowledge, the AESW dataset is the first large-scale, publicly available professionally edited dataset of academic, scientific writing. The training set consists of 466,672 sentences with edits and 722,742 sentences without edits, and the development set contains 57,340 sentences with edits and 90,106 sentences without. The raw training and development datasets are provided as annotated sentences, t, from which the s sequences may be deterministically derived. There are 143,802 sentences in the Shared Task test set with hidden gold labels, which serve directly as s sequences.\nAs part of pre-processing, we treat each sentence independently, discarding paragraph context (which sentences, if any, were present in the same paragraph) and domain information, which is a coarse grouping by the field of the original journal (Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, etc.). We generate Penn Treebank style tokenizations of the input. Case is maintained and digits are not replaced with holder symbols. The vocabulary is restricted to the 50,000 most common tokens, with remaining low frequency tokens replaced with a special <unk> token. The CHAR model can encode but not decode over open vocabularies and hence we do not have any <unk> tokens on the source side of those models. For all of the encoder-decoder models, we replace the lowfrequency target symbols during inference as discussed above in Section 4.2.\nFor development against the provided data with labels, we set aside a 10,000 sentence sample from the original development set for tuning, and use the remaining 137,446 sentences for validation6. The encoder-decoder models are given all 466,672 pairs of s and t sequences with edits, augmented with varying numbers of pairs without edits. The CHAR+SAMPLE and WORD+SAMPLE models are given a random sample of 200,000 pairs without edits for a total of 666,672 pairs of s and t sequences. The CHAR+ALL and WORD+ALL models are given all 722,742 sentences without edits for a total of 1,189,414 pairs of s and t sequences. For some of the final testing models, we also train with the development sentences. In these latter cases, all sequence pairs are used. In training all of the encoder-decoder models, as indicated in Section 5.2, we drop sentences exceeding 50 tokens in length.\nWe also experimented with creating corrected versions of sentences for the CNN. The binary CNN classifiers are given 1,656,086 single-sentence training examples, of which 722,742 are error-free examples (in which s = t), and the remaining examples are constructed by removing the tags from the annotated sentences, t, to create tag-free examples that contain errors (466,672 instances) and additional error-free examples (466,672 instances)."

A limited grid search on the development set determined our use of filter windows of width 3, 4, and 5 and 1000 feature maps. We trained for 10 epochs. Training otherwise followed the approach of the correspondingly named CNN-STATIC and CNN-NONSTATIC models of Kim (2014).\n6Note that the number of sentences in the final development set without labels posted on CodaLab (http://codalab. org) differed from that originally posted on the AESW 2016 Shared Task website with labels.\n7http://torch.ch\nencoder-decoder Initial parameter settings (including architecture decisions such as the number of layers and embedding and hidden state sizes) were informed by concurrent work in neural machine translation and existing work such as that of Sutskever et al.

The parameters for the WORD model were uniformly initialized in [−0.1, 0.1], and those of the CHAR model were uniformly initialized in [−0.05, 0.05]. The L2normalized gradients were constrained to be ≤ 5. Our learning rate schedule started the learning rate at 1 and halved the learning rate after each epoch beyond epoch 10, or once the validation set perplexity no longer improved. The WORD model used 1000-dimensional word embeddings. For CHAR, the character embeddings were 25-dimensional, the filter width was 6, the number of feature maps was 1000, and 2 highway layers were used. The maximum word length was 35 characters for training CHAR. Note that we do not reverse the source (s) sequences, unlike some previous NMT work. Following the work of Zaremba et al. (2014), we employed dropout with a probability of 0.3 between the LSTM layers.\nTraining both WORD and CHAR on the training set took on the order of a few days using GPUs, with the former being more efficient than the latter. In practice, we used two GPUs for training CHAR due to memory requirements."

Analogously, for the encoderdecoder models, after training the models, we tuned the bias weights (given as input to the final softmax layer generating the words/tags distribution) associated with the four annotation tags via a simple grid search by iteratively running beam search on the tun-\ning set.

It is possible this is due to the ability of the CHAR models to capture some types of orthographic errors.\nThe empirical results suggest that simply adding additional already correct source-target pairs when training the encoder-decoder models may not boost\nperformance, ceteris paribus, as seen in comparing the performance of CHAR+SAMPLE vs WORD+SAMPLE, and CHAR+ALL vs WORD+ALL. We leave to future work alternative approaches for introducing additional correct (target) sentences, as has been examined for neural machine translation models (Sennrich et al., 2015; Gülçehre et al., 2015).\nOur results provide initial evidence to support the hypothesis that training at the lowest granularity of annotation is a more efficient use of data than training against the binary label. In future work, we plan to compare against sentence classification using LSTMs (Dai and Le, 2015) and convolutional models that use correction-level annotations.\nAnother benefit of the encoder-decoder models is that they can be used to generate corrections (and identify locations of intra-sentence errors) for endusers. However, the added generation capabilities of the encoder-decoder models comes at the expense of considerably longer training and testing times compared to the CNN classifiers.\nWe found that post-hoc tuning provides a straightforward means of tuning the precision-recall tradeoff for these models, and we speculate (but leave to future work for investigation) that in practice, endusers might prefer greater emphasis placed on precision over recall."

Our models do not make use of hand-tuned rules, are not trained with explicit syntactic annotations, and do not make use of individuals classifiers designed for humandesignated subsets of errors.\nFor the encoder-decoder models, modeling at the sub-word level was beneficial, even though predictions were still made at the word level. It would be of interest to push this further to eliminate the need for an initial tokenization step, in order to generalize the approach to other languages, such as Chinese and Japanese.\nWe plan to examine alternative approaches for training with additional correct (target) sentences. Inducing artificial errors to generate more incorrect (source) sentences is also a direction we intend to pursue.\nWe leave for future work an analysis of the generation quality of our encoder-decoder models on the AESW dataset and the CoNLL-2014 Shared Task data, as well as user studies to assess whether performance is sufficient in practice to be useful, including the utility of correction vs. identification.\nWe consider this to be just the beginning of the development of data-driven support tools for writers, and many areas remain to be explored."
